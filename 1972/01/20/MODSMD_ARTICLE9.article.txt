To: The Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford
University and All Other Members of the Ruling Class of
the Empire
"I have long been aware that my every appearance in public
drew upon me the hostile attention of certain powerful persons
in finance in San Francisco, and they redoubled their efforts to
| be rid of me. But / had no choice but to go straight ahead. "
Professor Edward Ross (1900), the first in a long line of
Stanford professors to be fined for their political views.
Thank you for your kind and generous permission to
I allow me to "comment in writing" on the decision of
j your management to fire me. You ask me to state my
! reasons why you should not "concur" in this decision,
| which of course you arrived at years before the events of
i early 1971, the subsequent charges, and the kangaroo
j hearing. There is no chance whatsoever that you will not
• concur, no matter what the facts were nor whatever I
j say now. But it may be important for all of us that the
i issues be spelled out clearly.
You should not concur for the following reasons: I
i did not do the things 1 was charged with. Even if I had,
I not one would violate either any law or any Stanford
rule, written or unwritten. The university needs to have,
and sooner or later will have, teachers saying the same
thing that 1 did say in the political speeches now
branded as "urging and inciting." By firing me you will
merely further expose yourselves for what you are and
Stanford University for what it is, and you will reap as
you sow.
I. The facts
A. Urging and inciting. As people in the anti-war and
! anti-imperialist movement at Stanford are well aware, I
have always maintained a policy of never advocating
anything I would or could not do myself. In fact, I have
always refrained from even voting in favor of anything I
would or could not do, and hnve strongly urged
everybody in public meetings to adopt this as a matter
of principle. (Dennis Hayes can vouch for this.)
An examination of the four charges will show how
grossly the Administration and the Board has
| misrepresented to you and the public the facts of this
case.
B. The Lodge Incident. After a professor is
unanimously acquitted of a charge brought by the
Administration, and after it has been conclusively
proven that the Administration's witnesses were
: presenting false testimony (including testimony by a
I member of the Administration), what would we expect
| from the Board serving as the judge and jury? Might they
j not discuss the seriousness of bringing false charges and
; warn of the dangers of political repression? Of course
| not. This Board reveals itself for what it is in these
i words: Franklin "describes the disruption at the Lodge
I speech as too weak, and clcarly indicates his own
: preference for more violent actions. This combination of
' views has the effect of making incitement almost a way
; of life." (p. 36) Where do they find this "preference for
| more violent actions"? They allude here to my letter to
| Lyman in response to the charge, a letter written ten
I days after the event. So here we have an example of ex
post facto incitement. And what are the "violent
actions" I prefer? What 1 said was this: "The appropriate
response to war criminals is not heckling, but what was
done to them at Nuremberg: they should be locked up
j or executed." So what the Board means by incitement is
clear: Franklin's political views, freely expressed,
I constitute urging and inciting, no matter what the
! circumstances. Despite all their professions to the
I contrary, this is precisely the standard they apply to the
remaining three charges, which are all "urging and
inciting."
c. The White Plaza speech. 1 did not urge and incite an
occupation of the Computation Center. In fact I did not
even mention it, nor did anyone else at the White Plaza
rally.
Subsequent events prove the absurdity of this charge,
if any proof were needed beyond the speech itself.
During the hearing, uncontested evidence, produced by
witnesses for both sides, proved that after the rally, the
following happened: People went from the rally to the
area outside the Computation Center. They stayed

outside for 20-30 minutes. Somebody then entered,
possibly by breaking in. Other people followed. They
walked around inside and conversed with the people
working there. After a while, some of the demonstrators
said explcitly that there had been no discussion of
occupying the building, that people had not thought
they would get inside, and that therefore they should
leave the building and hold a meeting to decide what to
do. The great majority of demonstrators then left the
building, and held a 40-minute meeting out front. It was
at this meeting that they decided to go inside and stay
there until Gamut-H, the S.R.I, amphibious invasion
plan being programmed on the computer in direct
violation of the university policy on research, was
stopped. They made an uncontested decision not to do
any damage and to make a public announcement that
they were committed to this.
This is only one of many examples where the Board,
in direct violation of Paragraph 15a, fails to include any
"express findings upon all disputed matters of fact." To
convict me of these ridiculous charges, they are forced
to pretend that most of the evidence does not exist.
Here and elsewhere, it is not a case of the Board
choosing to believe one Administration witness and to
disbelieve many defense witnesses. Rather they choose
to deny or ignore the very existence of numerous
defense witnesses as well as exculpatory evidence
presented by Administration witnesses.
D. The third charge. Many hundreds of pages of
testimony, hundred of photographs, and a video film all
go to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this is a false
charge. What I did do was to attempt to get faculty
observers to stay on the scene, and to attempt to
convince the police not to attack the people. There is no
other explanation of my behavior that makes any sense,
as two of the Administration's key witnesses (Broholm
and Moses) acknowledged under cross examination. As
many witnesses, including several official faculty
observers, attested, I put myself in physical jeopardy in
order to try to prevent violence, the only violence that
did in fact occur, the violence of the police against
unarmed, peaceful, lawful demonstrators.
E. The Old Union speech. There was not a single
witness on either side who testified that I urged and
incited, or even mentioned, any unlawful, violent, or
prohibited conduct in my speeches that night. The entire
case here rests on an implied causal relation between
these speeches and subsequent acts of violence. The
Administration was permitted, over our repeated
strenuous objections, to present evidence attempting to
prove this causal relation. But when our turn came, we
were not allowed by the Board to present our side of
this key question. We did, however, make a formal offer
of proof, which was noted by the Board. We offered to
prove that the fight which occurred shortly after the
rally broke up began when a group of right-wing
students physically attacked, without provocation, a
group of people who had been at the rally. We also
offered to prove that the shooting which occurred later
that evening was probably done by a member of the
Santa Clara County Sheriffs Department. The Board's
behavior here, neither allowing us to present our side of
the case nor accepting as proven what we offered to
show, outrages all notions of due process and judicial
fairness.
11. Violations of what?
A. The law. If I did indeed urge and incite violent
acts, this violates California Law. So I hereby urge and
incite you to have this brought to criminal court, where
we would at least be protected by subpoena, perjury
laws, and legal precedent. But of course even the
Administration has now quietly dropped its claims that
anything I did or said was unlawful. There is now tacit
acknowledgement that the First Amendment docs not
apply at Stanford.
B. Stanford's rules, policies, and regulations, written
and unwritten.
1. The Comp Center incident in relation to the speech
in White Plaza. As we show clcarly in the final brief, the
demonstration at the Comp. Center itself did not expose

any participant to Stanford prosecution under the Policy
on Campus Disruption or anything else. That is why
none of the demonstrators was ever prosecuted by the
SJC, although their identity was well known and proven
in photographs. (In the one case that was brought, two
people were acquitted of assaulting a photographer
inside the Comp. Center. Their participation in the
•demonstration, which they freely admitted, was not at
issue, and the SJC found no basis for prosecuting them
for this.) So we have the strange case of someone being
prosecuted for "urging and inciting" an action, which he
never mentioned, and which, when it occurred, was not
liable to University prosecution.
2. Outside the Comp. Center. Here the case is even
clearer. The University Prosecutor himself stated flatly
that a person who did refuse to disperse would be
committing "no violation of any University regulation"
and would not be subject to "any disciplinary action."
(pp. 2645-2646). So even if I did what 1 have been
falsely charged with doing I would be merely urging and
inciting conduct which is permitted.
3. Here we have the ultimate absurdity. Not only are
we not told what rules would be violated by conduct
that I "urged and incited," we still do not know what
conduct it is that I "urged and incited."
111. The penalty.
There is no precedent for any of this. How then can
firings be justified? Further, no warning was ever given,
though I have been making speeches like this for years.
You can't have it both ways. Either this is a first offense,
which then would hardly justify firing, or else I have
been doing the same thing before, without either
prosecution or warning, and therefore was led to believe
(as I did) that such speeches violated no rules. Of course
I knew, as we all do, that such speeches and behavior
(even speaking at movement rallies) were considered
outrageous by you, the past and present Presidents, and
most of the faculty, who hooted and booed me down
when I attempted to present these ideas to them in an
Academic Council meeting a few years ago. But there is
supposed to be, according to your professed ideals, a
vast difference b'etween speeches that outrage
established opinion and speeches that subject the
speaker to punishment.
IV. Conclusion
But all of this is beside the main point. The essence of
the case is that neither you nor your Administration nor
the majority of the faculty you hire wish to permit a
communist revolutionary to teach in your university,
whose land you stole from native Americans and
Mexicans, whose resources you stole from poor and
working people, and which is financed, directly and
indirectly, by money stolen from the working class at
home and your victims around the world. You can not
tolerate even one person expressing the views of poor
and working people because such ideas do indeed, as the
Board's decision states, threaten the very existence of
your institution in its present form. But you cannot
suppress our ideas by repressing us.
Sooner or later the people will take Stanford
University away from you and will use all its vast
resources to serve their needs rather than your sick drive
for personal profit. In fact, they are going to take your
entire empire away from you.
You are part of a dinosaur class, outwardly powerful
and ferocious, but doomed by history because of the
insatiable appetites and irrationality of your system. Go
right ahead. Play your greedy roles to the hilt. And be
remembered in history for what you arc by the hundred
of millions of people you now rule but who will soon
gain the power to control their own destinies.
It is you who will be dismissed, in every sense of that
word. The poor and working people of your empire will
win, no matter what you do.

never mentioned, and which, when it occurred, was not
liable to University prosecution.
2. Outside the Comp. Center. Here the case is even
clearer. The University Prosecutor himself stated flatly
that a person who did refuse to disperse would be
committing "no violation of any University regulation"
and would not be subject to "any disciplinary action."
(pp. 2645-2646). So even if I did what 1 have been
falsely charged with doing I would be merely urging and
inciting conduct which is permitted.
3. Here we have the ultimate absurdity. Not only are
we not told what rules would be violated by conduct
that I "urged and incited," we still do not know what
conduct it is that I "urged and incited."
111. The penalty.
There is no precedent for any of this. How then can
firings be justified? Further, no warning was ever given,
though I have been making speeches like this for years.
You can't have it both ways. Either this is a first offense,
which then would hardly justify firing, or else I have
been doing the same thing before, without either
prosecution or warning, and therefore was led to believe
(as I did) that such speeches violated no rules. Of course
I knew, as we all do, that such speeches and behavior
(even speaking at movement rallies) were considered
outrageous by you, the past and present Presidents, and
most of the faculty, who hooted and booed me down
when I attempted to present these ideas to them in an
Academic Council meeting a few years ago. But there is
supposed to be, according to your professed ideals, a
vast difference b'etween speeches that outrage
established opinion and speeches that subject the
speaker to punishment.
IV. Conclusion
But all of this is beside the main point. The essence of
the case is that neither you nor your Administration nor
the majority of the faculty you hire wish to permit a
communist revolutionary to teach in your university,
whose land you stole from native Americans and
Mexicans, whose resources you stole from poor and
working people, and which is financed, directly and
indirectly, by money stolen from the working class at
home and your victims around the world. You can not
tolerate even one person expressing the views of poor
and working people because such ideas do indeed, as the
Board's decision states, threaten the very existence of
your institution in its present form. But you cannot
suppress our ideas by repressing us.
Sooner or later the people will take Stanford
University away from you and will use all its vast
resources to serve their needs rather than your sick drive
for personal profit. In fact, they are going to take your
entire empire away from you.
You are part of a dinosaur class, outwardly powerful
and ferocious, but doomed by history because of the
insatiable appetites and irrationality of your system. Go
right ahead. Play your greedy roles to the hilt. And be
remembered in history for what you arc by the hundred
of millions of people you now rule but who will soon
gain the power to control their own destinies.
It is you who will be dismissed, in every sense of that
word. The poor and working people of your empire will
win, no matter what you do.

"I have long been aware that my every appearance in public
drew upon me the hostile attention of certain powerful persons
in finance in San Francisco, and they redoubled their efforts to
| be rid of me. But / had no choice but to go straight ahead. "
Professor Edward Ross (1900), the first in a long line of
Stanford professors to be fined for their political views.
Thank you for your kind and generous permission to
I allow me to "comment in writing" on the decision of
j your management to fire me. You ask me to state my
! reasons why you should not "concur" in this decision,
| which of course you arrived at years before the events of
i early 1971, the subsequent charges, and the kangaroo
j hearing. There is no chance whatsoever that you will not
• concur, no matter what the facts were nor whatever I
j say now. But it may be important for all of us that the
i issues be spelled out clearly.
You should not concur for the following reasons: I
i did not do the things 1 was charged with. Even if I had,
I not one would violate either any law or any Stanford
rule, written or unwritten. The university needs to have,
and sooner or later will have, teachers saying the same
thing that 1 did say in the political speeches now
branded as "urging and inciting." By firing me you will
merely further expose yourselves for what you are and
Stanford University for what it is, and you will reap as
you sow.
I. The facts
A. Urging and inciting. As people in the anti-war and
! anti-imperialist movement at Stanford are well aware, I
have always maintained a policy of never advocating
anything I would or could not do myself. In fact, I have
always refrained from even voting in favor of anything I
would or could not do, and hnve strongly urged
everybody in public meetings to adopt this as a matter
of principle. (Dennis Hayes can vouch for this.)
An examination of the four charges will show how
grossly the Administration and the Board has
| misrepresented to you and the public the facts of this
case.
B. The Lodge Incident. After a professor is
unanimously acquitted of a charge brought by the
Administration, and after it has been conclusively
proven that the Administration's witnesses were
: presenting false testimony (including testimony by a
I member of the Administration), what would we expect
| from the Board serving as the judge and jury? Might they
j not discuss the seriousness of bringing false charges and
; warn of the dangers of political repression? Of course
| not. This Board reveals itself for what it is in these
i words: Franklin "describes the disruption at the Lodge
I speech as too weak, and clcarly indicates his own
: preference for more violent actions. This combination of
' views has the effect of making incitement almost a way
; of life." (p. 36) Where do they find this "preference for
| more violent actions"? They allude here to my letter to
| Lyman in response to the charge, a letter written ten
I days after the event. So here we have an example of ex
post facto incitement. And what are the "violent
actions" I prefer? What 1 said was this: "The appropriate
response to war criminals is not heckling, but what was
done to them at Nuremberg: they should be locked up
j or executed." So what the Board means by incitement is
clear: Franklin's political views, freely expressed,
I constitute urging and inciting, no matter what the
! circumstances. Despite all their professions to the
I contrary, this is precisely the standard they apply to the
remaining three charges, which are all "urging and
inciting."
c. The White Plaza speech. 1 did not urge and incite an
occupation of the Computation Center. In fact I did not
even mention it, nor did anyone else at the White Plaza
rally.
Subsequent events prove the absurdity of this charge,
if any proof were needed beyond the speech itself.
During the hearing, uncontested evidence, produced by
witnesses for both sides, proved that after the rally, the
following happened: People went from the rally to the
area outside the Computation Center. They stayed

outside for 20-30 minutes. Somebody then entered,
possibly by breaking in. Other people followed. They
walked around inside and conversed with the people
working there. After a while, some of the demonstrators
said explcitly that there had been no discussion of
occupying the building, that people had not thought
they would get inside, and that therefore they should
leave the building and hold a meeting to decide what to
do. The great majority of demonstrators then left the
building, and held a 40-minute meeting out front. It was
at this meeting that they decided to go inside and stay
there until Gamut-H, the S.R.I, amphibious invasion
plan being programmed on the computer in direct
violation of the university policy on research, was
stopped. They made an uncontested decision not to do
any damage and to make a public announcement that
they were committed to this.
This is only one of many examples where the Board,
in direct violation of Paragraph 15a, fails to include any
"express findings upon all disputed matters of fact." To
convict me of these ridiculous charges, they are forced
to pretend that most of the evidence does not exist.
Here and elsewhere, it is not a case of the Board
choosing to believe one Administration witness and to
disbelieve many defense witnesses. Rather they choose
to deny or ignore the very existence of numerous
defense witnesses as well as exculpatory evidence
presented by Administration witnesses.
D. The third charge. Many hundreds of pages of
testimony, hundred of photographs, and a video film all
go to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this is a false
charge. What I did do was to attempt to get faculty
observers to stay on the scene, and to attempt to
convince the police not to attack the people. There is no
other explanation of my behavior that makes any sense,
as two of the Administration's key witnesses (Broholm
and Moses) acknowledged under cross examination. As
many witnesses, including several official faculty
observers, attested, I put myself in physical jeopardy in
order to try to prevent violence, the only violence that
did in fact occur, the violence of the police against
unarmed, peaceful, lawful demonstrators.
E. The Old Union speech. There was not a single
witness on either side who testified that I urged and
incited, or even mentioned, any unlawful, violent, or
prohibited conduct in my speeches that night. The entire
case here rests on an implied causal relation between
these speeches and subsequent acts of violence. The
Administration was permitted, over our repeated
strenuous objections, to present evidence attempting to
prove this causal relation. But when our turn came, we
were not allowed by the Board to present our side of
this key question. We did, however, make a formal offer
of proof, which was noted by the Board. We offered to
prove that the fight which occurred shortly after the
rally broke up began when a group of right-wing
students physically attacked, without provocation, a
group of people who had been at the rally. We also
offered to prove that the shooting which occurred later
that evening was probably done by a member of the
Santa Clara County Sheriffs Department. The Board's
behavior here, neither allowing us to present our side of
the case nor accepting as proven what we offered to
show, outrages all notions of due process and judicial
fairness.
11. Violations of what?
A. The law. If I did indeed urge and incite violent
acts, this violates California Law. So I hereby urge and
incite you to have this brought to criminal court, where
we would at least be protected by subpoena, perjury
laws, and legal precedent. But of course even the
Administration has now quietly dropped its claims that
anything I did or said was unlawful. There is now tacit
acknowledgement that the First Amendment docs not
apply at Stanford.
B. Stanford's rules, policies, and regulations, written
and unwritten.
1. The Comp Center incident in relation to the speech
in White Plaza. As we show clcarly in the final brief, the
demonstration at the Comp. Center itself did not expose

any participant to Stanford prosecution under the Policy
on Campus Disruption or anything else. That is why
none of the demonstrators was ever prosecuted by the
SJC, although their identity was well known and proven
in photographs. (In the one case that was brought, two
people were acquitted of assaulting a photographer
inside the Comp. Center. Their participation in the
•demonstration, which they freely admitted, was not at
issue, and the SJC found no basis for prosecuting them
for this.) So we have the strange case of someone being
prosecuted for "urging and inciting" an action, which he
never mentioned, and which, when it occurred, was not
liable to University prosecution.
2. Outside the Comp. Center. Here the case is even
clearer. The University Prosecutor himself stated flatly
that a person who did refuse to disperse would be

(pp. 2645-2646). So even if I did what 1 have been

3. Here we have the ultimate absurdity. Not only are

111. The penalty.
There is no precedent for any of this. How then can
firings be justified? Further, no warning was ever given,
though I have been making speeches like this for years.
You can't have it both ways. Either this is a first offense,

Here and elsewhere, it is not a case of the Board
choosing to believe one Administration witness and to
disbelieve many defense witnesses. Rather they choose
to deny or ignore the very existence of numerous
defense witnesses as well as exculpatory evidence
presented by Administration witnesses.
D. The third charge. Many hundreds of pages of
testimony, hundred of photographs, and a video film all
go to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this is a false
charge. What I did do was to attempt to get faculty
observers to stay on the scene, and to attempt to
convince the police not to attack the people. There is no
other explanation of my behavior that makes any sense,
as two of the Administration's key witnesses (Broholm
and Moses) acknowledged under cross examination. As
many witnesses, including several official faculty
observers, attested, I put myself in physical jeopardy in
order to try to prevent violence, the only violence that
did in fact occur, the violence of the police against
unarmed, peaceful, lawful demonstrators.
E. The Old Union speech. There was not a single
witness on either side who testified that I urged and
incited, or even mentioned, any unlawful, violent, or
prohibited conduct in my speeches that night. The entire
case here rests on an implied causal relation between
these speeches and subsequent acts of violence. The
Administration was permitted, over our repeated
strenuous objections, to present evidence attempting to
prove this causal relation. But when our turn came, we
were not allowed by the Board to present our side of
this key question. We did, however, make a formal offer
of proof, which was noted by the Board. We offered to
prove that the fight which occurred shortly after the
rally broke up began when a group of right-wing
students physically attacked, without provocation, a
group of people who had been at the rally. We also
offered to prove that the shooting which occurred later
that evening was probably done by a member of the
Santa Clara County Sheriffs Department. The Board's
behavior here, neither allowing us to present our side of
the case nor accepting as proven what we offered to
show, outrages all notions of due process and judicial
fairness.
11. Violations of what?
A. The law. If I did indeed urge and incite violent
acts, this violates California Law. So I hereby urge and
incite you to have this brought to criminal court, where
we would at least be protected by subpoena, perjury
laws, and legal precedent. But of course even the
Administration has now quietly dropped its claims that
anything I did or said was unlawful. There is now tacit
acknowledgement that the First Amendment docs not
apply at Stanford.
B. Stanford's rules, policies, and regulations, written
and unwritten.
1. The Comp Center incident in relation to the speech
in White Plaza. As we show clcarly in the final brief, the
demonstration at the Comp. Center itself did not expose

any participant to Stanford prosecution under the Policy
on Campus Disruption or anything else. That is why
none of the demonstrators was ever prosecuted by the
SJC, although their identity was well known and proven
in photographs. (In the one case that was brought, two
people were acquitted of assaulting a photographer
inside the Comp. Center. Their participation in the
•demonstration, which they freely admitted, was not at
issue, and the SJC found no basis for prosecuting them
for this.) So we have the strange case of someone being
prosecuted for "urging and inciting" an action, which he
never mentioned, and which, when it occurred, was not
liable to University prosecution.
2. Outside the Comp. Center. Here the case is even
clearer. The University Prosecutor himself stated flatly
that a person who did refuse to disperse would be
committing "no violation of any University regulation"
and would not be subject to "any disciplinary action."
(pp. 2645-2646). So even if I did what 1 have been
falsely charged with doing I would be merely urging and
inciting conduct which is permitted.
3. Here we have the ultimate absurdity. Not only are
we not told what rules would be violated by conduct
that I "urged and incited," we still do not know what
conduct it is that I "urged and incited."
111. The penalty.
There is no precedent for any of this. How then can
firings be justified? Further, no warning was ever given,
though I have been making speeches like this for years.
You can't have it both ways. Either this is a first offense,
which then would hardly justify firing, or else I have
been doing the same thing before, without either
prosecution or warning, and therefore was led to believe
(as I did) that such speeches violated no rules. Of course
I knew, as we all do, that such speeches and behavior
(even speaking at movement rallies) were considered
outrageous by you, the past and present Presidents, and
most of the faculty, who hooted and booed me down
when I attempted to present these ideas to them in an
Academic Council meeting a few years ago. But there is
supposed to be, according to your professed ideals, a
vast difference b'etween speeches that outrage
established opinion and speeches that subject the
speaker to punishment.
IV. Conclusion
But all of this is beside the main point. The essence of
the case is that neither you nor your Administration nor
the majority of the faculty you hire wish to permit a
communist revolutionary to teach in your university,
whose land you stole from native Americans and
Mexicans, whose resources you stole from poor and
working people, and which is financed, directly and
indirectly, by money stolen from the working class at
home and your victims around the world. You can not
tolerate even one person expressing the views of poor
and working people because such ideas do indeed, as the
Board's decision states, threaten the very existence of
your institution in its present form. But you cannot
suppress our ideas by repressing us.
Sooner or later the people will take Stanford
University away from you and will use all its vast
resources to serve their needs rather than your sick drive
for personal profit. In fact, they are going to take your
entire empire away from you.
You are part of a dinosaur class, outwardly powerful
and ferocious, but doomed by history because of the
insatiable appetites and irrationality of your system. Go
right ahead. Play your greedy roles to the hilt. And be
remembered in history for what you arc by the hundred
of millions of people you now rule but who will soon
gain the power to control their own destinies.
It is you who will be dismissed, in every sense of that
word. The poor and working people of your empire will
win, no matter what you do.

"I have long been aware that my every appearance in public
drew upon me the hostile attention of certain powerful persons
in finance in San Francisco, and they redoubled their efforts to
| be rid of me. But / had no choice but to go straight ahead. "
Professor Edward Ross (1900), the first in a long line of
Stanford professors to be fined for their political views.
Thank you for your kind and generous permission to
I allow me to "comment in writing" on the decision of
j your management to fire me. You ask me to state my
! reasons why you should not "concur" in this decision,
| which of course you arrived at years before the events of
i early 1971, the subsequent charges, and the kangaroo
j hearing. There is no chance whatsoever that you will not
• concur, no matter what the facts were nor whatever I
j say now. But it may be important for all of us that the
i issues be spelled out clearly.
You should not concur for the following reasons: I
i did not do the things 1 was charged with. Even if I had,
I not one would violate either any law or any Stanford
rule, written or unwritten. The university needs to have,
and sooner or later will have, teachers saying the same
thing that 1 did say in the political speeches now
branded as "urging and inciting." By firing me you will
merely further expose yourselves for what you are and
Stanford University for what it is, and you will reap as
you sow.
I. The facts
A. Urging and inciting. As people in the anti-war and
! anti-imperialist movement at Stanford are well aware, I
have always maintained a policy of never advocating
anything I would or could not do myself. In fact, I have
always refrained from even voting in favor of anything I
would or could not do, and hnve strongly urged
everybody in public meetings to adopt this as a matter
of principle. (Dennis Hayes can vouch for this.)
An examination of the four charges will show how
grossly the Administration and the Board has
| misrepresented to you and the public the facts of this
case.
B. The Lodge Incident. After a professor is
unanimously acquitted of a charge brought by the
Administration, and after it has been conclusively
proven that the Administration's witnesses were
: presenting false testimony (including testimony by a
I member of the Administration), what would we expect
| from the Board serving as the judge and jury? Might they
j not discuss the seriousness of bringing false charges and
; warn of the dangers of political repression? Of course
| not. This Board reveals itself for what it is in these
i words: Franklin "describes the disruption at the Lodge
I speech as too weak, and clcarly indicates his own
: preference for more violent actions. This combination of
' views has the effect of making incitement almost a way
; of life." (p. 36) Where do they find this "preference for
| more violent actions"? They allude here to my letter to
| Lyman in response to the charge, a letter written ten
I days after the event. So here we have an example of ex
post facto incitement. And what are the "violent
actions" I prefer? What 1 said was this: "The appropriate
response to war criminals is not heckling, but what was
done to them at Nuremberg: they should be locked up
j or executed." So what the Board means by incitement is
clear: Franklin's political views, freely expressed,
I constitute urging and inciting, no matter what the
! circumstances. Despite all their professions to the
I contrary, this is precisely the standard they apply to the
remaining three charges, which are all "urging and
inciting."
c. The White Plaza speech. 1 did not urge and incite an
occupation of the Computation Center. In fact I did not
even mention it, nor did anyone else at the White Plaza
rally.
Subsequent events prove the absurdity of this charge,
if any proof were needed beyond the speech itself.
During the hearing, uncontested evidence, produced by
witnesses for both sides, proved that after the rally, the
following happened: People went from the rally to the
area outside the Computation Center. They stayed

outside for 20-30 minutes. Somebody then entered,
possibly by breaking in. Other people followed. They
walked around inside and conversed with the people
working there. After a while, some of the demonstrators
said explcitly that there had been no discussion of
occupying the building, that people had not thought
they would get inside, and that therefore they should
leave the building and hold a meeting to decide what to
do. The great majority of demonstrators then left the
building, and held a 40-minute meeting out front. It was
at this meeting that they decided to go inside and stay
there until Gamut-H, the S.R.I, amphibious invasion
plan being programmed on the computer in direct
violation of the university policy on research, was
stopped. They made an uncontested decision not to do
any damage and to make a public announcement that
they were committed to this.
This is only one of many examples where the Board,
in direct violation of Paragraph 15a, fails to include any
"express findings upon all disputed matters of fact." To
convict me of these ridiculous charges, they are forced
to pretend that most of the evidence does not exist.
Here and elsewhere, it is not a case of the Board
choosing to believe one Administration witness and to
disbelieve many defense witnesses. Rather they choose
to deny or ignore the very existence of numerous
defense witnesses as well as exculpatory evidence
presented by Administration witnesses.
D. The third charge. Many hundreds of pages of
testimony, hundred of photographs, and a video film all
go to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this is a false

An examination of the four charges will show how
grossly the Administration and the Board has
| misrepresented to you and the public the facts of this
case.
B. The Lodge Incident. After a professor is
unanimously acquitted of a charge brought by the
Administration, and after it has been conclusively
proven that the Administration's witnesses were
: presenting false testimony (including testimony by a
I member of the Administration), what would we expect
| from the Board serving as the judge and jury? Might they
j not discuss the seriousness of bringing false charges and
; warn of the dangers of political repression? Of course
| not. This Board reveals itself for what it is in these
i words: Franklin "describes the disruption at the Lodge
I speech as too weak, and clcarly indicates his own
: preference for more violent actions. This combination of
' views has the effect of making incitement almost a way
; of life." (p. 36) Where do they find this "preference for
| more violent actions"? They allude here to my letter to
| Lyman in response to the charge, a letter written ten
I days after the event. So here we have an example of ex
post facto incitement. And what are the "violent
actions" I prefer? What 1 said was this: "The appropriate
response to war criminals is not heckling, but what was
done to them at Nuremberg: they should be locked up
j or executed." So what the Board means by incitement is
clear: Franklin's political views, freely expressed,
I constitute urging and inciting, no matter what the
! circumstances. Despite all their professions to the
I contrary, this is precisely the standard they apply to the
remaining three charges, which are all "urging and
inciting."
c. The White Plaza speech. 1 did not urge and incite an
occupation of the Computation Center. In fact I did not
even mention it, nor did anyone else at the White Plaza
rally.
Subsequent events prove the absurdity of this charge,
if any proof were needed beyond the speech itself.
During the hearing, uncontested evidence, produced by
witnesses for both sides, proved that after the rally, the
following happened: People went from the rally to the
area outside the Computation Center. They stayed

outside for 20-30 minutes. Somebody then entered,
possibly by breaking in. Other people followed. They
walked around inside and conversed with the people
working there. After a while, some of the demonstrators
said explcitly that there had been no discussion of
occupying the building, that people had not thought
they would get inside, and that therefore they should
leave the building and hold a meeting to decide what to
do. The great majority of demonstrators then left the
building, and held a 40-minute meeting out front. It was
at this meeting that they decided to go inside and stay
there until Gamut-H, the S.R.I, amphibious invasion
plan being programmed on the computer in direct
violation of the university policy on research, was
stopped. They made an uncontested decision not to do
any damage and to make a public announcement that
they were committed to this.
This is only one of many examples where the Board,
in direct violation of Paragraph 15a, fails to include any
"express findings upon all disputed matters of fact." To
convict me of these ridiculous charges, they are forced
to pretend that most of the evidence does not exist.
Here and elsewhere, it is not a case of the Board
choosing to believe one Administration witness and to
disbelieve many defense witnesses. Rather they choose
to deny or ignore the very existence of numerous
defense witnesses as well as exculpatory evidence
presented by Administration witnesses.
D. The third charge. Many hundreds of pages of
testimony, hundred of photographs, and a video film all
go to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this is a false
charge. What I did do was to attempt to get faculty
observers to stay on the scene, and to attempt to
convince the police not to attack the people. There is no
other explanation of my behavior that makes any sense,
as two of the Administration's key witnesses (Broholm
and Moses) acknowledged under cross examination. As
many witnesses, including several official faculty
observers, attested, I put myself in physical jeopardy in
order to try to prevent violence, the only violence that
did in fact occur, the violence of the police against
unarmed, peaceful, lawful demonstrators.
E. The Old Union speech. There was not a single
witness on either side who testified that I urged and
incited, or even mentioned, any unlawful, violent, or
prohibited conduct in my speeches that night. The entire
case here rests on an implied causal relation between
these speeches and subsequent acts of violence. The
Administration was permitted, over our repeated
strenuous objections, to present evidence attempting to
prove this causal relation. But when our turn came, we
were not allowed by the Board to present our side of
this key question. We did, however, make a formal offer
of proof, which was noted by the Board. We offered to
prove that the fight which occurred shortly after the
rally broke up began when a group of right-wing
students physically attacked, without provocation, a
group of people who had been at the rally. We also
offered to prove that the shooting which occurred later
that evening was probably done by a member of the
Santa Clara County Sheriffs Department. The Board's
behavior here, neither allowing us to present our side of
the case nor accepting as proven what we offered to
show, outrages all notions of due process and judicial
fairness.
11. Violations of what?
A. The law. If I did indeed urge and incite violent
acts, this violates California Law. So I hereby urge and
incite you to have this brought to criminal court, where
we would at least be protected by subpoena, perjury
laws, and legal precedent. But of course even the
Administration has now quietly dropped its claims that
anything I did or said was unlawful. There is now tacit
acknowledgement that the First Amendment docs not
apply at Stanford.
B. Stanford's rules, policies, and regulations, written
and unwritten.
1. The Comp Center incident in relation to the speech
in White Plaza. As we show clcarly in the final brief, the
demonstration at the Comp. Center itself did not expose

any participant to Stanford prosecution under the Policy
on Campus Disruption or anything else. That is why
none of the demonstrators was ever prosecuted by the
SJC, although their identity was well known and proven
in photographs. (In the one case that was brought, two
people were acquitted of assaulting a photographer
inside the Comp. Center. Their participation in the
•demonstration, which they freely admitted, was not at
issue, and the SJC found no basis for prosecuting them
for this.) So we have the strange case of someone being
prosecuted for "urging and inciting" an action, which he
never mentioned, and which, when it occurred, was not
liable to University prosecution.
2. Outside the Comp. Center. Here the case is even
clearer. The University Prosecutor himself stated flatly
that a person who did refuse to disperse would be
committing "no violation of any University regulation"
and would not be subject to "any disciplinary action."
(pp. 2645-2646). So even if I did what 1 have been
falsely charged with doing I would be merely urging and
inciting conduct which is permitted.
3. Here we have the ultimate absurdity. Not only are
we not told what rules would be violated by conduct
that I "urged and incited," we still do not know what
conduct it is that I "urged and incited."
111. The penalty.
There is no precedent for any of this. How then can
firings be justified? Further, no warning was ever given,
though I have been making speeches like this for years.
You can't have it both ways. Either this is a first offense,
which then would hardly justify firing, or else I have
been doing the same thing before, without either
prosecution or warning, and therefore was led to believe
(as I did) that such speeches violated no rules. Of course
I knew, as we all do, that such speeches and behavior
(even speaking at movement rallies) were considered
outrageous by you, the past and present Presidents, and
most of the faculty, who hooted and booed me down
when I attempted to present these ideas to them in an
Academic Council meeting a few years ago. But there is
supposed to be, according to your professed ideals, a
vast difference b'etween speeches that outrage
established opinion and speeches that subject the
speaker to punishment.
IV. Conclusion
But all of this is beside the main point. The essence of
the case is that neither you nor your Administration nor
the majority of the faculty you hire wish to permit a
communist revolutionary to teach in your university,
whose land you stole from native Americans and
Mexicans, whose resources you stole from poor and
working people, and which is financed, directly and
indirectly, by money stolen from the working class at
home and your victims around the world. You can not
tolerate even one person expressing the views of poor
and working people because such ideas do indeed, as the
Board's decision states, threaten the very existence of
your institution in its present form. But you cannot
suppress our ideas by repressing us.
Sooner or later the people will take Stanford
University away from you and will use all its vast
resources to serve their needs rather than your sick drive
for personal profit. In fact, they are going to take your
entire empire away from you.
You are part of a dinosaur class, outwardly powerful
and ferocious, but doomed by history because of the
insatiable appetites and irrationality of your system. Go
right ahead. Play your greedy roles to the hilt. And be
remembered in history for what you arc by the hundred
of millions of people you now rule but who will soon
gain the power to control their own destinies.
It is you who will be dismissed, in every sense of that
word. The poor and working people of your empire will
win, no matter what you do.

"I have long been aware that my every appearance in public

in finance in San Francisco, and they redoubled their efforts to

Professor Edward Ross (1900), the first in a long line of
Stanford professors to be fined for their political views.
Thank you for your kind and generous permission to
I allow me to "comment in writing" on the decision of
j your management to fire me. You ask me to state my
! reasons why you should not "concur" in this decision,
| which of course you arrived at years before the events of
i early 1971, the subsequent charges, and the kangaroo
j hearing. There is no chance whatsoever that you will not
• concur, no matter what the facts were nor whatever I
j say now. But it may be important for all of us that the
i issues be spelled out clearly.
You should not concur for the following reasons: I
i did not do the things 1 was charged with. Even if I had,
I not one would violate either any law or any Stanford
rule, written or unwritten. The university needs to have,
and sooner or later will have, teachers saying the same
thing that 1 did say in the political speeches now
branded as "urging and inciting." By firing me you will
merely further expose yourselves for what you are and
Stanford University for what it is, and you will reap as
you sow.
I. The facts
A. Urging and inciting. As people in the anti-war and
! anti-imperialist movement at Stanford are well aware, I
have always maintained a policy of never advocating
anything I would or could not do myself. In fact, I have
always refrained from even voting in favor of anything I
would or could not do, and hnve strongly urged
everybody in public meetings to adopt this as a matter
of principle. (Dennis Hayes can vouch for this.)
An examination of the four charges will show how
grossly the Administration and the Board has

working people, and which is financed, directly and
indirectly, by money stolen from the working class at
home and your victims around the world. You can not
tolerate even one person expressing the views of poor
and working people because such ideas do indeed, as the
Board's decision states, threaten the very existence of
your institution in its present form. But you cannot
suppress our ideas by repressing us.
Sooner or later the people will take Stanford
University away from you and will use all its vast
resources to serve their needs rather than your sick drive
for personal profit. In fact, they are going to take your
entire empire away from you.
You are part of a dinosaur class, outwardly powerful

insatiable appetites and irrationality of your system. Go
right ahead. Play your greedy roles to the hilt. And be
remembered in history for what you arc by the hundred

gain the power to control their own destinies.
It is you who will be dismissed, in every sense of that

"I have long been aware that my every appearance in public
drew upon me the hostile attention of certain powerful persons
in finance in San Francisco, and they redoubled their efforts to
| be rid of me. But / had no choice but to go straight ahead. "
Professor Edward Ross (1900), the first in a long line of
Stanford professors to be fined for their political views.
Thank you for your kind and generous permission to
I allow me to "comment in writing" on the decision of
j your management to fire me. You ask me to state my
! reasons why you should not "concur" in this decision,
| which of course you arrived at years before the events of
i early 1971, the subsequent charges, and the kangaroo
j hearing. There is no chance whatsoever that you will not
• concur, no matter what the facts were nor whatever I
j say now. But it may be important for all of us that the
i issues be spelled out clearly.
You should not concur for the following reasons: I
i did not do the things 1 was charged with. Even if I had,
I not one would violate either any law or any Stanford
rule, written or unwritten. The university needs to have,
and sooner or later will have, teachers saying the same
thing that 1 did say in the political speeches now
branded as "urging and inciting." By firing me you will
merely further expose yourselves for what you are and
Stanford University for what it is, and you will reap as
you sow.
I. The facts
A. Urging and inciting. As people in the anti-war and
! anti-imperialist movement at Stanford are well aware, I
have always maintained a policy of never advocating
anything I would or could not do myself. In fact, I have
always refrained from even voting in favor of anything I
would or could not do, and hnve strongly urged
everybody in public meetings to adopt this as a matter
of principle. (Dennis Hayes can vouch for this.)
An examination of the four charges will show how
grossly the Administration and the Board has
| misrepresented to you and the public the facts of this
case.
B. The Lodge Incident. After a professor is
unanimously acquitted of a charge brought by the
Administration, and after it has been conclusively
proven that the Administration's witnesses were
: presenting false testimony (including testimony by a
I member of the Administration), what would we expect
| from the Board serving as the judge and jury? Might they
j not discuss the seriousness of bringing false charges and
; warn of the dangers of political repression? Of course
| not. This Board reveals itself for what it is in these
i words: Franklin "describes the disruption at the Lodge
I speech as too weak, and clcarly indicates his own
: preference for more violent actions. This combination of
' views has the effect of making incitement almost a way
; of life." (p. 36) Where do they find this "preference for
| more violent actions"? They allude here to my letter to
| Lyman in response to the charge, a letter written ten
I days after the event. So here we have an example of ex
post facto incitement. And what are the "violent
actions" I prefer? What 1 said was this: "The appropriate
response to war criminals is not heckling, but what was
done to them at Nuremberg: they should be locked up
j or executed." So what the Board means by incitement is
clear: Franklin's political views, freely expressed,
I constitute urging and inciting, no matter what the
! circumstances. Despite all their professions to the
I contrary, this is precisely the standard they apply to the
remaining three charges, which are all "urging and
inciting."
c. The White Plaza speech. 1 did not urge and incite an
occupation of the Computation Center. In fact I did not
even mention it, nor did anyone else at the White Plaza
rally.
Subsequent events prove the absurdity of this charge,
if any proof were needed beyond the speech itself.
During the hearing, uncontested evidence, produced by
witnesses for both sides, proved that after the rally, the
following happened: People went from the rally to the
area outside the Computation Center. They stayed

outside for 20-30 minutes. Somebody then entered,
possibly by breaking in. Other people followed. They
walked around inside and conversed with the people
working there. After a while, some of the demonstrators
said explcitly that there had been no discussion of
occupying the building, that people had not thought
they would get inside, and that therefore they should
leave the building and hold a meeting to decide what to
do. The great majority of demonstrators then left the
building, and held a 40-minute meeting out front. It was
at this meeting that they decided to go inside and stay
there until Gamut-H, the S.R.I, amphibious invasion
plan being programmed on the computer in direct
violation of the university policy on research, was
stopped. They made an uncontested decision not to do
any damage and to make a public announcement that
they were committed to this.
This is only one of many examples where the Board,
in direct violation of Paragraph 15a, fails to include any
"express findings upon all disputed matters of fact." To
convict me of these ridiculous charges, they are forced
to pretend that most of the evidence does not exist.
Here and elsewhere, it is not a case of the Board
choosing to believe one Administration witness and to
disbelieve many defense witnesses. Rather they choose
to deny or ignore the very existence of numerous
defense witnesses as well as exculpatory evidence
presented by Administration witnesses.
D. The third charge. Many hundreds of pages of
testimony, hundred of photographs, and a video film all
go to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this is a false
charge. What I did do was to attempt to get faculty
observers to stay on the scene, and to attempt to
convince the police not to attack the people. There is no
other explanation of my behavior that makes any sense,
as two of the Administration's key witnesses (Broholm
and Moses) acknowledged under cross examination. As
many witnesses, including several official faculty
observers, attested, I put myself in physical jeopardy in
order to try to prevent violence, the only violence that
did in fact occur, the violence of the police against
unarmed, peaceful, lawful demonstrators.
E. The Old Union speech. There was not a single
witness on either side who testified that I urged and
incited, or even mentioned, any unlawful, violent, or
prohibited conduct in my speeches that night. The entire
case here rests on an implied causal relation between
these speeches and subsequent acts of violence. The
Administration was permitted, over our repeated
strenuous objections, to present evidence attempting to
prove this causal relation. But when our turn came, we
were not allowed by the Board to present our side of
this key question. We did, however, make a formal offer
of proof, which was noted by the Board. We offered to
prove that the fight which occurred shortly after the
rally broke up began when a group of right-wing
students physically attacked, without provocation, a
group of people who had been at the rally. We also
offered to prove that the shooting which occurred later
that evening was probably done by a member of the
Santa Clara County Sheriffs Department. The Board's
behavior here, neither allowing us to present our side of
the case nor accepting as proven what we offered to
show, outrages all notions of due process and judicial
fairness.
11. Violations of what?
A. The law. If I did indeed urge and incite violent
acts, this violates California Law. So I hereby urge and
incite you to have this brought to criminal court, where
we would at least be protected by subpoena, perjury
laws, and legal precedent. But of course even the
Administration has now quietly dropped its claims that
anything I did or said was unlawful. There is now tacit
acknowledgement that the First Amendment docs not
apply at Stanford.
B. Stanford's rules, policies, and regulations, written
and unwritten.
1. The Comp Center incident in relation to the speech
in White Plaza. As we show clcarly in the final brief, the
demonstration at the Comp. Center itself did not expose

any participant to Stanford prosecution under the Policy
on Campus Disruption or anything else. That is why
none of the demonstrators was ever prosecuted by the
SJC, although their identity was well known and proven
in photographs. (In the one case that was brought, two
people were acquitted of assaulting a photographer
inside the Comp. Center. Their participation in the
•demonstration, which they freely admitted, was not at
issue, and the SJC found no basis for prosecuting them
for this.) So we have the strange case of someone being
prosecuted for "urging and inciting" an action, which he
never mentioned, and which, when it occurred, was not
liable to University prosecution.
2. Outside the Comp. Center. Here the case is even
clearer. The University Prosecutor himself stated flatly
that a person who did refuse to disperse would be
committing "no violation of any University regulation"
and would not be subject to "any disciplinary action."
(pp. 2645-2646). So even if I did what 1 have been
falsely charged with doing I would be merely urging and
inciting conduct which is permitted.
3. Here we have the ultimate absurdity. Not only are
we not told what rules would be violated by conduct
that I "urged and incited," we still do not know what
conduct it is that I "urged and incited."
111. The penalty.
There is no precedent for any of this. How then can
firings be justified? Further, no warning was ever given,
though I have been making speeches like this for years.
You can't have it both ways. Either this is a first offense,
which then would hardly justify firing, or else I have
been doing the same thing before, without either
prosecution or warning, and therefore was led to believe
(as I did) that such speeches violated no rules. Of course
I knew, as we all do, that such speeches and behavior
(even speaking at movement rallies) were considered
outrageous by you, the past and present Presidents, and
most of the faculty, who hooted and booed me down
when I attempted to present these ideas to them in an
Academic Council meeting a few years ago. But there is
supposed to be, according to your professed ideals, a
vast difference b'etween speeches that outrage
established opinion and speeches that subject the
speaker to punishment.
IV. Conclusion
But all of this is beside the main point. The essence of
the case is that neither you nor your Administration nor
the majority of the faculty you hire wish to permit a
communist revolutionary to teach in your university,
whose land you stole from native Americans and
Mexicans, whose resources you stole from poor and
working people, and which is financed, directly and
indirectly, by money stolen from the working class at
home and your victims around the world. You can not
tolerate even one person expressing the views of poor
and working people because such ideas do indeed, as the
Board's decision states, threaten the very existence of
your institution in its present form. But you cannot

Sooner or later the people will take Stanford

11. Violations of what?
A. The law. If I did indeed urge and incite violent
acts, this violates California Law. So I hereby urge and
incite you to have this brought to criminal court, where
we would at least be protected by subpoena, perjury
laws, and legal precedent. But of course even the
Administration has now quietly dropped its claims that
anything I did or said was unlawful. There is now tacit
acknowledgement that the First Amendment docs not
apply at Stanford.
B. Stanford's rules, policies, and regulations, written
and unwritten.
1. The Comp Center incident in relation to the speech
in White Plaza. As we show clcarly in the final brief, the
demonstration at the Comp. Center itself did not expose

any participant to Stanford prosecution under the Policy
on Campus Disruption or anything else. That is why
none of the demonstrators was ever prosecuted by the
SJC, although their identity was well known and proven
in photographs. (In the one case that was brought, two
people were acquitted of assaulting a photographer
inside the Comp. Center. Their participation in the
•demonstration, which they freely admitted, was not at
issue, and the SJC found no basis for prosecuting them
for this.) So we have the strange case of someone being
prosecuted for "urging and inciting" an action, which he
never mentioned, and which, when it occurred, was not
liable to University prosecution.
2. Outside the Comp. Center. Here the case is even
clearer. The University Prosecutor himself stated flatly
that a person who did refuse to disperse would be
committing "no violation of any University regulation"
and would not be subject to "any disciplinary action."
(pp. 2645-2646). So even if I did what 1 have been
falsely charged with doing I would be merely urging and
inciting conduct which is permitted.
3. Here we have the ultimate absurdity. Not only are
we not told what rules would be violated by conduct
that I "urged and incited," we still do not know what
conduct it is that I "urged and incited."
111. The penalty.
There is no precedent for any of this. How then can
firings be justified? Further, no warning was ever given,
though I have been making speeches like this for years.
You can't have it both ways. Either this is a first offense,
which then would hardly justify firing, or else I have
been doing the same thing before, without either
prosecution or warning, and therefore was led to believe
(as I did) that such speeches violated no rules. Of course
I knew, as we all do, that such speeches and behavior
(even speaking at movement rallies) were considered
outrageous by you, the past and present Presidents, and
most of the faculty, who hooted and booed me down
when I attempted to present these ideas to them in an
Academic Council meeting a few years ago. But there is
supposed to be, according to your professed ideals, a
vast difference b'etween speeches that outrage
established opinion and speeches that subject the
speaker to punishment.
IV. Conclusion
But all of this is beside the main point. The essence of
the case is that neither you nor your Administration nor
the majority of the faculty you hire wish to permit a
communist revolutionary to teach in your university,
whose land you stole from native Americans and
Mexicans, whose resources you stole from poor and
working people, and which is financed, directly and
indirectly, by money stolen from the working class at
home and your victims around the world. You can not
tolerate even one person expressing the views of poor
and working people because such ideas do indeed, as the
Board's decision states, threaten the very existence of
your institution in its present form. But you cannot
suppress our ideas by repressing us.
Sooner or later the people will take Stanford
University away from you and will use all its vast
resources to serve their needs rather than your sick drive
for personal profit. In fact, they are going to take your
entire empire away from you.
You are part of a dinosaur class, outwardly powerful
and ferocious, but doomed by history because of the
insatiable appetites and irrationality of your system. Go
right ahead. Play your greedy roles to the hilt. And be
remembered in history for what you arc by the hundred
of millions of people you now rule but who will soon
gain the power to control their own destinies.
It is you who will be dismissed, in every sense of that
word. The poor and working people of your empire will
win, no matter what you do.
POWER TO THE PEOPLE!
