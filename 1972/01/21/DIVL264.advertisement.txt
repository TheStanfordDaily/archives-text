BY WALT DISNEY
NEWMAN S LAUGHOGRAMS
(1925)
Disney's very first cartoons, never
before seen in Berkeley and only
' recently discovered. These are political
cartoons which comment on the evils
of liberalism and the menace of
creeping socialism. Disney himself
appears in this uproarious combination
of live action and animation.
I THE MICKEY MOUSE
TRILOGY (1932-1934)
Next to steamboat Willie, these are
k unquestionably the classic Mickey
I cartoons: MICHEY AND SIMON
■ LEGREE, GOLDRUSH MICKEY,
& ROBINSON CRUSOE MICKEY. Each
one illustrates a part of the
development of the Mouse character
Ithat we all have come to know and
love as the years rolled by.
DONALD DUCK
THE MECHANIC (1933)
One of the very first that starred the
mad anarchist in this one, Donald,
Mickey, and Goofy encounter the
villainous Black Pete.
— DONALD DUCK
THE REPAIRMAN (1934)
Here Donald is on his own, trying to
cope with his fiery temper and the
machine age.
MICKEY'S GALA PREMIERE
(1933)
Disney's salute to Hollywood's
i immortals. To the premiere of a new
Mickey Mouse cartoon at Grand
Grauman's theater come animated
characterizations of the stars: Wallace
j Beery, Clark Gable, the Marx Brothers,
I Marie Dressier, and Many more.
ALICE'S EGG PLANT (1927)
! Don't miss this one! A rare gem that is
Disney's paranoid vision of
! communism in the trade unions as
I fomented by the I.W.W. High Camp.
j CHRISTMAS TOYLAND (1929)
! A beautiful, sentimental vision that
1 was the forrunner of so many musical
cartoons.
BY OTHER
ANIMATORS:
MOVIE MAD (1930)
I This was a brilliant work by V.B.
| Iwerkers, a pioneer animator who later
j created Disney's WIND IN THE
! WILLOWS. This one features Charlie
: Chaplin, Laurel & Hardy, and Flip The
| Frog.
CONQUEST OF THE POLE
(1909)
| George Melies incredible, surreal bag of
i magic and fantasy,
THE HASHER S DELIRIUM
(1912)
An original Emile Cohl primitive on
the evils of marijuana and opium.
MARINE FANTASY (1925)
An early experiment in the beauties of
hand-tinted frames. Made in the famed
Pathe-Freres studios. An amazing
technical triumph which captures the
> perfection of an underwater world.

BY WALT DISNEY
NEWMAN S LAUGHOGRAMS
(1925)
Disney's very first cartoons, never
before seen in Berkeley and only
' recently discovered. These are political
cartoons which comment on the evils
of liberalism and the menace of
creeping socialism. Disney himself
appears in this uproarious combination
of live action and animation.
I THE MICKEY MOUSE
TRILOGY (1932-1934)
Next to steamboat Willie, these are
k unquestionably the classic Mickey
I cartoons: MICHEY AND SIMON
■ LEGREE, GOLDRUSH MICKEY,
& ROBINSON CRUSOE MICKEY. Each
one illustrates a part of the
development of the Mouse character
Ithat we all have come to know and
love as the years rolled by.
DONALD DUCK
THE MECHANIC (1933)
One of the very first that starred the
mad anarchist in this one, Donald,
Mickey, and Goofy encounter the
villainous Black Pete.
— DONALD DUCK
THE REPAIRMAN (1934)
Here Donald is on his own, trying to
cope with his fiery temper and the
machine age.
MICKEY'S GALA PREMIERE
(1933)
Disney's salute to Hollywood's
i immortals. To the premiere of a new
Mickey Mouse cartoon at Grand
Grauman's theater come animated
characterizations of the stars: Wallace
j Beery, Clark Gable, the Marx Brothers,
I Marie Dressier, and Many more.
ALICE'S EGG PLANT (1927)
! Don't miss this one! A rare gem that is
Disney's paranoid vision of
! communism in the trade unions as
I fomented by the I.W.W. High Camp.
j CHRISTMAS TOYLAND (1929)
! A beautiful, sentimental vision that
1 was the forrunner of so many musical
cartoons.
