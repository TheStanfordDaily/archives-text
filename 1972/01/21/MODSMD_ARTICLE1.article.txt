# Harris Speaks At Rally Tonight
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Pacifist and former ASSU president
David Harris and Venceremos central
committee chairman Aaron
Mangianello will speak on the Franklin
decision tonight at 8 p.m. in Memorial
Church. At 3 p.m. this afternoon, an
open meeting will be held with Trustee
Denis Hayes in Cubberley Auditorium.
Stanford Rehabilitation Movement
(SRM) events chairman Kwonping Ho
said last night that the doors for the
Harris speech will open at about 7:30
p.m. and that a folksinging group will
perform as people take their seats.
The Beta Chi community will then
present its satirical play about
Stanford, "The Incredible Dr. L,"
after which Mangianello and then
Harris will speak. An open mike and
discussion will follow.
There had been some speculation
Franklin would speak.
But the SRM, an ad hoc coalition
including members of Venceremos, the
Faculty Political Action Group, and
the Association of Young Crows,
which is sponsoring the meeting,
signed a contract with the Dean of the
Chapel explicitly stating Franklin

would not speak. The Venceremos
Central Committee also decided that
Mangianello should speak, rather than
Franklin.
Yesterday, however, Acting Dean
of the Chapel Bradford Abernethy said
that fears which had originally made
him ban Franklin from speaking at the
Church had turned out to be
groundless.
Abernethey said he originally felt
that, since Franklin was banned from
the campus by a court injunction, his
speaking in the Church might
"provoke a police confrontation with
disastrous effects." He reached his
decision to bar Franklin after
consultation with the two advisory
boards to the Dean of the Chapel.
Abernathy said that after
consulting police, he felt this was now
a remote possibility. But when asked if
this meant Franklin was free to speak
at the meeting, he would only say,
"knowing this information, if I had
made the decision today it might have
been different."
Abemathy is Dean of the Chapel
for just this quarter. He is on leave
from Rutgers where he is chaplain.

Today at 3 p.m., the community
meeting originally planned to be with
the full Board of Trustees will go on
with only Hayes. Faculty Political
Action Group member Lisa Giraud
said last night that the former ASSU
President was the only Trustee to
accept an invitation to attend.
Presentations Set
She said there would be four short
presentations to Hayes on the Franklin
issue: a freshman speaking for the
SRM; possibly Alan Dershowitz on
behalf of the ACLU which intervened
amicus curiae in the case (Dershowitz
is a visiting professor from the Harvard
Law School); History Professor
Charles Drekmeier on behalf of FPAG;
and Tim Burke on behalf of United
Stanford Employees.
Hayes himself will then make a
short statement after which there will
be an open mike. Sophomore and
Young Crow Peter Knutson, who at
one time interviewed Trustee Ernest
Arbuckle, will supposedly represent
Arbuckle's views at the meeting.
"His views probably represent a
very typical Trustee position," Giraud
said last night.

Tomorrow's planned confrontation
with the Trustees will take place at 9
a.m. at 600 California Avenue in San
Francisco, when the Board meets to
consider the Franklin dismissal.
Ho said last night that there would
be car pools leaving from Tresidder at
7 a.m.
Letters Written
In other events concerning the
Franklin case, two undergraduates on
the Trustees' Academic Affairs
Committee have written the Board
that "the interests of the University
will be irreparably damaged if
Professor Franklin's dismissal is upheld
by the Board"
In a letter dated January 19,
Juniors Elaine Wong and Scott Burke
said that Franklin's dismissal would be
damaging because it denied students
"the opportunity to evaluate the single
most powerful political force in the
world" and would "limit the free
speech of our professors."
The two students also cited Law
Association arguments that the
Advisory Board was biased in
evaluating conflicting testimony, had
adopted "quasi-legal standards
outrageous to the first amendment,"
and "succumbed to the temptation to
determine a political defendant's
punishment according to the
dangerousness of his beliefs, rather
than his actions."
Finally, Wong and Burke criticized
the Board for failing to discuss the
matter with the community in order
to "make you more totally aware of
existing conditions on the campus."
Franklin also sent a letter to the
Trustees saying "I did not do the
things I was charged with. Even if I
had, not one would violate any law or
Stanford rule, written or unwritten."
Franklin also called his Advisory
Board hearing a "kangaroo hearing."

Franklin then examined the charges
one by one and argued his innocence.
He concluded, "You are part of a
dinosaur class, outwardly powerful
and ferocious, but doomed by history
because of the insatiable appetites and
irrationality of your system ."

In other events concerning the
Franklin case, two undergraduates on
the Trustees' Academic Affairs
Committee have written the Board
that "the interests of the University
will be irreparably damaged if
Professor Franklin's dismissal is upheld
by the Board"
In a letter dated January 19,
Juniors Elaine Wong and Scott Burke
said that Franklin's dismissal would be
damaging because it denied students
"the opportunity to evaluate the single
most powerful political force in the
world" and would "limit the free
speech of our professors."
The two students also cited Law
Association arguments that the
Advisory Board was biased in
evaluating conflicting testimony, had
adopted "quasi-legal standards
outrageous to the first amendment,"
and "succumbed to the temptation to
determine a political defendant's
punishment according to the
dangerousness of his beliefs, rather
than his actions."
Finally, Wong and Burke criticized
the Board for failing to discuss the
matter with the community in order
to "make you more totally aware of
existing conditions on the campus."
Franklin also sent a letter to the
Trustees saying "I did not do the
things I was charged with. Even if I
had, not one would violate any law or
Stanford rule, written or unwritten."
Franklin also called his Advisory
Board hearing a "kangaroo hearing."

said they "fully agree" that the

Pacifist and former ASSU president
David Harris and Venceremos central
committee chairman Aaron
Mangianello will speak on the Franklin
decision tonight at 8 p.m. in Memorial
Church. At 3 p.m. this afternoon, an
open meeting will be held with Trustee
Denis Hayes in Cubberley Auditorium.
Stanford Rehabilitation Movement
(SRM) events chairman Kwonping Ho
said last night that the doors for the
Harris speech will open at about 7:30
p.m. and that a folksinging group will
perform as people take their seats.
The Beta Chi community will then
present its satirical play about
Stanford, "The Incredible Dr. L,"
after which Mangianello and then
Harris will speak. An open mike and
discussion will follow.
There had been some speculation
Franklin would speak.
But the SRM, an ad hoc coalition
including members of Venceremos, the
Faculty Political Action Group, and
the Association of Young Crows,
which is sponsoring the meeting,
signed a contract with the Dean of the
Chapel explicitly stating Franklin

would not speak. The Venceremos
Central Committee also decided that
Mangianello should speak, rather than
Franklin.
Yesterday, however, Acting Dean
of the Chapel Bradford Abernethy said
that fears which had originally made
him ban Franklin from speaking at the
Church had turned out to be
groundless.
Abernethey said he originally felt
that, since Franklin was banned from
the campus by a court injunction, his
speaking in the Church might
"provoke a police confrontation with
disastrous effects." He reached his
decision to bar Franklin after
consultation with the two advisory
boards to the Dean of the Chapel.
Abernathy said that after
consulting police, he felt this was now
a remote possibility. But when asked if
this meant Franklin was free to speak
at the meeting, he would only say,
"knowing this information, if I had
made the decision today it might have
been different."
Abemathy is Dean of the Chapel
for just this quarter. He is on leave
from Rutgers where he is chaplain.

Today at 3 p.m., the community
meeting originally planned to be with
the full Board of Trustees will go on
with only Hayes. Faculty Political
Action Group member Lisa Giraud
said last night that the former ASSU
President was the only Trustee to
accept an invitation to attend.
Presentations Set
She said there would be four short
presentations to Hayes on the Franklin
issue: a freshman speaking for the
SRM; possibly Alan Dershowitz on
behalf of the ACLU which intervened
amicus curiae in the case (Dershowitz
is a visiting professor from the Harvard
Law School); History Professor
Charles Drekmeier on behalf of FPAG;
and Tim Burke on behalf of United
Stanford Employees.
Hayes himself will then make a
short statement after which there will
be an open mike. Sophomore and
Young Crow Peter Knutson, who at
one time interviewed Trustee Ernest
Arbuckle, will supposedly represent
Arbuckle's views at the meeting.
"His views probably represent a
very typical Trustee position," Giraud
said last night.

perform as people take their seats.
The Beta Chi community will then
present its satirical play about
Stanford, "The Incredible Dr. L,"
after which Mangianello and then
Harris will speak. An open mike and
discussion will follow.
There had been some speculation
Franklin would speak.
But the SRM, an ad hoc coalition
including members of Venceremos, the
Faculty Political Action Group, and
the Association of Young Crows,
which is sponsoring the meeting,
signed a contract with the Dean of the
Chapel explicitly stating Franklin

would not speak. The Venceremos
Central Committee also decided that
Mangianello should speak, rather than
Franklin.
Yesterday, however, Acting Dean
of the Chapel Bradford Abernethy said
that fears which had originally made
him ban Franklin from speaking at the
Church had turned out to be
groundless.
Abernethey said he originally felt
that, since Franklin was banned from
the campus by a court injunction, his
speaking in the Church might
"provoke a police confrontation with
disastrous effects." He reached his
decision to bar Franklin after
consultation with the two advisory
boards to the Dean of the Chapel.
Abernathy said that after
consulting police, he felt this was now
a remote possibility. But when asked if
this meant Franklin was free to speak
at the meeting, he would only say,
"knowing this information, if I had
made the decision today it might have
been different."
Abemathy is Dean of the Chapel
for just this quarter. He is on leave
from Rutgers where he is chaplain.

Today at 3 p.m., the community
meeting originally planned to be with
the full Board of Trustees will go on
with only Hayes. Faculty Political
Action Group member Lisa Giraud
said last night that the former ASSU
President was the only Trustee to
accept an invitation to attend.
Presentations Set
She said there would be four short
presentations to Hayes on the Franklin
issue: a freshman speaking for the
SRM; possibly Alan Dershowitz on
behalf of the ACLU which intervened
amicus curiae in the case (Dershowitz
is a visiting professor from the Harvard
Law School); History Professor
Charles Drekmeier on behalf of FPAG;
and Tim Burke on behalf of United
Stanford Employees.
Hayes himself will then make a
short statement after which there will
be an open mike. Sophomore and
Young Crow Peter Knutson, who at
one time interviewed Trustee Ernest
Arbuckle, will supposedly represent
Arbuckle's views at the meeting.
"His views probably represent a
very typical Trustee position," Giraud
said last night.

Tomorrow's planned confrontation
with the Trustees will take place at 9
a.m. at 600 California Avenue in San
Francisco, when the Board meets to
consider the Franklin dismissal.
Ho said last night that there would
be car pools leaving from Tresidder at
7 a.m.
Letters Written
In other events concerning the
Franklin case, two undergraduates on
the Trustees' Academic Affairs
Committee have written the Board
that "the interests of the University
will be irreparably damaged if
Professor Franklin's dismissal is upheld
by the Board"
In a letter dated January 19,
Juniors Elaine Wong and Scott Burke
said that Franklin's dismissal would be
damaging because it denied students
"the opportunity to evaluate the single
most powerful political force in the
world" and would "limit the free
speech of our professors."
The two students also cited Law
Association arguments that the
Advisory Board was biased in
evaluating conflicting testimony, had
adopted "quasi-legal standards
outrageous to the first amendment,"
and "succumbed to the temptation to
determine a political defendant's
punishment according to the
dangerousness of his beliefs, rather
than his actions."
Finally, Wong and Burke criticized
the Board for failing to discuss the
matter with the community in order
to "make you more totally aware of
existing conditions on the campus."
Franklin also sent a letter to the
Trustees saying "I did not do the
things I was charged with. Even if I
had, not one would violate any law or
Stanford rule, written or unwritten."
Franklin also called his Advisory
Board hearing a "kangaroo hearing."
