## Packer Argument--Drivel 
### 
torn burke

I would like to briefly take
issue with Herbert Packer in his
recent attack upon the Law
Association officers for failing to
"think like lawyers" in their
defense of Bruce Franklin.
Mr. Packer's argument against
the idea of Bruce's trial being
"political" seems to involve two
assertions: that Bruce is being
dismissed for specific
wrongdoings, not because of his
political persuasion; and that trials
aren't political as long as laws are
applied equitably, not selectively,
and there was 110 such selection at
work in the Franklin case.
In arguing the first point, Mr.
Packer resorts to an old law
school scheme of citing
"hypothetical" fact situations
when he would rather not discuss
the actual case at hand.
Specifically, he devises two
rather bizarre acts that Bruce (or
somebody) might have
committed, says obviously a
person should be prosecuted for
committing either of these
mythical actions, and then
blithely concludes that his
imaginary situations "do not in
any way change the actual case
against Mr. Franklin."
In case Mr. Packer has not
noticed, in either of his imaginary j
fact situations Bruce would have ;
been guilty of a criminal act. Even
in the farthest reaches of the :
University's case against him, and
despite the appearance of
criminality of some of the charges
(e.g. inciting to riot), Bruce was
never accused of actual criminal
activity.
We can be fairly confident
that had there been any
possibility of criminal charges |
being brought, the university and
the sheriff's department would
have rushed to the Santa Clara
County Courthouse to file them, j
(Can't we safely assume that Lt. j
Tamm would have noticed if
Bruce, who was standing right in
front of him at the Cnip Center, i
had been committing a crime?)
Now it is possible that in j
Mr. Packer's view a person's '
culpability is independent of I
whether that person has
committed a crime or not. That \
the Stanford Law School tends to
breed such ideas can be inferred j
from the opinions and actions of j

one of our more notorious
alumni, William Rehnquist. But I
do not think this is any
justification for Mr. Packer's
attempting to lead the more
rational elements of the university
into such specious and dangerous
thinking.
However, Mr. Packer reserves
his most dubious arguments for
his peroration. In an apparent
attempt to demonstrate that,
unlike the Stalin purges (which he
evidently does regard as political
prosecutions), American laws are
always equitably applied, Mr.
Packer rhetorically asks whether
we would also label the
prosecution of right-wing assassins
as political trials; he cites two
such prosecutions, evidently to
assure us that, contrary to the
beliefs of the Law Association
officers, the American legal
system continues to function in
all its equitable majesty.
First, Mr. Packer ignores the

fact that in one of his examples,
that of the three Mississippi civil
rights workers, convictions of the
murderers were obtained only for
federal civil rights violations
because state officials refused to
file charges.
But neglecting this oversight on
his part, I would like to ask
whether Mr. Packer does not
consider it peculiar that, while the
New York Black Panther Party is
destroyed because its leaders are
kept in custody for 18 months
only to be acquitted of all
charges, while Bruce Franklin is
dismissed for doing something
that was somehow more than just
speaking but still less than actual
(illegal) incitement, no charges are
even anticipated against the
Chicago police who murdered
Fred Hampton and William
Calley, a convicted murderer,
remains free by presidential order.
If Mr. Packer wishes to
continue maintaining that there

are no political prosecutions in
this country, or that at least Bruce
Franklin's is not one of them, I
would be happy for him to do so.
I expect a rational argument could
be made for such a position.
However, I might suggest that,
in constructing such an argument,
Mr. Packer abandon the muddied,
vacuous drivel that he attempts to
pass off as sound, "lawyerly"
thinking.

one of our more notorious
alumni, William Rehnquist. But I
do not think this is any
justification for Mr. Packer's
attempting to lead the more
rational elements of the university
into such specious and dangerous
thinking.
However, Mr. Packer reserves
his most dubious arguments for
his peroration. In an apparent
attempt to demonstrate that,
unlike the Stalin purges (which he
evidently does regard as political
prosecutions), American laws are
always equitably applied, Mr.
Packer rhetorically asks whether
we would also label the
prosecution of right-wing assassins
as political trials; he cites two
such prosecutions, evidently to
assure us that, contrary to the
beliefs of the Law Association
officers, the American legal
system continues to function in
all its equitable majesty.
First, Mr. Packer ignores the

fact that in one of his examples,
that of the three Mississippi civil
rights workers, convictions of the
murderers were obtained only for
federal civil rights violations
because state officials refused to
file charges.
But neglecting this oversight on
his part, I would like to ask
whether Mr. Packer does not
consider it peculiar that, while the
New York Black Panther Party is
destroyed because its leaders are
kept in custody for 18 months
only to be acquitted of all
charges, while Bruce Franklin is
dismissed for doing something
that was somehow more than just
speaking but still less than actual
(illegal) incitement, no charges are
even anticipated against the
Chicago police who murdered
Fred Hampton and William
Calley, a convicted murderer,
remains free by presidential order.
If Mr. Packer wishes to
continue maintaining that there

are no political prosecutions in
this country, or that at least Bruce
Franklin's is not one of them, I
would be happy for him to do so.
I expect a rational argument could
be made for such a position.
However, I might suggest that,
in constructing such an argument,
Mr. Packer abandon the muddied,
vacuous drivel that he attempts to
pass off as sound, "lawyerly"
thinking.

I would like to briefly take
issue with Herbert Packer in his
recent attack upon the Law
Association officers for failing to
"think like lawyers" in their
defense of Bruce Franklin.
Mr. Packer's argument against
the idea of Bruce's trial being
"political" seems to involve two
assertions: that Bruce is being
dismissed for specific
wrongdoings, not because of his
political persuasion; and that trials
aren't political as long as laws are
applied equitably, not selectively,
and there was 110 such selection at
work in the Franklin case.
In arguing the first point, Mr.
Packer resorts to an old law
school scheme of citing
"hypothetical" fact situations
when he would rather not discuss
the actual case at hand.
Specifically, he devises two
rather bizarre acts that Bruce (or
somebody) might have
committed, says obviously a
person should be prosecuted for
committing either of these
mythical actions, and then
blithely concludes that his
imaginary situations "do not in
any way change the actual case
against Mr. Franklin."
In case Mr. Packer has not
noticed, in either of his imaginary j
fact situations Bruce would have ;
been guilty of a criminal act. Even
in the farthest reaches of the :
University's case against him, and
despite the appearance of
criminality of some of the charges
(e.g. inciting to riot), Bruce was
never accused of actual criminal
activity.
We can be fairly confident
that had there been any
possibility of criminal charges |
being brought, the university and
the sheriff's department would
have rushed to the Santa Clara
County Courthouse to file them, j
(Can't we safely assume that Lt. j
Tamm would have noticed if
Bruce, who was standing right in
front of him at the Cnip Center, i
had been committing a crime?)
Now it is possible that in j
Mr. Packer's view a person's '
culpability is independent of I
whether that person has
committed a crime or not. That \
the Stanford Law School tends to
breed such ideas can be inferred j
from the opinions and actions of j

one of our more notorious
