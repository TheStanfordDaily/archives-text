Henderson, N.C., Jan.
13—Henderson is a little dogpatch
town in rural North Carolina,
whose only tourist attraction is its
fortuitous location on Interstate
85, exactly halfway between
Atlanta and New York City.
Henderson's Lake Drive
Restaurant calls itself the "Home
of Fine Foods," but tonight I
think the Fine Foods were on
vacation in nearby Durham. The
dessert menu lists three items,
Home-Baked Pies," "Ice Cream,"
and "Pie Alamode" (sic), which is
really two items, taken one and
two at a time. The post cards near
the checkout counter have homey
sayings like "Every Yankee
Tourist is Worth a Bale of
Cotton .. .And is Easier to Pick!"
This, together with the friendly
motel clerk who did me a great
favor and took my money, the
Confederate flags, the waitress
who could raise the I.Q. of both
North Carolina and Mississippi by
moving to Biloxi, all these things
tell me that I (I all?) am still in
the South.
Grits with your eggs, like it or
not, and smile when you eat
that, Yankee.
Henderson's friendly
atmosphere and fine food stems
not so much from being Southern,
I suspect, as being rural. The fears
that were carefully instilled in me
by friends who heard I was driving
the Southern route to New York
have proven to be, in the main,
ridiculous.
All those stories about the
Mississippi Highway Patrol trailing
you from town to town are
nonsense. I didn't even need the

Confederate flag decal that a
lawyer friend had suggested as a
counter to my New York license
plates. And when my car stalled in
an intersection in Montgomery, I
was praying for some good,
efficient Red-Neck of an Alabama
cop to come and rescue me from
an uncomfortable situation.
I must admit that I'm kind of
glad I am no longer bearded, I am
not black, and my name is not
Greenberg. No point in tempting
the fates.

Jackson, Mississippi was the
strangest town on my route. I
visited a beautiful, modem indoor
shopping center which was totally
integrated, even to the clothing
store mannequins. But when I ate
dinner in a restaurant I witnessed
a display of racial piggism right
out of "In the Heat of the Night."
* * *
The most beautiful country I
have seen so far is Louisiana, with
Mississippi running a close second.
The most monotonous certainly is
Texas, with hundred of miles of
dead-flat cotton fields stretching
between Fort Worth and New
Mexico.

I took a short (6 mile) side trip

in Arizona to visit Meteor Crater,
a tremendous hole in the desert
created 22,000 years ago when
God threw a rock at the Earth.
The circumference of the nearly
circular crater is 3 miles, and I
hiked around the rim to get some
exercise. After one hundred feet I
remembered that rattlesnakes like
to hid under rocks (I think), and
since there were 2,000 snake-size
rocks per acre, I began to get
nervous. (Flagstaff headline:
Decomposed Body of Calif.

Student Found Near Meteor
Crater Trail)
The night before the Meteor
Crater visit was spent in Flagstaff,
a town that so appealed to my car
that it refused to leave the next
morning. When I was a callow
youth I read a book that said even
a Ph.D. must respect the
specialized knowledge of a lowly
mechanic. At the time I thought
that was absurd. In Flagstaff, my
post-doctoral education began.
As I stood by helplessly, the
lowly mechanic stuck his finger in
the carburetor, like a doctor
performing a pelvic examination.
The car roared to life.
"What d'you do?," I asked.
"Opened the choke, the
fragistor was crumulated because
of the altitude, and the ramdrit
was flooded in the cold."
Hope you're taking notes.
"How cold did it get last night,
anyway?," I ask.
"Oh, not too bad last night,
didn't get below zero."
Later on the radio, I hear the
overnight temperature was +4° F.
A regular heat wave. No wonder
the ramdrit was flooded.
The next morning, in Santa
Rosa, New Mexico, the fragistor is
again crumulated and the ramdrit
flooded, and the car determined
not to move. I stick my finger in
the carburetor, and it gets wet,
but the car just sits there. The
motel manager comes over
smiling, sticks a screwdriver down
the hole and the engine roars.
The book didn't say anything
about motel managers.
"How did you do that?," 1 ask.
"What's the difference," he

says in his mild German accent,
"as long as it works."
The next morning, the car
decides it likes Grand Prairie,
Texas so much, it wants to settle
down there. I stick a screwdriver
down its throat, and it comes
alive. Congratulations, Doctor.

Northern Arizona is Navajo
country, and the highways are
lined with billboards hawking
various Indian knick-knack shops:
Indian Village, Indian City, Indian
Town, Chief Geronimo's, Navajo
Joe's. Billboards must be cheap in
Arizona," each schlock-shop has
at least a dozen announcing its
approach—lOV2 Miles to Indian
City, 5 Miles to Indian City,
Indian City 2 Miles, Next Exit to
Indian City E-Z-Return, THIS IS
IT! INDIAN CITY.
Indian City, it turns out, has
exactly the same hand-crafted
jewelry, belts, T-shirts, boots, and
rugs as Indian Village, Indian
Town, Indianapolis, and the
thought occurs that the Indians
who made these authentic items
live in sampans. Suspicions are
confirmed in New Mexico where a
restaurant that specializes in
feeding its customers rather than
robbing them displays the
identical hand-crafted beadwork
with the "Made in Hong-Kong"
labels intact.
Some of the Indian shops are
authentic, with signs outside
reading "Buy from real Indians."
Since I was passing through on a
Sunday, and Navajos are
apparently quite religious, these
shops were invariably closed.
In one case somebody, either a
sensitive Indian or a wily
competitor, struck back. Next to
each sign announcing the
impending arrival of Chief
Yellowhorse was another sign
explaining that Yellowhorse was
Bad Medicine:
"Go to Yellowhorse and You'll
Get Wienered!" "That's Not
Yellowhorse, That's
GoldHorseStein!" (Apparently
Yellowhorse was not a Navajo.)

In Dallas, I visited the site of
President Kennedy's murder.
Dallas is not proud of its special
place in history, and the location
is not marked on any map; but
people seem to find it anyway. I
used the telephone book, and let
my fingers do the walking to the
listing for Texas School Book
Depository, which, for future
reference, is at 411 Elm Street.
There is a tiny park adjacent to

the site. A plaque in the park tells
us that President Kennedy was
shot by an assassin, and carefully
points out that Texas Governor
Connelly was shot at the same
time. If you're going that far, why
not mention the poor Dallas cop
who was shot while attempting to
apprehend Lee Harvey Oswald,
and who is now a lot deader than
Treasury Secretary Connelly?

I picked up a hitchhiker in
Alabama, an old man, about 60,
who was going to Selma to look
for work. When I picked him up,
he had been standing on the
highway for four hours. We talked
about the tight job market, for
Ph.D.'s in Electrical Engineering
and for laborers.
I explained to him that I was
going to New York for a job, and
we, the 26-year-old Ph.D. and the
60-year-old functional illiterate,
had something to talk about.
Then I mentioned I was from
Stanford, and when he didn't
respond, I said "Rose Bowl."
Then we talked about Jim
Plunkett, Randy Vataha, John
Ralston, the Saints, the Cowboys,
the Dolphins, the Giants, the
Forty-Niners and John Brodie, for
half an hour.
When we got to Selma I was
going to give him a dollar to get
something to eat, but he jumped
out of the car before I could say a
word.
* * *
Tomorrow, it's on to New
York. I have been a student for 21
years, and the transition, so far,
has been painful. Leaving
Stanford was particularly hard.
After almost six years, I was
beginning to become a fixture, a
part of the landscape like Mount
Diablo or the San Andreas Fault.
There is a temptation to stay at
Stanford forever, to remain in the
bosom, and I might have stayed, if
NASA, in its infinite wisdom,
hadn't decided to temporarily cut
off funds for my project.
(Presidential Press Conference—Q.
"How did you become a war hero,
Sir?" -President Kennedy. "It was
easy. They sank my boat.")
So, I'm off to New York, to
work for one year playing around
with the atmosphere of Jupiter.
Stanford, Bruce Franklin, and the
Tresidder Food Service will have
to get along without me.
In fact, now that I'm an
alumnus, I wish you kids would
buckle down and stop screwing up
my alma mater, or, by God, I'll
write you out of my will.
