# Night Of 20th Century Music
## 
### DAVID WILLIAMS 
I must confess that I left
Wednesday night's San Francisco
Symphony concert before
Scriabin's "Poem of Ecstacy" was
performed, absolutely sated with
20th century academic music.
But on a program of many
20th century music, compared to
the Sessions Symphony No. 8 and
the Ishii "So-gu II," the Mozart
Concerto in C, K. 467 ("Elvira
Madigan") itself composed for the
academies of the Viennese winter
season of 1786, sounded
simple-minded and countrified.
That impression may be due to
a certain rigidness in Ozawa's
appraoch to 18th-Century music.
He assumes that Mozart was never
out of doors, and forgets that
"Die Zauberflote" was premiered
in a half open barn in a
middle-class Viennese suburb, and
that Mozart wrote as much music
to be played out of doors as
anyone in the 18th Century.
The tone of his strings is
entirely too brilliant and
Wednesday night he succeeded in
making a rather good
academic-Keupff-Fischer type
pianist, Christoph Eschenbach,
sound as impassioned as Lizst or
Anthony Newman.
Happening Music
The timbre of Eschenbeach's
playing sounded too dark, too
brooding—this is Mozart at his
most elegant, his most grandiose
and his most learned, and it
should be played as music for a
happening and not a funeral.
Even in the now over-played
adagio, Seiji was out in left field.
Stated simply, his muted strings
weren't muted enough, and
Eschenbach, a veritable volcano of
apoggitura, ornamentation, and
cadenza, was doing a hevy
virtuoso trip, so Mozart comes out
something like a frozen waffle, all
the meaning lost somewhere in
the middle distance.
Roger Sessions, Aaron
Copland, Charles Ives, and Eliot

Carter are all completing the last
stages of the rites of immortality,
and all have been blessed with
fame while they were young
enough to enjoy it except for Ives,
who is probably the best of the
group. I confess I prefer Carter to
Sessions, the former is usually
subtle while the latter is often
merely intellectual.
Still Sessions is capable of
really good music however
resonant with exertion. Seiji is to
be congratulated for giving
Session's Symphony No. 8,
(1968) its West Coast premiere. I
know only his violin concerto
well, but this new symphony
struck me as a good deal less
romantic than the Brahms-like
concerto. It was almost
Stravinskyesque in its classicism,
i.e. The Symphony in C and the
Dumbarton Oaks Concerto.
It was a symphony written in a
connected two-part form that
suggested a French overture in the
manner of Rameau; the
movements were marked Adagio e
mesto and Allegro con brio. The
problem was that Ozawa did not
emphasize the brio in the second
part, so the work, a rather delicate
production merely impressed one,
when it could have astounded.
The Ishii composition, written
last year and dedicated to Mr.
Ozawa, was a fairly intelligent
attempt to combine the resources
of the Western orchestra with the
Japanese Gaguku ensemble, who
appeared last night in ceremonial
dress, and gave the composers
version of "when worlds collide,"
a certain distinctness.
Serial Approach
The composer's own program
notes tell us that in such a
situation there is no time, hence a
serial approach is adopted (Seiji
had about ten feet of score laid
out on the stage) and the issue
becomes duration rather than

measure. The Gaguku thus gets
serialized as it floats in and out of
the temporal dimension, i.e. time.
The work was complete last
year and it was all rather pretty,
though a bit too Connecticut. Do
you remember Brubeck on
Bernstein on Brubeck? Well,
Howard Brubeck's attempt to join
in holy wedlock the jazz combo
and the orchestra, "Dialogues for

Jazz Quartet and Orchestra" was
about as moving as So-gu 11.
One wanted after this a rest
and Scriabin's "Poem of Ecstasy"
would have been too much—one
wished to go home on a cloud of
Gallupi or Vivaldi. Seiji might,
however, do well to record this
the lastest example of cultural
diffusion—so-gu II is absolutely a
la mode.
