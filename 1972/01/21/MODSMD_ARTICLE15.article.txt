# Indians Go Coed Saturday
## 
### DOUG WILSON 
Stanford's varsity swimming
meets go coed this weekend, as
the undefeated Stanford Indians
host the Arden Hills Swim Club at
2 p.m. at Encina Pool. Male
chauvinist coach Jim Gaughran, in
keeping with the spirit of the
meet, will add freshman Vicki
King, an Arden Hills veteran, to
the Stanford distance line-up, and
Arden Hills mentor (and Olympic
v omen's coach) Sherm Chavoor
brings a talented AAU squad
headed by Elie Daniel, Olympic
butterfly champion.
King, who has participated in
the Olympic Games, and is
considered one of the top female
distance swimmers in the nation,
will compete for Stanford in the
500-yd. freestyle. Joining her in
that event will probably be
sophomore Terry Sutton, who now
ranks among the top 15 collegiate
swimmers in that event, according
to Swimming World magazine.

Arden Hills, however, boasts
three of the nation's outstanding

distance competitors; the trio is
headed by Mike Burton, a
Chavoor protege who is regarded
as one of swimming's all-time
greats, and who competed as an
undergraduate for UCLA. The
other highly-rated Arden Hills
distance tankers are Rex Bavaro
and Dave Kenyon, who's 16:09.0
clocking in the 1650 led the
nation's high school times last
year.
And, of course, there is Elie
Daniel, the Olympic butterfly
champion who hopes to shake up
Stanford butterfliers Rick
Longinotti and John Stalker in
tomorrow's 200-yd. butterfly
competition. Last week
Longinotti turned in a :53.1 time
for the 100 fly, followed by
Stalker in :53.2; the latter also
won the 200 fly in 1:58.0. Daniel,
however, may prove to be a notch
or two above the Beavers from
Oregon State (whom Stanford
thoroughly trounced, 105-28), she
is also the AAU National
Champion in the women's 200
fly.

Stanford sprinters Steve Carey,
Martin Pedley, Ken Hammer,
Marty Clevenger and Bob Wilson
will face a young Arden Hills
sprint squad headed by
All-American high school
swimmer Dave Fairfield. High
school juniors Scott Brown and
Bruce Hunt, of Arden Hills, will
seek to upset Stanford's Brian
Job, Dave Shilling, and Lee
Mac Donald in the individual
medley. Brown, also a top
backstroker, will meet the
Stanford tandem of Randy
Whitchurch and Jack Deppe in the
200-yd. backstroke.
If Brian Job can avoid a
false-start disqualification, he and
teammate Dave Shilling will be
favored in the 200-yd.
breaststroke; Job currently leads
the nation in that event with a
2:07.8 clocking.
For those who prefer all-male
swimming, the junior varsity
meets the Maders Swim Club at
10 a.m., also at Encina.
