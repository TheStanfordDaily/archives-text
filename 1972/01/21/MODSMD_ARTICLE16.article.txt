# Pedley Leads Sprint Hopes
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
In the thirteen years Martin
Pedley had been swimming
competitively before he entered
Stanford he had been exposed to
just about every type of swim
meet imaginable and had received
numerous awards and honors.
In high school« he was
All-American three years in the 50
yard freestyle and two years in
the 100 yard freestyle. The times
he recorded now rank as the fifth
fastest 50 and the third fastest
100 in high school history. He had
placed in the finals of the
National AAU Outdoor
Championships two years in a row
with times that ranked in the top
ten in the world for those years.
It is not surprising then that
when it came time for Martin to
choose a college the offers were
numerous and attractive. With the
choice narrowed down between
USC, Harvard, and Stanford,
Martin chose Stanford because as
he puts it"I wasn't sure about a
major. Stanford was strong in a
great many of its undergraduate
departments, while also offering a
very fine aquatics program. These
were probably the determining
factors in my coming here."
Successful Freshman Year
Martin's success continued into
last season as he set a Stanford
Pool record in the 100 free of
46.2; and placed sixth in the 50
free in 21.19, and third in the 100
free in 45.71, at the NCAA's.
Both times were Stanford
Freshmen and Varsity records. In
addition, he anchored Stanford's
400 yard medley relay, which
included former Stanford stars
Fred Haywood and John Ferris,
along with junior Brian Job. This
relay beat favored Indiana and set
a new NCAA and American
record.
Martin believes the success he
is achieving now is due, in part, to
strong parental guidance when he
was younger. While many children
are turned off to a particular
activity by parental pressure,
Martin states, "My parents were
an enormous influence in the

earlier stages of my swimming
career. I should say I was bribed
and coerced into attending
after-school practices, particularly
in the second through sixth
grades. It wasn't until I was 12 or
13 that I developed an
appreciation of the sport."
Coaches Influence
In the 14 years Martin has been
swimming competitively he has
had seven different coaches
directing his swimming program.
He states, "All my coaches have
played slightly different roles.
Fortunately I have had good
relationships with all of them.
Coaches generate much of the
enthusiasm, or lack of it, for the
swimmer, especially for the
younger swimmer. This combined
with their ability to instruct and
discipline is crucial to a swimmer's
future. I think I can say that
through the years I have had a run
on good coaches."
In a sport where the team is
more often then not forgotten in
the face of individual successes,
Martin sees himself "As a member
of a team. Unlike a "team" sport,
however, with swimming it is only
in looking for your best personal
performance that benefits either
the individual or the team."
Martin believes the team can do
well this year if everyone has a
good year. He is particularly
looking forward to facing USC
and UCLA in Los Angeles.
After a summer in which he
failed to make the finals of the
National Championships for the
first time in three years Martin
remains confident. "I finished up
last spring quarter with mono and
was very weak for the first month
of summer training. The failure to
"drop my times" at the Nationals
was a matter of being out of phase
with the season more than
anything else."
Looking to the Olympics
Martin is looking forward to
the future as he hopes to do well
at the NCAA's and more
importantly qualify for the
Olympics in Munich. "I am
planning a lighter workload for
next quarter and I expect
priorities will get shifted around a
bit. I'll be traveling down to Santa
Clara once a day to work with the
Santa Clara Swim Club. My
activities will be oriented around
that and a second workout."
It only seems fitting that an
athlete such as Martin Pedley,
who has done so much in his
sport, should climax it all by
going to swimming's most
important showcase and attempt
to obtain its highest honors.

100 in high school history. He had
placed in the finals of the
National AAU Outdoor
Championships two years in a row
with times that ranked in the top
ten in the world for those years.
It is not surprising then that
when it came time for Martin to
choose a college the offers were
numerous and attractive. With the
choice narrowed down between
USC, Harvard, and Stanford,
Martin chose Stanford because as
he puts it"I wasn't sure about a
major. Stanford was strong in a
great many of its undergraduate
departments, while also offering a
very fine aquatics program. These
were probably the determining
factors in my coming here."
Successful Freshman Year
Martin's success continued into
last season as he set a Stanford
Pool record in the 100 free of
46.2; and placed sixth in the 50
free in 21.19, and third in the 100
free in 45.71, at the NCAA's.
Both times were Stanford
Freshmen and Varsity records. In
addition, he anchored Stanford's
400 yard medley relay, which
included former Stanford stars
Fred Haywood and John Ferris,
along with junior Brian Job. This
relay beat favored Indiana and set
a new NCAA and American
record.
Martin believes the success he
is achieving now is due, in part, to
strong parental guidance when he
was younger. While many children
are turned off to a particular
activity by parental pressure,
Martin states, "My parents were
an enormous influence in the

earlier stages of my swimming
career. I should say I was bribed
and coerced into attending
after-school practices, particularly
in the second through sixth
grades. It wasn't until I was 12 or
13 that I developed an
appreciation of the sport."
Coaches Influence
In the 14 years Martin has been
swimming competitively he has
had seven different coaches
directing his swimming program.
He states, "All my coaches have
played slightly different roles.
Fortunately I have had good
relationships with all of them.
Coaches generate much of the
enthusiasm, or lack of it, for the
swimmer, especially for the
younger swimmer. This combined
with their ability to instruct and
discipline is crucial to a swimmer's
future. I think I can say that
through the years I have had a run
on good coaches."
In a sport where the team is
more often then not forgotten in
the face of individual successes,
Martin sees himself "As a member
of a team. Unlike a "team" sport,
however, with swimming it is only
in looking for your best personal
performance that benefits either
the individual or the team."
Martin believes the team can do
well this year if everyone has a
good year. He is particularly
looking forward to facing USC
and UCLA in Los Angeles.
After a summer in which he
failed to make the finals of the
National Championships for the
first time in three years Martin
remains confident. "I finished up
last spring quarter with mono and
was very weak for the first month
of summer training. The failure to
"drop my times" at the Nationals
was a matter of being out of phase
with the season more than
anything else."
Looking to the Olympics
Martin is looking forward to
the future as he hopes to do well
at the NCAA's and more
importantly qualify for the
Olympics in Munich. "I am
planning a lighter workload for
next quarter and I expect
priorities will get shifted around a
bit. I'll be traveling down to Santa
Clara once a day to work with the
Santa Clara Swim Club. My
activities will be oriented around
that and a second workout."
It only seems fitting that an
athlete such as Martin Pedley,
who has done so much in his
sport, should climax it all by
going to swimming's most
important showcase and attempt
to obtain its highest honors.

he puts it"I wasn't sure about a
major. Stanford was strong in a
great many of its undergraduate
departments, while also offering a
very fine aquatics program. These
were probably the determining
factors in my coming here."
Successful Freshman Year
Martin's success continued into
last season as he set a Stanford
Pool record in the 100 free of
46.2; and placed sixth in the 50
free in 21.19, and third in the 100
free in 45.71, at the NCAA's.
Both times were Stanford
Freshmen and Varsity records. In
addition, he anchored Stanford's
400 yard medley relay, which
included former Stanford stars
Fred Haywood and John Ferris,
along with junior Brian Job. This
relay beat favored Indiana and set
a new NCAA and American
record.
Martin believes the success he
is achieving now is due, in part, to
strong parental guidance when he
was younger. While many children
are turned off to a particular
activity by parental pressure,
Martin states, "My parents were
an enormous influence in the

earlier stages of my swimming
career. I should say I was bribed
and coerced into attending
after-school practices, particularly
in the second through sixth
grades. It wasn't until I was 12 or
13 that I developed an
appreciation of the sport."
Coaches Influence
In the 14 years Martin has been
swimming competitively he has
had seven different coaches
directing his swimming program.
He states, "All my coaches have
played slightly different roles.
Fortunately I have had good
relationships with all of them.
Coaches generate much of the
enthusiasm, or lack of it, for the
swimmer, especially for the
younger swimmer. This combined
with their ability to instruct and
discipline is crucial to a swimmer's
future. I think I can say that
through the years I have had a run
on good coaches."
In a sport where the team is
more often then not forgotten in
the face of individual successes,
Martin sees himself "As a member
of a team. Unlike a "team" sport,
however, with swimming it is only
in looking for your best personal
performance that benefits either
the individual or the team."
Martin believes the team can do
well this year if everyone has a
good year. He is particularly
looking forward to facing USC
and UCLA in Los Angeles.
After a summer in which he
failed to make the finals of the
National Championships for the
first time in three years Martin
remains confident. "I finished up
last spring quarter with mono and
was very weak for the first month
of summer training. The failure to
"drop my times" at the Nationals
was a matter of being out of phase
with the season more than
anything else."
Looking to the Olympics
Martin is looking forward to
the future as he hopes to do well
at the NCAA's and more
importantly qualify for the
Olympics in Munich. "I am
planning a lighter workload for
next quarter and I expect
priorities will get shifted around a
bit. I'll be traveling down to Santa
Clara once a day to work with the
Santa Clara Swim Club. My
activities will be oriented around
that and a second workout."
It only seems fitting that an
athlete such as Martin Pedley,
who has done so much in his
sport, should climax it all by
going to swimming's most
important showcase and attempt
to obtain its highest honors.

freestyle event in the Oregon State meet last Saturday. He won the race in a time of :21.7, nosing out
teammate Steve Carey. PedJey is already working hard for the summer Olympics in Munich and has the
times and the talent to have a good chance of qualifying.

SURFACING—Captain Dave Shilling conies up for air in the 100 yard
breaststroke against OSU. Shilling and teammate Brian Job have
dominated the Stanford breaststroking effort this season.
In the thirteen years Martin
Pedley had been swimming
competitively before he entered
Stanford he had been exposed to
just about every type of swim
meet imaginable and had received
numerous awards and honors.
In high school« he was
All-American three years in the 50
yard freestyle and two years in
the 100 yard freestyle. The times
he recorded now rank as the fifth
fastest 50 and the third fastest
100 in high school history. He had
placed in the finals of the
National AAU Outdoor
Championships two years in a row
with times that ranked in the top
ten in the world for those years.
It is not surprising then that
when it came time for Martin to
choose a college the offers were
numerous and attractive. With the
choice narrowed down between
USC, Harvard, and Stanford,
Martin chose Stanford because as
he puts it"I wasn't sure about a
major. Stanford was strong in a
great many of its undergraduate
departments, while also offering a
very fine aquatics program. These
were probably the determining
