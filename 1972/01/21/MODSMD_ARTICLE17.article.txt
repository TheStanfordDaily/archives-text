## It Will Be Over Today 
### Charlie Hoffman 
The drama is almost over. This
morning, Mike White, Stanford's
beleagered assistant football
coach, is expected to end two
weeks of speculation and
announce whether he will accept
the head coaching position at
Stanford or Cal.
Stanford's selection committee
met for five hours Wednesday
afternoon, and handed their
recommendation to President
Lyman upon his return from
Washington, D.C. that evening.
Acting Athletic Director, Bob
Young, stated that the committee
received "very very few
applications. I have been amazed
at the small number of applicants,
usually when a job like this opens

up, everyone in the country
applies, whether they want the
job or not."
Contacted at his home last
night, Young presented his
understanding of the timing on
announcement of John Ralston's
successor. "It is in the President's
hands now. I sort of expected
word late this afternoon, but it
looks like tomorrow (Friday)
morning will be the deciding
time."
White has been under great
pressure this week and is suffering
from a bad cold, and it appears
that he is taking an extra day's
time to make his very important
decision. Cal has formally offered

its head coaching job to White,
and although no Stanford officials
will comment, it appears obvious
that White also has been made a
formal offer by President Lyman.
The most reliable indication
that White has been chosen for
the head Indian post is the fact
that his fellow assistant coaches
Jack Christiansen and Bob
Gambold have been in Dpnver
since yesterday morning and are
expected to stay there to help
Ralston guide the Broncos.
But will Stanford be Mike
White's choice? The chance to
coach at your alma mater is
appealing, but the Cal football
program has been haunted by
administrative and financial
problems for several years. This
consideration might be the
decisive factor since the program
here is successful and the lines of
communication clear.
