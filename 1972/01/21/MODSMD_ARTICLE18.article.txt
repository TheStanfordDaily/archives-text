# Ruggers Meet SF Club
## 
### 
The road to Monterey and a
fifth straight national rugby
championship will be a little larger
and a little rougher this year for
the Tribe's fifteen. Graduation
took its toll of experienced
players, and Coach Pete Knetovic
has spent the early weeks of the
season juggling his varsity line-up
around in search of the
combination of speed and muscle
needed to meet the challenge of
such teams as the Peninsula
Ramblers and the Bay Area
Touring Side.
Gone from last year's
championship side are backs Jim
Squeri, Jim Kauffman, and Jack
Schultz, while Ron Kadziel, Jack
Alvetiza, Wade Millefer, Greg
Boughton, and Mike Kirkwood
are missing from the scrum.
Scrum Rebuilt
But Kmetovic has rebuilt the
scrum around returning hooker

Bill Buckland and prop Dennis
Sheehan, and veteran breakaway
Tom Klein is paired with either
Mark Brandon or Terry Pape as
the wing forwards. The second
row has been beefed up with the
addition of Eric Debooyer and
John Snider, and Gordy Riegel is
back as the lock.
If the forwards mix it up a
little bit and are able to control
the line out situations and dig the
ball out of loose rucks, scrum half
Chip Greening, a converted
breakaway, has an exceptionally
quick line of backs beind him who
are capable of breaking the big
play.
Don Bunce will leave his pads
and helmet in the locker room as
he takes the rugby field at
stand-off in the Stanford
backfield. His passes will go to
Frank Charlton and Marty
O'Donahue at the centers and

Reggie Sanderson and Steve
Longbotham, the most unlikely
pair of wings in the league, on the
ends of the line. Kip Oxman, who
paced the resounding victory over
the Old Gaels last weekend,
returns to his fullback position as
a combination fielder, punter,
field commander, free safety and
breakaway threat.
Davis Upset
Upset 6-3 in the opening game
of the season with a rejuvenated
UC Davis team on a 45 yard drop
kick with jut four minutes to
play, the Tribe rallied to hand the
Old Gaels a 30-6 pasting last
Saturday. Four games are
scheduled for Stanford's four
rugby teams this Saturday with
the varsity getting underway at
1:30 p.m. with the San Francisco
Rugby Club on the field behind
Maples Pavillion. The seconds will
play at 3:00 p.m.
