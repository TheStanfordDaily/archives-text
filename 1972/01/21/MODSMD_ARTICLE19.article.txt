# Skaters Tie Cal, 4-4, Face Air Force Tonight
## 
### 
In their final competition
before Air Force, the Stanford
Hockey team staged a dramatic
comeback enabling them to tie
the Berkeley juniors, 4-4, on
Tuesday night. This game which
had to be a moral victory for the
Indians will put them in a proper
frame of mind for tonight's game.
Stanford scored first in the
game. Russ MacAusland followed
his own rebound behind the net
and then passed in front to John
Mackall whose shot cleared the
fallen netminder into the cage.
However, as has been typical
Stanford could not find the
handle on their offensive plays
but played good defense. So
MacAusland's goal held up into
the third period. Then Stanford
had one of its temporary lapses
and Berkeley struck for three
goals in four minutes. Then with
only ten minutes left in the game
the Juniors tallied again and it
seemed that Stanford would again
lose to a team it had outplayed.
The Cards' comeback started
with a little more than four
minutes remaining in the game.
After a rush down his wing, Robert
Macy passed back to Tom
Bedford who fired from twenty
feet out and beat the Berkeley
netminder. A minute later
Berkeley was penalized. Coach
Baldwin elected to pull the goalie

and with only ten seconds left on
the penalty and 1:29 left in the
game Chris Counihan's drive from
the point was tipped in by Paul
Tittman and the Cards now trailed
by only a goal.
The Indians continued to
pressure Berkeley in the last
minute. A Berkeley defenseman's
attempted clearing pass was
knocked down by Counihan at
the point. His shot was tipped in
by Baldwin and Stanford had tied
the game up with only 19 seconds
left.
Tonight Stanford faces the Air
Force Academy in Fresno at
Seland Arena. Air Force will be
the most disciplined, best
coached, best conditioned, and
strongest team that the Cards have
ever played. To keep up with
them Stanford will have to skate
hard both on offense and defense.
Also they will be both playing on
a larger rink than Belmont and
also subject to NCAA rules which
permit icing the puck once over
one's own blueline.
The Cadets of Air Force are a
major college hockey team. Their
record now stands at 12-3. They
have scored 97 goals and given up
only 59. This makes the job of the
Stanford defense even tougher.
They have a prospective
Ail-American in captain Bob Ross
who is second on the team in

scoring with 29 points. The
Cadets also have an effective
power play as they've scored 30
goals while a man up. But their
defense is not as overwhelming.
Their goalie is only a freshman
and is giving up nearly four goals a
game.
Of course these conditions will
affect every member of the team
but the wings will have the biggest
burden. They must back-check
their wing and cover him closely
in the defensive endâ€”something
they have not done very well this
season.
On defense the Indians must
clear the puck out of their end
quickly and efficiently. Goalie
Rick Bragdon will have to display
the form he had earlier this
season, and allow no fluke goals.
Stanford will have to play solid
defense if they are to make an
impressive showing.
This trip to Fresno is the first
of four trips the Stanford Hockey
team will make. They'll go to
Colorado Springs to play Air
Force twice more, and Colorado
once in Boulder on the same trip.
Then they go to Las Vegas to play
the semi-pro team there. Finally
on the first weekend of Spring
quarter they'll go to Los Angeles
to play in a tournament with Cal,
UCLA, and San Diego State.
