## Two Profs Hit DoD Report 
### 
The recent SWOPSI report on the
impact of Department of Defense
(DoD) research here, has received
strong criticism from two professors of
the engineering faculty.
Stephen Kline of Mechanical
Engineering, in a personal
memorandum sent to approximately
150 other faculty members two weeks
ago, declared that, "I am not familiar
with any other purported piece of
scholarship that is this bad."
As a result of protests by another
professor, William Spicer of Electrical
Engineering, the SWOPSI policy board
agreed last week to insert a page-long
correction into the report's second
volume.
The first volume of the report,
which appeared last summer, described
the individual DoD projects awarded
to Stanford. The second volume,
which received the criticism, is titled
"DoD Sponsored Research at
Stanford: Its Impact on the
University," and appeared in
December.
A statement by Spicer appears in
the original report criticizing the Army
Contract Office claim that his work on
amorphous materials can be used for
night-vision devices.
Reasons Given
He finds in the correction that the
Army statement was actually valid,
and elaborates with more technical

reasons why his work is very unlikely
to lead to the night-vision devices.
The analysis of Spicer's work in the
second volume of the SWOPSI DoD
report contrasts his estimation of its
use in night vision with the Army's.
Stanton A. Glantz, a Ph.D.
candidate in applied mechanics and
leader of the class that produced the
report, says the insert was made
"without the concurrence of the
authors." He adds that Spicer's
statement does not alter the point
made in the section dealing with his
work.
The memo circulated by Prof. Kline
says the DoD report contains
"incorrect data," "misinterprets basic
documents," and "fails to provide
definitions of key terms." He believes
the entire report is "set in a frame of
reference which . . . suggests
preconceived political bias."
He also states that the second
volume of the report "had no faculty
sponsorship," as is required for
SWOPSI courses.
But according to Glantz the
sponsor, Prof. Holt Ashley of
Aeronautics and Astronautics,
supervised the workshop when it
began last spring quarter, approved the
idea of a two volume study, and saw
outlines of both volumes of the report
as they were being worked on last
summer.
Ashley left early this fall, however,

to teach at the University of Maryland,
and Kline maintains that he asked his
name to be withdrawn as sponsor for
the project. Ashley, who is still in
Maryland, could not be reached for
comment.
SWOPSI director Dan Lewis is
preparing a reply to Kline's criticism
of SWOPSI's policy toward the DoD
report.
Kline questions the publication of sentiments
"unqualified, and unmodified by any other information
or viewpoints, as a work of scholarship carrying the
Stanford label."
Kline says that in his opinion, "gross, irresponsible
invasions of the rights of able, dedicated and honest
members of the Stanford faculty have occurred."
Kline's memo criticizes the DoD report for harking
back to "the good old days," in trying to describe the
negative effects DoD money has had on research at
Stanford.
A "point by point" response to Kline's memo is being
prepared by the authors of the DoD report, says Glantz.
He says that "the ensuing discussion is going to show that
we were scholarly."
