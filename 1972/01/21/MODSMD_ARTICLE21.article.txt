Jet Hijacker Caught
DENVER — A young man who hijacked a Hughes Airwest
jet by claiming to have a bomb was captured last night in
a remote area of Colorado less than three hours after he
parachuted from the plane with $50,000 of the airline's
money.
The Colorado State Patrol said the hijacker was taken
into custody in a plains area 130 miles northeast of
Denver. Police said he was arrested after he tried to hail a
farmer driving by in a pickup truck.
The FBI said all the money was recovered, but it
refused to disclose the hijacker's identity. He left behind
him on the plane an incendiary device—he had called it a
bomb—that authorities said could have caused "an awful
lot of damage" had it been ignited. The device was
disarmed by Denver police.
He had used the bomb threat to get the $50,000 in
$10s and $20s, three parachutes and two crash helmets
from airline officials at McCarran International Airport in
Las Vegas, Nev., where he had commandeered the plane.
He let the 56 passengers and two stewardesses off there
before ordering the plane toward Denver.
The pilot, Capt. Don Burkhard, told a Denver news
conference that the man bailed out at 12,000 feet while
the plane was traveling 180 miles an hour.
'Slate Of The Union'
WASHINGTON — President Nixon summoned a
Democratic Congress yesterday to join him in
election-year partnership and pass, despite "the intense
pressures" of a White House campaign, an array of stalled
administration proposals, a bigger defense budget and a
"new technology program" to promote research and
create jobs.
"Let us join in making sure that legislation the nation
needs does not become hostage to the political interest of
any party or any person," the President said in a State of
the Union message that challenged the House and Senate
to act in 1972 on more than 90 proposals he already has
sent to Capitol Hill.
Nixon did not say exactly how much bigger his defense
budget would be, but he detailed $3.7 billion in increases,
including $2 billion more for the Navy, $900 million to
improve the sea-based U.S. nuclear deteirent force, and
$838 million in stepped-up research and development
spending.
The leftover agenda was topped by his proposals for
welfare reform, federal revenue sharing with the cities and
states, reorganization of the executive branch, and a new
health insurance program.
"Let us have our debates," the Republican President
said. "Let us have our honest differences. But let us join
in keeping the national interest first."
Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine, leading contender
among Nixon's Democratic challengers, called the address
"an empty speech . . . You don't eliminate the pressures
by ignoring the problems in a State of the Union speech,"
he said.

Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, campaigning
for a 1972 presidential rematch with Nixon, said Nixon
had delivered "a frontal assault on Congress without
giving credit for some very constructive work."
Sen. Henry M. Jackson of Washington said Nixon had
delivered "a political platform instead of a program that
will help those in distress all over America."
In his written message, Nixon recited the
administration record of troop withdrawals from South
Vietnam, saying that by May 1, he will have cut forces by
87 percent.
Nixon also said he is confident that by the middle of
1973 "we can achieve our goal of reducing draft calls to
zero."
He cautioned Congress and the nation not to expect
"too much too quickly" from his forthcoming visits to
Peking and Moscow.
"My visits will mean not that our differences have
disappeared or will disappear in the near future," he said.
". . . The important thing is that we talk about these
differences rather than fight about them."
Davis Request 'Ridiculous'
SACRAMENTO — If Angela Davis wants the state to pay
for her defense in her murder-conspiracy trial, she should
"throw herself on the mercy of the court for a public
defender," Gov. Reagan said yesterday.
But her suggestion the state should pay for the present
battery of private attorneys she has hired for her pending
San Jose trial is "utterly ridiculous," the Republican
governor said in his second news conference of 1972.
Reagan signed legislation last year for the state to pick
up Marin County's costs for the prosecution, but he flatly
rejected the idea the state should do the same thing for
Miss Davis, and he said he is "getting impatient" with
delays in bringing the former UCLA philosophy instructor
to trial. She has been in custody for over 13 months and
pretrail motions are still being heard.
Rhodesia Riots Continue
SALISBURY, Rhodesia — Police killed three blacks
during rioting in a Salisbury township, the government
reported yesterday, and violence linked to a
British-Rhodesian settlement spread to other cities.
Thousands of blacks stoned shops and set automobiles
ablaze in Salisbury's Harate township Wednesday night.
As police moved in to restore order in the all-black area,
44 persons — two dozen with gunshot wounds — were
arrested, the government said.
The black riots, which began Sunday, were touched off
by the arrival of a British commission assigned to feel out
public opinion on a proposed Rhodesian-British
settlement.
The agreement holds that settlement is not possible
until the commission finds a majority of Rhodesians —
including the white-ruled country's black majority —
accepts the terms. London's political circles appeared
convinced the outbreak of violence spelled doom for the
agreement.
Two Planes Downed
SAIGON — Two U.S. Air Force fighter-bombers were lost
over Laos, apparently to enemy ground fire, yesterday but
all four crewmen were rescued, the U.S. Command said.
They were the 13th and 14 th American planes lost
since the Indochina air war heated up in late December,
and the first ones reported downed in Laos this year.
The two planes went down about the same time
yesterday afternoon but some 250 miles apart, the
command said Friday (Vietnam time).
One of the Phantoms was hit by enemy ground fire
while flying bombing missions along the South
Vietnam-Laos border. It went down on the Laos side, the
comand said.
The other was an RF4 Phantom reconnaissance plane
that was lost in the area of the Plain of Jars in central
Laos. The command said it had not been determined what
brought the aircraft down but it was "suspected enemy
ground fire."

into custody in a plains area 130 miles northeast of
Denver. Police said he was arrested after he tried to hail a
farmer driving by in a pickup truck.
The FBI said all the money was recovered, but it
refused to disclose the hijacker's identity. He left behind
him on the plane an incendiary device—he had called it a
bomb—that authorities said could have caused "an awful
lot of damage" had it been ignited. The device was
disarmed by Denver police.
He had used the bomb threat to get the $50,000 in
$10s and $20s, three parachutes and two crash helmets
from airline officials at McCarran International Airport in
Las Vegas, Nev., where he had commandeered the plane.
He let the 56 passengers and two stewardesses off there
before ordering the plane toward Denver.
The pilot, Capt. Don Burkhard, told a Denver news
conference that the man bailed out at 12,000 feet while
the plane was traveling 180 miles an hour.
'Slate Of The Union'
WASHINGTON — President Nixon summoned a
Democratic Congress yesterday to join him in
election-year partnership and pass, despite "the intense
pressures" of a White House campaign, an array of stalled
administration proposals, a bigger defense budget and a
"new technology program" to promote research and
create jobs.
"Let us join in making sure that legislation the nation
needs does not become hostage to the political interest of
any party or any person," the President said in a State of
the Union message that challenged the House and Senate
to act in 1972 on more than 90 proposals he already has
sent to Capitol Hill.
Nixon did not say exactly how much bigger his defense
budget would be, but he detailed $3.7 billion in increases,
including $2 billion more for the Navy, $900 million to
improve the sea-based U.S. nuclear deteirent force, and
$838 million in stepped-up research and development
spending.
The leftover agenda was topped by his proposals for
welfare reform, federal revenue sharing with the cities and
states, reorganization of the executive branch, and a new
health insurance program.
"Let us have our debates," the Republican President
said. "Let us have our honest differences. But let us join
in keeping the national interest first."
Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine, leading contender
among Nixon's Democratic challengers, called the address
"an empty speech . . . You don't eliminate the pressures
by ignoring the problems in a State of the Union speech,"
he said.

Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, campaigning
for a 1972 presidential rematch with Nixon, said Nixon
had delivered "a frontal assault on Congress without
giving credit for some very constructive work."
Sen. Henry M. Jackson of Washington said Nixon had
delivered "a political platform instead of a program that
will help those in distress all over America."
In his written message, Nixon recited the
administration record of troop withdrawals from South
Vietnam, saying that by May 1, he will have cut forces by
87 percent.
Nixon also said he is confident that by the middle of
1973 "we can achieve our goal of reducing draft calls to
zero."
He cautioned Congress and the nation not to expect
"too much too quickly" from his forthcoming visits to
Peking and Moscow.
"My visits will mean not that our differences have
disappeared or will disappear in the near future," he said.
". . . The important thing is that we talk about these
differences rather than fight about them."
Davis Request 'Ridiculous'
SACRAMENTO — If Angela Davis wants the state to pay
for her defense in her murder-conspiracy trial, she should
"throw herself on the mercy of the court for a public
defender," Gov. Reagan said yesterday.
But her suggestion the state should pay for the present
battery of private attorneys she has hired for her pending
San Jose trial is "utterly ridiculous," the Republican
governor said in his second news conference of 1972.
Reagan signed legislation last year for the state to pick
up Marin County's costs for the prosecution, but he flatly
rejected the idea the state should do the same thing for
Miss Davis, and he said he is "getting impatient" with
delays in bringing the former UCLA philosophy instructor
to trial. She has been in custody for over 13 months and
pretrail motions are still being heard.
Rhodesia Riots Continue
SALISBURY, Rhodesia — Police killed three blacks
during rioting in a Salisbury township, the government
reported yesterday, and violence linked to a
British-Rhodesian settlement spread to other cities.
Thousands of blacks stoned shops and set automobiles
ablaze in Salisbury's Harate township Wednesday night.
As police moved in to restore order in the all-black area,
44 persons — two dozen with gunshot wounds — were
arrested, the government said.
The black riots, which began Sunday, were touched off
by the arrival of a British commission assigned to feel out
public opinion on a proposed Rhodesian-British
settlement.
The agreement holds that settlement is not possible
until the commission finds a majority of Rhodesians —
including the white-ruled country's black majority —
accepts the terms. London's political circles appeared
convinced the outbreak of violence spelled doom for the
agreement.
Two Planes Downed
SAIGON — Two U.S. Air Force fighter-bombers were lost
over Laos, apparently to enemy ground fire, yesterday but
all four crewmen were rescued, the U.S. Command said.
They were the 13th and 14 th American planes lost
since the Indochina air war heated up in late December,
and the first ones reported downed in Laos this year.
The two planes went down about the same time
yesterday afternoon but some 250 miles apart, the
command said Friday (Vietnam time).
One of the Phantoms was hit by enemy ground fire
while flying bombing missions along the South
Vietnam-Laos border. It went down on the Laos side, the
comand said.
The other was an RF4 Phantom reconnaissance plane
that was lost in the area of the Plain of Jars in central
Laos. The command said it had not been determined what
brought the aircraft down but it was "suspected enemy
ground fire."
Jet Hijacker Caught

lot of damage" had it been ignited. The device was
disarmed by Denver police.
He had used the bomb threat to get the $50,000 in
$10s and $20s, three parachutes and two crash helmets
from airline officials at McCarran International Airport in
Las Vegas, Nev., where he had commandeered the plane.
He let the 56 passengers and two stewardesses off there
before ordering the plane toward Denver.
The pilot, Capt. Don Burkhard, told a Denver news
conference that the man bailed out at 12,000 feet while
the plane was traveling 180 miles an hour.
'Slate Of The Union'
WASHINGTON — President Nixon summoned a
Democratic Congress yesterday to join him in
election-year partnership and pass, despite "the intense
pressures" of a White House campaign, an array of stalled
administration proposals, a bigger defense budget and a
"new technology program" to promote research and
create jobs.
"Let us join in making sure that legislation the nation
needs does not become hostage to the political interest of
any party or any person," the President said in a State of
the Union message that challenged the House and Senate
to act in 1972 on more than 90 proposals he already has
sent to Capitol Hill.
Nixon did not say exactly how much bigger his defense
budget would be, but he detailed $3.7 billion in increases,
including $2 billion more for the Navy, $900 million to
improve the sea-based U.S. nuclear deteirent force, and
$838 million in stepped-up research and development
spending.
The leftover agenda was topped by his proposals for
welfare reform, federal revenue sharing with the cities and
states, reorganization of the executive branch, and a new
health insurance program.
"Let us have our debates," the Republican President
said. "Let us have our honest differences. But let us join
in keeping the national interest first."
Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine, leading contender
among Nixon's Democratic challengers, called the address
"an empty speech . . . You don't eliminate the pressures
by ignoring the problems in a State of the Union speech,"
he said.

Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, campaigning
for a 1972 presidential rematch with Nixon, said Nixon
had delivered "a frontal assault on Congress without
giving credit for some very constructive work."
Sen. Henry M. Jackson of Washington said Nixon had
delivered "a political platform instead of a program that
will help those in distress all over America."
In his written message, Nixon recited the
administration record of troop withdrawals from South
Vietnam, saying that by May 1, he will have cut forces by
87 percent.
Nixon also said he is confident that by the middle of
1973 "we can achieve our goal of reducing draft calls to
zero."
He cautioned Congress and the nation not to expect
"too much too quickly" from his forthcoming visits to
Peking and Moscow.
"My visits will mean not that our differences have
disappeared or will disappear in the near future," he said.
". . . The important thing is that we talk about these
differences rather than fight about them."
Davis Request 'Ridiculous'
SACRAMENTO — If Angela Davis wants the state to pay
for her defense in her murder-conspiracy trial, she should
"throw herself on the mercy of the court for a public
defender," Gov. Reagan said yesterday.
But her suggestion the state should pay for the present
battery of private attorneys she has hired for her pending
San Jose trial is "utterly ridiculous," the Republican
governor said in his second news conference of 1972.
Reagan signed legislation last year for the state to pick
up Marin County's costs for the prosecution, but he flatly
rejected the idea the state should do the same thing for
Miss Davis, and he said he is "getting impatient" with
delays in bringing the former UCLA philosophy instructor
to trial. She has been in custody for over 13 months and
pretrail motions are still being heard.
Rhodesia Riots Continue
SALISBURY, Rhodesia — Police killed three blacks
during rioting in a Salisbury township, the government
reported yesterday, and violence linked to a
British-Rhodesian settlement spread to other cities.
Thousands of blacks stoned shops and set automobiles
ablaze in Salisbury's Harate township Wednesday night.
As police moved in to restore order in the all-black area,
44 persons — two dozen with gunshot wounds — were
arrested, the government said.
The black riots, which began Sunday, were touched off
by the arrival of a British commission assigned to feel out
public opinion on a proposed Rhodesian-British
settlement.
The agreement holds that settlement is not possible
until the commission finds a majority of Rhodesians —
including the white-ruled country's black majority —
accepts the terms. London's political circles appeared
convinced the outbreak of violence spelled doom for the
agreement.
Two Planes Downed
SAIGON — Two U.S. Air Force fighter-bombers were lost
over Laos, apparently to enemy ground fire, yesterday but
all four crewmen were rescued, the U.S. Command said.
They were the 13th and 14 th American planes lost
since the Indochina air war heated up in late December,
and the first ones reported downed in Laos this year.
The two planes went down about the same time
yesterday afternoon but some 250 miles apart, the
command said Friday (Vietnam time).
One of the Phantoms was hit by enemy ground fire
while flying bombing missions along the South
Vietnam-Laos border. It went down on the Laos side, the
comand said.
The other was an RF4 Phantom reconnaissance plane
that was lost in the area of the Plain of Jars in central
Laos. The command said it had not been determined what
brought the aircraft down but it was "suspected enemy
ground fire."
Jet Hijacker Caught
DENVER — A young man who hijacked a Hughes Airwest
jet by claiming to have a bomb was captured last night in
a remote area of Colorado less than three hours after he
parachuted from the plane with $50,000 of the airline's
money.
The Colorado State Patrol said the hijacker was taken
into custody in a plains area 130 miles northeast of
Denver. Police said he was arrested after he tried to hail a
farmer driving by in a pickup truck.
The FBI said all the money was recovered, but it
refused to disclose the hijacker's identity. He left behind
him on the plane an incendiary device—he had called it a
bomb—that authorities said could have caused "an awful
lot of damage" had it been ignited. The device was
disarmed by Denver police.
