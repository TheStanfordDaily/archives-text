# Cross Reopens Suit On Stanford Sexism
## 
### 
A Stanford alumnae has reopened
her legal battle on University
admissions which she claims are sexist
and racist.
Nancy Jewell Cross, a local chemist,
has filed a motion in Santa Clara
County Superior Court that, if
granted, would resurrect a lawsuit
against the University that apparently
had died in November.
The suit, instigated last April by
Cross and Linda Crouse, a Stanford
computer programmer, would force
the Univesity to abolish ratios on the
admission of men and women.
Killed In November
Judge John S. Mclnerny sustained a
demurrer by the University late in
November, which had the effect of
killing the suit. Cross and Crouse
immediately filed a motion asking
the judge to disqualify himself. He
ruled against that, too.
The newest motion—filed
Wednesday—is another appeal for the
judge to remove himself from the case.
It will act as a supplement to the
earlier disqualification motion, which
wasn't killed by Mclnerny's
unfavorable ruling.
The new motion asks Mclnerny to
either vacate his decision—cancel it—or

submit to an examination in court for
"didism", or demoic isolation
disability.
The motion is accompanied by
several articles from psycological
journals defining didism as a
"perceptual disability" that acts as a
"prejudice preventing him (Mclnerny)
from picking up ideas and authorities
in law hindered by a woman
advocate," according to the motion.
Two Choices
Mclnerny can either disqualify
himself, or file an affidavit denying the
charges. Another judge would then
rule on the matter.
Cross, a "people's advocate,"
wouldn't say what she thought of the
motion's chances. "A good lawyer is
not going to predict it," she said. But
she did mention that if it fails she may
take the issue to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
"We might petition for a writ (file
an appeal)," Cross said. "The issue is
one of great public importance, and
time is of the essence." She referred to
the acceptance of the new freshman
class, coming up in April.
The motion will come up next
Tuesday in Mclnerny's court in San
Jose.
