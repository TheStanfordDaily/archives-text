# Industrial Park Draws Criticism
## 
### ROBERT BACON Third in a series 
Best known and most controversial
of Stanford's land developments is the
Stanford Industrial Park, some 570
acres stretching along Page Mill Road
from El Camino to the foothills.
The Park, Stanford's largest source
of land development income, is
dominated by the light manufacturing
and research facilities of aerospace and
electronics firms.
The Industrial Park had its
beginnings in 1951. Varian Associates
was the first tenant; Hewlett-Packard
followed a year later. (The rationale
for industrial development has been
described in the first and second
articles in this series.)
The development of the Park has
been guided by a 1954 Board of
Trustees statement: "The customary
considerations applying to the
subdivision of lands for utilitarian
purposes will be applied . . . (but)
material gain is not necessarily the
governing factor. .. . The aim of the
development shall be to produce ... a
community of which the University
Trustees and all those who have its
welfare at heart can be proud. ..
Strict Standards
Once it determined to enter the
industrial land development business,
Stanford set strict standards for its
tenants.
Potential occupants are screened
carefully. University Land Resources
Manager Boyd Smith noted, "We've
been very selective. We've turned
down a lot of potential tenants."
Heavy manufacturers and excessive
polluters are not permitted; light and

precision manufacturers and research
and development firms predominate.
University officials point out that,
although not a strict requirement,
some potential mutually beneficial
tie-in with the University weighs
heavily in a potential tenant's favor.
Smith explained, "there are many
important relationships between
companies and the Ihiversity. Faculty
members consult there, students work
there. Many of these companies
provide applications for Stanford's

pure research; that was one of the
major reasons we started the park.
"There is a tremendous
cross-fertilization of ideas. Many of
the tenants give Stanford more in gifts
than they pay in lease fees. . . . The
University has gained at least as much
from the Industrial Park in other areas
as in strict economic terms."
Varian, Hewlett-Packard, and
Applied Technology, three of the
leading electronics firms in the Park,
were founded by Stanford engineering

graduates.
All three firms bear the mark of
Frederick E. Terman, one-time Dean
of Engineering and Provost at
Stanford. Terman was one of the
leading backers of the Industrial Park,
envisioning a community of "technical
scholars" such as that described by
Smith.
Military Contracts
Critics of the policy have directed
much of their fire at this point. Since a

CONTROVERSIAL COMPANY—Hewlett-Packard, an electronics firm criticized for its Department of Defense contracts,
was one of the first companies to move into the Stanford Industrial Park. An inspiring example of work-study-get ahead,
the highly successful firm was founded by Stanford engineering grads. Co-founder and ex-trustee David Packard recently
resigned as Deputy Secretary of Defense and gave $2 .6 million to the University. His business partner William Hewlett is
currently a Stanford trustee.
substantial part of the basic research
carried out on the campus is under the
financial auspices of the military and is
put to use by firms with Department
of Defense contracts, this policy has
produced a large concentration of
military contractors, particularly
manufacturers of electronic weaponry,
in the Industrial Park.
Stanford's critics cite as additional
evidence of a military-industrial
education complex the presence on
the Stanford Board of Trustees of
Hewlett-Packard co-founder William
R. Hewlett. His H-P colleague, David
Packard, also sat on the Board until
assuming the post of Deputy Secretary
of Defense in 1969.
University Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert R.
Augsburger noted that military uses
were "where technology was 10 years
ago" and predicted that in the next 10
to 15 years "lots of educational
technology and health care technology
corporations will emerge; it will be
important that some of them be at
Stanford to put our theory into
practice. . .. It's conceivable that the
next generation of corporations could
be engaged in very socially worthwhile
enterprises."
Tenants selected by Stanford face
building standards far stricter than
those of the Palo Alto building code.
Detailed schematic drawings of
buildings must be approved by the
Stanford planning staff, a
faculty-student committee, and the

Board of Trustees before the final
lease is agreed upon.
Setback and height limits are more
restrictive than required by law,
parking areas must be hidden by
terrain and landscaping, underground
utilities are required, and buildings
must be well-maintained.
"We want to create a park-like
feeling on Page Mill Road," said
Smith. "The difference between the
city requirements and our
requirements in the difference
between meeting minimum standards
and doing the very best possible."
A 1970 university brochure pointed
out that if financial gain "were the
only consideration, Stanford would be
much wealthier and its standards of
development would be much lower."
University officials point out that
each increment in the Industrial Park
has been approved by local
governmental agencies after full public
hearings.
Dan Willis of the Palo Alto Tenants
Union and Venceremos explained the
view of some critics: "By 'the
community,' Stanford doesn't mean
benefit to the communities where the
workers live, but rather to Palo Alto
and Menlo Park where workers can't
afford to live, and which already have
huge tax bases due to Stanford
development.
"When we talk of the community,
we mean all the communities that
Stanford affects— Redwood City,
Mountain View, Sunnyvale, and so
forth," he noted.

In November 1969 the Committee
for Green Foothills, an environmental
group, brought suit against Stanford in
an attempt to stop expansion of the
Industrial Park across the Foothill
Expressway onto Coyote Hill.
Although their suit has not succeeded,
the litigation has delayed some
development.
The top of Coyote Hill itself has
been placed in the Academic Reserve
and zoned for agriculture, effectively
precluding industrial development
there without a thorough review. Plans
call for development on the flanks to
completely surround the summit itself,
however.
The suit charged that proper
procedures had not been followed in
obtaining industrial zoning for the
land, and that two Palo Alto city
councilmen had conflicts of interest
and should not have taken part in the
decision. One was a Stanford
administrative employee, Frank
Gallagher, Director of Escondido
Village; the other, Jack Wheatley, was
a building contractor who expected to
bid on building projects on Coyote
Hill.
The suit was dismissed by the
Superior Court—the conflict of
interest portion only after the
development was ratified without
Gallagher's and Wheatley's votes. The
plaintiffs are currently appealing the
decision.
Meanwhile, many potential tenants
are reluctant to lease building sites on
Coyote Hill until the suit is finally
resolved. According to Augsburger,
Coyote Hill is the only area currently
available for new industrial tenants.
The financial squeeze on Stanford
is as tight as ever, and with
anti-military and pro-open space
sentiment and support for new
housing development stronger than
ever before, there will be many more
debates over the Stanford Industrial
Park in the years ahead.

resigned as Deputy Secretary of Defense and gave $2 .6 million to the University. His business partner William Hewlett is
currently a Stanford trustee.
substantial part of the basic research
carried out on the campus is under the
financial auspices of the military and is
put to use by firms with Department
of Defense contracts, this policy has
produced a large concentration of
military contractors, particularly
manufacturers of electronic weaponry,
in the Industrial Park.
Stanford's critics cite as additional
evidence of a military-industrial
education complex the presence on
the Stanford Board of Trustees of
Hewlett-Packard co-founder William
R. Hewlett. His H-P colleague, David
Packard, also sat on the Board until
assuming the post of Deputy Secretary
of Defense in 1969.
University Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert R.
Augsburger noted that military uses
were "where technology was 10 years
ago" and predicted that in the next 10
to 15 years "lots of educational
technology and health care technology
corporations will emerge; it will be
important that some of them be at
Stanford to put our theory into
practice. . .. It's conceivable that the
next generation of corporations could
be engaged in very socially worthwhile
enterprises."
Tenants selected by Stanford face
building standards far stricter than
those of the Palo Alto building code.
Detailed schematic drawings of
buildings must be approved by the
Stanford planning staff, a
faculty-student committee, and the

Board of Trustees before the final
lease is agreed upon.
Setback and height limits are more
restrictive than required by law,
parking areas must be hidden by
terrain and landscaping, underground
utilities are required, and buildings
must be well-maintained.
"We want to create a park-like
feeling on Page Mill Road," said
Smith. "The difference between the
city requirements and our
requirements in the difference
between meeting minimum standards
and doing the very best possible."
A 1970 university brochure pointed
out that if financial gain "were the
only consideration, Stanford would be
much wealthier and its standards of
development would be much lower."
University officials point out that
each increment in the Industrial Park
has been approved by local
governmental agencies after full public
hearings.
Dan Willis of the Palo Alto Tenants
Union and Venceremos explained the
view of some critics: "By 'the
community,' Stanford doesn't mean
benefit to the communities where the
workers live, but rather to Palo Alto
and Menlo Park where workers can't
afford to live, and which already have
huge tax bases due to Stanford
development.
"When we talk of the community,
we mean all the communities that
Stanford affects— Redwood City,
Mountain View, Sunnyvale, and so
forth," he noted.

In November 1969 the Committee
for Green Foothills, an environmental
group, brought suit against Stanford in
an attempt to stop expansion of the
Industrial Park across the Foothill
Expressway onto Coyote Hill.
Although their suit has not succeeded,
the litigation has delayed some
development.
The top of Coyote Hill itself has
been placed in the Academic Reserve
and zoned for agriculture, effectively
precluding industrial development
there without a thorough review. Plans
call for development on the flanks to
completely surround the summit itself,
however.
The suit charged that proper
procedures had not been followed in
obtaining industrial zoning for the
land, and that two Palo Alto city
councilmen had conflicts of interest
and should not have taken part in the
decision. One was a Stanford
administrative employee, Frank
Gallagher, Director of Escondido
Village; the other, Jack Wheatley, was
a building contractor who expected to
bid on building projects on Coyote
Hill.
The suit was dismissed by the
Superior Court—the conflict of
interest portion only after the
development was ratified without
Gallagher's and Wheatley's votes. The
plaintiffs are currently appealing the
decision.
Meanwhile, many potential tenants
are reluctant to lease building sites on
Coyote Hill until the suit is finally
resolved. According to Augsburger,
Coyote Hill is the only area currently
available for new industrial tenants.
The financial squeeze on Stanford
is as tight as ever, and with
anti-military and pro-open space
sentiment and support for new
housing development stronger than
ever before, there will be many more
debates over the Stanford Industrial
Park in the years ahead.
(Next: Low- and moderate-income
housing)
Best known and most controversial
of Stanford's land developments is the
Stanford Industrial Park, some 570
acres stretching along Page Mill Road
from El Camino to the foothills.
The Park, Stanford's largest source
of land development income, is
dominated by the light manufacturing
and research facilities of aerospace and
electronics firms.
The Industrial Park had its
beginnings in 1951. Varian Associates
was the first tenant; Hewlett-Packard
followed a year later. (The rationale
for industrial development has been
described in the first and second
articles in this series.)
The development of the Park has
been guided by a 1954 Board of
Trustees statement: "The customary
considerations applying to the
subdivision of lands for utilitarian
purposes will be applied . . . (but)
material gain is not necessarily the
governing factor. .. . The aim of the
development shall be to produce ... a
community of which the University
Trustees and all those who have its
welfare at heart can be proud. ..
Strict Standards
Once it determined to enter the
industrial land development business,
Stanford set strict standards for its
tenants.
Potential occupants are screened
carefully. University Land Resources
Manager Boyd Smith noted, "We've
been very selective. We've turned
down a lot of potential tenants."
Heavy manufacturers and excessive
polluters are not permitted; light and

precision manufacturers and research
and development firms predominate.
University officials point out that,
although not a strict requirement,
some potential mutually beneficial
tie-in with the University weighs
heavily in a potential tenant's favor.
Smith explained, "there are many
important relationships between
companies and the Ihiversity. Faculty
members consult there, students work
there. Many of these companies
provide applications for Stanford's

pure research; that was one of the
major reasons we started the park.
"There is a tremendous
cross-fertilization of ideas. Many of
the tenants give Stanford more in gifts
than they pay in lease fees. . . . The
University has gained at least as much
from the Industrial Park in other areas
as in strict economic terms."
Varian, Hewlett-Packard, and
Applied Technology, three of the
leading electronics firms in the Park,
were founded by Stanford engineering

graduates.
All three firms bear the mark of
Frederick E. Terman, one-time Dean
of Engineering and Provost at
Stanford. Terman was one of the
leading backers of the Industrial Park,
envisioning a community of "technical
scholars" such as that described by
Smith.

group, brought suit against Stanford in
an attempt to stop expansion of the
Industrial Park across the Foothill
Expressway onto Coyote Hill.
Although their suit has not succeeded,
the litigation has delayed some
development.
The top of Coyote Hill itself has
been placed in the Academic Reserve
and zoned for agriculture, effectively
precluding industrial development
there without a thorough review. Plans
call for development on the flanks to
completely surround the summit itself,
however.
The suit charged that proper
procedures had not been followed in
obtaining industrial zoning for the
land, and that two Palo Alto city
councilmen had conflicts of interest
and should not have taken part in the
decision. One was a Stanford
administrative employee, Frank
Gallagher, Director of Escondido
Village; the other, Jack Wheatley, was
a building contractor who expected to
bid on building projects on Coyote
Hill.
The suit was dismissed by the
Superior Court—the conflict of
interest portion only after the
development was ratified without
Gallagher's and Wheatley's votes. The
plaintiffs are currently appealing the
decision.
Meanwhile, many potential tenants
are reluctant to lease building sites on
Coyote Hill until the suit is finally
resolved. According to Augsburger,
Coyote Hill is the only area currently
available for new industrial tenants.
The financial squeeze on Stanford
is as tight as ever, and with
anti-military and pro-open space
sentiment and support for new
housing development stronger than
ever before, there will be many more
debates over the Stanford Industrial
Park in the years ahead.
(Next: Low- and moderate-income
housing)
Best known and most controversial
of Stanford's land developments is the
Stanford Industrial Park, some 570
acres stretching along Page Mill Road
from El Camino to the foothills.
The Park, Stanford's largest source
of land development income, is
dominated by the light manufacturing
and research facilities of aerospace and
electronics firms.
The Industrial Park had its
beginnings in 1951. Varian Associates
was the first tenant; Hewlett-Packard
followed a year later. (The rationale
for industrial development has been
described in the first and second
articles in this series.)
The development of the Park has
been guided by a 1954 Board of
Trustees statement: "The customary
considerations applying to the
subdivision of lands for utilitarian
purposes will be applied . . . (but)
material gain is not necessarily the
governing factor. .. . The aim of the
development shall be to produce ... a
community of which the University
Trustees and all those who have its
welfare at heart can be proud. ..
Strict Standards
Once it determined to enter the
industrial land development business,
Stanford set strict standards for its
tenants.
Potential occupants are screened
carefully. University Land Resources
Manager Boyd Smith noted, "We've
been very selective. We've turned
down a lot of potential tenants."
Heavy manufacturers and excessive
polluters are not permitted; light and

precision manufacturers and research
and development firms predominate.
University officials point out that,
although not a strict requirement,
some potential mutually beneficial
tie-in with the University weighs
heavily in a potential tenant's favor.
Smith explained, "there are many
important relationships between
companies and the Ihiversity. Faculty
members consult there, students work
there. Many of these companies
provide applications for Stanford's

pure research; that was one of the
major reasons we started the park.
"There is a tremendous
cross-fertilization of ideas. Many of
the tenants give Stanford more in gifts
than they pay in lease fees. . . . The
University has gained at least as much
from the Industrial Park in other areas
as in strict economic terms."
Varian, Hewlett-Packard, and
Applied Technology, three of the
leading electronics firms in the Park,
were founded by Stanford engineering

graduates.
All three firms bear the mark of
Frederick E. Terman, one-time Dean
of Engineering and Provost at
Stanford. Terman was one of the
leading backers of the Industrial Park,
envisioning a community of "technical
scholars" such as that described by
Smith.
Military Contracts
Critics of the policy have directed
much of their fire at this point. Since a

CONTROVERSIAL COMPANY—Hewlett-Packard, an electronics firm criticized for its Department of Defense contracts,
was one of the first companies to move into the Stanford Industrial Park. An inspiring example of work-study-get ahead,
the highly successful firm was founded by Stanford engineering grads. Co-founder and ex-trustee David Packard recently
resigned as Deputy Secretary of Defense and gave $2 .6 million to the University. His business partner William Hewlett is
currently a Stanford trustee.
substantial part of the basic research
carried out on the campus is under the
financial auspices of the military and is
put to use by firms with Department
of Defense contracts, this policy has
produced a large concentration of
military contractors, particularly
manufacturers of electronic weaponry,
in the Industrial Park.
Stanford's critics cite as additional
evidence of a military-industrial
education complex the presence on
the Stanford Board of Trustees of
Hewlett-Packard co-founder William
R. Hewlett. His H-P colleague, David
Packard, also sat on the Board until
assuming the post of Deputy Secretary
of Defense in 1969.
University Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert R.
Augsburger noted that military uses
were "where technology was 10 years
ago" and predicted that in the next 10
to 15 years "lots of educational
technology and health care technology
corporations will emerge; it will be
important that some of them be at
Stanford to put our theory into
practice. . .. It's conceivable that the
next generation of corporations could
be engaged in very socially worthwhile
enterprises."
Tenants selected by Stanford face
building standards far stricter than
those of the Palo Alto building code.
Detailed schematic drawings of
buildings must be approved by the
Stanford planning staff, a
faculty-student committee, and the

Board of Trustees before the final
lease is agreed upon.
Setback and height limits are more
restrictive than required by law,
parking areas must be hidden by
terrain and landscaping, underground
utilities are required, and buildings
must be well-maintained.
"We want to create a park-like
feeling on Page Mill Road," said
Smith. "The difference between the
city requirements and our
requirements in the difference
between meeting minimum standards
and doing the very best possible."
A 1970 university brochure pointed
out that if financial gain "were the
only consideration, Stanford would be
much wealthier and its standards of
development would be much lower."
University officials point out that
each increment in the Industrial Park
has been approved by local
governmental agencies after full public
hearings.
Dan Willis of the Palo Alto Tenants
Union and Venceremos explained the
view of some critics: "By 'the
community,' Stanford doesn't mean
benefit to the communities where the
workers live, but rather to Palo Alto
and Menlo Park where workers can't
afford to live, and which already have
huge tax bases due to Stanford
development.
"When we talk of the community,
we mean all the communities that
Stanford affects— Redwood City,
Mountain View, Sunnyvale, and so
forth," he noted.

precision manufacturers and research
and development firms predominate.
University officials point out that,
although not a strict requirement,
some potential mutually beneficial
tie-in with the University weighs
heavily in a potential tenant's favor.
Smith explained, "there are many
important relationships between
companies and the Ihiversity. Faculty
members consult there, students work
there. Many of these companies
provide applications for Stanford's

pure research; that was one of the
major reasons we started the park.
"There is a tremendous
cross-fertilization of ideas. Many of
the tenants give Stanford more in gifts
than they pay in lease fees. . . . The
University has gained at least as much
from the Industrial Park in other areas
as in strict economic terms."
Varian, Hewlett-Packard, and
Applied Technology, three of the
leading electronics firms in the Park,
were founded by Stanford engineering

graduates.
All three firms bear the mark of
Frederick E. Terman, one-time Dean
of Engineering and Provost at
Stanford. Terman was one of the
leading backers of the Industrial Park,
envisioning a community of "technical
scholars" such as that described by
Smith.
Military Contracts
Critics of the policy have directed
much of their fire at this point. Since a

CONTROVERSIAL COMPANY—Hewlett-Packard, an electronics firm criticized for its Department of Defense contracts,
was one of the first companies to move into the Stanford Industrial Park. An inspiring example of work-study-get ahead,
the highly successful firm was founded by Stanford engineering grads. Co-founder and ex-trustee David Packard recently
resigned as Deputy Secretary of Defense and gave $2 .6 million to the University. His business partner William Hewlett is
currently a Stanford trustee.
substantial part of the basic research
carried out on the campus is under the
financial auspices of the military and is
put to use by firms with Department
of Defense contracts, this policy has
produced a large concentration of
military contractors, particularly
manufacturers of electronic weaponry,
in the Industrial Park.
Stanford's critics cite as additional
evidence of a military-industrial
education complex the presence on
the Stanford Board of Trustees of
Hewlett-Packard co-founder William
R. Hewlett. His H-P colleague, David
Packard, also sat on the Board until
assuming the post of Deputy Secretary
of Defense in 1969.
University Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert R.
Augsburger noted that military uses
were "where technology was 10 years
ago" and predicted that in the next 10
to 15 years "lots of educational
technology and health care technology
corporations will emerge; it will be
important that some of them be at
Stanford to put our theory into
practice. . .. It's conceivable that the
next generation of corporations could
be engaged in very socially worthwhile
enterprises."
Tenants selected by Stanford face
building standards far stricter than
those of the Palo Alto building code.
Detailed schematic drawings of
buildings must be approved by the
Stanford planning staff, a
faculty-student committee, and the

Board of Trustees before the final
lease is agreed upon.
Setback and height limits are more
restrictive than required by law,
parking areas must be hidden by
terrain and landscaping, underground
utilities are required, and buildings
must be well-maintained.
"We want to create a park-like
feeling on Page Mill Road," said
Smith. "The difference between the
city requirements and our
requirements in the difference
between meeting minimum standards
and doing the very best possible."
A 1970 university brochure pointed
out that if financial gain "were the
only consideration, Stanford would be
much wealthier and its standards of
development would be much lower."
University officials point out that
each increment in the Industrial Park
has been approved by local
governmental agencies after full public
hearings.
Dan Willis of the Palo Alto Tenants
Union and Venceremos explained the
view of some critics: "By 'the
community,' Stanford doesn't mean
benefit to the communities where the
workers live, but rather to Palo Alto
and Menlo Park where workers can't
afford to live, and which already have
huge tax bases due to Stanford
development.
"When we talk of the community,
we mean all the communities that
Stanford affects— Redwood City,
Mountain View, Sunnyvale, and so
forth," he noted.

In November 1969 the Committee
for Green Foothills, an environmental
group, brought suit against Stanford in
an attempt to stop expansion of the
Industrial Park across the Foothill
Expressway onto Coyote Hill.
Although their suit has not succeeded,
the litigation has delayed some
development.
The top of Coyote Hill itself has
been placed in the Academic Reserve
and zoned for agriculture, effectively
precluding industrial development
there without a thorough review. Plans
call for development on the flanks to
completely surround the summit itself,
however.
The suit charged that proper
procedures had not been followed in
obtaining industrial zoning for the
land, and that two Palo Alto city
councilmen had conflicts of interest
and should not have taken part in the
decision. One was a Stanford
administrative employee, Frank
Gallagher, Director of Escondido
Village; the other, Jack Wheatley, was
a building contractor who expected to
bid on building projects on Coyote
Hill.
The suit was dismissed by the
Superior Court—the conflict of
interest portion only after the
development was ratified without
Gallagher's and Wheatley's votes. The
plaintiffs are currently appealing the
decision.
Meanwhile, many potential tenants
are reluctant to lease building sites on
Coyote Hill until the suit is finally
resolved. According to Augsburger,
Coyote Hill is the only area currently
available for new industrial tenants.
The financial squeeze on Stanford
is as tight as ever, and with
anti-military and pro-open space
sentiment and support for new
housing development stronger than
ever before, there will be many more
debates over the Stanford Industrial
Park in the years ahead.
