# Industrial Park Draws Criticism
## 
### ROBERT BACON Third in a series 
Best known and most controversial
of Stanford's land developments is the
Stanford Industrial Park, some 570
acres stretching along Page Mill Road
from El Camino to the foothills.
The Park, Stanford's largest source
of land development income, is
dominated by the light manufacturing
and research facilities of aerospace and
electronics firms.
The Industrial Park had its
beginnings in 1951. Varian Associates
was the first tenant; Hewlett-Packard
followed a year later. (The rationale
for industrial development has been
described in the first and second
articles in this series.)
The development of the Park has
been guided by a 1954 Board of
Trustees statement: "The customary
considerations applying to the
subdivision of lands for utilitarian
purposes will be applied . . . (but)
material gain is not necessarily the
governing factor. .. . The aim of the
development shall be to produce ... a
community of which the University
Trustees and all those who have its
welfare at heart can be proud. ..
Strict Standards
Once it determined to enter the
industrial land development business,
Stanford set strict standards for its
tenants.
Potential occupants are screened
carefully. University Land Resources
Manager Boyd Smith noted, "We've
been very selective. We've turned
down a lot of potential tenants."
Heavy manufacturers and excessive
polluters are not permitted; light and

precision manufacturers and research
and development firms predominate.
University officials point out that,
although not a strict requirement,
some potential mutually beneficial
tie-in with the University weighs
heavily in a potential tenant's favor.
Smith explained, "there are many
important relationships between
companies and the Ihiversity. Faculty
members consult there, students work
there. Many of these companies
provide applications for Stanford's

pure research; that was one of the
major reasons we started the park.
"There is a tremendous
cross-fertilization of ideas. Many of
the tenants give Stanford more in gifts
than they pay in lease fees. . . . The
University has gained at least as much
from the Industrial Park in other areas
as in strict economic terms."
Varian, Hewlett-Packard, and
Applied Technology, three of the
leading electronics firms in the Park,
were founded by Stanford engineering

graduates.
All three firms bear the mark of
Frederick E. Terman, one-time Dean
of Engineering and Provost at
Stanford. Terman was one of the
leading backers of the Industrial Park,
envisioning a community of "technical
scholars" such as that described by
Smith.
Military Contracts
Critics of the policy have directed
much of their fire at this point. Since a

CONTROVERSIAL COMPANY—Hewlett-Packard, an electronics firm criticized for its Department of Defense contracts,
was one of the first companies to move into the Stanford Industrial Park. An inspiring example of work-study-get ahead,
the highly successful firm was founded by Stanford engineering grads. Co-founder and ex-trustee David Packard recently
resigned as Deputy Secretary of Defense and gave $2 .6 million to the University. His business partner William Hewlett is
currently a Stanford trustee.
