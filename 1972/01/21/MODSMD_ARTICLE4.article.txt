# Tuition To Rise Again As Budget Cuts Continue
## 
### PHIL REVZIN 
Budget plans call for tuition to rise
to $950 per quarter next year, Provost
William Miller told the Faculty Senate
yesterday.
This is an increase of over nine per
cent from this year's $870. Tuition has
risen an average of eight per cent every
year over the past decade.
President Lyman told the meeting
that the Board of Trustees' role in the
Franklin decision should not be given
more importance than was intended in
the Policy on Appointment and
Tenure.
"The Board will review the decision
and concur or not concur in the
penalties," Lyman said. 'The
President's role in the meeting will be

limited. The Board's role is intended
to be removed from campus, and the
participation of the President in the
meeting would be a mistake."
Lyman added that he would be
present at the meeting Saturday, but
would not be present during the
deliberations or voting on the Franklin
decision.
Under questioning from English
Associate Professor Ronald Rebholz,
Lyman said that he had concurred
with the majority opinion of the
Advisory Board report because, "It
seemed to me that the majority made
its case."
Miller's presentation of financial
data covered general income and
expenditures, including information
on the Budget Adjustment Program
(BAP) and tuition increases for
1972-73.
He noted that tuition at the Medical
School will be over $3,000 a year and
business students will pay more than
$3,200.
The Financial Aids Office will try
to compensate for the added costs,
Kenneth Creighton, deputy vice
president for business and finance,
told the Daily. "We're putting in
additional money to maintain the
current relationship between financial
aids and tuition." he said.
"We're still behind the schools we
usually compare ourselves to in the

East," Creighton added. However
Stanford is closing the tuition gap.
Tuition was a mere $220 per
quarter in 1952, rising to $420 in
1962. In 1965 it was $525; in 1968,
$640; in 1969, $710; in 1970, $800.
A general increase in costs,
including faculty and staff salaries, is
pushing up the cost of a Stanford
education, Creighton explained. "The
forecast in the future is that the rate
of increase is likely to be six per cent a
year," he said.
According to Miller's report, the
BAP target for 1972-1973 is
$1,283,000 in income adjustments and
budget reductions.
The report summarized general
recommendations to achieve this goal.
Specific budget estimates will not be
announced until May, when the Board
of Trustees considers the final budget.
Associate Provost Ray Bacchetti
noted that the projected 1972-1973
adjustment would bring the six-year
program to 75 per cent of its total
goal.
Most of the discussion centered
around questions of administrative
costs and long-term goals, and the
upcoming fund-raising drive.
Also at the meeting, Law School
Dean Thomas Ehrlich presented a
report detailing accomplishments in
the fields of instruction and research
in the Law School.

year," he said.
According to Miller's report, the
BAP target for 1972-1973 is
$1,283,000 in income adjustments and
budget reductions.
The report summarized general
recommendations to achieve this goal.
Specific budget estimates will not be
announced until May, when the Board
of Trustees considers the final budget.
Associate Provost Ray Bacchetti
noted that the projected 1972-1973
adjustment would bring the six-year
program to 75 per cent of its total
goal.
Most of the discussion centered
around questions of administrative
costs and long-term goals, and the
upcoming fund-raising drive.
Also at the meeting, Law School
Dean Thomas Ehrlich presented a
report detailing accomplishments in
the fields of instruction and research
in the Law School.
Budget plans call for tuition to rise
to $950 per quarter next year, Provost
William Miller told the Faculty Senate
yesterday.
This is an increase of over nine per
cent from this year's $870. Tuition has
risen an average of eight per cent every
year over the past decade.
President Lyman told the meeting
that the Board of Trustees' role in the
Franklin decision should not be given
more importance than was intended in
the Policy on Appointment and
Tenure.
"The Board will review the decision
and concur or not concur in the
penalties," Lyman said. 'The
President's role in the meeting will be

limited. The Board's role is intended
to be removed from campus, and the
participation of the President in the
meeting would be a mistake."
Lyman added that he would be
present at the meeting Saturday, but
would not be present during the
deliberations or voting on the Franklin
decision.
Under questioning from English
Associate Professor Ronald Rebholz,
Lyman said that he had concurred
with the majority opinion of the
Advisory Board report because, "It
seemed to me that the majority made
its case."
Miller's presentation of financial
data covered general income and
expenditures, including information
on the Budget Adjustment Program
(BAP) and tuition increases for
1972-73.
He noted that tuition at the Medical
School will be over $3,000 a year and
business students will pay more than
$3,200.
The Financial Aids Office will try
to compensate for the added costs,
Kenneth Creighton, deputy vice
president for business and finance,
told the Daily. "We're putting in
additional money to maintain the
current relationship between financial
aids and tuition." he said.
"We're still behind the schools we
usually compare ourselves to in the

East," Creighton added. However
Stanford is closing the tuition gap.
Tuition was a mere $220 per
quarter in 1952, rising to $420 in
1962. In 1965 it was $525; in 1968,
$640; in 1969, $710; in 1970, $800.
A general increase in costs,
including faculty and staff salaries, is
pushing up the cost of a Stanford
education, Creighton explained. "The
forecast in the future is that the rate
of increase is likely to be six per cent a
year," he said.
