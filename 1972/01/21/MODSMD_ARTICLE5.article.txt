# Heavy Vote Favors Franklin's Retention
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
One of the largest groups in ASSU
history turned out Wednesday and
yesterday for the referendum on Bruce
Franklin, and 55 per cent of the voters
indicated they want the suspended
Maoist professor back.
"Resolved: that Professor Bruce Franklin
should be retained as a professor at the
University" was the way the question
read, and 2615 students answered
"yes" while only 2114 said "no."
Only the referendums and ASSU
presidential election of 1970 have
attracted more to the polls; 5749
ballots were cast in that election.
The results correlated closely with a
Daily telephone poll on the question
earlier this week. The poll showed 55
per cent of those expressing an
opinion favored Frankln.
The results of the referendum drew
mixed responses.
Chris Hocker, chairman of the
conservative Free Campus Movement,
wasn't impressed. "There is no reason
for the vote to have any legitimacy
whatsoever," he said. "The students
are not the policy-makers of the
University. All the referendum proves
is that 2600 students out of 12,000
thought that Franklin should be
retained."

On the other hand, Fred Royce of
the Young Crows, who acted as a sort
of campaign manager for the
pro-Franklin forces, was rather
pleased.
"I think it was a substantial
victory—it wasn't a landslide,
obviously," he said.
"It means that when we go to San
Francisco Saturday it will let the
Trustees know that when we meet we
will in fact be the majority opinion at
Stanford."
Ann Kimball of the ASSU Council
of Presidents indicated that she hadn't
conferred with the other three
members of the group, "but our policy
is that we're bound by the vote of the
student body and the referendum
clearly expressed that the desire of the
majority of students is to have Bruce
Franklin as a professor teaching on
this campus."
She said that if the Trustees refuse
to keep Franklin, the Council of
Presidents would investigate the
possibility of hiring him as an "ASSU
Professor."
Elections Commissioner Alice
Furumoto said the elction was "the
best I have run." She said there were
almost no complaints.
