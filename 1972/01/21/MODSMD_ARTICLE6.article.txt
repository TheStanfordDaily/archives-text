## Anti-Imperialists Stage Rally In SF

The New York Times has reported that
"the central purpose" of the recent U.S.
bombing of North Vietnam "is to stave off a
major military setback in Indochina."
As the Pentagon Papers show, Nixon's
"Vietnamization" strategy itself grew out of
previous U.S. defeats in Vietnam. First
Kennedy's "special war" (20,000 U.S.
advisors ,) then Johnson's "limited war"
(500,000 U.S. troops plus massive bombing of
North Vietnam) were defeated by the
National Liberation Front and these defeats,
along with growing G.I. resistance and
growing opposition at home, forced still
another change of strategy.
Nixon's scheme, "Vietnamization," was
designed to produce a military victory in
Vietnam without the severe political and
economic problems caused by limited war.
Nixon hoped to do this by withdrawing a
majority of U.S. troops and turning over the
ground fighting to the Saigon Army (AFiVN),
backed by U.S. technology and airpower. Far
from winding down the war, as he claims,
Nixon has expanded the fighting into
Cambodia and Laos and increased the
bombing.
Nixon's Vietnamization strategy has been
no more successful than have previous U.S.
plans to win in Vietnam. U.S. and local forces
have just suffered major military defeats in
Indochina. In Cambodia and Laos, despite
massive bombing, liberation forces now
control most of the countryside. In South
Vietnam, the ARVN has been unable to either
take military objectives or to hold supposedly
"pacified" territory.
The recent bombing raids on North

Vietnam are a response to these latest
Indochinese peoples' victories. Although they,
like all previous raids on the North and supply
routes, proved ineffectual, Melvin Laird has
said that bombing raids will again be used as a
tactic.
The resistance movement within the
military is growing stronger, forcing the U.S.
military into a state of crisis. The American
anti-war movement must now intensify its
opposition to the continuing U.S. aggression
in Indochina.
On Saturday, January 22, the
Anti-Imperialist Coalition, which is made up
of over a dozen Bay Area groups with
anti-imperialist politics, will be marching
against the air war, in support of the 7-point
peace proposal of the Provisional
Revolutionary Government of South
Vietnam, and in support of the G.I.
movement. We hope that everyone in the Bay
Area who agrees with these three positions
will join us.
The U.S. is an imperialist country. This
means that the monopoly capitalist class (the
large corporation and bank owners) runs this
country through control of the government,
the armed forces, the universities, etc. This
ruling class lives off the labor of American
working people as well as that of working
people around the world. In order to survive,
American imperialism must seize and control
the economies of other countries, especially
underdeveloped Third World countries, thus
profiting from their raw materials, labor and
markets.
The war in Indochina represents the
struggle of these Third World nations against

imperialism. The victories of the Indochinese
peoples, and especially of the NLF, have
shown a way for all oppressed people to
defeat U.S. imperialism. They have also
sparked a political and economic crisis for the
U.S.
The rich of this country are trying to make
the American people pay for imperialism's
defeats. The wage-price freeze plus the lending
of millions to large corporations were an open
declaration of war on the American working
people.
In addition to the economic repression in
the form of rising unemployment and
underemployment and growing inflation,
political repression is on the increase. This is
clear at Stanford. Workers have been fired for
taking part in political demonstrations.
Students who speak out against DoD research
and recruiting are charged by Lyman's illegal
CJB. Bruce Franklin is in the process of being
fired because he is a Marxist-Leninist and thus
constitutes a threat to the ruling elite of the
university.
The Board of Trustees meets Saturday,
January 22, at 600 California Street in San
Francisco to make the final decision on
Franklin's case. People can join the picket
there and then join a Stanford contingent to
march to Union Square where the
Anti-Imperialist Coalition Rally will begin at
noon. From Union Square, the March will go
to the Civic Center.
"Victory for the Indochinese peoples
means victory for poor and oppressed peoples
everywhere."

Union and the Anti-Imperialist Coalition)
