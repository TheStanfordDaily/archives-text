## Future Bleak For Chile Under President Allende 
### 
jed hepworth

I returned to Chile in October
to spend fall quarter in the
country studying. Santiago, the
capital city, seems to have
changed very little in three years.
Only the huge excavations for the
new subway and the signs painted
on walls in garish colors
welcoming Fidel speak of change.
The callampas (slums) that give
way to the rising skyline of
downtown Santiago are a little
bigger, somehow a little more
bitter. But the same Cadillacs and
buses battle the same taxis for
space. Urbane Providencia still
swarms with girls and their
admirers.
The apparent placidity is
deceiving—Chile has changed and
changes every day. Dr. Salvador
Allende's narrow victory in the
1970 elections has led him to
believe that he and his party, the
Unidad Popular, have been given a
mandate for radical change.
To date, the first freely elected
Marxist president in the history of
the hemisphere has pressed for
most of the changes he seeks
within the framework of the
traditional political system. How
long he will be content to remain
within that system, and the results
of his drastic and risky actions are
the issues being debated today in
Chile.
Allende in his first year in
office nationalized Chile's copper

mines, the country's banks, and
the nation's largest industries. The
government accelerated the
agrarian reform to the point that
the latifundia will disappear in
1972. What have been the results?
My concern as a foreigner who
loves Chile is that the Allende
government may mean economic
disaster and the end of Chile's
proud democratic tradition.
Celebrating his government's
first anniversary in power, Allende
spoke in the Estadio Nacional on
November 4. He claimed victories
against American imperialism,
against the nation's monopolistic
industries, against the latifundists,
against inflation and
unemployment. Dr. Allende
promised even greater gains in
production and victories in the
struggle of the people against
capitalism. It sounded great. But
the victories have been as hollow
as I'm afraid Allende's promises
for the future will turn out to be.
Chile nationalized its copper,
refusing to indemnify the
American copper companies
involved. This was an extremely
popular move at home, but very
risky. The United States
immediately withdrew its price
supports and the price of copper
fell 30 percent. The largest market
for Chilean copper suddenly
disappeared, too. Since Chile
depends on copper for 80 percent

of its foreign exchange earnings, it
was a sorry victory.
The "victories" of the Unidad
Popular mean most to the people
of Chile in their effects on the
standard of living. The Allende
government's attempts to control
inflation and stimulate
agricultural production are the
most obvious to the common
people because they see the
results every day in the market.
Chile is an urban society, and
the impatience of the urban poor
is something no politician can
forget. It cost the Christian
Democrats the elections of 1970.
The urban masses want cheap
food, employment, and improved
access to consumer goods. Allende
promised them that and in his
first year set out to make his
promises reality. He increased
wages of government employees
40 percent and froze prices on
basic foodstuffs. The government
proudly claims that meat
consumption went up 18 percent
the first half of 1971 over the
same period in 1970.
Un 112 or t unately , the
consumption of meat dropped at
least as much in the last six
months of 1971, simply because
there was no meat to be bought in
Santiago. Horse meat, since it was
not on the price-freeze list, was
occasionally available, but cost
more per kilo than beef, which

was not available. By December
the shortages had become so
extreme in Santiago that the poor
were reduced to eating tomatoes
and lettuce and other vegetables
in season.
It is very important to
remember that most of the wage
increases and the shortages affect
the poor. The very people that
Allende wanted to help have been
reduced to vegetarians. The
wealthy and the middle class have
more access to meat because

'Failure of the Chilean experiment not only means suffering
exacerbated, it means the end of a unique political atmosphere
which the Chileans have so long fostered and maintained/

either they have freezers and can
store meat, or their local
butchers can bid and charge
more for chickens and horse meat.
The poor who have not storage
facilities or contacts are worse off
than before.
Minister of the Economy
Vuskovic called the shortages of
food "an aberration of the minds
of the rich", but the butcher
shops standing empty belie his

bland assertion that everything is
ail right.
The sad part is that the future
of the food situation looks worse
than the present. Wheat planting
in the spring of 1971 was down to
less than one-half that of 1970.
This was partly due to the
insecurity of the private sector
and partly due to the failure of
the reformed sector (the land
expropriated by the agrarian
reform and currently administered
by government agencies). The

government added to these
problems by severely restricting
imports of vital tractor parts and
certified seed.
Chile's imports of food stuffs
in 1971 amounted to over $300
million and her total export
earnings were only $654 million.
Because of the continuing illegal
occupation of over 130 farms, the
private sector has been terrorized
into sullen inactivity. The Allende
government's unwillingness to
protect private property has left
even small landowners feeling that
their very existence is threatened.
The government's
requisitioning of fat steers at
ruinous prices adds to the
disincentive to invest in
agriculture. Since the private
sector produces around 80
percent of the agricultural output
of Chile, the results of the
destruction of the production of
the private sector are not hard to
imagine.
Public reaction to shortages
and the government's occasionally
blatant efforts to consolidate its

power over the economy and
society has been muted, so far.
Recent events, however, seem to
indicate that the Unidad Popular
and its president have
over-reached themselves.
President Allende received just
36 percent of the vote in the
elections of 1970. He seems to
have ignored the fact that 64
percent voted against him. Just
talking of the opposition as if it
consisted of a few rich oligarchs
does not make it so. The failures
and the aggressions of the Unidad

Popular produced in the last
months of 1971 a quasi-coalition
of the Right and the Christian
Democrats.
The conflict between the
Unidad Popular and the
opposition has surfaced most
violently in the University of
Chile. In late November the
government ignored the presence
in Santiago of 1,500 non-students
who sacked the school of
engineering of the University. The
1,500 members of the Brigada
Ramona Parra of the Communist
Youth were armed with chains,
knives and clubs, but Jose Toha,
the Minister of the Interior,
claimed that only groups of the
Right went about armed.
This conflict in the University
has produced the first signs of a
new political front against the
Unidad Popular. The divisions
that gave the Unidad Popular the
victory in 1970 are disappearing.
The new political front is not
united in ideology, just in
purpose. And the purpose is to
dump the Unidad Popular.

How much support does the
government presently have? The
food shortage demonstrations of
December 1 countered by a mass
meeting of the supporters of the
Unidad Popular mean only that
some people are against the
government and that others
support it.
Allende cannot be
unconscious, however, of the fact
that the paralysis of Santiago's
vital public transportation system
due to lack of spare parts will cost
him votes. It was the government
of the Unidad Popular that cut off
the supply of parts with a 10,000
percent import tax. The lack of
copper-generated income hurts
only Allende's prestige. There is
no doubt that the Unidad Popular
feels threatened by current events
and recent electoral trends such as
the victory of the opposition in
last week's congressional
elections.
The army recently awarded
Allende a replica of the sword of
Bernardo O'Higgins, the father of
the Chilean Republic. It was a
great honor. It also served notice
to the Right that the Army will
support the legally elected
government. But Allende is also
under notice not to blatantly
disregard the provisions of the
constitution.
The Chilean flair for politics
has disappeared and left only fear
and distrust and hatreds. Student
debate has given way to pitched
battles. I wish the best to the
Chilean people, but am saddened
by the changes that have come
over the once optimistic Chileans.
There is a new feeling of malice
that is as sad as it is illustrative of
the new face of Chilean politics.
Chile is in a state of flux. The
changes that come day after day,
the political crises that appear, the
economic disasters that loom; all
are fascinating to the outside
observer. But the fascination
tends to obscure the fact that for
the Chilean people, this is terribly
serious.
Failure of the Chilean
experiment not only means
suffering exacerbated, it means
the end of a unique political
atmosphere which the Chileans
have for so long fostered and
maintained. The ultimate test will
be the willingness of the Left
which won within the system to
face the possibility of electoral
i defeat.

government's attempts to control
inflation and stimulate
agricultural production are the
most obvious to the common
people because they see the
results every day in the market.
Chile is an urban society, and
the impatience of the urban poor
is something no politician can
forget. It cost the Christian
Democrats the elections of 1970.
The urban masses want cheap
food, employment, and improved
access to consumer goods. Allende
promised them that and in his
first year set out to make his
promises reality. He increased
wages of government employees
40 percent and froze prices on
basic foodstuffs. The government
proudly claims that meat
consumption went up 18 percent
the first half of 1971 over the
same period in 1970.
Un 112 or t unately , the
consumption of meat dropped at
least as much in the last six
months of 1971, simply because
there was no meat to be bought in
Santiago. Horse meat, since it was
not on the price-freeze list, was
occasionally available, but cost
more per kilo than beef, which

was not available. By December
the shortages had become so
extreme in Santiago that the poor
were reduced to eating tomatoes
and lettuce and other vegetables
in season.
It is very important to
remember that most of the wage
increases and the shortages affect
the poor. The very people that
Allende wanted to help have been
reduced to vegetarians. The
wealthy and the middle class have
more access to meat because

'Failure of the Chilean experiment not only means suffering
exacerbated, it means the end of a unique political atmosphere
which the Chileans have so long fostered and maintained/

either they have freezers and can
store meat, or their local
butchers can bid and charge
more for chickens and horse meat.
The poor who have not storage
facilities or contacts are worse off
than before.
Minister of the Economy
Vuskovic called the shortages of
food "an aberration of the minds
of the rich", but the butcher
shops standing empty belie his

bland assertion that everything is
ail right.
The sad part is that the future
of the food situation looks worse
than the present. Wheat planting
in the spring of 1971 was down to
less than one-half that of 1970.
This was partly due to the
insecurity of the private sector
and partly due to the failure of
the reformed sector (the land
expropriated by the agrarian
reform and currently administered
by government agencies). The

government added to these
problems by severely restricting
imports of vital tractor parts and
certified seed.
Chile's imports of food stuffs
in 1971 amounted to over $300
million and her total export
earnings were only $654 million.
Because of the continuing illegal
occupation of over 130 farms, the
private sector has been terrorized
into sullen inactivity. The Allende
government's unwillingness to
protect private property has left
even small landowners feeling that
their very existence is threatened.
The government's
requisitioning of fat steers at
ruinous prices adds to the
disincentive to invest in
agriculture. Since the private
sector produces around 80
percent of the agricultural output
of Chile, the results of the
destruction of the production of
the private sector are not hard to
imagine.
Public reaction to shortages
and the government's occasionally
blatant efforts to consolidate its

power over the economy and
society has been muted, so far.
Recent events, however, seem to
indicate that the Unidad Popular
and its president have
over-reached themselves.
President Allende received just
36 percent of the vote in the
elections of 1970. He seems to
have ignored the fact that 64
percent voted against him. Just
talking of the opposition as if it
consisted of a few rich oligarchs
does not make it so. The failures
and the aggressions of the Unidad

Popular produced in the last
months of 1971 a quasi-coalition
of the Right and the Christian
Democrats.
The conflict between the
Unidad Popular and the
opposition has surfaced most
violently in the University of
Chile. In late November the
government ignored the presence
in Santiago of 1,500 non-students
who sacked the school of
engineering of the University. The
1,500 members of the Brigada
Ramona Parra of the Communist
Youth were armed with chains,
knives and clubs, but Jose Toha,
the Minister of the Interior,
claimed that only groups of the
Right went about armed.
This conflict in the University
has produced the first signs of a
new political front against the
Unidad Popular. The divisions
that gave the Unidad Popular the
victory in 1970 are disappearing.
The new political front is not
united in ideology, just in
purpose. And the purpose is to
dump the Unidad Popular.

How much support does the
government presently have? The
food shortage demonstrations of
December 1 countered by a mass
meeting of the supporters of the
Unidad Popular mean only that
some people are against the
government and that others
support it.
Allende cannot be
unconscious, however, of the fact
that the paralysis of Santiago's
vital public transportation system
due to lack of spare parts will cost
him votes. It was the government
of the Unidad Popular that cut off
the supply of parts with a 10,000
percent import tax. The lack of
copper-generated income hurts
only Allende's prestige. There is
no doubt that the Unidad Popular
feels threatened by current events
and recent electoral trends such as
the victory of the opposition in
last week's congressional
elections.
The army recently awarded
Allende a replica of the sword of
Bernardo O'Higgins, the father of
the Chilean Republic. It was a
great honor. It also served notice
to the Right that the Army will
support the legally elected
government. But Allende is also
under notice not to blatantly
disregard the provisions of the
constitution.
The Chilean flair for politics
has disappeared and left only fear
and distrust and hatreds. Student
debate has given way to pitched
battles. I wish the best to the
Chilean people, but am saddened
by the changes that have come
over the once optimistic Chileans.
There is a new feeling of malice
that is as sad as it is illustrative of
the new face of Chilean politics.
Chile is in a state of flux. The
changes that come day after day,
the political crises that appear, the
economic disasters that loom; all
are fascinating to the outside
observer. But the fascination
tends to obscure the fact that for
the Chilean people, this is terribly
serious.
Failure of the Chilean
experiment not only means
suffering exacerbated, it means
the end of a unique political
atmosphere which the Chileans
have for so long fostered and
maintained. The ultimate test will
be the willingness of the Left
which won within the system to
face the possibility of electoral
i defeat.

I returned to Chile in October
to spend fall quarter in the
country studying. Santiago, the
capital city, seems to have
changed very little in three years.
Only the huge excavations for the
new subway and the signs painted
on walls in garish colors
welcoming Fidel speak of change.
The callampas (slums) that give
way to the rising skyline of
downtown Santiago are a little
bigger, somehow a little more
bitter. But the same Cadillacs and
buses battle the same taxis for
space. Urbane Providencia still
swarms with girls and their
admirers.
The apparent placidity is
deceiving—Chile has changed and
changes every day. Dr. Salvador
Allende's narrow victory in the
1970 elections has led him to
believe that he and his party, the
Unidad Popular, have been given a
mandate for radical change.
To date, the first freely elected
Marxist president in the history of
the hemisphere has pressed for
most of the changes he seeks
within the framework of the
traditional political system. How
long he will be content to remain
within that system, and the results
of his drastic and risky actions are
the issues being debated today in
Chile.
Allende in his first year in
office nationalized Chile's copper

mines, the country's banks, and
the nation's largest industries. The
government accelerated the
agrarian reform to the point that
the latifundia will disappear in
1972. What have been the results?
My concern as a foreigner who
loves Chile is that the Allende
government may mean economic
disaster and the end of Chile's
proud democratic tradition.
Celebrating his government's
first anniversary in power, Allende
spoke in the Estadio Nacional on
November 4. He claimed victories
against American imperialism,
against the nation's monopolistic
industries, against the latifundists,
against inflation and
unemployment. Dr. Allende
promised even greater gains in
production and victories in the
struggle of the people against
capitalism. It sounded great. But
the victories have been as hollow
as I'm afraid Allende's promises
for the future will turn out to be.
Chile nationalized its copper,
refusing to indemnify the
American copper companies
involved. This was an extremely
popular move at home, but very
risky. The United States
immediately withdrew its price
supports and the price of copper
fell 30 percent. The largest market
for Chilean copper suddenly
disappeared, too. Since Chile
depends on copper for 80 percent

of its foreign exchange earnings, it
was a sorry victory.

Popular mean most to the people
of Chile in their effects on the
standard of living. The Allende
government's attempts to control

Because of the continuing illegal
occupation of over 130 farms, the
private sector has been terrorized
into sullen inactivity. The Allende
government's unwillingness to
protect private property has left
even small landowners feeling that
their very existence is threatened.
The government's
requisitioning of fat steers at
ruinous prices adds to the
disincentive to invest in
agriculture. Since the private
sector produces around 80
percent of the agricultural output
of Chile, the results of the
destruction of the production of
the private sector are not hard to
imagine.
Public reaction to shortages
and the government's occasionally
blatant efforts to consolidate its

power over the economy and
society has been muted, so far.
Recent events, however, seem to
indicate that the Unidad Popular
and its president have
over-reached themselves.
President Allende received just
36 percent of the vote in the
elections of 1970. He seems to
have ignored the fact that 64
percent voted against him. Just
talking of the opposition as if it
consisted of a few rich oligarchs
does not make it so. The failures
and the aggressions of the Unidad

Popular produced in the last
months of 1971 a quasi-coalition
of the Right and the Christian
Democrats.
The conflict between the
Unidad Popular and the
opposition has surfaced most
violently in the University of
Chile. In late November the
government ignored the presence
in Santiago of 1,500 non-students
who sacked the school of
engineering of the University. The
1,500 members of the Brigada
Ramona Parra of the Communist
Youth were armed with chains,
knives and clubs, but Jose Toha,
the Minister of the Interior,
claimed that only groups of the
Right went about armed.
This conflict in the University
has produced the first signs of a
new political front against the
Unidad Popular. The divisions
that gave the Unidad Popular the
victory in 1970 are disappearing.
The new political front is not
united in ideology, just in
purpose. And the purpose is to
dump the Unidad Popular.

How much support does the
government presently have? The
food shortage demonstrations of
December 1 countered by a mass
meeting of the supporters of the
Unidad Popular mean only that
some people are against the
government and that others
support it.
Allende cannot be
unconscious, however, of the fact
that the paralysis of Santiago's
vital public transportation system
due to lack of spare parts will cost
him votes. It was the government
of the Unidad Popular that cut off
the supply of parts with a 10,000
percent import tax. The lack of
copper-generated income hurts
only Allende's prestige. There is
no doubt that the Unidad Popular
feels threatened by current events
and recent electoral trends such as
the victory of the opposition in
last week's congressional
elections.
The army recently awarded
Allende a replica of the sword of
Bernardo O'Higgins, the father of
the Chilean Republic. It was a
great honor. It also served notice
to the Right that the Army will
support the legally elected
government. But Allende is also
under notice not to blatantly
disregard the provisions of the
constitution.
The Chilean flair for politics
has disappeared and left only fear
and distrust and hatreds. Student
debate has given way to pitched
battles. I wish the best to the
Chilean people, but am saddened
by the changes that have come
over the once optimistic Chileans.
There is a new feeling of malice
that is as sad as it is illustrative of
the new face of Chilean politics.
Chile is in a state of flux. The
changes that come day after day,
the political crises that appear, the
economic disasters that loom; all
are fascinating to the outside
observer. But the fascination
tends to obscure the fact that for
the Chilean people, this is terribly
serious.
Failure of the Chilean
experiment not only means
suffering exacerbated, it means
the end of a unique political
atmosphere which the Chileans
have for so long fostered and
maintained. The ultimate test will
be the willingness of the Left
which won within the system to
face the possibility of electoral
i defeat.

I returned to Chile in October
to spend fall quarter in the
country studying. Santiago, the
capital city, seems to have
changed very little in three years.
Only the huge excavations for the
new subway and the signs painted
on walls in garish colors
welcoming Fidel speak of change.
The callampas (slums) that give
way to the rising skyline of
downtown Santiago are a little
bigger, somehow a little more
bitter. But the same Cadillacs and
buses battle the same taxis for
space. Urbane Providencia still
swarms with girls and their
admirers.
The apparent placidity is
deceiving—Chile has changed and
changes every day. Dr. Salvador
Allende's narrow victory in the
1970 elections has led him to
believe that he and his party, the
Unidad Popular, have been given a
mandate for radical change.
To date, the first freely elected
Marxist president in the history of
the hemisphere has pressed for
most of the changes he seeks
within the framework of the
traditional political system. How
long he will be content to remain
within that system, and the results
of his drastic and risky actions are
the issues being debated today in
Chile.
Allende in his first year in
office nationalized Chile's copper

mines, the country's banks, and
the nation's largest industries. The
government accelerated the
agrarian reform to the point that
the latifundia will disappear in
1972. What have been the results?
My concern as a foreigner who
loves Chile is that the Allende
government may mean economic
disaster and the end of Chile's
proud democratic tradition.
Celebrating his government's
first anniversary in power, Allende
spoke in the Estadio Nacional on
November 4. He claimed victories
against American imperialism,
against the nation's monopolistic
industries, against the latifundists,
against inflation and
unemployment. Dr. Allende
promised even greater gains in
production and victories in the
struggle of the people against
capitalism. It sounded great. But
the victories have been as hollow
as I'm afraid Allende's promises
for the future will turn out to be.
Chile nationalized its copper,
refusing to indemnify the
American copper companies
involved. This was an extremely
popular move at home, but very
risky. The United States
immediately withdrew its price
supports and the price of copper
fell 30 percent. The largest market
for Chilean copper suddenly
disappeared, too. Since Chile
depends on copper for 80 percent

of its foreign exchange earnings, it
was a sorry victory.
The "victories" of the Unidad
Popular mean most to the people
of Chile in their effects on the
standard of living. The Allende
government's attempts to control
inflation and stimulate
agricultural production are the
most obvious to the common
people because they see the
results every day in the market.
Chile is an urban society, and
the impatience of the urban poor
is something no politician can
forget. It cost the Christian
Democrats the elections of 1970.
The urban masses want cheap
food, employment, and improved
access to consumer goods. Allende
promised them that and in his
first year set out to make his
promises reality. He increased
wages of government employees
40 percent and froze prices on
basic foodstuffs. The government
proudly claims that meat
consumption went up 18 percent
the first half of 1971 over the
same period in 1970.
Un 112 or t unately , the
consumption of meat dropped at
least as much in the last six
months of 1971, simply because
there was no meat to be bought in
Santiago. Horse meat, since it was
not on the price-freeze list, was
occasionally available, but cost
more per kilo than beef, which

was not available. By December
the shortages had become so
extreme in Santiago that the poor
were reduced to eating tomatoes
and lettuce and other vegetables
in season.
It is very important to
remember that most of the wage
increases and the shortages affect
the poor. The very people that
Allende wanted to help have been
reduced to vegetarians. The
wealthy and the middle class have
more access to meat because

'Failure of the Chilean experiment not only means suffering
exacerbated, it means the end of a unique political atmosphere
which the Chileans have so long fostered and maintained/

either they have freezers and can
store meat, or their local
butchers can bid and charge
more for chickens and horse meat.
The poor who have not storage
facilities or contacts are worse off
than before.
Minister of the Economy
Vuskovic called the shortages of
food "an aberration of the minds
of the rich", but the butcher
shops standing empty belie his

bland assertion that everything is
ail right.
The sad part is that the future
of the food situation looks worse
than the present. Wheat planting
in the spring of 1971 was down to
less than one-half that of 1970.
This was partly due to the
insecurity of the private sector
and partly due to the failure of
the reformed sector (the land
expropriated by the agrarian
reform and currently administered
by government agencies). The

government added to these
problems by severely restricting
imports of vital tractor parts and
certified seed.
Chile's imports of food stuffs
in 1971 amounted to over $300
million and her total export
earnings were only $654 million.
Because of the continuing illegal
occupation of over 130 farms, the
private sector has been terrorized
into sullen inactivity. The Allende
government's unwillingness to
protect private property has left
even small landowners feeling that
their very existence is threatened.

no doubt that the Unidad Popular
feels threatened by current events
and recent electoral trends such as
the victory of the opposition in
last week's congressional
elections.

Allende a replica of the sword of
Bernardo O'Higgins, the father of
the Chilean Republic. It was a
great honor. It also served notice
to the Right that the Army will
support the legally elected

under notice not to blatantly
disregard the provisions of the
constitution.
The Chilean flair for politics

serious.

I returned to Chile in October
to spend fall quarter in the
country studying. Santiago, the
capital city, seems to have
changed very little in three years.
Only the huge excavations for the
new subway and the signs painted
on walls in garish colors
welcoming Fidel speak of change.
The callampas (slums) that give
way to the rising skyline of
downtown Santiago are a little
bigger, somehow a little more
bitter. But the same Cadillacs and
buses battle the same taxis for
space. Urbane Providencia still
swarms with girls and their
admirers.
The apparent placidity is
deceiving—Chile has changed and
changes every day. Dr. Salvador
Allende's narrow victory in the
1970 elections has led him to
believe that he and his party, the
Unidad Popular, have been given a
mandate for radical change.
To date, the first freely elected
Marxist president in the history of
the hemisphere has pressed for
most of the changes he seeks
within the framework of the
traditional political system. How
long he will be content to remain
within that system, and the results
of his drastic and risky actions are
the issues being debated today in
Chile.
Allende in his first year in
office nationalized Chile's copper

mines, the country's banks, and
the nation's largest industries. The
government accelerated the
agrarian reform to the point that
the latifundia will disappear in
1972. What have been the results?
My concern as a foreigner who
loves Chile is that the Allende
government may mean economic
disaster and the end of Chile's
proud democratic tradition.
Celebrating his government's
first anniversary in power, Allende
spoke in the Estadio Nacional on
November 4. He claimed victories
against American imperialism,
against the nation's monopolistic
industries, against the latifundists,
against inflation and
unemployment. Dr. Allende
promised even greater gains in
production and victories in the
struggle of the people against
capitalism. It sounded great. But
the victories have been as hollow
as I'm afraid Allende's promises
for the future will turn out to be.
Chile nationalized its copper,
refusing to indemnify the
American copper companies
involved. This was an extremely
popular move at home, but very
risky. The United States
immediately withdrew its price
supports and the price of copper
fell 30 percent. The largest market
for Chilean copper suddenly
disappeared, too. Since Chile
depends on copper for 80 percent

of its foreign exchange earnings, it
was a sorry victory.
The "victories" of the Unidad
Popular mean most to the people
of Chile in their effects on the
standard of living. The Allende
government's attempts to control
inflation and stimulate
agricultural production are the
most obvious to the common
people because they see the
results every day in the market.
Chile is an urban society, and
the impatience of the urban poor
is something no politician can
forget. It cost the Christian
Democrats the elections of 1970.
The urban masses want cheap
food, employment, and improved
access to consumer goods. Allende
promised them that and in his
first year set out to make his
promises reality. He increased
wages of government employees
40 percent and froze prices on
basic foodstuffs. The government
proudly claims that meat
consumption went up 18 percent
the first half of 1971 over the
same period in 1970.
Un 112 or t unately , the
consumption of meat dropped at
least as much in the last six
months of 1971, simply because
there was no meat to be bought in
Santiago. Horse meat, since it was
not on the price-freeze list, was
occasionally available, but cost
more per kilo than beef, which

was not available. By December
the shortages had become so
extreme in Santiago that the poor
were reduced to eating tomatoes
and lettuce and other vegetables
in season.
It is very important to
remember that most of the wage
increases and the shortages affect
the poor. The very people that
Allende wanted to help have been
reduced to vegetarians. The
wealthy and the middle class have
more access to meat because

'Failure of the Chilean experiment not only means suffering
exacerbated, it means the end of a unique political atmosphere
which the Chileans have so long fostered and maintained/

either they have freezers and can
store meat, or their local
butchers can bid and charge
more for chickens and horse meat.
The poor who have not storage
facilities or contacts are worse off
than before.
Minister of the Economy
Vuskovic called the shortages of
food "an aberration of the minds
of the rich", but the butcher
shops standing empty belie his

bland assertion that everything is
ail right.
The sad part is that the future
of the food situation looks worse
than the present. Wheat planting
in the spring of 1971 was down to
less than one-half that of 1970.
This was partly due to the
insecurity of the private sector
and partly due to the failure of
the reformed sector (the land
expropriated by the agrarian
reform and currently administered
by government agencies). The

government added to these
problems by severely restricting
imports of vital tractor parts and
certified seed.
Chile's imports of food stuffs
in 1971 amounted to over $300
million and her total export
earnings were only $654 million.
Because of the continuing illegal
occupation of over 130 farms, the
private sector has been terrorized
into sullen inactivity. The Allende
government's unwillingness to
protect private property has left
even small landowners feeling that
their very existence is threatened.
The government's
requisitioning of fat steers at
ruinous prices adds to the
disincentive to invest in
agriculture. Since the private
sector produces around 80
percent of the agricultural output
of Chile, the results of the
destruction of the production of
the private sector are not hard to
imagine.
Public reaction to shortages
and the government's occasionally
blatant efforts to consolidate its

power over the economy and
society has been muted, so far.
Recent events, however, seem to
indicate that the Unidad Popular
and its president have
over-reached themselves.
President Allende received just
36 percent of the vote in the
elections of 1970. He seems to
have ignored the fact that 64
percent voted against him. Just
talking of the opposition as if it
consisted of a few rich oligarchs
does not make it so. The failures
and the aggressions of the Unidad

Popular produced in the last
months of 1971 a quasi-coalition
of the Right and the Christian
Democrats.
The conflict between the
Unidad Popular and the
opposition has surfaced most
violently in the University of
Chile. In late November the
government ignored the presence
in Santiago of 1,500 non-students
who sacked the school of
engineering of the University. The
1,500 members of the Brigada
Ramona Parra of the Communist
Youth were armed with chains,
knives and clubs, but Jose Toha,
the Minister of the Interior,
claimed that only groups of the
Right went about armed.
This conflict in the University
has produced the first signs of a
new political front against the
Unidad Popular. The divisions
that gave the Unidad Popular the
victory in 1970 are disappearing.
The new political front is not
united in ideology, just in
purpose. And the purpose is to
dump the Unidad Popular.

How much support does the
government presently have? The
food shortage demonstrations of
December 1 countered by a mass
meeting of the supporters of the
Unidad Popular mean only that
some people are against the
government and that others
support it.
Allende cannot be
unconscious, however, of the fact
that the paralysis of Santiago's
vital public transportation system
due to lack of spare parts will cost
him votes. It was the government
of the Unidad Popular that cut off
the supply of parts with a 10,000
percent import tax. The lack of
copper-generated income hurts
only Allende's prestige. There is
no doubt that the Unidad Popular
feels threatened by current events
and recent electoral trends such as
the victory of the opposition in
last week's congressional
elections.
The army recently awarded

Bernardo O'Higgins, the father of

office nationalized Chile's copper

mines, the country's banks, and
the nation's largest industries. The
government accelerated the
agrarian reform to the point that
the latifundia will disappear in
1972. What have been the results?
My concern as a foreigner who
loves Chile is that the Allende
government may mean economic
disaster and the end of Chile's
proud democratic tradition.
Celebrating his government's
first anniversary in power, Allende
spoke in the Estadio Nacional on
November 4. He claimed victories
against American imperialism,
against the nation's monopolistic
industries, against the latifundists,
against inflation and
unemployment. Dr. Allende
promised even greater gains in
production and victories in the
struggle of the people against
capitalism. It sounded great. But
the victories have been as hollow
as I'm afraid Allende's promises
for the future will turn out to be.
Chile nationalized its copper,
refusing to indemnify the
American copper companies
involved. This was an extremely
popular move at home, but very
risky. The United States
immediately withdrew its price
supports and the price of copper
fell 30 percent. The largest market
for Chilean copper suddenly
disappeared, too. Since Chile
depends on copper for 80 percent

of its foreign exchange earnings, it
was a sorry victory.
The "victories" of the Unidad
Popular mean most to the people
of Chile in their effects on the
standard of living. The Allende
government's attempts to control
inflation and stimulate
agricultural production are the
most obvious to the common
people because they see the
results every day in the market.
Chile is an urban society, and
the impatience of the urban poor
is something no politician can
forget. It cost the Christian
Democrats the elections of 1970.
The urban masses want cheap
food, employment, and improved
access to consumer goods. Allende
promised them that and in his
first year set out to make his
promises reality. He increased
wages of government employees
40 percent and froze prices on
basic foodstuffs. The government
proudly claims that meat
consumption went up 18 percent
the first half of 1971 over the
same period in 1970.
Un 112 or t unately , the
consumption of meat dropped at
least as much in the last six
months of 1971, simply because
there was no meat to be bought in
Santiago. Horse meat, since it was
not on the price-freeze list, was
occasionally available, but cost
more per kilo than beef, which

was not available. By December
the shortages had become so
extreme in Santiago that the poor
were reduced to eating tomatoes
and lettuce and other vegetables
in season.
It is very important to
remember that most of the wage
increases and the shortages affect
the poor. The very people that
Allende wanted to help have been
reduced to vegetarians. The
wealthy and the middle class have
more access to meat because

'Failure of the Chilean experiment not only means suffering
exacerbated, it means the end of a unique political atmosphere
which the Chileans have so long fostered and maintained/

either they have freezers and can
store meat, or their local
butchers can bid and charge
more for chickens and horse meat.
The poor who have not storage
facilities or contacts are worse off
than before.
Minister of the Economy
Vuskovic called the shortages of
food "an aberration of the minds
of the rich", but the butcher
shops standing empty belie his

bland assertion that everything is
ail right.
The sad part is that the future
of the food situation looks worse
than the present. Wheat planting
in the spring of 1971 was down to
less than one-half that of 1970.
This was partly due to the
insecurity of the private sector
and partly due to the failure of
the reformed sector (the land
expropriated by the agrarian
reform and currently administered
by government agencies). The

government added to these
problems by severely restricting
imports of vital tractor parts and
certified seed.
Chile's imports of food stuffs
in 1971 amounted to over $300
million and her total export
earnings were only $654 million.
Because of the continuing illegal
occupation of over 130 farms, the
private sector has been terrorized
into sullen inactivity. The Allende
government's unwillingness to
protect private property has left
even small landowners feeling that
their very existence is threatened.
The government's
requisitioning of fat steers at
ruinous prices adds to the
disincentive to invest in
agriculture. Since the private
sector produces around 80
percent of the agricultural output
of Chile, the results of the
destruction of the production of
the private sector are not hard to
imagine.
Public reaction to shortages
and the government's occasionally
blatant efforts to consolidate its

power over the economy and
society has been muted, so far.
Recent events, however, seem to
indicate that the Unidad Popular
and its president have
over-reached themselves.
President Allende received just
36 percent of the vote in the
elections of 1970. He seems to
have ignored the fact that 64
percent voted against him. Just
talking of the opposition as if it
consisted of a few rich oligarchs
does not make it so. The failures
and the aggressions of the Unidad

Popular produced in the last
months of 1971 a quasi-coalition
of the Right and the Christian
Democrats.
The conflict between the
Unidad Popular and the
opposition has surfaced most
violently in the University of
Chile. In late November the
government ignored the presence
in Santiago of 1,500 non-students
who sacked the school of
engineering of the University. The
1,500 members of the Brigada
Ramona Parra of the Communist
Youth were armed with chains,
knives and clubs, but Jose Toha,
the Minister of the Interior,
claimed that only groups of the
Right went about armed.
This conflict in the University
has produced the first signs of a
new political front against the
Unidad Popular. The divisions
that gave the Unidad Popular the
victory in 1970 are disappearing.
The new political front is not
united in ideology, just in
purpose. And the purpose is to
dump the Unidad Popular.

How much support does the
government presently have? The
food shortage demonstrations of
December 1 countered by a mass
meeting of the supporters of the
Unidad Popular mean only that
some people are against the
government and that others
support it.
Allende cannot be
unconscious, however, of the fact
that the paralysis of Santiago's
vital public transportation system
due to lack of spare parts will cost
him votes. It was the government
of the Unidad Popular that cut off
the supply of parts with a 10,000
percent import tax. The lack of
copper-generated income hurts
only Allende's prestige. There is
no doubt that the Unidad Popular
feels threatened by current events
and recent electoral trends such as
the victory of the opposition in
last week's congressional
elections.
The army recently awarded
Allende a replica of the sword of
Bernardo O'Higgins, the father of
the Chilean Republic. It was a
great honor. It also served notice
to the Right that the Army will
support the legally elected
government. But Allende is also
under notice not to blatantly
disregard the provisions of the
constitution.
The Chilean flair for politics
has disappeared and left only fear
and distrust and hatreds. Student
debate has given way to pitched
battles. I wish the best to the
Chilean people, but am saddened
by the changes that have come
over the once optimistic Chileans.
There is a new feeling of malice
that is as sad as it is illustrative of
the new face of Chilean politics.
Chile is in a state of flux. The
changes that come day after day,
the political crises that appear, the
economic disasters that loom; all
are fascinating to the outside
observer. But the fascination
tends to obscure the fact that for
the Chilean people, this is terribly
serious.
Failure of the Chilean
experiment not only means
suffering exacerbated, it means
the end of a unique political
atmosphere which the Chileans
have for so long fostered and
maintained. The ultimate test will
be the willingness of the Left
which won within the system to
face the possibility of electoral
i defeat.
