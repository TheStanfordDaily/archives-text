Editor, THE DAILY:
The credibility of student
elections and referenda has
reached a new low. I believe that
the current referendum cannot be
considered valid.
On Wednesday, at about 10:55
at the Physics Tank, I was amazed
to see balloting taking place with
practically no regulation. The
ballot box was on the ground with
a large stack of ballots sitting on
it. People were freely coming up,
taking a ballot, voting and placing
it in the box.
The only regulation that was
apparent to me was someone
standing there urging people to
sign their names and ID numbers
on a sheet of paper so that there
would be an accurate record of
who voted! No one was required
to show any identification to pick
up a ballot and vote.
The area was quite crowded
because it was between classes,
and it seemed that good faith was
the only thing requiring people to
sign their names. I didn't watch
long enough to determine whether
people were or weren't signing,
and I didn't see anyone take more
than one ballot. But I do know
that it would have been easy for
anyone to vote without
identifying themselves and then
go to another polling place and
vote again.
I don't know how long this
went on, and I don't know if any
illegal votes were actually cast,
but the lack of enforcement of
the systematic procedures at one
polling place made a mockery of
our whole election system.
Even if there are the same
number of ballots as signatures

and all of the signatures are valid,
the efforts of those people who
are earnestly working to establish
the right of students to have a real
voice in governing the university
have been damaged.
Steve Gilula,

Editor, THE DAILY:
Every once in awhile a
committee position opens which
has the potential of being very
important in terms of Stanford's
direction. Such positions are now
open on the Ad Hoc Senate
Committee on the Professoriate
and the Committee of Fifteen.
The Ad Hoc Senate Committee
on the Professoriate will deal with
policies of hiring, advancements
and non-advancements of faculty
members at Stanford. When the
charge was originally drafted, no
students were included in the
membership. A little rational
dialogue convinced most Senate
members that such an omission
was a mistake. Two students will
sit on the committee.
The Committee will not
consider specific cases, but it will
define general policy. For
example, the case of H. Bruce
Franklin will not be considered
but the general policy question of
firing a faculty member because
of his political beliefs may be.
If students are really concerned
abou the future direction of
education at Stanford, the tenure
policy is a crucial area. This
committee will probably delineate
the role of teaching in faculty
evaluation, an issue which should
strike most undergraduates close
to home. Ann Kimball,

to home. Ann Kimball,
ASSU Council of Presidents
Editor, THE DAILY:
The credibility of student
elections and referenda has
reached a new low. I believe that
the current referendum cannot be
considered valid.
On Wednesday, at about 10:55
at the Physics Tank, I was amazed
to see balloting taking place with
practically no regulation. The
ballot box was on the ground with
a large stack of ballots sitting on
it. People were freely coming up,
taking a ballot, voting and placing
it in the box.
The only regulation that was
apparent to me was someone
standing there urging people to
sign their names and ID numbers
on a sheet of paper so that there
would be an accurate record of
who voted! No one was required
to show any identification to pick
up a ballot and vote.
The area was quite crowded
because it was between classes,
and it seemed that good faith was
the only thing requiring people to
sign their names. I didn't watch
long enough to determine whether
people were or weren't signing,
and I didn't see anyone take more
than one ballot. But I do know
that it would have been easy for
anyone to vote without
identifying themselves and then
go to another polling place and
vote again.
I don't know how long this
went on, and I don't know if any
illegal votes were actually cast,
but the lack of enforcement of
the systematic procedures at one
polling place made a mockery of
our whole election system.
Even if there are the same
number of ballots as signatures

and all of the signatures are valid,
the efforts of those people who
are earnestly working to establish
the right of students to have a real
voice in governing the university
have been damaged.

Every once in awhile a
committee position opens which
has the potential of being very
important in terms of Stanford's
direction. Such positions are now
open on the Ad Hoc Senate
Committee on the Professoriate
and the Committee of Fifteen.
The Ad Hoc Senate Committee
on the Professoriate will deal with
policies of hiring, advancements
and non-advancements of faculty
members at Stanford. When the
charge was originally drafted, no
students were included in the
membership. A little rational
dialogue convinced most Senate
members that such an omission
was a mistake. Two students will
sit on the committee.
The Committee will not
consider specific cases, but it will
define general policy. For
example, the case of H. Bruce
Franklin will not be considered
but the general policy question of
firing a faculty member because
of his political beliefs may be.
If students are really concerned
abou the future direction of
education at Stanford, the tenure
policy is a crucial area. This
committee will probably delineate
the role of teaching in faculty
evaluation, an issue which should
strike most undergraduates close
to home. Ann Kimball,
