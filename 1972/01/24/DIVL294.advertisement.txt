Lyman Statement
The following is the text of President Richard W. Lyman's
statement to the press after the Trustee decision on the
Franklin case.
This has been a long drawn-out affair, and it has understandably
aroused a lot of strong feelings, on all sides.
Much of the discussion about the decision of the faculty Advisory
Board has centered on the possible effects of this decision, for good or
ill, on other campuses across the nation. No one can hope to give an
accurate prediction about that. What we have tried to do at Stanford
is to proceed with the most careful attention to the spirit and the
letter of the University's policies and procedures for such matters.
Those policies and procedures were established and shaped, largely by
the Stanford faculty itself, long before the Franklin case began.
But I would like to venture one prediction. It is that in future
years, what will turn out to have been most influential about this
decision will be the text of the Advisory Board decision itself, and
particularly those parts of that text that deal with such general issues
as the proper standards to be applied. On these crucial questions,
incidentally, the Advisory Board was unanimous. The relationships
between civil law and university regulations; the nature of a faculty
member's responsibilities, and the extent to which his responsibilities
extend to his behavior outside the classroom-on these and other
matters the Stanford faculty Advisory Board has said things that
people will be reading and from which they will be benefitting long
after the particular details of this case have been forgotten.
Just one further point. Some-including several who strongly
support the decision, but for what seem to me the wrong
reasons-insist that Prof. Franklin is being disciplined because of his
opinions, not his behavior. On this 1 would like to quote from the
faculty Board's decision:
" Diversity of political views is a great asset to the University. The
charges here, however, are incitement to use of unlawful coercion and
violence and increasing the danger of injury to others as means to
achieving Professor Franklin's goals; it is that behavior, not his
political views and their expressions, which we judge unacceptable."
1 think that this decision will stand as a landmark in a difficult but
essential effort for higher education; to distinguish between the
protected free expression of ideas, no matter how repugnant to how
many people, and a license to wield any weapon and exploit any
opening to attack and bring to a halt the functioning of one of the
greatest strongholds of free expression in the world today-the
American university.
