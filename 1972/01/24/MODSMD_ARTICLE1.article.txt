# Coaching Staff Depleted
## Christiansen Faces Task 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
In his first official working day as
Stanford's new head football coach,
Jack Christiansen today will
immediately face the problem of
completely rebuilding a coaching staff
which has only two other remaining
members from last season.
Defensive coordinator Bob
Gambold has joined John Ralston at
Denver and Max McCartney, Roger
Theder and Bill Dickey will follow
fellow former assistant Mike White to
Berkeley as he assumes the head
coaching job at California.
Only freshman coach Bill Moultrie
and offensive backfield coach Dave
Currey remain, and, in a press
conference Friday afternoon,
Christiansen admitted that finding a
capable group of assistants is a top
priority concern.
"This week I'll try to get a coaching
staff together as quickly as possible. It
takes the right combination of coaches
and players to win. It takes all types of
coaches, good coaches who are only
average recruiters and good recruiters
who are only average coaches. A lot of
good coaches are looking for jobs . .."
(For a complete account of
Christiansen's comments at Friday's
press conference, see page 7.)
Christiansen accepted the head
coaching position on Friday morning
after White announced he had turned
down the job to take a similar post at
California.
White Picks Cal
White had apparently turned down
the job when it was offered to him by
President Richard Lyman Thursday,
after a 12-man search committee had
decided on White during a long
meeting Wednesday. Christiansen, the
committee's second choice, was
contacted in Denver Thursday night
after spending the day working with
Ralston, and he took the offer under
consideration during a sleepless
Thursday night.
Then on Friday morning, an hour
and a half after White made his official
announcement, Stanford Sports
Information Director Bob Murphy
announced that Christiansen had
phoned from Denver and accepted the
job.
A few hours after Christiansen had
finished his press conference Friday
afternoon, Dave Maggard was named
as California's new athletic director
and he immediately made the official
announcement of White's
appointment. The 32-year-old Maggard
stepped down as Cal track coach when
he was named athletic director,
replacing Ray Wilsey who resigned on
Tuesday as both football coach and
acting athletic director, when he
discovered that he would not be
named permanent athletic director.
White steps into a California
football program which was filled with
problems last season. Last fall Cal
decided to use two football players,
Isaac Curtis and Larry Brumsey, who
had failed to take the NCAA required
1.6 grade point average eligibility test
and as a result, Cal was placed on
indefinite probation by the NCAA and
the Pacific-8 became the Pacific-7 as
the league refused to count Cal's
games in the official football
standings.
Title Taken Away
Curtis had previously competed as a
freshman on Cal's 1970 track team
coached by Maggard and when his

ineligibility was discovered, Cal's
national track championship from that
year was taken away by the NCAA.
But Cal's athletic department stood
behind his and Brumsey's participation
last season and on Friday Maggard said
that "They will be allowed to compete
in the future. We have made a
committment to them and that
committment stands."
Under terms of the NCAA censure,
Cal will be ineligible for any NCAA
championship event for a period of a
year after Curtis and Brumsey end
their varsity careers. According to a
story in yesterday's San Francisco
Examiner, the two may have played
their last game for Cal last November
20 in the Big Game in Stanford
Stadium.
According to the Examiner story,
Curtis and Brumsey were in San Diego
this weekend and they are expected to
file transfer papers at San Diego State
within the month.
Challenge Relished
White apparently relished the
challenge his new position at his alma
mater will offer and Friday said, "Just
as Don Bunce did not particularly like
being compared with Jim Plunkett, 1
guess I'm not too anxious to be
compared with John (Ralston)."
Christiansen also feels his new
position will be extremely challenging.
"It's going to be a lot of hard work. I
guess. It's kind of a tough act to
follow. We do have an awful lot of
work to do to keep it up ... I just feel
glad to get the job. It'll be a great
challenge; it's a great opportunity."
When Ralston was appointed as
Stanford's head coach in 1963, he was
a third choice behind Bud Wilkinson
and Wayne Hardin and on Friday

Christiansen reflected on his
second-choice status. "Nine out of ten
coaches are second choices. Bud
Wilkinson has been offered the job
everywhere. Maybe I was ahead in
some people's minds." (See players'
reaction story on page 7.)
The 43-year-old Christiansen has
spent four years here since being fired
as head coach of the San Francisco
49ers following the 1967' season. He
first worked with Stanford's
linebackers and then spent two years
with Jim Plunkett and the offensive
backs. This past season he returned to
defense, coaching the defensive backs
who allowed only four touchdown
passes all year.
The 35-year-old White had been a
Stanford assistant since 1964. During
the past few seasons, he had been
offensive line coach and offensive
coordinator, and had been responsible
for most of Stanford's offensive game
plans.
