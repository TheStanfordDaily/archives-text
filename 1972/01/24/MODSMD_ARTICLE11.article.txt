# Begins In The Womb
## Growing Up Sexist 
### Ann Rendall 
Sex-typed behavior is learned
behavior. Children are taught and
socialized by sexist grammar
school teachers, but it begins far
earlier than that.
"It begins in the womb when
everyone assumes you want a
boy," says one mother ... and
again at birth, when parents dress
tneir newborn daughter in pink
and son in blue, the beginning of
the socialization of boys to be
"masculine" and of girls to be
"feminine."
Society presents young children
with molds to which they are
expected to adapt themselves.
Aren't Mom and Dad helpful
though! They help their baby to
conform!
If the baby is a girl, she will be
dressed in pink frilly dresses and
ribbons, picked up and spoken to
more, encouraged to be passive,
protected to a greater degree; in
short, she will have more
dependence instilled in her from
the beginning.
If the baby is a boy then he will
naturally have to be dressed in
blue, encouraged to be aggressive,
independent. His natural
inquisitiveness will not be stifled.
At birth it is an open question
what little boy blue will be doing
in twenty-five years. Any number
of options are open to him.
But for his sister in pink, it is a
pretty good bet that she will be
cleaning house, cooking, sewing,
performing the duties every
housewife knows so well. And
chances are she will accept her lot.
School
When a child starts school, the
kindergarten teacher puts at
her/his disposal various toys
games and puzzles. Little girls go
to the dolls and doll houses,
crayons, scissors, books, and
watercolors. Much of their time is
spent playing "house," imitating
Mommy.
Little boys are more apt to be
attracted to blocks, tinker toys,
trucks, puzzles, and
outdoor athletic games, the more
active pastimes. The previous
socialization which mtikes them
do this is re-inforced by the
teacher.
Boisterousness and even
destructiveness or bullying are
likely to be explained away by the
trite "Boys will be boys!"
Not only does a child learn that
there is a difference in the way
girls and boys are supposed to act,
but she/he learns also that little

girls are supposed to look up to
little boys. The boys make
decisions while little girls sit
passively and admire them.
Little children notice sex
differences in parental behavior as
well. Daddy is gone to work all
day and Mommy stays home.
Daddy can do a lot of things that
Mommy can't do. That's the way
it's supposed to be.
It is in the first grade that a
child normally begins to learn to
read. A whole new world of sexist
training opens up to the young
child. Research and statistical
studies on children's readers has
uncovered many interesting and
explanatory facts.
Male characters in children's
books outnumber female
characters by nearly three to one.
Girls are depicted as being helpless
and "feminine" dressed in frilly
clothing, playing with dolls, the
ideal image of girlhood. Boys are
aggressive, stoic, strong and hardy,
again our "model" boy.
Adult men in children's
literature are daddies, but they are
first and foremost doctors,
lawyers, politicians, engineers, etc.
Adult women are just mommies
who stay indoors, wear dresses
(NEVER pants) wash dishes,
vacuum, wear an apron, and
SMILE.
Advocates of the nature
argument think women are
inherently more passive and less
intelligent than males. But until
mid-teens girls surpass boys at
most learning skills, so that could
hardly be the case.
Rather it is that around
puberty girls suppress their
intelligence.
Puberty
Whatever limited freedoms a
girl has are snatched away at
puberty, when her priorities are
forced to change. Now instead of
being with the boys she is after
them. Every thought and action is
geared toward snaring a
boyfriend.
She wonders how she looks.
Does her appearance please HIM?
She puts make-up on daily to
impress HIM, to enhance her
boy-catching power. She is
preparing herself for womanhood,
and everybody knows you just
CAN'T be a woman without a
husband!
College for the young woman
today is a definite possibility, and
EVEN recommended (she must be
able to carry on at least

semi-intelligent conversations with
her husband and his fri' nds.) It is
still not thought to be as
important as an education for her
brother.
He is supposed to be there
acquiring future career skills. She
is not to become too deeply
involved academically. She is
there to get a husband.
Marriage
Why is it that women get
married with such predictability?
Social pressure reinforcing some
twenty years of rigid sexist
conditioning is the reason. Most
succumb to it.
For a woman to remain single
and have a career in our society is
considered proof of her inability
to love a man. Women who work
when it's not financially necessary
are thought to be sick,
over-wraught, or just plain weird.
To change woman's situation a
drastic change in attitude is
necessary. The worst enemies a
liberation-aspiring woman has are
not men. They are the attitudes
and ideas she has about her
feminity, about being the weaker
sex, the fair sex, about her alleged
lower intelligence and incapability
to do "man's work."
The liberation of women would
also mean liberation of their
opposite-sex oppressors. Society
doesn't give total freedom of
choice to men either.
They are discouraged from
taking an interest in cooking,
sewing, childcare, and other
"feminine" activities. They must
not cry or show too much
tenderness.
Proper education must begin in
infancy. Parents must be made
aware of the crippling effect that
sexist social channeling has.
In addition, to the need for
parental awareness and concern,
children's media (readers, picture
books, television series, and
movies) need to be revamped and

the sexist flavoring extracted.
In the future we will hopefully
see in children's media more
women that are not exclusively
mommies, women that have jobs,
and women with their identities
and independence left intact.
Let's break the cycle which has
caused generations of women to
stay at home, cook, clean, sew,
change diapers, look pretty, and
admire their men. And be
PASSIVE??!

Proper education must begin in
infancy. Parents must be made
aware of the crippling effect that
sexist social channeling has.
In addition, to the need for
parental awareness and concern,
children's media (readers, picture
books, television series, and
movies) need to be revamped and

the sexist flavoring extracted.
In the future we will hopefully
see in children's media more
women that are not exclusively
mommies, women that have jobs,
and women with their identities
and independence left intact.
Let's break the cycle which has
caused generations of women to
stay at home, cook, clean, sew,
change diapers, look pretty, and
admire their men. And be
PASSIVE??!
(Ann Rendall is a junior in
anthropology.)
Sex-typed behavior is learned
behavior. Children are taught and
socialized by sexist grammar
school teachers, but it begins far
earlier than that.
"It begins in the womb when
everyone assumes you want a
boy," says one mother ... and
again at birth, when parents dress
tneir newborn daughter in pink
and son in blue, the beginning of
the socialization of boys to be
"masculine" and of girls to be
"feminine."
Society presents young children
with molds to which they are
expected to adapt themselves.
Aren't Mom and Dad helpful
though! They help their baby to
conform!
If the baby is a girl, she will be
dressed in pink frilly dresses and
ribbons, picked up and spoken to
more, encouraged to be passive,
protected to a greater degree; in
short, she will have more
dependence instilled in her from
the beginning.
If the baby is a boy then he will
naturally have to be dressed in
blue, encouraged to be aggressive,
independent. His natural
inquisitiveness will not be stifled.
At birth it is an open question
what little boy blue will be doing
in twenty-five years. Any number
of options are open to him.
But for his sister in pink, it is a
pretty good bet that she will be
cleaning house, cooking, sewing,
performing the duties every
housewife knows so well. And
chances are she will accept her lot.
School
When a child starts school, the
kindergarten teacher puts at
her/his disposal various toys
games and puzzles. Little girls go
to the dolls and doll houses,
crayons, scissors, books, and
watercolors. Much of their time is
spent playing "house," imitating
Mommy.
Little boys are more apt to be
attracted to blocks, tinker toys,
trucks, puzzles, and
outdoor athletic games, the more
active pastimes. The previous
socialization which mtikes them
do this is re-inforced by the
teacher.
Boisterousness and even
destructiveness or bullying are
likely to be explained away by the
trite "Boys will be boys!"
Not only does a child learn that
there is a difference in the way
girls and boys are supposed to act,
but she/he learns also that little

girls are supposed to look up to
little boys. The boys make
decisions while little girls sit
passively and admire them.
Little children notice sex
differences in parental behavior as
well. Daddy is gone to work all
day and Mommy stays home.
Daddy can do a lot of things that
Mommy can't do. That's the way
it's supposed to be.
It is in the first grade that a
child normally begins to learn to
read. A whole new world of sexist
training opens up to the young
child. Research and statistical
studies on children's readers has
uncovered many interesting and
explanatory facts.
Male characters in children's
books outnumber female
characters by nearly three to one.
Girls are depicted as being helpless
and "feminine" dressed in frilly
clothing, playing with dolls, the
ideal image of girlhood. Boys are
aggressive, stoic, strong and hardy,
again our "model" boy.
Adult men in children's
literature are daddies, but they are
first and foremost doctors,
lawyers, politicians, engineers, etc.
Adult women are just mommies
who stay indoors, wear dresses
(NEVER pants) wash dishes,
vacuum, wear an apron, and
SMILE.
Advocates of the nature
argument think women are
inherently more passive and less
intelligent than males. But until
mid-teens girls surpass boys at
most learning skills, so that could
hardly be the case.
Rather it is that around
puberty girls suppress their
intelligence.
Puberty
Whatever limited freedoms a
girl has are snatched away at
puberty, when her priorities are
forced to change. Now instead of
being with the boys she is after
them. Every thought and action is
geared toward snaring a
boyfriend.
She wonders how she looks.
Does her appearance please HIM?
She puts make-up on daily to
impress HIM, to enhance her
boy-catching power. She is
preparing herself for womanhood,
and everybody knows you just
CAN'T be a woman without a
husband!
College for the young woman
today is a definite possibility, and
EVEN recommended (she must be
able to carry on at least

semi-intelligent conversations with
her husband and his fri' nds.) It is
still not thought to be as
important as an education for her
brother.
He is supposed to be there
acquiring future career skills. She
is not to become too deeply
involved academically. She is
there to get a husband.
Marriage
Why is it that women get
married with such predictability?
Social pressure reinforcing some
twenty years of rigid sexist
conditioning is the reason. Most
succumb to it.
For a woman to remain single
and have a career in our society is
considered proof of her inability
to love a man. Women who work
when it's not financially necessary
are thought to be sick,
over-wraught, or just plain weird.
To change woman's situation a
drastic change in attitude is
necessary. The worst enemies a
liberation-aspiring woman has are
not men. They are the attitudes
and ideas she has about her
feminity, about being the weaker
sex, the fair sex, about her alleged
lower intelligence and incapability
to do "man's work."
The liberation of women would
also mean liberation of their
opposite-sex oppressors. Society
doesn't give total freedom of
choice to men either.
They are discouraged from
taking an interest in cooking,
sewing, childcare, and other
"feminine" activities. They must
not cry or show too much
tenderness.
Proper education must begin in
infancy. Parents must be made
aware of the crippling effect that
sexist social channeling has.
In addition, to the need for
parental awareness and concern,

over-wraught, or just plain weird.
To change woman's situation a
drastic change in attitude is
necessary. The worst enemies a
liberation-aspiring woman has are
not men. They are the attitudes
and ideas she has about her
feminity, about being the weaker
sex, the fair sex, about her alleged
lower intelligence and incapability
to do "man's work."
The liberation of women would
also mean liberation of their
opposite-sex oppressors. Society
doesn't give total freedom of
choice to men either.
They are discouraged from
taking an interest in cooking,
sewing, childcare, and other
"feminine" activities. They must
not cry or show too much
tenderness.
Proper education must begin in
infancy. Parents must be made
aware of the crippling effect that
sexist social channeling has.
In addition, to the need for
parental awareness and concern,
children's media (readers, picture
books, television series, and
movies) need to be revamped and

the sexist flavoring extracted.
In the future we will hopefully
see in children's media more
women that are not exclusively
mommies, women that have jobs,
and women with their identities
and independence left intact.
Let's break the cycle which has
caused generations of women to
stay at home, cook, clean, sew,
change diapers, look pretty, and
admire their men. And be
PASSIVE??!
(Ann Rendall is a junior in
anthropology.)
Sex-typed behavior is learned
behavior. Children are taught and
socialized by sexist grammar
school teachers, but it begins far
earlier than that.
"It begins in the womb when
everyone assumes you want a
boy," says one mother ... and
again at birth, when parents dress
tneir newborn daughter in pink
and son in blue, the beginning of
the socialization of boys to be
"masculine" and of girls to be
"feminine."
Society presents young children
with molds to which they are
expected to adapt themselves.
Aren't Mom and Dad helpful
though! They help their baby to
conform!
If the baby is a girl, she will be
dressed in pink frilly dresses and
ribbons, picked up and spoken to
more, encouraged to be passive,
protected to a greater degree; in
short, she will have more
dependence instilled in her from
the beginning.
If the baby is a boy then he will
naturally have to be dressed in
blue, encouraged to be aggressive,
independent. His natural
inquisitiveness will not be stifled.
At birth it is an open question
what little boy blue will be doing
in twenty-five years. Any number
of options are open to him.
But for his sister in pink, it is a
pretty good bet that she will be
cleaning house, cooking, sewing,
performing the duties every
housewife knows so well. And
chances are she will accept her lot.
School
When a child starts school, the
kindergarten teacher puts at
her/his disposal various toys
games and puzzles. Little girls go
to the dolls and doll houses,
crayons, scissors, books, and
watercolors. Much of their time is
spent playing "house," imitating
Mommy.
Little boys are more apt to be
attracted to blocks, tinker toys,
trucks, puzzles, and
outdoor athletic games, the more
active pastimes. The previous
socialization which mtikes them
do this is re-inforced by the
teacher.
Boisterousness and even
destructiveness or bullying are
likely to be explained away by the
trite "Boys will be boys!"
Not only does a child learn that
there is a difference in the way
girls and boys are supposed to act,
but she/he learns also that little

girls are supposed to look up to
little boys. The boys make
decisions while little girls sit
passively and admire them.
Little children notice sex
differences in parental behavior as
well. Daddy is gone to work all
day and Mommy stays home.
Daddy can do a lot of things that
Mommy can't do. That's the way
it's supposed to be.
It is in the first grade that a
child normally begins to learn to
read. A whole new world of sexist
training opens up to the young
child. Research and statistical
studies on children's readers has
uncovered many interesting and
explanatory facts.
Male characters in children's
books outnumber female
characters by nearly three to one.
Girls are depicted as being helpless
and "feminine" dressed in frilly
clothing, playing with dolls, the
ideal image of girlhood. Boys are
aggressive, stoic, strong and hardy,
again our "model" boy.
Adult men in children's
literature are daddies, but they are
first and foremost doctors,
lawyers, politicians, engineers, etc.
Adult women are just mommies
who stay indoors, wear dresses
(NEVER pants) wash dishes,
vacuum, wear an apron, and
SMILE.
Advocates of the nature
argument think women are
inherently more passive and less
intelligent than males. But until
mid-teens girls surpass boys at
most learning skills, so that could
hardly be the case.
Rather it is that around
puberty girls suppress their
intelligence.
Puberty
Whatever limited freedoms a
girl has are snatched away at
puberty, when her priorities are
forced to change. Now instead of
being with the boys she is after
them. Every thought and action is
geared toward snaring a
boyfriend.
She wonders how she looks.
Does her appearance please HIM?
She puts make-up on daily to
impress HIM, to enhance her
boy-catching power. She is
preparing herself for womanhood,
and everybody knows you just
CAN'T be a woman without a
husband!
College for the young woman
today is a definite possibility, and
EVEN recommended (she must be
able to carry on at least

semi-intelligent conversations with
her husband and his fri' nds.) It is
still not thought to be as
important as an education for her
brother.
He is supposed to be there
acquiring future career skills. She
is not to become too deeply
involved academically. She is
there to get a husband.
Marriage
Why is it that women get
married with such predictability?
Social pressure reinforcing some
twenty years of rigid sexist
conditioning is the reason. Most
succumb to it.
For a woman to remain single
and have a career in our society is
considered proof of her inability
to love a man. Women who work
when it's not financially necessary
are thought to be sick,
over-wraught, or just plain weird.

drastic change in attitude is
