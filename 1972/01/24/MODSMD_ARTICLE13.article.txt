## Chisholm Talks On Women's Politics 
### EMMA PRICE 
Shirley Chisholm, candidate for
President of the United States,
spoke last week to an overflow
crowd at Mills College on the
subject of "Women in Politics."
"In the field of politics I have
found more discrimination against
me as a woman than as a black,"
she declared. "Men in American
society can't accept women in
politics." Chisholm is currently in
the House of Representatives,
where she represents Brooklyn.
"After being in politics for
twenty-one years in the company
of gentlemen politicians," she said
with heavy sarcasm, "I have now
come to the conclusion that if the
country is going to be turned
around, we're going to have to
have much more input into the
political process by women."
"I've had to work behind
scenes because I am a woman. I've
been a ghost write; in politics.
People look at me and merely
because I am a woman they say
'step back.' I will not step back
until poor hungry children can
have three meals a day."
Black Parallel
Chisholm drew parallels
between the position of women
and the position of blacks. She
quoted St. Paul as saying "Let
women learn in silence" and
Nietzsche as saying "When a
woman is inclined toward learning
then there is something wrong
with her apparatus."
"I think we have to recognize
that many of these things are said
because there are prescribed roles
for women just as there are for
blacks," she explained.
"Women have to realize that
nobody's going to give us
anything just as the blacks have
realized," she added. "They're not
going to pay attention to women
until women get involved and

unbrainwashed. Right now we end
up each year where we were
before â€” powerless."
"This isn't a fight between men
and women, though," she pointed
out. "America is at a crossroads.
It's going to take men and men
and women of all races, put
together not in a melting pot, but
in a salad bowl."
More Congresswomen
Chisholm wishes there were
more women Representatives. "I
have often wished that there were
women in power to give me a
hand."
Chisholm feels however that
women are finally beginning to be
heard. "I just came in from
Florida," she said. "It marvels me
to see how other Democratic
aspirers are talking about women.
They've been running for office
forever and ever and now they're
talking about women. They're
scared of women now."
Chisholm stated that she now
has organizations in twenty-seven
states. She has not yet decided
whether or not to run in the
California primary. "I could be
number three or four in California
if I could get the money to run,"
she said. Chisholm will definitely
enter the Wisconsin, North
Carolina and Florida primaries.


CANDIDATE for President Shirley Chisholm, the only black woman
in Congress, called for men and women of all races to mix together
"not in a melting pot, but in a salad bowl" to solve America's
problems in a speech in Oakland last week.
