To the Editor:
This evening I was dining in a
restaurant in Palo Alto when I
happened to glance at the wall
and see the following notice:
Tips received by female and
minor employees are used as
credit against their minimum
wage, but not exceeding 20c per
hour worked.
Seldom have I been so shocked.
A clearer case of discrimination
based on sex and age could not
exist. That women and children
should be paid twelve percent less
than men for the exact same work
violates all principles of justice.
