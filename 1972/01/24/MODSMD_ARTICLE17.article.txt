# Lyman Assesses, Defends Franklin Ouster
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
(President Richard W. Lyman declined to publicly
discuss the Franklin case during the period of hearings and
deliberations. In his first major interview after the
Trustees made Franklin s ouster final, Lyman talked at his
home yesterday with Daily Editor-in-chief Fred Mann and
Associate F.ditor Larn' Liebert.)

In your statement Saturday, you wrote that some
people were supporting Franklin's dismissal "for what
seem to me to be the wrong reasons." Were you referring
to the editorials across the nation or to letters from
alumni?
Virtually all of the editorials I've seen that supported
us were thoughtful and did draw the line between
prosecution for opinions or advocacy of radical views on
the one hand, and prosecution for incitement that would
run severe risks of injury to people, on the other.
What I really had reference to was some letters from
people who usually don't give any indication of any
connections with Stanford at all.
There is fear that this decision will be used as a
precedent to stifle dissent, particularly in small
midwestern colleges. Are you at all afraid of this?
1 don't think you can take a significant action in a field
like this, in which there is a great paucity of case record,

without the likelihood of producing results elsewhere, one
way or another.
1 stick by my statements that if the decision is read
carefully—even if you end up disagreeing with it—l do not
see how you can come out with the conclusion that it is a
mandate for purges based on radical opinion. In fact,
there are a great many safeguards against that in the
decision. The decision is likely to prove very helpful to
institutions that may not have thought these problems
through.
I cannot help questioning the benefit of the sort of
self-fulfilling prophecy that we are getting from a few
faculty and some leaders of the "rehab movement" and so
on . . . where they say this will unleash the storm
elsewhere. Their own reading of the decision is more likely
to encourage people to that than a direct reading of the
decision.
It seems to me a little odd to shed crocodile tears over
the possible impact in West Podunk State, and at the same
time take every opportunity to distort the question.
There is an awful lot of off-the-top-of-the-head
responding, starting with the Faculty Political Action
Group's amazing statement at Bruce's first press
conference, before they could have conceivably read the
decision, that it was "outrageous." They could have
waited eight hours and read it, at least.
Simply to condemn the decision sweepingly, as Daniel
Ellsberg did in Memorial Church, is extremely unlikely to
produce any good result in West Podunk State, if that's
what you're really worried about.
Do you feel you have any personal responsibility to see
that the decision is not distorted at other schools?
I haven't a concrete plan for addressing myself to any
particular segment of higher education, but I certainly see
a necessity for me to underline with every emphasis at my
command the fact that I believe that what I am dealing
with and what the Advisory Board is dealing with is
behavior and not dissident opinion.
What have your personal feelings been in this case? Are
you ever sorry you got into the whole thing?
In one sense, I feel I'm sorry I'm in the whole business
of being an academic administrator at a time when that's a
very unattractive kind of job in many ways. Nobody
enjoys this kind of thing, academic people probably less
than almost any other kind of person. Say what you will,
you cannot see this kind of affair as simply an easy matter
of employer-employee relations and terminating an
unsatisfactory employee.
Robert Minge Brown, chairman of the Trustees, used
exactly those terms Saturday.
Mister Brown did. I disagree with him.
There are much more fundamental issues at question
than that. The whole spirit and ethic of a faculty is based
on a professional view.
Do you have any personal admiration for Franklin?
After the decision, administration lawyer Ray Fisher
called him a "very intelligent and remarkable person."
I would very much like to avoid getting into
personalities. He certainly has formidable intellectual
equipment, and he is and can be at times a very attractive
personality.
Franklin maintains he is no longer barred from campus
by last year's injunction.
Your lawyers have refused to comment on that.
It's really a lawyer's question. I've told them they must
come to grips with it.
Do you find it objectionable that Franklin continues to
come on campus?
I never have had any desire to keep what Bruce
Franklin thinks about the world from the Stanford
student body or the Stanford community. He's saying
what he thinks about it in Columbae and so on.
I do not regard his ideas as nearly as dangerous as he
regards them. Along with Steve Weissman, with whom I
often don't agree, I think Prof. Franklin's version of
Marxism is old-fashioned and over-simplified.
I think, furthermore, that sophisticated and perceptive
versions of the Marxist view of the world are important to

have represented on the university campus. And that this
country has had too little of it.
But what relation that has with urging people to go and
attack parts of the University is another problem.
Chairman Mao says that theory cannot be separated
from practice. What about Franklin's contention that his
revolutionary theories cannot be accurately taught unless
they are also acted upon on campus?
I don't see why, in order to get the full flavor of a
given ideology, you need to have a person acting out
whatever consequences may come from that ideology.
In an academic setting, if you're going to study
Marxism seriously, you're more likely to get a serious
reading of it from someone who is not devoting major
portions of time and energy to what he imagines to be
revolutionary tactics at the moment.
I think all the talk about the "mind-body problem" is
really a red herring across the trail. Is he then going to say
that we can't study war at a university without going and
getting into one? As soon as you go down this rather
simple line, linking action with thought, thought
somehow gets left out before you've gone very far.
People aren't thinking when they're running in a
screaming mob, yelling for somebody's blood. They may
be having a kind of experiential education, but there are

all sorts of experiential education that I wouldn't want
to see reproduced on a university campus.
I've undergone some myself as an enlisted man in the
Army. If you're looking for ironies, there's
one—Lieutenant Franklin and Sergeant Lyman.
Isn't the "ivory tower" view of the university
disingenuous, considering involvement with Defense
Department research and the like?
It's a question of definition, delineation, and degree.
I've never maintained that any university or college ever
existed outside of the context of its surrounding society.
It is arguable that, for better or worse, American
universities have become more involved with this society
than universities in many other times and places have
done.
I'm not arguing that students ought to remove
themselves from the world of actions just because they're
in the university.
But I don't see why that requires that I admit that a
student should be free to attack the university itself and
to halt its functioning.
Is Franklin's ouster made meaningless by his continued
teaching at Columbae?
We obviously have a system at Stanford that very
freely permits people to bring in guest lecturers from
anywhere.
Exactly where the line gets drawn between having a
guest lecturer 10 percent of the time and 90 percent of
the time—how you wrestle with these questions—is
obviously a problem that will take some time to sort out.

"I do not regard his ideas as nearly as dangerous
as he regards them ... I think [his] version of
Marxism is old-fashioned and over-simplified."

Did you consider bringing criminal charges against
Franklin instead of the dismissal charges?
I can't say that I never asked any questions about that.
But 1 can say that we viewed the question largely as an
intra-university matter.
What if Franklin succeeds in overturning his dismissal
in the civil courts?
I just think that's so extravagantly unlikely, that I find
that very hard to answer. I really think there has been so
much first-rate legal thinking about this (question) that
doesn't see that as a danger and so much third-rate legal
thinking that does.
Critics argue that the Advisory Board punished
Franklin for speeches which could not be punished in a
criminal trial—that he could not say things on campus
which he could say on a street in San Francisco.
The Board's opinion tries to draw the distinctions
between the state and the university. They're trying to say
that the university is different—that in some ways it is
more protective and more encouraging of dissident
opinion than the society at large, but in some other
respects it is more restrictive because it has more limited
purposes.
I don't agree that we should limit ourselves to the
criminal code, and go that way for all discipline. Such
things as the disruptions of class—which we've seen a little
of in the last week—are not covered under the law
anywhere. Yet it seems to me any serious academic person
would regard that as one of the most serious kinds of
infringements you can have of the university's way of
doing things.
The decision seems to emphasize professors' special
duties as leaders of students.
Professor Franklin was quite remarkably eloquent
about that in the course of the hearings when he was
talking about his role as a professor. He said he wasn't
pleased with these facts, but that as a professor he had a
very considerable influence.
For a man who likes to tell the rest of us how elitist we

are, it was a very remarkable profession of how he views
his own role vis-a-vis students.
Franklin's personal views are clearly brought into the
decision when the Advisory Board discusses his "pattern
of conduct" and whether he can be "rehabilitated."
1 think the Advisory Board was extraordinarily
courageous in getting into this, as they did where they
talk about Franklin's perception of the world. They must
have known that that would be seized upon.
1 think what they were doing was something they had
to do. They had to face up to the question: "Is there
anything in the record to give one hope that he has either
learned something about the limits of proper behavior or
has changed his mind at all about the legitimacy of
attacking the institution by any means he can use?"
They didn't see, given the gulf in perceptions, any
likelihood at all of that. Now, the dissenters did see some
likelihood, but they didn't seem to me to provide any
evidence of that.
You're really put in a bind if the argument is that my
perception of the world requires that I kick you in the
shins every time 1 meet you. If you finally decide that you
don't want to be kicked in the shins every time that you
meet somebody, and you take some kind of measures to
prevent that—well, then you're attacking perceptions.
The ACLU brief argued that Franklin has the right to
go "up to the line" separating advocacy from incitement.
The Advisory Board commented that this makes
incitement a way of life—if you take the position that you
are going to see how close you can come.
The whole question is where is the line, really. I don't
think any reasonable person would deny the right to go
up to the line you are setting. The question is where is it
and when is it overstepped.
I think there's a fair amount of intellectual confusion
about the benefits of going up to the line of incitement.
The romantic picture that people are going to learn a lot
more by seeing how close you can come to the line that
separates advocacy and incitement, that doesn't hold
much water.

You're really put in a bind if the argument is
that my perception of the world requires me to
kick you in the shins everytime I meet you.

Have you read Chairman Mao?
I can't say I've made any serious study of Chairman
Mao. I have read some. I think that tends to be a mine
from which people can extract any ore they are looking
for.
I've read more Marx than Mao. I have in the past read a
lot of Marx and Lenin and so on. I don't consider myself
very up to date in the latest scholarship, however.
What brought about the Lodge charge, which was
unanimously rejected by the Advisory Board? Who first
said, "Let's charge Franklin."?
Gee, I really can't remember whether anybody said it
to me. I think it was obvious from the first reports that
the issue had to be faced.
I think the early reports certainly suggested he was
right in the middle of it and doing all of the various
actions which were brought out in the charges.
I would like to say that I remember distinctly in several

conversations in those early days, saying we must make
every effort we can to ask ourselves, "are we proceeding
because it's Bruce Franklin, or would we proceed if it
were some professor who had no previous record of
agitation or involvement in the Movement?"
What do you think of the comment by ACLU Legal
Director Paul Halvonik that the University used the Lodge
incident as a "clever ploy" to obscure the incitement
charges?
That is a dirty crack.
Is there any chance that Franklin would not have been
charged for the Feb. 10 speeches if the Lodge incident
had not occurred earlier?
I don't think so. Practically nobody can recapture at
this point the sense of the campus on Feb. 10, 1971.
The Advisory Board opinion was right that the
Administration was confronted with what they called "an
agonizing decision" when the Comp Center was
occupied—just about the most agonizing decision I've ever
had to make. That's because of the well-known context of
events elsewhere, where other computation centers have
been occupied, and because of the expressed willingness
of at least some of the people to undertake destruction of
the computer. That would involve the destruction of
thousands of man-hours of people's lives.
The crowd at the Comp Center seemed calm to those
on the scene.
Peoples' mood in a crowd is very volatile. That is one
of the fundamental problems in this whole area: the
administrative authorities are always put in a terribly
defensive position because they known the volatility and
the rapidity with which things can change. They also
know the danger of personal injury and the exploitation
of any personal injury that takes place.
Why did the administration not inform the public

before the occupation that the controversial Gamut-H
project was no longer running on the computer?
Provost Miller knew that the immediately operational
people on the program had told him they were not
running it anymore. But he had not had categorical
assurance from the management of SRI that it would not
be run.
I did not know that it wasn't running until the
afternoon of the occupation itself. We sent a message over
to the occupation that we knew this. They wanted a more
categorical statement from me. I honestly felt I was in no
position to do that; we had not had that sort of assurance
from SRl's top people. If I made ringing declarations
about it and then found out the thing quietly started up
again, then what kind of accusations of hypocrisy would I
have been faced with?
People tend to overlook the Advisory Board's criticism
of the Movement for hanging on to the information about
Gamut-H until a tactical moment and then suddenly
springing it.
Has David Packard sent you his reaction to the
dismissal. How about other influential alumni?
I haven't heard anything from him, nothing either
orally or by letter. I've been going through the letters of
reaction, either congratulations or condemnation—reading
them all, but not lingering over them.
There have been some from some alumni whom I
know.
People have said, "How can the university judge
whether Franklin should be dismissed when
administrators say it's too complicated to decide which
recruiters should be banned for military involvement?"
I think it would be infinitely more difficult than the
Advisory Board hearings to judge the overall record of a
major corporation that's involved in a lot of different
activities and try to strike a moral balance sheet about
that corporation. I don't take the view that any
involvementwhatsoever in weapons manufacture is in and
of itself grounds for excluding a corporation.
As rumored, did administrators once before go to the
Advisory Board with possible charges against Franklin,
only to be told by the Board that the charges wouldn't
stick?
There was an episode, I think it was at the time of the
attempted sit-in against the CIA recruiter (December,
1968), when the then-Dean of Humanities and Sciences
wrote a letter to the Advisory Board which asked them to
consider questions of appropriate faculty behavior. I
wrote a note saying I supported his inquiry. But it was not
an attempt to bring charges against anybody. It was an
attempt—as I look back on it, a rather muddled one—to
ask the Advisory Board to spell out for the benefit of
faculty how they felt about some of the actions of that
day.
Was it Franklin whose actions were being considered?
Yes. He was holding a class over by the sit-in, and there
were some people who thought that was exploiting and
manipulating students; to require them to come over, even
if most of them were willing to come to the scene of the
action.
But nothing came of it because the Advisory Board
took the view that, given their role to hold a hearing if
asked by a defendant, they didn't want to get into that
kind of question unless there were a formal set of charges.
Have other college presidents asked you about the
case?
University presidents of my acquaintance have

followed this case with great interest. I think the
overwhelming feeling expressed is that they were pleased
to see such a serious effort made to define the extent and
limits of faculty responsibility. Their impression was that
we had gone to very great lengths to provide due process
and so on.
What about those who say this whole thing must have
something to do with a university that is trying to raise
$260 million?
If I believed that a given faculty member were within
his rights in making the assertions he was making, no
flood of alumni mail and no amount of distress among the
fund-raisers that I could conceive of would move me to
action. It wouldn't be worth $260 million to sell the
University's soul.
Of course, the climate of opinion has mattered in
fund-raising. The very widespread opinion in thecountry
that universities were simply not facing up to these
problems has hurt. That can't help being on one's mind,
but for a person who has grown up in the academic line,
there is the immediate counter-pressure. You're going to
be at least as afraid of allowing yourself to be pressured
by extraneous circumstances into doing the wrong thing.
There are reports of professors being dismissed now at
some other colleges. What makes this the time for
house-cleaning?
One doesn't pick the time. Universities in the last few
years developed a new set of problems about the behavior
of some of their people. 1 don't think there's ever been
any analogue for it.
Universities must have, and be able to use, institutional
mechanisms that can cope with these problems when they
are serious. I thought that the University had not shown
itself able to cope in the last couple of years [before his
term as president |.
