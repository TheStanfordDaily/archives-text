# Harris, Manganiello
## Franklin's Firing Hit 
### BOB VINING 
Venceremos central committee
chairman Aaron Manganiello and
former Stanford student body
president David Harris spoke at a
Memorial Church rally called to
support fired English Professor H.
Bruce Franklin. The rally was attended
by over 650 people.
Harris declared that in the Advisory
Board report recommending Franklin's
firing, "seven learned men had taken
approximately 180 pages to decide
that Bruce Franklin was guilty of
being Bruce Franklin."
"At the same time," Harris said
"those seven learned men have said
nothing about the fact that it's proper
for a man to be a trustee of Stanford
University when he's made himself a
small personal fortune burning the
skin off eight-year-old children in
Vietnam."
Harris asserted that the Trustees,
who approved the Advisory Board
recommendation on Saturday, were
"all nice people" who "all believe their
actions are good because their
intentions are."
Manganiello emphasized that no
single group or person in the
revolutionary movement can claim to
act exclusively for the people. He said
Franklin understood "people power"
in these terms. Manganiello lauded the

fired revolutionary professor's
"dedication to Third World
leadership."
ASSU Council of Presidents
member Ann Kimball suggested at the
rally that students could hire Franklin
themselves if court action proved
unsatisfactory.
"If that fails, then the ASSU
intends to investigate means of having
the students hire Bruce themselves.
That... would be one of the most
eloquent condemnations of the
University administration that could
be made." Other speakers at the rally
were freshman Rosie Wolf and
Assistant German Professor Ann
Snow.
Trustee Denis Hayes, a 1969
Stanford graduate, propsed a tuition
strike to force Franklin's rehiring.
Addressing a Friday afternoon meeting
in Cubberley Auditorium, Hayes said
"if one fourth of the student boyd
withheld tuition, it would cost the
University $3 million, and I'd be
surprised if the University didn't come
across."
Hayes was the only trustee to
accept the Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement's invitation to an open
meeting on campus. Approximately
120 people attended the meeting.
Hayes is one of the two youngest
members of the Board of Trustees.
