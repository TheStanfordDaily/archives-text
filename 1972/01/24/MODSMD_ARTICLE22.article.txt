# Card Hoopsters Dumped By Utah
## 
### 
Stanford lost its third straight
game on the road Saturday to
Utah, 80-68. Although the Indians
led at halftime, 42-41, the Utah
zone defense came to life in the
second half and held the Cards to
five points in final seven and a
half minutes to propel the Utes to
their ninth win in fourteen starts.
Claude Terry led the Stanford
offense with 29 points, 15 coming
before the intermission. While
Terry topped all scorers, all five of
Utah's starters hit double figures
with forward Scott Jones
sustaining the Utes' second half
rally by scoring 14 of his 17
points in the closing period.
Utes Go Ahead
With the score tied at 63-63,

Jones put the Utes ahead to stay
on a corner jump shot with 6:46
to go in the game. Utah's defense
thwarted Stanford's attack for the
remainder of the game, while the
team outscored the Indians, 17-5,
in the final minutes of play.
The combination of Utah's
surging offensive rally and tight

zone defense which caused 27
Stanford turnovers while
committing only 11 proved too
much for the slumping Cards.
Stanford is now 6-8 on the season.
Senior guard Bob Nicholson
pumped in 11 points and Mike
Mann scored nine in the Indians'
losing effort.
