# New Coach Answers Some Questions
## 
### 
Soon after accepting the head football
coach's job by telephone from Denver, Jack
Christiansen flew into San Francisco and held
a press conference in the airport Friday
afternoon. The following is a summary of the
major questions and answers from the
conference.
Who will go to the Rose Bowl next
year?—The team that wins the conference.
Seriously, what is the outlook for next
year's team?— We'll be strong in certain areas.
In other areas we'll have to do some
rebuilding. We lost seven starters on defense
and six on offense. Redshirts should help in
the offensive line and at the linebacking
positions.
What is the current recruiting
situation?— We were ahead of last year in
recruiting until these coaching changes
occurred. At Rose Bowl time, we were much
farther ahead. We've already presented a list
of possible junior college transfers to the
admissions office and we got the green light
on 10 out of 15 prospects. We'll now go full
speed ahead on these people. I like to think
we got an early start. We anticipated the Rose
Bowl and went to work earlier.
Will a lot of the players Mike White and
some of the other assistants were recruiting go
with them to California?— Probably 90% of
recruits are mostly interested in the
institution and not the coaches. 10% can get
talked in or out of going to a school by a
coach. It's always a possibility that losing the
coaches to Cal may be a factor in our
recruiting.
How do you feel about the recent NCAA
rule change which will allow freshmen to

compete at the varsity level in football next
fall?—The NCAA rule change surprised
everyone. I don't think very many freshmen
will compete on the varsity level. Maybe there
will be a handful and maybe we'll get a few.
The freshman year in college is a big
adjustment period.
What will your basic style of play be like
next year?—l plan to continue a wide-open
type of football, interesting not only to the
fans, who pay most of the bills, but also to
the players. We'll be throwing the football
mainly and running when we have to. We'll
continue with the same kind of defense. The
Pacific-8 will continue to be a passing type
conference next season. So we will use a lot of
pro defenses and continue with a wide open
offense.
How will you approach the head coaching
job?- When I'm in the office or on the field
I'm going to work. I don't think you have to
work 24 hours a day to be a winner. I don't
think my life will change that much. I believe
in a nice, relaxed summer.
Will you work specifically with any one
area of your team?—l don't want to get to a
point where I'm not working with the kids.
Most likely I'll stay in the area of
quarterbacks.
How do you evaluate Mike Boryla, the
leading quarterback candidate for next
season?—He has a great arm. He has good size
and good quickness. He is smart and wants to
play and he wants to be good. He lacks only
experience. In the first three games against
San Jose State, Duke and West Virginia, we'll
try to give him enough experience before he

has to face USC. He will prove to be a great
quarterback.
Do you intend to move John Winesberry
back to a running back position?—lt's hard to
say what we'll do with John. This year we
wanted to have every good player on the field
all of the time. John would get the ball more
often if he was in the backfield. We'll try to
get the ball to him as much as possible.
Hopefully we can do it more often than we
did this past season.
What is your philosophy of discipline?—The
search committee asked me what I thought
about discipline. I said that I feel it comes
from a mutual respect for each other. There
are certain things which I have strong feelings
about. Some are itty-bitty things. If the
players will adhere to those things, it will
work out. I'd like to think that they'd do
nothing to embarass me or any other coaches
or the university and I'd like to think that I'll
do nothing to embarass anyone either.
How do you feel about hair?—l think
everybody should have some. Times and styles
change and hair should be a little longer. I'm
not going to wear my hair to the point where
it will embarass the players. I hope they won't
do so either. If they look bad, they reflect on
the coaches and the university. I hope there's
a happy medium.
What was your situation in Denver?—l had
made the decision to go with Ralston to
Denver. I told John last Saturday that I would
definitely join him in Denver. The Denver
organization is to be commended. They have
been very good and you might say great about
the whole affair. It all comes down to whether
you want to be an assistant pro coach or a
head coach in college.
