# Swimmers Swamp Arden Hills

### DOUG WILSON 
Brian Job and Dave Shilling
established, themselves as the
nation's premier collegiate
breaststroke swimmers Saturday
afternoon, as the Stanford varsity
defeated the Arden Hills Swim
Club, 71-40, at Encina Pool. The
Arden Hills squad, however,
served notice that rising high
school stars are likely to figure
prominently in American Olympic
trial competition this summer.
In winning the 200-yd.
breaststroke, Job set the nation's
fastest time to date, with a 2:08.5
clocking. The Stanford junior was
pushed hard, by teammate Dave
Shilling, whose second-place
2:09.0 made him the
second-fastest breaststroker in the
country as of Saturday.
Job, however, failed to close a
gap between himself and Arden
Hills' Scott Brown on the
breaststroke leg of the 200-yd.
individual medley; Brown, a high
school competitor, won the event
in 1:59.1.
Stanford sprinters had to take a
back seat to Dave Fairbanks of

Arden Hills; Fairbanks, also a high
schooler, won the 50 free in :21.2
over Stanford's Steve Carey
(22.0), and defeated Ken Hammer
and Bob Wilson in the 100 with
an admirable :47.2 clocking.
The afternoon's top
competitor, however, was clearly
Mike Burton of Arden Hills.
Perhaps the top male protege in a
long line of top competitors
developed by coach Sherm
Chavoor, Burton easily won the
1000 freestyle in 9:44.9; won the
200-yd. butterfly in 1:58.8; and
earned his third victory in the 500
free in a time of 4:47.8.
Burton was followed in both
distance events by Rex Favero of
Arden Hills, a high school distance
swimmer who clocked 9:48.9 in
the 1000 and 4:53.7 in the 500.
Stanford's Terry Sutton placed
third in the 1000; Tim Broderick
of Stanford placed fourth in the
500 with a time of 5:00.8.
A trio of female competitors
added interest to Stanford's first
co-ed swim meet. American and
Olympic champion Flie Daniel
turned in a 2:11.0 clocking in the

200-yd. butterfly, and Stanford
freshman Vicki King, one of the
nation's finest freestyle swimmers,
earned the plaudits of the crowd
in the 500 with a 5:11.3 time. An
unexpected entrant was
Pan-American Games champion
Cindy Plaisted, who competed for
Arden Hills in the individual
medley and swam the anchor leg
of the medley relay, which Arden
Hills lost to the Stanford team of
Jack Deppe, John Stalker,

Hammer and Shilling.
Deppe placed second to
teammate Randy Whitchurch as
the Stanford freshmen continued
to dominate backstroke
competition; and Tim Broderick
managed to break Arden Hills'
domination of the distance events
with a 1:46.4 victory in the 200
free. Stanford's Steve Riffenburgh
won both the 1 and 3-meter
diving events, in which only
Stanford divers competed.
