# Players Appraise New Coach
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Player reaction yesterday to
the announcement of Jack
Christiansen's appointment to
Stanford's head coaching position
was uniformly enthusiastic. Some
of the Indians, including Mike
Boryla, Eric Cross, and Randy
Poltl, even went out to the airport
Friday to greet their new coach.
Charles McCloud, junior
defensive back, firmly endorsed
Christiansen. "I prefer
Christiansen to any coach. You
take a cat like Christiansen who
has played and coached in the
pros; he has a great deal of
authority and knowledge. I give
him more respect than any of the
other coaches."
Further testament to
Christiansen's experience was
offered by Miles Moore. "He has
been farther down the road than
anyone else. He has got to have
your respect."
Questions
Questions have been raised as
to whether team discipline will
change under the new regime.
Every one of the players
questioned, however, did not feel
that there would be any
player-coach problems in the year
to come. Junior tight end Bill
Scott feels that the fact that
Christiansen has been around for
four years will prevent any
problems. "It is good that an
inside man got the job instead of
some outsider. Stanford players
are different than most others."
Moore believes that
Christiansen is in step with the
team's attitudes. "In football
these days, people don't associate
with the God-type image. People
just live, and Christiansen is a live
and let live guy."
"He is the type of coach who
can relate to all the players,"
pointed out McCloud. "He was
always the fairest coach out there.
I am conscious of any prejudices,
but with Christiansen, you always
know that the best man will
play."
Confidence
Graduating senior Dennis
Sheehan also expressed the belief
that the new head coach will work
well with his players.

"Christiansen is a friendly and
personable guy. He will be very
sensitive to player demands."
Cross and Moore represented
the players on the official search
committee for John Ralston's
successor. They polled some of
the players and Moore stated that
the vote was very evenly split
between Mike White and
Christiansen. Scott said that the
. .majority voted for White, so I
guess that he (Christiansen) is our
second choice, but he's a damn
good second choice."
Offensive Flair
The departure of White and
Ralston has prompted observers
to wonder whether the Indians'

will lose their offensive flair.
Moore believes that "Our offense
will open up even more. Coach
Christiansen strongly feels that
the only way to keep the interest
of the players and fans is to have a
wide-open attack."
Confidence was expressed in
Christiansen by his players, but
they sympathized with the
problems he faces in rebuilding
the Indian coaching staff and
salvaging the deteriorating
recruiting situation.
Sheehan feels that the loss of
White, Max McCartney, Roger
Theder, and Bill Dickey to Cal
will damage Stanford's recruiting
efforts. "As a recruit, you look

for stability in the coaching staff.
I know of two boys who have
gone to their second choices
already because of the unsettled
situation here. But
don't underestimate Coach
Christiansen. I have great
confidence in him.

THIS IS OUR LAST SEASON . . . PASS IT ON- -In a pre-season publicity photograph, Max McCartney
(front row far right) seems to be whispering something to Mike White who probably passed the message
down the line through John Ralston, Bob Gambold, and Roger Theder. Word filtered up to Bill Dickey
(top row far left), but seemed to stop here as the rest of the top row from left to right, Jack Christiansen,
Bill Moultrie, and Dave Currey chose to continue their careers at Stanford.
