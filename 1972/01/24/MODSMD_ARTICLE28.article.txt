Quentin Hunger Strike Ends
SAN QUENTIN — Twenty-two inmates who had been on a hunger strike at San
Quentin prison's maximum security adjustment center since last Monday have
broken their fast.
Officer Lee De Bord said the last two holdouts accepted breakfast and lunch
yesterday. The 20 others ate on Saturday.
"I guess they just got hungry," said De Bord. "Everything seems back to
normal now, but we'll just have to wait and see what they'll do Monday."
De Bord would not identify the last two men, but said Soledad Brothers John
Clutchette and Fleeta Drumgo were among those who had accepted food earlier,
as had Ruchel Magee, charged with Angela Davis in a 1970 Marin County Civic
Center shootout.
The 22, who are given meals in their cells, had sent a letter to Warden Louis
Nelson with seven demands.
Those included hot food be served on metal rather than paper plates; same
commissary privileges as others; permission to go to visiting rooms without
chains or shackles; access to the prison chapel; religious literature and books
dealing with minorities and permission to take correspondence courses.
Associate Warden James Park has said the requests will be reviewed, but added
most of the things are not being done for security reasons.
Berrigan Trial To Begin
HARRISBURG, Pa. — The Rev. Philip Berrigan and six others go on trial today,
charged with antiwar conspiracies that included an alleged plot to kidnap White
House adviser Henry Kissinger.
The seven defendants — an eighth was ordered tried separately — are charged
with conspiring to kidnap Kissinger, plotting to raid East Coast draft offices and
conspiring to blow up heating tunnels for Washington, D.C., federal buildings.
In addition to Father Berrigan, 49, a Roman Catholic priest known for his
antiwar activism, the defendants include two other priests, a nun, a former priest
and his wife, a former nun, and a Pakistani student.
Among the seven attorneys representing the defendants are Ramsey Clark,
former U.S. attorney general, and Paul O'Dwyer, defeated as the Democratic
candidate for the U.S. Senate from New York in 1968.
Russ Captains Face Charges
ADAK ISLAND, Alaska — Two Russian fishing officers were to be flown to
Anchorage yesterday to face possible federal charges in connection with seizure
of two Soviet herring boats in Alaskan waters last week.
The Coast Guard said it would fly Vladimir Artemov, master of the Soviet
fleet, and Igor Bobtuk, skipper of the processing ship Lamut, to Anchorage to be
turned over to U.S. Atty. G. Kent Edwards.
The Coast Guard, which has steadfastly refused to release details of the case,
did not indicate what specific charges might be lodged against the Russians. The
Coast Guard has claimed it is trying to avoid release of information which would
prejudice the case.
Mansfield: Expand Paris Talks
WASHINGTON — Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield called yesterday
for enlargement of the Vietnam peace talks to include the problems of Laos and
Cambodia and suggested moving the talks to some place closer to Southeast
Asia.
The Montana senator said also that maintenance of a unified, independent
Laos might depend on convincing King Savang Vatthana to take a more direct
leadership role, and that the only hope for preserving Cambodia's independence
lies in ousted chief of state, Norodom Sihanouk.
While the talks have been going on in Paris, the Montanan said, "the tentacles
of the war's devastation have reached out of Vietnam ever deeper into Laos and
Cambodia," making the talks limited to Vietnam "a futile exercise."
"If negotiations are to have any chance of succeeding, an enlargement of the

negotiating table is necessary," Mansfield said, adding that this raises problems
about who should speak for Laos and Cambodia.
McCarthy May Lead Third Parly
ST. PAUL, Minn. — Eugene J. McCarthy hinted yesterday that he may lead a
third party effort in the November presidential election "if Democrats don't give
us a choice."
"The two-party system is justified only if it gives people a choice on the
important issues," the Democratic presidential hopeful told a crowd of about
1,000 persons at Macalester College.
McCarthy did not specifically mention a third-party movement but he asked
his followers to make a commitment to what he called an alternate course "if
Democrats don't give us a choice." He added that the alternate course would
mean that "winning or losing" was only a "secondary consideration."
The former Minnesota senator, who also sought the presidency in 1968, said it
appears now that the two major parties will offer "not much of a choice." He
said the Democratic party may endorse a candidate "just a little better than
President Richard Nixon'.'
Wallace WonM Debate Lindsay
WASHINGTON — Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace said yesterday he does not
plan to accept a challenge from New York City Mayor John V. Lindsay to
debate in Florida's Democratic presidential primary.
Wallace said his campaign schedule would not allow time for a debate.
He added, "I don't know whether I ought to draw any crowds for Mayor
Lindsay or not, but that's probably what he wants to do, and I think he's
running very low in Florida."
The debate challenge was issued last week by Lindsay, also a candidate in the
who charged that Wallace "stands for everything wrong with this
country." In a telegram to the governor, Lindsay called for a "one-hour,
man-to-man" debate.
"Perhaps the people of Florida canhelp him [Wallace] make up his mind,"
Lindsay said yesterday. "They can decide whether they want a debate on the
issues in this primary or whether they will settle for a primary circus of staged
rallies and no substance."
Hughes Mystery Thickens
NEW YORK — Three checks totalling $650,000, which the McGraw-Hill
publishing firm thought it paid to industrialist Howard R. Hughes for his
autobiography, were cashed through a Swiss bank by an attractive blonde who
identified herself as Helga R. Hughes, Time Magazine said yesterday.
The 32-year-old woman, who spoke English and very bad German, carried the
cash out of the Zurich bank in three trips, stuffing the Swiss bills in an airline
bag, the magazine said.
She endorsed two of the checks "H.R. Hughes" in the presence of a bank
officer, and mailed in the third with the same endorsement, Time said.
When the "autobiography" was challenged in court as a hoax, McGraw-Hill
produced certificates from handwriting experts that two of the endorsements
were genuine signatures of the billionaire industrialist, who lives in seclusion in
the Bahamas. The third eheck—a certified check—has not been returned yet by
the bank, McGraw-Hill said.
A spokesman for the publishing firm said McGraw-Hill had no comment on
the Time magazine report except that "we've heard that name Helga R. Hughes
in the course of our investigations."
Air Force Strikes Again
SAIGON — U.S. fighter-bombers knocked out two enemy antiaircraft guns and
damaged another in "protective reaction strikes" inside the demilitarized zone
Saturday, the U.S. Command announced yesterday.
The strikes were the 11th and 12th announced this year. None of the planes
was damaged, the Command said.
