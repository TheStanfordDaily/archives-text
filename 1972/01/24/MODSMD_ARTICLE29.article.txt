# Panelists Analyze MediCal Program
## 
### CRAIG MALLOY 
The current MediCal program came
under extensive attack at an unusual
conference on California's health
program for the poor held Friday at
the Stanford Medical Center.
Three speakers discussed recent
cutbacks in MediCal. The conference
was cosponsored by the Department
of Community and Preventive
Medicine, and the MediCal committee
for Human Rights.
Marc Snyder, a Stanford medical
student, cited an estimated $208
million saving by this June as the
reason for the cuts. He blamed the
high costs of MediCal on inefficient
management, an unbalanced tax
structure and profit making in the
health industry.
But Snyder said he does not
advocate a simple increase in health
spending or reorganization of MediCal.
These solutions he said, "Would still
not deal with other fundamental
reasons why MediCal is inadequate if
we want to provide decent health care
as a basic human right."
A charity health program, he said,
cannot provide decent care. He
indicated that MediCal impoverishes
people before assisting them,
reinforces a psychology of poverty,
fails to provide preventive medicine
and is not accountable to the people it
serves.
Responses Needed
Snyder agreed there should be
responses to MediCal cuts, but added
"we must work to end the program
and to create a national health care
system based on certain principles."
Among principles mentioned were a
progressive tax on wealth, an end to
profit making, and control of health
programs by workers and consumers.
Snyder characterized the feelings of
people trying to change MediCal by
quoting Joseph Heller: "Catch 22 says
they have a right to do anything we
can't stop them from doing ..
National health insurance programs
as proposed by President Nixon or
Senator Edward Kennedy are
inadequate because they show "the
same basic flaws as MediCal," Snyder
said.
Background for Snyder's talk was
provided by Rose Grobstein, Chief of
Pediatric social work at Stanford, and
Lillian Wurzel, coordinator of welfare

medical programs in Santa Gara
County.
Grobstein said she was "appalled at
the numerous stumbling blocks put in
the way of both patient and physician
that prevent adequate health care."
She presented cases at Stanford and
elsewhere of patients denied or
delayed in obtaining health care due to
MediCal peculiarities.
Case Cited
She noted one case of a woman
with four sick children who had only
two dollars in her purse and was
unable to make the total required
prepayment of one dollar per patient.
This resulted, Grobstein said, "in the
bizarre situation of the mother having
to chose between her four children to
determine which was the sickest."
Wurzel pointed out that many
problems associated with medical care
are not the result of program
inadequacies but rather
misunderstandings and misapplications
of existing health provisions.
Wurzel commented on several of the
cases presented earlier. Regarding the
predicament of the woman unable to
make the necessary prepayments for
her children, she noted that in an
emergency this requirement is waived.

problems associated with medical care
are not the result of program
inadequacies but rather
misunderstandings and misapplications
of existing health provisions.
Wurzel commented on several of the
cases presented earlier. Regarding the
predicament of the woman unable to
make the necessary prepayments for
her children, she noted that in an
emergency this requirement is waived.
The current MediCal program came
under extensive attack at an unusual
conference on California's health
program for the poor held Friday at
the Stanford Medical Center.
Three speakers discussed recent
cutbacks in MediCal. The conference
was cosponsored by the Department
of Community and Preventive
Medicine, and the MediCal committee
for Human Rights.
Marc Snyder, a Stanford medical
student, cited an estimated $208
million saving by this June as the
reason for the cuts. He blamed the
high costs of MediCal on inefficient
management, an unbalanced tax
structure and profit making in the
health industry.
But Snyder said he does not
advocate a simple increase in health
spending or reorganization of MediCal.
These solutions he said, "Would still
not deal with other fundamental
reasons why MediCal is inadequate if
we want to provide decent health care
as a basic human right."
A charity health program, he said,
cannot provide decent care. He
indicated that MediCal impoverishes
people before assisting them,
reinforces a psychology of poverty,
fails to provide preventive medicine
and is not accountable to the people it
serves.
Responses Needed
Snyder agreed there should be
responses to MediCal cuts, but added
"we must work to end the program
and to create a national health care
system based on certain principles."
Among principles mentioned were a
progressive tax on wealth, an end to
profit making, and control of health
programs by workers and consumers.
Snyder characterized the feelings of
people trying to change MediCal by
quoting Joseph Heller: "Catch 22 says
they have a right to do anything we
can't stop them from doing ..
National health insurance programs
as proposed by President Nixon or
Senator Edward Kennedy are
inadequate because they show "the
same basic flaws as MediCal," Snyder
said.
Background for Snyder's talk was
provided by Rose Grobstein, Chief of
Pediatric social work at Stanford, and
Lillian Wurzel, coordinator of welfare

medical programs in Santa Gara
County.
Grobstein said she was "appalled at
the numerous stumbling blocks put in
the way of both patient and physician
that prevent adequate health care."
She presented cases at Stanford and
elsewhere of patients denied or
delayed in obtaining health care due to
MediCal peculiarities.
Case Cited
She noted one case of a woman
with four sick children who had only
two dollars in her purse and was
unable to make the total required
prepayment of one dollar per patient.
This resulted, Grobstein said, "in the
bizarre situation of the mother having
to chose between her four children to
determine which was the sickest."
Wurzel pointed out that many
problems associated with medical care
are not the result of program
inadequacies but rather
misunderstandings and misapplications
of existing health provisions.
