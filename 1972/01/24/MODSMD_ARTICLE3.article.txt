# SRM Committee Plans Sit-in
## 
### DAVE THIEMANN 
At a meeting yesterday, the steering
committee of the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement (SRM)
decided to sit in at an undisclosed
location after a 12:15 p.m. rally in
White Plaza today, at which former
English professor H. Bruce Franklin
will speak.
According to members of the
steering committee, Franklin will
speak "on his firing and its
ramifications, without urging or
inciting any specific tactic."
According to Pete Knutson, a
member of the steering committee, the

committee decided that "some sort of
major response to Bruce's firing was
necessary," and that "a sit-in seemed
to be appropriate."
Franklin said that he would be
teaching his class, "Literature and
Revolution," tomorrow afternoon
"wherever people are," and predicted,
"it should be an exciting day."
The SRM published a leaflet
yesterday which reads: "Urge!!!
Incite!!! Sit-in!!! 12:15 at White
Plaza. The Trustees have acted,
ignoring our referendum. Bruce
Franklin and other professors will
speak at a 12:15 rally at White Plaza
Monday. Be Prepared!! Action speaks
louder than words!! Control your
University!!"
According to Raymond Giraud,
chairman of the French and Italian
Department and a member of the
Faculty Political Action Group

steering committee, FPAG will not
formally participate in the sit-in
because "no faculty member was
present during the meeting of the
(SRM) steering committee that
discussed the sit-in," and because the
FPAG membership, diffuse and
loosely organized, could not decide
the sit-in issue on short notice.
FPAG will instead urge its members
to "listen to the rally and take action
according to their consciences,"
Giraud said, leaving them free to
respond individually to the sit-in.
The sit-in will be conducted "in the
same basic spirit as the occupations of
the last few weeks," Royce observed.
A "dorm caucus" organized by the
Young Crows met yesterday afternoon
in the Donner lounge, and endorsed
the sit-in action. The meeting attracted
about 40 people.
