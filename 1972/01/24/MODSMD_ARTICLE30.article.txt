# Arson Fire Hits Wilbur
## 
### 
An attempted arson fire in the
basement of the food services area of
Wilbur Hall caused an estimated $500
damage before being extinguished by
sprinklers early Saturday.
Dayton Foote of the Santa Clara
County Fire Marshall's Office said the
3:42 a.m. fire was "pretty fast"
spreading and "definitely arson."
He said a flammable liquid
container — possibly a plastic bag —
had been placed in a cardboard box in
a vacant room with no door and
plywood partitions in the basement. A
trail of the flammable liquid was
spread over carpet in adjoining areas as
a fuse.
The fire charred a 16 square foot
area of carpet, triggering two overhead
sprinklers which put it out. Foote said
entry to the area may have been
gained through a service door.
The investigation is continuing.
