# Board Of Trustees Fires Franklin On 20—2 Vote
## 
### PHIL REVZIN FRED MANN 
The Board of Trustees Saturday
confirmed by a 20-2 vote, the
immediate firing of H. Bruce Franklin.
About 120 demonstrators,
including Franklin and his family,
walked and chanted in the rain during
the one and one half hour meeting.
Four demonstrators were arrested by
San Francisco police and at least one
was injured.
The Trustees began their closed
meeting at 9:15 a.m. despite a
telephoned bomb threat which said
that three bombs on different floors of
the nine-story building would explode
at 10:15 a.m. Police searched the
building but found no bombs.
Those arrested were identified as:
Bruce A. Curtis, 21, of Portola Valley
(on charges of obstructing justice and
resisting arrest); Frank L. (Cois)
Fisher, 21, of Palo Alto (assaulting a
police officer and resisting arrest);
Gary Wayne Bourland, 20, of
Redwood City (assaulting a police
officer); and Fred Glenn Athearn, 21,
of Stanford (interfering).
Curtis was apparently a deserter
from the Navy, and was turned over to
Naval authorities.
Trustees Ira Hall and Denis Hayes
dissented from the Board's decision.
Hall, Director of the Mid-Peninsula
Urban Coalition, said after the meeting
that "I was much less than convinced
that the evidence warranted the
recommendation that Franklin be
fired. The charge involved the thin
edge between advocacy and
incitement, and the dismissal wasn't
warranted on the basis of the
evidence."
Hayes, now a Fellow at the
Woodrow Wilson Center for
International Scholars in Washington,
said that he felt that "there would
now be hesitancy on the part of
professors to say anything which
dissents from the norm. Free speech
on American college campuses has
been at least tentatively damaged. If
other Universities follow suit, this
could have a tragic effect."
Hall and Hayes, both 27, are the
youngest members of the Board.
Board President Robert Minge
Brown said the Board found that
"proper procedures had been
followed." Brown added, "We were
confronted with an employer
employee relationship. The board's job
was to be sure that the employee had

been given a fair hearing, and that the
penalty seemed appropriate.
"This Board of Trustees was very
concerned with the issue of academic
freedom. The history of academic
freedom at Stanford is strong. The
right to express any opinion will
continue to exist as it always nus at
Stanford."
Brown said the Board felt its duty
was not to reweigh the evidence, but
to see that procedural guidelines, as
outlined in the Policy on Appointment
and Tenure, were followed and that
the penalties seemed proper.
"Any institution is entitled to have
some rules, and the employees are
expected to obey those rules. Being a
tenured professor carries with it some
responsibilities and obligations, as well
as privileges," he added.
President Lyman, who was not
present during the Board's
deliberations, said after the meeting,
"What we have tried to do is proceed
with the most careful attention to
University policies and procedures.
Those policies and procedures were
largely shaped by the faculty itself,
long before the Franklin case began.
"What will turn out to be most
influential about this decision will be
the text of the Advisory Board
decision itself, particularly those parts
dealing with such general issues as the
proper standards to be applied."
'Landmark Decision'
Lyman concluded, "I think this
decision will stand as a landmark in a
difficult but essential effort for higher
education: to distinguish between the
protected free expression of ideas, no
matter how repugnent to how many
people, and a license, on the other
hand, to wield any weapon and exploit
any opening to attack and bring to a
halt the functioning of one of the
greatest strongholds of free expression
in the world today — the American
university."
An exclusive interview with
President Lyman appears on page four.
Brown indicated that the Trustees
had read the Advisory Board decision,
and had before them written briefs
from Franklin, the Faculty Political
Action Group (FPAG) and the
American Civil Liberties Union.
Protest Starts Early
The demonstration outside the
Pacific Mutual Life building, where the
Board met, began early. Protesters
started to gather at 8:00 a.m., and
shouted at individual trustees as they

entered through the locked and
guarded front door for the 9:00 a.m.
meeting. President Lyman and other
administrators had arrived at 7:30
a.m., thus avoiding confrontation with
those outside.
Protesters picketed and chanted as
tour buses stopped to stare and San
Francisco police watched from squad
cars across the street. Stanford Police
Director Marvin Herrington and
University News and Publications
officials stood in the lobby of the
building along with private security
officials and San Francisco policemen.
When members of the press were
admitted to the building at 10:30
a.m., some of the demonstrators
gathered around the entrance and
argued against the exclusion of
Barbara Hyland, a representative of
the Community News Service, from
the line of those being admitted. One
demonstrator, Curtis, spit on the glass
door.
Minutes later, police carrying riot
clubs emerged from the lobby,
ordering the doorway cleared so that
more press could be admitted. As
demonstrators moved back, Curtis was
apprehended and placed under arrest.
Commanding officer Sgt. Robert
Sirimele later said Curtis had refused
to move from the door, and when he
was approached and asked to "quiet
down" he struck an officer.
Reporters standing only feet from
Curtis disputed the police report,
however, and agreed that the
demonstrator had not resisted until
after being grabbed by the officer.
Another of those arrested, Fisher,
was similarly accused of hitting an
officer. He was pulled from the crowd
and hustled across the street to a
waiting police car. As a bus moved
between the protesters and the
apprehended suspect, Fisher was
clubbed on the back by one of the
arresting policemen.
At 11:05 a.m., 16 Board members
emerged from the building under a
heavy police escort, and were greeted
with chants of "Seig Heil" and a
handful of thrown pennies. Riot
equipped police guarded the Trustees
as they walked one block to a parking
garage and drove away.
Ten minutes later, more police
came out of the building, and
immediately arrested a demonstrator
(Bourland) seated on a ledge near the
entrance. Police later claimed the
apparently unprovoked arrest
stemmed from the throwing of a caster
or large ball-bearing at police minutes
before. Again, reporters and witnesses
at the scene saw no such incident.
As Bourland was being placed in
the police wagon, Athearn, a
photographer, was also arrested for
"interfering."
Franklin termed the arrests
"insane," stating "This is the same
scene as the Computation Center. The
pigs are creating violence. This is why I
wanted Prof. [Lincoln] Moses to stay
[at the Comp. Center] as a witness."
Trustee Hayes offered to stay with
the protesters as long as he could to
act as an observor.
Protesters began to disperse, and 70
people set off for Union Square where
Franklin addressed an anti-imperialist
rally.
After the area had cleared, four
smiling police officers emerged from
the building laughingly singing,
"Where have all the flowers gone?"

at 10:15 a.m. Police searched the
building but found no bombs.
Those arrested were identified as:
Bruce A. Curtis, 21, of Portola Valley
(on charges of obstructing justice and
resisting arrest); Frank L. (Cois)
Fisher, 21, of Palo Alto (assaulting a
police officer and resisting arrest);
Gary Wayne Bourland, 20, of
Redwood City (assaulting a police
officer); and Fred Glenn Athearn, 21,
of Stanford (interfering).
Curtis was apparently a deserter
from the Navy, and was turned over to
Naval authorities.
Trustees Ira Hall and Denis Hayes
dissented from the Board's decision.
Hall, Director of the Mid-Peninsula
Urban Coalition, said after the meeting
that "I was much less than convinced
that the evidence warranted the
recommendation that Franklin be
fired. The charge involved the thin
edge between advocacy and
incitement, and the dismissal wasn't
warranted on the basis of the
evidence."
Hayes, now a Fellow at the
Woodrow Wilson Center for
International Scholars in Washington,
said that he felt that "there would
now be hesitancy on the part of
professors to say anything which
dissents from the norm. Free speech
on American college campuses has
been at least tentatively damaged. If
other Universities follow suit, this
could have a tragic effect."
Hall and Hayes, both 27, are the
youngest members of the Board.
Board President Robert Minge
Brown said the Board found that
"proper procedures had been
followed." Brown added, "We were
confronted with an employer
employee relationship. The board's job
was to be sure that the employee had

been given a fair hearing, and that the
penalty seemed appropriate.
"This Board of Trustees was very
concerned with the issue of academic
freedom. The history of academic
freedom at Stanford is strong. The
right to express any opinion will
continue to exist as it always nus at
Stanford."
Brown said the Board felt its duty
was not to reweigh the evidence, but
to see that procedural guidelines, as
outlined in the Policy on Appointment
and Tenure, were followed and that
the penalties seemed proper.
"Any institution is entitled to have
some rules, and the employees are
expected to obey those rules. Being a
tenured professor carries with it some
responsibilities and obligations, as well
as privileges," he added.
President Lyman, who was not
present during the Board's
deliberations, said after the meeting,
"What we have tried to do is proceed
with the most careful attention to
University policies and procedures.
Those policies and procedures were
largely shaped by the faculty itself,
long before the Franklin case began.
"What will turn out to be most
influential about this decision will be
the text of the Advisory Board
decision itself, particularly those parts
dealing with such general issues as the
proper standards to be applied."
'Landmark Decision'
Lyman concluded, "I think this
decision will stand as a landmark in a
difficult but essential effort for higher
education: to distinguish between the
protected free expression of ideas, no
matter how repugnent to how many
people, and a license, on the other
hand, to wield any weapon and exploit
any opening to attack and bring to a
halt the functioning of one of the
greatest strongholds of free expression
in the world today — the American
university."
An exclusive interview with
President Lyman appears on page four.
Brown indicated that the Trustees
had read the Advisory Board decision,
and had before them written briefs
from Franklin, the Faculty Political
Action Group (FPAG) and the
American Civil Liberties Union.
Protest Starts Early
The demonstration outside the
Pacific Mutual Life building, where the
Board met, began early. Protesters
started to gather at 8:00 a.m., and
shouted at individual trustees as they

entered through the locked and
guarded front door for the 9:00 a.m.
meeting. President Lyman and other
administrators had arrived at 7:30
a.m., thus avoiding confrontation with
those outside.
Protesters picketed and chanted as
tour buses stopped to stare and San
Francisco police watched from squad
cars across the street. Stanford Police
Director Marvin Herrington and
University News and Publications
officials stood in the lobby of the
building along with private security
officials and San Francisco policemen.
When members of the press were
admitted to the building at 10:30
a.m., some of the demonstrators
gathered around the entrance and
argued against the exclusion of
Barbara Hyland, a representative of
the Community News Service, from
the line of those being admitted. One
demonstrator, Curtis, spit on the glass
door.
Minutes later, police carrying riot
clubs emerged from the lobby,
ordering the doorway cleared so that
more press could be admitted. As
demonstrators moved back, Curtis was
apprehended and placed under arrest.
Commanding officer Sgt. Robert
Sirimele later said Curtis had refused
to move from the door, and when he
was approached and asked to "quiet
down" he struck an officer.
Reporters standing only feet from
Curtis disputed the police report,
however, and agreed that the
demonstrator had not resisted until
after being grabbed by the officer.
Another of those arrested, Fisher,
was similarly accused of hitting an
officer. He was pulled from the crowd
and hustled across the street to a
waiting police car. As a bus moved
between the protesters and the
apprehended suspect, Fisher was
clubbed on the back by one of the
arresting policemen.
At 11:05 a.m., 16 Board members
emerged from the building under a
heavy police escort, and were greeted
with chants of "Seig Heil" and a
handful of thrown pennies. Riot
equipped police guarded the Trustees
as they walked one block to a parking
garage and drove away.
Ten minutes later, more police
came out of the building, and
immediately arrested a demonstrator
(Bourland) seated on a ledge near the
entrance. Police later claimed the
apparently unprovoked arrest
stemmed from the throwing of a caster
or large ball-bearing at police minutes
before. Again, reporters and witnesses
at the scene saw no such incident.
As Bourland was being placed in
the police wagon, Athearn, a
photographer, was also arrested for
"interfering."
Franklin termed the arrests
"insane," stating "This is the same
scene as the Computation Center. The
pigs are creating violence. This is why I
wanted Prof. [Lincoln] Moses to stay
[at the Comp. Center] as a witness."
Trustee Hayes offered to stay with
the protesters as long as he could to
act as an observor.
Protesters began to disperse, and 70
people set off for Union Square where
Franklin addressed an anti-imperialist
rally.
After the area had cleared, four
smiling police officers emerged from
the building laughingly singing,
"Where have all the flowers gone?"

Naval authorities.
Trustees Ira Hall and Denis Hayes
dissented from the Board's decision.
Hall, Director of the Mid-Peninsula
Urban Coalition, said after the meeting
that "I was much less than convinced
that the evidence warranted the
recommendation that Franklin be
fired. The charge involved the thin
edge between advocacy and
incitement, and the dismissal wasn't
warranted on the basis of the
evidence."
Hayes, now a Fellow at the
Woodrow Wilson Center for
International Scholars in Washington,
said that he felt that "there would
now be hesitancy on the part of
professors to say anything which
dissents from the norm. Free speech
on American college campuses has
been at least tentatively damaged. If
other Universities follow suit, this
could have a tragic effect."
Hall and Hayes, both 27, are the
youngest members of the Board.
Board President Robert Minge
Brown said the Board found that
"proper procedures had been
followed." Brown added, "We were
confronted with an employer
employee relationship. The board's job
was to be sure that the employee had

been given a fair hearing, and that the
penalty seemed appropriate.
"This Board of Trustees was very
concerned with the issue of academic
freedom. The history of academic
freedom at Stanford is strong. The
right to express any opinion will
continue to exist as it always nus at
Stanford."
Brown said the Board felt its duty
was not to reweigh the evidence, but
to see that procedural guidelines, as
outlined in the Policy on Appointment
and Tenure, were followed and that
the penalties seemed proper.
"Any institution is entitled to have
some rules, and the employees are
expected to obey those rules. Being a
tenured professor carries with it some
responsibilities and obligations, as well
as privileges," he added.
President Lyman, who was not
present during the Board's
deliberations, said after the meeting,
"What we have tried to do is proceed
with the most careful attention to
University policies and procedures.
Those policies and procedures were
largely shaped by the faculty itself,
long before the Franklin case began.
"What will turn out to be most
influential about this decision will be
the text of the Advisory Board
decision itself, particularly those parts
dealing with such general issues as the
proper standards to be applied."
'Landmark Decision'
Lyman concluded, "I think this
decision will stand as a landmark in a
difficult but essential effort for higher
education: to distinguish between the
protected free expression of ideas, no
matter how repugnent to how many
people, and a license, on the other
hand, to wield any weapon and exploit
any opening to attack and bring to a
halt the functioning of one of the
greatest strongholds of free expression
in the world today — the American
university."
An exclusive interview with
President Lyman appears on page four.
Brown indicated that the Trustees
had read the Advisory Board decision,
and had before them written briefs
from Franklin, the Faculty Political
Action Group (FPAG) and the
American Civil Liberties Union.
Protest Starts Early
The demonstration outside the
Pacific Mutual Life building, where the
Board met, began early. Protesters
started to gather at 8:00 a.m., and
shouted at individual trustees as they

entered through the locked and
guarded front door for the 9:00 a.m.
meeting. President Lyman and other
administrators had arrived at 7:30
a.m., thus avoiding confrontation with
those outside.
Protesters picketed and chanted as
tour buses stopped to stare and San
Francisco police watched from squad
cars across the street. Stanford Police
Director Marvin Herrington and
University News and Publications
officials stood in the lobby of the
building along with private security
officials and San Francisco policemen.
When members of the press were
admitted to the building at 10:30
a.m., some of the demonstrators
gathered around the entrance and
argued against the exclusion of
Barbara Hyland, a representative of
the Community News Service, from
the line of those being admitted. One
demonstrator, Curtis, spit on the glass
door.
Minutes later, police carrying riot
clubs emerged from the lobby,
ordering the doorway cleared so that
more press could be admitted. As
demonstrators moved back, Curtis was
apprehended and placed under arrest.
Commanding officer Sgt. Robert
Sirimele later said Curtis had refused
to move from the door, and when he
was approached and asked to "quiet
down" he struck an officer.
Reporters standing only feet from
Curtis disputed the police report,
however, and agreed that the
demonstrator had not resisted until
after being grabbed by the officer.
Another of those arrested, Fisher,
was similarly accused of hitting an
officer. He was pulled from the crowd
and hustled across the street to a
waiting police car. As a bus moved
between the protesters and the
apprehended suspect, Fisher was
clubbed on the back by one of the
arresting policemen.
At 11:05 a.m., 16 Board members
emerged from the building under a
heavy police escort, and were greeted
with chants of "Seig Heil" and a
handful of thrown pennies. Riot
equipped police guarded the Trustees
as they walked one block to a parking
garage and drove away.
Ten minutes later, more police
came out of the building, and
immediately arrested a demonstrator
(Bourland) seated on a ledge near the
entrance. Police later claimed the
apparently unprovoked arrest
stemmed from the throwing of a caster
or large ball-bearing at police minutes
before. Again, reporters and witnesses
at the scene saw no such incident.
As Bourland was being placed in
the police wagon, Athearn, a
photographer, was also arrested for
"interfering."
Franklin termed the arrests
"insane," stating "This is the same
scene as the Computation Center. The
pigs are creating violence. This is why I
wanted Prof. [Lincoln] Moses to stay
[at the Comp. Center] as a witness."
Trustee Hayes offered to stay with
the protesters as long as he could to
act as an observor.
Protesters began to disperse, and 70
people set off for Union Square where
Franklin addressed an anti-imperialist
rally.
After the area had cleared, four
smiling police officers emerged from
the building laughingly singing,
"Where have all the flowers gone?"

SUPPORTERS RALLY—Fired English Professor H. Bruce Franklin fright) addresses a group of supporters Saturday
afternoon in Union Square in San Francisco, following a Board of Trustees' decision to accept the Advisory Board
decision to fire him. More than 100 persons participated in demonstrations outside the building in which the Trustees
held their morning meeting.
The Board of Trustees Saturday
confirmed by a 20-2 vote, the
immediate firing of H. Bruce Franklin.
About 120 demonstrators,
including Franklin and his family,
walked and chanted in the rain during
the one and one half hour meeting.
Four demonstrators were arrested by
San Francisco police and at least one
was injured.
The Trustees began their closed
meeting at 9:15 a.m. despite a
telephoned bomb threat which said
that three bombs on different floors of
the nine-story building would explode
at 10:15 a.m. Police searched the
building but found no bombs.
Those arrested were identified as:
Bruce A. Curtis, 21, of Portola Valley
(on charges of obstructing justice and
resisting arrest); Frank L. (Cois)
Fisher, 21, of Palo Alto (assaulting a
police officer and resisting arrest);
Gary Wayne Bourland, 20, of
Redwood City (assaulting a police
officer); and Fred Glenn Athearn, 21,
of Stanford (interfering).

dissents from the norm. Free speech
on American college campuses has
been at least tentatively damaged. If
other Universities follow suit, this
could have a tragic effect."
Hall and Hayes, both 27, are the
youngest members of the Board.
Board President Robert Minge
Brown said the Board found that
"proper procedures had been
followed." Brown added, "We were
confronted with an employer
employee relationship. The board's job
was to be sure that the employee had

been given a fair hearing, and that the
penalty seemed appropriate.
"This Board of Trustees was very
concerned with the issue of academic
freedom. The history of academic
freedom at Stanford is strong. The
right to express any opinion will
continue to exist as it always nus at
Stanford."
Brown said the Board felt its duty
was not to reweigh the evidence, but
to see that procedural guidelines, as
outlined in the Policy on Appointment
and Tenure, were followed and that
the penalties seemed proper.
"Any institution is entitled to have
some rules, and the employees are
expected to obey those rules. Being a
tenured professor carries with it some
responsibilities and obligations, as well
as privileges," he added.
President Lyman, who was not
present during the Board's
deliberations, said after the meeting,
"What we have tried to do is proceed
with the most careful attention to
University policies and procedures.
Those policies and procedures were
largely shaped by the faculty itself,
long before the Franklin case began.
"What will turn out to be most
influential about this decision will be
the text of the Advisory Board
decision itself, particularly those parts
dealing with such general issues as the
proper standards to be applied."
'Landmark Decision'
Lyman concluded, "I think this
decision will stand as a landmark in a
difficult but essential effort for higher
education: to distinguish between the
protected free expression of ideas, no
matter how repugnent to how many
people, and a license, on the other
hand, to wield any weapon and exploit
any opening to attack and bring to a
halt the functioning of one of the
greatest strongholds of free expression
in the world today — the American
university."

President Lyman appears on page four.
Brown indicated that the Trustees
had read the Advisory Board decision,
and had before them written briefs
from Franklin, the Faculty Political
Action Group (FPAG) and the
American Civil Liberties Union.
Protest Starts Early
The demonstration outside the
Pacific Mutual Life building, where the
Board met, began early. Protesters
started to gather at 8:00 a.m., and
shouted at individual trustees as they

entered through the locked and
guarded front door for the 9:00 a.m.
meeting. President Lyman and other
administrators had arrived at 7:30
a.m., thus avoiding confrontation with
those outside.
Protesters picketed and chanted as
tour buses stopped to stare and San
Francisco police watched from squad
cars across the street. Stanford Police
Director Marvin Herrington and
University News and Publications
officials stood in the lobby of the
building along with private security
officials and San Francisco policemen.
When members of the press were
admitted to the building at 10:30
a.m., some of the demonstrators
gathered around the entrance and
argued against the exclusion of
Barbara Hyland, a representative of
the Community News Service, from
the line of those being admitted. One
demonstrator, Curtis, spit on the glass
door.
Minutes later, police carrying riot
clubs emerged from the lobby,
ordering the doorway cleared so that
more press could be admitted. As
demonstrators moved back, Curtis was
apprehended and placed under arrest.
Commanding officer Sgt. Robert
Sirimele later said Curtis had refused
to move from the door, and when he
was approached and asked to "quiet
down" he struck an officer.
Reporters standing only feet from
Curtis disputed the police report,
however, and agreed that the
demonstrator had not resisted until
after being grabbed by the officer.
Another of those arrested, Fisher,
was similarly accused of hitting an
officer. He was pulled from the crowd
and hustled across the street to a
waiting police car. As a bus moved
between the protesters and the
apprehended suspect, Fisher was
clubbed on the back by one of the
arresting policemen.
At 11:05 a.m., 16 Board members
emerged from the building under a
heavy police escort, and were greeted
with chants of "Seig Heil" and a
handful of thrown pennies. Riot
equipped police guarded the Trustees
as they walked one block to a parking
garage and drove away.
Ten minutes later, more police
came out of the building, and
immediately arrested a demonstrator
(Bourland) seated on a ledge near the
entrance. Police later claimed the
apparently unprovoked arrest
stemmed from the throwing of a caster
or large ball-bearing at police minutes
before. Again, reporters and witnesses
at the scene saw no such incident.
As Bourland was being placed in
the police wagon, Athearn, a
photographer, was also arrested for
"interfering."
Franklin termed the arrests
"insane," stating "This is the same
scene as the Computation Center. The
pigs are creating violence. This is why I
wanted Prof. [Lincoln] Moses to stay
[at the Comp. Center] as a witness."
Trustee Hayes offered to stay with
the protesters as long as he could to
act as an observor.
Protesters began to disperse, and 70
people set off for Union Square where
Franklin addressed an anti-imperialist
rally.
After the area had cleared, four
smiling police officers emerged from
the building laughingly singing,
"Where have all the flowers gone?"

SUPPORTERS RALLY—Fired English Professor H. Bruce Franklin fright) addresses a group of supporters Saturday
afternoon in Union Square in San Francisco, following a Board of Trustees' decision to accept the Advisory Board
decision to fire him. More than 100 persons participated in demonstrations outside the building in which the Trustees
held their morning meeting.
The Board of Trustees Saturday
confirmed by a 20-2 vote, the
immediate firing of H. Bruce Franklin.
About 120 demonstrators,
including Franklin and his family,
walked and chanted in the rain during
the one and one half hour meeting.
Four demonstrators were arrested by
San Francisco police and at least one
was injured.
The Trustees began their closed
meeting at 9:15 a.m. despite a
telephoned bomb threat which said
that three bombs on different floors of
the nine-story building would explode
at 10:15 a.m. Police searched the
building but found no bombs.
Those arrested were identified as:
Bruce A. Curtis, 21, of Portola Valley
(on charges of obstructing justice and
resisting arrest); Frank L. (Cois)
Fisher, 21, of Palo Alto (assaulting a
police officer and resisting arrest);
Gary Wayne Bourland, 20, of
Redwood City (assaulting a police
officer); and Fred Glenn Athearn, 21,
of Stanford (interfering).
Curtis was apparently a deserter
from the Navy, and was turned over to
Naval authorities.
Trustees Ira Hall and Denis Hayes
dissented from the Board's decision.
Hall, Director of the Mid-Peninsula
Urban Coalition, said after the meeting
that "I was much less than convinced
that the evidence warranted the
recommendation that Franklin be
fired. The charge involved the thin
edge between advocacy and
incitement, and the dismissal wasn't
warranted on the basis of the
evidence."
Hayes, now a Fellow at the
Woodrow Wilson Center for
International Scholars in Washington,
said that he felt that "there would
now be hesitancy on the part of
professors to say anything which
dissents from the norm. Free speech
on American college campuses has
been at least tentatively damaged. If
other Universities follow suit, this
could have a tragic effect."
Hall and Hayes, both 27, are the
