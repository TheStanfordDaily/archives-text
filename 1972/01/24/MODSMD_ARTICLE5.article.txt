Distortion
Editor, THE DAILY:
There has been a news item in
at least one city newspaper that
about a third of the SLAC staff
signed a document expressing
agreement with Dr. Panofsky's
decision as a member of the
Advisory Board. This statement is
a distortion that should be
clarified.
The document said nothing at
all about agreement with Dr.
Panofsky's decision. It was a vote
of confidence from the SLAC
staff to the Director backing him
against any jeopardy to SLAC or
its staff caused by his calling an
unpopular decision as he saw it. I
know; I signed it and also
collected signatures for it, but
that does not mean I concur with
the Advisory Board's majority.
Personally, I agree with the
minority position.

Staff Interests
Editor, THE DAILY:
Much attention has been given
to the issue in the Franklin case
seen as important by the 10,000
students, 1,000 faculty and 200
managers at Stanford. There are
also 6,000 workers whose
interests should be considered.
As the 'King's Men' in Lyman's
office are fond of pointing out,
the University is many things.
Sometimes landlord, employer,
school, research lab, factory,
cultural center, etc. But when it
comes to maintaining control the
administrators almost always
appear as EMPLOYER. The boss
will fire you—and we have little
protection.
Many workers have accepted
other workers being fired for
inability to 'do the job'. What is
unacceptable is being fired for
non-job related activities. If
Franklin was fired because he
couldn't stomach his job (as
Professor) as part of the Stanford
management team-because he
called some dignatary a "war
criminal" or helped shut down
some Professors' operation by

public action—well, then, why not
change his job classification? If he
cannot be a 'good' Professor, why
not try him out on Staff
work -like the rest of us?
If he was not fired because of
inability to do his job then it is
clear, like the Hospital 5, that he
was fired to set an example for
the rest of us. The history of such
repressions is that they
boomerang! Some workers are
intimidated, others are jolted into
action.
Also, the Advisory Board is
composed mostly of managers—in
the common language, bosses.
These whtie men (yes, Virginia,
you haven't made it yet) hold the
lives of up to thousands of
Stanford workers in their hands.
In view of the attempts of the
Stanford workers to organize
themselves for self-protection and
the coming NLRB campaign, the
Stanford administrators are
presenting their 'hard line' to all
Stanford workers.
In the Franklin case they are
showing the same 'face' that daily
they present to their workers. I
think they're desperate and can't
face the future. Stanford workers
will increasingly demonstrate a
willingness to think for
themselves, to reach their own
decisions about their needs and
how to fulfill them while rejecting
the managers' intimidations.

Out Of Whole Cloth
Editor, THE DAILY:
For you freshmen and
sophomores who tuned in late,
what you are now witnessing at
Stanford is the tried and true
method of manufacturing a
confrontation out of whole cloth.
All the ingredients are here:
two phony issues (the denial of
Bruce Franklin's "freedom of
speech" and "war research" on
the campus); the peaceful tours,
dorm meetings and rock concerts
to lure support; the recruitment
of high school and junior college
students unfamiliar with the facts;
the emergency of non-student
leaders such as Joel Klein and
David Josephson; the sudden
reappearance at the proper

moment of such skilled
manipulators as Berkeley veteran
Steve Weissman, Jeanne Friedman
and Jim Shoch; the march on a
research lab to "engage the
researchers in dialogue."
As of this writing, the march to
the Hansen Labs has been
stymied, but one can lay odds
that sooner or later the radical
leadership will maneuver the
innocent into a confrontation
with the police, either at another
lab "teach-in" or following a late
evening "community meeting."
Interestingly enough, when the
arrests or SJC charges come,
Weissman, Friedman, Josephson,
Klein and company will be
nowhere in sight. "Let's storm the
barricades," they say, only to step
aside and let the innocent rush
ahead.

Editor, THE DAILY:
In his article, "Suggestions For
Change" (Daily, Jan. 19), Sanford
M. Dornbusch writes that
. .there has been apparent
political bias in the selection of
researchers" at the Hoover
Institution.
Is the Sanford M. Dornbusch
who made this undocumented
charge the same objective Sanford
M. Dornbusch who signed the
statement in support of Senator
George McGovern's candidacy for
the Presidency?

Spare the Anguish
Editor, THE DAILY:
Bruce Franklin was
undermining a system that gives
and gave Stanford Univesity life
(or death .)What does he expect as
the results of these attacks?
The so called revolutionaries
(oh how the Tupamaros must
laugh) have got to cease going on
metaphysical trips and return to
terrestial reality.
The present system (or any
system) will use any means
necessary to protect their interests
e.g. Kent State, this is only logical
even though not being
humanitarian.
Please spare us the cries of
anguish.

History Students
We the undersigned, members
of the History Department, view
the firing of H. Bruce Franklin as
a political act. The rationale put
forward by the university to
justify the conviction of Franklin
cannot mask the true intentions
of the Administration to purge
him.
Prior to the outset of the
investigation, the university elite
had determined that Franklin's
revolutionary critique was
illegitimate at Stanford. The
decision to dismiss Franklin belies
the existence of free speech at

Stanford; moreover, it exposes the
perverse priorities of the
university.
The links tying this institution
to the larger structure of
imperialism and oppression are
demonstrated when DoD research
and the development of
instruments of war are promoted
and protected while radical social
criticism is eliminated.
We declare our unequivocal
determination to change the
repressive nature of this
university.
