## Fire Franklin

(Editor's note — This editorial is reprinted from Friday's editions of
The Modesto BeeJ
The Board of Trustees of Stanford University will be faced with a
touchy decision when it holds a special meeting in San Francisco
tomorrow to consider recommendations that Associate Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin be fired.
The board should uphold the recommendations that Franklin be
dismissed because the findings of a university faculty board justify
such action. To do otherwise would be to go against the evidence.
Since the faculty committee made its report and after Stanford
President Richard W. Lyman announced this agreement, agitation has
been generated attempting to influence the trustees in favor of
Franklin.
This public appeal has been based on the issue of academic
freedom. This is a false issue because Franklin's teaching is not
involved.
What is the crux of the case is whether anyone, professor or
otherwise, can escape responsibility for urging violent acts, illegal
behavior and defiance of police orders on the Stanford campus.
It has nothing to do with academic freedom.
Franklin was given every possible consideration by the Stanford
faculty board which investigated his case.
He cannot contend otherwise.
Now he should be discharged and quickly.
