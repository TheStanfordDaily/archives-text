# racism basis for dismissal
## Fire Shockley, Not Franklin 
### 
third world liberation front

We, Third World People, have found
William Shockley racist not only in his
writings and speeches but also in his actions.
He has set up a committee he calls FREED
(Foundation for Research and Education on
Eugenics and Dysgenics) which is active on
two fronts; it lobbies scientists to do research
that supports his race theories and it lobbies
congressmen to make the killing of future
generations of black and other poor people
legal. ("To me it seems immoral not to view
with concern, and perhaps not to try to
prevent, the births of humans whose nervous
systems can be reliably predicted to have a
high probability of being destined to feel that
a malevolent conspiracy ruthlessly contrives
their frustration. I am thinking here of those
human beings ... with a genetic mix of
neurological connections that gives them
emotions, aspirations, and capacity to
remember, but such inferior logical capacities
that in our technologically based society their
lives are spent in recording memories of
frustrating experiences." Shockley,
Microelectronics Conference, Los Angeles,
11/17/70). There are already many "welfare"
laws along this line being considered across
the nation. Shockley and others like him
provide the justification for such laws.
Shockley's words define Nazi race theories
as well as any of could every hope to.
Therefore we'quote from Shockley:
"Nature has color-coded groups of
individuals so that statistically reliable
predictions of their adaptability to
intellectually rewarding and effective lives can
easily be made and profitably used by the
pragmatic (sic) man-in-the-street."
The difference between Shockley and the
white man-in-the-street is that while the
common man may hold racist views, Shockley
claims his race theories to be scientific fact.
Such a covering legitimizes the racism built
into social structures. Even if these theories

were true, they become irrelevant in the face
of the institutionalization of the racism they
create.
Since the beginning of American history
Black and other Third World People have
struggled against built-in racist social
structures. In the past decade significant
advances were made on this front because the
actions of Third World People exploded the
myth that American society was good for
everybody no matter what their place was.
But now we find Shockley and those like
him trying to re-instate those very same
structures used to oppress the Third World
Community. We will not allow this to happen.
Our first preventive measure is the
exposure of Shockley's role in the suppression
of Black and other people, and Stanford's
complicity in this racism. We attended his
class Tuesday morning to offer a countering
point of view. (The class was on quantum
theory, but, following the Franklin decision,
it is extremely appropriate to judge one's
classwork on the basis of outside philosophy
and activity.) While there we challenged
Shockley to debate a faculty member who
would represent the Third World community.
That debate must be held (publicly) by
January 28. The Faculty Political Action
Group was chosen to serve as intermediaries
for us, and to arrange the details.
The only violence during the class
occupation was perpetrated by an
administrative official wearing a green shirt
who pushed one of our members as he
confiscated pictures taken without our
permission and went to his seat. Both acts
were unnecessary: the one of taking people's
photos when they are peacefully sitting down
and discussing an issue with other people (this
is in itself a curious thing since Shockley
denied wanting to prosecute us, not that we
had done anything to be prosecuted for. Why
would he want our photos?) and the other of

battery on the part of an administrator against
a person who had done nothing to him. What
was he up to? It seems more to attack us than
protect Shockley. But when he realized that
the rest of us would not allow him to harm
our brother he made a short exit for
reinforcements.
This is only the first step in our attack on
the racism in the Stanford structure. The
advocacy or support of racism (be this the
stating or implying that one race is naturally
superior to another, or the production of war
materials to be used in a racist war currently
being waged in Vietnam) by faculty or
professional employees of this university
should be cause for removal from the
premises.
Racism in itself is an evil, but even more, it
is one of the basics of imperialism. An
imperialistic system depends upon the
oppression of a large mass of people; racism is
used as a tool for dividing people against each
other and allowing that oppression to go
unchallenged. Most commonly people of color
are placed at the bottom of the heap as the
white worker pats himself on the back for
"being better than somebody" rather than
realizing that his case is no different than that
of the black of brown worker whom he
despises, merely differently propagandized.
Bruce Franklin understands this relation
and fights against it. The university is deeply
involved in the imposition of imperialism (and
racism) by this country upon both its own
people and the people of other countries.* This
contradiction leads the university to want to
get rid of Bruce. The university's priorities are
wrong. Bruce is the one who should stay and
Shockley the one who should go. Third World
people on this campus and off intend to work
towards this effort.

human beings ... with a genetic mix of
neurological connections that gives them
emotions, aspirations, and capacity to
remember, but such inferior logical capacities
that in our technologically based society their
lives are spent in recording memories of
frustrating experiences." Shockley,
Microelectronics Conference, Los Angeles,
11/17/70). There are already many "welfare"
laws along this line being considered across
the nation. Shockley and others like him
provide the justification for such laws.
Shockley's words define Nazi race theories
as well as any of could every hope to.
Therefore we'quote from Shockley:
"Nature has color-coded groups of
individuals so that statistically reliable
predictions of their adaptability to
intellectually rewarding and effective lives can
easily be made and profitably used by the
pragmatic (sic) man-in-the-street."
The difference between Shockley and the
white man-in-the-street is that while the
common man may hold racist views, Shockley
claims his race theories to be scientific fact.
Such a covering legitimizes the racism built
into social structures. Even if these theories

were true, they become irrelevant in the face
of the institutionalization of the racism they
create.
Since the beginning of American history
Black and other Third World People have
struggled against built-in racist social
structures. In the past decade significant
advances were made on this front because the
actions of Third World People exploded the
myth that American society was good for
everybody no matter what their place was.
But now we find Shockley and those like
him trying to re-instate those very same
structures used to oppress the Third World
Community. We will not allow this to happen.
Our first preventive measure is the
exposure of Shockley's role in the suppression
of Black and other people, and Stanford's
complicity in this racism. We attended his
class Tuesday morning to offer a countering
point of view. (The class was on quantum
theory, but, following the Franklin decision,
it is extremely appropriate to judge one's
classwork on the basis of outside philosophy
and activity.) While there we challenged
Shockley to debate a faculty member who
would represent the Third World community.
That debate must be held (publicly) by
January 28. The Faculty Political Action
Group was chosen to serve as intermediaries
for us, and to arrange the details.
The only violence during the class
occupation was perpetrated by an
administrative official wearing a green shirt
who pushed one of our members as he
confiscated pictures taken without our
permission and went to his seat. Both acts
were unnecessary: the one of taking people's
photos when they are peacefully sitting down
and discussing an issue with other people (this
is in itself a curious thing since Shockley
denied wanting to prosecute us, not that we
had done anything to be prosecuted for. Why
would he want our photos?) and the other of

battery on the part of an administrator against
a person who had done nothing to him. What
was he up to? It seems more to attack us than
protect Shockley. But when he realized that
the rest of us would not allow him to harm
our brother he made a short exit for
reinforcements.
This is only the first step in our attack on
the racism in the Stanford structure. The
advocacy or support of racism (be this the
stating or implying that one race is naturally
superior to another, or the production of war
materials to be used in a racist war currently
being waged in Vietnam) by faculty or
professional employees of this university
should be cause for removal from the
premises.
Racism in itself is an evil, but even more, it
is one of the basics of imperialism. An
imperialistic system depends upon the
oppression of a large mass of people; racism is
used as a tool for dividing people against each
other and allowing that oppression to go
unchallenged. Most commonly people of color
are placed at the bottom of the heap as the
white worker pats himself on the back for
"being better than somebody" rather than
realizing that his case is no different than that
of the black of brown worker whom he
despises, merely differently propagandized.
Bruce Franklin understands this relation
and fights against it. The university is deeply
involved in the imposition of imperialism (and
racism) by this country upon both its own
people and the people of other countries.* This
contradiction leads the university to want to
get rid of Bruce. The university's priorities are
wrong. Bruce is the one who should stay and
Shockley the one who should go. Third World
people on this campus and off intend to work
towards this effort.

We, Third World People, have found
William Shockley racist not only in his
writings and speeches but also in his actions.
He has set up a committee he calls FREED
(Foundation for Research and Education on
Eugenics and Dysgenics) which is active on
two fronts; it lobbies scientists to do research
that supports his race theories and it lobbies
congressmen to make the killing of future
generations of black and other poor people
legal. ("To me it seems immoral not to view
with concern, and perhaps not to try to
prevent, the births of humans whose nervous

easily be made and profitably used by the
pragmatic (sic) man-in-the-street."
The difference between Shockley and the
white man-in-the-street is that while the
common man may hold racist views, Shockley
claims his race theories to be scientific fact.
Such a covering legitimizes the racism built
into social structures. Even if these theories

were true, they become irrelevant in the face
of the institutionalization of the racism they
create.
Since the beginning of American history
Black and other Third World People have
struggled against built-in racist social
structures. In the past decade significant
advances were made on this front because the
actions of Third World People exploded the
myth that American society was good for
everybody no matter what their place was.
But now we find Shockley and those like
him trying to re-instate those very same
structures used to oppress the Third World
Community. We will not allow this to happen.
Our first preventive measure is the
exposure of Shockley's role in the suppression
of Black and other people, and Stanford's
complicity in this racism. We attended his
class Tuesday morning to offer a countering
point of view. (The class was on quantum
theory, but, following the Franklin decision,
it is extremely appropriate to judge one's
classwork on the basis of outside philosophy
and activity.) While there we challenged
Shockley to debate a faculty member who
would represent the Third World community.
That debate must be held (publicly) by
January 28. The Faculty Political Action
Group was chosen to serve as intermediaries
for us, and to arrange the details.
The only violence during the class
occupation was perpetrated by an
administrative official wearing a green shirt
who pushed one of our members as he
confiscated pictures taken without our
permission and went to his seat. Both acts
were unnecessary: the one of taking people's
photos when they are peacefully sitting down
and discussing an issue with other people (this
is in itself a curious thing since Shockley
denied wanting to prosecute us, not that we
had done anything to be prosecuted for. Why
would he want our photos?) and the other of

battery on the part of an administrator against
a person who had done nothing to him. What
was he up to? It seems more to attack us than
protect Shockley. But when he realized that
the rest of us would not allow him to harm
our brother he made a short exit for
reinforcements.
This is only the first step in our attack on
the racism in the Stanford structure. The
advocacy or support of racism (be this the
stating or implying that one race is naturally
superior to another, or the production of war
materials to be used in a racist war currently
being waged in Vietnam) by faculty or
professional employees of this university
should be cause for removal from the
premises.
Racism in itself is an evil, but even more, it
is one of the basics of imperialism. An
imperialistic system depends upon the
oppression of a large mass of people; racism is
used as a tool for dividing people against each
other and allowing that oppression to go
unchallenged. Most commonly people of color
are placed at the bottom of the heap as the
white worker pats himself on the back for
"being better than somebody" rather than
realizing that his case is no different than that
of the black of brown worker whom he
despises, merely differently propagandized.
Bruce Franklin understands this relation
and fights against it. The university is deeply
involved in the imposition of imperialism (and
racism) by this country upon both its own
people and the people of other countries.* This
contradiction leads the university to want to
get rid of Bruce. The university's priorities are
wrong. Bruce is the one who should stay and
Shockley the one who should go. Third World
people on this campus and off intend to work
towards this effort.

We, Third World People, have found
William Shockley racist not only in his
writings and speeches but also in his actions.
He has set up a committee he calls FREED
(Foundation for Research and Education on
Eugenics and Dysgenics) which is active on
two fronts; it lobbies scientists to do research
that supports his race theories and it lobbies
congressmen to make the killing of future
generations of black and other poor people
legal. ("To me it seems immoral not to view
with concern, and perhaps not to try to
prevent, the births of humans whose nervous
systems can be reliably predicted to have a
high probability of being destined to feel that
a malevolent conspiracy ruthlessly contrives
their frustration. I am thinking here of those
human beings ... with a genetic mix of
neurological connections that gives them
emotions, aspirations, and capacity to
remember, but such inferior logical capacities
that in our technologically based society their
lives are spent in recording memories of
frustrating experiences." Shockley,
Microelectronics Conference, Los Angeles,
11/17/70). There are already many "welfare"
laws along this line being considered across
the nation. Shockley and others like him
provide the justification for such laws.
Shockley's words define Nazi race theories
as well as any of could every hope to.
Therefore we'quote from Shockley:
"Nature has color-coded groups of
individuals so that statistically reliable
predictions of their adaptability to
intellectually rewarding and effective lives can
easily be made and profitably used by the
pragmatic (sic) man-in-the-street."
