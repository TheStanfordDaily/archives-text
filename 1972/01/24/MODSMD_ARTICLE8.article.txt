At Stanford, 72 percent of the
faculty in arts and sciences is
tenured, which is perhaps the
highest percentage at any major
university. As President Lyman
recently pointed out to an alumni
group, this leaves little
maneuvering room in the hiring
and promotion of young faculty
people. "There is sharp worry
among our current junior
faculty," Lyman told the alumni,
"who can see the handwriting on
the wall, and who do not see how
i we can avoid extruding many of
them from the university when
! the six-year probationary period
for tenure is up.
| Since it was organized in 1891,
j and until very recently, Stanford's
image was that of a finishing
school for the off-spring of
California's rich and near-rich, and
its spiritual models have been the
more ivied of the Eastern
universities. Isolated on a far-flung
suburban campus of low buildings
with red-tile roofs, Stanford
students lead comfortable and
pleasant lives but have no
opportunity to enjoy the
bookstores, restaurants and
Bierstuben that give, say, Harvard

and Berkeley much of their flavor.
Like graduates of Yale and the
Harvard Business School, Stanford
graduates have tended to enter the
world of established business.
Even after the impact made by
such disturbers-of-the-peace as
Franklin, David Harris and their
followers, and in spite of its
academic excellence, Stanford is
still, politically and socially,
pretty much an island unto itself,
a magic island which students and
faculty seem to believe is the best
of ail worlds.
"When something like Bruce
Franklin hits, it hits very, very
hard because there's no context
into which he can be placed," I
was told by William M. Chace, an
assistant professor of English. "He
was truly like a man from Mars
for most of the people here. He
had a hard time making them
believe he's even part of the
human race."
It was not, consequently,
surprising that in the Franklin
case, matters of substance became
thoroughly confused with matters
of style, and that the formal
charges against Franklin were only
tangentially related to matters
that had made him non grata to
the administration as well as to
many other people on campus.
The hearings, which appeared
to the campus community to go
on almost interminably and whose

transcript eventually ran to more
than 4,000 pages, were directed
toward Franklin's defense against
these four charges. The case was
thoroughly complicated by the
fact that Franklin had made
himself disagreeable to many
members of the Stanford
community long before the
happenings at the Lodge speech
and the disturbances in February.
There was, consequently, an
uneasy feeling among some people
on campus that the dismissal
proceedings were directed at
getting rid of Franklin less for the
actions described in the formal
charges than for being the person
he is—or, perhaps, the person he is
thought to be.
Toward the end, a general view
was expressed by a Stanford
alumnus who told me
thoughtfully that although he
didn't think the prosecution had
made a watertight case, he would
on the whole feel a little more
comfortable if Bruce Franklin
were to be ejected from the
Stanford family.
This view of the matter was
notably not shared by an
interested observer, Alan M.
Dershowitz, a professor from the
Harvard law school who is visiting
Stanford. Dershowitz's
involvement in the case provides
an acute commentary on the
climate at Stanford while the

hearings were going on. A small,
scholarly looking man of 33 with
sandy hair, a red mustache, and
gold-rimmed spectacles,
Dershowitz wryly recalls that he
had decided to spend his year at
the Stanford Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences
in writing a book and avoiding
any distractions. "I tried my
damnedest to stay out of this
Franklin matter but it couldn't be
done. Literally the first full day I
was in residence here at the center
in August, I got a call from some
concerned faculty. They kept in
touch and then I began to get calls
from time to time from Mr.
Franklin himself. Then there came
a time when it became clear to me
that, tragically, there was no
sensitivity for civil liberties on the
Stanford campus. Most tragically,
it was blatantly absent among the
law school faculty."
Dershowitz went on, "I've been
shocked by the response I've
gotten as a result of my
involvement in the case. Frankly,
I've been made to feel like a
Northern lawyer who went down
to Mississippi and started speaking
out on behalf of the blacks, and
the local people said, 'Shhhhh,
don't mess around, don't stir the
natives up."
The brief that Dershowitz
prepared with the help of local
lawyers for the American Civil

Liberties Union (he has served on
the A.C.L.U. national board) was
essentially the classic libertarian
argument directed toward
establishing Franklin's right to
free speech under the First
Amendment and his right to
engage in political conduct that
went right up to the very line of
permissibility. Its conclusions
were that Franklin should not be
disciplined in the Lodge affair
unless it could be shown that he
intentionally tried to cut short
Lodge's speech. In the matter of
Franklin's arguing with police
about their dispersal order outside
the Computation Center, the brief
found no cause for discipline.
Finally, the brief argued that both
speeches he made on February 10
— the White Plaza speech and the
Old Union courtyard speech —
were clearly within the limits of
the First Amendment.
I remarked that I'd been struck
by the extent to which Franklin
seemed to have made it
deliberately his business to
outrage the Stanford community.
Dershowitz looked weary and
said, "He outraged me, for
example. When 1 was approached
to be involved in the case, I came
to the hearing room for the first
time and saw a picture of Stalin
on his counsel table. I wouldn't
dream of sitting at a counsel table
with a picture of Stalin.
Dershowitz continued, "there's
a sense in the Stanford
community that Franklin's a very,
very bad person indeed, that he's
armed Chicanos, that he's
advocated the use of violence and
guns against the police, and that
he's possibly been involved in the
bombing of a house on the
Stanford campus. All those things
are in the air. What can be proved
against Franklin is very different
from what people think they
know. What can be proved is not
much."

from time to time from Mr.
Franklin himself. Then there came
a time when it became clear to me
that, tragically, there was no
sensitivity for civil liberties on the
Stanford campus. Most tragically,
it was blatantly absent among the
law school faculty."
Dershowitz went on, "I've been
shocked by the response I've
gotten as a result of my
involvement in the case. Frankly,
I've been made to feel like a
Northern lawyer who went down
to Mississippi and started speaking
out on behalf of the blacks, and
the local people said, 'Shhhhh,
don't mess around, don't stir the
natives up."
The brief that Dershowitz
prepared with the help of local
lawyers for the American Civil

Liberties Union (he has served on
the A.C.L.U. national board) was
essentially the classic libertarian
argument directed toward
establishing Franklin's right to
free speech under the First
Amendment and his right to
engage in political conduct that
went right up to the very line of
permissibility. Its conclusions
were that Franklin should not be
disciplined in the Lodge affair
unless it could be shown that he
intentionally tried to cut short
Lodge's speech. In the matter of
Franklin's arguing with police
about their dispersal order outside
the Computation Center, the brief
found no cause for discipline.
Finally, the brief argued that both
speeches he made on February 10
— the White Plaza speech and the
Old Union courtyard speech —
were clearly within the limits of
the First Amendment.
I remarked that I'd been struck
by the extent to which Franklin
seemed to have made it
deliberately his business to
outrage the Stanford community.
Dershowitz looked weary and
said, "He outraged me, for
example. When 1 was approached
to be involved in the case, I came
to the hearing room for the first
time and saw a picture of Stalin
on his counsel table. I wouldn't
dream of sitting at a counsel table
with a picture of Stalin.
Dershowitz continued, "there's
a sense in the Stanford
community that Franklin's a very,
very bad person indeed, that he's
armed Chicanos, that he's
advocated the use of violence and
guns against the police, and that
he's possibly been involved in the
bombing of a house on the
Stanford campus. All those things
are in the air. What can be proved
against Franklin is very different
from what people think they
know. What can be proved is not
much."

Magazine. The article is by

At Stanford, 72 percent of the
faculty in arts and sciences is
tenured, which is perhaps the
highest percentage at any major
university. As President Lyman
recently pointed out to an alumni
group, this leaves little
maneuvering room in the hiring
and promotion of young faculty
people. "There is sharp worry
among our current junior
faculty," Lyman told the alumni,
"who can see the handwriting on
the wall, and who do not see how
i we can avoid extruding many of
them from the university when
! the six-year probationary period
for tenure is up.
| Since it was organized in 1891,
j and until very recently, Stanford's
image was that of a finishing
school for the off-spring of
California's rich and near-rich, and
its spiritual models have been the
more ivied of the Eastern
universities. Isolated on a far-flung
suburban campus of low buildings
with red-tile roofs, Stanford
students lead comfortable and
pleasant lives but have no
opportunity to enjoy the
bookstores, restaurants and
Bierstuben that give, say, Harvard

and Berkeley much of their flavor.
Like graduates of Yale and the
Harvard Business School, Stanford
graduates have tended to enter the
world of established business.
Even after the impact made by
such disturbers-of-the-peace as
Franklin, David Harris and their
followers, and in spite of its
academic excellence, Stanford is
still, politically and socially,
pretty much an island unto itself,
a magic island which students and
faculty seem to believe is the best
of ail worlds.
"When something like Bruce
Franklin hits, it hits very, very
hard because there's no context
into which he can be placed," I
was told by William M. Chace, an
assistant professor of English. "He
was truly like a man from Mars
for most of the people here. He
had a hard time making them
believe he's even part of the
human race."
It was not, consequently,
surprising that in the Franklin
case, matters of substance became
thoroughly confused with matters
of style, and that the formal
charges against Franklin were only
tangentially related to matters
that had made him non grata to
the administration as well as to
many other people on campus.
The hearings, which appeared
to the campus community to go
on almost interminably and whose

transcript eventually ran to more
than 4,000 pages, were directed
toward Franklin's defense against
these four charges. The case was
thoroughly complicated by the
fact that Franklin had made
himself disagreeable to many
members of the Stanford
community long before the
happenings at the Lodge speech
and the disturbances in February.
There was, consequently, an
uneasy feeling among some people
on campus that the dismissal
proceedings were directed at
getting rid of Franklin less for the
actions described in the formal
charges than for being the person
he is—or, perhaps, the person he is
thought to be.
Toward the end, a general view
was expressed by a Stanford
alumnus who told me
thoughtfully that although he
didn't think the prosecution had
made a watertight case, he would
on the whole feel a little more
comfortable if Bruce Franklin
were to be ejected from the
Stanford family.
This view of the matter was
notably not shared by an
interested observer, Alan M.
Dershowitz, a professor from the
Harvard law school who is visiting
Stanford. Dershowitz's
involvement in the case provides
an acute commentary on the
climate at Stanford while the

hearings were going on. A small,
scholarly looking man of 33 with
sandy hair, a red mustache, and
gold-rimmed spectacles,
Dershowitz wryly recalls that he
had decided to spend his year at
the Stanford Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences
in writing a book and avoiding
any distractions. "I tried my
damnedest to stay out of this
Franklin matter but it couldn't be
done. Literally the first full day I
was in residence here at the center
in August, I got a call from some
concerned faculty. They kept in
touch and then I began to get calls
from time to time from Mr.
Franklin himself. Then there came
a time when it became clear to me
that, tragically, there was no
sensitivity for civil liberties on the

Franklin hits, it hits very, very
hard because there's no context
into which he can be placed," I
was told by William M. Chace, an
assistant professor of English. "He
was truly like a man from Mars
for most of the people here. He
had a hard time making them
believe he's even part of the
human race."
It was not, consequently,
surprising that in the Franklin
case, matters of substance became
thoroughly confused with matters
of style, and that the formal
charges against Franklin were only
tangentially related to matters
that had made him non grata to
the administration as well as to
many other people on campus.
The hearings, which appeared
to the campus community to go
on almost interminably and whose

transcript eventually ran to more
than 4,000 pages, were directed
toward Franklin's defense against
these four charges. The case was
thoroughly complicated by the
fact that Franklin had made
himself disagreeable to many
members of the Stanford
community long before the
happenings at the Lodge speech
and the disturbances in February.
There was, consequently, an
uneasy feeling among some people
on campus that the dismissal
proceedings were directed at
getting rid of Franklin less for the
actions described in the formal
charges than for being the person
he is—or, perhaps, the person he is
thought to be.
Toward the end, a general view
was expressed by a Stanford
alumnus who told me
thoughtfully that although he
didn't think the prosecution had
made a watertight case, he would
on the whole feel a little more
comfortable if Bruce Franklin
were to be ejected from the
Stanford family.
This view of the matter was
notably not shared by an
interested observer, Alan M.
Dershowitz, a professor from the
Harvard law school who is visiting
Stanford. Dershowitz's
involvement in the case provides
an acute commentary on the
climate at Stanford while the

hearings were going on. A small,
scholarly looking man of 33 with
sandy hair, a red mustache, and
gold-rimmed spectacles,
Dershowitz wryly recalls that he
had decided to spend his year at
the Stanford Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences
in writing a book and avoiding
any distractions. "I tried my
damnedest to stay out of this
Franklin matter but it couldn't be
done. Literally the first full day I
was in residence here at the center
in August, I got a call from some
concerned faculty. They kept in
touch and then I began to get calls
from time to time from Mr.
Franklin himself. Then there came
a time when it became clear to me
that, tragically, there was no
sensitivity for civil liberties on the
Stanford campus. Most tragically,
it was blatantly absent among the
law school faculty."
Dershowitz went on, "I've been
shocked by the response I've
gotten as a result of my
involvement in the case. Frankly,
I've been made to feel like a
Northern lawyer who went down
to Mississippi and started speaking
out on behalf of the blacks, and
the local people said, 'Shhhhh,
don't mess around, don't stir the
natives up."
The brief that Dershowitz
prepared with the help of local
lawyers for the American Civil

Liberties Union (he has served on
the A.C.L.U. national board) was
essentially the classic libertarian
argument directed toward
establishing Franklin's right to
free speech under the First
Amendment and his right to
engage in political conduct that
went right up to the very line of
permissibility. Its conclusions
were that Franklin should not be
disciplined in the Lodge affair
unless it could be shown that he
intentionally tried to cut short
Lodge's speech. In the matter of
Franklin's arguing with police
about their dispersal order outside
the Computation Center, the brief
found no cause for discipline.
Finally, the brief argued that both
speeches he made on February 10
— the White Plaza speech and the
Old Union courtyard speech —
were clearly within the limits of
the First Amendment.
I remarked that I'd been struck
by the extent to which Franklin
seemed to have made it
deliberately his business to
outrage the Stanford community.
Dershowitz looked weary and
said, "He outraged me, for
example. When 1 was approached
to be involved in the case, I came
to the hearing room for the first
time and saw a picture of Stalin
on his counsel table. I wouldn't
dream of sitting at a counsel table
with a picture of Stalin.
Dershowitz continued, "there's
a sense in the Stanford
community that Franklin's a very,
very bad person indeed, that he's
armed Chicanos, that he's
advocated the use of violence and
guns against the police, and that
he's possibly been involved in the
bombing of a house on the
Stanford campus. All those things
are in the air. What can be proved
against Franklin is very different
from what people think they
know. What can be proved is not
much."

At Stanford, 72 percent of the
faculty in arts and sciences is
tenured, which is perhaps the
highest percentage at any major
university. As President Lyman
recently pointed out to an alumni
group, this leaves little
maneuvering room in the hiring
and promotion of young faculty
people. "There is sharp worry
among our current junior
faculty," Lyman told the alumni,
"who can see the handwriting on
the wall, and who do not see how
i we can avoid extruding many of
them from the university when
! the six-year probationary period
for tenure is up.
| Since it was organized in 1891,
j and until very recently, Stanford's
image was that of a finishing
school for the off-spring of
California's rich and near-rich, and
its spiritual models have been the
more ivied of the Eastern
universities. Isolated on a far-flung
suburban campus of low buildings
with red-tile roofs, Stanford
students lead comfortable and
pleasant lives but have no
opportunity to enjoy the
bookstores, restaurants and
Bierstuben that give, say, Harvard

and Berkeley much of their flavor.
Like graduates of Yale and the
Harvard Business School, Stanford
graduates have tended to enter the
world of established business.
Even after the impact made by
such disturbers-of-the-peace as
Franklin, David Harris and their
followers, and in spite of its
academic excellence, Stanford is
still, politically and socially,
pretty much an island unto itself,
a magic island which students and
faculty seem to believe is the best
of ail worlds.

Dershowitz continued, "there's
a sense in the Stanford
community that Franklin's a very,
very bad person indeed, that he's
armed Chicanos, that he's
advocated the use of violence and
guns against the police, and that
he's possibly been involved in the
bombing of a house on the
Stanford campus. All those things
are in the air. What can be proved
against Franklin is very different
from what people think they
know. What can be proved is not
much."
