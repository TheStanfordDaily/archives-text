# Sex Discrimination
## HEW To Probe Stanford 
### 
Jennifer Springer, Leslie Rabine, Dru Cornell

In the near future a committee from the
Department of Health, Education and Welfare will
come to Stanford to investigate job discrimination
against women.
Sex discrimination includes inequities in salaries,
promotions, and job categories; lack of participation
in skills-training programs; concentrating women in
low-paid, low-prestige jobs; and threats of job loss
for not yielding to the sexual advances of one's
boss.
In addition to obvious on-the-job discrimination,
women workers find themselves deprived of their
basic rights and necessities. These include free child
care controlled by parents, full health care including
pregnancy, paid pregnancy leave, and night courses.
A loose coalition of women groups has started
working on the investigation. The coalition includes
members of the Women's Union, United Stanford
Employees, Venceremos, the Third World
Liberation Front, and Stanford Professional
Women.
Loss of Funds
If HEW finds a pattern of discrimination at a
United States college, it can threaten the institution
with loss of all federal contracts until a plan of
affirmative action is presented. This is based on a
1967 Presidential order which forbids
discrimination in institutions having federal
contracts.
In 1969 HEW did its first investigation on
discrimination against women at Harvard, where
women hold twelve full professorships out of 99
positions.
Since then, over 300 class-action suits have been
filed, and about 40 colleges have been threatened
with loss of federal funds. Michigan is the only
college where funds have actually been withheld.
Columbia
At Columbia, HEW found that only 2% of
tenured professors are women. Columbia denied
discriminating, delayed in providing personnel data,
and presented vague statements rather than
affirmative action plans. HEW recommended that
Columbia's eligibility for federal contracts be ended.
According to the Village Voice, the fund
withholding power was not used to force Columbia
to end its practice of discrimination against women,
but rather because Columbia delayed in opening its
files to HEW. This was also the case at Berkeley.
In the light of the discriminatory employment
policies practiced inside HEW, it is not surprising
that HEW's attempts to rid other institutions of
discrimination have included little more than token
gestures.
Nearly two-thirds of HEW's employees in
Washington D.C. are women, 89% of whom hold
positions in the lower echelons of the agency. Only
a handful of women have been employed in the
highest grade positions, those which are usually
received through appointment by the President.
In the last year, the number of women who have
obtained top level posts has only increased from

twelve to fifteen; in the same period the number of
men employed in the same grade range increased
from 358 to 372.
Women's Action Program
To deal with the growing dissatisfaction among
women employees, HEW established a Women's
Action Program. Yet the program has remained on
the periphery of the HEW power structure, lacking
both the money and the people to make it play
more than a passive advisory role in the making of
policy decisions that affect women.
HEW as an employer continues to have a record
on par with the miserable showing of the
institutions it investigates.
Why then bother with HEW if it has neither
significantly changed the employment policies of
the universities nor significantly altered its own
racist and sexist hiring procedures? Obviously, we
don't expect HEW to resolve the contradictions
underlying employment policies.
No government agency will ever do more than
scratch the surface with the intent to hide, not
solve, the problem unless it is confronted by a
strong movement.
Questionnaires
To start creating such a movement we will
distribute a questionnaire about discrimination to
all working women and men at Stanford. On the
basis of complaints received and answers to
questionnaires, working women and their supporters
will present to the University an affirmative action
program to end sexual and racial discrimination and
put workers in control of decision-making processes.
Starting Tuesday, January 2, tables with the
questionnaire will be set up in the following places:
at the Main Library, White Plaza, the Business
School, and Encina, there will be tables from 11:30
to 1:30.
In the Hospital there will be tables in the Brown
Bag Room, and the Cafeteria from 11:30 to 1:00
and from 9:30 to 11:00; and at SLAC from 11:30
to 1:30. Women will be taking questionnaires
around in the dorms and food service.
If you feel or suspect that you have been
discriminated against in any way as a woman,
contact a USE group representative: Glenda Mones
after 3:00 at 322-7188, Linda Crouse at 326-8523,
or Jan Sutter at ext. 5903 after 4:00.
If you want to help work on the investigation,
call the Women's Center at ext. 3114.
