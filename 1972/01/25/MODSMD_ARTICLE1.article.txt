# Marchers Face Police After Night Meeting
## 
### PHIL REVZIN 
About 200 demonstrators marched
around campus after a meeting at
Cubberley Auditorium last night,
confronting Santa Clara County
Sheriff's deputies at several locations.
No one was arrested, and no injuries
were officially reported, although one
protester claimed he was clubbed by
deputies.
The group moved from Cubberley
at 10:15 p.m., after a two-hour
meeting to discuss demands and
tactics. The demonstrators ran to the
locked Old Union building, and several
smashed the glass away from a
boarded up, previously damaged plate
glass door.
The demonstrators then moved into
the building, and began piling couches,
chairs, and wood in front of the side
exists, and forcibly entered the
Cashiers Office. About 10
riot-equipped deputies charged
through the rear door exactly seven
minutes later, and the protesters fled
into the courtyard.
Sheriff's deputies secured the Old
Union as the demonstrators moved
from the courtyard past the
Undergraduate Library to the Serra
Street side of the Lou Henry Hoover
Building. Two police cars arrived
minutes after the group, and the
protesters dispersed back toward
White Plaza, while deputies lined the
front of the Hoover annex and Encina
Hall.
The group moved back past UGLY,
through White Plaza, and stopped
briefly near the Post Office debating
whether to march to President
Lyman's house. Demonstrators then
moved across the Plaza to the front of
the Placement Center, where they
halted to discuss further tactics.
Deputies formed a line between the
demonstrators and the fountain, but
drew back as group discussion
continued. The group dispersed about
midnight.
Several times during the march,
demonstrators said that the Cubberley
meeting had decided that there should

be no trashing. Apparently no
windows were broken, although some
rocks may have been thrown at police.
Two small fires were reportedly
extinguished in the construction site
near UGLY. Free Campus Movement
member Ray White, who put out the
small blazes, said that he saw four
people fleeing the scene.
At 1:50 a.m., a fire was reported in
the storage area behind the
Computation Center. It was
immediately extinguished and caused
some damage to the enclosing fence.
No other details were available.
About 300 people met in
Cubberley, and adopted two demands:
"Rehire Bruce Franklin," and
"Stanford out of the war."
The group then broke into affinity
groups, which sent representatives to a
caucus to decide specific tactics for
the evening.
The group also scheduled a rally in
White Plaza for noon today.
ASSU Council of Presidents
member Larry Diamond issued a
personal statement late last night
which said, "There is a real difference
between the type of actions that build
community actions and force
discussion of the decisions being made
at the University and thy kind of
stupid tactics that merely bring
platoons of police on campus ... it is
my hope that students who have
information about those who smash
windows and commit acts of violence
will offer that information to the
proper authorities."
