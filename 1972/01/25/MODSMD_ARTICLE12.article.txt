# Gutierrez Concert
## Brilliant Performance By Pianist 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
An audience at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium was treated to a
brilliant performance Saturday
night as Horacio Gutierrez, a
young Cuban pianist, brought the
packed house to its feet after an
excellent concert.
Originally, Gutierrez was
supposed to have played
Beethoven's Sonata in A Major,
op. 2 No. 2, Schumann's C Major
Fantasy, op. 17, and Prokofiev's
Sonata No. 6 in A Major. Upon
arriving, the audience learned he
had changed the bulk of the
program, to Haydn's Sonata No.
50 in C Major, Mendelssohn's
Variations Serieuses op. 54, and
Prokifiev's Sonata No. 7 in
Major, op. 83. Gutierrez did,
however, play the Schumann
Fantasy. Although the original
program would have been
beautiful, Gutierrez more than did
justice to the pieces he did
perform.
Haydn Sonata
The program began with the
Haydn sonata. His interpretation
was good but not exceptional.
The piece was an excellent
showcase for Gutierrez'
extraordinarily precise technique
and his delicate melodic
interpretation. He played the
numerous trills and scales in the
first and third movements with
greater clarity than this reviewer
has heard in a long time.
The syncopated passages in the
first movement were crisp and
light, perfectly timed. The passage
work in the third movement was
rapid, but every note sounded
clear. Gutierrez achieved a playful
yet stealthy effect in the
development section of the first
movement. He echoed this in the
last movement, with a flirtatious
tone in the playful gallant
passages.
The second movement of the
sonata is slow and melodic.
Gutierrez gave it a very romantic
interpretation, stretching his
rubatos as far as he dared. The
descending scales in the right hand
came over in clear, bell like
tones and ended with precise and
gentle trills. Near the end of the
movement, the sound grew richer
as a dialogue developed between
treble and bass. Gutierrez traded
off emphasis of each melody with

a calculated precision and an
underlying feeling of intensity.
The Haydn was, however, in a
few ways disappointing. Granted,
it is not a fiery, impressive piece.
Gutierrez usually showed great
skill in interpretation and
technique, but, in most of the
crescendoing passages, after a
good build-up, he would throw
away the last notes, on which he
should have arrived. This was
especially true after trills and
arpeggios where he would have to
rush to the other end of the
keyboard after his point of arrival.
Although such a fault may seem
small, it was very annoying and
spoiled to a large extent the
pleasure the piece could have
given.
Fantasy
The Schumann fantasy
followed the Haydn. The first half
was disappointing but the last half
made up for all of Gutierrez'
former transgressions.
The first movement of the
fantasy is a horror for most
pianists. It is highly emotional and
erratic. Hearing it, one can easily
see how Schumann went crazy.
Phrases build up, only to change
moods in the middle. There are
subitos, tempo changes, and
unrelated chords that pop up
without warning.
Gutierrez was able to change
moods without coming to the
dead stops a lot of pianists use. In
this way, the first movement was
more satisfying than
interpretations by far
better-known pianists. He played
the emotional, tempestuous
passages with an exceptionally
profound intenseness. In contrast,
he gave the austere second melody
a holy, unearthly aura.
Occasionally, his
emotion-loaded interpretation
became overly melodramatic,
especially in the coda. He would
over-rubato, by extending his
ritenutos a little too long, or by
broadening a little too soon.
Several times his bass notes
overwhelmed the treble melody,
giving a loud, emotional passage a
heavy overtone.
What was the most bothersome
was again Gutierrez's lack of
assertion at arrivals. This was
especially noticeable in the second
movement, a march whose bold,

self-assured chords act as a
stabilizing influence after the first
movement. The first time he
played the central theme, it
lacked boldness. Again, he did not
arrive at the climax of the
ascending forte passage.
The melodic sections between
the theme repeats were
beautifully interpreted. Gutierrez
made free use of rubato in the
melody line and achieved a
playful quality in faster passages.
The other two times Gutierrez
returned to the main theme, he
displayed all the assertiveness and
boldness he had lacked in the first
version. By the end of the
movement, he had proved he
could play bright, loud passages
without throwing away the end
notes or sounding unsure.
Entire Audience
The final movement of the
Schumann was superb. Gutierrez
won over the entire audience.
Several people were in tears by
the end of it. His singing treble
lines were beautifully clear and
expressive. In ths several powerful
crescendos, he built up gradually
and arrived definitively. The
dialogue between treble and bass
in the middle of the movement
flowed. In the "dreamy" sequence
preceding the return to his
original theme, Gutierrez once
again achieved a light, feathery
quality in the right hand as the
melody descended. When he
finished there was dead silence in
the auditorium for a moment
before the audience burst into
applause.
The rest of the concert
continued in the brilliant manner
Gutierrez set in the Schumann.
The Mendelssohn was a
combination of fiery rapid
passages and quiet, stately
sequences. Gutierrez managed to
keep every passage unmuddled,
nevef over-pedaling or missing
notes. The clarity was
extraordinary.
Gutierrez did not sacrifice
expressiveness for precision. His
accuracy complemented his

expression. Even his appoggiaturas
were perfectly timed as well as
sincerely expressed. He sounded
as if he was flirting with the piece
as his hands skipped up and down
the keyboard.
He juxtaposed a stately
melody, reminiscent of the first
movemen of Pergolesi's "Stabat
Mater," with rapid and showy
passages to form the kind of
contrast he just missed achieving
in the first part of the Schumann.
The rapid-fire octaves in the treble
just before the end boomed out
with vitality. They were followed
by a tumultuous bass and racing
arpeggios which suddenly ended
as a stately melody ended the
piece. The effect of the contrast
was stunning.
Finale
Guiterrez chose the Prokofiev
as his finale, and it proved to be a
real crowd pleaser. After it, the
audience gave him an ovation and
a chorus of bravos that
encouraged him to do two
encores.
The first movement of the
Prokofiev is incredibly turbulent.
Gutierrez evoked a feeling of
pride arid pomp in the dissonant
marching chords. The piece then
changed to a pastoral section,
done slowly and expressively,
where Gutierrez skillfully
juxtaposed three different
melodies. He achieved the bell-like
quality of the Haydn, but with far
more romantic feeling.
In the more turbulent passages,
Gutierrez used brilliant crisp
staccatos and powerful bass
octaves. As he played, he rose up
in his seat and beat the piano with
increased enthusiasm.
The second movement
provided a peaceful, steadying
contrast. Gutierrez let his
romantic tendencies hold sway.
He was so expressive that he
verged on being melodramatic. At
one point, he used a crescendoing
run to the climax of a phrase and
arrived at the top with all the
emphasis he had lacked earlier in
the program. From there he

entered a section with a lovely
treble melodv which he gradually
lightened until it became ethereal.
The ending of the movement was
delightfully peaceful.
Suddenly, Gutierrez started the
excited last movement. With the
bass line predominating, he
hammered out the main theme.
His staccatos were abrupt, like
Morse code signals; they added to
the anxious mood. There was
little room for him to show
romantic emotion. The movement
was more of a showcase for his
technical prowess. The excitement
of the piece grew. Gutierrez
reinforced it when the main
theme recapitulated by using a
vibrant, rapid treble line to
accompany and compete with it.
The sonata ended in a mass of
dissonant chords with an
unexpected subito ending.
Of the encores he did, the far
more exciting and dramatic one
was Scriabin's Etude, op. 8, No.
12, in I) sharp Minor. Another
emotional, dramatic piece which
is too often butchered, it found a
great interpreter in Gutierrez, who
used all his expressive talents and
techniques to create an intense
and powerful, yet not
melodramatic version.
Gutierrez's prowess is even
more remarkable if one considers
that he is only 23. He has won
several prizes, including the 1970
Tchaikovsky competition. He has
appeared with numerous famous
orchestras, including the Los
Angeles and New York
Philharmonics. He has a heavy
concert schedule ahead of him,
and if his performance Saturday
was any indication of his talent,
the schedule is going to get even
heavier.
