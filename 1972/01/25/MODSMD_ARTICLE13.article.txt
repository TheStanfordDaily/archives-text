Nixon Presents '73 Budget...
WASHINGTON — President Nixon rolled out a
$246.3-billion fiscal 1973 budget yesterday, unveiling two
massive deficits totaling $64.3 billion, no new tax
proposals, and a request that Congress limit spending to
"stop raids on the Treasury."
The President urged Congress to boost the level of
defense spending and to vote more money for research
and development in both military and civilian programs.
As the big document reached Capitol Hill, Nixon issued
a statement asking Congress to impose a rigid ceiling on
the $246.3-billion amount that does not "provide any
escape hatches whatever."
The big dose of deficits in fiscal 1972 and 1973 are
designed to stimulate the economy and reduce
unemployment. Nevertheless, top officials said, the jobless
rate is expected to decline to only about 5 percent at the
end of 1972. It is now 6 percent.
...And Gets Reactions
WASHINGTON — Democratic Sens. William Proxmire,
Edmund S. Muskie and Edward M. Kennedy criticized
President Nixon's new budget yesterday as being too
pro-military.
But more-conservative Democrats criticized the budget
on different grounds, including a large deficit or allegedly
faulty arithmetic.
And House Republican Leader Gerald Ford of Michigan
denounced in advance all budget criticisms by Democrats
as coming from men "who brought this nation to the
brink of economic collapse."
Proxmire, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee,
said the money saved from winding down the Indochina
war ought to be budgeted for nonmilitary spending.
Police Hunt For 'H.R. Hughes 1
ZURICH, Switzerland — Police said yesterday they have
contacted authorities in the United States and Spain in a
search for clues to a petite brunette named Helga who
cashed $650,000 worth of checks the McGraw-Hill Book
Co. paid for a purported autobiography of Howard R.
Hughes.

An official of the Swiss Credit Bank, which received
and cashed the checks made out to "H. R. Hughes," called
it a case of refined fraud.
Thus the woman became a central figure in the affair of
the autobiography put together by author Clifford Irving
and sold to McGraw-Hill and Life magazine.
Irving claims he compiled the book from interviews
with Hughes. Hughes' people deny the book is the
billionaire's autobiography.
In New York on Monday an affidavit purportedly
sworn to by Hughes was submitted in court denying the
authenticity of Irving's book and that of another author.
Berrigan Put On Trial
HARRISBURG, Pa. — The Rev. Philip Berrigan and six
others went on trial yesterday on charges they conspired
to kidnap Henry Kissinger as part of an antiwar plot. In an
interview, Berrigan acknowledged that there was a
discussion of such a possible kidnapping.
He added, "It's not a priority of ours to win acquittal,
but to conduct a political trial and get the issue before the
American people."
Soviet Fishermen Get The Book
ANCHORAGE, Alaska — The commander of a Soviet
fishing fleet and two ship masters were charged yesterday
with illegal fishing activities in U.S. waters. The three were
in charge of two Russian herring boats seized in the Bering
Sea by the U.S. Coast Guard.
The Russians, who were flown here earlier in the day
from Adak Island in the Aleutians, were released on their
own recognizance in the custody of an official of the
Soviet embassy in Washington, D.C., following
arraignment before a federal judge. A hearing on their
pleas was scheduled for Friday.
Mother Accuses Warden
SAN QUENTIN, Calif. — The mother of Soledad Brother
Fletta Drumgo accused San Quentin Warden Louis Nelson
yesterday of trying to set up another round of killing at
the prison by his treatment of men in the maximum
security Adjustment Center.
The Adjustment Center was the scene of violence Aug.
21, 1971 in which three white guards, two white inmates
and Soledad Brother George Jackson were killed. Prison
officials said Jackson was trying to escape.
Drumgo and 21 other inmates in the first tier of the
center went on a hunger strike last Monday to protest
conditions there but resumed eating Sunday.
Mrs. Inez Williams, Drumgo's mother, told a news
conference Monday that the men were not receiving hot
meals, were locked in their cells 24 hours a day, received
no exercise time and were limited to one half-hour visit a
day.
