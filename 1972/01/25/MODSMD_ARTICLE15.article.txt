# Encina Bomb Threat
## 
### 
For the second time in the past two
weeks Encina Hall employees were
kept out of their offices after a
University operator received a
telephone bomb threat at 7:50 a.m.
yesterday morning.
The female caller warned there was
a bomb set to explode within an hour,

and warned four more would go off
later on.
The Stanford Fire Department
searched the administrative building
but found nothing. At 9:15 a.m.
Encina was opened again for business
as usual.
