# Protesters Occupy Old Union, 350 Hold Eat-In At Faculty Club
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
More than 300 demonstrators
occupied first the Old Union, and later
the Faculty Club yesterday afternoon,
protesting the dismissal of Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin and discussing ways of
changing the University.
The actions followed a short rally in
White Plaza, sponsored by the
Stanford Rehabilitation Movement,
which drew 800 persons, the largest
crowd to attend a noon rally this
academic year.
More than 100 persons remained in
the Old Union throughout the
afternoon, and about 200 persons
were gathered in the lobby shortly
after 5 p.m. when the building was
declared closed by Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington and Santa
Clara Sheriff's Lt. Don Tamm.
Those inside refused to leave after
the announcement, but were forced
out 10 minutes later by about 10
Santa Clara Sheriff's deputies who
slowly moved in through rear doors.
A large crowd which then stood in
the Old Union Courtyard voted to
move to the Faculty Club to eat
dinner. When the first demonstrators
arrived at 5:38 p.m., the doors to the
private club were open, and by 6:10
p.m. more than 350 people had moved
inside.
While some food, mostly bread and
pastries, was taken from the club
kitchen, more substantial amounts
were provided by residents of
Columbae. The protestors took over
the large dining room and, using the
expensive silver and china
place-settings, helped themselves to
the food available.
When they left at 6:30 p.m. more
than $1,000 worth of silverware was
missing, according to Food Service
Director Forest Tregea. "A more
accurate estimate could only be made
after an inventory," he said.
After the main crowd left, several
people stayed to help clean up, but the
dining room was closed for the night
due to the missing food and disorder
left after the disruption.
Four Hours Long
The occupation of the Old Union,
which lasted over four hours, included
two general meetings in the lobby,
discussion groups on all three floors,

and an hour class on the topic
"people's culture" taught by Franklin.
Several offices on the ground floor
of the Union, including student
services, tiie mailroom, and the
registrar's, were closed, while others
especially on the second and third
floors continued their business,
although often behind closed doors.
There were no specific demands
formulated by the protesters, but
several topics discussed by small
groups included admissions policies,
sexism in the University, land use, the
University budget, press relations and
communications, "people's law," and
"people's medicine."
In one discussion about admissions,
the protesters talked with Dean Fred
Hargadon about his policies. Hargadon
told them that the only admission
quota Stanford still uses is for women,
and that the University "probably will
do away with it very soon."
An attempt by the ASSU Council of

Presidents to mediate a compromise
solution to the sit-in failed, according
to co-presidents Diane Fields and
Anne Kimball. The council plan was to
give those sitting in time to formulate
demands, and then to have an elected
negotiating team meet with University
officials while the rest of the
protesters moved out of the Old Union
into the women's clubhouse.
The council members talked to
Presidential Assistant John Schwartz
and Vice-Provost Robert Rosensweig.
President Lyman was not in his office,
according to Kimball. Nothing came of
the discussions, however, because
according to Kimball "they were not
flexible enough."
Jesus Saves
Between 2 and 3 p.m., while about
150 people were inside the Union
meeting in small groups, a large crowd
of about 250 gathered in the
courtyard to hear a familiar campus
personality, Hubert and leather-lunged

evangelist.
Before the police cleared the
building, there was an extended debate
about what to do if and when they
came. At about 5 p.m., a vote was
taken and it was decided to stay until
the requisite force was used to clear
them out.
The purpose of staying as long as
possible, according to long-time
activist Lenny Siegel, is so "we can
convince the presidents of all the
campuses across the country that
firing one Communist professor
creates hundreds of new
revolutionaries."
At the noon rally, a smiling
Franklin told the assembled crowd
that "we are not part of a tiny
minority, but of the overwhelming
majority of the world ... we know we
will win."
Following Franklin, ASSU professor
David Josephson suggested the crowd
