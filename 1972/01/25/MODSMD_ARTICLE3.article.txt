# Housing Proposals Stir Debate
## 
### ROBERT BACON (Fourth in a series) 
Late this year, according to present
plans, construction machinery will
begin to attack an 18-acre sloping field
at the corner of Page Mill and Peter
Coutts Roads, next to the
Frenchman's Hill Subdivision.
Critics of Stanford land policy were
indignant when the same thing
happened to Coyote Hill three years
ago. But no one expects serious
objection this time, because on Coyote
Hill is an industrial park, while on the
Peter Coutts site will be built the long
awaited, much discussed low- and
moderate-income housing project.
Depending on whom you ask, the
Peter Coutts project is a bold step
forward, a token gesture, or something
in between. For nearly everyone
concerned with Stanford's land

development program, housing is an
important issue.
20 Percent Low Income
The Peter Coutts project will
contain 225 housing units. Its
occupants will be 20 percent
low-income families, 40 percent
moderate-income, and 40 percent
middle-income. Half will be Stanford
employees; the other half, employees
in the Stanford Industrial Park,
Professional Park, and Shopping
Center.
It will be built with federal funds
from the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, and owned and
managed by the Midpeninsula Urban
Coalition. The land is leased from
Stanford.
At present, architects are preparing
the plans for the development, and the
Urban Coalition is making its

application for the federal
construction funds.
According to University Vice
President for Business and Finance,
Robert R. Augsburger, the present
schedule calls for the first tenants to
move in in mid-1973.
Augsburger, whose jurisdiction
includes Stanford's Land Resources
and Planning Offices, describes the
Peter Coutts project as "an initial step
to see if it can be done. It will be quite
an accomplishment as an initial step."
He notes that it is the largest such
subsidized housing project in Santa
Clara County and that "we must learn
how to accommodate this housing in a
community of a different nature. To
go full steam ahead is to ask for
trouble."
Others see it quite differently. Last
Friday's article in this series dealt with
industrial development of Stanford
land and concluded with the statement
"Next: Low and moderate-income
housing." Many critics of Stanford
land policy have accused the
University of acting in that way —
industrial development first, and low
and moderate-income housing "next,"
if at all.
Stanford University employs over
7,000 people. It has over 11,000
students. The Industrial Park,
Shopping Center, and Professional
Park employ over 22,000. There is not
enough housing for all of them in the
immediate area, and in many cases the
lowest paid must live the farthest from
Stanford.
The jobs are here because of
Stanford and Stanford has the largest
reserves of unused land in the area;
hence, many people say Stanford
ought to provide the necessary
housing.
Big Deficit
The low-income housing deficit
attributable to Stanford was put at
2,900 units by the faculty-staff
Moulton Committee in 1969. They
recommended the construction of
400-800 low-income units at once.
That was the genesis of the Peter
Coutts Project of 45 low-income and
90 moderate-income units.
The imbalance between those
figures has prompted charges of
insensitivity and tokenism on the

University's part. Some see the Peter
Coutts project as an insincere attempt
by the University to silence criticism
without solving the problem.
The question as to who is
responsible for housing has more than
one side. Augsburger noted recently
that "Stanford hasn't benefitted to the
extent that the (neighboring)
communities have development on
Stanford lands," hence primary
responsibility rests with Stanford's
neighbors.
President Richard Lyman pointed
out last month that Stanford's
resources, including land, must be used
for educational purposes, and not for
public service projects, housing or
otherwise.
In a KZSU debate on land use last
spring, law professor Kenneth Scott
insisted that the magnitude of the
housing deficit was such that it would
have to be dealt with by governmental
agencies. The University "would be
wiped out without making a dent in
the problem" if it made a concerted
effort to relieve the housing squeeze,
he said.
Augsburger opined: "The housing
issue has often been presented from an
emotional point of view, without a
real understanding of where the
housing stock is and where people
want to live ... I hope people obtain
the facts about housing availability.
There are homes in the Palo Alto area
advertised for sale in the $25,000
range in the newspapers. . . And some
people like to commute. We need to
provide options as to where to live —
give people a reasonably free choice
within the market."
Land values in the area are
sufficiently high that any low-income
housing must be subsidized, either by
the federal government, as is the Peter
Coutts project, or by some other
agency.
Increased Property Values
Don WilJ.i&-of the Palo Alto Tenants
Union, an organization particularly
critical of Stanford land policy, laid
the blame on Stanford for high land
values as well as the housing shortage.
"The effect of concentrating industrial
and commercial development is to
increase property values in the

support Stanford.
surrounding area, making low-income
housing impossible. That's the
situation in Palo Alto now and it can
be ascribed to Stanford," he said.
The Livingston-Blayney policy/plan
for Stanford land unveiled a year ago,
addressed the issue as follows:
"It can be argued that the
communities that derive tax revenues
from Stanford land should bear the
responsibility for providing
low-moderate income housing. But in
the Palo Alto area suitable residential
land is in extremely short supply, and
the equity of Stanford's providing a
reasonable share of needed sites is hard
to deny."
However, it also stated that "If the
(Wright) Committee's proposal that

one new housing unit be
accommodated for every two new jobs
held by household heads were
accepted, the amount of land devoted
to development, and consequently
unavailable for academic use, would
rise proportionately."
The policy/plan, described more
fully in the next article in this series,
on more than one occasion notes the
danger of ghettoization present in
construction of low-income housing
that is not integrated with
market-priced housing. It concludes by
suggesting, as does Augsburger, that
additional housing development
should not be undertaken until the
Peter Coutts project's results can be
evaluated.
Augsburger in a Daily interview

recently posed the question: "With
limited land and with Stanford being a
national and international institution
having responsibilities beyond the area
and an ability to contribute on a
national basis, I wonder which is best:
to house people or to reserve the land
for companies which could use
Stanford's basic research and apply it
on a national basis. I'm not sure which
is best."
Some have immediate answers to
that question. Others do not. Stanford
housing policy for the years after the
heavy machinery is replaced by
tenants on Peter Coutts hill, will be
shaped by the interplay of the
different priority systems that provide
different answers to that question.

occupants will be 20 percent
low-income families, 40 percent
moderate-income, and 40 percent
middle-income. Half will be Stanford
employees; the other half, employees
in the Stanford Industrial Park,
Professional Park, and Shopping
Center.
It will be built with federal funds
from the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, and owned and
managed by the Midpeninsula Urban
Coalition. The land is leased from
Stanford.
At present, architects are preparing
the plans for the development, and the
Urban Coalition is making its

application for the federal
construction funds.
According to University Vice
President for Business and Finance,
Robert R. Augsburger, the present
schedule calls for the first tenants to
move in in mid-1973.
Augsburger, whose jurisdiction
includes Stanford's Land Resources
and Planning Offices, describes the
Peter Coutts project as "an initial step
to see if it can be done. It will be quite
an accomplishment as an initial step."
He notes that it is the largest such
subsidized housing project in Santa
Clara County and that "we must learn
how to accommodate this housing in a
community of a different nature. To
go full steam ahead is to ask for
trouble."
Others see it quite differently. Last
Friday's article in this series dealt with
industrial development of Stanford
land and concluded with the statement
"Next: Low and moderate-income
housing." Many critics of Stanford
land policy have accused the
University of acting in that way —
industrial development first, and low
and moderate-income housing "next,"
if at all.
Stanford University employs over
7,000 people. It has over 11,000
students. The Industrial Park,
Shopping Center, and Professional
Park employ over 22,000. There is not
enough housing for all of them in the
immediate area, and in many cases the
lowest paid must live the farthest from
Stanford.
The jobs are here because of
Stanford and Stanford has the largest
reserves of unused land in the area;
hence, many people say Stanford
ought to provide the necessary
housing.
Big Deficit
The low-income housing deficit
attributable to Stanford was put at
2,900 units by the faculty-staff
Moulton Committee in 1969. They
recommended the construction of
400-800 low-income units at once.
That was the genesis of the Peter
Coutts Project of 45 low-income and
90 moderate-income units.
The imbalance between those
figures has prompted charges of
insensitivity and tokenism on the

University's part. Some see the Peter
Coutts project as an insincere attempt
by the University to silence criticism
without solving the problem.
The question as to who is
responsible for housing has more than
one side. Augsburger noted recently
that "Stanford hasn't benefitted to the
extent that the (neighboring)
communities have development on
Stanford lands," hence primary
responsibility rests with Stanford's
neighbors.
President Richard Lyman pointed
out last month that Stanford's
resources, including land, must be used
for educational purposes, and not for
public service projects, housing or
otherwise.
In a KZSU debate on land use last
spring, law professor Kenneth Scott
insisted that the magnitude of the
housing deficit was such that it would
have to be dealt with by governmental
agencies. The University "would be
wiped out without making a dent in
the problem" if it made a concerted
effort to relieve the housing squeeze,
he said.
Augsburger opined: "The housing
issue has often been presented from an
emotional point of view, without a
real understanding of where the
housing stock is and where people
want to live ... I hope people obtain
the facts about housing availability.
There are homes in the Palo Alto area
advertised for sale in the $25,000
range in the newspapers. . . And some
people like to commute. We need to
provide options as to where to live —
give people a reasonably free choice
within the market."
Land values in the area are
sufficiently high that any low-income
housing must be subsidized, either by
the federal government, as is the Peter
Coutts project, or by some other
agency.
Increased Property Values
Don WilJ.i&-of the Palo Alto Tenants
Union, an organization particularly
critical of Stanford land policy, laid
the blame on Stanford for high land
values as well as the housing shortage.

surrounding area, making low-income
housing impossible. That's the
situation in Palo Alto now and it can
be ascribed to Stanford," he said.
The Livingston-Blayney policy/plan
for Stanford land unveiled a year ago,
addressed the issue as follows:
"It can be argued that the
communities that derive tax revenues
from Stanford land should bear the
responsibility for providing
low-moderate income housing. But in
the Palo Alto area suitable residential
land is in extremely short supply, and
the equity of Stanford's providing a
reasonable share of needed sites is hard
to deny."
However, it also stated that "If the
(Wright) Committee's proposal that

one new housing unit be
accommodated for every two new jobs
held by household heads were
accepted, the amount of land devoted
to development, and consequently
unavailable for academic use, would
rise proportionately."
The policy/plan, described more
fully in the next article in this series,
on more than one occasion notes the
danger of ghettoization present in
construction of low-income housing
that is not integrated with
market-priced housing. It concludes by
suggesting, as does Augsburger, that
additional housing development
should not be undertaken until the
Peter Coutts project's results can be
evaluated.
Augsburger in a Daily interview

recently posed the question: "With
limited land and with Stanford being a
national and international institution
having responsibilities beyond the area
and an ability to contribute on a
national basis, I wonder which is best:
to house people or to reserve the land
for companies which could use
Stanford's basic research and apply it
on a national basis. I'm not sure which
is best."
Some have immediate answers to
that question. Others do not. Stanford
housing policy for the years after the
heavy machinery is replaced by
tenants on Peter Coutts hill, will be
shaped by the interplay of the
different priority systems that provide
different answers to that question.
(Next: The Livingston-Blayney
Policy /Plan.)
Late this year, according to present
plans, construction machinery will
begin to attack an 18-acre sloping field
at the corner of Page Mill and Peter
Coutts Roads, next to the
Frenchman's Hill Subdivision.
Critics of Stanford land policy were
indignant when the same thing
happened to Coyote Hill three years
ago. But no one expects serious
objection this time, because on Coyote
Hill is an industrial park, while on the
Peter Coutts site will be built the long
awaited, much discussed low- and
moderate-income housing project.
Depending on whom you ask, the
Peter Coutts project is a bold step
forward, a token gesture, or something
in between. For nearly everyone
concerned with Stanford's land

development program, housing is an
important issue.

He notes that it is the largest such
subsidized housing project in Santa
Clara County and that "we must learn
how to accommodate this housing in a
community of a different nature. To
go full steam ahead is to ask for
trouble."
Others see it quite differently. Last
Friday's article in this series dealt with
industrial development of Stanford
land and concluded with the statement
"Next: Low and moderate-income
housing." Many critics of Stanford
land policy have accused the
University of acting in that way —
industrial development first, and low
and moderate-income housing "next,"
if at all.
Stanford University employs over
7,000 people. It has over 11,000
students. The Industrial Park,
Shopping Center, and Professional
Park employ over 22,000. There is not
enough housing for all of them in the
immediate area, and in many cases the
lowest paid must live the farthest from
Stanford.
The jobs are here because of
Stanford and Stanford has the largest
reserves of unused land in the area;
hence, many people say Stanford
ought to provide the necessary
housing.
Big Deficit
The low-income housing deficit
attributable to Stanford was put at
2,900 units by the faculty-staff
Moulton Committee in 1969. They
recommended the construction of
400-800 low-income units at once.
That was the genesis of the Peter
Coutts Project of 45 low-income and
90 moderate-income units.
The imbalance between those
figures has prompted charges of
insensitivity and tokenism on the

University's part. Some see the Peter
Coutts project as an insincere attempt
by the University to silence criticism
without solving the problem.
The question as to who is
responsible for housing has more than
one side. Augsburger noted recently
that "Stanford hasn't benefitted to the
extent that the (neighboring)
communities have development on
Stanford lands," hence primary
responsibility rests with Stanford's
neighbors.
President Richard Lyman pointed
out last month that Stanford's
resources, including land, must be used
for educational purposes, and not for
public service projects, housing or
otherwise.
In a KZSU debate on land use last
spring, law professor Kenneth Scott
insisted that the magnitude of the
housing deficit was such that it would
have to be dealt with by governmental
agencies. The University "would be
wiped out without making a dent in
the problem" if it made a concerted
effort to relieve the housing squeeze,
he said.
Augsburger opined: "The housing
issue has often been presented from an
emotional point of view, without a
real understanding of where the
housing stock is and where people
want to live ... I hope people obtain
the facts about housing availability.
There are homes in the Palo Alto area
advertised for sale in the $25,000
range in the newspapers. . . And some
people like to commute. We need to
provide options as to where to live —
give people a reasonably free choice
within the market."
Land values in the area are
sufficiently high that any low-income
housing must be subsidized, either by
the federal government, as is the Peter
Coutts project, or by some other
agency.
Increased Property Values
Don WilJ.i&-of the Palo Alto Tenants
Union, an organization particularly
critical of Stanford land policy, laid
the blame on Stanford for high land
values as well as the housing shortage.

surrounding area, making low-income
housing impossible. That's the
situation in Palo Alto now and it can
be ascribed to Stanford," he said.
The Livingston-Blayney policy/plan
for Stanford land unveiled a year ago,
addressed the issue as follows:
"It can be argued that the
communities that derive tax revenues
from Stanford land should bear the
responsibility for providing
low-moderate income housing. But in
the Palo Alto area suitable residential
land is in extremely short supply, and
the equity of Stanford's providing a
reasonable share of needed sites is hard
to deny."
However, it also stated that "If the
(Wright) Committee's proposal that

one new housing unit be
accommodated for every two new jobs
held by household heads were
accepted, the amount of land devoted
to development, and consequently
unavailable for academic use, would
rise proportionately."
The policy/plan, described more
fully in the next article in this series,
on more than one occasion notes the
danger of ghettoization present in
construction of low-income housing
that is not integrated with
market-priced housing. It concludes by
suggesting, as does Augsburger, that
additional housing development
should not be undertaken until the
Peter Coutts project's results can be
evaluated.
Augsburger in a Daily interview

recently posed the question: "With
limited land and with Stanford being a
national and international institution
having responsibilities beyond the area
and an ability to contribute on a
national basis, I wonder which is best:
to house people or to reserve the land
for companies which could use
Stanford's basic research and apply it
on a national basis. I'm not sure which
is best."
Some have immediate answers to
that question. Others do not. Stanford
housing policy for the years after the
heavy machinery is replaced by
tenants on Peter Coutts hill, will be
shaped by the interplay of the
different priority systems that provide
different answers to that question.
(Next: The Livingston-Blayney
Policy /Plan.)
Late this year, according to present
plans, construction machinery will
begin to attack an 18-acre sloping field
at the corner of Page Mill and Peter
Coutts Roads, next to the
Frenchman's Hill Subdivision.
Critics of Stanford land policy were
indignant when the same thing
happened to Coyote Hill three years
ago. But no one expects serious
objection this time, because on Coyote
Hill is an industrial park, while on the
Peter Coutts site will be built the long
awaited, much discussed low- and
moderate-income housing project.
Depending on whom you ask, the
Peter Coutts project is a bold step
forward, a token gesture, or something
in between. For nearly everyone
concerned with Stanford's land

development program, housing is an
important issue.
20 Percent Low Income
The Peter Coutts project will
contain 225 housing units. Its
occupants will be 20 percent
low-income families, 40 percent
moderate-income, and 40 percent
middle-income. Half will be Stanford
employees; the other half, employees
in the Stanford Industrial Park,
Professional Park, and Shopping
Center.
It will be built with federal funds
from the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, and owned and
managed by the Midpeninsula Urban
Coalition. The land is leased from
Stanford.
At present, architects are preparing
the plans for the development, and the
Urban Coalition is making its

application for the federal
construction funds.
According to University Vice
President for Business and Finance,
Robert R. Augsburger, the present
schedule calls for the first tenants to
move in in mid-1973.

Park employ over 22,000. There is not
enough housing for all of them in the
immediate area, and in many cases the
lowest paid must live the farthest from
Stanford.
The jobs are here because of
Stanford and Stanford has the largest
reserves of unused land in the area;
hence, many people say Stanford
ought to provide the necessary
housing.
Big Deficit
The low-income housing deficit
attributable to Stanford was put at
2,900 units by the faculty-staff
Moulton Committee in 1969. They
recommended the construction of
400-800 low-income units at once.
That was the genesis of the Peter
Coutts Project of 45 low-income and
90 moderate-income units.
The imbalance between those
figures has prompted charges of
insensitivity and tokenism on the

University's part. Some see the Peter
Coutts project as an insincere attempt
by the University to silence criticism
without solving the problem.
The question as to who is
responsible for housing has more than
one side. Augsburger noted recently
that "Stanford hasn't benefitted to the
extent that the (neighboring)
communities have development on
Stanford lands," hence primary
responsibility rests with Stanford's
neighbors.
President Richard Lyman pointed
out last month that Stanford's
resources, including land, must be used
for educational purposes, and not for
public service projects, housing or
otherwise.
In a KZSU debate on land use last
spring, law professor Kenneth Scott
insisted that the magnitude of the
housing deficit was such that it would
have to be dealt with by governmental
agencies. The University "would be
wiped out without making a dent in
the problem" if it made a concerted
effort to relieve the housing squeeze,
he said.
Augsburger opined: "The housing
issue has often been presented from an
emotional point of view, without a
real understanding of where the
housing stock is and where people
want to live ... I hope people obtain
the facts about housing availability.
There are homes in the Palo Alto area
advertised for sale in the $25,000
range in the newspapers. . . And some
people like to commute. We need to
provide options as to where to live —
give people a reasonably free choice
within the market."
Land values in the area are
sufficiently high that any low-income
housing must be subsidized, either by
the federal government, as is the Peter
Coutts project, or by some other
agency.
Increased Property Values
Don WilJ.i&-of the Palo Alto Tenants
Union, an organization particularly
critical of Stanford land policy, laid
the blame on Stanford for high land
values as well as the housing shortage.

and commercial development is to

surrounding area, making low-income
housing impossible. That's the
situation in Palo Alto now and it can
be ascribed to Stanford," he said.
The Livingston-Blayney policy/plan
for Stanford land unveiled a year ago,
addressed the issue as follows:
"It can be argued that the
communities that derive tax revenues
from Stanford land should bear the
responsibility for providing
low-moderate income housing. But in
the Palo Alto area suitable residential
land is in extremely short supply, and
the equity of Stanford's providing a
reasonable share of needed sites is hard
to deny."
However, it also stated that "If the
(Wright) Committee's proposal that

one new housing unit be
accommodated for every two new jobs
held by household heads were
accepted, the amount of land devoted
to development, and consequently
unavailable for academic use, would
rise proportionately."
The policy/plan, described more
fully in the next article in this series,
on more than one occasion notes the
danger of ghettoization present in
construction of low-income housing
that is not integrated with
market-priced housing. It concludes by
suggesting, as does Augsburger, that
additional housing development
should not be undertaken until the
Peter Coutts project's results can be
evaluated.
Augsburger in a Daily interview

recently posed the question: "With
limited land and with Stanford being a
national and international institution
having responsibilities beyond the area
and an ability to contribute on a
national basis, I wonder which is best:
to house people or to reserve the land
for companies which could use
Stanford's basic research and apply it
on a national basis. I'm not sure which
is best."
Some have immediate answers to
that question. Others do not. Stanford
housing policy for the years after the
heavy machinery is replaced by
tenants on Peter Coutts hill, will be
shaped by the interplay of the
different priority systems that provide
different answers to that question.
(Next: The Livingston-Blayney
Policy /Plan.)
Late this year, according to present
plans, construction machinery will
begin to attack an 18-acre sloping field
at the corner of Page Mill and Peter
Coutts Roads, next to the
Frenchman's Hill Subdivision.
Critics of Stanford land policy were
indignant when the same thing
happened to Coyote Hill three years
ago. But no one expects serious
objection this time, because on Coyote
Hill is an industrial park, while on the
Peter Coutts site will be built the long
awaited, much discussed low- and
moderate-income housing project.
Depending on whom you ask, the
Peter Coutts project is a bold step
forward, a token gesture, or something
in between. For nearly everyone
concerned with Stanford's land

development program, housing is an
important issue.
20 Percent Low Income
The Peter Coutts project will
contain 225 housing units. Its
occupants will be 20 percent
low-income families, 40 percent
moderate-income, and 40 percent
middle-income. Half will be Stanford
employees; the other half, employees
in the Stanford Industrial Park,
Professional Park, and Shopping
Center.
It will be built with federal funds
from the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, and owned and
managed by the Midpeninsula Urban
Coalition. The land is leased from
Stanford.
At present, architects are preparing
the plans for the development, and the
Urban Coalition is making its

application for the federal
construction funds.
According to University Vice
President for Business and Finance,
Robert R. Augsburger, the present
schedule calls for the first tenants to
move in in mid-1973.
Augsburger, whose jurisdiction
includes Stanford's Land Resources
and Planning Offices, describes the
Peter Coutts project as "an initial step
to see if it can be done. It will be quite
an accomplishment as an initial step."
He notes that it is the largest such
subsidized housing project in Santa
Clara County and that "we must learn
how to accommodate this housing in a
community of a different nature. To
go full steam ahead is to ask for
trouble."
Others see it quite differently. Last
Friday's article in this series dealt with
industrial development of Stanford
land and concluded with the statement
"Next: Low and moderate-income
housing." Many critics of Stanford
land policy have accused the
University of acting in that way —
industrial development first, and low
and moderate-income housing "next,"
if at all.
Stanford University employs over
7,000 people. It has over 11,000
students. The Industrial Park,
Shopping Center, and Professional
Park employ over 22,000. There is not
enough housing for all of them in the
immediate area, and in many cases the
lowest paid must live the farthest from
Stanford.
The jobs are here because of

hence, many people say Stanford
