Bond Unacceptable?
Editor, THE DAILY:
"Cecilia Mc√üoskey, a member
of the Senior Class Council of
Presidents, said (Julian) Bond was
a popular choice, but 'we didn't
want someone too political up
there pushing his own little
problems ... A lot of the people
were involved in upcoming
elections and we didn't think that
would be such a good idea.'"
(The Daily, January 13, 1972)
1 have no objections to Reston.
I only have objections as to how
he was picked and the reason
given as to Bond's
unacceptability. As a member of
the Senior class I received no
inquiry about graduation speaker
which would have indicated to me
attempts at including the rest of
the graduating class in the process
of selection. James Reston could
conceivably push the political
problem of freedom of the press,
which, especially in light of recent
events, very well could involve
"upcoming elections" just as
much as anything Julian Bond
could say.

Might Makes Right?
Editor, THE DAILY:
Does might make right or does
right make might? Does an
employer have the "right" to fire
an employee? Obviously not!
Millions of workers organized
together have countered the
organized might of the employer
with the might of the employee
and made the right to fire a
wrong. Organized right can make
the might to make the right.

The lesson? What the organized
worker did for the Bruce
Franklins of the past, we,
together, can do for the Bruce
Franklin of the present and for all
the Bruce Franklins of the future.

A Note
Editor, THE DAILY:
As a former student of the
University of Cologne and
recently cand. phil. of the
University of Hamburg, presently
visiting student at Stanford for
one year, I recommend you to get
some information about the
"Studien-Kolleg" at the
University of Cologne. In short,
there are some Universities in
Germany, which prefer students
from economically wealthy
countries, or differently speaking,
which are on a similar
protectionism-level like Stanford.
Indeed the reputation of the
University of Hamburg is
increasing rather than decreasing
by the fact that Hamburg is not
any longer associated in any way
with a University like Stanford.
The recent events at Stanford are
and will be registered at Hamburg,
but in a different way than at
Cologne & Bonn.

Getting Out
Editor, THE DAILY:
We would like to point out to
the self-styled "Maoist", Bruce
Franklin, that he's wasting his
time! America could never go
"Communist": it has no Siberia.
It is Siberia.
In 1968, a few days after the

election of President Nixon,
someone wrote a letter to the
Daily complaining that the moon
had started to disappear. He
predicted that it would disappear
entirely, never to appear again.
Well, he was wrong, and so is
Bruce Franklin.
But someday, who can say
when, the residents of this
tide-bound, smog-sickened
peninsula are going to realize that
the shit's coming down, and
they're going to try to get out of
the way. When that happens,
Siberia is going to be a nice place
to be.
