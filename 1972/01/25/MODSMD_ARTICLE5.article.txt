# Words Have Consequences
## 
### 
For Concerned Asian Scholars,
the recent controversy over Bruce
Franklin raises many fundamental
issues. While Bruce's firing is
reminiscent of the Congressional
attacks made upon scholars of
Asia in the early 1950'5, it is
imperative to note one difference;
in 1950 the issue was the right of
persons to advocate policies that
differed from those of the
government; today the issue is
acting to change government
policies. The purpose of this
article, however, is not to draw
comparisons nor to raise issues
that have been ablv raised

Shoots in Asia

elsewhere (e.g. Hubert Marshall's
articles); we want to raise new and
critical questions for discussion
and action in the community.
The first point we would like
to make is that we are told that
issues of "free speech" are not
salient to this case. Depending on
which university spokesman one
listens to, there have been two
rationales advanced to support
this proposition. (1) It has been
asserted that Stanford is a
"private" institution and that
what is at issue is an employer's
right to discharge a recalcitrant
employee. Perhaps it is this
justification which brings into
focus a fundamental defect in our
system as it has evolved.
Increasing amounts of power are
becoming concentrated in
"private" corporations
(universities too) and they, like
the government, have the ability

to deprive people of their income
and basis for existence without
civil and/or criminal proceedings.
When the bill of rights was written
it was designed for a society with
few large "private" concentrations
of power, and the government was
the main concern. Now, however,
with huge concentrations of
coercive power lodged in the
"private" sector these institutions
must be forced to provide the
same guarantees that the Federal
government has been compelled
to provide.
The second justification for
saying that Franklin's case has
nothing to do with "free speech"

is the feeling that Bruce can say
what he wants, but what the
adninistration objects to is "his
doing it," or getting others to "do
it." We feel, however, that if
verbiage is worth anything it must
have action consequences. If we
admit that all but the most
inconsequential drivel has action
consequences, we must look at
the community that is affected by
those actions. The university
administration has, in this case,
arbitrarily defined the limits of its
gaze to the action consequences
that arise on this 9,000 acre
campus; clearly, if this is the only
relevant community, the action
consequences of Bruce's words
have been disruptive.
But, let's look beyond this
9,000 acres to the thousands of
square miles that have been laid
barren in Asia; these, too, can be
viewed as the action consequences
lof verbiage on this campus,
. whether it be the talk of Henry
j Cabot Lodge, David Packard or
| some of the scientists on this
! campus who use the university as
a platform to preach the need for
' ever-larger defense expenditures,
j In short, much speech on this

campus has consequences, and in
the scheme of things, Franklin's
h as been relatively
inconsequential.
A second broad question we
would like to specifically address
to the administration is, why was
Gamut-H's computer simulation
of an invasion of North Vietnam
on campus in the first place? Was
this not in moral, if not legal,
violation of the university's
committment to sever all ties with
S.R.I, and the promise that no
classified research would be
conducted on campus? If the
administration was unaware of the
project's presence on campus, has
disciplinary action been taken
against those who brought it here?
While we are anxiously awaiting
an answer to this question we
have one last question which is
related.
Given that Gamut-H was on
campus, and given that this
project had potentially
catastrophic consequences for
many hundreds of thousands of
people (ourselves included), what
is an appropriate means to stop
such a breach of both faith and
reason? Certainly, the sit-in has
become almost an accepted
non-violent tactic to force
calcified institutions to change.
(We are quite sure that most of
the administration approved of
the action of many Stanford
students in the early 60's, who sat
in throughout the South in order
to achieve a minimum of progress
for black people. Is it not possible
that the University has become as
calcified as those governments in
the South which we all have
condemned?)
One concluding thought.
America's tradition is not one of
an unyielding legalism; it is a
revolutionary tradition that is
formalized in Jefferson's writings
and the Declaration of
Independence. Whether
institutions like it or not, they are
getting more power and the
consequences of their actions are
daily more widespread; they will
have to broaden their perspective
or suffer the wrath of people who
will neither oppress nor be
oppressed.

"private" sector these institutions
must be forced to provide the
same guarantees that the Federal
government has been compelled
to provide.
The second justification for
saying that Franklin's case has
nothing to do with "free speech"

is the feeling that Bruce can say
what he wants, but what the
adninistration objects to is "his
doing it," or getting others to "do
it." We feel, however, that if
verbiage is worth anything it must
have action consequences. If we
admit that all but the most
inconsequential drivel has action
consequences, we must look at
the community that is affected by
those actions. The university
administration has, in this case,
arbitrarily defined the limits of its
gaze to the action consequences
that arise on this 9,000 acre
campus; clearly, if this is the only
relevant community, the action
consequences of Bruce's words
have been disruptive.
But, let's look beyond this
9,000 acres to the thousands of
square miles that have been laid
barren in Asia; these, too, can be
viewed as the action consequences
lof verbiage on this campus,
. whether it be the talk of Henry
j Cabot Lodge, David Packard or
| some of the scientists on this
! campus who use the university as
a platform to preach the need for
' ever-larger defense expenditures,
j In short, much speech on this

campus has consequences, and in
the scheme of things, Franklin's
h as been relatively
inconsequential.
A second broad question we
would like to specifically address
to the administration is, why was
Gamut-H's computer simulation
of an invasion of North Vietnam
on campus in the first place? Was
this not in moral, if not legal,
violation of the university's
committment to sever all ties with
S.R.I, and the promise that no
classified research would be
conducted on campus? If the
administration was unaware of the
project's presence on campus, has
disciplinary action been taken
against those who brought it here?
While we are anxiously awaiting
an answer to this question we
have one last question which is
related.
Given that Gamut-H was on
campus, and given that this
project had potentially
catastrophic consequences for
many hundreds of thousands of
people (ourselves included), what
is an appropriate means to stop
such a breach of both faith and
reason? Certainly, the sit-in has
become almost an accepted
non-violent tactic to force
calcified institutions to change.
(We are quite sure that most of
the administration approved of
the action of many Stanford
students in the early 60's, who sat
in throughout the South in order
to achieve a minimum of progress
for black people. Is it not possible
that the University has become as
calcified as those governments in
the South which we all have
condemned?)
One concluding thought.
America's tradition is not one of
an unyielding legalism; it is a
revolutionary tradition that is
formalized in Jefferson's writings
and the Declaration of
Independence. Whether
institutions like it or not, they are
getting more power and the
consequences of their actions are
daily more widespread; they will
have to broaden their perspective
or suffer the wrath of people who
will neither oppress nor be
oppressed.
For Concerned Asian Scholars,
the recent controversy over Bruce
Franklin raises many fundamental
issues. While Bruce's firing is
reminiscent of the Congressional
attacks made upon scholars of
Asia in the early 1950'5, it is
imperative to note one difference;
in 1950 the issue was the right of
persons to advocate policies that
differed from those of the
government; today the issue is
acting to change government
policies. The purpose of this
article, however, is not to draw
comparisons nor to raise issues
that have been ablv raised

Shoots in Asia

elsewhere (e.g. Hubert Marshall's
articles); we want to raise new and
critical questions for discussion
and action in the community.
The first point we would like
to make is that we are told that
issues of "free speech" are not
salient to this case. Depending on
which university spokesman one
listens to, there have been two
rationales advanced to support
this proposition. (1) It has been
asserted that Stanford is a
"private" institution and that
what is at issue is an employer's
right to discharge a recalcitrant
employee. Perhaps it is this
justification which brings into
focus a fundamental defect in our
system as it has evolved.
Increasing amounts of power are
becoming concentrated in
"private" corporations
(universities too) and they, like
the government, have the ability

to deprive people of their income
and basis for existence without
civil and/or criminal proceedings.
When the bill of rights was written
it was designed for a society with
few large "private" concentrations
of power, and the government was
the main concern. Now, however,
with huge concentrations of
coercive power lodged in the
"private" sector these institutions
must be forced to provide the

this not in moral, if not legal,
violation of the university's
committment to sever all ties with
S.R.I, and the promise that no
classified research would be
conducted on campus? If the
administration was unaware of the
project's presence on campus, has
disciplinary action been taken
against those who brought it here?
While we are anxiously awaiting
an answer to this question we
have one last question which is
related.
Given that Gamut-H was on
campus, and given that this
project had potentially
catastrophic consequences for
many hundreds of thousands of
people (ourselves included), what
is an appropriate means to stop
such a breach of both faith and
reason? Certainly, the sit-in has
become almost an accepted
non-violent tactic to force
calcified institutions to change.
(We are quite sure that most of
the administration approved of
the action of many Stanford
students in the early 60's, who sat
in throughout the South in order
to achieve a minimum of progress
for black people. Is it not possible
that the University has become as
calcified as those governments in
the South which we all have
condemned?)
One concluding thought.
America's tradition is not one of
an unyielding legalism; it is a
revolutionary tradition that is
formalized in Jefferson's writings
and the Declaration of
Independence. Whether
institutions like it or not, they are
getting more power and the
consequences of their actions are
daily more widespread; they will
have to broaden their perspective
or suffer the wrath of people who
will neither oppress nor be
oppressed.
For Concerned Asian Scholars,
the recent controversy over Bruce
Franklin raises many fundamental
issues. While Bruce's firing is
reminiscent of the Congressional
attacks made upon scholars of
Asia in the early 1950'5, it is
imperative to note one difference;
in 1950 the issue was the right of
persons to advocate policies that
differed from those of the
government; today the issue is
acting to change government
policies. The purpose of this
article, however, is not to draw
comparisons nor to raise issues
that have been ablv raised

Shoots in Asia

elsewhere (e.g. Hubert Marshall's
articles); we want to raise new and
critical questions for discussion
and action in the community.
The first point we would like
to make is that we are told that
issues of "free speech" are not
salient to this case. Depending on
which university spokesman one
listens to, there have been two
rationales advanced to support
this proposition. (1) It has been
asserted that Stanford is a
"private" institution and that
what is at issue is an employer's
right to discharge a recalcitrant
employee. Perhaps it is this
justification which brings into
focus a fundamental defect in our
system as it has evolved.
Increasing amounts of power are
becoming concentrated in
"private" corporations
(universities too) and they, like
the government, have the ability

to deprive people of their income
and basis for existence without
civil and/or criminal proceedings.
When the bill of rights was written
it was designed for a society with
few large "private" concentrations
of power, and the government was
the main concern. Now, however,
with huge concentrations of
coercive power lodged in the
"private" sector these institutions
must be forced to provide the
same guarantees that the Federal
government has been compelled
to provide.
The second justification for
saying that Franklin's case has
nothing to do with "free speech"

is the feeling that Bruce can say
what he wants, but what the
adninistration objects to is "his
doing it," or getting others to "do
it." We feel, however, that if
verbiage is worth anything it must
have action consequences. If we
admit that all but the most
inconsequential drivel has action
consequences, we must look at
the community that is affected by
those actions. The university
administration has, in this case,
arbitrarily defined the limits of its
gaze to the action consequences
that arise on this 9,000 acre
campus; clearly, if this is the only
relevant community, the action
consequences of Bruce's words
have been disruptive.
But, let's look beyond this
9,000 acres to the thousands of
square miles that have been laid
barren in Asia; these, too, can be
viewed as the action consequences
lof verbiage on this campus,
. whether it be the talk of Henry
j Cabot Lodge, David Packard or
| some of the scientists on this
! campus who use the university as
a platform to preach the need for
' ever-larger defense expenditures,
j In short, much speech on this

campus has consequences, and in
the scheme of things, Franklin's
h as been relatively
inconsequential.
A second broad question we
would like to specifically address
to the administration is, why was
Gamut-H's computer simulation
of an invasion of North Vietnam
on campus in the first place? Was
this not in moral, if not legal,
violation of the university's
committment to sever all ties with
S.R.I, and the promise that no
classified research would be
conducted on campus? If the
administration was unaware of the
project's presence on campus, has
disciplinary action been taken
against those who brought it here?
While we are anxiously awaiting
an answer to this question we
have one last question which is
related.
