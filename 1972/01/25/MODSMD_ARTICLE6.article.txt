## Allende Government Making Some Progress 
### 
Jed Hepworth's analysis of
Chile under President Allende (the
Daily, Friday, January 21) betrays
a very basic lack of understanding
of the social changes which are
now unfolding in that country.
Mr. Hepworth's concern "as a
foreigner who loves Chile" bears
remarkable historical similarities
to worries voiced by British
nationals who loved their India of
the 1890's, Frenchmen trembling
over the fate of the Algeria they
loved, and the American fears
which prompted our intervention
in the Dominican Republic in
1965. While much of what Jed
says is true, and the Allende
government is indeed running into
serious economic problems, the
difficulties that Jed describes are
minor when compared to the

problems which are being
attacked. By ignoring the
entrenched political and economic
structure which Allende is
attacking, the stagnating
consequences of structure,
and the causes of Allende's
miseries, Jed has distorted the
meaning of most of what he saw
during his stay in Chile.
Jed's view of the present
tension is that ". . .it means the
end of a unique political
atmosphere which the Chileans
have so long fostered and
maintained." That "unique
political atmosphere" was one in
which all major political parties,
until recent years, staged their
electoral battles for the main
purpose of maximizing their share
of government appointments and
benefits, and dividing them up
among those in control.
Traditionally, Chilean electoral
strategy has consisted of
promising enough reform to gain
mass support, and then delivering
as little of it as possible.
It comes as no surprise to the
student of Chilean politics to find
both the Socialist party
(Allende's) and the Chilean Nazi
Party together in a coalition in
1937; one is even less surprised to
find that the one truly reformist
government elected in this
century (that of Pedro Aguirre
Carda, in the late 1930'5) had
most of its programs castrated by
powerful rightist opposition. And
if you go back far enough, you
find that the legenday liberator of
Chile, Bernardo O'Higgins, was
ousted from the presidency by a
strong bloc of large landowners
opposed to the massive land
reform and other social programs
proposed by O'Higgins in the late
nineteenth century.
Unique Situation
One hundred years later,
Chile's "unique political
atmosphere" still continues to
have "unique" effects on the
economic and social structure of
the country. What Mr. Hepworth
judiciously refers to as "the
Chilean flair for politics" has led
to a situation where:
—in 1968, one percent of the
population controlled ten percent
of the national income
—between 1960 and 1970, the
income share of manual workers
in the national income declined
from 18.4 to 16.2 percent (the
"impatience of the urban poor"
which Jed thinks "cost the
Christian Democrats the election
of 1970")
—the share of national income
earned by the twenty percent of
poorest families in "progressive"
Chile is well below the Latin
American average
—the average growth of per
capita national product in the last
decade has been less than 1.8 per
cent per year, and since 1967 has
shown almost no growth
—an unemployment rate, in
1970 when Allende took office,
of 22.5 percent of the labor force
in Santiago, and 8.6 percent for
the country as a whole
—an annual rate of inflation of
35.6 percent.
Expansion
Since Dr. Allende has come to
office, the "once optimistic
Chileans" have seen the share of
the working class in the national
income expanded from 51 percent
to 60 percent, have seen their

growth rate for national income
boosted to 8 percent, have seen
unemployment cut to under 4.8
percent (the lowest since 1956),
and have had the inflation rate cut
to under 20 percent. Those
policies, too, are part and parcel
of "the failures and aggressions of
the Unidad Popular".
Jed goes on to pinpoint what
he considers to be some specific
failures of the Unidad Popular. He
notes that the nationalization of
the big American copper
companies, while "an extremely
popular move at home," resulted
in a disastrous price drop on
world copper markets as the

20 billion dolalrs of capital, the
artificially set prices used to
inflate profits and avoid Chilean
taxation, and the foreign control
of Chilean resources were
historical fact. If any fault is to be
attributed in the present debacle
of copper, it is not to the
attempts of the Allende
government to reestablish control
over Chilean resources, but to the
economic warfare being waged by
American copper companies and
the United States government
against a Chile that has taken
action to control her own
resources.
Similarly, phrasing Chile's

Traditionally, Chilean electoral strategy
has consisted of promising enough reform
to gain mass support, and then delivering
as little of it as possible

United States withdrew price
supports for Chilean copper,
which accounts for 80 percent of
Chile's foreign exchange earnings.
The context of American
copper operations in Chile,
though, is ignored. For one thing,
the drop in the price of copper
was to a large extent caused by
massive stockpiling of copper
reserves by the copper companies
over a period of years in
anticipation of future
expropriation by the Chilean
government. Secondly, Chile's
copper industry has few facilities
to actually process the copper
mined within its borders.
Large Share
American copper companies in
the U.S. purchased an extremely
large share of the copper mined
by American companies in Chile;
prices were set at artificially low
levels for raw Chilean copper to
enable U.S. processing industries
to hold down the price of inputs,
duck Chilean taxes, and make
much larger profits. Part of the
cost of our Vietnamese
adventures, for example, was
passed on to Chile; in 1966 Chile
was obliged to sell 90,000 tons of
copper to the U.S. strategic
reserve at the price of 36 cents a
pound, while the price on the
London metal market was 60
cents a pound.
The expropriation of the
American copper companies
without indemnification,
incidentally, did not start out that
way. Chile agreed to compensate
the American corporations, but
first stipulated that excess profits,
defined as any profits over about
10 percent of cost, were to be
deducted from the
indemnification. Oddly enough,
those "excess" profits just about
covered the cost of
indemnification. As a matter of
fact, profits withdrawn from Chile
by foreign capital (which in 1968
controlled one-sixth of all Chilean
manufacturing, and in 1970
controlled 80 percent of the
copper industry) in foreign
exchange in 1967 represented
almost 20 percent of total current
income.
The 90 billion dollars in profits
reaped on an initial investment of

mounting balance of payments
problem in terms of increasing
food imports, as Jed does, does
real damage to any objective
analysis of Chile's foreign
exchange imbalance. 1971
imports registered an increase of
only six percent, and are of small
significance in explaining the
growing deficit.
The real drains on Chile's
foreign exchange are from the
outside. Annual service of Chile's
foreign debt siphons away 35
percent of the nation's export
earnings, which explains why
Chile is now attempting to
renegotiate the foreign debt. But
severe drops in the price of
copper, estimated at 41 percent in
the last 18 months, have lost Chile
much of the needed foreign
exchange which it needs to fight
its deteriorating trade position.
American economic warfare
against Chilean copper bears a
heavy burden in any factual
analysis of the exchange problem.
When Jed turns to the subject
of food shortages in Chile, he asks
us to remember that "most of the
wage increases and food shortages
affect the poor". When
discussiong shortages of beef,
though, its important to first state
ihat there is no ueda, no rationing
q leue for beef, south of Talca,
Chile, which encompasses about
half of Chile geographically. And
in those areas where it is rationed,
which do contain the largest part
of the Chilean population, the
consumption of beef is no longer
determined by income
distribution.
Concrete Steps
While it is true that
mechanisms by which the rich can
evade meat rationing do exist, the
most important fact is that
concrete steps are being taken
through the freezing of prices and
increases of wages to redistribute
real income in Chile. As the large
estates are gradually being
expropriated, some economic
sabotage by the former owners
and production inefficiencies on
the part of the new owners has
contributed to drops in
agricultural production.
But the major contributing
factor to the queues and food
shortages has been that people
who have never been able to buy
beef before, and school children

who have never been able to drink
milk before, are now able to do
these things. Supplies of these
products which were "adequate"
to satisfy the needs of the rich,
are no longer large enough to
meet the demand of far larger
masses of people who now for the
first time have the means to buy
them.
What the world perceives as the
Chilean experiment, a
revolutionary process involving
sacrifices, struggle against internal
conflicts, and class interests, is
depicted by Jed in such terms as
"new feeling of malice",
"suffering exacerbated", and
"hollow promises." Fidel Castro,
during his record-breaking tour of
Chile's entirety, responded to a
student query about "the Chilean
road to socialism," saying, "When
is a process a revolution? Only
when the changes are
irreversible." That every
transitionary stage of a
revolutionary process cannot be
assured peaceful, without malice,
and without hardship is evident.
Creative Expressions
The spirit now sweeping Chile's
poor and oppressed masses in
urban slums, peasant
encampments, mines, and
factories manifests itself in many
creative expressions. Those
"garish walls" learning political
slogans also contain incredibly
moving artwork, those
mushrooming callampas now are
beaming with pride, reflected in
Latin America's only monument
to Che Guevara, the "illegally
occupied" newly-built
communities named Venceremos,
and New Havana. Chile's
aboriginal Mapuche Indians,
legally exterminated for years and
forced to live on reservations
called "decimations", now are
reclaiming their rights to their
lands. Their agrarian collective
society (somewhat anarchistic)
may be revived with
modifications.
Chile's national slogans have
been "El cobre es nuestro sueldo,
y la tierra es nuestro pan."
(Copper is our wages, and the land
is our bread.)
When you look at Chilean
society today, this basic direction
toward a campaign of national
development has impregnated the
entire fabric of national life. The
activism of Chilean university
students has directed itself toward
tne national goal of service as
well; over 30 per cent of these
concerned students have
committed themselves to
extensive programs of
development fieldwork all over
Chile.
What becomes apparent to the
perceptive observer is not that the
Allende government's reforms
have caused widespread unrest,
but that widespread
dissatisfaction with the slow pace
of Chilean development has led
directly to the installment of the
Allende government and all that it
stands for. When you are
surrounded by 50,000 people in a
plaza in Santiago who are
shouting "Allende, Allende" until
their throats are as raw as the chill
wind around them, the point is
driven home that their cry
describes not a man, but a wave
that is sweeping our hemisphere.
