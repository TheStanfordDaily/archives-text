## Stillwell Speaks On Medical School REDHOT ROUNDUP 
### 
Kditor, THE DAILY:
One can only marvel at the
process of bastardization of the
concept of academic freedom now
taking place in the rhetoric
surrounding Professor Franklin's
pending dismissal. The parade of
professors at Wednesday's White
Plaza rally emphasized this theme
of academic freedom, many,j
though not all, of the speakers |
asserting that Professor Franklin j
and his "uncomfortably |
heterodox" views are being j
silenced, his freedom of i
expression abridged. Hut surely j
there is a point at which ;
"expression" ceases to be |
academic. The Advisory Board
determined that Professor
Franklin passed this point. As far
as I am concerned, Professor
Franklin is quite welcome to
present in the classroom his
analysis of Moby Dick, Chairman
Mao, or the Soledad Brothers
from now until China freezes
over; it is only unfortunate that
his peculiar ideology includes
active implementation as an
imperative part of its expression.
Illuminating also was the
report in Wednesday's Daily of
the disruption of Professor
William Shockley's Electrical
Engineering class. I for one
eagerly await the rush of faculty
and concerned students to the
defense of this beleaguered
scholar's academic freedom. Are
not some of Professor Shockley's
views uncomfortably heterodox
enough to render their expression
of value to this academic
community?

Editor, THE DAILY:
I may not be as conservative an
old fart as some of the alums who

have been knocking the Band. So
I'd like to put in a few good
words for the Band.
1 think anyone associated with
Stanford should be proud of the
Band! They really get it together
musically and in spirit without
having to conform to the
constipated tin soldier image of

The Stanford Pre-Med Club
(formerly known as Sigma Phi
Sigma) hosted Dr. Donald
Stil well's annual address on
applying to Medical School last
week. The Associate Professor of
Anatomy at Stanford Medical
School stressed that "the
fundamentals are not evident in
Medical School catalogues," and
only through personal contact can
a student truly learn about a
Medical School.
Emphasis of the speech fell on
things that the candidate applying
this summer to Medical School
should be in the process of doing
now. Getting a Pre-Med advisor,
making sure all class reuirements
are fulfilled, writing away for
catalogues and applications, and
preparing for the MCAT (Medical
College Admissions Test) in May
constitute activities which should
be presently occupying applicants.
Dr. Stilwell encouraged
applicants to apply to some
schools they felt slightly above
their level of achievement, some
at the level of their achievement.

other marching bands.
Each member does
not look just like all the other
members. Each is an individual
contributing to the total great
sound of The Incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band, (or whatever its
official ''tie is) j an Jacobsen

and possibly a few "safety valve"
schools. Criteria to be considered
by the applicant include class size,
location, academic quality,
grading procedure, and a number
of more subtle attributes to be
evaluated only through personal
contact when visiting each of the
schools. Dr. Stilwell urged all
applicants to visit as many schools
as possible.
The talk concluded with a
discussion of the admission
criteria including CPA, MCAT
scores, letters of recommendation.

personal statements, and
successful interviews which can all
insure the applicant's admission to
the school of his choice.

Burr Field, the Stanford
Pre-Med Club president
announced the schedule of events
for the coming quarters. February
3 at 8:00 p.m. Dr. Linus Pauling
will speak about his career.
February 9, Wells Shoemacker, a
fifth year medical student will
discuss Community Medicine
using the Stanford run Livingston
Clinic as a case study. February

23, Dr. DePraw of the Stanford
Medical Center reviews his work
in Tissue Research using the
Electron Microscope, and later
that week will be opening his
laboratory to interested students.
Programs for Spring include an
address by Dr. Arthur Romberg
on April 19.
Above events are open to the
public. Members of the club,
additional activities open to them
including the DAY WITH A
DOCTOR program at Palo Alto
Medical Clinic and a fieldtrip to

San Francisco General Hospital to
tour surgical facilities. The
Livingston Clinic and the East
Palo Alto Clinic may also be
toured according to the club
president.
A new organization for
pre-medical students which will
"supplement the present
organization," according to its
founders recently registered with
the Dean of Students. The
Stanford Pre-Medical REDIIOT
Association, founded by Dave
Riss, Chris Teter, Eric Borgstrom,
and Bob Hook plans "a reduction

of throat cuting and competition,
a heightening of self-awareness in
the pre-medical environment, and
the creation of a bit of humor in
facing this predicament."
The organization emerged from
a desire by its founders to ease
social interaction among pre-meds
and to help give them a sense of
humor and a "chance to make fun
of the pre-med 1 predicament."
While no definite plans fill the
club's agenda, tentative activities
include discussion groups,
meetings with medical students,
informal get-togethers, and the
initiation of a file on medical
schools. Such a file would contain
reactions of students who had
interviewed at a certain medical
school so students interested in
that school could learn more
about it through someone's
personal experiences.
One of the founders noted that
"if the schools have a file on you.
why shouldn't you have a file on
them?" The founders encourage
any interested students to contact
them with ideas for club activities.

RED HOT ROUNDUP will
remain available to anyone with
information of interest to
pre-meds.
