# Youths, Blacks Seek Political Power
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Over 250 students from 71
Northern California colleges
gathered at a National Youth
Caucus (NYC) conference
Saturday in an effort to insure
maximum representation of 18-24
year-olds at the 1972 Democratic
National Convention. The
conference was held at San Jose
State College.
A California Black Caucus also
met Saturday at Garden Oaks
School in East Palo Alto, drawing
about 300 blacks from Northern
California.
Assemblyman Willie Brown
(Dem—San Francisco) told the
delegates that a solid
concentration of black political
power could give them
considerable influence at the
Democratic National Convention in
Miami in July.
He encouraged them to vote
for a black candidate on the first
ballot at the convention, no
matter who they might actually
be supporting. Rep. Shirley
Chisholm (Dem—New York) is the
only black candidate so far.
Both meetings discussed youth
representation at the February 12
district caucuses which each
presidential candidate will hold to
recommend a slate of pledged
delegates and a representative to
the candidate's state organizing
committee.
Rules adopted by the
Democratic National Committee

require that 18-24 year-olds make
up about 15% of each state's
delegation.
In accordance with the state
legislature's reapportionment of
congressional districts, which was
upheld Thursday by the Supreme
Court, Stanford will be included
in the new 17th Congressional
District. Included along with the
University are Palo Alto,
Mountain View, Sunnyvale,
eastern San Jose, and southern
San Mateo County.
Leading the Stanford
delegation to the youth
conference were ASSU
Co-President Larry Diamond,
Paula Johnson, Joel Kenwood,
Connie Peterson and Zach
Zwerdling. They are the five
members of the central committee
of Northern California's NYC
Conference. Diamond also serves
as State Chairman of the
California NYC.
Sen. Alan Cranston
(Dem—Calif.) told the opening
session of the conference that the
NYC "can do a lot to shape the
choices this nation and this state
make next year." He added that
he shared young people's
"frustration over the way things
are going", but that he also
believed that "change can be
achieved with a little more effort
and organization."
Like Cranston, State
Assemblyman Ken Meade
(Dem—Berkeley) spoke of the

power of young people in the
elctoral process. Meade noted that
in 1968 President Nixon carried
California by 500,000 votes and
that there will be at least 1.5
million 18-24 year olds casting
their first votes in 1972.
Taking these figures into
account, Meade said that
"without carrying California,
Nixon would not have been
elected President in 1968 and the
youth vote assures that he will not
win in 1972." He advised "Don't
just work within the system, take
advantage of it."
San Francisco Sheriff Richard
Hongisto claimed that "policemen
are moving us towards a police
state from the bottom all the way
up to Attorney General John
Mitchell." Hongisto, who has been
a law enforcement officer for
several years, was the upset
winner in his race to be elected
Sheriff last year. He urged his
audience to "work to destroy
those racist, sexist stereotypes of
our decadent society."
National Chairman of
Americans for Democratic Action
(ADA) Allard K. Lowenstein, a
former New York Congressman
and organizer of the 1968 "Dump
Johnson" movement, said that
"four more years of an
administration steeped in
deception" would be severely
damaging to "the whole fabric of
freedom in this country."
Lowenstein said "if you add 25

million young voters to the
political equation, just try to
figure out some way that Nixon
can be reelected—l don't think he
can be."
After the speeches, workshops
were held on various aspects of
youth participation in the
Democratic party. The most
important of these workshops
dealt with the delegate selection
process and California's new
election laws. The February 12
candidate caucuses by
congressional district were

discussed at this workshop.
Other workshop sessions were
held on voter registration
techniques, deadlines and laws
and on methods of dealing with
the press.
Speakers at the closing session
of the conference were state
Assemblyman John Burton,
former Stanford Black Student
Union president Leo Bazile, and
Yvonne Westbrook unsuccessful
candidate last year for the San
Francisco Board of Supervisors.
