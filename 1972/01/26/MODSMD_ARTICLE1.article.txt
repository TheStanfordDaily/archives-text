# Nixon Reveals Secret Peace Efforts
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
President Nixon last night disclosed a plan
for peace in Indochina which he said had been
secretly presented to the North Vietnamese and
Viet Cong last October 11. To date, he said,
they had ignored it.
The plan calls for total withdrawal of "U.S.
ar.d allied" forces from South Vietnam within
six months of agreement to the plan, a
simultaneous total exchange of prisoners, a
cease-fire throughout Indochina, and
independently-supervised elections in South
Vietnam.
As part of Nixon's peace proposal, South
Vietnamese President Ngoyen Van Thieu would
resign a month before the new election, and a
caretaker government would administer the
nation during the interim. However, the
election of a new government would be strictly
under international control.
The election would include representatives of
"all political forces in South Vietnam, including
the National Liberation Front," Nixon said.
Thieu Goes Along
In a simultaneous broadcast in Saigon, Thieu
confirmed that he has offered to resign as part
of such a settlement.
Nixon revealed that over the past two and a
half years Presidential adviser Henry Kissinger
has made twelve trips to Paris to conduct secret

negotiations.
Until recently, he the secret talks
"showed signs of yielding some progress," but
now "it is my judgment that purposes of
peace will best be served by bringing out
publicly the proposals we have been making in
private."
The Chief Executive stressed that disclosing
full details of the negotiations "will prove
beyond doubt which side has made every effort
to make these negotiations succeed. It will
show unmistakably that Hanoi—not Washington
or Saigon—has made the war go on."
Two Proposals
He said U.S. negotiators made two secret
proposals last year which were turned down by
the Communists. They insisted that the Thieu
regime in South Vietnam be overthrown, Nixon
said. The United States will never "join our
enemy to overthrow our ally," he vowed.
There had been speculation in Washington
yesterday that Nixon would announce a
withdrawal date for United States troops in
Indochina in exchange for release of American
prisoners in North Vietnam. Senator Edward
Brooke (R—Mass.) indicated on Monday that
such a proposal was in the offing.
The other four points of Nixon's peace
proposal are:
—a return to the 1954 and 1962 Geneva

accords which prohibit foreign intervention in
Indochina.
—international supervision of the military
withdrawals.
—a requirement that all armed forces remain
within their national frontiers (aimed
principally at North Vietnam).
— international guarantees of the
fundamental rights of the Indochinese people.
End War
The President said he wanted "to end this
war not just for the United States, but for all
the people of Indochina.
"We remain prepared to undertake a major
construction program throughout Indochina,
including North Vietnam, to help all those
people to recover from the ravages of a
generation of war," Nixon stated.
Nixon said the United States offered a
withdrawal deadline in exchange for the return
of all U.S. prisoners and a cease fire on May 31,
1971. North Vietnam rejected this offer.
Offers Rejected
Last summer Communist negotiators
presented a seven-point public peace plan and a
nine-point one in private, both calling for U.S.
abandonment of the Thieu regime. The United
States rejected both and offered a total
withdrawal within nine months of an
agreement. North Vietnam rejected this offer,

Nixon said.
He added that after the United States
responded secretly to the Communist
initiatives, North Vietnam publicly berated the
U.S. for not responding. According to the
President, they did so in order "to stir up
divisiveness in the United States."
The eight-point plan that he described "lies
ignored in a secret channel while the enemy
tries again for military victory," the President
said.
He called his initiative "the most
comprehensive peace plan of this conflict."
Nixon addressed the nation via radio and
television from the White House for fifteen
minutes yesterday evening. The broadcast was
not announced until yesterday morning.
"If the enemy rejects this," Nixon said, we
will continue the Vietnamization program; if
they respond with increased military
operations, he said he would in his capacity as
Commander in Chief move to protect our
remaining troops.
At one point Nixon said "honest, patriotic
Americans" could disagree on Indochina policy,
but later in the speech he spoke of those in
America who thing "whatever our government
says must be false and whatever our enemies
say must be true." Nixon declared the record
"proves the contrary."
