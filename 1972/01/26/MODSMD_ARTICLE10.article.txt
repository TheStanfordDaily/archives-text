Killing Time
Editor, THE DAILY:
Allow me to present a theory:
the reason some college students
are currently apolitical, unradical,
non-active in non-academic
activities, generally straight, is
that those students feel much
more secure being so.
A cause can be too easily won
or lost, eliminated as something to
do, and then an often difficult
choice must be made as to what
new activity to undertake.
However, if a person accepts as a
value that to learn is good in itself
no matter what the practical
aspects of that learning, that
person has immediately given
himself something to do for at
least four years.
Going to school becomes
steady, secure entertainment,
much like sitting down for an
evening of "My Three Sons,"
"Ozzie and Harriet," "Green
Acres," "Beverly Hillbillies,"
"Gilligan's Island," "Bewitched,"
and"The Donna Reed Show."
What you do may not be exciting
or stimulating, but it won't be
painful and will be mildly
entertaining and will guarantee
you something to do for a given
time span.
The choice to watch TV is
good for three and one half hours
of prime time, longer if you watch
the news and a talk show, and
allows you the sense of
controlling the programming by
switching channels ("The Brady
Bunch" or "Family Affair?")
The choice to attend college is
good for four years, longer if you
work toward a master's decree

and a doctorate, and gives you the
sense of controlling the
programming by selecting courses
(Economics I or Hinduism?).
You may sometimes feel
trapped by your studies (Why am
I working so hard to learn
something I'll forget by next
quarter?), but television viewers
sometimes feel bound to their sets
(I won't find anything better to
do.). Entertainment of any kind
can pall.
I make no pretense that my
analogy applies to all college
students nor to all television
watchers. However I have had
experience in both occupations,
so I know that such an analogy is
not without basis, even if that
basis be only myself, in the
occasionally gruesome quest for
something, anything to do.

Huxley
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the words of Aldous Huxley:
"These millions of abnormally
normal people, living without fuss
in a society to which, if they were
fully human beings, they ought
not to be adjusted, still cherish
'the illusion of individuality,' but
in fact they have been to a great
extent deindividualized. Their
conformity is developing into
something uniformity. But
uniformity and mental health are
incompatible as well. Man is not
made to be an automaton, and if
he becomes one, the basis for
mental health is lost."
