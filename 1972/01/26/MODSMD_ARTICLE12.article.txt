# State Of The Movement
## Facile Slogans Produce Few Results 
### 
Larry Diamond

Watching this Monday night's
community meeting of the
Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement was at once both a
hopeful and a profoundly
depressing experience. It was
undeniably hopeful in the sense
that it included a large number of
freshmen and sophomores who
are finally beginning to shed the
calm and contentment and
lethargy that has characterized
their classes so much more than
the ones preceding them.
At last, many of the newer
undergraduates are beginning to
question the way in which the
University is run, the lack of input
from students into the official
decision-making machinery of the
University. And they are
beginning to feel outrage at the
kinds of decisions that are being
made (and not made) here at
Stanford: decisions about the
University's involvement with the
war in Indochina and American
militarism in general, decisions
about who can teach here and
who cannot, decisions about how
the University allots and invests
its resources.
This is hopeful. This is exciting.
But in the context of this
development I note a profoundly
depressing theme as well: the
simple slogans, the impulsive
cliches, the hollow "demands" of
the Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement. Two were articulated
Monday night: "Rehire Bruce,"
and "Stanford Out of the War."
Bruce P'ranklin should be
rehired. The reason he was
dismissed was, ultimately, because
of his political philosophy, rather
than his actions. The student
body recognized this when it
voted by a margin of more than
500 in favor of Franklin's
reinstatement.
Irrevocable
But let us not delude ourselves.
No demand of the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement, no
matter how many sit-ins, painted
walls, and smashed windows it is
backed up by, is going to force
the University to rehire Franklin
as a tenured Professor. That
decision is obviously irrevocable,
and stomping around issuing
angry "demands" only lends an
air of unreality to what could be a
serious movement.
There are two steps that can be
taken immediately to fight
Franklin's dismissal. The first is to
file a suit in court, and the
Faculty Political Action Group
and the Council of Presidents have

joined in a call for funds to wage
that battle on behalf of Franklin.
The American Civil Liberties
Union has expressed an interest in
arguing this case at some point as
it works its way up through the
court system.
Even more immediately, the
students can rehire Franklin. The
Council of Presidents has stated
already that it will press to have
Franklin hired with voluntary
contributions as an ASSU
professor so he may continue to
teach his courses on campus. The
fact is that no university
administration can stop the flow
of ideas when there is a man who
has the courage to teach and
express them and when there is a
group of students who have the
determination to hear and study
them.
Empty Threats
We would do much better~if
academic freedom is really our
concern- to take these steps and
make them clear to the public
rather than to issue a stream of
empty threats.
The movement's second
demand is "Stanford out of the
war." And that second simple
slogan is supposed to encompass
everything else that is wrong with
Stanford University.
The danger in making demands
with such sweeping simplicity is
that, in attempting to say
everything, one can end up saying
nothing. Even worse, in marching
around the campus in fury to
demonstrate that the demand is
serious, the movement loses sight
of the kinds of serious tactics that
can remove, at least in part, the
labyrinth of Stanford's
relationships that now tie it up so
inextricably with the war in
Southeast Asia and with American
militarism in general.
How?
How do we stop military
recruiters and war corporations
from recruiting on Stanford land?
How do we shift the source of
funding for the bulk of scientific
research projects from the
Department of Defense to civilian
agencies? How do we stop more
industrial development of
Stanford lands?
We won't do it by writing
simple slogans on blackboards in
community meetings. Neither will
we do it by sitting in, for
President Lyman has already
made it abundantly clear that no
sit-in of any significance is going
to last past 5 p.m. And we aren't
going to do it by smashing

windows and burning buildings
and then scampering from
platoons of sheriffs in the night.
Anyone who chooses those tactics
endangers the safety of the
members of this community and
belongs in jail.
If we are at all thoughtful
about how we get "Stanford out
of the War" then we will realize
that there are some portions of
that goal that cannot be achieved
without removing the people
presently in positions of
leadership in the federal
government. And most other parts
of that goal are not likely to be
achieved at Stanford without
some basic reordering of the
decision-making structure at the
University.
America Out
The most effective way to get
Stanford out of Southeast Asia is
to get America out of Southeast
Asia, and anyone who believes
that that can ever be done while
Richard Nixon is President is
crazy.
The only way that we will see
any sweeping change in the nature
of scientific research projects and
the source of their funding within
the government is to elect a
President and a Congress that will
put military priorities below the
human and environmental needs
of this country.
As for decisions on who may
recruit here, and how Stanford
land may be used, and what kinds
of research may be done here, I
would expect that we must
continue to lose on most of these
issues until we address ourselves
to the more basic question of who
makes decisions at this University.
On issues of the above nature,
it is not the students. We are shut
off from any formalized role in
the decision-making machinery,
and until we achieved at least
that, we are going to continue to
lose on a whole range of issues
that we raise.
In the long run, we will have a
greater chance of remaking
Stanford policy on every issue
important to us if we will begin
by raising the one issue that
underlays them all: who has the
power?
For example, why should not
the student senate have powers
and responsibilities parallel to

those of the Academic Senate on
issues that concern both
constituencies equally? And why
is not a student referendum ever
binding—even on student services
and facilities? And why is it, for
the most part, that the present
Board of Trustees chooses new
Trustees? Why should not the
students and the faculty be able
to select some of the people that
legally own and run their
University? And why is there no
body or committee devoted to
long-range planning, prepared to
consider thoughtfully, one step
removed from the traditional
pressures of day-to-day
administrative battles, what the
goals and purposes of Stanford
University are?
The depressing conclusion I
took away from Monday night's
meeting was that the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement isn't
going to do much to rehabilitate
Stanford until it assumes the
sophistication to raise these more
basic issues.
And I'm afraid the Movement
just isn't going to move many
people until it cuts the rhetoric
and the slogans and the hollow
threats and starts talking
intelligently and carefully about
which decisions at Stanford are
unacceptable, and about why they
are being made in an unacceptably
closed fashion.

reinstatement.
Irrevocable
But let us not delude ourselves.
No demand of the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement, no
matter how many sit-ins, painted
walls, and smashed windows it is
backed up by, is going to force
the University to rehire Franklin
as a tenured Professor. That
decision is obviously irrevocable,
and stomping around issuing
angry "demands" only lends an
air of unreality to what could be a
serious movement.
There are two steps that can be
taken immediately to fight
Franklin's dismissal. The first is to
file a suit in court, and the
Faculty Political Action Group
and the Council of Presidents have

joined in a call for funds to wage
that battle on behalf of Franklin.
The American Civil Liberties
Union has expressed an interest in
arguing this case at some point as
it works its way up through the
court system.
Even more immediately, the
students can rehire Franklin. The
Council of Presidents has stated
already that it will press to have
Franklin hired with voluntary
contributions as an ASSU
professor so he may continue to
teach his courses on campus. The
fact is that no university
administration can stop the flow
of ideas when there is a man who
has the courage to teach and
express them and when there is a
group of students who have the
determination to hear and study
them.
Empty Threats
We would do much better~if
academic freedom is really our
concern- to take these steps and
make them clear to the public
rather than to issue a stream of
empty threats.
The movement's second
demand is "Stanford out of the
war." And that second simple
slogan is supposed to encompass
everything else that is wrong with
Stanford University.
The danger in making demands
with such sweeping simplicity is
that, in attempting to say
everything, one can end up saying
nothing. Even worse, in marching
around the campus in fury to
demonstrate that the demand is
serious, the movement loses sight
of the kinds of serious tactics that
can remove, at least in part, the
labyrinth of Stanford's
relationships that now tie it up so
inextricably with the war in
Southeast Asia and with American
militarism in general.
How?
How do we stop military
recruiters and war corporations
from recruiting on Stanford land?
How do we shift the source of
funding for the bulk of scientific
research projects from the
Department of Defense to civilian
agencies? How do we stop more
industrial development of
Stanford lands?
We won't do it by writing
simple slogans on blackboards in
community meetings. Neither will
we do it by sitting in, for
President Lyman has already
made it abundantly clear that no
sit-in of any significance is going
to last past 5 p.m. And we aren't
going to do it by smashing

windows and burning buildings
and then scampering from
platoons of sheriffs in the night.
Anyone who chooses those tactics
endangers the safety of the
members of this community and
belongs in jail.
If we are at all thoughtful
about how we get "Stanford out
of the War" then we will realize
that there are some portions of
that goal that cannot be achieved
without removing the people
presently in positions of
leadership in the federal
government. And most other parts
of that goal are not likely to be
achieved at Stanford without
some basic reordering of the
decision-making structure at the
University.
America Out
The most effective way to get
Stanford out of Southeast Asia is
to get America out of Southeast
Asia, and anyone who believes
that that can ever be done while
Richard Nixon is President is
crazy.
The only way that we will see
any sweeping change in the nature
of scientific research projects and
the source of their funding within
the government is to elect a
President and a Congress that will
put military priorities below the
human and environmental needs
of this country.
As for decisions on who may
recruit here, and how Stanford
land may be used, and what kinds
of research may be done here, I
would expect that we must
continue to lose on most of these
issues until we address ourselves
to the more basic question of who
makes decisions at this University.
On issues of the above nature,
it is not the students. We are shut
off from any formalized role in
the decision-making machinery,
and until we achieved at least
that, we are going to continue to
lose on a whole range of issues
that we raise.
In the long run, we will have a
greater chance of remaking
Stanford policy on every issue
important to us if we will begin
by raising the one issue that
underlays them all: who has the
power?
For example, why should not
the student senate have powers
and responsibilities parallel to

those of the Academic Senate on
issues that concern both
constituencies equally? And why
is not a student referendum ever
binding—even on student services
and facilities? And why is it, for
the most part, that the present
Board of Trustees chooses new
Trustees? Why should not the
students and the faculty be able
to select some of the people that
legally own and run their
University? And why is there no
body or committee devoted to
long-range planning, prepared to
consider thoughtfully, one step
removed from the traditional
pressures of day-to-day
administrative battles, what the
goals and purposes of Stanford
University are?
The depressing conclusion I
took away from Monday night's
meeting was that the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement isn't
going to do much to rehabilitate
Stanford until it assumes the
sophistication to raise these more
basic issues.
And I'm afraid the Movement
just isn't going to move many
people until it cuts the rhetoric
and the slogans and the hollow
threats and starts talking
intelligently and carefully about
which decisions at Stanford are
unacceptable, and about why they
are being made in an unacceptably
closed fashion.

Watching this Monday night's
community meeting of the
Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement was at once both a
hopeful and a profoundly
depressing experience. It was
undeniably hopeful in the sense
that it included a large number of
freshmen and sophomores who
are finally beginning to shed the
calm and contentment and
lethargy that has characterized
their classes so much more than
the ones preceding them.
At last, many of the newer
undergraduates are beginning to
question the way in which the
University is run, the lack of input
from students into the official
decision-making machinery of the
University. And they are
beginning to feel outrage at the
kinds of decisions that are being
made (and not made) here at
Stanford: decisions about the
University's involvement with the
war in Indochina and American
militarism in general, decisions
about who can teach here and
who cannot, decisions about how
the University allots and invests
its resources.
This is hopeful. This is exciting.
But in the context of this
development I note a profoundly
depressing theme as well: the
simple slogans, the impulsive
cliches, the hollow "demands" of
the Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement. Two were articulated
Monday night: "Rehire Bruce,"
and "Stanford Out of the War."
Bruce P'ranklin should be
rehired. The reason he was
dismissed was, ultimately, because
of his political philosophy, rather
than his actions. The student
body recognized this when it
voted by a margin of more than
500 in favor of Franklin's
reinstatement.

The movement's second
demand is "Stanford out of the
war." And that second simple
slogan is supposed to encompass
everything else that is wrong with
Stanford University.
The danger in making demands
with such sweeping simplicity is
that, in attempting to say
everything, one can end up saying
nothing. Even worse, in marching
around the campus in fury to
demonstrate that the demand is
serious, the movement loses sight
of the kinds of serious tactics that
can remove, at least in part, the
labyrinth of Stanford's
relationships that now tie it up so
inextricably with the war in
Southeast Asia and with American
militarism in general.
How?
How do we stop military
recruiters and war corporations
from recruiting on Stanford land?
How do we shift the source of
funding for the bulk of scientific
research projects from the
Department of Defense to civilian
agencies? How do we stop more
industrial development of
Stanford lands?
We won't do it by writing
simple slogans on blackboards in
community meetings. Neither will
we do it by sitting in, for
President Lyman has already
made it abundantly clear that no
sit-in of any significance is going
to last past 5 p.m. And we aren't
going to do it by smashing

windows and burning buildings
and then scampering from
platoons of sheriffs in the night.
Anyone who chooses those tactics
endangers the safety of the
members of this community and
belongs in jail.
If we are at all thoughtful
about how we get "Stanford out
of the War" then we will realize
that there are some portions of
that goal that cannot be achieved
without removing the people
presently in positions of
leadership in the federal
government. And most other parts
of that goal are not likely to be
achieved at Stanford without
some basic reordering of the
decision-making structure at the
University.
America Out
The most effective way to get
Stanford out of Southeast Asia is
to get America out of Southeast
Asia, and anyone who believes
that that can ever be done while
Richard Nixon is President is
crazy.
The only way that we will see
any sweeping change in the nature
of scientific research projects and
the source of their funding within
the government is to elect a
President and a Congress that will
put military priorities below the
human and environmental needs
of this country.
As for decisions on who may
recruit here, and how Stanford
land may be used, and what kinds
of research may be done here, I
would expect that we must
continue to lose on most of these
issues until we address ourselves
to the more basic question of who
makes decisions at this University.
On issues of the above nature,
it is not the students. We are shut
off from any formalized role in
the decision-making machinery,
and until we achieved at least
that, we are going to continue to
lose on a whole range of issues
that we raise.
In the long run, we will have a
greater chance of remaking
Stanford policy on every issue
important to us if we will begin
by raising the one issue that
underlays them all: who has the
power?
For example, why should not
the student senate have powers
and responsibilities parallel to

those of the Academic Senate on
issues that concern both
constituencies equally? And why
is not a student referendum ever
binding—even on student services
and facilities? And why is it, for
the most part, that the present
Board of Trustees chooses new
Trustees? Why should not the
students and the faculty be able
to select some of the people that
legally own and run their
University? And why is there no
body or committee devoted to
long-range planning, prepared to
consider thoughtfully, one step
removed from the traditional
pressures of day-to-day
administrative battles, what the
goals and purposes of Stanford
University are?
The depressing conclusion I
took away from Monday night's
meeting was that the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement isn't
going to do much to rehabilitate
Stanford until it assumes the
sophistication to raise these more
basic issues.
And I'm afraid the Movement
just isn't going to move many
people until it cuts the rhetoric
and the slogans and the hollow
threats and starts talking
intelligently and carefully about
which decisions at Stanford are
unacceptable, and about why they
are being made in an unacceptably
closed fashion.

Watching this Monday night's
community meeting of the
Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement was at once both a
hopeful and a profoundly
depressing experience. It was
undeniably hopeful in the sense
that it included a large number of
freshmen and sophomores who
are finally beginning to shed the
calm and contentment and
lethargy that has characterized
their classes so much more than
the ones preceding them.
At last, many of the newer
undergraduates are beginning to
question the way in which the
University is run, the lack of input
from students into the official
decision-making machinery of the
University. And they are
beginning to feel outrage at the
kinds of decisions that are being
made (and not made) here at
Stanford: decisions about the
University's involvement with the
war in Indochina and American
militarism in general, decisions
about who can teach here and
who cannot, decisions about how
the University allots and invests
its resources.
This is hopeful. This is exciting.
But in the context of this
development I note a profoundly
depressing theme as well: the
simple slogans, the impulsive
cliches, the hollow "demands" of
the Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement. Two were articulated
Monday night: "Rehire Bruce,"
and "Stanford Out of the War."
Bruce P'ranklin should be
rehired. The reason he was
dismissed was, ultimately, because
of his political philosophy, rather
than his actions. The student
body recognized this when it
voted by a margin of more than
500 in favor of Franklin's
reinstatement.
Irrevocable
But let us not delude ourselves.
No demand of the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement, no
matter how many sit-ins, painted
walls, and smashed windows it is
backed up by, is going to force
the University to rehire Franklin
as a tenured Professor. That
decision is obviously irrevocable,
and stomping around issuing
angry "demands" only lends an
air of unreality to what could be a
serious movement.
There are two steps that can be
taken immediately to fight
Franklin's dismissal. The first is to
file a suit in court, and the
Faculty Political Action Group
and the Council of Presidents have

joined in a call for funds to wage
that battle on behalf of Franklin.
The American Civil Liberties
Union has expressed an interest in
arguing this case at some point as
it works its way up through the
court system.
Even more immediately, the
students can rehire Franklin. The
Council of Presidents has stated
already that it will press to have
Franklin hired with voluntary
contributions as an ASSU
professor so he may continue to
teach his courses on campus. The
fact is that no university
administration can stop the flow
of ideas when there is a man who
has the courage to teach and
express them and when there is a
group of students who have the
determination to hear and study
them.
Empty Threats
We would do much better~if
academic freedom is really our
concern- to take these steps and
make them clear to the public
rather than to issue a stream of
empty threats.

that there are some portions of
that goal that cannot be achieved
without removing the people
presently in positions of
leadership in the federal
government. And most other parts
of that goal are not likely to be
achieved at Stanford without
some basic reordering of the
decision-making structure at the
University.
America Out
The most effective way to get
Stanford out of Southeast Asia is
to get America out of Southeast
Asia, and anyone who believes
that that can ever be done while
Richard Nixon is President is
crazy.
The only way that we will see
any sweeping change in the nature
of scientific research projects and
the source of their funding within
the government is to elect a
President and a Congress that will
put military priorities below the
human and environmental needs
of this country.
As for decisions on who may
recruit here, and how Stanford
land may be used, and what kinds
of research may be done here, I
would expect that we must
continue to lose on most of these
issues until we address ourselves
to the more basic question of who
makes decisions at this University.
On issues of the above nature,
it is not the students. We are shut
off from any formalized role in
the decision-making machinery,
and until we achieved at least
that, we are going to continue to
lose on a whole range of issues
that we raise.
In the long run, we will have a
greater chance of remaking
Stanford policy on every issue
important to us if we will begin
by raising the one issue that
underlays them all: who has the
power?
For example, why should not
the student senate have powers
and responsibilities parallel to

those of the Academic Senate on
issues that concern both
constituencies equally? And why
is not a student referendum ever
binding—even on student services
and facilities? And why is it, for
the most part, that the present
Board of Trustees chooses new
Trustees? Why should not the
students and the faculty be able
to select some of the people that
legally own and run their
University? And why is there no
body or committee devoted to
long-range planning, prepared to
consider thoughtfully, one step
removed from the traditional
pressures of day-to-day
administrative battles, what the
goals and purposes of Stanford
University are?
The depressing conclusion I
took away from Monday night's
meeting was that the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement isn't
going to do much to rehabilitate
Stanford until it assumes the
sophistication to raise these more
basic issues.
And I'm afraid the Movement
just isn't going to move many
people until it cuts the rhetoric
and the slogans and the hollow
threats and starts talking
intelligently and carefully about
which decisions at Stanford are
unacceptable, and about why they
are being made in an unacceptably
closed fashion.

Watching this Monday night's
community meeting of the
Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement was at once both a
hopeful and a profoundly
depressing experience. It was
undeniably hopeful in the sense
that it included a large number of
freshmen and sophomores who
are finally beginning to shed the
calm and contentment and
lethargy that has characterized
their classes so much more than
the ones preceding them.
At last, many of the newer
undergraduates are beginning to
question the way in which the
University is run, the lack of input
from students into the official
decision-making machinery of the
University. And they are
beginning to feel outrage at the
kinds of decisions that are being
made (and not made) here at
Stanford: decisions about the
University's involvement with the
war in Indochina and American
militarism in general, decisions
about who can teach here and
who cannot, decisions about how
the University allots and invests
its resources.
This is hopeful. This is exciting.
But in the context of this
development I note a profoundly
depressing theme as well: the
simple slogans, the impulsive
cliches, the hollow "demands" of
the Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement. Two were articulated
Monday night: "Rehire Bruce,"
and "Stanford Out of the War."
Bruce P'ranklin should be
rehired. The reason he was
dismissed was, ultimately, because
of his political philosophy, rather
than his actions. The student
body recognized this when it
voted by a margin of more than
500 in favor of Franklin's
reinstatement.
Irrevocable
But let us not delude ourselves.
No demand of the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement, no
matter how many sit-ins, painted
walls, and smashed windows it is
backed up by, is going to force
the University to rehire Franklin
as a tenured Professor. That
decision is obviously irrevocable,
and stomping around issuing
angry "demands" only lends an
air of unreality to what could be a
serious movement.
There are two steps that can be
taken immediately to fight
Franklin's dismissal. The first is to
file a suit in court, and the
Faculty Political Action Group
and the Council of Presidents have

joined in a call for funds to wage
that battle on behalf of Franklin.
The American Civil Liberties
Union has expressed an interest in
arguing this case at some point as
it works its way up through the
court system.
Even more immediately, the
students can rehire Franklin. The
Council of Presidents has stated
already that it will press to have
Franklin hired with voluntary
contributions as an ASSU
professor so he may continue to
teach his courses on campus. The
fact is that no university
administration can stop the flow
of ideas when there is a man who
has the courage to teach and
express them and when there is a
group of students who have the
determination to hear and study
them.
Empty Threats
We would do much better~if
academic freedom is really our
concern- to take these steps and
make them clear to the public
rather than to issue a stream of
empty threats.
The movement's second
demand is "Stanford out of the
war." And that second simple
slogan is supposed to encompass
everything else that is wrong with
Stanford University.
The danger in making demands
with such sweeping simplicity is
that, in attempting to say
everything, one can end up saying
nothing. Even worse, in marching
around the campus in fury to
demonstrate that the demand is
serious, the movement loses sight
of the kinds of serious tactics that
can remove, at least in part, the
labyrinth of Stanford's
relationships that now tie it up so
inextricably with the war in
Southeast Asia and with American
militarism in general.
How?
How do we stop military
recruiters and war corporations
from recruiting on Stanford land?
How do we shift the source of
funding for the bulk of scientific
research projects from the
Department of Defense to civilian
agencies? How do we stop more
industrial development of
Stanford lands?
We won't do it by writing
simple slogans on blackboards in
community meetings. Neither will
we do it by sitting in, for
President Lyman has already
made it abundantly clear that no
sit-in of any significance is going
to last past 5 p.m. And we aren't
going to do it by smashing

windows and burning buildings
and then scampering from
platoons of sheriffs in the night.
Anyone who chooses those tactics
endangers the safety of the
members of this community and
belongs in jail.
If we are at all thoughtful
about how we get "Stanford out
of the War" then we will realize
that there are some portions of
that goal that cannot be achieved
without removing the people
presently in positions of
leadership in the federal
government. And most other parts
of that goal are not likely to be
achieved at Stanford without
some basic reordering of the
decision-making structure at the
University.
