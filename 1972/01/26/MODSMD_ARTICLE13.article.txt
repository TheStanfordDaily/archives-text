# Help Fight The Deadliest War
## 
### JERRY COLEMAN 
It is most disconcerting to find
out that one cannot escape the
passionate issues and burning
rhetoric of the day—even in
seemingly innocent gas stations.
Service stations countrywide
display devious yellow metal
boxes, advertising a leading brand
of windshield wiper blades.
No, not advertising, but
proclaiming with an urgency
unheard of since the hearings of
the Senate Un-American Activities
Committee in the McCarthy days.
At last an issue has emerged
that can be embraced by all
Americans, on any side of the
political spectrum, and of every
temperament: clean windshield
wiper blades!
Stand up and be counted
among the growing millions who
cherish this cause. For your first
indoctrination, come now to Any
station, America, where we stand
before the exalted yellow box,
and read:

"The Deadliest War!
Look how neglectful
Americans —not foreign
enemies—keep you 'under fire'--in
the deadliest war in all history!
Insurance Information
Institute tells you:
In a single year—49,ooo persons
died in U.S. traffic accidents—in
which also 3,345,000 suffered
personal insuries—more than twice
as many casualties as in our armed
services during all the years of
World War I and World War 11.
Highway Visibility Bureau tells
you:
In a check of vision obstructions
on vehicles involved in traffic
accidents NATIONAL SAFETY
COUNCIL has reported that 45%
of all such accidents involve
visibility obscurements—which
obscurements account for 37% of
deaths in such accidents.
Dead wiper blades—that can't
ever stop streaking your
windshield—stand here accused by
highway authorities of making

deadly war about all who ride
upon the highways.

That's why friendly Service
Attendants of this official Traffic
Security Station are pledged to
ask each customer: 'Do Your
Wipers Streak Your Windshield?'

(see opposite side)"
Before getting to the other side
of the box, it might be relevant to
ask, "How often has your friendly
service attendant asked you about
your wipers?" In all my years of
driving, not once have I heard the
question asked.
As I was down on El Camino at
a service station, copying the
above words of wisdom, an
attendant walked up.
"Can 1 help you, son?"
—Do you know that this is an
official Traffic Security Station?
"It is!"
—Yes, and do you know your
pledge?
"What pledge?"
—To ask each customer if their
wipers streak.
"You know, you tell people
about their dirty wipers and they
think you're trying to sell them
merchandise they don't need."
—You ever heard of the
deadliest war in history;
"Yeah, sure—fought in it. You
mean that box? Never read it. But
you know—people come in here
with their windows all scummy

and tell me to wipe 'em up. I
show them the trouble's with
their wipers but they don't care.
Just the other day, man was in
here—"
—Thanks.
"Yeah."
Stepping round the other side
of the box, we continue:

your left. You'll be amazed at the
high percentage of windshields
with dead blades that do not give
drivers clean, clear vision."
As an aside—if you're driving,
don't spend too much time
studying approaching windshields
or you may become a casuality in
the deadliest war yourself!
