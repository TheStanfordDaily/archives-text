Liberal-Fascist-Pig
Editor, THE DAILY:
All factions on campus agree, it
seems, that freedom of thought
and expression in the Stanford
classroom and laboratory is not
safe. The liberal-fascist-pig
professors, including me, worry a
bit about the homework
assignment in a course sponsored
by the Department of English:
"Go into the classes of those
professors and not let them get
away with that shit."
A comparably literate
expression by radical students in
Economics fits the same pattern:
"The issue ('violation of free
speech'), in any particular
instances, is complex and our
judgment is tactical, not
absolute."
The LFP professors pick up a
little solace from another dictum
of the radical students: ".. .we
must take great pains to
discriminate between the cases in
which interference is justified and

cases in which it is not." Maybe
some classes and laboratories will
be let alone, for a while. Maybe
Venceremos will be selective.
The Executive Committee of
AAUP thinks that somebody else
may think that the classroom and
laboratory are in peril from the
Advisory Board and the President.
Let there be a national poll, the
Committee suggests.
No poll is necessary. The Board
and President have taken, with
thoughtfulness and due process, a
step that protects the tenure of
classroom and laboratory
freedoms. All of us have a better
chance now of keeping the
insignia of the submachine gun or
swastika, clenched fist or
corporate trademark away from
our blackboards.
By the way, have you read in
the New York Times of January 112
18 the reprimand by the Soviet
Communist Party of the Institute i
of Economics? The Institute, it is ,
changed, has been lax in adhering
to the party line.

The party line calls for
"long-range planning and
prediction" by economics and for
"use of modem mathematical
techniques of economic research."
The party line of young socialists
here rejects this kind of
economics, insisting that it has
nothing to do with the welfare of
the people.
The rest of us can say only,
"Right on, Socialists and may
your argument be free." Park the
sledgehammers outside.
E.S. Shaw,
Prof, of Economics
