# National Issue
## P.A. Control Unconstitutional 
### Philip Lexey 
I am opposed to Mrs. Pearson's proposal on a
Palo Alto level. I am not opposed to a national level
evaluation of the military-industrial-labor complex.
On the local level, the zoning out of certain types
of industry for political purposes and the selection
of industrial end products, providing all other
ordinances are observed, is unconstitutional.
Like the issue of municipal gun control, a field
pre-empted by state and federal legislation, I believe
this issue is a political smokescreen put torth by the
"residentialist faction" of Palo Alto because they
are grasping for cause celebres to cover the fact that
they arc either unwilling or unable to use their "new
majority" power for valid and constructive
municipal purposes. It is much easier lor members
of the Palo Alto City Council to discuss issues over
which one has no control and to appeal to emotions
on state and national issues to get local headlines,
than to fulfill campaign promises and creatively
solve existing and difficult Palo Alto problems on a
Palo Alto level.
These are arduous times of frustration, tension,
fear, and economic insecurity. A frightful and now
senseless Vietnam war has led many of us to
over-reaction and the easy solution. The
military-industrial-labor complex is necessary to the
survival of this nation; but it must be carefully
regulated, and programs must be actual, not
wasteful or simply short-term and expensive job
producers for political purposes. The
military-industrial-labor complex must have a place
in our economic structure, but in no way should it
dominate that structure. Stable, productive, and
progressive economies are based on usable

commercial products rather than an over-abundance
of weaponry. We have a world in need and an
opportunity to fill that need through the marketing
of useful products. But we cannot forget that this is
a national issue — an issue Palo Alto cannot solve.
As a city there are many challenging and exciting
things Palo Alto can do. Let's consider
transportation systems, low-to-moderate income
housing, urban and land use planning, child care
centers, recreational and educational programs for
all age levels, a drug center, programs for the
unemployed, creating a viable University Avenue
area, creating an environment where we can afford
to pay for the many programs and services that Palo
Altans want and demand, community-police
relations, and yes, even something as simple as
sidewalk and roadway improvement. These and
many other things we as Palo Altans can do, and it
is time we start working in these directions rather
than getting sidetracked on time consuming issues
over which we have no direct control.
If state and national issues so entice Mayor
Comstock, Mrs. Pearson, and the rest of the "new
majority" Council; they should run for higher
political offices and test their opinions where they
can actually do something about them, rather than
waste the Palo Alto City Council's time and money
on issues over which they have no control or
responsibility. It is time for Palo Alto to embark on
the future and get to the task at hand — A better
Palo Alto for all Palo Altans.

candidate in last May's City Council election.)
