# Caught Unprepared
## Controls May Cripple U.S. Defense System 
### Marshall Virello 
Undoubtedly it would be more sensible to publish pro
and con articles on the regulation of the location and
activities of industry in Palo Alto after the City
Attorney has issued his report on the legality of various
kinds of controls rather than before. By doing so now
viewpoints necessarily are limited to those which reflect
our own opinions, philosophies or experiences rather
than facts. I am not qualified as a philosopher, political
scientist or historian. I was asked by the Daily to prepare
an article for this edition so 1 shall only be able to state
how I came to hold the views 1 do.
My college years came in the mid-30's in the depth of
the depression when even more unsettling conditions
prevailed in the world than now. Clouds of a potential
world conflict were forming in Europe and students in
the United States were speaking out against involvement
of our country in a possible Second World War. Many
students signed petitions stating they would not serve in
the Armed Forces if we were to become involved. I
signed.
By the summer of 1939 Hitler had begun his drive to
control Europe by easily taking over Czechoslovakia.
Shortly thereafter the Axis was formed. The world was
understandably alarmed. I continued to be opposed to
entanglement of the U.S. In September 1940 the first
American peacetime draft became law. A few months
later I made a talk opposing the draft. We were not yet
directly involved in the conflict and I felt we should not
be. I noted that at the time we didn't even have enough
drill rifles to equip those men already being drafted.
On Sunday morning, December 7, 1941 I was the
only employer in The Palo Alto Times office when all
the phones began to ring. Callers wanted to verify radio
reports that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. I
was stunned along with everyone else at the news. In
every sense the United States was unprepared for that
event and for others which followed in the ensuing
years. Germany and Japan held great superiority, not

only in volume of equipment but in technology as well,
in addition to bomb earning planes, pilotless
buzz-bombs and V-2 rockets battered London. Nazi and
Japanese submarines greatly outnumbered those of the
Allies.
The tide of the war eventually was reversed and the
war's duration shortened by the Allies' more
sophisticated development of technological devices such
as sonar and radar to detect submarines and planes, and
of the Norden bombsight which permitted accurate
bombing of critical targets like Peenemunde where the
V-2 rockets were being manufactured. It was a
desperate and costly struggle, however, to catch up.
War is indeed insane. I fervently hope that the present
disarmament talks ultimately result in the mutual
cessation of the costly buildup of arms in this country
and in others. Ihtil that glorious day arrives, however, I
must oppose unilaterial disarmament and the imposition
of other controls which would prevent our ability to
develop those technological devices that are required for
an adequate defense system.
You can't let your guard down until the round ends,
unfortunately. This does not mean that I believe the
Pentagon should have unlimited funds or that Congress
should fail to keep an eagle eye on the Department of
Defense. 1 believe it must. I am opposed to the use of
armaments by this country or any other for aggressive
purposes. Like most other citizens, 1 regard the
involvement in Vietnam as a horrible blunder which
should serve as a never-to-be-forgotten lesson for the
future.
The desire of Venceremos to ban any expansion of
industries in Palo Alto which do any business with the
Department of Defense is just one more attempt to give
an edge to the Communists to whom they seem to owe
their real allegiance. In this remarkably free country it is
their right to espouse such a cause. It is the duty of
those who do not wish to see the U.S. again caught
unprepared to analyze carefully any proposal which is

intended to cripple, or has the effect of crippling, our
technological abilities for defense and to oppose such
proposals.
Another aspect of the question is selectively
restricting a business for philosophical reasons. Mr. Peter
Stone, Palo Alto City Attorney, will give his opinion on
the more broadly stated question in about 4 or 5
months. He has said that he could not predict what his
legal research will turn up except that he did know now
that "philosophical regulation by a city or any other
form of government is absolutely out".. .. "As soon as
a government starts to look at a philosophy of a business
or a profit motivation of a business, the door is open to
the next step, which could conceivably be the banning
of a bookstore because of the philosophical nature of
the books, and that leads to either the Germany of 1932
or the world of 1984."
Certainly not many people on this university campus
or in the City of Palo Alto would wish to open the door
to such controls.
There have been many vituperative statement made
by radicals concerning electronic firms located in the
Stanford Industrial Park. Not knowing myself the
accuracy of their remarks I sought information on the
largest and most frequently condemned firm,
Hewlett-Packard. They design no product exclusively for
defense or armament purposes. Of their total orders for
the fiscal year ending October 31, 1971 amounting to
$397 million, only 13 per cent, ($5O million) were sold
to government agencies direct. This included
non-defense related agencies such as the Federal
Aviation Administration, NASA, National Institutes of
Health and the National Bureau of Standards. All
products sold to governmental agencies are those which
are Hewlett-Packard's standard products, also being
purchased by other business firmsâ€”essentially devices of
measurement.
