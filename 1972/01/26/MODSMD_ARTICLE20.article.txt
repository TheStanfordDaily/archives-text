# Proposal To Study Regulation
## 
### Councilwoman Enid Pearson 
Two weeks ago Venceremos presented the
Palo Alto City Council with a controversial
proposal that the City Attorney study the
legal possibilities of regulating the
development of war-related industry in the
area. Ixist Monday, the Council passed the
proposal, broadened to include regulation of
all Palo Alto industry.
City Attorney Peter Stone estimates that
the study will be completed within four to six
months.
What follows is the text of a letter from
Councilwoman Enid Pearson, who sponsored
the proposal, to her colleagues.
The question asked last Monday night is
whether or not the City is able, through the
use of ordinances and zoning laws, to prohibit
a war industry from locating within our
municipal boundaries. Such questions of
regulating businesses have come up before. It
would be good to have some answers even if
for no other reason than to define City
powers on this point.
We presently exercise various kinds of
controls that effect the environment of our
City. For example, we separate industrial
from residential; we control the number of

liquor licenses permitted in the downtown
business district; we erect traffic barriers to
protect residences from commuter traffic; we
prohibit operations involving fish, fats and
oils, bones and meat products, and (meat
packing plants) we prohibit storage of
inflammable or explosive matter or materials;
we prohibit gravel, rock and cement material
yards; we prohibit parking on streets during
certain hours; we prohibit certain kinds of
signs on businesses. Hence, we are presently
exercising controls over the kinds of business
permitted to operate in Palo Alto.
Meat packing plants and gravel pits have
visible, tangible, negative impact on
environment. Not one of us would hesitate to
support legislation to prevent other similar
industry from locating in Palo Alto.
The intangible effects of certain industries
upon our community are far more difficult to
assess. It has been said that a city must play
no small part in its contribution to the total
commitment of society to achieve a higher
order of human existence. From the profound
fact of ecological survival to the daily needs of
economical existence, the structure of city
government must become more finely tuned

and sensitive to the interplay of forces which
threaten social equilibrium.
The use of public funds in attempting to
reach civilized goals is a great responsibility.
We must exercise this responsibility. 1 think
this legal opinion will give us some guidelines.
Last spring 60 percent of the voters
declared that they wanted the war to cease by
December, 1971. What responsibility do we,
as Councilwomen and Councilmen have to our
constituents to continue to represent their
views effectively on this subject? Frankly, 1
don't know, but 1 hope that we can get a legal
opinion on the limitations of our powers. This
legal opinion will provide us with some factual
answers as to what contribution the citizens
of Palo Alto, through their elected
representatives, can make toward terminating
this war. 1 feel that in asking for this legal
opinion 1 am not responding to a small vocal
minority but rather to the majority of Palo
Alto. Therefore, 1 move
"That the City Council direct the City
Attorney to produce an opinion on the City's
ability to regulate the activities and location
of industry both with respect to the tangible
and intangible effects on the community of
Palo Alto."
