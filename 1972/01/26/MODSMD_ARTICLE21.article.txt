# People's Offense
## Regulate Palo Alto's War Industry 
### Jeffrey Youdelman 
In 1969, an anti-war group in Minneapolis formed the Honeywell
Project, a community movement attacking the Honeywell
Corporation for producing war material.
When the director of the Project was asked to explain its motive, he
repeated what a North Vietnamese had asked of a local priest:
"This is an anti-personnel fragmentation bomb dropped on men,
women and children in North Vietnam. It was made by Honeywell in
Minneapolis. Ask the people of your city what they have done to us.
We have done nothing to them."
If that North Vietnamesee had posed the question to someone from
the Palo Alto area, he would have had to include more than
fragmentation bombs.
The Midpeninsula, dominated by the Stanford trustees, is the
second largest weapons research center in the country: 20% of all DoD
research contracts come here. In Palo Alto 56 firms receive $140
million from the Department of Offense. This, together with the
research and manpower (managers for the Empire) turned out by
Stanford, makes this area a key part of the imperialist war effort.
That's why, two weeks ago, Palo Alto Venceremos demanded that
the City Council look into banning new or expanding war work in the
city.
Last week, to the fright of the Palo Alto Times and the corporate
rulers for whom they are the mouthpiece, the Council began the
process of looking into "regulating" business, specifically including
war industry.
The Peoples' Offense in Palo Alto happened for two reasons: the
strength of the revolutionary movement in this area and the intense
contradiction existing between the people who live here and the
people who rule them.
Both reasons owe much to the anti-war movement at Stanford and
other universities these last four years.
Beginning with the Columbia strike in 1968, students began to
concretely look at the elite universities and concretely examine their
function in bourgeois society.
The movement at Stanford found the same things as at Columbia:
the University's key role in formulating and implementing Imperialist
policy and the University's oppression of surrounding communities
through its control of land, real estate and development.
The facts learned by the Stanford movement helped the struggles of
people in the surrounding community. In Palo Alto the movement
against development and the Master Plan to transform the city into
the financial center of the Midpeninsula, serving large corporations
and driving out poor and working people, has become an
anti-imperialist movement. And from Stanford, we've learned that the
tactic of direct action is the only way to change reality.
So we don't consider the City council's investigation into regulating
all kinds of business and development to be a watering down of our
proposal. At the Council meeting, a comrade of ours who works in the
Palo Alto Tenants Union naturally said: "When you talk about war
industry, you have to talk about the businesses that serve war
industry, such as the banks and Superblocks and Holiday Inn" and all
other Master Plan projects.
If we are to speak about "regulating" business, we must understand
it's already regulated. It's regulated by the state, by the bourgeoisie.

Last week, the Palo Alto Times attacked Venceremos for trampling
on the heritage of free enterprise. But free enterprise doesn't exist.
Over 70 years ago, free enterprise capitalism was transformed into
monopoly capitalism, a social system run by banks and trusts.
By the 19305, this system was falling apart. In Germany and Italy,
the solution became fascism- massive government spending on war
materials to revive the economy and cut the unemployment crisis
which was turning people toward socialism.
In this country, the response was the New Deal. It was a New Deal,
but the capitalist deck was the same.
In order to save corporate capitalism, the government intervened in
the economy by pouring money into social work projects: TVA,
roads, schools, art in the post office. This spending did little to benefit
the lives of the people and nothing to redistribute wealth, but it did, if
somewhat against the peoples' will, save the large corporations and
their rip-off economic system.
After the world-wide War Against Fascism, the politics of the ruling
class dictated a so-called cold war economyâ€”the permanent war
economy.
New industry, like the electronics industry that has grown up around
Stanford, was developed and traditional industries were converted to
protect U.S. markets by waging war 011 the peoples of the Third World
in Asia, Africa and South America.
Given this picture, some people talk about "reconverting" the
murderous business around us, of using it to serve the people by
producing socially useful things.
These corporations aren't likely to "reconvert" on their own. Asa
matter of fact, they can't. The government is the main contractor and
buyer of their goods, and they can't suddenly sell everything useful to
the public. So unless, the government becomes the buyer and
contractor for these socially useful goods, "reconversion" isn't very
possible.
But there are demands along this line which can be pushed, and
must be pushed, because they come from the workers in these
industries.
The only way to have regulation by the people is to have
Proletarian Revolution. When the people who work in industry own
and control it, they'll bo no need for municipal or similar controls.
So, essentially, it's a class question. A question of taking business
and industry' away from the rulers who own them and turning them
over to the people. Similarly, Stanford must be controlled by the poor
and working people excluded from it, not by its corporate Board of
Trustees.
Industry' now used to oppress the people can form the basis for
socialism. Socialist countries like China and Korea use industry to
build up the society and make life better.
In North Vietnam, the terrorist bombings have forced factories into
underground caves. But in those caves are produced the things needed
by the people. And the work in those caves is the product of the love
of the people and the solidarity which come from righteous
proletarian struggle.
But the corporations which run Amerika (sic) are on the other side
of that war.
If you're part of the anti-war movement and leani that a company
in Palo Alto produces equipment used in the bombers, or learn that a
Stanford professor invented it in the first place, you have to move
against that.
You have to turn these businesses and institutions around. You
have to smash them to the ground.

contradiction existing between the people who live here and the
people who rule them.
Both reasons owe much to the anti-war movement at Stanford and
other universities these last four years.
Beginning with the Columbia strike in 1968, students began to
concretely look at the elite universities and concretely examine their
function in bourgeois society.
The movement at Stanford found the same things as at Columbia:
the University's key role in formulating and implementing Imperialist
policy and the University's oppression of surrounding communities
through its control of land, real estate and development.
The facts learned by the Stanford movement helped the struggles of
people in the surrounding community. In Palo Alto the movement
against development and the Master Plan to transform the city into
the financial center of the Midpeninsula, serving large corporations
and driving out poor and working people, has become an
anti-imperialist movement. And from Stanford, we've learned that the
tactic of direct action is the only way to change reality.
So we don't consider the City council's investigation into regulating
all kinds of business and development to be a watering down of our
proposal. At the Council meeting, a comrade of ours who works in the
Palo Alto Tenants Union naturally said: "When you talk about war
industry, you have to talk about the businesses that serve war
industry, such as the banks and Superblocks and Holiday Inn" and all
other Master Plan projects.
If we are to speak about "regulating" business, we must understand
it's already regulated. It's regulated by the state, by the bourgeoisie.

Last week, the Palo Alto Times attacked Venceremos for trampling
on the heritage of free enterprise. But free enterprise doesn't exist.
Over 70 years ago, free enterprise capitalism was transformed into
monopoly capitalism, a social system run by banks and trusts.
By the 19305, this system was falling apart. In Germany and Italy,
the solution became fascism- massive government spending on war
materials to revive the economy and cut the unemployment crisis
which was turning people toward socialism.
In this country, the response was the New Deal. It was a New Deal,
but the capitalist deck was the same.
In order to save corporate capitalism, the government intervened in
the economy by pouring money into social work projects: TVA,
roads, schools, art in the post office. This spending did little to benefit
the lives of the people and nothing to redistribute wealth, but it did, if
somewhat against the peoples' will, save the large corporations and
their rip-off economic system.
After the world-wide War Against Fascism, the politics of the ruling
class dictated a so-called cold war economyâ€”the permanent war
economy.
New industry, like the electronics industry that has grown up around
Stanford, was developed and traditional industries were converted to
protect U.S. markets by waging war 011 the peoples of the Third World
in Asia, Africa and South America.
Given this picture, some people talk about "reconverting" the
murderous business around us, of using it to serve the people by
producing socially useful things.
These corporations aren't likely to "reconvert" on their own. Asa
matter of fact, they can't. The government is the main contractor and
buyer of their goods, and they can't suddenly sell everything useful to
the public. So unless, the government becomes the buyer and
contractor for these socially useful goods, "reconversion" isn't very
possible.
But there are demands along this line which can be pushed, and
must be pushed, because they come from the workers in these
industries.
The only way to have regulation by the people is to have
Proletarian Revolution. When the people who work in industry own
and control it, they'll bo no need for municipal or similar controls.
So, essentially, it's a class question. A question of taking business
and industry' away from the rulers who own them and turning them
over to the people. Similarly, Stanford must be controlled by the poor
and working people excluded from it, not by its corporate Board of
Trustees.
Industry' now used to oppress the people can form the basis for
socialism. Socialist countries like China and Korea use industry to
build up the society and make life better.
In North Vietnam, the terrorist bombings have forced factories into
underground caves. But in those caves are produced the things needed
by the people. And the work in those caves is the product of the love
of the people and the solidarity which come from righteous
proletarian struggle.
But the corporations which run Amerika (sic) are on the other side
of that war.
If you're part of the anti-war movement and leani that a company
in Palo Alto produces equipment used in the bombers, or learn that a
Stanford professor invented it in the first place, you have to move
against that.
You have to turn these businesses and institutions around. You
have to smash them to the ground.
(Jeffrv Youdelman is a member of Palo Alto Venceremos.)
In 1969, an anti-war group in Minneapolis formed the Honeywell
Project, a community movement attacking the Honeywell
Corporation for producing war material.
When the director of the Project was asked to explain its motive, he
repeated what a North Vietnamese had asked of a local priest:
"This is an anti-personnel fragmentation bomb dropped on men,
women and children in North Vietnam. It was made by Honeywell in
Minneapolis. Ask the people of your city what they have done to us.
We have done nothing to them."
If that North Vietnamesee had posed the question to someone from
the Palo Alto area, he would have had to include more than
fragmentation bombs.
The Midpeninsula, dominated by the Stanford trustees, is the
second largest weapons research center in the country: 20% of all DoD
research contracts come here. In Palo Alto 56 firms receive $140
million from the Department of Offense. This, together with the
research and manpower (managers for the Empire) turned out by
Stanford, makes this area a key part of the imperialist war effort.
That's why, two weeks ago, Palo Alto Venceremos demanded that
the City Council look into banning new or expanding war work in the
city.
Last week, to the fright of the Palo Alto Times and the corporate
rulers for whom they are the mouthpiece, the Council began the
process of looking into "regulating" business, specifically including
war industry.

Last week, the Palo Alto Times attacked Venceremos for trampling
on the heritage of free enterprise. But free enterprise doesn't exist.
Over 70 years ago, free enterprise capitalism was transformed into
monopoly capitalism, a social system run by banks and trusts.
By the 19305, this system was falling apart. In Germany and Italy,
the solution became fascism- massive government spending on war
materials to revive the economy and cut the unemployment crisis
which was turning people toward socialism.
In this country, the response was the New Deal. It was a New Deal,
but the capitalist deck was the same.
In order to save corporate capitalism, the government intervened in
the economy by pouring money into social work projects: TVA,
roads, schools, art in the post office. This spending did little to benefit
the lives of the people and nothing to redistribute wealth, but it did, if
somewhat against the peoples' will, save the large corporations and
their rip-off economic system.
After the world-wide War Against Fascism, the politics of the ruling
class dictated a so-called cold war economyâ€”the permanent war
economy.
New industry, like the electronics industry that has grown up around
Stanford, was developed and traditional industries were converted to
protect U.S. markets by waging war 011 the peoples of the Third World
in Asia, Africa and South America.
Given this picture, some people talk about "reconverting" the
murderous business around us, of using it to serve the people by
producing socially useful things.
These corporations aren't likely to "reconvert" on their own. Asa
matter of fact, they can't. The government is the main contractor and
buyer of their goods, and they can't suddenly sell everything useful to
the public. So unless, the government becomes the buyer and
contractor for these socially useful goods, "reconversion" isn't very
possible.
But there are demands along this line which can be pushed, and
must be pushed, because they come from the workers in these
industries.
The only way to have regulation by the people is to have
Proletarian Revolution. When the people who work in industry own
and control it, they'll bo no need for municipal or similar controls.
So, essentially, it's a class question. A question of taking business
and industry' away from the rulers who own them and turning them
over to the people. Similarly, Stanford must be controlled by the poor
and working people excluded from it, not by its corporate Board of
Trustees.
Industry' now used to oppress the people can form the basis for
socialism. Socialist countries like China and Korea use industry to
build up the society and make life better.
In North Vietnam, the terrorist bombings have forced factories into
underground caves. But in those caves are produced the things needed
by the people. And the work in those caves is the product of the love
of the people and the solidarity which come from righteous
proletarian struggle.
But the corporations which run Amerika (sic) are on the other side
of that war.
If you're part of the anti-war movement and leani that a company
in Palo Alto produces equipment used in the bombers, or learn that a
Stanford professor invented it in the first place, you have to move
against that.
You have to turn these businesses and institutions around. You
have to smash them to the ground.
(Jeffrv Youdelman is a member of Palo Alto Venceremos.)
In 1969, an anti-war group in Minneapolis formed the Honeywell
Project, a community movement attacking the Honeywell
Corporation for producing war material.
When the director of the Project was asked to explain its motive, he
repeated what a North Vietnamese had asked of a local priest:
"This is an anti-personnel fragmentation bomb dropped on men,
women and children in North Vietnam. It was made by Honeywell in
Minneapolis. Ask the people of your city what they have done to us.
We have done nothing to them."
If that North Vietnamesee had posed the question to someone from
the Palo Alto area, he would have had to include more than
fragmentation bombs.
The Midpeninsula, dominated by the Stanford trustees, is the
second largest weapons research center in the country: 20% of all DoD
research contracts come here. In Palo Alto 56 firms receive $140
million from the Department of Offense. This, together with the
research and manpower (managers for the Empire) turned out by
Stanford, makes this area a key part of the imperialist war effort.
That's why, two weeks ago, Palo Alto Venceremos demanded that
the City Council look into banning new or expanding war work in the
city.
Last week, to the fright of the Palo Alto Times and the corporate
rulers for whom they are the mouthpiece, the Council began the
process of looking into "regulating" business, specifically including
war industry.
The Peoples' Offense in Palo Alto happened for two reasons: the
strength of the revolutionary movement in this area and the intense
contradiction existing between the people who live here and the
people who rule them.
Both reasons owe much to the anti-war movement at Stanford and
other universities these last four years.
Beginning with the Columbia strike in 1968, students began to
concretely look at the elite universities and concretely examine their
function in bourgeois society.
The movement at Stanford found the same things as at Columbia:
the University's key role in formulating and implementing Imperialist
policy and the University's oppression of surrounding communities
through its control of land, real estate and development.
The facts learned by the Stanford movement helped the struggles of
people in the surrounding community. In Palo Alto the movement
against development and the Master Plan to transform the city into
the financial center of the Midpeninsula, serving large corporations
and driving out poor and working people, has become an
anti-imperialist movement. And from Stanford, we've learned that the
tactic of direct action is the only way to change reality.
So we don't consider the City council's investigation into regulating
all kinds of business and development to be a watering down of our
proposal. At the Council meeting, a comrade of ours who works in the
Palo Alto Tenants Union naturally said: "When you talk about war
industry, you have to talk about the businesses that serve war
industry, such as the banks and Superblocks and Holiday Inn" and all
other Master Plan projects.
If we are to speak about "regulating" business, we must understand
it's already regulated. It's regulated by the state, by the bourgeoisie.
