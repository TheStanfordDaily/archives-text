# 'Clockwork Orange'-A Film Of Minor Importance
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
One of the prime merits of
Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space
Odyssey" was its premediated
ambiguity. Though it must be
remembered that some people
found it bewildering, hindsight
now allows us to say that enough
solid clues were dropped in the
film to support (and encourage)
any number of intellectual and
philosophical interpretations. The
ultimate substance of "2001"
was, for all its length, that of a
complex visual thesis pared down
to its absolute thematic essentials,
as the action was reduced from
Arthur C. Clarke's original story
and the final cut was less
elaborated than originally
planned.
In Kubrick's new, highly
praised film, "A Clockwork
Orange," the vision hasn't been
extended far enough, so that it is
impossible to tell what all the
technical and intellectual fuss is
all about. Critics and viewers have
posited that the film examines
violence, law-and-order or the
future, only to be rebuked by
being told that it is about the
right to free will, about the
conditioning of human beings
being practiced today which, if
allowed to continue, could be
imposed upon people by
governments with dehumanizing
results.
While people seemed to delight
in exchanging interpretations of
"2001," a disturbing note of
hostility pervades much discussion
of "A Clockwork Orange," partly
because the division between the
film's lovers and haters is
unmanageable (detractors of
"2001" had at least to
acknowledge its technical
brilliance) and partly because
word has it there exists a correct
interpretation of the film (perhaps
Kubrick was right after all in not
revealing his own thoughts on
"2001").
For me, trying to find anything
profound or even intellectually
interesting in "A Clockwork
Orange" is just as futile as trying
to extract depths of meaning from
the title — the results of both
endeavors are equally
disappointing. Author Anthony
Burgess has explained that the
title derives from an extinct
Cockney expression, "Queer as a
clockwork orange," which
attempted to relate the nature of
an object both inanimate and
living.
Dubious Status
This clearly exemplifies
protagonist Alex's state after he
has been conditioned to the point
of having, in effect, been deprived
of his soul and freedom of choice.
That's about it, though, and when
a work of artistic intent can be
summed up by a title (which in
itself isn't too illuminating), the

status of the work remains
dubious at best.
Unlike some detractors,
however, I was not bored by "A
Clockwork Orange" and, for the
most part, found it interesting to
watch. Unfortunately, my
continuing interest in Kubrick's
stylistic development coupled
with my finding the content quite
devoid of importance results in a
feeling of ambivalence, perhaps
the most damning of all responses.
Indeed, it seems a shame to
have to separate style and content
with Kubrick after "2001," where
style was so very much content.
While many scenes are visually
startling, in none of these scenes is
the power of the image supported
by the power of any convictions,
rendering "A Clockwork Orange,"
unlike "2001," a visual film in a
vacant sense.
For some reason, perhaps the
most memorable shot for me in
the entire Kubrick canon is the
recurring image of the work
horses drawing the starting gate
into place in "The Killing," one of
Kubrick's bleakest (and most
exciting) films. In "A Clockwork
Orange," at least one moment
approaches the magical and it also
relates to a repeated image.
Deja Vu
Early in the film, after what
used to be called a rumble, Alex
and his droogs drive by night to a
place illuminated "Home," after
which they enter an isolated home
and molest a writer and his wife.
Later on, Alex passes by the same
sign and enters the same house,
though he is now a fugitive. The
effect is that of experiencing
something one vaguely remembers
but can't place. Perhaps one
experienced it before, but perhaps
it was just in a dream.
At times exciting too is the
almost continual use of music. As
in "2001," Kubrick draws upon
classical music for his score,
largely Beethoven but with doses
of Rossini, Purcell, Elgar and,
rather offensively, Freed and
Brown's "Singin' in the Rain."
Occasionally, original Deutsche
Grammophon recordings are
placed but more often we hear,
for instance, Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony as played by Walter
Carlos on a Moog synthesizer.
Carlos, whose "Switched on
Bach" reportedly stands as the
best selling classical record of all
time, actually developed the
synthesizer with engineer Robert
Moog and his work for "A
Clockwork Orange" represents a
formidable achievement.
While the film strikes me as a
rather unimaginative vision of the
future and disappointingly
unilluminating intellectually, it
works rather well as a musical.
Many scenes, particularly the
violent ones, seem almost

choreographed and are
punctuated by Kubrick's fluid
camera and flurries of cutting.
Less Violence
Despite its X rating, this
stylization of the action makes "A
Clockwork Orange" seem rather
less violent than such R rated
films as "Straw Dogs" and "Dirty
Harry." Indeed, the only sequence
difficult to watch depicts Alex's
eyes being propped open for
prolonged periods so that he
cannot avoid watching films
designed to condition him against
sex and violence.
In the end, there really isn't
that much to say about "A
Clockwork Orange " One can J
discuss the violence, the title, the
film's relationship to the book,!
the so-called vision of the future
involved and Kubrick's!

philosophy, but I don't think it's
worth the time. Most of the
favorable reviews I've read have
been exceptionally filled with
superlatives with little thought in
evidence to back them up.
Malcolm McDowell is very good,
the use of music is effective and I
still like Kubrick's visual sense but
otherwise, "A Clockwork Orange"
is of decidedly minor interest.

PRISON INSPECTION—Chief Guard (Michael Bates) confronts Alex (Malcolm McDowell, right
foreground) during a prison inspection in "A Clockwork Orange."
One of the prime merits of
Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space
Odyssey" was its premediated
ambiguity. Though it must be
remembered that some people
found it bewildering, hindsight
now allows us to say that enough
solid clues were dropped in the
film to support (and encourage)
any number of intellectual and
philosophical interpretations. The
ultimate substance of "2001"
was, for all its length, that of a
complex visual thesis pared down
to its absolute thematic essentials,
as the action was reduced from
Arthur C. Clarke's original story
and the final cut was less
elaborated than originally
planned.
In Kubrick's new, highly
praised film, "A Clockwork
Orange," the vision hasn't been
extended far enough, so that it is
impossible to tell what all the
technical and intellectual fuss is
all about. Critics and viewers have
posited that the film examines
violence, law-and-order or the
future, only to be rebuked by
being told that it is about the
right to free will, about the
conditioning of human beings
being practiced today which, if
allowed to continue, could be
imposed upon people by
governments with dehumanizing
results.
While people seemed to delight
in exchanging interpretations of
"2001," a disturbing note of
hostility pervades much discussion
of "A Clockwork Orange," partly
because the division between the
film's lovers and haters is
unmanageable (detractors of
"2001" had at least to
acknowledge its technical
brilliance) and partly because
word has it there exists a correct
interpretation of the film (perhaps
Kubrick was right after all in not
revealing his own thoughts on
"2001").
For me, trying to find anything
profound or even intellectually
interesting in "A Clockwork
Orange" is just as futile as trying
to extract depths of meaning from
the title — the results of both
endeavors are equally
disappointing. Author Anthony
Burgess has explained that the
title derives from an extinct
Cockney expression, "Queer as a
clockwork orange," which
attempted to relate the nature of
an object both inanimate and
living.
Dubious Status
This clearly exemplifies
protagonist Alex's state after he
has been conditioned to the point
of having, in effect, been deprived
of his soul and freedom of choice.
That's about it, though, and when
a work of artistic intent can be
summed up by a title (which in
itself isn't too illuminating), the

status of the work remains
dubious at best.
Unlike some detractors,
however, I was not bored by "A
Clockwork Orange" and, for the
most part, found it interesting to
watch. Unfortunately, my
continuing interest in Kubrick's
stylistic development coupled
with my finding the content quite
devoid of importance results in a
feeling of ambivalence, perhaps
the most damning of all responses.
Indeed, it seems a shame to
have to separate style and content
with Kubrick after "2001," where
style was so very much content.
While many scenes are visually
startling, in none of these scenes is
the power of the image supported
by the power of any convictions,
rendering "A Clockwork Orange,"
unlike "2001," a visual film in a
vacant sense.
For some reason, perhaps the
most memorable shot for me in
the entire Kubrick canon is the
recurring image of the work
horses drawing the starting gate
into place in "The Killing," one of
Kubrick's bleakest (and most
exciting) films. In "A Clockwork
Orange," at least one moment
approaches the magical and it also
relates to a repeated image.
Deja Vu
Early in the film, after what
used to be called a rumble, Alex
and his droogs drive by night to a
place illuminated "Home," after
which they enter an isolated home
and molest a writer and his wife.
Later on, Alex passes by the same
sign and enters the same house,
though he is now a fugitive. The
effect is that of experiencing
something one vaguely remembers
but can't place. Perhaps one
experienced it before, but perhaps
it was just in a dream.
At times exciting too is the
almost continual use of music. As
in "2001," Kubrick draws upon
classical music for his score,
largely Beethoven but with doses
of Rossini, Purcell, Elgar and,
rather offensively, Freed and
Brown's "Singin' in the Rain."
Occasionally, original Deutsche
Grammophon recordings are
placed but more often we hear,
for instance, Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony as played by Walter
Carlos on a Moog synthesizer.
Carlos, whose "Switched on
Bach" reportedly stands as the
best selling classical record of all
time, actually developed the
synthesizer with engineer Robert
Moog and his work for "A
Clockwork Orange" represents a
formidable achievement.
While the film strikes me as a
rather unimaginative vision of the
future and disappointingly
unilluminating intellectually, it
works rather well as a musical.
Many scenes, particularly the
violent ones, seem almost

choreographed and are
punctuated by Kubrick's fluid
camera and flurries of cutting.
Less Violence
Despite its X rating, this
stylization of the action makes "A
Clockwork Orange" seem rather
less violent than such R rated
films as "Straw Dogs" and "Dirty
Harry." Indeed, the only sequence
difficult to watch depicts Alex's
eyes being propped open for
prolonged periods so that he
cannot avoid watching films
designed to condition him against
sex and violence.
In the end, there really isn't
that much to say about "A
Clockwork Orange " One can J
discuss the violence, the title, the
film's relationship to the book,!
the so-called vision of the future
involved and Kubrick's!

philosophy, but I don't think it's
worth the time. Most of the
favorable reviews I've read have
been exceptionally filled with
superlatives with little thought in

PRISON INSPECTION—Chief Guard (Michael Bates) confronts Alex (Malcolm McDowell, right
foreground) during a prison inspection in "A Clockwork Orange."
One of the prime merits of
Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space
Odyssey" was its premediated
ambiguity. Though it must be
remembered that some people
found it bewildering, hindsight
now allows us to say that enough
solid clues were dropped in the
film to support (and encourage)
any number of intellectual and
philosophical interpretations. The
ultimate substance of "2001"
was, for all its length, that of a
complex visual thesis pared down
to its absolute thematic essentials,
as the action was reduced from
Arthur C. Clarke's original story
and the final cut was less
elaborated than originally
planned.
In Kubrick's new, highly
praised film, "A Clockwork
Orange," the vision hasn't been
extended far enough, so that it is
impossible to tell what all the
technical and intellectual fuss is
all about. Critics and viewers have
posited that the film examines
violence, law-and-order or the
future, only to be rebuked by
being told that it is about the
right to free will, about the
conditioning of human beings
being practiced today which, if
allowed to continue, could be
imposed upon people by
governments with dehumanizing
results.
While people seemed to delight
in exchanging interpretations of
"2001," a disturbing note of
hostility pervades much discussion
of "A Clockwork Orange," partly
because the division between the
film's lovers and haters is
unmanageable (detractors of
"2001" had at least to
acknowledge its technical
brilliance) and partly because
word has it there exists a correct
interpretation of the film (perhaps
Kubrick was right after all in not
revealing his own thoughts on
"2001").
For me, trying to find anything
profound or even intellectually
interesting in "A Clockwork
Orange" is just as futile as trying
to extract depths of meaning from
the title — the results of both
endeavors are equally
disappointing. Author Anthony
Burgess has explained that the
title derives from an extinct
Cockney expression, "Queer as a
clockwork orange," which
attempted to relate the nature of
an object both inanimate and
living.
Dubious Status
This clearly exemplifies
protagonist Alex's state after he
has been conditioned to the point
of having, in effect, been deprived
of his soul and freedom of choice.
That's about it, though, and when
a work of artistic intent can be
summed up by a title (which in
itself isn't too illuminating), the

status of the work remains
dubious at best.
Unlike some detractors,
however, I was not bored by "A
Clockwork Orange" and, for the
most part, found it interesting to
watch. Unfortunately, my
continuing interest in Kubrick's
stylistic development coupled
with my finding the content quite
devoid of importance results in a
feeling of ambivalence, perhaps
the most damning of all responses.
Indeed, it seems a shame to
have to separate style and content
with Kubrick after "2001," where
style was so very much content.
While many scenes are visually
startling, in none of these scenes is
the power of the image supported
by the power of any convictions,
rendering "A Clockwork Orange,"
unlike "2001," a visual film in a
vacant sense.
For some reason, perhaps the
most memorable shot for me in
the entire Kubrick canon is the
recurring image of the work
horses drawing the starting gate
into place in "The Killing," one of
Kubrick's bleakest (and most
exciting) films. In "A Clockwork
Orange," at least one moment
approaches the magical and it also
relates to a repeated image.
Deja Vu
Early in the film, after what
used to be called a rumble, Alex
and his droogs drive by night to a
place illuminated "Home," after
which they enter an isolated home
and molest a writer and his wife.
Later on, Alex passes by the same
sign and enters the same house,
though he is now a fugitive. The
effect is that of experiencing
something one vaguely remembers
but can't place. Perhaps one
experienced it before, but perhaps
it was just in a dream.
At times exciting too is the
almost continual use of music. As
in "2001," Kubrick draws upon
classical music for his score,
largely Beethoven but with doses
of Rossini, Purcell, Elgar and,
rather offensively, Freed and
Brown's "Singin' in the Rain."
Occasionally, original Deutsche
Grammophon recordings are
placed but more often we hear,
for instance, Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony as played by Walter
Carlos on a Moog synthesizer.
Carlos, whose "Switched on
Bach" reportedly stands as the
best selling classical record of all
time, actually developed the
synthesizer with engineer Robert
Moog and his work for "A
Clockwork Orange" represents a
formidable achievement.
While the film strikes me as a
rather unimaginative vision of the
future and disappointingly
unilluminating intellectually, it
works rather well as a musical.
Many scenes, particularly the
violent ones, seem almost

choreographed and are
punctuated by Kubrick's fluid
camera and flurries of cutting.
Less Violence
Despite its X rating, this
stylization of the action makes "A
Clockwork Orange" seem rather
less violent than such R rated
films as "Straw Dogs" and "Dirty
Harry." Indeed, the only sequence
difficult to watch depicts Alex's
eyes being propped open for
prolonged periods so that he
cannot avoid watching films
designed to condition him against
sex and violence.
In the end, there really isn't
that much to say about "A
