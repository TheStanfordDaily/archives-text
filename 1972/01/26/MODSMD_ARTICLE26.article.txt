# Malcolm McDowell
## A 						Look At The Star 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Stanley Kubrick doesn't fly and all the ocean
liners are on winter cruises in the Caribbean, so he
sent Malcolm McDowell to the States to promote
"A Clockwork Orange." Over the last couple of
weeks, McDowell has parroted answers to the same
questions on the Dick Cavett and David Frost
Shows and must have met dozens, if not hundreds,
of interviewers with the same questions to pose.
It's Mc Do well's last day in San Francisco. He's
had several taping sessions already today and is due
for another before he goes to the Trident as an
invited guest for dinner. But now it's time for the
"underground press" conference and fifteen
longhairs looking distinctly out-of-place at the
Fairmont invade the Flood Suite, which would
provide a stunning view north to Marin and cast to
Berkeley if it weren't for the gusts of fog flashing
outside the windows.
McDowell, looking trim and dressed moderately
mod, is sick and still taping a radio interview but
leaps up to greet us anyway. Everyone immediately
pokes camera lenses and microphones in his face but
McDowell holds his ground with a continuous flow
of Rothman cigarettes, tea and booze.
The 28 year-old actor recounts for the umpteenth
time that he was born in Yorkshire but raised in
Liverpool, wanted to be a rock star but spent 18
months in repertory at Stratford-upon-Avon, which
he hated, was a coffee bean salesman and won the
lead in Lindsay Anderson's "1f..." by audition.
Next he co-starred with Robert Shaw in Joseph
Losey's "Figures in a landscape," an interesting
film which he estimates 4,000 people in the United
States have seen. Then "A Clockwork Orange" and
Bryan Forbes' "Long Ago, Tomorrow," which he
hopes will be released here within the month.
Working With Kubrick
What about Kubrick? Is he hard to work with?
How did you get the part? "Stanley liked 'If. . .'
and says he thought of me as Alex when he read l A
Clockwork Orange.'l worked with Stanley for three
months before shooting began and once you get to
know him, he's great to work with. I know he has
the reputation of being very authoritarian on the
set, but actually he's very open to suggestions. Not
difficult at all." Of Kubrick's films, McDowell has
seen only "Dr. Strangelove" and "2001" but, of
course, he thinks they're masterpieces.
The actor reveals that what happens to the writer
in the film actually happened to author Anthony
Burgess. During a blackout during World War Two,
two Gl's assaulted Burgess and his wife. Burgess
escaped with minor harm but his wife, having been
raped, was mentally destroyed and died within a
few weeks. Some years later, Burgess was told he
had but a year to live and, more or less to purge
himself, wrote five novels in that year. Fortunately,
Burgess is still with us.
A few latecomers sneak in and, trying to be
unobtrusive, proceed to add their own lenses and
mikes to the mess and ask McDowell where he's
from, what his previous acting experience was and
what it was like to work with Kubrick. McDowell

finally becomes irritated and groans along with the
rest of us. Then, trying to get onto another subject,
a middle-aged woman who clearly does not write for
an underground paper, begins to ask poor Malcolm
about his love life.
"Let's see now, you're not married?"
"It is rather shocking actually, 28 and not
married."
"Well then, what do you do ... er, what do you
think of Women's Lib?"
"/ can see some of their points, but I don't go
along with the ones that want to destroy men. I
rather like being what I am."
"Could you tell us what you do for fun ... I
mean, do you live alone ?"
"I'm alone part of the time."
"Yes, but who do you ..."
"I'm not a homosexual, if that's what you
mean."
Freedom Of Man
McDowell then argues with the critics from San
Francisco State who thought "A Clockwork
Orange" was a law-and-order film, finally setting us
all straight by saying that the film is about "the
freedom of man to choose which way he wants to
go." He says he's "not the kind of actor who takes
his part home with him at night," so the violence
hasn't worn off on McDowell's own personality.
Nor does he think of himself as anything like Alex.
"Much too shy."
As for McDowell's next project, it will be Lindsay
Anderson again but this time based on an original
story by McDowell himself concerning his days as a
coffee bean salesman. Not much more to say,
except that both Sir John Gielgud and Sir Ralph
Richardson have been signed for important roles. In
a brief moment alone, McDowell chuckles that he
liked it on the Dick Cavett Show when he claimed
he had to learn to hold his breath for 2% minutes
for the trough-dunking sequence. "Ask a stupid
question .. ." he sighed.
Malcolm McDowell still had another day of
promotioml duties to look forward to in New York,
but then it was back to London. Frankly, I hope he
can sleep off this American tour until shooting
begins on his new film in March.
