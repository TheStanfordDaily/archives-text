# Franklin Defense Fund Formed
## 
### DAN BRENNER 
The Faculty Political Action
Group (FPAG) and the ASSU
Council of Presidents announced
the formation of the Bruce
Franklin Legal Fund at a press
conference Monday. The Fund
has collected $5,300 in pledges
and cash toward a goal of $25,000
to take Franklin's dismissal to
court.
Prof. Bliss Camochan, chairman
of the English Department and a
spokesman for the fund, said that
a legal appeal of the Trustee's
decision to fire Franklin will be
based on the First Amendment
right of free speech, laws of
contract, and a California State
statute which forbids political
firings in certain cases. He is
hopeful that the American Civil
Liberties Union will join them.
He commented, "It is not
whimsical to suggest that Stanford
University would make the first
contribution."
No Assessment Money
Anne Kimball, speaking for the
Council of Presidents, noted that
no money collected from the
student assessment will be
donated to the fund. "If you look
at the rise in tuition, it would be
almost criminal to ask for any

money," she said.
Kimball remarked that she did
not feel the use of the ASSU as a
co-sponsor would conflict with
the ban on using ASSU facilities
for political purposes. "If Bruce
Franklin was a far-right professor,
the question would be the same,"
she said.
Kimball also noted that,
because of the large turnout in
last week's referendum, "a
substantial number of students"
feel that Franklin had received
"less than just treatment."
Prof. Raymond Giraud,
chairman of the French and
Italian Department, said that one
of the problems of the Advisory
Board's decision to fire Franklin
was the use of "intentionally
obscure prose" in making the
decision. He further observed, "I
should contest the fact that the
University has set up clear and
unambiguous rules" governing
faculty discipline.
'Chilling Effect'
Associate English Professor
Ronald Rebholz said that because
of the lack of explicit rules, there
would be a chilling effect among
untenured professors to speak up
in favor of Franklin. He also said
that the Administration had not

adequately considered the
minority report of the Advisory
Board in disposing of the case.
Kimball concurred, observing
that there was also a lack of
student input into the president's
decision. "It has become
increasingly clear that students

have no say in who is going to
teach them," she said.
Carnochan reported that the
fund had not determined when
legal proceedings will start. All
contributions will be
acknowledged and unused funds
will be returned.

Prof. Bliss Camochan, chairman
of the English Department and a
spokesman for the fund, said that
a legal appeal of the Trustee's
decision to fire Franklin will be
based on the First Amendment
right of free speech, laws of
contract, and a California State
statute which forbids political
firings in certain cases. He is
hopeful that the American Civil
Liberties Union will join them.
He commented, "It is not
whimsical to suggest that Stanford
University would make the first
contribution."
No Assessment Money
Anne Kimball, speaking for the
Council of Presidents, noted that
no money collected from the
student assessment will be
donated to the fund. "If you look
at the rise in tuition, it would be
almost criminal to ask for any

money," she said.
Kimball remarked that she did
not feel the use of the ASSU as a
co-sponsor would conflict with
the ban on using ASSU facilities
for political purposes. "If Bruce
Franklin was a far-right professor,
the question would be the same,"
she said.
Kimball also noted that,
because of the large turnout in
last week's referendum, "a
substantial number of students"
feel that Franklin had received
"less than just treatment."
Prof. Raymond Giraud,
chairman of the French and
Italian Department, said that one
of the problems of the Advisory
Board's decision to fire Franklin
was the use of "intentionally
obscure prose" in making the
decision. He further observed, "I
should contest the fact that the
University has set up clear and
unambiguous rules" governing
faculty discipline.
'Chilling Effect'
Associate English Professor
Ronald Rebholz said that because
of the lack of explicit rules, there
would be a chilling effect among
untenured professors to speak up
in favor of Franklin. He also said
that the Administration had not

adequately considered the
minority report of the Advisory
Board in disposing of the case.
Kimball concurred, observing
that there was also a lack of
student input into the president's
decision. "It has become
increasingly clear that students

have no say in who is going to
teach them," she said.
Carnochan reported that the
fund had not determined when
legal proceedings will start. All
contributions will be
acknowledged and unused funds
will be returned.
The Faculty Political Action
Group (FPAG) and the ASSU
Council of Presidents announced
the formation of the Bruce
Franklin Legal Fund at a press
conference Monday. The Fund
has collected $5,300 in pledges
and cash toward a goal of $25,000
to take Franklin's dismissal to
court.
Prof. Bliss Camochan, chairman
of the English Department and a
spokesman for the fund, said that
a legal appeal of the Trustee's
decision to fire Franklin will be

right of free speech, laws of
