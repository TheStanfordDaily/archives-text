# Second Day In A Row
## Police End Sit-in At Old Union 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
For the second straight day, police
yesterday drove demonstrators from
the Old Union after an aftemoon-long
occupation.
About 22 riot gear-clad,
club-wielding officers from the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Office poured
in through the back of the building at
5:25 p.m., in an almost exact replay of
Monday's maneuver.
About 80 protesters were inside the
building when the police arrived, with
another 40 gathered in the courtyard
in front of the Union. No arrests were
made, and no injuries were reported.
The protest began with a 12:15
p.m. rally in White Plaza, which was
advertised as a debate between
President Lyman and fired English
Professor H. Bruce Franklin.. Franklin
had challenged Lyman to a debate
Monday after the President had
"criticized my Marxism" in an
interview in the Daily.
Lyman Absent
Lyman did not attend yesterday's
meeting, so Franklin began a one-sided
debate. He attacked the President as
"an intellectual fraud," and said that a
book on the British political situation
of the mid-1920's authored by Lyman
"floats completely free of history."
As Franklin spoke, word reached
him through the crowd of about 270
that Vice-Provost Robert Rosenzweig
and Special Assistant to the President
John Schwartz were listening on the
fringes of the group. Franklin
immediately challenged them to come
forward and debate him, and, when
they refused, told the crowd that
"they debate by having people kicked
off campus and tossed in jail."
Returning to his attack on Lyman,
Franklin asked how such a man could
rise to the presidency of Stanford. A
demonstrator replied, "They didn't
want him in the History Department."
History Professor Hal Kahn,

claiming to be Lyman, briefly took
over the microphone to say that
Franklin was detrimental "to the
purity of our minds," and called him
"purile, inciteful. . . and impolite."
'Every Day'
Franklin again challenged the real
Lyman to show up for a debate, and
said he would remain on campus "any
day and every day" until the President
appeared.
After hearing from several more
speakers, about 85 people then
entered the Old Union. This figure was
considerably smaller than the
estimated 300 who took the building
Monday. The crowd at yesterday's
rally never exceeded 300; at Monday's
rally it numbered between 800 and
900.
Demonstrators were informed that
the Faculty Club had sustained some
$2000 dollars in losses during the
Monday night eat-in there.
Club Manager Forrest Tregea
estimated earlier in the day that $800
worth of silverware was taken, to
which Lenny Siegel replied at the
demonstration that "whoever took the
silverware, 1 hope they put it to good
use."
Catalogue
Tregea also said that eight lamps, 65
dinner plates, 60 wine glasses, and 39
pairs of silver salt and pepper shakers
were taken.
Confusion seemed to be one of the
group's primary problems after
entering the Old Union early yesterday
afternoon. Disappointed at the
diminished numbers and unsure of
their next move, the major body broke
into smaller groups to form demands
and decide on tactics.
Meeting again at about 3:45 p.m.,
the group listened to several possible
demands, including the rehiring of
Franklin, the ending of Defense
Department recruiting and microwave
research, granting students a major

voice in the selection of the Board of
Trustees, and increased student
support of staff workers.
A lengthy debate, never fully
resolved, centered on a call for-the
dismissal of controversial Professor
William Shockley.
'Really Stupid?'
One demonstrator told the group
that "you could off Shockley right
now, but it wouldn't do you any good.
Tactically, it's really stupid."
In other developments yesterday,
Encina Hall was evacuated for the
third time in a week yesterday

morning when a bomb threat was
received by the switchboard at about
7:50 a.m.
At an SRM steering committee
meeting also held last night it was
decided that a rally would be held
today at 12:15 at the Placement
Center. The rally has been called to
protest recruiting by the Bank of
America and Hewlett-Packard.
Fired English Professor H. Bruce
Franklin will hold his class,
"Literature and Revolution," in the
Old Union at 3:15 p.m. today. A
meeting will follow at 4:00 p.m.
