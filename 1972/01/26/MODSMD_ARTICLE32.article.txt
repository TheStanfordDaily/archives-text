# Assistants Hired
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Last Friday, Jack Christiansen
and Mike White were all alone
with their respective football
programs at Stanford and Cal.
Both men, however, have moved
quickly to surround themselves
with able coaching assistants.
Stanford's offer caught
Christiansen by surprise and he
has been hurriedly assembling a
staff this week. Two new names
were added to the Indian coaching
roster yesterday. Ray Handly of
West Point and George Seifert of
Oregon signed on as assistant
coaches, joining Bill Curry and
Bill Moultrie as aides to
Christiansen.
Handly, an assistant at the U.S.
Military Academy, played at
Stanford from 1963-5 and is the
Indian's all-time rushing leader.
Racking up 1768 yards in his Card
playing career, Handly carried for
a 4.4 average.
Cal Defeat
Instrumental in winning his last
game in an Indian uniform,
Handly sparked a 9-7 victory over
Cal in 1965 and was later chosen
to play in the 1965 East-West
Shrine Game.
Christiansen also chose
Oregon's defensive backfield
coach, Seifert, to help him in the
coming season. Seifert did an

excellent job with Oregon's backs.
Bill Drake of Oregon tied Benny
Barnes for the Pac-8 interception
title with seven, and Fred Manuel
also starred for the Ducks in the
defensive backfield.
Graduating from Utah in 1963
where he lettered three times at
offensive guard and end, Seifert
went to lowa as an assistant
before joining the Ducks. Seifert's
head coach Jerry Frei was fired
last week, and the young Duck
assistant is avoiding the imminent
coaching shake-up at Oregon by
coming to Stanford.
Cat Situation
At California, Mike White
announced the signing of former
Stanford assistant coaches Roger
Theder, Max McCartney, and Bill
Dickey as his aides. White left
only two assistants, Moultrie and
Curry, on The Farm in an
awesome display of recruiting
power.

The Stanford freshman
basketball team lost their second
game of the season last night,
83-71, to Merritt Junior College.
Rich Kelley led the Indians with
27 points in a game in which
dunking was allowed. Scott
Trobbe hit for 14 points and Mel
Arterbury netted 13 for the Tribe
frosh.
