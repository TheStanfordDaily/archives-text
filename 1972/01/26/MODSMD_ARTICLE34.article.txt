# Frosh Basketballers Lose First Game
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
After racking up seven
impressive victories, Stanford's
freshman basketball team lost its
first game of the season Saturday
night at St. Mary's. The 79-77
setback was the first suffered by a
Stanford freshman team since St.
Mary's tripped the 1970-71
Stanford frosh last February.
St. Mary's, now 10-3 for the
season, led by 17 points with just
six minutes left in the game. But
Stanford's aggressive full court
press caused several Gael
turnovers and the Indians rallied
to tie the score with 20 seconds
remaining.

St. Mary's controlled the ball
effectively until guard Mark Viera
was freed for a 15 foot jumper
with three seconds left. Viera hit
the shot and Stanford's hopes for
an undefeated season quickly
dissolved.
The Indians' first loss of the
season was caused by several
factors. Stanford's normally
dominant front line of 7 foot
center Rich Kelley and forwards
Mel Arterberry, Scott Trobbe, and
Archie Dean was outrebounded
by a massive St. Mary's trio which
averaged 6'9". Kelley was
sidelined most of the first half
after being charged with his third

foul seven minutes into the game.
Stanford was also confused by
an unusual matchup zone defense
employed by the Gaels. St. Mary's
assigned one man to high scoring
guard Mark Gilberg while the
other four men were aligning in a
zone similar to Stanford's
offensive setup.
As a result, Gilberg was held to
two points and the Indians had
trouble working the ball inside.
Stanford then resorted to long
range jump shots. "We shot a few
too many bombers," said guard
Mike Simons.
Stanford's own defense was
never up to par. St. Mary's

continually scored easy baskets
when the Indians failed to switch
effectively. "We just weren't
getting any inside help," lamented
Kelley.
Kelley led the Indian scorers
with 17 points. Arterberry,
Trobbe, and Dean also scored in
double figures.
The night before Stanford had
defeated the UC Davis frosh
85-74 at Davis. Trobbe led the
scoring with 16 points, Gilberg
and Kelley each tallied 15, and
Ben Bluitt contributed 14.
Stanford's frosh will play St.
Mary's again at Maples Pavilion
Feb. 12.
