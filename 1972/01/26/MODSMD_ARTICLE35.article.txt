# Iowan View Of Rose Bowl

Editor's note: The following
article on Stanford's 1972 Rose
Bowl victory by Donald Kaul is
reprinted from the January 12th
edition of the Des Moines
Register.
In a football season which, on
the average, saw a Game of the
Decade every other week, it was
left to Leland Stanford University
to strike a blow for the freedom
of the human spirit.
For the past 10 years or so — at
least — football has been
dominated by the Vince
Lombardi psychology'. Execution
of fundamentals, play with pain,
sacrifice, $50 fine for having fun
on the field.
It was bad enough in
professional football, where the
men are at least earning their
livelihoods playing that grim
game, but the attitude also was
adopted at the college level, where
the participants are, technically
speaking, amateurs.
The great college coaches —
men like Woody Hayes, Darrell
Royal, Ara Parseghian, Bo
Schembechler — tended to come
on like Prussian field officers.
Discipline, that was the key. A
team that won't be beat can't be
beat.
Even worse, the disease spread
to the high school and Little
League ranks. The country has
been inundated with frustrated
Pattons attempting to inspire their
immature charges to greater
heights of self-sacrifice and valor.
It wasn't football, it was a John
Wayne movie.
Then came Stanford and the
1972 Rose Bowl.
You could see the contrast in
styles in the pre-game television
interviews. Michigan was the
opponent and, coached by
Schembechler, very much in the
Vince Lombardi tradition.
"Run at their strength,"

"destroy the enemy." "Take no
prisoners." The players looked
like football players are supposed
to look — alley fighters.
The Stanford boys, on the
other hand, had an air of
insouciance about them. They had
long hair, mustaches. They
laughed a lot.
And when the game started
they used plays that looked as
though they'd made them up in
the huddle. By the end of the
game, even old Michigan alums
were rooting for them.
They won, of course. A
triumph of espirit over execution.
Even the Stanford band
outclasses Michigan.
Unless you've attended
Michigan, you probably don't
realize the effort that goes into its
band. They recruit Sousaphone
players like the football coach
recruits halfbacks.
They practice strutting in
straight lines for hours at a time
and they're good musicians and
they wear uniforms with brass
buttons and they seek to win the
weekly confrontations with all the
other university marching bands
who walk in straight lines and
wear Nineteenth-Century
uniforms.
Against mad Stanford, they
didn't have a chance.
The Stanford Music Unit

Thinkers ("SMUT," as they spell
it out on the field) is the funkiest
musical organization this side of
"The Grateful Dead."
Most of them dress in white
pants and shoes, red sport coats
and funny little white hats.
On Rose Bowl day, they came
onto the field chanting, "Beat
O-Hi-O." Already they were one
up on Michigan.
And when they lined up (to use
the phrase loosely), you noticed
that one of the trumpet players
was wearing a black cowboy hat.
The drummers' attire ranged from
a toga to bib overalls.
One young man was
barefooted, a fact not readily
discerned because he had taken
the trouble to paint his feet white.
The Michigan band was utterly
defeated. There's no way you can
impress the other guys with your
straight lines when the other guys
are falling down, laughing, saying:
"Hey, look at that will you?
Those clowns are marching in
straight lines!"
All in all, it was a bad day for
the advocates of monastic
dedication to trivial enterprises; a
great day for free spirits.
Who knows? If the trend keeps
on, maybe we'll be seeing Little
League coaches kicking kids off
their teams because they wear
their hair too short.

Most of them dress in white
pants and shoes, red sport coats
and funny little white hats.
On Rose Bowl day, they came
onto the field chanting, "Beat
O-Hi-O." Already they were one
up on Michigan.
And when they lined up (to use
the phrase loosely), you noticed
that one of the trumpet players
was wearing a black cowboy hat.
The drummers' attire ranged from
a toga to bib overalls.
One young man was
barefooted, a fact not readily

the trouble to paint his feet white.
The Michigan band was utterly
defeated. There's no way you can
impress the other guys with your
straight lines when the other guys
are falling down, laughing, saying:
"Hey, look at that will you?
Those clowns are marching in

All in all, it was a bad day for
the advocates of monastic

great day for free spirits.
Who knows? If the trend keeps

Bowl victory by Donald Kaul is

In a football season which, on
the average, saw a Game of the
Decade every other week, it was
left to Leland Stanford University
to strike a blow for the freedom
of the human spirit.
For the past 10 years or so — at
least — football has been
dominated by the Vince
Lombardi psychology'. Execution
of fundamentals, play with pain,
sacrifice, $50 fine for having fun
on the field.
It was bad enough in
professional football, where the
men are at least earning their
livelihoods playing that grim
game, but the attitude also was
adopted at the college level, where
the participants are, technically
speaking, amateurs.
The great college coaches —
men like Woody Hayes, Darrell
Royal, Ara Parseghian, Bo
Schembechler — tended to come
on like Prussian field officers.
Discipline, that was the key. A
team that won't be beat can't be
beat.
Even worse, the disease spread
to the high school and Little
League ranks. The country has
been inundated with frustrated
Pattons attempting to inspire their
immature charges to greater
heights of self-sacrifice and valor.
It wasn't football, it was a John
Wayne movie.
Then came Stanford and the
1972 Rose Bowl.
You could see the contrast in
styles in the pre-game television
interviews. Michigan was the
opponent and, coached by
Schembechler, very much in the
Vince Lombardi tradition.
"Run at their strength,"

"destroy the enemy." "Take no
prisoners." The players looked
like football players are supposed
to look — alley fighters.
The Stanford boys, on the
other hand, had an air of
insouciance about them. They had
long hair, mustaches. They
laughed a lot.
And when the game started
they used plays that looked as
though they'd made them up in
the huddle. By the end of the
game, even old Michigan alums
were rooting for them.
They won, of course. A
triumph of espirit over execution.
Even the Stanford band
outclasses Michigan.
Unless you've attended
Michigan, you probably don't
realize the effort that goes into its
band. They recruit Sousaphone
players like the football coach
recruits halfbacks.
They practice strutting in
straight lines for hours at a time
and they're good musicians and
they wear uniforms with brass
buttons and they seek to win the
weekly confrontations with all the
other university marching bands
who walk in straight lines and
wear Nineteenth-Century
uniforms.
Against mad Stanford, they
didn't have a chance.
The Stanford Music Unit

Thinkers ("SMUT," as they spell
it out on the field) is the funkiest
musical organization this side of
"The Grateful Dead."
