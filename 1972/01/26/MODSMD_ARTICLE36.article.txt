## IM Madness 
### Doug Wilson 
They said to write a relevant sports column. 1 don't know Bruce
Franklin or Jack Christiansen which leaves intra-murals. Which is
pretty relevant where I live.
Intra-mural sports may be the only unifying issue left. 1 live in a
house where people will leave sit-ins not because of police demands,
but because there's an IM soccer game with the Theta Delts at 4:30.
Actually, you can't get a really good turnout for sit-ins; between "A"
basketball practice in the afternoons, or last-ditch attempts to get in
some semblance of shape for the IM weightlifting or gymnastics
meets, there's just no time.
It all started with intra-mural football in the fall. Some houses have
playbooks, begun years ago and kept up to date, which — had Ralston
known - could have meant the difference against San Jose and Duke.
We aren't quite that ambitious, and must rely on the minds and
memories of jocks of high-school fame, who, resurrecting the plays
and patterns that brought moments of glory in Modesto and Wausau,
fight-fight-fight against the hordes from Cedro and Biz I, and cause
dinner to be delayed half an hour.
Not to say it doesn't get vicious. One of our backs had the lower
half of his exposed to the harsh elements and impressionable
spectators as his sweat pants were torn off in a flying tackle. It didn't
matter — we advanced to the semis, thank God — to be beaten by a
team we swore could have gone to the Rose Bowl. (A couple DID, but
redshirting loopholes means they can play IM's).
We were third in the IM cross-country. There were only three teams
entered, but don't tell that to the captain, who hadn't run since high
school days in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, and was three weeks in
training for this meet.
Last spring the intra-mural office (there IS an intra-mural office)
added a bicycle race to the list of events which includes soccer, track,
baseball, swimming, horseshoes, badminton, and ping poing. It was
brought up at the house meeting that we buy a durable ten-speed, and
that every effort be made to get as many people as possible (at a point
a person, I believe) to participate.
Points. Which is the point of intra-murals. The elaborate point
structure allows for a weighted scaling of events from single
participation points (nice try, and thanks for coming out) to 50 for
winning football or basketball. The Theta Delts take all this seriously;
they're winning with 169 and a half points. The Crothers Brothers are
at minus ten — probably for not showing up for badminton.
We're right up there at 74 points, and we've still got water polo and
horseshoes coming up in the spring. Our basketball team is playing in
an industrial league to sharpen up for IM competition, and if Isaac
Curtis doesn't sign at San Diego State, I think we've got a ringer for
track. That should keep us ahead of the Phi Kaps, Alondra-Faison, the
Snoids, Durand, the Tortfeasors, and Ya Ya - not to mention the
Crothers Brothers.
Me? I'm captain of the table tennis team ("A"s). We play a team
called Bonus Jack No Cheese ("A"s) this week. We're gonna kill 'em

Snoids, Durand, the Tortfeasors, and Ya Ya - not to mention the
Crothers Brothers.
Me? I'm captain of the table tennis team ("A"s). We play a team
called Bonus Jack No Cheese ("A"s) this week. We're gonna kill 'em
They said to write a relevant sports column. 1 don't know Bruce
Franklin or Jack Christiansen which leaves intra-murals. Which is
pretty relevant where I live.
Intra-mural sports may be the only unifying issue left. 1 live in a
house where people will leave sit-ins not because of police demands,
but because there's an IM soccer game with the Theta Delts at 4:30.
Actually, you can't get a really good turnout for sit-ins; between "A"
basketball practice in the afternoons, or last-ditch attempts to get in
some semblance of shape for the IM weightlifting or gymnastics
meets, there's just no time.
It all started with intra-mural football in the fall. Some houses have
playbooks, begun years ago and kept up to date, which — had Ralston
known - could have meant the difference against San Jose and Duke.
We aren't quite that ambitious, and must rely on the minds and
memories of jocks of high-school fame, who, resurrecting the plays
and patterns that brought moments of glory in Modesto and Wausau,
fight-fight-fight against the hordes from Cedro and Biz I, and cause
dinner to be delayed half an hour.
Not to say it doesn't get vicious. One of our backs had the lower
half of his exposed to the harsh elements and impressionable
spectators as his sweat pants were torn off in a flying tackle. It didn't
matter — we advanced to the semis, thank God — to be beaten by a
team we swore could have gone to the Rose Bowl. (A couple DID, but
redshirting loopholes means they can play IM's).
We were third in the IM cross-country. There were only three teams
entered, but don't tell that to the captain, who hadn't run since high
school days in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, and was three weeks in
training for this meet.
Last spring the intra-mural office (there IS an intra-mural office)
added a bicycle race to the list of events which includes soccer, track,
baseball, swimming, horseshoes, badminton, and ping poing. It was
brought up at the house meeting that we buy a durable ten-speed, and
that every effort be made to get as many people as possible (at a point
a person, I believe) to participate.
Points. Which is the point of intra-murals. The elaborate point
structure allows for a weighted scaling of events from single
participation points (nice try, and thanks for coming out) to 50 for
winning football or basketball. The Theta Delts take all this seriously;
they're winning with 169 and a half points. The Crothers Brothers are
at minus ten — probably for not showing up for badminton.
We're right up there at 74 points, and we've still got water polo and
horseshoes coming up in the spring. Our basketball team is playing in
an industrial league to sharpen up for IM competition, and if Isaac
Curtis doesn't sign at San Diego State, I think we've got a ringer for
track. That should keep us ahead of the Phi Kaps, Alondra-Faison, the
Snoids, Durand, the Tortfeasors, and Ya Ya - not to mention the
Crothers Brothers.
