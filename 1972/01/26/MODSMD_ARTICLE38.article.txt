Chisholm Candidacy
NEW YORK — Rep. Shirley Chisholm
officially became a Democratic
presidential candidate yesterday while
Sen. Edmund S. Muskie (D-Maine)
scored a significant gain in the same
race by winning the endorsement of
the governor of Pennsylvania.
Chisholm, 47, the first black woman
in Congress, formally announced her
candidacy in a church in the
Bedford-Stuyvesant slum of Brooklyn
where she grew up and once taught
school.
She said she would enter primaries
in Florida and North Carolina and
would run delegates in Pennsylvania,
Illinois and Massachusetts. She also
said she had an eye on the New York
primary.
Chisholm omitted mention of other
Democratic candidates in her formal
announcement of candidacy, although
she told newsmen afterward she
expected her campaign to hurt the
chances of New York Mayor John V.
Lindsay because "Lindsay will be
getting votes from the same area that I
am.
She told a standing-room-only
audience of well-wishers and newsmen
in the social hall of the Concord
Baptist Church that she was "not the
candidate of black America, although I
am black and proud. I am not the
candidate of the women's movement
in this country, although I am a
woman and I am equally proud of
that."
Attorney Arrested
SAN FRANCISCO - An attorney
helping with the Soledad Brothers
defense was arrested yesterday after
police stopped her as she sought to
enter the tightly-guarded murder trial.
Elane Wender, 29, a Berkeley
lawyer-investigator, later was brought
before Superior Court Judge S. Lee
Vavuris and told she had been booked
for investigation of contempt of court
for allegedly violating security
precautions ordered by Vavuris.
Wender, who was released without
bail, said the officers told her she
couldn't take a briefcase she was
carrying into court. She said she
voluntarily took it to her car and,
upon returning, was arrested.
Police Sgt. Lionel Hess said Wender
had been told to leave and was
arrested when she returned to the
courtroom area in the Hall of Justice.
Packard Replacement
WASHINGTON — President Nixon has

named Kenneth Rush, who taught him
law and later became ambassador to
West Germany, to the second-highest
civilian post in the Defense
Department.
Rush's nomination as deputy
secretary of defense, announced
yesterday by the White House, moves
him into position as a possible
successor to Secretary of Defense
Melvin Laird who is expected to resign
late this year no matter how the
presidential election comes out.
Rush, 62, of Rye, N.Y., will replace
David Packard, an electronics
industrialist who resigned late last year
to return to California.
As deputy defense secretary, Rush
will have a key decision-making role in
development and procurement of
weapons and a day-to-day
responsibility for administering the
defense machinery.
Hayden Dies
MESA, Ariz. — Former U.S. Sen. Carl
Trumbull Hayden, who represented
Arizona in Congress for nearly 57
years, died Tuesday night. He was 94.
Hayden attended Stanford
University at Palo Alto, Calif., from
1896 to 1900. He lost a close contest
for student body president, the last
time he failed to win an election in 60
years. He left college before graduating
when his father died.

After returning to Arizona, Hayden
was elected county treasurer, sheriff
and the state's first congressman.
Hayden, a Democrat, served in
Congress longer than any other
legislator in the nation's history. He
won re-election to the House six times
and was elected to the U.S. Senate in
1926. He served there until late 1968,
rising to president pro-tempore and
chairman of the Senate Appropriations
Committee.
He became acting vice president
after the assassination of President
John F. Kennedy in November 1963
and served in that capacity until
January 1965, when Hubert H.
Humphrey became vice president.
State Corruption
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Reagan's
water pollution control chief — under
demand by Reagan to quit — remained
in seclusion yesterday while Reagan
ordered a searching review of his
administration for more potential
conflict of interest.
Reagan demanded Monday that
Kerry Mulligan, 47, resign as $26,250
a year chairman of the State Water
Resources Control Board for alleged
conflict of interest, moonlighting as a
private engineering consultant.
The demand came just hours after a
warrant was issued in Honolulu for
Mulligan's arrest on a charge of trying
to bribe a city official concerning the
planning of a $42 million sewage
treatment plant.

water pollution control chief — under
demand by Reagan to quit — remained
in seclusion yesterday while Reagan
ordered a searching review of his
administration for more potential
conflict of interest.
Reagan demanded Monday that
Kerry Mulligan, 47, resign as $26,250
a year chairman of the State Water
Resources Control Board for alleged
conflict of interest, moonlighting as a
private engineering consultant.
The demand came just hours after a
warrant was issued in Honolulu for
Mulligan's arrest on a charge of trying
to bribe a city official concerning the
planning of a $42 million sewage
treatment plant.
Chisholm Candidacy
NEW YORK — Rep. Shirley Chisholm
officially became a Democratic
presidential candidate yesterday while
Sen. Edmund S. Muskie (D-Maine)
scored a significant gain in the same
race by winning the endorsement of
the governor of Pennsylvania.
Chisholm, 47, the first black woman
in Congress, formally announced her
candidacy in a church in the
Bedford-Stuyvesant slum of Brooklyn
where she grew up and once taught
school.
She said she would enter primaries
in Florida and North Carolina and
would run delegates in Pennsylvania,
Illinois and Massachusetts. She also
said she had an eye on the New York
primary.
Chisholm omitted mention of other
Democratic candidates in her formal
announcement of candidacy, although
she told newsmen afterward she
expected her campaign to hurt the
chances of New York Mayor John V.
Lindsay because "Lindsay will be
getting votes from the same area that I
am.
She told a standing-room-only
audience of well-wishers and newsmen
in the social hall of the Concord
Baptist Church that she was "not the
candidate of black America, although I
am black and proud. I am not the
candidate of the women's movement
in this country, although I am a
woman and I am equally proud of
that."
Attorney Arrested
SAN FRANCISCO - An attorney
helping with the Soledad Brothers
defense was arrested yesterday after
police stopped her as she sought to
enter the tightly-guarded murder trial.
Elane Wender, 29, a Berkeley
lawyer-investigator, later was brought
before Superior Court Judge S. Lee
Vavuris and told she had been booked
for investigation of contempt of court
for allegedly violating security
precautions ordered by Vavuris.
Wender, who was released without
bail, said the officers told her she
couldn't take a briefcase she was
carrying into court. She said she
voluntarily took it to her car and,
upon returning, was arrested.
Police Sgt. Lionel Hess said Wender
had been told to leave and was
arrested when she returned to the
courtroom area in the Hall of Justice.
Packard Replacement
WASHINGTON — President Nixon has

named Kenneth Rush, who taught him
law and later became ambassador to
West Germany, to the second-highest
civilian post in the Defense
Department.
Rush's nomination as deputy
secretary of defense, announced
yesterday by the White House, moves
him into position as a possible
successor to Secretary of Defense
Melvin Laird who is expected to resign
late this year no matter how the
presidential election comes out.
Rush, 62, of Rye, N.Y., will replace
David Packard, an electronics
industrialist who resigned late last year
to return to California.
As deputy defense secretary, Rush
will have a key decision-making role in
development and procurement of
weapons and a day-to-day
responsibility for administering the
defense machinery.

Arizona in Congress for nearly 57
years, died Tuesday night. He was 94.

legislator in the nation's history. He
won re-election to the House six times
and was elected to the U.S. Senate in
1926. He served there until late 1968,
rising to president pro-tempore and
chairman of the Senate Appropriations
Committee.
He became acting vice president
after the assassination of President
John F. Kennedy in November 1963
and served in that capacity until
January 1965, when Hubert H.
Humphrey became vice president.

SACRAMENTO — Gov. Reagan's
water pollution control chief — under
demand by Reagan to quit — remained
in seclusion yesterday while Reagan
ordered a searching review of his
administration for more potential
conflict of interest.
Reagan demanded Monday that
Kerry Mulligan, 47, resign as $26,250
a year chairman of the State Water
Resources Control Board for alleged
conflict of interest, moonlighting as a
private engineering consultant.
The demand came just hours after a
warrant was issued in Honolulu for
Mulligan's arrest on a charge of trying
to bribe a city official concerning the
planning of a $42 million sewage
treatment plant.
