# Lyman Galls Interrupting Class 'Ominous' In Special Interview
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
President Lyman called the
interruption of classes by Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement members
"ominous" during a KZSU interview
broadcast last night.
In an interview taped Monday at his
home, President Lyman said the
interruptions of classes and coercion
of faculty members have ominous
implications. "I'm surprised that there
has been so little response from the
faculty," Lyman commented.
The President also stated fears that
student and faculty members on the
Board of Trustees, "would make the
Board more representative at the risk
of making it more managerial." He
expressed the view that the Trustees
should be ren.oved from day-to-day
decision making, with their
participation confined "to major
questions and long term issues."
In a related incident, a reporter for
the United Stanford Employee's
newspaper Employees Organize
yesterday accused KZSU of bowing to

University pressure to exclude Union
reporters from Lyman's press
conferences.
In a speech at the Old Union sit-in,
Hospital worker Jan Sutter noted that,
"a USE reporter has been allowed to
participate at only every other of the
bi-weekly press conferences. And this
week, when our turn came up, Lyman
cancelled the live conference and
instead taped an interview on
Monday."
In a statement submitted to the
Daily yesterday evening, Sutter wrote,
"We feel Employees Organize has been
denied its right to interview Dr.
Lyman on KZSU. But this is nothing
new. For the majority of Stanford
workers, freedom of speech and
inquiry is a bitter joke anyway. This
was just another instance in a long
history of hypocritical maneuvers to
deny us access to Stanford media.
"In the past, University Relations
office has repeatedly threatened KZSU
that Lyman wouldn't appear if a single
Union reporter were present at the

broadcast. We have to fight to ask him
three simple questions a month,"
Sutter concluded.
KZSU News Director Pete Williams
denied that the Office of University
Relations had ever specifically
requested that Employees Organize be
excluded from the Lyman
conferences. "They did express the
wish that the sessions remain
principally a student press
conference," he added.
Williams pointed out that the
broadcast last night was not a
substitute for the regular conference,
but rather a special interview granted
by University Relations identical in
nature to the interview with President
Lyman published in the Daily
Monday.
"In the past we've treated USE on
the same basis as outside media such as
the Palo Alto Times, the KZSU News
Director explained. "But I recognize
that they are a special case, and we are
giving serious thought to revising our
policy," he concluded.
