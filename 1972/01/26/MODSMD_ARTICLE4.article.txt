# NLRB Allows University Employees To Unionize
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
The National Labor Relations Board
Thursday directed that three different
groups of Stanford employees,
including some 1700 workers, be
allowed to hold elections to choose a
union to represent them in collective
bargaining.
The decision means that for the first
time in its history, the University will
have to deal with labor unions on a
large scale.
The National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) decision, released yesterday,
recognized three different groups of
employees as eligible for collective
bargaining: police, firemen, and a large
classification including maintenance
workers, lab support personnel,
custodians, food service workers,
audio-visual operators employed at the
main campus or SLAC, and University
Press employees not currently
members of a union.
The decision specifically excluded
clerical workers and employees of the

Stanford Hospital. The NLRB found
that neither group had any common
interest with the other University
workers.
The entire text of the 21-page
decision will be reprinted in
Thursday's Daily.
The decision was handed down a
year and a half after the NLRB
conducted extensive hearings on how
to construct appropriate bargaining
units for University employees, and it
constituted a victory of sorts for the
California School Employees
Association and the Stanford
Employees Association (CSEA-SEA).
The CSEA-SEA had to fight with
several other groups over how the
bargaining units would be set up.
Several other unions — notably the
Teamsters — wanted to make small,
specialized units; other parties in the
dispute — United Stanford Employees
and the University itself — wanted
only the Police Department separate
from one massive union including
clerical workers and professionals.
The decision does not forbid clerical
workers and hospital employees from
unionizing in the future, however.
The CSEA-SEA recommendations
were followed almost exactly, while
proposals by the Teamsters Union;
Freight Checkers, Clerical Employees
and Helpers, Local 856; International
Association of Fire Fighters, Local
1-12, AFL-CIO; Stanford Police
Officers Association; Construction
General Laborers Local 270,
International Hod Carriers, Building,
and Common Laborers Union of
America; United Stanford Employees;
and Workers Action Caucus were
rejected.
The elections will probably be held
within the next month. The Police
Department will vote on whether it
wants to be represented by the
Stanford Police Officers Association;

firemen will decide if they want to let
the AFL-CIO Fire Fighters group be
their agent. The large third group of
employees can choose from any of the
other unions that submitted proposals
at the NLRB hearings.
Any employee who works more
than 20 hours a week is eligible to vote
— including students. Before the
elections can take place the University
must provide NLRB with lists of
eligible voters for each of the three
bargaining units; any union involved in
the elections can contest the list.
As it stands the description of
workers belonging to the third and
largest group is not well defined in the
decision. Testimony and discussion
which took place at the hearings will
be used to define categories such as
"lab-support" and "maintenance"
more carefully.
When the actual elections are held,
there will be an option for the workers
not to be represented by any of the
unions on the ballot. The third group
is the only unit having several unions
to choose from, and if none receive a
majority of the votes, a run-off
election will be held between the top
two.
The NLRB hearings were some of
the longest in its history, partly
because of the careful consideration it
gave to. including clerical workers in
the bargaining units. The NLRB's
decision, however, followed its
previous practice of not including
these workers despite arguments to the
contrary by the University and USE.
Then in 1969 the NLRB found that
since Cornell University was engaged
in interstate commerce, it could define
bargaining units and supervise
elections. Since then about ten other
colleges have received similar
judgements allowing unionization on
their campuses.

large scale.
The National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) decision, released yesterday,
recognized three different groups of
employees as eligible for collective
bargaining: police, firemen, and a large
classification including maintenance
workers, lab support personnel,
custodians, food service workers,
audio-visual operators employed at the
main campus or SLAC, and University
Press employees not currently
members of a union.
The decision specifically excluded
clerical workers and employees of the

Stanford Hospital. The NLRB found
that neither group had any common
interest with the other University
workers.
The entire text of the 21-page
decision will be reprinted in
Thursday's Daily.
The decision was handed down a
year and a half after the NLRB
conducted extensive hearings on how
to construct appropriate bargaining
units for University employees, and it
constituted a victory of sorts for the
California School Employees
Association and the Stanford
Employees Association (CSEA-SEA).
The CSEA-SEA had to fight with
several other groups over how the
bargaining units would be set up.
Several other unions — notably the
Teamsters — wanted to make small,
specialized units; other parties in the
dispute — United Stanford Employees
and the University itself — wanted
only the Police Department separate
from one massive union including
clerical workers and professionals.
The decision does not forbid clerical
workers and hospital employees from
unionizing in the future, however.
The CSEA-SEA recommendations
were followed almost exactly, while
proposals by the Teamsters Union;
Freight Checkers, Clerical Employees
and Helpers, Local 856; International
Association of Fire Fighters, Local
1-12, AFL-CIO; Stanford Police
Officers Association; Construction
General Laborers Local 270,
International Hod Carriers, Building,
and Common Laborers Union of
America; United Stanford Employees;
and Workers Action Caucus were
rejected.
The elections will probably be held
within the next month. The Police
Department will vote on whether it
wants to be represented by the
Stanford Police Officers Association;

firemen will decide if they want to let
the AFL-CIO Fire Fighters group be
their agent. The large third group of
employees can choose from any of the
other unions that submitted proposals
at the NLRB hearings.
Any employee who works more
than 20 hours a week is eligible to vote
— including students. Before the
elections can take place the University
must provide NLRB with lists of
eligible voters for each of the three
bargaining units; any union involved in
the elections can contest the list.
As it stands the description of
workers belonging to the third and
largest group is not well defined in the
decision. Testimony and discussion
which took place at the hearings will
be used to define categories such as
"lab-support" and "maintenance"
more carefully.
When the actual elections are held,
there will be an option for the workers
not to be represented by any of the
unions on the ballot. The third group
is the only unit having several unions
to choose from, and if none receive a
majority of the votes, a run-off
election will be held between the top
two.
The NLRB hearings were some of
the longest in its history, partly
because of the careful consideration it
gave to. including clerical workers in
the bargaining units. The NLRB's
decision, however, followed its
previous practice of not including
these workers despite arguments to the
contrary by the University and USE.
Then in 1969 the NLRB found that
since Cornell University was engaged
in interstate commerce, it could define
bargaining units and supervise
elections. Since then about ten other
colleges have received similar
judgements allowing unionization on
their campuses.
The National Labor Relations Board
Thursday directed that three different
groups of Stanford employees,
including some 1700 workers, be
allowed to hold elections to choose a
union to represent them in collective
bargaining.
