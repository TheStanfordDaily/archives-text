# Delay Possible For Senate Vote

job.
The 10 seats were not filled last
year, because there were no candidates
for them. 10 nominations have been
filed for the six Engineering and Earth
Sciences seats, three for the Education
positions, and only one in the
Graduate and Unaffiliated category.
Opinions vary on the possible
impact of the election. Jefferson
claims the Senate has been running
efficiently so far, and that the new
members "will add to that efficiency."
He noted that at present, two
Senate committees are lacking some
members, and that more committees
have been proposed.
10 new members, he said, would
help fill some of these gaps.
Many candidates indicated
yesterday that interest in the Senate
was low in their departments, and
were unsure of possible effects on
Senate operations by the new
members.
Richard Simpson, a candidate from
the Engineering School, said he did
not expect much change, because
interest in the Senate of department

An election to fill 10 vacant seats in
the ASSU Senate is scheduled for
Friday, but recent complications may
delay the vote.
The 10 seats, all representing
graduate schools, have been empty
since the original Senate elections
early last November, and some
criticism has been expressed
concerning the absence of such a large
block (25 percent) from the body.
In recent days, however, the
resignation of Elections Commissioner
Alice Furumoto has seemed imminent.
Furumoto says "I've been trying to get
out of it for the past three weeks."
Senate Chairman James Jefferson
noted Monday night that he was
anticipating her resignation shortly,
and indicated that a vacancy in the job
of commissioner might effect the
election for the Senate seats.
A decision on whether to hold the
election Friday, as originally
scheduled, or to delay it until the
following Monday will be made today.
Jefferson said he knew of at least
one person who indicated he wants the

members was very little. He suggested
that some Senators might not even
attend the meetings, and added, "I
don't expect the response to be
overwhelming."
Dan Cooper indicated a similar
attitude in his department, the School
of Education. Noting the school is
"fairly isolated" from the University
and has an active student association
of its own, he said most feel the
Senate was not a "pressing matter."
Chris Stevenson, another Education
candidate, agreed that student interest
was low, but noted that the new
members might be "a kind of pivotal
block" on close Senate votes. Several
important votes this year in the Senate
have been close, and at least one
meeting has been cancelled for lack of
a quorum.
Another Engineering candidate, Kip
Prahl, claimed the "Senate has not
been productive," and said he hoped
to divert the group "away from issues
it does not have the power to deal
with," and onto subjects of more
immediate concern with student
affairs.
