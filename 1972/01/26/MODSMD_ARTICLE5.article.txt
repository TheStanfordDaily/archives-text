# Servan-Schreiber Retires Here
## 
### DAN BRENNER 
For Jean-Louis Servan-Schreiber,
who made millions as a publishing
magnate in France and retired last year
at 32, there is something more to life
than private planes, limousines, and
lavish expense accounts. He's not sure
what that is, but he intends to spend
his retirement looking for it.
Jean-Louis, the shadow-brother of
Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, the
well-knwon expert on American
multi-national corporations discussed
his attitude toward business ethics and
his own career yesterday at the
Business School luncheon series on
corporate responsibility.
"You cannot be effective in
business unless you manipulate
people," the elegant, eloquent
Frenchman declared. "The more I
succeeded the more 1 found out the
job was boring."
Servan-Schreiber, who considers
himself "a retired youngster," was the
corporate chairman of L'Expresse
Publishing Group, a collection of
French news and business publications
whose newsmagazine L'Expresse is one
of the country's largest weeklies. He
also founded the business weekly of
Paris, L' Expansion.
Communication Lecturer
He is at Stanford as a lecturer in the
Department of Communication,
finishing the second of a two-quarter
assignment here. He applied his
doctrine of manipulation to his
present teaching position.
"You always manipulate to a certin
extent. I manipulated Stanford
University," he observed,
tongue-in-cheek. "1 came here becuase
I wanted to."

He also came here, officially
anyway, because he left L'Expresse
Group over an argument with his
brother. Jean-Louis claims
Jean-Jacques, who has a majority
interest in the corporation, wanted to
change the editorial direction of the
house publications to promulgate his
own political career. Jean-Louis, the
business maestro of the corporation,
wanted no such thing, and so
/rere-Louis resigned as chairman and
left.
"My brother has wanted to go into
politics all his life," Jean-Louis said.
Jean-Jacques is a candidate for Premier
of France.
Retirement at 35
But beyond the family squabble,
Jean-Louis had been planning to get
out of business with his millions by
age 35 in any case. The political
manuvering by his brother was a
convenient out.
"You can always walk out of
business; you can't walk out of
yourself," he noted. And so, realizing
that he had enough francs to live a
gentleman's life for a quarter century
or so, and feeling the growing chasm
between his family and his
12-hour-a-day neurosis called big
business, he signed on the dotted line
and retired.
"1 think business is needed and
important. But j(ou must keep your
distance from it. We are all neurotic
about work," he philosophised.
His wife, Claude, a naturally
beautiful complement to elegant
Jean-Louis, is also involved in
publications as a writer for Ellc, a
popular French women's magazine.
The Servan-Schreibers have two young

daughters, who have been a major
factor in Jean-Louis's decision to get
out of big business.
His students and fellow faculty are
impressed with his precise and wide
knowledge of the intricate problems of
publishing. Brian Hardy, an MBA
candidate enrolled in Jean-Louis'

communication seminar says of him,
"He is an egocentric man and he
personally admits it."
Before one lecture, the publishing
wizard prefaced his talk by the caveat,
"I know this is an ego trip." But, notes
Hardy, "A person can accept thf-t if
