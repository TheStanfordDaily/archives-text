## No Alternative 
### 
The past two days of sit-ins in the Old Union should come as no
surprise to anyone — especially the University Administration. The
long, drawn-out Franklin affair has proved, above all else, the
powerless position of the student body on questions of importance.
Totally excluded from the decision-making process, students could
only watch helplessly as a professor (one who was more than
superficially interested in undergraduate education) was fired. A
subsequent referendum drawing the largest non-presidential election
vote in years, was, according to Trustee Ira Hall, dismissed by the
Board in little more than an instant.
For those intensely disturbed and frustrated by the Franklin ouster,
there was little alternative. A large, spirited display of protest had to
be made. Considering the uneasy coalition of groups making up the
Stanford Rehabilitation Movement, it was unclear whether or not a
demonstration would be violent; with Columbae House one of its
prime forces, it seemed likely that any mass action would not be.
But because the primary force behind the University
Administration is a group of riot-equipped sheriff's deputies, even a
peaceful sit-in is destined not to remain peaceful.
Yet surprisingly, police have been small in numbers and restrained
in action. Just as the demonstrators Tuesday night held to their
decision not to trash, the police have followed wise orders to move
cautiously, and no heads have been bloodied.
Still, we believe there is truth to the protesters' claims that the
presence of police on campus is a defeat for the University. The
Administration's refusal to negotiate a settlement, and strict
adherence to a de-humanistic policy viewing sit-ins as "not acceptable
form(s) of political action within the University" must be changed.
All sit-ins "will be brought to an end as soon as possible," said
President Lyman last spring. But as injunctions are sought, outspoken
professors dismissed, and student complaints through referendums
ignored, the shallowness of such a stand becomes apparent.
The student movement is not dead. And the University will not
make it go away without radical changes in its decision making
procedures.
