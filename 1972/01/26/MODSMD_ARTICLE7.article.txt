## Retain Franklin's Idiocy 
### 
Stanford University is about to
make a grievous mistake in the
case of Prof. A. Bruce Franklin, a
self-style Maoist revoltuionary and
sometime teacher of English
literature.
The Stanford faculty advisory
board decided the other day that
Mr. Franklin ought to be fired
immediately for inciting campus
violence on two occasions about a
year ago.
Nothing daunted by the
board's decision, Mr. Franklin
told reporters after the hearing he
hoped there would be violence on
the Stanford campus to protest
the ruling, which he called
"fascist" and said was evidence
that "there is no such thing as

freedom for people on the left in
any college in this country."
As Mr. Franklin thundered on,
his wife stood by holding a rifle.
Mr. Franklin said the rifle
symbolized the couple's belief
that, as Chairman Mao has said,
political power comes from the
muzzle of a gun.
Now, the most disastrous
mistake Stanford could make at
this point would be to fire Mr.
Franklin. At the moment, Mr.
Franklin is giving very convincing
evidence of being an idiot. Being
fired would make him an instant
martyr. In our society, martyrs
are accorded higher status than
idiots.

The thing for Stanford to do at
this point is to offer Mr. Franklin
two options.
Option One: Mr. Franklin
could accept the chairmanship of
a newly-created Department of
Maoist Literature. Mr. Franklin
would be the only faculty
member in this department. He
would be allowed to accept
whatever students he wished and
teach whatever he wanted. The
only conditions would be that
Mr.Franklin would have to wear a
Mao suit at all public appearances,
carry a belt full of live hand
grenades and deliver all his public
pronouncements in Chinese. Also,
his wife would be required to pass

a test in rifle marksmanship.
Option Two: Mr. Franklin and
his spouse could accept one-way
tickets to Red China and
appointments to the faculty of
the People's University of Peking,
which President Nixon and
Premier Chou En Lai would
undoubtedly be happy to arrange
as a goodwill gesture. Mr. Franklin
would thus be free to practice his
ideas of academic freedom in a
milieu which he seems to find
more congenial than that of
Stanford. How long he would be
allowed to teach before being
brought before a firing squad
would be entirely up to himâ€”and
Chairman Mao.
