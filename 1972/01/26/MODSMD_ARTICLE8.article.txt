# The 						Lottery System And The Loophole
## 
### 
During the last week of
December, 1971, the Defense
Department announced that there
would probably be no induction
calls until April, 1972. If this
proves to be true, then one whole
selection group of the lottery
system will escape induction
completely. People in this group,
however, will be top priority for
induction orders should the
Defense Department suddenly
announce significant calls for the
first 3 months of 1972. But if
calls are low or non-existent, as
predicted for these 3 months, it
will be as if people in this group
received a second chance at a
lottery drawing—and won this
time.
The fact of this so-called
loophole was widely publicized in
late December, significantly so
because there was an element of
choice for some men holding
deferments as to whether or not
to gamble entering the lottery
pool. The structure of the lottery
system and how the loophole was
created, however, were not well
covered in the same sources. In
this article we will discuss these
points in order to give a fuller
background for understanding a

man's order of call and likelihood
of induction.
A man receives a lottery
number from a drawing held in
the calendar year of his 19th
birthday. In the calendar year of
his 20th birthday he is the First
Priority Selection Group if he is
classified 1-A, 1-A-0, 1-0, or 1-H,
or becomes so classified during
that year. If he holds a deferment
such as 2-S during the year of his
20th birthday, he enters the First
Priority Selection Group in the
year in which he turns 1-A, 1-A-0,
1-0, or 1-H. A man may be
drafted out of this group if his
number is reached by the national
call and if he is fully available for
induction.
A man who is in the First
Priority Selection Group on
December 31 of a calendar year,
whose lottery number has been
reached, but who has not been
drafted, is placed in the Extended
Priority Selection Group (EPSG)
on January 1 of the subsequent
year. It is a large part of this
group that may escape induction
if there are no draft calls this
January, February, and March.
There is an EPSG sub-group
that corresponds to each calendar

year of First Priority Selection
Group. Sub-group A is made up of
men extended from First Priority
Selection Group in 1970, with
lottery numbers of 195 and
below. Sub-group B is made up of
men extended from First Priority
Selection Group in 1971, with
lottery numbers of 125 and
below.

A man will be inducted from
the EPSG during the January,
February and March calls of the
year in which he enters this group,
if his number is reached by the
national cut-off for those calls. He
will be ordered for induction
ahead of the First Priority
Selection Group for that year.
For 1972, this is the order of
call to be used for inductions, if
there are any, in the first 3
months: 1. volunteers and men
still under postponed induction
orders that were previously issued.
2. Sub-group A (from 1970) of
the EPSG, by lottery number,
lowest first. 3. Sub-group B (from
1971) of the EPSG, by lottery
number, lowest first. 4. First
Priority Selection Group of 1972,
by lottery number, lowest first.
The important fact defining
the loophole is the following. Any
man is the EPSG, whose number
is not reached in the January,
February and March calls of the
year in which he entered the
EPSG, shall be placed in the
Second Priority Selection Group

on April 1 of that year. The
Second Priority Selection Group
means virtual immunity from
induction in the regular draft, in
that it would only be called under
a World War II scale mobilization.
The doctor draft is a different
case and should be discussed
separately.
For 1972, the EPSG situation

works out in the following way.
Men in Sub-group B (from 1971)
of the EPSG will be free from the
draft if their number is not
reached by the March, 1972, call.
They may be appealing their
classification, taking a physical, or
otherwise not fully available
during this time, but it will not
affect the fact of whether their
number is or is not reached.
Sub-group A (from 1970) of the
EPSG is not affected by this 3
month period of 1972. Its 3
month period was at the
beginning of 1971, and most men
in that group had their numbers
reached by March of 1971, since
the calls were relatively high at
that time. They continue, then, to
be vulnerable to induction in top
priority when calls are resumed.
Since no man holding a
deferment can enter Sub-group B
(from 1971) of the EPSG without
having acted to drop his
deferment by December 31,
1971, this group is now closed.
Men in the group who stand to
gain from no or low inductions

must simply be aware of public
notice of draft calls for the next 2
months. The fact of no January
call has been announced. It
appears almost definite that there
will be no February call. A March
call would have to be announced
by mid-February at the latest.
Induction orders must be mailed
at least 30 days prior to the date
of induction, and all induction
dates for the March call have to be
before April 1. Therefore, all
induction orders and numbers
reached have to be determined by
March 1.
A man who has dropped a 2-S
deferment in order to enter
Sub-group B of the EPSG may
request the return of his 2-S if he
still qualifies as a student. This
would be a likely alternative for
many students if high draft calls
were unexpectedly announced for
March. When such a student's 2-S
expired, however, he would fall
back into Sub-Group B of the
EPSG, and be high priority for
induction if there were calls at
that time.
Local Board Memorandum No.
99 as am mended November 3,
1971, is the section of the
regulations which establishes the
priorities and order of call of the
lottery system. Anyone wishing to
further clarify the current EPSG
situation can do so in the Special
Services Office, Room 324, Old
Union. Local Board Memorandum
No. 99 also discusses the
timeliness of information
submitted to the local board for
placement into lottery selection
groups.
