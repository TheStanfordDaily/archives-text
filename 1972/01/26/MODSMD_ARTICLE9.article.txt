# laudable purposes frustrated
## Ideals Versus Survival In A Real World 
### 
Robert g. cohn

After all the soul-searching and
debate over the Franklin affair,
there is still considerable
confusion about the fundamental
issue. It seems a safe proposition
that there is almost no one at
Stanford who is not still torn,
when he turns his mind to the
affair by the age-old conflict
between ideals and reality. Few of
us would give up, before we
absolutely had to, our aim to be
tolerant of others' views and to be
generally civilized, peaceful and
non-coercive. For that, of course,
defines our humanity. But
implacable events occasionally
frustrate our most laudable
purposes. Of what use are
tolerance and desire for fraternity,
or at least co-existence, in the
instance of a Hitler? Or of anyone
else who is out to destroy us—in
the name of history, or universal
justice, or whatever—no matter
what we try to do? At such a
juncture, some portion or aspect
of the ideals must be
reluctantly—recognizing that our
humanity depends on the force of

that word—put into abeyance for
the sake of single survival.
Imagine someone with normal
Fellow-feeling who picks up a
hitch-hiker and who discovers en
route that the rider is carrying a
gun and is momentarily observing
the rules of polite behavior only
as a ruse: as soon as the driver's
vigilance flags, the hitch-hiker is
going to jump him and seize the
vehicle, dropping him off at the
nearest ditch. Would anyone
blame the Samaritan if he found
an opportunity to proceed
without the hitch-hiker,
particularly a lawful opportunity,
such as the assistance of a
policeman if the rider refused to
get out? Agreed, as Rousseau
observed, the law itself is a ruse in
some ultimate (non-operational)
sense, stacking the cards in favor
of those who hold for
co-existence as against those who
may be able to gain dignity only
by natural struggle, man against
man. Nonetheless, it is likely that
the driver, in a swift appraisal,
would opt for the law as a better

bet for his own survival and that
of mankind generally, and that
few of us would fault him for this
choice.
The problem is that many can
see it this way in personal terms
but not in institutional terms.
Some would say they can be loyal
to themselves—their individual
consciences, apparently, being
relatively clear-but not so easily
loyal to a university like Stanford
which, they would aver, is too
much on the side of inhumanity
(defense contracts, alliance with
an imperialistic establishment
engaged in genocidal war, etc.). At
this point they sought to consider
the following parallel: in the case
of the hitch-hiker, imagining
yourself as the driver, it is possible
that you are not entirely devoid
of general human guilt (you may
be overpaid, an inconsiderate
husband, or worse) which you are
carrying in yourself like an
indigestion, and that the
hitch-hiker is an underprivileged,
politically-motivated desperado.
Wheel Grabbing
Do you assume the world will
be a better place if he succeeds in
grabbing the wheel from you? In
the case of the institution a
similar judgment must be made,
What kind of university would
Stanford be with Franklin and his
friends at the helm instead of
Lyman and the trustees? Or, by
extension, with similar changes in
the nation, would evil diminish
enough to make the inevitable
sacrifices worthwhile? Here we
ought to remember all we have
learned about the terror which
followed the French Revolution
(for example, from some
remarkable pages of Vigny's
Stello), the slaughter of six
million kulaks after the Russian
Revolution and the overall
Stalinist nightmare. Not that life
under the old regimes was other
than guilt-ridden, dispeptic. But
even Rousseau began flinching
when he realized what the
upheaval was going to mean to

him and to kindred spirits like the
martyred poet, Andre Chenier. In
the end, as his late writings reveal,
he whould have chosen his
talented and bourgeois-guilty self
against a less talented and morally
less imaginative People manning
the guillotines.
Not an altogether pretty
picture either way. But at this
level we have no easy choices,
only agonizing ones. To make
them, it is necessary to know
roughly the givens of the world
and, within it, who you are. There
are many plumping or voting to
keep Franklin who, without the
slightest doubt, would be among
the first to shy from the all-out
revolution which he openly hopes
to lead. They obviously have not
confronted their civilized ideals
with the stark reality which would
be sure to follow. This is what is
meant by self-deception or bad
faith.
Sign To World
Despite the foregoing
considerations, many of us
wondered whether it would not
be better to keep Franklin as a
sign to the world that we were
strong enough to tolerate even
this extreme of dissent; we would
profit by his vigorous challenge,
intellectually and spiritually. He
would serve as a sort of safety
valve; rebellious, agressive energies
would be let out, relatively
harmlessly, through the
vociferations and deeds of himself
and his followers. If he were to
depart, others would be sure to
take his place and with an
aggravated impulse.
Some admirably scrupulous
professors with long memories
have expressed the concern that
our example may spread and lead
to farther repression here and on
other campuses. This concern
undoubtedly added to the agony
of the decision. But it had to be
made. You do the best you can,
given the aforementioned
metaphysical and human
limitaions, thinking the matter
through and observing patiently
the Anglo-Saxon rules of due
process which guarantee a
maximum of fair play under the
fatal circumstances. If others
misinterpret your acts, there is
little you can do aout that; such
are the complexities and perverse
ironies of this world's affairs. If
we allowed ourselves to be
inhibited, beyond a certain point,
by the possible misconstructing
of others, we would be simply
paralyzed and never act at all.
No Fears
Despite the feats expressed by
the members of the Board of
Trustees, nothing has happened
which could prevent or discourage
anyone on the faculty from
presenting dissenting views, even
the politically-most-extreme ones.
There is not the slightest doubt
that the columns of the Daily will
soon bear this out.
One of the more unfortunate
aspects of the Franklin affair is
that, by emphasizing a Marxist

perspective of revolution, it has
befogged, and diverted out
attention from the deepest
problems confronting America
and the University. Seldom has
anything been as clear as the fact
that the objective conditions for
an authentic revolution do not
exist in this country for the
foreseeable future. It is equally
clear that the nation is in
profound trouble.
Our rapidly growing
insolvency, our diminished
competitive posture in the area of
world trade, the deterioration in
concrete human relations and the
crumbling of the cities, all this is
but the tip of an iceberg.
Underneath we are spiritually sick
"unto death", hollow men. A
Marxist like Marcuse will
continue, of course, to utter the
tired old shibboleths of "capitalist
alienation" and the like. These
formulas are almost endearing,
cosily familiar, in the face of the
sober reality, which is far less
susceptible to outer action, far
more alarming.
Fists, Fingers
Neither Jesus nor Marx? The
Marxists offer a clenched first, the
Christians an uplifted finger; this
is finer, more intimate. Fists are
of little avail in a struggle against
fate; an annunciatory finger, or a
taper, whose light can reach far
into the night, is more promising.
Belief, as Jung held, is
absolutely necessary to psychic
health. It alone can restore
balance to the inner person, offset
the compulsive Faustian drive to
self-assertion which began,
metaphorically speaking, with
Adam's biting the apple; or, father
back, in the apple itself or in
anything which, by
crystallization, proudly rose above
flat inertness. The primary
condition of human striving is an
attempt to wrest and preserve
order from chaos through
constructs which—being partly
impelled by a death
instinct—always become in time
dead forms. The maker, man, at
this point may stubbornly cling to
a hollow shell or he may,
providentially, suffer a living
death, a profound humiliation
leading to spiritual rebirth and
new creativity. Trust in this
anguishing process whreby life
renews itself is called faith. It may
be identified with the meaning of
the self-denying and
self-surpassing ego in Frankel's
"logotherapy".
It may also, for practical
purposes, be called love. Deep
authentic love of a vocation, of a
person, a community, a
God—either we find our way back
to these wellsprings of existence
or our civilization will continue to
decline.
A few students—perhaps even
in the humanities—might
conceivably take the time from
more prssing and important
matters to consider this
perspective.

picture either way. But at this
level we have no easy choices,
only agonizing ones. To make
them, it is necessary to know
roughly the givens of the world
and, within it, who you are. There
are many plumping or voting to
keep Franklin who, without the
slightest doubt, would be among
the first to shy from the all-out
revolution which he openly hopes
to lead. They obviously have not
confronted their civilized ideals
with the stark reality which would
be sure to follow. This is what is
meant by self-deception or bad
faith.
Sign To World
Despite the foregoing
considerations, many of us
wondered whether it would not
be better to keep Franklin as a
sign to the world that we were
strong enough to tolerate even
this extreme of dissent; we would
profit by his vigorous challenge,
intellectually and spiritually. He
would serve as a sort of safety
valve; rebellious, agressive energies
would be let out, relatively
harmlessly, through the
vociferations and deeds of himself
and his followers. If he were to
depart, others would be sure to
take his place and with an
aggravated impulse.
Some admirably scrupulous
professors with long memories
have expressed the concern that
our example may spread and lead
to farther repression here and on
other campuses. This concern
undoubtedly added to the agony
of the decision. But it had to be
made. You do the best you can,
given the aforementioned
metaphysical and human
limitaions, thinking the matter
through and observing patiently
the Anglo-Saxon rules of due
process which guarantee a
maximum of fair play under the
fatal circumstances. If others
misinterpret your acts, there is
little you can do aout that; such
are the complexities and perverse
ironies of this world's affairs. If
we allowed ourselves to be
inhibited, beyond a certain point,
by the possible misconstructing
of others, we would be simply
paralyzed and never act at all.
No Fears
Despite the feats expressed by
the members of the Board of
Trustees, nothing has happened
which could prevent or discourage
anyone on the faculty from
presenting dissenting views, even
the politically-most-extreme ones.
There is not the slightest doubt
that the columns of the Daily will
soon bear this out.
One of the more unfortunate
aspects of the Franklin affair is
that, by emphasizing a Marxist

perspective of revolution, it has
befogged, and diverted out
attention from the deepest
problems confronting America
and the University. Seldom has
anything been as clear as the fact
that the objective conditions for
an authentic revolution do not
exist in this country for the
foreseeable future. It is equally
clear that the nation is in
profound trouble.
Our rapidly growing
insolvency, our diminished
competitive posture in the area of
world trade, the deterioration in
concrete human relations and the
crumbling of the cities, all this is
but the tip of an iceberg.
Underneath we are spiritually sick
"unto death", hollow men. A
Marxist like Marcuse will
continue, of course, to utter the
tired old shibboleths of "capitalist
alienation" and the like. These
formulas are almost endearing,
cosily familiar, in the face of the
sober reality, which is far less
susceptible to outer action, far
more alarming.
Fists, Fingers
Neither Jesus nor Marx? The
Marxists offer a clenched first, the
Christians an uplifted finger; this
is finer, more intimate. Fists are
of little avail in a struggle against
fate; an annunciatory finger, or a
taper, whose light can reach far
into the night, is more promising.
Belief, as Jung held, is
absolutely necessary to psychic
health. It alone can restore
balance to the inner person, offset
the compulsive Faustian drive to
self-assertion which began,
metaphorically speaking, with
Adam's biting the apple; or, father
back, in the apple itself or in
anything which, by
crystallization, proudly rose above
flat inertness. The primary
condition of human striving is an
attempt to wrest and preserve
order from chaos through
constructs which—being partly
impelled by a death
instinct—always become in time
dead forms. The maker, man, at
this point may stubbornly cling to
a hollow shell or he may,
providentially, suffer a living
death, a profound humiliation
leading to spiritual rebirth and
new creativity. Trust in this
anguishing process whreby life
renews itself is called faith. It may
be identified with the meaning of
the self-denying and
self-surpassing ego in Frankel's
"logotherapy".
It may also, for practical
purposes, be called love. Deep
authentic love of a vocation, of a
person, a community, a
God—either we find our way back
to these wellsprings of existence
or our civilization will continue to
decline.
A few students—perhaps even
in the humanities—might
conceivably take the time from
more prssing and important
matters to consider this
perspective.

After all the soul-searching and
debate over the Franklin affair,
there is still considerable
confusion about the fundamental
issue. It seems a safe proposition
that there is almost no one at
Stanford who is not still torn,
when he turns his mind to the
affair by the age-old conflict
between ideals and reality. Few of
us would give up, before we
absolutely had to, our aim to be
tolerant of others' views and to be
generally civilized, peaceful and
non-coercive. For that, of course,
defines our humanity. But
implacable events occasionally
frustrate our most laudable
purposes. Of what use are
tolerance and desire for fraternity,
or at least co-existence, in the
instance of a Hitler? Or of anyone
else who is out to destroy us—in
the name of history, or universal
justice, or whatever—no matter
what we try to do? At such a
juncture, some portion or aspect
of the ideals must be
reluctantly—recognizing that our
humanity depends on the force of

that word—put into abeyance for
the sake of single survival.
Imagine someone with normal
Fellow-feeling who picks up a
hitch-hiker and who discovers en
route that the rider is carrying a
gun and is momentarily observing
the rules of polite behavior only
as a ruse: as soon as the driver's
vigilance flags, the hitch-hiker is
going to jump him and seize the
vehicle, dropping him off at the
nearest ditch. Would anyone
blame the Samaritan if he found
an opportunity to proceed
without the hitch-hiker,
particularly a lawful opportunity,
such as the assistance of a
policeman if the rider refused to
get out? Agreed, as Rousseau
observed, the law itself is a ruse in
some ultimate (non-operational)
sense, stacking the cards in favor
of those who hold for
co-existence as against those who
may be able to gain dignity only
by natural struggle, man against
man. Nonetheless, it is likely that
the driver, in a swift appraisal,
would opt for the law as a better

bet for his own survival and that
of mankind generally, and that
few of us would fault him for this
choice.
The problem is that many can
see it this way in personal terms
but not in institutional terms.
Some would say they can be loyal
to themselves—their individual
consciences, apparently, being
relatively clear-but not so easily
loyal to a university like Stanford
which, they would aver, is too
much on the side of inhumanity
(defense contracts, alliance with
an imperialistic establishment
engaged in genocidal war, etc.). At
this point they sought to consider
the following parallel: in the case
of the hitch-hiker, imagining
yourself as the driver, it is possible
that you are not entirely devoid
of general human guilt (you may
be overpaid, an inconsiderate
husband, or worse) which you are
carrying in yourself like an
indigestion, and that the
hitch-hiker is an underprivileged,
politically-motivated desperado.
Wheel Grabbing
Do you assume the world will
be a better place if he succeeds in
grabbing the wheel from you? In
the case of the institution a
similar judgment must be made,
What kind of university would
Stanford be with Franklin and his
friends at the helm instead of
Lyman and the trustees? Or, by
extension, with similar changes in
the nation, would evil diminish
enough to make the inevitable
sacrifices worthwhile? Here we
ought to remember all we have
learned about the terror which
followed the French Revolution
(for example, from some
remarkable pages of Vigny's
Stello), the slaughter of six
million kulaks after the Russian
Revolution and the overall
Stalinist nightmare. Not that life
under the old regimes was other
than guilt-ridden, dispeptic. But
even Rousseau began flinching
when he realized what the
upheaval was going to mean to

him and to kindred spirits like the
martyred poet, Andre Chenier. In
the end, as his late writings reveal,
he whould have chosen his
talented and bourgeois-guilty self
against a less talented and morally
less imaginative People manning
the guillotines.
Not an altogether pretty
picture either way. But at this
level we have no easy choices,
only agonizing ones. To make
them, it is necessary to know

a hollow shell or he may,
providentially, suffer a living
death, a profound humiliation
leading to spiritual rebirth and
new creativity. Trust in this
anguishing process whreby life
renews itself is called faith. It may
be identified with the meaning of
the self-denying and
self-surpassing ego in Frankel's
"logotherapy".
It may also, for practical
purposes, be called love. Deep
authentic love of a vocation, of a
person, a community, a
God—either we find our way back
to these wellsprings of existence
or our civilization will continue to
decline.
A few students—perhaps even
in the humanities—might
conceivably take the time from
more prssing and important
matters to consider this
perspective.

After all the soul-searching and
debate over the Franklin affair,
there is still considerable
confusion about the fundamental
issue. It seems a safe proposition
that there is almost no one at
Stanford who is not still torn,
when he turns his mind to the
affair by the age-old conflict
between ideals and reality. Few of
us would give up, before we
absolutely had to, our aim to be
tolerant of others' views and to be
generally civilized, peaceful and
non-coercive. For that, of course,
defines our humanity. But
implacable events occasionally
frustrate our most laudable
purposes. Of what use are
tolerance and desire for fraternity,
or at least co-existence, in the
instance of a Hitler? Or of anyone
else who is out to destroy us—in
the name of history, or universal
justice, or whatever—no matter
what we try to do? At such a
juncture, some portion or aspect
of the ideals must be
reluctantly—recognizing that our
humanity depends on the force of

that word—put into abeyance for
the sake of single survival.
Imagine someone with normal
Fellow-feeling who picks up a
hitch-hiker and who discovers en
route that the rider is carrying a
gun and is momentarily observing
the rules of polite behavior only
as a ruse: as soon as the driver's
vigilance flags, the hitch-hiker is
going to jump him and seize the
vehicle, dropping him off at the
nearest ditch. Would anyone
blame the Samaritan if he found
an opportunity to proceed
without the hitch-hiker,
particularly a lawful opportunity,
such as the assistance of a
policeman if the rider refused to
get out? Agreed, as Rousseau
observed, the law itself is a ruse in
some ultimate (non-operational)
sense, stacking the cards in favor
of those who hold for
co-existence as against those who
may be able to gain dignity only
by natural struggle, man against
man. Nonetheless, it is likely that
the driver, in a swift appraisal,
would opt for the law as a better

bet for his own survival and that
of mankind generally, and that
few of us would fault him for this
choice.
The problem is that many can
see it this way in personal terms
but not in institutional terms.
Some would say they can be loyal
to themselves—their individual
consciences, apparently, being
relatively clear-but not so easily
loyal to a university like Stanford
which, they would aver, is too
much on the side of inhumanity
(defense contracts, alliance with
an imperialistic establishment
engaged in genocidal war, etc.). At
this point they sought to consider
the following parallel: in the case
of the hitch-hiker, imagining
yourself as the driver, it is possible
that you are not entirely devoid
of general human guilt (you may
be overpaid, an inconsiderate
husband, or worse) which you are
carrying in yourself like an
indigestion, and that the
hitch-hiker is an underprivileged,
politically-motivated desperado.
Wheel Grabbing
Do you assume the world will
be a better place if he succeeds in
grabbing the wheel from you? In
the case of the institution a
similar judgment must be made,
What kind of university would
Stanford be with Franklin and his
friends at the helm instead of
Lyman and the trustees? Or, by
extension, with similar changes in
the nation, would evil diminish
enough to make the inevitable
sacrifices worthwhile? Here we
ought to remember all we have
learned about the terror which
followed the French Revolution
(for example, from some
remarkable pages of Vigny's
Stello), the slaughter of six
million kulaks after the Russian
Revolution and the overall
Stalinist nightmare. Not that life
under the old regimes was other
than guilt-ridden, dispeptic. But
even Rousseau began flinching
when he realized what the
upheaval was going to mean to

him and to kindred spirits like the
martyred poet, Andre Chenier. In
the end, as his late writings reveal,
he whould have chosen his
talented and bourgeois-guilty self
against a less talented and morally
less imaginative People manning
the guillotines.
Not an altogether pretty
picture either way. But at this
level we have no easy choices,
only agonizing ones. To make
them, it is necessary to know
roughly the givens of the world
and, within it, who you are. There
are many plumping or voting to
keep Franklin who, without the
slightest doubt, would be among
the first to shy from the all-out
revolution which he openly hopes
to lead. They obviously have not
confronted their civilized ideals
with the stark reality which would
be sure to follow. This is what is
meant by self-deception or bad
faith.
Sign To World
Despite the foregoing
considerations, many of us
wondered whether it would not
be better to keep Franklin as a
sign to the world that we were
strong enough to tolerate even
this extreme of dissent; we would
profit by his vigorous challenge,
intellectually and spiritually. He
would serve as a sort of safety
valve; rebellious, agressive energies
would be let out, relatively
harmlessly, through the
vociferations and deeds of himself
and his followers. If he were to
depart, others would be sure to
take his place and with an
aggravated impulse.
Some admirably scrupulous
professors with long memories
have expressed the concern that
our example may spread and lead
to farther repression here and on
other campuses. This concern
undoubtedly added to the agony
of the decision. But it had to be
made. You do the best you can,
given the aforementioned
metaphysical and human
limitaions, thinking the matter
through and observing patiently
the Anglo-Saxon rules of due
process which guarantee a
maximum of fair play under the
fatal circumstances. If others
misinterpret your acts, there is
little you can do aout that; such
are the complexities and perverse
ironies of this world's affairs. If
we allowed ourselves to be
inhibited, beyond a certain point,
by the possible misconstructing
of others, we would be simply
paralyzed and never act at all.
No Fears
Despite the feats expressed by
the members of the Board of
Trustees, nothing has happened
which could prevent or discourage
anyone on the faculty from
presenting dissenting views, even
the politically-most-extreme ones.
There is not the slightest doubt
that the columns of the Daily will
soon bear this out.
One of the more unfortunate
aspects of the Franklin affair is
that, by emphasizing a Marxist

perspective of revolution, it has
befogged, and diverted out
attention from the deepest
problems confronting America
and the University. Seldom has
anything been as clear as the fact
that the objective conditions for
an authentic revolution do not
exist in this country for the
foreseeable future. It is equally
clear that the nation is in
profound trouble.
Our rapidly growing
insolvency, our diminished
competitive posture in the area of
world trade, the deterioration in
concrete human relations and the
crumbling of the cities, all this is
but the tip of an iceberg.
Underneath we are spiritually sick
"unto death", hollow men. A
Marxist like Marcuse will
continue, of course, to utter the
tired old shibboleths of "capitalist
alienation" and the like. These
formulas are almost endearing,
cosily familiar, in the face of the
sober reality, which is far less
susceptible to outer action, far
more alarming.
Fists, Fingers
Neither Jesus nor Marx? The
Marxists offer a clenched first, the
Christians an uplifted finger; this
is finer, more intimate. Fists are
of little avail in a struggle against
fate; an annunciatory finger, or a
taper, whose light can reach far
into the night, is more promising.
Belief, as Jung held, is
absolutely necessary to psychic
health. It alone can restore
balance to the inner person, offset
the compulsive Faustian drive to
self-assertion which began,
metaphorically speaking, with
Adam's biting the apple; or, father
back, in the apple itself or in
anything which, by
crystallization, proudly rose above
flat inertness. The primary
condition of human striving is an
attempt to wrest and preserve
order from chaos through
constructs which—being partly
impelled by a death
instinct—always become in time
dead forms. The maker, man, at
this point may stubbornly cling to
a hollow shell or he may,
providentially, suffer a living
death, a profound humiliation
leading to spiritual rebirth and
new creativity. Trust in this
anguishing process whreby life
renews itself is called faith. It may
be identified with the meaning of
the self-denying and
self-surpassing ego in Frankel's

enough to make the inevitable
sacrifices worthwhile? Here we
ought to remember all we have
learned about the terror which
followed the French Revolution
(for example, from some
remarkable pages of Vigny's
Stello), the slaughter of six
million kulaks after the Russian
Revolution and the overall
Stalinist nightmare. Not that life
under the old regimes was other
than guilt-ridden, dispeptic. But
even Rousseau began flinching
when he realized what the
upheaval was going to mean to

him and to kindred spirits like the
martyred poet, Andre Chenier. In
the end, as his late writings reveal,
he whould have chosen his
talented and bourgeois-guilty self
against a less talented and morally
less imaginative People manning
the guillotines.
Not an altogether pretty
picture either way. But at this
level we have no easy choices,
only agonizing ones. To make
them, it is necessary to know
roughly the givens of the world
and, within it, who you are. There
are many plumping or voting to
keep Franklin who, without the
slightest doubt, would be among
the first to shy from the all-out
revolution which he openly hopes
to lead. They obviously have not
confronted their civilized ideals
with the stark reality which would
be sure to follow. This is what is
meant by self-deception or bad
faith.
Sign To World
Despite the foregoing
considerations, many of us
wondered whether it would not
be better to keep Franklin as a
sign to the world that we were
strong enough to tolerate even
this extreme of dissent; we would
profit by his vigorous challenge,
intellectually and spiritually. He
would serve as a sort of safety
valve; rebellious, agressive energies
would be let out, relatively
harmlessly, through the
vociferations and deeds of himself
and his followers. If he were to
depart, others would be sure to
take his place and with an
aggravated impulse.
Some admirably scrupulous
professors with long memories
have expressed the concern that
our example may spread and lead
to farther repression here and on
other campuses. This concern
undoubtedly added to the agony
of the decision. But it had to be
made. You do the best you can,
given the aforementioned
metaphysical and human
limitaions, thinking the matter
through and observing patiently
the Anglo-Saxon rules of due
process which guarantee a
maximum of fair play under the
fatal circumstances. If others
misinterpret your acts, there is
little you can do aout that; such
are the complexities and perverse
ironies of this world's affairs. If
we allowed ourselves to be
inhibited, beyond a certain point,
by the possible misconstructing
of others, we would be simply
paralyzed and never act at all.
No Fears
Despite the feats expressed by
the members of the Board of
Trustees, nothing has happened
which could prevent or discourage
anyone on the faculty from
presenting dissenting views, even
the politically-most-extreme ones.
There is not the slightest doubt
that the columns of the Daily will
soon bear this out.
One of the more unfortunate
aspects of the Franklin affair is
that, by emphasizing a Marxist

perspective of revolution, it has
befogged, and diverted out
attention from the deepest
problems confronting America
and the University. Seldom has
anything been as clear as the fact
that the objective conditions for
an authentic revolution do not
exist in this country for the
foreseeable future. It is equally
clear that the nation is in
profound trouble.
Our rapidly growing
insolvency, our diminished
competitive posture in the area of
world trade, the deterioration in
concrete human relations and the
crumbling of the cities, all this is
but the tip of an iceberg.
Underneath we are spiritually sick
"unto death", hollow men. A
Marxist like Marcuse will
continue, of course, to utter the
tired old shibboleths of "capitalist
alienation" and the like. These
formulas are almost endearing,
cosily familiar, in the face of the
sober reality, which is far less
susceptible to outer action, far
more alarming.
Fists, Fingers
Neither Jesus nor Marx? The
Marxists offer a clenched first, the
Christians an uplifted finger; this
is finer, more intimate. Fists are
of little avail in a struggle against
fate; an annunciatory finger, or a
taper, whose light can reach far
into the night, is more promising.
Belief, as Jung held, is
absolutely necessary to psychic
health. It alone can restore
balance to the inner person, offset
the compulsive Faustian drive to
self-assertion which began,
metaphorically speaking, with
Adam's biting the apple; or, father
back, in the apple itself or in
anything which, by
crystallization, proudly rose above
flat inertness. The primary
condition of human striving is an
attempt to wrest and preserve
order from chaos through
constructs which—being partly
impelled by a death
instinct—always become in time
dead forms. The maker, man, at
this point may stubbornly cling to
a hollow shell or he may,
providentially, suffer a living
death, a profound humiliation
leading to spiritual rebirth and
new creativity. Trust in this
anguishing process whreby life
renews itself is called faith. It may
be identified with the meaning of
the self-denying and
self-surpassing ego in Frankel's
"logotherapy".
It may also, for practical
purposes, be called love. Deep
authentic love of a vocation, of a
person, a community, a
God—either we find our way back
to these wellsprings of existence
or our civilization will continue to
decline.
A few students—perhaps even
in the humanities—might
conceivably take the time from
more prssing and important
matters to consider this
perspective.

After all the soul-searching and
debate over the Franklin affair,
there is still considerable
confusion about the fundamental
issue. It seems a safe proposition
that there is almost no one at
Stanford who is not still torn,
when he turns his mind to the
affair by the age-old conflict
between ideals and reality. Few of
us would give up, before we
absolutely had to, our aim to be
tolerant of others' views and to be
generally civilized, peaceful and
non-coercive. For that, of course,
defines our humanity. But
implacable events occasionally
frustrate our most laudable
purposes. Of what use are
tolerance and desire for fraternity,
or at least co-existence, in the
instance of a Hitler? Or of anyone
else who is out to destroy us—in
the name of history, or universal
justice, or whatever—no matter
what we try to do? At such a
juncture, some portion or aspect
of the ideals must be
reluctantly—recognizing that our
humanity depends on the force of

that word—put into abeyance for
the sake of single survival.
Imagine someone with normal
Fellow-feeling who picks up a
hitch-hiker and who discovers en
route that the rider is carrying a
gun and is momentarily observing
the rules of polite behavior only
as a ruse: as soon as the driver's
vigilance flags, the hitch-hiker is
going to jump him and seize the
vehicle, dropping him off at the
nearest ditch. Would anyone
blame the Samaritan if he found
an opportunity to proceed
without the hitch-hiker,
particularly a lawful opportunity,
such as the assistance of a
policeman if the rider refused to
get out? Agreed, as Rousseau
observed, the law itself is a ruse in
some ultimate (non-operational)
sense, stacking the cards in favor
of those who hold for
co-existence as against those who
may be able to gain dignity only
by natural struggle, man against
man. Nonetheless, it is likely that
the driver, in a swift appraisal,
would opt for the law as a better

bet for his own survival and that
of mankind generally, and that
few of us would fault him for this
choice.
The problem is that many can
see it this way in personal terms
but not in institutional terms.
Some would say they can be loyal
to themselves—their individual
consciences, apparently, being
relatively clear-but not so easily
loyal to a university like Stanford
which, they would aver, is too
much on the side of inhumanity
(defense contracts, alliance with
an imperialistic establishment
engaged in genocidal war, etc.). At
this point they sought to consider
the following parallel: in the case
of the hitch-hiker, imagining
yourself as the driver, it is possible
that you are not entirely devoid
of general human guilt (you may
be overpaid, an inconsiderate
husband, or worse) which you are
carrying in yourself like an
indigestion, and that the
hitch-hiker is an underprivileged,
politically-motivated desperado.
Wheel Grabbing
Do you assume the world will
be a better place if he succeeds in
grabbing the wheel from you? In
the case of the institution a
similar judgment must be made,
What kind of university would
Stanford be with Franklin and his
friends at the helm instead of
Lyman and the trustees? Or, by
extension, with similar changes in
the nation, would evil diminish
enough to make the inevitable
sacrifices worthwhile? Here we
ought to remember all we have
learned about the terror which
followed the French Revolution

is finer, more intimate. Fists are
of little avail in a struggle against
fate; an annunciatory finger, or a
taper, whose light can reach far
into the night, is more promising.
Belief, as Jung held, is
absolutely necessary to psychic
health. It alone can restore
balance to the inner person, offset
the compulsive Faustian drive to
self-assertion which began,
metaphorically speaking, with
Adam's biting the apple; or, father
back, in the apple itself or in
anything which, by
crystallization, proudly rose above
flat inertness. The primary
condition of human striving is an
attempt to wrest and preserve
order from chaos through
constructs which—being partly
impelled by a death
instinct—always become in time
dead forms. The maker, man, at
this point may stubbornly cling to
a hollow shell or he may,
providentially, suffer a living
death, a profound humiliation
leading to spiritual rebirth and
new creativity. Trust in this
anguishing process whreby life
renews itself is called faith. It may
be identified with the meaning of
the self-denying and
self-surpassing ego in Frankel's
"logotherapy".
It may also, for practical
purposes, be called love. Deep
authentic love of a vocation, of a
person, a community, a
God—either we find our way back
to these wellsprings of existence
or our civilization will continue to
decline.
A few students—perhaps even
in the humanities—might
conceivably take the time from
more prssing and important
matters to consider this
perspective.
