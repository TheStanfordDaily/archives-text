# Job Recruitment Stopped, Old Union Sit-In Dissipates
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
About 80 demonstrators occupied
the Placement Center and interfered
with interviews for almost two hours
yesterday, leaving only when
threatened with arrest by Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Lieutenant Don
Tamm.
The demonstrators entered the
placement building after a half hour
long rally at the lower end of White
Plaza, attended by about 110 people.
Also yesterday, students protesting
the dismissal of English Professor H.
Bruce Franklin occupied the Old
Union for several hours.
However, the group, which never
numbered above 80, did not interfere
with the operation of the student
services center, and left shortly before
the building's closing time without
police intervention.
At the rally, Stewart Burns of the
"People's Union" accused the Bank of
America of "social crimes," and said
that it "has become an empire in
itself." , ,
Lenny Siegel, a member of the
Young Crows, concluded by describing
the military production of
Hewlett-Packard and the political
career of its co-founder, former
Deputy Defense Secretary David
Packard, a former Stanford Trustee.
Entrance
About 70 people entered the
Placement Center at 1:05 p.m., after
hearing a speaker urge them to "try to
stop their (the three companies')
recruiting by any means necessary."
After they entered the building,
demonstrators walked to where the
interviewing cubicles are located. They
found two Hewlett-Packard recruiters,
Alan Seely and lan Band, in the area.
Seely walked to the lobby of the
building to tell the demonstrators that
the most of H P's products were
electronic components, available to
anyone, without regard to their
military or civilian status. Meanwhile,
Band leaned against the doorframe of
his cubicle and argued with the
protesters.
Band and Seely continued to talk
to demonstrators for about a half an
hour, but at about 1:40 p.m. Band
attempted to begin a private interview
with Kim Hongjin in interviewing
room I.
Interference
Several people refused to leave the
room and interfered with the interview
by taking a partially completed
application form from Hongjin and
ripping it, grabbing Band's pen, and
ripping papers Band had placed on a
table.
At about 1:50 p.m., Seely
attempted to begin an interview with
student Bob Gibson, but
demonstrators again interfered, and
both Gibson and Seely eventually
became embroiled in protracted
arguments about several issues.
After observing what they
described as "disruptions," Keller,
Assistant to the President John
Schwartz, and Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington conferred briefly,
and then telephoned Lieutenant
Tamm in San Jose, asking him to come
to the Placement Center and oust the
demonstrators.

Before Tamm arrived, Schwartz
became involved in a heated argument
with Don Lee, a Venceremos member,
in the corridor outside Seely's
interviewing room. Schwartz then
pushed his way past Lee into the
room, followed by several people who
obscured the administrator's view of
the activities in the room.
Tamm, visibly angered, arrived at
2:40 p.m., conferred with University
officials, and then instructed
Herrington to close the building and
order everyone except employees to
leave.
As he was showered with paper
airplanes, Tamm then ordered the
demonstrators to leave, threatening
anyone who remained or was
identified with arrest. The protesters,
chanting, left through the front door.
After the demonstration, Band
reported that his briefcase, valued at
about $30, had been stolen while
demonstrators crowded around him.
He said it had contained the results of
five morning interviews he had
conducted.
The group gathered in the Old
Union yesterday at about 3:15 p.m.
for a meeting of English 190,
"Literature and Revolution," which is
officially taught by graduate student
Merle Rabine, but which had devoted
several classes to lectures by Franklin.
Yesterday, Rabine led the class in a
discussion, with Franklin taking a
substantial part.
University lawyers apparently agree
that Franklin is no longer barred from
campus by a court injunction obtained
last year.
"We have no intention of bringing
charges against Professor Franklin
merely because of his presence on
campus," administration lawyer James
Siena said yesterday.
Although the administration
considers it legal for Franklin to come
on campus, Siena added that the
district attorney could bring charges of
his own.
"I don't know whether he reads the

injunction as we do or not," Siena
said.
After Franklin departed from the
Old Union, the demonstrators, about
60 strong, discussed whether or not
they should stay after the 5 p.m.
closing time in an attempt to provoke
another police response.
One demonstrator, citing the
diminished numbers and the lack of
organization, said that staying would
be "a ridiculous tactic . . . we're sick
of bullshit actions."
At 4:58 p.m., just two minutes
before closing, the group linked arms,
shouted "Surprise!" to departing
office workers and Stanford police
photographer Nick Bruno, and
marched out the west entrance to the
building.
