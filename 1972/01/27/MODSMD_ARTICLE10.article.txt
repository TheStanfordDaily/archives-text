## Thoughts On Mao's Thoughts 
### 
solidarity group

Editor's note: The following
articlc is abridged from one
published in November 1969 by
the "Solidarity group," a British
revolutionary group which favors
communism based upon workers'
councils, rather than communism
based upon the rule of a vanguard
political party. References are to
Quotations from Chairman Mao
Tsetung, second ed. (Peking,
1967).
Somehow the notion seems to
have got about that the
"Thoughts of Chairman Mao" are
of a hostile and abrasive turn,
bristling with novel and abhorrent
doctrine. But this is quite to
misinterpret the work of this, in
the best sense, conservative
thinker; in whose writings the
traces can everywhere be seen of
his life-long hobby of composing
mottoes for fortune cookies and
Christmas crackers.
Thus surely manv of us would
agree with his assertion that "It is
not hard for one to do a bit of
good. What is hard is to do good
all one's life and never do
anything bad"; nor is he, one
hopes, alone when he says"I
believe we should do things
honestly, for without an honest
attitude it is absolutely impossible
to accomplish anything in this
world," a remark doubly
interesting in view of the attempts
of some writers to deny that
Chairman Mao acknowledges the
existence of another world.
Victorian Morality
A salutary breeze of Victorian
morality blows, in fact, through
the whole of his Little Red Book.
On page 187 we read "The
principle of diligence and frugality
should be observed in
everything", while the praise of
unselfishness and hard work,
refreshing in these "sophisticated"
times, chimes like a peal of bells
in a passage like this:
"Hard work is like a load
placed before us, challenging us to
shoulder it. Some loads are light,
some heavy. Some people prefer
the light to the heavy; they pick
the light and shove the heavy on
to others. That is not a good
attitude.
"Some comrades are different;
they leave ease and comfort to
others, and take the heavy loads
themselves; they are the first to
bear hardships, the last to enjoy
comforts. They are good
comrades."
Cheerfulness, too, is
inculcated: "In times of difficulty
we must not lose sight of our
achievements, must see the bright
future, and must pluck up our
courage", and "Ideas of
stagnation, pessimism, inertia and
complacency are all wrong."

So they are! We answer, from a
full heart: so thev are! Although
(perhaps from exigencies of space)
there appears no explicit reference
to whistling in times of stress, a
passage on page 87 shows where
we should find Chairman Mao,
were he in Washington, D.C.: "In
short, we must be prepared."
All the physical fitness buffs
are sure to be the first to greet the
spirit behind the Chairman's
swims in the Yangtse.
And every grandmother will
approve of the great importance
which he attaches to cleanliness:
"Dust will accumualte if a room is
not cleaned regularly; our faces
will get dirty if they are not
washed regularly, our comrades'
minds and our Party's work may
also collect dust, and also need
sweeping and washing."
Wholehearted Devotion
We cannot do better, to sum
up this trumpet call for a return
to the best standards of the past,
than to quote a passage which we
are sure will give us all rich food
for thought:
"Selfishness, slacking,
corruption, seeking the limelight
and so on, are most contemptable,
while selflessness, working with all
one's energy, wholehearted
devotion to public duty, and
quiet hard work, will command
respect."
In all this, what must move us
most is the high-hearted courage
with which he is not deterred
from uttering great truths by any
pusillanimous fear of the obvious:
in this, too, a most healthy
example to some of our clever
modern writers.
He has given his attention to
the subject—alas! still so cruelly
topical—of war: and on this
question, where it is so hard to
find anything new to say, he has
lessons for us: "All the guiding
principles of military operations
grow out of the one basic
principle: to strive to the utmost
to preserve one's own strength
and destroy that of the enemy."
How many blunders might
have been avoided, if only this
had been realized!
Combine Contradictions
Not less courageous is his
willingness, nay! his eagerness, to
combine apparently contradictory
assertions. Thus on page 66 we
road, "First I said that i;he East

wind is prevailing over the West
wind and war will not break out
and now I have added these
explanations about the situation
in casf war should break out.
Both possibilities have thus been
taken into account.
"Just as there is not a single
thing in the world without a dual
nature (this is the law of the unity
of opposites), so imperialism and
all reactionaries have a dual
nature—they are real tigers and
paper tigers at the same time."
For as he says himself,
"Marxist philosophy holds that
th e law of the unity of opposites
is the fundamental law of the
Universe."
One is reminded constantly of
Kteraclitus, sometimes of Walt
Whitman, in this area of the
Chairman's thought, while the
Red Queen (so aptly named!) in
Lewis Carroll is left, by the daring
leaps of the Chairman's mind,
absolutely nowhere.
We cannot close without
touching on a more personal note.
In these difficult days, when our
colleges are attacked so rudely by
turbulent youth, what a pillar of
strength Chairman Mao would be,
in strengthening the resolve of the
deans, and moderating the
excesses of the young! No chord
Ls more often touched, none with
a surer hand.
We quote from page 109, "Be a
pupil before you become a
teacher;" and from page 216,
"Only those who are subjective,
one-sided and superficial in their
approach to problems will smugly
issue orders or directives the
moment they arrive on the scene,
without considering the
circumstances, without viewing
things in their totality (their
history and their present state as a
whole) and without getting to the
essence of things (their nature and
the internal relations between one
thing and another). Such people
are bound to trip and fall."
As we expect, he has no
sympathy with neglect of one's
work ("Both students and
intellectuals should study hard"),
and sums up in a masterly feat of
compression the characteristics of
today's student: "what we need is
an enthusiastic but calm state of
mind and intense but orderly
work."
As for the sort of thing that

has drawn upon campuses
everywhere the great sad eyes of
the world, he disposes of the ideas
of the student militants in a
trenchant sentence: "It should be
pointed out that the source of
ultra-democracy consists in the
petty bourgeoisie's individualistic
aversion to discipline."
Persuasion, Not Compulsion
Men of goodwill, we think, will
find here their own thought, but
expressed with the force
controlled by a master. One more
from this storehouse of good
things, this time a rebuke to those
who rely on the ''sit-in" and the
harangue:
"Our comrades must
understand that ideological
remolding involves long-term,
patient and painstaking work and
they must not attempt to change
people's ideology, which has been
shaped over decades of life, by
giving a few lectures or by holding
a few meetings.
"Persuasion, not compulsion is
the only way to convince them.
Compulsion will never result in
convincing them. To try to
convince them by force simply
won't work."
Confronted with so much real
wisdom, there is of course a
temptation to be irritated at the
sage's unrelenting caution; and
one hot-headed young liberal
responded with annoyance when I
quoted to him from page 216, "In
this world things are complicated
and are decided by many factors.
We should look at problems from
different aspects, not from just
one."
Yet how true it is! Such
maxims, proved over the centuries
are disregarded at our peril. For
the battle which Chairman Mao is
waging, and to which he calls us
all, is surely that which St. Paul
spoke of, against "spirtual
wickedness"; and our good wishes
must go with him as he rides
forth, resolved, in his own words.
"All ghosts and monsters must
be subjected to criticism; in no
circumstances should they be
allowed to spread unchecked,"
and confident that "Monsters of
all kinds shall be destroyed."
Amen. Comrade, Amen!

is the fundamental law of the
Universe."
One is reminded constantly of
Kteraclitus, sometimes of Walt
Whitman, in this area of the
Chairman's thought, while the
Red Queen (so aptly named!) in
Lewis Carroll is left, by the daring
leaps of the Chairman's mind,
absolutely nowhere.
We cannot close without
touching on a more personal note.
In these difficult days, when our
colleges are attacked so rudely by
turbulent youth, what a pillar of
strength Chairman Mao would be,
in strengthening the resolve of the
deans, and moderating the
excesses of the young! No chord
Ls more often touched, none with
a surer hand.
We quote from page 109, "Be a
pupil before you become a
teacher;" and from page 216,
"Only those who are subjective,
one-sided and superficial in their
approach to problems will smugly
issue orders or directives the
moment they arrive on the scene,
without considering the
circumstances, without viewing
things in their totality (their
history and their present state as a
whole) and without getting to the
essence of things (their nature and
the internal relations between one
thing and another). Such people
are bound to trip and fall."
As we expect, he has no
sympathy with neglect of one's
work ("Both students and
intellectuals should study hard"),
and sums up in a masterly feat of
compression the characteristics of
today's student: "what we need is
an enthusiastic but calm state of
mind and intense but orderly
work."
As for the sort of thing that

has drawn upon campuses
everywhere the great sad eyes of
the world, he disposes of the ideas
of the student militants in a
trenchant sentence: "It should be
pointed out that the source of
ultra-democracy consists in the
petty bourgeoisie's individualistic
aversion to discipline."
Persuasion, Not Compulsion
Men of goodwill, we think, will
find here their own thought, but
expressed with the force
controlled by a master. One more
from this storehouse of good
things, this time a rebuke to those
who rely on the ''sit-in" and the
harangue:
"Our comrades must
understand that ideological
remolding involves long-term,
patient and painstaking work and
they must not attempt to change
people's ideology, which has been
shaped over decades of life, by
giving a few lectures or by holding
a few meetings.
"Persuasion, not compulsion is
the only way to convince them.
Compulsion will never result in
convincing them. To try to
convince them by force simply
won't work."
Confronted with so much real
wisdom, there is of course a
temptation to be irritated at the
sage's unrelenting caution; and
one hot-headed young liberal
responded with annoyance when I
quoted to him from page 216, "In
this world things are complicated
and are decided by many factors.
We should look at problems from
different aspects, not from just
one."
Yet how true it is! Such
maxims, proved over the centuries
are disregarded at our peril. For
the battle which Chairman Mao is
waging, and to which he calls us
all, is surely that which St. Paul
spoke of, against "spirtual
wickedness"; and our good wishes
must go with him as he rides
forth, resolved, in his own words.
"All ghosts and monsters must
be subjected to criticism; in no
circumstances should they be
allowed to spread unchecked,"
and confident that "Monsters of
all kinds shall be destroyed."
Amen. Comrade, Amen!
solidarity group

Editor's note: The following
articlc is abridged from one
published in November 1969 by
the "Solidarity group," a British
revolutionary group which favors
communism based upon workers'
councils, rather than communism
based upon the rule of a vanguard
political party. References are to
Quotations from Chairman Mao
Tsetung, second ed. (Peking,
1967).
Somehow the notion seems to
have got about that the
"Thoughts of Chairman Mao" are
of a hostile and abrasive turn,
bristling with novel and abhorrent
doctrine. But this is quite to
misinterpret the work of this, in
the best sense, conservative
thinker; in whose writings the
traces can everywhere be seen of
his life-long hobby of composing
mottoes for fortune cookies and
Christmas crackers.
Thus surely manv of us would
agree with his assertion that "It is
not hard for one to do a bit of
good. What is hard is to do good
all one's life and never do
anything bad"; nor is he, one
hopes, alone when he says"I
believe we should do things
honestly, for without an honest
attitude it is absolutely impossible
to accomplish anything in this
world," a remark doubly
interesting in view of the attempts
of some writers to deny that
Chairman Mao acknowledges the
existence of another world.
Victorian Morality
A salutary breeze of Victorian
morality blows, in fact, through
the whole of his Little Red Book.
On page 187 we read "The
principle of diligence and frugality
should be observed in
everything", while the praise of
unselfishness and hard work,
refreshing in these "sophisticated"
times, chimes like a peal of bells
in a passage like this:
"Hard work is like a load
placed before us, challenging us to
shoulder it. Some loads are light,
some heavy. Some people prefer
the light to the heavy; they pick
the light and shove the heavy on
to others. That is not a good
attitude.
"Some comrades are different;
they leave ease and comfort to
others, and take the heavy loads
themselves; they are the first to
bear hardships, the last to enjoy
comforts. They are good
comrades."
Cheerfulness, too, is
inculcated: "In times of difficulty
we must not lose sight of our
achievements, must see the bright
future, and must pluck up our
courage", and "Ideas of
stagnation, pessimism, inertia and
complacency are all wrong."

So they are! We answer, from a
full heart: so thev are! Although
(perhaps from exigencies of space)
there appears no explicit reference
to whistling in times of stress, a
passage on page 87 shows where
we should find Chairman Mao,
were he in Washington, D.C.: "In
short, we must be prepared."
All the physical fitness buffs
are sure to be the first to greet the
spirit behind the Chairman's
swims in the Yangtse.
And every grandmother will
approve of the great importance
which he attaches to cleanliness:
"Dust will accumualte if a room is
not cleaned regularly; our faces
will get dirty if they are not
washed regularly, our comrades'
minds and our Party's work may
also collect dust, and also need
sweeping and washing."
Wholehearted Devotion
We cannot do better, to sum
up this trumpet call for a return
to the best standards of the past,
than to quote a passage which we
are sure will give us all rich food
for thought:
"Selfishness, slacking,
corruption, seeking the limelight
and so on, are most contemptable,
while selflessness, working with all
one's energy, wholehearted
devotion to public duty, and
quiet hard work, will command
respect."
In all this, what must move us
most is the high-hearted courage
with which he is not deterred
from uttering great truths by any
pusillanimous fear of the obvious:
in this, too, a most healthy
example to some of our clever
modern writers.
He has given his attention to
the subject—alas! still so cruelly
topical—of war: and on this
question, where it is so hard to
find anything new to say, he has
lessons for us: "All the guiding
principles of military operations
grow out of the one basic
principle: to strive to the utmost
to preserve one's own strength
and destroy that of the enemy."
How many blunders might
have been avoided, if only this
had been realized!
Combine Contradictions
Not less courageous is his
willingness, nay! his eagerness, to
combine apparently contradictory
assertions. Thus on page 66 we
road, "First I said that i;he East

wind is prevailing over the West
wind and war will not break out
and now I have added these
explanations about the situation
in casf war should break out.
Both possibilities have thus been
taken into account.
"Just as there is not a single
thing in the world without a dual
nature (this is the law of the unity
of opposites), so imperialism and
all reactionaries have a dual
nature—they are real tigers and
paper tigers at the same time."
For as he says himself,
"Marxist philosophy holds that
th e law of the unity of opposites
is the fundamental law of the
Universe."
One is reminded constantly of
Kteraclitus, sometimes of Walt
Whitman, in this area of the
Chairman's thought, while the
Red Queen (so aptly named!) in
Lewis Carroll is left, by the daring
leaps of the Chairman's mind,
absolutely nowhere.
We cannot close without
touching on a more personal note.
In these difficult days, when our
colleges are attacked so rudely by
turbulent youth, what a pillar of

Ls more often touched, none with

times, chimes like a peal of bells
in a passage like this:
"Hard work is like a load
placed before us, challenging us to
shoulder it. Some loads are light,
some heavy. Some people prefer
the light to the heavy; they pick
the light and shove the heavy on
to others. That is not a good
attitude.
"Some comrades are different;
they leave ease and comfort to
others, and take the heavy loads
themselves; they are the first to
bear hardships, the last to enjoy
comforts. They are good
comrades."
Cheerfulness, too, is
inculcated: "In times of difficulty
we must not lose sight of our
achievements, must see the bright
future, and must pluck up our
courage", and "Ideas of
stagnation, pessimism, inertia and
complacency are all wrong."

So they are! We answer, from a
full heart: so thev are! Although
(perhaps from exigencies of space)
there appears no explicit reference
to whistling in times of stress, a
passage on page 87 shows where
we should find Chairman Mao,
were he in Washington, D.C.: "In
short, we must be prepared."
All the physical fitness buffs
are sure to be the first to greet the
spirit behind the Chairman's
swims in the Yangtse.
And every grandmother will
approve of the great importance
which he attaches to cleanliness:
"Dust will accumualte if a room is
not cleaned regularly; our faces
will get dirty if they are not
washed regularly, our comrades'
minds and our Party's work may
also collect dust, and also need
sweeping and washing."
Wholehearted Devotion
We cannot do better, to sum
up this trumpet call for a return
to the best standards of the past,
than to quote a passage which we
are sure will give us all rich food
for thought:
"Selfishness, slacking,
corruption, seeking the limelight
and so on, are most contemptable,
while selflessness, working with all
one's energy, wholehearted
devotion to public duty, and
quiet hard work, will command
respect."
In all this, what must move us
most is the high-hearted courage
with which he is not deterred
from uttering great truths by any
pusillanimous fear of the obvious:
in this, too, a most healthy
example to some of our clever
modern writers.
He has given his attention to
the subject—alas! still so cruelly
topical—of war: and on this
question, where it is so hard to
find anything new to say, he has
lessons for us: "All the guiding
principles of military operations
grow out of the one basic
principle: to strive to the utmost
to preserve one's own strength
and destroy that of the enemy."
How many blunders might
have been avoided, if only this
had been realized!
Combine Contradictions
Not less courageous is his
willingness, nay! his eagerness, to
combine apparently contradictory
assertions. Thus on page 66 we
road, "First I said that i;he East

wind is prevailing over the West
wind and war will not break out
and now I have added these
explanations about the situation
in casf war should break out.
Both possibilities have thus been
taken into account.
"Just as there is not a single
thing in the world without a dual
nature (this is the law of the unity
of opposites), so imperialism and
all reactionaries have a dual
nature—they are real tigers and
paper tigers at the same time."
For as he says himself,
"Marxist philosophy holds that
th e law of the unity of opposites
is the fundamental law of the
Universe."
One is reminded constantly of
Kteraclitus, sometimes of Walt
Whitman, in this area of the
Chairman's thought, while the
Red Queen (so aptly named!) in
Lewis Carroll is left, by the daring
leaps of the Chairman's mind,
absolutely nowhere.
We cannot close without
touching on a more personal note.
In these difficult days, when our
colleges are attacked so rudely by
turbulent youth, what a pillar of
strength Chairman Mao would be,
in strengthening the resolve of the
deans, and moderating the
excesses of the young! No chord
Ls more often touched, none with
a surer hand.
We quote from page 109, "Be a
pupil before you become a
teacher;" and from page 216,
"Only those who are subjective,
one-sided and superficial in their
approach to problems will smugly
issue orders or directives the
moment they arrive on the scene,
without considering the
circumstances, without viewing
things in their totality (their
history and their present state as a
whole) and without getting to the
essence of things (their nature and
the internal relations between one
thing and another). Such people
are bound to trip and fall."
As we expect, he has no
sympathy with neglect of one's
work ("Both students and
intellectuals should study hard"),
and sums up in a masterly feat of
compression the characteristics of
today's student: "what we need is
an enthusiastic but calm state of
mind and intense but orderly
work."
As for the sort of thing that

has drawn upon campuses
everywhere the great sad eyes of
the world, he disposes of the ideas
of the student militants in a
trenchant sentence: "It should be
pointed out that the source of
ultra-democracy consists in the
petty bourgeoisie's individualistic
aversion to discipline."
Persuasion, Not Compulsion
Men of goodwill, we think, will
find here their own thought, but
expressed with the force
controlled by a master. One more
from this storehouse of good
things, this time a rebuke to those
who rely on the ''sit-in" and the
harangue:
"Our comrades must
understand that ideological
remolding involves long-term,
patient and painstaking work and
they must not attempt to change
people's ideology, which has been
shaped over decades of life, by
giving a few lectures or by holding
a few meetings.
"Persuasion, not compulsion is
the only way to convince them.
Compulsion will never result in
convincing them. To try to
convince them by force simply
won't work."
Confronted with so much real
wisdom, there is of course a
temptation to be irritated at the
sage's unrelenting caution; and
one hot-headed young liberal
responded with annoyance when I
quoted to him from page 216, "In
this world things are complicated
and are decided by many factors.
We should look at problems from
different aspects, not from just
one."
Yet how true it is! Such
maxims, proved over the centuries
are disregarded at our peril. For
the battle which Chairman Mao is
waging, and to which he calls us
all, is surely that which St. Paul
spoke of, against "spirtual
wickedness"; and our good wishes
must go with him as he rides
forth, resolved, in his own words.
"All ghosts and monsters must
be subjected to criticism; in no
circumstances should they be
allowed to spread unchecked,"
and confident that "Monsters of
all kinds shall be destroyed."
Amen. Comrade, Amen!
solidarity group

Editor's note: The following
articlc is abridged from one
published in November 1969 by
the "Solidarity group," a British
revolutionary group which favors
communism based upon workers'
councils, rather than communism
based upon the rule of a vanguard
political party. References are to
Quotations from Chairman Mao
Tsetung, second ed. (Peking,
1967).
Somehow the notion seems to
have got about that the
"Thoughts of Chairman Mao" are
of a hostile and abrasive turn,
bristling with novel and abhorrent
doctrine. But this is quite to
misinterpret the work of this, in
the best sense, conservative
thinker; in whose writings the
traces can everywhere be seen of
his life-long hobby of composing
mottoes for fortune cookies and
Christmas crackers.
Thus surely manv of us would
agree with his assertion that "It is
not hard for one to do a bit of
good. What is hard is to do good
all one's life and never do
anything bad"; nor is he, one
hopes, alone when he says"I
believe we should do things
honestly, for without an honest
attitude it is absolutely impossible
to accomplish anything in this
world," a remark doubly
interesting in view of the attempts
of some writers to deny that
Chairman Mao acknowledges the
existence of another world.

of the student militants in a
trenchant sentence: "It should be
pointed out that the source of
ultra-democracy consists in the
petty bourgeoisie's individualistic
aversion to discipline."
Persuasion, Not Compulsion
Men of goodwill, we think, will
find here their own thought, but
expressed with the force
controlled by a master. One more
from this storehouse of good
things, this time a rebuke to those
who rely on the ''sit-in" and the
harangue:
"Our comrades must
understand that ideological
remolding involves long-term,
patient and painstaking work and
they must not attempt to change
people's ideology, which has been
shaped over decades of life, by
giving a few lectures or by holding
a few meetings.
"Persuasion, not compulsion is
the only way to convince them.
Compulsion will never result in
convincing them. To try to
convince them by force simply
won't work."
Confronted with so much real
wisdom, there is of course a
temptation to be irritated at the
sage's unrelenting caution; and
one hot-headed young liberal
responded with annoyance when I
quoted to him from page 216, "In
this world things are complicated
and are decided by many factors.
We should look at problems from
different aspects, not from just
one."
Yet how true it is! Such
maxims, proved over the centuries
are disregarded at our peril. For
the battle which Chairman Mao is
waging, and to which he calls us
all, is surely that which St. Paul
spoke of, against "spirtual
wickedness"; and our good wishes
must go with him as he rides
forth, resolved, in his own words.
"All ghosts and monsters must
be subjected to criticism; in no
circumstances should they be
allowed to spread unchecked,"
and confident that "Monsters of
all kinds shall be destroyed."
Amen. Comrade, Amen!
solidarity group

Editor's note: The following
articlc is abridged from one
published in November 1969 by
the "Solidarity group," a British
revolutionary group which favors
communism based upon workers'
councils, rather than communism
based upon the rule of a vanguard
political party. References are to
Quotations from Chairman Mao
Tsetung, second ed. (Peking,
1967).
Somehow the notion seems to
have got about that the
"Thoughts of Chairman Mao" are
of a hostile and abrasive turn,
bristling with novel and abhorrent
doctrine. But this is quite to
misinterpret the work of this, in
the best sense, conservative
thinker; in whose writings the
traces can everywhere be seen of
his life-long hobby of composing
mottoes for fortune cookies and
Christmas crackers.
Thus surely manv of us would
agree with his assertion that "It is
not hard for one to do a bit of
good. What is hard is to do good
all one's life and never do
anything bad"; nor is he, one
hopes, alone when he says"I
believe we should do things
honestly, for without an honest
attitude it is absolutely impossible
to accomplish anything in this
world," a remark doubly
interesting in view of the attempts
of some writers to deny that
Chairman Mao acknowledges the
existence of another world.
Victorian Morality
A salutary breeze of Victorian
morality blows, in fact, through
the whole of his Little Red Book.
On page 187 we read "The
principle of diligence and frugality
should be observed in
everything", while the praise of
unselfishness and hard work,
refreshing in these "sophisticated"
times, chimes like a peal of bells
in a passage like this:
"Hard work is like a load
placed before us, challenging us to
shoulder it. Some loads are light,
some heavy. Some people prefer
the light to the heavy; they pick
the light and shove the heavy on
to others. That is not a good
attitude.
"Some comrades are different;
they leave ease and comfort to
others, and take the heavy loads
themselves; they are the first to
bear hardships, the last to enjoy
comforts. They are good
comrades."
Cheerfulness, too, is
inculcated: "In times of difficulty
we must not lose sight of our
achievements, must see the bright
future, and must pluck up our
courage", and "Ideas of
stagnation, pessimism, inertia and
complacency are all wrong."

So they are! We answer, from a
full heart: so thev are! Although
(perhaps from exigencies of space)
there appears no explicit reference
to whistling in times of stress, a
passage on page 87 shows where
we should find Chairman Mao,
were he in Washington, D.C.: "In
short, we must be prepared."
All the physical fitness buffs
are sure to be the first to greet the
spirit behind the Chairman's
swims in the Yangtse.
And every grandmother will
approve of the great importance
which he attaches to cleanliness:
"Dust will accumualte if a room is
not cleaned regularly; our faces
will get dirty if they are not
washed regularly, our comrades'
minds and our Party's work may
also collect dust, and also need
sweeping and washing."
Wholehearted Devotion
We cannot do better, to sum
up this trumpet call for a return
to the best standards of the past,
than to quote a passage which we
are sure will give us all rich food
for thought:
"Selfishness, slacking,
corruption, seeking the limelight
and so on, are most contemptable,
while selflessness, working with all
one's energy, wholehearted
devotion to public duty, and
quiet hard work, will command
respect."
In all this, what must move us
most is the high-hearted courage
with which he is not deterred
from uttering great truths by any
pusillanimous fear of the obvious:
in this, too, a most healthy
example to some of our clever
modern writers.
He has given his attention to
the subject—alas! still so cruelly
topical—of war: and on this
question, where it is so hard to
find anything new to say, he has
lessons for us: "All the guiding
principles of military operations
grow out of the one basic
principle: to strive to the utmost
to preserve one's own strength
and destroy that of the enemy."
How many blunders might
have been avoided, if only this
had been realized!
Combine Contradictions
Not less courageous is his
willingness, nay! his eagerness, to
combine apparently contradictory
assertions. Thus on page 66 we
road, "First I said that i;he East

wind is prevailing over the West
wind and war will not break out
and now I have added these
explanations about the situation
in casf war should break out.
Both possibilities have thus been
taken into account.
"Just as there is not a single
thing in the world without a dual
nature (this is the law of the unity
of opposites), so imperialism and
all reactionaries have a dual
nature—they are real tigers and
paper tigers at the same time."
For as he says himself,
"Marxist philosophy holds that
th e law of the unity of opposites
is the fundamental law of the
Universe."
One is reminded constantly of
Kteraclitus, sometimes of Walt
Whitman, in this area of the
Chairman's thought, while the
Red Queen (so aptly named!) in
Lewis Carroll is left, by the daring
leaps of the Chairman's mind,
absolutely nowhere.
We cannot close without
touching on a more personal note.
In these difficult days, when our
colleges are attacked so rudely by
turbulent youth, what a pillar of
strength Chairman Mao would be,
in strengthening the resolve of the
deans, and moderating the
excesses of the young! No chord
Ls more often touched, none with
a surer hand.
We quote from page 109, "Be a
pupil before you become a
teacher;" and from page 216,
"Only those who are subjective,
one-sided and superficial in their
approach to problems will smugly
issue orders or directives the
moment they arrive on the scene,
without considering the
circumstances, without viewing
things in their totality (their
history and their present state as a
whole) and without getting to the
essence of things (their nature and
the internal relations between one
thing and another). Such people
are bound to trip and fall."
As we expect, he has no
sympathy with neglect of one's
work ("Both students and
intellectuals should study hard"),
and sums up in a masterly feat of
compression the characteristics of
today's student: "what we need is
an enthusiastic but calm state of
mind and intense but orderly
work."
As for the sort of thing that

has drawn upon campuses
everywhere the great sad eyes of
the world, he disposes of the ideas
of the student militants in a
trenchant sentence: "It should be
pointed out that the source of
ultra-democracy consists in the
petty bourgeoisie's individualistic
aversion to discipline."
Persuasion, Not Compulsion
Men of goodwill, we think, will
