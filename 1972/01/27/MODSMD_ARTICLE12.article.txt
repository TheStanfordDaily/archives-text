# Taxicabs, Indians, And Slave Labor
## 
### 
Taxicab Monopoly
The October 1971 issue of the
Journal of Law & Economics, just
out, has a long, fascinating, and
detailed article on the monopoly
licensure of taxicabs in Chicago.
In the article, the authors
estimate in a clear and careful
manner that ending the monopoly
system would reduce fares by 14
per cent. They say that total
service demanded and supplied
would increase between 42 and 54
per cent, once the
Yellow-Checker-City Council
cartelization of taxicab service is
ended.
The authors estimate the value
of the monopoly created by the
licensing system at $41,085,000.
In the course of the article, the
authors tell how negotiating a
lower than posted rate (possible
before 1934) was outlawed.
An account of Yellow-Checker
owner Morris Markin's campaign
in New York City to institute
controls on entry into the Taxicab
business, parallel to a similar
campaign Markin waged in
Chicago, tells how New York City
Mayor Jimmy Walker received
taxicab company stock in
exchange for a promise to push
for a limitation on the number of
taxi licenses.
Faced with this monopoly
system, the people of Chicago
have turned to the black market.
Unlicensed gypsy cabs operate in
the poor, black areas; suburban
taxi companies infringe on the
city's outer limits; and illegal
jitneys operate along Martin
Luther King Drive.

Aboriginal Fishing Rights
According to the January 1972
issue of Civil Liberties (published
by the American Civil Liberties
Union), the Washington State
ACLU is asking the U.S. Supreme
Court to rule that Indians'
off-reservation fishing rights are
protected by an 1855 treaty. The
ACLU is seeking to overturn the
conviction (in State of
Washington v. Moses) of four
Muckleshoot Reservation Indians
for netting eight steelhead.
The Treaty of Point Elliott,
which covered ancestors of the
present-day Muckleshoots,
contained the following section
on the Indian fisheries:

mentioned their existence.
ACLU attorney William L.
Hanson makes this same point in
his essay in the American Friends
Service Committee's report on the
fishing rights question.
Uncommon Controversy:
" . .A fact given recognition
throughout federal cases (is) that
the Indians who made treaties
with the United States owned
property and rights. They gave
property in exchange for money
or benefits, and they could, in
their treaties, retain certain
property and rights.
"In this case the Indian
signatories retained the right to
fish, absolutely basic to their

Constitutional Rights Defended
The February 1972 issue of
Playboy has a personality profile
of Senator Sam Ervin (D—N.C )
written by Robert Sherrill.
Sherrill catalogues the many
battles fought by Sen. Ervin for
constitutional rights: against
Customs search indignities, against
Civil Service questionnaires that
invade privacy, against the
Subversive Activities Control
Board, against the suppression of
the Pentagon Papers, against
intimidating Selective Service
guidelines, against computerized
government surveillance, against
egalitarian misinterpretations of
the Fourteenth Amendment,
against Federal wiretapping, and
against the no-knock and
preventive detention laws.
Sherrill supplies numerous
anecdotes which provide insights
into Ervin's character. Sherrill also
points out several inconsistencies
in Ervin's record Ervin said that
the police who rounded up the
1971 May Day antiwar
demonstrators did "a rather fine
job." Ervin has refused to
investigate FBI surveillance of
political dissidents and did
support Nixon's nomination of
William Rehnquist to the Supreme
Court.
Despite these flaws, the over-all
picture which emerges is one of a
constitutional strict
constructionist and of a defender
of civil liberties.

Compulsory Arbitration
Nixon recently decided, once
again, to use governmental power
to force striking West Coast
longshoremen to go back to work.
This is in accord with the
present-day trend toward
gove rnmentally-imposed
employment contracts foisted
upon employees and employers
through compulsory arbitration.
Back in 1836, William Cullen
Bryant, the famous poet and
libertarian newspaper editor,
presented the only morally
defensible position on laws which
punish a refusal to work. Bryant
correctly identified forcing men
to work as slavery. He wrote:
"Punish by human laws a
'determination not to work,'
make it penal bv any other
penalty than idleness inflicts, and
it matters little whether the
taskmasters be one or many, an
individual or an order, the hateful
scheme of slavery will have gained
a foothold in the land."

Compulsory Arbitration
Nixon recently decided, once
again, to use governmental power
to force striking West Coast
longshoremen to go back to work.
This is in accord with the
present-day trend toward
gove rnmentally-imposed
employment contracts foisted
upon employees and employers
through compulsory arbitration.
Back in 1836, William Cullen
Bryant, the famous poet and
libertarian newspaper editor,
presented the only morally
defensible position on laws which
punish a refusal to work. Bryant
correctly identified forcing men
to work as slavery. He wrote:
"Punish by human laws a
'determination not to work,'
make it penal bv any other
penalty than idleness inflicts, and
it matters little whether the
taskmasters be one or many, an
individual or an order, the hateful
scheme of slavery will have gained
a foothold in the land."
Taxicab Monopoly
The October 1971 issue of the
Journal of Law & Economics, just
out, has a long, fascinating, and
detailed article on the monopoly
licensure of taxicabs in Chicago.
In the article, the authors
estimate in a clear and careful
manner that ending the monopoly
system would reduce fares by 14
per cent. They say that total
service demanded and supplied
would increase between 42 and 54
per cent, once the
Yellow-Checker-City Council
cartelization of taxicab service is
ended.
The authors estimate the value
of the monopoly created by the
licensing system at $41,085,000.
In the course of the article, the
authors tell how negotiating a
lower than posted rate (possible
before 1934) was outlawed.
An account of Yellow-Checker
owner Morris Markin's campaign
in New York City to institute
controls on entry into the Taxicab
business, parallel to a similar
campaign Markin waged in
Chicago, tells how New York City
Mayor Jimmy Walker received
taxicab company stock in
exchange for a promise to push
for a limitation on the number of
taxi licenses.
Faced with this monopoly
system, the people of Chicago
have turned to the black market.
Unlicensed gypsy cabs operate in
the poor, black areas; suburban
taxi companies infringe on the
city's outer limits; and illegal
jitneys operate along Martin
Luther King Drive.

Aboriginal Fishing Rights
According to the January 1972
issue of Civil Liberties (published
by the American Civil Liberties
Union), the Washington State
ACLU is asking the U.S. Supreme
Court to rule that Indians'
off-reservation fishing rights are
protected by an 1855 treaty. The
ACLU is seeking to overturn the
conviction (in State of
Washington v. Moses) of four
Muckleshoot Reservation Indians
for netting eight steelhead.
The Treaty of Point Elliott,
which covered ancestors of the
present-day Muckleshoots,
contained the following section
on the Indian fisheries:

mentioned their existence.
ACLU attorney William L.
Hanson makes this same point in
his essay in the American Friends
Service Committee's report on the
fishing rights question.

Washington v. Moses) of four
Muckleshoot Reservation Indians
for netting eight steelhead.
The Treaty of Point Elliott,
which covered ancestors of the
present-day Muckleshoots,
contained the following section
on the Indian fisheries:

mentioned their existence.
ACLU attorney William L.
Hanson makes this same point in
his essay in the American Friends
Service Committee's report on the
fishing rights question.
Uncommon Controversy:
" . .A fact given recognition
throughout federal cases (is) that
the Indians who made treaties
with the United States owned
property and rights. They gave
property in exchange for money
or benefits, and they could, in
their treaties, retain certain
property and rights.
"In this case the Indian
signatories retained the right to

Constitutional Rights Defended
The February 1972 issue of
Playboy has a personality profile
of Senator Sam Ervin (D—N.C )
written by Robert Sherrill.
Sherrill catalogues the many
battles fought by Sen. Ervin for
constitutional rights: against
Customs search indignities, against
Civil Service questionnaires that
invade privacy, against the
Subversive Activities Control
Board, against the suppression of
the Pentagon Papers, against
intimidating Selective Service
guidelines, against computerized
government surveillance, against
egalitarian misinterpretations of
the Fourteenth Amendment,
against Federal wiretapping, and
against the no-knock and
preventive detention laws.
Sherrill supplies numerous
anecdotes which provide insights
into Ervin's character. Sherrill also
points out several inconsistencies
in Ervin's record Ervin said that
the police who rounded up the
1971 May Day antiwar
demonstrators did "a rather fine
job." Ervin has refused to
investigate FBI surveillance of
political dissidents and did
support Nixon's nomination of
William Rehnquist to the Supreme
Court.
Despite these flaws, the over-all
picture which emerges is one of a
constitutional strict
constructionist and of a defender
of civil liberties.

Compulsory Arbitration
Nixon recently decided, once
again, to use governmental power
to force striking West Coast
longshoremen to go back to work.
This is in accord with the
present-day trend toward
gove rnmentally-imposed
employment contracts foisted
upon employees and employers
through compulsory arbitration.
Back in 1836, William Cullen
Bryant, the famous poet and
libertarian newspaper editor,
presented the only morally
defensible position on laws which
punish a refusal to work. Bryant
correctly identified forcing men
to work as slavery. He wrote:
"Punish by human laws a
'determination not to work,'
make it penal bv any other
penalty than idleness inflicts, and
it matters little whether the
taskmasters be one or many, an
individual or an order, the hateful
scheme of slavery will have gained
a foothold in the land."
