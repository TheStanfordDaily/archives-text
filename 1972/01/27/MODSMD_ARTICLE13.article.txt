"The right of taking fish at
usual and accustomed grounds
and stations is further secured to
said Indians in common with all
citizens of the Territory, and of
erecting temporary houses for the
purpose of curing, together with
the privilege of hunting and
gathering roots and berries on
open and unclaimed lands;
provided, however, that they shall
not take shell fish from any beds
staked or cultivated by citizens."
Citing such treaties presents
something of a problem from the
point of view of justice. First, the
treaties were forced upon the
Indians through coercion and
deception. Under the treaties, the
Indians were robbed of land
which they regularly used.
Secondly, however, we must
beware of grandiose present-day
Indian claims to the whole of
America because of the Indians'
religious affinity for the land.
Such claims are unwarranted
land-grabbing, the Indians are
simply entitled to the land they
were once using on a regular basis.
Thirdly, the existence of the
treaties should not, though it
often does, blind people to the
fact that the Indians' fishing rights
existed before their treaty with
the U.S. government. The fishing
rights were not granted by the
U.S. government. They had a
prior existence based upon the
Indians' customary appropriation
of fish from the bounty of
Nature. The rights then continued
to exist after the treaty

livelihood."
Hanson suggests that "if a tribe
owns fishing rights, it should be
able to authorize guests or
'licensees,' including non-Indians,
to fish, commercially or
otherwise."
Why has the government of the
State of Washington been trying
to take away the Indians' fishing
rights? Janet McCloud and Robert
Casey, in their article, "The Last
Indian War," in winter 1967 issue
of Left & Right, point out that
"the Washington Fisheries
Department is under the control
of the large fishing industries and
the Washington Game Department
is under the control of the large,
politically-minded sportsmen's
clubs."
State government agencies
attack the Indians directly by
stopping them from fishing and
seizing their fishing equipment
and indirectly by threatening to
suspend the business license of
any market that sells
Indian-caught fish.
The Indians have been trying
to meet this challenge at different
levels, and different groups with
different strategies for defending
the fishing rights exist. Several
groups have taken up arms. State
game wardens and other state
enforcement officers have been
put under citizen's arrest for
trespassing when they have
attempted to interfere with Indian
fishing rights.

often does, blind people to the
fact that the Indians' fishing rights
existed before their treaty with
the U.S. government. The fishing
rights were not granted by the
U.S. government. They had a
prior existence based upon the
Indians' customary appropriation
of fish from the bounty of
Nature. The rights then continued
to exist after the treaty

livelihood."
Hanson suggests that "if a tribe
owns fishing rights, it should be
able to authorize guests or
'licensees,' including non-Indians,
to fish, commercially or
otherwise."
Why has the government of the
State of Washington been trying
to take away the Indians' fishing
rights? Janet McCloud and Robert
Casey, in their article, "The Last
Indian War," in winter 1967 issue
of Left & Right, point out that
"the Washington Fisheries
Department is under the control
of the large fishing industries and
the Washington Game Department
is under the control of the large,
politically-minded sportsmen's
clubs."
State government agencies
attack the Indians directly by
stopping them from fishing and
seizing their fishing equipment
and indirectly by threatening to
suspend the business license of
any market that sells
Indian-caught fish.
The Indians have been trying
to meet this challenge at different
levels, and different groups with
different strategies for defending
the fishing rights exist. Several
groups have taken up arms. State
game wardens and other state
enforcement officers have been
put under citizen's arrest for
trespassing when they have
attempted to interfere with Indian
fishing rights.

"The right of taking fish at
usual and accustomed grounds
and stations is further secured to
said Indians in common with all
citizens of the Territory, and of
erecting temporary houses for the
purpose of curing, together with
the privilege of hunting and
gathering roots and berries on
open and unclaimed lands;
provided, however, that they shall
not take shell fish from any beds
staked or cultivated by citizens."
Citing such treaties presents
something of a problem from the
point of view of justice. First, the
treaties were forced upon the
Indians through coercion and
deception. Under the treaties, the
Indians were robbed of land
which they regularly used.
Secondly, however, we must
beware of grandiose present-day
Indian claims to the whole of
America because of the Indians'
religious affinity for the land.
Such claims are unwarranted
land-grabbing, the Indians are
simply entitled to the land they
were once using on a regular basis.
Thirdly, the existence of the
treaties should not, though it
often does, blind people to the
fact that the Indians' fishing rights
existed before their treaty with
the U.S. government. The fishing
rights were not granted by the
U.S. government. They had a
prior existence based upon the
Indians' customary appropriation
