Editor, THE DAILY:
I thought I should clarify the remarks I made
publicly at the Faculty Club "eat-in" Monday
evening.
People from the demonstration, many from
Venceremos, took more than themselves with them
when they vacated the Faculty Club dining room.
I questioned this publicly at the time, and
someone kindly explained that because the money
used to outfit the Faculty Club was acquired
through exploitation of the masses, all that we saw
before us rightfully belonged to the people.
First, let me establish my belief that the majority
of protesters reclaiming "their" merchandise did so,
not out of conscience, but so that they, too, would
have a souvenir of the momentous occasion, a
"trophy" which they could display proudly or
jokingly at the right place and the right time.
Secondly, very few Stanford students or
non-student protesters can boast of a lower class
destituion meriting the necessity of these acts; let us
also be honest about the extent of our poverty. I
also failed to see anyone attempting to share and
redistribute these "reclaimed" goods among all the
"people."
Thirdly, and most importantly, not morality, but
the fact that the move was "bad tactics"; it is
precisely the kind of incident that gets emphasized
and twisted by the press and leaves its tell-tale
alienating mark on people's minds.
Protesters sometimes fail to fully realize the
ramifications of their actions in terms of
propaganda, that certain incidents, which are prone
to be seen out of context, can negate so many of
the good things that happen in a demonstration in

the minds of those suggestable but not devoted to
the cause.
"Ripping-off'of goods is, in fact, precisely what
any casual onlooker would expect from such a mass
occupation in a crowded room.
The secret of revolution is surprise. I truly
believe that if people had consciously refrained
from taking any item, those people both closely
affected and unaffected by the demonstration,
would have been so taken with surprise that such
action might very likely have been interpreted as a
testimony of our anti-imperialistic beliefs.
As Gandhi preached, one must often sacrifice
and refrain in order to communicate beliefs
effectively.
Finally, a short word to the rest of the Stanford
community. Do not picture these concerns as
separate from yourself. You too are the problem, for
you have caused the chaos indirectly.
The violence that some people inflict who are
deeply concerned with Stanford is based on
deep-rooted frustration and anger. Frustration
because they know that if the majority of Stanford
students cared enough to find out about the
functioning of their university and were willing to
sacrifice some of themselves towards their moral
beliefs, there would be no protests.
Anger because most Stanford students could care
less if the people who are concerned went to hell.
Bizarre happenings occur when only part of an
organism struggles to survive; in desperation and
frustration one may end up negating oneself.

Secondly, very few Stanford students or
non-student protesters can boast of a lower class
destituion meriting the necessity of these acts; let us
also be honest about the extent of our poverty. I
also failed to see anyone attempting to share and
redistribute these "reclaimed" goods among all the
"people."
Thirdly, and most importantly, not morality, but
the fact that the move was "bad tactics"; it is
precisely the kind of incident that gets emphasized
and twisted by the press and leaves its tell-tale
alienating mark on people's minds.
Protesters sometimes fail to fully realize the
ramifications of their actions in terms of
propaganda, that certain incidents, which are prone
to be seen out of context, can negate so many of
the good things that happen in a demonstration in

the minds of those suggestable but not devoted to
the cause.
"Ripping-off'of goods is, in fact, precisely what
any casual onlooker would expect from such a mass
occupation in a crowded room.
The secret of revolution is surprise. I truly
believe that if people had consciously refrained
from taking any item, those people both closely
affected and unaffected by the demonstration,
would have been so taken with surprise that such
action might very likely have been interpreted as a
testimony of our anti-imperialistic beliefs.
As Gandhi preached, one must often sacrifice
and refrain in order to communicate beliefs
effectively.
Finally, a short word to the rest of the Stanford
community. Do not picture these concerns as
separate from yourself. You too are the problem, for
you have caused the chaos indirectly.
The violence that some people inflict who are
deeply concerned with Stanford is based on
deep-rooted frustration and anger. Frustration
because they know that if the majority of Stanford
students cared enough to find out about the
functioning of their university and were willing to
sacrifice some of themselves towards their moral
beliefs, there would be no protests.
Anger because most Stanford students could care
less if the people who are concerned went to hell.
Bizarre happenings occur when only part of an
organism struggles to survive; in desperation and
frustration one may end up negating oneself.

I thought I should clarify the remarks I made
publicly at the Faculty Club "eat-in" Monday
evening.
People from the demonstration, many from
Venceremos, took more than themselves with them
when they vacated the Faculty Club dining room.
I questioned this publicly at the time, and
someone kindly explained that because the money
used to outfit the Faculty Club was acquired
through exploitation of the masses, all that we saw
before us rightfully belonged to the people.
First, let me establish my belief that the majority
of protesters reclaiming "their" merchandise did so,
not out of conscience, but so that they, too, would
have a souvenir of the momentous occasion, a
"trophy" which they could display proudly or
jokingly at the right place and the right time.
