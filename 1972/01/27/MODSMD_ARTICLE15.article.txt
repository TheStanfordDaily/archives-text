DECISION, ORDER, AND DIRECTION OE ELECTIONS
Upon petitions duly filed under Section 9(c) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, a hearing was held before Hearing Officers
Douglas H. Barton and Walter L. Kintz. Following the hearing and
pursuant to Section 102.67 of the National Labor Relations Board Rules
and Regulations, Series 8, as amended, and by direction of the Regional
Director for Region 20, this proceeding was transferred to the National
Labor Relations Board for decision. Thereafter, briefs were Filed with the
Board by the Teamsters, the Fire l ighters, the Police Officers, CSEA-SEA,
USE, and the Employer.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(b) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, the National Labor Relations Board has
delegated its authority in this proceeding to a three-member panel.
The Board has reviewed the rulings of the Hearing Officers made at
the hearing and finds that they are free from prejudicial error. They are
hereby affirmed.
*
Upon the entire record in this proceeding, the Board finds:
1. The Employer, Leland Stanford Jr. University, is a private
nonprofit institution of higher learning which was founded under a trust
agreement executed in 1885 and thereafter confirmed in the constitution
of the State of California. Its operating income for the fiscal year
ending August 31, 1969, was $150,610,560, of which approximately
$112,000,000 came from sources outside the State of California. During
this same period, it purchased goods and services valued at approximately
$48 million, and, of this sum, approximately $9 million involved
expenditures outside the State of California.
The undisputed evidence shows that the Employer meets the
jurisdictional standard for colleges and universities set forth in Section
103.1 of the Board's Rules and Regulations. Accordingly, we find that the
Employer is engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Act, and it
will effectuate the policies of the Act to assert jurisdiction herein.
2. We find that the Petitioners and Intervenors involved in this
proceeding are labor organizations seeking to represent certain employees
of the Employer.'
3. A question affecting commerce exists concerning the
representation of certain employees of the Employer within the meaning
of Sections 9(c)( 1) and 2(6) and (7) of the Act.
4. Stanford's main campus is located on the San Francisco
Peninsula about 30 miles south of San Francisco, California, and consists
of 1,150 contiguous acres that are not part of any municipality. Stanford
also uses for academic purposes a 4,000 acre site approximately 2 miles
from the main campus at which the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center is
located. The University is made up of approximately 218 academic and
nonacademic departments and major subdepartments which are under the
overall control of the University's president and five vice presidents.
Stanford employs approximately 7,000 individuals, included among which
are 1,250 faculty members, 2,000 supervisory or professional employees,
2,200 clericals, and 1,500 employees in maintenance, service, or technical
All but about 50 of these employees perform their duties
and functions at locations on the San Francisco Peninsula.
*
At issue in this proceeding are the nonsupervisory and
nonprofessional employees employed by Stanford, including employees
employed at Stanford University Press and Stanford Hospital. No party
seeks to include faculty members or professional employees of the
University in any of the proposed units. At the hearing the following unit
positions were urged by the respective parties:
(1) The Teamsters seeks a unit of all physical plant department
employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and supervisors as
defined in the Act. In the event the Board finds such a unit to be
inappropriate, the Teamsters has requested an alternative unit comprised of
all maintenance employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and
supervisors.
(2) The Fire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain.
(3) The Police Officers has requested a unit of all employees of the
Stanford University Police Department, excluding all other employees, and
supervisors as defined in the Act.
(4) CSEA-SEA seeks a unit of all employees engaged in service,
maintenance, and technical positions, excluding firemen, clerical
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(5) Machinists seeks a unit of all laboratory mechanicians., physical
science and engineering technicians, and maintenance machinists employed
at the Employer's main campus and at SLAC, excluding all other
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(6) USE seeks a unit of all nonprofessional full-time and part-time
permanent and seasonal employees of the University, including all
employees of the Stanford Press not currently represented, but excluding
all nonstudent firemen, all currently represented employees, professional
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(7) WAC contends that elections should be directed in three
separate units: (1) the unit sought by the Fire Fighters, (2) the unit sought
by the Teamsters, and (3) a residual unit of all other employees, excluding
only professional employees and supervisors.
(8) IBEW seeks a unit of all journeymen and apprentice electricians
employed by the University, excluding all other employees.
(9) UE expressed no unit position.
(10) Laborers also took no unit position but indicated its desire to
be on the ballot in any election in an overall unit or for any residual unit
from which one or more crafts have been severed.
(11) The Employer contends that two units are appropriate. One
would be a unit of all nonsupervisory, nonprofessional employees
employed by the University within the State of California, excluding
employees of Stanford Hospital, employees of Stanford University Press
who are currently represented, students, part-time and casual employees,
confidential employees, and guards. The second would be a unit of all
employees of the Stanford University Police Department, excluding all
other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act.
As the foregoing indicates, there is a considerable difference of
opinion among the parties over what constitutes the appropriate unit or
units for purposes of collective bargaining. These positions range in scope
from requests for various types of craft and departmental units to units
encompassing all nonprofessional employees employed by the University.
In such cases, it is not the Board's function to determine^ which unit or
units might be the most appropriate. Rather, the Board's role in such
circumstances is to determine which, if any, of the petitioned-for units can
be considered appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
Accordingly with these considerations in mind, we shall examine the units
requested.
*
As previously indicated, the Teamsters has requested a unit of all
physical plant department employees. The physical plant department is
one of 16 nonacademic departments which arc under the overall control of
the vice president for business affairs. The department performs a myriad
of activities, including the operation of the campus utility systems, the
maintenance of buildings, roads, and grounds, and the furnishing of
audiovisual services. The physical plant department consists of
approximately IH7 employees in 37 different job classifications. Although
the physical plant department has a central headquarters location, most of
the work is performed away from the shop. There is no common
supervision, wages, or hours of work among the employees in the physical
plant department Also many of the other university departments employ
individuals in the same job classifications as those in the physical plant
department,lo and it is not uncommon for employees in the physical plant
department to work in conjunction with employees of similar skills from
other departments. Perhaps even more significant is the fact that these
other departments perform many of the same job functions as the
employees in the physical plant department and, hence, there are only a
few categories of work assignment which are performed exclusively by the
employees in the physical plant department. Accordingly, on the basis of
the foregoing, we conclude that there is no separate identity of interest
among employees of the physical plant department from that of other
employees which would justify a finding that such a unit could be
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
The Teamsters alternative unit position covers a broader grouping of
maintenance personnel.'' While the unit in question is not precisely

defined, it is clear that it would include employees of the physical plant
department and the plant office department at SLAC, 12 pius employees
performing custodial duties at the University. The unit as described covers
employees in some 20 different departments. However, with the possible
exception of the physical plant department, the Teamsters is not seeking
all the employees in any one department. The unit purports to include all
employees performing maintenance type functions at the University, but
specifically excluded from the unit are several categories of employees
whose work is closely related to that of the unit employees. For example,
physical science and engineering technicians repair and calibrate every type
of electronic and mechanical equipment and on many occasions they work
side-by-side with other journeyman craftsmen who are part of the
proposed Teamsters maintenance unit. Also specifically excluded are the
laboratory mechanicians who possess the same basic skills as the
journeyman mechanics but specialize in the assembly, installation, and
repair of various types of laboratory equipment. Many of the job functions
performed by these laboratory support people are identical with those
performed by the journeyman craftsmen in the Finally, the
Teamsters would include employees performing custodial services, but it
would exclude the food service employees whose interests are closely allied
with those of the custodial employees. A large percentage of the custodial
employees share common supervision and have day-to-day contact with the
food service employees. Furthermore, during the summer months when
food services are reduced, approximately one-half of the food service
employees reiain employment by transferring over to custodial jobs.
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance unit
sought by the Teamsters is too limited in scope to constitute an
appropriate unit of maintenance employees.! 4 Accordingly, as neither of
the Teamsters' requested units can be found to be appropriate for purposes
of collective bargaining, we shall dismiss the petition filed in Case
20-RC-9202.
*
CSEA-SEA has petitioned for a unit of employees engaged in
service, maintenance, and technical positions. The unit as defined would
cover employees at both the main campus and SLAC and would include all
maintenance classifications, all laboratory support personnel, all food
service and custodial employees, and graphic technicians and proofreaders
at Stanford University Press.'s Specifically excluded from the unit are the
police and fire departments, each of which is being sought separately by
other Unions, a ll office clerical employees, and all library personnel, as
well as the general categories of managerial and professional employees,
guards, and all supervisors as defined in the Act. Both the Employer and
USE contend that this unit is too limited in scope and that the appropriate
unit should include all of the University's nonprofessional and
nonsupervisory employees.
There is considerable record testimony which would lend support to
a conclusion that an overall unit of nonprofessional and nonsupervisory
employees would be appropriate. For example, the University's personnel
and employment policies are for the most part standardized and most
university employees are covered by the same wage scale and program of
benefits.' 7 At the main campus, employees are centrally hired through the
University's personnel office, and, when a job opening occurs in a
particular department, employees throughout the University are permitted
to bid on the opening.
On the other hand, however, the unit being sought by CSEA-SEA is
essentially a grouping of all employees engaged in maintenance type
functions, and the Board has on several occasions held that an overall unit
of maintenance employees can be appropriate under certain
circumstances. as our previous findings indicate, the maintenance
functions at the University arc highly integrated, and there can be no
doubt that all the University's maintenance employees share a close
community of interest. There would also appear to be ample justification
for including in such a unit the various nonmaintenance classifications
sought by CSEA-SEA. Thus the custodians, although not classified as
maintenance employees by the University, are traditionally included in
maintenance-type units under existing Board policy. In the circumstances
present here, any action involving the custodians requires that the same
action be taken with respect to food service employees because of the close
community of interest and interchangeability in job functions among
employees in the two categories. The graphics and publications employees
whom CSEA-SEA would also include would most properly belong in units
covering employees at Press. However, in view of the fact that these
employees have been excluded from the existing units at Press and now
constitute a residual group which no union seeks to represent separately,

parties to this proceeding: Construction & General Laborers Union Local
270, International Hod Carriers, Building and Common Laborers Union
of America, hereinafter Laborers; United Stanford Employees, hereinafter
USE; Workers Action Caucus, hereinafter WAC; International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 332, hereinafter IBEW;

of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Local Lodge 68, AFL-CIO,
hereinafter Machinists.
®The Employer and USE each filed motions to correct the transcript. USE
also filed objections to the Employer's motion to correct the transcript.
No responses to the motions and objections have been received from any
other party to the proceeding. Accordingly, to the extent that USE and
the Employer's motions to correct the transcript are not in conflict, they
are hereby granted. In all other respects, the motions are hereby denied.
7 CSE A-SEA contends that USE and WAC are a single entity and that their
representations that they are separate organizations should disqualify
them from participating in this proceeding. CSEA-SEA also contends that
WAC does not qualify as a labor organization within the meaning of
Section 2(5) of the Act. We find no merit in these contentions. The
record evidence shows that, although WAC was at one time a subgroup
within USE, the two organizations have separated over a policy
disagreement, and USE and WAC now function as separate independent
entities. The record evidence further shows that each of these
organizations claims to represent certain employees of the Employer for
purposes of improving wages, hours, and terms and conditions of
employment. Accordingly, we conclude that USE and WAC are separate
entities and that each qualifies as a labor organization within the meaning
of Section 2(5) of the Act.

various nonacademic capacities.
trte 37 job classifications in the physical plant department, only 14

11 The Teamsters did not renew its request for such a unit in its brief.
However, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, we assume that the
Teamsters has not abandoned this unit position.
plant office department performs general maintenance for the
SLAC complex.
13 Th e same situation is presented with respect to maintenance functions at
SLAC. The Teamsters would include the plant office department which
performs a wide variety of maintenance functions, but exclude the plant
engineering department which performs maintenance services for the
various research groups. However, in many cases, employees from both
departments work together in performing a particular job function.
4 On the basis of this same evidence, we conclude that the units urged by
Machinists and IBEW are also inappropriate for purposes of collective
bargaining. The Machinists unit of maintenance technicians would
exclude general maintenance employees whom we have found have a
close community of interest with the technicians performing laboratory
support functions. IBEW's request for a separate craft unit of
electricians cannot be sustained in light of the evidence demonstrating
that the University's maintenance operations produce an overlap in craft
skills and a commingling of employees performing craft functions.
University Press, hereinafter referred to as Press, has
approximately 70 employees, the majority of whom are represented by
various printing trades unions. It would appear that the only
unrepresented employees at Press are the graphic technicians and
proofreaders.
'®lt would appear from the record that CSEA-SEA would be willing to
include police and firemen in their unit if the Board found that separate
units of these employees would not be appropriate.

19 While some of the University's clericals may not be performing typical
office clerical functions, the record evidence does not establish tf at any
identifiable segment of the clericals share a closer community of interest

their inclusion in CSEA-SEA's unit would not be improper. Similar
considerations support CSEA-SEA's claims that the four audio-visual
operators be included in the unit. Although the record indicates that, due
to their separate and unique functions, the audio-visual operators do not
have a close community of interest with any other group of employees,
their function is to provide highly technical services to the various
departments, and hence they would appear likely to share common
interests with the laboratory support technicians being sought by
CSEA-SEA.
The Employer contends that CSEA-SEA should not be permitted to
exclude the University's clerical employees from their unit because the
clericals have a close community of interest with other university
employees, and in the past CSEA-SEA has attempted to bargain and serve
as spokesman for all university employees including the clericals. We J j
not agree. While it cannot be denied that all university employees sha.e
certain common interests, the Board's practice is not to include officc
clericals in what is essentially a maintenance unit because the two groups
do not share the same interests. 19 Nc>r do we attach any special
significance to the fact that in the past CSEA-SEA attempted to speak for
all university employees. No one disputes the fact that Stanford has
generally refused to recognize any organization as the representative of its
Over the years, Stanford's policy has been to meet with
employees individually or in groups to discuss any matters affecting the
employer-employee relationship. In several cases, these meetings between
Stanford and its employees produced changes in the University's policies
and practices. However, it seems clear from the record evidence that
Stanford steadfastly refused to confer or in any way deal with CSEA-SEA
or any other labor organization as the representative of the University's
employees. Accordingly, we find a complete absence of any bargaining
history affecting the employees here in question.2l
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance-service
unit sought by CSEA-SEA could be depending on the
disposition of the petitions pending before us requesting separate units for
police and firemen. Accordingly, we will reserve final judgment on the
appropriateness of CSEA-SEA's unit until we have ruled on the unit
requests by the Police Officers and Fire Fighters.
*
The Police Officers seeks a unit of all employees of the Stanford
University Police Department, excluding all other employees and
supervisors as defined in the Act. The police department employees are
classified together with firemen as protective services personnel, and both
the police and fire department are located in the same building. At the
hearing, all parties except WAC agreed that the Stanford police exercised
the typical security and protection functions required of policemen in
general and that a separate unit of police department employees would be
appropriate. WAC did not challenge the fact that the police department
employees here perform regular police duties, but it would nevertheless
include them in a residual unit with other classifications of employees. In
view of the undisputed evidence that police department employees are
guards within the meaning of the Act, the Board is precluded from finding
appropriate a unit which groups guards with other employces.23
Accordingly, as no other issues are raised with respect to this unit, we find
that a unit of all employees of the Stanford University Police Department,
excluding all other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act, is
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
*
The Eire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain. The Employer contends that the
firemen do not share a separate community of interest apart from other
employees. None of the other Unions involved in this proceeding seeks to
represent firemen either separately or as part of a larger unit.
The fire department employees like the police are classified by the
University as protective services personnel,24 and both departments arc
housed together in the same building on the main campus. The fire
department employees perform the usual fire fighting and fire prevention
services required of firemen in general. Firemen perform work exclusively
for cheir department, and there is no evidence of any interchange between
fire department employees and employees of other departments. No other
university personnel perform what might be termed a similar or
comparable function.
Although firemen enjoy the same general employee benefits as other
university personnel, their wage scale is determined on a separate basis and
is designed to be comparable with the wage rates received by firemen in the
surrounding communities.2s
Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, the absence ot any
bargaining history, and the fact that no labor organization seeks to
represent firemen in a broader unit, we find that a separate unit of firemen
is appropriate for purposes of bargaining.
The Employer also contends that fire captains are supervisors within
the meaning of the Act and therefore should be excluded from the unit.
The record evidence shows that with respect to organization the fire
department operates under the direction and control of the fire chief.
Reporting directly to the fire chief are two assistant chiefs who in turn arc
assisted by two battalion chiefs. The fire chief, assistant fire chiefs, and
battalion chiefs are all admitted supervisors. Below the battalion chicfs are
eight fire captains and approximately 35 firemen. The tire captains, whose
status is in dispute, have no authority to hire or discharge employees or
effectively to recommend such action. If a fireman commits an infraction
which is in direct contravention of department rules, the fire captain can
take action which may result in the employee's suspension; however, it
would appear that all such disciplinary matters arc subject to an
independent investigation and review and that the (ire captain has no
definitive role to play in the ultimate resolution of such matters. The fire
captains a.re directly responsible for the training of firemen and the upkeep
and maintenance of the department's fire equipment. Tire captains also
have the authority to direct fire fighting operations in the rare instances
when no superior officer is present. However, in carrying out this
responsibility, fire captains follow the routine operating procedures of the
department and have little opportunity to exercise independent judgment.
Accordingly, we find that the fire captains are more in the nature ol
leadmen than supervisors, and, therefore, we shall include them in the unit.
Finally, an issue is also raised with respect to the Fire l ighters'
failure to include all of the fire department's nonsupcrvisory personnel in
the unit. Although the record is somewhat Vague as to what, if any,
additional personnel arc administratively classified as part of the fire
department, the Employer contends that certain administrative and clerical
personnel located in the fire department headquarters building should he
included, as well as all student firemen. 26 We do not agree. The craft-type
unit sought here by the Fire Fighters is properly limited to those possessing
the skills aind exercising the responsibilities typically associated with
firemen. Accordingly, we shall exclude the administrative-clerical personnel
and student firemen from the unit.
*
In light of our findings that separate units of police and fire
department employees are appropriate, we now also find that the grouping
continued on next page

20 The only exceptions have been Stanford's recognition of various printing
trades unions as craft representatives of certain employees at Press and
its past recognition of the Meatcutters Union as representative for
employees of the University's commissary. The commissary as such is no
longer in existence.
There is no merit to the Employer's contention that it should have been
permitted to demonstrate that the sentiment among the office clericals
was in favor of vheir inclusion in any broad grouping of university
employees. The Board does not consider the subjective wishes of
employees in making its unit determinations. It is only after the
appropriate unit determinations are made that the Board has in some
instances permitted employees to determine their unit placement
through the means of a self-determination election.
22 While the overall unit urged by the Employer and USE might also be
appropriate, there is no labor organization eligible to proceed to an
election in this unit. No union has petitioned for an election in this unit,
and, although USE, as an intervenor, has requested an election in such a
unit, USE does not have u sufficient showing of interest to permit the
Board to treat USE as a cross-petitioner and direct an election in this
unit.
23 Section 9(b)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended.
24 The parties agree that firemen do not perform any security or
guard-type functions.
25 The Stanford University Fire Department is also party to several mutual
assistance pacts with fire deparvments in the neighboring communities.
would appear from the record that the student firemen do not have
the training and skill of regular Viremen and are unlikely to progress to
the point where they would be classified as firemen.

DECISION, ORDER, AND DIRECTION OE ELECTIONS
Upon petitions duly filed under Section 9(c) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, a hearing was held before Hearing Officers
Douglas H. Barton and Walter L. Kintz. Following the hearing and
pursuant to Section 102.67 of the National Labor Relations Board Rules
and Regulations, Series 8, as amended, and by direction of the Regional
Director for Region 20, this proceeding was transferred to the National
Labor Relations Board for decision. Thereafter, briefs were Filed with the
Board by the Teamsters, the Fire l ighters, the Police Officers, CSEA-SEA,
USE, and the Employer.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(b) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, the National Labor Relations Board has
delegated its authority in this proceeding to a three-member panel.
The Board has reviewed the rulings of the Hearing Officers made at
the hearing and finds that they are free from prejudicial error. They are
hereby affirmed.
*
Upon the entire record in this proceeding, the Board finds:
1. The Employer, Leland Stanford Jr. University, is a private
nonprofit institution of higher learning which was founded under a trust
agreement executed in 1885 and thereafter confirmed in the constitution
of the State of California. Its operating income for the fiscal year
ending August 31, 1969, was $150,610,560, of which approximately
$112,000,000 came from sources outside the State of California. During
this same period, it purchased goods and services valued at approximately
$48 million, and, of this sum, approximately $9 million involved
expenditures outside the State of California.
The undisputed evidence shows that the Employer meets the
jurisdictional standard for colleges and universities set forth in Section
103.1 of the Board's Rules and Regulations. Accordingly, we find that the
Employer is engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Act, and it
will effectuate the policies of the Act to assert jurisdiction herein.
2. We find that the Petitioners and Intervenors involved in this
proceeding are labor organizations seeking to represent certain employees
of the Employer.'
3. A question affecting commerce exists concerning the
representation of certain employees of the Employer within the meaning
of Sections 9(c)( 1) and 2(6) and (7) of the Act.
4. Stanford's main campus is located on the San Francisco
Peninsula about 30 miles south of San Francisco, California, and consists
of 1,150 contiguous acres that are not part of any municipality. Stanford
also uses for academic purposes a 4,000 acre site approximately 2 miles
from the main campus at which the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center is
located. The University is made up of approximately 218 academic and
nonacademic departments and major subdepartments which are under the
overall control of the University's president and five vice presidents.
Stanford employs approximately 7,000 individuals, included among which
are 1,250 faculty members, 2,000 supervisory or professional employees,
2,200 clericals, and 1,500 employees in maintenance, service, or technical
All but about 50 of these employees perform their duties
and functions at locations on the San Francisco Peninsula.
*
At issue in this proceeding are the nonsupervisory and
nonprofessional employees employed by Stanford, including employees
employed at Stanford University Press and Stanford Hospital. No party
seeks to include faculty members or professional employees of the
University in any of the proposed units. At the hearing the following unit
positions were urged by the respective parties:
(1) The Teamsters seeks a unit of all physical plant department
employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and supervisors as
defined in the Act. In the event the Board finds such a unit to be
inappropriate, the Teamsters has requested an alternative unit comprised of
all maintenance employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and
supervisors.
(2) The Fire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain.
(3) The Police Officers has requested a unit of all employees of the
Stanford University Police Department, excluding all other employees, and
supervisors as defined in the Act.
(4) CSEA-SEA seeks a unit of all employees engaged in service,
maintenance, and technical positions, excluding firemen, clerical
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(5) Machinists seeks a unit of all laboratory mechanicians., physical
science and engineering technicians, and maintenance machinists employed
at the Employer's main campus and at SLAC, excluding all other
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(6) USE seeks a unit of all nonprofessional full-time and part-time
permanent and seasonal employees of the University, including all
employees of the Stanford Press not currently represented, but excluding
all nonstudent firemen, all currently represented employees, professional
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(7) WAC contends that elections should be directed in three
separate units: (1) the unit sought by the Fire Fighters, (2) the unit sought
by the Teamsters, and (3) a residual unit of all other employees, excluding
only professional employees and supervisors.
(8) IBEW seeks a unit of all journeymen and apprentice electricians
employed by the University, excluding all other employees.
(9) UE expressed no unit position.
(10) Laborers also took no unit position but indicated its desire to
be on the ballot in any election in an overall unit or for any residual unit
from which one or more crafts have been severed.
(11) The Employer contends that two units are appropriate. One
would be a unit of all nonsupervisory, nonprofessional employees
employed by the University within the State of California, excluding
employees of Stanford Hospital, employees of Stanford University Press
who are currently represented, students, part-time and casual employees,
confidential employees, and guards. The second would be a unit of all
employees of the Stanford University Police Department, excluding all
other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act.
As the foregoing indicates, there is a considerable difference of
opinion among the parties over what constitutes the appropriate unit or
units for purposes of collective bargaining. These positions range in scope
from requests for various types of craft and departmental units to units
encompassing all nonprofessional employees employed by the University.
In such cases, it is not the Board's function to determine^ which unit or
units might be the most appropriate. Rather, the Board's role in such
circumstances is to determine which, if any, of the petitioned-for units can
be considered appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
Accordingly with these considerations in mind, we shall examine the units
requested.
*
As previously indicated, the Teamsters has requested a unit of all
physical plant department employees. The physical plant department is
one of 16 nonacademic departments which arc under the overall control of
the vice president for business affairs. The department performs a myriad
of activities, including the operation of the campus utility systems, the
maintenance of buildings, roads, and grounds, and the furnishing of
audiovisual services. The physical plant department consists of
approximately IH7 employees in 37 different job classifications. Although
the physical plant department has a central headquarters location, most of
the work is performed away from the shop. There is no common
supervision, wages, or hours of work among the employees in the physical
plant department Also many of the other university departments employ
individuals in the same job classifications as those in the physical plant
department,lo and it is not uncommon for employees in the physical plant
department to work in conjunction with employees of similar skills from
other departments. Perhaps even more significant is the fact that these
other departments perform many of the same job functions as the
employees in the physical plant department and, hence, there are only a
few categories of work assignment which are performed exclusively by the
employees in the physical plant department. Accordingly, on the basis of
the foregoing, we conclude that there is no separate identity of interest
among employees of the physical plant department from that of other
employees which would justify a finding that such a unit could be
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
The Teamsters alternative unit position covers a broader grouping of
maintenance personnel.'' While the unit in question is not precisely

defined, it is clear that it would include employees of the physical plant
department and the plant office department at SLAC, 12 pius employees
performing custodial duties at the University. The unit as described covers
employees in some 20 different departments. However, with the possible
exception of the physical plant department, the Teamsters is not seeking
all the employees in any one department. The unit purports to include all
employees performing maintenance type functions at the University, but
specifically excluded from the unit are several categories of employees
whose work is closely related to that of the unit employees. For example,
physical science and engineering technicians repair and calibrate every type
of electronic and mechanical equipment and on many occasions they work
side-by-side with other journeyman craftsmen who are part of the
proposed Teamsters maintenance unit. Also specifically excluded are the
laboratory mechanicians who possess the same basic skills as the
journeyman mechanics but specialize in the assembly, installation, and
repair of various types of laboratory equipment. Many of the job functions
performed by these laboratory support people are identical with those
performed by the journeyman craftsmen in the Finally, the
Teamsters would include employees performing custodial services, but it
would exclude the food service employees whose interests are closely allied
with those of the custodial employees. A large percentage of the custodial
employees share common supervision and have day-to-day contact with the
food service employees. Furthermore, during the summer months when
food services are reduced, approximately one-half of the food service
employees reiain employment by transferring over to custodial jobs.
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance unit
sought by the Teamsters is too limited in scope to constitute an
appropriate unit of maintenance employees.! 4 Accordingly, as neither of
the Teamsters' requested units can be found to be appropriate for purposes
of collective bargaining, we shall dismiss the petition filed in Case
20-RC-9202.
*
CSEA-SEA has petitioned for a unit of employees engaged in
service, maintenance, and technical positions. The unit as defined would
cover employees at both the main campus and SLAC and would include all
maintenance classifications, all laboratory support personnel, all food
service and custodial employees, and graphic technicians and proofreaders
at Stanford University Press.'s Specifically excluded from the unit are the
police and fire departments, each of which is being sought separately by
other Unions, a ll office clerical employees, and all library personnel, as
well as the general categories of managerial and professional employees,
guards, and all supervisors as defined in the Act. Both the Employer and
USE contend that this unit is too limited in scope and that the appropriate
unit should include all of the University's nonprofessional and
nonsupervisory employees.
There is considerable record testimony which would lend support to
a conclusion that an overall unit of nonprofessional and nonsupervisory
employees would be appropriate. For example, the University's personnel
and employment policies are for the most part standardized and most
university employees are covered by the same wage scale and program of
benefits.' 7 At the main campus, employees are centrally hired through the
University's personnel office, and, when a job opening occurs in a
particular department, employees throughout the University are permitted
to bid on the opening.
On the other hand, however, the unit being sought by CSEA-SEA is
essentially a grouping of all employees engaged in maintenance type
functions, and the Board has on several occasions held that an overall unit
of maintenance employees can be appropriate under certain
circumstances. as our previous findings indicate, the maintenance
functions at the University arc highly integrated, and there can be no
doubt that all the University's maintenance employees share a close
community of interest. There would also appear to be ample justification
for including in such a unit the various nonmaintenance classifications
sought by CSEA-SEA. Thus the custodians, although not classified as
maintenance employees by the University, are traditionally included in
maintenance-type units under existing Board policy. In the circumstances
present here, any action involving the custodians requires that the same
action be taken with respect to food service employees because of the close
community of interest and interchangeability in job functions among
employees in the two categories. The graphics and publications employees
whom CSEA-SEA would also include would most properly belong in units
covering employees at Press. However, in view of the fact that these
employees have been excluded from the existing units at Press and now
constitute a residual group which no union seeks to represent separately,

®The Employer and USE each filed motions to correct the transcript. USE
also filed objections to the Employer's motion to correct the transcript.
No responses to the motions and objections have been received from any
other party to the proceeding. Accordingly, to the extent that USE and
the Employer's motions to correct the transcript are not in conflict, they
are hereby granted. In all other respects, the motions are hereby denied.
7 CSE A-SEA contends that USE and WAC are a single entity and that their
representations that they are separate organizations should disqualify
them from participating in this proceeding. CSEA-SEA also contends that
WAC does not qualify as a labor organization within the meaning of
Section 2(5) of the Act. We find no merit in these contentions. The
record evidence shows that, although WAC was at one time a subgroup
within USE, the two organizations have separated over a policy
disagreement, and USE and WAC now function as separate independent
entities. The record evidence further shows that each of these
organizations claims to represent certain employees of the Employer for
purposes of improving wages, hours, and terms and conditions of
employment. Accordingly, we conclude that USE and WAC are separate
entities and that each qualifies as a labor organization within the meaning
of Section 2(5) of the Act.

However, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, we assume that the
Teamsters has not abandoned this unit position.
plant office department performs general maintenance for the
SLAC complex.
13 Th e same situation is presented with respect to maintenance functions at
SLAC. The Teamsters would include the plant office department which
performs a wide variety of maintenance functions, but exclude the plant
engineering department which performs maintenance services for the
various research groups. However, in many cases, employees from both
departments work together in performing a particular job function.
4 On the basis of this same evidence, we conclude that the units urged by
Machinists and IBEW are also inappropriate for purposes of collective
bargaining. The Machinists unit of maintenance technicians would
exclude general maintenance employees whom we have found have a
close community of interest with the technicians performing laboratory
support functions. IBEW's request for a separate craft unit of
electricians cannot be sustained in light of the evidence demonstrating
that the University's maintenance operations produce an overlap in craft
skills and a commingling of employees performing craft functions.
University Press, hereinafter referred to as Press, has
approximately 70 employees, the majority of whom are represented by
various printing trades unions. It would appear that the only
unrepresented employees at Press are the graphic technicians and
proofreaders.
'®lt would appear from the record that CSEA-SEA would be willing to
include police and firemen in their unit if the Board found that separate
units of these employees would not be appropriate.

18 Cf. California Institute of Technology, 192 NLRB No. 82.
19 While some of the University's clericals may not be performing typical
office clerical functions, the record evidence does not establish tf at any
identifiable segment of the clericals share a closer community of interest
with those in the unit than they ric with other clericals.

their inclusion in CSEA-SEA's unit would not be improper. Similar
considerations support CSEA-SEA's claims that the four audio-visual
operators be included in the unit. Although the record indicates that, due
to their separate and unique functions, the audio-visual operators do not
have a close community of interest with any other group of employees,
their function is to provide highly technical services to the various
departments, and hence they would appear likely to share common
interests with the laboratory support technicians being sought by
CSEA-SEA.
The Employer contends that CSEA-SEA should not be permitted to
exclude the University's clerical employees from their unit because the
clericals have a close community of interest with other university
employees, and in the past CSEA-SEA has attempted to bargain and serve
as spokesman for all university employees including the clericals. We J j
not agree. While it cannot be denied that all university employees sha.e
certain common interests, the Board's practice is not to include officc
clericals in what is essentially a maintenance unit because the two groups
do not share the same interests. 19 Nc>r do we attach any special
significance to the fact that in the past CSEA-SEA attempted to speak for
all university employees. No one disputes the fact that Stanford has
generally refused to recognize any organization as the representative of its
Over the years, Stanford's policy has been to meet with
employees individually or in groups to discuss any matters affecting the
employer-employee relationship. In several cases, these meetings between
Stanford and its employees produced changes in the University's policies
and practices. However, it seems clear from the record evidence that
Stanford steadfastly refused to confer or in any way deal with CSEA-SEA
or any other labor organization as the representative of the University's
employees. Accordingly, we find a complete absence of any bargaining
history affecting the employees here in question.2l
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance-service
unit sought by CSEA-SEA could be depending on the
disposition of the petitions pending before us requesting separate units for
police and firemen. Accordingly, we will reserve final judgment on the
appropriateness of CSEA-SEA's unit until we have ruled on the unit
requests by the Police Officers and Fire Fighters.
*
The Police Officers seeks a unit of all employees of the Stanford
University Police Department, excluding all other employees and
supervisors as defined in the Act. The police department employees are
classified together with firemen as protective services personnel, and both
the police and fire department are located in the same building. At the
hearing, all parties except WAC agreed that the Stanford police exercised
the typical security and protection functions required of policemen in
general and that a separate unit of police department employees would be
appropriate. WAC did not challenge the fact that the police department
employees here perform regular police duties, but it would nevertheless
include them in a residual unit with other classifications of employees. In
view of the undisputed evidence that police department employees are
guards within the meaning of the Act, the Board is precluded from finding
appropriate a unit which groups guards with other employces.23
Accordingly, as no other issues are raised with respect to this unit, we find
that a unit of all employees of the Stanford University Police Department,
excluding all other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act, is
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
*
The Eire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain. The Employer contends that the
firemen do not share a separate community of interest apart from other
employees. None of the other Unions involved in this proceeding seeks to
represent firemen either separately or as part of a larger unit.
The fire department employees like the police are classified by the
University as protective services personnel,24 and both departments arc
housed together in the same building on the main campus. The fire
department employees perform the usual fire fighting and fire prevention
services required of firemen in general. Firemen perform work exclusively
for cheir department, and there is no evidence of any interchange between
fire department employees and employees of other departments. No other
university personnel perform what might be termed a similar or
comparable function.
Although firemen enjoy the same general employee benefits as other
university personnel, their wage scale is determined on a separate basis and
is designed to be comparable with the wage rates received by firemen in the
surrounding communities.2s
Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, the absence ot any
bargaining history, and the fact that no labor organization seeks to
represent firemen in a broader unit, we find that a separate unit of firemen
is appropriate for purposes of bargaining.
The Employer also contends that fire captains are supervisors within
the meaning of the Act and therefore should be excluded from the unit.
The record evidence shows that with respect to organization the fire
department operates under the direction and control of the fire chief.
Reporting directly to the fire chief are two assistant chiefs who in turn arc
assisted by two battalion chiefs. The fire chief, assistant fire chiefs, and
battalion chiefs are all admitted supervisors. Below the battalion chicfs are
eight fire captains and approximately 35 firemen. The tire captains, whose
status is in dispute, have no authority to hire or discharge employees or
effectively to recommend such action. If a fireman commits an infraction
which is in direct contravention of department rules, the fire captain can
take action which may result in the employee's suspension; however, it
would appear that all such disciplinary matters arc subject to an
independent investigation and review and that the (ire captain has no
definitive role to play in the ultimate resolution of such matters. The fire
captains a.re directly responsible for the training of firemen and the upkeep
and maintenance of the department's fire equipment. Tire captains also
have the authority to direct fire fighting operations in the rare instances
when no superior officer is present. However, in carrying out this
responsibility, fire captains follow the routine operating procedures of the
department and have little opportunity to exercise independent judgment.
Accordingly, we find that the fire captains are more in the nature ol
leadmen than supervisors, and, therefore, we shall include them in the unit.
Finally, an issue is also raised with respect to the Fire l ighters'
failure to include all of the fire department's nonsupcrvisory personnel in
the unit. Although the record is somewhat Vague as to what, if any,
additional personnel arc administratively classified as part of the fire
department, the Employer contends that certain administrative and clerical
personnel located in the fire department headquarters building should he
included, as well as all student firemen. 26 We do not agree. The craft-type
unit sought here by the Fire Fighters is properly limited to those possessing
the skills aind exercising the responsibilities typically associated with
firemen. Accordingly, we shall exclude the administrative-clerical personnel
and student firemen from the unit.
*
In light of our findings that separate units of police and fire
department employees are appropriate, we now also find that the grouping
continued on next page

20 The only exceptions have been Stanford's recognition of various printing
trades unions as craft representatives of certain employees at Press and
its past recognition of the Meatcutters Union as representative for
employees of the University's commissary. The commissary as such is no
longer in existence.
There is no merit to the Employer's contention that it should have been
permitted to demonstrate that the sentiment among the office clericals
was in favor of vheir inclusion in any broad grouping of university
employees. The Board does not consider the subjective wishes of
employees in making its unit determinations. It is only after the
appropriate unit determinations are made that the Board has in some
instances permitted employees to determine their unit placement
through the means of a self-determination election.
22 While the overall unit urged by the Employer and USE might also be
appropriate, there is no labor organization eligible to proceed to an
election in this unit. No union has petitioned for an election in this unit,
and, although USE, as an intervenor, has requested an election in such a
unit, USE does not have u sufficient showing of interest to permit the
Board to treat USE as a cross-petitioner and direct an election in this
unit.
23 Section 9(b)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended.
24 The parties agree that firemen do not perform any security or
guard-type functions.
25 The Stanford University Fire Department is also party to several mutual
assistance pacts with fire deparvments in the neighboring communities.
would appear from the record that the student firemen do not have
the training and skill of regular Viremen and are unlikely to progress to
the point where they would be classified as firemen.

DECISION, ORDER, AND DIRECTION OE ELECTIONS
Upon petitions duly filed under Section 9(c) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, a hearing was held before Hearing Officers
Douglas H. Barton and Walter L. Kintz. Following the hearing and
pursuant to Section 102.67 of the National Labor Relations Board Rules
and Regulations, Series 8, as amended, and by direction of the Regional
Director for Region 20, this proceeding was transferred to the National
Labor Relations Board for decision. Thereafter, briefs were Filed with the
Board by the Teamsters, the Fire l ighters, the Police Officers, CSEA-SEA,
USE, and the Employer.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(b) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, the National Labor Relations Board has
delegated its authority in this proceeding to a three-member panel.
The Board has reviewed the rulings of the Hearing Officers made at
the hearing and finds that they are free from prejudicial error. They are
hereby affirmed.
*
Upon the entire record in this proceeding, the Board finds:
1. The Employer, Leland Stanford Jr. University, is a private
nonprofit institution of higher learning which was founded under a trust
agreement executed in 1885 and thereafter confirmed in the constitution
of the State of California. Its operating income for the fiscal year
ending August 31, 1969, was $150,610,560, of which approximately
$112,000,000 came from sources outside the State of California. During
this same period, it purchased goods and services valued at approximately
$48 million, and, of this sum, approximately $9 million involved
expenditures outside the State of California.
The undisputed evidence shows that the Employer meets the
jurisdictional standard for colleges and universities set forth in Section
103.1 of the Board's Rules and Regulations. Accordingly, we find that the
Employer is engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Act, and it
will effectuate the policies of the Act to assert jurisdiction herein.
2. We find that the Petitioners and Intervenors involved in this
proceeding are labor organizations seeking to represent certain employees
of the Employer.'
3. A question affecting commerce exists concerning the
representation of certain employees of the Employer within the meaning
of Sections 9(c)( 1) and 2(6) and (7) of the Act.
4. Stanford's main campus is located on the San Francisco
Peninsula about 30 miles south of San Francisco, California, and consists
of 1,150 contiguous acres that are not part of any municipality. Stanford
also uses for academic purposes a 4,000 acre site approximately 2 miles
from the main campus at which the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center is
located. The University is made up of approximately 218 academic and
nonacademic departments and major subdepartments which are under the
overall control of the University's president and five vice presidents.
Stanford employs approximately 7,000 individuals, included among which
are 1,250 faculty members, 2,000 supervisory or professional employees,
2,200 clericals, and 1,500 employees in maintenance, service, or technical
All but about 50 of these employees perform their duties
and functions at locations on the San Francisco Peninsula.
*
At issue in this proceeding are the nonsupervisory and
nonprofessional employees employed by Stanford, including employees
employed at Stanford University Press and Stanford Hospital. No party
seeks to include faculty members or professional employees of the
University in any of the proposed units. At the hearing the following unit
positions were urged by the respective parties:
(1) The Teamsters seeks a unit of all physical plant department
employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and supervisors as
defined in the Act. In the event the Board finds such a unit to be
inappropriate, the Teamsters has requested an alternative unit comprised of
all maintenance employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and
supervisors.
(2) The Fire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain.
(3) The Police Officers has requested a unit of all employees of the
Stanford University Police Department, excluding all other employees, and
supervisors as defined in the Act.
(4) CSEA-SEA seeks a unit of all employees engaged in service,
maintenance, and technical positions, excluding firemen, clerical
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(5) Machinists seeks a unit of all laboratory mechanicians., physical
science and engineering technicians, and maintenance machinists employed
at the Employer's main campus and at SLAC, excluding all other
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(6) USE seeks a unit of all nonprofessional full-time and part-time
permanent and seasonal employees of the University, including all
employees of the Stanford Press not currently represented, but excluding
all nonstudent firemen, all currently represented employees, professional
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(7) WAC contends that elections should be directed in three
separate units: (1) the unit sought by the Fire Fighters, (2) the unit sought
by the Teamsters, and (3) a residual unit of all other employees, excluding
only professional employees and supervisors.
(8) IBEW seeks a unit of all journeymen and apprentice electricians
employed by the University, excluding all other employees.
(9) UE expressed no unit position.
(10) Laborers also took no unit position but indicated its desire to
be on the ballot in any election in an overall unit or for any residual unit
from which one or more crafts have been severed.
(11) The Employer contends that two units are appropriate. One
would be a unit of all nonsupervisory, nonprofessional employees
employed by the University within the State of California, excluding
employees of Stanford Hospital, employees of Stanford University Press
who are currently represented, students, part-time and casual employees,
confidential employees, and guards. The second would be a unit of all
employees of the Stanford University Police Department, excluding all
other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act.
As the foregoing indicates, there is a considerable difference of
opinion among the parties over what constitutes the appropriate unit or
units for purposes of collective bargaining. These positions range in scope
from requests for various types of craft and departmental units to units
encompassing all nonprofessional employees employed by the University.
In such cases, it is not the Board's function to determine^ which unit or
units might be the most appropriate. Rather, the Board's role in such
circumstances is to determine which, if any, of the petitioned-for units can
be considered appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
Accordingly with these considerations in mind, we shall examine the units
requested.
*
As previously indicated, the Teamsters has requested a unit of all
physical plant department employees. The physical plant department is
one of 16 nonacademic departments which arc under the overall control of
the vice president for business affairs. The department performs a myriad
of activities, including the operation of the campus utility systems, the
maintenance of buildings, roads, and grounds, and the furnishing of
audiovisual services. The physical plant department consists of
approximately IH7 employees in 37 different job classifications. Although
the physical plant department has a central headquarters location, most of
the work is performed away from the shop. There is no common
supervision, wages, or hours of work among the employees in the physical
plant department Also many of the other university departments employ
individuals in the same job classifications as those in the physical plant
department,lo and it is not uncommon for employees in the physical plant
department to work in conjunction with employees of similar skills from
other departments. Perhaps even more significant is the fact that these
other departments perform many of the same job functions as the
employees in the physical plant department and, hence, there are only a
few categories of work assignment which are performed exclusively by the
employees in the physical plant department. Accordingly, on the basis of
the foregoing, we conclude that there is no separate identity of interest
among employees of the physical plant department from that of other
employees which would justify a finding that such a unit could be
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
The Teamsters alternative unit position covers a broader grouping of
maintenance personnel.'' While the unit in question is not precisely

defined, it is clear that it would include employees of the physical plant
department and the plant office department at SLAC, 12 pius employees
performing custodial duties at the University. The unit as described covers
employees in some 20 different departments. However, with the possible
exception of the physical plant department, the Teamsters is not seeking
all the employees in any one department. The unit purports to include all
employees performing maintenance type functions at the University, but
specifically excluded from the unit are several categories of employees
whose work is closely related to that of the unit employees. For example,
physical science and engineering technicians repair and calibrate every type
of electronic and mechanical equipment and on many occasions they work
side-by-side with other journeyman craftsmen who are part of the
proposed Teamsters maintenance unit. Also specifically excluded are the
laboratory mechanicians who possess the same basic skills as the
journeyman mechanics but specialize in the assembly, installation, and
repair of various types of laboratory equipment. Many of the job functions
performed by these laboratory support people are identical with those
performed by the journeyman craftsmen in the Finally, the
Teamsters would include employees performing custodial services, but it
would exclude the food service employees whose interests are closely allied
with those of the custodial employees. A large percentage of the custodial
employees share common supervision and have day-to-day contact with the
food service employees. Furthermore, during the summer months when
food services are reduced, approximately one-half of the food service
employees reiain employment by transferring over to custodial jobs.
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance unit
sought by the Teamsters is too limited in scope to constitute an
appropriate unit of maintenance employees.! 4 Accordingly, as neither of
the Teamsters' requested units can be found to be appropriate for purposes
of collective bargaining, we shall dismiss the petition filed in Case
20-RC-9202.
*
CSEA-SEA has petitioned for a unit of employees engaged in
service, maintenance, and technical positions. The unit as defined would
cover employees at both the main campus and SLAC and would include all
maintenance classifications, all laboratory support personnel, all food
service and custodial employees, and graphic technicians and proofreaders
at Stanford University Press.'s Specifically excluded from the unit are the
police and fire departments, each of which is being sought separately by
other Unions, a ll office clerical employees, and all library personnel, as
well as the general categories of managerial and professional employees,
guards, and all supervisors as defined in the Act. Both the Employer and
USE contend that this unit is too limited in scope and that the appropriate
unit should include all of the University's nonprofessional and
nonsupervisory employees.
There is considerable record testimony which would lend support to
a conclusion that an overall unit of nonprofessional and nonsupervisory

and employment policies are for the most part standardized and most
university employees are covered by the same wage scale and program of

to bid on the opening.
On the other hand, however, the unit being sought by CSEA-SEA is
essentially a grouping of all employees engaged in maintenance type
functions, and the Board has on several occasions held that an overall unit

circumstances. as our previous findings indicate, the maintenance
functions at the University arc highly integrated, and there can be no
doubt that all the University's maintenance employees share a close
community of interest. There would also appear to be ample justification
for including in such a unit the various nonmaintenance classifications
sought by CSEA-SEA. Thus the custodians, although not classified as
maintenance employees by the University, are traditionally included in
maintenance-type units under existing Board policy. In the circumstances
present here, any action involving the custodians requires that the same
action be taken with respect to food service employees because of the close
community of interest and interchangeability in job functions among
employees in the two categories. The graphics and publications employees
whom CSEA-SEA would also include would most properly belong in units
covering employees at Press. However, in view of the fact that these
employees have been excluded from the existing units at Press and now
constitute a residual group which no union seeks to represent separately,

7 CSE A-SEA contends that USE and WAC are a single entity and that their
representations that they are separate organizations should disqualify
them from participating in this proceeding. CSEA-SEA also contends that
WAC does not qualify as a labor organization within the meaning of
Section 2(5) of the Act. We find no merit in these contentions. The
record evidence shows that, although WAC was at one time a subgroup
within USE, the two organizations have separated over a policy
disagreement, and USE and WAC now function as separate independent
entities. The record evidence further shows that each of these
organizations claims to represent certain employees of the Employer for
purposes of improving wages, hours, and terms and conditions of
employment. Accordingly, we conclude that USE and WAC are separate
entities and that each qualifies as a labor organization within the meaning
of Section 2(5) of the Act.

various nonacademic capacities.

plant office department performs general maintenance for the
SLAC complex.
13 Th e same situation is presented with respect to maintenance functions at
SLAC. The Teamsters would include the plant office department which
performs a wide variety of maintenance functions, but exclude the plant
engineering department which performs maintenance services for the
various research groups. However, in many cases, employees from both
departments work together in performing a particular job function.
4 On the basis of this same evidence, we conclude that the units urged by
Machinists and IBEW are also inappropriate for purposes of collective
bargaining. The Machinists unit of maintenance technicians would
exclude general maintenance employees whom we have found have a
close community of interest with the technicians performing laboratory
support functions. IBEW's request for a separate craft unit of
electricians cannot be sustained in light of the evidence demonstrating
that the University's maintenance operations produce an overlap in craft
skills and a commingling of employees performing craft functions.
University Press, hereinafter referred to as Press, has
approximately 70 employees, the majority of whom are represented by
various printing trades unions. It would appear that the only
unrepresented employees at Press are the graphic technicians and
proofreaders.
'®lt would appear from the record that CSEA-SEA would be willing to
include police and firemen in their unit if the Board found that separate
units of these employees would not be appropriate.

19 While some of the University's clericals may not be performing typical
office clerical functions, the record evidence does not establish tf at any
identifiable segment of the clericals share a closer community of interest
with those in the unit than they ric with other clericals.

their inclusion in CSEA-SEA's unit would not be improper. Similar
considerations support CSEA-SEA's claims that the four audio-visual
operators be included in the unit. Although the record indicates that, due
to their separate and unique functions, the audio-visual operators do not
have a close community of interest with any other group of employees,
their function is to provide highly technical services to the various
departments, and hence they would appear likely to share common
interests with the laboratory support technicians being sought by
CSEA-SEA.
The Employer contends that CSEA-SEA should not be permitted to
exclude the University's clerical employees from their unit because the
clericals have a close community of interest with other university
employees, and in the past CSEA-SEA has attempted to bargain and serve
as spokesman for all university employees including the clericals. We J j
not agree. While it cannot be denied that all university employees sha.e
certain common interests, the Board's practice is not to include officc
clericals in what is essentially a maintenance unit because the two groups
do not share the same interests. 19 Nc>r do we attach any special
significance to the fact that in the past CSEA-SEA attempted to speak for
all university employees. No one disputes the fact that Stanford has
generally refused to recognize any organization as the representative of its
Over the years, Stanford's policy has been to meet with
employees individually or in groups to discuss any matters affecting the
employer-employee relationship. In several cases, these meetings between
Stanford and its employees produced changes in the University's policies
and practices. However, it seems clear from the record evidence that
Stanford steadfastly refused to confer or in any way deal with CSEA-SEA
or any other labor organization as the representative of the University's
employees. Accordingly, we find a complete absence of any bargaining
history affecting the employees here in question.2l
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance-service
unit sought by CSEA-SEA could be depending on the
disposition of the petitions pending before us requesting separate units for
police and firemen. Accordingly, we will reserve final judgment on the
appropriateness of CSEA-SEA's unit until we have ruled on the unit
requests by the Police Officers and Fire Fighters.
*
The Police Officers seeks a unit of all employees of the Stanford
University Police Department, excluding all other employees and
supervisors as defined in the Act. The police department employees are
classified together with firemen as protective services personnel, and both
the police and fire department are located in the same building. At the
hearing, all parties except WAC agreed that the Stanford police exercised
the typical security and protection functions required of policemen in
general and that a separate unit of police department employees would be
appropriate. WAC did not challenge the fact that the police department
employees here perform regular police duties, but it would nevertheless
include them in a residual unit with other classifications of employees. In
view of the undisputed evidence that police department employees are
guards within the meaning of the Act, the Board is precluded from finding
appropriate a unit which groups guards with other employces.23
Accordingly, as no other issues are raised with respect to this unit, we find
that a unit of all employees of the Stanford University Police Department,
excluding all other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act, is
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
*
The Eire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain. The Employer contends that the
firemen do not share a separate community of interest apart from other
employees. None of the other Unions involved in this proceeding seeks to
represent firemen either separately or as part of a larger unit.
The fire department employees like the police are classified by the
University as protective services personnel,24 and both departments arc
housed together in the same building on the main campus. The fire
department employees perform the usual fire fighting and fire prevention
services required of firemen in general. Firemen perform work exclusively
for cheir department, and there is no evidence of any interchange between
fire department employees and employees of other departments. No other
university personnel perform what might be termed a similar or
comparable function.
Although firemen enjoy the same general employee benefits as other
university personnel, their wage scale is determined on a separate basis and
is designed to be comparable with the wage rates received by firemen in the
surrounding communities.2s
Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, the absence ot any
bargaining history, and the fact that no labor organization seeks to
represent firemen in a broader unit, we find that a separate unit of firemen
is appropriate for purposes of bargaining.
The Employer also contends that fire captains are supervisors within
the meaning of the Act and therefore should be excluded from the unit.
The record evidence shows that with respect to organization the fire
department operates under the direction and control of the fire chief.
Reporting directly to the fire chief are two assistant chiefs who in turn arc
assisted by two battalion chiefs. The fire chief, assistant fire chiefs, and
battalion chiefs are all admitted supervisors. Below the battalion chicfs are
eight fire captains and approximately 35 firemen. The tire captains, whose
status is in dispute, have no authority to hire or discharge employees or
effectively to recommend such action. If a fireman commits an infraction
which is in direct contravention of department rules, the fire captain can
take action which may result in the employee's suspension; however, it
would appear that all such disciplinary matters arc subject to an
independent investigation and review and that the (ire captain has no
definitive role to play in the ultimate resolution of such matters. The fire
captains a.re directly responsible for the training of firemen and the upkeep
and maintenance of the department's fire equipment. Tire captains also
have the authority to direct fire fighting operations in the rare instances
when no superior officer is present. However, in carrying out this
responsibility, fire captains follow the routine operating procedures of the
department and have little opportunity to exercise independent judgment.
Accordingly, we find that the fire captains are more in the nature ol
leadmen than supervisors, and, therefore, we shall include them in the unit.
Finally, an issue is also raised with respect to the Fire l ighters'
failure to include all of the fire department's nonsupcrvisory personnel in
the unit. Although the record is somewhat Vague as to what, if any,
additional personnel arc administratively classified as part of the fire
department, the Employer contends that certain administrative and clerical
personnel located in the fire department headquarters building should he
included, as well as all student firemen. 26 We do not agree. The craft-type
unit sought here by the Fire Fighters is properly limited to those possessing
the skills aind exercising the responsibilities typically associated with
firemen. Accordingly, we shall exclude the administrative-clerical personnel
and student firemen from the unit.
*
In light of our findings that separate units of police and fire
department employees are appropriate, we now also find that the grouping
continued on next page

20 The only exceptions have been Stanford's recognition of various printing
trades unions as craft representatives of certain employees at Press and
its past recognition of the Meatcutters Union as representative for
employees of the University's commissary. The commissary as such is no
longer in existence.
There is no merit to the Employer's contention that it should have been
permitted to demonstrate that the sentiment among the office clericals
was in favor of vheir inclusion in any broad grouping of university
employees. The Board does not consider the subjective wishes of
employees in making its unit determinations. It is only after the
appropriate unit determinations are made that the Board has in some
instances permitted employees to determine their unit placement
through the means of a self-determination election.
22 While the overall unit urged by the Employer and USE might also be
appropriate, there is no labor organization eligible to proceed to an
election in this unit. No union has petitioned for an election in this unit,
and, although USE, as an intervenor, has requested an election in such a
unit, USE does not have u sufficient showing of interest to permit the
Board to treat USE as a cross-petitioner and direct an election in this
unit.
23 Section 9(b)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended.
24 The parties agree that firemen do not perform any security or
guard-type functions.
25 The Stanford University Fire Department is also party to several mutual
assistance pacts with fire deparvments in the neighboring communities.
would appear from the record that the student firemen do not have
the training and skill of regular Viremen and are unlikely to progress to
the point where they would be classified as firemen.

DECISION, ORDER, AND DIRECTION OE ELECTIONS
Upon petitions duly filed under Section 9(c) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, a hearing was held before Hearing Officers
Douglas H. Barton and Walter L. Kintz. Following the hearing and
pursuant to Section 102.67 of the National Labor Relations Board Rules
and Regulations, Series 8, as amended, and by direction of the Regional
Director for Region 20, this proceeding was transferred to the National
Labor Relations Board for decision. Thereafter, briefs were Filed with the
Board by the Teamsters, the Fire l ighters, the Police Officers, CSEA-SEA,
USE, and the Employer.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(b) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, the National Labor Relations Board has
delegated its authority in this proceeding to a three-member panel.
The Board has reviewed the rulings of the Hearing Officers made at
the hearing and finds that they are free from prejudicial error. They are
hereby affirmed.
*
Upon the entire record in this proceeding, the Board finds:
1. The Employer, Leland Stanford Jr. University, is a private
nonprofit institution of higher learning which was founded under a trust
agreement executed in 1885 and thereafter confirmed in the constitution
of the State of California. Its operating income for the fiscal year
ending August 31, 1969, was $150,610,560, of which approximately
$112,000,000 came from sources outside the State of California. During
this same period, it purchased goods and services valued at approximately
$48 million, and, of this sum, approximately $9 million involved
expenditures outside the State of California.
The undisputed evidence shows that the Employer meets the
jurisdictional standard for colleges and universities set forth in Section
103.1 of the Board's Rules and Regulations. Accordingly, we find that the
Employer is engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Act, and it
will effectuate the policies of the Act to assert jurisdiction herein.
2. We find that the Petitioners and Intervenors involved in this
proceeding are labor organizations seeking to represent certain employees
of the Employer.'
3. A question affecting commerce exists concerning the
representation of certain employees of the Employer within the meaning
of Sections 9(c)( 1) and 2(6) and (7) of the Act.
4. Stanford's main campus is located on the San Francisco
Peninsula about 30 miles south of San Francisco, California, and consists
of 1,150 contiguous acres that are not part of any municipality. Stanford
also uses for academic purposes a 4,000 acre site approximately 2 miles
from the main campus at which the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center is
located. The University is made up of approximately 218 academic and
nonacademic departments and major subdepartments which are under the
overall control of the University's president and five vice presidents.
Stanford employs approximately 7,000 individuals, included among which
are 1,250 faculty members, 2,000 supervisory or professional employees,
2,200 clericals, and 1,500 employees in maintenance, service, or technical
All but about 50 of these employees perform their duties
and functions at locations on the San Francisco Peninsula.
*
At issue in this proceeding are the nonsupervisory and
nonprofessional employees employed by Stanford, including employees
employed at Stanford University Press and Stanford Hospital. No party
seeks to include faculty members or professional employees of the
University in any of the proposed units. At the hearing the following unit
positions were urged by the respective parties:
(1) The Teamsters seeks a unit of all physical plant department
employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and supervisors as
defined in the Act. In the event the Board finds such a unit to be
inappropriate, the Teamsters has requested an alternative unit comprised of
all maintenance employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and
supervisors.
(2) The Fire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain.
(3) The Police Officers has requested a unit of all employees of the
Stanford University Police Department, excluding all other employees, and
supervisors as defined in the Act.
(4) CSEA-SEA seeks a unit of all employees engaged in service,
maintenance, and technical positions, excluding firemen, clerical
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(5) Machinists seeks a unit of all laboratory mechanicians., physical
science and engineering technicians, and maintenance machinists employed
at the Employer's main campus and at SLAC, excluding all other
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(6) USE seeks a unit of all nonprofessional full-time and part-time
permanent and seasonal employees of the University, including all
employees of the Stanford Press not currently represented, but excluding
all nonstudent firemen, all currently represented employees, professional
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(7) WAC contends that elections should be directed in three
separate units: (1) the unit sought by the Fire Fighters, (2) the unit sought
by the Teamsters, and (3) a residual unit of all other employees, excluding
only professional employees and supervisors.
(8) IBEW seeks a unit of all journeymen and apprentice electricians
employed by the University, excluding all other employees.
(9) UE expressed no unit position.
(10) Laborers also took no unit position but indicated its desire to
be on the ballot in any election in an overall unit or for any residual unit
from which one or more crafts have been severed.
(11) The Employer contends that two units are appropriate. One
would be a unit of all nonsupervisory, nonprofessional employees
employed by the University within the State of California, excluding
employees of Stanford Hospital, employees of Stanford University Press
who are currently represented, students, part-time and casual employees,
confidential employees, and guards. The second would be a unit of all
employees of the Stanford University Police Department, excluding all
other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act.
As the foregoing indicates, there is a considerable difference of
opinion among the parties over what constitutes the appropriate unit or
units for purposes of collective bargaining. These positions range in scope
from requests for various types of craft and departmental units to units
encompassing all nonprofessional employees employed by the University.
In such cases, it is not the Board's function to determine^ which unit or
units might be the most appropriate. Rather, the Board's role in such
circumstances is to determine which, if any, of the petitioned-for units can
be considered appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
Accordingly with these considerations in mind, we shall examine the units
requested.
*
As previously indicated, the Teamsters has requested a unit of all
physical plant department employees. The physical plant department is
one of 16 nonacademic departments which arc under the overall control of
the vice president for business affairs. The department performs a myriad
of activities, including the operation of the campus utility systems, the
maintenance of buildings, roads, and grounds, and the furnishing of
audiovisual services. The physical plant department consists of
approximately IH7 employees in 37 different job classifications. Although
the physical plant department has a central headquarters location, most of
the work is performed away from the shop. There is no common
supervision, wages, or hours of work among the employees in the physical
plant department Also many of the other university departments employ
individuals in the same job classifications as those in the physical plant
department,lo and it is not uncommon for employees in the physical plant
department to work in conjunction with employees of similar skills from
other departments. Perhaps even more significant is the fact that these
other departments perform many of the same job functions as the
employees in the physical plant department and, hence, there are only a
few categories of work assignment which are performed exclusively by the
employees in the physical plant department. Accordingly, on the basis of
the foregoing, we conclude that there is no separate identity of interest
among employees of the physical plant department from that of other
employees which would justify a finding that such a unit could be
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
The Teamsters alternative unit position covers a broader grouping of
maintenance personnel.'' While the unit in question is not precisely

defined, it is clear that it would include employees of the physical plant
department and the plant office department at SLAC, 12 pius employees
performing custodial duties at the University. The unit as described covers
employees in some 20 different departments. However, with the possible
exception of the physical plant department, the Teamsters is not seeking
all the employees in any one department. The unit purports to include all
employees performing maintenance type functions at the University, but
specifically excluded from the unit are several categories of employees
whose work is closely related to that of the unit employees. For example,
physical science and engineering technicians repair and calibrate every type
of electronic and mechanical equipment and on many occasions they work
side-by-side with other journeyman craftsmen who are part of the
proposed Teamsters maintenance unit. Also specifically excluded are the
laboratory mechanicians who possess the same basic skills as the
journeyman mechanics but specialize in the assembly, installation, and
repair of various types of laboratory equipment. Many of the job functions
performed by these laboratory support people are identical with those
performed by the journeyman craftsmen in the Finally, the
Teamsters would include employees performing custodial services, but it
would exclude the food service employees whose interests are closely allied
with those of the custodial employees. A large percentage of the custodial
employees share common supervision and have day-to-day contact with the
food service employees. Furthermore, during the summer months when
food services are reduced, approximately one-half of the food service
employees reiain employment by transferring over to custodial jobs.
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance unit
sought by the Teamsters is too limited in scope to constitute an
appropriate unit of maintenance employees.! 4 Accordingly, as neither of
the Teamsters' requested units can be found to be appropriate for purposes
of collective bargaining, we shall dismiss the petition filed in Case
20-RC-9202.
*
CSEA-SEA has petitioned for a unit of employees engaged in
service, maintenance, and technical positions. The unit as defined would
cover employees at both the main campus and SLAC and would include all
maintenance classifications, all laboratory support personnel, all food
service and custodial employees, and graphic technicians and proofreaders
at Stanford University Press.'s Specifically excluded from the unit are the
police and fire departments, each of which is being sought separately by
other Unions, a ll office clerical employees, and all library personnel, as
well as the general categories of managerial and professional employees,
guards, and all supervisors as defined in the Act. Both the Employer and
USE contend that this unit is too limited in scope and that the appropriate
unit should include all of the University's nonprofessional and
nonsupervisory employees.
There is considerable record testimony which would lend support to
a conclusion that an overall unit of nonprofessional and nonsupervisory
employees would be appropriate. For example, the University's personnel
and employment policies are for the most part standardized and most
university employees are covered by the same wage scale and program of
benefits.' 7 At the main campus, employees are centrally hired through the
University's personnel office, and, when a job opening occurs in a
particular department, employees throughout the University are permitted
to bid on the opening.
On the other hand, however, the unit being sought by CSEA-SEA is
essentially a grouping of all employees engaged in maintenance type
functions, and the Board has on several occasions held that an overall unit
of maintenance employees can be appropriate under certain
circumstances. as our previous findings indicate, the maintenance
functions at the University arc highly integrated, and there can be no
doubt that all the University's maintenance employees share a close
community of interest. There would also appear to be ample justification
for including in such a unit the various nonmaintenance classifications
sought by CSEA-SEA. Thus the custodians, although not classified as
maintenance employees by the University, are traditionally included in
maintenance-type units under existing Board policy. In the circumstances
present here, any action involving the custodians requires that the same
action be taken with respect to food service employees because of the close
community of interest and interchangeability in job functions among
employees in the two categories. The graphics and publications employees
whom CSEA-SEA would also include would most properly belong in units
covering employees at Press. However, in view of the fact that these
employees have been excluded from the existing units at Press and now
constitute a residual group which no union seeks to represent separately,

13 Th e same situation is presented with respect to maintenance functions at
SLAC. The Teamsters would include the plant office department which
performs a wide variety of maintenance functions, but exclude the plant
engineering department which performs maintenance services for the
various research groups. However, in many cases, employees from both
departments work together in performing a particular job function.
4 On the basis of this same evidence, we conclude that the units urged by
Machinists and IBEW are also inappropriate for purposes of collective
bargaining. The Machinists unit of maintenance technicians would
exclude general maintenance employees whom we have found have a
close community of interest with the technicians performing laboratory
support functions. IBEW's request for a separate craft unit of
electricians cannot be sustained in light of the evidence demonstrating
that the University's maintenance operations produce an overlap in craft
skills and a commingling of employees performing craft functions.

their inclusion in CSEA-SEA's unit would not be improper. Similar
considerations support CSEA-SEA's claims that the four audio-visual
operators be included in the unit. Although the record indicates that, due
to their separate and unique functions, the audio-visual operators do not
have a close community of interest with any other group of employees,
their function is to provide highly technical services to the various
departments, and hence they would appear likely to share common
interests with the laboratory support technicians being sought by
CSEA-SEA.
The Employer contends that CSEA-SEA should not be permitted to
exclude the University's clerical employees from their unit because the
clericals have a close community of interest with other university
employees, and in the past CSEA-SEA has attempted to bargain and serve
as spokesman for all university employees including the clericals. We J j
not agree. While it cannot be denied that all university employees sha.e
certain common interests, the Board's practice is not to include officc
clericals in what is essentially a maintenance unit because the two groups

University Police Department, excluding all other employees and
supervisors as defined in the Act. The police department employees are
classified together with firemen as protective services personnel, and both
the police and fire department are located in the same building. At the

The fire department employees like the police are classified by the
University as protective services personnel,24 and both departments arc
housed together in the same building on the main campus. The fire
department employees perform the usual fire fighting and fire prevention
services required of firemen in general. Firemen perform work exclusively
for cheir department, and there is no evidence of any interchange between
fire department employees and employees of other departments. No other
university personnel perform what might be termed a similar or
comparable function.
Although firemen enjoy the same general employee benefits as other
university personnel, their wage scale is determined on a separate basis and
is designed to be comparable with the wage rates received by firemen in the
surrounding communities.2s
Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, the absence ot any
bargaining history, and the fact that no labor organization seeks to
represent firemen in a broader unit, we find that a separate unit of firemen
is appropriate for purposes of bargaining.
The Employer also contends that fire captains are supervisors within
the meaning of the Act and therefore should be excluded from the unit.
The record evidence shows that with respect to organization the fire
department operates under the direction and control of the fire chief.
Reporting directly to the fire chief are two assistant chiefs who in turn arc
assisted by two battalion chiefs. The fire chief, assistant fire chiefs, and
battalion chiefs are all admitted supervisors. Below the battalion chicfs are
eight fire captains and approximately 35 firemen. The tire captains, whose
status is in dispute, have no authority to hire or discharge employees or
effectively to recommend such action. If a fireman commits an infraction
which is in direct contravention of department rules, the fire captain can
take action which may result in the employee's suspension; however, it
would appear that all such disciplinary matters arc subject to an
independent investigation and review and that the (ire captain has no
definitive role to play in the ultimate resolution of such matters. The fire
captains a.re directly responsible for the training of firemen and the upkeep
and maintenance of the department's fire equipment. Tire captains also
have the authority to direct fire fighting operations in the rare instances
when no superior officer is present. However, in carrying out this
responsibility, fire captains follow the routine operating procedures of the
department and have little opportunity to exercise independent judgment.
Accordingly, we find that the fire captains are more in the nature ol
leadmen than supervisors, and, therefore, we shall include them in the unit.
Finally, an issue is also raised with respect to the Fire l ighters'
failure to include all of the fire department's nonsupcrvisory personnel in
the unit. Although the record is somewhat Vague as to what, if any,
additional personnel arc administratively classified as part of the fire
department, the Employer contends that certain administrative and clerical
personnel located in the fire department headquarters building should he
included, as well as all student firemen. 26 We do not agree. The craft-type
unit sought here by the Fire Fighters is properly limited to those possessing
the skills aind exercising the responsibilities typically associated with
firemen. Accordingly, we shall exclude the administrative-clerical personnel
and student firemen from the unit.
*
In light of our findings that separate units of police and fire
department employees are appropriate, we now also find that the grouping
continued on next page

20 The only exceptions have been Stanford's recognition of various printing
trades unions as craft representatives of certain employees at Press and
its past recognition of the Meatcutters Union as representative for
employees of the University's commissary. The commissary as such is no
longer in existence.
There is no merit to the Employer's contention that it should have been
permitted to demonstrate that the sentiment among the office clericals
was in favor of vheir inclusion in any broad grouping of university
employees. The Board does not consider the subjective wishes of
employees in making its unit determinations. It is only after the
appropriate unit determinations are made that the Board has in some
instances permitted employees to determine their unit placement
through the means of a self-determination election.
22 While the overall unit urged by the Employer and USE might also be
appropriate, there is no labor organization eligible to proceed to an
election in this unit. No union has petitioned for an election in this unit,
and, although USE, as an intervenor, has requested an election in such a
unit, USE does not have u sufficient showing of interest to permit the
Board to treat USE as a cross-petitioner and direct an election in this
unit.

DECISION, ORDER, AND DIRECTION OE ELECTIONS
Upon petitions duly filed under Section 9(c) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, a hearing was held before Hearing Officers
Douglas H. Barton and Walter L. Kintz. Following the hearing and
pursuant to Section 102.67 of the National Labor Relations Board Rules
and Regulations, Series 8, as amended, and by direction of the Regional
Director for Region 20, this proceeding was transferred to the National
Labor Relations Board for decision. Thereafter, briefs were Filed with the
Board by the Teamsters, the Fire l ighters, the Police Officers, CSEA-SEA,
USE, and the Employer.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(b) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, the National Labor Relations Board has
delegated its authority in this proceeding to a three-member panel.
The Board has reviewed the rulings of the Hearing Officers made at
the hearing and finds that they are free from prejudicial error. They are
hereby affirmed.
*
Upon the entire record in this proceeding, the Board finds:
1. The Employer, Leland Stanford Jr. University, is a private
nonprofit institution of higher learning which was founded under a trust
agreement executed in 1885 and thereafter confirmed in the constitution
of the State of California. Its operating income for the fiscal year
ending August 31, 1969, was $150,610,560, of which approximately
$112,000,000 came from sources outside the State of California. During
this same period, it purchased goods and services valued at approximately
$48 million, and, of this sum, approximately $9 million involved
expenditures outside the State of California.
The undisputed evidence shows that the Employer meets the
jurisdictional standard for colleges and universities set forth in Section
103.1 of the Board's Rules and Regulations. Accordingly, we find that the
Employer is engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Act, and it
will effectuate the policies of the Act to assert jurisdiction herein.
2. We find that the Petitioners and Intervenors involved in this
proceeding are labor organizations seeking to represent certain employees
of the Employer.'
3. A question affecting commerce exists concerning the
representation of certain employees of the Employer within the meaning
of Sections 9(c)( 1) and 2(6) and (7) of the Act.
4. Stanford's main campus is located on the San Francisco
Peninsula about 30 miles south of San Francisco, California, and consists
of 1,150 contiguous acres that are not part of any municipality. Stanford
also uses for academic purposes a 4,000 acre site approximately 2 miles
from the main campus at which the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center is
located. The University is made up of approximately 218 academic and
nonacademic departments and major subdepartments which are under the
overall control of the University's president and five vice presidents.
Stanford employs approximately 7,000 individuals, included among which
are 1,250 faculty members, 2,000 supervisory or professional employees,
2,200 clericals, and 1,500 employees in maintenance, service, or technical
All but about 50 of these employees perform their duties
and functions at locations on the San Francisco Peninsula.
*
At issue in this proceeding are the nonsupervisory and
nonprofessional employees employed by Stanford, including employees
employed at Stanford University Press and Stanford Hospital. No party
seeks to include faculty members or professional employees of the
University in any of the proposed units. At the hearing the following unit
positions were urged by the respective parties:
(1) The Teamsters seeks a unit of all physical plant department
employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and supervisors as
defined in the Act. In the event the Board finds such a unit to be
inappropriate, the Teamsters has requested an alternative unit comprised of
all maintenance employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and
supervisors.
(2) The Fire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain.
(3) The Police Officers has requested a unit of all employees of the
Stanford University Police Department, excluding all other employees, and
supervisors as defined in the Act.
(4) CSEA-SEA seeks a unit of all employees engaged in service,
maintenance, and technical positions, excluding firemen, clerical
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(5) Machinists seeks a unit of all laboratory mechanicians., physical
science and engineering technicians, and maintenance machinists employed
at the Employer's main campus and at SLAC, excluding all other
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(6) USE seeks a unit of all nonprofessional full-time and part-time
permanent and seasonal employees of the University, including all
employees of the Stanford Press not currently represented, but excluding
all nonstudent firemen, all currently represented employees, professional
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(7) WAC contends that elections should be directed in three
separate units: (1) the unit sought by the Fire Fighters, (2) the unit sought
by the Teamsters, and (3) a residual unit of all other employees, excluding
only professional employees and supervisors.
(8) IBEW seeks a unit of all journeymen and apprentice electricians
employed by the University, excluding all other employees.
(9) UE expressed no unit position.
(10) Laborers also took no unit position but indicated its desire to
be on the ballot in any election in an overall unit or for any residual unit
from which one or more crafts have been severed.
(11) The Employer contends that two units are appropriate. One
would be a unit of all nonsupervisory, nonprofessional employees
employed by the University within the State of California, excluding
employees of Stanford Hospital, employees of Stanford University Press
who are currently represented, students, part-time and casual employees,
confidential employees, and guards. The second would be a unit of all
employees of the Stanford University Police Department, excluding all
other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act.
As the foregoing indicates, there is a considerable difference of
opinion among the parties over what constitutes the appropriate unit or
units for purposes of collective bargaining. These positions range in scope
from requests for various types of craft and departmental units to units
encompassing all nonprofessional employees employed by the University.
In such cases, it is not the Board's function to determine^ which unit or
units might be the most appropriate. Rather, the Board's role in such
circumstances is to determine which, if any, of the petitioned-for units can
be considered appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
Accordingly with these considerations in mind, we shall examine the units
requested.
*
As previously indicated, the Teamsters has requested a unit of all
physical plant department employees. The physical plant department is
one of 16 nonacademic departments which arc under the overall control of
the vice president for business affairs. The department performs a myriad
of activities, including the operation of the campus utility systems, the
maintenance of buildings, roads, and grounds, and the furnishing of
audiovisual services. The physical plant department consists of
approximately IH7 employees in 37 different job classifications. Although
the physical plant department has a central headquarters location, most of
the work is performed away from the shop. There is no common
supervision, wages, or hours of work among the employees in the physical
plant department Also many of the other university departments employ
individuals in the same job classifications as those in the physical plant
department,lo and it is not uncommon for employees in the physical plant
department to work in conjunction with employees of similar skills from
other departments. Perhaps even more significant is the fact that these
other departments perform many of the same job functions as the
employees in the physical plant department and, hence, there are only a
few categories of work assignment which are performed exclusively by the
employees in the physical plant department. Accordingly, on the basis of
the foregoing, we conclude that there is no separate identity of interest
among employees of the physical plant department from that of other
employees which would justify a finding that such a unit could be
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
The Teamsters alternative unit position covers a broader grouping of
maintenance personnel.'' While the unit in question is not precisely

defined, it is clear that it would include employees of the physical plant
department and the plant office department at SLAC, 12 pius employees
performing custodial duties at the University. The unit as described covers
employees in some 20 different departments. However, with the possible
exception of the physical plant department, the Teamsters is not seeking
all the employees in any one department. The unit purports to include all
employees performing maintenance type functions at the University, but
specifically excluded from the unit are several categories of employees
whose work is closely related to that of the unit employees. For example,
physical science and engineering technicians repair and calibrate every type
of electronic and mechanical equipment and on many occasions they work
side-by-side with other journeyman craftsmen who are part of the
proposed Teamsters maintenance unit. Also specifically excluded are the
laboratory mechanicians who possess the same basic skills as the
journeyman mechanics but specialize in the assembly, installation, and
repair of various types of laboratory equipment. Many of the job functions
performed by these laboratory support people are identical with those
performed by the journeyman craftsmen in the Finally, the
Teamsters would include employees performing custodial services, but it
would exclude the food service employees whose interests are closely allied
with those of the custodial employees. A large percentage of the custodial
employees share common supervision and have day-to-day contact with the
food service employees. Furthermore, during the summer months when
food services are reduced, approximately one-half of the food service
employees reiain employment by transferring over to custodial jobs.
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance unit
sought by the Teamsters is too limited in scope to constitute an
appropriate unit of maintenance employees.! 4 Accordingly, as neither of
the Teamsters' requested units can be found to be appropriate for purposes
of collective bargaining, we shall dismiss the petition filed in Case
20-RC-9202.
*
CSEA-SEA has petitioned for a unit of employees engaged in
service, maintenance, and technical positions. The unit as defined would
cover employees at both the main campus and SLAC and would include all
maintenance classifications, all laboratory support personnel, all food
service and custodial employees, and graphic technicians and proofreaders
at Stanford University Press.'s Specifically excluded from the unit are the
police and fire departments, each of which is being sought separately by
other Unions, a ll office clerical employees, and all library personnel, as
well as the general categories of managerial and professional employees,
guards, and all supervisors as defined in the Act. Both the Employer and
USE contend that this unit is too limited in scope and that the appropriate
unit should include all of the University's nonprofessional and
nonsupervisory employees.
There is considerable record testimony which would lend support to
a conclusion that an overall unit of nonprofessional and nonsupervisory
employees would be appropriate. For example, the University's personnel
and employment policies are for the most part standardized and most
university employees are covered by the same wage scale and program of
benefits.' 7 At the main campus, employees are centrally hired through the
University's personnel office, and, when a job opening occurs in a
particular department, employees throughout the University are permitted
to bid on the opening.
On the other hand, however, the unit being sought by CSEA-SEA is
essentially a grouping of all employees engaged in maintenance type
functions, and the Board has on several occasions held that an overall unit
of maintenance employees can be appropriate under certain
circumstances. as our previous findings indicate, the maintenance
functions at the University arc highly integrated, and there can be no
doubt that all the University's maintenance employees share a close
community of interest. There would also appear to be ample justification
for including in such a unit the various nonmaintenance classifications
sought by CSEA-SEA. Thus the custodians, although not classified as
maintenance employees by the University, are traditionally included in
maintenance-type units under existing Board policy. In the circumstances
present here, any action involving the custodians requires that the same
action be taken with respect to food service employees because of the close
community of interest and interchangeability in job functions among
employees in the two categories. The graphics and publications employees
whom CSEA-SEA would also include would most properly belong in units
covering employees at Press. However, in view of the fact that these
employees have been excluded from the existing units at Press and now
constitute a residual group which no union seeks to represent separately,

Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 332, hereinafter IBEW;

®The Employer and USE each filed motions to correct the transcript. USE
also filed objections to the Employer's motion to correct the transcript.
No responses to the motions and objections have been received from any
other party to the proceeding. Accordingly, to the extent that USE and
the Employer's motions to correct the transcript are not in conflict, they
are hereby granted. In all other respects, the motions are hereby denied.
7 CSE A-SEA contends that USE and WAC are a single entity and that their
representations that they are separate organizations should disqualify
them from participating in this proceeding. CSEA-SEA also contends that
WAC does not qualify as a labor organization within the meaning of
Section 2(5) of the Act. We find no merit in these contentions. The
record evidence shows that, although WAC was at one time a subgroup
within USE, the two organizations have separated over a policy
disagreement, and USE and WAC now function as separate independent
entities. The record evidence further shows that each of these
organizations claims to represent certain employees of the Employer for
purposes of improving wages, hours, and terms and conditions of
employment. Accordingly, we conclude that USE and WAC are separate
entities and that each qualifies as a labor organization within the meaning
of Section 2(5) of the Act.

However, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, we assume that the
Teamsters has not abandoned this unit position.
plant office department performs general maintenance for the
SLAC complex.
13 Th e same situation is presented with respect to maintenance functions at
SLAC. The Teamsters would include the plant office department which
performs a wide variety of maintenance functions, but exclude the plant
engineering department which performs maintenance services for the
various research groups. However, in many cases, employees from both
departments work together in performing a particular job function.
4 On the basis of this same evidence, we conclude that the units urged by
Machinists and IBEW are also inappropriate for purposes of collective
bargaining. The Machinists unit of maintenance technicians would
exclude general maintenance employees whom we have found have a
close community of interest with the technicians performing laboratory
support functions. IBEW's request for a separate craft unit of
electricians cannot be sustained in light of the evidence demonstrating
that the University's maintenance operations produce an overlap in craft
skills and a commingling of employees performing craft functions.
University Press, hereinafter referred to as Press, has
approximately 70 employees, the majority of whom are represented by
various printing trades unions. It would appear that the only
unrepresented employees at Press are the graphic technicians and
proofreaders.
'®lt would appear from the record that CSEA-SEA would be willing to
include police and firemen in their unit if the Board found that separate
units of these employees would not be appropriate.

their inclusion in CSEA-SEA's unit would not be improper. Similar
considerations support CSEA-SEA's claims that the four audio-visual
operators be included in the unit. Although the record indicates that, due
to their separate and unique functions, the audio-visual operators do not
have a close community of interest with any other group of employees,
their function is to provide highly technical services to the various
departments, and hence they would appear likely to share common
interests with the laboratory support technicians being sought by
CSEA-SEA.
The Employer contends that CSEA-SEA should not be permitted to
exclude the University's clerical employees from their unit because the
clericals have a close community of interest with other university
employees, and in the past CSEA-SEA has attempted to bargain and serve
as spokesman for all university employees including the clericals. We J j
not agree. While it cannot be denied that all university employees sha.e
certain common interests, the Board's practice is not to include officc
clericals in what is essentially a maintenance unit because the two groups
do not share the same interests. 19 Nc>r do we attach any special
significance to the fact that in the past CSEA-SEA attempted to speak for
all university employees. No one disputes the fact that Stanford has
generally refused to recognize any organization as the representative of its
Over the years, Stanford's policy has been to meet with
employees individually or in groups to discuss any matters affecting the
employer-employee relationship. In several cases, these meetings between
Stanford and its employees produced changes in the University's policies
and practices. However, it seems clear from the record evidence that
Stanford steadfastly refused to confer or in any way deal with CSEA-SEA
or any other labor organization as the representative of the University's
employees. Accordingly, we find a complete absence of any bargaining
history affecting the employees here in question.2l
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance-service
unit sought by CSEA-SEA could be depending on the
disposition of the petitions pending before us requesting separate units for
police and firemen. Accordingly, we will reserve final judgment on the
appropriateness of CSEA-SEA's unit until we have ruled on the unit
requests by the Police Officers and Fire Fighters.
*
The Police Officers seeks a unit of all employees of the Stanford
University Police Department, excluding all other employees and
supervisors as defined in the Act. The police department employees are
classified together with firemen as protective services personnel, and both
the police and fire department are located in the same building. At the
hearing, all parties except WAC agreed that the Stanford police exercised
the typical security and protection functions required of policemen in
general and that a separate unit of police department employees would be
appropriate. WAC did not challenge the fact that the police department
employees here perform regular police duties, but it would nevertheless
include them in a residual unit with other classifications of employees. In
view of the undisputed evidence that police department employees are
guards within the meaning of the Act, the Board is precluded from finding
appropriate a unit which groups guards with other employces.23
Accordingly, as no other issues are raised with respect to this unit, we find
that a unit of all employees of the Stanford University Police Department,
excluding all other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act, is
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
*
The Eire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain. The Employer contends that the
firemen do not share a separate community of interest apart from other
employees. None of the other Unions involved in this proceeding seeks to
represent firemen either separately or as part of a larger unit.
The fire department employees like the police are classified by the
University as protective services personnel,24 and both departments arc
housed together in the same building on the main campus. The fire
department employees perform the usual fire fighting and fire prevention
services required of firemen in general. Firemen perform work exclusively
for cheir department, and there is no evidence of any interchange between
fire department employees and employees of other departments. No other
university personnel perform what might be termed a similar or
comparable function.
Although firemen enjoy the same general employee benefits as other
university personnel, their wage scale is determined on a separate basis and
is designed to be comparable with the wage rates received by firemen in the
surrounding communities.2s
Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, the absence ot any
bargaining history, and the fact that no labor organization seeks to
represent firemen in a broader unit, we find that a separate unit of firemen
is appropriate for purposes of bargaining.
The Employer also contends that fire captains are supervisors within
the meaning of the Act and therefore should be excluded from the unit.
The record evidence shows that with respect to organization the fire
department operates under the direction and control of the fire chief.
Reporting directly to the fire chief are two assistant chiefs who in turn arc
assisted by two battalion chiefs. The fire chief, assistant fire chiefs, and
battalion chiefs are all admitted supervisors. Below the battalion chicfs are
eight fire captains and approximately 35 firemen. The tire captains, whose
status is in dispute, have no authority to hire or discharge employees or
effectively to recommend such action. If a fireman commits an infraction
which is in direct contravention of department rules, the fire captain can
take action which may result in the employee's suspension; however, it
would appear that all such disciplinary matters arc subject to an
independent investigation and review and that the (ire captain has no
definitive role to play in the ultimate resolution of such matters. The fire
captains a.re directly responsible for the training of firemen and the upkeep
and maintenance of the department's fire equipment. Tire captains also
have the authority to direct fire fighting operations in the rare instances
when no superior officer is present. However, in carrying out this
responsibility, fire captains follow the routine operating procedures of the
department and have little opportunity to exercise independent judgment.
Accordingly, we find that the fire captains are more in the nature ol
leadmen than supervisors, and, therefore, we shall include them in the unit.
Finally, an issue is also raised with respect to the Fire l ighters'
failure to include all of the fire department's nonsupcrvisory personnel in
the unit. Although the record is somewhat Vague as to what, if any,
additional personnel arc administratively classified as part of the fire
department, the Employer contends that certain administrative and clerical
personnel located in the fire department headquarters building should he

unit sought here by the Fire Fighters is properly limited to those possessing
the skills aind exercising the responsibilities typically associated with
firemen. Accordingly, we shall exclude the administrative-clerical personnel
and student firemen from the unit.

department employees are appropriate, we now also find that the grouping

ending August 31, 1969, was $150,610,560, of which approximately
$112,000,000 came from sources outside the State of California. During
this same period, it purchased goods and services valued at approximately
$48 million, and, of this sum, approximately $9 million involved
expenditures outside the State of California.
The undisputed evidence shows that the Employer meets the
jurisdictional standard for colleges and universities set forth in Section
103.1 of the Board's Rules and Regulations. Accordingly, we find that the
Employer is engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Act, and it
will effectuate the policies of the Act to assert jurisdiction herein.
2. We find that the Petitioners and Intervenors involved in this
proceeding are labor organizations seeking to represent certain employees
of the Employer.'
3. A question affecting commerce exists concerning the
representation of certain employees of the Employer within the meaning
of Sections 9(c)( 1) and 2(6) and (7) of the Act.
4. Stanford's main campus is located on the San Francisco
Peninsula about 30 miles south of San Francisco, California, and consists
of 1,150 contiguous acres that are not part of any municipality. Stanford
also uses for academic purposes a 4,000 acre site approximately 2 miles
from the main campus at which the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center is
located. The University is made up of approximately 218 academic and
nonacademic departments and major subdepartments which are under the
overall control of the University's president and five vice presidents.
Stanford employs approximately 7,000 individuals, included among which
are 1,250 faculty members, 2,000 supervisory or professional employees,
2,200 clericals, and 1,500 employees in maintenance, service, or technical
All but about 50 of these employees perform their duties
and functions at locations on the San Francisco Peninsula.
*
At issue in this proceeding are the nonsupervisory and
nonprofessional employees employed by Stanford, including employees
employed at Stanford University Press and Stanford Hospital. No party
seeks to include faculty members or professional employees of the
University in any of the proposed units. At the hearing the following unit
positions were urged by the respective parties:
(1) The Teamsters seeks a unit of all physical plant department
employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and supervisors as
defined in the Act. In the event the Board finds such a unit to be
inappropriate, the Teamsters has requested an alternative unit comprised of
all maintenance employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and
supervisors.
(2) The Fire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain.
(3) The Police Officers has requested a unit of all employees of the
Stanford University Police Department, excluding all other employees, and
supervisors as defined in the Act.
(4) CSEA-SEA seeks a unit of all employees engaged in service,
maintenance, and technical positions, excluding firemen, clerical
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(5) Machinists seeks a unit of all laboratory mechanicians., physical
science and engineering technicians, and maintenance machinists employed
at the Employer's main campus and at SLAC, excluding all other
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(6) USE seeks a unit of all nonprofessional full-time and part-time
permanent and seasonal employees of the University, including all
employees of the Stanford Press not currently represented, but excluding
all nonstudent firemen, all currently represented employees, professional
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(7) WAC contends that elections should be directed in three
separate units: (1) the unit sought by the Fire Fighters, (2) the unit sought
by the Teamsters, and (3) a residual unit of all other employees, excluding
only professional employees and supervisors.
(8) IBEW seeks a unit of all journeymen and apprentice electricians
employed by the University, excluding all other employees.
(9) UE expressed no unit position.
(10) Laborers also took no unit position but indicated its desire to
be on the ballot in any election in an overall unit or for any residual unit
from which one or more crafts have been severed.
(11) The Employer contends that two units are appropriate. One
would be a unit of all nonsupervisory, nonprofessional employees
employed by the University within the State of California, excluding
employees of Stanford Hospital, employees of Stanford University Press
who are currently represented, students, part-time and casual employees,
confidential employees, and guards. The second would be a unit of all
employees of the Stanford University Police Department, excluding all
other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act.
As the foregoing indicates, there is a considerable difference of
opinion among the parties over what constitutes the appropriate unit or
units for purposes of collective bargaining. These positions range in scope
from requests for various types of craft and departmental units to units
encompassing all nonprofessional employees employed by the University.
In such cases, it is not the Board's function to determine^ which unit or
units might be the most appropriate. Rather, the Board's role in such
circumstances is to determine which, if any, of the petitioned-for units can
be considered appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
Accordingly with these considerations in mind, we shall examine the units
requested.
*
As previously indicated, the Teamsters has requested a unit of all
physical plant department employees. The physical plant department is
one of 16 nonacademic departments which arc under the overall control of
the vice president for business affairs. The department performs a myriad
of activities, including the operation of the campus utility systems, the
maintenance of buildings, roads, and grounds, and the furnishing of
audiovisual services. The physical plant department consists of
approximately IH7 employees in 37 different job classifications. Although
the physical plant department has a central headquarters location, most of
the work is performed away from the shop. There is no common
supervision, wages, or hours of work among the employees in the physical
plant department Also many of the other university departments employ
individuals in the same job classifications as those in the physical plant
department,lo and it is not uncommon for employees in the physical plant
department to work in conjunction with employees of similar skills from
other departments. Perhaps even more significant is the fact that these
other departments perform many of the same job functions as the
employees in the physical plant department and, hence, there are only a
few categories of work assignment which are performed exclusively by the
employees in the physical plant department. Accordingly, on the basis of
the foregoing, we conclude that there is no separate identity of interest
among employees of the physical plant department from that of other
employees which would justify a finding that such a unit could be
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
The Teamsters alternative unit position covers a broader grouping of
maintenance personnel.'' While the unit in question is not precisely

defined, it is clear that it would include employees of the physical plant
department and the plant office department at SLAC, 12 pius employees
performing custodial duties at the University. The unit as described covers
employees in some 20 different departments. However, with the possible
exception of the physical plant department, the Teamsters is not seeking
all the employees in any one department. The unit purports to include all
employees performing maintenance type functions at the University, but
specifically excluded from the unit are several categories of employees
whose work is closely related to that of the unit employees. For example,
physical science and engineering technicians repair and calibrate every type
of electronic and mechanical equipment and on many occasions they work
side-by-side with other journeyman craftsmen who are part of the
proposed Teamsters maintenance unit. Also specifically excluded are the
laboratory mechanicians who possess the same basic skills as the
journeyman mechanics but specialize in the assembly, installation, and
repair of various types of laboratory equipment. Many of the job functions
performed by these laboratory support people are identical with those
performed by the journeyman craftsmen in the Finally, the
Teamsters would include employees performing custodial services, but it
would exclude the food service employees whose interests are closely allied
with those of the custodial employees. A large percentage of the custodial
employees share common supervision and have day-to-day contact with the
food service employees. Furthermore, during the summer months when
food services are reduced, approximately one-half of the food service
employees reiain employment by transferring over to custodial jobs.
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance unit
sought by the Teamsters is too limited in scope to constitute an
appropriate unit of maintenance employees.! 4 Accordingly, as neither of
the Teamsters' requested units can be found to be appropriate for purposes
of collective bargaining, we shall dismiss the petition filed in Case
20-RC-9202.
*
CSEA-SEA has petitioned for a unit of employees engaged in
service, maintenance, and technical positions. The unit as defined would
cover employees at both the main campus and SLAC and would include all
maintenance classifications, all laboratory support personnel, all food
service and custodial employees, and graphic technicians and proofreaders
at Stanford University Press.'s Specifically excluded from the unit are the
police and fire departments, each of which is being sought separately by
other Unions, a ll office clerical employees, and all library personnel, as
well as the general categories of managerial and professional employees,
guards, and all supervisors as defined in the Act. Both the Employer and
USE contend that this unit is too limited in scope and that the appropriate
unit should include all of the University's nonprofessional and
nonsupervisory employees.
There is considerable record testimony which would lend support to
a conclusion that an overall unit of nonprofessional and nonsupervisory
employees would be appropriate. For example, the University's personnel
and employment policies are for the most part standardized and most
university employees are covered by the same wage scale and program of
benefits.' 7 At the main campus, employees are centrally hired through the
University's personnel office, and, when a job opening occurs in a
particular department, employees throughout the University are permitted
to bid on the opening.
On the other hand, however, the unit being sought by CSEA-SEA is
essentially a grouping of all employees engaged in maintenance type
functions, and the Board has on several occasions held that an overall unit
of maintenance employees can be appropriate under certain
circumstances. as our previous findings indicate, the maintenance
functions at the University arc highly integrated, and there can be no
doubt that all the University's maintenance employees share a close
community of interest. There would also appear to be ample justification
for including in such a unit the various nonmaintenance classifications
sought by CSEA-SEA. Thus the custodians, although not classified as
maintenance employees by the University, are traditionally included in
maintenance-type units under existing Board policy. In the circumstances
present here, any action involving the custodians requires that the same
action be taken with respect to food service employees because of the close
community of interest and interchangeability in job functions among
employees in the two categories. The graphics and publications employees
whom CSEA-SEA would also include would most properly belong in units
covering employees at Press. However, in view of the fact that these
employees have been excluded from the existing units at Press and now
constitute a residual group which no union seeks to represent separately,

®The Employer and USE each filed motions to correct the transcript. USE
also filed objections to the Employer's motion to correct the transcript.
No responses to the motions and objections have been received from any
other party to the proceeding. Accordingly, to the extent that USE and
the Employer's motions to correct the transcript are not in conflict, they
are hereby granted. In all other respects, the motions are hereby denied.
7 CSE A-SEA contends that USE and WAC are a single entity and that their
representations that they are separate organizations should disqualify
them from participating in this proceeding. CSEA-SEA also contends that
WAC does not qualify as a labor organization within the meaning of
Section 2(5) of the Act. We find no merit in these contentions. The
record evidence shows that, although WAC was at one time a subgroup
within USE, the two organizations have separated over a policy
disagreement, and USE and WAC now function as separate independent
entities. The record evidence further shows that each of these
organizations claims to represent certain employees of the Employer for
purposes of improving wages, hours, and terms and conditions of
employment. Accordingly, we conclude that USE and WAC are separate
entities and that each qualifies as a labor organization within the meaning
of Section 2(5) of the Act.

However, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, we assume that the
Teamsters has not abandoned this unit position.
plant office department performs general maintenance for the
SLAC complex.
13 Th e same situation is presented with respect to maintenance functions at
SLAC. The Teamsters would include the plant office department which
performs a wide variety of maintenance functions, but exclude the plant
engineering department which performs maintenance services for the
various research groups. However, in many cases, employees from both
departments work together in performing a particular job function.
4 On the basis of this same evidence, we conclude that the units urged by
Machinists and IBEW are also inappropriate for purposes of collective
bargaining. The Machinists unit of maintenance technicians would
exclude general maintenance employees whom we have found have a
close community of interest with the technicians performing laboratory
support functions. IBEW's request for a separate craft unit of
electricians cannot be sustained in light of the evidence demonstrating
that the University's maintenance operations produce an overlap in craft
skills and a commingling of employees performing craft functions.
University Press, hereinafter referred to as Press, has
approximately 70 employees, the majority of whom are represented by
various printing trades unions. It would appear that the only
unrepresented employees at Press are the graphic technicians and
proofreaders.
'®lt would appear from the record that CSEA-SEA would be willing to
include police and firemen in their unit if the Board found that separate
units of these employees would not be appropriate.

19 While some of the University's clericals may not be performing typical
office clerical functions, the record evidence does not establish tf at any
identifiable segment of the clericals share a closer community of interest

their inclusion in CSEA-SEA's unit would not be improper. Similar
considerations support CSEA-SEA's claims that the four audio-visual
operators be included in the unit. Although the record indicates that, due
to their separate and unique functions, the audio-visual operators do not
have a close community of interest with any other group of employees,
their function is to provide highly technical services to the various
departments, and hence they would appear likely to share common
interests with the laboratory support technicians being sought by
CSEA-SEA.
The Employer contends that CSEA-SEA should not be permitted to
exclude the University's clerical employees from their unit because the
clericals have a close community of interest with other university
employees, and in the past CSEA-SEA has attempted to bargain and serve
as spokesman for all university employees including the clericals. We J j
not agree. While it cannot be denied that all university employees sha.e
certain common interests, the Board's practice is not to include officc
clericals in what is essentially a maintenance unit because the two groups
do not share the same interests. 19 Nc>r do we attach any special
significance to the fact that in the past CSEA-SEA attempted to speak for
all university employees. No one disputes the fact that Stanford has
generally refused to recognize any organization as the representative of its
Over the years, Stanford's policy has been to meet with
employees individually or in groups to discuss any matters affecting the
employer-employee relationship. In several cases, these meetings between
Stanford and its employees produced changes in the University's policies
and practices. However, it seems clear from the record evidence that
Stanford steadfastly refused to confer or in any way deal with CSEA-SEA
or any other labor organization as the representative of the University's
employees. Accordingly, we find a complete absence of any bargaining
history affecting the employees here in question.2l
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance-service
unit sought by CSEA-SEA could be depending on the
disposition of the petitions pending before us requesting separate units for
police and firemen. Accordingly, we will reserve final judgment on the
appropriateness of CSEA-SEA's unit until we have ruled on the unit
requests by the Police Officers and Fire Fighters.
*
The Police Officers seeks a unit of all employees of the Stanford
University Police Department, excluding all other employees and
supervisors as defined in the Act. The police department employees are
classified together with firemen as protective services personnel, and both
the police and fire department are located in the same building. At the
hearing, all parties except WAC agreed that the Stanford police exercised
the typical security and protection functions required of policemen in
general and that a separate unit of police department employees would be
appropriate. WAC did not challenge the fact that the police department
employees here perform regular police duties, but it would nevertheless
include them in a residual unit with other classifications of employees. In
view of the undisputed evidence that police department employees are
guards within the meaning of the Act, the Board is precluded from finding
appropriate a unit which groups guards with other employces.23
Accordingly, as no other issues are raised with respect to this unit, we find
that a unit of all employees of the Stanford University Police Department,
excluding all other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act, is
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
*
The Eire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain. The Employer contends that the
firemen do not share a separate community of interest apart from other
employees. None of the other Unions involved in this proceeding seeks to
represent firemen either separately or as part of a larger unit.
The fire department employees like the police are classified by the
University as protective services personnel,24 and both departments arc
housed together in the same building on the main campus. The fire
department employees perform the usual fire fighting and fire prevention
services required of firemen in general. Firemen perform work exclusively
for cheir department, and there is no evidence of any interchange between
fire department employees and employees of other departments. No other
university personnel perform what might be termed a similar or
comparable function.
Although firemen enjoy the same general employee benefits as other
university personnel, their wage scale is determined on a separate basis and
is designed to be comparable with the wage rates received by firemen in the
surrounding communities.2s
Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, the absence ot any
bargaining history, and the fact that no labor organization seeks to
represent firemen in a broader unit, we find that a separate unit of firemen
is appropriate for purposes of bargaining.
The Employer also contends that fire captains are supervisors within
the meaning of the Act and therefore should be excluded from the unit.
The record evidence shows that with respect to organization the fire
department operates under the direction and control of the fire chief.
Reporting directly to the fire chief are two assistant chiefs who in turn arc
assisted by two battalion chiefs. The fire chief, assistant fire chiefs, and
battalion chiefs are all admitted supervisors. Below the battalion chicfs are
eight fire captains and approximately 35 firemen. The tire captains, whose
status is in dispute, have no authority to hire or discharge employees or
effectively to recommend such action. If a fireman commits an infraction
which is in direct contravention of department rules, the fire captain can
take action which may result in the employee's suspension; however, it
would appear that all such disciplinary matters arc subject to an
independent investigation and review and that the (ire captain has no
definitive role to play in the ultimate resolution of such matters. The fire
captains a.re directly responsible for the training of firemen and the upkeep
and maintenance of the department's fire equipment. Tire captains also
have the authority to direct fire fighting operations in the rare instances
when no superior officer is present. However, in carrying out this
responsibility, fire captains follow the routine operating procedures of the
department and have little opportunity to exercise independent judgment.
Accordingly, we find that the fire captains are more in the nature ol
leadmen than supervisors, and, therefore, we shall include them in the unit.
Finally, an issue is also raised with respect to the Fire l ighters'
failure to include all of the fire department's nonsupcrvisory personnel in
the unit. Although the record is somewhat Vague as to what, if any,
additional personnel arc administratively classified as part of the fire
department, the Employer contends that certain administrative and clerical
personnel located in the fire department headquarters building should he
included, as well as all student firemen. 26 We do not agree. The craft-type
unit sought here by the Fire Fighters is properly limited to those possessing
the skills aind exercising the responsibilities typically associated with
firemen. Accordingly, we shall exclude the administrative-clerical personnel
and student firemen from the unit.
*
In light of our findings that separate units of police and fire
department employees are appropriate, we now also find that the grouping
continued on next page

20 The only exceptions have been Stanford's recognition of various printing
trades unions as craft representatives of certain employees at Press and
its past recognition of the Meatcutters Union as representative for
employees of the University's commissary. The commissary as such is no
longer in existence.
There is no merit to the Employer's contention that it should have been
permitted to demonstrate that the sentiment among the office clericals
was in favor of vheir inclusion in any broad grouping of university
employees. The Board does not consider the subjective wishes of
employees in making its unit determinations. It is only after the
appropriate unit determinations are made that the Board has in some
instances permitted employees to determine their unit placement
through the means of a self-determination election.
22 While the overall unit urged by the Employer and USE might also be
appropriate, there is no labor organization eligible to proceed to an
election in this unit. No union has petitioned for an election in this unit,
and, although USE, as an intervenor, has requested an election in such a
unit, USE does not have u sufficient showing of interest to permit the
Board to treat USE as a cross-petitioner and direct an election in this
unit.
23 Section 9(b)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended.
24 The parties agree that firemen do not perform any security or
guard-type functions.
25 The Stanford University Fire Department is also party to several mutual
assistance pacts with fire deparvments in the neighboring communities.
would appear from the record that the student firemen do not have
the training and skill of regular Viremen and are unlikely to progress to
the point where they would be classified as firemen.

DECISION, ORDER, AND DIRECTION OE ELECTIONS
Upon petitions duly filed under Section 9(c) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, a hearing was held before Hearing Officers
Douglas H. Barton and Walter L. Kintz. Following the hearing and
pursuant to Section 102.67 of the National Labor Relations Board Rules
and Regulations, Series 8, as amended, and by direction of the Regional
Director for Region 20, this proceeding was transferred to the National
Labor Relations Board for decision. Thereafter, briefs were Filed with the
Board by the Teamsters, the Fire l ighters, the Police Officers, CSEA-SEA,
USE, and the Employer.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(b) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, the National Labor Relations Board has
delegated its authority in this proceeding to a three-member panel.
The Board has reviewed the rulings of the Hearing Officers made at
the hearing and finds that they are free from prejudicial error. They are
hereby affirmed.
*
Upon the entire record in this proceeding, the Board finds:
1. The Employer, Leland Stanford Jr. University, is a private
nonprofit institution of higher learning which was founded under a trust
agreement executed in 1885 and thereafter confirmed in the constitution
of the State of California. Its operating income for the fiscal year
ending August 31, 1969, was $150,610,560, of which approximately
$112,000,000 came from sources outside the State of California. During
this same period, it purchased goods and services valued at approximately
$48 million, and, of this sum, approximately $9 million involved
expenditures outside the State of California.
The undisputed evidence shows that the Employer meets the
jurisdictional standard for colleges and universities set forth in Section
103.1 of the Board's Rules and Regulations. Accordingly, we find that the
Employer is engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Act, and it
will effectuate the policies of the Act to assert jurisdiction herein.
2. We find that the Petitioners and Intervenors involved in this
proceeding are labor organizations seeking to represent certain employees
of the Employer.'
3. A question affecting commerce exists concerning the
representation of certain employees of the Employer within the meaning
of Sections 9(c)( 1) and 2(6) and (7) of the Act.
4. Stanford's main campus is located on the San Francisco
Peninsula about 30 miles south of San Francisco, California, and consists
of 1,150 contiguous acres that are not part of any municipality. Stanford
also uses for academic purposes a 4,000 acre site approximately 2 miles
from the main campus at which the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center is
located. The University is made up of approximately 218 academic and
nonacademic departments and major subdepartments which are under the
overall control of the University's president and five vice presidents.
Stanford employs approximately 7,000 individuals, included among which
are 1,250 faculty members, 2,000 supervisory or professional employees,
2,200 clericals, and 1,500 employees in maintenance, service, or technical
All but about 50 of these employees perform their duties
and functions at locations on the San Francisco Peninsula.
*
At issue in this proceeding are the nonsupervisory and
nonprofessional employees employed by Stanford, including employees
employed at Stanford University Press and Stanford Hospital. No party
seeks to include faculty members or professional employees of the
University in any of the proposed units. At the hearing the following unit
positions were urged by the respective parties:
(1) The Teamsters seeks a unit of all physical plant department
employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and supervisors as
defined in the Act. In the event the Board finds such a unit to be
inappropriate, the Teamsters has requested an alternative unit comprised of
all maintenance employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and
supervisors.
(2) The Fire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain.
(3) The Police Officers has requested a unit of all employees of the
Stanford University Police Department, excluding all other employees, and
supervisors as defined in the Act.
(4) CSEA-SEA seeks a unit of all employees engaged in service,
maintenance, and technical positions, excluding firemen, clerical
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(5) Machinists seeks a unit of all laboratory mechanicians., physical
science and engineering technicians, and maintenance machinists employed
at the Employer's main campus and at SLAC, excluding all other
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(6) USE seeks a unit of all nonprofessional full-time and part-time
permanent and seasonal employees of the University, including all
employees of the Stanford Press not currently represented, but excluding
all nonstudent firemen, all currently represented employees, professional
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(7) WAC contends that elections should be directed in three
separate units: (1) the unit sought by the Fire Fighters, (2) the unit sought
by the Teamsters, and (3) a residual unit of all other employees, excluding
only professional employees and supervisors.
(8) IBEW seeks a unit of all journeymen and apprentice electricians
employed by the University, excluding all other employees.
(9) UE expressed no unit position.
(10) Laborers also took no unit position but indicated its desire to
be on the ballot in any election in an overall unit or for any residual unit
from which one or more crafts have been severed.
(11) The Employer contends that two units are appropriate. One
would be a unit of all nonsupervisory, nonprofessional employees
employed by the University within the State of California, excluding
employees of Stanford Hospital, employees of Stanford University Press
who are currently represented, students, part-time and casual employees,
confidential employees, and guards. The second would be a unit of all
employees of the Stanford University Police Department, excluding all
other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act.
As the foregoing indicates, there is a considerable difference of
opinion among the parties over what constitutes the appropriate unit or
units for purposes of collective bargaining. These positions range in scope
from requests for various types of craft and departmental units to units
encompassing all nonprofessional employees employed by the University.
In such cases, it is not the Board's function to determine^ which unit or
units might be the most appropriate. Rather, the Board's role in such
circumstances is to determine which, if any, of the petitioned-for units can
be considered appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
Accordingly with these considerations in mind, we shall examine the units
requested.
*
As previously indicated, the Teamsters has requested a unit of all
physical plant department employees. The physical plant department is
one of 16 nonacademic departments which arc under the overall control of
the vice president for business affairs. The department performs a myriad
of activities, including the operation of the campus utility systems, the
maintenance of buildings, roads, and grounds, and the furnishing of
audiovisual services. The physical plant department consists of
approximately IH7 employees in 37 different job classifications. Although
the physical plant department has a central headquarters location, most of
the work is performed away from the shop. There is no common
supervision, wages, or hours of work among the employees in the physical
plant department Also many of the other university departments employ
individuals in the same job classifications as those in the physical plant
department,lo and it is not uncommon for employees in the physical plant
department to work in conjunction with employees of similar skills from
other departments. Perhaps even more significant is the fact that these
other departments perform many of the same job functions as the
employees in the physical plant department and, hence, there are only a
few categories of work assignment which are performed exclusively by the
employees in the physical plant department. Accordingly, on the basis of
the foregoing, we conclude that there is no separate identity of interest
among employees of the physical plant department from that of other
employees which would justify a finding that such a unit could be
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
The Teamsters alternative unit position covers a broader grouping of
maintenance personnel.'' While the unit in question is not precisely

defined, it is clear that it would include employees of the physical plant
department and the plant office department at SLAC, 12 pius employees
performing custodial duties at the University. The unit as described covers
employees in some 20 different departments. However, with the possible
exception of the physical plant department, the Teamsters is not seeking
all the employees in any one department. The unit purports to include all
employees performing maintenance type functions at the University, but
specifically excluded from the unit are several categories of employees
whose work is closely related to that of the unit employees. For example,
physical science and engineering technicians repair and calibrate every type
of electronic and mechanical equipment and on many occasions they work
side-by-side with other journeyman craftsmen who are part of the
proposed Teamsters maintenance unit. Also specifically excluded are the
laboratory mechanicians who possess the same basic skills as the
journeyman mechanics but specialize in the assembly, installation, and
repair of various types of laboratory equipment. Many of the job functions
performed by these laboratory support people are identical with those
performed by the journeyman craftsmen in the Finally, the
Teamsters would include employees performing custodial services, but it
would exclude the food service employees whose interests are closely allied
with those of the custodial employees. A large percentage of the custodial
employees share common supervision and have day-to-day contact with the
food service employees. Furthermore, during the summer months when
food services are reduced, approximately one-half of the food service
employees reiain employment by transferring over to custodial jobs.
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance unit
sought by the Teamsters is too limited in scope to constitute an
appropriate unit of maintenance employees.! 4 Accordingly, as neither of
the Teamsters' requested units can be found to be appropriate for purposes
of collective bargaining, we shall dismiss the petition filed in Case
20-RC-9202.
*
CSEA-SEA has petitioned for a unit of employees engaged in
service, maintenance, and technical positions. The unit as defined would
cover employees at both the main campus and SLAC and would include all
maintenance classifications, all laboratory support personnel, all food
service and custodial employees, and graphic technicians and proofreaders
at Stanford University Press.'s Specifically excluded from the unit are the
police and fire departments, each of which is being sought separately by
other Unions, a ll office clerical employees, and all library personnel, as
well as the general categories of managerial and professional employees,
guards, and all supervisors as defined in the Act. Both the Employer and
USE contend that this unit is too limited in scope and that the appropriate
unit should include all of the University's nonprofessional and
nonsupervisory employees.
There is considerable record testimony which would lend support to
a conclusion that an overall unit of nonprofessional and nonsupervisory
employees would be appropriate. For example, the University's personnel
and employment policies are for the most part standardized and most
university employees are covered by the same wage scale and program of
benefits.' 7 At the main campus, employees are centrally hired through the
University's personnel office, and, when a job opening occurs in a
particular department, employees throughout the University are permitted
to bid on the opening.
On the other hand, however, the unit being sought by CSEA-SEA is
essentially a grouping of all employees engaged in maintenance type
functions, and the Board has on several occasions held that an overall unit
of maintenance employees can be appropriate under certain
circumstances. as our previous findings indicate, the maintenance
functions at the University arc highly integrated, and there can be no
doubt that all the University's maintenance employees share a close
community of interest. There would also appear to be ample justification
for including in such a unit the various nonmaintenance classifications
sought by CSEA-SEA. Thus the custodians, although not classified as
maintenance employees by the University, are traditionally included in
maintenance-type units under existing Board policy. In the circumstances
present here, any action involving the custodians requires that the same
action be taken with respect to food service employees because of the close
community of interest and interchangeability in job functions among
employees in the two categories. The graphics and publications employees
whom CSEA-SEA would also include would most properly belong in units
covering employees at Press. However, in view of the fact that these
employees have been excluded from the existing units at Press and now
constitute a residual group which no union seeks to represent separately,

representations that they are separate organizations should disqualify
them from participating in this proceeding. CSEA-SEA also contends that
WAC does not qualify as a labor organization within the meaning of
Section 2(5) of the Act. We find no merit in these contentions. The
record evidence shows that, although WAC was at one time a subgroup
within USE, the two organizations have separated over a policy
disagreement, and USE and WAC now function as separate independent
entities. The record evidence further shows that each of these
organizations claims to represent certain employees of the Employer for
purposes of improving wages, hours, and terms and conditions of
employment. Accordingly, we conclude that USE and WAC are separate
entities and that each qualifies as a labor organization within the meaning
of Section 2(5) of the Act.

plant office department performs general maintenance for the
SLAC complex.
13 Th e same situation is presented with respect to maintenance functions at
SLAC. The Teamsters would include the plant office department which
performs a wide variety of maintenance functions, but exclude the plant
engineering department which performs maintenance services for the
various research groups. However, in many cases, employees from both
departments work together in performing a particular job function.
4 On the basis of this same evidence, we conclude that the units urged by
Machinists and IBEW are also inappropriate for purposes of collective
bargaining. The Machinists unit of maintenance technicians would
exclude general maintenance employees whom we have found have a
close community of interest with the technicians performing laboratory
support functions. IBEW's request for a separate craft unit of
electricians cannot be sustained in light of the evidence demonstrating
that the University's maintenance operations produce an overlap in craft
skills and a commingling of employees performing craft functions.
University Press, hereinafter referred to as Press, has
approximately 70 employees, the majority of whom are represented by
various printing trades unions. It would appear that the only
unrepresented employees at Press are the graphic technicians and
proofreaders.
'®lt would appear from the record that CSEA-SEA would be willing to
include police and firemen in their unit if the Board found that separate
units of these employees would not be appropriate.

19 While some of the University's clericals may not be performing typical
office clerical functions, the record evidence does not establish tf at any
identifiable segment of the clericals share a closer community of interest
with those in the unit than they ric with other clericals.

their inclusion in CSEA-SEA's unit would not be improper. Similar
considerations support CSEA-SEA's claims that the four audio-visual
operators be included in the unit. Although the record indicates that, due
to their separate and unique functions, the audio-visual operators do not
have a close community of interest with any other group of employees,
their function is to provide highly technical services to the various
departments, and hence they would appear likely to share common
interests with the laboratory support technicians being sought by
CSEA-SEA.
The Employer contends that CSEA-SEA should not be permitted to
exclude the University's clerical employees from their unit because the
clericals have a close community of interest with other university
employees, and in the past CSEA-SEA has attempted to bargain and serve
as spokesman for all university employees including the clericals. We J j
not agree. While it cannot be denied that all university employees sha.e
certain common interests, the Board's practice is not to include officc
clericals in what is essentially a maintenance unit because the two groups
do not share the same interests. 19 Nc>r do we attach any special
significance to the fact that in the past CSEA-SEA attempted to speak for
all university employees. No one disputes the fact that Stanford has
generally refused to recognize any organization as the representative of its
Over the years, Stanford's policy has been to meet with
employees individually or in groups to discuss any matters affecting the
employer-employee relationship. In several cases, these meetings between
Stanford and its employees produced changes in the University's policies
and practices. However, it seems clear from the record evidence that
Stanford steadfastly refused to confer or in any way deal with CSEA-SEA
or any other labor organization as the representative of the University's
employees. Accordingly, we find a complete absence of any bargaining
history affecting the employees here in question.2l
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance-service
unit sought by CSEA-SEA could be depending on the
disposition of the petitions pending before us requesting separate units for
police and firemen. Accordingly, we will reserve final judgment on the
appropriateness of CSEA-SEA's unit until we have ruled on the unit
requests by the Police Officers and Fire Fighters.
*
The Police Officers seeks a unit of all employees of the Stanford
University Police Department, excluding all other employees and
supervisors as defined in the Act. The police department employees are
classified together with firemen as protective services personnel, and both
the police and fire department are located in the same building. At the
hearing, all parties except WAC agreed that the Stanford police exercised
the typical security and protection functions required of policemen in
general and that a separate unit of police department employees would be
appropriate. WAC did not challenge the fact that the police department
employees here perform regular police duties, but it would nevertheless
include them in a residual unit with other classifications of employees. In
view of the undisputed evidence that police department employees are
guards within the meaning of the Act, the Board is precluded from finding
appropriate a unit which groups guards with other employces.23
Accordingly, as no other issues are raised with respect to this unit, we find
that a unit of all employees of the Stanford University Police Department,
excluding all other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act, is
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
*
The Eire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain. The Employer contends that the
firemen do not share a separate community of interest apart from other
employees. None of the other Unions involved in this proceeding seeks to
represent firemen either separately or as part of a larger unit.
The fire department employees like the police are classified by the
University as protective services personnel,24 and both departments arc
housed together in the same building on the main campus. The fire
department employees perform the usual fire fighting and fire prevention
services required of firemen in general. Firemen perform work exclusively
for cheir department, and there is no evidence of any interchange between
fire department employees and employees of other departments. No other
university personnel perform what might be termed a similar or
comparable function.
Although firemen enjoy the same general employee benefits as other
university personnel, their wage scale is determined on a separate basis and
is designed to be comparable with the wage rates received by firemen in the
surrounding communities.2s
Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, the absence ot any
bargaining history, and the fact that no labor organization seeks to
represent firemen in a broader unit, we find that a separate unit of firemen
is appropriate for purposes of bargaining.
The Employer also contends that fire captains are supervisors within
the meaning of the Act and therefore should be excluded from the unit.
The record evidence shows that with respect to organization the fire
department operates under the direction and control of the fire chief.
Reporting directly to the fire chief are two assistant chiefs who in turn arc
assisted by two battalion chiefs. The fire chief, assistant fire chiefs, and
battalion chiefs are all admitted supervisors. Below the battalion chicfs are
eight fire captains and approximately 35 firemen. The tire captains, whose
status is in dispute, have no authority to hire or discharge employees or
effectively to recommend such action. If a fireman commits an infraction
which is in direct contravention of department rules, the fire captain can
take action which may result in the employee's suspension; however, it
would appear that all such disciplinary matters arc subject to an
independent investigation and review and that the (ire captain has no
definitive role to play in the ultimate resolution of such matters. The fire
captains a.re directly responsible for the training of firemen and the upkeep
and maintenance of the department's fire equipment. Tire captains also
have the authority to direct fire fighting operations in the rare instances
when no superior officer is present. However, in carrying out this
responsibility, fire captains follow the routine operating procedures of the
department and have little opportunity to exercise independent judgment.
Accordingly, we find that the fire captains are more in the nature ol
leadmen than supervisors, and, therefore, we shall include them in the unit.
Finally, an issue is also raised with respect to the Fire l ighters'
failure to include all of the fire department's nonsupcrvisory personnel in
the unit. Although the record is somewhat Vague as to what, if any,
additional personnel arc administratively classified as part of the fire
department, the Employer contends that certain administrative and clerical
personnel located in the fire department headquarters building should he
included, as well as all student firemen. 26 We do not agree. The craft-type
unit sought here by the Fire Fighters is properly limited to those possessing
the skills aind exercising the responsibilities typically associated with
firemen. Accordingly, we shall exclude the administrative-clerical personnel
and student firemen from the unit.
*
In light of our findings that separate units of police and fire
department employees are appropriate, we now also find that the grouping
continued on next page

20 The only exceptions have been Stanford's recognition of various printing
trades unions as craft representatives of certain employees at Press and
its past recognition of the Meatcutters Union as representative for
employees of the University's commissary. The commissary as such is no
longer in existence.
There is no merit to the Employer's contention that it should have been
permitted to demonstrate that the sentiment among the office clericals
was in favor of vheir inclusion in any broad grouping of university
employees. The Board does not consider the subjective wishes of
employees in making its unit determinations. It is only after the
appropriate unit determinations are made that the Board has in some
instances permitted employees to determine their unit placement
through the means of a self-determination election.
22 While the overall unit urged by the Employer and USE might also be
appropriate, there is no labor organization eligible to proceed to an
election in this unit. No union has petitioned for an election in this unit,
and, although USE, as an intervenor, has requested an election in such a
unit, USE does not have u sufficient showing of interest to permit the
Board to treat USE as a cross-petitioner and direct an election in this
unit.
23 Section 9(b)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended.
24 The parties agree that firemen do not perform any security or
guard-type functions.
25 The Stanford University Fire Department is also party to several mutual
assistance pacts with fire deparvments in the neighboring communities.
would appear from the record that the student firemen do not have
the training and skill of regular Viremen and are unlikely to progress to
the point where they would be classified as firemen.

DECISION, ORDER, AND DIRECTION OE ELECTIONS
Upon petitions duly filed under Section 9(c) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, a hearing was held before Hearing Officers
Douglas H. Barton and Walter L. Kintz. Following the hearing and
pursuant to Section 102.67 of the National Labor Relations Board Rules
and Regulations, Series 8, as amended, and by direction of the Regional
Director for Region 20, this proceeding was transferred to the National
Labor Relations Board for decision. Thereafter, briefs were Filed with the
Board by the Teamsters, the Fire l ighters, the Police Officers, CSEA-SEA,
USE, and the Employer.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(b) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, the National Labor Relations Board has
delegated its authority in this proceeding to a three-member panel.
The Board has reviewed the rulings of the Hearing Officers made at
the hearing and finds that they are free from prejudicial error. They are
hereby affirmed.
*
Upon the entire record in this proceeding, the Board finds:
1. The Employer, Leland Stanford Jr. University, is a private
nonprofit institution of higher learning which was founded under a trust
agreement executed in 1885 and thereafter confirmed in the constitution
of the State of California. Its operating income for the fiscal year
ending August 31, 1969, was $150,610,560, of which approximately
$112,000,000 came from sources outside the State of California. During
this same period, it purchased goods and services valued at approximately
$48 million, and, of this sum, approximately $9 million involved
expenditures outside the State of California.
The undisputed evidence shows that the Employer meets the
jurisdictional standard for colleges and universities set forth in Section
103.1 of the Board's Rules and Regulations. Accordingly, we find that the
Employer is engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Act, and it
will effectuate the policies of the Act to assert jurisdiction herein.
2. We find that the Petitioners and Intervenors involved in this
proceeding are labor organizations seeking to represent certain employees
of the Employer.'
3. A question affecting commerce exists concerning the
representation of certain employees of the Employer within the meaning
of Sections 9(c)( 1) and 2(6) and (7) of the Act.
4. Stanford's main campus is located on the San Francisco
Peninsula about 30 miles south of San Francisco, California, and consists
of 1,150 contiguous acres that are not part of any municipality. Stanford
also uses for academic purposes a 4,000 acre site approximately 2 miles
from the main campus at which the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center is
located. The University is made up of approximately 218 academic and
nonacademic departments and major subdepartments which are under the
overall control of the University's president and five vice presidents.
Stanford employs approximately 7,000 individuals, included among which
are 1,250 faculty members, 2,000 supervisory or professional employees,
2,200 clericals, and 1,500 employees in maintenance, service, or technical
All but about 50 of these employees perform their duties
and functions at locations on the San Francisco Peninsula.
*
At issue in this proceeding are the nonsupervisory and
nonprofessional employees employed by Stanford, including employees
employed at Stanford University Press and Stanford Hospital. No party
seeks to include faculty members or professional employees of the
University in any of the proposed units. At the hearing the following unit
positions were urged by the respective parties:
(1) The Teamsters seeks a unit of all physical plant department
employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and supervisors as
defined in the Act. In the event the Board finds such a unit to be
inappropriate, the Teamsters has requested an alternative unit comprised of
all maintenance employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and
supervisors.
(2) The Fire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain.
(3) The Police Officers has requested a unit of all employees of the
Stanford University Police Department, excluding all other employees, and
supervisors as defined in the Act.
(4) CSEA-SEA seeks a unit of all employees engaged in service,
maintenance, and technical positions, excluding firemen, clerical
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(5) Machinists seeks a unit of all laboratory mechanicians., physical
science and engineering technicians, and maintenance machinists employed
at the Employer's main campus and at SLAC, excluding all other
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(6) USE seeks a unit of all nonprofessional full-time and part-time
permanent and seasonal employees of the University, including all
employees of the Stanford Press not currently represented, but excluding
all nonstudent firemen, all currently represented employees, professional
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(7) WAC contends that elections should be directed in three
separate units: (1) the unit sought by the Fire Fighters, (2) the unit sought
by the Teamsters, and (3) a residual unit of all other employees, excluding
only professional employees and supervisors.
(8) IBEW seeks a unit of all journeymen and apprentice electricians
employed by the University, excluding all other employees.
(9) UE expressed no unit position.
(10) Laborers also took no unit position but indicated its desire to
be on the ballot in any election in an overall unit or for any residual unit
from which one or more crafts have been severed.
(11) The Employer contends that two units are appropriate. One
would be a unit of all nonsupervisory, nonprofessional employees
employed by the University within the State of California, excluding
employees of Stanford Hospital, employees of Stanford University Press
who are currently represented, students, part-time and casual employees,
confidential employees, and guards. The second would be a unit of all
employees of the Stanford University Police Department, excluding all
other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act.
As the foregoing indicates, there is a considerable difference of
opinion among the parties over what constitutes the appropriate unit or
units for purposes of collective bargaining. These positions range in scope
from requests for various types of craft and departmental units to units
encompassing all nonprofessional employees employed by the University.
In such cases, it is not the Board's function to determine^ which unit or
units might be the most appropriate. Rather, the Board's role in such
circumstances is to determine which, if any, of the petitioned-for units can
be considered appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
Accordingly with these considerations in mind, we shall examine the units
requested.
*
As previously indicated, the Teamsters has requested a unit of all
physical plant department employees. The physical plant department is
one of 16 nonacademic departments which arc under the overall control of
the vice president for business affairs. The department performs a myriad
of activities, including the operation of the campus utility systems, the
maintenance of buildings, roads, and grounds, and the furnishing of
audiovisual services. The physical plant department consists of
approximately IH7 employees in 37 different job classifications. Although
the physical plant department has a central headquarters location, most of
the work is performed away from the shop. There is no common
supervision, wages, or hours of work among the employees in the physical
plant department Also many of the other university departments employ
individuals in the same job classifications as those in the physical plant
department,lo and it is not uncommon for employees in the physical plant
department to work in conjunction with employees of similar skills from
other departments. Perhaps even more significant is the fact that these
other departments perform many of the same job functions as the
employees in the physical plant department and, hence, there are only a
few categories of work assignment which are performed exclusively by the
employees in the physical plant department. Accordingly, on the basis of
the foregoing, we conclude that there is no separate identity of interest
among employees of the physical plant department from that of other
employees which would justify a finding that such a unit could be
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
The Teamsters alternative unit position covers a broader grouping of
maintenance personnel.'' While the unit in question is not precisely

defined, it is clear that it would include employees of the physical plant
department and the plant office department at SLAC, 12 pius employees
performing custodial duties at the University. The unit as described covers
employees in some 20 different departments. However, with the possible
exception of the physical plant department, the Teamsters is not seeking
all the employees in any one department. The unit purports to include all
employees performing maintenance type functions at the University, but
specifically excluded from the unit are several categories of employees
whose work is closely related to that of the unit employees. For example,
physical science and engineering technicians repair and calibrate every type
of electronic and mechanical equipment and on many occasions they work
side-by-side with other journeyman craftsmen who are part of the
proposed Teamsters maintenance unit. Also specifically excluded are the
laboratory mechanicians who possess the same basic skills as the
journeyman mechanics but specialize in the assembly, installation, and
repair of various types of laboratory equipment. Many of the job functions
performed by these laboratory support people are identical with those
performed by the journeyman craftsmen in the Finally, the
Teamsters would include employees performing custodial services, but it
would exclude the food service employees whose interests are closely allied
with those of the custodial employees. A large percentage of the custodial
employees share common supervision and have day-to-day contact with the
food service employees. Furthermore, during the summer months when
food services are reduced, approximately one-half of the food service
employees reiain employment by transferring over to custodial jobs.
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance unit
sought by the Teamsters is too limited in scope to constitute an
appropriate unit of maintenance employees.! 4 Accordingly, as neither of
the Teamsters' requested units can be found to be appropriate for purposes
of collective bargaining, we shall dismiss the petition filed in Case
20-RC-9202.
*
CSEA-SEA has petitioned for a unit of employees engaged in
service, maintenance, and technical positions. The unit as defined would
cover employees at both the main campus and SLAC and would include all
maintenance classifications, all laboratory support personnel, all food
service and custodial employees, and graphic technicians and proofreaders
at Stanford University Press.'s Specifically excluded from the unit are the
police and fire departments, each of which is being sought separately by
other Unions, a ll office clerical employees, and all library personnel, as
well as the general categories of managerial and professional employees,
guards, and all supervisors as defined in the Act. Both the Employer and
USE contend that this unit is too limited in scope and that the appropriate
unit should include all of the University's nonprofessional and
nonsupervisory employees.
There is considerable record testimony which would lend support to
a conclusion that an overall unit of nonprofessional and nonsupervisory
employees would be appropriate. For example, the University's personnel
and employment policies are for the most part standardized and most
university employees are covered by the same wage scale and program of
benefits.' 7 At the main campus, employees are centrally hired through the
University's personnel office, and, when a job opening occurs in a
particular department, employees throughout the University are permitted
to bid on the opening.
On the other hand, however, the unit being sought by CSEA-SEA is
essentially a grouping of all employees engaged in maintenance type
functions, and the Board has on several occasions held that an overall unit
of maintenance employees can be appropriate under certain
circumstances. as our previous findings indicate, the maintenance
functions at the University arc highly integrated, and there can be no
doubt that all the University's maintenance employees share a close
community of interest. There would also appear to be ample justification
for including in such a unit the various nonmaintenance classifications
sought by CSEA-SEA. Thus the custodians, although not classified as
maintenance employees by the University, are traditionally included in
maintenance-type units under existing Board policy. In the circumstances
present here, any action involving the custodians requires that the same
action be taken with respect to food service employees because of the close
community of interest and interchangeability in job functions among
employees in the two categories. The graphics and publications employees
whom CSEA-SEA would also include would most properly belong in units
covering employees at Press. However, in view of the fact that these
employees have been excluded from the existing units at Press and now
constitute a residual group which no union seeks to represent separately,

13 Th e same situation is presented with respect to maintenance functions at

close community of interest with the technicians performing laboratory
support functions. IBEW's request for a separate craft unit of
electricians cannot be sustained in light of the evidence demonstrating
that the University's maintenance operations produce an overlap in craft
skills and a commingling of employees performing craft functions.
University Press, hereinafter referred to as Press, has
approximately 70 employees, the majority of whom are represented by
various printing trades unions. It would appear that the only
unrepresented employees at Press are the graphic technicians and
proofreaders.
'®lt would appear from the record that CSEA-SEA would be willing to
include police and firemen in their unit if the Board found that separate
units of these employees would not be appropriate.
17 AlI but about 400 of the University's employees are salaried
18 Cf. California Institute of Technology, 192 NLRB No. 82.
19 While some of the University's clericals may not be performing typical
office clerical functions, the record evidence does not establish tf at any
identifiable segment of the clericals share a closer community of interest
with those in the unit than they ric with other clericals.

their inclusion in CSEA-SEA's unit would not be improper. Similar
considerations support CSEA-SEA's claims that the four audio-visual
operators be included in the unit. Although the record indicates that, due
to their separate and unique functions, the audio-visual operators do not
have a close community of interest with any other group of employees,
their function is to provide highly technical services to the various
departments, and hence they would appear likely to share common
interests with the laboratory support technicians being sought by
CSEA-SEA.
The Employer contends that CSEA-SEA should not be permitted to
exclude the University's clerical employees from their unit because the
clericals have a close community of interest with other university
employees, and in the past CSEA-SEA has attempted to bargain and serve
as spokesman for all university employees including the clericals. We J j
not agree. While it cannot be denied that all university employees sha.e
certain common interests, the Board's practice is not to include officc
clericals in what is essentially a maintenance unit because the two groups
do not share the same interests. 19 Nc>r do we attach any special
significance to the fact that in the past CSEA-SEA attempted to speak for
all university employees. No one disputes the fact that Stanford has
generally refused to recognize any organization as the representative of its
Over the years, Stanford's policy has been to meet with
employees individually or in groups to discuss any matters affecting the
employer-employee relationship. In several cases, these meetings between
Stanford and its employees produced changes in the University's policies
and practices. However, it seems clear from the record evidence that
Stanford steadfastly refused to confer or in any way deal with CSEA-SEA
or any other labor organization as the representative of the University's
employees. Accordingly, we find a complete absence of any bargaining
history affecting the employees here in question.2l
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance-service
unit sought by CSEA-SEA could be depending on the
disposition of the petitions pending before us requesting separate units for
police and firemen. Accordingly, we will reserve final judgment on the
appropriateness of CSEA-SEA's unit until we have ruled on the unit
requests by the Police Officers and Fire Fighters.
*
The Police Officers seeks a unit of all employees of the Stanford
University Police Department, excluding all other employees and
supervisors as defined in the Act. The police department employees are
classified together with firemen as protective services personnel, and both
the police and fire department are located in the same building. At the
hearing, all parties except WAC agreed that the Stanford police exercised
the typical security and protection functions required of policemen in
general and that a separate unit of police department employees would be
appropriate. WAC did not challenge the fact that the police department
employees here perform regular police duties, but it would nevertheless
include them in a residual unit with other classifications of employees. In
view of the undisputed evidence that police department employees are
guards within the meaning of the Act, the Board is precluded from finding
appropriate a unit which groups guards with other employces.23
Accordingly, as no other issues are raised with respect to this unit, we find
that a unit of all employees of the Stanford University Police Department,
excluding all other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act, is
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
*
The Eire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain. The Employer contends that the
firemen do not share a separate community of interest apart from other
employees. None of the other Unions involved in this proceeding seeks to
represent firemen either separately or as part of a larger unit.
The fire department employees like the police are classified by the
University as protective services personnel,24 and both departments arc
housed together in the same building on the main campus. The fire
department employees perform the usual fire fighting and fire prevention
services required of firemen in general. Firemen perform work exclusively
for cheir department, and there is no evidence of any interchange between
fire department employees and employees of other departments. No other
university personnel perform what might be termed a similar or
comparable function.
Although firemen enjoy the same general employee benefits as other
university personnel, their wage scale is determined on a separate basis and
is designed to be comparable with the wage rates received by firemen in the
surrounding communities.2s
Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, the absence ot any
bargaining history, and the fact that no labor organization seeks to
represent firemen in a broader unit, we find that a separate unit of firemen
is appropriate for purposes of bargaining.
The Employer also contends that fire captains are supervisors within
the meaning of the Act and therefore should be excluded from the unit.
The record evidence shows that with respect to organization the fire
department operates under the direction and control of the fire chief.
Reporting directly to the fire chief are two assistant chiefs who in turn arc
assisted by two battalion chiefs. The fire chief, assistant fire chiefs, and
battalion chiefs are all admitted supervisors. Below the battalion chicfs are
eight fire captains and approximately 35 firemen. The tire captains, whose
status is in dispute, have no authority to hire or discharge employees or
effectively to recommend such action. If a fireman commits an infraction
which is in direct contravention of department rules, the fire captain can
take action which may result in the employee's suspension; however, it
would appear that all such disciplinary matters arc subject to an
independent investigation and review and that the (ire captain has no
definitive role to play in the ultimate resolution of such matters. The fire
captains a.re directly responsible for the training of firemen and the upkeep
and maintenance of the department's fire equipment. Tire captains also
have the authority to direct fire fighting operations in the rare instances
when no superior officer is present. However, in carrying out this
responsibility, fire captains follow the routine operating procedures of the
department and have little opportunity to exercise independent judgment.
Accordingly, we find that the fire captains are more in the nature ol
leadmen than supervisors, and, therefore, we shall include them in the unit.
Finally, an issue is also raised with respect to the Fire l ighters'
failure to include all of the fire department's nonsupcrvisory personnel in
the unit. Although the record is somewhat Vague as to what, if any,
additional personnel arc administratively classified as part of the fire
department, the Employer contends that certain administrative and clerical
personnel located in the fire department headquarters building should he
included, as well as all student firemen. 26 We do not agree. The craft-type
unit sought here by the Fire Fighters is properly limited to those possessing
the skills aind exercising the responsibilities typically associated with
firemen. Accordingly, we shall exclude the administrative-clerical personnel
and student firemen from the unit.
*
In light of our findings that separate units of police and fire
department employees are appropriate, we now also find that the grouping
continued on next page

20 The only exceptions have been Stanford's recognition of various printing
trades unions as craft representatives of certain employees at Press and
its past recognition of the Meatcutters Union as representative for
employees of the University's commissary. The commissary as such is no
longer in existence.
There is no merit to the Employer's contention that it should have been
permitted to demonstrate that the sentiment among the office clericals
was in favor of vheir inclusion in any broad grouping of university
employees. The Board does not consider the subjective wishes of
employees in making its unit determinations. It is only after the
appropriate unit determinations are made that the Board has in some
instances permitted employees to determine their unit placement
through the means of a self-determination election.
22 While the overall unit urged by the Employer and USE might also be
appropriate, there is no labor organization eligible to proceed to an
election in this unit. No union has petitioned for an election in this unit,
and, although USE, as an intervenor, has requested an election in such a
unit, USE does not have u sufficient showing of interest to permit the
Board to treat USE as a cross-petitioner and direct an election in this
unit.
23 Section 9(b)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended.
24 The parties agree that firemen do not perform any security or
guard-type functions.
25 The Stanford University Fire Department is also party to several mutual
assistance pacts with fire deparvments in the neighboring communities.
would appear from the record that the student firemen do not have
the training and skill of regular Viremen and are unlikely to progress to
the point where they would be classified as firemen.

DECISION, ORDER, AND DIRECTION OE ELECTIONS
Upon petitions duly filed under Section 9(c) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, a hearing was held before Hearing Officers
Douglas H. Barton and Walter L. Kintz. Following the hearing and
pursuant to Section 102.67 of the National Labor Relations Board Rules
and Regulations, Series 8, as amended, and by direction of the Regional
Director for Region 20, this proceeding was transferred to the National
Labor Relations Board for decision. Thereafter, briefs were Filed with the
Board by the Teamsters, the Fire l ighters, the Police Officers, CSEA-SEA,
USE, and the Employer.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(b) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, the National Labor Relations Board has
delegated its authority in this proceeding to a three-member panel.
The Board has reviewed the rulings of the Hearing Officers made at
the hearing and finds that they are free from prejudicial error. They are
hereby affirmed.
*
Upon the entire record in this proceeding, the Board finds:
1. The Employer, Leland Stanford Jr. University, is a private
nonprofit institution of higher learning which was founded under a trust
agreement executed in 1885 and thereafter confirmed in the constitution
of the State of California. Its operating income for the fiscal year
ending August 31, 1969, was $150,610,560, of which approximately
$112,000,000 came from sources outside the State of California. During
this same period, it purchased goods and services valued at approximately
$48 million, and, of this sum, approximately $9 million involved
expenditures outside the State of California.
The undisputed evidence shows that the Employer meets the
jurisdictional standard for colleges and universities set forth in Section
103.1 of the Board's Rules and Regulations. Accordingly, we find that the
Employer is engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Act, and it
will effectuate the policies of the Act to assert jurisdiction herein.
2. We find that the Petitioners and Intervenors involved in this
proceeding are labor organizations seeking to represent certain employees
of the Employer.'
3. A question affecting commerce exists concerning the
representation of certain employees of the Employer within the meaning
of Sections 9(c)( 1) and 2(6) and (7) of the Act.
4. Stanford's main campus is located on the San Francisco
Peninsula about 30 miles south of San Francisco, California, and consists
of 1,150 contiguous acres that are not part of any municipality. Stanford
also uses for academic purposes a 4,000 acre site approximately 2 miles
from the main campus at which the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center is
located. The University is made up of approximately 218 academic and
nonacademic departments and major subdepartments which are under the
overall control of the University's president and five vice presidents.
Stanford employs approximately 7,000 individuals, included among which
are 1,250 faculty members, 2,000 supervisory or professional employees,
2,200 clericals, and 1,500 employees in maintenance, service, or technical
All but about 50 of these employees perform their duties
and functions at locations on the San Francisco Peninsula.
*
At issue in this proceeding are the nonsupervisory and
nonprofessional employees employed by Stanford, including employees
employed at Stanford University Press and Stanford Hospital. No party
seeks to include faculty members or professional employees of the
University in any of the proposed units. At the hearing the following unit
positions were urged by the respective parties:
(1) The Teamsters seeks a unit of all physical plant department
employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and supervisors as
defined in the Act. In the event the Board finds such a unit to be
inappropriate, the Teamsters has requested an alternative unit comprised of
all maintenance employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and
supervisors.
(2) The Fire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain.
(3) The Police Officers has requested a unit of all employees of the
Stanford University Police Department, excluding all other employees, and
supervisors as defined in the Act.
(4) CSEA-SEA seeks a unit of all employees engaged in service,
maintenance, and technical positions, excluding firemen, clerical
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(5) Machinists seeks a unit of all laboratory mechanicians., physical
science and engineering technicians, and maintenance machinists employed
at the Employer's main campus and at SLAC, excluding all other
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(6) USE seeks a unit of all nonprofessional full-time and part-time
permanent and seasonal employees of the University, including all
employees of the Stanford Press not currently represented, but excluding
all nonstudent firemen, all currently represented employees, professional
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(7) WAC contends that elections should be directed in three
separate units: (1) the unit sought by the Fire Fighters, (2) the unit sought
by the Teamsters, and (3) a residual unit of all other employees, excluding
only professional employees and supervisors.
(8) IBEW seeks a unit of all journeymen and apprentice electricians
employed by the University, excluding all other employees.
(9) UE expressed no unit position.
(10) Laborers also took no unit position but indicated its desire to
be on the ballot in any election in an overall unit or for any residual unit
from which one or more crafts have been severed.
(11) The Employer contends that two units are appropriate. One
would be a unit of all nonsupervisory, nonprofessional employees
employed by the University within the State of California, excluding
employees of Stanford Hospital, employees of Stanford University Press
who are currently represented, students, part-time and casual employees,
confidential employees, and guards. The second would be a unit of all
employees of the Stanford University Police Department, excluding all
other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act.
As the foregoing indicates, there is a considerable difference of
opinion among the parties over what constitutes the appropriate unit or
units for purposes of collective bargaining. These positions range in scope
from requests for various types of craft and departmental units to units
encompassing all nonprofessional employees employed by the University.
In such cases, it is not the Board's function to determine^ which unit or
units might be the most appropriate. Rather, the Board's role in such
circumstances is to determine which, if any, of the petitioned-for units can
be considered appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
Accordingly with these considerations in mind, we shall examine the units
requested.
*
As previously indicated, the Teamsters has requested a unit of all
physical plant department employees. The physical plant department is
one of 16 nonacademic departments which arc under the overall control of
the vice president for business affairs. The department performs a myriad
of activities, including the operation of the campus utility systems, the
maintenance of buildings, roads, and grounds, and the furnishing of
audiovisual services. The physical plant department consists of
approximately IH7 employees in 37 different job classifications. Although
the physical plant department has a central headquarters location, most of
the work is performed away from the shop. There is no common
supervision, wages, or hours of work among the employees in the physical
plant department Also many of the other university departments employ
individuals in the same job classifications as those in the physical plant
department,lo and it is not uncommon for employees in the physical plant
department to work in conjunction with employees of similar skills from
other departments. Perhaps even more significant is the fact that these
other departments perform many of the same job functions as the
employees in the physical plant department and, hence, there are only a
few categories of work assignment which are performed exclusively by the
employees in the physical plant department. Accordingly, on the basis of
the foregoing, we conclude that there is no separate identity of interest
among employees of the physical plant department from that of other
employees which would justify a finding that such a unit could be
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
The Teamsters alternative unit position covers a broader grouping of
maintenance personnel.'' While the unit in question is not precisely

defined, it is clear that it would include employees of the physical plant
department and the plant office department at SLAC, 12 pius employees
performing custodial duties at the University. The unit as described covers
employees in some 20 different departments. However, with the possible
exception of the physical plant department, the Teamsters is not seeking
all the employees in any one department. The unit purports to include all
employees performing maintenance type functions at the University, but
specifically excluded from the unit are several categories of employees
whose work is closely related to that of the unit employees. For example,
physical science and engineering technicians repair and calibrate every type
of electronic and mechanical equipment and on many occasions they work
side-by-side with other journeyman craftsmen who are part of the
proposed Teamsters maintenance unit. Also specifically excluded are the
laboratory mechanicians who possess the same basic skills as the
journeyman mechanics but specialize in the assembly, installation, and
repair of various types of laboratory equipment. Many of the job functions
performed by these laboratory support people are identical with those
performed by the journeyman craftsmen in the Finally, the
Teamsters would include employees performing custodial services, but it
would exclude the food service employees whose interests are closely allied
with those of the custodial employees. A large percentage of the custodial
employees share common supervision and have day-to-day contact with the
food service employees. Furthermore, during the summer months when
food services are reduced, approximately one-half of the food service
employees reiain employment by transferring over to custodial jobs.
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance unit
sought by the Teamsters is too limited in scope to constitute an
appropriate unit of maintenance employees.! 4 Accordingly, as neither of
the Teamsters' requested units can be found to be appropriate for purposes
of collective bargaining, we shall dismiss the petition filed in Case
20-RC-9202.
*
CSEA-SEA has petitioned for a unit of employees engaged in
service, maintenance, and technical positions. The unit as defined would
cover employees at both the main campus and SLAC and would include all
maintenance classifications, all laboratory support personnel, all food
service and custodial employees, and graphic technicians and proofreaders
at Stanford University Press.'s Specifically excluded from the unit are the
police and fire departments, each of which is being sought separately by
other Unions, a ll office clerical employees, and all library personnel, as
well as the general categories of managerial and professional employees,
guards, and all supervisors as defined in the Act. Both the Employer and
USE contend that this unit is too limited in scope and that the appropriate
unit should include all of the University's nonprofessional and
nonsupervisory employees.
There is considerable record testimony which would lend support to
a conclusion that an overall unit of nonprofessional and nonsupervisory
employees would be appropriate. For example, the University's personnel
and employment policies are for the most part standardized and most
university employees are covered by the same wage scale and program of
benefits.' 7 At the main campus, employees are centrally hired through the
University's personnel office, and, when a job opening occurs in a
particular department, employees throughout the University are permitted
to bid on the opening.
On the other hand, however, the unit being sought by CSEA-SEA is
essentially a grouping of all employees engaged in maintenance type
functions, and the Board has on several occasions held that an overall unit
of maintenance employees can be appropriate under certain
circumstances. as our previous findings indicate, the maintenance
functions at the University arc highly integrated, and there can be no
doubt that all the University's maintenance employees share a close
community of interest. There would also appear to be ample justification
for including in such a unit the various nonmaintenance classifications
sought by CSEA-SEA. Thus the custodians, although not classified as
maintenance employees by the University, are traditionally included in
maintenance-type units under existing Board policy. In the circumstances
present here, any action involving the custodians requires that the same
action be taken with respect to food service employees because of the close
community of interest and interchangeability in job functions among
employees in the two categories. The graphics and publications employees
whom CSEA-SEA would also include would most properly belong in units
covering employees at Press. However, in view of the fact that these
employees have been excluded from the existing units at Press and now
constitute a residual group which no union seeks to represent separately,

also filed objections to the Employer's motion to correct the transcript.
No responses to the motions and objections have been received from any
other party to the proceeding. Accordingly, to the extent that USE and
the Employer's motions to correct the transcript are not in conflict, they
are hereby granted. In all other respects, the motions are hereby denied.
7 CSE A-SEA contends that USE and WAC are a single entity and that their
representations that they are separate organizations should disqualify
them from participating in this proceeding. CSEA-SEA also contends that
WAC does not qualify as a labor organization within the meaning of
Section 2(5) of the Act. We find no merit in these contentions. The
record evidence shows that, although WAC was at one time a subgroup
within USE, the two organizations have separated over a policy
disagreement, and USE and WAC now function as separate independent
entities. The record evidence further shows that each of these
organizations claims to represent certain employees of the Employer for
purposes of improving wages, hours, and terms and conditions of
employment. Accordingly, we conclude that USE and WAC are separate
entities and that each qualifies as a labor organization within the meaning
of Section 2(5) of the Act.

plant office department performs general maintenance for the
SLAC complex.
13 Th e same situation is presented with respect to maintenance functions at
SLAC. The Teamsters would include the plant office department which
performs a wide variety of maintenance functions, but exclude the plant
engineering department which performs maintenance services for the
various research groups. However, in many cases, employees from both
departments work together in performing a particular job function.
4 On the basis of this same evidence, we conclude that the units urged by
Machinists and IBEW are also inappropriate for purposes of collective
bargaining. The Machinists unit of maintenance technicians would
exclude general maintenance employees whom we have found have a
close community of interest with the technicians performing laboratory
support functions. IBEW's request for a separate craft unit of
electricians cannot be sustained in light of the evidence demonstrating
that the University's maintenance operations produce an overlap in craft
skills and a commingling of employees performing craft functions.
University Press, hereinafter referred to as Press, has
approximately 70 employees, the majority of whom are represented by
various printing trades unions. It would appear that the only
unrepresented employees at Press are the graphic technicians and
proofreaders.

their inclusion in CSEA-SEA's unit would not be improper. Similar
considerations support CSEA-SEA's claims that the four audio-visual
operators be included in the unit. Although the record indicates that, due
to their separate and unique functions, the audio-visual operators do not
have a close community of interest with any other group of employees,
their function is to provide highly technical services to the various
departments, and hence they would appear likely to share common
interests with the laboratory support technicians being sought by
CSEA-SEA.
The Employer contends that CSEA-SEA should not be permitted to
exclude the University's clerical employees from their unit because the
clericals have a close community of interest with other university
employees, and in the past CSEA-SEA has attempted to bargain and serve
as spokesman for all university employees including the clericals. We J j
not agree. While it cannot be denied that all university employees sha.e
certain common interests, the Board's practice is not to include officc
clericals in what is essentially a maintenance unit because the two groups
do not share the same interests. 19 Nc>r do we attach any special
significance to the fact that in the past CSEA-SEA attempted to speak for
all university employees. No one disputes the fact that Stanford has

Over the years, Stanford's policy has been to meet with
employees individually or in groups to discuss any matters affecting the
employer-employee relationship. In several cases, these meetings between
Stanford and its employees produced changes in the University's policies
and practices. However, it seems clear from the record evidence that
Stanford steadfastly refused to confer or in any way deal with CSEA-SEA
or any other labor organization as the representative of the University's
employees. Accordingly, we find a complete absence of any bargaining
history affecting the employees here in question.2l
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance-service
unit sought by CSEA-SEA could be depending on the
disposition of the petitions pending before us requesting separate units for
police and firemen. Accordingly, we will reserve final judgment on the
appropriateness of CSEA-SEA's unit until we have ruled on the unit
requests by the Police Officers and Fire Fighters.
*
The Police Officers seeks a unit of all employees of the Stanford
University Police Department, excluding all other employees and
supervisors as defined in the Act. The police department employees are
classified together with firemen as protective services personnel, and both
the police and fire department are located in the same building. At the
hearing, all parties except WAC agreed that the Stanford police exercised
the typical security and protection functions required of policemen in
general and that a separate unit of police department employees would be
appropriate. WAC did not challenge the fact that the police department
employees here perform regular police duties, but it would nevertheless
include them in a residual unit with other classifications of employees. In
view of the undisputed evidence that police department employees are
guards within the meaning of the Act, the Board is precluded from finding
appropriate a unit which groups guards with other employces.23
Accordingly, as no other issues are raised with respect to this unit, we find
that a unit of all employees of the Stanford University Police Department,
excluding all other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act, is
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
*
The Eire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain. The Employer contends that the
firemen do not share a separate community of interest apart from other

services required of firemen in general. Firemen perform work exclusively

fire department employees and employees of other departments. No other
university personnel perform what might be termed a similar or

Although firemen enjoy the same general employee benefits as other
university personnel, their wage scale is determined on a separate basis and
is designed to be comparable with the wage rates received by firemen in the
surrounding communities.2s
Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, the absence ot any
bargaining history, and the fact that no labor organization seeks to
represent firemen in a broader unit, we find that a separate unit of firemen
is appropriate for purposes of bargaining.
The Employer also contends that fire captains are supervisors within
the meaning of the Act and therefore should be excluded from the unit.
The record evidence shows that with respect to organization the fire
department operates under the direction and control of the fire chief.
Reporting directly to the fire chief are two assistant chiefs who in turn arc
assisted by two battalion chiefs. The fire chief, assistant fire chiefs, and
battalion chiefs are all admitted supervisors. Below the battalion chicfs are
eight fire captains and approximately 35 firemen. The tire captains, whose

responsibility, fire captains follow the routine operating procedures of the
department and have little opportunity to exercise independent judgment.
Accordingly, we find that the fire captains are more in the nature ol
leadmen than supervisors, and, therefore, we shall include them in the unit.
Finally, an issue is also raised with respect to the Fire l ighters'
failure to include all of the fire department's nonsupcrvisory personnel in
the unit. Although the record is somewhat Vague as to what, if any,
additional personnel arc administratively classified as part of the fire
department, the Employer contends that certain administrative and clerical
personnel located in the fire department headquarters building should he
included, as well as all student firemen. 26 We do not agree. The craft-type
unit sought here by the Fire Fighters is properly limited to those possessing
the skills aind exercising the responsibilities typically associated with
firemen. Accordingly, we shall exclude the administrative-clerical personnel
and student firemen from the unit.
*
In light of our findings that separate units of police and fire
department employees are appropriate, we now also find that the grouping
continued on next page

20 The only exceptions have been Stanford's recognition of various printing
trades unions as craft representatives of certain employees at Press and
its past recognition of the Meatcutters Union as representative for
employees of the University's commissary. The commissary as such is no
longer in existence.
There is no merit to the Employer's contention that it should have been
permitted to demonstrate that the sentiment among the office clericals
was in favor of vheir inclusion in any broad grouping of university
employees. The Board does not consider the subjective wishes of
employees in making its unit determinations. It is only after the
appropriate unit determinations are made that the Board has in some
instances permitted employees to determine their unit placement
through the means of a self-determination election.
22 While the overall unit urged by the Employer and USE might also be
appropriate, there is no labor organization eligible to proceed to an
election in this unit. No union has petitioned for an election in this unit,
and, although USE, as an intervenor, has requested an election in such a
unit, USE does not have u sufficient showing of interest to permit the
Board to treat USE as a cross-petitioner and direct an election in this
unit.

DECISION, ORDER, AND DIRECTION OE ELECTIONS
Upon petitions duly filed under Section 9(c) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, a hearing was held before Hearing Officers
Douglas H. Barton and Walter L. Kintz. Following the hearing and
pursuant to Section 102.67 of the National Labor Relations Board Rules
and Regulations, Series 8, as amended, and by direction of the Regional
Director for Region 20, this proceeding was transferred to the National
Labor Relations Board for decision. Thereafter, briefs were Filed with the
Board by the Teamsters, the Fire l ighters, the Police Officers, CSEA-SEA,
USE, and the Employer.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(b) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, the National Labor Relations Board has
delegated its authority in this proceeding to a three-member panel.
The Board has reviewed the rulings of the Hearing Officers made at
the hearing and finds that they are free from prejudicial error. They are
hereby affirmed.
*
Upon the entire record in this proceeding, the Board finds:
1. The Employer, Leland Stanford Jr. University, is a private
nonprofit institution of higher learning which was founded under a trust
agreement executed in 1885 and thereafter confirmed in the constitution
of the State of California. Its operating income for the fiscal year
ending August 31, 1969, was $150,610,560, of which approximately
$112,000,000 came from sources outside the State of California. During
this same period, it purchased goods and services valued at approximately
$48 million, and, of this sum, approximately $9 million involved
expenditures outside the State of California.
The undisputed evidence shows that the Employer meets the
jurisdictional standard for colleges and universities set forth in Section
103.1 of the Board's Rules and Regulations. Accordingly, we find that the
Employer is engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Act, and it
will effectuate the policies of the Act to assert jurisdiction herein.
2. We find that the Petitioners and Intervenors involved in this
proceeding are labor organizations seeking to represent certain employees
of the Employer.'
3. A question affecting commerce exists concerning the
representation of certain employees of the Employer within the meaning
of Sections 9(c)( 1) and 2(6) and (7) of the Act.
4. Stanford's main campus is located on the San Francisco
Peninsula about 30 miles south of San Francisco, California, and consists
of 1,150 contiguous acres that are not part of any municipality. Stanford
also uses for academic purposes a 4,000 acre site approximately 2 miles
from the main campus at which the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center is
located. The University is made up of approximately 218 academic and
nonacademic departments and major subdepartments which are under the
overall control of the University's president and five vice presidents.
Stanford employs approximately 7,000 individuals, included among which
are 1,250 faculty members, 2,000 supervisory or professional employees,
2,200 clericals, and 1,500 employees in maintenance, service, or technical
All but about 50 of these employees perform their duties
and functions at locations on the San Francisco Peninsula.
*
At issue in this proceeding are the nonsupervisory and
nonprofessional employees employed by Stanford, including employees
employed at Stanford University Press and Stanford Hospital. No party
seeks to include faculty members or professional employees of the
University in any of the proposed units. At the hearing the following unit
positions were urged by the respective parties:
(1) The Teamsters seeks a unit of all physical plant department
employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and supervisors as
defined in the Act. In the event the Board finds such a unit to be
inappropriate, the Teamsters has requested an alternative unit comprised of
all maintenance employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and
supervisors.
(2) The Fire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain.
(3) The Police Officers has requested a unit of all employees of the
Stanford University Police Department, excluding all other employees, and
supervisors as defined in the Act.
(4) CSEA-SEA seeks a unit of all employees engaged in service,
maintenance, and technical positions, excluding firemen, clerical
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(5) Machinists seeks a unit of all laboratory mechanicians., physical
science and engineering technicians, and maintenance machinists employed
at the Employer's main campus and at SLAC, excluding all other
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(6) USE seeks a unit of all nonprofessional full-time and part-time
permanent and seasonal employees of the University, including all
employees of the Stanford Press not currently represented, but excluding
all nonstudent firemen, all currently represented employees, professional
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(7) WAC contends that elections should be directed in three
separate units: (1) the unit sought by the Fire Fighters, (2) the unit sought
by the Teamsters, and (3) a residual unit of all other employees, excluding
only professional employees and supervisors.
(8) IBEW seeks a unit of all journeymen and apprentice electricians
employed by the University, excluding all other employees.
(9) UE expressed no unit position.
(10) Laborers also took no unit position but indicated its desire to
be on the ballot in any election in an overall unit or for any residual unit
from which one or more crafts have been severed.
(11) The Employer contends that two units are appropriate. One
would be a unit of all nonsupervisory, nonprofessional employees
employed by the University within the State of California, excluding
employees of Stanford Hospital, employees of Stanford University Press
who are currently represented, students, part-time and casual employees,
confidential employees, and guards. The second would be a unit of all
employees of the Stanford University Police Department, excluding all
other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act.
As the foregoing indicates, there is a considerable difference of
opinion among the parties over what constitutes the appropriate unit or
units for purposes of collective bargaining. These positions range in scope
from requests for various types of craft and departmental units to units
encompassing all nonprofessional employees employed by the University.
In such cases, it is not the Board's function to determine^ which unit or
units might be the most appropriate. Rather, the Board's role in such
circumstances is to determine which, if any, of the petitioned-for units can
be considered appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
Accordingly with these considerations in mind, we shall examine the units
requested.
*
As previously indicated, the Teamsters has requested a unit of all
physical plant department employees. The physical plant department is
one of 16 nonacademic departments which arc under the overall control of
the vice president for business affairs. The department performs a myriad
of activities, including the operation of the campus utility systems, the
maintenance of buildings, roads, and grounds, and the furnishing of
audiovisual services. The physical plant department consists of
approximately IH7 employees in 37 different job classifications. Although
the physical plant department has a central headquarters location, most of
the work is performed away from the shop. There is no common
supervision, wages, or hours of work among the employees in the physical
plant department Also many of the other university departments employ
individuals in the same job classifications as those in the physical plant
department,lo and it is not uncommon for employees in the physical plant
department to work in conjunction with employees of similar skills from
other departments. Perhaps even more significant is the fact that these
other departments perform many of the same job functions as the
employees in the physical plant department and, hence, there are only a
few categories of work assignment which are performed exclusively by the
employees in the physical plant department. Accordingly, on the basis of
the foregoing, we conclude that there is no separate identity of interest
among employees of the physical plant department from that of other
employees which would justify a finding that such a unit could be
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
The Teamsters alternative unit position covers a broader grouping of
maintenance personnel.'' While the unit in question is not precisely

defined, it is clear that it would include employees of the physical plant
department and the plant office department at SLAC, 12 pius employees
performing custodial duties at the University. The unit as described covers
employees in some 20 different departments. However, with the possible
exception of the physical plant department, the Teamsters is not seeking
all the employees in any one department. The unit purports to include all
employees performing maintenance type functions at the University, but
specifically excluded from the unit are several categories of employees
whose work is closely related to that of the unit employees. For example,
physical science and engineering technicians repair and calibrate every type
of electronic and mechanical equipment and on many occasions they work
side-by-side with other journeyman craftsmen who are part of the
proposed Teamsters maintenance unit. Also specifically excluded are the
laboratory mechanicians who possess the same basic skills as the
journeyman mechanics but specialize in the assembly, installation, and
repair of various types of laboratory equipment. Many of the job functions
performed by these laboratory support people are identical with those
performed by the journeyman craftsmen in the Finally, the
Teamsters would include employees performing custodial services, but it
would exclude the food service employees whose interests are closely allied
with those of the custodial employees. A large percentage of the custodial
employees share common supervision and have day-to-day contact with the
food service employees. Furthermore, during the summer months when
food services are reduced, approximately one-half of the food service
employees reiain employment by transferring over to custodial jobs.
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance unit
sought by the Teamsters is too limited in scope to constitute an
appropriate unit of maintenance employees.! 4 Accordingly, as neither of
the Teamsters' requested units can be found to be appropriate for purposes
of collective bargaining, we shall dismiss the petition filed in Case
20-RC-9202.
*
CSEA-SEA has petitioned for a unit of employees engaged in
service, maintenance, and technical positions. The unit as defined would
cover employees at both the main campus and SLAC and would include all
maintenance classifications, all laboratory support personnel, all food
service and custodial employees, and graphic technicians and proofreaders
at Stanford University Press.'s Specifically excluded from the unit are the
police and fire departments, each of which is being sought separately by
other Unions, a ll office clerical employees, and all library personnel, as
well as the general categories of managerial and professional employees,
guards, and all supervisors as defined in the Act. Both the Employer and
USE contend that this unit is too limited in scope and that the appropriate
unit should include all of the University's nonprofessional and
nonsupervisory employees.
There is considerable record testimony which would lend support to
a conclusion that an overall unit of nonprofessional and nonsupervisory
employees would be appropriate. For example, the University's personnel
and employment policies are for the most part standardized and most
university employees are covered by the same wage scale and program of
benefits.' 7 At the main campus, employees are centrally hired through the
University's personnel office, and, when a job opening occurs in a
particular department, employees throughout the University are permitted
to bid on the opening.
On the other hand, however, the unit being sought by CSEA-SEA is
essentially a grouping of all employees engaged in maintenance type
functions, and the Board has on several occasions held that an overall unit
of maintenance employees can be appropriate under certain
circumstances. as our previous findings indicate, the maintenance
functions at the University arc highly integrated, and there can be no
doubt that all the University's maintenance employees share a close
community of interest. There would also appear to be ample justification
for including in such a unit the various nonmaintenance classifications
sought by CSEA-SEA. Thus the custodians, although not classified as
maintenance employees by the University, are traditionally included in
maintenance-type units under existing Board policy. In the circumstances
present here, any action involving the custodians requires that the same
action be taken with respect to food service employees because of the close
community of interest and interchangeability in job functions among
employees in the two categories. The graphics and publications employees
whom CSEA-SEA would also include would most properly belong in units
covering employees at Press. However, in view of the fact that these
employees have been excluded from the existing units at Press and now
constitute a residual group which no union seeks to represent separately,

parties to this proceeding: Construction & General Laborers Union Local

USE; Workers Action Caucus, hereinafter WAC; International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 332, hereinafter IBEW;

®The Employer and USE each filed motions to correct the transcript. USE
also filed objections to the Employer's motion to correct the transcript.
No responses to the motions and objections have been received from any
other party to the proceeding. Accordingly, to the extent that USE and
the Employer's motions to correct the transcript are not in conflict, they
are hereby granted. In all other respects, the motions are hereby denied.
7 CSE A-SEA contends that USE and WAC are a single entity and that their
representations that they are separate organizations should disqualify
them from participating in this proceeding. CSEA-SEA also contends that
WAC does not qualify as a labor organization within the meaning of
Section 2(5) of the Act. We find no merit in these contentions. The
record evidence shows that, although WAC was at one time a subgroup
within USE, the two organizations have separated over a policy
disagreement, and USE and WAC now function as separate independent
entities. The record evidence further shows that each of these
organizations claims to represent certain employees of the Employer for
purposes of improving wages, hours, and terms and conditions of
employment. Accordingly, we conclude that USE and WAC are separate
entities and that each qualifies as a labor organization within the meaning
of Section 2(5) of the Act.

However, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, we assume that the
Teamsters has not abandoned this unit position.
plant office department performs general maintenance for the
SLAC complex.
13 Th e same situation is presented with respect to maintenance functions at
SLAC. The Teamsters would include the plant office department which
performs a wide variety of maintenance functions, but exclude the plant
engineering department which performs maintenance services for the
various research groups. However, in many cases, employees from both
departments work together in performing a particular job function.
4 On the basis of this same evidence, we conclude that the units urged by
Machinists and IBEW are also inappropriate for purposes of collective
bargaining. The Machinists unit of maintenance technicians would
exclude general maintenance employees whom we have found have a
close community of interest with the technicians performing laboratory
support functions. IBEW's request for a separate craft unit of
electricians cannot be sustained in light of the evidence demonstrating
that the University's maintenance operations produce an overlap in craft
skills and a commingling of employees performing craft functions.
University Press, hereinafter referred to as Press, has
approximately 70 employees, the majority of whom are represented by
various printing trades unions. It would appear that the only
unrepresented employees at Press are the graphic technicians and
proofreaders.
'®lt would appear from the record that CSEA-SEA would be willing to
include police and firemen in their unit if the Board found that separate
units of these employees would not be appropriate.

their inclusion in CSEA-SEA's unit would not be improper. Similar
considerations support CSEA-SEA's claims that the four audio-visual
operators be included in the unit. Although the record indicates that, due
to their separate and unique functions, the audio-visual operators do not
have a close community of interest with any other group of employees,
their function is to provide highly technical services to the various
departments, and hence they would appear likely to share common
interests with the laboratory support technicians being sought by
CSEA-SEA.
The Employer contends that CSEA-SEA should not be permitted to
exclude the University's clerical employees from their unit because the
clericals have a close community of interest with other university
employees, and in the past CSEA-SEA has attempted to bargain and serve
as spokesman for all university employees including the clericals. We J j
not agree. While it cannot be denied that all university employees sha.e
certain common interests, the Board's practice is not to include officc
clericals in what is essentially a maintenance unit because the two groups
do not share the same interests. 19 Nc>r do we attach any special
significance to the fact that in the past CSEA-SEA attempted to speak for
all university employees. No one disputes the fact that Stanford has
generally refused to recognize any organization as the representative of its
Over the years, Stanford's policy has been to meet with
employees individually or in groups to discuss any matters affecting the
employer-employee relationship. In several cases, these meetings between
Stanford and its employees produced changes in the University's policies
and practices. However, it seems clear from the record evidence that
Stanford steadfastly refused to confer or in any way deal with CSEA-SEA
or any other labor organization as the representative of the University's
employees. Accordingly, we find a complete absence of any bargaining
history affecting the employees here in question.2l
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance-service
unit sought by CSEA-SEA could be depending on the
disposition of the petitions pending before us requesting separate units for
police and firemen. Accordingly, we will reserve final judgment on the
appropriateness of CSEA-SEA's unit until we have ruled on the unit
requests by the Police Officers and Fire Fighters.
*
The Police Officers seeks a unit of all employees of the Stanford
University Police Department, excluding all other employees and
supervisors as defined in the Act. The police department employees are
classified together with firemen as protective services personnel, and both
the police and fire department are located in the same building. At the
hearing, all parties except WAC agreed that the Stanford police exercised
the typical security and protection functions required of policemen in
general and that a separate unit of police department employees would be
appropriate. WAC did not challenge the fact that the police department
employees here perform regular police duties, but it would nevertheless
include them in a residual unit with other classifications of employees. In
view of the undisputed evidence that police department employees are
guards within the meaning of the Act, the Board is precluded from finding
appropriate a unit which groups guards with other employces.23
Accordingly, as no other issues are raised with respect to this unit, we find
that a unit of all employees of the Stanford University Police Department,
excluding all other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act, is
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
*
The Eire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain. The Employer contends that the
firemen do not share a separate community of interest apart from other
employees. None of the other Unions involved in this proceeding seeks to
represent firemen either separately or as part of a larger unit.
The fire department employees like the police are classified by the
University as protective services personnel,24 and both departments arc
housed together in the same building on the main campus. The fire
department employees perform the usual fire fighting and fire prevention
services required of firemen in general. Firemen perform work exclusively
for cheir department, and there is no evidence of any interchange between
fire department employees and employees of other departments. No other
university personnel perform what might be termed a similar or
comparable function.
Although firemen enjoy the same general employee benefits as other
university personnel, their wage scale is determined on a separate basis and
is designed to be comparable with the wage rates received by firemen in the
surrounding communities.2s
Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, the absence ot any
bargaining history, and the fact that no labor organization seeks to
represent firemen in a broader unit, we find that a separate unit of firemen
is appropriate for purposes of bargaining.
The Employer also contends that fire captains are supervisors within
the meaning of the Act and therefore should be excluded from the unit.
The record evidence shows that with respect to organization the fire
department operates under the direction and control of the fire chief.
Reporting directly to the fire chief are two assistant chiefs who in turn arc
assisted by two battalion chiefs. The fire chief, assistant fire chiefs, and
battalion chiefs are all admitted supervisors. Below the battalion chicfs are
eight fire captains and approximately 35 firemen. The tire captains, whose
status is in dispute, have no authority to hire or discharge employees or
effectively to recommend such action. If a fireman commits an infraction
which is in direct contravention of department rules, the fire captain can
take action which may result in the employee's suspension; however, it
would appear that all such disciplinary matters arc subject to an
independent investigation and review and that the (ire captain has no
definitive role to play in the ultimate resolution of such matters. The fire
captains a.re directly responsible for the training of firemen and the upkeep
and maintenance of the department's fire equipment. Tire captains also
have the authority to direct fire fighting operations in the rare instances
when no superior officer is present. However, in carrying out this
responsibility, fire captains follow the routine operating procedures of the
department and have little opportunity to exercise independent judgment.
Accordingly, we find that the fire captains are more in the nature ol
leadmen than supervisors, and, therefore, we shall include them in the unit.
Finally, an issue is also raised with respect to the Fire l ighters'
failure to include all of the fire department's nonsupcrvisory personnel in
the unit. Although the record is somewhat Vague as to what, if any,
additional personnel arc administratively classified as part of the fire
department, the Employer contends that certain administrative and clerical
personnel located in the fire department headquarters building should he
included, as well as all student firemen. 26 We do not agree. The craft-type
unit sought here by the Fire Fighters is properly limited to those possessing
the skills aind exercising the responsibilities typically associated with
firemen. Accordingly, we shall exclude the administrative-clerical personnel
and student firemen from the unit.
*
In light of our findings that separate units of police and fire
department employees are appropriate, we now also find that the grouping
continued on next page

20 The only exceptions have been Stanford's recognition of various printing
trades unions as craft representatives of certain employees at Press and
its past recognition of the Meatcutters Union as representative for
employees of the University's commissary. The commissary as such is no
longer in existence.
There is no merit to the Employer's contention that it should have been
permitted to demonstrate that the sentiment among the office clericals
was in favor of vheir inclusion in any broad grouping of university
employees. The Board does not consider the subjective wishes of
employees in making its unit determinations. It is only after the

DECISION, ORDER, AND DIRECTION OE ELECTIONS
Upon petitions duly filed under Section 9(c) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, a hearing was held before Hearing Officers
Douglas H. Barton and Walter L. Kintz. Following the hearing and
pursuant to Section 102.67 of the National Labor Relations Board Rules
and Regulations, Series 8, as amended, and by direction of the Regional
Director for Region 20, this proceeding was transferred to the National
Labor Relations Board for decision. Thereafter, briefs were Filed with the
Board by the Teamsters, the Fire l ighters, the Police Officers, CSEA-SEA,
USE, and the Employer.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(b) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, the National Labor Relations Board has
delegated its authority in this proceeding to a three-member panel.
The Board has reviewed the rulings of the Hearing Officers made at
the hearing and finds that they are free from prejudicial error. They are
hereby affirmed.
*
Upon the entire record in this proceeding, the Board finds:
1. The Employer, Leland Stanford Jr. University, is a private
nonprofit institution of higher learning which was founded under a trust
agreement executed in 1885 and thereafter confirmed in the constitution
of the State of California. Its operating income for the fiscal year
ending August 31, 1969, was $150,610,560, of which approximately
$112,000,000 came from sources outside the State of California. During
this same period, it purchased goods and services valued at approximately
$48 million, and, of this sum, approximately $9 million involved
expenditures outside the State of California.
The undisputed evidence shows that the Employer meets the
jurisdictional standard for colleges and universities set forth in Section
103.1 of the Board's Rules and Regulations. Accordingly, we find that the
Employer is engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Act, and it
will effectuate the policies of the Act to assert jurisdiction herein.
2. We find that the Petitioners and Intervenors involved in this
proceeding are labor organizations seeking to represent certain employees
of the Employer.'
3. A question affecting commerce exists concerning the
representation of certain employees of the Employer within the meaning
of Sections 9(c)( 1) and 2(6) and (7) of the Act.
4. Stanford's main campus is located on the San Francisco
Peninsula about 30 miles south of San Francisco, California, and consists
of 1,150 contiguous acres that are not part of any municipality. Stanford
also uses for academic purposes a 4,000 acre site approximately 2 miles
from the main campus at which the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center is
located. The University is made up of approximately 218 academic and
nonacademic departments and major subdepartments which are under the
overall control of the University's president and five vice presidents.
Stanford employs approximately 7,000 individuals, included among which
are 1,250 faculty members, 2,000 supervisory or professional employees,
2,200 clericals, and 1,500 employees in maintenance, service, or technical
All but about 50 of these employees perform their duties
and functions at locations on the San Francisco Peninsula.
*
At issue in this proceeding are the nonsupervisory and
nonprofessional employees employed by Stanford, including employees
employed at Stanford University Press and Stanford Hospital. No party
seeks to include faculty members or professional employees of the
University in any of the proposed units. At the hearing the following unit
positions were urged by the respective parties:
(1) The Teamsters seeks a unit of all physical plant department
employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and supervisors as
defined in the Act. In the event the Board finds such a unit to be
inappropriate, the Teamsters has requested an alternative unit comprised of
all maintenance employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and
supervisors.
(2) The Fire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain.
(3) The Police Officers has requested a unit of all employees of the
Stanford University Police Department, excluding all other employees, and
supervisors as defined in the Act.
(4) CSEA-SEA seeks a unit of all employees engaged in service,
maintenance, and technical positions, excluding firemen, clerical
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(5) Machinists seeks a unit of all laboratory mechanicians., physical
science and engineering technicians, and maintenance machinists employed
at the Employer's main campus and at SLAC, excluding all other
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(6) USE seeks a unit of all nonprofessional full-time and part-time
permanent and seasonal employees of the University, including all
employees of the Stanford Press not currently represented, but excluding
all nonstudent firemen, all currently represented employees, professional
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(7) WAC contends that elections should be directed in three
separate units: (1) the unit sought by the Fire Fighters, (2) the unit sought
by the Teamsters, and (3) a residual unit of all other employees, excluding
only professional employees and supervisors.
(8) IBEW seeks a unit of all journeymen and apprentice electricians
employed by the University, excluding all other employees.
(9) UE expressed no unit position.
(10) Laborers also took no unit position but indicated its desire to
be on the ballot in any election in an overall unit or for any residual unit
from which one or more crafts have been severed.
(11) The Employer contends that two units are appropriate. One
would be a unit of all nonsupervisory, nonprofessional employees
employed by the University within the State of California, excluding
employees of Stanford Hospital, employees of Stanford University Press
who are currently represented, students, part-time and casual employees,
confidential employees, and guards. The second would be a unit of all
employees of the Stanford University Police Department, excluding all
other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act.
As the foregoing indicates, there is a considerable difference of
opinion among the parties over what constitutes the appropriate unit or
units for purposes of collective bargaining. These positions range in scope
from requests for various types of craft and departmental units to units
encompassing all nonprofessional employees employed by the University.
In such cases, it is not the Board's function to determine^ which unit or
units might be the most appropriate. Rather, the Board's role in such
circumstances is to determine which, if any, of the petitioned-for units can
be considered appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
Accordingly with these considerations in mind, we shall examine the units
requested.
*
As previously indicated, the Teamsters has requested a unit of all
physical plant department employees. The physical plant department is
one of 16 nonacademic departments which arc under the overall control of
the vice president for business affairs. The department performs a myriad
of activities, including the operation of the campus utility systems, the
maintenance of buildings, roads, and grounds, and the furnishing of
audiovisual services. The physical plant department consists of
approximately IH7 employees in 37 different job classifications. Although
the physical plant department has a central headquarters location, most of
the work is performed away from the shop. There is no common
supervision, wages, or hours of work among the employees in the physical
plant department Also many of the other university departments employ
individuals in the same job classifications as those in the physical plant
department,lo and it is not uncommon for employees in the physical plant
department to work in conjunction with employees of similar skills from
other departments. Perhaps even more significant is the fact that these
other departments perform many of the same job functions as the
employees in the physical plant department and, hence, there are only a
few categories of work assignment which are performed exclusively by the
employees in the physical plant department. Accordingly, on the basis of
the foregoing, we conclude that there is no separate identity of interest
among employees of the physical plant department from that of other
employees which would justify a finding that such a unit could be
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
The Teamsters alternative unit position covers a broader grouping of
maintenance personnel.'' While the unit in question is not precisely

defined, it is clear that it would include employees of the physical plant
department and the plant office department at SLAC, 12 pius employees
performing custodial duties at the University. The unit as described covers
employees in some 20 different departments. However, with the possible
exception of the physical plant department, the Teamsters is not seeking
all the employees in any one department. The unit purports to include all
employees performing maintenance type functions at the University, but
specifically excluded from the unit are several categories of employees
whose work is closely related to that of the unit employees. For example,
physical science and engineering technicians repair and calibrate every type
of electronic and mechanical equipment and on many occasions they work
side-by-side with other journeyman craftsmen who are part of the
proposed Teamsters maintenance unit. Also specifically excluded are the
laboratory mechanicians who possess the same basic skills as the
journeyman mechanics but specialize in the assembly, installation, and
repair of various types of laboratory equipment. Many of the job functions
performed by these laboratory support people are identical with those
performed by the journeyman craftsmen in the Finally, the
Teamsters would include employees performing custodial services, but it
would exclude the food service employees whose interests are closely allied
with those of the custodial employees. A large percentage of the custodial
employees share common supervision and have day-to-day contact with the
food service employees. Furthermore, during the summer months when
food services are reduced, approximately one-half of the food service
employees reiain employment by transferring over to custodial jobs.
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance unit
sought by the Teamsters is too limited in scope to constitute an
appropriate unit of maintenance employees.! 4 Accordingly, as neither of
the Teamsters' requested units can be found to be appropriate for purposes
of collective bargaining, we shall dismiss the petition filed in Case
20-RC-9202.
*
CSEA-SEA has petitioned for a unit of employees engaged in
service, maintenance, and technical positions. The unit as defined would
cover employees at both the main campus and SLAC and would include all
maintenance classifications, all laboratory support personnel, all food
service and custodial employees, and graphic technicians and proofreaders
at Stanford University Press.'s Specifically excluded from the unit are the
police and fire departments, each of which is being sought separately by
other Unions, a ll office clerical employees, and all library personnel, as
well as the general categories of managerial and professional employees,
guards, and all supervisors as defined in the Act. Both the Employer and
USE contend that this unit is too limited in scope and that the appropriate
unit should include all of the University's nonprofessional and
nonsupervisory employees.
There is considerable record testimony which would lend support to
a conclusion that an overall unit of nonprofessional and nonsupervisory
employees would be appropriate. For example, the University's personnel
and employment policies are for the most part standardized and most
university employees are covered by the same wage scale and program of
benefits.' 7 At the main campus, employees are centrally hired through the
University's personnel office, and, when a job opening occurs in a
particular department, employees throughout the University are permitted
to bid on the opening.
On the other hand, however, the unit being sought by CSEA-SEA is
essentially a grouping of all employees engaged in maintenance type
functions, and the Board has on several occasions held that an overall unit
of maintenance employees can be appropriate under certain
circumstances. as our previous findings indicate, the maintenance
functions at the University arc highly integrated, and there can be no
doubt that all the University's maintenance employees share a close
community of interest. There would also appear to be ample justification
for including in such a unit the various nonmaintenance classifications
sought by CSEA-SEA. Thus the custodians, although not classified as
maintenance employees by the University, are traditionally included in
maintenance-type units under existing Board policy. In the circumstances
present here, any action involving the custodians requires that the same
action be taken with respect to food service employees because of the close
community of interest and interchangeability in job functions among
employees in the two categories. The graphics and publications employees
whom CSEA-SEA would also include would most properly belong in units
covering employees at Press. However, in view of the fact that these
employees have been excluded from the existing units at Press and now
constitute a residual group which no union seeks to represent separately,

®The Employer and USE each filed motions to correct the transcript. USE
also filed objections to the Employer's motion to correct the transcript.
No responses to the motions and objections have been received from any
other party to the proceeding. Accordingly, to the extent that USE and
the Employer's motions to correct the transcript are not in conflict, they
are hereby granted. In all other respects, the motions are hereby denied.
7 CSE A-SEA contends that USE and WAC are a single entity and that their
representations that they are separate organizations should disqualify
them from participating in this proceeding. CSEA-SEA also contends that
WAC does not qualify as a labor organization within the meaning of
Section 2(5) of the Act. We find no merit in these contentions. The
record evidence shows that, although WAC was at one time a subgroup
within USE, the two organizations have separated over a policy
disagreement, and USE and WAC now function as separate independent
entities. The record evidence further shows that each of these
organizations claims to represent certain employees of the Employer for
purposes of improving wages, hours, and terms and conditions of
employment. Accordingly, we conclude that USE and WAC are separate
entities and that each qualifies as a labor organization within the meaning
of Section 2(5) of the Act.

However, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, we assume that the
Teamsters has not abandoned this unit position.
plant office department performs general maintenance for the
SLAC complex.
13 Th e same situation is presented with respect to maintenance functions at
SLAC. The Teamsters would include the plant office department which
performs a wide variety of maintenance functions, but exclude the plant
engineering department which performs maintenance services for the
various research groups. However, in many cases, employees from both
departments work together in performing a particular job function.
4 On the basis of this same evidence, we conclude that the units urged by
Machinists and IBEW are also inappropriate for purposes of collective
bargaining. The Machinists unit of maintenance technicians would
exclude general maintenance employees whom we have found have a
close community of interest with the technicians performing laboratory
support functions. IBEW's request for a separate craft unit of
electricians cannot be sustained in light of the evidence demonstrating
that the University's maintenance operations produce an overlap in craft
skills and a commingling of employees performing craft functions.
University Press, hereinafter referred to as Press, has
approximately 70 employees, the majority of whom are represented by
various printing trades unions. It would appear that the only
unrepresented employees at Press are the graphic technicians and
proofreaders.
'®lt would appear from the record that CSEA-SEA would be willing to
include police and firemen in their unit if the Board found that separate
units of these employees would not be appropriate.

19 While some of the University's clericals may not be performing typical
office clerical functions, the record evidence does not establish tf at any
identifiable segment of the clericals share a closer community of interest
with those in the unit than they ric with other clericals.

their inclusion in CSEA-SEA's unit would not be improper. Similar
considerations support CSEA-SEA's claims that the four audio-visual
operators be included in the unit. Although the record indicates that, due
to their separate and unique functions, the audio-visual operators do not
have a close community of interest with any other group of employees,
their function is to provide highly technical services to the various
departments, and hence they would appear likely to share common
interests with the laboratory support technicians being sought by
CSEA-SEA.
The Employer contends that CSEA-SEA should not be permitted to
exclude the University's clerical employees from their unit because the
clericals have a close community of interest with other university
employees, and in the past CSEA-SEA has attempted to bargain and serve
as spokesman for all university employees including the clericals. We J j
not agree. While it cannot be denied that all university employees sha.e
certain common interests, the Board's practice is not to include officc
clericals in what is essentially a maintenance unit because the two groups
do not share the same interests. 19 Nc>r do we attach any special
significance to the fact that in the past CSEA-SEA attempted to speak for
all university employees. No one disputes the fact that Stanford has
generally refused to recognize any organization as the representative of its
Over the years, Stanford's policy has been to meet with
employees individually or in groups to discuss any matters affecting the
employer-employee relationship. In several cases, these meetings between
Stanford and its employees produced changes in the University's policies
and practices. However, it seems clear from the record evidence that
Stanford steadfastly refused to confer or in any way deal with CSEA-SEA
or any other labor organization as the representative of the University's
employees. Accordingly, we find a complete absence of any bargaining
history affecting the employees here in question.2l
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance-service
unit sought by CSEA-SEA could be depending on the
disposition of the petitions pending before us requesting separate units for
police and firemen. Accordingly, we will reserve final judgment on the
appropriateness of CSEA-SEA's unit until we have ruled on the unit
requests by the Police Officers and Fire Fighters.
*
The Police Officers seeks a unit of all employees of the Stanford
University Police Department, excluding all other employees and
supervisors as defined in the Act. The police department employees are
classified together with firemen as protective services personnel, and both
the police and fire department are located in the same building. At the
hearing, all parties except WAC agreed that the Stanford police exercised
the typical security and protection functions required of policemen in
general and that a separate unit of police department employees would be
appropriate. WAC did not challenge the fact that the police department
employees here perform regular police duties, but it would nevertheless
include them in a residual unit with other classifications of employees. In
view of the undisputed evidence that police department employees are
guards within the meaning of the Act, the Board is precluded from finding
appropriate a unit which groups guards with other employces.23
Accordingly, as no other issues are raised with respect to this unit, we find
that a unit of all employees of the Stanford University Police Department,
excluding all other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act, is
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
*
The Eire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain. The Employer contends that the
firemen do not share a separate community of interest apart from other
employees. None of the other Unions involved in this proceeding seeks to
represent firemen either separately or as part of a larger unit.
The fire department employees like the police are classified by the
University as protective services personnel,24 and both departments arc
housed together in the same building on the main campus. The fire
department employees perform the usual fire fighting and fire prevention
services required of firemen in general. Firemen perform work exclusively
for cheir department, and there is no evidence of any interchange between
fire department employees and employees of other departments. No other
university personnel perform what might be termed a similar or
comparable function.
Although firemen enjoy the same general employee benefits as other
university personnel, their wage scale is determined on a separate basis and
is designed to be comparable with the wage rates received by firemen in the
surrounding communities.2s
Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, the absence ot any
bargaining history, and the fact that no labor organization seeks to
represent firemen in a broader unit, we find that a separate unit of firemen
is appropriate for purposes of bargaining.
The Employer also contends that fire captains are supervisors within
the meaning of the Act and therefore should be excluded from the unit.
The record evidence shows that with respect to organization the fire
department operates under the direction and control of the fire chief.
Reporting directly to the fire chief are two assistant chiefs who in turn arc
assisted by two battalion chiefs. The fire chief, assistant fire chiefs, and
battalion chiefs are all admitted supervisors. Below the battalion chicfs are
eight fire captains and approximately 35 firemen. The tire captains, whose
status is in dispute, have no authority to hire or discharge employees or
effectively to recommend such action. If a fireman commits an infraction
which is in direct contravention of department rules, the fire captain can
take action which may result in the employee's suspension; however, it
would appear that all such disciplinary matters arc subject to an
independent investigation and review and that the (ire captain has no
definitive role to play in the ultimate resolution of such matters. The fire
captains a.re directly responsible for the training of firemen and the upkeep
and maintenance of the department's fire equipment. Tire captains also
have the authority to direct fire fighting operations in the rare instances
when no superior officer is present. However, in carrying out this
responsibility, fire captains follow the routine operating procedures of the
department and have little opportunity to exercise independent judgment.
Accordingly, we find that the fire captains are more in the nature ol
leadmen than supervisors, and, therefore, we shall include them in the unit.
Finally, an issue is also raised with respect to the Fire l ighters'
failure to include all of the fire department's nonsupcrvisory personnel in
the unit. Although the record is somewhat Vague as to what, if any,
additional personnel arc administratively classified as part of the fire
department, the Employer contends that certain administrative and clerical
personnel located in the fire department headquarters building should he
included, as well as all student firemen. 26 We do not agree. The craft-type
unit sought here by the Fire Fighters is properly limited to those possessing
the skills aind exercising the responsibilities typically associated with
firemen. Accordingly, we shall exclude the administrative-clerical personnel
and student firemen from the unit.
*
In light of our findings that separate units of police and fire
department employees are appropriate, we now also find that the grouping
continued on next page

20 The only exceptions have been Stanford's recognition of various printing
trades unions as craft representatives of certain employees at Press and
its past recognition of the Meatcutters Union as representative for
employees of the University's commissary. The commissary as such is no
longer in existence.
There is no merit to the Employer's contention that it should have been
permitted to demonstrate that the sentiment among the office clericals
was in favor of vheir inclusion in any broad grouping of university
employees. The Board does not consider the subjective wishes of
employees in making its unit determinations. It is only after the
appropriate unit determinations are made that the Board has in some
instances permitted employees to determine their unit placement
through the means of a self-determination election.
22 While the overall unit urged by the Employer and USE might also be
appropriate, there is no labor organization eligible to proceed to an
election in this unit. No union has petitioned for an election in this unit,
and, although USE, as an intervenor, has requested an election in such a
unit, USE does not have u sufficient showing of interest to permit the
Board to treat USE as a cross-petitioner and direct an election in this
unit.
23 Section 9(b)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended.
24 The parties agree that firemen do not perform any security or
guard-type functions.
25 The Stanford University Fire Department is also party to several mutual
assistance pacts with fire deparvments in the neighboring communities.
would appear from the record that the student firemen do not have
the training and skill of regular Viremen and are unlikely to progress to
the point where they would be classified as firemen.

DECISION, ORDER, AND DIRECTION OE ELECTIONS
Upon petitions duly filed under Section 9(c) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, a hearing was held before Hearing Officers
Douglas H. Barton and Walter L. Kintz. Following the hearing and
pursuant to Section 102.67 of the National Labor Relations Board Rules
and Regulations, Series 8, as amended, and by direction of the Regional
Director for Region 20, this proceeding was transferred to the National
Labor Relations Board for decision. Thereafter, briefs were Filed with the
Board by the Teamsters, the Fire l ighters, the Police Officers, CSEA-SEA,
USE, and the Employer.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(b) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, the National Labor Relations Board has
delegated its authority in this proceeding to a three-member panel.
The Board has reviewed the rulings of the Hearing Officers made at
the hearing and finds that they are free from prejudicial error. They are
hereby affirmed.
*
Upon the entire record in this proceeding, the Board finds:
1. The Employer, Leland Stanford Jr. University, is a private
nonprofit institution of higher learning which was founded under a trust
agreement executed in 1885 and thereafter confirmed in the constitution
of the State of California. Its operating income for the fiscal year
ending August 31, 1969, was $150,610,560, of which approximately
$112,000,000 came from sources outside the State of California. During
this same period, it purchased goods and services valued at approximately
$48 million, and, of this sum, approximately $9 million involved
expenditures outside the State of California.
The undisputed evidence shows that the Employer meets the
jurisdictional standard for colleges and universities set forth in Section
103.1 of the Board's Rules and Regulations. Accordingly, we find that the
Employer is engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Act, and it
will effectuate the policies of the Act to assert jurisdiction herein.
2. We find that the Petitioners and Intervenors involved in this
proceeding are labor organizations seeking to represent certain employees
of the Employer.'
3. A question affecting commerce exists concerning the
representation of certain employees of the Employer within the meaning
of Sections 9(c)( 1) and 2(6) and (7) of the Act.
4. Stanford's main campus is located on the San Francisco
Peninsula about 30 miles south of San Francisco, California, and consists
of 1,150 contiguous acres that are not part of any municipality. Stanford
also uses for academic purposes a 4,000 acre site approximately 2 miles
from the main campus at which the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center is
located. The University is made up of approximately 218 academic and
nonacademic departments and major subdepartments which are under the
overall control of the University's president and five vice presidents.
Stanford employs approximately 7,000 individuals, included among which
are 1,250 faculty members, 2,000 supervisory or professional employees,
2,200 clericals, and 1,500 employees in maintenance, service, or technical
All but about 50 of these employees perform their duties
and functions at locations on the San Francisco Peninsula.
*
At issue in this proceeding are the nonsupervisory and
nonprofessional employees employed by Stanford, including employees
employed at Stanford University Press and Stanford Hospital. No party
seeks to include faculty members or professional employees of the
University in any of the proposed units. At the hearing the following unit
positions were urged by the respective parties:
(1) The Teamsters seeks a unit of all physical plant department
employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and supervisors as
defined in the Act. In the event the Board finds such a unit to be
inappropriate, the Teamsters has requested an alternative unit comprised of
all maintenance employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and
supervisors.
(2) The Fire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain.
(3) The Police Officers has requested a unit of all employees of the
Stanford University Police Department, excluding all other employees, and
supervisors as defined in the Act.
(4) CSEA-SEA seeks a unit of all employees engaged in service,
maintenance, and technical positions, excluding firemen, clerical
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(5) Machinists seeks a unit of all laboratory mechanicians., physical
science and engineering technicians, and maintenance machinists employed
at the Employer's main campus and at SLAC, excluding all other
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(6) USE seeks a unit of all nonprofessional full-time and part-time
permanent and seasonal employees of the University, including all
employees of the Stanford Press not currently represented, but excluding
all nonstudent firemen, all currently represented employees, professional
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(7) WAC contends that elections should be directed in three
separate units: (1) the unit sought by the Fire Fighters, (2) the unit sought
by the Teamsters, and (3) a residual unit of all other employees, excluding
only professional employees and supervisors.
(8) IBEW seeks a unit of all journeymen and apprentice electricians
employed by the University, excluding all other employees.
(9) UE expressed no unit position.
(10) Laborers also took no unit position but indicated its desire to
be on the ballot in any election in an overall unit or for any residual unit
from which one or more crafts have been severed.
(11) The Employer contends that two units are appropriate. One
would be a unit of all nonsupervisory, nonprofessional employees
employed by the University within the State of California, excluding
employees of Stanford Hospital, employees of Stanford University Press
who are currently represented, students, part-time and casual employees,
confidential employees, and guards. The second would be a unit of all
employees of the Stanford University Police Department, excluding all
other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act.
As the foregoing indicates, there is a considerable difference of
opinion among the parties over what constitutes the appropriate unit or
units for purposes of collective bargaining. These positions range in scope
from requests for various types of craft and departmental units to units
encompassing all nonprofessional employees employed by the University.
In such cases, it is not the Board's function to determine^ which unit or
units might be the most appropriate. Rather, the Board's role in such
circumstances is to determine which, if any, of the petitioned-for units can
be considered appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
Accordingly with these considerations in mind, we shall examine the units
requested.
*
As previously indicated, the Teamsters has requested a unit of all
physical plant department employees. The physical plant department is
one of 16 nonacademic departments which arc under the overall control of
the vice president for business affairs. The department performs a myriad
of activities, including the operation of the campus utility systems, the
maintenance of buildings, roads, and grounds, and the furnishing of
audiovisual services. The physical plant department consists of
approximately IH7 employees in 37 different job classifications. Although
the physical plant department has a central headquarters location, most of
the work is performed away from the shop. There is no common
supervision, wages, or hours of work among the employees in the physical
plant department Also many of the other university departments employ
individuals in the same job classifications as those in the physical plant
department,lo and it is not uncommon for employees in the physical plant
department to work in conjunction with employees of similar skills from
other departments. Perhaps even more significant is the fact that these
other departments perform many of the same job functions as the
employees in the physical plant department and, hence, there are only a
few categories of work assignment which are performed exclusively by the
employees in the physical plant department. Accordingly, on the basis of
the foregoing, we conclude that there is no separate identity of interest
among employees of the physical plant department from that of other
employees which would justify a finding that such a unit could be
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
The Teamsters alternative unit position covers a broader grouping of
maintenance personnel.'' While the unit in question is not precisely

defined, it is clear that it would include employees of the physical plant
department and the plant office department at SLAC, 12 pius employees
performing custodial duties at the University. The unit as described covers
employees in some 20 different departments. However, with the possible
exception of the physical plant department, the Teamsters is not seeking
all the employees in any one department. The unit purports to include all
employees performing maintenance type functions at the University, but
specifically excluded from the unit are several categories of employees
whose work is closely related to that of the unit employees. For example,
physical science and engineering technicians repair and calibrate every type
of electronic and mechanical equipment and on many occasions they work
side-by-side with other journeyman craftsmen who are part of the
proposed Teamsters maintenance unit. Also specifically excluded are the
laboratory mechanicians who possess the same basic skills as the
journeyman mechanics but specialize in the assembly, installation, and
repair of various types of laboratory equipment. Many of the job functions
performed by these laboratory support people are identical with those
performed by the journeyman craftsmen in the Finally, the
Teamsters would include employees performing custodial services, but it
would exclude the food service employees whose interests are closely allied
with those of the custodial employees. A large percentage of the custodial
employees share common supervision and have day-to-day contact with the
food service employees. Furthermore, during the summer months when
food services are reduced, approximately one-half of the food service
employees reiain employment by transferring over to custodial jobs.
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance unit
sought by the Teamsters is too limited in scope to constitute an
appropriate unit of maintenance employees.! 4 Accordingly, as neither of
the Teamsters' requested units can be found to be appropriate for purposes
of collective bargaining, we shall dismiss the petition filed in Case
20-RC-9202.
*
CSEA-SEA has petitioned for a unit of employees engaged in
service, maintenance, and technical positions. The unit as defined would
cover employees at both the main campus and SLAC and would include all
maintenance classifications, all laboratory support personnel, all food
service and custodial employees, and graphic technicians and proofreaders
at Stanford University Press.'s Specifically excluded from the unit are the
police and fire departments, each of which is being sought separately by
other Unions, a ll office clerical employees, and all library personnel, as
well as the general categories of managerial and professional employees,
guards, and all supervisors as defined in the Act. Both the Employer and
USE contend that this unit is too limited in scope and that the appropriate
unit should include all of the University's nonprofessional and
nonsupervisory employees.
There is considerable record testimony which would lend support to
a conclusion that an overall unit of nonprofessional and nonsupervisory
employees would be appropriate. For example, the University's personnel
and employment policies are for the most part standardized and most
university employees are covered by the same wage scale and program of
benefits.' 7 At the main campus, employees are centrally hired through the
University's personnel office, and, when a job opening occurs in a
particular department, employees throughout the University are permitted
to bid on the opening.
On the other hand, however, the unit being sought by CSEA-SEA is
essentially a grouping of all employees engaged in maintenance type
functions, and the Board has on several occasions held that an overall unit
of maintenance employees can be appropriate under certain
circumstances. as our previous findings indicate, the maintenance
functions at the University arc highly integrated, and there can be no
doubt that all the University's maintenance employees share a close
community of interest. There would also appear to be ample justification
for including in such a unit the various nonmaintenance classifications
sought by CSEA-SEA. Thus the custodians, although not classified as
maintenance employees by the University, are traditionally included in
maintenance-type units under existing Board policy. In the circumstances
present here, any action involving the custodians requires that the same
action be taken with respect to food service employees because of the close
community of interest and interchangeability in job functions among
employees in the two categories. The graphics and publications employees
whom CSEA-SEA would also include would most properly belong in units
covering employees at Press. However, in view of the fact that these
employees have been excluded from the existing units at Press and now
constitute a residual group which no union seeks to represent separately,

representations that they are separate organizations should disqualify
them from participating in this proceeding. CSEA-SEA also contends that
WAC does not qualify as a labor organization within the meaning of
Section 2(5) of the Act. We find no merit in these contentions. The
record evidence shows that, although WAC was at one time a subgroup
within USE, the two organizations have separated over a policy
disagreement, and USE and WAC now function as separate independent
entities. The record evidence further shows that each of these
organizations claims to represent certain employees of the Employer for
purposes of improving wages, hours, and terms and conditions of
employment. Accordingly, we conclude that USE and WAC are separate
entities and that each qualifies as a labor organization within the meaning
of Section 2(5) of the Act.

plant office department performs general maintenance for the
SLAC complex.
13 Th e same situation is presented with respect to maintenance functions at
SLAC. The Teamsters would include the plant office department which
performs a wide variety of maintenance functions, but exclude the plant
engineering department which performs maintenance services for the
various research groups. However, in many cases, employees from both
departments work together in performing a particular job function.
4 On the basis of this same evidence, we conclude that the units urged by
Machinists and IBEW are also inappropriate for purposes of collective
bargaining. The Machinists unit of maintenance technicians would
exclude general maintenance employees whom we have found have a
close community of interest with the technicians performing laboratory
support functions. IBEW's request for a separate craft unit of
electricians cannot be sustained in light of the evidence demonstrating
that the University's maintenance operations produce an overlap in craft
skills and a commingling of employees performing craft functions.
University Press, hereinafter referred to as Press, has
approximately 70 employees, the majority of whom are represented by
various printing trades unions. It would appear that the only
unrepresented employees at Press are the graphic technicians and
proofreaders.
'®lt would appear from the record that CSEA-SEA would be willing to
include police and firemen in their unit if the Board found that separate
units of these employees would not be appropriate.

19 While some of the University's clericals may not be performing typical
office clerical functions, the record evidence does not establish tf at any
identifiable segment of the clericals share a closer community of interest
with those in the unit than they ric with other clericals.

their inclusion in CSEA-SEA's unit would not be improper. Similar
considerations support CSEA-SEA's claims that the four audio-visual
operators be included in the unit. Although the record indicates that, due
to their separate and unique functions, the audio-visual operators do not
have a close community of interest with any other group of employees,
their function is to provide highly technical services to the various
departments, and hence they would appear likely to share common
interests with the laboratory support technicians being sought by
CSEA-SEA.
The Employer contends that CSEA-SEA should not be permitted to
exclude the University's clerical employees from their unit because the
clericals have a close community of interest with other university
employees, and in the past CSEA-SEA has attempted to bargain and serve
as spokesman for all university employees including the clericals. We J j
not agree. While it cannot be denied that all university employees sha.e
certain common interests, the Board's practice is not to include officc
clericals in what is essentially a maintenance unit because the two groups
do not share the same interests. 19 Nc>r do we attach any special
significance to the fact that in the past CSEA-SEA attempted to speak for
all university employees. No one disputes the fact that Stanford has
generally refused to recognize any organization as the representative of its
Over the years, Stanford's policy has been to meet with
employees individually or in groups to discuss any matters affecting the
employer-employee relationship. In several cases, these meetings between
Stanford and its employees produced changes in the University's policies
and practices. However, it seems clear from the record evidence that
Stanford steadfastly refused to confer or in any way deal with CSEA-SEA
or any other labor organization as the representative of the University's
employees. Accordingly, we find a complete absence of any bargaining
history affecting the employees here in question.2l
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance-service
unit sought by CSEA-SEA could be depending on the
disposition of the petitions pending before us requesting separate units for
police and firemen. Accordingly, we will reserve final judgment on the
appropriateness of CSEA-SEA's unit until we have ruled on the unit
requests by the Police Officers and Fire Fighters.
*
The Police Officers seeks a unit of all employees of the Stanford
University Police Department, excluding all other employees and
supervisors as defined in the Act. The police department employees are
classified together with firemen as protective services personnel, and both
the police and fire department are located in the same building. At the
hearing, all parties except WAC agreed that the Stanford police exercised
the typical security and protection functions required of policemen in
general and that a separate unit of police department employees would be
appropriate. WAC did not challenge the fact that the police department
employees here perform regular police duties, but it would nevertheless
include them in a residual unit with other classifications of employees. In
view of the undisputed evidence that police department employees are
guards within the meaning of the Act, the Board is precluded from finding
appropriate a unit which groups guards with other employces.23
Accordingly, as no other issues are raised with respect to this unit, we find
that a unit of all employees of the Stanford University Police Department,
excluding all other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act, is
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
*
The Eire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain. The Employer contends that the
firemen do not share a separate community of interest apart from other
employees. None of the other Unions involved in this proceeding seeks to
represent firemen either separately or as part of a larger unit.
The fire department employees like the police are classified by the
University as protective services personnel,24 and both departments arc
housed together in the same building on the main campus. The fire
department employees perform the usual fire fighting and fire prevention
services required of firemen in general. Firemen perform work exclusively
for cheir department, and there is no evidence of any interchange between
fire department employees and employees of other departments. No other
university personnel perform what might be termed a similar or
comparable function.
Although firemen enjoy the same general employee benefits as other
university personnel, their wage scale is determined on a separate basis and
is designed to be comparable with the wage rates received by firemen in the
surrounding communities.2s
Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, the absence ot any
bargaining history, and the fact that no labor organization seeks to
represent firemen in a broader unit, we find that a separate unit of firemen
is appropriate for purposes of bargaining.
The Employer also contends that fire captains are supervisors within
the meaning of the Act and therefore should be excluded from the unit.
The record evidence shows that with respect to organization the fire
department operates under the direction and control of the fire chief.
Reporting directly to the fire chief are two assistant chiefs who in turn arc
assisted by two battalion chiefs. The fire chief, assistant fire chiefs, and
battalion chiefs are all admitted supervisors. Below the battalion chicfs are
eight fire captains and approximately 35 firemen. The tire captains, whose
status is in dispute, have no authority to hire or discharge employees or
effectively to recommend such action. If a fireman commits an infraction
which is in direct contravention of department rules, the fire captain can
take action which may result in the employee's suspension; however, it
would appear that all such disciplinary matters arc subject to an
independent investigation and review and that the (ire captain has no
definitive role to play in the ultimate resolution of such matters. The fire
captains a.re directly responsible for the training of firemen and the upkeep
and maintenance of the department's fire equipment. Tire captains also
have the authority to direct fire fighting operations in the rare instances
when no superior officer is present. However, in carrying out this
responsibility, fire captains follow the routine operating procedures of the
department and have little opportunity to exercise independent judgment.
Accordingly, we find that the fire captains are more in the nature ol
leadmen than supervisors, and, therefore, we shall include them in the unit.
Finally, an issue is also raised with respect to the Fire l ighters'
failure to include all of the fire department's nonsupcrvisory personnel in
the unit. Although the record is somewhat Vague as to what, if any,
additional personnel arc administratively classified as part of the fire
department, the Employer contends that certain administrative and clerical
personnel located in the fire department headquarters building should he
included, as well as all student firemen. 26 We do not agree. The craft-type
unit sought here by the Fire Fighters is properly limited to those possessing
the skills aind exercising the responsibilities typically associated with
firemen. Accordingly, we shall exclude the administrative-clerical personnel
and student firemen from the unit.
*
In light of our findings that separate units of police and fire
department employees are appropriate, we now also find that the grouping
continued on next page

20 The only exceptions have been Stanford's recognition of various printing
trades unions as craft representatives of certain employees at Press and
its past recognition of the Meatcutters Union as representative for
employees of the University's commissary. The commissary as such is no
longer in existence.
There is no merit to the Employer's contention that it should have been
permitted to demonstrate that the sentiment among the office clericals
was in favor of vheir inclusion in any broad grouping of university
employees. The Board does not consider the subjective wishes of
employees in making its unit determinations. It is only after the
appropriate unit determinations are made that the Board has in some
instances permitted employees to determine their unit placement
through the means of a self-determination election.
22 While the overall unit urged by the Employer and USE might also be
appropriate, there is no labor organization eligible to proceed to an
election in this unit. No union has petitioned for an election in this unit,
and, although USE, as an intervenor, has requested an election in such a
unit, USE does not have u sufficient showing of interest to permit the
Board to treat USE as a cross-petitioner and direct an election in this
unit.

24 The parties agree that firemen do not perform any security or
guard-type functions.
25 The Stanford University Fire Department is also party to several mutual
assistance pacts with fire deparvments in the neighboring communities.
would appear from the record that the student firemen do not have
the training and skill of regular Viremen and are unlikely to progress to
the point where they would be classified as firemen.

DECISION, ORDER, AND DIRECTION OE ELECTIONS
Upon petitions duly filed under Section 9(c) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, a hearing was held before Hearing Officers
Douglas H. Barton and Walter L. Kintz. Following the hearing and
pursuant to Section 102.67 of the National Labor Relations Board Rules
and Regulations, Series 8, as amended, and by direction of the Regional
Director for Region 20, this proceeding was transferred to the National
Labor Relations Board for decision. Thereafter, briefs were Filed with the
Board by the Teamsters, the Fire l ighters, the Police Officers, CSEA-SEA,
USE, and the Employer.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(b) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, the National Labor Relations Board has
delegated its authority in this proceeding to a three-member panel.
The Board has reviewed the rulings of the Hearing Officers made at
the hearing and finds that they are free from prejudicial error. They are
hereby affirmed.
*
Upon the entire record in this proceeding, the Board finds:
1. The Employer, Leland Stanford Jr. University, is a private
nonprofit institution of higher learning which was founded under a trust
agreement executed in 1885 and thereafter confirmed in the constitution
of the State of California. Its operating income for the fiscal year
ending August 31, 1969, was $150,610,560, of which approximately
$112,000,000 came from sources outside the State of California. During
this same period, it purchased goods and services valued at approximately
$48 million, and, of this sum, approximately $9 million involved
expenditures outside the State of California.
The undisputed evidence shows that the Employer meets the
jurisdictional standard for colleges and universities set forth in Section
103.1 of the Board's Rules and Regulations. Accordingly, we find that the
Employer is engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Act, and it
will effectuate the policies of the Act to assert jurisdiction herein.
2. We find that the Petitioners and Intervenors involved in this
proceeding are labor organizations seeking to represent certain employees
of the Employer.'
3. A question affecting commerce exists concerning the
representation of certain employees of the Employer within the meaning
of Sections 9(c)( 1) and 2(6) and (7) of the Act.
4. Stanford's main campus is located on the San Francisco
Peninsula about 30 miles south of San Francisco, California, and consists
of 1,150 contiguous acres that are not part of any municipality. Stanford
also uses for academic purposes a 4,000 acre site approximately 2 miles
from the main campus at which the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center is
located. The University is made up of approximately 218 academic and
nonacademic departments and major subdepartments which are under the
overall control of the University's president and five vice presidents.
Stanford employs approximately 7,000 individuals, included among which
are 1,250 faculty members, 2,000 supervisory or professional employees,
2,200 clericals, and 1,500 employees in maintenance, service, or technical
All but about 50 of these employees perform their duties
and functions at locations on the San Francisco Peninsula.
*
At issue in this proceeding are the nonsupervisory and
nonprofessional employees employed by Stanford, including employees
employed at Stanford University Press and Stanford Hospital. No party
seeks to include faculty members or professional employees of the
University in any of the proposed units. At the hearing the following unit
positions were urged by the respective parties:
(1) The Teamsters seeks a unit of all physical plant department
employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and supervisors as
defined in the Act. In the event the Board finds such a unit to be
inappropriate, the Teamsters has requested an alternative unit comprised of
all maintenance employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and
supervisors.
(2) The Fire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain.
(3) The Police Officers has requested a unit of all employees of the
Stanford University Police Department, excluding all other employees, and
supervisors as defined in the Act.
(4) CSEA-SEA seeks a unit of all employees engaged in service,
maintenance, and technical positions, excluding firemen, clerical
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(5) Machinists seeks a unit of all laboratory mechanicians., physical
science and engineering technicians, and maintenance machinists employed
at the Employer's main campus and at SLAC, excluding all other
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(6) USE seeks a unit of all nonprofessional full-time and part-time
permanent and seasonal employees of the University, including all
employees of the Stanford Press not currently represented, but excluding
all nonstudent firemen, all currently represented employees, professional
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(7) WAC contends that elections should be directed in three
separate units: (1) the unit sought by the Fire Fighters, (2) the unit sought
by the Teamsters, and (3) a residual unit of all other employees, excluding
only professional employees and supervisors.
(8) IBEW seeks a unit of all journeymen and apprentice electricians
employed by the University, excluding all other employees.
(9) UE expressed no unit position.
(10) Laborers also took no unit position but indicated its desire to
be on the ballot in any election in an overall unit or for any residual unit
from which one or more crafts have been severed.
(11) The Employer contends that two units are appropriate. One
would be a unit of all nonsupervisory, nonprofessional employees
employed by the University within the State of California, excluding
employees of Stanford Hospital, employees of Stanford University Press
who are currently represented, students, part-time and casual employees,
confidential employees, and guards. The second would be a unit of all
employees of the Stanford University Police Department, excluding all
other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act.
As the foregoing indicates, there is a considerable difference of
opinion among the parties over what constitutes the appropriate unit or
units for purposes of collective bargaining. These positions range in scope
from requests for various types of craft and departmental units to units
encompassing all nonprofessional employees employed by the University.
In such cases, it is not the Board's function to determine^ which unit or
units might be the most appropriate. Rather, the Board's role in such
circumstances is to determine which, if any, of the petitioned-for units can
be considered appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
Accordingly with these considerations in mind, we shall examine the units
requested.
*
As previously indicated, the Teamsters has requested a unit of all
physical plant department employees. The physical plant department is
one of 16 nonacademic departments which arc under the overall control of
the vice president for business affairs. The department performs a myriad
of activities, including the operation of the campus utility systems, the
maintenance of buildings, roads, and grounds, and the furnishing of
audiovisual services. The physical plant department consists of
approximately IH7 employees in 37 different job classifications. Although
the physical plant department has a central headquarters location, most of
the work is performed away from the shop. There is no common
supervision, wages, or hours of work among the employees in the physical
plant department Also many of the other university departments employ
individuals in the same job classifications as those in the physical plant
department,lo and it is not uncommon for employees in the physical plant
department to work in conjunction with employees of similar skills from
other departments. Perhaps even more significant is the fact that these
other departments perform many of the same job functions as the
employees in the physical plant department and, hence, there are only a
few categories of work assignment which are performed exclusively by the
employees in the physical plant department. Accordingly, on the basis of
the foregoing, we conclude that there is no separate identity of interest
among employees of the physical plant department from that of other
employees which would justify a finding that such a unit could be
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
The Teamsters alternative unit position covers a broader grouping of
maintenance personnel.'' While the unit in question is not precisely

defined, it is clear that it would include employees of the physical plant
department and the plant office department at SLAC, 12 pius employees
performing custodial duties at the University. The unit as described covers
employees in some 20 different departments. However, with the possible
exception of the physical plant department, the Teamsters is not seeking
all the employees in any one department. The unit purports to include all
employees performing maintenance type functions at the University, but
specifically excluded from the unit are several categories of employees
whose work is closely related to that of the unit employees. For example,
physical science and engineering technicians repair and calibrate every type
of electronic and mechanical equipment and on many occasions they work
side-by-side with other journeyman craftsmen who are part of the
proposed Teamsters maintenance unit. Also specifically excluded are the
laboratory mechanicians who possess the same basic skills as the
journeyman mechanics but specialize in the assembly, installation, and
repair of various types of laboratory equipment. Many of the job functions
performed by these laboratory support people are identical with those
performed by the journeyman craftsmen in the Finally, the
Teamsters would include employees performing custodial services, but it
would exclude the food service employees whose interests are closely allied
with those of the custodial employees. A large percentage of the custodial
employees share common supervision and have day-to-day contact with the
food service employees. Furthermore, during the summer months when
food services are reduced, approximately one-half of the food service
employees reiain employment by transferring over to custodial jobs.
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance unit
sought by the Teamsters is too limited in scope to constitute an
appropriate unit of maintenance employees.! 4 Accordingly, as neither of
the Teamsters' requested units can be found to be appropriate for purposes
of collective bargaining, we shall dismiss the petition filed in Case
20-RC-9202.
*
CSEA-SEA has petitioned for a unit of employees engaged in
service, maintenance, and technical positions. The unit as defined would
cover employees at both the main campus and SLAC and would include all
maintenance classifications, all laboratory support personnel, all food
service and custodial employees, and graphic technicians and proofreaders
at Stanford University Press.'s Specifically excluded from the unit are the
police and fire departments, each of which is being sought separately by
other Unions, a ll office clerical employees, and all library personnel, as
well as the general categories of managerial and professional employees,
guards, and all supervisors as defined in the Act. Both the Employer and
USE contend that this unit is too limited in scope and that the appropriate
unit should include all of the University's nonprofessional and
nonsupervisory employees.
There is considerable record testimony which would lend support to
a conclusion that an overall unit of nonprofessional and nonsupervisory
employees would be appropriate. For example, the University's personnel
and employment policies are for the most part standardized and most
university employees are covered by the same wage scale and program of
benefits.' 7 At the main campus, employees are centrally hired through the
University's personnel office, and, when a job opening occurs in a
particular department, employees throughout the University are permitted
to bid on the opening.
On the other hand, however, the unit being sought by CSEA-SEA is
essentially a grouping of all employees engaged in maintenance type
functions, and the Board has on several occasions held that an overall unit
of maintenance employees can be appropriate under certain
circumstances. as our previous findings indicate, the maintenance
functions at the University arc highly integrated, and there can be no
doubt that all the University's maintenance employees share a close
community of interest. There would also appear to be ample justification
for including in such a unit the various nonmaintenance classifications
sought by CSEA-SEA. Thus the custodians, although not classified as
maintenance employees by the University, are traditionally included in
maintenance-type units under existing Board policy. In the circumstances
present here, any action involving the custodians requires that the same
action be taken with respect to food service employees because of the close
community of interest and interchangeability in job functions among
employees in the two categories. The graphics and publications employees
whom CSEA-SEA would also include would most properly belong in units
covering employees at Press. However, in view of the fact that these
employees have been excluded from the existing units at Press and now
constitute a residual group which no union seeks to represent separately,

13 Th e same situation is presented with respect to maintenance functions at
SLAC. The Teamsters would include the plant office department which

various research groups. However, in many cases, employees from both
departments work together in performing a particular job function.
4 On the basis of this same evidence, we conclude that the units urged by
Machinists and IBEW are also inappropriate for purposes of collective
bargaining. The Machinists unit of maintenance technicians would
exclude general maintenance employees whom we have found have a
close community of interest with the technicians performing laboratory
support functions. IBEW's request for a separate craft unit of
electricians cannot be sustained in light of the evidence demonstrating
that the University's maintenance operations produce an overlap in craft
skills and a commingling of employees performing craft functions.

their inclusion in CSEA-SEA's unit would not be improper. Similar
considerations support CSEA-SEA's claims that the four audio-visual
operators be included in the unit. Although the record indicates that, due
to their separate and unique functions, the audio-visual operators do not
have a close community of interest with any other group of employees,
their function is to provide highly technical services to the various
departments, and hence they would appear likely to share common
interests with the laboratory support technicians being sought by
CSEA-SEA.
The Employer contends that CSEA-SEA should not be permitted to
exclude the University's clerical employees from their unit because the
clericals have a close community of interest with other university
employees, and in the past CSEA-SEA has attempted to bargain and serve
as spokesman for all university employees including the clericals. We J j
not agree. While it cannot be denied that all university employees sha.e
certain common interests, the Board's practice is not to include officc
clericals in what is essentially a maintenance unit because the two groups
do not share the same interests. 19 Nc>r do we attach any special
significance to the fact that in the past CSEA-SEA attempted to speak for
all university employees. No one disputes the fact that Stanford has
generally refused to recognize any organization as the representative of its
Over the years, Stanford's policy has been to meet with
employees individually or in groups to discuss any matters affecting the
employer-employee relationship. In several cases, these meetings between
Stanford and its employees produced changes in the University's policies
and practices. However, it seems clear from the record evidence that
Stanford steadfastly refused to confer or in any way deal with CSEA-SEA
or any other labor organization as the representative of the University's
employees. Accordingly, we find a complete absence of any bargaining
history affecting the employees here in question.2l
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance-service
unit sought by CSEA-SEA could be depending on the
disposition of the petitions pending before us requesting separate units for
police and firemen. Accordingly, we will reserve final judgment on the
appropriateness of CSEA-SEA's unit until we have ruled on the unit
requests by the Police Officers and Fire Fighters.
*
The Police Officers seeks a unit of all employees of the Stanford
University Police Department, excluding all other employees and
supervisors as defined in the Act. The police department employees are
classified together with firemen as protective services personnel, and both
the police and fire department are located in the same building. At the
hearing, all parties except WAC agreed that the Stanford police exercised
the typical security and protection functions required of policemen in
general and that a separate unit of police department employees would be
appropriate. WAC did not challenge the fact that the police department
employees here perform regular police duties, but it would nevertheless
include them in a residual unit with other classifications of employees. In
view of the undisputed evidence that police department employees are
guards within the meaning of the Act, the Board is precluded from finding
appropriate a unit which groups guards with other employces.23
Accordingly, as no other issues are raised with respect to this unit, we find
that a unit of all employees of the Stanford University Police Department,
excluding all other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act, is
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
*
The Eire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain. The Employer contends that the
firemen do not share a separate community of interest apart from other
employees. None of the other Unions involved in this proceeding seeks to
represent firemen either separately or as part of a larger unit.
The fire department employees like the police are classified by the
University as protective services personnel,24 and both departments arc
housed together in the same building on the main campus. The fire
department employees perform the usual fire fighting and fire prevention
services required of firemen in general. Firemen perform work exclusively
for cheir department, and there is no evidence of any interchange between
fire department employees and employees of other departments. No other
university personnel perform what might be termed a similar or
comparable function.
Although firemen enjoy the same general employee benefits as other
university personnel, their wage scale is determined on a separate basis and
is designed to be comparable with the wage rates received by firemen in the
surrounding communities.2s
Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, the absence ot any
bargaining history, and the fact that no labor organization seeks to
represent firemen in a broader unit, we find that a separate unit of firemen
is appropriate for purposes of bargaining.
The Employer also contends that fire captains are supervisors within
the meaning of the Act and therefore should be excluded from the unit.
The record evidence shows that with respect to organization the fire
department operates under the direction and control of the fire chief.
Reporting directly to the fire chief are two assistant chiefs who in turn arc
assisted by two battalion chiefs. The fire chief, assistant fire chiefs, and
battalion chiefs are all admitted supervisors. Below the battalion chicfs are
eight fire captains and approximately 35 firemen. The tire captains, whose
status is in dispute, have no authority to hire or discharge employees or
effectively to recommend such action. If a fireman commits an infraction
which is in direct contravention of department rules, the fire captain can
take action which may result in the employee's suspension; however, it
would appear that all such disciplinary matters arc subject to an
independent investigation and review and that the (ire captain has no
definitive role to play in the ultimate resolution of such matters. The fire
captains a.re directly responsible for the training of firemen and the upkeep
and maintenance of the department's fire equipment. Tire captains also
have the authority to direct fire fighting operations in the rare instances
when no superior officer is present. However, in carrying out this
responsibility, fire captains follow the routine operating procedures of the
department and have little opportunity to exercise independent judgment.
Accordingly, we find that the fire captains are more in the nature ol
leadmen than supervisors, and, therefore, we shall include them in the unit.
Finally, an issue is also raised with respect to the Fire l ighters'
failure to include all of the fire department's nonsupcrvisory personnel in
the unit. Although the record is somewhat Vague as to what, if any,
additional personnel arc administratively classified as part of the fire
department, the Employer contends that certain administrative and clerical
personnel located in the fire department headquarters building should he
included, as well as all student firemen. 26 We do not agree. The craft-type
unit sought here by the Fire Fighters is properly limited to those possessing
the skills aind exercising the responsibilities typically associated with
firemen. Accordingly, we shall exclude the administrative-clerical personnel
and student firemen from the unit.
*
In light of our findings that separate units of police and fire
department employees are appropriate, we now also find that the grouping
continued on next page

20 The only exceptions have been Stanford's recognition of various printing
trades unions as craft representatives of certain employees at Press and
its past recognition of the Meatcutters Union as representative for
employees of the University's commissary. The commissary as such is no
longer in existence.
There is no merit to the Employer's contention that it should have been
permitted to demonstrate that the sentiment among the office clericals
was in favor of vheir inclusion in any broad grouping of university
employees. The Board does not consider the subjective wishes of
employees in making its unit determinations. It is only after the
appropriate unit determinations are made that the Board has in some
instances permitted employees to determine their unit placement
through the means of a self-determination election.
22 While the overall unit urged by the Employer and USE might also be
appropriate, there is no labor organization eligible to proceed to an
election in this unit. No union has petitioned for an election in this unit,
and, although USE, as an intervenor, has requested an election in such a
unit, USE does not have u sufficient showing of interest to permit the
Board to treat USE as a cross-petitioner and direct an election in this
unit.

guard-type functions.

would appear from the record that the student firemen do not have
the training and skill of regular Viremen and are unlikely to progress to
the point where they would be classified as firemen.

DECISION, ORDER, AND DIRECTION OE ELECTIONS
Upon petitions duly filed under Section 9(c) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, a hearing was held before Hearing Officers
Douglas H. Barton and Walter L. Kintz. Following the hearing and
pursuant to Section 102.67 of the National Labor Relations Board Rules
and Regulations, Series 8, as amended, and by direction of the Regional
Director for Region 20, this proceeding was transferred to the National
Labor Relations Board for decision. Thereafter, briefs were Filed with the
Board by the Teamsters, the Fire l ighters, the Police Officers, CSEA-SEA,
USE, and the Employer.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(b) of the National Labor
Relations Act, as amended, the National Labor Relations Board has
delegated its authority in this proceeding to a three-member panel.
The Board has reviewed the rulings of the Hearing Officers made at
the hearing and finds that they are free from prejudicial error. They are
hereby affirmed.
*
Upon the entire record in this proceeding, the Board finds:
1. The Employer, Leland Stanford Jr. University, is a private
nonprofit institution of higher learning which was founded under a trust
agreement executed in 1885 and thereafter confirmed in the constitution
of the State of California. Its operating income for the fiscal year
ending August 31, 1969, was $150,610,560, of which approximately
$112,000,000 came from sources outside the State of California. During
this same period, it purchased goods and services valued at approximately
$48 million, and, of this sum, approximately $9 million involved
expenditures outside the State of California.
The undisputed evidence shows that the Employer meets the
jurisdictional standard for colleges and universities set forth in Section
103.1 of the Board's Rules and Regulations. Accordingly, we find that the
Employer is engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Act, and it
will effectuate the policies of the Act to assert jurisdiction herein.
2. We find that the Petitioners and Intervenors involved in this
proceeding are labor organizations seeking to represent certain employees
of the Employer.'
3. A question affecting commerce exists concerning the
representation of certain employees of the Employer within the meaning
of Sections 9(c)( 1) and 2(6) and (7) of the Act.
4. Stanford's main campus is located on the San Francisco
Peninsula about 30 miles south of San Francisco, California, and consists
of 1,150 contiguous acres that are not part of any municipality. Stanford
also uses for academic purposes a 4,000 acre site approximately 2 miles
from the main campus at which the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center is
located. The University is made up of approximately 218 academic and
nonacademic departments and major subdepartments which are under the
overall control of the University's president and five vice presidents.
Stanford employs approximately 7,000 individuals, included among which
are 1,250 faculty members, 2,000 supervisory or professional employees,
2,200 clericals, and 1,500 employees in maintenance, service, or technical
All but about 50 of these employees perform their duties
and functions at locations on the San Francisco Peninsula.
*
At issue in this proceeding are the nonsupervisory and
nonprofessional employees employed by Stanford, including employees
employed at Stanford University Press and Stanford Hospital. No party
seeks to include faculty members or professional employees of the
University in any of the proposed units. At the hearing the following unit
positions were urged by the respective parties:
(1) The Teamsters seeks a unit of all physical plant department
employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and supervisors as
defined in the Act. In the event the Board finds such a unit to be
inappropriate, the Teamsters has requested an alternative unit comprised of
all maintenance employees, excluding all other employees, guards, and
supervisors.
(2) The Fire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain.
(3) The Police Officers has requested a unit of all employees of the
Stanford University Police Department, excluding all other employees, and
supervisors as defined in the Act.
(4) CSEA-SEA seeks a unit of all employees engaged in service,
maintenance, and technical positions, excluding firemen, clerical
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(5) Machinists seeks a unit of all laboratory mechanicians., physical
science and engineering technicians, and maintenance machinists employed
at the Employer's main campus and at SLAC, excluding all other
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(6) USE seeks a unit of all nonprofessional full-time and part-time
permanent and seasonal employees of the University, including all
employees of the Stanford Press not currently represented, but excluding
all nonstudent firemen, all currently represented employees, professional
employees, guards, and supervisors.
(7) WAC contends that elections should be directed in three
separate units: (1) the unit sought by the Fire Fighters, (2) the unit sought
by the Teamsters, and (3) a residual unit of all other employees, excluding
only professional employees and supervisors.
(8) IBEW seeks a unit of all journeymen and apprentice electricians
employed by the University, excluding all other employees.
(9) UE expressed no unit position.
(10) Laborers also took no unit position but indicated its desire to
be on the ballot in any election in an overall unit or for any residual unit
from which one or more crafts have been severed.
(11) The Employer contends that two units are appropriate. One
would be a unit of all nonsupervisory, nonprofessional employees
employed by the University within the State of California, excluding
employees of Stanford Hospital, employees of Stanford University Press
who are currently represented, students, part-time and casual employees,
confidential employees, and guards. The second would be a unit of all
employees of the Stanford University Police Department, excluding all
other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act.
As the foregoing indicates, there is a considerable difference of
opinion among the parties over what constitutes the appropriate unit or
units for purposes of collective bargaining. These positions range in scope
from requests for various types of craft and departmental units to units
encompassing all nonprofessional employees employed by the University.
In such cases, it is not the Board's function to determine^ which unit or
units might be the most appropriate. Rather, the Board's role in such
circumstances is to determine which, if any, of the petitioned-for units can
be considered appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
Accordingly with these considerations in mind, we shall examine the units
requested.
*
As previously indicated, the Teamsters has requested a unit of all
physical plant department employees. The physical plant department is
one of 16 nonacademic departments which arc under the overall control of
the vice president for business affairs. The department performs a myriad
of activities, including the operation of the campus utility systems, the
maintenance of buildings, roads, and grounds, and the furnishing of
audiovisual services. The physical plant department consists of
approximately IH7 employees in 37 different job classifications. Although
the physical plant department has a central headquarters location, most of
the work is performed away from the shop. There is no common
supervision, wages, or hours of work among the employees in the physical
plant department Also many of the other university departments employ
individuals in the same job classifications as those in the physical plant
department,lo and it is not uncommon for employees in the physical plant
department to work in conjunction with employees of similar skills from
other departments. Perhaps even more significant is the fact that these
other departments perform many of the same job functions as the
employees in the physical plant department and, hence, there are only a
few categories of work assignment which are performed exclusively by the
employees in the physical plant department. Accordingly, on the basis of
the foregoing, we conclude that there is no separate identity of interest
among employees of the physical plant department from that of other
employees which would justify a finding that such a unit could be
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
The Teamsters alternative unit position covers a broader grouping of
maintenance personnel.'' While the unit in question is not precisely

defined, it is clear that it would include employees of the physical plant
department and the plant office department at SLAC, 12 pius employees
performing custodial duties at the University. The unit as described covers
employees in some 20 different departments. However, with the possible
exception of the physical plant department, the Teamsters is not seeking
all the employees in any one department. The unit purports to include all
employees performing maintenance type functions at the University, but
specifically excluded from the unit are several categories of employees
whose work is closely related to that of the unit employees. For example,
physical science and engineering technicians repair and calibrate every type
of electronic and mechanical equipment and on many occasions they work
side-by-side with other journeyman craftsmen who are part of the
proposed Teamsters maintenance unit. Also specifically excluded are the
laboratory mechanicians who possess the same basic skills as the
journeyman mechanics but specialize in the assembly, installation, and
repair of various types of laboratory equipment. Many of the job functions
performed by these laboratory support people are identical with those
performed by the journeyman craftsmen in the Finally, the
Teamsters would include employees performing custodial services, but it
would exclude the food service employees whose interests are closely allied
with those of the custodial employees. A large percentage of the custodial
employees share common supervision and have day-to-day contact with the
food service employees. Furthermore, during the summer months when
food services are reduced, approximately one-half of the food service
employees reiain employment by transferring over to custodial jobs.
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance unit
sought by the Teamsters is too limited in scope to constitute an
appropriate unit of maintenance employees.! 4 Accordingly, as neither of
the Teamsters' requested units can be found to be appropriate for purposes
of collective bargaining, we shall dismiss the petition filed in Case
20-RC-9202.
*
CSEA-SEA has petitioned for a unit of employees engaged in
service, maintenance, and technical positions. The unit as defined would
cover employees at both the main campus and SLAC and would include all
maintenance classifications, all laboratory support personnel, all food
service and custodial employees, and graphic technicians and proofreaders
at Stanford University Press.'s Specifically excluded from the unit are the
police and fire departments, each of which is being sought separately by
other Unions, a ll office clerical employees, and all library personnel, as
well as the general categories of managerial and professional employees,
guards, and all supervisors as defined in the Act. Both the Employer and
USE contend that this unit is too limited in scope and that the appropriate
unit should include all of the University's nonprofessional and
nonsupervisory employees.
There is considerable record testimony which would lend support to
a conclusion that an overall unit of nonprofessional and nonsupervisory
employees would be appropriate. For example, the University's personnel
and employment policies are for the most part standardized and most
university employees are covered by the same wage scale and program of
benefits.' 7 At the main campus, employees are centrally hired through the
University's personnel office, and, when a job opening occurs in a
particular department, employees throughout the University are permitted
to bid on the opening.
On the other hand, however, the unit being sought by CSEA-SEA is
essentially a grouping of all employees engaged in maintenance type
functions, and the Board has on several occasions held that an overall unit
of maintenance employees can be appropriate under certain
circumstances. as our previous findings indicate, the maintenance
functions at the University arc highly integrated, and there can be no
doubt that all the University's maintenance employees share a close
community of interest. There would also appear to be ample justification
for including in such a unit the various nonmaintenance classifications
sought by CSEA-SEA. Thus the custodians, although not classified as
maintenance employees by the University, are traditionally included in
maintenance-type units under existing Board policy. In the circumstances
present here, any action involving the custodians requires that the same
action be taken with respect to food service employees because of the close
community of interest and interchangeability in job functions among
employees in the two categories. The graphics and publications employees
whom CSEA-SEA would also include would most properly belong in units
covering employees at Press. However, in view of the fact that these
employees have been excluded from the existing units at Press and now
constitute a residual group which no union seeks to represent separately,

®The Employer and USE each filed motions to correct the transcript. USE
also filed objections to the Employer's motion to correct the transcript.
No responses to the motions and objections have been received from any
other party to the proceeding. Accordingly, to the extent that USE and
the Employer's motions to correct the transcript are not in conflict, they
are hereby granted. In all other respects, the motions are hereby denied.
7 CSE A-SEA contends that USE and WAC are a single entity and that their
representations that they are separate organizations should disqualify
them from participating in this proceeding. CSEA-SEA also contends that
WAC does not qualify as a labor organization within the meaning of
Section 2(5) of the Act. We find no merit in these contentions. The
record evidence shows that, although WAC was at one time a subgroup
within USE, the two organizations have separated over a policy
disagreement, and USE and WAC now function as separate independent
entities. The record evidence further shows that each of these
organizations claims to represent certain employees of the Employer for
purposes of improving wages, hours, and terms and conditions of
employment. Accordingly, we conclude that USE and WAC are separate
entities and that each qualifies as a labor organization within the meaning
of Section 2(5) of the Act.

plant office department performs general maintenance for the
SLAC complex.
13 Th e same situation is presented with respect to maintenance functions at
SLAC. The Teamsters would include the plant office department which
performs a wide variety of maintenance functions, but exclude the plant
engineering department which performs maintenance services for the
various research groups. However, in many cases, employees from both
departments work together in performing a particular job function.
4 On the basis of this same evidence, we conclude that the units urged by
Machinists and IBEW are also inappropriate for purposes of collective
bargaining. The Machinists unit of maintenance technicians would
exclude general maintenance employees whom we have found have a
close community of interest with the technicians performing laboratory
support functions. IBEW's request for a separate craft unit of
electricians cannot be sustained in light of the evidence demonstrating
that the University's maintenance operations produce an overlap in craft
skills and a commingling of employees performing craft functions.
University Press, hereinafter referred to as Press, has
approximately 70 employees, the majority of whom are represented by
various printing trades unions. It would appear that the only
unrepresented employees at Press are the graphic technicians and
proofreaders.
'®lt would appear from the record that CSEA-SEA would be willing to
include police and firemen in their unit if the Board found that separate
units of these employees would not be appropriate.

their inclusion in CSEA-SEA's unit would not be improper. Similar
considerations support CSEA-SEA's claims that the four audio-visual
operators be included in the unit. Although the record indicates that, due
to their separate and unique functions, the audio-visual operators do not
have a close community of interest with any other group of employees,
their function is to provide highly technical services to the various
departments, and hence they would appear likely to share common
interests with the laboratory support technicians being sought by
CSEA-SEA.
The Employer contends that CSEA-SEA should not be permitted to
exclude the University's clerical employees from their unit because the
clericals have a close community of interest with other university
employees, and in the past CSEA-SEA has attempted to bargain and serve
as spokesman for all university employees including the clericals. We J j
not agree. While it cannot be denied that all university employees sha.e
certain common interests, the Board's practice is not to include officc
clericals in what is essentially a maintenance unit because the two groups
do not share the same interests. 19 Nc>r do we attach any special
significance to the fact that in the past CSEA-SEA attempted to speak for
all university employees. No one disputes the fact that Stanford has
generally refused to recognize any organization as the representative of its
Over the years, Stanford's policy has been to meet with
employees individually or in groups to discuss any matters affecting the
employer-employee relationship. In several cases, these meetings between
Stanford and its employees produced changes in the University's policies
and practices. However, it seems clear from the record evidence that
Stanford steadfastly refused to confer or in any way deal with CSEA-SEA
or any other labor organization as the representative of the University's
employees. Accordingly, we find a complete absence of any bargaining
history affecting the employees here in question.2l
In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the maintenance-service
unit sought by CSEA-SEA could be depending on the
disposition of the petitions pending before us requesting separate units for
police and firemen. Accordingly, we will reserve final judgment on the
appropriateness of CSEA-SEA's unit until we have ruled on the unit
requests by the Police Officers and Fire Fighters.
*
The Police Officers seeks a unit of all employees of the Stanford
University Police Department, excluding all other employees and
supervisors as defined in the Act. The police department employees are
classified together with firemen as protective services personnel, and both
the police and fire department are located in the same building. At the
hearing, all parties except WAC agreed that the Stanford police exercised
the typical security and protection functions required of policemen in
general and that a separate unit of police department employees would be
appropriate. WAC did not challenge the fact that the police department
employees here perform regular police duties, but it would nevertheless
include them in a residual unit with other classifications of employees. In
view of the undisputed evidence that police department employees are
guards within the meaning of the Act, the Board is precluded from finding
appropriate a unit which groups guards with other employces.23
Accordingly, as no other issues are raised with respect to this unit, we find
that a unit of all employees of the Stanford University Police Department,
excluding all other employees and supervisors as defined in the Act, is
appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.
*
The Eire Fighters seeks a unit of all firemen and fire captains
employed by Stanford at the headquarters station and at the SLAC
substation, but excluding all other employees, student firemen, and
employees above the rank of captain. The Employer contends that the

services required of firemen in general. Firemen perform work exclusively

fire department employees and employees of other departments. No other
university personnel perform what might be termed a similar or
comparable function.
Although firemen enjoy the same general employee benefits as other
university personnel, their wage scale is determined on a separate basis and
is designed to be comparable with the wage rates received by firemen in the
surrounding communities.2s
Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, the absence ot any
bargaining history, and the fact that no labor organization seeks to
represent firemen in a broader unit, we find that a separate unit of firemen
is appropriate for purposes of bargaining.
The Employer also contends that fire captains are supervisors within
the meaning of the Act and therefore should be excluded from the unit.
The record evidence shows that with respect to organization the fire
department operates under the direction and control of the fire chief.
Reporting directly to the fire chief are two assistant chiefs who in turn arc
assisted by two battalion chiefs. The fire chief, assistant fire chiefs, and
