# Five Card Stud
## High Stakes Poker Cashes In 
### JERRY COLEMAN 
With the demise of the football
season last quarter, and that of
baseball not yet upon the fans'
minds, the news scene focuses on
an old yet seldom advertised
campus sport: high stakes poker.
Sure, everyone has played
penny ante in their dorms and
fraternities. That pasttime is as
common as hamburger on the
Food Service menu.
But high stakes poker is
another story. It takes a different
breed of player and operates
under the weight of some fear.
Not fear of being busted, but
of being robbed, and that fear is
justified, for in any one night's
session, an average of $350 can
see its way to the table top.
To protect themselves, players
handle most of the evening's bets
in chips, and all bets are paid by
1.0. U. or check.
Still, a stack of silver dollars, a
fist full of greenbacks, and piles of
chips representing 25c, 50c, and
$1, belie the fact that $40 a night
changes hands per player.
The players concede that
although games are basically low
key, there are moments of
tension. In the words of one,
"When you stand to lose ten
bucks with a single move, there's
pressure on you."
The tensest moment of the
evening at a recent campus game
came at the game's very start
when the players had to adjust to

the fact that the Daily was
watching their moves. Hassles
were quickly overcome and a light
atmosphere took hold:
"Tell them we give green
stamps."
"We play intercollegiate; You
know—Michigan, Ohio State."
"Call us Poker 201—'Graduate
Money Management'."
Cards were shuffled, but the
game was stalled once again in an
action that can only be compared
to the deliberation of the House
Rules Committee before a bill is
allowed on the Floor.
"How should we handle
betting tonight? I want to get rid
of the high/low split."
"Do that on your own deal.
Otherwise it stays."
"Hey—we should make a rule
that new players must have a
sponsor—someone who can cover
their debts."

"Yeah—we got to protect
ourselves."
Debt of Honor
Is there any trouble recovering
debts? No, for the creed always
followed is, "a poker debt is a
debt of honor." And one player is
quick to set the public relations
atmosphere: "Anyway, we're all
lovable and warmhearted."
At last the game gets
underway, and the dialogue, filled
with terms of the trade, is not
heavy, but certainly colorful:
"Seven card stud, high
low .. . eight bets ...50 . .. hold
.. . You in there? ... call ... I
bet .. . pair threes ... check .. .
call, up a quarter ... I don't
believe you ... pair of aces .. .
oooh . . . your bet ... ahh! ...
Shaddup . . . you want advice? . ..
no- I think you're a loser . . . call
... OK . .. Damn! .. . You gave it
to yourself."

This process continues for
yours (9 pm to 5 am), and often
by morning one player, very
lucky, or very good, or both,
manages to accumulate $100. At
the other end of the scale,
someone inevitably loses $80.
Players come and go, late night
studyers take a break to watch the
action, but the cigarette smoke
curls incessantly upward and the
chips keep on clinking.
Fot the ten or so regulars who
gather one night each week, these
poker games provide recreation
and a source of extra income:
"I use the money for fun, not
books—dope, girls, beer."
"1 let the cash pile up in my
room."
"I won $100 last week, then
went to Reno and lost it."
Thus, for at least one player,
what started as a sport has
become a way of life.

"Tell them we give green
stamps."
"We play intercollegiate; You
know—Michigan, Ohio State."
"Call us Poker 201—'Graduate
Money Management'."
Cards were shuffled, but the
game was stalled once again in an
action that can only be compared
to the deliberation of the House
Rules Committee before a bill is
allowed on the Floor.
"How should we handle
betting tonight? I want to get rid
of the high/low split."
"Do that on your own deal.
Otherwise it stays."
"Hey—we should make a rule
that new players must have a
sponsor—someone who can cover
their debts."

"Yeah—we got to protect
ourselves."
Debt of Honor
Is there any trouble recovering
debts? No, for the creed always
followed is, "a poker debt is a
debt of honor." And one player is
quick to set the public relations
atmosphere: "Anyway, we're all
lovable and warmhearted."
At last the game gets
underway, and the dialogue, filled
with terms of the trade, is not
heavy, but certainly colorful:
"Seven card stud, high
low .. . eight bets ...50 . .. hold
.. . You in there? ... call ... I
bet .. . pair threes ... check .. .
call, up a quarter ... I don't
believe you ... pair of aces .. .
oooh . . . your bet ... ahh! ...
Shaddup . . . you want advice? . ..
no- I think you're a loser . . . call
... OK . .. Damn! .. . You gave it
to yourself."

This process continues for
yours (9 pm to 5 am), and often
by morning one player, very
lucky, or very good, or both,
manages to accumulate $100. At
the other end of the scale,
someone inevitably loses $80.
Players come and go, late night
studyers take a break to watch the
action, but the cigarette smoke
curls incessantly upward and the
chips keep on clinking.
Fot the ten or so regulars who
gather one night each week, these
poker games provide recreation
and a source of extra income:
"I use the money for fun, not
books—dope, girls, beer."
"1 let the cash pile up in my
room."
"I won $100 last week, then
went to Reno and lost it."
Thus, for at least one player,
what started as a sport has
become a way of life.

WANT TO SEE MY HAND?-~These poker players aren't about to show anyone their hands In fact,
they're not even revealing their poker faces. But those chips, silver dollars, and bills on the table amount
to a pretty fortune (the number reaches 3 figures), so secrecy is the watchword.
With the demise of the football
season last quarter, and that of
baseball not yet upon the fans'
minds, the news scene focuses on
an old yet seldom advertised
campus sport: high stakes poker.
Sure, everyone has played
penny ante in their dorms and
fraternities. That pasttime is as
common as hamburger on the
Food Service menu.
But high stakes poker is
another story. It takes a different
breed of player and operates
under the weight of some fear.
Not fear of being busted, but
of being robbed, and that fear is
justified, for in any one night's
session, an average of $350 can
see its way to the table top.
To protect themselves, players
handle most of the evening's bets
in chips, and all bets are paid by
1.0. U. or check.
Still, a stack of silver dollars, a
fist full of greenbacks, and piles of
chips representing 25c, 50c, and
$1, belie the fact that $40 a night
changes hands per player.
The players concede that
although games are basically low
key, there are moments of
tension. In the words of one,
"When you stand to lose ten
bucks with a single move, there's
pressure on you."
The tensest moment of the
evening at a recent campus game
came at the game's very start
when the players had to adjust to

the fact that the Daily was
watching their moves. Hassles
were quickly overcome and a light
atmosphere took hold:
"Tell them we give green
stamps."
"We play intercollegiate; You
know—Michigan, Ohio State."
"Call us Poker 201—'Graduate
Money Management'."
