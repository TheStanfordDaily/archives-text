There remains, however, one final matter for our determination, an
eligibility standard for part-time employees There are some 2,000
part-time employees employed by the University whose hours and
compensation cover a broad range. Various eligibility standards were
proposed by the different parties in an attempt to define and establish
what would constitute regular part-time employment. The University's
practice is to treat as regular part-time employees those employees who work
at least 20 hours per week, and such individuals are covered under the estab
lished wage and benefit programs in effect at the University. Accordingly, in
the absence of any other clearly defined and uniform system of classifying
part-time employees, we find that regular part-time employees eligible to
vote in the election are those individuals, including students, who work at
least 20 hours per week and are covered under the University's regular
wage and benefit programs.

Stanford University Hospital is a separate employer not directly
connected with the University, and, therefore, we find that Stanford
University Hospital is not a party to this proceeding.

In order to assure that all eligible voters may have the opportunity to be
informed of the issues in the exercise of their statutory right to vote, all
parties to the elections should have access to lists of voters and their
addresses which may be used to communicate with them. Excelsior

U.S. 759. Accordingly, it is hereby directed that election eligibility lists,
containing the names and addresses of all the eligible voters, must be
filed by the Employer with the Regional Director for Region 20 within
7 days of the date of this Decision, Order, and Direction of Elections.
The Regional Director shall make the lists available to all parties to the
"lections. No extension of time to file these lists shall be granted by the
Regional Director except in extraordinary circumstances. Failure to
comply with this requirement shall be grounds for setting aside the
elections whenever proper objections are filed.
29
We have placed on the ballot for the election in Unit C all labor
organizations which during the course of the hearing indicated a desire
to go to an election in such a unit. If any such labor organization wishes
to withdraw its name from the ballot, it may do so by notifying the
Regional Director, in writing, within 10 days from the date of this
Decision, Order, and Direction of Elections.
