# Text of President's Statement on NLRB Ruling
## 
### 
To the Stanford Community:
I am pleased that the NLRB has found that the non-cierical,
non-exempt Stanford staff shares a community of interest. The
police officers are, of course, required by statute to be re
presented in a unit separate from other employees. We also have
been aware that NLRB precedents would make it difficult for the
Board to include Stanford's clerical employees and firemen in a
unit with their fellow staff members. I had hoped that the Board
would have recognized the strong community of interest shared
by all the staff and at least have permitted the clericals and
firemen to decide for themselves whether they wanted to be
included with the rest of the staff; it didn't, and I regret it; but
we shall, of course, abide by its decision.
The decision does not mean that the clerical staff is to be
deprived of a choice on the important issue of collective bar
gaining representation. It just means that it will not be heard this
time around.
The next few weeks will doubtless be filled with active cam
paigning, 1 hope the campaign will serve to clarify, rather than to
obscure, the many competing considerations relevant to making
an informed choice in the election. The choice you make, as I'm
sure you are all aware, can have a substantial and far-reaching
impact upon the nature of employee relations at Stanford in the
years to come. Because of the importance of the decision for each
of you, I am sure you will all wish to consider carefully the
advantages and disadvantages of electing one course of action
rather than another before making your choice.
If the election campaign is to accomplish this highly construc
tive objective, an atmosphere of free inquiry and open discussion
concerning bargaining representation must prevail throughout the
pre-election period. 1 urge each of you to do all you can to
maintain such an atmosphere and to insure that no individual or
group is discouraged from expressing its point of view. All can
benefit from a mutual exchange of views dispassionately ex
pressed.
In my view, each of you, if you are to exercise a truly free
choice, should know the facts necessary to make an informed
choice. I urge you to scrutinize closely whatever claims and
assertions are made in the ensuing weeks and to ask questions to
determine the factual basis for each.
The University for its part has attempted over the years to
provide all employees with detailed knowledge of its benefits and
employment programs as they have been developed and institu
ted. If any of you should have questions about your existing
benefits at Stanford or the election itself, I urge you to ask your
supervisor or to call or write the Personnel Office to obtain the

answer. Direct your inquiries to lan Jacobsen, Manager of Special
Projects and Information Services, extension 4089, Encina Hall,
Room 173. He will see that you receive a prompt reply and will
prepare for general distribution written replies to recurring ques
tions which appear to be of widespread concern. You should also
feel free to contact directly the NLRB (556-4493) about any
questions you have concerning the election procedures.
Such open questioning and discussion should, I believe, assist
each of you in assessing the many conflicting considerations
which must be resolved in making your choice.
1 personally can see advantages and disadvantages to the staff
and Stanford as a whole, whichever way this comes out. Repre
sentation should permit the staff to speak with an amplified
voice. Concerted action may increase leverage. At the same time,
individual voices are bound, to some extent, to be drowned out.
Whatever strength there is in joint action tends to limit individual
action. In some ways I expect it would make administration
easier, but only at the expense of diminishing greatly both the
need for and the possibility of personal, individual employee
relations. As an institution, we have become steadily more bu
reaucratized over the years. If we move to adopt collective
bargaining, we shall be choosing to take another significant step
in that direction. However, if any of the units picked by the
Board selects collective bargaining representation, the administra
tion confidently expects to work out a relationship with the labor
organization(s) chosen which will achieve the objective of per
mitting Stanford to perform its function as a University of
distinction.
The key point to keep in mind is that union representation
certainly would work fundamental changes in existing relation
ships here at Stanford-whether over all for better or for worse,
neither I nor anyone else can say with certainty. In any event, the
choice is yours to make, not mine. I have only two requests to
make of each of you. First, I urge you to attempt to inform
yourself concerning the issues and to assess carefully all relevant
considerations before determining your choice. Second, I urge
each and every one of you who is eligible to vote to cast your
ballot on election day. The issue will be decided by a majority of
those voting in each unit so that your point of view will be
represented only if you vote.
We are all fortunate to have procedures available which permit
these important issues to be resolved by secret ballot. Let's be
sure the results express the will of the majority of (///employees
in each unit.
Richard W. Lyman
President
