# Recession Effects Slight
## Graduates Find Jobs Waiting At Last 
### JON GRAY 
"This past verj Stanford has the
best placement yeair it's ever had,"
states the director >f Stanford's Career
Planning and Placement Center. Dr.
Ralph W. Keller.
"I'm not saying that Stanford
students got more offers," continues
Dr. Keller. "On the contrary, they had
fewer offers than in the past." But
they still got offers, while many
students from other universities were
not so fortunate.
Recent national surveys of
employers forecast a 5 to 11 percent
rise in hiring for all categories of
university and college graduates in
1972.
Today's graduates leave college
with poorer chances of landing a job
than at any time since the 1930's.
According to the College Placement
Council, last year's job placement level
for BAs was down 51 percent from the

previous year, MAs were down only 2
percent (due to the demand for
MBA's) and Ph.D.s down 59 percent.
Women
The large number of married
women who have entered the labor
force also has contributed to the
shortage. Between 1969 and 1970 the
number rose by 780,000 while the
number of unemployed men increased
by 360,000.
By comparison, Stanford produces
rather few graduates. "If we start
turning out 2000 teachers a year like
Long Beach State , we're going to have
trouble," says Dr. Keller. "But if we're
going to turn out only 102 teachers,
especially if they're selected on the
basis that they're being selected, we're
not going to have a problem."
Of the original 102 completing the
Stanford Teacher Education Program
in 1971, 70 were placed in regular
classroom positions, four are still

seeking employment, and the rest have
taken other jobs. This number of
placements in the classroom is
approximately 10 percent higher than
the national average during a tight job
situation.
"A school superintendent," says
Keller, "will call and say, 'We've got
just about all the state college people
and the state university people we
want. We'd like to sprinkle in a few
Stanford people."
MBA's Popular
Recent surveys of employers still
show a large demand for accountants
and MBAs. In fact, the MBAs as a
group at Stanford received more job
offers last year than the year before.
Most students appeared satisfied with
their career options, the Center
reported.
Stanford's new Ph.D.s fared much
better than the national average. The
students who had problems wen 1 those
who hadn't finished their dissertations.
Job prospects this year are best for
women graduates who wish to join
large corporations. "They're being
considered by organizations which
previously considered only men,"
states Keller. He cited Wells Fargo and
Bank of America as two banks which
an 1 shucking the "men only" policy
when interviewing for new officers. A
recent Time magazine article suggested
employment of women graduates may
be up as much as 15 percent this year.
Large corporations and companies

are doing less campus recruiting this
year. "There was a time when we had
over 500 organizations represented on
campus. It's down to around 200
now," says Keller. Most of the
companies which have stopped visiting
campus are from the East. Stanford
graduates have never flocked there in
great numbers for jobs, and now, with
a 12.8 percent rise in the permanent
labor force and job hiring off 25
percent from 1970, those companies
are easily finding qualified graduates
close to home.
Suzanne R. Close, Placement
Director of the Law School, says
approximately two-thirds of that
program's graduates find jobs in law.
Stanford law students fare well
compared to the rest of the nation's
graduates. "The big problem is that
they want to stay here in the area."
She sees slightly more Law hiring
this year except in the Federal
government. "There it's going to be
tight."
Survey
A survey by the Office of
Undergraduate Studies indicated about
90 percent of the graduating seniors
intended doing graduate work.
Surprisingly though, 50 percent said
they would take off at least a year
before starting. Some plan to travel —
some to work.
In response to this, the Placement
Center expanded its efforts in the area
of vocations for social change.

percent from 1970, those companies
are easily finding qualified graduates
close to home.
Suzanne R. Close, Placement
Director of the Law School, says
approximately two-thirds of that
program's graduates find jobs in law.
Stanford law students fare well
compared to the rest of the nation's
graduates. "The big problem is that
they want to stay here in the area."
She sees slightly more Law hiring
this year except in the Federal
government. "There it's going to be
tight."
Survey
A survey by the Office of
Undergraduate Studies indicated about
90 percent of the graduating seniors
intended doing graduate work.
Surprisingly though, 50 percent said
they would take off at least a year
before starting. Some plan to travel —
some to work.
In response to this, the Placement
Center expanded its efforts in the area
of vocations for social change.

were asked to leave the building after interrupting recruiting by Hewlett-Packard representatives.
"This past verj Stanford has the
best placement yeair it's ever had,"
states the director >f Stanford's Career
Planning and Placement Center. Dr.
Ralph W. Keller.
"I'm not saying that Stanford
students got more offers," continues
Dr. Keller. "On the contrary, they had
fewer offers than in the past." But
they still got offers, while many
students from other universities were
not so fortunate.
Recent national surveys of
employers forecast a 5 to 11 percent
rise in hiring for all categories of
university and college graduates in
1972.
Today's graduates leave college
with poorer chances of landing a job
than at any time since the 1930's.
According to the College Placement
Council, last year's job placement level
for BAs was down 51 percent from the

previous year, MAs were down only 2
percent (due to the demand for
MBA's) and Ph.D.s down 59 percent.
Women
The large number of married
women who have entered the labor
force also has contributed to the
shortage. Between 1969 and 1970 the
number rose by 780,000 while the
number of unemployed men increased
by 360,000.
By comparison, Stanford produces
rather few graduates. "If we start
turning out 2000 teachers a year like
Long Beach State , we're going to have
trouble," says Dr. Keller. "But if we're
going to turn out only 102 teachers,
especially if they're selected on the
basis that they're being selected, we're
not going to have a problem."
Of the original 102 completing the
Stanford Teacher Education Program
in 1971, 70 were placed in regular
classroom positions, four are still

seeking employment, and the rest have
taken other jobs. This number of
placements in the classroom is
approximately 10 percent higher than
the national average during a tight job
situation.
"A school superintendent," says
Keller, "will call and say, 'We've got
just about all the state college people
and the state university people we
want. We'd like to sprinkle in a few
Stanford people."
MBA's Popular
Recent surveys of employers still
show a large demand for accountants
and MBAs. In fact, the MBAs as a
group at Stanford received more job
offers last year than the year before.
Most students appeared satisfied with
their career options, the Center
reported.
Stanford's new Ph.D.s fared much
better than the national average. The
students who had problems wen 1 those
who hadn't finished their dissertations.
Job prospects this year are best for
women graduates who wish to join
large corporations. "They're being
considered by organizations which
previously considered only men,"
states Keller. He cited Wells Fargo and
Bank of America as two banks which
an 1 shucking the "men only" policy
when interviewing for new officers. A
recent Time magazine article suggested
employment of women graduates may
be up as much as 15 percent this year.
Large corporations and companies

are doing less campus recruiting this
year. "There was a time when we had
over 500 organizations represented on
campus. It's down to around 200
now," says Keller. Most of the
companies which have stopped visiting
campus are from the East. Stanford
graduates have never flocked there in
great numbers for jobs, and now, with
a 12.8 percent rise in the permanent
labor force and job hiring off 25
percent from 1970, those companies
are easily finding qualified graduates
close to home.

their career options, the Center
reported.
Stanford's new Ph.D.s fared much
better than the national average. The
students who had problems wen 1 those
who hadn't finished their dissertations.
Job prospects this year are best for
women graduates who wish to join
large corporations. "They're being
considered by organizations which
previously considered only men,"
states Keller. He cited Wells Fargo and
Bank of America as two banks which
an 1 shucking the "men only" policy
when interviewing for new officers. A
recent Time magazine article suggested
employment of women graduates may
be up as much as 15 percent this year.
Large corporations and companies

are doing less campus recruiting this
year. "There was a time when we had
over 500 organizations represented on
campus. It's down to around 200
now," says Keller. Most of the
companies which have stopped visiting
campus are from the East. Stanford
graduates have never flocked there in
great numbers for jobs, and now, with
a 12.8 percent rise in the permanent
labor force and job hiring off 25
percent from 1970, those companies
are easily finding qualified graduates
close to home.
Suzanne R. Close, Placement
Director of the Law School, says
approximately two-thirds of that
program's graduates find jobs in law.
Stanford law students fare well
compared to the rest of the nation's
graduates. "The big problem is that
they want to stay here in the area."
She sees slightly more Law hiring
this year except in the Federal
government. "There it's going to be
tight."
Survey
A survey by the Office of
Undergraduate Studies indicated about
90 percent of the graduating seniors
intended doing graduate work.
Surprisingly though, 50 percent said
they would take off at least a year
before starting. Some plan to travel —
some to work.
In response to this, the Placement
Center expanded its efforts in the area
of vocations for social change.
