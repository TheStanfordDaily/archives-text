# Free Brew Not So Free, You Paid Four Years Ago
## 
### KATHY WEINBERGER 
"FREE BEER" read the ad in big bold type. But
few of the 150 seniors who noticed the ad and
turned up at the Rat's for the latest Senior Happy
Hour realized they had actually paid for their
refreshment long before.
During pre-registration week four years ago,
when this year's senior class first set foot on
campus, all 1400 freshmen were hit with a pile of
bills to pay. Sandwiched between the room and
board bill and pre-reg expenses was "Dean's Fee,"
$2 of which was to go towards senior year activities.
The money from the fee — charged annually to
each incoming class — disappears into the University
general fund for three years, only to surface again,
most notably in the form of "free" beer for less
than two percent of the class.
The "Happy Hour" crowd from last year's senior
class guzzled approximately $630 worth of beer.
According to Cece Mcßoskey, the senior class
president responsible for planning social functions,
this year's class will spend less.
'Maybe'
"Although it is usually very crowded, I think
there should be another form of senior 'Happy
Hour' if it is continued at all," commented
Mcßoskey. "It attracts a small group of
people .. . Maybe seniors don't like beer drinking.
Maybe another activity to bring seniors together
would be good. But it's hard to think of other
things that are financially feasible. Maybe the
money could be used to put out a publication or
something that would bring seniors together. But
maybe we're just too big," she added.
The senior presidents hope to send a
questionnaire to their constituents later this quarter
to determine their interests, both for activities this
year and for reunions after they graduate.
The presidents agree that the "Happy Hours"
should be continued, at least for now. Like
Mcßoskey, Allen Meredith, the class president who
serves as treasurer, sees the "Happy Hours" as an
opportunity to bring the class together. "I have
only been to one, but I enjoyed it,"he said. "The
money is there to use, and 'Happy Hours' seem to
be a good chance to meet other people in your own
class. It's sad that there are not many other
opportunities to get together — a little more class
unity would be useful," he explained.
Jack Stevens, the president responsible for
relations with alumni and faculty, disagreed with
Meredith. "I think the concept of class unity is
archaic," he argued. He sees the "Happy Hours" as a
chance for people to socialize, but he hasn't
attended any. "I'm not so certain they're a relevant
function," he commented.
The feelings of the people who attended the last
"Happy Hour" were varied. Many agreed with one
husky male who exclaimed, "It's a great place to see
people you never see otherwise. It's good to see the
Rat's crowded because Souza (the owner) is a good
man." Holding up his nearly empty glass of beer, he
sighed, "And it's good to have beer."
'Rip-Off'
Others were more critical. "I think it's a rip-off
because most people don't know about it and we
certainly don't know about it when we pay as
freshmen," complained one female. "It's just a
bunch of obnoxiously drunk football players,"
mumbled someone from the sidelines of activity.
One cynical senior looked around awhile and
muttered, "This makes me feel like I should become
a life insurance agent and sell policies to my
classmates."

"Where are the naked women?" asked one
bewildered senior male, looking around the crowded
parlor of beer drinkers.
There were no naked women. In fact, there were
few women of any kind. "Happy Hour" newcomers
were immediately struck by the make-up of the
group — predominantly white, male, and somewhat
drunk.
Those who arrived 40 minutes after the "Happy
Hour" started were disappointed to find that all the
free beer that they had been hearing about and
anticipating was gone. The senior council had
ordered 50 pitchers and after those were consumed
people were on their own. "The free beer is like an
incentive to get people there to be with other
seniors — not to give free beer to everybody,"
admitted Mcßoskey. "Souza gives us a discount in
price and usually adds some extra pitchers at his
expense," she added.
But "Happy Hours" are not all that senior class
funds traditionally pay for. They also cover
graduation expenses, including letters to parents and
students informing them of ceremony procedures, a
class gift, future reunions, and a gold inlaid plaque
with the year of graduation engraved that is placed
in the inner Quad near Memorial Church. Under the
plaque a "time capsule" is buried, containing
momentos of the year.
Mementos
According to Meredith, this year's time capsule
will contain such items as a list of names of the
graduating seniors, pictures from the Rose Bowl
game and all the back issues of the Observer. "I
didn't know until recently about this time capsule,"
explained Meredith. "It seems rather useless to bury
a little bit of information and store it until some
anthropologists some day decide to get interested in
excavating. It's like burying a person — rather
morbid in a sense, but it's tradition.
"Since it has been a tradition I assumed it would
be done again. As a matter of fact, the plaque has
already been purchased. Plaques were ordered in
1970 for the next three classes, and they started
drawing from our account at that time. By the time
our class leaders came into office, the plaque was
paid for. I assume they got a discount by ordering
them in advance," he commented.
The senior class pays half the cost of the plaque;
the President's office pays for the other half. The
total cost for this year's will be about $630.
Donald Carlson, Associate Director of University
Relations, explained why his office ordered the
plaques two years ago. "We have to order them way
in advance so they can be made and delivered in
time. The price keeps going up — they cost about 15
times as much now as they did when the idea
originated and they could be made on campus. We
save money by ordering several at a time." He
added, "The plaques are meaningful and people can
argue it if they want and try to change it, but
alumni appreciate having the tradition continued.
Students may not appreciate it now, but they will
when they're alumni. They want to leave a mark at
the University."
For the past 10 years, extra money left over after
happy hours, plaques, and other expenses have been
donated as scholarship funds by the different
classes. Previous to the establishment of
scholarships, class gifts ranged from the Main
Library fountain, given to the University by one
graduating group, to the benches surrounding the
old oak tree at the Graduate School of Business,
given by another.

THAT MAKES US WANT TO CHEER—Four years ago, these avid beer guzzlers and 1400 of their
classmates unknowingly bought themselves the suds they now enjoy. The 1250 seniors who did not come
to this particular "Happy Hour" also helped pick up the tab by paying a $2 senior activity fee when they
were freshmen.
