# Annexation Poll Refused
## 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council
Monday night refused to
commission a poll of Stanford
faculty who live on campus
regarding their views on
annexation to Palo Alto, The vote
was 4-3.
The question was raised when
Stanford petitioned for
annexation of the Peter Coutts
Hill site where low-income
housing will soon be h It.
Councilman Richard Rosenbaum

suggested that the council's study
of the issue be extended to the
faculty housing.
The Council referred the issue
to its Finance Committee which
plans to give it "low priority,"
according to Councilman William
Clark.
The question of annexation
was discussed in last Thursday's
Daily as part of a series of articles
on Stanford land use.
