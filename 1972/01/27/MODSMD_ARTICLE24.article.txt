# Stanford Axes Golf Course Plans
## 
### 
Stanford has abandoned plans
to build a golf course along Deer
Creek beside Coyote Hill.
University Vice-President for
Business and Finance Robert R.
Augsburger asked the Palo Alto
City Planning Commission to
remove the item from its agenda
and also asked for an 8-12 month
delay before the city again
considered the issue so the
University could make "further
planning and financial studies."
Augsburger said there are other
possible uses being considered for
the site, which is located in the
foothills above the Stanford

Industrial Park. He also noted that
the intended developer of the golf
course was abandoning the project
because of delays occasioned by
debate over alternative uses of the
land in the area.
Issues involved in the Coyote
Hill development were discussed
in last Friday's Daily as part of a
series of articles on Stanford land
development policies.
