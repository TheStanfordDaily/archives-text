# A 						Performing Hitchhiker Comes To Stanford
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Between classes this week at
the Engineering Corner, there
have been large groups of people
crowding around a mysterious
table and no thev are not fighting
over copies of the Daily, as we
might hope. The attraction has
been a simple magic show being
performed by one Avadon-Black.
Each morning Avadon has
brought his cards and walnut
shells to the Engineering Corner
and proceeded to baffle people
with his magic stunts. Most people
are probably already familiar with
the pea-under-the-walnut-shell
game, in which you put an object
under one of a number of shells,
move them around and have the
observors try to follow the one
with the object underneath it.
Avadon uses a small piece of
yellow foam rubber and three

shells and everytime you're
certain you can follow the lucky
shell, but you never can. Even
when Avadon lets an observer
leave his finger on the original
shell with the object, while he
moves them around, he always
succeeds in making the object
appear under another shell after
only five or six slow-paced moves.
And so no one ever wins Hoover
Tower, which he offers to any
victorious participant.
Avadon is a former UCLA
drama student who quit school
after two years in 1969 and
decided to hitchhike around the
country performing a show of
improvisations and sketches of life
on the road. Why did he leave the
security of a school with a good
drama department to try the
unknown?
"I wanted to build a theater

experience which would transcend
a lot of limits existing in theater.
A lot of theater is for an elitist
audience, but most beautiful
things are not and there are ways
to share those things with
everybody. I am basically
concerned with the things which
would be most beautiful and
universal in theater."
So in April 1969, Avadon
decided to hit the road and work
on implementing his theatrical
theories. "Before going to UCLA,
I wanted very much to be able to
travel and perform and create a
performance that would share the
tremendous potential in live
theater ... I thought the idea was
pretty crazy for awhile and I
thought I'd get talked out of it,
but I didn't. So I got a duffle bag
and headed for Arizona. I had no
show and very little idea of what
to do. AH I really knew was that I
would travel to universities.
Universities are the easiest place
to begin because being such tight
communities, it is easy to get to
the people."
Avadon's first stop was
Arizona State University. He went
to the head of the theater
department and described a
non-existent show which he said
he had developed hitchiking. He
got permission to perform and he
ended up doing a one man theater
piece based on a Henry Miller
work, "Smile at the Foot of a
Ladder."
But as he continued to
hitchhike, Avadon built his show
around experiences that
happened on the road. "I don't
try to reinforce any pre-conceived
notions. My show deals mostly
with the crises all of us have to
experience. It isn't especially
about far-fetched people. I share
with my audience the crises of
violence, life style and sexuality.
But by seeing these things from a
new perspective, the audience
may be given a heightened
perception into some of the crises
we all face."
Surprisingly, Avadon says he
has never been seriously harassed
during his more than 30,000 miles
of hitchhiking. "Most of the
danger has been in my
imagination. Once in Arkansas I
came to the conclusion that some
people who had given me a ride in
a pick-up truck were going to kill
me. But they ended up taking me
to their home and offering me
dinner. Everything has worked
out pretty well.
"Most of the people I get rides
from are from a very different
background than my parents. A
lot are truckdrivers and workmen.

Also drunks. Invariably, drunks
love to pick up hitchhikers. Some
of my rides with drunks have been
pretty scary as have some with
hillbillies who hadn't learned to
drive too well."
Avadon claims he's only gotten
one hitchhiking citation since he
began travelling, but last year, the
law almost forced a more
long-term change in his theatrical
plans. "In February 1971, I
refused induction into the Army.
When I left UCLA, I was 1-A and
I knew I'd have a draft problem. 1
already had some pretty strong
feelings against the draft, but my
contact with people on the road
convinced me that I couldn't
cooperate with the draft.
Especially influential was a soldier
with a face disfigured from
shrapnel who the Army wouldn't
give plastic surgery to."
After refusing induction,
Avadon came to trial in July and
was found guilty in the customary
10-15 minutes. He was sent to
Lompoc Federal Prison, north of
Santa Barbara for 90 days
observation, prior to final
sentencing. While at Lompoc,
Avadon started a theater troupe
and acting class.
15 persons were in his acting
class and he and two other
prisoners even performed a play
about prison life, "Keep Tightly
Closed in A Cool Dry Place," by
Megan Terry. Avadon said the
three of them were quite
apprehensive about what the
reactions of the other prisoners in
the audience would be, but he
claimed that "they dug the whole
play. They were cracking up
about prisoners doing a play
about prisoners bitching about
being prisoners."
After his 90 day stay, Avadon
was put on probation with the
stipulation that he perform
alternate service for three years.
During his travels, he had often
performed a children's show at
hospitals, orphanages and schools
and his probation officer
approved his idea of continuing
this to fulfill his alternate service
requirement.
"I did these children's shows
long before the alternate service
thing came up. They were a way
of becoming involved in the
community. These shows got me
into places I'd never otherwise get
to see. I do magic and tell stories,
but the kids actually do 90% of
the show." While at Stanford the
last two weeks, "Avadon has
performed at a number of schools,
primarily in East Palo Alto and
also at child care centers and
schools for the deaf.

Although he feels he would
still refuse induction, Avadon now
says he would do anything with
the exception of going into the
Army to avoid the tremendous
waste of prison. He says the
prison experience affected him
"tremendously" and that it is
reflected in the shows he has done
since his release.
"I lived with guys who were
nearly incapable of sustaining
themselves on the streets and with
prison personnel who conceived
of draft resisters as dangerous
criminals. Mostly it was being
there, knowing what I was capable
of doing, and seeing this
tremendous morass, almost like a
whirlpool of guys who could
never escape from prison or even
if they get out, who could never
escape from the tremendous
futility that most of them felt.
"My prison experiences gave
me such a tremendous drive and
ambition to go back and make my
performing succeed and succeed
even more phenomenally. What
developed in me was an ambition
and a drive which I can't even
begin to articulate. All my
thoughts went into how I could
do things ten times better.
"The difficulty in making my
work succeed is phenomenal. It's
so unconventional—you have to
learn everything for yourself. The
rewards are tremendous, but it is
very, very difficult to do this
week after week. I spend most of
my time dreaming up ideas and
improvements."
Avadon plans to continue to
travel and perform at least
through the remainder of this

year. His immediate plans will
take him into the Northwest and
this summer he will go to Alaska.
Then he says he will probably
return to Los Angeles and work
on organizing a larger travelling
troupe.
"I'd like to bring together a
very small theater group, maybe
six people at the most, which
would travel and perform in the
United States. We'd try to do the
same kind of theater I'm doing
now, only for more people. We'd
do it in cities and not so much in
universities. This would be a way
to utilize our talents for people in
communities. With a group like
this, we could perform in old
people's homes, prisons. .. .
"After that I'd like to develop
a theater school which would be a
permanent place for our troupe to
perform and to teach in. We'd
teach an alternative that isn't
necessarily limited to me or to a
few people. It could successfully
be accomplished in many cities,
generated from within. I travel
because I love it and not because
it is necessary for the kind of
theater I do.

"Maybe a theater troupe
should involve itself very much in
the community on a permanent
basis. They should be developing
shows which relate to things
happening in the community. So
the troupe could grow, mature
and change with the community.
People could respond with goods
or services from the community."
People never have to pay
admission for Avadon's shows,
but he does accept donations.
"Like performing outside,
donations are aesthetically a very
important part of the
performance so the audience can
respond in a personal way. Some
people respond with baked goods,
books, dinner invitations,
drawings. . . . People can respond
in a more personal and creative
way to what they see. Donations
encourage a more creative way. It
is very important that theater be
open to everyone who wants to
see it."
Avadon-Black will perform
tonight and tomorrow night at 8
p.m. in the Annenberg
Auditorium of the Cummings Art
Building.

Between classes this week at
the Engineering Corner, there
have been large groups of people
crowding around a mysterious
table and no thev are not fighting
over copies of the Daily, as we
might hope. The attraction has
been a simple magic show being
performed by one Avadon-Black.
Each morning Avadon has
brought his cards and walnut
shells to the Engineering Corner
and proceeded to baffle people
with his magic stunts. Most people
are probably already familiar with
the pea-under-the-walnut-shell
game, in which you put an object
under one of a number of shells,
move them around and have the
observors try to follow the one
with the object underneath it.
Avadon uses a small piece of
yellow foam rubber and three

shells and everytime you're
certain you can follow the lucky
shell, but you never can. Even
when Avadon lets an observer
leave his finger on the original
shell with the object, while he
moves them around, he always
succeeds in making the object
appear under another shell after
only five or six slow-paced moves.
And so no one ever wins Hoover
Tower, which he offers to any
victorious participant.
Avadon is a former UCLA
drama student who quit school
after two years in 1969 and
decided to hitchhike around the
country performing a show of
improvisations and sketches of life
on the road. Why did he leave the
security of a school with a good
drama department to try the
unknown?
"I wanted to build a theater

experience which would transcend
a lot of limits existing in theater.
A lot of theater is for an elitist
audience, but most beautiful
things are not and there are ways
to share those things with
everybody. I am basically
concerned with the things which
would be most beautiful and
universal in theater."
So in April 1969, Avadon
decided to hit the road and work
on implementing his theatrical
theories. "Before going to UCLA,
I wanted very much to be able to
travel and perform and create a
performance that would share the
tremendous potential in live
theater ... I thought the idea was
pretty crazy for awhile and I
thought I'd get talked out of it,
but I didn't. So I got a duffle bag
and headed for Arizona. I had no
show and very little idea of what
to do. AH I really knew was that I
would travel to universities.
Universities are the easiest place
to begin because being such tight
communities, it is easy to get to
the people."
Avadon's first stop was
Arizona State University. He went
to the head of the theater
department and described a
non-existent show which he said
he had developed hitchiking. He
got permission to perform and he
ended up doing a one man theater
piece based on a Henry Miller
work, "Smile at the Foot of a
Ladder."
But as he continued to
hitchhike, Avadon built his show
around experiences that
happened on the road. "I don't
try to reinforce any pre-conceived
notions. My show deals mostly
with the crises all of us have to
experience. It isn't especially
about far-fetched people. I share
with my audience the crises of
violence, life style and sexuality.
But by seeing these things from a
new perspective, the audience
may be given a heightened
perception into some of the crises
we all face."
Surprisingly, Avadon says he
has never been seriously harassed
during his more than 30,000 miles
of hitchhiking. "Most of the
danger has been in my
imagination. Once in Arkansas I
came to the conclusion that some
people who had given me a ride in
a pick-up truck were going to kill
me. But they ended up taking me
to their home and offering me
dinner. Everything has worked
out pretty well.
"Most of the people I get rides
from are from a very different
background than my parents. A
lot are truckdrivers and workmen.

Also drunks. Invariably, drunks
love to pick up hitchhikers. Some
of my rides with drunks have been
pretty scary as have some with
hillbillies who hadn't learned to
drive too well."
Avadon claims he's only gotten
one hitchhiking citation since he
began travelling, but last year, the
law almost forced a more
long-term change in his theatrical
plans. "In February 1971, I
refused induction into the Army.
When I left UCLA, I was 1-A and
I knew I'd have a draft problem. 1
already had some pretty strong
feelings against the draft, but my
contact with people on the road
convinced me that I couldn't
cooperate with the draft.
Especially influential was a soldier
with a face disfigured from
shrapnel who the Army wouldn't
give plastic surgery to."
After refusing induction,
Avadon came to trial in July and
was found guilty in the customary
10-15 minutes. He was sent to
Lompoc Federal Prison, north of
Santa Barbara for 90 days
observation, prior to final
sentencing. While at Lompoc,
Avadon started a theater troupe
and acting class.
15 persons were in his acting
class and he and two other
prisoners even performed a play
about prison life, "Keep Tightly
Closed in A Cool Dry Place," by
Megan Terry. Avadon said the
three of them were quite
apprehensive about what the
reactions of the other prisoners in
the audience would be, but he
claimed that "they dug the whole
play. They were cracking up
about prisoners doing a play
about prisoners bitching about
being prisoners."
After his 90 day stay, Avadon
was put on probation with the
stipulation that he perform
alternate service for three years.
During his travels, he had often
performed a children's show at
hospitals, orphanages and schools
and his probation officer
approved his idea of continuing
this to fulfill his alternate service
requirement.
"I did these children's shows
long before the alternate service
thing came up. They were a way
of becoming involved in the
community. These shows got me
into places I'd never otherwise get
to see. I do magic and tell stories,
but the kids actually do 90% of
the show." While at Stanford the
last two weeks, "Avadon has
performed at a number of schools,
primarily in East Palo Alto and
also at child care centers and
schools for the deaf.

Although he feels he would
still refuse induction, Avadon now
says he would do anything with
the exception of going into the
Army to avoid the tremendous
waste of prison. He says the
prison experience affected him
"tremendously" and that it is
reflected in the shows he has done
since his release.
"I lived with guys who were
nearly incapable of sustaining
themselves on the streets and with
prison personnel who conceived
of draft resisters as dangerous
criminals. Mostly it was being
there, knowing what I was capable
of doing, and seeing this
tremendous morass, almost like a
whirlpool of guys who could
never escape from prison or even
if they get out, who could never
escape from the tremendous
futility that most of them felt.
"My prison experiences gave
me such a tremendous drive and
ambition to go back and make my
performing succeed and succeed
even more phenomenally. What
developed in me was an ambition
and a drive which I can't even
begin to articulate. All my
thoughts went into how I could
do things ten times better.
"The difficulty in making my
work succeed is phenomenal. It's
so unconventional—you have to
learn everything for yourself. The
rewards are tremendous, but it is
very, very difficult to do this
week after week. I spend most of
my time dreaming up ideas and
improvements."
Avadon plans to continue to
travel and perform at least
through the remainder of this

year. His immediate plans will
take him into the Northwest and
this summer he will go to Alaska.
Then he says he will probably
return to Los Angeles and work
on organizing a larger travelling
troupe.
"I'd like to bring together a
very small theater group, maybe
six people at the most, which
would travel and perform in the
United States. We'd try to do the
same kind of theater I'm doing
now, only for more people. We'd
do it in cities and not so much in
universities. This would be a way
to utilize our talents for people in
communities. With a group like
this, we could perform in old
people's homes, prisons. .. .
"After that I'd like to develop
a theater school which would be a
permanent place for our troupe to
perform and to teach in. We'd
teach an alternative that isn't
necessarily limited to me or to a
few people. It could successfully
be accomplished in many cities,
generated from within. I travel
because I love it and not because
it is necessary for the kind of
theater I do.

"Maybe a theater troupe
should involve itself very much in
the community on a permanent
basis. They should be developing
shows which relate to things
happening in the community. So
the troupe could grow, mature
and change with the community.
People could respond with goods
or services from the community."
People never have to pay
admission for Avadon's shows,
but he does accept donations.
"Like performing outside,
donations are aesthetically a very
important part of the
performance so the audience can
respond in a personal way. Some
people respond with baked goods,
books, dinner invitations,
drawings. . . . People can respond
in a more personal and creative
way to what they see. Donations
encourage a more creative way. It
is very important that theater be
open to everyone who wants to
see it."
Avadon-Black will perform
tonight and tomorrow night at 8
p.m. in the Annenberg
Auditorium of the Cummings Art
Building.

Between classes this week at
the Engineering Corner, there
have been large groups of people
crowding around a mysterious
table and no thev are not fighting
over copies of the Daily, as we
might hope. The attraction has
been a simple magic show being
performed by one Avadon-Black.
Each morning Avadon has
brought his cards and walnut
shells to the Engineering Corner
and proceeded to baffle people
with his magic stunts. Most people
are probably already familiar with
the pea-under-the-walnut-shell
game, in which you put an object
under one of a number of shells,
move them around and have the
observors try to follow the one
with the object underneath it.
Avadon uses a small piece of
yellow foam rubber and three

shells and everytime you're
certain you can follow the lucky
shell, but you never can. Even
when Avadon lets an observer
leave his finger on the original
shell with the object, while he
moves them around, he always
succeeds in making the object
appear under another shell after
only five or six slow-paced moves.
And so no one ever wins Hoover
Tower, which he offers to any
victorious participant.
Avadon is a former UCLA
drama student who quit school
after two years in 1969 and
decided to hitchhike around the
country performing a show of
improvisations and sketches of life
on the road. Why did he leave the
security of a school with a good
drama department to try the
unknown?
"I wanted to build a theater

experience which would transcend
a lot of limits existing in theater.
A lot of theater is for an elitist
audience, but most beautiful
things are not and there are ways
to share those things with
everybody. I am basically
concerned with the things which
would be most beautiful and
universal in theater."
So in April 1969, Avadon
decided to hit the road and work
on implementing his theatrical
theories. "Before going to UCLA,
I wanted very much to be able to
travel and perform and create a
performance that would share the
tremendous potential in live
theater ... I thought the idea was
pretty crazy for awhile and I
thought I'd get talked out of it,
but I didn't. So I got a duffle bag
and headed for Arizona. I had no
show and very little idea of what
to do. AH I really knew was that I
would travel to universities.
Universities are the easiest place
to begin because being such tight
communities, it is easy to get to
the people."
Avadon's first stop was
Arizona State University. He went
to the head of the theater
department and described a
non-existent show which he said
he had developed hitchiking. He
got permission to perform and he
ended up doing a one man theater
piece based on a Henry Miller
work, "Smile at the Foot of a
Ladder."
But as he continued to
hitchhike, Avadon built his show
around experiences that
happened on the road. "I don't
try to reinforce any pre-conceived
notions. My show deals mostly
with the crises all of us have to
experience. It isn't especially
about far-fetched people. I share
with my audience the crises of
violence, life style and sexuality.
But by seeing these things from a
new perspective, the audience
may be given a heightened
perception into some of the crises
we all face."
Surprisingly, Avadon says he
has never been seriously harassed
during his more than 30,000 miles
of hitchhiking. "Most of the
danger has been in my
imagination. Once in Arkansas I
came to the conclusion that some
people who had given me a ride in
a pick-up truck were going to kill
me. But they ended up taking me
to their home and offering me
dinner. Everything has worked
out pretty well.
"Most of the people I get rides
from are from a very different
background than my parents. A
lot are truckdrivers and workmen.

Also drunks. Invariably, drunks
love to pick up hitchhikers. Some
of my rides with drunks have been
pretty scary as have some with
hillbillies who hadn't learned to
drive too well."
Avadon claims he's only gotten
one hitchhiking citation since he
began travelling, but last year, the
law almost forced a more
long-term change in his theatrical
plans. "In February 1971, I
refused induction into the Army.
When I left UCLA, I was 1-A and
I knew I'd have a draft problem. 1
already had some pretty strong
feelings against the draft, but my
contact with people on the road
convinced me that I couldn't
cooperate with the draft.
Especially influential was a soldier
with a face disfigured from
shrapnel who the Army wouldn't
give plastic surgery to."
After refusing induction,
Avadon came to trial in July and
was found guilty in the customary
10-15 minutes. He was sent to
Lompoc Federal Prison, north of
Santa Barbara for 90 days
observation, prior to final
sentencing. While at Lompoc,
Avadon started a theater troupe
and acting class.
15 persons were in his acting
class and he and two other
prisoners even performed a play
about prison life, "Keep Tightly
Closed in A Cool Dry Place," by
Megan Terry. Avadon said the
three of them were quite
apprehensive about what the
reactions of the other prisoners in
the audience would be, but he
claimed that "they dug the whole
play. They were cracking up
about prisoners doing a play
about prisoners bitching about
being prisoners."
After his 90 day stay, Avadon
was put on probation with the
stipulation that he perform
alternate service for three years.
During his travels, he had often
performed a children's show at
hospitals, orphanages and schools
and his probation officer
approved his idea of continuing
this to fulfill his alternate service
requirement.
"I did these children's shows
long before the alternate service
thing came up. They were a way
of becoming involved in the
community. These shows got me
into places I'd never otherwise get
to see. I do magic and tell stories,
but the kids actually do 90% of
the show." While at Stanford the
last two weeks, "Avadon has
performed at a number of schools,
primarily in East Palo Alto and
also at child care centers and
schools for the deaf.

Although he feels he would
still refuse induction, Avadon now
says he would do anything with
the exception of going into the
Army to avoid the tremendous
waste of prison. He says the
prison experience affected him
"tremendously" and that it is
reflected in the shows he has done
since his release.
"I lived with guys who were
nearly incapable of sustaining
themselves on the streets and with
prison personnel who conceived
of draft resisters as dangerous
criminals. Mostly it was being
there, knowing what I was capable
of doing, and seeing this
tremendous morass, almost like a
whirlpool of guys who could
never escape from prison or even
if they get out, who could never
escape from the tremendous
futility that most of them felt.
"My prison experiences gave
me such a tremendous drive and
ambition to go back and make my
performing succeed and succeed
even more phenomenally. What
developed in me was an ambition
and a drive which I can't even
begin to articulate. All my
thoughts went into how I could
do things ten times better.
"The difficulty in making my
work succeed is phenomenal. It's
so unconventional—you have to
learn everything for yourself. The
rewards are tremendous, but it is
very, very difficult to do this
week after week. I spend most of
my time dreaming up ideas and
improvements."
Avadon plans to continue to
travel and perform at least
through the remainder of this

year. His immediate plans will
take him into the Northwest and
this summer he will go to Alaska.
Then he says he will probably
return to Los Angeles and work
on organizing a larger travelling
troupe.
"I'd like to bring together a
very small theater group, maybe
six people at the most, which
would travel and perform in the
United States. We'd try to do the
same kind of theater I'm doing
now, only for more people. We'd
do it in cities and not so much in
universities. This would be a way
to utilize our talents for people in
communities. With a group like
this, we could perform in old
people's homes, prisons. .. .
"After that I'd like to develop
a theater school which would be a
permanent place for our troupe to
perform and to teach in. We'd
teach an alternative that isn't
necessarily limited to me or to a
few people. It could successfully
be accomplished in many cities,
generated from within. I travel
because I love it and not because
it is necessary for the kind of
theater I do.

"Maybe a theater troupe
should involve itself very much in
the community on a permanent
basis. They should be developing
shows which relate to things
happening in the community. So
the troupe could grow, mature
and change with the community.
People could respond with goods
or services from the community."
People never have to pay
admission for Avadon's shows,
but he does accept donations.
"Like performing outside,
donations are aesthetically a very
important part of the
performance so the audience can
respond in a personal way. Some
people respond with baked goods,
books, dinner invitations,
drawings. . . . People can respond
in a more personal and creative
way to what they see. Donations
encourage a more creative way. It
is very important that theater be
open to everyone who wants to
see it."
Avadon-Black will perform
tonight and tomorrow night at 8
p.m. in the Annenberg
Auditorium of the Cummings Art
Building.

Between classes this week at
the Engineering Corner, there
have been large groups of people
crowding around a mysterious
table and no thev are not fighting
over copies of the Daily, as we
might hope. The attraction has
been a simple magic show being
performed by one Avadon-Black.
Each morning Avadon has
brought his cards and walnut
shells to the Engineering Corner
and proceeded to baffle people
with his magic stunts. Most people
are probably already familiar with
the pea-under-the-walnut-shell
game, in which you put an object
under one of a number of shells,
move them around and have the
observors try to follow the one
with the object underneath it.
Avadon uses a small piece of
yellow foam rubber and three

shells and everytime you're
certain you can follow the lucky
shell, but you never can. Even
when Avadon lets an observer
leave his finger on the original
shell with the object, while he
moves them around, he always
succeeds in making the object
appear under another shell after
only five or six slow-paced moves.
And so no one ever wins Hoover
Tower, which he offers to any
victorious participant.
Avadon is a former UCLA
drama student who quit school
after two years in 1969 and
decided to hitchhike around the
country performing a show of
improvisations and sketches of life
on the road. Why did he leave the
security of a school with a good
drama department to try the
unknown?
"I wanted to build a theater

experience which would transcend
a lot of limits existing in theater.
A lot of theater is for an elitist
audience, but most beautiful
things are not and there are ways
to share those things with
everybody. I am basically
concerned with the things which
would be most beautiful and
universal in theater."
So in April 1969, Avadon
decided to hit the road and work
on implementing his theatrical
theories. "Before going to UCLA,
I wanted very much to be able to
travel and perform and create a
performance that would share the
tremendous potential in live
theater ... I thought the idea was
pretty crazy for awhile and I
thought I'd get talked out of it,
but I didn't. So I got a duffle bag
and headed for Arizona. I had no
show and very little idea of what
to do. AH I really knew was that I
would travel to universities.
Universities are the easiest place
to begin because being such tight
communities, it is easy to get to
the people."
Avadon's first stop was
Arizona State University. He went
to the head of the theater
department and described a
non-existent show which he said
he had developed hitchiking. He
got permission to perform and he
ended up doing a one man theater
piece based on a Henry Miller
work, "Smile at the Foot of a
Ladder."
But as he continued to
hitchhike, Avadon built his show
around experiences that
happened on the road. "I don't
try to reinforce any pre-conceived
notions. My show deals mostly
with the crises all of us have to
experience. It isn't especially
about far-fetched people. I share
with my audience the crises of
violence, life style and sexuality.
But by seeing these things from a
new perspective, the audience
may be given a heightened
perception into some of the crises
we all face."
Surprisingly, Avadon says he
has never been seriously harassed
during his more than 30,000 miles
of hitchhiking. "Most of the
danger has been in my
imagination. Once in Arkansas I
came to the conclusion that some
people who had given me a ride in
a pick-up truck were going to kill
me. But they ended up taking me
to their home and offering me
dinner. Everything has worked
out pretty well.
"Most of the people I get rides
from are from a very different
background than my parents. A
lot are truckdrivers and workmen.

Also drunks. Invariably, drunks
love to pick up hitchhikers. Some
of my rides with drunks have been
pretty scary as have some with
hillbillies who hadn't learned to
drive too well."
Avadon claims he's only gotten
one hitchhiking citation since he
began travelling, but last year, the
law almost forced a more
long-term change in his theatrical
plans. "In February 1971, I
refused induction into the Army.
When I left UCLA, I was 1-A and
I knew I'd have a draft problem. 1
already had some pretty strong
feelings against the draft, but my
contact with people on the road
convinced me that I couldn't
cooperate with the draft.
Especially influential was a soldier
with a face disfigured from
shrapnel who the Army wouldn't
give plastic surgery to."
After refusing induction,
Avadon came to trial in July and
was found guilty in the customary
10-15 minutes. He was sent to
Lompoc Federal Prison, north of
Santa Barbara for 90 days
observation, prior to final
sentencing. While at Lompoc,
Avadon started a theater troupe
and acting class.
15 persons were in his acting
class and he and two other
prisoners even performed a play
about prison life, "Keep Tightly
Closed in A Cool Dry Place," by
Megan Terry. Avadon said the
three of them were quite
apprehensive about what the
reactions of the other prisoners in
the audience would be, but he
claimed that "they dug the whole
play. They were cracking up
about prisoners doing a play
about prisoners bitching about
being prisoners."
After his 90 day stay, Avadon
was put on probation with the
stipulation that he perform
alternate service for three years.
During his travels, he had often
performed a children's show at
hospitals, orphanages and schools
and his probation officer
approved his idea of continuing
this to fulfill his alternate service
requirement.
"I did these children's shows
long before the alternate service
thing came up. They were a way
of becoming involved in the
community. These shows got me
into places I'd never otherwise get
to see. I do magic and tell stories,
but the kids actually do 90% of
the show." While at Stanford the
last two weeks, "Avadon has
performed at a number of schools,
primarily in East Palo Alto and
also at child care centers and
schools for the deaf.

Although he feels he would
still refuse induction, Avadon now
says he would do anything with
the exception of going into the
Army to avoid the tremendous
waste of prison. He says the
prison experience affected him
"tremendously" and that it is
reflected in the shows he has done
since his release.
"I lived with guys who were
nearly incapable of sustaining
themselves on the streets and with
prison personnel who conceived
of draft resisters as dangerous
criminals. Mostly it was being
there, knowing what I was capable
of doing, and seeing this
tremendous morass, almost like a
whirlpool of guys who could
never escape from prison or even
if they get out, who could never
escape from the tremendous
futility that most of them felt.
"My prison experiences gave
me such a tremendous drive and
ambition to go back and make my
performing succeed and succeed
even more phenomenally. What
developed in me was an ambition
and a drive which I can't even
begin to articulate. All my
thoughts went into how I could
do things ten times better.
"The difficulty in making my
work succeed is phenomenal. It's
so unconventional—you have to
learn everything for yourself. The
rewards are tremendous, but it is
very, very difficult to do this
week after week. I spend most of
my time dreaming up ideas and
improvements."
Avadon plans to continue to
travel and perform at least
through the remainder of this

year. His immediate plans will
take him into the Northwest and
this summer he will go to Alaska.
Then he says he will probably
return to Los Angeles and work
on organizing a larger travelling
troupe.
"I'd like to bring together a
very small theater group, maybe
six people at the most, which
would travel and perform in the
United States. We'd try to do the
same kind of theater I'm doing
now, only for more people. We'd
do it in cities and not so much in
universities. This would be a way
to utilize our talents for people in
communities. With a group like
this, we could perform in old
people's homes, prisons. .. .
"After that I'd like to develop
a theater school which would be a
permanent place for our troupe to
perform and to teach in. We'd
teach an alternative that isn't
necessarily limited to me or to a
few people. It could successfully
be accomplished in many cities,
generated from within. I travel
because I love it and not because
it is necessary for the kind of
theater I do.

"Maybe a theater troupe
should involve itself very much in
the community on a permanent
basis. They should be developing
shows which relate to things
happening in the community. So
the troupe could grow, mature
and change with the community.
People could respond with goods
or services from the community."
People never have to pay
admission for Avadon's shows,
but he does accept donations.
"Like performing outside,
donations are aesthetically a very
important part of the
performance so the audience can
respond in a personal way. Some
people respond with baked goods,
books, dinner invitations,
drawings. . . . People can respond
in a more personal and creative
way to what they see. Donations
encourage a more creative way. It
is very important that theater be
open to everyone who wants to
see it."
Avadon-Black will perform
tonight and tomorrow night at 8
p.m. in the Annenberg
Auditorium of the Cummings Art
Building.

Between classes this week at
the Engineering Corner, there
have been large groups of people
crowding around a mysterious
table and no thev are not fighting
over copies of the Daily, as we
might hope. The attraction has
been a simple magic show being
performed by one Avadon-Black.
Each morning Avadon has
brought his cards and walnut
shells to the Engineering Corner
and proceeded to baffle people
with his magic stunts. Most people
are probably already familiar with
the pea-under-the-walnut-shell
game, in which you put an object
under one of a number of shells,
move them around and have the
observors try to follow the one
with the object underneath it.
Avadon uses a small piece of
yellow foam rubber and three

shells and everytime you're
certain you can follow the lucky
shell, but you never can. Even
when Avadon lets an observer
leave his finger on the original
shell with the object, while he
moves them around, he always
succeeds in making the object
appear under another shell after
only five or six slow-paced moves.
And so no one ever wins Hoover
Tower, which he offers to any
victorious participant.
Avadon is a former UCLA
drama student who quit school
after two years in 1969 and
decided to hitchhike around the
country performing a show of
improvisations and sketches of life
on the road. Why did he leave the
security of a school with a good
drama department to try the
unknown?
"I wanted to build a theater

experience which would transcend
a lot of limits existing in theater.
A lot of theater is for an elitist
audience, but most beautiful
things are not and there are ways
to share those things with
everybody. I am basically
concerned with the things which
would be most beautiful and
universal in theater."
So in April 1969, Avadon
decided to hit the road and work
on implementing his theatrical
theories. "Before going to UCLA,
I wanted very much to be able to
travel and perform and create a
performance that would share the
tremendous potential in live
theater ... I thought the idea was
pretty crazy for awhile and I
thought I'd get talked out of it,
but I didn't. So I got a duffle bag
and headed for Arizona. I had no
show and very little idea of what
to do. AH I really knew was that I
would travel to universities.
Universities are the easiest place
to begin because being such tight
communities, it is easy to get to
the people."
Avadon's first stop was
Arizona State University. He went
to the head of the theater
department and described a
non-existent show which he said
he had developed hitchiking. He
got permission to perform and he
ended up doing a one man theater
piece based on a Henry Miller
work, "Smile at the Foot of a
Ladder."
But as he continued to
hitchhike, Avadon built his show
around experiences that
happened on the road. "I don't
try to reinforce any pre-conceived
notions. My show deals mostly
with the crises all of us have to
experience. It isn't especially
about far-fetched people. I share
with my audience the crises of
violence, life style and sexuality.
But by seeing these things from a
new perspective, the audience
may be given a heightened
perception into some of the crises
we all face."
Surprisingly, Avadon says he
has never been seriously harassed
during his more than 30,000 miles
of hitchhiking. "Most of the
danger has been in my
imagination. Once in Arkansas I
came to the conclusion that some
people who had given me a ride in
a pick-up truck were going to kill
me. But they ended up taking me
to their home and offering me
dinner. Everything has worked
out pretty well.
"Most of the people I get rides
from are from a very different
background than my parents. A
lot are truckdrivers and workmen.

Also drunks. Invariably, drunks
love to pick up hitchhikers. Some
of my rides with drunks have been
pretty scary as have some with
hillbillies who hadn't learned to
drive too well."
Avadon claims he's only gotten
one hitchhiking citation since he
began travelling, but last year, the
law almost forced a more
long-term change in his theatrical
plans. "In February 1971, I
refused induction into the Army.
When I left UCLA, I was 1-A and
I knew I'd have a draft problem. 1
already had some pretty strong
feelings against the draft, but my
contact with people on the road
convinced me that I couldn't
cooperate with the draft.
Especially influential was a soldier
with a face disfigured from
shrapnel who the Army wouldn't
give plastic surgery to."
After refusing induction,
Avadon came to trial in July and
was found guilty in the customary
10-15 minutes. He was sent to
Lompoc Federal Prison, north of
Santa Barbara for 90 days
observation, prior to final
sentencing. While at Lompoc,
Avadon started a theater troupe
and acting class.
15 persons were in his acting
class and he and two other
prisoners even performed a play
about prison life, "Keep Tightly
Closed in A Cool Dry Place," by
Megan Terry. Avadon said the
three of them were quite
apprehensive about what the
reactions of the other prisoners in
the audience would be, but he
claimed that "they dug the whole
play. They were cracking up
about prisoners doing a play
about prisoners bitching about
being prisoners."
After his 90 day stay, Avadon
was put on probation with the
stipulation that he perform
alternate service for three years.
During his travels, he had often
performed a children's show at
hospitals, orphanages and schools
and his probation officer
approved his idea of continuing
this to fulfill his alternate service
requirement.
"I did these children's shows
long before the alternate service
thing came up. They were a way
of becoming involved in the
community. These shows got me
into places I'd never otherwise get
to see. I do magic and tell stories,
but the kids actually do 90% of
the show." While at Stanford the
last two weeks, "Avadon has
performed at a number of schools,
primarily in East Palo Alto and
also at child care centers and
schools for the deaf.

Although he feels he would
still refuse induction, Avadon now
says he would do anything with
the exception of going into the
Army to avoid the tremendous
waste of prison. He says the
prison experience affected him
"tremendously" and that it is
reflected in the shows he has done
since his release.
"I lived with guys who were
nearly incapable of sustaining
themselves on the streets and with
prison personnel who conceived
of draft resisters as dangerous
criminals. Mostly it was being
there, knowing what I was capable
of doing, and seeing this
tremendous morass, almost like a
whirlpool of guys who could
never escape from prison or even
if they get out, who could never
escape from the tremendous
futility that most of them felt.
"My prison experiences gave
me such a tremendous drive and
ambition to go back and make my
performing succeed and succeed
even more phenomenally. What
developed in me was an ambition
and a drive which I can't even
begin to articulate. All my
thoughts went into how I could
do things ten times better.
"The difficulty in making my
work succeed is phenomenal. It's
so unconventional—you have to
learn everything for yourself. The
rewards are tremendous, but it is
very, very difficult to do this
week after week. I spend most of
my time dreaming up ideas and
improvements."
Avadon plans to continue to
travel and perform at least
through the remainder of this

year. His immediate plans will
take him into the Northwest and
this summer he will go to Alaska.
Then he says he will probably
return to Los Angeles and work
on organizing a larger travelling
troupe.
"I'd like to bring together a
very small theater group, maybe
six people at the most, which
would travel and perform in the
United States. We'd try to do the
same kind of theater I'm doing
now, only for more people. We'd
do it in cities and not so much in
universities. This would be a way
to utilize our talents for people in
communities. With a group like
this, we could perform in old
people's homes, prisons. .. .
"After that I'd like to develop
a theater school which would be a
permanent place for our troupe to
perform and to teach in. We'd
teach an alternative that isn't
necessarily limited to me or to a
few people. It could successfully
be accomplished in many cities,
generated from within. I travel
because I love it and not because
it is necessary for the kind of
theater I do.

"Maybe a theater troupe
should involve itself very much in
the community on a permanent
basis. They should be developing
shows which relate to things
happening in the community. So
the troupe could grow, mature
and change with the community.
People could respond with goods
or services from the community."
People never have to pay
admission for Avadon's shows,
but he does accept donations.
"Like performing outside,
donations are aesthetically a very
important part of the
performance so the audience can
respond in a personal way. Some
people respond with baked goods,
books, dinner invitations,
drawings. . . . People can respond
in a more personal and creative
way to what they see. Donations
encourage a more creative way. It
is very important that theater be
open to everyone who wants to
see it."
Avadon-Black will perform
tonight and tomorrow night at 8
p.m. in the Annenberg
Auditorium of the Cummings Art
Building.
