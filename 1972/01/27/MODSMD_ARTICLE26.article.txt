# Choir Performance
## Music As A Perfect Kneecap 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
Imagine if you will a great
kneecap, sublime clavicle, or a
splendid example of an equally
indifferent part of the anatomy.
This is difficult I realize (fetishism
aside), and perhaps explains my
self-consciousness in saying that a
great chamber choir visited
Stanford Sunday night. The idea
hardly turns one on. After all,
much of the repertory for
chamber choir is systematically
and elaborately boring. And the
opportunities for noticeable vocal
failure are at the very maximum
in a group of about twenty
singers.
Yet the Netherlands Chamber
Choir, led by Felix de Nobel,
triumphed over the myriad
possibilities for tedium by the
sheer juggernaut force of
perfection—and this in spite of a
program of sublime esoterica that
managed to avoide the 17th, 18th,
and 19th centuries and the
English language almost entirely.
One soprano, I thought, seemed a
bit push and another tenor rather
buzzy, but a change of seats at
intermission proved that even this

thin shred of human error was in
fact acoustic.
The Choir's brilliance is due to
its unusual maturity (most
members are middle-aged or
worse), the perfect balance among
and between the four vocal
ranges, the eiderdown lushness of
its total sound, and a sense of
intonation that is invariably right
on. These enviable forces were
given direction by de Nobel, who
succeeded in giving the audience
the illusion that six and eight part
choral singing is not only easy but
also comprehensible on first
hearing.
God works in wondrous and
mysterious ways, but surely no
more mysterious than the ways of
those 16th century composers
who thought nothing of
eight-voiced chorales. The Choir's
startling command of this
repertory was established in the
first half of the program. Though
these pieces no longer move the
spirit or soul as they should, they
were performed with
awe-inspiring fervor.
The highlight was surely
Gabrieli's two pieces "Timor et

tremor" and "O Jesu mi
dulcissime," whose excitingly
unpredictable harmonies and rich
rhythms the Choir fully explored.
The four secular songs by Hans
Leo Hassler (1564-1612) had the
happy effect—by a kind of
musical science fiction—of
transfering the audience
momentarily but completely into
another world.
The second half (20th century
composers opened with two bitter
pills: a "De profundis" in Hebrew
by Schoenberg and one in Latin
by Nystedt (1915- ). In the
former, Schoenberg spoke from
his dodecaphona) depths to
almost no effect. As is customary
upon the completion of any
12-tone choral work, the audience
waited ten befuddled seconds
before deciding to applaud. The
Nystedt work, based on the nearly
as hopeless style of the Gregorian
chant, did contain some exciting
moments and unusual effects.
Proceeding from the episcopal
gloom of organized religion
(which is dull at best), the Choir
turned to gloom of a more
affecting and individual sort, two

superb settings of Emily
Dickinson poems by a Dutchman.
The best item of the evening, they
caught perfectly, I thought, the
eerie tedium of depression which
one suspects is always just
beneath the surface of her poems,
even in her whimsical moments.
These, and (hopefully) others not
performed, surely deserve
recording.
The remainder of the selections
were folkloristic. Two Dutch
items were thoroughly pleasant.
Less successful were two songs by
Kodaly and one bit of fluff by
Bartok. Three encores, the last a
rousing wedding-dance song by
Kodaly, brought the concert to a
close.
My only reservation with the
Choir concerns its repertory:
when touring in America, more
effort should be made to present
American and English works. The
possible repertory, after all, is not
small. And, as de Nobel said from
the podium, in song it is the
words that count. All that Latin,
Hebrew, Dutch and German- and
two mere Dickinson poems
(added from the podium yet!).

before deciding to applaud. The
Nystedt work, based on the nearly
as hopeless style of the Gregorian
chant, did contain some exciting
moments and unusual effects.
Proceeding from the episcopal
gloom of organized religion
(which is dull at best), the Choir
turned to gloom of a more
affecting and individual sort, two

superb settings of Emily
Dickinson poems by a Dutchman.
The best item of the evening, they
caught perfectly, I thought, the
eerie tedium of depression which
one suspects is always just
beneath the surface of her poems,
even in her whimsical moments.
These, and (hopefully) others not
performed, surely deserve
recording.
The remainder of the selections
were folkloristic. Two Dutch
items were thoroughly pleasant.
Less successful were two songs by
Kodaly and one bit of fluff by
Bartok. Three encores, the last a
rousing wedding-dance song by
Kodaly, brought the concert to a
close.
My only reservation with the
Choir concerns its repertory:
when touring in America, more
effort should be made to present
American and English works. The
possible repertory, after all, is not
small. And, as de Nobel said from
the podium, in song it is the
words that count. All that Latin,
Hebrew, Dutch and German- and
two mere Dickinson poems
(added from the podium yet!).
Imagine if you will a great
kneecap, sublime clavicle, or a
splendid example of an equally
indifferent part of the anatomy.
This is difficult I realize (fetishism
aside), and perhaps explains my
self-consciousness in saying that a
great chamber choir visited
Stanford Sunday night. The idea
hardly turns one on. After all,
much of the repertory for
chamber choir is systematically
and elaborately boring. And the
opportunities for noticeable vocal
failure are at the very maximum
in a group of about twenty
singers.
Yet the Netherlands Chamber
Choir, led by Felix de Nobel,
triumphed over the myriad
possibilities for tedium by the
sheer juggernaut force of
perfection—and this in spite of a
program of sublime esoterica that
managed to avoide the 17th, 18th,
and 19th centuries and the
English language almost entirely.
One soprano, I thought, seemed a
bit push and another tenor rather
buzzy, but a change of seats at
intermission proved that even this

thin shred of human error was in
fact acoustic.
The Choir's brilliance is due to
its unusual maturity (most
members are middle-aged or
worse), the perfect balance among
and between the four vocal
ranges, the eiderdown lushness of
its total sound, and a sense of
intonation that is invariably right
on. These enviable forces were
given direction by de Nobel, who
succeeded in giving the audience
the illusion that six and eight part
choral singing is not only easy but
also comprehensible on first
hearing.
God works in wondrous and
mysterious ways, but surely no
more mysterious than the ways of
those 16th century composers
who thought nothing of
eight-voiced chorales. The Choir's
startling command of this
repertory was established in the
first half of the program. Though
these pieces no longer move the
spirit or soul as they should, they
were performed with
awe-inspiring fervor.
The highlight was surely
Gabrieli's two pieces "Timor et

tremor" and "O Jesu mi
dulcissime," whose excitingly
unpredictable harmonies and rich
rhythms the Choir fully explored.
The four secular songs by Hans
Leo Hassler (1564-1612) had the
happy effect—by a kind of
musical science fiction—of
transfering the audience
momentarily but completely into
another world.
The second half (20th century
composers opened with two bitter
pills: a "De profundis" in Hebrew
by Schoenberg and one in Latin
by Nystedt (1915- ). In the
former, Schoenberg spoke from
his dodecaphona) depths to
almost no effect. As is customary
upon the completion of any
12-tone choral work, the audience
waited ten befuddled seconds
before deciding to applaud. The
Nystedt work, based on the nearly
as hopeless style of the Gregorian
chant, did contain some exciting
moments and unusual effects.
