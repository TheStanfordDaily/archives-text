# Jing Lyman
## Yonghy-Bonghy & Jingly Jones 
### MARK WEAVER 
Most people call her "Jing," a
nickname from the poem by
Edward Lear called "The
Courtship of the Yonghy-Bonghy-
Bo." The poem is about the
unsuccessful courtship of the
Lady Jingly Jones by Mr.
Yonghy-Bonghy-80.
It is probably just as well
Yonghy failed because Jing found
Dick, who became President of
Stanford University, and they are
quite happily married. "She's
wonderful, superb, lively,
supportive, and a warm person,"
says he.
Asked if she would be a profile
subject, she quipped, "What
colors do you want to do it in:
pink, green, or maybe purple
passion?" She then burst into that
short-lived laugh that makes you
feel you've known her for years.
Advancing down the hallway
of the Lou Henry Hoover house,
she first looks like the security
guard. She is not as passive as
many presidents wives seem to be.
It is hard to keep up with her
wide and energetic walk.
Second impressions yield an
amiable, relaxed person,
comfortable to be with.
Marvelous Hostess
"She's a lovely, outgoing
person with an awfully good
humor," says Political Science
Professor Charles Drekmeier.
Being the President's wife puts
these qualities to the supreme test
because much of Jing's time is
consumed by entertaining. She
will host everything from a small
dinner party for the President of
San Jose State to a reception for
100 student wives. Planning these

events is no small job, even with
the help of an able staff.
Most of the entertaining takes
place in the Lou Henry Hoover
presidential house, the Lyman's
residence. "It's like living in a
museum," says Jing. Indeed, it is
impressive. Adorned with
historical artifacts and a dining
room the size of a restaurant, the
house is a "focal point of the
campus," she says.
First Lady Of Stanford
Does she like being called the
First Lady of Stanford? "I don't
want to be shoved into such a
mold; it makes us seem as if we're
not people. But, we are
individuals and perform our
institutional responsibilities as
individuals. We want to express
the diversity of Stanford to
people who are not familiar with
it. It's quite a juggling act."
Jing continues, "I try to work
in a positive way to break down
the barriers that exist around any
institutional figure, be it the
president's wife or anyone else."
She admits, "the tension is
unending," and it is a burden but
she wants to "see it through this
very difficult period and move
forward in a constructive way. I
care as deeply as my husband does
about this place and what the
university stands for. I have
wanted to be involved."
Jing Lyman is Chairman of the
Fair Housing Task Force of the
Stanford Mid-Peninsula Urban
Coalition and its Operation
Sentinel; an information campaign
to educate the public on fair
housing laws and offer redress to
those discriminated against.
"I am hopeful for the future,"

says the Chairman, "now the law
is on our side. We can convince
people it's not in anyone's best
interests to practice
discrimination." It ceases to be a
free choice if every time you
choose a place to live it is denied
you on a totally irrational basis."
Dolly Sacks, a co-worker on
the Task Force, says that Jing "is
a very good person to work with,
she allows us to work on our own
initiative. She's enthusiastic,
cooperative — just a real person —
and she knows a lot about the
subject."
Palo Alto realtor Howard
Lewis, worked with Mrs. Lyman
on the "No-on-14" campaign (14
was a proposition voted into the
California Constitution, voiding
fair housing laws, but later
declared unconstitutional) and is
her co-worker in Mid-Peninsula
Citizens for Fair Housing.
"If you're familiar with chess,"
he says, "she was a rook, a good
strong hard working, gutsy
woman who didn't give a damn
about who got the credit." Lewis
adds that such work "gets
obscured now that her husband is
President."
Savoir Faire
Jing Lyman has good ideas and
knows how to launch them, says
Sacks. "She is a good example of
the saying that the messenger and
message have to be the same to
get it across."
Sacks attributes her
involvement to "a real concern for
other people ... If it's students or
anybody getting a raw deal she'll
try to help them." President
Lyman says she was strongly
influenced by socially concerned
parents, but "she's a person in her
own way, she developed it on her
own initiative."
Elizabeth Schauffler Lyman
was born in Philadelphia in 1925.
Her father was a schoolteacher
and civil servant while her mother
was a schoolteacher who later
worked for the American Friends
Service Committee.
Jing attended public schools in
the East and then in Switzerland
in 1938. Her primary interests in
high school were creative arts,
drama, and student government.
She went on to Swarthmore and
was graduated in 1947 with a B.A.
in English and a minor in history.
That is where she met Richard
Lyman.
Dick and Jing
"I walked into the library. I
had on a Scottish Balmoral. I met
my French teacher, who asked if
it was a French hat. Then a voice
from behind said it was Scottish.
It was Dick, and we went into the
library together."
They were married in 1947 in
an outdoor ceremony on Great
Sprucehead Island, Maine. "Our
children say we had the first
hippie wedding," says the wife of
the President, who wore a
homeloomed Serbian skirt and a

peasant blouse at the ceremony.
Jing Lyman taught until the
pending birth of her first child in
1950. The family moved often as
Mr. Lyman studied at Harvard and
in England, and taught at
Swarthmore and Washington
University. In 1958 they came to
Stanford.
With her husband's
appointment, Jing allotted more
energy to university affairs. She is
still active in outside interests and
devotes much attention to her
family.
"I do discuss university matters
with Dick, but it's largely for my
information. Obviously, he makes
his own decisions." Actually, '"We
don't see that much of each
other," Jing jokes.
They have four children.
Jennifer, 21, is a senior at Yale,
and Holly, 18, is a sophomore at
Hampshire College in Amherst,
Mass. Christopher ("Crickett")
16, and Timothy, 14, attend high
school in the area.
Amusing Mother
Mom has an amusing concern
for her children. She recalls one
night her sons came home from a
birthday party. "They had dirty
shirts and ragged jeans on. I am
happy they feel able to behave in
a natural way."
Husband Dick comments on
her role as mother: "She's
dedicated but not oppressively so.
She's not the kind who would
smother her children."
The First Lady also loves
nature and is a member of the
Sierra Club, Audubon Society,
and Save the San Francisco Bay
Association. The family cat is
named John Muir after the
conservationist. The Lymans are
enthusiastic campers. "We like to
get to places where there aren't
many people," says she, "but we
don't have time for it anymore."
As a child, Jing helped build
her parent's log cabin in a
primitive area of Maine. Her
husband helped in later years,
digging the well. During a recent
camping trip in Europe, the
family's tent ripped apart in a
storm. "That was a dramatic
night. . ..we ended up in one of
those $5 a night German hotels."
The First Lady also has artistic
interests. "My ideal is to have a
roomful of Dutch Masters . .. the
opportunity to live with paintings
is very special and different from
seeing them in a gallery." She
loves baroque music and does her
own flower arranging.
Women's Liberation
Politically, Jing Lyman is
concerned with women's rights.
The no-vote on the day care
center fee assessment was
disappointing, "I think it's a pity.
I would like to have seen
recognition of the value it has to
all segments of the community."
Jing has urged the Faculty Wives
Club to devote more effort to
employment opportunities and

continuing education for women.
On the war, Jing Lyman says,
"I have no support for that
venture at all." She was one of the
2000 who marched to Palo Alto
last Spring because she was
assured it would be a legitimate,
non-violent effort.
Jing grips the arm of the couch
and stares at the floor looking for
words. "There has to be a way to
express dissent in a way which is

peaceful. When violence occurs,
the resulting destruction is a tragic
waste of resources, both human
and material."
Jing notes there are
conceivable cases where she would
not be pacifistic, where war would
be necessary.
"I also firmly believe in
individual responsibility for
effective government. Unless we
are interested and taking an active

role, we can't complain if
government doesn't work right."
Jing advises: "Use the
exuberance and vitality of your
youth to try many things. And
don't be too discouraged when
the first experiments don't seem
to work. There is a very important
learning process in failure, and
most especially in seeing failure
conquered."

DISCIPLINE—A student bicyclist overcomes the urge to ignore one of 50 new bicycle stop signs placed at
dangerous intersections on bike paths around campus. Although no wave of arrests seems imminent, bike
riders are subject to California's vehicle code, which requires them to stop at these intersections like other
vehicles.
