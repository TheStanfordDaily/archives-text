# Do Wrestlers Have More Fun?

### MARC SULLIVAN 
Last Saturday night at the Cow
Palace the "True Spirit of
America" confronted "The
Golden Greek" and others for a
prize of $11,000. That is, as
wrestler Kenji Shibuya explained,
enough to buy "rots and rots of
rice." Ripper Collins commented,
"For $11,000 I'd shove my
mothers teeth down her throat."
The above and other buffoonery
is brought to you in professional
"wrassling", which is the way
everyone says it.
There is a kind of magnificent,
surrealistic idiocy about this
sport. Droves of people (they
filled the Cow Palace Saturday)
come to watch an athletic
exhibition which they know has
been fixed in its action and
outcome. And they are not
indignant at this deception, they
wallow in it and seem to find it
part of the charm of the game.
Fairy Tale
Wrassling does have a kind of
fairy-tale charm to it. All the
characters are larger than life and

there is no doubt about good and
evil. And Saturday night was the
ultimate fairy-tale battle. The
featured event was an
eighteen-man battle royal for
$11,000, winner take all. The way
it works is, you put eighteen
wrestlers, weighing from 215 to
625 pounds, in the ring at once
and let them have at each other. A
man is disqualified if he is pinned
in the ring for a count of three, or
if he is pitched out over the top
rope and hits the concrete floor
about 10 feet below. This goes on
until there is one man left.
The pre-fight favorite was
Haystack Colhoun, weighing in at
625 pounds. He was nattily
attired in flannel shirt, striped
overalls cut off at the knees, bare
feet, and a chain around his neck
which is affectionately known as
"The Noggin Knocker." The
Stack has never been pinned, and
it appeared very unlikely that
anyone could propel 625 pounds
over the top rope. You had to put
your cash on the Stack.
Bad Guys
Billy Graham is a bad guy, but
he is far out. On the back of our
program was a picture of Billy,
weighing 285 pounds and attired
in a fringed vest and wrestling
trunks flexing his considerable
biceps. The caption read: "Billy
Graham, The True Spirit of
America." Maybe, but this was
not to be his night.
They were of course not the
only luminaries present. Ripper
Collins was there, Pat Patterson
and Rocky "Soulman" Johnson,
past and present "World
Champions" in this area,
attended, as did John Tolos, "The
Golden Greek." Finally, there was
Ray Stevens who won the last
battle Royal at the Cow Palace,
almost two years ago.
The wrestlers were introduced
individually, a good guy
alternating with a bad guy. These
rules are clearly defined and the
crowd knows which is which. If
you are a newcomer and don't
know there are some clues to help
you. Black wrestlers are good
guys. Oriental wrestlers are bad
guys. Samoans are good guys,
people with peroxide blond hair
are bad guys (Ray Stevens is an
exception).
Battle Royal
Finally, all eighteen were in the
ring just standing casually around.
The bell rang and each of the
eighteen suddenly turned to a
neighbor and started belting the
shit out of him. Eighteen big guys
thrashing around in a ring barely
large enough to contain them
standing still. Gradually people
began to leave. A few were
pinned, more went over the ropes,
and at least two were left bleeding
in the middle of the canvas, to lie
motionless in the midst of the

battle, until the referree could roll
them over to the apron, from
whence attendants could remove
the bodies.
Haystack made his fatal error
when there were only six men
left. In attempting to throw
another man out he lost balance
and Pat Patterson used the Stack's
625 pounds of inertia to send him
floating into the first row of seats.
In the end it came down to
Stevens and Patterson and it took
Stevens little time to pin his
apparently weary opponent.
There were a number of other
matches, but they all seemed
anti-climactic. Haystack did come
back to defeat a tag team
single-handed by knocking their
heads together and falling on top
of their bodies. This technique is
known as the "Big Splash" and it
sure enough put them away.
You've gotta check this out.
Very Heavy
The crowd, nattily attired in
grease and false eyelashes, loved
the spectacle, identifying like mad
with their favorite gladiator, and
hating the infidels who oppose
him. It is a crowd that wants its
entertainment straightforward,
that seems to have no time for
little complexities and
ambiguities. In wrassling there is
straightforward action aplenty
and even if it is all a fraud, at least
there is no doubt of it. There is
just the solid comfort of seeing
the True Spirit of America dressed
in lime green tights dropped 10
feet on to a hard cement floor.
Now that's heavy.

78 JET LEFT ON 2-In a meeting of the minds, a group of wrestlers huddle up in six man tag team
action. Wrestling has taken stranger forms than this, however. Some other popular events include the 18
man Battle Royal, 8 man tag team matches, cage wrestling, and midget wrestling. Promoter Roy Shire
filled the Cow Palace with 8,000 people last Saturday night to see his wrestlers do battle.

WE HAVE WAYS TO MAKE YOU TALK-Ripper Collins puts
pressure on Rick Hunter in the form of an illegal stranglehold. Collins
competed in the 18 man Battle Royal last Saturday night at the Cow
Palace. Although he lost, Collins had plenty of desire. He stated that
he would shove his mother's teeth down her throat for the 11,000
dollar prize money.
