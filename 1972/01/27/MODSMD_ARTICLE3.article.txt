# Land Use Plan For Endowment Holdings Praised By Some, Hit For Lack Of Enough New Housing
## 
### ROBERT BACON (Last in a series) 
On January 22, 1971, the
Livingston-Blayney Land Use
Pol icy/Plan was submitted to Stanford
officials. The San Francisco consulting
firm's document will serve as the basis
for planning use of Stanford's land
endowment over the next several
years.
The plan is currently under review
by university planning officials, and
has been submitted to surrounding
municipalities to obtain their
reactions.
Public hearings were held on
campus last spring by the Committee
on Land and Building Development, a
faculty-student panel now chaired by
Grant Fletcher, a medical school
professor. Last year the panel was
chaired by chemical engineer David M.
Mason and was sometimes known as
the Mason Committee.
Officials stress that the
Livingston-Blayney report will not
become an iron clad "official policy"
locking in Stanford planners for years
to come. The report contains several
alternative plans, and, said Land
Resources Manager Boyd Smith, "it's a
living document. . . it's not like a
house plan. It gives everyone — the
Stanford community and the other
communities — a chance to see our
thinking."
Academic Eminence
The Livingston-Blayney document

states that it is "based on three
principal considerations, which we list
in order of the weight we accorded
each:
"—Academic eminence of the
University.
Financial strength of the
University.
"—Benefits to surrounding
communities and the Mid-Peninsula
subregion."
Smith elaborated, "Our chief
business is education. All land use
decisions are subordinate to that."
University Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert R.
Augsburger, in a KZSU interview last
November 9, pointed out the relation
of these three factors: "Our first
priority is our academic needs, which
are twofold: to preserve space for the
unknown future, and to use our assets
wisely to support the academic
program. That doesn't mean we can't
accomplish both without
responsibility to the communities."
Land is an important part of
Stanford's endowment, Fletcher noted
last year. "No one would propose that
the . . . endowment funds be
kept ... in the President's
mattress . . . Similarly, the
non-academic lands should be
developed to yield financial support
for the institution," he added.
Critics of Stanford policy see the
Livingston-Blayney recommendations
quite differently. Don Willis, a

member of the Palo Alto Tenants
Union and Venceremos, described
them as "a continuation of the
previous policy, which is to maximize
profit on the land without regard to
any other consequences. Stanford land
policy is in the direct interest of the
Trustees and no one else."
Willis stated that top priority for
Stanford's land policies ought to be
benefits to people who work at
Stanford, followed by benefits to the
immediately surrounding
communities. He ventured that "the
whole spectrum of people who live
around Stanford realize what Stanford
land policy means to them, and
they're determined to fight
it. .. Middle-class liberals are joining,
too."
Specific Recommendations
The Livingston-Blayney report
proposes office development at the
May field School site as one of the first
projects to be undertaken. This site is
on El Camino across Page Mill Road
from the Palo Alto Square project.
They report points out that a new
development will "complement" the
Palo Alto Square "and will tend to
upgrade the quality of El Camino
frontage."
The report responds to a 1970
student-faculty committee's
recommendation that this site be
devoted to low-moderate income
housing by stating that the small size
of the site and its isolation from other

residential areas "inevitably would
create a ghetto pocket."
A struggle appears to be developing.
The site is presently occupied by a
continuation high school and a child
care center, and Stanford's plans are
being interpreted by some as
insensitivity to community needs,
particularly those of the poor.
According to Augsburger, the
development there, in addition to the
office buildings, will include a new
Palo Alto YMCA, in an attempt "to
reflect community needs."
Other projects given fairly high
priority by Livingston and Blayney
include:
—Completion of the industrial
development of the flanks of Coyote
Hill.
—Expansion of the Industrial Park
onto the Page Mill-Foothill site
(bounded by Page Mill Road, the
Foothill Expressway, Deer Creek, and
Deer Creek Road).
—Office development of the area
along Willow Road between the
Shopping Center and the Oak Creek
Apartments, also suggested by some as
a potential site for low-income
housing.
—An industrial park between San
Hill Road and the upper end of SLAC.
Postpone Housing
Regarding housing, the policy/plan
suggests that "it may be advisable to
postpone decisions on future
