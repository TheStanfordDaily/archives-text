World Reacts To Nixon Speech
WASHINGTON — Henry A. Kissinger said yesterday
Hanoi has balked at President Nixon's Vietnam
peace proposals on two counts: The fine print on
blueprints for a U.S. withdrawal and the election of
a new Saigon government.
Kissinger, Nixon's clandestine go-between in 12
just-disclosed secret Paris conferences with key
figures from Hanoi, said at a rare news conference
he still hopes for a negotiating breakthrough.
He called the Preident's eight-point proposal a
flexible one, not a take-it-or-leave-it proposition.
Nixon's peace offer includes an Indochina
cease-fire, withdrawal of American forces and
release of war prisoners, new elections in the South
with the Viet Cong participating, and resignation of
the Saigon government a month before the
internationally supervised balloting. All these
developments would take place within six months
after a Washington-Hanoi agreement.
Radio Hanoi, in a quick response to the
President's address, said it contained nothing new
and insisted that the U.S. position has "not changed
in any vyay." But the broadcast stopped short of
rejecting the proposal. The same was true of similar
denunciations voiced in Paris by Hanoi negotiators.
Elsewhere internationally, the response to
Nixon's disclosures found the Communist nations
generally disapproving and U.S. allies hopeful
although not necessarily confident.
On the domestic scene, comment from Congress
members tended to follow party lines but with
Democratic presidential aspirants in the Senate most
critical.
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who insists
he is not a candidate for president, said in a
statement that, instead of Nixon's eight-point plan,
"all we need is a one-point plan — a complete
withdrawal of American ground, sea and air forces,
by a date certain, in exchange for a return of our
prisoners.
"So long as we try to condition our withdrawal
on things like free elections, a cease-fire or any of
the other trappings disclosed last night... we shall
be pursuing the same blind alley in public
negotiations that we have followed with such
futility in private."
Kissinger also reported that on Aug. 16 the
United States offered a plan involving a promise to
withdraw all American forces from Vietnam by
Aug. 1, 1972, if Hanoi agreed to a settlement by last
Nov. 1.
He said the proposal was rejected Sept. 13, in
part because Hanoi felt the withdrawal date was too
far into the future.
Several relatives of American POWs praised
Nixon's peace proposals, calling them generous and
positive. But there was some doubt voiced. Some
added they will not be satisfied until their relatives
are home and indicated they intend to follow
through with plans to keep the issue before the
voters in this election year.

Clifford: No Cease-Fire
WASHINGTON - Former Defense Secretary Clark
M. Clifford said yesterday he believes there is no
chance that the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
will agree to President Nixon's peace proposal as
long as it contains a cease-fire provision.
Clifford said last summer he had secret
information that the North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong would release American prisoners in return for
a firm date for U.S. withdrawal from Indochina.
Without the cease-fire provision, Nixon's
proposals for U.S. troop withdrawal and a prisoner
exchange would be acceptable, Clifford said
yesterday in an interview. He declined to be quoted
directly.
Clifford was Secretary of Defense during 1968,
the last year of President Lyndon B. Johnson's
administration. When he assumed the office,
Clifford was a supporter of the Vietnam war but he
left office a dove, saying later he changed his mind
on the basis of what he had learned in his year at
the Pentagon.
Dan Berrigan Paroled
WASHINGTON — The Rev. Daniel Berrigan,
convicted in the Catonsville 9 draft-board raid, was
granted parole yesterday by the U.S. Board of
Parole, chairman George J. Reed announced.
The decision followed a hearing to consider new
information presented on Berrigan's behalf,
including details concerning his poor health.
Berrigan, 51, is the brother of the Rev. Philip
Berrigan who went on trial Monday in connection
with an alleged kidnap and bomb-plot conspiracy
involving White House foreign-affairs adviser Henry
Kissinger.
Berrigan was sentenced to three years
imprisonment for destruction of draft records at
Catonsville, Md., and began serving his sentence
Aug. 11,1970.
He was denied release by the board on July 28,
1971. They agreed last month to reopen his case for
further review.
Berrigan's parole becomes effective Feb. 24,
Reed said.
Berrigan presently is confined at the Federal
Correctional Institution at Danbury, Conn.
Two NYC Offices Bombed
NEW YORK — Two midtown booking offices which
import Russian performing talent were bombed
with incendiary devices and set afire yesterday. In
one of the blasts, a secretary was killed and
international impresario Sol Hurok, 83, rushed to a
hospital gasping from smoke.
Soon after the devices went off a few city blocks
apart, an anonymous telephone caller told The
Associated Press:
"Two incendiary devices just exploded in the
offices of Sol Hurok Enterprises on Sixth Avenue

and Columbia Artists on West 57th Street. These
two organizations bring Russian culture to this
country. This culture destroyed millions of Jews.
Cultural bridges of friendship will not be built over
the bodies of Soviet Jews."
Before he hung up, the caller voiced the "Never
Again" slogan of the militant Jewish Defense
League, which has conducted a campaign of
harrassment of Soviet diplomats in this country in
protest of what it terms mistreatment of Jews in
Russia.
In the past, the JDL has endorsed bombing of
Russian property here, without accepting
responsibility for such deeds. This time a JDL
spokesman suggested the telephone caller was a
provacateur trying to discredit the organization, and
added: "We deplore an attack of this nature upon
an American organization."
Slayer Found Guilty
NEVADA CITY, Calif. - Clarence Otis Smith was
convicted of first and second degree murder last
night in the "sickle slaying" of two campers at a
Sierra campground last summer.
The lanky former 44-year-old Auburn
garbageman took the verdict calmly.
He was convicted of first degree murder in the
killing of Donna Fitzhugh of Ontario. The second
degree murder verdict was for the slaying of John
Simmons of Weimar.
Both were hacked to death July 12 at the Dog
Bar campground along the Bear River about two
miles from Smith's home in Weimar. Survivors of
the bloody attack said the assailant was smiling and
growling like an animal.
Smith also was convicted of one count of
attempted murder and one of assault in the injury
of two survivors.
Judge Harold Wolters ordered the jury to return
Friday for a second phase of the trial determining
Smith's sanity.
Smith pleaded innocent and innocent by reason
of insanity. He had claimed he was at home the day
of the murders.
Senate OK's Rights Proposal
WASHINGTON — By a 48-46 vote, civil rights
forces squeaked to a victory yesterday in a Senate
fight over enforcement of equal and employment
legislation.
The outcome was just the reverse of what
happened earlier in the House, leaving the final
verdict in doubt.
The bill before the Senate, still a long way from
passage, would confer authority on the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission to issue
cease-and-desist orders when it decides there has
been discrimination based on race, sex or religion.

Nixon's peace proposals, calling them generous and

voters in this election year.

Clifford: No Cease-Fire
WASHINGTON - Former Defense Secretary Clark
M. Clifford said yesterday he believes there is no
chance that the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
will agree to President Nixon's peace proposal as
long as it contains a cease-fire provision.
Clifford said last summer he had secret
information that the North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong would release American prisoners in return for
a firm date for U.S. withdrawal from Indochina.
Without the cease-fire provision, Nixon's
proposals for U.S. troop withdrawal and a prisoner
exchange would be acceptable, Clifford said
yesterday in an interview. He declined to be quoted
directly.
Clifford was Secretary of Defense during 1968,
the last year of President Lyndon B. Johnson's
administration. When he assumed the office,
Clifford was a supporter of the Vietnam war but he
left office a dove, saying later he changed his mind
on the basis of what he had learned in his year at
the Pentagon.
Dan Berrigan Paroled
WASHINGTON — The Rev. Daniel Berrigan,
convicted in the Catonsville 9 draft-board raid, was
granted parole yesterday by the U.S. Board of
Parole, chairman George J. Reed announced.
The decision followed a hearing to consider new
information presented on Berrigan's behalf,
including details concerning his poor health.
Berrigan, 51, is the brother of the Rev. Philip
Berrigan who went on trial Monday in connection
with an alleged kidnap and bomb-plot conspiracy
involving White House foreign-affairs adviser Henry
Kissinger.
Berrigan was sentenced to three years
imprisonment for destruction of draft records at
Catonsville, Md., and began serving his sentence
Aug. 11,1970.
He was denied release by the board on July 28,
1971. They agreed last month to reopen his case for
further review.
Berrigan's parole becomes effective Feb. 24,
Reed said.
Berrigan presently is confined at the Federal
Correctional Institution at Danbury, Conn.
Two NYC Offices Bombed
NEW YORK — Two midtown booking offices which
import Russian performing talent were bombed
with incendiary devices and set afire yesterday. In
one of the blasts, a secretary was killed and
international impresario Sol Hurok, 83, rushed to a
hospital gasping from smoke.
Soon after the devices went off a few city blocks
apart, an anonymous telephone caller told The
Associated Press:
"Two incendiary devices just exploded in the
offices of Sol Hurok Enterprises on Sixth Avenue

and Columbia Artists on West 57th Street. These
two organizations bring Russian culture to this
country. This culture destroyed millions of Jews.
Cultural bridges of friendship will not be built over
the bodies of Soviet Jews."
Before he hung up, the caller voiced the "Never
Again" slogan of the militant Jewish Defense
League, which has conducted a campaign of
harrassment of Soviet diplomats in this country in
protest of what it terms mistreatment of Jews in
Russia.
In the past, the JDL has endorsed bombing of
Russian property here, without accepting
responsibility for such deeds. This time a JDL
spokesman suggested the telephone caller was a
provacateur trying to discredit the organization, and
added: "We deplore an attack of this nature upon
an American organization."
Slayer Found Guilty
NEVADA CITY, Calif. - Clarence Otis Smith was
convicted of first and second degree murder last
night in the "sickle slaying" of two campers at a
Sierra campground last summer.
The lanky former 44-year-old Auburn
garbageman took the verdict calmly.
He was convicted of first degree murder in the
killing of Donna Fitzhugh of Ontario. The second
degree murder verdict was for the slaying of John
Simmons of Weimar.
Both were hacked to death July 12 at the Dog
Bar campground along the Bear River about two
miles from Smith's home in Weimar. Survivors of
the bloody attack said the assailant was smiling and
growling like an animal.
Smith also was convicted of one count of
attempted murder and one of assault in the injury
of two survivors.
Judge Harold Wolters ordered the jury to return
Friday for a second phase of the trial determining
Smith's sanity.
Smith pleaded innocent and innocent by reason
of insanity. He had claimed he was at home the day
of the murders.
Senate OK's Rights Proposal
WASHINGTON — By a 48-46 vote, civil rights
forces squeaked to a victory yesterday in a Senate
fight over enforcement of equal and employment
legislation.
The outcome was just the reverse of what
happened earlier in the House, leaving the final
verdict in doubt.
The bill before the Senate, still a long way from
passage, would confer authority on the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission to issue
cease-and-desist orders when it decides there has
been discrimination based on race, sex or religion.
World Reacts To Nixon Speech
WASHINGTON — Henry A. Kissinger said yesterday
Hanoi has balked at President Nixon's Vietnam
peace proposals on two counts: The fine print on
blueprints for a U.S. withdrawal and the election of
a new Saigon government.
Kissinger, Nixon's clandestine go-between in 12
just-disclosed secret Paris conferences with key
figures from Hanoi, said at a rare news conference
he still hopes for a negotiating breakthrough.
He called the Preident's eight-point proposal a
flexible one, not a take-it-or-leave-it proposition.
Nixon's peace offer includes an Indochina
cease-fire, withdrawal of American forces and
release of war prisoners, new elections in the South
with the Viet Cong participating, and resignation of
the Saigon government a month before the
internationally supervised balloting. All these
developments would take place within six months
after a Washington-Hanoi agreement.
Radio Hanoi, in a quick response to the
President's address, said it contained nothing new
and insisted that the U.S. position has "not changed
in any vyay." But the broadcast stopped short of
rejecting the proposal. The same was true of similar
denunciations voiced in Paris by Hanoi negotiators.
Elsewhere internationally, the response to
Nixon's disclosures found the Communist nations
generally disapproving and U.S. allies hopeful
although not necessarily confident.
On the domestic scene, comment from Congress
members tended to follow party lines but with
Democratic presidential aspirants in the Senate most
critical.
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who insists
he is not a candidate for president, said in a
statement that, instead of Nixon's eight-point plan,
"all we need is a one-point plan — a complete
withdrawal of American ground, sea and air forces,
by a date certain, in exchange for a return of our
prisoners.
"So long as we try to condition our withdrawal
on things like free elections, a cease-fire or any of
the other trappings disclosed last night... we shall
be pursuing the same blind alley in public
negotiations that we have followed with such
futility in private."
Kissinger also reported that on Aug. 16 the
United States offered a plan involving a promise to
withdraw all American forces from Vietnam by
Aug. 1, 1972, if Hanoi agreed to a settlement by last
Nov. 1.
He said the proposal was rejected Sept. 13, in
part because Hanoi felt the withdrawal date was too
far into the future.
Several relatives of American POWs praised
Nixon's peace proposals, calling them generous and
positive. But there was some doubt voiced. Some

one of the blasts, a secretary was killed and
international impresario Sol Hurok, 83, rushed to a
hospital gasping from smoke.
Soon after the devices went off a few city blocks
apart, an anonymous telephone caller told The
Associated Press:
"Two incendiary devices just exploded in the
offices of Sol Hurok Enterprises on Sixth Avenue

and Columbia Artists on West 57th Street. These
two organizations bring Russian culture to this
country. This culture destroyed millions of Jews.
Cultural bridges of friendship will not be built over
the bodies of Soviet Jews."
Before he hung up, the caller voiced the "Never
Again" slogan of the militant Jewish Defense
League, which has conducted a campaign of
harrassment of Soviet diplomats in this country in
protest of what it terms mistreatment of Jews in
Russia.
In the past, the JDL has endorsed bombing of
Russian property here, without accepting
responsibility for such deeds. This time a JDL
spokesman suggested the telephone caller was a
provacateur trying to discredit the organization, and
added: "We deplore an attack of this nature upon
an American organization."
Slayer Found Guilty
NEVADA CITY, Calif. - Clarence Otis Smith was
convicted of first and second degree murder last
night in the "sickle slaying" of two campers at a
Sierra campground last summer.
The lanky former 44-year-old Auburn
garbageman took the verdict calmly.
He was convicted of first degree murder in the
killing of Donna Fitzhugh of Ontario. The second
degree murder verdict was for the slaying of John
Simmons of Weimar.
Both were hacked to death July 12 at the Dog
Bar campground along the Bear River about two
miles from Smith's home in Weimar. Survivors of
the bloody attack said the assailant was smiling and
growling like an animal.
Smith also was convicted of one count of
attempted murder and one of assault in the injury
of two survivors.
Judge Harold Wolters ordered the jury to return
Friday for a second phase of the trial determining
Smith's sanity.
Smith pleaded innocent and innocent by reason
of insanity. He had claimed he was at home the day
of the murders.
Senate OK's Rights Proposal
WASHINGTON — By a 48-46 vote, civil rights
forces squeaked to a victory yesterday in a Senate
fight over enforcement of equal and employment
legislation.
The outcome was just the reverse of what
happened earlier in the House, leaving the final
verdict in doubt.
The bill before the Senate, still a long way from
passage, would confer authority on the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission to issue
cease-and-desist orders when it decides there has
been discrimination based on race, sex or religion.
World Reacts To Nixon Speech
WASHINGTON — Henry A. Kissinger said yesterday
Hanoi has balked at President Nixon's Vietnam
peace proposals on two counts: The fine print on
blueprints for a U.S. withdrawal and the election of
a new Saigon government.
Kissinger, Nixon's clandestine go-between in 12
just-disclosed secret Paris conferences with key
figures from Hanoi, said at a rare news conference
he still hopes for a negotiating breakthrough.
He called the Preident's eight-point proposal a
flexible one, not a take-it-or-leave-it proposition.
Nixon's peace offer includes an Indochina
cease-fire, withdrawal of American forces and
release of war prisoners, new elections in the South
with the Viet Cong participating, and resignation of
the Saigon government a month before the
internationally supervised balloting. All these
developments would take place within six months
after a Washington-Hanoi agreement.
Radio Hanoi, in a quick response to the
President's address, said it contained nothing new
and insisted that the U.S. position has "not changed
in any vyay." But the broadcast stopped short of
rejecting the proposal. The same was true of similar
denunciations voiced in Paris by Hanoi negotiators.
Elsewhere internationally, the response to
Nixon's disclosures found the Communist nations
generally disapproving and U.S. allies hopeful
although not necessarily confident.
On the domestic scene, comment from Congress
members tended to follow party lines but with
Democratic presidential aspirants in the Senate most
critical.
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who insists
he is not a candidate for president, said in a
statement that, instead of Nixon's eight-point plan,
"all we need is a one-point plan — a complete
withdrawal of American ground, sea and air forces,
by a date certain, in exchange for a return of our
prisoners.
"So long as we try to condition our withdrawal
on things like free elections, a cease-fire or any of
the other trappings disclosed last night... we shall
be pursuing the same blind alley in public
negotiations that we have followed with such
futility in private."
Kissinger also reported that on Aug. 16 the
United States offered a plan involving a promise to
withdraw all American forces from Vietnam by
Aug. 1, 1972, if Hanoi agreed to a settlement by last
Nov. 1.
He said the proposal was rejected Sept. 13, in
part because Hanoi felt the withdrawal date was too
far into the future.
Several relatives of American POWs praised
Nixon's peace proposals, calling them generous and
positive. But there was some doubt voiced. Some
added they will not be satisfied until their relatives
are home and indicated they intend to follow
through with plans to keep the issue before the
voters in this election year.

Clifford: No Cease-Fire
WASHINGTON - Former Defense Secretary Clark
M. Clifford said yesterday he believes there is no
chance that the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
will agree to President Nixon's peace proposal as
long as it contains a cease-fire provision.
Clifford said last summer he had secret
information that the North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong would release American prisoners in return for
a firm date for U.S. withdrawal from Indochina.
Without the cease-fire provision, Nixon's
proposals for U.S. troop withdrawal and a prisoner
exchange would be acceptable, Clifford said
yesterday in an interview. He declined to be quoted
directly.
Clifford was Secretary of Defense during 1968,
the last year of President Lyndon B. Johnson's
administration. When he assumed the office,
Clifford was a supporter of the Vietnam war but he
left office a dove, saying later he changed his mind
on the basis of what he had learned in his year at
the Pentagon.
Dan Berrigan Paroled
WASHINGTON — The Rev. Daniel Berrigan,
convicted in the Catonsville 9 draft-board raid, was
granted parole yesterday by the U.S. Board of
Parole, chairman George J. Reed announced.
The decision followed a hearing to consider new
information presented on Berrigan's behalf,
including details concerning his poor health.
Berrigan, 51, is the brother of the Rev. Philip
Berrigan who went on trial Monday in connection
with an alleged kidnap and bomb-plot conspiracy
involving White House foreign-affairs adviser Henry
Kissinger.
Berrigan was sentenced to three years
imprisonment for destruction of draft records at
Catonsville, Md., and began serving his sentence
Aug. 11,1970.
He was denied release by the board on July 28,
1971. They agreed last month to reopen his case for
further review.
Berrigan's parole becomes effective Feb. 24,
Reed said.
Berrigan presently is confined at the Federal
Correctional Institution at Danbury, Conn.
