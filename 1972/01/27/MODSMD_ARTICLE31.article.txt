# Tuition Fees Exempt From Price Freeze
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Cost of Living
Council yesterday exempted tuition
fees and room and board charges of
private, nonprofit schools, colleges and
universities from price controls.
The decision affects thousands of
church-related schools and other
private educational institutions
(including Stanford) across the
country. However, the council had no
estimate of the scope of the
exemption.
The exemption was recommended
by the Price Commission.
The decision places nonprofit

educational institutions on the same
basis as publicly operated educational
institutions, Rumsfeld said.
Tuition and other charges of public
schools were covered in a previous
exemption of certain fees and charges
of state and local governments.
The council said tuition fees
charged by nonprofit educational
institutions "are usually insufficient to
cover educational costs."
The exemption will end
unnecessary red tape and paperwork
not only for the schools but also for
the Price Commission, Director
Donald Rumsfeld said.
