Franklin And Shockley
Editor, THE DAILY:
Nearly all the rhetoric
espoused by Mr. Franklin's
advocates has been deeply imbued
with the "political" overtones
that what happened to Bruce was
in large part due to the
"Establishment's" reaction to his
particular political philosophy.
The would have us believe that
his (Franklin's) dismissal had
more to do with Bruce as an
individual than as an English
professor found to have openly
instigated violent acts. Professor
Packer (in an article entitled "Not
A Political Trial" - The Daily,
Jan. 17, 1972) seems to have
neatly refuted this notion.
The issue here is not Bruce
Franklin's philosophy or his
personal worht, but the subjective
merit, or lack thereof, of his
actions. By firing Bruce, the
university has merely affirmed the
proposition that it is not within
the scope of a teacher's duties to
promote violence; they have not
condemned Bruce as a person.
Suppose that Professor William
Shockley, (the advocate of Black
genetic inferiority) whose
aberrant ruminations have so far
been confined to the world of
academia, were to embark on a
campaign advocating the
involuntary sterilization of
sub-intelligent males, and at his
instigation, several of his
supporters attempted to castrate
Spro Agnew. What would be the
reason for his dismissal from
Stanford? That he approved of

what his lackeys did, or that, as a
supposedly learned man, whose
job is to convey the supremacy of
knowledge and reason, the
promulgation of violence is not a
condition of his employment.

Smug About Smog?
Editor, THE DAILY:
Publication of a daily Smog
Index by the Bay Area Pollution
Control District has been
advocated by a writer to The
Daily.
The intention is that informing
the public of pollutants in the air
'might inspire us to more action in
cleaning it up.'
If the information is merely
announced along with the weather
reports, the public will accept
smog as just another inevitability
like the rainfall and the
temperature.
The need is to educate the
public to the recognition that
smog is not like these natural
phenomena. On the other hand, it
is a consequence of choices made
by persons in various positions of
power to chooseâ€”politicians,
business executives, and
consumers.
Unlike the rain and humidity,
smog is subject to human control.
It could be eliminated by the
appropriate selection of options
other than those which are now
high on our scale of values, the
convenient mobility of the private
automobile, the ready availability
of low-priced consumer goods

produced by industry geared to
minimum costs rather than
minimum ecological impact, and
so on.
It is necessary now not merely
to show that smog exists and is
harmful, but also to show the
people that they can eliminate it
when persuaded that the price of
doing so is worht paying.

Tuition Hike Preferred?
Editor, THE DAILY:
The following letter was
circulated to students of Brown
University, Providence, Rhode
Island, to announce one effect of
a particular budget cut.
Oh Budget Adjustment
Program Committee, where is thy
sting?
"Due to oncoming University
financial crisis, we feel it is
necessary to take appropriate
action to alleviate this problem
somewhat. Consequently, the
administration has decided that
during intersession, pay toilets
will be installed throughout the
University for a trial period of one
semester. The anticipated fee is
ten cents. Free toilets will be left
open in Faunce House and Sharpe
Refectory during most of the day
for your convenience. We
sincerely regret having to take this
measure and hope you will soon
become accustomed to the
situation at hand."
Mason Blacher,
