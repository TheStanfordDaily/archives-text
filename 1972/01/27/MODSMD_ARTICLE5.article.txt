## War: Grown-Up Playpen 
### 
dan higgins

The credibility gap has struck
again. It's been made perfectly
clear to all of us that American
war technology is alive and well,
and growing more powerful,
sophisticated, and deadly every
day.
Nothing new about that, but
for some reason this issue has
pushed almost everyone into
'taking sides'. There are a great
many who strongly oppose the
war machine for moral or political
reasons, and there are certainly as
many again on the other side of
the fence who feel inclined to
support it on the basis of military
necessity.
It occurs to me that both sides,
to a certain extent, are treading
murky waters. First of all, most of
what we know about war
technology is clouded by the
standard governmental policy of
secret-keeping which always
manages to further entangle
popular misconceptions.
The government's fairy tales
about the effectiveness of war
technology are seldom
constructed with truth as their
function. Rather, they are
fabricated with the intentions of
pacifying one group or the other,
which ever one is most convenient
at the moment.
Fancy Technology
The next place where we've
missed the boat is in accepting the
effectiveness of technology
without question. The fact is that
no amount of fancy technology
will ever win a war when applied

by unwilling soldiers whose
vitality and will has been sapped
by a policy that is shot full of
contradiction and corruption.
Superior force has a long
history of being beaten by simple,
honest determination. Remeber
that ragged little army huddled at
Valley Forge that beat the most
powerful nation in the world.
That man who is crawling in the
mud must have a good cause, for
the cause has always beaten the
force, and I would like to suggest
that no amount of technology is
ever going to change that scheme
of things.
If you are worrying about the
campus recruitment of new talent
to bolster the war industries, go
ahead and get a little upset. It's
not worth getting ulcers over,
though, because the simple fact is
that most of what they make for
the war doesn't work.
Granted, naphalm and B-52s
kill and maim a lot of living
things. It's ugly to say, but it's
true that B-52s and naphalm are
old-hat. Certainly you didn't
think that anyone who was hired
by the war-related industries last
Monday was going to work on
B-525, and neither will anyone
who's hired next week or next
month.
Extravagant Fizzles
It is more likely that they will
be working on some extravagant
fizzle like the F-111, and if you
were getting up-tight about people
objecting to war industries then
its not worth you getting ulcers
either. Don't be awed into a
trusting security by the mystic
aura of super technology. For
what we spent on, and got out of,
the F-111, we might as well have
bought stock in a Chilean mining
company just before that
, government took them over.
But, alas, we have a real war; a
! playground for our toys. If you
i were a soldier on that playground
J you might wonder why you spent
i so much of your time guarding

the panecea-technology. After all,
the technology was carefully
devised so that when the enemy,
being only tin soldiers with
predictable movements, was in
area Z, situation Band condition
X, the wonderful machine would
quickly eliminate him and all
would be well.

"Remember that ragged little
army huddled at Valley
Forge that beat the most
powerful nation in the world.
That man who is crawling in
the mud must have a good
cause, for the cause has
always beaten the force.. .

For a variety of reasons it
never quite worked out that way.
As it sat there and weltered in its
glory you came to realize that it
provided for little more than
something to guard.
Another nice thing about the
technological gimicks is that they
always take precedence over
people. If you were a patrol leader
on that playground you might
have wondered why nobody got
too upset if you lost three men in
combat, but if you lost a
super-duper 'starlight scope' you
were up against the wall at the
colonel's place.
The starlight scope is an
excellent example of our fine
technology. It is a night vision
scope for a rifle costing up to
three thousand dollars that
enables you to see the enemy-on
bright nights (when you can see
anyway) and not on dark nights
(when you can't see anyway).
Erecting Towers
Then there was McNamara's
electronic battlefield which we
kept trying to erect on the DMZ.
Notice I said "trying". Part of it
consisted of a chain of sixty-five
foot towers. (Technology is
beautiful, too, because it is so

realistic. Can you imagine yourself
in a sixty-five foot tower in
the middle of a battle? That is
about seventy feet in the wrong
direction!)
The trouble with the towers
was that they kept getting
blown-up, but nobody was every
quite sure who was doing it. All
that was known was that the
heavy wooden planks used to
build the towers kept finding their
way into Gl's bunkers. Again, the
technological concept of reality
was lacking.
Some wizzard at a desk
decided that it was more
important to use the available
material to build towers than to
give it to the front line troops
who needed it for their own
survival. That is not to say that
the Gls stole the towers, they
were simply re-ordering priorities.
Such has been the fate of all
technology that persists in
ignoring human priorities.
Undoubtedly, the finest
example of all took place on a
dark and dreary night in the
Republic of Viet Nam. There is a
type of night observation plane
equipped with a special heat (
sensor that can detect a human on
the ground by his body heat, and
one of these detected about two
hundred enemy moving on the
ground on that dark night.
Every B-52 mission in that
sector of Viet Nam was diverted
to this prime target. One hundred
and fifty million dollars worth of
B-52s dropped to hundred
thousand dollars worth of high
explosive on the target. The next
morning a ground patrol sent in to
investigate reported that the strike
had successfully wiped-out a large
herd of baboons.
Need I say more. Thank God
super plastic technology is such a
failure that it hasn't reached a
slaughterhouse efficiency, and if
you were trusting in it, watch out.

about seventy feet in the wrong
direction!)
The trouble with the towers
was that they kept getting
blown-up, but nobody was every
quite sure who was doing it. All
that was known was that the
heavy wooden planks used to
build the towers kept finding their
way into Gl's bunkers. Again, the
technological concept of reality
was lacking.
Some wizzard at a desk
decided that it was more
important to use the available
material to build towers than to
give it to the front line troops
who needed it for their own
survival. That is not to say that
the Gls stole the towers, they
were simply re-ordering priorities.
Such has been the fate of all
technology that persists in
ignoring human priorities.
Undoubtedly, the finest
example of all took place on a
dark and dreary night in the
Republic of Viet Nam. There is a
type of night observation plane
equipped with a special heat (
sensor that can detect a human on
the ground by his body heat, and
one of these detected about two
hundred enemy moving on the
ground on that dark night.
Every B-52 mission in that
sector of Viet Nam was diverted
to this prime target. One hundred
and fifty million dollars worth of
B-52s dropped to hundred
thousand dollars worth of high
explosive on the target. The next
morning a ground patrol sent in to
investigate reported that the strike
had successfully wiped-out a large
herd of baboons.
Need I say more. Thank God
super plastic technology is such a
failure that it hasn't reached a
slaughterhouse efficiency, and if
you were trusting in it, watch out.

The credibility gap has struck
again. It's been made perfectly
clear to all of us that American
war technology is alive and well,
and growing more powerful,
sophisticated, and deadly every
day.
Nothing new about that, but
for some reason this issue has
pushed almost everyone into
'taking sides'. There are a great
many who strongly oppose the
war machine for moral or political
reasons, and there are certainly as
many again on the other side of
the fence who feel inclined to
support it on the basis of military
necessity.
It occurs to me that both sides,
to a certain extent, are treading
murky waters. First of all, most of
what we know about war
technology is clouded by the
standard governmental policy of
secret-keeping which always
manages to further entangle
popular misconceptions.
The government's fairy tales
about the effectiveness of war
technology are seldom
constructed with truth as their
function. Rather, they are
fabricated with the intentions of
pacifying one group or the other,
which ever one is most convenient
at the moment.
Fancy Technology
The next place where we've
missed the boat is in accepting the
effectiveness of technology
without question. The fact is that
no amount of fancy technology
will ever win a war when applied

by unwilling soldiers whose
vitality and will has been sapped
by a policy that is shot full of
contradiction and corruption.
Superior force has a long
history of being beaten by simple,
honest determination. Remeber
that ragged little army huddled at
Valley Forge that beat the most
powerful nation in the world.
That man who is crawling in the
mud must have a good cause, for
the cause has always beaten the
force, and I would like to suggest
that no amount of technology is
ever going to change that scheme
of things.
If you are worrying about the
campus recruitment of new talent
to bolster the war industries, go
ahead and get a little upset. It's
not worth getting ulcers over,
though, because the simple fact is
that most of what they make for
the war doesn't work.
Granted, naphalm and B-52s
kill and maim a lot of living
things. It's ugly to say, but it's
true that B-52s and naphalm are
old-hat. Certainly you didn't
think that anyone who was hired
by the war-related industries last
Monday was going to work on
B-525, and neither will anyone
who's hired next week or next
month.
Extravagant Fizzles
It is more likely that they will
be working on some extravagant
fizzle like the F-111, and if you
were getting up-tight about people
objecting to war industries then
its not worth you getting ulcers
either. Don't be awed into a
trusting security by the mystic
aura of super technology. For
what we spent on, and got out of,
the F-111, we might as well have
bought stock in a Chilean mining
company just before that
, government took them over.
But, alas, we have a real war; a
! playground for our toys. If you
i were a soldier on that playground
J you might wonder why you spent
i so much of your time guarding

the panecea-technology. After all,
the technology was carefully
devised so that when the enemy,
being only tin soldiers with
predictable movements, was in
area Z, situation Band condition
X, the wonderful machine would
quickly eliminate him and all
would be well.

"Remember that ragged little
army huddled at Valley
Forge that beat the most
powerful nation in the world.
That man who is crawling in
the mud must have a good
cause, for the cause has
always beaten the force.. .

For a variety of reasons it
never quite worked out that way.
As it sat there and weltered in its
glory you came to realize that it
provided for little more than
something to guard.
Another nice thing about the
technological gimicks is that they
always take precedence over
people. If you were a patrol leader
on that playground you might
have wondered why nobody got
too upset if you lost three men in
combat, but if you lost a
super-duper 'starlight scope' you
were up against the wall at the
colonel's place.
The starlight scope is an
excellent example of our fine
technology. It is a night vision
scope for a rifle costing up to
three thousand dollars that
enables you to see the enemy-on
bright nights (when you can see
anyway) and not on dark nights
(when you can't see anyway).
Erecting Towers
Then there was McNamara's
electronic battlefield which we
kept trying to erect on the DMZ.
Notice I said "trying". Part of it
consisted of a chain of sixty-five
foot towers. (Technology is
beautiful, too, because it is so

realistic. Can you imagine yourself
in a sixty-five foot tower in
the middle of a battle? That is
about seventy feet in the wrong
direction!)

devised so that when the enemy,
being only tin soldiers with
predictable movements, was in
area Z, situation Band condition
X, the wonderful machine would
quickly eliminate him and all
would be well.

"Remember that ragged little
army huddled at Valley
Forge that beat the most
powerful nation in the world.
That man who is crawling in
the mud must have a good
cause, for the cause has
always beaten the force.. .

For a variety of reasons it
never quite worked out that way.
As it sat there and weltered in its
glory you came to realize that it
provided for little more than
something to guard.
Another nice thing about the
technological gimicks is that they
always take precedence over
people. If you were a patrol leader
on that playground you might
have wondered why nobody got
too upset if you lost three men in
combat, but if you lost a
super-duper 'starlight scope' you
were up against the wall at the
colonel's place.
The starlight scope is an
excellent example of our fine
technology. It is a night vision
scope for a rifle costing up to
three thousand dollars that
enables you to see the enemy-on
bright nights (when you can see
anyway) and not on dark nights
(when you can't see anyway).
Erecting Towers
Then there was McNamara's
electronic battlefield which we
kept trying to erect on the DMZ.
Notice I said "trying". Part of it
consisted of a chain of sixty-five
foot towers. (Technology is
beautiful, too, because it is so

realistic. Can you imagine yourself
in a sixty-five foot tower in
the middle of a battle? That is
about seventy feet in the wrong
direction!)
The trouble with the towers
was that they kept getting
blown-up, but nobody was every
quite sure who was doing it. All
that was known was that the
heavy wooden planks used to
build the towers kept finding their
way into Gl's bunkers. Again, the
technological concept of reality
was lacking.
Some wizzard at a desk
decided that it was more
important to use the available
material to build towers than to
give it to the front line troops
who needed it for their own
survival. That is not to say that
the Gls stole the towers, they
were simply re-ordering priorities.
Such has been the fate of all
technology that persists in
ignoring human priorities.
Undoubtedly, the finest
example of all took place on a
dark and dreary night in the
Republic of Viet Nam. There is a
type of night observation plane
equipped with a special heat (
sensor that can detect a human on
the ground by his body heat, and
one of these detected about two
hundred enemy moving on the
ground on that dark night.
Every B-52 mission in that
sector of Viet Nam was diverted
to this prime target. One hundred
and fifty million dollars worth of
B-52s dropped to hundred
thousand dollars worth of high
explosive on the target. The next
morning a ground patrol sent in to
investigate reported that the strike
had successfully wiped-out a large
herd of baboons.
Need I say more. Thank God
super plastic technology is such a
failure that it hasn't reached a
slaughterhouse efficiency, and if
you were trusting in it, watch out.

The credibility gap has struck
again. It's been made perfectly
clear to all of us that American
war technology is alive and well,
and growing more powerful,
sophisticated, and deadly every
day.
Nothing new about that, but
for some reason this issue has
pushed almost everyone into
'taking sides'. There are a great
many who strongly oppose the
war machine for moral or political
reasons, and there are certainly as
many again on the other side of
the fence who feel inclined to
support it on the basis of military
necessity.
It occurs to me that both sides,
to a certain extent, are treading
murky waters. First of all, most of
what we know about war
technology is clouded by the
standard governmental policy of
secret-keeping which always
manages to further entangle
popular misconceptions.
The government's fairy tales
about the effectiveness of war
technology are seldom
constructed with truth as their
function. Rather, they are
fabricated with the intentions of
pacifying one group or the other,
which ever one is most convenient
at the moment.
Fancy Technology
The next place where we've
missed the boat is in accepting the
effectiveness of technology
without question. The fact is that
no amount of fancy technology
will ever win a war when applied

by unwilling soldiers whose
vitality and will has been sapped
by a policy that is shot full of
contradiction and corruption.
Superior force has a long
history of being beaten by simple,
honest determination. Remeber
that ragged little army huddled at
Valley Forge that beat the most
powerful nation in the world.
That man who is crawling in the
mud must have a good cause, for
the cause has always beaten the
force, and I would like to suggest
that no amount of technology is
ever going to change that scheme
of things.
If you are worrying about the
campus recruitment of new talent
to bolster the war industries, go
ahead and get a little upset. It's
not worth getting ulcers over,
though, because the simple fact is
that most of what they make for
the war doesn't work.
Granted, naphalm and B-52s
kill and maim a lot of living
things. It's ugly to say, but it's
true that B-52s and naphalm are
old-hat. Certainly you didn't
think that anyone who was hired
by the war-related industries last
Monday was going to work on
B-525, and neither will anyone
who's hired next week or next
month.
Extravagant Fizzles
It is more likely that they will
be working on some extravagant
fizzle like the F-111, and if you
were getting up-tight about people
objecting to war industries then
its not worth you getting ulcers
either. Don't be awed into a
trusting security by the mystic
aura of super technology. For
what we spent on, and got out of,
the F-111, we might as well have
bought stock in a Chilean mining
company just before that
, government took them over.
But, alas, we have a real war; a
! playground for our toys. If you
i were a soldier on that playground
J you might wonder why you spent
i so much of your time guarding

the panecea-technology. After all,
the technology was carefully
devised so that when the enemy,
being only tin soldiers with
