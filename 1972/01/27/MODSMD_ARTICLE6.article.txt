# Turmoil Molding China
## 
### 
Prognosticating about the
People's Republic of China is, at
best, a risky proposition.
Nevertheless, it is clear that
Chinese politics are in a state of
complete upheaval for the second
time in just over five years and
that the Chinese government may
again induce social turmoil as a
major instrument aimed at
remolding Chinese society.
The new political turmoil,
which has yet to be acknowledged
by the government, bears little
resemblance to the 1966 Great
Proletarian Cultural Revolution
(GPCR). There are no Red Guards
(nor any Red Guard dissident or
underground publications), no
street battles, and no buildings
have been seized and sacked.
Newsmen and other foreigners
are able to travel to China—even
to some of her most remote
provinces—and they can see
nothing unusual. Mao Tsetung's
government, after a bitter 20-year
struggle, finally has won
acceptance in the United Nations,
and within the next two months
will host President Nixon, a man
whom it has branded a "war
criminal."
What is happening in China
today is far more subtle than the
turmoil that surrounded the
GPCR, which, above everything,
seemed to insure the role of the
army in domestic affairs for
generations to come.
Subtle Turmoil
Briefly stated, and perhaps
dangerously oversimplified, this is
what appears to be happening: the
Communist Party (CP) has split as
a result of a deadly ideological
struggle within an elite planning
body, the politburo. The victors
are now beginning to emerge and

flex their muscles: Mao and the
politicians allied with him have
decisively defeated the more
conservative army leaders.
Mao clearly is now in the
process of conducting a
stalinist-type purge of the army's
leadership. After this purge is
completed, the stage may well be
set for another cultural
revolution.
In rapid succession, Mao has
succeeded in purging his
constitutional heir and Minister of
Defense, Lin Piao; the army's
chief of staff, Huang Yung-sheng;
the airforce commander, Wu
Fa-hsien; the naval commissar;
and the military logistics chief. All
of these men, in addition to their
distinguished military ranks, held
extremely important positions on
the politburo.
As the situation now stands,
only nine of the 21 full members
of the politburo (as it was
composed during the summer of
1971) are still active.
One of these nine members is
85 years old; antoher is a military
commander who is rarely seen in
Peking. The only functioning
members of the politburo are
Mao, Chou En-Lai and an aide,
one soldier closely associated with
Chou, and Mrs. Mao and two
other cultural revolutionaries.

civilian and army government
officials have been visible (in
retrospect) since November, 1970,
if not before.
The first major sign to the
Chinese people that there had
been disagreements in the
leadership came in a July 1, 1971
joint editorial published by the
three leading Peking journals to
celebrate the Communist Party's
50th anniversary.
That editorial, reprinted in
English and distributed in Hong
Kong, demanded the exposure of
"the few bourgeois conspirators,
careerist renegades and enemy
agents who have concealed
themselves in the party, and the
hidden traitors who have illicit
relations with foreign countries."
This passage, it should be
noted, could apply to two of
Peking's top leaders. Lin spent
four years in Russia early in his
career. Since then, his foreign
connections have been minimal.
Chou, on the other hand, is the
man who, on Mao's orders (or so
he says), masterminded the
"honeymoon co-existence" with
the United States and who has
many foreign connections.
However, at least up until now,
his position has never seriously
been questioned, and Chou
remains as powerful as ever.

why did Mao and the army fight?
One reason for the split was
Mao's growing resentment of the
army's increased importance in
the wake of the GPCE. The
army's power, always strong in the
politburo, became even stronger
at the provincial level: 20 of 29
provincial party committees are
headed by active nilitary officers,
and of the 20, ten are local
military commanders.
Of the 158 provincial party
secretaries listed recently in the
Chinese press, 93 are soldiers.
(One might note that all of these
men are prime candidates to be
purged from their positions.)
Also, according to the Chinese
press, the army has shown great
willingness to receive President
Nixon and looks with favor on
China's growing international
prestige.
Mao apparently thought the
army was being overly optimistic
and was losing some of its
revolutionary fervor. In late
October, one army unit in Kiangsi
province reported it had relaxed
its training program because it saw
"an excellent side of the
situation."
Further Insight
A newspaper article published
in Peking in March
commemorating the Paris
Commune of 1871 may hold
some other insights into the
question.
The basic thesis of the article
was that unless 'the people'
control the army, the interests of
the peasants and workers will be
sold out to the exploitative
classes.
There was one very important
passage. Ostensibly an attack on
the Russian government, it
condemned soldiers who claim
that "armed struggle and civil war
are accompanied by collossal
sacrifices and sufferings on the
part of the masses of the people,
by destruction of the productive
forces and by the annihilation of
the best revolutionary cadres."
A recent issue of "Red Flag"
carried an article citing Mao's
statement that without
revolutions and revolutionary
wars, "it is impossible to
accomplish any leap in social
development."
"The people want to make
revolution," the magazine
continued.
Thus was born the debate over
"making revolution." The army,
whose recent efforts have been
aimed at straightening out China's
society and her economy after the
GPCR, came under strong attack
for emphasizing the societal and
economic costs a new cultural
revolution would bring.
This seems to indicate that
China's Communist Party split
over a very basic question: does
China's leadership dare begin a
second cultural revolution? Mao
and Chou, who despite their
advanced ages are more firmly in
power than ever, apparently desire
such a revolution; local army units
in at least one region recently
were instructed to "prepare the
conditions for the transition to
communism."
The China watchers are waiting
for new developments. Few are
willing to flatly predict that there
will soon be another cultural
revolution, but speculation is now
beginning to increase. Only time
will tell exactly how the politburo
has decided to continue the
process of restructuring Chinese
society.
