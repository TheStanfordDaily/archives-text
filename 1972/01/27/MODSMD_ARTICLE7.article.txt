Exactly what they are planning
for China is anyone's guess. But
how the situation came to pass is
a complex and fascinating story,
and one which probably will not
be known in its entirety for years
to come.
Cast of Characters
The major characters in China's
recent political struggles are these:
-Mao Tsetung is chairman of
the Communist Party of China
He has been in power for some 36
years as the party's unrivalred
ideological inspiration. A staunch
internationalist, he works within
China to unleash the innate
willingness of the lower classes to
"make revolution" after suitable
political education.
In the past, Mao has
encountered serious opposition
from the army, the party, and the
governmental bureaucracy for his
campaigns for collectivism, the
Great Leap Forward, the Socialist
Education Campaign and the
GPCR.
—Chou En-lai is China's prime
minister. He has great national
popularity, is a strong
administrator and has an
outstanding reputation as a
diplomat. He is disliked by
left-wing elements for his
practical, pragmatic attitudes
towards problems and for his
ability to shift positions to suit
the prevailing political conditions.
—Lin Piao (condition and/or
whereabouts unknwon) was vice
chairman of the Communist Party
and Minister of Defense. He was
also Mao's constitutionally
provided heir to the CP
chairmanship.
Lin's main duties were to
ensure that the army remained
loyal to Mao while carrying out its
political assignments and to
rebuild the CP after the GPCR. He
commanded great respect among
both the soldiers and the radicals
for his military abilities.
—Huang Yung-sheng (condition
and/or whereabouts unknown)
was chief of the army's general
staff. He had close ties to much of
the army's senior command and
was responsible for the day-to-day
operations of the armed forces.
—Chen Po-ta (who has been
denounced as a "false Marxist"
and who has not been seen in
public since Aug. 1, 1970) was
Mao's secretary and had served as
editor of the CP's principal
magazine, "Red Flag." He was
idolized by China's leftists and
was responsible for running much
of the GPCR. His denunciation
apparently signaled a final death
knell for the GPCR.
Signs of a major split between

The first indications of internal
feuding to attract the attention of
the world's press was the sudden
cessation of aircraft flights over
China in late September. At that
time, many theories, few of them
substantive, were advanced: the
Chinese were preparing to test a
new missle; Mao had died; the
Russians were planning an
invasion; there had been a major
border clash between China and
Russia, etc.
Western observers now believe
that Lin, Huang and airforce
commander Wu were either shot
down or simply crashed while
trying to flee China (in a Trident
jet), possibly after an abortive
attempt on Mao's life but more
probably after a series of major
political and ideological
disagreements.
[One London newspaper, The
Observer, reported from Moscow
last week that Soviet pathologists
have definitely identified two of
the bullet-riddled bodies from the
downed plane as those of Lin and
his wife.]
Loopholes
The airplane crash theory is
not without its loopholes. The
Chinese government had many
options for "disposing" of the
army leaders: there could have
been a routine aviation
"accident"; the men could have
been publicly disgraced, as were
Chen Po-ta and numerous other
former leaders; the Russians could
have been blamed for shooting
down the plane, etc. Any of
these excuses could have
effectively hidden the military
' officers' abortive coup, if indeed
there was such an attempt.
To further complicate the
matter, a recent issue of "China
Pictorial" shows Lin, Huang and
Wu alive and well and retaining
their party positions. This would
seem to indicate a political rather
than a physical death.
However, it is clear that the
"correct line" now being pushed
in Peking is that the military men
intended to overthrow and/or kill
Mao and that their plot was foiled
at the last minute.
The first sign of the emerging
"line" was contained in a recent
"Red Flag" article that
denounced "a few emperors,
princes, generals, ministers, sages
and prophets .. . who tried to
reverse the wheel of history." The
article then quoted one of Mao's
poems, "Mayflies lightly plot to
topple the Giant Tree" a
traditional Chinese reference to
those who attempt to over-extend
themselves.
One major question remains:
Exactly what they are planning
for China is anyone's guess. But
how the situation came to pass is

these excuses could have
effectively hidden the military
' officers' abortive coup, if indeed
there was such an attempt.
To further complicate the
matter, a recent issue of "China
Pictorial" shows Lin, Huang and
Wu alive and well and retaining
their party positions. This would
seem to indicate a political rather
than a physical death.
However, it is clear that the
"correct line" now being pushed
in Peking is that the military men
intended to overthrow and/or kill
Mao and that their plot was foiled
at the last minute.
The first sign of the emerging
"line" was contained in a recent
"Red Flag" article that
denounced "a few emperors,
princes, generals, ministers, sages
and prophets .. . who tried to
reverse the wheel of history." The
article then quoted one of Mao's
poems, "Mayflies lightly plot to
topple the Giant Tree" a
traditional Chinese reference to
those who attempt to over-extend
themselves.
One major question remains:
Exactly what they are planning
for China is anyone's guess. But
how the situation came to pass is
a complex and fascinating story,
and one which probably will not
be known in its entirety for years
to come.
Cast of Characters
The major characters in China's
recent political struggles are these:
-Mao Tsetung is chairman of
the Communist Party of China
He has been in power for some 36
years as the party's unrivalred
ideological inspiration. A staunch
internationalist, he works within
China to unleash the innate
willingness of the lower classes to
"make revolution" after suitable
political education.
In the past, Mao has
encountered serious opposition
from the army, the party, and the
governmental bureaucracy for his
campaigns for collectivism, the
Great Leap Forward, the Socialist
Education Campaign and the
GPCR.
—Chou En-lai is China's prime
minister. He has great national
popularity, is a strong
administrator and has an
outstanding reputation as a
diplomat. He is disliked by
left-wing elements for his
practical, pragmatic attitudes
towards problems and for his
ability to shift positions to suit
the prevailing political conditions.
—Lin Piao (condition and/or
whereabouts unknwon) was vice
chairman of the Communist Party
and Minister of Defense. He was
also Mao's constitutionally
provided heir to the CP
chairmanship.
Lin's main duties were to
ensure that the army remained
loyal to Mao while carrying out its
political assignments and to
rebuild the CP after the GPCR. He
commanded great respect among
both the soldiers and the radicals
for his military abilities.
—Huang Yung-sheng (condition
and/or whereabouts unknown)
was chief of the army's general
staff. He had close ties to much of
the army's senior command and
was responsible for the day-to-day
operations of the armed forces.
—Chen Po-ta (who has been
denounced as a "false Marxist"
and who has not been seen in
public since Aug. 1, 1970) was
Mao's secretary and had served as
editor of the CP's principal
magazine, "Red Flag." He was
idolized by China's leftists and
was responsible for running much
of the GPCR. His denunciation
apparently signaled a final death
knell for the GPCR.
Signs of a major split between

The first indications of internal
feuding to attract the attention of
the world's press was the sudden
cessation of aircraft flights over
China in late September. At that
time, many theories, few of them
substantive, were advanced: the
Chinese were preparing to test a
new missle; Mao had died; the
Russians were planning an
invasion; there had been a major
border clash between China and
Russia, etc.
Western observers now believe
that Lin, Huang and airforce
commander Wu were either shot
down or simply crashed while
trying to flee China (in a Trident
jet), possibly after an abortive
attempt on Mao's life but more
probably after a series of major
political and ideological
disagreements.
[One London newspaper, The
Observer, reported from Moscow
last week that Soviet pathologists
have definitely identified two of
the bullet-riddled bodies from the
downed plane as those of Lin and
his wife.]
Loopholes
The airplane crash theory is
not without its loopholes. The
Chinese government had many
options for "disposing" of the
army leaders: there could have
been a routine aviation
"accident"; the men could have
been publicly disgraced, as were
Chen Po-ta and numerous other
former leaders; the Russians could
have been blamed for shooting
down the plane, etc. Any of
these excuses could have
effectively hidden the military
' officers' abortive coup, if indeed
there was such an attempt.

Russians were planning an
invasion; there had been a major
border clash between China and
Russia, etc.
Western observers now believe
that Lin, Huang and airforce
commander Wu were either shot
down or simply crashed while
trying to flee China (in a Trident
jet), possibly after an abortive
attempt on Mao's life but more
probably after a series of major
political and ideological
disagreements.
[One London newspaper, The
Observer, reported from Moscow
last week that Soviet pathologists
have definitely identified two of
the bullet-riddled bodies from the
downed plane as those of Lin and
his wife.]
Loopholes
The airplane crash theory is
not without its loopholes. The
Chinese government had many
options for "disposing" of the
army leaders: there could have
been a routine aviation
"accident"; the men could have
been publicly disgraced, as were
Chen Po-ta and numerous other
former leaders; the Russians could
have been blamed for shooting
down the plane, etc. Any of
these excuses could have
effectively hidden the military
' officers' abortive coup, if indeed
there was such an attempt.
To further complicate the
matter, a recent issue of "China
Pictorial" shows Lin, Huang and
Wu alive and well and retaining
their party positions. This would
seem to indicate a political rather
than a physical death.
However, it is clear that the
"correct line" now being pushed
in Peking is that the military men
intended to overthrow and/or kill
Mao and that their plot was foiled
at the last minute.
The first sign of the emerging
"line" was contained in a recent
"Red Flag" article that
denounced "a few emperors,
princes, generals, ministers, sages
and prophets .. . who tried to
reverse the wheel of history." The
article then quoted one of Mao's
poems, "Mayflies lightly plot to
topple the Giant Tree" a
traditional Chinese reference to
those who attempt to over-extend
themselves.
One major question remains:
