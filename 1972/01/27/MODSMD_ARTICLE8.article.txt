Editor, THE DAILY:
Your NLRB story on
Wednesday, Jan. 26, left the
wrong impression with many staff
members. You reported that "The
CSEA's recommendations were
followed ... while proposals by
the other unions were rejected.
The election will probably be held
in the next month."
You failed to stress that the
recommendations were about who
should vote — not which unions
can be voted for. USE will be on
any ballot of Stanford workers.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I phoned the health center
yesterday to make an
appointment with a gynecologist
and discovered that the first
available appointment was
February 14th, almost three
weeks away.
Although 3100 women attend
Stanford and are entitled to
health center services, Cowell sees
fit to employ just one
gynecologist! To make things
worse, the gynecologist is only on
duty half time.
It is appalling that a university
which prides itself on
"progTessiveness" should be so
remiss in providing adequate
health care for its female students.
