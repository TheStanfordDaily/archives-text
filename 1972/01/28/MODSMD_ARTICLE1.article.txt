# University Stiffens Penalty For ASSU Fee Deferment
## 
### PATTY FELS 
Some 800 students, for various
reasons, didn't pay the mandatory $3
ASSU fee last spring quarter, leaving
the University with a $2,400 deficit
and some stringent new penalties for
delinquent payments.
Objections to the ASSU fee are
nothing new. Bill Stone, assistant to
the President, said recently, "Three to
six people each quarter have raised this
question. Usually they're graduates
who weren't at Stanford as
undergrads."
The ASSU fee is assessed on
students by a student referendum and
added to the tuition.
The unusual situation last spring
quarter was the size of the deficit.
Before determining whether everyone
had paid the ASSU fee assessment, the
University transferred $3 for each
registered student to ASSU. Having
discovered 800 students had not paid
the fee, the University said that the
ASSU owed it the unpaid amount,
$2,400. The ASSU refused to pay the
amount, claiming that the University
was responsible for fee collection.
The $3 fee that quarter included $1
to the ASSU, $1 to the Daily and $1
to the ASSU Special Events Board.
A meeting between Joseph Jedd,
Student Accounting Manager; Chuck
Peterson, ASSU representative; and
the University Accounting Officer,
Mrs. Maureen Buma was held last
summer to settle the dispute, and a
consensus was reached, beginning last
fall quarter, deferment charges were to
be placed on any unpaid amount,
inclusive of ASSU fees.

Unfortunately, scholarships and
grants don't cover the ASSU fee. Many
of the students with delinquent
accounts spring quarter had assumed
that their scholarships included the fee
and were unaware that they still owed
money. Most of these students did pay
after they were informed of their $3
debts.
But several deliberately refused to
pay spring quarter; more refused in the
fall. Some objected to compulsory
membership in an organization with
which they disagreed. Others,
including overseas and absentee
students, felt that since they weren't
enjoying the services that the ASSU
fee covered, that they should not have
to pay.
According to the ASSU
Constitution, all students are
automatically members of the ASSU
and, consequently, must pay all ASSU
fees.
Two years ago, students defeated a
referendum that would have made the
ASSU a voluntary organization. The
vote was closer than many people
expected, 2,171 for a voluntary group,
2,868 against.
In last year's election for ASSU
president, Chris Hocker and Robin
Friedman running on a platform of
abolishing student government and the
ASSU lost by only 200 votes (out of
4,000 cast) to the current Council of
Presidents.
Also last spring, while assessing
themselves special fees for the Band,
KZSU and the Daily, students voted
no assessment to go directly to the
ASSU.

Since all fees collected through the
ASSU cover local campus
organizations, many students paying
tuition but not attending the main
Palo Alto campus are often reluctant
to pay the fees.
According to ASSU Financial
Manager Tom Huseby, there are no
mechanisms in the registration
procedure to distinguish between local
students and students elsewhere. He
admits that there might be a way to
refund the money to those students
not at Palo Alto but thinks that most
