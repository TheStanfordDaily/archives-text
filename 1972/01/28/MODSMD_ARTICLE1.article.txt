# University Stiffens Penalty For ASSU Fee Deferment
## 
### PATTY FELS 
Some 800 students, for various
reasons, didn't pay the mandatory $3
ASSU fee last spring quarter, leaving
the University with a $2,400 deficit
and some stringent new penalties for
delinquent payments.
Objections to the ASSU fee are
nothing new. Bill Stone, assistant to
the President, said recently, "Three to
six people each quarter have raised this
question. Usually they're graduates
who weren't at Stanford as
undergrads."
The ASSU fee is assessed on
students by a student referendum and
added to the tuition.
The unusual situation last spring
quarter was the size of the deficit.
Before determining whether everyone
had paid the ASSU fee assessment, the
University transferred $3 for each
registered student to ASSU. Having
discovered 800 students had not paid
the fee, the University said that the
ASSU owed it the unpaid amount,
$2,400. The ASSU refused to pay the
amount, claiming that the University
was responsible for fee collection.
The $3 fee that quarter included $1
to the ASSU, $1 to the Daily and $1
to the ASSU Special Events Board.
A meeting between Joseph Jedd,
Student Accounting Manager; Chuck
Peterson, ASSU representative; and
the University Accounting Officer,
Mrs. Maureen Buma was held last
summer to settle the dispute, and a
consensus was reached, beginning last
fall quarter, deferment charges were to
be placed on any unpaid amount,
inclusive of ASSU fees.

Unfortunately, scholarships and
grants don't cover the ASSU fee. Many
of the students with delinquent
accounts spring quarter had assumed
that their scholarships included the fee
and were unaware that they still owed
money. Most of these students did pay
after they were informed of their $3
debts.
But several deliberately refused to
pay spring quarter; more refused in the
fall. Some objected to compulsory
membership in an organization with
which they disagreed. Others,
including overseas and absentee
students, felt that since they weren't
enjoying the services that the ASSU
fee covered, that they should not have
to pay.
According to the ASSU
Constitution, all students are
automatically members of the ASSU
and, consequently, must pay all ASSU
fees.
Two years ago, students defeated a
referendum that would have made the
ASSU a voluntary organization. The
vote was closer than many people
expected, 2,171 for a voluntary group,
2,868 against.
In last year's election for ASSU
president, Chris Hocker and Robin
Friedman running on a platform of
abolishing student government and the
ASSU lost by only 200 votes (out of
4,000 cast) to the current Council of
Presidents.
Also last spring, while assessing
themselves special fees for the Band,
KZSU and the Daily, students voted
no assessment to go directly to the
ASSU.

Since all fees collected through the
ASSU cover local campus
organizations, many students paying
tuition but not attending the main
Palo Alto campus are often reluctant
to pay the fees.
According to ASSU Financial
Manager Tom Huseby, there are no
mechanisms in the registration
procedure to distinguish between local
students and students elsewhere. He
admits that there might be a way to
refund the money to those students
not at Palo Alto but thinks that most
fees will benefit the students upon
their return.
Bill Stone, a former associate dean
of students, dislikes complaints by
off-campus students regarding the
unfairness of the fee. He said, "I'm
impatient with those kinds of
arguments." Stone feels that the
students should either vote down
assessments or try to amend the
constitution to make membership in
the ASSU voluntary. This would
require a two-thirds majority vote by
the student body.
Huseby feels that a voluntary
student government would be a
"cleaner association" but says it would
"lack economic efficiency."
Neil Robblee is one of several law
students who have refused to pay the
fee. He and the others are participants
in the law school's operational training
program in Washington, D.C. Robblee
registered in absentia this fall and paid
his full tuition bill — minus the ASSU
fee. A few weeks late; he received a
bill for the fee, plus a $35 finance
charge.
In a letter to Jedd, Robblee
complained his finance charge
amounted to 3,600 percent interest on
his late account. He wrote, "I do not
see how Stanford in good conscience
could charge its students this much
interest."
The letter goes on: "I strongly
suggest that you reassess Stanford's
policy of charging students late fees of
this magnitude. These fees may or may
not come under the strict letter of
California's usury statute, but they
certainly violate its spirit."

Jedd answered him, "The
deferment conditions printed on your
bill which was sent to you and which
clearly specifies what charges accrue
on delinquent amounts is enclosed for
your information. When you remitted
your check .. . you were fully aware
of these conditions. The fact that you
are away from the campus . . . does
not relieve you of the ASSU fees
according to their regulations."
Explaining the large finance charge,
Jedd said that "the imposition of
'holds' is a rather strenuous and
expensive procedure and certainly
costs the University more than $3."
Graduate Thomas Seitz objects to
the fees as a matter of principle. Seitz
is an individualist/anarchist who
doesn't support any government. Since
fall, 1970, he has paid no ASSU fees
and now owes $16. Like Robblee,
Seitz now cannot register until he
pays.
Seitz calls the assessments a
"rip-off." He said, "I'll pay for the
services I want. I won't pay because
some referendum says I have to. I
don't think that special interest groups
should force students to subsidize
them when they don't want their
services."
Ombudswoman Lois Amsterdam and
Jedd have both advocated the same
course of action for Seitz—to change
the constitution through a student
referendum. Jedd has also offered to
waive any late charges. At this time
Seitz is unsure of whether he will try
thts or simply pay the fees.
So far the accounting office has
been lenient in the collection of the
unpaid fees. Jedd said that he has tried

to avoid charging the late fee in cases
where the student was unaware that he
had not paid.
No Other Choice
Regarding the uncollected ASSU
debt he said, "We would like to submit
the fees to ASSU as we collect them
but they object so we have no other
choice than to do it the old way."
Starting last quarter, all students
signed a deferment form which states
clearly the finance charge on unpaid
bills. If payment is made by the first
due date, the charge is $1 per each
hundred with a $5 minimum. If
payment is made between the first and
final due dates, the charge is $2 on
each 100 with a $10 minimum charge.
If any deferred amount remains
unpaid after the final due date a late
charge of $20 is imposed and the
student cannot register for any
subsequent quarter until both finance
charges and late charges have been
paid.
"Anyone who reads this can clearly
see what he will be subject to. It's no
surprise," Jedd pointed out.
The University has also launched
"an all-out collection campaign to
clear all the past due accounts." A
letter stating that the University has
"engaged two outside collection
agencies" has been sent to those with
outstanding debts.
So there it stands. The students
refuse to pay the fees; the University
refuses to let them register until they
do. And those involved tend to
become cynical. Says Jedd sadly:
"From this office it's easy to develop
the attitude that everyone's a crook."
