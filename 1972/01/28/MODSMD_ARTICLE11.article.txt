## Franklin—The Scientists View 
### 
Scientists and technologists
have traditionally been apolitical,
perhaps because throughout
history science has served the
interests of power.
Until the industrial revolution
the engyncour, the man of
ingenuity, was of only two kinds:
military—producing engines of
war, or civil—designing palaces for
popes and princes. There has been
little change in this relationship
since.
As scientists and technologists
we observe the Franklin dismissal
from this special class position.
But we are also trained to deal
with objective facts. We suggest
that behind all the subjective
legalisms concerning the limits of
first amendment rights and the
duties of professors lies an
objective and basic conflict.

A conflict which the advisory
board itself remarks upon: the
world view of Bruce Franklin is
widely at odds with that of most
faculty members. It is evident that
were this not so Bruce Franklin
would be teaching at Stanford
today.
We can ask ourselves the
question: which of these two
world views is more socially
desirable in the sense of reflecting
limits and conflicts in the real
political world, and the degree to
which it reflects a humane set of
moral values.
The two world views
represented can be summarized
succintly. The dominant view of
the faculty is one which considers
that western civilization has been
an unalloyed benefit for the rest
of the world; that universities are

the prime repositories for the
essence of that civilization; that
some errors in priority or tactics
may have been made to be sure,
but that with these corrected the
United States can lead the rest of
the world on to enlightenment.
The opposing world view, on the
other hand sees the United States
as the last metropole of a series of
imperialist episodes by which
Europeans have maintained
domination over the rest of the
world. Without overthrowing such
domination there is no hope of
the Third World countries ever
achieving a humane and free social
situation.
This condition of domination
is mirrored within the United
States, with an affluent white
minority oppressing and
exploiting the vast majority of the
people, and using racism to divide
the people being exploited.
In this view the universities
also play a key role, in training
the elite, the technicians of
Empire, and in creating an
intelligentsia which will reproduce
the required mythology.
In choosing between these two
views we are much aided by the
experience of the last ten years,
where the acts of several
successive U.S. administrations
have exposed the insanity of
trying to impose the former view.
There are also technical
arguments: the Western World has
already consumed most of the
resources necessary for the
process of industrialization in the
Third World.
And yet the policy of the
advanced industrial countries,
explicated by their schools of
science, engineering and business
administration is to continue the
exponential growth of these rates
of consumption. Such policies wili
ensure another generation of
conflict between the white
minority and the rest of the
world.
We are of the opinion that of
the two modes of behavior the

first is Bruce Franklin attempting
to bring his world views to
attention from a position of
powerlessness, and the second, the
rest of the faculty imposing their
world view from a position of
power. It is the latter which is
more dangerous to our self
interest and which is most in
conflict with the true needs of the

some scientists at slac

people of the world.
It will be a long struggle, but
Stanford must be rehabilitated.
