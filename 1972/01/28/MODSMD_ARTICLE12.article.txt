# Participate In Existing Mechanisms
## 
### 
Everyone has been talking and
writing and complaining about the
history of the powerlessness of
students within the University
governance system. Instead of
repeating all of that, I only
acknowledge that it is true,
especially in light of the events at
Stanford this year.
What I do want to bring to your
attention now is what exactly is in
existence, paltry as it is, in which
students can participate dealing
with decisions in the University
machine. You have heard this over
and over again, but I must

staff members. To this date, with
an extension of another week, we
have received only two
applications for this committee.
Are you not interested in
whether your room and board
rates go up? Or are you willing to
let the Board of Trustees decide
that students must pay more to
live in a small room with very few
services and not very good food?
At this point I am inclined to
think so.
There is a new committee,
which was instituted by the
Academic Senate. It is called the

tQWuyjwii

emphasize here that there are
some things available for student
input.
Perhaps the most important at
this time is the openings on a
committee called the "Dean of
Students Task Force on Room
and Board Rates". This
committee will, by the end of
next month, decide whether or
not it would recommend that
room and board rates go up,
services go down, people lose jobs,
food service is decreased, and/or
certain houses in the dorm system
be changed to better serve the
needs of students in terms of
saving money.
There are six positions. They
have been advertised in Once
Around The Quad. They have
been advertised through letters
sent to house officers or residence

"Committee on the
Professoriate". It will deal with the
general question of tenure—not
specific cases, but the general
ideas of what tenure is all about.
This has been announced in Once
Around the Quad. There has been
an article in Letters to the Editor
by Ann Kimball specifically on
this committee. We have to date,
one application for this
committee.
Where are all of the people
who are so concerned about why
some professors are not granted
tenure, even though they may be
excellent teachers? Where are all
the students who want to have a
voice in how tenure is granted? At
this point I am inclined to think
that they do not exist.
Finally within the general
committee structure, there are

positions open on the
"Committee on ROTC Affairs".
We have received many
applications from students who
were in ROTC, are in ROTC,
think that ROTC should have a
place within the university
community.
But where are the people who
demonstrated against ROTC two
years ago? Where are the people
who do not think that ROTC
should be on campus?
I'll probably get a lot of hell
for saying the following and I'm
ready for the phone calls now.
What it is: I'm ready to put those
people on that committee who do
think that ROTC should be on
campus simply for the reason that
I don't think that any other idea
exists on this campus at this point
in time. That ROTC should be on
campus should be represented on
the committee. But where are you
that think it should not?
If you'll think back to the fall
of your freshman year, you will
remember a program called
Freshman Orientation. Perhaps in
your year, it was a week long.
This year it was only a weekend
long. Time here is of no
importance. The content is. For
the past two weeks we have put
out a call for Freshman and
Transfer Orientation Chairman.
To date we have received two
applications.
If you don't care about what
the freshmen are told about
Stanford University before they
start classes, the program will be
taken over by the Dean of
Students Office out of necessity.
And the freshmen will be told,
somehow, that they are apolitical
and apathetic, just as they were
somehow told this year.
If the stimulation isn't there

from the rest of the students to
create in freshmen and transfers
the idea that learning doesn't
wholly and completely come from
the classroom and from the
books, then the rest of the
students are responsible for
helping create the feeling of
apathy.
I am trying to urge you to
apply to positions that will have a
great impact on students and on
the University. If you are
interested, and have patience with
the bureaucratic jungle of the
University, come to the ASSU
office, get an application and bug
the hell out of us until we appoint
someone to the committees
mentioned above.
If you really do care, if you are
really serious about the degree of
involvement that students ought
to have within the University
decision-making process, then
where are you?

Presidents)

"Committee on ROTC Affairs".
We have received many
applications from students who
were in ROTC, are in ROTC,
think that ROTC should have a
place within the university
community.
But where are the people who
demonstrated against ROTC two
years ago? Where are the people
who do not think that ROTC
should be on campus?
I'll probably get a lot of hell
for saying the following and I'm
ready for the phone calls now.
What it is: I'm ready to put those
people on that committee who do
think that ROTC should be on
campus simply for the reason that
I don't think that any other idea
exists on this campus at this point
in time. That ROTC should be on
campus should be represented on
the committee. But where are you
that think it should not?
If you'll think back to the fall
of your freshman year, you will
remember a program called
Freshman Orientation. Perhaps in
your year, it was a week long.
This year it was only a weekend
long. Time here is of no
importance. The content is. For
the past two weeks we have put
out a call for Freshman and
Transfer Orientation Chairman.
To date we have received two
applications.
If you don't care about what
the freshmen are told about
Stanford University before they
start classes, the program will be
taken over by the Dean of
Students Office out of necessity.
And the freshmen will be told,
somehow, that they are apolitical
and apathetic, just as they were
somehow told this year.
If the stimulation isn't there

from the rest of the students to
create in freshmen and transfers
the idea that learning doesn't
wholly and completely come from
the classroom and from the
books, then the rest of the
students are responsible for
helping create the feeling of
apathy.
I am trying to urge you to
apply to positions that will have a
great impact on students and on
the University. If you are
interested, and have patience with
the bureaucratic jungle of the
University, come to the ASSU
office, get an application and bug
the hell out of us until we appoint
someone to the committees
mentioned above.
If you really do care, if you are
really serious about the degree of
involvement that students ought
to have within the University
decision-making process, then
where are you?
(Diane Fields for the Council of
Presidents)
Everyone has been talking and
writing and complaining about the
history of the powerlessness of
students within the University
governance system. Instead of
repeating all of that, I only
acknowledge that it is true,
especially in light of the events at
Stanford this year.
What I do want to bring to your
attention now is what exactly is in
existence, paltry as it is, in which
students can participate dealing
with decisions in the University
machine. You have heard this over
and over again, but I must

staff members. To this date, with
an extension of another week, we
have received only two
applications for this committee.
Are you not interested in
whether your room and board
rates go up? Or are you willing to
let the Board of Trustees decide
that students must pay more to
live in a small room with very few
services and not very good food?
At this point I am inclined to
think so.
There is a new committee,
which was instituted by the
Academic Senate. It is called the

tQWuyjwii

emphasize here that there are
some things available for student
input.
Perhaps the most important at
this time is the openings on a
committee called the "Dean of
Students Task Force on Room
and Board Rates". This
committee will, by the end of
next month, decide whether or
not it would recommend that
room and board rates go up,
services go down, people lose jobs,
food service is decreased, and/or
certain houses in the dorm system
be changed to better serve the
needs of students in terms of
saving money.
There are six positions. They
have been advertised in Once
Around The Quad. They have
been advertised through letters
sent to house officers or residence

"Committee on the
Professoriate". It will deal with the
general question of tenure—not
specific cases, but the general
ideas of what tenure is all about.
This has been announced in Once
Around the Quad. There has been
an article in Letters to the Editor
by Ann Kimball specifically on
this committee. We have to date,
one application for this
committee.
Where are all of the people
who are so concerned about why
some professors are not granted
tenure, even though they may be
excellent teachers? Where are all
the students who want to have a
voice in how tenure is granted? At
this point I am inclined to think
that they do not exist.
