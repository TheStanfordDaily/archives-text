Spicer
Editor, THE DAILY:
In a short statement at the
Daniel Ellsberg convocation I
commented that Professor Spicer
was engaged in DoD night vision
research. Both in the Daily and in
Volume 1 of the SWOPSI report
Dr. Spicer claimed his research has
"no connection" with military
night vision research.
However, Volume 2 of the
SWOPSI report pointed out that
Spicer's work was funded under
DoD night vision allocations, that
the DoD officially contended it
was directly related to night vision
research, and that one of Spicer's
papers concerning the project had
been presented at an
Army-sponsored conference on
advances relating to night vision.
During a conversation with

Stanton Glantz, co-author of the
SWOPSI report, it was pointed
out that my comment referring to
Spicer's work was not entirely
accurate in that Dr. Spicer's work
does not deal in existing night
vision technologies and hence
cannot properly be termed
"research in night vision."
Rather it should be termed
research which has more than a
slight chance of being applied in
military night vision devices as
both the Department of Defense
and Dr. Spicer know. In the
interests of accuracy I present this
semantic correction.

Illogical
Editor, THE DAILY:
Joanne Johnson's article, "Fire

Shockley, Not Franl' in,"
illustrates that the Third World
can be as illogical and
authoritarian as the establishment.
Johnson writes, "Bruce is the one
who should stay and Shockley the
one who should go. Third World
people on this campus and off
intend to work towards this
effort."
I admire neither Franklin's nor
Shockley's philosophies. But in
the interests of academic freedom
and free speech, both should be
allowed to teach at Stanford.
Let each individual decide for
himself the validity of both
professor's political theories.
Don't deal with men and women
who espouse unpopular doctrines
by sweeping them out the door.
