AN OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT LYMAN:
It is clear to me that one can reasonably view the events of the past
several days as the direct result of your irrecouncilable, somewhat
apocryphal administrative policies.
In reference to the placement center question, it was the position
of your administration that students should not have the right to
determine the policies of the university. One of the reasons you
posited for your stand was based on a view of the university as an
institution where decision-making must be an integrated process,
because ultimately all decisions affect the nature of the entire
institution.
This is the same answer and line of reasoning you gave Black
Students when they demanded that you let them determine many of
the educational and social questions which affected them on the
campus. In fact, it was the same answer you gave any group which
wanted to control that part of the institution which most directly
affected them.
Yet you have systematically excluded a large constituency of this
community from participating in any meaningful manner whatsoever,
in perhaps one of the most significant decisions in this institution's
history. Students are very much concerned and are directly affected
by which professors are allowed to teach here and which are not. But
at no point did you involve students in the question of Bruce
Franklin.
I feel that your policies have placed the community in a crisis
situation. Because you did not allow students to participate in any
legitimate manner in the decision making process, and further
restricted their freedom of expression by instituting an automatic
policy against non-violent sit-ins, it seems that you are encouraging
students to seek "other" means to make known their dissatisfaction.
I do not feel that this is the time for moral outcries over one
broken window; I do feel however, it is time that our community
made an attempt to get togehter to discuss how students can make a
difference within this institution.
And if the administration again proves it is unwilling to allow
students real participation within the running of this institution, then
I am afraid the administration will have to greatly expand their
program of "beating" sense into the heads of their students by force
to keep up with the demand.
