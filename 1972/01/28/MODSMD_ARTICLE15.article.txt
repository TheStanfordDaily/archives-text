# protocol or violence?
## Pittendrigh's Rational Dialogue 
### 
Now that Bruce Franklin has
been officially fired, I find it well
to remember the Stanford professor
who first called publicly for
Franklin's dismissal on the basis
of the Lodge incident alone,
Professor Colin S. Pittendrigh of
the Medical School and the
Human Biology Program. (See
Daily editorial, January 29,
1971.) I was one of 400 students
enrolled in Human Bio I last
Spring who heard Pittendrigh
defend his position in a discussion
period on April 9, 1971:
"I oppose all the things that
Mr. Franklin opposes. But I'm not
as stupid as Mr. Franklin. . . . The
stupidity of Franklin is that he
thinks he can lick this great
massive system which we all
dislike by throwing a few rocks
through windows and hurling
some obscenities at Mr. Lyman.
He's just stupid! (a voice from the
audience protested, "He doesn't
believe that," but Pittendrigh
quickly spoke over him, using the
microphone: "No, no; he also
wants to destroy the university
and that's why I'm opposed to
him.") Pittendrigh continued:
". . .people aren't to be blamed
for their stupidity. But when
people advocate the substitution
of physical force for discourse,
they become incompatible with
the nature of the university in my
view...."
". . .And Franklin, explicitly,
deliberately, as well as implicitly,
has participated in and advocated
violence, and that's why I oppose
him. . . . There is the distinction
between rational discourse and

the resort to violence that's at
stake. And there are institutions
of society that use violence. The
university is not supposed to."
(Meyer Audio Library)
A few days after the above
comments were made, Human
Biology I was back to normal.
Professor Pittendrigh's abhorence
of force, coercion, and violence
was forgotten in effect as he
prepared the class for the
upcoming midterm:
"And you had better know the
difference between mitiosis and
meiosis, and you had better know
it backwards and forwards, for I
assure you that that will be one of
the questions on your midterm!"
He nodded gravely toward the
students, letting his warning fall
hard. All over the lecture hall
special note was taken of mitosis
and meiosis—notebooks were
scribbled in, underlined, and
starred. Students bent their heads
in unison to mark down the
pertinent hint, and a silent prayer
of thanks was sent up for the good
professor's benevolence.

However, the girl seated to my
right had fallen behind in her
frantic attempt to record every
precious word, every droplet of
spittle, etc., and she looked up at
me, terror-stricken.
"What did he say?", she
pleaded.
The desperation in her face
appalled me. I thought for a
moment and replied: "I think he
said that the basic nature of this
university is non violence."
Automatically she started to
mark down letters, then stopped.
Her face screwed up. "What?"
"He said there are institutions
of society that use violence, but
the university is not supposed to."
It looked for a moment like
she would cry. Instead she
blurted, "Damn it, do you want
me to flunk?"
"No, but there's the distinction
between rational discourse and
the resort to violence that's at
stake."
Flustered, she turned away and
tried to copy off her neightbor,
but she couldn't see because of

Jeff wright

the person's arm. Panic set in as
she realized she was falling further
and further behind. Her breathing
became very short, like a rabbit
cornered, and she moved her pen
as fast as possible, as if digging a
hole for protection. But it was no
use; she was only a little cilia
flaggelating against a vast sea of
words. From the stage Professor
Pittendrigh continued to spew
forth a barrage of lecture,
oblivious or insensitive to his own
coercive, violent effect.
Finally, the poor girl slammed
her pen down, and closed her
eyes. After a long pause she spoke
softly:
"What's happening to me?
What does he mean by 'violence'
anyway?"
"It's violence, see, " "I tried to
console her, "when we do it to
them. But it's protocol, rational
discourse, and appropriate
function when they do it to us."
"Oh," she whimpered, and at
last she started to cry.

Finally, the poor girl slammed
her pen down, and closed her
eyes. After a long pause she spoke
softly:
"What's happening to me?
What does he mean by 'violence'
anyway?"
"It's violence, see, " "I tried to
console her, "when we do it to
them. But it's protocol, rational
discourse, and appropriate
function when they do it to us."
"Oh," she whimpered, and at
last she started to cry.

Now that Bruce Franklin has
been officially fired, I find it well
to remember the Stanford professor
who first called publicly for
Franklin's dismissal on the basis
of the Lodge incident alone,
Professor Colin S. Pittendrigh of
the Medical School and the
Human Biology Program. (See
Daily editorial, January 29,
1971.) I was one of 400 students
enrolled in Human Bio I last
Spring who heard Pittendrigh
defend his position in a discussion
period on April 9, 1971:
"I oppose all the things that
Mr. Franklin opposes. But I'm not
as stupid as Mr. Franklin. . . . The
stupidity of Franklin is that he
thinks he can lick this great
massive system which we all
dislike by throwing a few rocks
through windows and hurling
some obscenities at Mr. Lyman.
He's just stupid! (a voice from the
audience protested, "He doesn't
believe that," but Pittendrigh
quickly spoke over him, using the
microphone: "No, no; he also
wants to destroy the university
and that's why I'm opposed to
him.") Pittendrigh continued:
". . .people aren't to be blamed
for their stupidity. But when
people advocate the substitution
of physical force for discourse,
they become incompatible with
the nature of the university in my
view...."
". . .And Franklin, explicitly,
deliberately, as well as implicitly,
has participated in and advocated
violence, and that's why I oppose
him. . . . There is the distinction
between rational discourse and

the resort to violence that's at
stake. And there are institutions
of society that use violence. The
university is not supposed to."
(Meyer Audio Library)
A few days after the above
comments were made, Human
Biology I was back to normal.
Professor Pittendrigh's abhorence
of force, coercion, and violence
was forgotten in effect as he
prepared the class for the
upcoming midterm:
"And you had better know the
difference between mitiosis and
meiosis, and you had better know
it backwards and forwards, for I
assure you that that will be one of
the questions on your midterm!"
He nodded gravely toward the
students, letting his warning fall
hard. All over the lecture hall
special note was taken of mitosis
and meiosis—notebooks were
scribbled in, underlined, and
starred. Students bent their heads
in unison to mark down the
pertinent hint, and a silent prayer
of thanks was sent up for the good
professor's benevolence.

However, the girl seated to my
right had fallen behind in her
frantic attempt to record every
precious word, every droplet of
spittle, etc., and she looked up at
me, terror-stricken.
"What did he say?", she
pleaded.
The desperation in her face
appalled me. I thought for a
moment and replied: "I think he
said that the basic nature of this
university is non violence."
Automatically she started to
mark down letters, then stopped.
Her face screwed up. "What?"
"He said there are institutions
of society that use violence, but
the university is not supposed to."
It looked for a moment like
she would cry. Instead she
blurted, "Damn it, do you want
me to flunk?"
"No, but there's the distinction
between rational discourse and
the resort to violence that's at
stake."
Flustered, she turned away and
tried to copy off her neightbor,
but she couldn't see because of

Jeff wright

the person's arm. Panic set in as
she realized she was falling further
and further behind. Her breathing
became very short, like a rabbit
cornered, and she moved her pen
as fast as possible, as if digging a
hole for protection. But it was no
use; she was only a little cilia
flaggelating against a vast sea of
words. From the stage Professor
Pittendrigh continued to spew
forth a barrage of lecture,
oblivious or insensitive to his own
coercive, violent effect.
Finally, the poor girl slammed
her pen down, and closed her
eyes. After a long pause she spoke
softly:
"What's happening to me?
What does he mean by 'violence'
