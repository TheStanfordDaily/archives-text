The Beatles Revisited: The Sum is
Greater than the Parts
It's been over two and a half
years since the Beatles last
recorded together—long enough so
that the individual members have
had the chance to show the world
their talents as solo performers.
The verdict is just about in, and
unfortunately it's not too
favorable.
John Lennon, in his
book-length interview with
Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner,
remarked that the Beatles as a
group ceased to function after
"Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts
Club Band," that after that record
it was "John with the boys, Paul
with the boys, and so forth." If
that was true, then we would
imagine that the four's individual
performances would not be
radically different from"The
Beatles," "Let It Be," and
"Abbey Road," the last three
group records. But such is not the
case.
First, we should examine the
output of the erstwhile "Fab
Four:"
John Lennon has come out
with two solo albums ("John
Lennon/Pastic Ono Band" and
"Imagine") and five singles
("Power to the People," "Happy
Christmas," "Imagine,"
"Mother," and "Instant Karma"),
plus an album and two singles
under the name "Plastic Ono
Band."
Paul McCartney has put out

three albums under three different
"names." "McCartney" was
officially by Paul McCartney,
"Ram" by Paul and Linda, and
"Wild Life" by Wings. Somehow,
they all get referred to as "Paul
McCartney's album," which is just
as well. In addition, he has two
singles, "Another Day"and
"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey."
George Harrison, often the
forgotten man of the Beatles, has
released two three-record sets,
"All Things Must Pass" and the
live "George Harrison and Friends
Concert for Bangla Desh." This in
addition to singles of "What Is
Life," "My Sweet Lord," and an
unsuccessful studio version of
"Bangla Desh."
Ringo, whose interests lie
outside music, has one album,
"Beaucoups of Blues," and a
Harrison-produced single, "It
Don't Come Easy.
The Beatles as a group reached
the point where they were
virtually immune to flops. The
Phil Spector-produced single from
"Let It Be," "The Long and
Winding Road," just possibly the
worst record the Beatles ever put
out, with its sickly-sweet,
out-of-place strings, still was a
massive hit, and on most charts
held the top position as long or
longer than the single version of
"Let It Be."
Individual Failures
But the Beatles individually
have had their share of failures.
Few people knew that Lennon
had released "Mother" as a single;
even fewer have ever heard the
studio version of "Bangla Desh."
And "Another Day"and "What Is
Life," while moderately popular,
were certainly not killers.
But it is on the ill bums, not the
singles, that the disparity really
shows between group and
individual. "Ram" and "Imagine,"
done by the supposed "giants" of
the group, are both poor albums.
Of the two, "Ram" is the worst:
it is not just bad, it is
monumentally insignificant with
not a single outstanding cut. And
"Imagine," while having some
excellent material such as the title
cut, is downright silly in a couple
of places. "Crippled Inside" and
"How Do You Sleep" are both
ridiculous distribcs directed at
McCartney. I mean, I've heard of
airing your dirty linen in public
before, but "Ooohhhh, how do
you sleep?" Absurd! As if Paul's
conscience should be bothering
him.
Of the four, Harrison is
perhaps the only one who has
improved musically on his own
from the group days. "All Things
Must Pass" has sold more records
than any of the other Beatles' solo
efforts, and with good reason. The
title song is a beautiful
transcendental ballad that

compares more than favorably
with the best work of McCartney,
and other songs on the album,
plus the live Bangla Desh benefit
set, have impressively presented
his credentials as a solid rocker
What, then, was the mystique,
or what have you, that made the
Beatles a greater entity than the
sum of their parts? What it all
boils down to, I think, is that the
Beatles had a system of checks
and balances for each other.
Lennon could control
McCartney's tendency to be
sticky-sweet and superficial,
McCartney could control
Lennon's occasional
extravagances, and Harrison,
although seldom heard from,
added his own special brand to
the Beatles records. And although
for the last three years of their
existence they were four separate
individuals on the same record,
they were four times better than
four separate artists on four
different records.

Singles l n' Things
The current singles scene
depends heavily 011 cuts culled
from already-existing albums, as a
quick look at the latest charts will
illustrate. Best of the lot are Elton
John's "Levon" (UNI) and Van
Morrison.'., "Tupelo Honey"
(Warners). "Levon" is perhaps
John's finest single to date, the
story of the American Dream as
seen by the "madman across the

water," while "Tupelo Honey" is
the recorded-in-San Francisco title
tune of Morrison's latest album.
"American Pie," Don McLean's
ode to Buddy Holly, remains at
the top of the charts almost four
months after its release. Also
beginning to get some airplay off
of the "American Pie" lp (United
Artists) is "Vincent," a ballad
about Vincent Van Gogh.
Grand Funk Railroad is trying
to break the singles charts with
the perfectly awful "Foot
Stompin' Music" (Capitol). It's
nice to know the group can do
something perfectly. Their
contract with Capitol has expired,
and they are reportedly shopping
around for a new label that has $8
million to give them. Don't hold
your breath.
Carole King has two cuts off
her "Music" album doing well,
"It's Gonna Take Some Time"
and "Sweet Seasons," and while
Three Dog Night has the latest in
a seemingly interminable string of
hits with "Never Been To Spain"
(Dunhill).
The New Seekers made a hit
out of their Coke commercial
with "I'd Like to Teach the World
to Sing (In Perfect Harmony)"
(Elektra). It sounds like it was
written by an ad company
executive, which it was. Steer
clear.
Childish Innuendoes
More to steer clear of:
"Precious and Few" by Climax,
which is a direct steal from the

Association's "Cherish;" "Brand
New Key," by Melanie, with its
childish sexual innuendoes; and
Led Zeppelin's "Black Dog."
Two excellent new releases not
yet on the charts that have been
taken from forthcoming albums
are Neil Young's "Heart of Cold"
(Reprise) and Paul Simon's
"Mother and Child Reunion"
(Columbia). Young's "Harvest" lp
is due sometime around February
15; Simon's "Paul Simon" is due
out momentarily but has not
appeared yet on the stands,
classified ads taken out by the
Record Store notwithstanding.
An oddity on the charts is Joe
Cocker's "Feelin' Alright,"
(A&M) which originally appeared
on his first American album, "Joe
Cocker," several years ago. His
version is as good or better than
Traffic's great original.
Soul is well represented on the
pop charts, with Joe Simon's
"Drowning in a Sea of Love," a
Gamble-Huff production, one of
the best. Also Gamble-Huff:
Wilson Pickett's "Fire and Water"
(Atlantic). But the top soul song
is Al Green's fine "Let's Stay
Together" (Hi/London).
Lastly, and perhaps leastly, the
Bee Gees are back with their own
peculiar brand of limp-wristed
rock. This time, they perpetrate
"My World" (ATCO), which isn't
even as good as "How Can You
Mend a Broken Heart," which was
as bad as the title indicates.

conscience should be bothering
him.
Of the four, Harrison is
perhaps the only one who has
improved musically on his own
from the group days. "All Things
Must Pass" has sold more records
than any of the other Beatles' solo
efforts, and with good reason. The
title song is a beautiful
transcendental ballad that

compares more than favorably
with the best work of McCartney,
and other songs on the album,
plus the live Bangla Desh benefit
set, have impressively presented
his credentials as a solid rocker
What, then, was the mystique,
or what have you, that made the
Beatles a greater entity than the
sum of their parts? What it all
boils down to, I think, is that the
Beatles had a system of checks
and balances for each other.
Lennon could control
McCartney's tendency to be
sticky-sweet and superficial,
McCartney could control
Lennon's occasional
extravagances, and Harrison,
although seldom heard from,
added his own special brand to
the Beatles records. And although
for the last three years of their
existence they were four separate
individuals on the same record,
they were four times better than
four separate artists on four
different records.

Singles l n' Things
The current singles scene
depends heavily 011 cuts culled
from already-existing albums, as a
quick look at the latest charts will
illustrate. Best of the lot are Elton
John's "Levon" (UNI) and Van
Morrison.'., "Tupelo Honey"
(Warners). "Levon" is perhaps
John's finest single to date, the
story of the American Dream as
seen by the "madman across the

water," while "Tupelo Honey" is
the recorded-in-San Francisco title
tune of Morrison's latest album.
"American Pie," Don McLean's
ode to Buddy Holly, remains at
the top of the charts almost four
months after its release. Also
beginning to get some airplay off
of the "American Pie" lp (United
Artists) is "Vincent," a ballad
about Vincent Van Gogh.
Grand Funk Railroad is trying
to break the singles charts with
the perfectly awful "Foot
Stompin' Music" (Capitol). It's
nice to know the group can do
something perfectly. Their
contract with Capitol has expired,
and they are reportedly shopping
around for a new label that has $8
million to give them. Don't hold
your breath.
Carole King has two cuts off
her "Music" album doing well,
"It's Gonna Take Some Time"
and "Sweet Seasons," and while
Three Dog Night has the latest in
a seemingly interminable string of
hits with "Never Been To Spain"
(Dunhill).
The New Seekers made a hit
out of their Coke commercial
with "I'd Like to Teach the World
to Sing (In Perfect Harmony)"
(Elektra). It sounds like it was
written by an ad company
executive, which it was. Steer
clear.
Childish Innuendoes
More to steer clear of:
"Precious and Few" by Climax,
which is a direct steal from the

Association's "Cherish;" "Brand
New Key," by Melanie, with its
childish sexual innuendoes; and
Led Zeppelin's "Black Dog."
Two excellent new releases not
yet on the charts that have been
taken from forthcoming albums
are Neil Young's "Heart of Cold"
(Reprise) and Paul Simon's
"Mother and Child Reunion"
(Columbia). Young's "Harvest" lp
is due sometime around February
15; Simon's "Paul Simon" is due
out momentarily but has not
appeared yet on the stands,
classified ads taken out by the
Record Store notwithstanding.
An oddity on the charts is Joe
Cocker's "Feelin' Alright,"
(A&M) which originally appeared
on his first American album, "Joe
Cocker," several years ago. His
version is as good or better than
Traffic's great original.
Soul is well represented on the
pop charts, with Joe Simon's
"Drowning in a Sea of Love," a
Gamble-Huff production, one of
the best. Also Gamble-Huff:
Wilson Pickett's "Fire and Water"
(Atlantic). But the top soul song
is Al Green's fine "Let's Stay
Together" (Hi/London).
Lastly, and perhaps leastly, the
Bee Gees are back with their own
peculiar brand of limp-wristed
rock. This time, they perpetrate
"My World" (ATCO), which isn't
even as good as "How Can You
Mend a Broken Heart," which was
as bad as the title indicates.

The Beatles Revisited: The Sum is
Greater than the Parts
It's been over two and a half
years since the Beatles last
recorded together—long enough so
that the individual members have
had the chance to show the world
their talents as solo performers.
The verdict is just about in, and
unfortunately it's not too
favorable.
John Lennon, in his
book-length interview with
Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner,
remarked that the Beatles as a
group ceased to function after
"Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts
Club Band," that after that record
it was "John with the boys, Paul
with the boys, and so forth." If
that was true, then we would
imagine that the four's individual
performances would not be
radically different from"The
Beatles," "Let It Be," and
"Abbey Road," the last three
group records. But such is not the
case.
First, we should examine the
output of the erstwhile "Fab
Four:"
John Lennon has come out
with two solo albums ("John
Lennon/Pastic Ono Band" and
"Imagine") and five singles
("Power to the People," "Happy
Christmas," "Imagine,"
"Mother," and "Instant Karma"),
plus an album and two singles
under the name "Plastic Ono
Band."
Paul McCartney has put out

three albums under three different
"names." "McCartney" was
officially by Paul McCartney,
"Ram" by Paul and Linda, and
"Wild Life" by Wings. Somehow,
they all get referred to as "Paul
McCartney's album," which is just
as well. In addition, he has two
singles, "Another Day"and
"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey."
George Harrison, often the
forgotten man of the Beatles, has
released two three-record sets,
"All Things Must Pass" and the
live "George Harrison and Friends
Concert for Bangla Desh." This in
addition to singles of "What Is
Life," "My Sweet Lord," and an
unsuccessful studio version of
"Bangla Desh."
Ringo, whose interests lie
outside music, has one album,
"Beaucoups of Blues," and a
Harrison-produced single, "It
Don't Come Easy.
The Beatles as a group reached
the point where they were
virtually immune to flops. The
Phil Spector-produced single from
"Let It Be," "The Long and
Winding Road," just possibly the
worst record the Beatles ever put
out, with its sickly-sweet,
out-of-place strings, still was a
massive hit, and on most charts
held the top position as long or
longer than the single version of
"Let It Be."
Individual Failures
But the Beatles individually
have had their share of failures.
Few people knew that Lennon
had released "Mother" as a single;
even fewer have ever heard the
studio version of "Bangla Desh."
And "Another Day"and "What Is
Life," while moderately popular,
were certainly not killers.
But it is on the ill bums, not the
singles, that the disparity really
shows between group and
individual. "Ram" and "Imagine,"
done by the supposed "giants" of
the group, are both poor albums.
Of the two, "Ram" is the worst:
it is not just bad, it is
monumentally insignificant with
not a single outstanding cut. And
"Imagine," while having some
excellent material such as the title
cut, is downright silly in a couple
of places. "Crippled Inside" and
"How Do You Sleep" are both
ridiculous distribcs directed at
McCartney. I mean, I've heard of
airing your dirty linen in public
before, but "Ooohhhh, how do
you sleep?" Absurd! As if Paul's
conscience should be bothering
him.
Of the four, Harrison is
perhaps the only one who has
improved musically on his own
from the group days. "All Things
Must Pass" has sold more records
than any of the other Beatles' solo
efforts, and with good reason. The
title song is a beautiful
transcendental ballad that

compares more than favorably

and other songs on the album,

his credentials as a solid rocker

An oddity on the charts is Joe
Cocker's "Feelin' Alright,"
(A&M) which originally appeared
on his first American album, "Joe
Cocker," several years ago. His
version is as good or better than
Traffic's great original.
Soul is well represented on the
pop charts, with Joe Simon's
"Drowning in a Sea of Love," a
Gamble-Huff production, one of
the best. Also Gamble-Huff:
Wilson Pickett's "Fire and Water"
(Atlantic). But the top soul song
is Al Green's fine "Let's Stay
Together" (Hi/London).
Lastly, and perhaps leastly, the
Bee Gees are back with their own
peculiar brand of limp-wristed
rock. This time, they perpetrate
"My World" (ATCO), which isn't
even as good as "How Can You
Mend a Broken Heart," which was
as bad as the title indicates.

The Beatles Revisited: The Sum is
Greater than the Parts
It's been over two and a half
years since the Beatles last
recorded together—long enough so
that the individual members have
had the chance to show the world
their talents as solo performers.
The verdict is just about in, and
unfortunately it's not too
favorable.
John Lennon, in his
book-length interview with
Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner,
remarked that the Beatles as a
group ceased to function after
"Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts
Club Band," that after that record
it was "John with the boys, Paul
with the boys, and so forth." If
that was true, then we would
imagine that the four's individual
performances would not be
radically different from"The
Beatles," "Let It Be," and
"Abbey Road," the last three
group records. But such is not the
case.
First, we should examine the
output of the erstwhile "Fab
Four:"
John Lennon has come out
with two solo albums ("John
Lennon/Pastic Ono Band" and
"Imagine") and five singles
("Power to the People," "Happy
Christmas," "Imagine,"
"Mother," and "Instant Karma"),
plus an album and two singles
under the name "Plastic Ono
Band."
Paul McCartney has put out

three albums under three different
"names." "McCartney" was
officially by Paul McCartney,
"Ram" by Paul and Linda, and
"Wild Life" by Wings. Somehow,
they all get referred to as "Paul
McCartney's album," which is just
as well. In addition, he has two
singles, "Another Day"and
"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey."
George Harrison, often the
forgotten man of the Beatles, has
released two three-record sets,
"All Things Must Pass" and the
live "George Harrison and Friends
Concert for Bangla Desh." This in
addition to singles of "What Is
Life," "My Sweet Lord," and an
unsuccessful studio version of
"Bangla Desh."
Ringo, whose interests lie
outside music, has one album,
"Beaucoups of Blues," and a
Harrison-produced single, "It
Don't Come Easy.
The Beatles as a group reached
the point where they were
virtually immune to flops. The
Phil Spector-produced single from
"Let It Be," "The Long and
Winding Road," just possibly the
worst record the Beatles ever put
out, with its sickly-sweet,
out-of-place strings, still was a
massive hit, and on most charts
held the top position as long or
longer than the single version of
"Let It Be."
Individual Failures
But the Beatles individually
have had their share of failures.
Few people knew that Lennon
had released "Mother" as a single;
even fewer have ever heard the
studio version of "Bangla Desh."
And "Another Day"and "What Is
Life," while moderately popular,
were certainly not killers.
But it is on the ill bums, not the
singles, that the disparity really
shows between group and
individual. "Ram" and "Imagine,"
done by the supposed "giants" of
the group, are both poor albums.
Of the two, "Ram" is the worst:
it is not just bad, it is
monumentally insignificant with
not a single outstanding cut. And
"Imagine," while having some
excellent material such as the title
cut, is downright silly in a couple
of places. "Crippled Inside" and
"How Do You Sleep" are both
ridiculous distribcs directed at
McCartney. I mean, I've heard of
airing your dirty linen in public
before, but "Ooohhhh, how do
you sleep?" Absurd! As if Paul's
conscience should be bothering
him.
Of the four, Harrison is
perhaps the only one who has
improved musically on his own
from the group days. "All Things
Must Pass" has sold more records
than any of the other Beatles' solo
efforts, and with good reason. The
title song is a beautiful
transcendental ballad that

compares more than favorably
with the best work of McCartney,
and other songs on the album,
plus the live Bangla Desh benefit
set, have impressively presented
his credentials as a solid rocker
What, then, was the mystique,
or what have you, that made the
Beatles a greater entity than the
sum of their parts? What it all
boils down to, I think, is that the
Beatles had a system of checks
and balances for each other.
Lennon could control
McCartney's tendency to be
sticky-sweet and superficial,
McCartney could control
Lennon's occasional
extravagances, and Harrison,
although seldom heard from,
added his own special brand to
the Beatles records. And although
for the last three years of their
existence they were four separate
individuals on the same record,
they were four times better than
four separate artists on four
different records.
-RICH JAROSLOVSKY
Singles l n' Things
The current singles scene
depends heavily 011 cuts culled
from already-existing albums, as a
quick look at the latest charts will
illustrate. Best of the lot are Elton
John's "Levon" (UNI) and Van
Morrison.'., "Tupelo Honey"
(Warners). "Levon" is perhaps
John's finest single to date, the
story of the American Dream as
seen by the "madman across the

water," while "Tupelo Honey" is
the recorded-in-San Francisco title
tune of Morrison's latest album.
"American Pie," Don McLean's
ode to Buddy Holly, remains at
the top of the charts almost four
months after its release. Also
beginning to get some airplay off
of the "American Pie" lp (United
Artists) is "Vincent," a ballad
about Vincent Van Gogh.
Grand Funk Railroad is trying
to break the singles charts with
the perfectly awful "Foot
Stompin' Music" (Capitol). It's
nice to know the group can do
something perfectly. Their
contract with Capitol has expired,
and they are reportedly shopping
around for a new label that has $8
million to give them. Don't hold
your breath.
Carole King has two cuts off
her "Music" album doing well,
"It's Gonna Take Some Time"
and "Sweet Seasons," and while
Three Dog Night has the latest in
a seemingly interminable string of
hits with "Never Been To Spain"
(Dunhill).
The New Seekers made a hit
out of their Coke commercial
with "I'd Like to Teach the World
to Sing (In Perfect Harmony)"
(Elektra). It sounds like it was
written by an ad company
executive, which it was. Steer
clear.
Childish Innuendoes
More to steer clear of:
"Precious and Few" by Climax,
which is a direct steal from the

Association's "Cherish;" "Brand
New Key," by Melanie, with its
childish sexual innuendoes; and
Led Zeppelin's "Black Dog."
Two excellent new releases not
yet on the charts that have been
taken from forthcoming albums
are Neil Young's "Heart of Cold"
(Reprise) and Paul Simon's
"Mother and Child Reunion"
(Columbia). Young's "Harvest" lp
is due sometime around February
15; Simon's "Paul Simon" is due
out momentarily but has not
appeared yet on the stands,
classified ads taken out by the
Record Store notwithstanding.
An oddity on the charts is Joe
Cocker's "Feelin' Alright,"
(A&M) which originally appeared
on his first American album, "Joe

version is as good or better than
Traffic's great original.

released two three-record sets,
"All Things Must Pass" and the
live "George Harrison and Friends
Concert for Bangla Desh." This in
addition to singles of "What Is
Life," "My Sweet Lord," and an
unsuccessful studio version of
"Bangla Desh."
Ringo, whose interests lie
outside music, has one album,
"Beaucoups of Blues," and a
Harrison-produced single, "It
Don't Come Easy.
The Beatles as a group reached
the point where they were
virtually immune to flops. The
Phil Spector-produced single from
"Let It Be," "The Long and
Winding Road," just possibly the
worst record the Beatles ever put
out, with its sickly-sweet,
out-of-place strings, still was a
massive hit, and on most charts
held the top position as long or
longer than the single version of
"Let It Be."
Individual Failures
But the Beatles individually
have had their share of failures.
Few people knew that Lennon
had released "Mother" as a single;
even fewer have ever heard the
studio version of "Bangla Desh."
And "Another Day"and "What Is
Life," while moderately popular,
were certainly not killers.
But it is on the ill bums, not the
singles, that the disparity really
shows between group and
individual. "Ram" and "Imagine,"
done by the supposed "giants" of
the group, are both poor albums.
Of the two, "Ram" is the worst:
it is not just bad, it is
monumentally insignificant with
not a single outstanding cut. And
"Imagine," while having some
excellent material such as the title
cut, is downright silly in a couple
of places. "Crippled Inside" and
"How Do You Sleep" are both
ridiculous distribcs directed at
McCartney. I mean, I've heard of
airing your dirty linen in public
before, but "Ooohhhh, how do
you sleep?" Absurd! As if Paul's
conscience should be bothering
him.
Of the four, Harrison is
perhaps the only one who has
improved musically on his own
from the group days. "All Things
Must Pass" has sold more records
than any of the other Beatles' solo
efforts, and with good reason. The
title song is a beautiful
transcendental ballad that

compares more than favorably
with the best work of McCartney,
and other songs on the album,
plus the live Bangla Desh benefit
set, have impressively presented
his credentials as a solid rocker
What, then, was the mystique,
or what have you, that made the
Beatles a greater entity than the
sum of their parts? What it all
boils down to, I think, is that the
Beatles had a system of checks
and balances for each other.
Lennon could control
McCartney's tendency to be
sticky-sweet and superficial,
McCartney could control
Lennon's occasional
extravagances, and Harrison,
although seldom heard from,
added his own special brand to
the Beatles records. And although
for the last three years of their
existence they were four separate
individuals on the same record,
they were four times better than
four separate artists on four
different records.

Singles l n' Things
The current singles scene
depends heavily 011 cuts culled
from already-existing albums, as a
quick look at the latest charts will
illustrate. Best of the lot are Elton
John's "Levon" (UNI) and Van
Morrison.'., "Tupelo Honey"
(Warners). "Levon" is perhaps
John's finest single to date, the
story of the American Dream as
seen by the "madman across the

water," while "Tupelo Honey" is
the recorded-in-San Francisco title
tune of Morrison's latest album.
"American Pie," Don McLean's
ode to Buddy Holly, remains at
the top of the charts almost four
months after its release. Also
beginning to get some airplay off
of the "American Pie" lp (United
Artists) is "Vincent," a ballad
about Vincent Van Gogh.
Grand Funk Railroad is trying
to break the singles charts with
the perfectly awful "Foot
Stompin' Music" (Capitol). It's
nice to know the group can do
something perfectly. Their
contract with Capitol has expired,
and they are reportedly shopping
around for a new label that has $8
million to give them. Don't hold
your breath.
Carole King has two cuts off
her "Music" album doing well,
"It's Gonna Take Some Time"
and "Sweet Seasons," and while
Three Dog Night has the latest in
a seemingly interminable string of
hits with "Never Been To Spain"
(Dunhill).
The New Seekers made a hit
out of their Coke commercial
with "I'd Like to Teach the World
to Sing (In Perfect Harmony)"
(Elektra). It sounds like it was
written by an ad company
executive, which it was. Steer
clear.
Childish Innuendoes
More to steer clear of:
"Precious and Few" by Climax,
which is a direct steal from the

Association's "Cherish;" "Brand
New Key," by Melanie, with its
childish sexual innuendoes; and
Led Zeppelin's "Black Dog."
Two excellent new releases not
yet on the charts that have been
taken from forthcoming albums
are Neil Young's "Heart of Cold"
(Reprise) and Paul Simon's
"Mother and Child Reunion"
(Columbia). Young's "Harvest" lp
is due sometime around February
15; Simon's "Paul Simon" is due
out momentarily but has not
appeared yet on the stands,
classified ads taken out by the
Record Store notwithstanding.
An oddity on the charts is Joe
Cocker's "Feelin' Alright,"
(A&M) which originally appeared
on his first American album, "Joe
Cocker," several years ago. His
version is as good or better than
Traffic's great original.
Soul is well represented on the
pop charts, with Joe Simon's
"Drowning in a Sea of Love," a
Gamble-Huff production, one of
the best. Also Gamble-Huff:
Wilson Pickett's "Fire and Water"
(Atlantic). But the top soul song
is Al Green's fine "Let's Stay
Together" (Hi/London).
Lastly, and perhaps leastly, the
Bee Gees are back with their own
peculiar brand of limp-wristed
rock. This time, they perpetrate
"My World" (ATCO), which isn't
even as good as "How Can You
Mend a Broken Heart," which was
as bad as the title indicates.

The Beatles Revisited: The Sum is
Greater than the Parts
It's been over two and a half
years since the Beatles last
recorded together—long enough so
that the individual members have
had the chance to show the world
their talents as solo performers.
The verdict is just about in, and
unfortunately it's not too
favorable.
John Lennon, in his
book-length interview with
Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner,
remarked that the Beatles as a
group ceased to function after
"Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts
Club Band," that after that record
it was "John with the boys, Paul
with the boys, and so forth." If
that was true, then we would
imagine that the four's individual
performances would not be
radically different from"The
Beatles," "Let It Be," and
"Abbey Road," the last three
group records. But such is not the
case.
First, we should examine the
output of the erstwhile "Fab
Four:"
John Lennon has come out
with two solo albums ("John
Lennon/Pastic Ono Band" and
"Imagine") and five singles
("Power to the People," "Happy
Christmas," "Imagine,"
"Mother," and "Instant Karma"),
plus an album and two singles
under the name "Plastic Ono
Band."
Paul McCartney has put out

three albums under three different
"names." "McCartney" was
officially by Paul McCartney,
"Ram" by Paul and Linda, and
"Wild Life" by Wings. Somehow,
they all get referred to as "Paul
McCartney's album," which is just
as well. In addition, he has two
singles, "Another Day"and
"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey."
George Harrison, often the
forgotten man of the Beatles, has
released two three-record sets,
"All Things Must Pass" and the
live "George Harrison and Friends
Concert for Bangla Desh." This in
addition to singles of "What Is
Life," "My Sweet Lord," and an
unsuccessful studio version of
"Bangla Desh."
Ringo, whose interests lie
outside music, has one album,
"Beaucoups of Blues," and a
Harrison-produced single, "It
Don't Come Easy.
