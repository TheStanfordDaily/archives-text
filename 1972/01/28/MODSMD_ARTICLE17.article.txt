# New McClure Plays Are A Bit Absurd
## 
### DOUG ARTHUR 
Michael McClure has three new
plays, none of which can measure
up to his "The Beard." Entitled
"Polymorphous Pirates," the
works have special effects looted
from various productions and
material that should have been
thrown overboard; this booty is
hardly worth the effort (however
little) that went into obtaining it.
The title implies that there is
some connection among the three
plays, but I can't imagine one.
"The Button" finds three
salacious youngsters satirizing the
adult world; "The Pussy" is an
accursed, cursory account of the
barbarism of the Vietnam War;
"The Feather" appears to be a
delightfully lewd futuristic drama.
With this selection, perhaps a
better title would be "Amorphous
Pirates."
The plays have just opened at
Berkeley's Magic Theatre, and
while magic can often produce
something out of nothing, this
production was an empty bag of
tricks. The third play was the
semi-redeeeming factor of the
evening, probably because the two
earlier plays, although ridiculous,
were still heavier than "The
Feather."
The Magic Theatre is a small
theatre, perhaps seating 100,
which has been converted from a
storeroom. The stage cuts
diagonally across one corner of
the room so that the audience
faces it on two sides. The jagged
stage juts out in places and is
raised about two feet from the
floor. Two levels distinguished the
locales for the first two plays.
Erotic Games
A child's bedroom, with
oversized furniture and a
conspicuous bed, locates the
action for "The Button." In it,
three children parody the erotic
games of their parents. The
childish voices of the actors were
too exaggerated, as were the
imitations of the adult
conversations, although these did
provide most of the humor
Director John Lion fearlessly
directed this tripe and the stage
action often surpassed the
embarrasing lack of material.
When the children mount the bed

for the obligatory sex scene, the
Berkeley audience seemed to
wake up. In short, it was a
technically slick production of
puerile inanities, and when the
children, playing wolves, climbed
to the top of the set for a howling
conclusion, I had to restrain
myself from joining in.
"The Pussy" is an exhausting
little piece of pretension that
concerns two American soldiers,
named Zack and Mack, who are
both on smack in order to survive
the flash bombs and neat light
effects of Carla Blumberg and
Lorraine Pool. Indeed, the play
was a series of mundane special
effects (bomb blasts, fires on
stage, nude girls, intriguing sex
acts, etc.) that had no special
effect. The dialogue, which
consisted almost exclusively of
obscenities tossed off by the
soldiers against each other, was
delivered at a uniform volume:
that of a hesitant shout.
Sordid Quagmire
Looking at the bones and
carnage on the desolate black
stage, I could see the basis for a
significant play: one that would
deal with the immense human
destruction in that sordid, little
quagmire. But this play was a
conglomeration of spectacular
effects with no core to unify
them. The language, the nudity,
the violence did not relate to any
dramatic concept.
When the black soldier kills the
white one at the conclusion, it is a
gratuitous act, as is the image of a
carnivorous dinosaur. We don't
need McClure to give us more
images of barbarism, but rather
dramatic action that can
accommodate those terrible
images.
Steven Browne and
Christopher Brooks as the soldiers
brought whatever human interest
the production contained; it was
certainly not in the play. The
sense of ennui and ultimate
futility in their portrayals clarified
the action of an obscure work.
"The Feather" is a delectable
futuristic play that tries vainly to
arouse prurient interest in a bunch
of geometric shapes: a pyramid,
cylinder, sphere and cube. Charles
Goldman is the pyramid of show

biz technique when he attempts
to raise the spectators, a fluffy,
black tentacle, a feather, and
assorted idiot shapes, from their
place in a blue, foam-rubber trap.
Vivid Colors
The set consisted of aluminum
stalactites and stalagmites backed
by black curtains. Against this
background, the vivid colors of
the "characters" brought a certain
verve to the piece. Perhaps this
play succeeded, where the others
didn't, because it acknowledged
its source in the absurd, and could
then proceed on its own terms.
A daffy band of rock musicians
(Knights of the Living Dead)
alternated their parodies of classic
and popular tones (mostly played
at about half the normal tempo)
with self-congratulation. The
band, consisting of saxophone,
clarinet, piano, trombone,
percussion, violin, flute and bass,
was probably the most important

element in identifying the action
on stage.
Particularly ribald was the
stripper music when the sphere,
played by zany Peggy Browne, did
her act—it was a show stopper.
Any show about geometric forms
has a big strike against it. It's just
another case of forms without
content.
This is the fifth season for the
Magic Theatre, a full-time,
professional resident theatre
company, and their first season in
their new home. Subsidized partly
by the National Foundation of
the Arts, the company has
produced more than forty plays,
most of these by European
absurdists. The company
concentrates on producing new
plays, and, it seems, new absurd
plays. While it is always admirable
for a company to produce new
plays, the practice can be carried
beyond limits (ad absurdum?)
