# At In Your Ear
## Hutcherson Sets Minds Free 
### MARC BARMAN 
It's been four months since
Bobby Hutcherson's last
appearance in Palo Alto. And as
typical of Bobby's artistry, he
keeps changing for the better.
He moved into In Your Ear last
weekend with a new group and a
new instrument, and set a lot of
minds free.
His new group consists of
James Leary on bass, Mike Carter
on drums, and the young and
continually exciting Todd
Cochran on piano and electric
piano. Like any Hutcherson
group, they sound like they've
been playing together for years.
Solid, together, and with an
intuitive feel for what each other
is about to do.
New Electrovisor
Instead of his traditional vibes,
Bobby brought Deagan's new
ElactraVibe (an electric
vibraphone) and a big Deagan
marimba. He's just dangerous,
that's all. Fast as ever (which is
impossibly fast), maybe even

faster (more impossible yet). And
now he'll switch from one
instrument to another at sixty
miles an hour, and never drop a
note. He'll even play both at once.
And when he's not playing, he's
dancing around with a
tambourine, singing, or
what-have-you. The man never
stops.
The reason that a live
performance beats a recording
every time is the theater thing.
Well, this band! This whole band
is crazy, jivin' around and carryin'
on all the time. At the start of the
second set Friday night, they all
come out and everybody picks up
someone else's instrument, and
starts playing it. I mean playing it.
The music was beautiful.
Everybody in the audience is
jumping around, trying to figure
out who's where, until after 5
minutes, the whole thing collapses
into hysterical laughter. Then
they switch back and rip up "A
Night in Barcelona," one of
Bobby's most soulful charts. Oh,

this group is loose!
New Songs
Some new songs: a highly
rhythmic African thing by Bobby,
and Todd Cochran's complex
"Zelda." And some Hutcherson
regulars, like "Ummhh," which is
what you're saying after the
world's most fantastic Bobby
Hutcherson gets through playing
it.
Bobby's got a new album out,
called "Head On," on the Blue
Note Label. Nice Head.
If you missed the group this
time, don't make the same
mistake the next time they're in
town.

Also on the bill at In Your Ear
last weekend was singer Essra
Mohawk. She can do some unique
and very fantastic things with her
voice, and was fun to listen to for
a while. But after the first 20
minutes or so of her set, it all
began to sound the same (got
quite repetitious, actually) and I

found myself concentrating on
better things. But she did have a i
flute player with her, and they :
worked quite well together. If ;
they work out some new and |
different things, it could be very
interesting.

February at In Your Ear is j
going to be a fine, fine month, j
Among the coming attractions j
are:
-Guitarist Gabor Szabo and j
his group, whom I caught down in ;
Los Angeles just before the Rose j
Bowl. Two fine guitarists, the j
world's freakiest bass player (but i
he's a stone monster), and a man !
with a really fine organ.
—Kenny Burrell, who has just j
won the "Down Beat" poll as best
guitarist of the year, and is
another dangerous man.
—Tenor saxophonist John
Klemmer, of fame as one of Don
Ellis' finest, among other fames. !
—And, best for last, maybe j
even Pharoah Sanders and |
Friends. So Enjoy.

group, they sound like they've
been playing together for years.
Solid, together, and with an
intuitive feel for what each other
is about to do.
New Electrovisor
Instead of his traditional vibes,
Bobby brought Deagan's new
ElactraVibe (an electric
vibraphone) and a big Deagan
marimba. He's just dangerous,
that's all. Fast as ever (which is
impossibly fast), maybe even

faster (more impossible yet). And
now he'll switch from one
instrument to another at sixty
miles an hour, and never drop a
note. He'll even play both at once.
And when he's not playing, he's
dancing around with a
tambourine, singing, or
what-have-you. The man never
stops.
The reason that a live
performance beats a recording
every time is the theater thing.
Well, this band! This whole band
is crazy, jivin' around and carryin'
on all the time. At the start of the
second set Friday night, they all
come out and everybody picks up
someone else's instrument, and
starts playing it. I mean playing it.
The music was beautiful.
Everybody in the audience is
jumping around, trying to figure
out who's where, until after 5
minutes, the whole thing collapses
into hysterical laughter. Then
they switch back and rip up "A
Night in Barcelona," one of
Bobby's most soulful charts. Oh,

this group is loose!
New Songs
Some new songs: a highly
rhythmic African thing by Bobby,
and Todd Cochran's complex
"Zelda." And some Hutcherson
regulars, like "Ummhh," which is
what you're saying after the
world's most fantastic Bobby
Hutcherson gets through playing
it.
Bobby's got a new album out,
called "Head On," on the Blue
Note Label. Nice Head.
If you missed the group this
time, don't make the same
mistake the next time they're in
town.

Also on the bill at In Your Ear
last weekend was singer Essra
Mohawk. She can do some unique
and very fantastic things with her
voice, and was fun to listen to for
a while. But after the first 20
minutes or so of her set, it all
began to sound the same (got
quite repetitious, actually) and I

found myself concentrating on
better things. But she did have a i
flute player with her, and they :
worked quite well together. If ;
they work out some new and |
different things, it could be very
interesting.

February at In Your Ear is j
going to be a fine, fine month, j
Among the coming attractions j
are:
-Guitarist Gabor Szabo and j
his group, whom I caught down in ;
Los Angeles just before the Rose j
Bowl. Two fine guitarists, the j
world's freakiest bass player (but i
he's a stone monster), and a man !
with a really fine organ.
—Kenny Burrell, who has just j
won the "Down Beat" poll as best
guitarist of the year, and is
another dangerous man.
—Tenor saxophonist John
Klemmer, of fame as one of Don
Ellis' finest, among other fames. !
—And, best for last, maybe j
even Pharoah Sanders and |
Friends. So Enjoy.
It's been four months since
Bobby Hutcherson's last
appearance in Palo Alto. And as
typical of Bobby's artistry, he
keeps changing for the better.
He moved into In Your Ear last
weekend with a new group and a
new instrument, and set a lot of
minds free.
His new group consists of
James Leary on bass, Mike Carter
on drums, and the young and
continually exciting Todd
Cochran on piano and electric
piano. Like any Hutcherson
group, they sound like they've
been playing together for years.
Solid, together, and with an
intuitive feel for what each other
is about to do.
