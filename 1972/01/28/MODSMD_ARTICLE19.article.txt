# Tolly's Follies
## A 						Big Traffic Jam 
### Don Tollefson 
Bill Graham's 1972 rock season at Winterland got
off to a strong start last weekend as the English rock
group, Traffic, performed one of the longer and
better sets in recent memory on Saturday night. The
group, which now consists of three of four original
members—Jim Capaldi, Steve Winwood and Chris
Wood—plus three newcomers, drummer Roger
Hawkins, bassist David Hood and conga drummer
Kwaku Boah, clearly demonstrated their
highly-praised ability on a wide range of numbers.
Traffic's vocals are always clear-toned and very
well-articulated. Winwood's voice especially has a
rare, beautiful tone. Winwood's keyboard talent and
Wood's occasional use of a flute or saxophone
complement a basically very strong guitar technique
found in the band.
Traffic has a rare ability to sound equally good
on widely differing types of songs, moving
effortlessly from rockers to beautiful slow things
like "John Barleycorn Must Die" and "Rainmaker."
As soon as Traffic left the stage after playing for
well over an hour, a capacity crowd exploded and
the group reappeared for their first encore. They
were accompanied by the fourth member of their
original group, guitarist Dave Mason, who had spent
some of his recent past in an apparently ill-fated
musical combination with Mama Cass Elliot.
Incredible Encores
While an electrified crowd screamed their
approval, Traffic plus Mason performed near-perfect
versions of two cuts off their first album, "Dear Mr.
Fantasy" and "Heaven Is In Your Mind." After they
finished those songs and left again, Graham, who
had been on stage nodding his approval during much
of their set, announced their second encore, by
telling the crowd that "a good friend of yours and
mine, Carlos Santana," will join in.
Traffic plus Mason and Santana then went into a
15 minute version of "Gimme Some Lovin' " which
ranked as one of the greater live performances of
any song I have ever heard. The audience responded
with nearly eight straight minutes of hooting and
clapping before one of Graham's assistants informed
them that Traffic conveyed their thanks, but they
had to catch a plane to Los Angeles. There were a
few hoots, but most of the crowd left quite happy
after what was a fairly remarkable set.
Standing next to Traffic performance, the other
two groups, J.J. Cale and Jo Jo Gunne had little
chance of being long remembered, which is
unfortunate in the first case and actually poetically

just in the second. Cale and his group, who have a
current 45 hit called "Crazy Mama," performed a
short, but restful and enjoyably quiet set. Their
slow, easy-listening type of music is incredibly
relaxing after a hectic day.
Wasted Energy
Jo Jo Gunne expends a lot of energy, but
unfortunately most of it is wasted. An offshoot of
Spirit, the group is a hard-rocking one centered
around a pounding pianist, Jim Ferguson, who
might as well often just run up and down on the
paino with his feet.
Ferguson seemed to think he was Leon Russell at
times, but any comparison would undoubtedly taint
the image of Joe Cocker's masterful protege. Jo Jo
Gunne pounded and plucked at nearly full volume
for much too long and when the crowd brought
them back for an encore, I was a bit mystified at
their judgement.
But maybe they were just clapping as I was, in
thanks for the group's departure. Or maybe they
were anticipating the fine things which lie ahead.
After Traffic played it was easy to forgive even Jo
Jo Gunne. If the rest of Graham's shows this year,
which will include in the near future 8.8. King,
Quicksilver, Black Sabbath, Emerson Lake and
Palmer, Joni Mitchell, Laura Nyro and the Allman
Brothers, can reach the level of Traffic's
performance, it could be a very good year indeed.
At least musically, that is.

night's rock concert in the Old Pavilion and
Sunday's concert by the San Francisco Chamber
Orchestra in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Up in
Berkeley tickets are available for both performances

concert tonight and organist Lowrence Moe's
concert Sunday night.
Bill Graham's 1972 rock season at Winterland got
off to a strong start last weekend as the English rock
group, Traffic, performed one of the longer and
better sets in recent memory on Saturday night. The
group, which now consists of three of four original
members—Jim Capaldi, Steve Winwood and Chris
Wood—plus three newcomers, drummer Roger
Hawkins, bassist David Hood and conga drummer
Kwaku Boah, clearly demonstrated their
highly-praised ability on a wide range of numbers.
Traffic's vocals are always clear-toned and very
well-articulated. Winwood's voice especially has a
rare, beautiful tone. Winwood's keyboard talent and
Wood's occasional use of a flute or saxophone
complement a basically very strong guitar technique
found in the band.
Traffic has a rare ability to sound equally good
on widely differing types of songs, moving
effortlessly from rockers to beautiful slow things
like "John Barleycorn Must Die" and "Rainmaker."
As soon as Traffic left the stage after playing for
well over an hour, a capacity crowd exploded and
the group reappeared for their first encore. They
were accompanied by the fourth member of their
original group, guitarist Dave Mason, who had spent
some of his recent past in an apparently ill-fated
musical combination with Mama Cass Elliot.
Incredible Encores
While an electrified crowd screamed their
approval, Traffic plus Mason performed near-perfect
versions of two cuts off their first album, "Dear Mr.
Fantasy" and "Heaven Is In Your Mind." After they
finished those songs and left again, Graham, who
had been on stage nodding his approval during much
of their set, announced their second encore, by
telling the crowd that "a good friend of yours and
mine, Carlos Santana," will join in.
Traffic plus Mason and Santana then went into a
15 minute version of "Gimme Some Lovin' " which
ranked as one of the greater live performances of
any song I have ever heard. The audience responded
with nearly eight straight minutes of hooting and
clapping before one of Graham's assistants informed
them that Traffic conveyed their thanks, but they
had to catch a plane to Los Angeles. There were a
few hoots, but most of the crowd left quite happy
after what was a fairly remarkable set.
Standing next to Traffic performance, the other
two groups, J.J. Cale and Jo Jo Gunne had little
chance of being long remembered, which is
unfortunate in the first case and actually poetically

just in the second. Cale and his group, who have a
current 45 hit called "Crazy Mama," performed a
short, but restful and enjoyably quiet set. Their
slow, easy-listening type of music is incredibly
relaxing after a hectic day.
Wasted Energy
Jo Jo Gunne expends a lot of energy, but
unfortunately most of it is wasted. An offshoot of
Spirit, the group is a hard-rocking one centered
around a pounding pianist, Jim Ferguson, who
might as well often just run up and down on the
paino with his feet.
Ferguson seemed to think he was Leon Russell at
times, but any comparison would undoubtedly taint
the image of Joe Cocker's masterful protege. Jo Jo
Gunne pounded and plucked at nearly full volume
for much too long and when the crowd brought
them back for an encore, I was a bit mystified at
their judgement.
But maybe they were just clapping as I was, in
thanks for the group's departure. Or maybe they
were anticipating the fine things which lie ahead.
After Traffic played it was easy to forgive even Jo
Jo Gunne. If the rest of Graham's shows this year,
which will include in the near future 8.8. King,
Quicksilver, Black Sabbath, Emerson Lake and
Palmer, Joni Mitchell, Laura Nyro and the Allman
Brothers, can reach the level of Traffic's
performance, it could be a very good year indeed.
At least musically, that is.
