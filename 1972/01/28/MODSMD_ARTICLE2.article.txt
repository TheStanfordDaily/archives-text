# Labor Unions Begin Drive For Workers
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
The beginning of what will
probably be a very long and tough
campaign to see which labor unions
win a place on campus starts Tuesday
at noon.
The United Stanford Employees
(USE) will hold a meeting in the
Medical Center and invite all
University employees to debate what
medical benefits and coverage should
be involved in any contract between
Stanford and the workers.
A National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) decision released Tuesday
directed elections within three
separate groups of employees to
determine which unions would
represent them in collective
bargaining.
University police must decide
whether or not they want to be
represented by the Stanford Police
Officers Association, while firemen
make a similar choice on the
International Association of Eire
Eighters Local 1-12 of the AEL-CIO.
The other group of workers authorized
by the NLRB to unionize, a large
grouping of maintenance workers, lab
support personnel, custodians, food
service workers and others, can choose
between six different unions.
United Stanford Workers, Workers

Action Caucus, Teamsters, California
Schools/Stanford Employees
Association, Construction General
Laborers Local 270, and Freight
Checkers, Clerical Employees and
Helpers Local 856 will wage a small
war to see which union will represent
the third group of workers.
The only organization thus far to
announce its plans for the
election—which hasn't been scheduled
yet, but will probably take place
around Feb. 15—is USE.
According to President Jim Berk,
an electrical engineer at SLAC, the
mass meeting Tuesday will be the only
really big event that his organization
will schedule. "People don't like to go
to large meetings, they're intimidated
by large meetings," he said. His group
will instead conduct a survey of
workers to find out what provisions
they want included in contracts. USE
will release a proposed contract nearer
to election time, based on what the
survey turns up.
Meanwhile, President Lyman said
"1 regret" the NLRB decision to
exclude hospital employees and
clerical workers from the election and
to break the campus into three parts
for unit voting. "But we shall, of
course, abide by its decision," he
added.
(Berk said the statement was
"duplicity" and that the
administration didn't really want a
large central union.)
Lyman called for a calm campaign.
"All can benefit from a mutual
exchange of views dispassionately
expressed ... I urge you to scrutinize
closely whatever claims and assertions
are made in the ensuing weeks," he
said in a statement Wednesday.
Lan Jacobsen, University manager
of special projects, said that Stanford
has submitted a list of voters it
believes eligible, as required by the
NLRB decision. He said a list of job
classifications would be ready to be
given to the NLRB today or Monday.
In San Francisco, NLRB regional
attorney Harvey Letter said that the
NLRB decision doesn't permanently
preclude University clerical workers
from unionizing, and that they can do
so anytime they find a union willing to
represent them.
He said the decision merely meant
that the clerical workers didn't have a
common interest with other Stanford
employees. He also said that Stanford
Hospital workers could probably
unionize, but that the Hospital was
actually a seperate entity, not directly
under University control.
