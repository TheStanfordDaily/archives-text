# Search Board To Name Engineering Dean
## 
### 
The search committee looking
for a Dean of Engineering to
replace Joseph Pettit expects a
person to be chosen before the
end of February, when Pettit
leaves to assume the presidency of
Georgia Tech.
The pool of 30 nominations
has been narrowed to a small
group of Stanford faculty and
outsiders, from whom a short list
will be presented to President
Richard Lyman.
The committee, chaired by
Provost William Miller, includes
eight faculty and three students,
as well as three others, and has
met eleven times since being set
up last November.

A statement released by the
Committee says in part, "The
next Dean will find a strong
faculty, bright and eager students,
and excellent facilities awaiting
his leadership towards a new era
in engineering education and
research."
