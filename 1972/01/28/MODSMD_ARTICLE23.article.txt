# Director Speaks Out On Ecology
## Dudley Herbarium Found Hidden Campus 
### NICK LATHAM 
A short walk around to the
back of the Stanford Museum and
up a make-shift stairway leads to a
darkened entrance marked
"Systematic Biology." The sign
on the door says to ring twice.
The unlocked door yields a
dismal expanse of empty
bookshelves and aquariam
cases—the deserted oceanographic
library. A round-about walk
through vacated laboratories
deposits a vistor at the foot of a
long metal stairway.
An arrow and the words
"Dudley Herbarium" instruct the
visitor to ascend. Mounting the
two long flights of stairs, the
visitor is conscious of the
reverberating noise and attempts
to muffle his steps.
With a faint sigh, he, at last,
steps solidly onto the concrete
foothold signaling the end of the
resounding stairs. An elderly lady
gluing dried plants onto white
paper peaks out from around a
far-away corner and nods,
confirming that this is, indeed, the
Dudley Herbarium.
This somewhat removed
institution on campus is presided
over by Dr. John H. Thomas,
associate professor of biology. His
soft-spoken manner—you could
even call it shyness—seems
somehow appropriate for the
curator of the Herbarium.
But Don't Touch
He treats every plant specimen
as his own, carefully straightening
out folder corners, scowling at an
occasional broken stem or torn
leaf. His specimens are to be
examined, but not
indiscriminately touched.
Taxonomy and the ecology of
vascular (woody tissued) plants of
western North America are his

specialties. He has authored a
book on the flora of the Santa
Cruz Mountains and he is engaged
in research on the plants of an
area of Central California.
He often appears to be the
genuine absent-minded professor.
A student of his recalls having met
him several times around campus
when he didn't even acknowledge
her greetings.
Another student tells of
Thomas leading her back into the
stacks to the Herbarium's
collection of narcotics. He showed
her the preserved marijuana and
poppy plants and told her where
they grew naturally. "I didn't
expect him to act this way," she
commented. "I had always
thought of him as so quiet and
reserved."
'Rotten Trees'
Thomas exhibits his subtle
humor in unusual ways. He
vehemently hates the "rotten
Eucalyptus trees" planted
throughout the campus. "We
should plant Oaks instead,
because Eucalyptus aren't native
to this area and they break down
the quality of the ground. But the
gardeners just won't listen to me
at all," he muses.
Thomas came to Stanford in
1948 and enjoyed the "friendly
atmosphere" and the opportunity
to finally pick and choose his own
classes. In January, 1949, he
became interested in the evening
primrose family and began a
treatment of it in the Sonoran
Desert for his master's thesis.
Ira Wiggins, former curator at
the Herbarium, recalls Thomas as
a "very quiet chap" when he first
came to Stanford. "He rarely
volunteered anything, unless you
asked him a question," stated
Wiggins, "but he would be quite

willing to talk once you got him
started."
Twenty-three years later,
Wiggins still finds him to be a
quiet individual. "But he can get
up on his hind legs when he needs
to," he added.
One subject that brings
Thomas to his feet is population.
He is an active member of Zero
Population Growth and has
traveled throughout the country
speaking on the urgency of birth
control.
Birth Control
A Roman Catholic, Thomas
has drawn wide attention for
flaying Pope Paul's stand on
maintaining the church
prohibition against the use of
contraceptives in birth control.
During a speech at St. John's
College in New Mexico, he
referred to the Pope as "a tragic
figure in our times."
In a later appearance in San
Francisco, he called the Pope "a
bad economist, a worse
demographer, and a terrible
biologist." He went on . . . "Paul
does not recognize the problems
of population in a realistic way,
and his comprehension of the laws
of ecology approaches zero."
Thomas sums up his own views
as follows: "We live in a finite
world, and if we don't get the
population stabilized, it will do so
itself by natural —and
drastic—consequences."
He rebukes the radical
movement for being
environmentally unaware. "They
don't realize that you can't repeal
the laws of thermodynamics.

They believe, wrongly, that the
economic system is at the root of
all the trouble."
Colleagues
Thomas and Paul Ehrlich,
colleagues since 1959, arrived at
the same conclusions regarding
the environment, separately, at
approximately the same time. In
some small way, Thomas helped
launch Ehrlich's career. "1
introduced him to Archdeacon
Weaver and then he went on to
get an invitation from the Bishop
to deliver a sermon in Grace
Cathedral. From there on, it was
just one thing after another for
Paul."
Does he resent Ehrlich's
prominence? "Heavens no!"
replied Thomas. "Ehrlich is
smarter and much more forceful.
There can only be so many chiefs.
Some people just get catapulted
into things like this. Anyway, I
am lucky I am not so well known.
Ehrlich is besieged by all kinds of
people."
Richard Holm, another biology
Professor, believes Thomas could
care less about being, bypassed for
prominence. "All of us in the
biology department feel that we
have developed our own ideas.
John has his own role to play. He
would not be effective on the
Johnny Carson Show and Paul
would not be effective speaking
before the Catholic Church."
The bulk of Thomas's speeches
were in 1969 and 1970, with the
demand now falling off. The
American public seems to have
grown tired of hearing about
ecology. "You have their

attention until another fad comes
along," states Thomas bitterly.
"And if this is so, ecology may
have been the last fad."
The Correct Line
The social responsibility borne
by Thomas accounts substantially
for the "straight" image perceived
by his students. As a Catholic, he
feels obliged to do what is morally
correct—and what he feels is
morally correct is to take part in
protecting the environment.
He tells of a speech he
delivered at St. Mary's College in ,
Winona. Minnesota, before a
group of monks and nuns.
Speaking at length of compulsory
retirement ages of 65 in
universities and corporations and
of the ridiculous seniority system
in Congress, he concluded
with—"The best thing the Pope
could do is retire now. " and was
met by a round of hearty
applause.
Thomas places himself on the j
believing rather than on the
atheist or agnostic side of religion.
"Anyone who whole-heartedly
believes in any other system other
than his own is not thinking.
"I am concerned with the
reason for the existence of matter
and energy. Once one assumes
that they exist, there is no
problem accepting cosmic and
organic evolution. The problem
does not involve a God or a Virgin
Mary."
He believes the church must be

changed from within. "Organized
religion does have a place," he
countered. "Instead of saying 'to
Hell with it', we should try to
change it. The Roman Catholic
Church has changed and I feel I
have fostered that change in a
small way through my speeches."

her greetings.
Another student tells of
Thomas leading her back into the
stacks to the Herbarium's
collection of narcotics. He showed
her the preserved marijuana and
poppy plants and told her where
they grew naturally. "I didn't
expect him to act this way," she
commented. "I had always
thought of him as so quiet and
reserved."
'Rotten Trees'
Thomas exhibits his subtle
humor in unusual ways. He
vehemently hates the "rotten
Eucalyptus trees" planted
throughout the campus. "We
should plant Oaks instead,
because Eucalyptus aren't native
to this area and they break down
the quality of the ground. But the
gardeners just won't listen to me
at all," he muses.
Thomas came to Stanford in
1948 and enjoyed the "friendly
atmosphere" and the opportunity
to finally pick and choose his own
classes. In January, 1949, he
became interested in the evening
primrose family and began a
treatment of it in the Sonoran
Desert for his master's thesis.
Ira Wiggins, former curator at
the Herbarium, recalls Thomas as
a "very quiet chap" when he first
came to Stanford. "He rarely
volunteered anything, unless you
asked him a question," stated
Wiggins, "but he would be quite

willing to talk once you got him
started."
Twenty-three years later,
Wiggins still finds him to be a
quiet individual. "But he can get
up on his hind legs when he needs
to," he added.
One subject that brings
Thomas to his feet is population.
He is an active member of Zero
Population Growth and has
traveled throughout the country
speaking on the urgency of birth
control.
Birth Control
A Roman Catholic, Thomas
has drawn wide attention for
flaying Pope Paul's stand on
maintaining the church
prohibition against the use of
contraceptives in birth control.
During a speech at St. John's
College in New Mexico, he
referred to the Pope as "a tragic
figure in our times."
In a later appearance in San
Francisco, he called the Pope "a
bad economist, a worse
demographer, and a terrible
biologist." He went on . . . "Paul
does not recognize the problems
of population in a realistic way,
and his comprehension of the laws
of ecology approaches zero."
Thomas sums up his own views
as follows: "We live in a finite
world, and if we don't get the
population stabilized, it will do so
itself by natural —and
drastic—consequences."
He rebukes the radical
movement for being
environmentally unaware. "They
don't realize that you can't repeal
the laws of thermodynamics.

They believe, wrongly, that the
economic system is at the root of
all the trouble."
Colleagues
Thomas and Paul Ehrlich,
colleagues since 1959, arrived at
the same conclusions regarding
the environment, separately, at
approximately the same time. In
some small way, Thomas helped
launch Ehrlich's career. "1
introduced him to Archdeacon
Weaver and then he went on to
get an invitation from the Bishop
to deliver a sermon in Grace
Cathedral. From there on, it was
just one thing after another for
Paul."
Does he resent Ehrlich's
prominence? "Heavens no!"
replied Thomas. "Ehrlich is
smarter and much more forceful.
There can only be so many chiefs.
Some people just get catapulted
into things like this. Anyway, I
am lucky I am not so well known.
Ehrlich is besieged by all kinds of
people."
Richard Holm, another biology
Professor, believes Thomas could
care less about being, bypassed for
prominence. "All of us in the
biology department feel that we
have developed our own ideas.
John has his own role to play. He
would not be effective on the
Johnny Carson Show and Paul
would not be effective speaking
before the Catholic Church."
The bulk of Thomas's speeches
were in 1969 and 1970, with the
demand now falling off. The
American public seems to have
grown tired of hearing about
ecology. "You have their

attention until another fad comes
along," states Thomas bitterly.
"And if this is so, ecology may
have been the last fad."
The Correct Line
The social responsibility borne
by Thomas accounts substantially
for the "straight" image perceived
by his students. As a Catholic, he
feels obliged to do what is morally
correct—and what he feels is
morally correct is to take part in
protecting the environment.
He tells of a speech he
delivered at St. Mary's College in ,
Winona. Minnesota, before a
group of monks and nuns.
Speaking at length of compulsory
retirement ages of 65 in
universities and corporations and
of the ridiculous seniority system
in Congress, he concluded
with—"The best thing the Pope
could do is retire now. " and was
met by a round of hearty
applause.
Thomas places himself on the j
believing rather than on the
atheist or agnostic side of religion.
"Anyone who whole-heartedly
believes in any other system other
than his own is not thinking.
"I am concerned with the
reason for the existence of matter
and energy. Once one assumes
that they exist, there is no
problem accepting cosmic and
organic evolution. The problem
does not involve a God or a Virgin
Mary."
He believes the church must be

changed from within. "Organized
religion does have a place," he
countered. "Instead of saying 'to
Hell with it', we should try to
change it. The Roman Catholic
Church has changed and I feel I
have fostered that change in a
small way through my speeches."
A short walk around to the
back of the Stanford Museum and
up a make-shift stairway leads to a
darkened entrance marked
"Systematic Biology." The sign
on the door says to ring twice.
The unlocked door yields a
dismal expanse of empty
bookshelves and aquariam
cases—the deserted oceanographic
library. A round-about walk
through vacated laboratories
deposits a vistor at the foot of a
long metal stairway.
An arrow and the words
"Dudley Herbarium" instruct the
visitor to ascend. Mounting the
two long flights of stairs, the
visitor is conscious of the
reverberating noise and attempts
to muffle his steps.
With a faint sigh, he, at last,
steps solidly onto the concrete
foothold signaling the end of the
resounding stairs. An elderly lady
gluing dried plants onto white
paper peaks out from around a
far-away corner and nods,
confirming that this is, indeed, the
Dudley Herbarium.
This somewhat removed
institution on campus is presided
over by Dr. John H. Thomas,
associate professor of biology. His
soft-spoken manner—you could
even call it shyness—seems
somehow appropriate for the
curator of the Herbarium.
But Don't Touch
He treats every plant specimen
as his own, carefully straightening
out folder corners, scowling at an
occasional broken stem or torn
leaf. His specimens are to be
examined, but not
indiscriminately touched.
Taxonomy and the ecology of
vascular (woody tissued) plants of
western North America are his

specialties. He has authored a
book on the flora of the Santa
Cruz Mountains and he is engaged
in research on the plants of an
area of Central California.
He often appears to be the
genuine absent-minded professor.
A student of his recalls having met
him several times around campus

contraceptives in birth control.
During a speech at St. John's
College in New Mexico, he
referred to the Pope as "a tragic
figure in our times."
In a later appearance in San
Francisco, he called the Pope "a
bad economist, a worse
demographer, and a terrible
biologist." He went on . . . "Paul
does not recognize the problems
of population in a realistic way,
and his comprehension of the laws
of ecology approaches zero."
Thomas sums up his own views
as follows: "We live in a finite
world, and if we don't get the
population stabilized, it will do so
itself by natural —and
drastic—consequences."
He rebukes the radical
movement for being
environmentally unaware. "They
don't realize that you can't repeal
the laws of thermodynamics.

They believe, wrongly, that the
economic system is at the root of
all the trouble."
Colleagues
Thomas and Paul Ehrlich,
colleagues since 1959, arrived at
the same conclusions regarding
the environment, separately, at
approximately the same time. In
some small way, Thomas helped
launch Ehrlich's career. "1
introduced him to Archdeacon
Weaver and then he went on to
get an invitation from the Bishop
to deliver a sermon in Grace
Cathedral. From there on, it was
just one thing after another for
Paul."
Does he resent Ehrlich's
prominence? "Heavens no!"
replied Thomas. "Ehrlich is
smarter and much more forceful.
There can only be so many chiefs.
Some people just get catapulted
into things like this. Anyway, I
am lucky I am not so well known.
Ehrlich is besieged by all kinds of
people."
Richard Holm, another biology
Professor, believes Thomas could
care less about being, bypassed for
prominence. "All of us in the
biology department feel that we
have developed our own ideas.
John has his own role to play. He
would not be effective on the
Johnny Carson Show and Paul
would not be effective speaking
before the Catholic Church."
The bulk of Thomas's speeches
were in 1969 and 1970, with the
demand now falling off. The
American public seems to have
grown tired of hearing about
ecology. "You have their

attention until another fad comes
along," states Thomas bitterly.
"And if this is so, ecology may
have been the last fad."
The Correct Line
The social responsibility borne
by Thomas accounts substantially
for the "straight" image perceived
by his students. As a Catholic, he
feels obliged to do what is morally
correct—and what he feels is
morally correct is to take part in
protecting the environment.
He tells of a speech he
delivered at St. Mary's College in ,
Winona. Minnesota, before a
group of monks and nuns.
Speaking at length of compulsory
retirement ages of 65 in
universities and corporations and
of the ridiculous seniority system
in Congress, he concluded
with—"The best thing the Pope
could do is retire now. " and was
met by a round of hearty
applause.
Thomas places himself on the j
believing rather than on the
atheist or agnostic side of religion.
"Anyone who whole-heartedly
believes in any other system other
than his own is not thinking.
"I am concerned with the
reason for the existence of matter
and energy. Once one assumes
that they exist, there is no
problem accepting cosmic and
organic evolution. The problem
does not involve a God or a Virgin
Mary."
He believes the church must be

changed from within. "Organized
religion does have a place," he
countered. "Instead of saying 'to
Hell with it', we should try to
change it. The Roman Catholic
Church has changed and I feel I
have fostered that change in a
small way through my speeches."
A short walk around to the
back of the Stanford Museum and
up a make-shift stairway leads to a
darkened entrance marked
"Systematic Biology." The sign
on the door says to ring twice.
The unlocked door yields a
dismal expanse of empty
bookshelves and aquariam
cases—the deserted oceanographic
library. A round-about walk
through vacated laboratories
deposits a vistor at the foot of a
long metal stairway.
An arrow and the words
"Dudley Herbarium" instruct the
visitor to ascend. Mounting the
two long flights of stairs, the
visitor is conscious of the
reverberating noise and attempts
to muffle his steps.
With a faint sigh, he, at last,
steps solidly onto the concrete
foothold signaling the end of the
resounding stairs. An elderly lady
gluing dried plants onto white
paper peaks out from around a
far-away corner and nods,
confirming that this is, indeed, the
Dudley Herbarium.
This somewhat removed
institution on campus is presided
over by Dr. John H. Thomas,
associate professor of biology. His
soft-spoken manner—you could
even call it shyness—seems
somehow appropriate for the
curator of the Herbarium.
But Don't Touch
He treats every plant specimen
as his own, carefully straightening
out folder corners, scowling at an
occasional broken stem or torn
leaf. His specimens are to be
examined, but not
indiscriminately touched.
Taxonomy and the ecology of
vascular (woody tissued) plants of
western North America are his

specialties. He has authored a
book on the flora of the Santa
Cruz Mountains and he is engaged
in research on the plants of an
area of Central California.
He often appears to be the
genuine absent-minded professor.
A student of his recalls having met
him several times around campus
when he didn't even acknowledge
her greetings.
Another student tells of
Thomas leading her back into the
stacks to the Herbarium's
collection of narcotics. He showed
her the preserved marijuana and
poppy plants and told her where
they grew naturally. "I didn't
expect him to act this way," she
commented. "I had always
thought of him as so quiet and
reserved."
'Rotten Trees'
Thomas exhibits his subtle
humor in unusual ways. He
vehemently hates the "rotten
Eucalyptus trees" planted
throughout the campus. "We
should plant Oaks instead,
because Eucalyptus aren't native
to this area and they break down
the quality of the ground. But the
gardeners just won't listen to me
at all," he muses.
Thomas came to Stanford in
1948 and enjoyed the "friendly
atmosphere" and the opportunity
to finally pick and choose his own
classes. In January, 1949, he
became interested in the evening
primrose family and began a
treatment of it in the Sonoran
Desert for his master's thesis.
Ira Wiggins, former curator at
the Herbarium, recalls Thomas as
a "very quiet chap" when he first
came to Stanford. "He rarely
volunteered anything, unless you
asked him a question," stated
Wiggins, "but he would be quite

willing to talk once you got him
started."
Twenty-three years later,
Wiggins still finds him to be a
quiet individual. "But he can get
up on his hind legs when he needs
to," he added.
One subject that brings
Thomas to his feet is population.
He is an active member of Zero
Population Growth and has
traveled throughout the country
speaking on the urgency of birth
control.
Birth Control
A Roman Catholic, Thomas
has drawn wide attention for
flaying Pope Paul's stand on
maintaining the church
prohibition against the use of
contraceptives in birth control.
During a speech at St. John's
College in New Mexico, he
referred to the Pope as "a tragic
figure in our times."
In a later appearance in San

John has his own role to play. He
would not be effective on the
Johnny Carson Show and Paul
would not be effective speaking
before the Catholic Church."
The bulk of Thomas's speeches
were in 1969 and 1970, with the
demand now falling off. The
American public seems to have
grown tired of hearing about
ecology. "You have their

attention until another fad comes
along," states Thomas bitterly.
"And if this is so, ecology may
have been the last fad."
The Correct Line
The social responsibility borne
by Thomas accounts substantially
for the "straight" image perceived
by his students. As a Catholic, he
feels obliged to do what is morally
correct—and what he feels is
morally correct is to take part in
protecting the environment.
He tells of a speech he
delivered at St. Mary's College in ,
Winona. Minnesota, before a
group of monks and nuns.
Speaking at length of compulsory
retirement ages of 65 in
universities and corporations and
of the ridiculous seniority system
in Congress, he concluded
with—"The best thing the Pope
could do is retire now. " and was
met by a round of hearty
applause.
Thomas places himself on the j
believing rather than on the
atheist or agnostic side of religion.
"Anyone who whole-heartedly
believes in any other system other
than his own is not thinking.
"I am concerned with the
reason for the existence of matter
and energy. Once one assumes
that they exist, there is no
problem accepting cosmic and
organic evolution. The problem
does not involve a God or a Virgin
Mary."
He believes the church must be

changed from within. "Organized
religion does have a place," he
countered. "Instead of saying 'to
Hell with it', we should try to
change it. The Roman Catholic
Church has changed and I feel I
have fostered that change in a
small way through my speeches."
