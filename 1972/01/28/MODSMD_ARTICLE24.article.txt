# Student View Of Bowl Ticket Sales
## 
### 
Editor's Note: In response to
many questions and complaints
about the Rose Bowl ticket sales,
we are printing the following
letter by Bob O'Deil questioning
the University's handling of the
affair. Printed below (Column
Two) are the athletic
department's views as expressed
by Business Manager Bob Butler
in an interview with Stan Wilson.
Director of Athletics:
I would like to bring to your
attention a serious and potentially
dangerous situation which arose
out of the Rose Bowl ticket sales
on Thursday, December 9, 1971.
Only the activity of a group of
volunteer student policemen,
formed in a very hasty manner on
an emergency basis, facilitated the
running of the ticket sales which
would have otherwise been

chaotic. Furthermore, this group
prevented any injuries which
could have easily occurred on
those bleachers had a mad rush
for the ticket booth ensued at any
time during the day. Even at that,
the obvious inadequate
preparation by the policemen
permitted many people to break
into line and, in many cases, to
affect an unfair allocation of
tickets.
The trouble began when,
unlike during the sales of the
previous year, Maples Pavilion was
opened (due to inclement
weather), and lines which had
formed outside were permitted to
stream inside in a random,
unorderly fashion. People who
had spent the night were, at this
time and later in the day,
absolutely screwed by others who,
in the process of moving inside,

went ahead of them. Inside, it
became necessary to organize the
lines to allow for students who
were saving places. Since students
were sitting on bleachers, it
became necessary to spread them
out, a task which was unsuccessful
in one line. Many people
throughout the course of the day
became quite justifiably upset as
they realized late arrivals were
crowding in ahead of them; in
many cases, there was little the
student volunteers could do.
I organized these 25 student
policemen at about 9:30 a.m.
when it became obvious that 1)
the University was not going to
police the lines, and 2) someone
was going to have to determine
the order in which to empty the
then rapidly filling bleachers when
tickets finally went on sale at
3:00 p.m. This task took all of us
the rest of the day and was
marked with some incredible
hassles.
The University (specifically the
Athletic Department through Mr.
Butler) continued to provide no
support regarding crowd control.
When I requested favorable tickets
for the student police (all of
whom, like myself, had initially
been standing in line very early in
the day and had given up good
places to help) I received a
negative reply from Mr. Butler. I
would emphasize that this request
only involved about fifty tickets.
It was only through the good
offices of Bill Eckland that the
ushers were assured good tickets,
and were thus able to remain on
the job during critical periods.
Due to the physical nature of
Maples Pavilion, it was very
difficult to keep people from
squeezing in line. Many living
groups were especially guilty of
operating in this manner and as a
result many ill feelings were
generated. At one point, about 30
people were crowded into the
bleacher space for four people. I
personally have never in my life

dealt with so many unreasonable
and illogical people: it was almost
like being in a jungle and dealing
with a bunch of animals. I would
emphasize that the many students
who understood the situation and
behaved in a civilized, fair
manner, were precisely those who
were crowded out of the better
seats by the inconsiderate late
comers.
I would therefore like to take
great exception with the manner
in which the Athletic Department
handled the ticket sales. Policies
as regards saving seats, positions
of the lines, etc. should have been
clearly delineated in advance via
an announcement in the Daily. I
do not mean to imply that this
episode was entirely the fault of
the Athletic Department: it most
certainly was functionally due to
the inconsideration and
thoughtlessness of the hundreds
of people who crowded into
places in front of those students
who had been there earlier. In a
word, the policy of saving seats was

abused and got out of hand.
In the light of these
conclusions I would like to make
two alternative suggestions: 1)
that any future such ticket sales
be tightly policed by University
personnel (with paid students
providing manpower, if necessary)
and that NO SKAT SAVING be
allowed. These policies should be
made clear in the Daily well in
advance of the date of sale; or 2)
that tickets should be distributed
entirely randomly by two (or
randomly by blocks so that
dormitory and fraternity groups
may sit together). I understand
that the University of Southern
California, which before last year
had considerable experience in
such ticket sales, used random
methods.
I hope you will give this matter
your serious consideration so that
similar scenes are avoided in the
future.

people were crowded into the
bleacher space for four people. I
personally have never in my life

dealt with so many unreasonable
and illogical people: it was almost
like being in a jungle and dealing
with a bunch of animals. I would
emphasize that the many students
who understood the situation and
behaved in a civilized, fair
manner, were precisely those who
were crowded out of the better
seats by the inconsiderate late
comers.
I would therefore like to take
great exception with the manner
in which the Athletic Department
handled the ticket sales. Policies
as regards saving seats, positions
of the lines, etc. should have been
clearly delineated in advance via
an announcement in the Daily. I
do not mean to imply that this
episode was entirely the fault of
the Athletic Department: it most
certainly was functionally due to
the inconsideration and
thoughtlessness of the hundreds
of people who crowded into
places in front of those students
who had been there earlier. In a
word, the policy of saving seats was

abused and got out of hand.
In the light of these
conclusions I would like to make
two alternative suggestions: 1)
that any future such ticket sales
be tightly policed by University
personnel (with paid students
providing manpower, if necessary)
and that NO SKAT SAVING be
allowed. These policies should be
made clear in the Daily well in
advance of the date of sale; or 2)
that tickets should be distributed
entirely randomly by two (or
randomly by blocks so that
dormitory and fraternity groups
may sit together). I understand
that the University of Southern
California, which before last year
had considerable experience in
such ticket sales, used random
methods.
I hope you will give this matter
your serious consideration so that
similar scenes are avoided in the
future.

Editor's Note: In response to
many questions and complaints
about the Rose Bowl ticket sales,
we are printing the following
letter by Bob O'Deil questioning
the University's handling of the
affair. Printed below (Column
Two) are the athletic
department's views as expressed
by Business Manager Bob Butler
in an interview with Stan Wilson.
Director of Athletics:
I would like to bring to your
attention a serious and potentially
dangerous situation which arose
out of the Rose Bowl ticket sales
on Thursday, December 9, 1971.
Only the activity of a group of
volunteer student policemen,
formed in a very hasty manner on
an emergency basis, facilitated the
running of the ticket sales which
would have otherwise been

chaotic. Furthermore, this group
prevented any injuries which
could have easily occurred on
those bleachers had a mad rush
for the ticket booth ensued at any
time during the day. Even at that,
the obvious inadequate
preparation by the policemen
permitted many people to break
into line and, in many cases, to
affect an unfair allocation of
tickets.
The trouble began when,
unlike during the sales of the
previous year, Maples Pavilion was
opened (due to inclement
weather), and lines which had
formed outside were permitted to
stream inside in a random,
unorderly fashion. People who
had spent the night were, at this
time and later in the day,
absolutely screwed by others who,
in the process of moving inside,

went ahead of them. Inside, it
became necessary to organize the
lines to allow for students who
were saving places. Since students
were sitting on bleachers, it
became necessary to spread them
out, a task which was unsuccessful
in one line. Many people
throughout the course of the day
became quite justifiably upset as
they realized late arrivals were
crowding in ahead of them; in
many cases, there was little the
student volunteers could do.
I organized these 25 student
policemen at about 9:30 a.m.
when it became obvious that 1)
the University was not going to
police the lines, and 2) someone
was going to have to determine
the order in which to empty the
then rapidly filling bleachers when
tickets finally went on sale at
3:00 p.m. This task took all of us
the rest of the day and was
marked with some incredible
hassles.
The University (specifically the
Athletic Department through Mr.
Butler) continued to provide no
support regarding crowd control.
When I requested favorable tickets
for the student police (all of
whom, like myself, had initially
been standing in line very early in
the day and had given up good
places to help) I received a
negative reply from Mr. Butler. I
would emphasize that this request
only involved about fifty tickets.
It was only through the good
offices of Bill Eckland that the
ushers were assured good tickets,
and were thus able to remain on
the job during critical periods.
Due to the physical nature of
Maples Pavilion, it was very
difficult to keep people from
squeezing in line. Many living
groups were especially guilty of
operating in this manner and as a
result many ill feelings were
generated. At one point, about 30
people were crowded into the
bleacher space for four people. I
personally have never in my life

dealt with so many unreasonable
and illogical people: it was almost

chaotic. Furthermore, this group
prevented any injuries which
could have easily occurred on
those bleachers had a mad rush
for the ticket booth ensued at any
time during the day. Even at that,
the obvious inadequate
preparation by the policemen
permitted many people to break
into line and, in many cases, to
affect an unfair allocation of
tickets.
The trouble began when,
unlike during the sales of the
previous year, Maples Pavilion was
opened (due to inclement
weather), and lines which had
formed outside were permitted to
stream inside in a random,
unorderly fashion. People who
had spent the night were, at this
time and later in the day,
absolutely screwed by others who,
in the process of moving inside,

went ahead of them. Inside, it
became necessary to organize the
lines to allow for students who
were saving places. Since students
were sitting on bleachers, it
became necessary to spread them
out, a task which was unsuccessful
in one line. Many people
throughout the course of the day
became quite justifiably upset as
they realized late arrivals were
crowding in ahead of them; in
many cases, there was little the
student volunteers could do.
I organized these 25 student
policemen at about 9:30 a.m.
when it became obvious that 1)
the University was not going to
police the lines, and 2) someone
was going to have to determine
the order in which to empty the
then rapidly filling bleachers when
tickets finally went on sale at
3:00 p.m. This task took all of us
the rest of the day and was
marked with some incredible
hassles.
The University (specifically the
Athletic Department through Mr.
Butler) continued to provide no
support regarding crowd control.
When I requested favorable tickets
for the student police (all of
whom, like myself, had initially
been standing in line very early in
the day and had given up good
places to help) I received a
negative reply from Mr. Butler. I
would emphasize that this request
only involved about fifty tickets.
It was only through the good
offices of Bill Eckland that the
ushers were assured good tickets,
and were thus able to remain on
the job during critical periods.
Due to the physical nature of
Maples Pavilion, it was very
difficult to keep people from
squeezing in line. Many living
groups were especially guilty of
operating in this manner and as a
result many ill feelings were
generated. At one point, about 30
people were crowded into the
bleacher space for four people. I
personally have never in my life

dealt with so many unreasonable
and illogical people: it was almost
like being in a jungle and dealing
with a bunch of animals. I would
emphasize that the many students
who understood the situation and
behaved in a civilized, fair
manner, were precisely those who
were crowded out of the better
seats by the inconsiderate late
comers.
I would therefore like to take
great exception with the manner
in which the Athletic Department
handled the ticket sales. Policies
as regards saving seats, positions
of the lines, etc. should have been
clearly delineated in advance via
an announcement in the Daily. I
do not mean to imply that this
episode was entirely the fault of
the Athletic Department: it most
certainly was functionally due to
the inconsideration and
thoughtlessness of the hundreds
of people who crowded into
places in front of those students
who had been there earlier. In a
word, the policy of saving seats was

abused and got out of hand.
In the light of these
conclusions I would like to make
two alternative suggestions: 1)
that any future such ticket sales
be tightly policed by University
personnel (with paid students
providing manpower, if necessary)
and that NO SKAT SAVING be
allowed. These policies should be
made clear in the Daily well in
advance of the date of sale; or 2)
that tickets should be distributed
entirely randomly by two (or
randomly by blocks so that
dormitory and fraternity groups
may sit together). I understand
that the University of Southern
California, which before last year
had considerable experience in
such ticket sales, used random
methods.
I hope you will give this matter
your serious consideration so that
similar scenes are avoided in the
future.

Editor's Note: In response to
many questions and complaints
about the Rose Bowl ticket sales,
we are printing the following
letter by Bob O'Deil questioning
the University's handling of the
affair. Printed below (Column
Two) are the athletic
department's views as expressed
by Business Manager Bob Butler
in an interview with Stan Wilson.
Director of Athletics:
I would like to bring to your
attention a serious and potentially
dangerous situation which arose
out of the Rose Bowl ticket sales
on Thursday, December 9, 1971.
Only the activity of a group of
volunteer student policemen,
formed in a very hasty manner on
an emergency basis, facilitated the
running of the ticket sales which
would have otherwise been

chaotic. Furthermore, this group
prevented any injuries which
could have easily occurred on
those bleachers had a mad rush
for the ticket booth ensued at any
time during the day. Even at that,
the obvious inadequate
preparation by the policemen
permitted many people to break
into line and, in many cases, to
affect an unfair allocation of
tickets.
The trouble began when,
unlike during the sales of the
previous year, Maples Pavilion was
opened (due to inclement
weather), and lines which had
formed outside were permitted to
stream inside in a random,
unorderly fashion. People who
