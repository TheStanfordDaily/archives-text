# University Reply On Tickets

### STAN WILSON 
Rose Bowl ticket sales? Many
people called this year's sales a
fiasco; optimists argue that next
year there must be a better way to
allocate Rose Bowl tickets.
One of those is Robert Odell,
Senior House Associate at Delta
Tau Delta, and in his preceding
letter to the Stanford Athletic
Department he echoes the
sentiments of many.
The problem, claims Odell, was
due to a lack of adequate planning
on the part of the University.
Policies regarding seat saving and
line positions should have been
made clear by the Athletic
Department in advance of the
sales. Anticipating problems,
Odell and a group of about 25
volunteers elected to police the
Pavilion, to facilitate an orderly
sale of tickets.
There were problems, and
many ill feelings were generated.
But there were no serious
incidents, and more importantly,
there were no injuries, which
could have resulted from the
chaotic situation.
In an attempt to clarify the
situation, the Daily interviewed
Bob Butler of the Athletic
Department. Apparently, the
Athletic Department had not
anticipated the problem. "Last
year not nearly as many people
lined up early," explained Butler.
Rain Escape
Had the sales been conducted
outside the Pavilion like last year,

there would probably have been
no trouble. But on the morning of
the ticket sales Bob Young, acting
Athletic Director, opened up
Maples Pavilion to allow the
growing crowds to escape the rain.
Apparently, all semblance of
ordei in the lines was lost, the
result of many people saving too
many seats, and many others
crowding into the front of the
lines.
It was at this point that Odell
took the initiative, and attempted
to gain the support of the Athletic
Department. Butler was not aware
of the problems, and had little to
do with the actual running of the
sales. Odell interpreted this lack
of action as uncooperation on the
part of the Athletic Department.
But the real problem was the
people themselves. People arriving
late in the afternoon crowded into
the front of the lines, and at times
many were completely
unreasonable. "The Athletic-
Department didn't foresee any
major problems," explained
Butler, "All the seats at the Rose
Bowl are good ones."
The ticket sales are primarily
run for students, and, normally,
the sales are "in the control of the
students . . . when rules are made
concerning ticket sales, you must
be sure that the students agree to
the rules," Butler continued.
Butler feels that it is important to
get a "feeling from the students"
regarding sales.

A public address
announcement explained that the
University did not endorse the
policy of saving seats, but since
there had been no prior
agreements made, there could be
no control of seat saving. Butler
agrees with Odell that it is
important that in the future,
policies such as seat saving are
determined by students in
advance of sales.
Random Sale Possible
An alternative to the present
system of ticket sales could be a
random sale method, but this
would make it impossible for large
groups to sit together. Butler
explained another method used
by Michigan, in an attempt to
discourage ticket scalping.
Coupons are sold to the students
at the University, and then
exchanged in Pasadena for tickets
two days before the game. A third
possibility would be a system of
selling the tickets by mail.
"Everyone with a student body
card gets a ticket," explained
Butler, "If the system were
random there would be no
problem with lines."
Butler anticipates few
problems with sales in the future.
Everyone who wants a ticket will
get one, and almost all of the seats
in the Rose Bowl are good ones.
That should be good news to
those of you who plan to spend
New Years Day, 1973, in sunny
Pasadena.
