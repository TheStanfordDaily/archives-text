## Brian Job Aims For Munich 
### DOUG WILSON

Summer Olympics in Munich. They include

victory this August, and finishing the sandwich
before the overeager hashers took away his plate.
Job is currently America's premier breaststroker

defending champion in both the 100- and 200-yd.
breaststroke events. He is undefeated in collegiate
competition this season, and last week set the
nation's fastest time to date in the 200—2:08.0. It is
therefore likely that he will accomplish his goals,
with the exception of the sandwich, which was
taken away as he was answering a question on his
swimming career.
Ohio Native
Which has been formidable. A native of Ohio,
Job has developed into the nation's fastest
breaststroke competitor under the tutelage of
George Haines, the well-known coach of the Santa
Clara Aquatic Club. Job will reutrn to Santa Clara
next quarter to concentrate on a training schedule
which he hopes will put him in top shape for the
Olympic trials, slated for the second week in July.
The Stanford junior is currently taking 23 units in
anticipation of "lost time next quarter", mostly to
fulfill requirements for an electrical-mechanical
engineering major.
Hopefully, this summer will prove more
productive than last for Job; he was defeated in
most major meets, including the Santa Clara
Invitational (where he was defending champion) and
the Pan-American Games in Cali, Colombia. Says
Job: "It was a question of never getting in shape.
The Invitational took place early in July; with finals
in the spring, it was hard to get in shape for the
meet, and Pankin (the USSR's premier
breaststroker) was shaved and peaked for the meet."
Beaten In Cali
In Cali, Job was beaten by Pac-8 competitor Rick

Colella of Washington, as well as by Felipe Munoz
of Mexico (currently a freshman at the University of
Texas) who won the Olumpic gold medal in the 200
and 1968. In that same race, Job copped the bronze
medallion.
However, Job feels he is not only over his
summer slump, but "on schedule as far as training
goes—l should still be ahead of last year." In
Stanford's first meet of the quarter (the Stanford
Relays) Job broke the one-minute mark for 100
yds.; his times in the 200 in meets against Oregon
State and the Arden Hills Swim Club have put him
at the head of Swimming World magazine's leading
time-ranked swimmers in his event.
Right behind him is Dave Shilling, the Stanford
team captain, and a performer of consistent quality.
Of Shilling the nation's second-ranked breaststroker
this week, Job commented: "It's good to have
someone pushing you the way Shilling
does—someone who's always right up with you. I
think he has a shot at the Olympics this year."
Gold Medal Hopes
Job is aiming, admittedly, for Olympic gold in
the 100- and 200-meter breaststroke in Munich; the
goal is understandably high, but this will be Job's
last outdoor swimming season. He plans to retire
after next year's NCAA competition. Consequently,
his training this spring will focus not only on
physical development, but upon the mental attitude
needed to defeat such competitors as Colella,
Nicolai Pankin of Russia, and America's John
Henken, a senior at Cupertino High School who has
a victory over Job under his belt.
Of US aquatic chances at Munich this summer,
Job said "the girls (who will be coached by Sherm
Chavoor of Arden Hills, assisted by Haines) will
have quite a bit of trouble, especially in the distance
events; the Australians are really coming on strong. I
think our men's team (coached by USC's Peter
Daland) will still be on top, though."
Job excused himself, got up, and retrieved the
ham-and-cheese from a surprised hasher. With
determination like that, Munich should be a snap.

Of Shilling the nation's second-ranked breaststroker
this week, Job commented: "It's good to have
someone pushing you the way Shilling
does—someone who's always right up with you. I
think he has a shot at the Olympics this year."
Gold Medal Hopes
Job is aiming, admittedly, for Olympic gold in
the 100- and 200-meter breaststroke in Munich; the
goal is understandably high, but this will be Job's
last outdoor swimming season. He plans to retire
after next year's NCAA competition. Consequently,
his training this spring will focus not only on
physical development, but upon the mental attitude
needed to defeat such competitors as Colella,
Nicolai Pankin of Russia, and America's John
Henken, a senior at Cupertino High School who has
a victory over Job under his belt.
Of US aquatic chances at Munich this summer,
Job said "the girls (who will be coached by Sherm
Chavoor of Arden Hills, assisted by Haines) will
have quite a bit of trouble, especially in the distance
events; the Australians are really coming on strong. I
think our men's team (coached by USC's Peter
Daland) will still be on top, though."
Job excused himself, got up, and retrieved the
ham-and-cheese from a surprised hasher. With
determination like that, Munich should be a snap.

breaststroke events. He is undefeated in collegiate
competition this season, and last week set the
nation's fastest time to date in the 200—2:08.0. It is
therefore likely that he will accomplish his goals,
with the exception of the sandwich, which was
taken away as he was answering a question on his

Ohio Native
Which has been formidable. A native of Ohio,
Job has developed into the nation's fastest
breaststroke competitor under the tutelage of
George Haines, the well-known coach of the Santa
Clara Aquatic Club. Job will reutrn to Santa Clara
next quarter to concentrate on a training schedule
which he hopes will put him in top shape for the
Olympic trials, slated for the second week in July.
The Stanford junior is currently taking 23 units in
anticipation of "lost time next quarter", mostly to
fulfill requirements for an electrical-mechanical
engineering major.
Hopefully, this summer will prove more
productive than last for Job; he was defeated in
most major meets, including the Santa Clara
Invitational (where he was defending champion) and
the Pan-American Games in Cali, Colombia. Says
Job: "It was a question of never getting in shape.
The Invitational took place early in July; with finals
in the spring, it was hard to get in shape for the
meet, and Pankin (the USSR's premier
breaststroker) was shaved and peaked for the meet."
Beaten In Cali
In Cali, Job was beaten by Pac-8 competitor Rick

Colella of Washington, as well as by Felipe Munoz
of Mexico (currently a freshman at the University of
Texas) who won the Olumpic gold medal in the 200
and 1968. In that same race, Job copped the bronze
medallion.
However, Job feels he is not only over his
summer slump, but "on schedule as far as training
goes—l should still be ahead of last year." In
Stanford's first meet of the quarter (the Stanford
Relays) Job broke the one-minute mark for 100
yds.; his times in the 200 in meets against Oregon
State and the Arden Hills Swim Club have put him
at the head of Swimming World magazine's leading
time-ranked swimmers in his event.
