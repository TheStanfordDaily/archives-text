At the risk of running Stanford's 1972 Rose Bowl victors into the
ground, there is one more aspect of the event worth mentioning.
Michigan students returned to class around the middle of January
to be greeted by the first issue of The Michigan Daily on January 14 th.
The Ann Arbor student newspaper made no mention of the school's
13-12 loss in Pasadena. Generous amounts of space were accorded to
the Wolverine gymnasts and wrestlers, but curiously there was no
mention of any New Year's Day activity.
The January 16th Michigan Daily did include a photo page entitled
"'Roses Fade in California Sun". There was only one photo of the
action on the field, while the others showed more pleasant moments
for the Michigan fans in Southern California. The highlight of the page
was a close-up of Attorney General John Mitchell scowling on the
Michigan side while his illustrious wife Martha (mouth closed) intently
viewed the game.
Although the Michigan fans undoubtedly had more fun in
California while removed from the vicinity of the Rose Bowl, their
trip west was also full of frustrations. A large group of students were
stranded in Ann Arbor at the last minute when their charter company
folded. There were countles's tales of misfortune as Wolverine rooters
battled with hotel accommodations and transportation hassles.
Ironically, those beset by Southern California's problems were
lucky to get that far. Only 21,000 tickets for the Rose Bowl game
were put on sale for a student body numbering 34,702. If you can
imagine anyone paying more for tickets than the inflated 10 dollars
that Stanford students were charged, Michigan supporters had to
come across with $10.50.
21,000 Wolverine rooters endured those inconveniences to travel
2600 miles fully expecting their Blue and Gold heroes to crush
Stanford. Most of the Michigan people 1 talked to before the game
had not even considered the possibility of the Wolverines losing. Most
of them knew more about Stanford's 1971 Rose Bowl Champions
than they did about Don Bunce and his 1971 Pac-8 winners.
Feeling that Jim Plunkett's departure from the Indian scene was
the one statistic with the most bearing on this year's Rose Bowl, there
was not one Michigan rooter who would pass up a chance to bet on
the Blue and Gold.
Only Bob Andrews, a Michigan Daily sports writer, had any hint of
what was to come when he wrote the following on December sth.
"It was only one year ago when the undefeated, untied, and
number-two ranked Buckeyes headed west expecting to demolish
Stanford and thus vault to the national championship. They had one
flaw in their plans of glory, overconfidence, and the Indians scalped
Woody's Wonders. The trip back east was just not the same.
"Now it is the Michigan Wolverines turn . . . the Wolverines could
end up bushwacked by the Indians and be sent back to Ann Arbor
with a feeling of great disappointment and head shaking.
After the Pasadena disaster, the Michigan fans expressed
admiration for the Indians and their style of play. The Ann Arborians
even went so far as to say that the Wolverine offense was
unimaginative and that Stanford deserved to win.
Possibly the highest compliment that the Big Ten fans could have
paid Stanford came during one of the charter flights back to freezing
Michigan. A group of disappointed students started singing the famous
Michigan fight song that they chorused all during the Rose Bowl game.
This version had one significant alteration, however.
"Hail to the victors valiant,
Hail to the Stanford Indians,
Hail to Stanford Universite-e-e-e!!/"

Butler (73) and Pierre Perreault (90) move in to finish the job. The Thunder Chickens stymied the
powerful Wolverine running attack in the last minutes of the Rose Bowl to set up Stanford's dramatic
13-12 win. The unexpected Michigan loss ruined the California trip for thousands of Wolverine fans.

trip west was also full of frustrations. A large group of students were
stranded in Ann Arbor at the last minute when their charter company
folded. There were countles's tales of misfortune as Wolverine rooters
battled with hotel accommodations and transportation hassles.
Ironically, those beset by Southern California's problems were
lucky to get that far. Only 21,000 tickets for the Rose Bowl game
were put on sale for a student body numbering 34,702. If you can
imagine anyone paying more for tickets than the inflated 10 dollars
that Stanford students were charged, Michigan supporters had to
come across with $10.50.
21,000 Wolverine rooters endured those inconveniences to travel
2600 miles fully expecting their Blue and Gold heroes to crush
Stanford. Most of the Michigan people 1 talked to before the game
had not even considered the possibility of the Wolverines losing. Most
of them knew more about Stanford's 1971 Rose Bowl Champions
than they did about Don Bunce and his 1971 Pac-8 winners.
Feeling that Jim Plunkett's departure from the Indian scene was
the one statistic with the most bearing on this year's Rose Bowl, there
was not one Michigan rooter who would pass up a chance to bet on
the Blue and Gold.
Only Bob Andrews, a Michigan Daily sports writer, had any hint of
what was to come when he wrote the following on December sth.
"It was only one year ago when the undefeated, untied, and
number-two ranked Buckeyes headed west expecting to demolish
Stanford and thus vault to the national championship. They had one
flaw in their plans of glory, overconfidence, and the Indians scalped
Woody's Wonders. The trip back east was just not the same.
"Now it is the Michigan Wolverines turn . . . the Wolverines could
end up bushwacked by the Indians and be sent back to Ann Arbor
with a feeling of great disappointment and head shaking.
After the Pasadena disaster, the Michigan fans expressed
admiration for the Indians and their style of play. The Ann Arborians
even went so far as to say that the Wolverine offense was
unimaginative and that Stanford deserved to win.
Possibly the highest compliment that the Big Ten fans could have
paid Stanford came during one of the charter flights back to freezing
Michigan. A group of disappointed students started singing the famous
Michigan fight song that they chorused all during the Rose Bowl game.
This version had one significant alteration, however.
"Hail to the victors valiant,
Hail to the Stanford Indians,
Hail to Stanford Universite-e-e-e!!/"

NOT HIS DAY—Michigan's Glenn Doughty hits the turf at the suggestion of Mike Simone (50). Larry
Butler (73) and Pierre Perreault (90) move in to finish the job. The Thunder Chickens stymied the
powerful Wolverine running attack in the last minutes of the Rose Bowl to set up Stanford's dramatic
13-12 win. The unexpected Michigan loss ruined the California trip for thousands of Wolverine fans.
At the risk of running Stanford's 1972 Rose Bowl victors into the
ground, there is one more aspect of the event worth mentioning.
Michigan students returned to class around the middle of January
to be greeted by the first issue of The Michigan Daily on January 14 th.
The Ann Arbor student newspaper made no mention of the school's
13-12 loss in Pasadena. Generous amounts of space were accorded to
the Wolverine gymnasts and wrestlers, but curiously there was no
mention of any New Year's Day activity.
The January 16th Michigan Daily did include a photo page entitled
"'Roses Fade in California Sun". There was only one photo of the
action on the field, while the others showed more pleasant moments
for the Michigan fans in Southern California. The highlight of the page
was a close-up of Attorney General John Mitchell scowling on the
Michigan side while his illustrious wife Martha (mouth closed) intently
viewed the game.
Although the Michigan fans undoubtedly had more fun in
California while removed from the vicinity of the Rose Bowl, their
trip west was also full of frustrations. A large group of students were
