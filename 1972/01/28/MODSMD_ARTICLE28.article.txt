# Frosh Attempt Revival
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford's freshman basketball
team will try to get back on the
winning track tonight when they
travel to San Jose State for a 6
p.m. game against the Spartan
frosh.
Tonight's game will be the fifth
straight road encounter for the
Indians, who lost their second
game of the season Tuesday night
at Merritt Junior College.
Merritt used some uncanny
outside shooting to record an
83-71 triumph. It was the
sixteenth victory against only six
losses for Merrritt, the sixth
ranked JC in California.
Score Knotted
The score was tied 55-55
midway in the second half when
Merritt scored on four straight 25
foot shots. The Tribe never
recovered and Merritt pulled away
for a 12 point win.
For Stanford, the loss was â€ž
second straight after opening the
season with seven convincing
victories. In both losses, the
explosive fast break which
triggered earlier victories was
absent.
"St. Mary's and Merritt were
the first teams that used zone
defenses against us," said forward
Mel Arterberry. "They slowed
down the tempo of the game and
we couldn't fast break
effectively."

Assistant Coach Stan Dowson
attributed the losses to poor
execution.
Dowson also mentioned some
bright points of the two games.
"We played some great basketball
in the last six minutes against St.
Mary's when we tied the score
after trailing by 17. And Rich
Kelley had a super individual
effort against Merritt."
Kelley's 27 point performance
was his highest output of the
season. Scott Trobbe and
Arterberrv also played well
against Merritt, scoring 14 and 13
points respectively.
Overconfidence
Several players felt that
overconfidence may have been
partially responsible for the
defeats. "After winning seven
straight we got a little bigheaded,"
said forward Archie Dean.
Another major factor was that
key Indian players were in foul
trouble throughout both games.
Kelley sat out most of the first
hal against St. Mary's with three
fouls while both Mark Gilberg and
Arterberry hnd three first half
fouls against Merritt.
Stanford should get back in the
win column tonight at San Jose.
The Indians demolished the
Spartans in an earlier meeting at
Maples Pavilion.
Saturday night the frosh will
return home for a 6 p.m. game
against Cuesta College.
