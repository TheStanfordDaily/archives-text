# Faculty Club Entered Again By Protesters
## 
### JAMES DEGEN 
Thirty members of the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement (SRM)
revisited the Faculty Club yesterday to
make amends for the $2,000 worth of
silverware and china that was allegedly
stolen by them when they last entered
the Club Monday.
As the SRM protesters entered the
Club at 12:25 p.m., Chief Chef Arturo
Lionetti attempted to keep them out
of the dining area by pulling a cord
across the entrance. As the protesters
tried to make their way past him,
Lionetti told them "don't push me,
don't push me." He soon gave up on
his efforts to bar the protesters from
entering.
When she spotted the protesters
entering the Club, one alarmed luncher
ran from the buffet table exclaiming
"I've got to get my purse!"
Upon gaining access to the dining
area, the d monstrators found it to be
filled with lunching faculty members.
The demonstrators distributed
styrofoam cups, plastic goblets and
plastic utensils to some of the faculty
members.
'So Are You'
Venceremos member Don Lee
called the eating utensils "white and
mainly sterile," to which a perturbed
faculty member responded: "so are
you!"
Explaining the disparity in value
between the actual silverware and the
plastic utensils, Lee explained "we
don't have quite the money David
Packard has to buy silverware and to
buy china."
Soon after entering the dining area
the demonstrators tacked up a banner
which bore a crossed knife and fork
and the inscription "Stanfork Rehab."
Close by that banner stood Special
Assistant to the President John
Schwartz and Law Professor John
Kaplan. Schwartz is responsible for
bringing charges against students
before the Campus Judicial Panel.
Kaplan heads the Panel.

As Young Crow Paul Loeb
presented a set of the plastic utensils
which had been spray painted silver to
Schwartz, Lee said that "it's not the
same as the silver spoon you were born
with in your mouth."
Of the demonstration at the Club
last Monday, Third World Liberation
Front member Kwonping Ho said "the
only thing we regret is that we only
took $3,000 worth (of silverware and
china) instead of taking everything. We
should have torn the whole place
apart."
The demonstrators left the club
peacefully at 12:40 without further
incidents. Schwartz said he did not
plan to take any students before the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) for the
incident.

INDIGESTION—John Kaplan, Chairman of the Campus Judicial Board,
Assistant to the President John Schwartz, and Law professor Jack Friedenthal
had trouble deciding between the Red Herring and the filet of Young Crow
for lunch at the Faculty Ciub.
Thirty members of the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement (SRM)
revisited the Faculty Club yesterday to
make amends for the $2,000 worth of
silverware and china that was allegedly
stolen by them when they last entered
the Club Monday.
As the SRM protesters entered the
Club at 12:25 p.m., Chief Chef Arturo
Lionetti attempted to keep them out
of the dining area by pulling a cord
across the entrance. As the protesters
tried to make their way past him,
Lionetti told them "don't push me,
don't push me." He soon gave up on
his efforts to bar the protesters from
entering.
When she spotted the protesters
entering the Club, one alarmed luncher
ran from the buffet table exclaiming
"I've got to get my purse!"
Upon gaining access to the dining
area, the d monstrators found it to be
filled with lunching faculty members.
The demonstrators distributed
styrofoam cups, plastic goblets and
plastic utensils to some of the faculty
members.
'So Are You'
Venceremos member Don Lee
called the eating utensils "white and
mainly sterile," to which a perturbed
faculty member responded: "so are
you!"
Explaining the disparity in value
between the actual silverware and the
plastic utensils, Lee explained "we
don't have quite the money David
Packard has to buy silverware and to
buy china."
Soon after entering the dining area
the demonstrators tacked up a banner
which bore a crossed knife and fork
and the inscription "Stanfork Rehab."
Close by that banner stood Special
Assistant to the President John
Schwartz and Law Professor John
Kaplan. Schwartz is responsible for
bringing charges against students
before the Campus Judicial Panel.
Kaplan heads the Panel.

As Young Crow Paul Loeb
presented a set of the plastic utensils
which had been spray painted silver to
Schwartz, Lee said that "it's not the
same as the silver spoon you were born
with in your mouth."
Of the demonstration at the Club
last Monday, Third World Liberation
Front member Kwonping Ho said "the
only thing we regret is that we only
took $3,000 worth (of silverware and
china) instead of taking everything. We
should have torn the whole place
apart."
The demonstrators left the club
peacefully at 12:40 without further
incidents. Schwartz said he did not
plan to take any students before the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) for the
incident.
