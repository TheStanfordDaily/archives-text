# Gymnasts Travel South
## 
### 
The Stanford gymnastics team travels south this weekend to
compete in the UCLA Invitational. This will be Stanford's first trip to
this excellent meet that includes some of the best teams in the West.
The field includes New Mexico, Berkeley, Cal State Fullerton, San
Fernando Valley State, USC, and host UCLA.
Coach Dan Miltman's gymnasts will compete without their
outstanding performer Steve Hug. Hug a veteran of the 1968
Olympics has been chosen as one of the country's six top gymnasts
who will perform with some of the best Japanese gymnasts in a meet
to be held this weekend at Penn State.
Coach Millman believes Stanford would place in the top three at
UCLA with Hug. Without him, Stanford will probably place sixth as
Hug is extremely valuable. Millman stated, "We're going down there
to test our depth. What we place down there will not be indicative of
our team potential because Steve won't be with us."
Millman's view of the conference finds Cal finishing on top because
of their great experience. He believes Stanford has a good shot at the
second spot, but will receive a close battle from UCLA and
Washington. Stanford faces UCLA next Saturday night at Stanford in
what will be an extremely important meet for both teams.
If Stanford is able to finish no worse than second at the Pacific
Eight Championships they will most likely be the Pacific-Eight's
representative at the NCAA Championships. The Pacific Eight sends
its conference champion which will probably be Cal, but Cal is
ineligible to attend NCAA events because of the Issac Curtis situation.
Millman offers quite a different approach to athletics than one has
come to expect from a coach. Millman states the major goal in most
sports is to win, but "In gymnastics we see it as much of a
performance art as anything. We aim to perform the best we can and
not measure ourself based on some other team. If we go out and do a
good job and we happen to meet a better team it does not mean we
did any less of a job."
