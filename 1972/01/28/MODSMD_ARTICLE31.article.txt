# Rugby Sweep
## 
### 
Coming off a four game sweep
of the San Francisco Rugby Club
last Saturday and a pair of wins
over Santa Clara Wednesday,
Stanford's rugby teams are
looking ahead to the clash this
weekend with the Peninsula
Ramblers.
The Ramblers vie every year
with the BATS for the title of the
number one club team in the Bay
Area,, and whereas the BATS are
noted for their superior ball
handling and adroit kicking game,
the Ramblers tend to fall back on
sheer muscle to overcome their
opponents.
The addition of former
Stanford ruggers Ron Kadziel,
Jack Schultz, and Jim Squei,
should open their attack up
somewhat, but a real physical
battle is expected. Kick off for
the varsity game is slated for 1:30
p.m. with Stanford's remaining
three teams going into action at
3:00 p.m.
Kip Oxman's penalty kick
early in the first half gave the
Indians the lead they never

relinquished in last Saturday's
game with San Francisco. It took
the Tribe a while to get rolling but
tries by Don Bunce, Frank
Charleton, and Marty O'Donohue
provided the margin of victory.
Oxman was good for two
conversions and the final score
had the Tribe on top.
Stanford's seconds traveled to
Santa Clara Wednesday and
administered a 19-0 pasting to the
Bronco's first teams while the
Indian's fourth club rallied to
defeat Santa Clara's seconds here
at home. John Heffeman kicked a
penalty kick and two conversions
to lead all scorers in the second's
game, one that was marked by
aggressive play amont the
forwards.
Stanford won the bulk of the
scrums and controlled the
liae-outs enabling scrum-half Mike
Wood, filling in for the injured
Mike Phillips, to get the ball out
to his line of backs. The Bronco's
spent most of the afternoon
punting out of trouble deep in
their own territory.
