Drink Age Drop
SACRAMENTO — An amendment to the state constitution lowering the
drinking age to 18 was introduced Thursday by Assemblyman John Knox,
D— Richmond.
If apprved by two-thirds votes in both the Assembly and Senate, the measure
would go on the ballot.
Knox said his proposal "would allow the legislature to provide exceptions for
persons under the voting age who are under parental control or engaging in
religious ceremonies."
Not Political

job because of his behavior and not his political beliefs, President Lyman says.

Last year Lyman started proceedings to fire Franklin, saying he had helped
provoke violent demonstrations on campus.
