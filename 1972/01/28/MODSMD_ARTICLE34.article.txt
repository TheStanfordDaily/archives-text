# Senate Condemns Student Trials
## 
### 
The Student Senate last night passed a resolution
condemning the upcoming trial of students charged with
disruption of activities at the Placement Center during
demonstrations last quarter.
The resolution, passed 15-6, said "all concerned
students should attempt to rectify these injustices by
demonstrating support for these defendants through their
presence at the trials, and by any other effective means,
and by the continued implementation of student
referendums."
The trial, set to begin next week, will be held before
the interim campus judicial panel, which was set up after
the Senate refused to name student members to the old
SJC.
The Senate also created four new committees in
response to a call by Council of Presidents member Doug
McHenry for "Senate reorganization."
The four committees, which will be open to
participation by all students, will concern 1) student
services, 2) the establishment of a new campus judicial
system, 3) the investigation of the quality of
undergraduate education, and 4) the investigation of
means of assuring student participation in processes of
university governance.
McHenry called the question of university governance
"the core issue" and said that a Senate committee should

be "solely devoted" to ge ting more students power in
decision-making processes.
In rcfercnce to the Senate ejection of the old SJC, he
said the Senate "has a responsibility ... to create
something better," and added thU there is "no reason this
can't be done this quarter."
He also urged that committees be set up to analyze the
effectiveness of present student service programs and the
possibility of ASSU control of them.
McHenry told the group that it is "lime to move again;
time that students took a more active part in
implementation" of the three-year-Gid Study of
Education at Stanford, which aimed to upgrade the
quality of undergraduate education.
In other actions, the Senate confirmed t ie election of
John Lawson, a first-year law student, as the new
elections commissioner. Lawson was the only candidate
Several senators reported on efforts to have student, as
well as faculty, observers during campus demonstrations.
The observers are supposed to watch for inappropriate
police actions.
The students reported that a plan for student observers
has been cleared with administration officials, and only
awaits the assurance of Santa Clara Sherriff's Lt. Donald
Tamm that such students would be free from police
attack or arrest.
