# Housing Shortage Persists

### JANE BUSSEY 
"This is the first quarter in memory
that we have had to turn people
away," said Assistant Dean of
Students in charge of housing Larry
Horton, as he outlined the student
housing situation at Stanford winter
quarter.
Stanford's housing office normally
can't place numerous students at the
beginning of fall quarter, but usually
the squeeze is alleviated by January.
"We got caught by surprise," was the
reaction in the housing office when
the quarter started with 34 men not
placed. Horton added that there was
"space for every woman who wanted
housing because housing is allocated
disproportionately in favor of
women."
"We're suffering from success,"
commented Horton. He attributed the
overflow to housing office efforts to
inform students about the availability
of space.
While 34 unassigned males is a
considerable improvement over the
354 unassigned students last fall, the
overflowing dorms is still a matter of
concern for the housing office.
The staff is now preparing for the
annual spring draw. The office is
accepting proposals for a new theme
house or any proposals to change a
living group from a single sex to a
coeducational house, or vice versa,
until the February 1 deadline.
Horton explained that so far
students have proposed to switch the
single-sex houses in Lagunita to
coeducation. The Lagunita houses
submitting proposals are the all-female

Olivo and Granada and the all-male
Magnolia. If Olivo and Granada
become coeducational, five all-girls
houses will be left (Paloma in Florence
Moore and the Row Houses: Guthrie,
Lathrop, Storey and Roth).
However, the housing office will
review the proposal to change
Magnolia "very carefully," said
Horton, since it is the last all-male
house in university housing. Although
fraternities offer all-male housing,
the university will keep that option
open if the need exists.
"The Dean of Students Office has
no intention of trying to force people
into one type of housing," said
Horton. He added that it has been
"the responsiveness to new programs
which has kept people on campus."
The high-rises scheduled to open

next fall will cure the tight housing
situation to some degree. Transfer
students need room, but space is also
short for present students. "The way
to help one is not to hurt the other,"
Horton stated.
"Next year 54 spaces are allocated
for transfers, along with 54 new places
for present students," Horton stated.
For those students not placed
during fall and winter quarters, spring
quarter should bring success, Horton
feels. But he quickly clarified his
optimism, "Let me put it this way,
there's never been a spring quarter
when we haven't had space for people
who wanted it." This should be a
comforting thought for the off-campus
student who wants to join the more
than 80 per cent of undergraduate
students who live on-campus.
