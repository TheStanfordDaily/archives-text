# Native American Students Object To Indian Mascot
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Perhaps it shouldn't have been the Stanford Indians
who won the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day. Stanford's
Native American students believe that the school's
"mascot" and symbol ought to be changed. They say that
the mascot, which has been used since 1930, "presents a
gross misconception of the Indian."
Lorenzo Stars, who is a Native American student,
emphasized that the Administration must realize that "the
mascot is a group of people and not an animal."
Stars insisted that if Stanford is "sincere" about having
the Indian as a mascot, it ought to be an "institution
dedicated to the betterment of the Indian situation" here
and elsewhere. He suggested that the University might
establish an Indian studies center as a part of the
demonstration of its sincereity.
The Native American students plan to present a
petition to the Administration next week through
Ombudswoman Lois Amsterdam, demanding that the
University no longer use the Indian as a mascot. They
have suggested that the Cardinal, which the Athletic
Department says is also an official mascot, could be used
as the sole symbol of the school.
This, if adopted, will be the second change in the
nature of Stanford's mascot in the last few years. Two
years ago the use of a ridiculing caricature of the Indian
was discontinued by the University. Last year an effort by
the Native American students similar to the one going on
now met with no success.
Bookstore Merchandise
The Native American students have discovered that the
Stanford Bookstore is still selling merchandise bearing the
ridiculing caricature. Although the merchandise is not on
display, it may be obtained by request from Bookstore
employees.
Bookstore General Manager Eldon Speed told the Daily
that his predecessor had been contacted by the President's
office at the time the caricature had been discontinued.
Speed said it had been agreed that no more merchandise
bearing the caricature would be ordered. He said that such
a large volume of that merchandise was on hand at the
Bookstore at the time that it had to be sold to avoid too
great a loss.

Associate Provost Raymond Bacchetti, who initiated
the University's current Native American student
admissions program, said that the caricature
"systematically insults" the Indian people.
Widespread Action
Of the Bookstore continuing to deal in the
merchandise bearing the caricature, Bacchetti said "that's
really discouraging. I thought they were better than that."
He said that he planned to lodge a personal complaint
with the Bookstore. Although he expressed concern for
the complaints of Native Americans and others, Acting
Athletic Director Robert Young spoke of the old
caricature saying, "I always liked that little Indian."
If the Native Americans' demands are fulfilled, their
actions will not be unprecedented. Students at the
University of Oklahoma have succeeded in halting the use
of the name "Little Reds" for the school's mascot. Efforts
are also underway to change the nicknames of the
Dartmouth Indians and the Cleveland Indians. The
Atlanta Braves have also been mentioned as a possible
target for action.
The Athletic Department would be presented with the
most serious problems if the mascot is indeed changed.
Acting Director Young said that "I can't see any major
problems without the mascot." However he did
acknowledge that the contributors to the Athletic
Department who form the Stanford Buck Club would be
confused by the change to a new mascot.
Buck Club
Young said that the confusion would result because the
long-used names of each contributor category in the Buck
Club would have to be changed. The names (Brave, Buck,
Big Buck, Chief, Big Chief, Super Chief) are all obviously
oriented to the mascot.
Buck Club President Clark Graham of Sacramento
pointed out that "any time you have any kind of change,
people resent it." However he said that he believed "if
people are being emotionally hurt | by the use of the
Indian mascot] it should be changed." Graham said that
he didn't think the change of mascots "would create any
problems at all" for the Buck Club.
Associate Provost Bacchetti also pointed out that the

Athletic Department could have contribution problems
because "a good number of the alumni have a close
attachment to the mascot and wouldn't understand" the
elimination of that mascot.
Professors Lacking
In speaking of the Native Americans' suggestion that an
Indian studies center ought to be established, Bacchetti

said such a center was unlikely "given the financial
problems we face in the maintenance of our current
programs."
In addition, Bacchetti said that it was "not clear that
the professorial services exist" to maintain such a center.
He pointed out that there are "only a dozen or so" Native
American professors now teaching in the United States.


GIVE 'EM THE AXE, SECRETLYâ€”These Indian caricatures, which graced many souvenir products in the past have been
eliminated, except from the backlog of merchandise the bookstore will sell you on request.
