## 'Human Beings' 
### 
The current status of the Indian as Stanford's mascot is totally
unacceptable. A symbol which exploits or degrades any race or ethnic
group cannot and should not be tolerated.
'The ASSU should immediately repeal its November 1930
resolution which officially adopted the Indian as the school's mascot,
and the Administration must lend its full support to the elimination
of all vestiges of that mascot.
We further urge that the Bookstore immediately stop dealing in
merchandise bearing the caricature of the Indian which was officially
dropped by the University two years ago.
The fact that the University has established a Native American
students admission program should not be overlooked. However, since
the Indian is still used as a mascot, the University has hardly dealt
adequately with the problem.
Surely the Administration, which usually prides itself on its
liberalism and rationality, would never permit the school's athletic
teams to be known as the "Negroes" or Poles. Nor would it allow men
with painted-on black faces to do the soft shoe between halves at our
football games. Why, then, are we the Stanford "Indians"? Why does
Prince Lightfoot perform his inauthentic dances under the guise of
traditional rituals?
We realize that it will be difficult for some alumni to accept such a
drastic change in the traditions of the University, but we feel it is the
task of the Administration and the Athletic Department to convince
skeptical alumni that this is indeed a desirable change.
Stanford ought to treat the Native Americans as human beings and
not as animals, fit to be relegated to mascot status. Buck Club
Pfesident Clark Graham's comment summarizes our feelings quite
well: "if people are being emotionally hurt by the use of the mascot,
it should be changed."
