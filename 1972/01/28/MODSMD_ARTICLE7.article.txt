# Life Under American Bombs
## 
### 
• The United States
administration claims that
anti-aircraft weapons and truck
convoys are the sole targets of
American bombing in North
Vietnam. However, Vietnamese
people, both combatants and
civilians live and work in these
bombed areas. United States
military officials' awareness of
these people is indicated by
continued American use of
aiitipersonnel bombs; bombs which
explode sending forth hundreds of
pellets or barbs harmless to

Shoots

military hardware and specifically
intended to pierce human flesh.
1 The following personal
accounts of life along "the route
to the front", the bombed area of
Truong Son along the Laos-DRV
border, are exerpts from the
North Viet Nam's Quart Doi Nhan
Dan (Peoples' Army), of
November 29 and 30.
Homes in Truong Son
In reality, there are no proper
homes in Truong Son because our
troops must always hold fast to
the transportation lines which are
fiercely attacked by bombs and
shells, to carry out the task of
aiding the frontline. However,
that is not a reason for them to
hide in deep tunnels or jungles.
All of the people here live, work,

and eat like those who are in a
position of winning victories or
like civilized men.
When we came to the
headquarters, a relatively quiet
place, we saw many well-built
homes called "barrel homes"—a
most popular type of home in
Truong Son. They are like 'armor'
used to protect men's lives. There
were built underground and are
bigger than a man. The troops dug
a big cave that looks like a barrel
in the earth and built a home in it.
Around the home there are big

mounds and a bomb-shelter for all
the people. The shelter is
protected from pellet bombs by a
small wooden floor or by a thick
layer of bamboo trees. Our cadres
and combatants in Truong Son are
skillful in building "underground"
homes in the midst of a battle
field full of bombs and shells. But
the homes look beautiful and
comfortable.
Homemade Equipment
In this section I would like to
tell you about a number of
implements that the brothers in
the Truong Son area have
produced with their own hands.
These implements, although small,
are evidence of the days they
fought the enemy here.
First of all I would like to

speak of the beautiful small
containers made out of the tubes
of the steel pellet bombs that the
U.S. aggressors have dropped on
the Truong Son area. These
brilliantly yellow metal
tubes—which look like gold plated
tubes—have been turned into
strong, but light boxes. Many
skilled comrades have turned the
metal from these tubes into items
that are used everyday. Comrade
Hanh—a combatant of the 35th
Anti-Aircraft Station—has
produced beautiful cigarette
boxes and containers for tooth
brushes and tooth paste. Comrade
Sinh of the 33rd Military Station
has producec cups—cups with lids
for tea and cups without lids for
drinking water and all kinds of
boxes for eye glasses, razors, and
medals. All of these articles bear
this sentence "Souvenir From The
Heroic Truong Son Fire Front."
The second most important
source of raw materials supplied
by the U.S. Air Force is from flare
parachutes. In the past few years,
after a night of enemy air activity,
in the morning flare parachutes
could be found everywhere, just
as mushrooms in the forest. In the
beginning, each person picked up
one but later no one took the
time to pick them up. It was a
waste of energy. Moreover, fewer
and fewer parachutes were made
of cloth. Parachutes made of cloth
were too expensive. Although the
U.S. imperialists were rich, they
could not afford to make flare
parachutes out of cloth forever.
Instead, they had to make flare
prachutes out of paper. With the
cloth from flare parachutes, the
brothers made flowers: red roses,
white roses, flowers for decorating
houses during Tet, flowers for
decorating the battlefield, flowers
for decorating the telephone girl's
hair and flowers to present to
artists. Cloth from flare
parachutes were also used to make
hammocks, mosquito nets, covers,
curtains and signal flags to be

hung over the shelter's entrance.
The engineering units in
Truong Son have their own blast
fumances. Their members
produce the necessary charcoal,
iron and tools, They go to the
forest to make charcoal. They
find iron plates and bars from the
damaged trucks or downed enemy
planes to make pliers, anvils and
hammers. The blast furnace of the
41st Engineer Battalion is in a
small workshop. It has not one,
but three furnaces. Their bellows
are made from tubes of U.S. steel
pellet bombs. The bellows are
equipped with wheels and belts
are easily movable and allow
much air to come in. This furnace
has six or seven operators of
whom Tuan alone knew a little
about the trade. However after a
short period of apprenticeship,
the operators turned out knives,
picks and shovels which wear the
"TS 41" labels and are in great
demand by the army.
An Heroic Life
Living on the Truong Son
fireline, our combatants, despite
many difficulties, the shortage of
many goods and constant enemy
bombings and shellings, have
always had an optimistic attitude.
Our driver combatants, an
assault force, have to cope every
night with innumerable U.S. air
raids. Each trip is a really thrilling
battle along the road. Their hearts
seem to be filled with
revolutionary optimism.
There are many poems dealing
with lights and the moon and stars
and praising our comrade drivers'
bravery and extraordinary acts.
Along the road to the battlefront,
I have stopped to read again and
again these touching slogans of
our engineering combatants:
"As soon as the explosion of
the bombs decreases, A mans
voice is heard, revealing his joy
amid the flames of ivar. ..."
(Earl Martin for Concerned Asian
Scholars.)

mounds and a bomb-shelter for all
the people. The shelter is
protected from pellet bombs by a
small wooden floor or by a thick
layer of bamboo trees. Our cadres
and combatants in Truong Son are
skillful in building "underground"
homes in the midst of a battle
field full of bombs and shells. But
the homes look beautiful and
comfortable.
Homemade Equipment
In this section I would like to
tell you about a number of
implements that the brothers in
the Truong Son area have
produced with their own hands.
These implements, although small,
are evidence of the days they
fought the enemy here.
First of all I would like to

speak of the beautiful small
containers made out of the tubes
of the steel pellet bombs that the
U.S. aggressors have dropped on
the Truong Son area. These
brilliantly yellow metal
tubes—which look like gold plated
tubes—have been turned into
strong, but light boxes. Many
skilled comrades have turned the
metal from these tubes into items
that are used everyday. Comrade
Hanh—a combatant of the 35th
Anti-Aircraft Station—has
produced beautiful cigarette
boxes and containers for tooth
brushes and tooth paste. Comrade
Sinh of the 33rd Military Station
has producec cups—cups with lids
for tea and cups without lids for
drinking water and all kinds of
boxes for eye glasses, razors, and
medals. All of these articles bear
this sentence "Souvenir From The
Heroic Truong Son Fire Front."
The second most important
source of raw materials supplied
by the U.S. Air Force is from flare
parachutes. In the past few years,
after a night of enemy air activity,
in the morning flare parachutes
could be found everywhere, just
as mushrooms in the forest. In the
beginning, each person picked up
one but later no one took the
time to pick them up. It was a
waste of energy. Moreover, fewer
and fewer parachutes were made
of cloth. Parachutes made of cloth
were too expensive. Although the
U.S. imperialists were rich, they
could not afford to make flare
parachutes out of cloth forever.
Instead, they had to make flare
prachutes out of paper. With the
cloth from flare parachutes, the
brothers made flowers: red roses,
white roses, flowers for decorating
houses during Tet, flowers for
decorating the battlefield, flowers
for decorating the telephone girl's
hair and flowers to present to
artists. Cloth from flare
parachutes were also used to make
hammocks, mosquito nets, covers,
curtains and signal flags to be

hung over the shelter's entrance.
The engineering units in
Truong Son have their own blast
fumances. Their members
produce the necessary charcoal,
iron and tools, They go to the
forest to make charcoal. They
find iron plates and bars from the
damaged trucks or downed enemy
planes to make pliers, anvils and
hammers. The blast furnace of the
41st Engineer Battalion is in a
small workshop. It has not one,
but three furnaces. Their bellows
are made from tubes of U.S. steel
pellet bombs. The bellows are
equipped with wheels and belts
are easily movable and allow
much air to come in. This furnace
has six or seven operators of
whom Tuan alone knew a little
about the trade. However after a
short period of apprenticeship,
the operators turned out knives,
picks and shovels which wear the
"TS 41" labels and are in great
demand by the army.
An Heroic Life
Living on the Truong Son
fireline, our combatants, despite
many difficulties, the shortage of
many goods and constant enemy
bombings and shellings, have
always had an optimistic attitude.
Our driver combatants, an
assault force, have to cope every
night with innumerable U.S. air
raids. Each trip is a really thrilling
battle along the road. Their hearts
seem to be filled with
revolutionary optimism.
There are many poems dealing
with lights and the moon and stars
and praising our comrade drivers'
bravery and extraordinary acts.
Along the road to the battlefront,
I have stopped to read again and
again these touching slogans of
our engineering combatants:
"As soon as the explosion of
the bombs decreases, A mans
voice is heard, revealing his joy
amid the flames of ivar. ..."
(Earl Martin for Concerned Asian
Scholars.)

Homes in Truong Son
In reality, there are no proper
homes in Truong Son because our
troops must always hold fast to
the transportation lines which are
fiercely attacked by bombs and
shells, to carry out the task of
aiding the frontline. However,
that is not a reason for them to
hide in deep tunnels or jungles.
All of the people here live, work,

and eat like those who are in a
position of winning victories or
like civilized men.
When we came to the
headquarters, a relatively quiet
place, we saw many well-built
homes called "barrel homes"—a
most popular type of home in
Truong Son. They are like 'armor'
used to protect men's lives. There
were built underground and are
bigger than a man. The troops dug
a big cave that looks like a barrel
in the earth and built a home in it.
Around the home there are big

mounds and a bomb-shelter for all
the people. The shelter is

in the morning flare parachutes
could be found everywhere, just
as mushrooms in the forest. In the
beginning, each person picked up
one but later no one took the
time to pick them up. It was a
waste of energy. Moreover, fewer
and fewer parachutes were made
of cloth. Parachutes made of cloth
were too expensive. Although the
U.S. imperialists were rich, they
could not afford to make flare
parachutes out of cloth forever.
Instead, they had to make flare
prachutes out of paper. With the
cloth from flare parachutes, the
brothers made flowers: red roses,
white roses, flowers for decorating
houses during Tet, flowers for
decorating the battlefield, flowers
for decorating the telephone girl's
hair and flowers to present to
artists. Cloth from flare
parachutes were also used to make
hammocks, mosquito nets, covers,
curtains and signal flags to be

hung over the shelter's entrance.
The engineering units in
Truong Son have their own blast
fumances. Their members
produce the necessary charcoal,
iron and tools, They go to the
forest to make charcoal. They
find iron plates and bars from the
damaged trucks or downed enemy
planes to make pliers, anvils and
hammers. The blast furnace of the
41st Engineer Battalion is in a
small workshop. It has not one,
but three furnaces. Their bellows
are made from tubes of U.S. steel
pellet bombs. The bellows are
equipped with wheels and belts
are easily movable and allow
much air to come in. This furnace
has six or seven operators of
whom Tuan alone knew a little
about the trade. However after a
short period of apprenticeship,
the operators turned out knives,
picks and shovels which wear the
"TS 41" labels and are in great
demand by the army.
An Heroic Life
Living on the Truong Son
fireline, our combatants, despite
many difficulties, the shortage of
many goods and constant enemy
bombings and shellings, have
always had an optimistic attitude.
Our driver combatants, an
assault force, have to cope every
night with innumerable U.S. air
raids. Each trip is a really thrilling
battle along the road. Their hearts
seem to be filled with
revolutionary optimism.
There are many poems dealing
with lights and the moon and stars
and praising our comrade drivers'
bravery and extraordinary acts.
Along the road to the battlefront,
I have stopped to read again and
again these touching slogans of
our engineering combatants:
"As soon as the explosion of
the bombs decreases, A mans
voice is heard, revealing his joy
amid the flames of ivar. ..."
(Earl Martin for Concerned Asian
Scholars.)
• The United States
administration claims that
anti-aircraft weapons and truck
convoys are the sole targets of
American bombing in North
Vietnam. However, Vietnamese
people, both combatants and
civilians live and work in these
bombed areas. United States
military officials' awareness of
these people is indicated by
continued American use of

explode sending forth hundreds of
pellets or barbs harmless to

military hardware and specifically
intended to pierce human flesh.

accounts of life along "the route

Truong Son along the Laos-DRV
border, are exerpts from the
North Viet Nam's Quart Doi Nhan
Dan (Peoples' Army), of
November 29 and 30.
Homes in Truong Son
In reality, there are no proper
homes in Truong Son because our
troops must always hold fast to
the transportation lines which are
fiercely attacked by bombs and
shells, to carry out the task of
aiding the frontline. However,
that is not a reason for them to
hide in deep tunnels or jungles.
All of the people here live, work,

and eat like those who are in a
position of winning victories or
like civilized men.
When we came to the
headquarters, a relatively quiet
place, we saw many well-built
homes called "barrel homes"—a
most popular type of home in
Truong Son. They are like 'armor'
used to protect men's lives. There
were built underground and are
bigger than a man. The troops dug
a big cave that looks like a barrel
in the earth and built a home in it.
Around the home there are big

mounds and a bomb-shelter for all
the people. The shelter is
protected from pellet bombs by a
small wooden floor or by a thick
layer of bamboo trees. Our cadres
and combatants in Truong Son are
skillful in building "underground"
homes in the midst of a battle
field full of bombs and shells. But
the homes look beautiful and
comfortable.
Homemade Equipment
In this section I would like to
tell you about a number of
implements that the brothers in
the Truong Son area have
produced with their own hands.
These implements, although small,
are evidence of the days they
fought the enemy here.
First of all I would like to

speak of the beautiful small
containers made out of the tubes
of the steel pellet bombs that the
U.S. aggressors have dropped on
the Truong Son area. These
brilliantly yellow metal
tubes—which look like gold plated
tubes—have been turned into
strong, but light boxes. Many
skilled comrades have turned the
metal from these tubes into items
that are used everyday. Comrade
Hanh—a combatant of the 35th
Anti-Aircraft Station—has
produced beautiful cigarette
boxes and containers for tooth
brushes and tooth paste. Comrade
Sinh of the 33rd Military Station
has producec cups—cups with lids
for tea and cups without lids for
drinking water and all kinds of
boxes for eye glasses, razors, and
medals. All of these articles bear
this sentence "Souvenir From The
Heroic Truong Son Fire Front."
The second most important
source of raw materials supplied
by the U.S. Air Force is from flare
parachutes. In the past few years,
after a night of enemy air activity,
in the morning flare parachutes
could be found everywhere, just
as mushrooms in the forest. In the
beginning, each person picked up
one but later no one took the
