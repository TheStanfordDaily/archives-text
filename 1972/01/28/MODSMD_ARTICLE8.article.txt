## The 						Day The Music Died 
### 
It io difficult for me to know
what today's college student, born
sometime around the Korean War,
thinks about rock and roll. For
those who were in kindergarten
when Bill Haley came rocking
around the clock and Elvis
outraged American decency, rock
and roll has always been. It is
something you have grown up
with, like apple pie.
For someone like myself, who
remembers Churchill's final
speeches as the troops came
home, whose song-memories go all
the way back to "Riders in the
Sky" in 1949, who was collecting
seventy eights ("Sh-Boom, "Mr.
Sandman") before rock and roll
happened—for someone in short
who recalls when there was no
rock and roll--the Rock Era is
something mysterious and tragic
all at once.
Don McLean's song,
"American Pie," a million seller
this month, has somehow got it all
down in 8 minutes 27 seconds of
sheer nostalgia.
Those of us in our teens when
Elvis came gyrating across
America with lyrics from the
heartland and a southern beat
were witnesses at a new birth.
"Do you have faith in God

above/If the Bible tells you so?"
We were perhaps the last high
school generation that did.
After that a total cultural
revolution in America gave birth
to a whole new religion, a fusion
of love and music. "Do you
believe in rock and roll/Can music
save your mortal soul/Can you
teach me to dance real slow?"
For those of us just then
learning to dance, it was all the
way McLean says it is.
Golden Years Ebb
"American Pie" is a song about
the golden years of the late fifties,
when rock and roll was a high
school gym thing, when life was
not politics and drugs were not
the way to highs.
It didn't last long, a few years
maybe. For these were the years
of the Beat Poets, followed by
grass and LSD, heavy electronics
and acid rock. McLean doesn't
quite say when, but somewhere
along the way there came "the
day the music died."
When was it? Was it February
1959? "February made me
shiver/With every paper I
deliver/Bad news on the
doorstep/I couldn't take one more
step." That was the month, Feb. 3
to be exact, when headlines

screamed the news that a plane
had crashed in lowa, carrying
Buddy Holly, Richie Valens and
Big Bopper to their deaths.
"American Pie" is dedicated to
Buddy Holly.
Assassination
Or was it November 1963,
when John Kennedy was
assassinated? "I don't remember if
I cried/When I read about his
widowed bride."
Ot was it sometime in 1965
when the Jester, Bob Dylan, went
serious, stole the martyr's "thorny
crown," and hauled out the
electric amplifiers to end an era in
music which he had made? After
that the scene was dominated by
the Byrds, the Beatles and the
Stones.
Maybe the final day the music
died was 1967, the year when
Dylan's motorcycle accident
occurred ("The Jester on the
sidelines in a cast"), the year of
the drug revolution, acid rock,
and the Beatles best album,
Sergeant Pepper ("The half time
air was sweet perfume/The
Sergeants played a marching
tune.")
Altamont
Or perhaps it was 1969, the
year the Rolling Stones hired the
Hells Angels at Altamont? Since
then, "moss grows fat on a rolling
stone."
Or maybe it was after that,
when Spiro attacked rock music
for corrupting youth? "As I

watched him on the stage/My
hands were clenched infists of
rage/No angel born in hell/Could
break that Satan's spell."
Perhaps when it happened does
not matter. The religion of rock
and roll, born out of youth and
love and dancing, has gone
through blow after blow as
acoustics have changed, as idols
like Janis and Jimmie have
crashed from drugs or whatever,
and as those who worshipped in
the gymnasiums were drafted to
fight The Endless War.
All of it has gone hollow
now-"I went down to the sacred
store/Where I'd heard the music
years before/But the man said the
music wouldn't play."
Metaphors
And so, in the words of
another song,—"ls that all there
is?"--Don McLean won't say, but
he has hinted—"The lyrics in that
song are metaphors for five or six
or seven or eight things and I
couldn't possibly give you one
meaning for any of them." Well,
what about some of those things'?
Of course: "Bye, bye, Miss
American Pie"-farewell to all
those sweet and juicy things of
American life, like Mom and
apple pie, and scrubbed,
squeaky-clean Miss-America girls
in little dresses just about the
knees.
Farewell to the whole hollow
plastic "pie" of the Great Society,
the New Frontier, the New

Prosperity. We sense it—the
American Dream is dead. Hello
Ms. America, handing out leaflets
in your blue jeans.
New Rock
Greetings to the New Rock, so
electronically engineered it cannot
be performed! Of course, that is
why the Beatles broke up, because
Ssergeant Pepper could not be
performed live without an
orchestra of 250 and a million
dollars of Moog equipment!
This is the New Age. Mere
musicians are out of date, just as
mere soldiers are obsolete in a
computerized air war over Asian
jungles. The end of music is the
end of Man.
"Amerian Pie" is a song about
the day the American music died,
which is almost any day and every
day for the past decade. It is a
song about the end of a culture. It
celebrates the terminus of the first
American Revolution, and the
last—the Youth Movement that
began with the "Book of Love"
and peaked with the words of
Martin Luther King—"l have
dreamed a dream."
But King is dead, along with
one Kennedy before him and
another after him. Perhaps this is
what McLean means: "Three men
I admired most/Father, Son and
Holy Ghost/They caught the last
train for the coast/The day the
music died."
