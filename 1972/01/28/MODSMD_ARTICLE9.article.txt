Cutlery Anarchy!
Editor, THE DAILY:
Various people now eat their
meals with $1,000 worth of
Faculty Club silverware that was
stolen during the occupation of
that building last Monday evening.
They no doubt chuckle at the
thought of having "liberated" the
silverware in the name of the
People (i.e., righteousness and
goodness).
They rationalize that their
theft is legitimate because those
who own the silverware are the
evil, decadent, bourgeois rulers of
this University. And besides,
private property is illegitimate,
contrary to nature, oppressive.
It is unfortunate that people
stood by and listened to that kind
of specious reasoning as they
watched certain demonstrates fill
their pockets with property that
didn't belong to them and leave
the Faculty Club without
opposition.
If we allow every
demonstration to turn into an
anarchstic free-for-all, an all
encompassing indictment of a
myjiad of evils that often have
nothing to do with the central
issues of the protest, then we
deserve in part the deaf ears upon
which our protestations fall.
James Friend,
Junior
Issue in the Franklin Case
(Editor's note—This letter
appeared in Wednesday's New
York TimesJ
To the Editor:
We protest The Times'

extraordinary editorial
condemning Stanford English
Professor Bruce Franklin. Its
intemperate language, factual
errors and misunderstanding of
the issues sadden us profoundly.
We had expected better of
America's foremost paper.
We ask whether the Times was
present at Professor Franklin's
hearing or read its 3,994-page
transcript and the amicus curiae
briefs of the American Civil
Liberties Union and the Stanford
Faculty Political Action
Group—in short, whether it has
informed itself of the true facts
and all the facts. We are appalled
by your characterization of
Professor Franklin's conduct as
"cowardly" and "irresponsible,"
your description of the reaction
of a group representing over sixty
professors, including many
distinguished scholars and one
Nobel Prize Laureate, as the
"predictable" charges of
Franklin's "defenders," and your
clearly ill-informed allegation that
"massive evidence" shows that no
violation of academic freedom has
taken place.
The statements that Professor
Franklin's ideology has never been
an issue and that his "action"
(actually speeches the A.C.L.U.
judges "so plainly protected by
the First Amendment that it is
not even a close question") was
"coercive and illegal" persuade us
that your editorial was based on a
biased and inaccurate account of
the evidence presented at the
hearing.
In fact, the editorial is replete
with tendentious phrases drawn
from the utterances of individuals

on this campus who have publicly
declared their hostility to
Professor Franklin and their desire
to see him fired.
This case will be brought to the
courts, where we believe Professor
Franklin will demonstrate that he
has done nothing illegal, but has
instead been deprived of his civil
liberties and his job because of
what a majorit; of our Advisory
Board calls a "pattern of
conduct" and a "perception of
reality" radically different from
that of the university's
administration, its wealthy donors
and—it is true—many of its
faculty. It is in fact his stubborn
adherence to his perception of
reality that has led the board to
despair (in the language of a
prison parole board) of his being
"rehabilitated."
Above all, he has effectively
embarrassed trustees,
administrators and faculty who
have collaborated—some,
shamefully, to their personal
profit—with the Defense
Department in the continuing
destruction of Southeast Asia. It
is not irrelevant that Daniel
Ellsberg, speaking here on Jan. 7,
found "nothing in the majority
report to criticize in Fran ton's
behavior—much less to dismiss
him for."
This is a political firing.
Despite profound differences that
separate the views of many of us
from those of Professor Franklin,
we believe he committed no illegal
act and that his banishment is a
threat to any who may in the
future publicly criticize the
university's policiees. If The
Times maintains its stand, it will
contribute to national
misunderstanding of the case and
prejudice against Franklin. We
week a full and honest hearing of
all the facts, careful study of the
evidence to which our Advisory
Board had access, but which its
majority group chose to ignore.
We seek this for justice, for the
truth and also for the honor of
The Times.
