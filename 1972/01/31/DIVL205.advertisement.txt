Today In The 6 Daily'
Today is Monday, January 31, 1972.
Fourteen years ago today the U.S. launched Explorer, its
first space satellite. We were trying to catch up with the
successful Sputnik of those space-crazed Russians.
If you can find a presenile American who is still worried
about the SPACE RACE, call our news freaks at 321-2300, ext.
