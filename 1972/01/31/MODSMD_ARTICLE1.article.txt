# Center Tests Palo Alto Drugs
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
On the average of about once a day, PharmChem
Laboratories in East Palo Alto receives in the mail a
sample of some psychedelic drug that has recently
been purchased on the underground drug market in
the Palo Alto area.
Under a unique program called Analysis
Anonymous, PharmChem technicians will test the
"street samples" for over 30 different chemicals and
reveal the results of the analysis to the prospective
user without threat of a bust.
The PharmChem program, the only one of its
kind in northern California, is run by
pharmacologist Jim Ostrenga and biochemist Larry
Goldman along with five other chemists. The
PharmChem Laboratories were begun two years ago
to analyze methadone treatment programs around
the country.
The lab is fully licensed by the Bureau of
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to legally analyze
any of the drugs on the Bureau's list of controlled
and illegal substances.
Analysis Anonymous began two months ago as
"just sort of a freak idea to help out the
community" Ostrenga says. "Before Analysis
Anonymous was instituted, prospective users of
psychedelics had to rely on under the table testing
procedures in Palo Alto or take the sample to the
Palo Alto police for testing. The problem with that
technique is evident."
More than 70 street samples have been sent to
Analysis Anonymous in the two months it has been
in operation, coming mostly from curious
individuals who want to see what they are getting
off on. Various county health clinics, physicians,

and law enforcement agencies use the service too,
and PharmChem gets at least one worried parent a
week with something that has been found in a son's
or daughter's pocket.
Although the program has received widespread
support from community social groups and drug
abuse clinics, the Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs has recently criticized Analysis
Anonymous because the laboratory does not keep
any record of names and addresses of the people
who brought or sent samples to be tested.
On January 14, the BNDD accused PharmChem
of "contributing to the flow of dangerous drugs and
therefore aiding and abeting a felony." The Bureau
has demanded that PharmChem begin keeping records
of who was asking for the drug analysis.
PharmChem officials harshly disagree with the
Bureau of Narcotics' claim that the testing program
contributes to the flow of drugs in the Bay Area.
"What the BNDD says is basically bullshit,"
Ostrenga said Wednesday, "because the dealer is
going to keep on selling his product regardless of
our analysis."
"All we're doing is helping out the guy who has
already bought the drug and wants to know what he
is taking. By telling him what's in the drug we are
keeping a lot of people from having bad trips and
freaking because of bad drugs."
By assuring users that the sample drugs will be
analyzed in complete confidence, Ostrenga insists he
is helping out people, but is not advocating the use
of drugs. "It's safer for the public that somebody is
testing out the stuff that people are taking," the
31-year-old Ostrenga explains, "and there's no
denying that more and more people are taking

secondary drugs and that there are more of these
drugs available."
Because of the Bureau of Narcotics warning,
PharmChem now is keeping a record of name and
address with each sample tested, but the company
insists it is still possible to have drugs analyzed with
complete confidence.
"All that is necessary is to include some return
address with some kind of name on it and we'll send
the results with no questions asked," Marketing
Director George Kohler says. Samples can be sent
to: PharmChem 1848 Bay Rd., Palo Alto, Calif.
94303. It would also be a good idea to include the
$10 for the analysis.
Along with the testing of the "street samples,"
PharmChem prints a monthly newsletter describing
the appearance of the various street drugs in the
Palo Alto area and giving both the alleged content
of the drug and it's actual content.
Marketing Director Kohler points out that "while
mescaline and psilocybin are by far the two most
popular drugs on the street, our analysis shows that
there really isn't any psilocybin or mescaline
circulating. What's being passed off as mescaline and
psilocybin is really LSD."
Kohler says that he thinks the street dealers "are
basically honest, in most cases they don't know
what they are selling either." In two years of
testing, PharmChem says that fully 70 percent of
the drugs sold on the street do not contain the
ingredients that the buyer thought they did.
Besides being misled as to the content of various
street drugs, Dr. Ostrenga says most street buyers
are misinformed about the dosages in the drugs.

DRUG TESTING—Lab technician at PharmChem Laboratories in Palo Alto
washes equipment following one of the many tests run daily by the firm to
determine the content of drugs sold in the community. The lab, which does
most of its work for methodone programs across the country, has recently
started "Analysis Anonymous," a program that analyzes the contents of drugs
submitted anonymously by persons wishing to know its true content.
"We've never tested a sample of
LSD over 450 micrograms," Ostrenga
says,"and that dosage was enough to
keep four people completely spaced
for 20 hours." Most street dope is in
the 30 to 40 microgram category,
Ostrenga guesses.
"Another thing that people don't
realize is that street names such as
"sunshine" and "windowpane" don't
really mean too much usually," the
Ph.D. continued. "While 'sunshine'
usually refers to a relatively large
dosage and 'windowpane' sometimes
means very pure LSD, these titles are
hardly to be trusted after about three
months because pretty soon
everybody on the street is calling his
stuff by the good name."
PharmChem makes very little profit
on its Analysis Anonymous program,
and manages to stay open mainly
through the more than 1000 tests they

run each week for methadone clinics
around the country. PharmChem
contracts with about a dozen clinics to
run weekly and bi-weekly urine tests
on methadone patients to determine
whether they have taken a shot of
heroin during the weekly methadone
treatment.
Both Ostrenga and Kohler express
extreme concern over the
mushrooming heroin addiction
problem in East Palo Alto. Social
workers, junkies and others in contact
with some of the PharmChem labs
describe the heroin problem in EPA as
"critical," the men warn.
"We know of one pusher in East
Palo Alto that is making $2,000 a
day," Ostrenga admits, "and I'd have
to say that he is not the only one in
that category."
A percentage of the money received
from the Analysis Anonymous

program is being set aside by
PharmChem towards the location of a
methadone rehabilitation center in
East Palo Alto. Although Ostrenga
doesn't have unqualified praise for
methadone treatments for addicts he
does think the programs "are the best
means we have today for dealing with
the problem."
Besides establishing a methadone
clinic in East Palo Alto, PharmChem
Laboratories hopes to publish a
national newsletter covering every
state's drug scene in the manner that
the local newsletter describes the
drugs circulating in the bay area.
"We're working on federal funding
now to set up a national analysis
center for the street drugs," Kohler
explains, "and hopefully we can
sometimes get samples from all over
the country to see what the drug users
everywhere are taking."

already bought the drug and wants to know what he
is taking. By telling him what's in the drug we are
keeping a lot of people from having bad trips and
freaking because of bad drugs."
By assuring users that the sample drugs will be
analyzed in complete confidence, Ostrenga insists he
is helping out people, but is not advocating the use
of drugs. "It's safer for the public that somebody is
testing out the stuff that people are taking," the
31-year-old Ostrenga explains, "and there's no
denying that more and more people are taking

secondary drugs and that there are more of these
drugs available."
Because of the Bureau of Narcotics warning,
PharmChem now is keeping a record of name and
address with each sample tested, but the company
insists it is still possible to have drugs analyzed with
complete confidence.
"All that is necessary is to include some return
address with some kind of name on it and we'll send
the results with no questions asked," Marketing
Director George Kohler says. Samples can be sent
to: PharmChem 1848 Bay Rd., Palo Alto, Calif.
94303. It would also be a good idea to include the
$10 for the analysis.
Along with the testing of the "street samples,"
PharmChem prints a monthly newsletter describing
the appearance of the various street drugs in the
Palo Alto area and giving both the alleged content
of the drug and it's actual content.
Marketing Director Kohler points out that "while
mescaline and psilocybin are by far the two most
popular drugs on the street, our analysis shows that
there really isn't any psilocybin or mescaline
circulating. What's being passed off as mescaline and
psilocybin is really LSD."
Kohler says that he thinks the street dealers "are
basically honest, in most cases they don't know
what they are selling either." In two years of
testing, PharmChem says that fully 70 percent of
the drugs sold on the street do not contain the
ingredients that the buyer thought they did.
Besides being misled as to the content of various
street drugs, Dr. Ostrenga says most street buyers
are misinformed about the dosages in the drugs.

DRUG TESTING—Lab technician at PharmChem Laboratories in Palo Alto
washes equipment following one of the many tests run daily by the firm to
determine the content of drugs sold in the community. The lab, which does
most of its work for methodone programs across the country, has recently
started "Analysis Anonymous," a program that analyzes the contents of drugs
submitted anonymously by persons wishing to know its true content.
"We've never tested a sample of
LSD over 450 micrograms," Ostrenga
says,"and that dosage was enough to
keep four people completely spaced
for 20 hours." Most street dope is in
the 30 to 40 microgram category,
Ostrenga guesses.
"Another thing that people don't
realize is that street names such as
"sunshine" and "windowpane" don't
really mean too much usually," the
Ph.D. continued. "While 'sunshine'
usually refers to a relatively large
dosage and 'windowpane' sometimes
means very pure LSD, these titles are
hardly to be trusted after about three
months because pretty soon
everybody on the street is calling his
stuff by the good name."
PharmChem makes very little profit
on its Analysis Anonymous program,
and manages to stay open mainly
through the more than 1000 tests they

run each week for methadone clinics
around the country. PharmChem
contracts with about a dozen clinics to
run weekly and bi-weekly urine tests
on methadone patients to determine
whether they have taken a shot of
heroin during the weekly methadone
treatment.
Both Ostrenga and Kohler express
extreme concern over the
mushrooming heroin addiction
problem in East Palo Alto. Social
workers, junkies and others in contact
with some of the PharmChem labs
describe the heroin problem in EPA as
"critical," the men warn.
"We know of one pusher in East
Palo Alto that is making $2,000 a
day," Ostrenga admits, "and I'd have
to say that he is not the only one in
that category."
A percentage of the money received
from the Analysis Anonymous

program is being set aside by
PharmChem towards the location of a
methadone rehabilitation center in
East Palo Alto. Although Ostrenga
doesn't have unqualified praise for
methadone treatments for addicts he
does think the programs "are the best
means we have today for dealing with
the problem."
Besides establishing a methadone
clinic in East Palo Alto, PharmChem
Laboratories hopes to publish a
national newsletter covering every
state's drug scene in the manner that
the local newsletter describes the
drugs circulating in the bay area.
"We're working on federal funding
now to set up a national analysis
center for the street drugs," Kohler
explains, "and hopefully we can
sometimes get samples from all over
the country to see what the drug users
everywhere are taking."
On the average of about once a day, PharmChem
Laboratories in East Palo Alto receives in the mail a
sample of some psychedelic drug that has recently
been purchased on the underground drug market in
the Palo Alto area.
Under a unique program called Analysis
Anonymous, PharmChem technicians will test the
"street samples" for over 30 different chemicals and
reveal the results of the analysis to the prospective
user without threat of a bust.
The PharmChem program, the only one of its
kind in northern California, is run by
pharmacologist Jim Ostrenga and biochemist Larry
Goldman along with five other chemists. The
PharmChem Laboratories were begun two years ago
to analyze methadone treatment programs around
the country.
The lab is fully licensed by the Bureau of
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to legally analyze
any of the drugs on the Bureau's list of controlled
and illegal substances.
Analysis Anonymous began two months ago as
"just sort of a freak idea to help out the
community" Ostrenga says. "Before Analysis
Anonymous was instituted, prospective users of
psychedelics had to rely on under the table testing
procedures in Palo Alto or take the sample to the
Palo Alto police for testing. The problem with that
technique is evident."
More than 70 street samples have been sent to
Analysis Anonymous in the two months it has been
in operation, coming mostly from curious
individuals who want to see what they are getting
off on. Various county health clinics, physicians,

and law enforcement agencies use the service too,
and PharmChem gets at least one worried parent a
week with something that has been found in a son's
or daughter's pocket.
Although the program has received widespread
support from community social groups and drug
abuse clinics, the Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs has recently criticized Analysis
Anonymous because the laboratory does not keep
any record of names and addresses of the people
who brought or sent samples to be tested.
On January 14, the BNDD accused PharmChem
of "contributing to the flow of dangerous drugs and
therefore aiding and abeting a felony." The Bureau
has demanded that PharmChem begin keeping records
of who was asking for the drug analysis.
PharmChem officials harshly disagree with the
Bureau of Narcotics' claim that the testing program
contributes to the flow of drugs in the Bay Area.
"What the BNDD says is basically bullshit,"
Ostrenga said Wednesday, "because the dealer is
going to keep on selling his product regardless of
our analysis."
"All we're doing is helping out the guy who has
already bought the drug and wants to know what he
is taking. By telling him what's in the drug we are

most of its work for methodone programs across the country, has recently
started "Analysis Anonymous," a program that analyzes the contents of drugs
submitted anonymously by persons wishing to know its true content.
"We've never tested a sample of
LSD over 450 micrograms," Ostrenga
says,"and that dosage was enough to
keep four people completely spaced
for 20 hours." Most street dope is in
the 30 to 40 microgram category,
Ostrenga guesses.
"Another thing that people don't
realize is that street names such as
"sunshine" and "windowpane" don't
really mean too much usually," the
Ph.D. continued. "While 'sunshine'
usually refers to a relatively large
dosage and 'windowpane' sometimes
means very pure LSD, these titles are
hardly to be trusted after about three
months because pretty soon
everybody on the street is calling his
stuff by the good name."
PharmChem makes very little profit
on its Analysis Anonymous program,
and manages to stay open mainly
through the more than 1000 tests they

run each week for methadone clinics
around the country. PharmChem
contracts with about a dozen clinics to
run weekly and bi-weekly urine tests
on methadone patients to determine
whether they have taken a shot of
heroin during the weekly methadone
treatment.
Both Ostrenga and Kohler express
extreme concern over the
mushrooming heroin addiction
problem in East Palo Alto. Social
workers, junkies and others in contact
with some of the PharmChem labs
describe the heroin problem in EPA as
"critical," the men warn.
"We know of one pusher in East
Palo Alto that is making $2,000 a
day," Ostrenga admits, "and I'd have
to say that he is not the only one in
that category."
A percentage of the money received
from the Analysis Anonymous

program is being set aside by
PharmChem towards the location of a
methadone rehabilitation center in
East Palo Alto. Although Ostrenga
doesn't have unqualified praise for
methadone treatments for addicts he
does think the programs "are the best
means we have today for dealing with
the problem."
Besides establishing a methadone
clinic in East Palo Alto, PharmChem
Laboratories hopes to publish a
national newsletter covering every
state's drug scene in the manner that
the local newsletter describes the
drugs circulating in the bay area.
"We're working on federal funding
now to set up a national analysis
center for the street drugs," Kohler
explains, "and hopefully we can
sometimes get samples from all over
the country to see what the drug users
everywhere are taking."
On the average of about once a day, PharmChem
Laboratories in East Palo Alto receives in the mail a
sample of some psychedelic drug that has recently
been purchased on the underground drug market in
the Palo Alto area.
Under a unique program called Analysis
Anonymous, PharmChem technicians will test the
"street samples" for over 30 different chemicals and
reveal the results of the analysis to the prospective
user without threat of a bust.
The PharmChem program, the only one of its
kind in northern California, is run by
pharmacologist Jim Ostrenga and biochemist Larry
Goldman along with five other chemists. The
PharmChem Laboratories were begun two years ago
to analyze methadone treatment programs around
the country.
The lab is fully licensed by the Bureau of
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to legally analyze
any of the drugs on the Bureau's list of controlled
and illegal substances.
Analysis Anonymous began two months ago as
"just sort of a freak idea to help out the
community" Ostrenga says. "Before Analysis
Anonymous was instituted, prospective users of
psychedelics had to rely on under the table testing
procedures in Palo Alto or take the sample to the
Palo Alto police for testing. The problem with that
technique is evident."
More than 70 street samples have been sent to
Analysis Anonymous in the two months it has been
in operation, coming mostly from curious
individuals who want to see what they are getting
off on. Various county health clinics, physicians,

and law enforcement agencies use the service too,
and PharmChem gets at least one worried parent a
week with something that has been found in a son's
or daughter's pocket.
Although the program has received widespread
support from community social groups and drug
abuse clinics, the Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs has recently criticized Analysis
Anonymous because the laboratory does not keep
any record of names and addresses of the people
who brought or sent samples to be tested.
On January 14, the BNDD accused PharmChem
of "contributing to the flow of dangerous drugs and
therefore aiding and abeting a felony." The Bureau
has demanded that PharmChem begin keeping records
of who was asking for the drug analysis.
PharmChem officials harshly disagree with the
Bureau of Narcotics' claim that the testing program
contributes to the flow of drugs in the Bay Area.
"What the BNDD says is basically bullshit,"
Ostrenga said Wednesday, "because the dealer is
going to keep on selling his product regardless of
our analysis."
"All we're doing is helping out the guy who has
already bought the drug and wants to know what he
is taking. By telling him what's in the drug we are
keeping a lot of people from having bad trips and
freaking because of bad drugs."
By assuring users that the sample drugs will be
analyzed in complete confidence, Ostrenga insists he
is helping out people, but is not advocating the use
of drugs. "It's safer for the public that somebody is
testing out the stuff that people are taking," the
31-year-old Ostrenga explains, "and there's no
denying that more and more people are taking

secondary drugs and that there are more of these
drugs available."
Because of the Bureau of Narcotics warning,
PharmChem now is keeping a record of name and
address with each sample tested, but the company
insists it is still possible to have drugs analyzed with
complete confidence.
"All that is necessary is to include some return
address with some kind of name on it and we'll send
the results with no questions asked," Marketing
Director George Kohler says. Samples can be sent
to: PharmChem 1848 Bay Rd., Palo Alto, Calif.
94303. It would also be a good idea to include the
$10 for the analysis.
Along with the testing of the "street samples,"
PharmChem prints a monthly newsletter describing
the appearance of the various street drugs in the
Palo Alto area and giving both the alleged content
of the drug and it's actual content.
Marketing Director Kohler points out that "while
mescaline and psilocybin are by far the two most
popular drugs on the street, our analysis shows that
there really isn't any psilocybin or mescaline
circulating. What's being passed off as mescaline and
psilocybin is really LSD."
Kohler says that he thinks the street dealers "are
basically honest, in most cases they don't know
what they are selling either." In two years of
testing, PharmChem says that fully 70 percent of
the drugs sold on the street do not contain the
ingredients that the buyer thought they did.
Besides being misled as to the content of various
street drugs, Dr. Ostrenga says most street buyers
are misinformed about the dosages in the drugs.
