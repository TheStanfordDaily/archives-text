Fair Decision?
Editor, THE DAILY:
The NLRB decision and
Lyman's statement published
Thursday exposes the duplicity of
the administration's labor policy
in the past year. The fact is that
the NLRB gave the administration
exactly what it wanted.
The administration has claimed
that a unit of all Stanford workers
(however, not the hospital) is the
only appropriate bargaining unit.
Most observers easily assumed this
was a continuation of their
long-standing anti-union policy.
They reasoned that the
administration felt that a larger
unit made a no-union vote more
likely.

The NLRB, however, said
"There is considerable record
testimony which would lend
support to a conclusion that an
overall unit ... would be
appropriate." Also "While the
overall unit urged by the
Employer and USE might also be
appropriate, there is no labor
organization eligible to proceed to
an election in this unit."!
The National Labor Relations
Act says, however, "Wherever a
petition shall have been
filed,... by an employer, alleging
that one or more individuals or
labor organizations have presented
to him a claim to be recognized as
the representative... it (the
NLRB) shall direct an election by
secret ballot". So the Employer
need only "allege" and can get an
election—if the unit is
appropriate. At Stanford the
overall unit was appropriate but
the Employer was unwilling to
allege.
What can they gain with the
present unit? Several things. A
contract now, with the workers
that have the strongest ties to the
traditional trade unions, will bring
some degree of labor peace. With
a business union, as Lyman says,
"In some ways I expect it could
make administration easier. . .."
And, before the NLRB entered,
the administration had no
difficulty doing business with
CSEA.
But more importantly, in the
long run, when the majority of
workers do get organized they will
be broken up into separate groups
and can be played off one against
another.

The worse crime in the NLRB
proceedings is the workers
inability to determine their own
affairs. The NLRB decision says
"The Board does not consider the
subjective wishes of employees in
making its unit determination."
Workers should not only bf free
to determine which union should
represent them, they should also
be free to determine how they
should be represented.
Representational (bargaining)
units should be determined bv
Stanford workers—not by
outsiders and the administration.
That's the way the
administration wanted it.

Open Letter
The bookstore extends
apologies to the community and
especially to the Native American
students at Stanford for selling
items ridiculing the Indian.
Merchandise bearing the Indian
caricature was to have been
completely disposed of by the
beginning of Fall Quarter.
Through my own oversight, some
remaining items are still in our
stock and have been sold. I have
instructed the souvenir
department to immediately cease
the sale of this merchandise and
to dispose of it promptly.
