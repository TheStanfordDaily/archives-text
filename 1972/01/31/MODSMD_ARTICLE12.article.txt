I have your challenging letter,
which argues that I have
singlehandedly produced the ugly
situation in which a small but
determined mob halts the
operation of the Stanford
Placement Service, prevents
individual students from having
their scheduled interviews, and
accompanies these actions with
such further moves as stealing a

briefcase of a company
representative.
Your letter misrepresents my
position on decision-making. You
attribute to me "a view of the
university as an institution where
decision-making must be an
integrated process, because
ultimately all decisions affect the
nature of the entire institution."
On the contrary, I maintain that
the university is peculiarly
decentralized, and that one of the
reasons people get frustrated with
what they mistakenly call "the
university decision-making
process" is that there is no single
process by which all University
decisions get made. The way in
which a faculty member gets
appointed is quite different from
the way in which the decision is
made to remodel a building. Both
differ from the appointment
process for a Dean of the Chapel,
or the decision-making path that
led to the abolition of ROTC at
Stanford.

You know perfectly well that
it is untrue to assert, as you do,
that I "did not allow students to
participate in any legitimate
manner in the decision-making
process"; the only way to
understand that statement, given
student involvement in a host of
ways in Stanford decision
making, is that you are angry
because students do not dominate
the process.
The extent of student
involvement varies according to
the subject matter and the nature
of the decision to be taken. It also
changes over time. No one is
arguing that the present situation
is frozen forever; changes have
been and can be made. But they
will not be made through
resorting to the kind of coercive
behavior displayed at the
Placement Center. To the extent
that your letter attempts to
justify that behavior, I doubt that
it will contribute much to solving
any problems or reforming any
decision-making processes.
