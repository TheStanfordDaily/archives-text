# A 						Very Disturbing Film About Nature
## 
### ANDREW BALDWIN 
"From the Baja to the top of the world—thrill to the uneaptured
splendor of — the American Wilderness," or something like that, is the
blurb on TV. It looks like one of the year's most wholesome, G rated,
real breathtakers of a nature movie.
But there are sometimes pickets in front of the Stanford Theater
and "nature-lovers" are confronted by them. The movie, unreported
in the ads on the tube, is the story of one man's trophy-hunting
adventures and mixed in with the flashy photography is the stalking
and shooting of about 10 of the most magnificent animals in North
America.
It all starts in Baja California, where the producer, director and
star, A.R. Dubs of Medford, Oregon, starts his fulfillment of a "seven
year dream"—to take (i.e. kill) all four subspecies of American
mountain sheep.
Sheep No. 1 is the desert bighorn, an animal which is evidently
somewhat rare, as even the übiquitous Mr. Dubs has a great deal of
difficulty in finding one. But he locates one in <he Baja, the legendary
Valley of the Rams - "sheep country so rugged, so isolated, that it
has remained virtually untouched." KABLAM. Switch to the biggest
sheep in the valley: still, legs twisted, head bent back, eyes open. Pan
to Dubs: big smile, while he is being congratulated by his faithful
Mexican companion, Cruz.
Broken Hearts
Sheep No. 2 is the bighorn in Alberta, Canada. Dubs spots a
"trophy-size" buck, but it's walking away. "He's moving off. He
hasn't seen me, but he didn't get so old without being cagey. Only his
instinct is warning him." KABLAM. Switch to Mr. Dubs, inspecting
the head and horns and philosophizing — "They'll empty your
pocketbook and sometimes they'll break your heart (i.e. get away)."
But the message is clear.
Sheep No. 3 is the Stone Ram in British Columbia. KABLAM. "His
showed that he was 11, 12, you guessed it 13 years old!" Dubs
explains that mountain sheep rarely survive more than 13 years. He's
really doing the sheep a favor. When Dubs kills, he generally makes a
comment like: "This one never would have lasted the winter." or "He
couldn't have lasted another year." or "I saved this one from the
wolves."
Sheep No. 4 is the great white Dall Sheep of Alaska. You didn't
find these guys in your back yard. You have to pack into the Alaska
Range. "We climbed higher and higher into God's country."
KABLAM. Dubs has scored his "grandslam."
At this point, the show, which is logically over, has an intermission.
You are urged by Dubs' pretty teenage daughter to buy a copy ot the
"American Wilderness" book for 50c. The book is an inspiration.
. . it takes being there to really appreciate and envision the scene, in
an overcrowded world today, where the remote areas of natural
beauty are rapidly disappearing. Very few of us in generations to
come will ever see and help preserve or enjoy nature in all its
splendor."
Travelogue Music
Part Two. Dubs and his buddies hunt the mule deer of the Oregon
high desert. No contest, except that this time, the horse spots the
deer. KABLAM. "Sure enough, Elmer's got a dandy." Travelogue
music plays continuously, except for short, dramatic pauses which
end on the firing of the fatal shot.
The climax is the hunt for "White Fury," a fabled polar bear which
has been terrorizing Point Hope, Alaska. The bear is never blamed for
hurting anybody; rather it seems as if everybody in Point Hope is
simply terrified of the bear. Dubs is on his way. His plane gets forced
down by a storm and he meets Tex, a former freak from UC-Berkeley,
living alone in the middle of the Yukon. "Things got too sticky at
Berkeley—too many causes to rally behind."
At Point Hope, he checks out the footprints, climbs back in his
plane and flies out after "White Fury." He stalks. Boy oh boy, it's a
big one. A white king, as big as a car. KABLAM. Blood. The bear
retreats. KABLAM. The bear is cornered. KABLAM. KABLAM.
It really is the world's biggest bear, eleven feet tall, with 17 inch
paws and a four foot, two inch neck. A real thunder chicken bear. His
little soldier is still bigger than yours, though, Mr. Dubs.
See you all in front of the Stanford Theater.

mountain sheep.
Sheep No. 1 is the desert bighorn, an animal which is evidently
somewhat rare, as even the übiquitous Mr. Dubs has a great deal of
difficulty in finding one. But he locates one in <he Baja, the legendary
Valley of the Rams - "sheep country so rugged, so isolated, that it
has remained virtually untouched." KABLAM. Switch to the biggest
sheep in the valley: still, legs twisted, head bent back, eyes open. Pan
to Dubs: big smile, while he is being congratulated by his faithful
Mexican companion, Cruz.

Sheep No. 2 is the bighorn in Alberta, Canada. Dubs spots a
"trophy-size" buck, but it's walking away. "He's moving off. He
hasn't seen me, but he didn't get so old without being cagey. Only his
instinct is warning him." KABLAM. Switch to Mr. Dubs, inspecting
the head and horns and philosophizing — "They'll empty your
pocketbook and sometimes they'll break your heart (i.e. get away)."
But the message is clear.
Sheep No. 3 is the Stone Ram in British Columbia. KABLAM. "His
showed that he was 11, 12, you guessed it 13 years old!" Dubs
explains that mountain sheep rarely survive more than 13 years. He's
really doing the sheep a favor. When Dubs kills, he generally makes a
comment like: "This one never would have lasted the winter." or "He
couldn't have lasted another year." or "I saved this one from the
wolves."
Sheep No. 4 is the great white Dall Sheep of Alaska. You didn't
find these guys in your back yard. You have to pack into the Alaska
Range. "We climbed higher and higher into God's country."
KABLAM. Dubs has scored his "grandslam."
At this point, the show, which is logically over, has an intermission.
You are urged by Dubs' pretty teenage daughter to buy a copy ot the
"American Wilderness" book for 50c. The book is an inspiration.
. . it takes being there to really appreciate and envision the scene, in
an overcrowded world today, where the remote areas of natural
beauty are rapidly disappearing. Very few of us in generations to
come will ever see and help preserve or enjoy nature in all its
splendor."
Travelogue Music
Part Two. Dubs and his buddies hunt the mule deer of the Oregon
high desert. No contest, except that this time, the horse spots the
deer. KABLAM. "Sure enough, Elmer's got a dandy." Travelogue
music plays continuously, except for short, dramatic pauses which
end on the firing of the fatal shot.
The climax is the hunt for "White Fury," a fabled polar bear which
has been terrorizing Point Hope, Alaska. The bear is never blamed for
hurting anybody; rather it seems as if everybody in Point Hope is
simply terrified of the bear. Dubs is on his way. His plane gets forced
down by a storm and he meets Tex, a former freak from UC-Berkeley,
living alone in the middle of the Yukon. "Things got too sticky at
Berkeley—too many causes to rally behind."
At Point Hope, he checks out the footprints, climbs back in his
plane and flies out after "White Fury." He stalks. Boy oh boy, it's a
big one. A white king, as big as a car. KABLAM. Blood. The bear
retreats. KABLAM. The bear is cornered. KABLAM. KABLAM.
It really is the world's biggest bear, eleven feet tall, with 17 inch
paws and a four foot, two inch neck. A real thunder chicken bear. His
little soldier is still bigger than yours, though, Mr. Dubs.
See you all in front of the Stanford Theater.
"From the Baja to the top of the world—thrill to the uneaptured
splendor of — the American Wilderness," or something like that, is the
blurb on TV. It looks like one of the year's most wholesome, G rated,
real breathtakers of a nature movie.
But there are sometimes pickets in front of the Stanford Theater
and "nature-lovers" are confronted by them. The movie, unreported
in the ads on the tube, is the story of one man's trophy-hunting
adventures and mixed in with the flashy photography is the stalking
and shooting of about 10 of the most magnificent animals in North
America.
It all starts in Baja California, where the producer, director and
star, A.R. Dubs of Medford, Oregon, starts his fulfillment of a "seven
year dream"—to take (i.e. kill) all four subspecies of American
mountain sheep.
