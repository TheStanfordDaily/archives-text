# Cold Blood High lights Show At Old Pavilion
## 
### BARRY WOOD 
Take a couple of thousand kids from the great
baby boom, dress them in blue jeans, pack them
onto an acre of canvas-covered tumbling mats, bring
on four bands, add a light show and a few lids of
grass (not provided) — and you have a Rock Show,
Stanford style. Saturday night in the Old Pavilion
was it - 5 hours and 40 minutes of solid American
youth culture.
Perhaps the Great Nameless Wonderband should
remain nameless. A local group of four unspirited,
somewhat immature, and definitely uninspired
players, they opened the show with an hour of
unremembered songs and corn about a yellow VW
bus with a propellor on the front.
Considering the place was full before eight, it was
too bad they couldn't have got together a better
show.
The Wonderband was followed by Blue
Mountain, the first of three large bands with about a
dozen members. Blue Mountain has got to typify the
worst in Hard Rock. While this form generally
depends on volume for creating a total environment
and inducing a kind of hypnotic sensory throb, it
too easily slips into being a sheer wall of noise. Only
in isolated moments did Blue Mountain rise above a
sound which simply flattens out everything
distinctive in the individual sounds.
The main fault of Blue Mountain is repreated
three times in their band. They have three strong
vocalists, but rarely will they allow each other to do
anything. Instead they drown each other out,
thereby confusing any sense of meaning in what
they sing. Further, the three guitarists also compete,
setting up an acoustic jumble of amplified twang.
Finally, they have three brass players, who never for
a moment distinguished themselves as a group. They
were simply lost among drumbeats and guitar
sounds.
Sad Performance
This was a sad performance, particularly because
of promising bright moments. Two such moments
actually involved the audience and brought them to
their feet — though this was two hours into the
whole show. One such moment was a splendid sax
solo with just a little guitar backing, and one was
dismayed to know that so much good talent was so
deeply buried under heavy amplification. The other
moment was a hypnotic sing-along which almost
took off, as it might have in Sly's hands: "Feel the
sun — let it shine in the morning." This was the first
real bright spot of the evening.
As the evening progressed things got better.
Stoneground is a powerhouse band that knows
exactly what it's up to. With equally heavy brass and
guitar, they have learned one of the precious arts of
Hard Rock. This is a matter of acoustic space — the
ability to simply leave room for the vocals, to give
them enough acoustic room that they are not lost
under a wave of noise.
Stoneground has four female vocalists who not
only work well as a singing team but can

individually command the whole stage. During the
show they each took their turn, and I for one could
have stood at least two more numbers from each.
The lead vocalist carried the show himself, however,
not only with a series of well-paced blues-rock
songs, but a sense of audience rapport noticeably
lacking in the first two groups.
Expert Light Show
At this point in the show, one has to give
Crimson Madness credit for their light show. The
whole thing was expertly done right from the start,
with a sense of crescendo to match the sound. But it
was during the Stoneground show that they rose to
their best with the slow motion movie, "A Dream of
Wild Horses," moving through the lights. This had
to be one of the perfect strokes of the evening, a
fusion of the best electronic technology with a kind
of primitive natural beauty.
The feature group was Cold Blood, a band that is
talented every moment they play. Like
Stoneground, they give each other enough acoustic
space to give their sound expression, and a kind of
flow lacking in the other groups. But their secret has
to be their lead vocalist, Lydia Pense.
I had been warned of her before I saw the show:
an imitator, sometimes a slavish one, of Janis Joplin.
I came away convinced the girl was no longer an
imitator, but was instead an exact duplication of
Janis, a fantastic piece of female machinery
reincarnating Joplin right down to the gurgles and
sputters and tossing mane. She has a voice with both
expression and power, and it literally rides on the
music. Never have 1 seen a female with a voice that
could quite slice through three brass instruments
going full blast, almost carving out its own melodic
space.
Excellent Work
There was some really excellent brass work, some
superb solo moments both on brass and keyboard,
and the only fault of the drummer was a facial
contortion habit he seems unable to control. But his
voice provides precisely the right backup for Pense.
"Take All of My Honey" was one of her best songs,
and"I Only Wanna Make Love" another.
Wisely Pense avoids doing Joplin songs, though
she could do them well. Instead she simply radiates
guttural sexuality — injects it, in fact, from a
distance of 30 yards. It was a stand-up show for the
last hour, and a move-in during the last numbers,
and one could sense a kind of urge to touch and
possess towards the end — which is one of those
primitive and magical survivals still with us in the
midst of our modern electronic culture.
