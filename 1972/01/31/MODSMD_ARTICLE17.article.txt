# Dillingham Asks For Delay
## 
### 
The Dillingham Corporation
has asked for a year's delay in
construction of a 17-story
300-room hotel at Palo Alto
Square at the corner of EI Camino
and Page Mill Road.
Corporation officials, citing the
fact that no developer has yet
agreed to construct the hotel,
petitioned the Palo Alto Planning
Commission last week to
postpone the deadline for
beginning construction, now set
for June 1973.
The controversial Palo Alto
Square, built on land leased from
Stanford, also includes two

high-rise office buildings, one now
occupied and the other nearing
competion, several smaller office
buildings, and two movie theatres.
Dillingham representatives told
city officials that they had
expected Holiday Inn to build the
hotel, but since that firm has
decided to build its hotel at the El
Cainino-University site about a
mile north, other developers are
reluctant to invest in a similar
facility which would be in direct
competition with the Holiday Inn.
The Holiday Inn development,
to contain 280 rooms in four
stories, has been referred to Palo

Alto voters, who will decide at the
June 6 primary election whether
to permit it.
A hearing on the Dillingham
request has been tentatively set
for March 22 before the Planning
Commission.
