# Demonstration Planned
## Open Hearing Set In Davis Trial 
### 
SAN JOSE (AP) — Black revolutionary
Angela Davis will appear in court here
today for arguments on four defense
motions attacking jury selection,
asking the state to pay defense costs
and to permit another move of her
murder-kidnap trial.
The National Defense Committee
for Angela Davis announced yesterday
that a demonstration in support of her
cause will be held outside the court
building beginning at 9 a.m. today.
The 28-year-old Communist and
former UCLA philosophy instructor
was scheduled to go on trial today on
murder, kidnaping and conspiracy
charges from the Aug. 7, 1970
shootout at the Marin County Civic
Center in which four persons died.
But the trial has been delayed to
hear the motions. The prosecution
estimates arguments will take two
weeks, but the defense says they may
take up to a month.
Young Jurors Possible
Meanwhile, it was learned that her
jury could include persons in the age
group between 18 and 20. They
become eligible for jury service on
March 4.
Superior Court Judge Richard E.

Arnason has ordered, and both the
prosecution and defense have
stipulated, that persons in that age
group should be on the jury panel.
"They probably couldn't be sworn
in as jurors until March 4," said the
chief prosecutor, Asst. Atty. Gen.
Albert W. Harris, "but we probably
won't have a jury picked by then
anyway."
A fund-raising dinner for her
defense was held at Stanford yesterday
afternoon, with about 150 people in
attendance. Franklin Alexander of the
National Committee spoke, as did
ASSU President Doug McHenry.
The trial was moved here from San
Rafael — scene of the shootout. The
defense now says widespread publicity
about the cost of the trial and security
expenses will prevent a fair trial in
Santa Clara County. So they have
asked that it be moved again.
Chief defense attorney Howard
Moore Jr. said he also has asked the
court to order payment of
"reasonable" expenses from public
funds for Davis' defense.
• The defense also has filed two
motions attacking selection of a jury
panel. Moore has expressed concern

about possible discrimination on the
basis of race, financial condition, sex
or ethics.
Palo Alto
Davis has been confined in the
North County Jail in Palo Alto while
workmen remodeled a section of the
main Santa Clara County Jail here for
her, and other women.
Officials say the new living quarters
are just about ready.
Davis will have her own cell with a

single bunk facing the frosted windows
of the exercise yard. Two other cells in
the section can accommodate two
women each. The women will be the
first female inmates there in nine
years.
She will also have a separate work
cell — 10 by 14 feet — where her
private television will be installed.
Another television set will be installed
on the wall of the corridor for use by
all the women inmates.

first female inmates there in nine
years.
She will also have a separate work
cell — 10 by 14 feet — where her
private television will be installed.
Another television set will be installed
on the wall of the corridor for use by
all the women inmates.
SAN JOSE (AP) — Black revolutionary
Angela Davis will appear in court here
today for arguments on four defense
motions attacking jury selection,
asking the state to pay defense costs
and to permit another move of her
murder-kidnap trial.
The National Defense Committee
for Angela Davis announced yesterday
that a demonstration in support of her
cause will be held outside the court
building beginning at 9 a.m. today.
The 28-year-old Communist and
former UCLA philosophy instructor
was scheduled to go on trial today on
murder, kidnaping and conspiracy
charges from the Aug. 7, 1970
shootout at the Marin County Civic
Center in which four persons died.
But the trial has been delayed to
hear the motions. The prosecution
estimates arguments will take two
weeks, but the defense says they may
take up to a month.
Young Jurors Possible
Meanwhile, it was learned that her
jury could include persons in the age
group between 18 and 20. They
become eligible for jury service on
March 4.
Superior Court Judge Richard E.

Arnason has ordered, and both the
prosecution and defense have
stipulated, that persons in that age
group should be on the jury panel.
"They probably couldn't be sworn
in as jurors until March 4," said the
chief prosecutor, Asst. Atty. Gen.
Albert W. Harris, "but we probably
won't have a jury picked by then
anyway."
A fund-raising dinner for her
defense was held at Stanford yesterday
afternoon, with about 150 people in
attendance. Franklin Alexander of the
National Committee spoke, as did
ASSU President Doug McHenry.
The trial was moved here from San
Rafael — scene of the shootout. The
defense now says widespread publicity
about the cost of the trial and security
expenses will prevent a fair trial in
Santa Clara County. So they have
asked that it be moved again.
Chief defense attorney Howard
Moore Jr. said he also has asked the
court to order payment of
"reasonable" expenses from public
funds for Davis' defense.
• The defense also has filed two
motions attacking selection of a jury
panel. Moore has expressed concern

about possible discrimination on the
basis of race, financial condition, sex
or ethics.
Palo Alto
Davis has been confined in the
North County Jail in Palo Alto while
workmen remodeled a section of the
main Santa Clara County Jail here for
her, and other women.
Officials say the new living quarters
are just about ready.
Davis will have her own cell with a

single bunk facing the frosted windows
of the exercise yard. Two other cells in
the section can accommodate two
women each. The women will be the
first female inmates there in nine
years.
She will also have a separate work
cell — 10 by 14 feet — where her
private television will be installed.
Another television set will be installed
on the wall of the corridor for use by
