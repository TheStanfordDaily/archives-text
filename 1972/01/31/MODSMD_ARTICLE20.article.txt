### BILL CLASTER 
In a game that was highlighted
by crowd favorite Jack Loomis'
first-half disqualification,
Stanford convincingly defeated
the Air Force Academy Falcons,
92-66.
The game was dull to the point
that Loomis' five quick fouls were
far and away the most exciting
part of the game. Stanford's
Loomis entered the game with
3:52 remaining in the first half
and earned his fifth foul with two
seconds to play in the half. Jack's
last three fouls occured in the last
38 seconds, and he was awarded a
standing ovation for his rather
dubious accomplishment.
Indians Control
As for the game, Stanford
remained in control throughout.
After Bob Buell took the opening
tip in for a lay-in, Claude Terry.
Mike Mann and Bob Nicholson
powered the Indians to a 48-31
lead.
Air Force closed the Indian
lead to ten midway through the
second half, but could never get
any closer. Stanford shot an
excellent 52% from the field, and

for one of the few times this
season were even with their
opponents in rebounding.
Claude Terry topped the Tribe
scoring with 24 points. He now
has 1342 for his career, and is
third in Stanford career scoring
behind Ron Tomsic and Tom
Dose.
Mann Hits 22
Mike Mann had a career high of
22 points, and was the dominating
force under both backboards. Bob
Nicholson added 15, and moved
his season's field goal mark to
56% with his six for eight
performance.
Dave Frost and Pat Rusco were
injured and did not suit up for the
game. They weren't needed
however, as Air Force was no
match for the Indians. The Falcon
offense was as unimaginative as
some of the Academy's policies,
and their whole style of play
reflected the discipline that is so
much a part of their lives. Air
Force rarely tried anything so
daring as a fast break, yet shot
only 37% from the field. They
played a very patterned brand of
basketball and really turned the
game into a very tedious affair.
