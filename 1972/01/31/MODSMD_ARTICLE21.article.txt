# Cards Prominent In Pro Draft Plans
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
The 1972 professional football
draft of college talent begins
tomorrow and a number of
Stanford players will figure highly
in the plans of the pros.
Ail-American linebacker Jeff
Siemon has been generally
considered to be the pros first
choice out of the Indian ranks. A
list of this year's top college
players compiled by expert
advisors to professional clubs may
contradict this opinion, however.
Carl and Pete Marasco annually
analyze the draft situation and
this year's prospectus, as
published in Pro P'ootball Weekly,
rates many other Indians highly.
The Marascos list Siemon as
the nation's third most desirable
linebacker behind Willie Hall of
USC and Mark Arneson of
Arizona. A solid pro prospect,
Siemon will undoubtedly be
drafted early in the first round,
but there is the chance that one of
his teammates may beat Siemon
out for the honor of being the
first Stanford player drafted.
Greg Sampson is rated as the
fourth best defensive end prospect
in the country behind the likes of
Walt Patulski of Notre Dame,
Larry Jacobson of Nebraska and
Colorado's Herb Orvis. Patulski is
favored to be the first pick in
tomorrow's draft, but Sampson is
very highly regarded and could go
in the first round ahead of
Siemon. Scouts were particularly

impressed by Sampson's excellent
play in the 1972 Rose Bowl.
Two other Thunder Chickens
received recognition by the
scouts. Pete Lazetich is rated
seventh among the nation's
defensive linemen and will also be
drafted in the early rounds. Larry
Butler is considered the 31st most
desirable lineman. Thus, all three
graduating Thunder Chickens will
probably have a reasonable chance
of playing pro ball.
Quarterback Don Bunce is
considered the sixth best pro
prospect with Florida's John
Reaves heading the list. Gil
Brandt, head scout for the Dallas
Cowboys, claims, however, that
"Watching that last drive in the
Rose Bowl, he looked like the No.
1 pick in the nation."
Indian offensive tackle Bill
Meyers is, in the Marascos
estimation, the seventh best pro
prospect for 1972. Tim Schallich
also received recognition by being
rated 22nd.
Halfback Jackie Brown's fine
performances in the Rose and
American Bowls impressed the
Marascos who placed him 19th on
a list headed by Jim Bertelson of
Texas. Surprisingly, fullback
Hillary Shockley, who left the
Stanford Rose Bowl camp three
days before the game, is
considered the 11th best fullback
in the country.
Benny Barnes was not

mentioned in the Marascos' list,
because he was listed on the
Stanford program as a junior and
many pro teams do not, know that
he is a senior and eligible for the
draft. If he is not picked, Barnes
can approach any pro team as a
free agent and should have a good
chance of making the squad.

Finally, Steve Jubb, star
offensive tackle in 1970 who did
not come out for the team his
senior year, was ranked 52nd as a
prospect. This is the second
dubious honor bestowed on Jubb,
who was honorable mention
all-conference for 1971, a year in
which he did not play.
