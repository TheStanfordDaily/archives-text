## 
### STAN WILSON 
Stanford's powerful freshman basketball team, led by center Rich
Kelley, produced two convincing victories over the weekend, beating
the San Jose State frosh 74-61, and a weak Cuesta College team
104-69. In the San Jose State game Kelly dominated both ends of the
court, scoring 23 points, grabbing 22 rebounds, and blocking 9 shots.
Ben Bluitt added 15 points for the frosh on Friday night.
Frosh coach Bub Bowling, stricken with the flu, consequently
missed Friday night's game. Still ailing, Bowling was back on Saturday
night to witness the frosh massacre of Cuesta College. The freshmen
made 59% of their shots on Saturday, as compared to 36% for Cuesta
College.
Again Kelly dominated the game, hitting on 10 of 12 field goal
attempts, and 7 of 7 from the free throw line, scoring 27 points with
apparently little effort. He also grabbed 15 rebounds, and played
intimidating defense under the basket. Also in double figures for the
frosh were, Mark Gilberg, with 14, Scott Trobbe, with 13, and Ben
Bluitt, with 12 points.
The frosh set the pace early in the game with a combination of
good shooting, rebounding, and a smooth fast break, with Kelley and
Gilberg doing most of the damage in the first half. Coach Bowling,
satisfied with the effort, explained that "we played very well." The
frosh built a convincing 54-27 lead by halftime and coasted to the
inevitable conclusion.
Stanford's pair of wins over the weekend upped their record to 9-2
for the season.
