Troops Kill 13 In Ulster
LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland — Thirteen civilians
were shot and killed yesterday in gunfire that erupted
when British paratroopers stormed a Roman Catholic
protest rally in order to grab rock-throwing youths,
authorities reported.
The deaths touched off outraged protest from some
Northern Irish leaders, who called the shootings an "awful
slaughter," and "mass murder."
The death toll was Londonderry's worst in more than
three years of communal strife pitting Roman Catholic
militants against Protestants ar.d the British soldiers sent
to restore order.
Hospital authorities reported 13 civilians killed and 16
others — including two women — treated for gunshot
wounds.
"We'll never forget it," vowed Bernadette Devlin, the
24-year-old civil rights leader and member of the British
Parliament. "We'll just have to continue the struggle to
end this savagery."
The gunfire erupted as about 3,000 marchers from
Roman Catholic districts gathered to hear an address by
Devlin at a protest rally held in defiance of a government
ban.
The army said paratroopers moved into the crowd to
snatch youngsters who were hurling rocks and bottles.
The soldiers came under a guerrilla sniper fire from a high
apartment block, officers reported, and the exchanges
began.
"At no time did any of our units open fire on the
British army prior to the army's opening fire," countered
a leader of the Irish Republican Army, the illegal guerrilla
group.
"The British army murdered innocent civilians in Derry
today," he added. "We leave the world to judge who are
the real terrorists."
The extremist Provisional wing of the IRA swore to
avenge the deaths.
White House Protest 'Planned'
LOS ANGELES — Carol Feraci said Saturday she
accepted a job with the Ray Coniff Singers at the White
House with the intention of making a peace
demonstration in front of President Nixon.
Feraci, 30, a Canadian citizen, denounced the Vietnam
War before an audience of 150 that included Nixon in the
East Room of the White House Friday night.
She was booed and Coniff asked her to leave the stage.
She flew back to her home in suburban Van Nuys
Saturday.
Just before the start of the program Feraci pulled from
her dress a cloth sign which read "Stop the killing."
She stepped to the front of the stage and addressed
Nixon sitting just below her. She said, "President Nixon,
stop bombing human beings, animals, and vegetation.
"You go to church on Sunday and pray to Jesus Christ.
If Jesus Christ was in this room tonight you would not
dare to drop another bomb. Bless the Berrigans and Daniel
Ellsberg."

She said a statement attributed to Martha Mitchell,
wife of Atty. Gen. John Mitchell, that she should be "torn
limb from limb" was "incredible."
The singing group appeared at a dinner in honor of
DeWitt and Lila Wallace, founders of the Reader's Digest.
The magazine is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary.
Cambodians Attack Moon
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Scores of Cambodian
soldiers blazed away at an eclipse of the moon with
automatic weapons last night. One person was reported
killed and at least 50 wounded.
The soldiers were trying to drive away Reahou, a
mythological monster that supposedly eats the moon
during an eclipse.
Tens of thousands of bullets and dozens of flares were
fired during the hour-long orgy of shooting. The sky was
lit by the flares and arcing tracer bullets.
Some of those injured apparently were hit by bullets
falling back to earth.
According to the legend, the monster — sometimes
described as a dragon and other times as a giant frog —
tries to eat the moon in revenge for having its head cut off
by the god Vishnu.
Dock Strike Talks Resume
SAN FRANCISCO — With West Coast docks virtually
sealed to commercial shipping, negotiators go back to the
bargaining table today for the first time since
longshoremen renewed the strike Jan. 17.
The International Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen's Union negotiating committee scheduled
a 10 a.m. meeting before going into session four hours
later with the employers' Pacific Maritime Association.
Federal mediators also will be there.
Although spokesmen would not comment officially,
union sources indicated they felt their position has been
strengthened by Saturday's extension of the dock tieup to
Canada's West Coast. Another factor was the picketing
that began Friday at the Mexican border and halted trucks
bringing cargo to California from ships diverted to
Ensenada, Mexico.
Meantime, the U.S. House of Representatives was
scheduled to start hearing Monday on a bill which would
order the 13,000 ILWU members back to work. It would
also set up a three-man arbitration board to impose a
settlement, effective for 18 months. Senate hearings on
similar proposed legislation began last week.
Pakistan Leaves Commonwealth
RAWALPINDI, Pakistan — Pakistan withdrew from the
British Commonwealth yesterday as President Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto said the world "will no longer use Pakistan as a
football."
Government officials said Pakistan left the organization
of former British colonies after learning that two
Commonwealth nations, New Zealand and Australia, plan
to recognize Bangladesh today.

Cambodians Attack Moon
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Scores of Cambodian
soldiers blazed away at an eclipse of the moon with
automatic weapons last night. One person was reported
killed and at least 50 wounded.
The soldiers were trying to drive away Reahou, a
mythological monster that supposedly eats the moon
during an eclipse.
Tens of thousands of bullets and dozens of flares were
fired during the hour-long orgy of shooting. The sky was
lit by the flares and arcing tracer bullets.
Some of those injured apparently were hit by bullets
falling back to earth.
According to the legend, the monster — sometimes
described as a dragon and other times as a giant frog —
tries to eat the moon in revenge for having its head cut off
by the god Vishnu.
Dock Strike Talks Resume
SAN FRANCISCO — With West Coast docks virtually
sealed to commercial shipping, negotiators go back to the
bargaining table today for the first time since
longshoremen renewed the strike Jan. 17.
The International Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen's Union negotiating committee scheduled
a 10 a.m. meeting before going into session four hours
later with the employers' Pacific Maritime Association.
Federal mediators also will be there.
Although spokesmen would not comment officially,
union sources indicated they felt their position has been
strengthened by Saturday's extension of the dock tieup to
Canada's West Coast. Another factor was the picketing
that began Friday at the Mexican border and halted trucks
bringing cargo to California from ships diverted to
Ensenada, Mexico.
Meantime, the U.S. House of Representatives was
scheduled to start hearing Monday on a bill which would
order the 13,000 ILWU members back to work. It would
also set up a three-man arbitration board to impose a
settlement, effective for 18 months. Senate hearings on
similar proposed legislation began last week.
Pakistan Leaves Commonwealth
RAWALPINDI, Pakistan — Pakistan withdrew from the
British Commonwealth yesterday as President Zulfikar Ali

football."
Government officials said Pakistan left the organization
of former British colonies after learning that two
Commonwealth nations, New Zealand and Australia, plan
to recognize Bangladesh today.
Troops Kill 13 In Ulster
LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland — Thirteen civilians
were shot and killed yesterday in gunfire that erupted
when British paratroopers stormed a Roman Catholic
protest rally in order to grab rock-throwing youths,
authorities reported.
The deaths touched off outraged protest from some
Northern Irish leaders, who called the shootings an "awful
slaughter," and "mass murder."
The death toll was Londonderry's worst in more than
three years of communal strife pitting Roman Catholic
militants against Protestants ar.d the British soldiers sent
to restore order.
Hospital authorities reported 13 civilians killed and 16
others — including two women — treated for gunshot
wounds.
"We'll never forget it," vowed Bernadette Devlin, the
24-year-old civil rights leader and member of the British
Parliament. "We'll just have to continue the struggle to
end this savagery."
The gunfire erupted as about 3,000 marchers from
Roman Catholic districts gathered to hear an address by
Devlin at a protest rally held in defiance of a government
ban.
The army said paratroopers moved into the crowd to
snatch youngsters who were hurling rocks and bottles.
The soldiers came under a guerrilla sniper fire from a high
apartment block, officers reported, and the exchanges
began.
"At no time did any of our units open fire on the
British army prior to the army's opening fire," countered
a leader of the Irish Republican Army, the illegal guerrilla
group.
"The British army murdered innocent civilians in Derry
today," he added. "We leave the world to judge who are
the real terrorists."
The extremist Provisional wing of the IRA swore to
avenge the deaths.
