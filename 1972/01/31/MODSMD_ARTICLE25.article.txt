School vandalism and theft, as
common in "nice areas" as in ghettoes,
cost California taxpayers $50 million
in the five years before 1970, says a
Stanford Research Institute expert.
"You can understand why the
problem exists in poor
neighborhoods," said Dr. Bernard
Greenberg, "but that doesn't explain
why it occurs in Palo Alto and
Woodside."
Dr. Greenberg said the breakdown
by a consulting firm's report to the
legislature explained the $50 million
cost this way:
Direct acts of vandalism cost $22.1
million. Insurance against just such
acts cost another $18 million, and $1U
million was spent on security systems,
repairs, and losses due to theft.

Two armed men robbed the
residents of trailer 9Y in Manzanita
Park of $55, Saturday night at 7:10
p.m. The thieves ripped out the
telephone cord and ordered the
occupants to empty their pockets of
money before searching the trailer.
The two men, described as being 18
to 22 years old, gained entry into the
trailer with their 22 caliber revolver

drawn, saying, "This is a stick-up."
Both of the robbers were black
males. One was 5'9" and weighed
about 160 pounds. His partner was
about 5'7" weighing 150.
The robbery ended at 7:20 p.m.
when the armed men left saying,
"Don't stick your head out this door
unless you want to lose it." None of
the victims was harmed during the
incident.
five minutes before the robbery
occured, one of the men knocked on
the door of the trailer and asked,
"Does John live here?" One resident
said that he did not.
According to Santa Clara County
Sheriffs Deputies, who are now
responding to one or two armed
robberies per week on the Stanford
campus, this is a common mode of
operation.

Several academic buildings on the
Quad were vandalized by spray
painters Friday night. At least some
damage occurred inside the buildings.
The spray painting apparently
occurred between 10:00 and 11:00
p.m. Both Stanford and Santa Clara

County Sheriff's officers answered
calls.
However, the Stanford station told
the Daily yesterday that the Santa
Clara officers handled the vandalism,
while the Santa Clara Sheriff's Office
reported that it had "no record" of
the incident, and suggested that
Stanford was handling the
investigation.
Damage was reported inside the
math, law, history, and geology
buildings, among others. Messages
scrawled in orange paint included,
"Rehire Bruce," "Fire Shockley," and
"Off DoD."
Due to the apparent confusion
between law enforcement agencies, no
cost estimate of damage was available
yesterday.
