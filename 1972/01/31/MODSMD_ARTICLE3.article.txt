Hearings have been scheduled at
9:30 a.m. this Friday for four students
charged with violations of the campus
disruption policy for their part in
November, 1971 Placement Center
demonstrations against Honeywell,
Inc. recruiters.
According to Campus Judicial Panel
chairman John Kaplan, the hearings
will be held in the Forum Room of
Meyer Library, and will be conducted
by Lillian Altree, a law professor at
the University of Santa Clara.
The hearings, to determine the facts
of the case, will be open, unless
Kaplan and the defendants agree to
hold them in private. Defendants Paul
Loeb, Pete Knutson, Steve Downey,
and Don Lee apparently will be tried
together, unless one or more moves to
sever his case from that of the others.
Kaplan said he has sent a list to the
defendants of law students willing to
act as defense counsel.
In a related action, Assistant to the
President John Schwartz, who
prosecutes CJP cases for the
University, has indicated he will charge

professor who advocates controversial

theories relating race to intelligence;
sit-ins at the Old Union on January 24
and 25; a disruptive mill-in at the
Placement Center on January 26,
which interfered with interviews

Schwartz said he does not expect to
file charges against students who
disrupted classes other than
Shockley's, or against any of about 35
people who interrupted a Faculty Club
lunch on Thursday.
