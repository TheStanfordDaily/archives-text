# Faculty Club Visited
## 
### 
For the third time in a week
protesters from the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement (SRM)
visited the Faculty Club Friday to
protest the firing of Bruce Franklin.
They were barred from entering the
dining area, as they had done at noon
Thursday, by Club Manager Forest
Tregea, Chief Chef Arturo Lionetti
and Stanford Police Director Marvin
Herrington.
After a singing group calling itself
"Sandy and the Dorn Bushers"
performed, the protesters moved
towards the entrance to the dining
room. Tregea told them "this is for
members only and I'm asking you to
leave."

Lionetti guided several guests
through the crowd saying "I'm sorry
about this disturbance." From the
very beginning of the protest, Stanford
police photographers took pictures of
the protesters, who eventually began
to hold newspapers and leaflets in
front of the cameras.
One photographer ripped down
several of the papers and said to a
protester "don't you stick that in
front of me — you'd better be
careful." Third World Liberation
Front member Kwonping Ho then
moved close to the entrance of the
dining area with a portable sound
system to read a statement.
As Ho began, John Troxell,
Professor Emeritus of Industrial
Relations at the Graduate School of
Business (GSB), shouted angrily, "you
put that down! You turn that down!"
Herrington restrained Troxell, telling
him, "I'll take care of it."
Explaining the three protests at the
Faculty Club, Ho said "we are here to
challenge the faculty to drop its
extracurricular tradition of cowardice
and end the hypocrisy of espousing
fine moral principles."
Ho said he wished to also retract a
statement he made at the Club
Thursday in which he said "we should
have torn the whole place apart."
