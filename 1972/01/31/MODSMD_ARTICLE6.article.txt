## Apathy Prevails In Election Year 
### JIM FRIEND News Analysis 
With the New Hampshire primary
little over a month away activity in
support of electoral politics here at
Stanford appears slow and
unenthusiastic.
[There are some understandable
reasons for this lethargic attitude and
the present activity doesn't necessarily

mean poor student involvement as the
campaign gets underway.]
At present only McGovern, Muskie,
and McCloskey have any organized
channels of support on campus, and
these groups can claim but a few active
participants. "Call me later" seems to
be the pervasive attitude.
After all, New Hampshire is 3,000
miles from Stanford and one might
suspect that any direct participation in
the first primary would be minimal.
Since the campaign is in such an early
stage and the field of Democratic
candidates so broad, most students are
waiting to see the results of the early
primaries in New Hampshire, Florida,
and Wisconsin. These results will
largely affect the decisions that will be
made at the national conventions this
summer.
Anti-Nixon Mood
As students wait, one thing appears
reasonably certain: anti-Nixon
sentiment at Stanford is widespread.
"Nobody is terribly excited about any
Democrat" concedes a McGovern
worker, "but Nixon just has to be
beaten." Registration drives on
campus at the beginning of the year
revealed that well over 70 percent of
the students registered Democratic.
Moreover, it is likely that many who
registered Republican did so in order
to vote for Pete McCloskey if he ran in
the California primary .
Senator George McGovern is
probably the most popular candidate
on campuses across the country,
including Stanford (see related article
on campus poll). The problem is, as
Bob Grant of the Muskie campaign
puts it, that "he'll never get the
nomination."
This apparent truism may be the
key to future electoral activity at
Stanford. While many McGovern
advocates hold that their candidate is
the only real leftist who has a chance
at the nomination, they generally
concede that his chances are slim.
Grant feels that as this becomes
increasingly evident McGovern
supporters will join the Muskie ranks.
A McGovern worker hints that if a
"conservative" Democrat "like
Muskie, Humphrey, or Jackson" gets
the nomination, "the students may sit
this one out." Grant disagrees on this
poir>t. Third party interest, he says, is
on the decline and anti-Nixon
sentiment is rampant. Nixon "can
clearly be beaten," he contends, and
feels this will be the overriding factor

in winning support for Muskie.
Republican Candidates
Present campus activity for
Republican candidates other than
Congressman McCloskey, is
nonexistent. Opposition to Nixon
within his own party is being waged
from the left by McCloskey and from
the right by the entrance into the New
Hampshire primary of Representative
John Ashbrook of Ohio. Only
McCloskey has any organized support
at Stanford.
Neither of these campaigns seems
to be taken with much seriousness by
the groups most likely to support
Nixon.
Young Republican spokesman Noel
Casey says his group "will support
whoever is nominated by the
Republican National Convention,"
implying that Nixon is all but
nominated.
McCloskey supporters are
considerably more serious about the
anti-Nixon movement within the
Republican party. A spokesman for
that group feels certain that
McCloskey will receive "at least 20
percent" of the New Hampshire

primary vote.
Few McCloskey workers are very
serious, however, about the possibility
of their candidate actually wresting
the nomination from the President. If
Nixon is nominated, campus
supporters of McCloskey will probably
find it difficult to join the Nixon
forces.
18-Year Old Vote
One thing that all groups
acknowledge will play an important
role at Stanford in the 1972
Presidential campaign is the
18-year-old vote. Both national parties
are quite aware that the newly
enfranchised youth could determine
the outcome in November.
Equally aware are the various
political groups on campus. Their
emphasis at this time is largely to
register as many young people as they
can and attempt to elect as many
young delegates of their persuasion as
possible to the national conventions.
"If students turn out in significant
numbers" Grant says of the 1972
campaign, "and vote largely
Democratic as we expect them to, we
might win this election."

nomination."
This apparent truism may be the
key to future electoral activity at
Stanford. While many McGovern
advocates hold that their candidate is
the only real leftist who has a chance
at the nomination, they generally
concede that his chances are slim.
Grant feels that as this becomes
increasingly evident McGovern
supporters will join the Muskie ranks.
A McGovern worker hints that if a
"conservative" Democrat "like
Muskie, Humphrey, or Jackson" gets
the nomination, "the students may sit
this one out." Grant disagrees on this
poir>t. Third party interest, he says, is
on the decline and anti-Nixon
sentiment is rampant. Nixon "can
clearly be beaten," he contends, and
feels this will be the overriding factor

in winning support for Muskie.
Republican Candidates
Present campus activity for
Republican candidates other than
Congressman McCloskey, is
nonexistent. Opposition to Nixon
within his own party is being waged
from the left by McCloskey and from
the right by the entrance into the New
Hampshire primary of Representative
John Ashbrook of Ohio. Only
McCloskey has any organized support
at Stanford.
Neither of these campaigns seems
to be taken with much seriousness by
the groups most likely to support
Nixon.
Young Republican spokesman Noel
Casey says his group "will support
whoever is nominated by the
Republican National Convention,"
implying that Nixon is all but
nominated.
McCloskey supporters are
considerably more serious about the
anti-Nixon movement within the
Republican party. A spokesman for
that group feels certain that
McCloskey will receive "at least 20
percent" of the New Hampshire

primary vote.
Few McCloskey workers are very
serious, however, about the possibility
of their candidate actually wresting
the nomination from the President. If
Nixon is nominated, campus
supporters of McCloskey will probably
find it difficult to join the Nixon
forces.
18-Year Old Vote
One thing that all groups
acknowledge will play an important
role at Stanford in the 1972
Presidential campaign is the
18-year-old vote. Both national parties
are quite aware that the newly
enfranchised youth could determine
the outcome in November.
Equally aware are the various
political groups on campus. Their
emphasis at this time is largely to
register as many young people as they
can and attempt to elect as many
young delegates of their persuasion as
possible to the national conventions.
"If students turn out in significant
numbers" Grant says of the 1972
campaign, "and vote largely
Democratic as we expect them to, we
might win this election."
With the New Hampshire primary
little over a month away activity in
support of electoral politics here at
Stanford appears slow and
unenthusiastic.
[There are some understandable
reasons for this lethargic attitude and
the present activity doesn't necessarily

mean poor student involvement as the
campaign gets underway.]
At present only McGovern, Muskie,
and McCloskey have any organized
channels of support on campus, and
these groups can claim but a few active
participants. "Call me later" seems to
be the pervasive attitude.
After all, New Hampshire is 3,000
miles from Stanford and one might
suspect that any direct participation in
the first primary would be minimal.
Since the campaign is in such an early
stage and the field of Democratic
candidates so broad, most students are
waiting to see the results of the early
primaries in New Hampshire, Florida,
and Wisconsin. These results will
largely affect the decisions that will be
made at the national conventions this
summer.
Anti-Nixon Mood
As students wait, one thing appears
reasonably certain: anti-Nixon
sentiment at Stanford is widespread.
"Nobody is terribly excited about any
Democrat" concedes a McGovern
worker, "but Nixon just has to be
beaten." Registration drives on
campus at the beginning of the year
revealed that well over 70 percent of
the students registered Democratic.
Moreover, it is likely that many who
registered Republican did so in order
to vote for Pete McCloskey if he ran in
the California primary .
Senator George McGovern is
probably the most popular candidate
on campuses across the country,
including Stanford (see related article
on campus poll). The problem is, as
Bob Grant of the Muskie campaign
puts it, that "he'll never get the
nomination."
This apparent truism may be the
key to future electoral activity at
Stanford. While many McGovern
advocates hold that their candidate is
the only real leftist who has a chance
at the nomination, they generally
concede that his chances are slim.
