# McGovern Wins Poll
## 
### 
According to a recent campus poll v
Senator George McGovern is the
choice of Stanford students for
President of the United States.
McGovern outpolled Senator Edmund
Muskie more than 2 to 1 in a
presidential preference poll taken at
five campus locations Thursday.
President Nixon placed third and
Rep. Shirley Chisholm (D-N.Y.) was
the fourth choice of the 1,313
respondents.
In response to the question "Do
you favor amnesty for those who have
refused military induction and have
gone to jail rather than serve in the
war in Vietnam?" over 90 percent
answered yes.
The poll was taken by members of
McGovern, Muskie, and Youth Caucus
groups on campus. Of the respondents
577 were Democrats, 438
Independents, 193 Republicans, 41
Peace and Freedom, and 50 others.
Polltaker Jonathan Aronson, a
graduate student in political science,
said he "expected McGovern to poll

above the others" but added he was
"surprised that it was by two to one."
Aronson also found Nixon's strength
unexpected.
Aronson thinks the poll reflects
widespread support for McGovern
which could only become active if the
South Dakota Senator were to score
victories in the New Hampshire,
Florida, and Wisconsin primaries.
Following are the results to the
question "Who would you most like to
