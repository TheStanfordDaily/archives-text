## Liberalism: A Depressing Theme 
### 
Phil trounstine

Larry Diamond's article,
"Facile Slogans Produce Few
Results," is an important one for
us all to understand for it exposes
the weaknesses of liberalism and
lays bare Mr. Diamond's
opportunism.
The first point Diamond makes
is that he has noted a "profoundly
depressing theme" in the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement. He
declares that the raising of
"simple slogans and impulsive
cliches" are antithetical to
engaging in "serious tactics." He
seems to overlook such "simple
slogans" as "End All Classified
Research," "Off ROTC," "Shut it
Down," "Do It To It,"and "Pigs
Off Campus," all of which have
synthesized the thoughts and
actions of particular phases of the
Stanford student movement, and
a number of which have proved,
in practice, to give rise to very
"serious" and more importantly,
effective tactics. One might
suppose that Diamond would have
considered these movements
equally depressing.
Digging a little deeper, we find

that Mr. Diamond believes that
Bruce Franklin should be rehired
because he was fired for holding a
certain political philosophy. But if
you listen to Bruce and think
about it for a while, you find that
this isn't the reason Bruce was
fired. Bruce has stated many times
that he was fired because he is a
communist revolutionary. That
doesn't mean that he's an
armchair "Marxist." Mr. Diamond
seems to be upholding the split
between mind and body, thought
and action, that Stanford
University so desperately wants to
maintain.
For, once you separate thought
from action, you have to wind up
saying that Shockley should be
allowed and encouraged to teach
at Stanford so that "academic
freedom" will prevail. In fact,
isn't someone's "academic
freedom" being denied when war
recruiters are chased off campus?
It's only because thoughts arise
from social action and in turn are
put into practice, that we
understand anything at all.
Bruce's thoughts are not harmless

because they are connected to
social practice. The same is true
for Shockley. The question is,
"Which side are you on?"
Struggle
It is fine if Mr. Diamond hopes
to struggle for "acadcmic
freedom" but he must not sit
back and attack his allies. If he
believes that court action or
student hiring of Bruce Franklin
are the best courses of action,
more power to him. These are
important steps to be taken. But
don't tell everybody else they
belong in jail, because those
people are taking concrete action,
based on their analysis of
Stanford and U.S. imperialism,
and they won't take that shit for
long.
The freedom they are after is
not academic. The ruling class in
general, and the Board of Trustees
in particular, have never done
what the people want until they
have been forced to do so—not by
their courts, but because it was
too costly for them to hold back
the wheels of history any longer.
Witness SRI, AEL and ROTC.
Once the people start moving at
Stanford, someone invariably
comes forward who has been
treading water all year, to claim to
speak for the "Stanford
community" (though they seldom

even know a single Stanford
worker) in opposing the "tactics
(but not the goals, mind you)" of
the movement.
These people inevitably isolate
themselves by proclaiming this
sit-in to be okay while that one is
a threat to the community. But
for a short while some people
listen to this opportunism and are
confused by the mixture of truth
and un-truth. Fortunately, very
few people are confused by Mr.
Diamond's attacks on the
movement, at present, and it
appears he is speaking only for
himself.
Depressing
But what else is he saying? It's
a shame to have to inform him
that underneath all his talk about
students controlling the
university's land use policies and
resources, runs a rather depressing
theme. In fact, there is a facile
slogan that sums up his position
rather well. It's "Student Power."
The trouble with it is that when
the students leave after four years,
the decisions that they have made,
for the workers, for the
surrounding communities and for
the people of the Third World, go
on effecting those people.
Wouldn't it make more sense, Mr.
Diamond, if the people whose
lives are involved most directly,

had some say in the matter?
One final point. It's very true
what Diamond says when he
states that "the most effective
way to get Stanford out of
Southeast Asia is to get America
out of Southeast Asia." But sadly,
Diamond concludes that people
should "elect a President and a
Congress that will put military
priorities below the human and
environmental needs of this
country" (echoes of R. Lyman?).
He fails to understand what more
and more people on and around
Stanford have been finding out.
That U.S. imperialism is NOT a
policy that some evil politicians
are implementing. It is in fact the
economic system that is the basis
of the United States.
As people come to this
understanding, they find that the
student movement is part of a
world-wide struggle against a small
clique of white men, backed up
by armies and police forces.
Surely Mr. Diamond would not
tell the Vietnamese that they are
"endangering the community and
belong in jail." Or would he?

slogan that sums up his position
rather well. It's "Student Power."
The trouble with it is that when
the students leave after four years,
the decisions that they have made,
for the workers, for the
surrounding communities and for
the people of the Third World, go
on effecting those people.
Wouldn't it make more sense, Mr.
Diamond, if the people whose
lives are involved most directly,

had some say in the matter?
One final point. It's very true
what Diamond says when he
states that "the most effective
way to get Stanford out of
Southeast Asia is to get America
out of Southeast Asia." But sadly,
Diamond concludes that people
should "elect a President and a
Congress that will put military
priorities below the human and
environmental needs of this
country" (echoes of R. Lyman?).
He fails to understand what more
and more people on and around
Stanford have been finding out.
That U.S. imperialism is NOT a
policy that some evil politicians
are implementing. It is in fact the
economic system that is the basis
of the United States.
As people come to this
understanding, they find that the
student movement is part of a
world-wide struggle against a small
clique of white men, backed up
by armies and police forces.
Surely Mr. Diamond would not
tell the Vietnamese that they are
"endangering the community and
belong in jail." Or would he?

Larry Diamond's article,
"Facile Slogans Produce Few
Results," is an important one for
us all to understand for it exposes
the weaknesses of liberalism and
lays bare Mr. Diamond's
opportunism.
The first point Diamond makes
is that he has noted a "profoundly
depressing theme" in the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement. He
declares that the raising of
"simple slogans and impulsive
cliches" are antithetical to
engaging in "serious tactics." He
seems to overlook such "simple
slogans" as "End All Classified
Research," "Off ROTC," "Shut it
Down," "Do It To It,"and "Pigs
Off Campus," all of which have
synthesized the thoughts and
actions of particular phases of the
Stanford student movement, and
a number of which have proved,
in practice, to give rise to very
"serious" and more importantly,
effective tactics. One might
suppose that Diamond would have
considered these movements
equally depressing.
Digging a little deeper, we find

that Mr. Diamond believes that
Bruce Franklin should be rehired
because he was fired for holding a
certain political philosophy. But if
you listen to Bruce and think
about it for a while, you find that
this isn't the reason Bruce was
fired. Bruce has stated many times
that he was fired because he is a
communist revolutionary. That
doesn't mean that he's an
armchair "Marxist." Mr. Diamond
seems to be upholding the split
between mind and body, thought
and action, that Stanford
University so desperately wants to
maintain.
For, once you separate thought
from action, you have to wind up
saying that Shockley should be
allowed and encouraged to teach
at Stanford so that "academic
freedom" will prevail. In fact,
isn't someone's "academic
freedom" being denied when war
recruiters are chased off campus?
It's only because thoughts arise
from social action and in turn are
put into practice, that we
understand anything at all.
Bruce's thoughts are not harmless

because they are connected to
social practice. The same is true
for Shockley. The question is,
"Which side are you on?"
Struggle
It is fine if Mr. Diamond hopes
to struggle for "acadcmic
freedom" but he must not sit
back and attack his allies. If he
believes that court action or
student hiring of Bruce Franklin
are the best courses of action,
more power to him. These are
important steps to be taken. But
don't tell everybody else they
belong in jail, because those
people are taking concrete action,
based on their analysis of
Stanford and U.S. imperialism,
and they won't take that shit for
long.
The freedom they are after is
not academic. The ruling class in
general, and the Board of Trustees
in particular, have never done
what the people want until they
have been forced to do so—not by
their courts, but because it was
too costly for them to hold back
the wheels of history any longer.
Witness SRI, AEL and ROTC.
Once the people start moving at
Stanford, someone invariably
comes forward who has been
treading water all year, to claim to
speak for the "Stanford
community" (though they seldom

even know a single Stanford
worker) in opposing the "tactics
(but not the goals, mind you)" of
the movement.
These people inevitably isolate
themselves by proclaiming this
sit-in to be okay while that one is
a threat to the community. But
for a short while some people
listen to this opportunism and are
confused by the mixture of truth
and un-truth. Fortunately, very
few people are confused by Mr.
Diamond's attacks on the
movement, at present, and it
appears he is speaking only for
himself.
Depressing
But what else is he saying? It's
a shame to have to inform him
that underneath all his talk about
students controlling the
university's land use policies and
resources, runs a rather depressing
theme. In fact, there is a facile
slogan that sums up his position
rather well. It's "Student Power."
The trouble with it is that when
the students leave after four years,

based on their analysis of
Stanford and U.S. imperialism,
and they won't take that shit for
long.
The freedom they are after is
not academic. The ruling class in
general, and the Board of Trustees

the wheels of history any longer.
Witness SRI, AEL and ROTC.
Once the people start moving at
Stanford, someone invariably
comes forward who has been
treading water all year, to claim to
speak for the "Stanford
community" (though they seldom

even know a single Stanford
worker) in opposing the "tactics
(but not the goals, mind you)" of
the movement.
These people inevitably isolate
themselves by proclaiming this
sit-in to be okay while that one is
a threat to the community. But
for a short while some people
listen to this opportunism and are
confused by the mixture of truth
and un-truth. Fortunately, very
few people are confused by Mr.
Diamond's attacks on the
movement, at present, and it
appears he is speaking only for
himself.
Depressing
But what else is he saying? It's
a shame to have to inform him
that underneath all his talk about
students controlling the
university's land use policies and
resources, runs a rather depressing
theme. In fact, there is a facile
slogan that sums up his position
rather well. It's "Student Power."
The trouble with it is that when
the students leave after four years,
the decisions that they have made,
for the workers, for the
surrounding communities and for
the people of the Third World, go
on effecting those people.
Wouldn't it make more sense, Mr.
Diamond, if the people whose
lives are involved most directly,

had some say in the matter?
One final point. It's very true
what Diamond says when he
states that "the most effective
way to get Stanford out of
Southeast Asia is to get America
out of Southeast Asia." But sadly,
Diamond concludes that people
should "elect a President and a
Congress that will put military
priorities below the human and
environmental needs of this
country" (echoes of R. Lyman?).
He fails to understand what more
and more people on and around
Stanford have been finding out.
That U.S. imperialism is NOT a
policy that some evil politicians
are implementing. It is in fact the
economic system that is the basis
of the United States.
As people come to this
understanding, they find that the
student movement is part of a
world-wide struggle against a small
clique of white men, backed up
by armies and police forces.
Surely Mr. Diamond would not
tell the Vietnamese that they are
"endangering the community and
belong in jail." Or would he?

Larry Diamond's article,
"Facile Slogans Produce Few
Results," is an important one for
us all to understand for it exposes
the weaknesses of liberalism and
lays bare Mr. Diamond's
opportunism.
The first point Diamond makes
is that he has noted a "profoundly
depressing theme" in the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement. He
declares that the raising of
"simple slogans and impulsive
cliches" are antithetical to
engaging in "serious tactics." He
seems to overlook such "simple
slogans" as "End All Classified
Research," "Off ROTC," "Shut it
Down," "Do It To It,"and "Pigs
Off Campus," all of which have
synthesized the thoughts and
actions of particular phases of the
Stanford student movement, and
a number of which have proved,
in practice, to give rise to very
"serious" and more importantly,
effective tactics. One might
suppose that Diamond would have
considered these movements
equally depressing.
Digging a little deeper, we find

that Mr. Diamond believes that
Bruce Franklin should be rehired
because he was fired for holding a
certain political philosophy. But if
you listen to Bruce and think
about it for a while, you find that
this isn't the reason Bruce was
fired. Bruce has stated many times
that he was fired because he is a
communist revolutionary. That
doesn't mean that he's an
armchair "Marxist." Mr. Diamond
seems to be upholding the split
between mind and body, thought
and action, that Stanford
University so desperately wants to
maintain.
For, once you separate thought
from action, you have to wind up
saying that Shockley should be
allowed and encouraged to teach
at Stanford so that "academic
freedom" will prevail. In fact,
isn't someone's "academic
freedom" being denied when war
recruiters are chased off campus?
It's only because thoughts arise
from social action and in turn are
put into practice, that we
understand anything at all.
Bruce's thoughts are not harmless

because they are connected to
social practice. The same is true
for Shockley. The question is,
"Which side are you on?"
Struggle
It is fine if Mr. Diamond hopes
to struggle for "acadcmic
freedom" but he must not sit
back and attack his allies. If he
believes that court action or
student hiring of Bruce Franklin
are the best courses of action,
more power to him. These are
important steps to be taken. But
don't tell everybody else they
belong in jail, because those
people are taking concrete action,
based on their analysis of
Stanford and U.S. imperialism,
and they won't take that shit for
long.
The freedom they are after is
