# Beauty Queens At Stanford View Their Roles

A glittering crown atop her head
and the winner's sash affixed to her
white evening gown, Jackie Benington
paraded before a nationwide television
audience as America's Junior Miss
1969.
Two years later-the roses and fixed
smiles long-since faded away—the
Stanford junior donned a beat-up
army jacket and locked arms with a
group of Women's Liberationists who
picketed the California state pageant.
Benington was one of the quarter
million plus girls who enter formal
beauty pageants in the United States
each year. A great many of this
competitive, acheivement-oriented
group end up in the finest colleges. In
addition to Benington, Stanford can
boast of five state Junior Misses, a Miss

Ingenue, a Rose Festival Queen, a Miss
Boston, a Miss Watts, an Apple
Blossom Princess and countless other
"Misses" and assorted Homecoming
Queens.
Debbie Doepel, a Director of
Admissions and a former high school
beauty queen herself, says that
Stanford attracts the out-going girls
who are active in extra-curricular
activities. "Those are the girls who
seem to go out for beauty pageants,"
she stated.
Once at Stanford the "Misses" are
sure to come under attack from
Women's Liberationists who view
beauty pageants as "sexist cattle
shows." Benington, a staunch
supporter of Women's Liberation
admits: "I couldn't justify my
participation in a beauty pageant, but

this was not strictly a glamour contest
per se, and I entered for the large
scholarship. I feel like I prostituted
myself in a small sense. I guess I just
had to compromise myself to achieve
my goal of continuing school."
Few are as remorseful as Benington.
Jill Kostenko, Miss Santa Cruz 1969,
who also compete for Miss Teen Santa
Cruz, Junior Miss of Santa Cruz
County and Miss California during her
beauty career, looks upon competing
as "a way to get on stage and be seen."
Indeed, a contestant often has to
subject herself to wolf-whistles and
ogling glances as she passes the judges'
scrutiny in swimsuit. Kostenko said
this phase of the competition didn't
really bother her since she had been a
pom pon girl in high school and had
worn much skimpier costumes. "A
bathing suit doesn't show anything
anyway," she replied.
Sophomore Laurie King, the first
Oriental to be crowned queen of the
Portland Rose Festival, said she
entered to win the recognition of her
parents. Her family thought of her
participation as a class activity . . . "it
helped me get into Stanford," added
Laurie.
King's sentiments were not with the
Women's Liberationist who picketed
her coronation. She countered their
charge that it was a beauty pageant by
emphasizing the points alloted to
personality and speaking ability.
"Any girl would like to be the Rose
Queen," she charged. "How could
they not like getting their picture in
the paper, a $1,000 wardrobe and a
$500 scholarship?"
King attributes attacks on the
Portland Rose Festival by high school
students to the "pseudo
sophistication" of youth today. She
says that they tend to put down all
that is old and traditional.
Ann Hayaski, Miss San Joaquin
County 1970, says that competing in
the Miss California Pageant was "the
high point of my life." The San
Joaquin title was worth $2,000 in

scholarships, modeling lessons and
clothing.
"I never went into this thing with a
Prima-Donna feeling," Hayashi
remarked. "I was going to do my best
for the county and I felt no one could
ask more of me."
The Stanford sophomore admits
that she sometimes felt she was selling
a piece of meat. While one must be
aesthetically pleasing to win such a
contest, Ann insists that true beauty is
not physical—"it is inner!"
Women's Liberationists attack
beauty pageants because they
legitimize checking out a girl on a
strictly physical level. "You can find
that anywhere," Hayashi contends, "in
modeling, commercials,
cheerleading . . . that is how society is
structured." She says entrants in the
Miss America preliminaries are true
representatives of the current
generation of American women. They
are proof that women are not
subservient, harried-blonde types.
Santra Bern, a professor of
psychology and proponent of the
power of a nonconscious ideology,
says beauty pageants "are symbolic of
the sex-object identity we see women
as having. It bothers me'that we think
of girls in terms of the body ... we
don't judge men by these standards."
She questions the justification in
rewarding a "built-in-at-birth
characteristic" such as physical
beauty.
America's Junior Miss Pageant has
no judging of beauty per se. Instead
the entrants are graded on talent,
poise, composure, grace, scholarship,
and clarity. Benington views straight
"beauty" pageants as "useless and
degrading" and contends that she
would not be so presumptous as to
enter one.
The judges of the Junior Miss
Pageant are looking for a well-rounded
individual—one who exhibits a winning
combination. To attract the
"All-American-type" girl, the pageant
bills itself as "The Pageant That Every

Father Would Want His Daughter to
Enter."
Winning the national title saddled
Benington with the "Daddy's Little
Girl" image and the obligation to
spread goodwill for the pageant.
She was sent on a cross-country
tour to lend her glamour and publicity
to countless public service projects. "I
expected more out of myself than I
think they expected out of me," she
said. "They had me participate in so
many events that 1 got kind of a
complex that I short-changed the
programs in which I was asked to
participate."
A former Apple Blossom Princess
Laura Simon sees her position as a
Stanford Dollie to be nothing more
than a job. Simon admits that "guys
are impressed when they find out I am

a Stanford dollie." She objects
strongly to being called a "plastic
dollie" however, saying "that's just a
stereotype and I'm definitely not a
plastic person."
Miss Santa Cruz 1969, Jill
Kostenko, contends that she is
"pleased and proud" that she went out
for pageants. Admitting that "I've
never lacked a boyfriend once they
find out I was a beauty queen," Jill
even goes so far as to say that "guys
will brag about me being a queen."
Even though these two girls seem
content to be stereotyped by some as
"escapist and irrelevant" in their quest
for beauty queen status, many girls
seem to be shying away from the
beauty queen trip. High school girls
more often than not comprise the

FORMER TITLE HOLDER-Jackie Benington, now a human biology major,
reigned in 1969 as America's Junior Miss. While defending that contest as a good
way to distribute scholarships to talented, not necessarily glamourous, girls,
Benington joins with other women's liberationists in condemning beauty
contests which judge girls simply on their looks.


ANOTHER STANFORD WINNER—Ann Hayaski competed in the Miss
California contest last year and continues to model occasionally. While admitting
there can be problems with such work, she sees many benefits and plans to
continue her activities especially to help pay for her education.
majority of the beauty queen contest
ranks these days and as Sandra Bern
asks, "When was the last time you
have seen a Ph.D win a beauty
contest?"
Even sophomore beauty queen
Laurie King admits that she "is slowly
coming over" in re-evaluating her
priorities. Although she has just
finished modeling for the Jantzen
Company, King complains that "the
girls who are modeling aren't there
because of their brains, it's just a
physical thing."

People at Stanford and elsewhere
tend to scrutinize a woman for flaws
when they learn she has been a beauty
queen. There are a whole set of
pre-conceptions that come with a title.
Benington echoes the thoughts of
most of the campus queens in saying:
"I like to keep my beauty pageant
fling quiet."
Benington went through a
reverse-reaction at Stanford. "I had
had too much of being exposed,
looked at and talked to in a superficial
manner. I continually tried to get off
the pedestal. People were cautious,

even hostile towards me," she stated.
People generally over-react upon
meeting a beauty queen. Such actions
embarrassed and intimidated
Benington. "It made me very up-tight
about preserving the image," . . .an
image that may never really have
existed.
