## historical perspective Franklin Part Of Larger Schema 
### 
Gregory davis, jr.

The fact that Professor H.
Bruce Franklin is being purged by
Stanford should surprise no one.
Not only is the present
atmosphere in the country
Thermidorian and repressive, but
Stanford has always had a
particular clientele and ethos
entirely consistent with the
actions now being taken against
Franklin. Herbert Hoover, William
Rehnquist, and David Packard
were nutured in the hot houses of
the Farm—they are its favorite
sons. The faculty and
administration have always
included the likes of Campbell,
Shockley, and Rambo. When I
was a graduate student in political
science, Willmore Kendall, a
contributor to the National
Review, was enthusiastically
brought on campus to teach basic,
lower division courses in political
theory.
The university has always had a
large student population drawn
from among the nouveau riche of
the southwest: it has always
trained its share of Rocky
Mountain mormons for careers in
business, law, and other
professions. A happier, more
sun-blessed blend of technology
and Calvinism, where children of
successful capitalists are trained to
acquire their "piece of the action"
(to borrow a phrase from
Chairman Milhouse) and where
refugee professors from the
cosmopolitan intellectual centers
of our nation can retire from
reality to live out their days in
ranch houses on the hills, would
be very difficult to find. Stanford
is the western United States'
leading Technische Hochschule,
an important supplier of
technicians and managers for the
nation's military-industrial
complex and second echelon
ruling elite.
H. Bruce Franklin, ex-officer in
the Strategic Air Command
turned resident Maoist, obviously
is a thorn in the side of an
institution like Stanford—in fact,
he is more than a simple
inconvenience, he is a threat to its
self-indulgent complacency and
critical role in the American
politico-economic system. No one
in his right mind can fail to
understand that the institution
must rid itself of this man. The
raison d'etre of Stanford, its very
function and essence, demand
that Franklin be ousted. Whether
the university has a legal right to
"off' Franklin in the manner that
it chose to do so is open to
question, but it appears very
likely that it did. The fact that at
least one member of the faculty
advisory board gave the
impression that he was
continually bored with the entire
proceeding and sometimes
apparently did not comprehend
the issues being discussed, of
course, is irrelevant to this matter.
In any case, there is also no doubt
that Stanford has a perfect legal
right to engage in the kind of
activities to which Franklin and
his followers have
objected—research for the
technology of death and its
specific applications in the war in
Southeast Asia. The problem which
arises, aside from the most
important question of whether
the university should be doing
these things, is the sickening
hypocrisy and bad faith practised,
by the institution and its servants
in pursuing these ends.
Inadmissable Actions
For example, President Lyman,
in his Daily interview of the 24th,
stated that the occupation of the
Computer Center, where radicals
believed the Gamut-H project (a
simulated amphibious landing
research project financed by U.S.

Navy funds) was being conducted,
was an inadmissible action
because "of the expressed
willingness of at least some of the
people to undertake destruction
of the computer .. . which would
involve the destruction of
thousands of man-hours of
peoples' lives." What about the
destruction of thousands of
peoples' lives which would have
resulted if this plan had been
implemented by our government
in North Vietnam, for example?
Dr. Lyman's statement is similar
to a remark of Harvard President
Pusey, cited a few weeks ago by
Daniel Ellsberg, in response to the
bombing by anti-war militants of
a campus building: "Bombing,"
Pusey stated, oblivious to the
irony of his own words, "is
uncivilized."
The bombing of ROTC
buildings and DoD-funded think
tanks, the occupation of
computer centers being used for
military research, and the tactics
used by Franklin and his followers
at Stanford may be ineffective or

self-defeating, but how can Pusey
or Lyman have the gall to label
these actions as morally
reprehensible when the very
institutions they head practice
war complicity?
What is equally depressing
about the whole Franklin affair is
the continual and ultimately
nauseating stream of ratiocination
by faculty and administrators who
claim Franklin's ouster is in
accord with the traditions of
"objectivity", "neutrality", and
an atmosphere of "free
discussion" which supposedly
prevail at Stanford ("Die Luft der
Freiheit weht"). The Daily has
printed in its pages numerous
articles and letters from
professors: scientists and
technicians informing us with
tortured logic that they are
absolved of any moral
responsibility for contributing to
the technology of death because
their DoD-funded research also
has peaceful applications; social
scientists, lawyers, and professors
in the humanities piously assuring
us that Franklin is being purged
only for his actions, not for his
ideas or teaching, and that
academic freedom is being
preserved at Stanford. In
condemning Franklin's actions, of
course, they have deliberately
chosen to ignore the context in
which they were taken—the
extraordinary crisis situation
which numerous escalations of the
war in Vietnam had created in the
country.
Free Speech?
If Stanford is a place where
free speech is staunchly defended
and encouraged, then why were
the requests made by those who
disagreed with Ambassador Lodge
for a chance to present their
point of view to the same
audience ignored by those who
organized Lodge's appearance at
Stanford? Obviously the sponsors
of Lodge's visit wanted to stage
the event, like a presidential TV
appearance or campaign
commercial, to acheive a desired
effect. Why did Iranian students
have to disrupt the Hoover
Conference on Iran last year in
order to be allowed to present a
different point of view on a
controversial topic?
If the university believes in free
speech, then why doesn't it adopt

a general policy which
automatically provides an
opportunity for dissenting
speakers, debate, and interchange
with the audience when
controversial speakers appear on
the campus? As far as "academic
freedom" in the area of research is
concerned, it is really the freedom
to sell your expertise to the
highest (or only) bidder—in other
words, research talent, as we all
know, is bought up by big
business and government, on the
side of repression. The fact that
there are no bidders for certain
types of humanistic research, of
course, means that "free inquiry"
at the university is channeled by
corporate and government money.
Why don't the sanctimonius
self-proclaimed "liberal"
ideologists do something about
these obvious violations of
"academic freedom" and
institutional "objectivity"?
Leaving these matters and
other important aspects of the
Franklin case which I have not
discussed aside, I would like to

"What is depressing about the whole Franklin affair is the
continual and nauseating stream of ratiocination by faculty
and administrators who claim Franklin's ouster is in accord
with the traditions of objectivity, neutrality, and an
atmosphere of free discussion."

point out that one of the most
serious aspects of the University's
decision to fire Franklin is the
effect this action is going to have
on other institutions, as well as
the "chilling effect" it is bound to
have on the expression of dissent
by faculty on the Stanford
campus. Stanford is an elite
institution, and its example in
dealing with a radical professor's
dissent is going to influence what
is done elsewhere in California
and other parts of the United
States.
Laney
On January 26, the San
Francisco Examiner carried a
column in its editorial pages
written by Guy Wright and titled,
"A Course in Marxism." The
article was ostensibly only of an
informative nature, indicating that
two instructors at Laney College,
a two-year community college in
the East Bay with a large student
population of working class and
Third World background, were
offering a course in Marxist
Economic Theory which would
analyze and critique American
society. Mr. Wright condemned
the course and named those he
felt were responsible for allowing
such evil fare to be served up to
Community College students—the
two instructors, their department
heads, and the collete's president.
Although he called for no specific
action, the innuendo of this
article was crystal clear.
It remains to be seen what will
happen to the course offering,
undoubtedly one of the few with
a strict Marxist orientation at
Laney College; but in any case,
the article is an obvious
preliminary step (i.e., mobilizing
fear among the silent majority)
toward the kind of repression
Noam Chomsky has warned we

can expect at non-elite
institutions such as community
colleges and state colleges here in
California. As far as the general
public is concerned, in firing
Franklin Stanford has acted to cut
a Marxist cancer out of its
body—any complexities or special
circumstances in the case pass
unnoticed.
Notice that the two instructors
at Laney College are being
attacked not for actions, but for
ideas and course content, and we
can expect more of the same in
other similar institutions.
Repression at these colleges,
which have large "lower class"
students populations, is in some
ways more serious than that at
Stanford. Community college
instructors, for example, do not
have the prestige and job mobility
of Stanford faculty, and political
firings can cause more irreparable
damage to teaching careers.
Hence, repression brings more
fear, which is bound to be more
effective in inhibiting dissent.
Connection
Secondly, student populations
at schools like Laney, once
purged, are less likely to be
exposed to controversial ideas
than Stanford students, who will
probably pick up a Marxist
critique of American society
regardless of Franklin's firing. As
a community college instructor, I
cannot fail to see a connection
between Franklin's removal and
Wednesday's article in the
Examiner. President Lyman and
the Stanford Baord of Trustees
have opened the gates wide for
political repression on campuses
(as Advisory Board members
Kennedy and Brown have
warned), and the effects of their
decision are going to flow down
to other less fortunate
institutions.
What can be done at this stage
at Stanford? From an outside
observer's viewpoint, the three
most viable alternatives at the
present time seem to be: 1) legal
action by Franklin in the courts
to regain his job; 2) students
hiring Franklin to teach at
Stanford from out of their own
funds; 3) some kind of well
thought-out non-violent but
perhaps disruptive action on the
part of Franklin's faculty
supporters (would it be possible
to find 20-30 faculty who could
stick together and commit
themselves to this course of
action?).
This third alternative could
have a dramatic effect and would
cause the administration great
embarrassment if it had to
discipline a large group of faculty
for actions related to those of
Franklin. Perhaps this is the sole
way the Board and
Administration could be shown
that the faculty is not going to
take Franklin's firing lying down
and could be forced to modify its
decision. It is also possible that
hell will freeze over before even a
small group of the faculty would
resort to action of this type.

Although he called for no specific
action, the innuendo of this
article was crystal clear.
It remains to be seen what will
happen to the course offering,
undoubtedly one of the few with
a strict Marxist orientation at
Laney College; but in any case,
the article is an obvious
preliminary step (i.e., mobilizing
fear among the silent majority)
toward the kind of repression
Noam Chomsky has warned we

can expect at non-elite
institutions such as community
colleges and state colleges here in
California. As far as the general
public is concerned, in firing
Franklin Stanford has acted to cut
a Marxist cancer out of its
body—any complexities or special
circumstances in the case pass
unnoticed.
Notice that the two instructors
at Laney College are being
attacked not for actions, but for
ideas and course content, and we
can expect more of the same in
other similar institutions.
Repression at these colleges,
which have large "lower class"
students populations, is in some
ways more serious than that at
Stanford. Community college
instructors, for example, do not
have the prestige and job mobility
of Stanford faculty, and political
firings can cause more irreparable
damage to teaching careers.
Hence, repression brings more
fear, which is bound to be more
effective in inhibiting dissent.
Connection
Secondly, student populations
at schools like Laney, once
purged, are less likely to be
exposed to controversial ideas
than Stanford students, who will
probably pick up a Marxist
critique of American society
regardless of Franklin's firing. As
a community college instructor, I
cannot fail to see a connection
between Franklin's removal and
Wednesday's article in the
Examiner. President Lyman and
the Stanford Baord of Trustees
have opened the gates wide for
political repression on campuses
(as Advisory Board members
Kennedy and Brown have
warned), and the effects of their
decision are going to flow down
to other less fortunate
institutions.
What can be done at this stage
at Stanford? From an outside
observer's viewpoint, the three
most viable alternatives at the
present time seem to be: 1) legal
action by Franklin in the courts
to regain his job; 2) students
hiring Franklin to teach at
Stanford from out of their own
funds; 3) some kind of well
thought-out non-violent but
perhaps disruptive action on the
part of Franklin's faculty
supporters (would it be possible
to find 20-30 faculty who could
stick together and commit
themselves to this course of
action?).
This third alternative could
have a dramatic effect and would
cause the administration great
embarrassment if it had to
discipline a large group of faculty
for actions related to those of
Franklin. Perhaps this is the sole
way the Board and
Administration could be shown
that the faculty is not going to
take Franklin's firing lying down
and could be forced to modify its
decision. It is also possible that
hell will freeze over before even a
small group of the faculty would
resort to action of this type.

The fact that Professor H.
Bruce Franklin is being purged by
Stanford should surprise no one.
Not only is the present
atmosphere in the country
Thermidorian and repressive, but
Stanford has always had a
particular clientele and ethos
entirely consistent with the
actions now being taken against
Franklin. Herbert Hoover, William
Rehnquist, and David Packard
were nutured in the hot houses of
the Farm—they are its favorite
sons. The faculty and
administration have always
included the likes of Campbell,
Shockley, and Rambo. When I
was a graduate student in political
science, Willmore Kendall, a
contributor to the National
Review, was enthusiastically
brought on campus to teach basic,
lower division courses in political
theory.
The university has always had a
large student population drawn
from among the nouveau riche of
the southwest: it has always
trained its share of Rocky
Mountain mormons for careers in
business, law, and other
professions. A happier, more
sun-blessed blend of technology
and Calvinism, where children of
successful capitalists are trained to
acquire their "piece of the action"
(to borrow a phrase from
Chairman Milhouse) and where
refugee professors from the
cosmopolitan intellectual centers
of our nation can retire from
reality to live out their days in
ranch houses on the hills, would
be very difficult to find. Stanford
is the western United States'
leading Technische Hochschule,
an important supplier of
technicians and managers for the
nation's military-industrial
complex and second echelon
ruling elite.
H. Bruce Franklin, ex-officer in
the Strategic Air Command
turned resident Maoist, obviously
is a thorn in the side of an
institution like Stanford—in fact,
he is more than a simple
inconvenience, he is a threat to its
self-indulgent complacency and
critical role in the American
politico-economic system. No one
in his right mind can fail to
understand that the institution
must rid itself of this man. The
raison d'etre of Stanford, its very
function and essence, demand
that Franklin be ousted. Whether
the university has a legal right to
"off' Franklin in the manner that
it chose to do so is open to
question, but it appears very
likely that it did. The fact that at
least one member of the faculty
advisory board gave the
impression that he was
continually bored with the entire
proceeding and sometimes
apparently did not comprehend
the issues being discussed, of
course, is irrelevant to this matter.
In any case, there is also no doubt
that Stanford has a perfect legal
right to engage in the kind of
activities to which Franklin and
his followers have
objected—research for the
technology of death and its
specific applications in the war in
Southeast Asia. The problem which
arises, aside from the most
important question of whether
the university should be doing
these things, is the sickening
hypocrisy and bad faith practised,
by the institution and its servants
in pursuing these ends.
Inadmissable Actions
For example, President Lyman,
in his Daily interview of the 24th,
stated that the occupation of the
Computer Center, where radicals
believed the Gamut-H project (a
simulated amphibious landing
research project financed by U.S.

Navy funds) was being conducted,
was an inadmissible action
because "of the expressed
willingness of at least some of the
people to undertake destruction
of the computer .. . which would
involve the destruction of
thousands of man-hours of
peoples' lives." What about the
destruction of thousands of
peoples' lives which would have
resulted if this plan had been
implemented by our government
in North Vietnam, for example?
Dr. Lyman's statement is similar
to a remark of Harvard President
Pusey, cited a few weeks ago by
Daniel Ellsberg, in response to the
bombing by anti-war militants of
a campus building: "Bombing,"
Pusey stated, oblivious to the
irony of his own words, "is
uncivilized."
The bombing of ROTC
buildings and DoD-funded think
tanks, the occupation of
computer centers being used for
military research, and the tactics
used by Franklin and his followers
at Stanford may be ineffective or

self-defeating, but how can Pusey
or Lyman have the gall to label
these actions as morally
reprehensible when the very
institutions they head practice
war complicity?
What is equally depressing
about the whole Franklin affair is
the continual and ultimately
nauseating stream of ratiocination
by faculty and administrators who
claim Franklin's ouster is in
accord with the traditions of
"objectivity", "neutrality", and
an atmosphere of "free
discussion" which supposedly
prevail at Stanford ("Die Luft der
Freiheit weht"). The Daily has
printed in its pages numerous
articles and letters from
professors: scientists and
technicians informing us with
tortured logic that they are
absolved of any moral
responsibility for contributing to
the technology of death because
their DoD-funded research also
has peaceful applications; social
scientists, lawyers, and professors
in the humanities piously assuring
us that Franklin is being purged
only for his actions, not for his
ideas or teaching, and that
academic freedom is being
preserved at Stanford. In
condemning Franklin's actions, of
course, they have deliberately
chosen to ignore the context in
which they were taken—the
extraordinary crisis situation
which numerous escalations of the
war in Vietnam had created in the
country.
Free Speech?
If Stanford is a place where
free speech is staunchly defended
and encouraged, then why were
the requests made by those who
disagreed with Ambassador Lodge
for a chance to present their
point of view to the same
audience ignored by those who
organized Lodge's appearance at
Stanford? Obviously the sponsors
of Lodge's visit wanted to stage
the event, like a presidential TV
appearance or campaign
commercial, to acheive a desired
effect. Why did Iranian students
have to disrupt the Hoover
Conference on Iran last year in
order to be allowed to present a
different point of view on a
controversial topic?
If the university believes in free
speech, then why doesn't it adopt

a general policy which
automatically provides an
opportunity for dissenting
speakers, debate, and interchange
with the audience when
controversial speakers appear on
the campus? As far as "academic
freedom" in the area of research is
concerned, it is really the freedom
to sell your expertise to the
highest (or only) bidder—in other
words, research talent, as we all
know, is bought up by big
business and government, on the
side of repression. The fact that
there are no bidders for certain
types of humanistic research, of
course, means that "free inquiry"
at the university is channeled by
corporate and government money.
Why don't the sanctimonius
self-proclaimed "liberal"
ideologists do something about
these obvious violations of
"academic freedom" and
institutional "objectivity"?
Leaving these matters and
other important aspects of the
Franklin case which I have not
discussed aside, I would like to

"What is depressing about the whole Franklin affair is the
continual and nauseating stream of ratiocination by faculty
and administrators who claim Franklin's ouster is in accord
with the traditions of objectivity, neutrality, and an
atmosphere of free discussion."

point out that one of the most
serious aspects of the University's
decision to fire Franklin is the
effect this action is going to have
on other institutions, as well as
the "chilling effect" it is bound to
have on the expression of dissent
by faculty on the Stanford
campus. Stanford is an elite
institution, and its example in
dealing with a radical professor's
dissent is going to influence what
is done elsewhere in California
and other parts of the United
States.
Laney
On January 26, the San
Francisco Examiner carried a
column in its editorial pages
written by Guy Wright and titled,
"A Course in Marxism." The
article was ostensibly only of an
informative nature, indicating that
two instructors at Laney College,
a two-year community college in
the East Bay with a large student
population of working class and
Third World background, were
offering a course in Marxist
Economic Theory which would
analyze and critique American
society. Mr. Wright condemned
the course and named those he
felt were responsible for allowing
such evil fare to be served up to
Community College students—the
two instructors, their department
heads, and the collete's president.
Although he called for no specific
action, the innuendo of this

which they were taken—the
extraordinary crisis situation
which numerous escalations of the
war in Vietnam had created in the
country.
Free Speech?
If Stanford is a place where
free speech is staunchly defended
and encouraged, then why were
the requests made by those who
disagreed with Ambassador Lodge
for a chance to present their
point of view to the same
audience ignored by those who
organized Lodge's appearance at
Stanford? Obviously the sponsors
of Lodge's visit wanted to stage
the event, like a presidential TV
appearance or campaign
commercial, to acheive a desired
effect. Why did Iranian students
have to disrupt the Hoover
Conference on Iran last year in
order to be allowed to present a
different point of view on a
controversial topic?
If the university believes in free
speech, then why doesn't it adopt

a general policy which
automatically provides an
opportunity for dissenting
speakers, debate, and interchange
with the audience when
controversial speakers appear on
the campus? As far as "academic
freedom" in the area of research is
concerned, it is really the freedom
to sell your expertise to the
highest (or only) bidder—in other
words, research talent, as we all
know, is bought up by big
business and government, on the
side of repression. The fact that
there are no bidders for certain
types of humanistic research, of
course, means that "free inquiry"
at the university is channeled by
corporate and government money.
Why don't the sanctimonius
self-proclaimed "liberal"
ideologists do something about
these obvious violations of
"academic freedom" and
institutional "objectivity"?
Leaving these matters and
other important aspects of the
Franklin case which I have not
discussed aside, I would like to

"What is depressing about the whole Franklin affair is the
continual and nauseating stream of ratiocination by faculty
and administrators who claim Franklin's ouster is in accord
with the traditions of objectivity, neutrality, and an
atmosphere of free discussion."

point out that one of the most
serious aspects of the University's
decision to fire Franklin is the
effect this action is going to have
on other institutions, as well as
the "chilling effect" it is bound to
have on the expression of dissent
by faculty on the Stanford
campus. Stanford is an elite
institution, and its example in
dealing with a radical professor's
dissent is going to influence what
is done elsewhere in California
and other parts of the United
States.
Laney
On January 26, the San
Francisco Examiner carried a
column in its editorial pages
written by Guy Wright and titled,
"A Course in Marxism." The
article was ostensibly only of an
informative nature, indicating that
two instructors at Laney College,
a two-year community college in
the East Bay with a large student
population of working class and
Third World background, were
offering a course in Marxist
Economic Theory which would
analyze and critique American
society. Mr. Wright condemned
the course and named those he
felt were responsible for allowing
such evil fare to be served up to
Community College students—the
two instructors, their department
heads, and the collete's president.
Although he called for no specific
action, the innuendo of this
article was crystal clear.
It remains to be seen what will
happen to the course offering,
undoubtedly one of the few with
a strict Marxist orientation at
Laney College; but in any case,
the article is an obvious
preliminary step (i.e., mobilizing
fear among the silent majority)
toward the kind of repression
Noam Chomsky has warned we

can expect at non-elite
institutions such as community
colleges and state colleges here in
California. As far as the general
public is concerned, in firing
Franklin Stanford has acted to cut
a Marxist cancer out of its
body—any complexities or special
circumstances in the case pass
unnoticed.
Notice that the two instructors
at Laney College are being
attacked not for actions, but for
ideas and course content, and we
can expect more of the same in
other similar institutions.
Repression at these colleges,
which have large "lower class"
students populations, is in some
ways more serious than that at
Stanford. Community college
instructors, for example, do not
have the prestige and job mobility
of Stanford faculty, and political
firings can cause more irreparable
damage to teaching careers.
Hence, repression brings more
fear, which is bound to be more
effective in inhibiting dissent.
Connection
Secondly, student populations
at schools like Laney, once
purged, are less likely to be
exposed to controversial ideas
than Stanford students, who will
probably pick up a Marxist
critique of American society
regardless of Franklin's firing. As
a community college instructor, I
cannot fail to see a connection
between Franklin's removal and
Wednesday's article in the
Examiner. President Lyman and
the Stanford Baord of Trustees
have opened the gates wide for
political repression on campuses
(as Advisory Board members
Kennedy and Brown have
warned), and the effects of their
decision are going to flow down
to other less fortunate
institutions.
What can be done at this stage
at Stanford? From an outside
observer's viewpoint, the three
most viable alternatives at the
present time seem to be: 1) legal
action by Franklin in the courts
to regain his job; 2) students
hiring Franklin to teach at
Stanford from out of their own
funds; 3) some kind of well
thought-out non-violent but
perhaps disruptive action on the
part of Franklin's faculty
supporters (would it be possible
to find 20-30 faculty who could
stick together and commit
themselves to this course of
action?).
This third alternative could
have a dramatic effect and would
cause the administration great
embarrassment if it had to
discipline a large group of faculty
for actions related to those of
Franklin. Perhaps this is the sole
way the Board and
Administration could be shown
that the faculty is not going to
take Franklin's firing lying down
and could be forced to modify its
decision. It is also possible that
hell will freeze over before even a
small group of the faculty would
resort to action of this type.

M.A. from Stanford in 1960, and

The fact that Professor H.
Bruce Franklin is being purged by
Stanford should surprise no one.
Not only is the present
atmosphere in the country
Thermidorian and repressive, but
Stanford has always had a
particular clientele and ethos
entirely consistent with the
actions now being taken against
Franklin. Herbert Hoover, William
Rehnquist, and David Packard
were nutured in the hot houses of
the Farm—they are its favorite
sons. The faculty and
administration have always
included the likes of Campbell,
Shockley, and Rambo. When I
was a graduate student in political
science, Willmore Kendall, a
contributor to the National
Review, was enthusiastically
brought on campus to teach basic,
lower division courses in political
theory.
The university has always had a
large student population drawn
from among the nouveau riche of
the southwest: it has always
trained its share of Rocky
Mountain mormons for careers in
business, law, and other
professions. A happier, more
sun-blessed blend of technology
and Calvinism, where children of
successful capitalists are trained to
acquire their "piece of the action"
(to borrow a phrase from
Chairman Milhouse) and where
refugee professors from the
cosmopolitan intellectual centers
of our nation can retire from
reality to live out their days in
ranch houses on the hills, would
be very difficult to find. Stanford
is the western United States'
leading Technische Hochschule,
an important supplier of
technicians and managers for the
nation's military-industrial
complex and second echelon
ruling elite.
H. Bruce Franklin, ex-officer in
the Strategic Air Command
turned resident Maoist, obviously
is a thorn in the side of an
institution like Stanford—in fact,
he is more than a simple
inconvenience, he is a threat to its
self-indulgent complacency and
critical role in the American
politico-economic system. No one
in his right mind can fail to
understand that the institution
must rid itself of this man. The
raison d'etre of Stanford, its very
function and essence, demand
that Franklin be ousted. Whether
the university has a legal right to
"off' Franklin in the manner that
it chose to do so is open to
question, but it appears very
likely that it did. The fact that at
least one member of the faculty
advisory board gave the
impression that he was
continually bored with the entire
proceeding and sometimes
apparently did not comprehend
the issues being discussed, of
course, is irrelevant to this matter.
In any case, there is also no doubt
that Stanford has a perfect legal
right to engage in the kind of
activities to which Franklin and
his followers have
objected—research for the
technology of death and its
specific applications in the war in
Southeast Asia. The problem which
arises, aside from the most
important question of whether
the university should be doing
these things, is the sickening
hypocrisy and bad faith practised,
by the institution and its servants
in pursuing these ends.
Inadmissable Actions
For example, President Lyman,
in his Daily interview of the 24th,
stated that the occupation of the
Computer Center, where radicals
believed the Gamut-H project (a
simulated amphibious landing
research project financed by U.S.

Navy funds) was being conducted,
was an inadmissible action
because "of the expressed
willingness of at least some of the
people to undertake destruction
of the computer .. . which would
involve the destruction of
thousands of man-hours of
peoples' lives." What about the
destruction of thousands of
peoples' lives which would have
resulted if this plan had been
implemented by our government
in North Vietnam, for example?
Dr. Lyman's statement is similar
to a remark of Harvard President
Pusey, cited a few weeks ago by
Daniel Ellsberg, in response to the
bombing by anti-war militants of
a campus building: "Bombing,"
Pusey stated, oblivious to the
irony of his own words, "is
uncivilized."
The bombing of ROTC
buildings and DoD-funded think
tanks, the occupation of
computer centers being used for
military research, and the tactics
used by Franklin and his followers
at Stanford may be ineffective or

self-defeating, but how can Pusey
or Lyman have the gall to label
these actions as morally
reprehensible when the very
institutions they head practice
war complicity?
What is equally depressing
about the whole Franklin affair is
the continual and ultimately
nauseating stream of ratiocination
by faculty and administrators who
claim Franklin's ouster is in
accord with the traditions of
"objectivity", "neutrality", and
an atmosphere of "free
discussion" which supposedly
prevail at Stanford ("Die Luft der
Freiheit weht"). The Daily has
printed in its pages numerous
articles and letters from
professors: scientists and
technicians informing us with
tortured logic that they are
absolved of any moral
responsibility for contributing to
the technology of death because
their DoD-funded research also
has peaceful applications; social
scientists, lawyers, and professors
in the humanities piously assuring
us that Franklin is being purged
only for his actions, not for his
ideas or teaching, and that
academic freedom is being
preserved at Stanford. In
condemning Franklin's actions, of
course, they have deliberately
chosen to ignore the context in
which they were taken—the
extraordinary crisis situation
which numerous escalations of the
war in Vietnam had created in the
country.
Free Speech?

it chose to do so is open to
question, but it appears very
likely that it did. The fact that at
least one member of the faculty
advisory board gave the
impression that he was
continually bored with the entire
proceeding and sometimes
apparently did not comprehend
the issues being discussed, of
course, is irrelevant to this matter.
In any case, there is also no doubt
that Stanford has a perfect legal
right to engage in the kind of
activities to which Franklin and
his followers have
objected—research for the
technology of death and its
specific applications in the war in
Southeast Asia. The problem which
arises, aside from the most
important question of whether
the university should be doing
these things, is the sickening
hypocrisy and bad faith practised,
by the institution and its servants
in pursuing these ends.
Inadmissable Actions
For example, President Lyman,
in his Daily interview of the 24th,
stated that the occupation of the
Computer Center, where radicals
believed the Gamut-H project (a
simulated amphibious landing
research project financed by U.S.

Navy funds) was being conducted,
was an inadmissible action
because "of the expressed
willingness of at least some of the
people to undertake destruction
of the computer .. . which would
involve the destruction of
thousands of man-hours of
peoples' lives." What about the
destruction of thousands of
peoples' lives which would have
resulted if this plan had been
implemented by our government
in North Vietnam, for example?
Dr. Lyman's statement is similar
to a remark of Harvard President
Pusey, cited a few weeks ago by
Daniel Ellsberg, in response to the
bombing by anti-war militants of
a campus building: "Bombing,"
Pusey stated, oblivious to the
irony of his own words, "is
uncivilized."
The bombing of ROTC
buildings and DoD-funded think
tanks, the occupation of
computer centers being used for
military research, and the tactics
used by Franklin and his followers
at Stanford may be ineffective or

self-defeating, but how can Pusey
or Lyman have the gall to label
these actions as morally
reprehensible when the very
institutions they head practice
war complicity?
What is equally depressing
about the whole Franklin affair is
the continual and ultimately
nauseating stream of ratiocination
by faculty and administrators who
claim Franklin's ouster is in
accord with the traditions of
"objectivity", "neutrality", and
an atmosphere of "free
discussion" which supposedly
prevail at Stanford ("Die Luft der
Freiheit weht"). The Daily has
printed in its pages numerous
articles and letters from
professors: scientists and
technicians informing us with
tortured logic that they are
absolved of any moral
responsibility for contributing to
the technology of death because
their DoD-funded research also
has peaceful applications; social
scientists, lawyers, and professors
in the humanities piously assuring
us that Franklin is being purged
only for his actions, not for his
ideas or teaching, and that
academic freedom is being
preserved at Stanford. In
condemning Franklin's actions, of
course, they have deliberately
chosen to ignore the context in
which they were taken—the
extraordinary crisis situation
which numerous escalations of the
war in Vietnam had created in the
country.
Free Speech?
If Stanford is a place where
free speech is staunchly defended
and encouraged, then why were
the requests made by those who
disagreed with Ambassador Lodge
for a chance to present their
point of view to the same
audience ignored by those who
organized Lodge's appearance at
Stanford? Obviously the sponsors
of Lodge's visit wanted to stage
the event, like a presidential TV
appearance or campaign
commercial, to acheive a desired
effect. Why did Iranian students
have to disrupt the Hoover
Conference on Iran last year in
order to be allowed to present a
different point of view on a
controversial topic?
If the university believes in free
speech, then why doesn't it adopt

a general policy which
automatically provides an
opportunity for dissenting
speakers, debate, and interchange
with the audience when
controversial speakers appear on
the campus? As far as "academic
freedom" in the area of research is
concerned, it is really the freedom
to sell your expertise to the
highest (or only) bidder—in other
words, research talent, as we all
know, is bought up by big
business and government, on the
side of repression. The fact that
there are no bidders for certain
types of humanistic research, of
course, means that "free inquiry"
at the university is channeled by
corporate and government money.
Why don't the sanctimonius
self-proclaimed "liberal"
ideologists do something about
these obvious violations of
"academic freedom" and
institutional "objectivity"?
Leaving these matters and
other important aspects of the
Franklin case which I have not
discussed aside, I would like to

"What is depressing about the whole Franklin affair is the
continual and nauseating stream of ratiocination by faculty
and administrators who claim Franklin's ouster is in accord
with the traditions of objectivity, neutrality, and an
atmosphere of free discussion."

point out that one of the most
serious aspects of the University's
decision to fire Franklin is the
effect this action is going to have
on other institutions, as well as
the "chilling effect" it is bound to
have on the expression of dissent
by faculty on the Stanford
campus. Stanford is an elite
institution, and its example in
dealing with a radical professor's
dissent is going to influence what
is done elsewhere in California
and other parts of the United
States.
Laney
On January 26, the San
Francisco Examiner carried a
column in its editorial pages
written by Guy Wright and titled,
"A Course in Marxism." The
article was ostensibly only of an
informative nature, indicating that
two instructors at Laney College,
a two-year community college in
the East Bay with a large student
population of working class and
Third World background, were
offering a course in Marxist
Economic Theory which would
analyze and critique American
society. Mr. Wright condemned
the course and named those he
felt were responsible for allowing
such evil fare to be served up to
Community College students—the
two instructors, their department
heads, and the collete's president.
Although he called for no specific
action, the innuendo of this
article was crystal clear.
It remains to be seen what will
happen to the course offering,
undoubtedly one of the few with
a strict Marxist orientation at
Laney College; but in any case,
the article is an obvious
preliminary step (i.e., mobilizing
fear among the silent majority)
toward the kind of repression
Noam Chomsky has warned we

can expect at non-elite
institutions such as community
colleges and state colleges here in
California. As far as the general
public is concerned, in firing
Franklin Stanford has acted to cut
a Marxist cancer out of its
body—any complexities or special
circumstances in the case pass
unnoticed.
Notice that the two instructors
at Laney College are being
attacked not for actions, but for
ideas and course content, and we
can expect more of the same in
other similar institutions.
Repression at these colleges,
which have large "lower class"
students populations, is in some
ways more serious than that at
Stanford. Community college
instructors, for example, do not
have the prestige and job mobility
of Stanford faculty, and political
firings can cause more irreparable
damage to teaching careers.
Hence, repression brings more
fear, which is bound to be more
effective in inhibiting dissent.
Connection
Secondly, student populations
at schools like Laney, once
purged, are less likely to be
exposed to controversial ideas
than Stanford students, who will
probably pick up a Marxist
critique of American society
regardless of Franklin's firing. As
a community college instructor, I
cannot fail to see a connection
between Franklin's removal and
Wednesday's article in the
Examiner. President Lyman and
the Stanford Baord of Trustees
have opened the gates wide for
political repression on campuses
(as Advisory Board members
Kennedy and Brown have
warned), and the effects of their
decision are going to flow down
to other less fortunate
institutions.
What can be done at this stage
at Stanford? From an outside
observer's viewpoint, the three
most viable alternatives at the
present time seem to be: 1) legal
action by Franklin in the courts
to regain his job; 2) students
hiring Franklin to teach at
Stanford from out of their own
funds; 3) some kind of well
thought-out non-violent but
perhaps disruptive action on the
part of Franklin's faculty
supporters (would it be possible
to find 20-30 faculty who could
stick together and commit
themselves to this course of
action?).
This third alternative could
have a dramatic effect and would
cause the administration great
embarrassment if it had to
discipline a large group of faculty
for actions related to those of
Franklin. Perhaps this is the sole
way the Board and
Administration could be shown
that the faculty is not going to
take Franklin's firing lying down
and could be forced to modify its
decision. It is also possible that
hell will freeze over before even a
small group of the faculty would
resort to action of this type.

M.A. from Stanford in 1960, and

The fact that Professor H.
Bruce Franklin is being purged by
Stanford should surprise no one.
Not only is the present
atmosphere in the country
Thermidorian and repressive, but
Stanford has always had a
particular clientele and ethos
entirely consistent with the
actions now being taken against
Franklin. Herbert Hoover, William
Rehnquist, and David Packard
were nutured in the hot houses of
the Farm—they are its favorite
sons. The faculty and
administration have always
included the likes of Campbell,
Shockley, and Rambo. When I
was a graduate student in political
science, Willmore Kendall, a
contributor to the National
Review, was enthusiastically
brought on campus to teach basic,
lower division courses in political
theory.
The university has always had a
large student population drawn
from among the nouveau riche of
the southwest: it has always
trained its share of Rocky
Mountain mormons for careers in
business, law, and other
professions. A happier, more
sun-blessed blend of technology
and Calvinism, where children of
successful capitalists are trained to
acquire their "piece of the action"
(to borrow a phrase from
Chairman Milhouse) and where
refugee professors from the
cosmopolitan intellectual centers
of our nation can retire from
reality to live out their days in
ranch houses on the hills, would
be very difficult to find. Stanford
is the western United States'
leading Technische Hochschule,
an important supplier of
technicians and managers for the
nation's military-industrial
complex and second echelon
ruling elite.
H. Bruce Franklin, ex-officer in
the Strategic Air Command
turned resident Maoist, obviously
is a thorn in the side of an
institution like Stanford—in fact,
he is more than a simple
inconvenience, he is a threat to its
self-indulgent complacency and
critical role in the American
politico-economic system. No one
in his right mind can fail to
understand that the institution
must rid itself of this man. The
raison d'etre of Stanford, its very
function and essence, demand
that Franklin be ousted. Whether
the university has a legal right to
"off' Franklin in the manner that
it chose to do so is open to
question, but it appears very
likely that it did. The fact that at
least one member of the faculty
advisory board gave the

hiring Franklin to teach at
Stanford from out of their own
funds; 3) some kind of well
thought-out non-violent but
perhaps disruptive action on the
part of Franklin's faculty
supporters (would it be possible
to find 20-30 faculty who could
stick together and commit
themselves to this course of
action?).
This third alternative could
have a dramatic effect and would
cause the administration great
embarrassment if it had to
discipline a large group of faculty
for actions related to those of
Franklin. Perhaps this is the sole
way the Board and
Administration could be shown
that the faculty is not going to
take Franklin's firing lying down
and could be forced to modify its
decision. It is also possible that
hell will freeze over before even a
small group of the faculty would
resort to action of this type.

The fact that Professor H.
Bruce Franklin is being purged by
Stanford should surprise no one.
Not only is the present
atmosphere in the country
Thermidorian and repressive, but
Stanford has always had a
particular clientele and ethos
entirely consistent with the
actions now being taken against
Franklin. Herbert Hoover, William
Rehnquist, and David Packard
were nutured in the hot houses of
the Farm—they are its favorite
sons. The faculty and
administration have always
included the likes of Campbell,
Shockley, and Rambo. When I
was a graduate student in political
science, Willmore Kendall, a
contributor to the National
Review, was enthusiastically
brought on campus to teach basic,
lower division courses in political
theory.
The university has always had a
large student population drawn
from among the nouveau riche of
the southwest: it has always
trained its share of Rocky
Mountain mormons for careers in
business, law, and other
professions. A happier, more
sun-blessed blend of technology
and Calvinism, where children of
successful capitalists are trained to
acquire their "piece of the action"
(to borrow a phrase from
Chairman Milhouse) and where
refugee professors from the
cosmopolitan intellectual centers
of our nation can retire from
reality to live out their days in
ranch houses on the hills, would
be very difficult to find. Stanford
is the western United States'
leading Technische Hochschule,
an important supplier of
technicians and managers for the
nation's military-industrial
complex and second echelon
ruling elite.
H. Bruce Franklin, ex-officer in
the Strategic Air Command
turned resident Maoist, obviously
is a thorn in the side of an
institution like Stanford—in fact,
he is more than a simple
inconvenience, he is a threat to its
self-indulgent complacency and
critical role in the American
politico-economic system. No one
in his right mind can fail to
understand that the institution
must rid itself of this man. The
raison d'etre of Stanford, its very
function and essence, demand
that Franklin be ousted. Whether
the university has a legal right to
"off' Franklin in the manner that
it chose to do so is open to
question, but it appears very
likely that it did. The fact that at
least one member of the faculty
advisory board gave the
impression that he was
continually bored with the entire
proceeding and sometimes
apparently did not comprehend
the issues being discussed, of
course, is irrelevant to this matter.
In any case, there is also no doubt
that Stanford has a perfect legal
right to engage in the kind of
activities to which Franklin and
his followers have
objected—research for the
technology of death and its
specific applications in the war in
Southeast Asia. The problem which
arises, aside from the most
important question of whether
the university should be doing
these things, is the sickening
hypocrisy and bad faith practised,
by the institution and its servants
in pursuing these ends.
Inadmissable Actions
For example, President Lyman,
in his Daily interview of the 24th,
stated that the occupation of the
Computer Center, where radicals
believed the Gamut-H project (a
simulated amphibious landing
research project financed by U.S.

Navy funds) was being conducted,
was an inadmissible action
because "of the expressed
willingness of at least some of the
people to undertake destruction
of the computer .. . which would
involve the destruction of
thousands of man-hours of
peoples' lives." What about the
destruction of thousands of
peoples' lives which would have
resulted if this plan had been
implemented by our government
in North Vietnam, for example?
Dr. Lyman's statement is similar
to a remark of Harvard President
Pusey, cited a few weeks ago by
Daniel Ellsberg, in response to the
bombing by anti-war militants of
a campus building: "Bombing,"
Pusey stated, oblivious to the
irony of his own words, "is
uncivilized."
The bombing of ROTC
buildings and DoD-funded think
tanks, the occupation of
computer centers being used for
military research, and the tactics
used by Franklin and his followers
at Stanford may be ineffective or

self-defeating, but how can Pusey
or Lyman have the gall to label
these actions as morally
reprehensible when the very
institutions they head practice
war complicity?
What is equally depressing
about the whole Franklin affair is
the continual and ultimately
nauseating stream of ratiocination
by faculty and administrators who
claim Franklin's ouster is in
accord with the traditions of
"objectivity", "neutrality", and
an atmosphere of "free
discussion" which supposedly
prevail at Stanford ("Die Luft der
Freiheit weht"). The Daily has
printed in its pages numerous
articles and letters from
professors: scientists and
technicians informing us with
tortured logic that they are
absolved of any moral
responsibility for contributing to
the technology of death because
their DoD-funded research also
has peaceful applications; social
scientists, lawyers, and professors
in the humanities piously assuring
us that Franklin is being purged
only for his actions, not for his
ideas or teaching, and that
academic freedom is being
preserved at Stanford. In
condemning Franklin's actions, of
course, they have deliberately
chosen to ignore the context in
which they were taken—the
extraordinary crisis situation
which numerous escalations of the
war in Vietnam had created in the
country.
Free Speech?
If Stanford is a place where
free speech is staunchly defended
and encouraged, then why were
the requests made by those who
disagreed with Ambassador Lodge
for a chance to present their
point of view to the same
audience ignored by those who
organized Lodge's appearance at
Stanford? Obviously the sponsors
of Lodge's visit wanted to stage
the event, like a presidential TV
appearance or campaign
commercial, to acheive a desired
effect. Why did Iranian students
have to disrupt the Hoover
Conference on Iran last year in
order to be allowed to present a
different point of view on a
controversial topic?
If the university believes in free
speech, then why doesn't it adopt

a general policy which
automatically provides an
opportunity for dissenting
speakers, debate, and interchange
with the audience when
controversial speakers appear on
the campus? As far as "academic
freedom" in the area of research is
concerned, it is really the freedom
to sell your expertise to the
highest (or only) bidder—in other
words, research talent, as we all
know, is bought up by big
business and government, on the
side of repression. The fact that
there are no bidders for certain
types of humanistic research, of
course, means that "free inquiry"
at the university is channeled by
corporate and government money.
Why don't the sanctimonius
self-proclaimed "liberal"
ideologists do something about
these obvious violations of
"academic freedom" and
institutional "objectivity"?
Leaving these matters and
other important aspects of the
Franklin case which I have not
discussed aside, I would like to

"What is depressing about the whole Franklin affair is the
continual and nauseating stream of ratiocination by faculty
and administrators who claim Franklin's ouster is in accord
with the traditions of objectivity, neutrality, and an
atmosphere of free discussion."

point out that one of the most
serious aspects of the University's
decision to fire Franklin is the
effect this action is going to have
on other institutions, as well as
the "chilling effect" it is bound to
have on the expression of dissent
by faculty on the Stanford
campus. Stanford is an elite
institution, and its example in
dealing with a radical professor's
dissent is going to influence what
is done elsewhere in California
and other parts of the United
States.
Laney
On January 26, the San
Francisco Examiner carried a
column in its editorial pages
written by Guy Wright and titled,
"A Course in Marxism." The
article was ostensibly only of an
informative nature, indicating that
two instructors at Laney College,
a two-year community college in
the East Bay with a large student
population of working class and
Third World background, were
offering a course in Marxist
Economic Theory which would
analyze and critique American
society. Mr. Wright condemned
the course and named those he
felt were responsible for allowing
such evil fare to be served up to
Community College students—the
two instructors, their department
heads, and the collete's president.
Although he called for no specific
action, the innuendo of this
article was crystal clear.
It remains to be seen what will
happen to the course offering,
undoubtedly one of the few with
a strict Marxist orientation at
Laney College; but in any case,
the article is an obvious
preliminary step (i.e., mobilizing
fear among the silent majority)
toward the kind of repression
Noam Chomsky has warned we

can expect at non-elite
institutions such as community
colleges and state colleges here in
California. As far as the general
public is concerned, in firing
Franklin Stanford has acted to cut
a Marxist cancer out of its
body—any complexities or special
circumstances in the case pass
unnoticed.
Notice that the two instructors
at Laney College are being
attacked not for actions, but for
ideas and course content, and we
can expect more of the same in
other similar institutions.
Repression at these colleges,
which have large "lower class"
students populations, is in some
ways more serious than that at
Stanford. Community college
instructors, for example, do not
have the prestige and job mobility
of Stanford faculty, and political
firings can cause more irreparable
damage to teaching careers.
Hence, repression brings more
fear, which is bound to be more
effective in inhibiting dissent.
Connection
Secondly, student populations
at schools like Laney, once
purged, are less likely to be
exposed to controversial ideas
than Stanford students, who will
probably pick up a Marxist
critique of American society
regardless of Franklin's firing. As
a community college instructor, I
cannot fail to see a connection
between Franklin's removal and
Wednesday's article in the
Examiner. President Lyman and
the Stanford Baord of Trustees
have opened the gates wide for
political repression on campuses
(as Advisory Board members
Kennedy and Brown have
warned), and the effects of their
decision are going to flow down
to other less fortunate
institutions.
What can be done at this stage
at Stanford? From an outside
observer's viewpoint, the three
most viable alternatives at the
present time seem to be: 1) legal
action by Franklin in the courts
to regain his job; 2) students
hiring Franklin to teach at
Stanford from out of their own
funds; 3) some kind of well
thought-out non-violent but
perhaps disruptive action on the
part of Franklin's faculty
supporters (would it be possible
to find 20-30 faculty who could
stick together and commit
themselves to this course of
action?).
This third alternative could
have a dramatic effect and would
cause the administration great
embarrassment if it had to

for actions related to those of
Franklin. Perhaps this is the sole

Administration could be shown
that the faculty is not going to

decision. It is also possible that
hell will freeze over before even a
small group of the faculty would
