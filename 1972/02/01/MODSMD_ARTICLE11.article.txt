On Absolutes
Editor, THE DAILY:
A fundamental trend
throughout the thinking of many
Stanford students and faculty is
to think and act according to
absolute principles rather than to
look at actions by their objective
results. The particular absolute
that prompted this letter is "thou
shalt not kill", of course brought
up by the silverware incident last
Monday.
Stealing is not a moral
question, but rather, it is a class
question. In a capitalist society
certain modes of stealing are
fundamental to the system itself,
whereas others are moralistically
condemned. It is all right for the
bourgeoisie to rip-off working

people in this country (not to
mention the third world) by
paying them significantly less than
they produce and stealing the rest,
but when a poor or working
person takes something from the
bourgeoisie that is immoral. So,
the capitalist system is itself an
excuse for the bourgeoisie stealing
from the proletariat, whereas by
virtue of the State, police, army
etc., the bourgeoisie is protected
from having some of their stolen
goods taken back.
Last Monday's action was a
conscious political act on the part
of Chicano and black comrades
and whites in solidarity with
them. They were fully aware that
they were stealing from the petty
bourgeois faculty (i.e. Dornbusch)
while the same people helped the
workers in the Faculty Club to
clean up the mess that was left.
Many of the comrades had no
silverware at their homes, and
some used old cans to drink out
of. Considering that a 5, 10 or 15
dollar assessment to the faculty
members will in no way deprive
them of anything, and the
Chicanos and blacks have been
systematically deprived of many
essential things their whole lives,
what they did was a righteous act.
Finally, we maintain, that only
white middle upper class students
could possibly object to such an
act. It is very hard for them to
identify with stealing for they
obviously have never felt or had
the need to do so. It is easy for
them to condemn stealing lock
stock and barrel considering their
total material fulfillment. Well,
black, brown and poor and
working brothers and sisters do
not have the privilege to be
moralistic. There are times when
they must steal to get just an
adequate subsistence.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to bring to your
attention the fact that I was
misquoted in your article
concerning this year's
commencement speaker. (Jan. 13,
1972) 1 never mentioned Julian
Bond's name to your reporter,
and I did not imply that he was

considered an unacceptable
candidate for speaker for any
reason. Bond was mentioned to
your reporter by another member
of the Senior Class Council of
Presidents in an interview which
was held subsequent to my
interview.
Also, I would like to mention
(as I did to your reporter) that I
advertised in The Daily several
times for suggestions from
students for commencement
speaker.
Would you please publish this,
as a response to Diane Fields'
letter? Thank you.

Irony
Editor, THE DAILY:
Throughout the dull grey
evening of the fifties, against
considerable pressure, Stanford
retained Paul Baran. Everyone
knew this at that time, and when I
came to Stanford as a graduate
student in the early sixties, that
was one of the things always said:
Stanford had tolerated the
presence of a Marxist. It gave
Stanford some color in that dull
grey evening. One is now hatefully
pushed to the recourse of irony.
To mock Henry Cabot Lodge
(the estimable Lodge revealed in
The Pentagon Papers), to
contemplate attacking a
computer, these are serious
crimes, compounded by the fact
that they were done in the open
by a Professor whose duty is To
Set An Example. But irony no
longer brings weary smiles; it
makes one want to retch instead.
Irony signifies Lodge calmly
betraying Diem. Irony signifies
the computer reading print-outs
of aerial reconnaisance and
bombing schedules. The firing of
Bruce Franklin wipes out that
modest patch of color Stanford
gained in the fifties and leaves
now an ugly black smudge.
In many alumni, I suspect, the
phenomenon of this firing creates

a sense of irony—especially in
those who knew Bruce Franklin as
a onetime prodigy. For my part, it
induces nausea and fantasy. One
dreams of spilling in your balmy
Quad a decade's load of
Vietnamese gore and then letting
it sit there, the great mound of it,
reeking to high heaven, as
everyone goes his sane liberal way
among those golden monastic
buildings, the orange trees and
fountains.
This is not Franklin's case,
Franklin is only a figure. The case
is the broken bones and the blood
beneath the orange trees, stinking
in your Quad and mine. Even to
look is admittedly hard. And that
next could easily become a garish
and illegal thing.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I read with great interest the
proposal by Dennis Hayes that
students engage in a tuition strike
to force the University to rehire
ex-professor Franklin.
Although I usually don't agree
with Mr. Hayes, I certainly do in
this case in so far as his tuition
strike proposal is concerned. I am
exceedingly impressed by his
clarity of thought in carefully
considering all the logical
consequences of such a move by
Mr. Franklin's supporters.
To those who agree with Mr.
Hayes' proposal I say "Right On"
and do it now—but please don't
block the classroom doors when a
crowd of new students appear to
take your places. They will be just
some of the qualified appliants to
Stanford who didn't get admitted
but now have the opportunity to
displace some of you who have
been trying to make Stanford a
sideshow to the Marxist-Leninist-
Maoist circus.
Yes, Mr. Hayes is certainly a
great and thoughtful leader and I
certainly hope he and the other
Pied Piper, Mr. Franklin, can lead
their troup of rats to the fate they
deserve. A tuition strike is a real
step in the right direction—out of
town.

and do it now—but please don't
block the classroom doors when a
crowd of new students appear to
take your places. They will be just
some of the qualified appliants to
Stanford who didn't get admitted
but now have the opportunity to
displace some of you who have
been trying to make Stanford a
sideshow to the Marxist-Leninist-
Maoist circus.
Yes, Mr. Hayes is certainly a
great and thoughtful leader and I
certainly hope he and the other
Pied Piper, Mr. Franklin, can lead
their troup of rats to the fate they
deserve. A tuition strike is a real
step in the right direction—out of

Editor, THE DAILY:
A fundamental trend
throughout the thinking of many
Stanford students and faculty is
to think and act according to
absolute principles rather than to
look at actions by their objective
results. The particular absolute
that prompted this letter is "thou
shalt not kill", of course brought
up by the silverware incident last
Monday.
Stealing is not a moral
question, but rather, it is a class
question. In a capitalist society
certain modes of stealing are
fundamental to the system itself,
whereas others are moralistically
condemned. It is all right for the
bourgeoisie to rip-off working

people in this country (not to
mention the third world) by
paying them significantly less than
they produce and stealing the rest,
but when a poor or working
person takes something from the
bourgeoisie that is immoral. So,
the capitalist system is itself an
excuse for the bourgeoisie stealing
from the proletariat, whereas by
virtue of the State, police, army
etc., the bourgeoisie is protected
from having some of their stolen
goods taken back.
Last Monday's action was a
conscious political act on the part
of Chicano and black comrades
and whites in solidarity with
them. They were fully aware that
they were stealing from the petty
bourgeois faculty (i.e. Dornbusch)
while the same people helped the
workers in the Faculty Club to
clean up the mess that was left.
Many of the comrades had no
silverware at their homes, and
some used old cans to drink out
of. Considering that a 5, 10 or 15
dollar assessment to the faculty
members will in no way deprive
them of anything, and the
Chicanos and blacks have been
systematically deprived of many
essential things their whole lives,
what they did was a righteous act.
Finally, we maintain, that only
white middle upper class students
could possibly object to such an
act. It is very hard for them to
identify with stealing for they
obviously have never felt or had
the need to do so. It is easy for
them to condemn stealing lock
stock and barrel considering their
total material fulfillment. Well,
black, brown and poor and
working brothers and sisters do
not have the privilege to be
moralistic. There are times when
they must steal to get just an
adequate subsistence.

Irony
Editor, THE DAILY:
Throughout the dull grey
evening of the fifties, against
considerable pressure, Stanford
retained Paul Baran. Everyone
knew this at that time, and when I
came to Stanford as a graduate
student in the early sixties, that
was one of the things always said:
Stanford had tolerated the
presence of a Marxist. It gave
Stanford some color in that dull
grey evening. One is now hatefully
pushed to the recourse of irony.
To mock Henry Cabot Lodge
(the estimable Lodge revealed in
The Pentagon Papers), to
contemplate attacking a
computer, these are serious
crimes, compounded by the fact
that they were done in the open
by a Professor whose duty is To
Set An Example. But irony no
longer brings weary smiles; it
makes one want to retch instead.
Irony signifies Lodge calmly
betraying Diem. Irony signifies
the computer reading print-outs
of aerial reconnaisance and
bombing schedules. The firing of
Bruce Franklin wipes out that
modest patch of color Stanford
gained in the fifties and leaves
now an ugly black smudge.
In many alumni, I suspect, the
phenomenon of this firing creates

a sense of irony—especially in
those who knew Bruce Franklin as
a onetime prodigy. For my part, it
induces nausea and fantasy. One
dreams of spilling in your balmy
Quad a decade's load of
Vietnamese gore and then letting
it sit there, the great mound of it,
reeking to high heaven, as
everyone goes his sane liberal way
among those golden monastic
buildings, the orange trees and
fountains.
This is not Franklin's case,
Franklin is only a figure. The case
is the broken bones and the blood
beneath the orange trees, stinking
in your Quad and mine. Even to
look is admittedly hard. And that
next could easily become a garish
and illegal thing.

This is not Franklin's case,
Franklin is only a figure. The case
is the broken bones and the blood
beneath the orange trees, stinking
in your Quad and mine. Even to
look is admittedly hard. And that

I read with great interest the
proposal by Dennis Hayes that
students engage in a tuition strike
to force the University to rehire
ex-professor Franklin.
Although I usually don't agree
with Mr. Hayes, I certainly do in
this case in so far as his tuition
strike proposal is concerned. I am
exceedingly impressed by his
clarity of thought in carefully
considering all the logical
consequences of such a move by
Mr. Franklin's supporters.
To those who agree with Mr.
Hayes' proposal I say "Right On"
and do it now—but please don't
block the classroom doors when a
crowd of new students appear to
take your places. They will be just
some of the qualified appliants to
Stanford who didn't get admitted
but now have the opportunity to
displace some of you who have
been trying to make Stanford a
sideshow to the Marxist-Leninist-
Maoist circus.
Yes, Mr. Hayes is certainly a
great and thoughtful leader and I
certainly hope he and the other
Pied Piper, Mr. Franklin, can lead
their troup of rats to the fate they
deserve. A tuition strike is a real
step in the right direction—out of
town.

On Absolutes
Editor, THE DAILY:
A fundamental trend
throughout the thinking of many
Stanford students and faculty is
to think and act according to
absolute principles rather than to
look at actions by their objective
results. The particular absolute
that prompted this letter is "thou
shalt not kill", of course brought
up by the silverware incident last
Monday.
Stealing is not a moral
question, but rather, it is a class
question. In a capitalist society
certain modes of stealing are
fundamental to the system itself,
whereas others are moralistically
condemned. It is all right for the
bourgeoisie to rip-off working

people in this country (not to
mention the third world) by
paying them significantly less than
they produce and stealing the rest,
but when a poor or working
person takes something from the
bourgeoisie that is immoral. So,
the capitalist system is itself an
excuse for the bourgeoisie stealing
from the proletariat, whereas by
virtue of the State, police, army
etc., the bourgeoisie is protected
from having some of their stolen
goods taken back.
Last Monday's action was a
conscious political act on the part
of Chicano and black comrades
and whites in solidarity with
them. They were fully aware that
they were stealing from the petty
bourgeois faculty (i.e. Dornbusch)
while the same people helped the
workers in the Faculty Club to
clean up the mess that was left.
Many of the comrades had no
silverware at their homes, and
some used old cans to drink out
of. Considering that a 5, 10 or 15
dollar assessment to the faculty
members will in no way deprive
them of anything, and the
Chicanos and blacks have been
systematically deprived of many
essential things their whole lives,
what they did was a righteous act.
Finally, we maintain, that only
white middle upper class students
could possibly object to such an
act. It is very hard for them to
identify with stealing for they
obviously have never felt or had
the need to do so. It is easy for
them to condemn stealing lock
stock and barrel considering their
total material fulfillment. Well,
black, brown and poor and
working brothers and sisters do
not have the privilege to be
moralistic. There are times when
they must steal to get just an
adequate subsistence.

I would like to bring to your
attention the fact that I was
misquoted in your article
concerning this year's
commencement speaker. (Jan. 13,
1972) 1 never mentioned Julian
Bond's name to your reporter,
and I did not imply that he was

considered an unacceptable
candidate for speaker for any
reason. Bond was mentioned to
your reporter by another member
of the Senior Class Council of
Presidents in an interview which
was held subsequent to my
interview.
Also, I would like to mention
(as I did to your reporter) that I
advertised in The Daily several
times for suggestions from
students for commencement
speaker.
Would you please publish this,
as a response to Diane Fields'
letter? Thank you.

Irony
Editor, THE DAILY:
Throughout the dull grey
evening of the fifties, against
considerable pressure, Stanford
retained Paul Baran. Everyone
knew this at that time, and when I
came to Stanford as a graduate
student in the early sixties, that
was one of the things always said:
Stanford had tolerated the
presence of a Marxist. It gave
Stanford some color in that dull
grey evening. One is now hatefully
pushed to the recourse of irony.
To mock Henry Cabot Lodge
(the estimable Lodge revealed in
The Pentagon Papers), to
contemplate attacking a
computer, these are serious
crimes, compounded by the fact
that they were done in the open
by a Professor whose duty is To
Set An Example. But irony no
longer brings weary smiles; it
makes one want to retch instead.
Irony signifies Lodge calmly
betraying Diem. Irony signifies
the computer reading print-outs
of aerial reconnaisance and
bombing schedules. The firing of
Bruce Franklin wipes out that
modest patch of color Stanford
gained in the fifties and leaves
now an ugly black smudge.
In many alumni, I suspect, the
phenomenon of this firing creates

a sense of irony—especially in
those who knew Bruce Franklin as
a onetime prodigy. For my part, it
induces nausea and fantasy. One
dreams of spilling in your balmy
Quad a decade's load of
Vietnamese gore and then letting
it sit there, the great mound of it,
reeking to high heaven, as
everyone goes his sane liberal way
among those golden monastic
buildings, the orange trees and
fountains.
This is not Franklin's case,
Franklin is only a figure. The case
is the broken bones and the blood
