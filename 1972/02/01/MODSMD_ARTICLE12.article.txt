# once upon a time
## Brooklyn's Electric Ego Bus 
### 
p. Frederick richardson

Grandpa sat in his big old
chair, and the children on the
floor around him, to hear him tell
one of his favorite stories:
Once upon a time there was a
big dark sea full of monsters, the
most horrible of which was named
Dod. But in one corner of this sea
there was a peaceful island
inhabited by a big old queen
named Mama Drofnats. People
came to the island from all parts
of the ugly sea to suck on Mama
Drofnats' nipples and drink her
accredited milk, which made them
all very wise.
One day a guy named Frank
Brooklyn, cruising around on his
white whale from the opposite
corner of the sea, came to the
shore of the island and found it
good. Frank wasn't very big, or
very wise, and nobody paid much
attention to him, which really
bugged him and made him gnash
his teeth. He buttoned his big
mouth on Mama Drofnats' nipple
and drank a little squirt, then
more and more until he became a
very wise guy.
One day, while sucking on
Mama Drofnats' nipple and feeling
neglected, he gnashed his teeth,
which made the big queen wince.
"Hey man", she said, "cut that
out. You bruisin' my tit". Frank
was surprised that it was so easy
to make the queen jump, and a bit
happy that he had received some
recognition at last. So he gnashed
his teeth again. Harder. The queen
said, "Frank, boy, I been giving
you a lot of squirts of milk, to
make you wise. Why you biting so
hard on my nipple?"
Mousey Dung
Frank said, "Mama, whilst I
was rappin with my friend
mousey dung, from the turd

world, I came to realize that you
ain't no queen at all. You rip off
from the poor and give to the
rich. Worst of all, I spied you
havin an affair with the monster
Dod who runs the dark ugly sea
outside and eats women and
children and workers. Of course, I
ain't ever been a worker myself,
having been buttoned on your
nipple all my life, but mousey
dung told me what it's like. And
you know what? Some other
people have washed up on the
beach of this island and found out
the same thing and they want to
bite you too".
Mama Drofnats answered,
"Frankie, my boy, we all got to
make various adjustments in this
here life. I know that Dod is mean
and ugly, but he is very rich and
throws quite a bit of bread up on
our beach, and you and all the
people here eat some of it, like it
or not. We do toss him a crumb
now and then, to keep peace.
Being an old queen, it's a bit hard
to defend myself, so I suggest you
cool the comments or else you
can find your squirts elsewhere".
But Frank persisted in
criticizing Mama Drufnats
whenever he could. Although he
talked big he really wasn't very
brave. While he screamed ai Mama
for her affair with Dod, he paid
something every month to keep
Dod big and fat. While Mama
Drofnats' windows got trashed, he
delisted his address and phone
from the island's directory. No
sense taking any chances.
Obnoxious
When Mama Drofnats finally
got very angry and told him to
shape up or ship out, he said,
"Screw you, mama. I got

academic freedom, and I got
tenure". Mama Drofnats said,
"Freedom, schmeedom; tenure,
menure. You are an obnoxious
bastard and you want to wreck
my beautiful island". And she
writhed and she twisted until she
finally shook him off the nipple,
where he had still been holding on
with all his might.
Frank Brooklyn looked very
angry, and shook his fist
conspicuously, but he was really
happier than he had ever been
before. His argument with Mama
Drofnats was so long and so loud
that everybody on the island, and
on some other islands, and even
some people floating in the dark
ugly sea knew of him and saw his
picture in the newspaper. Now he
didn't feel neglected any more
and some of his squirty friends
got to rip off a lot of spoons and
forks from Mama Drofnats and
got their pictures in the
newspaper also and then they
didn't feel neglected any more
either. They were all jumping up
and down, riding along in Frank
Brooklyn's electric ego bus.
The children had listened
intently to grandpa's story, and
asked excitedly, "What happened
then, grandpa?"
"Let's save that for another
evening," he said, and sent them
off to bed.
