# Sanasardo Dance Company Displays Diverse Talents
## 
### CHRISSY DOUGLAS 
In another of the many fine
dance events scheduled for the
Bay Area this year, the Paul
Sanasardo Dance Company put on
a very impressive show last
weekend at UC-Berkeley. A strong
Friday night performance at
Zellerbach Auditorium featured
three Sanasardo choreographed
works, "The Myth," "Footnotes,"
and "Pain."
"The Myth," choreographed
by Sanasardo in 1971, with music
by Kodaly, is divided into two
parts. During the first part, three
dancers move slowly under blue
and green lights to the sound of
water dripping in a hollow
vacuum. The dancers move in a
world of preternatural stillness
where all movement is stripped
down to its barest essence.
The simplicity of movement
and rhythm lends a basic strength
to this section. However at times,
Sanasardo fails not only to relate
the dancers to each other, but
also, to adequately vary the
dynamics of the dance.
In the second section of the
dance, two couples, the men
dressed in black and the women in
red and purple, portray the
traditional elements of courtship.
Several parts of the dance were

very amusing, especially those in
which Sanasardo pokes fun at the
sterility of most male-female
relationships—a result of the
stereotyped pattern of love
relationships imposed on us by
society. However, a third
movement to the work was
needed, for it would have lent a
sense of symmetry to the loosely
related first and second
movements.
Strongest Dance
"Footnotes," choreographed
by Sanasardo in 1970, is the
strongest of his dance repertory.
It exhibits not only stimulating
choreography, but also ingenuity
in the use of stage props. The
basic prop is a series of screens
painted in bright abstract designs,
which move together and at other
times, separately, across the stage,
picking up and losing dancers
behind them as they move.
"Footnotes" has the eerie
quality which Sanasardo has
incorporated into all three of the
dances performed on Friday—the
sense that there exists a world
beyond our capability to
understand, a world which all the
dancers and the audience are
occasionally given a glimpse of,
but which we can never fully see.
This world lies (figuratively)

behind the screens and off-stage.
The sound effects of glass
breaking and of muttering voices,
leaves the audience on edge and
apprehensive about this "world
beyond." Sanasardo has the
screens sway back and forth as if
they are blown by a wind that we
can not feel.
"Footnotes" is also highlighted
by two ingenious pieces of
choreography. In one, a black
dancer holds a wooden rod from
which he dangles a bouquet of
white flowers, enticingly before
the ravenous eyes of a woman
dancer. Every time she reaches up
to take the flowers, he pulls them
away. Finally, they retreat behind
a screen and soon after the girl
emerges with the bouquet of
flowers in her hand, but without
the black man. The audience is
kept in mystery as to what
happened behind the screen.
In another section, Manuel
Allen dances blind-folded and we
are given the definite sense of man
as operating in a void, helpless and
alone.
Contained Intensity
In his last dance, "Pain"
choreographed in 1969, Sanasardo
juxtaposes frenetic and sustained
movement to the point where the
dance literally vibrates with
contained intensity. As in
"Footnotes," Sanasardo
successfully incorporates props
into the dance.
A large red metal structure
hangs from the downstage right
ceiling and opens and closes over
the writhing bodies of the dancers
below. The dancers are dressed in
grey sexless costumes and their
chaotic movement counters the
sustained tension of Sansardo's
solo movement, downstage left.
The sound effects by
Lutoslawski of many orchestral
instruments playing in dissonance,
makes the audience feel by the
end of the number, that their

nerves have reached "the end of
their ropes."
The dance draws to a climax
when Sanasardo stands up from
his crawling position, moves to
the front of the stage, and stares
at the audience as if reading its
conscience. A rare magnetism
eminates from Sanasardo at that
point.
Sanasardo's company, one of
the newer in modern dance, shows
good accomplishment and
promise. Sanasardo's diverse
talents give his company's
performance a fullness and zest
lacking in those of most other
companies.
