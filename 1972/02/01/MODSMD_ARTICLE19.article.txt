# Profs Foresee Major Earthquake
## 
### MARK WEAVER 
The year 1969 came and went
without a confirmation of the
doomsday prophecy that California
would fall into the ocean in the wake
of a tumultuous earthquake. But
sometime within the next 50 years, if
nature fulfills the scientists'
expectations, a large number of
Californians will lose their lives in a
massive earthquake.
"It's definite that we know an
earthquake is coming," warns
Professor of Geophysics Robert
Kovach, "The question is where, and
that's a difficult one to answer."
A number of factors are signalling
disaster for some part of the
earthquake state in the forseeable
future. Historically the state has had
an extreme earthquake (magnitude 8
and above on the Richter scale)
approximately every 100 years, which
means the follow-up to the San
Francisco quake of 1906 could occur
in the not too distant future. That
cycle, however, has been highly
irregular; such an earthquake could
come today, or not for 200 years.
San Andreas Slipping
Where a quake will occur is just as
difficult a question to answer.
According to Geophysicist James
Savage of the National Center for
Earthquake Research, "If it's going to
be great, it will probably be on the San
Andreas." There seems to be, he says,
"more relative movement across the
fault than is accounted for by the
creep (slippage along the fault), so it
indicates strain is building up."
Allan Cox, Professor of Geophysics
here, says that the places along a fault
where no creep is taking place are
most likely to have the immense
earthquake. "Between San Francisco
and Los Angeles would be the most
likely location," he speculates. Charles
Richter of the California Institute of
Technology expects the next great
earthquake in the state to occur on the
San Andreas fault somewhere in
Southern California. His second choice
is a repetition of the 1906 San
Francisco quake.

"The greater possibility," says
Savage, "is a moderate (magnitude 7)
but damaging one in the East Bay in
20 ot 30 years." It is known that on
the Peninsula the San Andreas fault is
not slipping at the present time and
the Hayward fault in the East Bay is
moving less than a centimeter a year.
Beyond that, there is much
disagreement.
Some interpret the inactivity on the
Peninsula to mean that pressure is
building and that the next major
earthquake will occur in this vicinity.
Assistant Professor of Geophysics
Amos Nur adds, "It doesn't have to
happen on the San Andreas fault.
Maybe the stress is distributed along
other faults."
Big Quake Inevitable
Scientists agree that one thing is
certain: a major earthquake is
inevitable and it is urgent we prepare
for it. Cox warns that if a magnitude 8
quake were to occur "within 200 miles
of San Francisco, it would have a
major effect." In 1906 the epicenter
was over 50 miles from the city;
nevertheless, some 450 people
perished as the earth ruptured. The
toll passed 600 when other areas
adjacent to the 250 miles of affected
fault are counted. In San Francisco
alone 250,000 persons were rendered
homeless.
The most permanent effect of the
quake was the massive displacement of
the Pacific side of the fault, moving as
much as 21 feet north, relative to the
continent. The effects were equally
dramatic at Stanford which lies 3 miles
from the San Andreas fault. Almost all
the newly constructed buildings were
damaged and many of them were
completely destroyed. Memorial
Church and the main library suffered
most severely while a statue in the
quad fell from its pedestal, being
buried in 3 feet of earth and concrete.
But the damage should not be so
extensive the next time. Both Cox and
Kovach agree that Stanford is much
more structurally sound than it was
before 1906 and should weather a
major quake more easily in the future.

But California is far more
populated now than it was in previous
extreme quakes. The relatively
moderate (6.6 magnitude) San
Fernando quake last year came
perilously close to becoming a
catastrophic event. Two weeks before
the earthquake, engineers lowered the
water behind Van Norman Dam by ten
feet. Had they not done so, the quake
would have caused the high water to
wash out the earthen dam, resulting in
thousands of casualties. Deaths would
have skyrocketed had the quake struck
during the rush hour. If the San
Fernando quake can cause half a
billion dollars in damages, property
loss could hit $50 billion were Los
Angeles ravaged as San Francisco was
in 1906.
Californians Still Apathetic
Despite these forebodings,
Californians remain curiously
apathetic. Maybe we just love
catastrophes and so do nothing about
it, ponders San Francisco columnist
Herb Caen. "The quake of 1906 was
really our finest hour. It was
considered the Golden Age of San
Francisco, something like the Battle of
Britain. Everybody looks back on it all
with nostalagia; it was the high point
of their lives," he says.
The Express Times, a San Francisco
underground newspaper, views it
differently: "Like if it hits the San
Andreas fault, certain portions of San
Francisco will probably fall into the
ocean . . . But they're not going to do
anything about it because that would
require social planning. And that
would be socialism. And this is the
U.S.A. We only plan wars."
Planning is more valuable than
predicting earthquakes. Cox says,
"The most important thing we can do
is to obtain better control of where
structures are built." It is known that
soft ground, such as fill, shakes much
more violently in a quake than does
bedrock. In that case, many people
living on reclaimed portions of the Bay
face a higher risk than others.
"There are small specific areas
where we should not build," advises

Nur, "Too many people build right on
top of the faults. One school in
Portola Valley is smack on the fault
and that's a bad thing to do."
Need For Safe Structures
Just as important is the need for
earthquake resistant structures. Most
modern buildings are safe but
construction standards for older
edifices and private residences have
been lax. Other precautions which can
minimize the impact of our next
earthquake include better construction
of freeway overpasses and the removal
from buildings of decorative facings
which fall off in a quake, accounting
for many casualties.
The individual can do some
planning of his own. It is always good
to have a week's supply of food and
water around the house, just in case of
a big one. In that event, the safest
thing to do is to stand in a doorway to
avoid falling debris.
Should the science of earthquakes
seem "iffy," that is because it is. But it
may not be so for very long. "My
guess is that in 5 to 10 years we'll be
able to predict pretty accurately where
an earthquake is likely to occur," savs
Dr. Cox.

Maybe the stress is distributed along
other faults."
Big Quake Inevitable
Scientists agree that one thing is
certain: a major earthquake is
inevitable and it is urgent we prepare
for it. Cox warns that if a magnitude 8
quake were to occur "within 200 miles
of San Francisco, it would have a
major effect." In 1906 the epicenter
was over 50 miles from the city;
nevertheless, some 450 people
perished as the earth ruptured. The
toll passed 600 when other areas
adjacent to the 250 miles of affected
fault are counted. In San Francisco
alone 250,000 persons were rendered
homeless.
The most permanent effect of the
quake was the massive displacement of
the Pacific side of the fault, moving as
much as 21 feet north, relative to the
continent. The effects were equally
dramatic at Stanford which lies 3 miles
from the San Andreas fault. Almost all
the newly constructed buildings were
damaged and many of them were
completely destroyed. Memorial
Church and the main library suffered
most severely while a statue in the
quad fell from its pedestal, being
buried in 3 feet of earth and concrete.
But the damage should not be so
extensive the next time. Both Cox and
Kovach agree that Stanford is much
more structurally sound than it was
before 1906 and should weather a
major quake more easily in the future.

But California is far more
populated now than it was in previous
extreme quakes. The relatively
moderate (6.6 magnitude) San
Fernando quake last year came
perilously close to becoming a
catastrophic event. Two weeks before
the earthquake, engineers lowered the
water behind Van Norman Dam by ten
feet. Had they not done so, the quake
would have caused the high water to
wash out the earthen dam, resulting in
thousands of casualties. Deaths would
have skyrocketed had the quake struck
during the rush hour. If the San
Fernando quake can cause half a
billion dollars in damages, property
loss could hit $50 billion were Los
Angeles ravaged as San Francisco was
in 1906.
Californians Still Apathetic
Despite these forebodings,
Californians remain curiously
apathetic. Maybe we just love
catastrophes and so do nothing about
it, ponders San Francisco columnist
Herb Caen. "The quake of 1906 was
really our finest hour. It was
considered the Golden Age of San
Francisco, something like the Battle of
Britain. Everybody looks back on it all
with nostalagia; it was the high point
of their lives," he says.
The Express Times, a San Francisco
underground newspaper, views it
differently: "Like if it hits the San
Andreas fault, certain portions of San
Francisco will probably fall into the
ocean . . . But they're not going to do
anything about it because that would
require social planning. And that
would be socialism. And this is the
U.S.A. We only plan wars."
Planning is more valuable than
predicting earthquakes. Cox says,
"The most important thing we can do
is to obtain better control of where
structures are built." It is known that
soft ground, such as fill, shakes much
more violently in a quake than does
bedrock. In that case, many people
living on reclaimed portions of the Bay
face a higher risk than others.
"There are small specific areas
where we should not build," advises

Nur, "Too many people build right on
top of the faults. One school in
Portola Valley is smack on the fault
and that's a bad thing to do."
Need For Safe Structures
Just as important is the need for
earthquake resistant structures. Most
modern buildings are safe but
construction standards for older
edifices and private residences have
been lax. Other precautions which can
minimize the impact of our next
earthquake include better construction
of freeway overpasses and the removal
from buildings of decorative facings
which fall off in a quake, accounting
for many casualties.
The individual can do some
planning of his own. It is always good
to have a week's supply of food and
water around the house, just in case of
a big one. In that event, the safest
thing to do is to stand in a doorway to
avoid falling debris.
Should the science of earthquakes
seem "iffy," that is because it is. But it
may not be so for very long. "My
guess is that in 5 to 10 years we'll be
able to predict pretty accurately where
an earthquake is likely to occur," savs
Dr. Cox.

EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE—A statue of Louis Aggasiz, located in the Quad, fell
from its pedestal into three feet of earth and concrete during the earthquake of
1906. Aggasiz's staiue, some say, looked better in the concrete than in the
abstract.
The year 1969 came and went
without a confirmation of the
doomsday prophecy that California
would fall into the ocean in the wake
of a tumultuous earthquake. But
sometime within the next 50 years, if
nature fulfills the scientists'
expectations, a large number of
Californians will lose their lives in a
massive earthquake.
"It's definite that we know an
earthquake is coming," warns
Professor of Geophysics Robert
Kovach, "The question is where, and
that's a difficult one to answer."
A number of factors are signalling
disaster for some part of the
earthquake state in the forseeable
future. Historically the state has had
an extreme earthquake (magnitude 8
and above on the Richter scale)
approximately every 100 years, which
means the follow-up to the San
Francisco quake of 1906 could occur
in the not too distant future. That
cycle, however, has been highly
irregular; such an earthquake could
come today, or not for 200 years.
San Andreas Slipping
Where a quake will occur is just as
difficult a question to answer.
According to Geophysicist James
Savage of the National Center for
Earthquake Research, "If it's going to
be great, it will probably be on the San
Andreas." There seems to be, he says,
"more relative movement across the
fault than is accounted for by the
creep (slippage along the fault), so it
indicates strain is building up."
Allan Cox, Professor of Geophysics
here, says that the places along a fault
where no creep is taking place are
most likely to have the immense
earthquake. "Between San Francisco
and Los Angeles would be the most
likely location," he speculates. Charles
Richter of the California Institute of
Technology expects the next great
earthquake in the state to occur on the
San Andreas fault somewhere in
Southern California. His second choice
is a repetition of the 1906 San
Francisco quake.

"The greater possibility," says
Savage, "is a moderate (magnitude 7)
but damaging one in the East Bay in
20 ot 30 years." It is known that on
the Peninsula the San Andreas fault is
not slipping at the present time and
the Hayward fault in the East Bay is
moving less than a centimeter a year.
Beyond that, there is much
disagreement.
Some interpret the inactivity on the
Peninsula to mean that pressure is
building and that the next major
earthquake will occur in this vicinity.
Assistant Professor of Geophysics
Amos Nur adds, "It doesn't have to
happen on the San Andreas fault.
Maybe the stress is distributed along
other faults."

of their lives," he says.
The Express Times, a San Francisco
underground newspaper, views it
differently: "Like if it hits the San
Andreas fault, certain portions of San
Francisco will probably fall into the
ocean . . . But they're not going to do
anything about it because that would
require social planning. And that
would be socialism. And this is the
U.S.A. We only plan wars."
Planning is more valuable than
predicting earthquakes. Cox says,
"The most important thing we can do
is to obtain better control of where
structures are built." It is known that
soft ground, such as fill, shakes much
more violently in a quake than does
bedrock. In that case, many people
living on reclaimed portions of the Bay
face a higher risk than others.
"There are small specific areas
where we should not build," advises

Nur, "Too many people build right on
top of the faults. One school in
Portola Valley is smack on the fault
and that's a bad thing to do."
Need For Safe Structures
Just as important is the need for
earthquake resistant structures. Most
modern buildings are safe but
construction standards for older
edifices and private residences have
been lax. Other precautions which can
minimize the impact of our next
earthquake include better construction
of freeway overpasses and the removal
from buildings of decorative facings
which fall off in a quake, accounting
for many casualties.
The individual can do some
planning of his own. It is always good
to have a week's supply of food and
water around the house, just in case of
a big one. In that event, the safest
thing to do is to stand in a doorway to
avoid falling debris.
Should the science of earthquakes
seem "iffy," that is because it is. But it
may not be so for very long. "My
guess is that in 5 to 10 years we'll be
able to predict pretty accurately where
an earthquake is likely to occur," savs
Dr. Cox.

EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE—A statue of Louis Aggasiz, located in the Quad, fell
from its pedestal into three feet of earth and concrete during the earthquake of
1906. Aggasiz's staiue, some say, looked better in the concrete than in the
abstract.
The year 1969 came and went
without a confirmation of the
doomsday prophecy that California
would fall into the ocean in the wake
of a tumultuous earthquake. But
sometime within the next 50 years, if
nature fulfills the scientists'
expectations, a large number of
Californians will lose their lives in a
massive earthquake.
"It's definite that we know an
earthquake is coming," warns
Professor of Geophysics Robert
Kovach, "The question is where, and
that's a difficult one to answer."
A number of factors are signalling
disaster for some part of the
earthquake state in the forseeable
future. Historically the state has had
an extreme earthquake (magnitude 8
and above on the Richter scale)
approximately every 100 years, which
means the follow-up to the San
Francisco quake of 1906 could occur
in the not too distant future. That
cycle, however, has been highly
irregular; such an earthquake could
come today, or not for 200 years.
San Andreas Slipping
Where a quake will occur is just as
difficult a question to answer.
According to Geophysicist James
Savage of the National Center for
Earthquake Research, "If it's going to
be great, it will probably be on the San
Andreas." There seems to be, he says,
"more relative movement across the
fault than is accounted for by the
creep (slippage along the fault), so it
indicates strain is building up."
Allan Cox, Professor of Geophysics
here, says that the places along a fault
where no creep is taking place are
most likely to have the immense
earthquake. "Between San Francisco
and Los Angeles would be the most
likely location," he speculates. Charles
Richter of the California Institute of
Technology expects the next great
earthquake in the state to occur on the
San Andreas fault somewhere in
Southern California. His second choice
is a repetition of the 1906 San
Francisco quake.

"The greater possibility," says
Savage, "is a moderate (magnitude 7)
but damaging one in the East Bay in
20 ot 30 years." It is known that on
the Peninsula the San Andreas fault is
not slipping at the present time and
the Hayward fault in the East Bay is
moving less than a centimeter a year.
Beyond that, there is much
disagreement.
Some interpret the inactivity on the
Peninsula to mean that pressure is
building and that the next major
earthquake will occur in this vicinity.
Assistant Professor of Geophysics
Amos Nur adds, "It doesn't have to
happen on the San Andreas fault.
Maybe the stress is distributed along
other faults."
Big Quake Inevitable
Scientists agree that one thing is
certain: a major earthquake is
inevitable and it is urgent we prepare
for it. Cox warns that if a magnitude 8
quake were to occur "within 200 miles
of San Francisco, it would have a
major effect." In 1906 the epicenter
was over 50 miles from the city;
nevertheless, some 450 people
perished as the earth ruptured. The
toll passed 600 when other areas
adjacent to the 250 miles of affected
fault are counted. In San Francisco
alone 250,000 persons were rendered
homeless.
The most permanent effect of the
quake was the massive displacement of
the Pacific side of the fault, moving as
much as 21 feet north, relative to the
continent. The effects were equally
dramatic at Stanford which lies 3 miles
from the San Andreas fault. Almost all
the newly constructed buildings were
damaged and many of them were
completely destroyed. Memorial
Church and the main library suffered
most severely while a statue in the
quad fell from its pedestal, being
buried in 3 feet of earth and concrete.
But the damage should not be so
extensive the next time. Both Cox and
Kovach agree that Stanford is much
more structurally sound than it was
before 1906 and should weather a
major quake more easily in the future.

But California is far more
populated now than it was in previous
extreme quakes. The relatively
moderate (6.6 magnitude) San
Fernando quake last year came
perilously close to becoming a
catastrophic event. Two weeks before
the earthquake, engineers lowered the
water behind Van Norman Dam by ten
feet. Had they not done so, the quake
would have caused the high water to
wash out the earthen dam, resulting in
thousands of casualties. Deaths would
have skyrocketed had the quake struck
during the rush hour. If the San
Fernando quake can cause half a
billion dollars in damages, property
loss could hit $50 billion were Los
Angeles ravaged as San Francisco was
in 1906.
Californians Still Apathetic
Despite these forebodings,
Californians remain curiously
apathetic. Maybe we just love
catastrophes and so do nothing about
it, ponders San Francisco columnist
Herb Caen. "The quake of 1906 was
really our finest hour. It was
considered the Golden Age of San
Francisco, something like the Battle of
Britain. Everybody looks back on it all
with nostalagia; it was the high point
of their lives," he says.
