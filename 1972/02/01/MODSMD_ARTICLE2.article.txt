# To Debate Controversies
## Ehrlich Appeals To Scientists 
### 
Biology Professor Paul Ehrlich called upon the
scientific community to develop "courtroom-style
forums" to assist the public in judging the sense and/or
nonsense in scientific controversies yesterday.
Speaking at a joint annual meeting of the American
Physical Society and the American Association of Physics
Teachers in San Francisco, he said, "the public cannot
differentiate unaided between sense and nonsense
emigrating from what they believe to be reputable
scientific sources."
According to Ehrlich, individual scientists with
controversial beliefs (he referred specifically to Stanford's
Nobel Laureate William Shockley and Professor Berry
Commoner at Washington University) should have their
theories subject to critical study and rational, logical
public judgement.
"Shockley's racial crusade and Commoner's one-sided
treatment of the complexities of the environmental crisis
are typical of a dangerous trend of politically active
scientists who appeal to the public for support when they
receive little or none within their professions," Ehrlich
warned.
He also called upon his colleagues to "face up to the
fact" that science has become thoroughly politicized. The
scientific world should be an effective and vital voice in
issues confronting society, and scientists must become
more involved in relating the facts, intelligibly, to the
public, he said.
Ehrlich told his colleagues they anp a potential
"pressure group for survival" but emphasized the
importance of their relating to the public in layman's
terms.

Ehrlich's conception of the "politicization" of science
called for a heavier emphasis on educating the public with
regard to scientific controversies. He felt that it was the
failure of scientists to present the public with an
understandable account of scientific developments which
was largely to blame in the misunderstandings aroused in
such recent issues as the STT and the Amchitka test.
Ehrlich suggested the creation of scientific forums to
offer analysis and trial of opposing views on controversial
issues. He reiterated that such an undertaking would be
geared to the public at large and that the forums would
attempt to couple technical facts with a layman's point of
view.
The forums would have "technically competent
judges" to rule on admissibility and validity of evidence.
The public would comprise the jury. Forums would also
include a process of formal cross-examination by the
judges, followed by a public release of the proceedings.
He felt that science should be a stronger, more
powerful influence with more involvement and concern
for public education and awareness. A "grassroots
approach" to such education would richly benefit
politicians as well as the public, he stated.
In quoting a statement from University of Michigan
scientist John Piatt that mankind is in the midst of a
"storm of crisis problems," Ehrlich urged his audience to
devote a small amount of its time to the solution of these
crises. He told the scientists that they had been
"divorced" from society for too long.
"Non-scientific society's" direction of too many
technologically-oriented projects has to be curbed, he
stated, and "if this trend is to be changed in time, we in
the scientific community will have to change it."
