Irish Protest Continues
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Rebel guerrillas in
Northern Ireland struck back with bombs, bullets and
defiant parades yesterday over the killing of civilians in a
clash with British troops.
The Irish republic to the south recalled its ambassador
from London and a gasoline bomb set fire briefly to the
British Embassy in Dublin. Firemen said the blaze
damaged some drapes and curtains, but was put out
quickly.
In Parliament in London, Roman Catholic militant
Bernadette Devlin assaulted British Home Secretary
Reginald Maudling—punching and scratching him and
pulling his hair.
When the gasoline bomb exploded at the British
Embassy in Dublin, hundred of chanting demonstrators
were marching outside. They were protesting the battle
Sunday in Londondery which took the lives of 13
civilians. The Sinn Fein, political wing of the outlawed
Irish Republican Army, called the protest.
The slayings, and the death Sunday in a London
hospital of a British army major shot in Ulster five months
ago, brought Northern Ireland's death toll in 2V2 years of
strife to 232. Twenty-six have died this month.
From the Vatican, Pope Paul VI sent a telegram to
William Cardinal Conway, archbishop of Armagh,
expressing his "deep sorrow" over the deaths in
Londonderry.
The Irish Republic recalled its ambassador in London,
Donal O'Sullivan. An Irish Embassy spokesman called the
move "the strongest protest we can make" without
rupturing diplomatic relations with Britain.
Prime Minister Jack Lynch of Ireland said he is sending
his foreign minister, Patrick Hillery, to New York to
consult with U.N. officials. Hillery also will visit "heads of
friendly governments" in a bid to set up an international
inquiry into the Sunday shootings.
The Irish Republican Army-the IRA-has vowed
revenge for the deaths in Londonderry.
At The Peace Table...
PARIS — North Vietnam denied yesterday it wants a
Communist government in Saigon, and said it seeks one
broadly based on national political and relgious factions.
Nguyen Thanh Le, Hanoi's spokesman at the Vietnam

peace talks, said Secretary of State William P. Rogers
"deliberately sought to deform our positions" when he
said Sunday night Hanoi insisted on "a government of
their choosing, a Communist government" which the
United States could not accept.
Le said Hanoi wants "a large government of national
accord" to succeed the administration of President
Nguyen Van Thieu. "This government, to be precise," said
Le, "would be composed of personalities of various
political and religious tendencies."
... And On The Battlefield
SAIGON — Hanoi has committed four of its five reserve
divisions to a campaign in South Vietnam but its course is
not entirely clear, according to an assessment by senior
U.S. officials.
Many theories are being advanced. One is that the
North Vietnamese may want to attempt massive
infiltration into the South just prior to a cease-fire, to be
in a position to attain their ultimate goal—a takeover of
South Vietnam after all U.S. and allied forces are
withdrawn.
Both U.S. and South Vietnamese military officials say
every indication is that North Vietnam will launch a major
offensive soon. One doubt is how many men they will
commit, or what role the four reserve divisions will play.
No-bra Look Troubles
CHICAGO — The no-bra look has its delights, both for
men and women, but two surgeons caution that today's
pleasure may turn into tomorrow's sorrow.
While there's no known medical harm from the current
fad, the doctors say, it hastens the day when a bra
becomes a necessity.
Writing in the Jan. 31 issues of the Journal of the
American Medical Association, they point out that the
ligaments which hold the breasts erect stretch without
support of a brassiere.
This causes the breasts to sag, and once the ligaments
are stretched they cannot be restored to their original
tautness except by surgery.
The doctors wrote in response to a suggestion from a
physicians that the American Medical Association warn
women that "the lack of mammary support may lead to
the development of pendulous breasts."

At The Peace Table...
PARIS — North Vietnam denied yesterday it wants a
Communist government in Saigon, and said it seeks one
broadly based on national political and relgious factions.
Nguyen Thanh Le, Hanoi's spokesman at the Vietnam

peace talks, said Secretary of State William P. Rogers
"deliberately sought to deform our positions" when he
said Sunday night Hanoi insisted on "a government of
their choosing, a Communist government" which the
United States could not accept.
Le said Hanoi wants "a large government of national
accord" to succeed the administration of President
Nguyen Van Thieu. "This government, to be precise," said
Le, "would be composed of personalities of various
political and religious tendencies."
... And On The Battlefield
SAIGON — Hanoi has committed four of its five reserve
divisions to a campaign in South Vietnam but its course is
not entirely clear, according to an assessment by senior
U.S. officials.
Many theories are being advanced. One is that the
North Vietnamese may want to attempt massive
infiltration into the South just prior to a cease-fire, to be
in a position to attain their ultimate goal—a takeover of
South Vietnam after all U.S. and allied forces are
withdrawn.
Both U.S. and South Vietnamese military officials say
every indication is that North Vietnam will launch a major
offensive soon. One doubt is how many men they will
commit, or what role the four reserve divisions will play.
No-bra Look Troubles
CHICAGO — The no-bra look has its delights, both for
men and women, but two surgeons caution that today's
pleasure may turn into tomorrow's sorrow.
While there's no known medical harm from the current
fad, the doctors say, it hastens the day when a bra
becomes a necessity.
Writing in the Jan. 31 issues of the Journal of the
American Medical Association, they point out that the
ligaments which hold the breasts erect stretch without
support of a brassiere.
This causes the breasts to sag, and once the ligaments
are stretched they cannot be restored to their original
tautness except by surgery.
The doctors wrote in response to a suggestion from a
physicians that the American Medical Association warn
women that "the lack of mammary support may lead to
the development of pendulous breasts."
Irish Protest Continues
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Rebel guerrillas in
Northern Ireland struck back with bombs, bullets and
defiant parades yesterday over the killing of civilians in a
clash with British troops.
The Irish republic to the south recalled its ambassador
from London and a gasoline bomb set fire briefly to the
British Embassy in Dublin. Firemen said the blaze
damaged some drapes and curtains, but was put out
quickly.
In Parliament in London, Roman Catholic militant
Bernadette Devlin assaulted British Home Secretary
Reginald Maudling—punching and scratching him and
pulling his hair.
When the gasoline bomb exploded at the British
Embassy in Dublin, hundred of chanting demonstrators
were marching outside. They were protesting the battle
Sunday in Londondery which took the lives of 13
civilians. The Sinn Fein, political wing of the outlawed
Irish Republican Army, called the protest.
The slayings, and the death Sunday in a London
hospital of a British army major shot in Ulster five months
ago, brought Northern Ireland's death toll in 2V2 years of
strife to 232. Twenty-six have died this month.
