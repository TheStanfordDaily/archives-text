# Police Recover Missing Bicycles During MECHA House Search
## 
### DAVE SPECTOR 
Police recovered nine bicycles,
some of which were reported stolen,
yesterday afternoon at the MECHA
House, following a report that a group
of bicycles were visible through the
house's bay window. No one has been
arrested and no charges filed.
The Mesa Directiva, officers of
MECHA, released a statement last
night saying "that MECHA students
did not have any knowledge of the
bicycles in the Casa. We feel this is a
direct attack by individuals who desire
to discredit MECHA.
' At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, 30 of us
met at the Casa. At that time the
bicycles were not at the house. Within
a space of six hours in the middle of
the day, the bicycles were moved into
the Casa. MECHA students had no
knowledge of this because we were at

Tresidder Union supporting the
struggle of Rafas Robles . . ."
A student, having been told by
friends that his missing bike might be
at the MECHA House, investigated on
his own and saw his bicycle among
others in the house. Notifying
Stanford police, he attempted to
reclaim the bike which he recognized
as his own. The Chicano students,
returning from the Campus Judicial
Panel hearing, allowed the student and
the policeman in, saying that he could
have his bike back.
Four Santa Clara Sheriff cars
arrived when the Chicano students,
according to them on their own
volition, were proceeding to transport
the remaining bikes to the Stanford
Police compound. Just previous to the
arrival of the Santa Clara County
deputies, two other students claimed

bicycles.
The deputies, proceeding without a
search warrant, removed the remaining
bicycles. The Chicanos also brought
the bicycles to the police compound,
where some were soon claimed.
Before the incident, the Chicanos
had been attending the first hearing of
the Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) in
the case of Rafas Robles. He is charged
with two counts of assault and one
count of forgery. The Mesa Directiva
regards Robles as "the first scapegoat
of the Stanford administration. His
case is a microcosm of what is
happening every day to Chicanos at
Stanford."
In regard to the hearing, a student
has alleged that "very nebulous
pressure" was exerted upon him by
the University administration to
testify before the CJP. He was asked
to testify against Robles on one of the
assault charges.
Mike Fromson told the Daily that
prior to the hearing the University had
sent him several pamphlets outlining
the penalties of suspension for
non-cooperation with the Panel.
Fromson said he "felt like a tool" of
the administration.
Special Assistant to the President
John Schwartz said the
non-cooperation clause in question
had been dropped along with the
Stanford Judicial Council. Schwartz
also said that the clause had never
been invoked against a student for not
testifying.
Fromson has said, "I don't think
that I ever wanted to press charges"
either in criminal court or with the
University. Robles was found guilty of
misdemeanor assault in criminal court
and was given three years probation on
the other assault which happened on
the same day of the alleged second
assault.

the day, the bicycles were moved into
the Casa. MECHA students had no
knowledge of this because we were at

Tresidder Union supporting the
struggle of Rafas Robles . . ."
A student, having been told by
friends that his missing bike might be
at the MECHA House, investigated on
his own and saw his bicycle among
others in the house. Notifying
Stanford police, he attempted to
reclaim the bike which he recognized
as his own. The Chicano students,
returning from the Campus Judicial
Panel hearing, allowed the student and
the policeman in, saying that he could
have his bike back.
Four Santa Clara Sheriff cars
arrived when the Chicano students,
according to them on their own
volition, were proceeding to transport
the remaining bikes to the Stanford
Police compound. Just previous to the
arrival of the Santa Clara County
deputies, two other students claimed

bicycles.
The deputies, proceeding without a
search warrant, removed the remaining
bicycles. The Chicanos also brought
the bicycles to the police compound,
where some were soon claimed.
Before the incident, the Chicanos
had been attending the first hearing of
the Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) in
the case of Rafas Robles. He is charged
with two counts of assault and one
count of forgery. The Mesa Directiva
regards Robles as "the first scapegoat
of the Stanford administration. His
case is a microcosm of what is
happening every day to Chicanos at
Stanford."
In regard to the hearing, a student
has alleged that "very nebulous
pressure" was exerted upon him by
the University administration to
testify before the CJP. He was asked
to testify against Robles on one of the
assault charges.
Mike Fromson told the Daily that
prior to the hearing the University had
sent him several pamphlets outlining
the penalties of suspension for
non-cooperation with the Panel.
Fromson said he "felt like a tool" of
the administration.
Special Assistant to the President
John Schwartz said the
non-cooperation clause in question
had been dropped along with the
Stanford Judicial Council. Schwartz
also said that the clause had never
been invoked against a student for not
testifying.
Fromson has said, "I don't think
that I ever wanted to press charges"
either in criminal court or with the
University. Robles was found guilty of
misdemeanor assault in criminal court
and was given three years probation on
the other assault which happened on
the same day of the alleged second
assault.
Police recovered nine bicycles,
some of which were reported stolen,
yesterday afternoon at the MECHA
House, following a report that a group
of bicycles were visible through the
house's bay window. No one has been
arrested and no charges filed.
The Mesa Directiva, officers of
MECHA, released a statement last
night saying "that MECHA students
did not have any knowledge of the
bicycles in the Casa. We feel this is a
direct attack by individuals who desire
to discredit MECHA.
' At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, 30 of us
met at the Casa. At that time the
bicycles were not at the house. Within
a space of six hours in the middle of
the day, the bicycles were moved into
the Casa. MECHA students had no
knowledge of this because we were at

Tresidder Union supporting the
struggle of Rafas Robles . . ."
