# Bomb Suspects Charged
## 
### 
Palo Alto police arrested two
Venceremos members yesterday and
charged them with carrying or placing
a "destructive device."
According to watch commander
Lieutenant Leo Peart, Leslie Nassan
and Janelle James were arrested at
3:30 p.m. in the parking lot of the
Palo Alto Medical Clinic.
Officers impounded their vehicle, a
1963 blue Volkswagen, towed it to the
police garage, and searched it
thoroughly yesterday night.
"Certain items were removed for
evidence and will be forwarded to the
(Santa Clara County) crime lab for
analysis," Peart said.
He also noted that, had a search
revealed nothing incriminating, the
two women would probably have been
released.
He said the arrests and search were
made because "reliable information

given to us," which included "the
license number and description of the
car," provided probable cause.
The search was conducted under a
warrant issued by Superior Court
Judge James O'Grady, authorizing the
officers to look for a "bomb device
apparatus" in the car.
Police sources indicate that the
material police are interested in was
lying in plain view on the back seat of
the vehicle.
Nassan and James were arrested
only after they informed officers who
had arrived to impound their vehicle
that they would not allow it to be
impounded unless an arrest was made.
According to witnesses, Donald
Criswell, a plainclothes officer, said
that the car was being impounded
because of a felony investigation
concerning a bombing.
