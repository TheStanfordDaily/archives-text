# Davis Trial Hearings Open, 18 Demonstrators Arrested
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
As open hearings began yesterday
in preparation for the Angela Davis
trial, 18 demonstrators were arrested
outside Judge Richard Arnason's
courtroom in San Jose.
While the demonstrators, led by
Angela Davis' sister, Fania Davis
Jordan, were being arrested and
booked, prosecution and defense
attorneys argued defense motions
which would force the prosecution to
divulge information acquired from
government sources which it has
received, and to reveal the content and
extent of electronic surveillance in the
case.
The hearings yesterday were
conducted amidst stringent security
precautions requiring everyone
entering the courtroom to produce
positive identification, submit to a
thorough frisk search, and pass
through a sensitive metal detector
after removing all metal objects,
including belt buckles, watches, pens
and coins from their persons.
Access to the courtroom area and
press room was also controlled, as
Sheriffs deputies required all
newsmen to wear specially prepared
press passes at all times, and excluded
everyone except reporters, from a
fenced-in area between the
Criminal-Legal building, where the
trail is being held, and the adjacent
Municipal Court building.
Demonstrators
The demonstrators were arrested at
10:40 a.m., shortly after the hearings
began at 10:20 a.m. About 75
spectators remained outside a 12-foot
high chain link fence after the 30
spectator seats provided for the trial
had been filled.
After the courtroom was closed,
the 18 protesters began to picket near
the courtroom, chanting "Free
Angela" and "We Have the Right to
Demonstrate," and carrying prepared
signs.
Sheriffs Lieutenant Don Tamm,
dressed in a new uniform, spoke
briefly with Franklin Alexander,
co-chairman of the National Defense
Committee for Davis, and then read
California Penal Code section 169,
prohibiting "picketing or parading"
near a courtroom with intent to
obstruct justice or "interfere with,
impede, or influence any judge, juror,
witness, or officer of the court in the
discharge of his duty," to the
demonstrators twice.
When the demonstrators did not
disperse or cease picketing, about 30
helmeted deputies moved in and
quietly arrested those picketing, while
allowing about 50 spectators and
newsmen in the area to remain. As

they were escorted toward the jail for
booking, demonstrators continued to
chant and give clenched-fist salutes.
After they had been booked and
detained briefly in the drunk tank at
the County Jail, the demonstrators
walked away from an unguarded
Sheriff's bus they were to be
transported in at about 1:30 p.m.
Deputies and matrons quickly
recovered the 18, who had moved into
adjacent parking lots to continue their
chanting demonstration.
The demonstrators appeared to
deliverately violate the California
statute in order to test it in court on
constitutional gronds.
Any court test may lose, however,
because of a unanimous 1965 U.S.
Supreme Court decision in Cox vs.
Louisiana upholding the constitutional
validity of an almost identical
Louisiana law.
According to Stanford
constitutional law professor Gerald
Gunther, the court held that a law
' protecting judges and the courts from
undue influence" did not infringe on
the first amendment rights of free
speech and assembly, even if the
speech and assembly were peaceful,
and would be protected in other
circumstances.
During the four-hour hearings,
Howard Moore Jr., head of Davis'
seven-lawyer defense team, argued that
Arnason should order the prosecution
to provide any information on
prospective jurors obtained from
sources unavailable to the defense,
such as FBI or state intelligence
agency files, to the defense attorneys.
If Arnason refused to order the
prosecution to divulge the content of
information from governmental
agencies or confidential sources,
Moore argued that he should require
the state to reveal information on the
nature and extent of this information,
so that "we may know about their
(the investigative agencies') direct
participation in this trial.
Moore maintained that this limited
disclosure was permissable under case
precedent, while a complete, more
general disclosure had previously been

ruled unnecessary by higher courts.
Assistant Attorney General Clifford
Thompson responded to Moore's
motion and arguments, asserting that
the defense would have ample
opportunity to examine prospective
jurors on their possible biases during
the voir dire, and that the state is not
obliged and should not be ordered to
provide this information to the
defense.
The judge took the motion under
submission.
The defense also introduced into
evidence a one and a half foot high file
of newspaper clippings in support of
its motions for a second change of
venue to a location other than Santa
Clara County-and in support of
motions for dismissal because of
prejudicial publicity.
The attorneys also argued a defense
motion requesting the judge to order
the proseution to divulge the extent of
any electronic surveillance used in
connection with the case, and the
content of any information obtained
by buggihg, telephone taps, or other
measures.
The defense filed an amendment to
their further supplementary motion
for discovery during the course of the
proceedings, and in arguing the point
Moore alleged that the prosecution
responses to earlier motions on this
matter were "either evasive or
insufficient and inadequate."
Moore said he "has reason to
believe that the prosecution has been
priviliged to information from
electronic surveillance" by federal and
state agencies.
Assistant Attorney General Albert
Harris, head of the two-man
prosecution team, replied, stating that
"the plaintiff has no knowledge of any
electronic surveillance of any kind."
The defense sought to question the
heads of various law enforcement
agencies to ascertain whether they
conducted any electronic surveillance.
Harris argued that it is not the duty
of the state to respond to
interrogatories, such as the defense
motion. He also noted that the defense
has no evidentiary basis for its motion.

adjacent parking lots to continue their
chanting demonstration.
The demonstrators appeared to
deliverately violate the California
statute in order to test it in court on
constitutional gronds.
Any court test may lose, however,
because of a unanimous 1965 U.S.
Supreme Court decision in Cox vs.
Louisiana upholding the constitutional
validity of an almost identical
Louisiana law.
According to Stanford
constitutional law professor Gerald
Gunther, the court held that a law
' protecting judges and the courts from
undue influence" did not infringe on
the first amendment rights of free
speech and assembly, even if the
speech and assembly were peaceful,
and would be protected in other
circumstances.
During the four-hour hearings,
Howard Moore Jr., head of Davis'
seven-lawyer defense team, argued that
Arnason should order the prosecution
to provide any information on
prospective jurors obtained from
sources unavailable to the defense,
such as FBI or state intelligence
agency files, to the defense attorneys.
If Arnason refused to order the
prosecution to divulge the content of
information from governmental
agencies or confidential sources,
Moore argued that he should require
the state to reveal information on the
nature and extent of this information,
so that "we may know about their
(the investigative agencies') direct
participation in this trial.
Moore maintained that this limited
disclosure was permissable under case
precedent, while a complete, more
general disclosure had previously been

ruled unnecessary by higher courts.
Assistant Attorney General Clifford
Thompson responded to Moore's
motion and arguments, asserting that
the defense would have ample
opportunity to examine prospective
jurors on their possible biases during
the voir dire, and that the state is not
obliged and should not be ordered to
provide this information to the
defense.
The judge took the motion under
submission.
The defense also introduced into
evidence a one and a half foot high file
of newspaper clippings in support of
its motions for a second change of
venue to a location other than Santa
Clara County-and in support of
motions for dismissal because of
prejudicial publicity.
The attorneys also argued a defense
motion requesting the judge to order
the proseution to divulge the extent of
any electronic surveillance used in
connection with the case, and the
content of any information obtained
by buggihg, telephone taps, or other
measures.
The defense filed an amendment to
their further supplementary motion
for discovery during the course of the
proceedings, and in arguing the point
Moore alleged that the prosecution
responses to earlier motions on this
matter were "either evasive or
insufficient and inadequate."
Moore said he "has reason to
believe that the prosecution has been
priviliged to information from
electronic surveillance" by federal and
state agencies.
Assistant Attorney General Albert
Harris, head of the two-man
prosecution team, replied, stating that
"the plaintiff has no knowledge of any
electronic surveillance of any kind."
The defense sought to question the
heads of various law enforcement
agencies to ascertain whether they
conducted any electronic surveillance.
Harris argued that it is not the duty
of the state to respond to
interrogatories, such as the defense
motion. He also noted that the defense
has no evidentiary basis for its motion.
As open hearings began yesterday
in preparation for the Angela Davis
trial, 18 demonstrators were arrested
outside Judge Richard Arnason's
courtroom in San Jose.
While the demonstrators, led by
Angela Davis' sister, Fania Davis
Jordan, were being arrested and
booked, prosecution and defense
attorneys argued defense motions
which would force the prosecution to
divulge information acquired from
government sources which it has
received, and to reveal the content and
extent of electronic surveillance in the
case.
The hearings yesterday were
conducted amidst stringent security
precautions requiring everyone
entering the courtroom to produce
positive identification, submit to a
thorough frisk search, and pass
through a sensitive metal detector
after removing all metal objects,
including belt buckles, watches, pens
and coins from their persons.
Access to the courtroom area and
press room was also controlled, as
Sheriffs deputies required all
newsmen to wear specially prepared
press passes at all times, and excluded
everyone except reporters, from a
fenced-in area between the
Criminal-Legal building, where the
trail is being held, and the adjacent
Municipal Court building.
Demonstrators
The demonstrators were arrested at
10:40 a.m., shortly after the hearings
began at 10:20 a.m. About 75
spectators remained outside a 12-foot
high chain link fence after the 30
spectator seats provided for the trial
had been filled.
After the courtroom was closed,
the 18 protesters began to picket near
the courtroom, chanting "Free
Angela" and "We Have the Right to
Demonstrate," and carrying prepared
signs.
Sheriffs Lieutenant Don Tamm,
dressed in a new uniform, spoke
briefly with Franklin Alexander,
co-chairman of the National Defense
Committee for Davis, and then read
California Penal Code section 169,
prohibiting "picketing or parading"
near a courtroom with intent to
obstruct justice or "interfere with,
impede, or influence any judge, juror,
witness, or officer of the court in the
discharge of his duty," to the
demonstrators twice.
When the demonstrators did not
disperse or cease picketing, about 30
helmeted deputies moved in and
quietly arrested those picketing, while
allowing about 50 spectators and
newsmen in the area to remain. As

they were escorted toward the jail for
booking, demonstrators continued to
chant and give clenched-fist salutes.
After they had been booked and
detained briefly in the drunk tank at
the County Jail, the demonstrators
walked away from an unguarded
Sheriff's bus they were to be
transported in at about 1:30 p.m.
Deputies and matrons quickly
recovered the 18, who had moved into
adjacent parking lots to continue their
chanting demonstration.

Harris, head of the two-man
prosecution team, replied, stating that
"the plaintiff has no knowledge of any
electronic surveillance of any kind."
The defense sought to question the
heads of various law enforcement
agencies to ascertain whether they
conducted any electronic surveillance.
Harris argued that it is not the duty
of the state to respond to
interrogatories, such as the defense
motion. He also noted that the defense
has no evidentiary basis for its motion.
As open hearings began yesterday
in preparation for the Angela Davis
trial, 18 demonstrators were arrested
outside Judge Richard Arnason's
courtroom in San Jose.
While the demonstrators, led by
Angela Davis' sister, Fania Davis
Jordan, were being arrested and
booked, prosecution and defense
attorneys argued defense motions
which would force the prosecution to
divulge information acquired from
government sources which it has
received, and to reveal the content and
extent of electronic surveillance in the
case.
The hearings yesterday were
conducted amidst stringent security
precautions requiring everyone
entering the courtroom to produce
positive identification, submit to a
thorough frisk search, and pass
through a sensitive metal detector
after removing all metal objects,
including belt buckles, watches, pens
and coins from their persons.
Access to the courtroom area and
press room was also controlled, as
Sheriffs deputies required all
newsmen to wear specially prepared
press passes at all times, and excluded
everyone except reporters, from a
fenced-in area between the
Criminal-Legal building, where the
trail is being held, and the adjacent
Municipal Court building.
Demonstrators
The demonstrators were arrested at
10:40 a.m., shortly after the hearings
began at 10:20 a.m. About 75
spectators remained outside a 12-foot
high chain link fence after the 30
spectator seats provided for the trial
had been filled.
After the courtroom was closed,
the 18 protesters began to picket near
the courtroom, chanting "Free
Angela" and "We Have the Right to
Demonstrate," and carrying prepared
signs.
Sheriffs Lieutenant Don Tamm,
dressed in a new uniform, spoke
briefly with Franklin Alexander,
co-chairman of the National Defense
Committee for Davis, and then read
California Penal Code section 169,
prohibiting "picketing or parading"
near a courtroom with intent to
obstruct justice or "interfere with,
impede, or influence any judge, juror,
witness, or officer of the court in the
discharge of his duty," to the
demonstrators twice.
When the demonstrators did not
disperse or cease picketing, about 30
helmeted deputies moved in and
quietly arrested those picketing, while
allowing about 50 spectators and
newsmen in the area to remain. As

they were escorted toward the jail for
booking, demonstrators continued to
chant and give clenched-fist salutes.
After they had been booked and
detained briefly in the drunk tank at
the County Jail, the demonstrators
walked away from an unguarded
Sheriff's bus they were to be
transported in at about 1:30 p.m.
Deputies and matrons quickly
recovered the 18, who had moved into
adjacent parking lots to continue their
chanting demonstration.
The demonstrators appeared to
deliverately violate the California
statute in order to test it in court on
constitutional gronds.
Any court test may lose, however,
because of a unanimous 1965 U.S.
Supreme Court decision in Cox vs.
Louisiana upholding the constitutional
validity of an almost identical
Louisiana law.
According to Stanford
constitutional law professor Gerald
Gunther, the court held that a law
' protecting judges and the courts from
undue influence" did not infringe on
the first amendment rights of free
speech and assembly, even if the
speech and assembly were peaceful,
and would be protected in other
circumstances.
During the four-hour hearings,
Howard Moore Jr., head of Davis'
seven-lawyer defense team, argued that
Arnason should order the prosecution
to provide any information on
prospective jurors obtained from
sources unavailable to the defense,
such as FBI or state intelligence
agency files, to the defense attorneys.
If Arnason refused to order the
prosecution to divulge the content of
information from governmental
agencies or confidential sources,
Moore argued that he should require
the state to reveal information on the
nature and extent of this information,
so that "we may know about their
(the investigative agencies') direct
participation in this trial.
Moore maintained that this limited
disclosure was permissable under case
precedent, while a complete, more
general disclosure had previously been

ruled unnecessary by higher courts.
Assistant Attorney General Clifford
Thompson responded to Moore's
motion and arguments, asserting that
the defense would have ample
opportunity to examine prospective
jurors on their possible biases during
the voir dire, and that the state is not
obliged and should not be ordered to
provide this information to the
defense.
The judge took the motion under
submission.
The defense also introduced into
evidence a one and a half foot high file
of newspaper clippings in support of
its motions for a second change of
venue to a location other than Santa
Clara County-and in support of
motions for dismissal because of
prejudicial publicity.
The attorneys also argued a defense
motion requesting the judge to order
the proseution to divulge the extent of
any electronic surveillance used in
connection with the case, and the
content of any information obtained
by buggihg, telephone taps, or other
measures.
The defense filed an amendment to
their further supplementary motion
for discovery during the course of the
proceedings, and in arguing the point
Moore alleged that the prosecution
responses to earlier motions on this
matter were "either evasive or
insufficient and inadequate."
Moore said he "has reason to
believe that the prosecution has been
priviliged to information from
electronic surveillance" by federal and
state agencies.
Assistant Attorney General Albert
Harris, head of the two-man
prosecution team, replied, stating that
"the plaintiff has no knowledge of any
electronic surveillance of any kind."
