## Campbell Ignores Valid Protests

In response to the interview of
W. Glenn Campbell by KZSU
Friday night, January 28, I wish
to call attention to some of the
statements made by the director
of the Hoover Institute on War,
Revolution and Peace. Campbell
was asked an assortment of direct
questions some of which
concerned the relationship of
Hoover Institute to the
University, to the equal
representation of differing
political views and to the public
service.
As described by Campbell,
Hoover Institute is a "living,
growing, changing institution."
Because of the disruptions to the
Institute by critics of the
Institute, Campbell was asked if
there was any possibility of the
Institute moving off campus.
After jokingly stating the obvious
physical difficulty, Campbell said
that not only is the Institute
legally a part of the University but
half the books in the University
are contained within the Hoover
library.
Campbell is extremely pleased
with the nomination of both
David Packard and William
Rehnquist to the board of
overseers of the Hoover Institute.
This prompted a question as to
the political ideology of the board
of overseers. Campbell stated,
"We do not select people at
Hoover on the basis of political
views." The nominees are
recommended by the board of
overseers and then go to the board
of trustees for approval. Campbell
was then again asked if perhaps,
considering the initiation process,
the board of overseers collectively
represented a right wing political
ideology to which Campbell

responded, "We do not give our
board of overseers political litmus
tests."
Marxist?
One of the interviewers asked
Campbell what the possibility was
of a practicing Marxist being
appointed to the board of
overseers. Campbell said he hoped
practicing Marxism does not mean
engaging in People's War and then
stated there were a few Marxist
scholars in the Institute. The
interviewer then changed
"practicing Marxism" to one who
advocates Marxism. Campbell
then stated the difficulty of a
Communist being an objective
scholar. The reason for this
according to Campbell was a
matter of democratic centralism.
The issue of public service was
then raised. Campbell said the
University had three main
functions: I) instruction, II)
research and development, III)
public service. Campbell takes a
"narrow view of public service",
stating that activist programs
become enmeshed in politics.
When asked if this feeling
included SWOPSI and SCIRE
programs Campbell said no
because they are student oriented.
One of the interviewers then
stated that Campbell is a regent of
the University of California and
asked if he prefers public or
private institutions. Campbell
expressed no preference but
favors a higher tuition for public
institutions in the interest of
higher education.
Autonomous
The Hoover Institute is an
autonomous Institute although
legally within the University.
Because ten years ago Campbell
decided to free himself from the

faculty board, Campbell now has
complete control over the
selection and rejection of his
researchers. The University has no
legal control over the Hoover
Institute other than the library
and aiding in the selection process
of nominees for the baord of
overseer?.
These statements speak for
themselves. How can a "living,
growing, changing institution"
ignore the innumerable protests
raised against it by faculty,
students and workers? How can
the Institute and members of the
Institute ignore the continual and
embarrassing exposure? If the
Institution is dedit ted to the
study of war, revolution and
peace how can it ignore the war,
revolution and struggle for peace
literally existing outside its doors?
If the board of overseers of the
Hoover Institute does not select
people on the basis of their
political views, how can the
director of the Institute
contradict himself by stating the
difficulty of a Communist
advocate being an objective
scholar?
Is it to be inferred then that
the Hoover Institute is supporting
any extensive research of political
ideology contrary to the
capitalistic system but not
allowing any research based on
active, continuing, practical
experience of certain political
ideologies contrary to the
capitalistic system?
Attack
The issue of public service
must not be stated as a question
but as an attack against not only
the Hoover Institute but the
entire University. As Dr.
Campbell, this University takes a

"narrow view of public service".
The University is in no way
invovled with the surrounding
community in the form of an
increased proportion of low
income housing or community
night classes as two of the many
needed reforms.
Nationally, as a public service,
the Institute is doing research,
publications and training scholars
about the Thrid World peoples
which enables the Untied States
government to "aid" these people
with civic action and training
programs designed more
efficiently through a better
understanding of the Thrid World.
In the interest of higher education
Dr. Campbell is limiting this
education to the select few who
are able to afford the rising
tuition payments, completely
excluding the greater percentage
of the population.

Because W. Glenn Campbell
has made himself unavailable for
public debate using only closed
radio and press interviews as the
medium for expressing his
viewpoints concerning Hoover
I feel immense
frustration with being unable to
directly ask the director of
Hoover Institute these quite
obvious questions. I see no reason
why Dr. Campbell should be
afraid to come out of his tower
and speak and debate freely with
the highly educated members of
this society. After all, if Dr.
Campbell does not feel at ease
with the people he places his faith
in, the highly educated, then what
is to become of him?
