## Self Doubts Hit Reporter 
###

One of the joys of being a
reporter is getting mail at the
newspaper from readers who are
impressed by your writing, and I
certainly got my share of joy last
week.
I was deluged with readers who
were impressed with my
writing—impressed with how
communistically pro-Bruce
Franklin it is.
One irate freshman said he was
"sick tired" (sic) of my
"propaganda" and advised me to
"quit it." Another said my subtle
pro-Franklin leanings .had
"tinged" my writing since
October, and that "a four-year old
child could detect it." He added
that my bias was even worse than
that of the associate editors—quite
an achievement, I suppose, since
between the two of them they
have seven years of experience on
the Daily compared to my one
quarter.
Cheap
Another one of my fans asked:
"What kind of a cheap journalist
are you anyway, comrade?"
These three writers were
referring to a story I did two
weeks ago on the ASSU
referendum on Bruce Franklin.
The headline ("Heavy Vote
Favors Franklin's Retention") and
a couple of things inside the story
apparently convinced a lot of
people that I think Franklin
should stay around.
All of this leaves me speechless
and quite embarrassed.
You see, I have been
maintaining to everyone in the
office that I am really a
conservative, that I think Maoism
is sheer idiocy, and that Stanford

would really be much better off if
Bruce Franklin were fired.
Lying
With all these letters, everyone
now thinks that I've been lying all
year, and that I can't be trusted.
And I myself am beginning to
wonder. Maybe I only thought I
was a conservative. Maybe all
these years there really has been a
monstrous liberal trapped inside
this right-wing facade, hammering
away, trying to get out.
But that's another question.
Since I got so much free advice
last week, I want to give out some
now—on this same subject, and on
a few related ones that have come
up before.
1. When you see a story that
looks like it favors one side, it
doesn't usually indicate prejudice,
it indicates incompetence on the
part of the reporter. It means he
was too stupid to write an
impartial story. If you are
sufficiently upset to write a letter,
don't call him prejudiced—call
him untalented. It hurts a lot
more, and he's more liable to pay
attention to what you say.
Headlines
2. The headline over a story
does not usually reflect what the
reporter feels, because 9 times out
of 10 he didn't write it. The night
editor is in charge of writing and
checking headlines; find out who
he is and write him a letter. I
didn't write the Franklin headline,
and I agree that it was pretty
ambiguous.
3. Merely because Daily
editorials seem to take a
consistent line on some issue, do
not assume that Daily personnel
agree with it. What goes into Daily

editorials is determined by a
group of 17 people, the Editorial
Board. Most Daily staffers aren't
on it—l'm not, for instance, and I
certainly don't agree with many
of the editorials we have run this
year. And since the editorials
reflect only a majority view of the
Editorial Board, there are even
some Edit Board members who
don't like them.
4. In answer to the question
"What kind of a cheap journalist
are you anyway, comrade?" I can
only say that Daily salaries being
what they are, I am a very cheap
one indeed.
I hope this satisfies some of the
more belligerent letter-writers and
keeps a few violent phrases from
hitting the wrong person. Even if I
am a cheap, pinko,
Franklin-symp.
