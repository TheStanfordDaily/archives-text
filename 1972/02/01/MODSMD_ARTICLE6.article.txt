Unprovoked Attack
Editor,THE DAILY:
The Tuesday, Jan. 25 issue of
the Daily made reference with
respect to Monday evening's
seizure of the Old Union: "No
injuries were officially reported
although one protestor claimed he
was clubbed by deputies." This
was followed by an editorial
Wednesday praising the police for
great restraint.
I maintain that there was an
unprovoked and inexcusable
attack on me as I walked between
Old Union and Tresidder enroutr
from late work (where I was
observed by several people) at my
department to the coffee house.
I was driven up against the wall
(despite my objection that I was
not a protestor and wanted to
leave) and clubbed by a member
of the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Department. A measure
of veracity is lent to this by the
black eyes and facial stitches I

have had to carry with me this
week. On the other hand, though
I am displeased by the threat to
academic freedom posed by the
dismissal of Bruce Franklin, I do
not want association with protest
elements alleged to have engaged
in common theft and vandalism.
It is unfortunate that Mr.
Franklin's somewhat valid attacks
on the Indochinese war and his
interpretations of elitism as
opposed to democratic centralism
and of theoretic education as
opposed to experiential (practical)
education seems to be followed
by such events and these are
apparently not disclaimed by him.
The matter of my assault is
presently under study by Santa
Clara Undersheriff Thomas Rosa,
to whom any witness of the
assault should refer.
E.P. Tilson
(Editor's note: The Daily has no
evidence that Tilson was in fact a
protestor. We regret any
implication that he was.)
