# ‘anti-personnel week’
## Defense Recruiting Continues 
###

"You can be sure if its
Westinghouse." The visit of
Westinghouse corporation
recruiters to the Placement Center
on Tuesday, February second,
starts off "Anti-personnel week,"
a week of fun and games in which
the Stanford Placement Center
and the administration attempt to
prove that they love all
corporations and government
branches regardless of race,
religion or effect upon the
Indochinese people.
After opening with RCA, the
22nd largest DoD contractor on
Monday, and Westinghouse, which
also makes anti-personnel rockets
in addition to its advertised
products, and Mobil Oil, 36th
largest DoD contractor on
Tuesday, Wednesday will feature
the Air Force Flight Test Center
and Beech Aircraft, which makes
cluster bomb dispensers.
On Thursday we will see the
return of Beech Aircraft, North
American Rockwell (Rockwell is
the seventh largest DoD
contractor and makes missiles,
bombers, and electronics), Sincer
Corporation (Singer is the 38th
largest DoD contractor and makes
anti-submarine systems, naval
combat systems, and various
electronics), Lincoln Laboratory
(an offshoot of M.I.T. which
permits Harvard-M.I.T. professors
to work on classified electronics
hardware), and Sandia
Laboratories (which work on
nuclear warheads and on other
nuclear applications to defense
work such as nuclear power
supplies).
Headlining the list will be the
United States Air Force, who,
despite their own denials still do

more military work than civilian,
including an admitted
participation in the Indochinese
war. Friday brings Food
Machinery Corporation which
makes Armored Vehicles,
Amphibious Assault vehicles,

antipersonnel mines, projectiles,
and firebombs. They have
apparently stopped making nerve
gas. These corporations have no
right to recruit people into their
death machine. People should go

to the placement center to
confront them about the effects
of their work.
Throughout the week we have
clear examples of how the U.S.
Government reacts to the struggle
of the Indochinese people to

control their own lives and how
Stanford supports the present
foreign policy by acting as a
training ground for the
corporations that produce the
materiels necessary for a technical

war in support of dictatorial
regimes.
On Friday morning at 9:30
a.m. in the Forum room of the
Meyer library we can see
Stanford's reaction to those
people here who want to have
some say in their lives by not
sitting quietly by while death
dealing corporations recruit at our
placement center. Four of us are
being tried before the Campus
Judicial Panel for allegedly
disrupting an interview of a
student with TRW corporation,
maker of electronic
countermeasure equipment which
allows U.S. planes to safely bomb
North Vietnam, communications
devices for the "electronic
battlefield," and guidance systems
for ballistic missiles.
The administration must learn,
just as the U.S. government is
learning, that those who seek to
control their lives without
arbitrary interference will not be
silenced by increased repression.
This week is not atypical for the
Stanford Placement Center in its
connection with the military, and
the Placement Center is just one
of the many ways in which
Stanford serves the interests of a
small corporate elite while
repressing any opposition that
seeks to change its policies. If
people here are ever to have any
say in their lives then both the
corporations whose interests
Stanford serves and the
intimidating mechanisms which
Stanford sets up must be exposed
as to what they really represent.
