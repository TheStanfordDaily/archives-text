## NLRB Ruling No Favor To Workers 
### 
bob griffin

The headlines in last
Wednesday's Daily boldly stated;
NLRB ALLOWS UNIVERSITY
EMPLOYEES TO ORGANIZE.
The entire article gave the
impression that the government,
through the NLRB, had bestowed
a big favor on Stanford
employees. This is not the case.
The NLRB did not "allow" us
to organize. We've been organizing

for over three years. The NLRB
does "allow" us to vote as to
whether or not we want to come
under their jurisdiction, following
their rules.
Their rules say that clerical
workers, about half of the entire
work force and nearly all women,
do not have the right to become
part of an organized labor group.
Their rules exclude a large
segment of Stanford's Third
World workers from joining with
other workers. Why? Because they
work at the Hospital and"the
Hospital is not directly connected
with the University." This would
be news to the Hospital workers
who were brought up on charges
for their alleged part in last years
sit-in at the Hospital. The charges
were filed by University officials,
not Hospital officials.
Presently, one employees
organization, United Stanford
Employees (USE), is composed of
a large number of Hospital and
clerical employees among others.
This decision to exclude these
workers from any bargaining unit
makes USE weaker, not stronger.
What the ruling has in fact done is
to exclude from the elections the

two most oppressed groups at
Stanford — a large number of
Third World workers and nearly
all the women workers. The
NLRB has in effect set up the
machinery for dividing the
workers at Stanford. Black against
white; women against men; white
collar against blue collar.
'Regrets'
Friday's Daily had another
story about the NLRB decision.
In the article President Lyman is
quoted as "regretting" the
decision to exclude Hospital and
clerical workers and to break the
campus up into three parts. "But
we shall, of course, abide by the
decision," says Lyman. Of course
he will. It's just what he wants; a
divided work force. He knows as
well as anyone else that a divided
work force has no power. To say
that he "regrets" the decision is a
travesty of truth.
First, he violated Section
8(a)(1) of the National Labor
Relations Act (NLRB) by
implying that the University may
in some way be threatened if a
union is voted in. This is a
misdemeanor and punishable by
up to six months in jail.

Second, he showed his
complete ignorance in the affairs
of labor and history with his
statement. Bruce Franklin was
correct when he said that Lyman's
book on the British Labor Party
"floats completely free of
history."
The NLRB decision to divide
the campus should not have come
as a surprise to Lyman or to
anyone else. The NLRB is a
government agency whose five
board members on the General
Council are appointed by Nixon.
The effect that the NLRB
decision will have on campus
should be obvious. With
Stanford's intimate ties with big
business and large war
corporations, it is clear whose
interests they will serve.
It is interesting to note that
any labor organization who wishes
to use the services of the NLRB
has to file an affidavit that they
are not Communists nor
supporters of subversive
movements. Is the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement
subversive?
The NLRB is the path to
compromise at the expense of the

employee, not the employer.
Workers acting together have the
power to change their conditions
and their lives. It is this power
that the NLRB will attempt to
co-opt. It forces the employer and
the employee into "collective
bargaining" before the workers
have a chance to assert their
power. It places the worker in a
position of weakness.
This is precisely what Nixon is
attempting in Indochina. He
wants the NLF and the North
Vietnamese to lay down their
arms and talk peace on Nixon's
terms. But since the liberation
forces in Indochina have the
power to win and are winning,
compromising with Nixon is
unrealistic. The same is true with
the workers at Stanford. We have
th power to win and we are
winning. We should have
"collective bargaining," but not
when the government or Stanford
dictates the terms. We will
continue to organize and end the
division among campus workers,
but we will do it on OUR terms,

does "allow" us to vote as to
whether or not we want to come
under their jurisdiction, following
their rules.
Their rules say that clerical
workers, about half of the entire
work force and nearly all women,
do not have the right to become
part of an organized labor group.
Their rules exclude a large
segment of Stanford's Third
World workers from joining with
other workers. Why? Because they
work at the Hospital and"the
Hospital is not directly connected
with the University." This would
be news to the Hospital workers
who were brought up on charges
for their alleged part in last years
sit-in at the Hospital. The charges
were filed by University officials,
not Hospital officials.
Presently, one employees
organization, United Stanford
Employees (USE), is composed of
a large number of Hospital and
clerical employees among others.
This decision to exclude these
workers from any bargaining unit
makes USE weaker, not stronger.
What the ruling has in fact done is
to exclude from the elections the

two most oppressed groups at
Stanford — a large number of
Third World workers and nearly
all the women workers. The
NLRB has in effect set up the
machinery for dividing the
workers at Stanford. Black against
white; women against men; white
collar against blue collar.
'Regrets'
Friday's Daily had another
story about the NLRB decision.
In the article President Lyman is
quoted as "regretting" the
decision to exclude Hospital and
clerical workers and to break the
campus up into three parts. "But
we shall, of course, abide by the
decision," says Lyman. Of course
he will. It's just what he wants; a
divided work force. He knows as
well as anyone else that a divided
work force has no power. To say
that he "regrets" the decision is a
travesty of truth.
First, he violated Section
8(a)(1) of the National Labor
Relations Act (NLRB) by
implying that the University may
in some way be threatened if a
union is voted in. This is a
misdemeanor and punishable by
up to six months in jail.

Second, he showed his
complete ignorance in the affairs
of labor and history with his
statement. Bruce Franklin was
correct when he said that Lyman's
book on the British Labor Party
"floats completely free of
history."
The NLRB decision to divide
the campus should not have come
as a surprise to Lyman or to
anyone else. The NLRB is a
government agency whose five
board members on the General
Council are appointed by Nixon.
The effect that the NLRB
decision will have on campus
should be obvious. With
Stanford's intimate ties with big
business and large war
corporations, it is clear whose
interests they will serve.
It is interesting to note that
any labor organization who wishes
to use the services of the NLRB
has to file an affidavit that they
are not Communists nor
supporters of subversive
movements. Is the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement
subversive?
The NLRB is the path to
compromise at the expense of the

employee, not the employer.
Workers acting together have the
power to change their conditions
and their lives. It is this power
that the NLRB will attempt to
co-opt. It forces the employer and
the employee into "collective
bargaining" before the workers
have a chance to assert their
power. It places the worker in a
position of weakness.
This is precisely what Nixon is
attempting in Indochina. He
wants the NLF and the North
Vietnamese to lay down their
arms and talk peace on Nixon's
terms. But since the liberation
forces in Indochina have the
power to win and are winning,
compromising with Nixon is
unrealistic. The same is true with
the workers at Stanford. We have
th power to win and we are
winning. We should have
"collective bargaining," but not
when the government or Stanford
dictates the terms. We will
continue to organize and end the
division among campus workers,
but we will do it on OUR terms,
