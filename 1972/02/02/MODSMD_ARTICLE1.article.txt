# Local Panther Group Runs 'Survival Programs'
## 
### GARY ATKINS (First of two parts) 
The words "Black Panther" have
commonly brought the image of guns
and violence to mind. But according to
several Stanford students, who have
addressed their message to whites in
the local communities for the last six
months, that image is no longer valid.
The students are members of a local
Panther auxiliary formed at Stanford
shortly after a split occurred in the
radical Venceremos organization last
summer. Called the Intercommunal
Survival Committee to Combat
Fascism (ISCCF), the auxiliary is one
of a number of such organizations
around the nation that administer
"survival programs" designed not only
to "serve the people," but to change
the image of the Panther party.
Their ideology is
"Intercommunalism," the doctrine
that about a year ago replaced "Black
Nationalism" and "Revolutionary
Internationalism" as the creed of the
Panther party — and the doctrine that
has made the image of guns and
violence outdated.
This does not mean Panther
rhetoric is not militant — members of
the local ISCCF still talk about the
"Revolution," but their actions are
directed to something other than just
picking up a gun.
"As revolutionaries, we see
ourselves dedicated to day-to-day
fulltime work setting up survival
programs and then moving toward
community control of those programs
while we move on to set up others,"
Miriam Cherry, the coordinator of the
local ISCCF, says. Cherry, who works
at Stanford in association with the
Catholic Newman Center in Palo Alto,
was one of the original founders of the
local ISCFF, having broken away from
Venceremos last July over the issue of
how best to make revolution.
Child Care Center
She now heads a survival committee
that administers a free child care
center in Sunnyvale, a free repairs
program in Mountain View and East
Palo Alto, free health education in
South Palo Alto and a free prison
bussing program in San Mateo county.
John Keilch, an assistant
coordinator, and two other ISCCF
workers teach a SWOPSI course on
'The Black Panther Party:
Intercommunalism in Theory and
Practice."
The survival programs, according to
a committee publication, are aimed at
giving "the people what should have
been theirs all along - the mere
necessities for survival, the right of
every man, woman and child — food,
clothing, shoes, education and proper
medical care."
Most of the local programs are run
in predominantly white suburban
areas, mainly because, as one worker
says, "we're white."
Also, "it's hard for whites to do
any organizing in the black

community — and, after all, there are a
lot of very oppressed white people in
the Palo Alto area too."
Members of the local survival
committee seek to avoid the
impression that they are involved in
conventional community service
programs. "All the programs aim at
trying to provide political education,"
Cherry says. All have political names
such as the George Jackson Bussing
Program or the Bobby Seale Repairs
Program. "We're trying to be up front
with the idea that this is political work
and not social work," Cherry says.
Split Occurs
But whether political work is
revolutionary is the key point that led
to the split in Venceremos last summer
as well as to a split in the Panther
party earlier last year.
Essentially, it's a matter of tactics.
Venceremos believes in the necessity
of armed struggle; the Panthers and
the ISCCF rejected that approach
when they adopted Intercommunalism
in 1970.
"We saw one-sided thinking in
Venceremos," Cherry says, "a
one-sided view that revolution was
based just on picking up the gun — or
on talking about picking up the gun.
We began to see that that was not
revolutionary organizing. We have to
beg the question on whether it is even
revolution. Revolution means 'in
motion.' Revolutionaries have to
constantly try to come up with new
ways to confront the power structure.
"When you keep relying on the
same forms every time — when, for
example, you throw rocks through
windows every time — you're no
different from the reactionaries. It
might be very reactionary to pick up a
gun at one particular time and very
revolutionary at another time."
The same issue was at least partially
responsible for last year's split in the
Panther party itself. At that time,
Huey Newton and FJdridge Cleaver
separated, with Newton urging
Intercommunalism and Cleaver calling
for armed resistance.
According to Newton, the Panthers
had become isolated from their
community support by offering only
the option of picking up the gun. "The
correct handling of a revolution," he
wrote "is not to offer the people an
'either-or' ultimatum. We must instead
gain the support of the people through
serving their needs."
The key to serving those needs and
to reestablishing a "lifeline" to the
community was felt to be the survival
programs. This time, however, the
community is not just the black
community. As the local ISCCF is
demonstrating, the lifeline can also
reach into the white suburbs.
Center Successful
The most successful local program
so far, according to Cherry, is the
ISCCF child care center in Sunnyvale.
Both black and white parents use the
center. "Instead of just having the

rhetoric about needing a child care
program," Cherry says, "we simply
began a program. We found a place
and turned it over for use as a child
care center. Then we went out to the
poor and oppressed and let them know
we were providing free child care."
"The poor oppressed who see the
programs think they're fantastic,
they're convinced that they are good,"
she says.
The opponents, Cherry says, are
"people who sit off to the side and
criticize, who try in various ways to
say that these programs are wrong
without investigating for themselves or
being themselves involved."
"And we get it from both sides,"
she says, "both reactionaries and from
so-called revolutionaries who call you
"racist sissy' as you walk by."
But the ISCCF members say they
are prepared to defend their programs.
"We believe the power state is violent
and brutal and kills people," Cherry
says,"and we believe that they will
attempt to wipe out these programs.
We expect to have to defend them,
and not just with words. We expect to
have to have armed struggle to do
that."
But not right now.

bussing program.)


DAY CARE—Members of a local Black Panther auxiliary group operate a successful child day care center in Sunnyvale.
The group, composed of whites who wish to reach the community through "survival programs," have broken away from
other militant groups that have urged more violent tactics of revolution.
