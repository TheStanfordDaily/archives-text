# 'Orpheus...' – A Good Multi-Media Show
## 
### DAVID WILLIAMS 
Offenbach's "Orpheus in the Underworld" was written in 1858, and
is a very witty paraody of the operatic styles then popular in Paris.
Orpheus, the arch poet becomes a total buffoon, while the chorus of
oepra seria is "reduced" to one character called public opinion. The
music is often Gluck-like and Offenbach includes some of Gluck's
most popular music in his score. Eurydice and Pluto carry on in
French mythological fashion, while Cupid is a complete parody of
Amour from Gluck's "Orfee." The choruses are often highly amusing
Gilbert and Sullivan like parodies of Rossini.
To be sure, any production of anything would have to be good in
order to counter-act the rain and the decidely unfestive pickets
without and the stark and all but unheated hall of San Francisco's
Palace of Fine Arts within. But the Michael Langineux directed
production did succeed with very few exceptions. Looking at the
negative first, one sensed that, the tempo was a bit languid, and at
moments wondered how much music il* any had been cut, for there
was occasionally no real contrast from one number to the next.
Secondly, the appearance of the can-can girls seemed dramatically
unprepared-for.
Except fot the ensembles, the singing was not remarkable one way
or the other—though Walter Matthes Jupiter, Ted Bakkila's Orpheus,
Cricket Waldeck's hilariously funny Cupid, and Susanne Stull's
Eurydice were all competently sung. The problem was that they were
all quite upstaged by the extravagances of Michel Langinieux's lusty
Pluto, and not done justice to because of the absurdly inadequate
acoustics of the Palace's auditorium. Happily for both singers and
audience, Offenbach includes a minimum of singing, and relies quite
heavily upon spoken dialogue to carry the action along.
Immense Dance Ensembles
The most spectacular part of the production, which was done here
at Stanford nearly a year ago, indeed the most spectacular part of the
piece, were the immense dance ensembles, a staple of French opera
since its inception in the middle seventeenth-centry. Needless to say
Offenbach treats those conventions with particular irreverance (I
suspect the can-can girls must have given the ladies something of
shock), and last night's dancing, as choreographed by Cherry Mir, was
generally engaging, though it often lacked smoothness and at
moments conviction.
The best dancer (the dancers were not specified in the program)
was obviously a person of real talent. If you see this "Orpheus" look
for a tall blonde in Pluto's retinue who does much of the lifting of the
female members of the cast, for there's no doubt he'll attract notice
for his performance. The can-can girls were lively enough, and the
three ballerinas, who do a strange production number with a male
insect in ballerina drag, were very good.
The costumes were kept to a minimum. Only Public Opinion's
costume reached below her knees, and Orpheus and Eurydice
appeared in their traditional Poussin tunics in the greek manner. Most
of the principle singers and dancers were nearly nude (Even Jupiter
and Pluto had to rely merely upon their cloaks for warmth), and since
that style is now general theatrical practice, the attempt to imitate the
shock that Offenbach's irreverance to classical values and standards of
taste inspired among his contemporaries was not entirely successful.
Still the presence of so much bare flesh on stage worked beautifully
with the quasi-orgiastic choreography, itself a witty embellishment of
Offenbach's design.
Good Set Designs
Akio Patrick's sets varied between large-scaled projections of
photographs of classical antiquities, and contemporary design motifs,
and worked well with the play. The orchestra was the least
professional partner in this theatrical venture, and in the overture one
suspected a lack of rehearsal time. The conductor, whose face was
familiar (though he too was not mentioned by name in the wholly
inadequate program notes), was on the whole rather sensitive to the
action, and the piece came off rather well I think.
If you like opera, musical comedy, witty Parisian parody, dancing
or French theatre in general, this is a production worth taking in.
