# Committee Satire Still Works
## 
### JOSEPH FIKSEL 
When the Committee Revue
originally opened away back in
1963, they were one of the first
satirical, improvisational theater
groups to achieve wide popularity.
Since then, their style has been
adopted, exploited, and
ultimately beaten to death by our
insidious television networks.
Rowan and Martin's "Laugh-in,"
for example, has deteriorated
from cleverness into mediocrity,
and is unable to satisfy the weekly
greed of its armchair audience.
The Committee is under
considerably less pressure, for
they can wait several months
before completely changing their
material, most of which is bom in
the course of live improvisation.
Still, they have been around a
long, long time, and it must be
difficult to fight off creeping
stagnation.
Viewed in this light, their new
show, The World is Mad (Part III),
deserves to be applauded. Despite
their occasional lapses into
innocuous buffoonery, they have
put together a lively, engaging and
often hilarious performance.
Using no props except for
chairs, relying on the strength of
their gestures and facial
expressions to create atmosphere,
the Committee presents a
succession of short, independent
sketches. Humor is always the
keynote—usually they begin with
an incongruous situation, develop
it to absurd proportions, and
then, su d denly—punchline
blackout!
But the concluding laugh is just
the icing on the cake. Most of
their dialogue is punctuated with
wit, and the characters that they
portray are convincing caricatures.
It is their consistent ability to
mirror the ironies, the insanity of
our culture, that makes the
Committee not just entertainers
but artists.
One of their best numbers was
"Crazed Cop", wherein Morgan
Upton plays a tough,

trigger-happy patrolman, the
embodiment of the malevolent
"pig", who is summoned before
his police commissioner. The cop
has shot down eighteen people in
the last week, including his own
partner, and the commissioner is
hard-pressed to defend his good
intentions against public outrage.
This is the kind of social satire in
which the Committee excels.
Another highlight was the
"Courtroom" scene, in which a
black man (David Moody) is being
sentenced for ignoring his
twenty-two parking violations.
Suddenly, a street revolutionary
bursts in, heavily armed—he had
intended to rescue one of his
cohorts, but blundered into the
wrong courtroom. Undaunted, he
forces judge and defendant to
exchange places, and order a
mock trial. John Brent is
especially funny as the state
prosecutor, raising a trembling fist
and chanting obsequiously "All
power to the people."
Occasionally, their parody can
become trite and even
monotonous, as in the sketch
where a sadistic father torments
his daugher's elderly date, or the
one where a husband comes home
from work to find that his wife,
who expanded her consciousness
through meditation, has burned
all their furniture. These are
TV-serial gags, and do not live up
to the incisive potential of this
talented company. However, one
can forgive them a few
indulgences; after all, they have
been around a long time.
For the audience, seeing the
Committee is an exciting
experience because you have a
chance to actually participate.
The actors address you with a
congenial informality, minimizing
the sense of separation between
floor and stage. A good portion of
their show is improvisational in
form; that is, they ask the
audience to suggest topics or
phrases in various categories, and

then instantly build a sketch
around them.
The most original and amusing
improvisation that they did was
their final episode, the
"Emotional Symphony". The
spectators were asked to name an
emotion for each actor to express.
Then the piano-player, a
long-haired maestro supposedly
called Dr. Gosling Trauma,
proceeded to conduct the actors
as a symphonic quintet, guiding
them carefully through crescendos
and dimineuendos as they
sputtered with anger or gasped
with simulated passion.
And so ends a refreshing
evening with the Committee, a
delightful reminder that the world
is indeed mad, and that laughter
may be our one salvation.

but artists.
One of their best numbers was
"Crazed Cop", wherein Morgan
Upton plays a tough,

trigger-happy patrolman, the
embodiment of the malevolent
"pig", who is summoned before
his police commissioner. The cop
has shot down eighteen people in
the last week, including his own
partner, and the commissioner is
hard-pressed to defend his good
intentions against public outrage.
This is the kind of social satire in
which the Committee excels.
Another highlight was the
"Courtroom" scene, in which a
black man (David Moody) is being
sentenced for ignoring his
twenty-two parking violations.
Suddenly, a street revolutionary
bursts in, heavily armed—he had
intended to rescue one of his
cohorts, but blundered into the
wrong courtroom. Undaunted, he
forces judge and defendant to
exchange places, and order a
mock trial. John Brent is
especially funny as the state
prosecutor, raising a trembling fist
and chanting obsequiously "All
power to the people."
Occasionally, their parody can
become trite and even
monotonous, as in the sketch
where a sadistic father torments
his daugher's elderly date, or the
one where a husband comes home
from work to find that his wife,
who expanded her consciousness
through meditation, has burned
all their furniture. These are
TV-serial gags, and do not live up
to the incisive potential of this
talented company. However, one
can forgive them a few
indulgences; after all, they have
been around a long time.
For the audience, seeing the
Committee is an exciting
experience because you have a
chance to actually participate.
The actors address you with a
congenial informality, minimizing
the sense of separation between
floor and stage. A good portion of
their show is improvisational in
form; that is, they ask the
audience to suggest topics or
phrases in various categories, and

then instantly build a sketch
around them.
The most original and amusing
improvisation that they did was
their final episode, the
"Emotional Symphony". The
spectators were asked to name an
emotion for each actor to express.
Then the piano-player, a
long-haired maestro supposedly
called Dr. Gosling Trauma,
proceeded to conduct the actors
as a symphonic quintet, guiding
them carefully through crescendos
and dimineuendos as they
sputtered with anger or gasped
with simulated passion.
And so ends a refreshing
evening with the Committee, a
delightful reminder that the world
is indeed mad, and that laughter
may be our one salvation.

When the Committee Revue
originally opened away back in
1963, they were one of the first
satirical, improvisational theater
groups to achieve wide popularity.
Since then, their style has been
adopted, exploited, and
ultimately beaten to death by our
insidious television networks.
Rowan and Martin's "Laugh-in,"
for example, has deteriorated
from cleverness into mediocrity,
and is unable to satisfy the weekly
greed of its armchair audience.
The Committee is under
considerably less pressure, for
they can wait several months
before completely changing their
material, most of which is bom in
the course of live improvisation.
Still, they have been around a
long, long time, and it must be
difficult to fight off creeping
stagnation.
Viewed in this light, their new
show, The World is Mad (Part III),
deserves to be applauded. Despite
their occasional lapses into
innocuous buffoonery, they have
put together a lively, engaging and
often hilarious performance.
Using no props except for
chairs, relying on the strength of
their gestures and facial
expressions to create atmosphere,
the Committee presents a
succession of short, independent
sketches. Humor is always the
keynote—usually they begin with
an incongruous situation, develop
it to absurd proportions, and
then, su d denly—punchline
blackout!
But the concluding laugh is just
the icing on the cake. Most of
their dialogue is punctuated with
wit, and the characters that they
portray are convincing caricatures.
It is their consistent ability to
mirror the ironies, the insanity of
our culture, that makes the
Committee not just entertainers
but artists.
