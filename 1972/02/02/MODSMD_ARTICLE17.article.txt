### 
Palo Alto police have dropped
charges against Venceremos
members Leslie Nassan and
Manelle James when components
of a "destructive device" they
carried in their car turned out to
be two pieces of pipe.
The two women were arrested
yesterday at 4 p.m. in the parking
lot of the Palo Alto Medical
Center. Police impounded James'
car, acting on a tip that it
contained bomb parts.

A box in the car "was believed
to contain paraphernalia for
making bombs" according to
"reliable information" received by
the department, Capt. Gary
Tatum said yesterday. Because the
box contained only some dirt and
the pieces of pipe, the women
were released at 2:30 a.m.
yesterday and legally deemed
"not arrested," under a state
penal code.
