# Card Golfers Open NCAA Title Quest
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
National championships are
nothing new for Stanford golf
coach Bud Finger. He played on
Stanford's 1939 and 1941 NCAA
champions and coached the
Indians to the national title in
1953. Finger hopes to increase his
collection of championships to
four with a Stanford victory in
the 1972 NCAA tournament.
This year's Stanford team
certainly has the material to reach
the top. Senior Gary Vanier leads
an exceptional group of talented
players who will open their season
Friday at Stanford against Cal
State—Hayward.
Vanier is the defending San
Francisco City champion and won
the U.S. Collegiate Invitational
two years ago at Stanford. He
shot 69-69-73 last week to lead
the qualifying for positions on the
team.
Top Freshmen
Freshman Bruce Robertson
also has an impressive list of past
accomplishments. He was medalist
in the Trans-Mississippi Amateur
last summer at Spyglass against a
strong national field. Robertson
shot an amazing five under par 66
at Stanford this fall.
Aly Trompas is another
freshman who will play a key role
on the Indian varsity. Trompas,
the 1969 U.S. Junior champion,
gained some valuable experience
last month when he qualified for
the Glen Campbell-Los Angeles
Open. Playing against the likes of
Arnold Palmer and Lee Trevino,
Trompas shot very respectable
rounds of 74 and 72 and missed
the cut by three shots.
Tom Keelin, a long hitter who
starred on the 1970 varsity,
returns after a year at Stanford in
Italy. Keelin missed a share of the
Pac-8 individual championship by
just one stroke as a sophomore.
Freshman Conrad Nilmeier and
sophomore Steve Collins round
out starting team for Friday's
match against Hayward and
Saturday's match against Santa
Clara. Nilmeier, a consistent
player with a very sound golf
swing, qualified for the team
impressively with rounds of
73-78-72. Collins shot a final
round 71 to earn a spot on the
varsity.
Finger is enthusiastic about
this year's team, especially its
depth. "We definitely have a good

shot at the NCAA title," he says.
"It's just a matter of which team
has four players playing well at
the right time."
Ranked Fifth
Stanford was picked fifth in
the nation in a preseason coaches'
poll. Last year the Indians
finished eighth in the NCAA
tournament after winning the U.S.
Collegiate Invitiational but placing
a disappointing third in the Pac-8.
Stanford had won the conference
title in 1969 and 1970.
Finger's toughest decision of
the year will be choosing the five
men who will go to the nationals.
Besides the six who are starting
the first two matches, there are
several other strong contenders.
Senior Peter Harpster was sick
during the qualifying rounds but
will be counted on heavily later in
the season. Harpster has been a
solid performer for two years,
nearly always finishing very well
in major events.
Other possible varsity starters
include sophomore Dennis
Conrad, junior Denny Coldfin,
seniors Jim Dwulett and Sandy
McCall, and freshmen Dave
Baskins and Mike McGowan.
Baskins, McGowan, and George
Pettinger should form the nucleus
of Stanford's strong freshman
team. The frosh have already
posted easy victories over Foothill
and Merritt.
Finger feels that at least five of
his players have the ability to join
last year's Stanford ace Tom
Watson on the pro tour. "I have
no doubt that Vanier, Trompas,
Robertson, Keelin, and Nilmeier
have the ability to play
professionally if they decide to
take a shot at it."
Tourneys
The Indians will compete in
five major tournaments besides
their dual meet schedule. These
include the Fresno Classic, the
Western Intercollegiates,
Stanford's U.S. Collegiate
Invitational, the Pac-8, and the
NCAA tournament in Florida this
June.
"There are so many good
teams this year that it would be
quite an accomplishment to win
any one of these tournaments,"
says Finger.
But the 23 year Stanford coach
hastily added, "If I had my
choice, I'd certainly pick the big
one in Florida."

players who will open their season
Friday at Stanford against Cal
State—Hayward.
Vanier is the defending San
Francisco City champion and won
the U.S. Collegiate Invitational
two years ago at Stanford. He
shot 69-69-73 last week to lead
the qualifying for positions on the
team.
Top Freshmen
Freshman Bruce Robertson
also has an impressive list of past
accomplishments. He was medalist
in the Trans-Mississippi Amateur
last summer at Spyglass against a
strong national field. Robertson
shot an amazing five under par 66
at Stanford this fall.
Aly Trompas is another
freshman who will play a key role
on the Indian varsity. Trompas,
the 1969 U.S. Junior champion,
gained some valuable experience
last month when he qualified for
the Glen Campbell-Los Angeles
Open. Playing against the likes of
Arnold Palmer and Lee Trevino,
Trompas shot very respectable
rounds of 74 and 72 and missed
the cut by three shots.
Tom Keelin, a long hitter who
starred on the 1970 varsity,
returns after a year at Stanford in
Italy. Keelin missed a share of the
Pac-8 individual championship by
just one stroke as a sophomore.
Freshman Conrad Nilmeier and
sophomore Steve Collins round
out starting team for Friday's
match against Hayward and
Saturday's match against Santa
Clara. Nilmeier, a consistent
player with a very sound golf
swing, qualified for the team
impressively with rounds of
73-78-72. Collins shot a final
round 71 to earn a spot on the
varsity.
Finger is enthusiastic about
this year's team, especially its
depth. "We definitely have a good

shot at the NCAA title," he says.
"It's just a matter of which team
has four players playing well at
the right time."
Ranked Fifth
Stanford was picked fifth in
the nation in a preseason coaches'
poll. Last year the Indians
finished eighth in the NCAA
tournament after winning the U.S.
Collegiate Invitiational but placing
a disappointing third in the Pac-8.
Stanford had won the conference
title in 1969 and 1970.
Finger's toughest decision of
the year will be choosing the five
men who will go to the nationals.
Besides the six who are starting
the first two matches, there are
several other strong contenders.
Senior Peter Harpster was sick
during the qualifying rounds but
will be counted on heavily later in
the season. Harpster has been a
solid performer for two years,
nearly always finishing very well
in major events.
Other possible varsity starters
include sophomore Dennis
Conrad, junior Denny Coldfin,
seniors Jim Dwulett and Sandy
McCall, and freshmen Dave
Baskins and Mike McGowan.
Baskins, McGowan, and George
Pettinger should form the nucleus
of Stanford's strong freshman
team. The frosh have already
posted easy victories over Foothill
and Merritt.
Finger feels that at least five of
his players have the ability to join
last year's Stanford ace Tom
Watson on the pro tour. "I have
no doubt that Vanier, Trompas,
Robertson, Keelin, and Nilmeier
have the ability to play
professionally if they decide to
take a shot at it."
Tourneys
The Indians will compete in
five major tournaments besides
their dual meet schedule. These
include the Fresno Classic, the
Western Intercollegiates,
Stanford's U.S. Collegiate
Invitational, the Pac-8, and the
NCAA tournament in Florida this
June.
"There are so many good
teams this year that it would be
quite an accomplishment to win
any one of these tournaments,"
says Finger.
But the 23 year Stanford coach
hastily added, "If I had my
choice, I'd certainly pick the big
one in Florida."

shot an amazing five under par 66
at Stanford this fall.
Aly Trompas is another
freshman who will play a key role
on the Indian varsity. Trompas,
the 1969 U.S. Junior champion,
gained some valuable experience
last month when he qualified for
the Glen Campbell-Los Angeles
Open. Playing against the likes of
Arnold Palmer and Lee Trevino,
Trompas shot very respectable
rounds of 74 and 72 and missed
the cut by three shots.
Tom Keelin, a long hitter who
starred on the 1970 varsity,
returns after a year at Stanford in
Italy. Keelin missed a share of the
Pac-8 individual championship by
just one stroke as a sophomore.
Freshman Conrad Nilmeier and
sophomore Steve Collins round
out starting team for Friday's
match against Hayward and
Saturday's match against Santa
Clara. Nilmeier, a consistent
player with a very sound golf
swing, qualified for the team
impressively with rounds of
73-78-72. Collins shot a final
round 71 to earn a spot on the
varsity.
Finger is enthusiastic about
this year's team, especially its
depth. "We definitely have a good

shot at the NCAA title," he says.
"It's just a matter of which team
has four players playing well at
the right time."
Ranked Fifth
Stanford was picked fifth in
the nation in a preseason coaches'
poll. Last year the Indians
finished eighth in the NCAA
tournament after winning the U.S.
Collegiate Invitiational but placing
a disappointing third in the Pac-8.
Stanford had won the conference
title in 1969 and 1970.
Finger's toughest decision of
the year will be choosing the five
men who will go to the nationals.
Besides the six who are starting
the first two matches, there are
several other strong contenders.
Senior Peter Harpster was sick
during the qualifying rounds but
will be counted on heavily later in
the season. Harpster has been a
solid performer for two years,
nearly always finishing very well
in major events.
Other possible varsity starters
include sophomore Dennis
Conrad, junior Denny Coldfin,
seniors Jim Dwulett and Sandy
McCall, and freshmen Dave
Baskins and Mike McGowan.
Baskins, McGowan, and George
Pettinger should form the nucleus
of Stanford's strong freshman
team. The frosh have already
posted easy victories over Foothill
and Merritt.
Finger feels that at least five of
his players have the ability to join
last year's Stanford ace Tom
Watson on the pro tour. "I have
no doubt that Vanier, Trompas,
Robertson, Keelin, and Nilmeier
have the ability to play
professionally if they decide to
take a shot at it."
Tourneys
The Indians will compete in
five major tournaments besides
their dual meet schedule. These
include the Fresno Classic, the
Western Intercollegiates,
Stanford's U.S. Collegiate
Invitational, the Pac-8, and the
NCAA tournament in Florida this
June.
"There are so many good
teams this year that it would be
quite an accomplishment to win
any one of these tournaments,"
says Finger.
But the 23 year Stanford coach
hastily added, "If I had my
choice, I'd certainly pick the big
one in Florida."

middle linebacker, was the first round choice of the Minnesota
Vikings in yesterday's college draft. Siemon will shore up the Vikes'
Purple Gang defense, best in the pros last season.

THE OLD AND THE NEW—Freshman Bruce Robertson (left) and
Senior Gary Vanier (right) will help lead the 1972 Stanford Golf team
on its quest for the NCAA title. Coach Bud Finger's squad is ranked
fifth in the country in a pre-season coaches poll. Vanier is the
defending San Francisco City champion and Robertson won the
Trans-Mississippi Amateur last summer. Robertson also has recorded
an impressive round of 66 on the Stanford Golf Course this year. The
Indians will open their season with Cal-State Hayward this Friday at
home in a match beginning at 12:30 p.m.
