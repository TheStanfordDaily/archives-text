Coach Dick Gould told the

played well but if we're going to

to have to do better."

"encouraged by the young
players" and especially by "three
super treshmen:" Chico Hagey,
Chip Fisher and Jim Delaney.
Gould also said he was also
pleased with the performances of
freshmen Scott Matheson and
Earle Craig.

competition, Gould said "USC is

probably the favorite, at least on
the basis of the Amateur Indoors.
UCLA is going to be tougher than
I thought they would be."

the championship in 30 years."
