# Lyman Eyes Mascot Change, Discusses New Judicial System
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
President Richard Lyman indicated
last night that he sympathizes with the
efforts of Native American students to
change the University mascot.
During a KZSU press conference,
Lyman stated he will receive petitions
to end the use of the Indian as the
mascot of the school's athletic teams
"with an open mind, and I might go
further to say, with a good deal of
sympathy."
Lyman stated that in his original
talks with Native American students
he suggested that the "serious and
dignified use of the Indian as a symbol
of Stanford athletic endeavors might
further the cause of Native

Americans."
However, he continued, the
students argued that such use actually
only obscured the plight of Native
Americans. "I must admit that I am
more and more persuaded by that
argument as time goes on," concluded
Lyman.
The President opened the live
student press conference with a
prepared statement answering a KZSU
editorial on the Franklin decision. "It
is a myth that all speech is
constitutionally protected," Lyman
said. "No constitutional lawyer in the
land — no, not even Mr. Dershowitz,
the Harvard Law Professor come to
Stanford to save us all from sin — not

even Mr. Dershowitz would make such
a sweeping claim."
NLRB Decision
Lyman also discussed the National
Labor Relations Board decision which
divided the University staff into three
constituencies for the upcoming
elections which will determine their
union representation.
Explaining an earlier statement that
the administration regretted the
decision, he remarked, "Our argument
was that a community of interest
exists which includes all workers on
the campus, including the clerical
staff."
Lyman added he was "amused by
accusations that we [the University
Administration] did not want the
larger unit," and noted that, "the split
could have been worse. We are not
strongly dissatisfied with the
outcome."
'Not Surprised'
With regard to a recent ASSU
Senate resolution condemning
upcoming Campus Judicial Panel
proceedings Lyman commented, "I'm
not surprised that the Student Senate
opposes the CJP proceedings. They
opposed its creation. Fortunately, the
student body opposed them in those
efforts."
Lyman explained that the
administration selects whom it
prosecutes by determining, "whether
we have a viable case against them; in
other words, whether or not we can
show with clarity that an offense
occurred and establish the identity of
the offenders."
