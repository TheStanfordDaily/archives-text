## Maples Madness 
### Doug Wilson 
I was a big basketball fan in high school; we would go early to the
game, the band would play, the cheerleaders would cheer, the fans
would yell, the team would win, and we would go home.
Basically, the same things happen here. It's just a little weirder.
Like the game on Saturday night against Air Force. We went early, so
as to be able to get the best seats in the center section, where the
referee is sure to hear you when you boo. At 6:30 on the night of a
basketball game, Maples Pavilion is empty, except for the center
section, where we and 400 other people sit. Either you can't see the
game from any of the bleachers in the other three-fourths of the
Pavilion, or a lot of people think they're getting gypped if the refs
can't hear them clearly.
I suppose, though, if you get good seats, you can't be too picky
about the fans you end up sitting with. In front of us was a thin,
balding gentleman who smelled of smoked salmon, and his
companion, a thin, hairy gentleman whose teeth shone in the dark.
They assured us that the visiting freshman team currently getting
massacred on the court was from San Luis Obispo, since Stanford
freshman teams can't afford to play anybody outside of the Northern
California area, and the bespectacled salmon asked us why we weren't
working for William Proxmire. I said I didn't know, and he said we
really should because he is the best man for the job. "Isn't that
RIGHT, Steven?" he asked his companion, who merely smiled,
narrowed his eyes, and elbowed the salmon in the ribs.
Air Force came out on the court with a couple of generals, the Red
Vest Band came out from the side entrance with the dollies, and Band
Manager Dean Smith came out with an Air Force blazer. The generals
must not have been too impressed with Smith in his uniform,
conducting an offbeat version of the Army and Navy-fight songs and
the blazer came off. I guess it didn't really matter-the Air Force lost,
and the band played on.
Howie Dallmar is supposed to be the coach, but Saturday night he
had to take a back seat to the loudmouth who sat behind us,
complaining vociferously that Mike Mann was not being given the ball
enough, feeling vindicated only when Mann made a basket. He kept it
up for most of the evening, quieting down only when it was pointed
out to him that it was not possible to "GIVE THE DAMN BALL TO
MANN!" because Mann wasn't on the court any more.
Nobody, anywhere, likes referees. I have a friend overseas who
used to go to basketball games just to yell at his favorite referee, Ernie
Killabirdie. He would have enjoyed Saturday night; Ernie wasn't
there, but everybody was happy just the same, except, the referees,
who must spend more time than we think listening to the crowd,
because they kept missing the Air Force players who were falling left
and right over members of the Stanford team. In high school, that was
a "foul."
The team won, and we went home, but between the salmon and
the loudmouth and the refs and the military, it just wasn't at all what
I expected. I drove home with my friend from Nebraska, where
they've got cornhuskers, and with my friend from Ireland, where
they've got riots. Here, they've got Loomis.
