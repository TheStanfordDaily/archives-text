NCAA Ban Unconstitutional
SAN FRANCISCO — A federal judge ruled as
unconstitutional yesterday the National Collegiate
Athletic Association's ruling against the University of
California that placed it on probation for alleged violation
of the controversial 1.6 grade point rule.
U.S. Dist. Court Judge Albert C. Wollenberg made his
ruling on a suit filed recently by athletes Isaac Curtis and
Larry Brumsey against the NCAA.
Cal was placed on indefinite probation by the NCAA
last August. The university failed to give several athletes,
including Curtis and Brumsey, a required entrance
examination to predict a 1.6 grade point average and then
allowed them to continue competition against the wishes
of the NCAA, which considered the athletes ineligible.
Curtis and Brumsey announced last week they will
transfer to San Diego State, where they will be eligible to
play football next fall.
Wollenberg's ruling is not expected to change their
decisions. The athletes have already left Cal.
Wollenberg issued a preliminary injunction against the
NCAA which injoins and restrains the organization from
imposing sanctions — or continuing the recent probation
order — against California in the case.
The injunction's effect is not final. The issue is subject
to trial if the NCAA chooses to press the case further.
Ireland Investigation Begins
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Prime Minister Edward
Heath named Britain's top judge as a one-man tribunal
yesterday to investigate the bloody Sunday clashes
between British paratroopers and Roman Catholic
marchers in Northern Ireland.
Lord Widgery, 60-year-old lord chief justice with a
strong devotion to law and order, will get down to work
at once, Heath told a packed House of Commons in
London at the start of an emergency debate on the
explosive Irish crisis.
In the streets of Ireland, the Catholics continued their
campaign to avenge the deaths of 13 persons during
Sunday's riot by exploding bombs, setting fires and
staging strikes and other demonstrations.
Berrigan Jury Bogs Down
HARRISBURG, Pa. — The task of selecting a jury to hear
the conspiracy trial of antiwar priest Philip Berrigan and
six codefendants bogged down again yesterday.
Seven more prospective jurors, three women and four
men, were dismissed after preliminary questioning by a
federal judge who hopes to impanel a jury by the end of
the week.
One of the men was dismissed after he told the court
"I am progovernment and I couldn't decide this case on
the evidence alone."
Another man, a bachelor employed as a trainman by
the Bethelem Steel Corp., was asked if the religious
affiliations of the defendants would prejudice his verdict.
"I am a Catholic and I'm inclined to be more critical,"
the man replied. "They're not doing their business. They
should have to do their thing, church work."
The 47-year-old Berrigan, a Catholic priest now serving
a six-year sentence for destroying draft board files, is
accused of plotting to kidnap presidential adviser Henry
Kissinger.

The other defendants are two Catholic priests, a nun, a
former priest and his wife and a Pakistani graduate
student.
Black Caucus Demands TV Time
WASHINGTON — The Black Caucus asked the Federal
Communications Commission yesterday to order the
networks to give members of Congress regular access to
the nation's television audience without network
interference.
The 13 black House members asked for "an
appropriate number of prime-time hours each year,
generally comparable in amount to the time given
members of the executive branch."
They also asked the FCC to order ABC, NBC and CBS
to make available to the caucus a half hour or full hour of
network time, free "to present a message of their own
choosing, on racial or other issues."
The demands were made in a complaint to the
commission that the networks all turned down the Black
Caucus' request for prime air time as a follow-up to
President Nixon's State of the Union message.
All three networks declined, the Black Caucus said,
citing their policy of barring any documentary or program
on controversial issues not first subjected to complete
network editorial supervision. *
Debate End Prevented
WASHINGTON — The Senate defeated a first move
yesterday to cut off debate on an
equal-employment-opportunity bill but another attempt
will be made later in the week.
The vote on a petition to put the Senate's
anti-filibuster rule into effect was 48-37, nine short of the
required two-thirds majority.
Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, D-Mont., said after
the vote that, beginning Wednesday, the Senate will go on
"a two-track system" because it is falling so far behind on
its legislative schedule.
Under this arrangement debate on a civil-rights
measure will continue in the first part of each day and
other legislation, starting with a foreign-aid appropriation
bill, will be taken up around mid-afternoon.
Mansfield said another attempt probably will be made
in the next day or two to try to close out the debate on
the bill to reinforce a federal ban on racial and other
discrimination in employment.

They also asked the FCC to order ABC, NBC and CBS
to make available to the caucus a half hour or full hour of
network time, free "to present a message of their own
choosing, on racial or other issues."
The demands were made in a complaint to the
commission that the networks all turned down the Black
Caucus' request for prime air time as a follow-up to
President Nixon's State of the Union message.
All three networks declined, the Black Caucus said,
citing their policy of barring any documentary or program
on controversial issues not first subjected to complete
network editorial supervision. *
Debate End Prevented
WASHINGTON — The Senate defeated a first move
yesterday to cut off debate on an
equal-employment-opportunity bill but another attempt
will be made later in the week.
The vote on a petition to put the Senate's
anti-filibuster rule into effect was 48-37, nine short of the
required two-thirds majority.
Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, D-Mont., said after
the vote that, beginning Wednesday, the Senate will go on
"a two-track system" because it is falling so far behind on
its legislative schedule.
Under this arrangement debate on a civil-rights
measure will continue in the first part of each day and
other legislation, starting with a foreign-aid appropriation
bill, will be taken up around mid-afternoon.
Mansfield said another attempt probably will be made
in the next day or two to try to close out the debate on
the bill to reinforce a federal ban on racial and other
discrimination in employment.
NCAA Ban Unconstitutional
SAN FRANCISCO — A federal judge ruled as
unconstitutional yesterday the National Collegiate
Athletic Association's ruling against the University of
California that placed it on probation for alleged violation
of the controversial 1.6 grade point rule.
U.S. Dist. Court Judge Albert C. Wollenberg made his
ruling on a suit filed recently by athletes Isaac Curtis and
Larry Brumsey against the NCAA.
Cal was placed on indefinite probation by the NCAA
last August. The university failed to give several athletes,
including Curtis and Brumsey, a required entrance
examination to predict a 1.6 grade point average and then
allowed them to continue competition against the wishes
of the NCAA, which considered the athletes ineligible.
Curtis and Brumsey announced last week they will
transfer to San Diego State, where they will be eligible to
play football next fall.
Wollenberg's ruling is not expected to change their
decisions. The athletes have already left Cal.
Wollenberg issued a preliminary injunction against the
NCAA which injoins and restrains the organization from
imposing sanctions — or continuing the recent probation
order — against California in the case.
The injunction's effect is not final. The issue is subject
to trial if the NCAA chooses to press the case further.
Ireland Investigation Begins
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Prime Minister Edward
Heath named Britain's top judge as a one-man tribunal
yesterday to investigate the bloody Sunday clashes
between British paratroopers and Roman Catholic
marchers in Northern Ireland.
Lord Widgery, 60-year-old lord chief justice with a
strong devotion to law and order, will get down to work
at once, Heath told a packed House of Commons in
London at the start of an emergency debate on the
explosive Irish crisis.
In the streets of Ireland, the Catholics continued their
campaign to avenge the deaths of 13 persons during
Sunday's riot by exploding bombs, setting fires and
staging strikes and other demonstrations.
Berrigan Jury Bogs Down
HARRISBURG, Pa. — The task of selecting a jury to hear
the conspiracy trial of antiwar priest Philip Berrigan and
six codefendants bogged down again yesterday.
Seven more prospective jurors, three women and four
men, were dismissed after preliminary questioning by a
federal judge who hopes to impanel a jury by the end of
the week.
One of the men was dismissed after he told the court
"I am progovernment and I couldn't decide this case on
the evidence alone."
Another man, a bachelor employed as a trainman by
the Bethelem Steel Corp., was asked if the religious
affiliations of the defendants would prejudice his verdict.
"I am a Catholic and I'm inclined to be more critical,"
the man replied. "They're not doing their business. They
should have to do their thing, church work."
The 47-year-old Berrigan, a Catholic priest now serving
a six-year sentence for destroying draft board files, is
accused of plotting to kidnap presidential adviser Henry
Kissinger.

The other defendants are two Catholic priests, a nun, a
former priest and his wife and a Pakistani graduate
student.
Black Caucus Demands TV Time

Communications Commission yesterday to order the
