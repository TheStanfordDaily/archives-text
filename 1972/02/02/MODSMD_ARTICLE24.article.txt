# Friedenthal, Franklin Debate
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Law Professor Jack Friedenthal and
fired professor H. Bruce Franklin
stridently debate the Franklin case in
an hour-long television interview, to be
shown tonight at 9:30 p.m. on
Channel 11.
Their spirited arguments about
Franklin's dismissal were taped last
week for KNTV's weekly "Issues on
Trial" program.
Friedenthal insisted a faculty board
consisting of "probably the most
independent individuals on campus"
had clearly determined Franklin's guilt
on incitement charges. The law
professor repeatedly charged that
radicals shut down buildings and break
windows "just to have a little fun."
As the two repeatedly tangled
about the facts of the case, Franklin

said, "Nobody who has my political
philosophy will be able to express
those ideas at Stanford or any other
American college campus."
Franklin also charged, "There's no
difference between Jack Friedenthal
and the administration. Tweedledee
and Tweedledum."
Franklin said the incitement
charges were based on the false
assumption that his "words have magic
power to drive people crazy."
Friedenthal retorted that people in
mobs can be incited. He argued, "It's a
mob psychology that has existed from
time to time at Stanford."
Radicals used the US invasion of
Laos and the Gamut-H project at the
Computation Center as excuses "to
have a big rally, to shut something
down, to have a little fun on campus,"

Friedenthal added.
Franklin said administrators refused
to announce cancellation of Gamut-H
and called in police because "what
they wanted was a confrontation."
Defending the use of police to end
the Comp Center occupation,
Friedenthal said, "We ah know what a
computer center is. It's the heart of a
university."
As Franklin insisted that "poor and
working class people ought to run the
University," Friedenthal objected that
many so-called "workers" involved in
protests "have nothing to do with
Stanford."
He told Franklin, "You have
recruited people at the Foothill
College campus. . . trying to drum up
a little support that you couldn't get
at Stanford."
Franklin charged the recent NLRB
decision "excludes from unionization
the people who have been most active
in organizing at Stanford, the women
clerical workers."
Franklin also charged that
Friedenthal ignores the "violence he
commits in his classroom," and he
criticized Friedenthal's chairmanship
of the Stanford Judicial Council in
1969.
Friedenthal replied that most of his
courses concern "legal problems of the
poor." Referring to the SJC hearings
of protesters who disrupted a Trustees'
meeting in 1969, Friedenthal said the
activists tried to "have a little fun" by
"pushing around ... a few elderly men
who can't fight back."

Friedenthal retorted that people in
mobs can be incited. He argued, "It's a
mob psychology that has existed from
time to time at Stanford."
Radicals used the US invasion of
Laos and the Gamut-H project at the
Computation Center as excuses "to
have a big rally, to shut something
down, to have a little fun on campus,"

Friedenthal added.
Franklin said administrators refused
to announce cancellation of Gamut-H
and called in police because "what
they wanted was a confrontation."
Defending the use of police to end
the Comp Center occupation,
Friedenthal said, "We ah know what a
computer center is. It's the heart of a
university."
As Franklin insisted that "poor and
working class people ought to run the
University," Friedenthal objected that
many so-called "workers" involved in
protests "have nothing to do with
Stanford."
He told Franklin, "You have
recruited people at the Foothill
College campus. . . trying to drum up
a little support that you couldn't get
at Stanford."
Franklin charged the recent NLRB
decision "excludes from unionization
the people who have been most active
in organizing at Stanford, the women
clerical workers."
Franklin also charged that
Friedenthal ignores the "violence he
commits in his classroom," and he
criticized Friedenthal's chairmanship
of the Stanford Judicial Council in
1969.
Friedenthal replied that most of his
courses concern "legal problems of the
poor." Referring to the SJC hearings
of protesters who disrupted a Trustees'
meeting in 1969, Friedenthal said the
activists tried to "have a little fun" by
"pushing around ... a few elderly men
who can't fight back."
Law Professor Jack Friedenthal and
fired professor H. Bruce Franklin
stridently debate the Franklin case in
an hour-long television interview, to be
shown tonight at 9:30 p.m. on
Channel 11.
Their spirited arguments about
Franklin's dismissal were taped last
week for KNTV's weekly "Issues on
Trial" program.
Friedenthal insisted a faculty board
consisting of "probably the most
independent individuals on campus"
had clearly determined Franklin's guilt
on incitement charges. The law
professor repeatedly charged that
radicals shut down buildings and break
windows "just to have a little fun."
As the two repeatedly tangled
about the facts of the case, Franklin

said, "Nobody who has my political
philosophy will be able to express
those ideas at Stanford or any other
American college campus."
Franklin also charged, "There's no
difference between Jack Friedenthal
and the administration. Tweedledee
and Tweedledum."
Franklin said the incitement
charges were based on the false
assumption that his "words have magic
power to drive people crazy."
Friedenthal retorted that people in
mobs can be incited. He argued, "It's a
mob psychology that has existed from
time to time at Stanford."

Laos and the Gamut-H project at the
