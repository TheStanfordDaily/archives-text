# Physicists Condemn Shockley's Theories
## 
### 
The controversial theories on race
and intelligence of Stanford Professor
William Shockley were condemned by
scientists attending a business meeting
of the American Physical Society
(APS) in San Francisco Monday night.
A resolution was passed calling for
the APS to publicly disavow "any
professional support for William
Shockley in the promulgation of his
racist theories."
The resolution, which refers to
Shockley's contention that the genetic
potential for intelligence in blacks may
be less than in whites, was voted on by
about 100 of the 1000 physicists
attending the week-long joint meeting
of the APS and American Association
of Physics Teachers.
There appeared to be no precedent
for the motion of censure, especially
against an APS member of the stature
of Shockley, who won a Nobel Prize in
1956 for the invention of the
transistor.
To become the official position of
the society, which claims most of the
nation's physicists as members, a
governing board of about twenty
members must approve the resolution.
Reached for comment, Shockley
described those who passed the
resolution as a "local concentrated
pressure group," within the APS and
added that he felt confident the APS
council would not approve the
position.
"I have enough faith in the elective

process and general good judgement of
the population to feel it is most
unlikely that such a position so far
removed from the purposes of the APS
will be approved by that body."
The physicist who introduced the
vote, Steve Newman of Compton,
Calif, commented that the resolution
probably represented the feeling of the
majority of the APS membership.
