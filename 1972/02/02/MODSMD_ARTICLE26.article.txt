# Dudley Swim Dies, Former Alumni Head
## 
### 
Dudley Swim, . chairman of the
board of National Airlines and former
Stanford Alumni Association
president, died Monday. He was 66.
Swim served on the founding
committee of the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI), and on both the Board
of Overseers and the Advisory Board
of the Hoover Institution.
Swim was a member of the
California Coordinating Council for
Higher Education, and a trustee of the
California State College System. He
was a conservative Republican who
decried the "fuzziness" of the
difference between "true freedom and
license."
In September 1970 Swim said "I
am basically concerned with the
hijacking of our campuses and

converting them to the ends of
political activists." One month later he
unsuccessfully sought grand jury
investigations of the California's state
colleges.
Swim said there was a need for
those investigations because of "punks
and jackals in the student body,
negligence, impropriety and
conspiracy to defraud."
A former National Vice
Commander of the American Legion,
Swim felt "the mission of higher
education is not to corrupt or pervert,
but rather to strengthen and develop
the young mind."
Swim received a B.A. in political
science from Stanford in 1926, and an
M.B.A. here in 1928. He served as
Alumni Association president in 1951
and 1952.
