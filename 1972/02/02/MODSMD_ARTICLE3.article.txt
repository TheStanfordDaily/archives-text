# ASSU Senate Panel Backs Student Police
## 
### TINA COOPER 
The Student Senate, acting as an ad
hoc committee for lack of a quorum,
moved last night to form a student
police force to obstruct upcoming
Campus Judicial Panel hearings. Its
tactics will be "dialogue and physical
blockage," and will not resist county
police.
The hearings will begin Friday to
try students implicated in the
Placement Center disruption of
January 26.
Senators Betsy Elich and Jennifer
Springer, the sponsors of the
resolution, urged the Senate to act to
support the student referendum
against defense recruiting at the
Placement Center. They specified that
this force would be temporary,
recruited from volunteers, and
concerned only with the CJP.
"It's basically a symbolic move,"
said Elich. "We're trying to give some
authority to students to uphold their
own referendum."
The Stanford constitution provides
for the formation of a student police
force; however, this force has never
before been used to enforce a student
referendum. This point was made by

several senators. When asked What he
thought of this new student force,
senator Chris Hocker termed it the
"Student Senate Rehab Squad."
The resolution passed 10-4, with
four abstentions. Elich and Springer
called for volunteers for the police
force to come to the Senate's regular
meeting on Thursday night. They
anticipate a final group of about fifty
people.
The ad hoc committee's action is
subject to the approval of the full
Senate at the Thursday meeting.
