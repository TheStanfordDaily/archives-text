# Sampson, Siemon In Ist Round
## Pros Draft Stanford Gridders 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Serving notice that it has become a
major source of pro football talent,
Stanford yesterday was the only team
to have two players chosen in the first
ten picks of the National Football
League's annual college draft.
Greg Sampson, the Indians' 6'5",
255 pound defensive end, was drafted
sixth in the first round by Houston,
and Ail-American linebacker Jeff
Siemon was the tenth player in the
country to be chosen by the pros.
Siemon will play for the Minnesota
Vikings, the NFC Central Division
Champions, next year.
The San Diego Chargers used their
first pick of the draft to nab Thunder
Chicken Pete Lazetich in the second
round, making him the 37th player
drafted. No other Card was picked by
the pros in yesterday's seven rounds of
drafting in which 182 college seniors

were named.
Sampson A Surprise
Sampson's prominence in the draft
was unexpected since he was the least
renowned of the Thunder Chickens.
Lazetich and Larry Butler had 99 and
98 tackles during the regular season
compared to Sampson's 35. A
spectacular performance in the Rose
Bowl, however, elevated scouts'
estimation of Sampson. A national
television audience was treated to one
of the year's most spectacular
defensive plays when Sampson
dropped Michigan's Glenn Doughty
from behind with a vicious one-armed
flying tackle in the first quarter.
Houston coach Bill Peterson
explained his reasons for drafting
Sampson. "He's just a growing boy
with his career in front of him. We
think that Greg will be a 260 pounder
when he finishes growing." Only 20
years old, Sampson has the greatest
physical potential of the Thunder
Chickens and could start for the Oilers
next year.
Oft touted by his coach John
Ralston as the "premier linebacker in
the country," Siemon was the first
linebacker to be drafted and is moving
into an excellent position at
Minnesota. Viking middle linebacker
Lonnie Warwick has been plagued by
injuries for two years and played only
three games last season. His
replacement, Carl Gersbach, had
previously been cut by the
Philadelphia Eagles.
The injury riddled Warwick might
retire soon, and Minnesota coach Bud
Grant is very pleased at filling one of
the only holes in the Viking's fearsome
defense. Grant praised Siemon's
".. . outstanding mobility. He was
obviously the best player available
when our turn came. There are some
players who are question marks. There
are none about Jeff Siemon."
The winner of the Pop Warner

Award as the West's best college
football player, Siemon, a solid pro
prospect, is fortunate to be drafted by
one of the strongest teams in the NFL.
Laz To San Diego
San Diego traded its first round
draft choice to New York, and
Lazetich was the first player picked by
the Chargers. Lazetich was second
only to Siemon's 112 tackles for the
Indians. Virtually assured of making it
in the professional ranks, Lazetich
could find himself playing alongside
the immortal Deacon Jones, recently
acquired by the Chargers.
Last year's college draft was
dominated by the quarterbacks who

occupied four out of the first seven
picks. (Jim Plunkett, Dan Pastorini,
Archie Manning, and Leo Hart.)
Linemen were the most sought after
commodity this season, however,
filling four of the first six draft
positions.
The last ten rounds of the draft will
begin today at noon in New York. A
number of Stanford players will
probably be chosen in today's session.
Don Bunce, Larry Butler, and Bill
Meyers should be drafted early, and
Tim Schallich, Jackie Brown, and
Benny Barnes could also be singled out
by the pros in the final stages of the
draft.

NUMBER SlX—Greg Sampson (91), shown here successfully covering the option
play against USC, was chosen sixth yesterday in the first round of pro football's
college draft. Coach Bill Peterson, whose Houston Oilers picked Sampson,
expects the graduating Thunder Chicken to start as a rookie in Houston's
defensive line.
Serving notice that it has become a
major source of pro football talent,
Stanford yesterday was the only team
to have two players chosen in the first
ten picks of the National Football
League's annual college draft.
Greg Sampson, the Indians' 6'5",
255 pound defensive end, was drafted
sixth in the first round by Houston,
and Ail-American linebacker Jeff
Siemon was the tenth player in the
country to be chosen by the pros.
Siemon will play for the Minnesota
Vikings, the NFC Central Division
Champions, next year.
The San Diego Chargers used their
first pick of the draft to nab Thunder
Chicken Pete Lazetich in the second
round, making him the 37th player
drafted. No other Card was picked by
the pros in yesterday's seven rounds of
drafting in which 182 college seniors

were named.
Sampson A Surprise
Sampson's prominence in the draft
was unexpected since he was the least
renowned of the Thunder Chickens.
Lazetich and Larry Butler had 99 and
98 tackles during the regular season
compared to Sampson's 35. A
spectacular performance in the Rose
Bowl, however, elevated scouts'
estimation of Sampson. A national
television audience was treated to one
of the year's most spectacular
defensive plays when Sampson
dropped Michigan's Glenn Doughty
from behind with a vicious one-armed
flying tackle in the first quarter.
Houston coach Bill Peterson
explained his reasons for drafting
Sampson. "He's just a growing boy
with his career in front of him. We
think that Greg will be a 260 pounder
when he finishes growing." Only 20
years old, Sampson has the greatest
physical potential of the Thunder
Chickens and could start for the Oilers
next year.
Oft touted by his coach John
Ralston as the "premier linebacker in
the country," Siemon was the first
linebacker to be drafted and is moving
into an excellent position at
Minnesota. Viking middle linebacker
Lonnie Warwick has been plagued by
injuries for two years and played only
three games last season. His
replacement, Carl Gersbach, had
previously been cut by the
Philadelphia Eagles.
The injury riddled Warwick might
retire soon, and Minnesota coach Bud
Grant is very pleased at filling one of
the only holes in the Viking's fearsome
defense. Grant praised Siemon's
".. . outstanding mobility. He was
obviously the best player available
when our turn came. There are some
players who are question marks. There
are none about Jeff Siemon."
The winner of the Pop Warner

Award as the West's best college
football player, Siemon, a solid pro
prospect, is fortunate to be drafted by
one of the strongest teams in the NFL.
Laz To San Diego
San Diego traded its first round
draft choice to New York, and
Lazetich was the first player picked by
the Chargers. Lazetich was second
only to Siemon's 112 tackles for the
Indians. Virtually assured of making it
in the professional ranks, Lazetich
could find himself playing alongside
the immortal Deacon Jones, recently
acquired by the Chargers.
Last year's college draft was
dominated by the quarterbacks who

occupied four out of the first seven
picks. (Jim Plunkett, Dan Pastorini,
Archie Manning, and Leo Hart.)
Linemen were the most sought after
commodity this season, however,
filling four of the first six draft
positions.
The last ten rounds of the draft will
begin today at noon in New York. A
number of Stanford players will
probably be chosen in today's session.

Meyers should be drafted early, and
