# Stanford Employees To Vote From Choice Of Five Unions
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
There will definitely be five choices for Stanford
workers when they vote to pick a union for collective
bargaining purposes.
Yesterday was the deadline for five unions named by
the National Labor Relations Board to pull their names
off the ballot, but Burt Wells of the San Francisco office
of the NLRB said no one had contacted him.
Both Stanford police and firemen will hold separate
elections involving only one union each. But a large third
group of maintenance workers, lab support personnel,
food service workers, audio-visual operators, some
members of the University Press, custodial workers and
physical plant employees, will have to choose one of five
unions.
The USE kicked off their drive for the nomination
with a meeting at the Medical Center yesterday to discuss
what sort of medical care should be involved in a contract
proposal. About 35 workers — most of them from the
Med Center and Hospital — discussed the problem for an
hour, and then formed a committee to meet with the
Medical Committee for Human Rights to try and work
out a solution.
"I was pretty happy with the turnout," said Mike
Haynes, USE secretary who conducted the meeting. "It
was about what I expected."
He said that most of the remaining USE campaign
would involve smaller meetings of workers. "Small groups
are better," Haynes explained. "People can't participate in

large groups."
USE Criticized
Meanwhile, a California School Employees
Association-Stanford Employees Association (CSEA-SEA)
officer had some harsh words for USE.
"Sure we'll be in this thing,'" said Junior Past President
Mike Fineo. "We'll win. Their [USE] concept of a union
is a political thing. We work without confrontations,
without strikes. We've never had a strike in the whole
history of the organization. Liberal, communist,
Democrat, Republican, I don't care. My concern is the
bread and butter situation."
He said USE was a splinter group originally belonging
to CSEA-SEA. "We suspended them, we never expelled
them," Fineo said. "Then they just formed a group on
their own."
At least one organization won't be taking part.
Bob Griffin, a former member of Workers Action
Caucus, says the WAC is dead. "I don't think that there
will be any action around the organization," Griffin, now
a member of United Stanford Employees, said. He
claimed the group fell apart when leaders Devera Satisky,
John Keilch and Joe Hardegree were fired.
Wells said he hadn't yet set a date for the elections,
which will involve some 1200 Stanford workers, but he
estimates it will be within a month. "We'll have a meeting
of all the parties involved to talk about the problems
first," he said. "We hope to have it this week or the next
week."
