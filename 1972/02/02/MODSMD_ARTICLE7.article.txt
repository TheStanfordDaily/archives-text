## Education In A Consumer Society 
### 
Reading about Termpapers
Unlimited in the press recently
rang up a chuckle in my heart,
along with a few reflections on
the state of education in a
consumer society. These
reflections are here presented to
you by one who has spent more
than a decade in three major
universities, and therefore
considers himself to have at least
some of the "inside dope" on the
scene.
Termpapers Unlimited is an
East-coast firm founded by a
business-minded young man who
is now, at age 23, a self-made
millionaire. Here is why.
For the modest price of around
$2.50 a page, this firm will
provide any student, anywhere in

the U.S., with a ready-made
termpaper on any topic. He is
advised to retype it, and is
virtually assured of receiving at
least a high B grade.
Lacking a ready-made paper,
the firm will write one, for about
$1.35 more per page. The files are
stocked by students contributing
their old papers, along with a fleet
of several hundred free-lance
professors around the country
capable of dashing off a
termpaper in an evening, complete
with notes and quotes.
Consider
Those educators who want to
scream bloody murder about
pre-written termpapers ought to
consider the education they are
offering, and why Termpapers

Unlimited works. For this firm is
quite consistent with the
educational assumptions of our
society.
The major assumption of our
educational system is that
experience is unimportant and
symbolic manipulation supreme.
This is clear in our
elementary-school focus on
symbolic manipulation (reading,
writing, arithmetic), along with a
paucity of funding for almost any
project or field trip outside the
four pastel walls of the classroom.
Now universities do provide
experience. Though it is generally
concealed from parents, one of
the major functions of the
American college systems is to
provide an open atmosphere for
premarital sexual experimentation
and development.
Accidental
Mixed dorms and the health
service cooperate on this, and it is
a tremendously important
function—considering the state of
sex education in the schools! But
this is really quite accidental.
The real function of
universities is to dish out
"learning" in the form of
"courses" so the student can
assume a "position" in a
techno-logical, consuming society.
Any quick examination of a
university catalogue will show
that combined or interdisciplinary
majors are in sad shape. On the
other hand, many quite irrelevant
"departmental" offerings abound.
Weirdos
Why? Because society has a
place for a specialist in Medieval
History, whereas businesses will
not hire graduates in such weirdo
things as ecology--which still
ranks as some sort of witchcraft.
And, if graduates can't find jobs
the placement ratio goes down,

and so does financial support
from the alumnae.
Under this system students
learn not according to their
interest or development pattern,
but according to the guidelines of
a curriculum. Learning is
packaged in consummable chunks.
In some departments
professors write their own texts
and earn heavy royalties. If
students scream, the answer is to
import a few token "relevant"
courses-which means
consummable prepackaged
knowledge on Black Literature,
Women's Lib, Pollution, or
Technology and Alienation. Like
any other new product, these
courses glitter in the catalogue but
look as shabby as last years model
by the end of the quarter.
Consumer Economy
Consummable knowledge is
education for a consumer
economy. Thus, people are
employable according to the
number of years they have paid
fees and had pre-digested
knowledge thrust down their
throats. Knowledge consists of
courses, books, and bibliographies
presented to students by
professors who are also addicted
to packaged learning.
The university itself is rated by
the number of books and journals
in its "holdings." Professors are
rated by the number of packages
they produce—that is, the number
of publication entries in their own
bibliographies. In this system, one
very excellent book counts as one
(1) item, whereas three book
reviews of three very bad books
counts as three (3) items.
All of this is stored in obscure
journals, many of which are never
checked out. Few professors in a
department read a colleagues
work. Few students want to. Most

Barry wood

professors would indeed like to
forget most of what they have
written, since it is pedantic, dull,
unread, and by implication
irrelevant. Moreover, since the
latest "methodological
breakthrough," most of it is out
of date.
And so it goes. Well, what
about Termpapers Unlimited?
Aren't students gyp'ng
themselves? No.
Students today are largely
educated outside school anyway.
They talk with one another. They
read books by writers who never
earned a university degree—which
includes all of English and most of
American literature, and all the
Great Books since Plato.
They live in an
information-rich culture where
the lyrics of Bob Dylan or George
Harrison teach them what most
sociology departments have not
even grasped about our own
times.
Nonsensical
They know that schooling is
nonsensical, addicted to symbols
rather than reality, concerned
with material "evidence" like
termpapers rather than the
intangible evidence that any
half-wit professor can glean in an
hour discussion with a student.
No, students are not cheating
themselves by turning in
prewritten termpapers. They are
merely conforming to a
commodity view of education.
This is not to condone the
practice, but merely to point out
that professors and universities are
only getting back from students
what they have trained them to
do. Precisely nothing.
If one doubts this, ask a
student.

"departmental" offerings abound.
Weirdos
Why? Because society has a
place for a specialist in Medieval
History, whereas businesses will
not hire graduates in such weirdo
things as ecology--which still
ranks as some sort of witchcraft.
And, if graduates can't find jobs
the placement ratio goes down,

Under this system students
learn not according to their
interest or development pattern,
but according to the guidelines of
a curriculum. Learning is
packaged in consummable chunks.
In some departments
professors write their own texts
and earn heavy royalties. If
students scream, the answer is to
import a few token "relevant"
courses-which means
consummable prepackaged
knowledge on Black Literature,
Women's Lib, Pollution, or
Technology and Alienation. Like
any other new product, these
courses glitter in the catalogue but
look as shabby as last years model

Consumer Economy
Consummable knowledge is
education for a consumer
economy. Thus, people are
employable according to the
number of years they have paid
fees and had pre-digested
knowledge thrust down their
throats. Knowledge consists of
courses, books, and bibliographies
presented to students by
professors who are also addicted
to packaged learning.
The university itself is rated by
the number of books and journals
in its "holdings." Professors are
rated by the number of packages
they produce—that is, the number
of publication entries in their own
bibliographies. In this system, one
very excellent book counts as one
(1) item, whereas three book
reviews of three very bad books
counts as three (3) items.
All of this is stored in obscure
journals, many of which are never
checked out. Few professors in a
department read a colleagues
work. Few students want to. Most

Barry wood

professors would indeed like to
forget most of what they have
written, since it is pedantic, dull,
unread, and by implication
irrelevant. Moreover, since the
latest "methodological
breakthrough," most of it is out
of date.
And so it goes. Well, what
about Termpapers Unlimited?
Aren't students gyp'ng
themselves? No.
Students today are largely
educated outside school anyway.
They talk with one another. They
read books by writers who never
earned a university degree—which
includes all of English and most of
American literature, and all the
Great Books since Plato.
They live in an
information-rich culture where
the lyrics of Bob Dylan or George
Harrison teach them what most
sociology departments have not
even grasped about our own
times.
Nonsensical
They know that schooling is
nonsensical, addicted to symbols
rather than reality, concerned
with material "evidence" like
termpapers rather than the
intangible evidence that any
half-wit professor can glean in an
hour discussion with a student.
No, students are not cheating
themselves by turning in
prewritten termpapers. They are
merely conforming to a
commodity view of education.
This is not to condone the
practice, but merely to point out
that professors and universities are
only getting back from students
what they have trained them to
do. Precisely nothing.
If one doubts this, ask a

Reading about Termpapers
Unlimited in the press recently
rang up a chuckle in my heart,
along with a few reflections on
the state of education in a
consumer society. These
reflections are here presented to
you by one who has spent more
than a decade in three major
universities, and therefore
considers himself to have at least
some of the "inside dope" on the
scene.
Termpapers Unlimited is an
East-coast firm founded by a
business-minded young man who
is now, at age 23, a self-made
millionaire. Here is why.
For the modest price of around
$2.50 a page, this firm will
provide any student, anywhere in

the U.S., with a ready-made
termpaper on any topic. He is
advised to retype it, and is
virtually assured of receiving at
least a high B grade.
Lacking a ready-made paper,
the firm will write one, for about
$1.35 more per page. The files are
stocked by students contributing
their old papers, along with a fleet
of several hundred free-lance
professors around the country
capable of dashing off a
termpaper in an evening, complete
with notes and quotes.
Consider
Those educators who want to
scream bloody murder about
pre-written termpapers ought to
consider the education they are
offering, and why Termpapers

Unlimited works. For this firm is
quite consistent with the
educational assumptions of our
society.
The major assumption of our
educational system is that
experience is unimportant and
symbolic manipulation supreme.
This is clear in our
elementary-school focus on
symbolic manipulation (reading,
writing, arithmetic), along with a
paucity of funding for almost any
project or field trip outside the
four pastel walls of the classroom.
Now universities do provide
experience. Though it is generally
concealed from parents, one of
the major functions of the
American college systems is to
provide an open atmosphere for
premarital sexual experimentation
and development.
Accidental
Mixed dorms and the health
service cooperate on this, and it is
a tremendously important
function—considering the state of
sex education in the schools! But
this is really quite accidental.
The real function of
universities is to dish out
"learning" in the form of
"courses" so the student can
assume a "position" in a
techno-logical, consuming society.
Any quick examination of a
university catalogue will show
that combined or interdisciplinary
majors are in sad shape. On the
other hand, many quite irrelevant
"departmental" offerings abound.

No, students are not cheating

Reading about Termpapers
Unlimited in the press recently
rang up a chuckle in my heart,
along with a few reflections on
the state of education in a
consumer society. These
reflections are here presented to
you by one who has spent more
than a decade in three major
universities, and therefore
considers himself to have at least
some of the "inside dope" on the
scene.
Termpapers Unlimited is an
East-coast firm founded by a
business-minded young man who
is now, at age 23, a self-made
millionaire. Here is why.
For the modest price of around
$2.50 a page, this firm will
provide any student, anywhere in

the U.S., with a ready-made
termpaper on any topic. He is
advised to retype it, and is
virtually assured of receiving at
least a high B grade.
Lacking a ready-made paper,
the firm will write one, for about
$1.35 more per page. The files are
stocked by students contributing
their old papers, along with a fleet
of several hundred free-lance
professors around the country
capable of dashing off a
termpaper in an evening, complete
with notes and quotes.
Consider
Those educators who want to
scream bloody murder about
pre-written termpapers ought to
consider the education they are
offering, and why Termpapers

Unlimited works. For this firm is
quite consistent with the
educational assumptions of our
society.
The major assumption of our
educational system is that
experience is unimportant and
symbolic manipulation supreme.
This is clear in our
elementary-school focus on
symbolic manipulation (reading,
writing, arithmetic), along with a
paucity of funding for almost any
project or field trip outside the
four pastel walls of the classroom.
Now universities do provide
experience. Though it is generally
concealed from parents, one of
the major functions of the
American college systems is to
provide an open atmosphere for
premarital sexual experimentation
and development.
Accidental
Mixed dorms and the health
service cooperate on this, and it is
a tremendously important
function—considering the state of
sex education in the schools! But
this is really quite accidental.
The real function of
universities is to dish out
"learning" in the form of
"courses" so the student can
assume a "position" in a
techno-logical, consuming society.
Any quick examination of a
university catalogue will show
that combined or interdisciplinary
majors are in sad shape. On the
other hand, many quite irrelevant
"departmental" offerings abound.
Weirdos
Why? Because society has a
place for a specialist in Medieval
History, whereas businesses will
not hire graduates in such weirdo
things as ecology--which still
ranks as some sort of witchcraft.
And, if graduates can't find jobs
the placement ratio goes down,

and so does financial support
from the alumnae.
Under this system students
learn not according to their
interest or development pattern,
but according to the guidelines of
a curriculum. Learning is
packaged in consummable chunks.
In some departments
professors write their own texts
and earn heavy royalties. If
students scream, the answer is to
import a few token "relevant"
courses-which means
consummable prepackaged
knowledge on Black Literature,
Women's Lib, Pollution, or
Technology and Alienation. Like
any other new product, these
courses glitter in the catalogue but
look as shabby as last years model
by the end of the quarter.
Consumer Economy
Consummable knowledge is
education for a consumer
economy. Thus, people are
employable according to the
number of years they have paid
fees and had pre-digested
knowledge thrust down their
throats. Knowledge consists of
courses, books, and bibliographies
presented to students by
professors who are also addicted
to packaged learning.
The university itself is rated by
the number of books and journals
in its "holdings." Professors are
rated by the number of packages
they produce—that is, the number
of publication entries in their own
bibliographies. In this system, one
very excellent book counts as one
(1) item, whereas three book
reviews of three very bad books
counts as three (3) items.
All of this is stored in obscure
journals, many of which are never
checked out. Few professors in a
department read a colleagues
work. Few students want to. Most

Barry wood

professors would indeed like to
forget most of what they have
written, since it is pedantic, dull,
unread, and by implication
irrelevant. Moreover, since the
latest "methodological
breakthrough," most of it is out
of date.
And so it goes. Well, what
about Termpapers Unlimited?
Aren't students gyp'ng
themselves? No.
Students today are largely
educated outside school anyway.
They talk with one another. They
read books by writers who never
earned a university degree—which
includes all of English and most of
American literature, and all the
Great Books since Plato.
They live in an
information-rich culture where
the lyrics of Bob Dylan or George
Harrison teach them what most
sociology departments have not
even grasped about our own
times.
