## Three Cases Of Racism 
### 
We feel that the campus and
public at large should be informed
of three racist events which have
affected Chicanos at Stanford.
The first event is Monday's stolen
bicycle incident.
At approximately 3:30 p.m.,
Delia Islas and Jesse Calvillo,
Chicano students at the MEChA
Casa, opened the front door to
Stanford policeman Blalock and
white student Andrew Baldwin.
Baldwin explained that he had
been told, by an unknown
informer, that his missing bicycle
could be found at the Casa. Islas
and Calvillo allowed them to look
in the back room where the bike
was found, along with several
others.
Santa Clara Sheriffs were then
called to the scene for a return
visit to MEChA (remember
Summer 1971?) and confiscated
the remaining bicycles which had
not been claimed. Included was
one bike which had been
registered at U.C. Berkeley.
We, the Mesa Directiva, elected
officers of MECHA at Stanford,
maintain that MECHA students
did not have any knowledge of
the bicycles in the Casa. We feel
this is a direct attack by
individuals who desire to discredit
MEChA.

At 9:00 a.m., Monday, 30 of
us met at the Casa before going to
the trial at Tresidder Union to
support the struggle of Rafas
Robles, the second issue. At that
time we were not aware that there
were bicycles at the house. One
person at Mecha did see the
bicycles but did not report it.
Rafas is the first student at
Stanford to be subjected to the
Schwartz - Kaplan — Lyman
do-it-yourself aborted judicial
system (formerly the SJC). He is
charged with two counts of
assault during Spring Quarter,
1971, and forgery of a hold card.
During the hearing some
interesting facts were revealed.
The "victim" of the second
alleged assault, actually an open
hand slap to the head, stated that
he was testifying against his own
will, and furthermore testified
that Rafas did not touch him. He
had previously notified MEChA
that he was coerced by the
Stanford Administration into
testifying under the threat of
suspension.
The final issue concerns recent
negotiations between MEChA and
the Stanford Administration,
mainly the Dean of Students
Office about the use of the
MEChA Casa. We are asking the

Administration that: 1) Stanford
re-locate MEChA Casa once the
present Casa is torn down; 2)
Stanford be responsible for losses
directly related to the occupation
of the Casa; 3) Stanford give prior
notice to MEChA if University
officials or police desire to enter
the Casa at anytime; 4) Stanford
pay for all improvements to the
Casa; and 5) Stanford meet and
comply with all Health and Safety
regulations in regard to the Casa.
We feel that the bike theft
incident should not be used as a
basis of argument to evict MEChA
from our Casa. No Chicano
student stole the bicycles from
any member of the Stanford
community.

We also recognize that Rafas
Robles is the first scapegoat of the
Stanford Administration. His case
is a microcosm of what is
happening everyday to Chicanos
at Stanford. Rafas is innocent, as
are all people of color who are
victims of the Gringo's invasion of
our world. It is the white men
who own Stanford that are the
thieves. It was you and your
fathers who stole our land. Our
demands, at this time, are small in
comparison.

system (formerly the SJC). He is
charged with two counts of
assault during Spring Quarter,
1971, and forgery of a hold card.
During the hearing some
interesting facts were revealed.
The "victim" of the second
alleged assault, actually an open
hand slap to the head, stated that
he was testifying against his own
will, and furthermore testified
that Rafas did not touch him. He
had previously notified MEChA
that he was coerced by the
Stanford Administration into
testifying under the threat of
suspension.
The final issue concerns recent
negotiations between MEChA and
the Stanford Administration,
mainly the Dean of Students
Office about the use of the
MEChA Casa. We are asking the

Administration that: 1) Stanford
re-locate MEChA Casa once the
present Casa is torn down; 2)
Stanford be responsible for losses
directly related to the occupation
of the Casa; 3) Stanford give prior
notice to MEChA if University
officials or police desire to enter
the Casa at anytime; 4) Stanford
pay for all improvements to the
Casa; and 5) Stanford meet and
comply with all Health and Safety
regulations in regard to the Casa.
We feel that the bike theft
incident should not be used as a
basis of argument to evict MEChA
from our Casa. No Chicano
student stole the bicycles from
any member of the Stanford
community.

We also recognize that Rafas
Robles is the first scapegoat of the
Stanford Administration. His case
is a microcosm of what is
happening everyday to Chicanos
at Stanford. Rafas is innocent, as
are all people of color who are
victims of the Gringo's invasion of
our world. It is the white men
who own Stanford that are the
thieves. It was you and your
fathers who stole our land. Our
demands, at this time, are small in
comparison.

We feel that the campus and
public at large should be informed
of three racist events which have
affected Chicanos at Stanford.
The first event is Monday's stolen
bicycle incident.
At approximately 3:30 p.m.,
Delia Islas and Jesse Calvillo,
Chicano students at the MEChA
Casa, opened the front door to
Stanford policeman Blalock and
white student Andrew Baldwin.
Baldwin explained that he had
been told, by an unknown
informer, that his missing bicycle
could be found at the Casa. Islas
and Calvillo allowed them to look
in the back room where the bike
was found, along with several
others.
Santa Clara Sheriffs were then
called to the scene for a return
visit to MEChA (remember
Summer 1971?) and confiscated
the remaining bicycles which had
not been claimed. Included was
one bike which had been
registered at U.C. Berkeley.
We, the Mesa Directiva, elected
officers of MECHA at Stanford,
maintain that MECHA students
did not have any knowledge of
the bicycles in the Casa. We feel
this is a direct attack by
individuals who desire to discredit
MEChA.

At 9:00 a.m., Monday, 30 of
us met at the Casa before going to
the trial at Tresidder Union to
support the struggle of Rafas
Robles, the second issue. At that
time we were not aware that there
were bicycles at the house. One
person at Mecha did see the
bicycles but did not report it.
Rafas is the first student at
Stanford to be subjected to the
Schwartz - Kaplan — Lyman
do-it-yourself aborted judicial
system (formerly the SJC). He is
charged with two counts of
assault during Spring Quarter,
1971, and forgery of a hold card.
