Editor, THE DAILY:
Since my statements Monday
night concerning the protests on
campus something has become
clear to me that was not then so
clear.
The Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement is decidedly not a
violent movement. It is clear that
its leadership has decided firmly
against breaking windows, or
committing other acts of violence
against persons or property that
will lose community support
rather than generate it.

This is a wise decision, and it
should encourage those people
like myself who want change
without using violence to become
involved in themeetings and
discussions of the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement.
I have said that those who
commit acts of violence should be
apprehended and prosecuted, and
that students should aid in that
unhappy process. I would add to
that, however, that the most
responsible course that students
can pursue is to prevent violent
acts from occurring at all. That is
what the members of the
Movement are attempting to do
through their own mechanisms for
internal control, and they should
be applauded and respected for it.
President Lyman has said that
it is a defeat for the University
every time outside police are
summoned to the campus.Some

have countered with the gleeful
assertion that it is a defeat in
particular for the University
Administration. And the
Administration has rebounded
with the statement that it is a
defeat for everyone at the
University.
It is a defeat for everyone, but
it is more than that—it places
everyone in danger. And often
needlessly so. Those who have
been involved in sit-ins this year
have been very disciplined and
careful. They have initiated no
major damage to any building
they entered, when they could
have done much damage had they
been moved to. For the most part,
they have acted quite responsibly.
Given that, it is now
incumbent on the Administration
to reform substantially its
automatic policy on sit-ins. If it is
true that it is a defeat for

everyone at Stanford when the
police are summoned, then why
summon them to end a peaceful
sit-in that represents no threat to
the building or its contents.
Automatic reliance on police
power to quash every sit-in that
forces discussion of an issue is
needless and dangerous and
wrong.
For the question works both
ways. Intransigence and
mindlessness on either side can
breed catastrophe. The movement
has taken steps to act responsibly
and carefully in how it protests
the issues at hand.
And if it is to avoid
responsibility for some bloody

tragedy, then it is time now for
the University Administration to
begin dealing with these protests
in an open and tolerant fashion.
And it is also time—indeed the
time came long ago—for the
Administration to respond
positively to the demand that lays
at the heart of almost every crisis
on campus: a real share of the
power in governing this University
for students and workers and all
groups in the Stanford
community whose beliefs and
sensitivities are continually being
crossed by decisions that they
have no legal authority to affect.

summoned to the campus.Some

have countered with the gleeful
assertion that it is a defeat in
particular for the University
Administration. And the
Administration has rebounded
with the statement that it is a
defeat for everyone at the
University.
It is a defeat for everyone, but
it is more than that—it places
everyone in danger. And often
needlessly so. Those who have
been involved in sit-ins this year
have been very disciplined and
careful. They have initiated no
major damage to any building
they entered, when they could
have done much damage had they
been moved to. For the most part,
they have acted quite responsibly.
Given that, it is now
incumbent on the Administration
to reform substantially its
automatic policy on sit-ins. If it is
true that it is a defeat for

everyone at Stanford when the
police are summoned, then why
summon them to end a peaceful
sit-in that represents no threat to
the building or its contents.
Automatic reliance on police
power to quash every sit-in that
forces discussion of an issue is
needless and dangerous and
wrong.
For the question works both
ways. Intransigence and
mindlessness on either side can
breed catastrophe. The movement
has taken steps to act responsibly
and carefully in how it protests
the issues at hand.
And if it is to avoid
responsibility for some bloody

tragedy, then it is time now for
the University Administration to
begin dealing with these protests
in an open and tolerant fashion.
And it is also time—indeed the
time came long ago—for the
Administration to respond
positively to the demand that lays
at the heart of almost every crisis
on campus: a real share of the
power in governing this University
for students and workers and all
groups in the Stanford
community whose beliefs and
sensitivities are continually being
crossed by decisions that they
have no legal authority to affect.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Since my statements Monday
night concerning the protests on
campus something has become
clear to me that was not then so
clear.
The Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement is decidedly not a
violent movement. It is clear that
its leadership has decided firmly
against breaking windows, or
committing other acts of violence
against persons or property that
will lose community support
rather than generate it.

This is a wise decision, and it
should encourage those people
like myself who want change
without using violence to become
involved in themeetings and
discussions of the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement.
I have said that those who
commit acts of violence should be
apprehended and prosecuted, and
that students should aid in that
unhappy process. I would add to
that, however, that the most
responsible course that students
can pursue is to prevent violent
acts from occurring at all. That is
what the members of the
Movement are attempting to do
through their own mechanisms for
internal control, and they should
be applauded and respected for it.

it is a defeat for the University
every time outside police are
summoned to the campus.Some
