# March 6 Tops Draft List In Possible Final Lottery
## 
### BOB MICHELET 
March 6, 1953 was selected as the
number one priority birth date
yesterday in a draft lottery that may
mark a sharp decline in full-scale
Selective Service activity.
President Nixon has predicted a
July, 1973 date for an end to all draft
calls, and only a stand-by lottery is
planned for next year.
Yesterday's draw, held in
Washington, D.C., assigned numbers to
all U.S. males who turn 19 years old
during 1972. The draft eligibility of
these men will begin January 1, 1973.
Lower Calls
The highest number reached last
year was 125, but Draft Director
Curtis Tarr said "we do expect calls to
be lower than they have been in recent
years."
Tarr told newsmen the Pentagon
has not indicated its manpower needs,
because defense officials say so much

depends on the state of the nation's
economy and unemployment levels.
The administration hopes to have
an all-volunteer army when the current
draft authority expires on June 30,
1973. Stanford draft counselors
suggest that draft calls may fall to zero
as early as this summer.
In contrast to the three previous
lotteries, there were no demonstrators
outside the Commerce Department
auditorium. Inside, the atmosphere
was more relaxed, probably because
this may well be the last draw that
would affect any men.
"Since the first drawing was held in
December, 1969," Tarr said, "both the
U.S. military situation and Selective
Service have changed a great deal. The
manpower requirements of the armed
services have decreased considerably,
and there has been a corresponding
lowering of the number of men
inducted each year."

A draft quota for this year has not
been set by the Defense Department.
Secretary Melvin Laird said early this
week that no one will be called at least
until April 1.
The numbers were drawn by
members of state Selective Service
Youth Advisory Commissions in
Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania.
Two drums were used, one
containing capsules with the 365 dates
and another with numbers one
through 365. As a number from one
drum was drawn, a date was drawn to
correspond with it.
It was not until the 287 th draw
that March 6 was matched with No. 1.
Shortly before, March 7 was drawn as
the No. 2 date.
July Winners
July 23 was picked as the lowest
priority number, while September 9
matched with No. 364.
Yesterday's lottery will affect only
those men who turn 19 this year. Men
who received a number in previous
draws will keep the same number.
A man keeps his number as long as
he is exposed to a possible draft,
normally up to age 26. If a man who
received a number today is not drafted
next year and is I-A, he will drop into
a lower category and cannot be called
up short of a national emergency.
If a man has a deferment, he will be
vulnerable to a draft, if there is one, in
the year he drops his deferment.
Present plans call for the usual
mental and physical exams for men
with low numbers.

WINNER WHO LOST—"I feel like I'm witnessing my own funeral," stated this
decorator. "This is one contest I wish I hadn't won." Residents of his dormitory
each contributed a dollar to a jackpot awarded to the person with the lowest
draft number.
