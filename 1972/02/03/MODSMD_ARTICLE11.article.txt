## Campus Trials Have Long History 
### 
Barbara by land and jon marx

On Friday, February 4th, the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) will
open hearings against four
demonstrators who entered the
Placement Center this fall to halt
"incitement to violence" by war
recruiters. The following article
has been written to present a brief
history of the Stanford Judicial
System and clarify the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement's
position on the upcoming hearings.
In 1967, still the days of panty
raids and curfew for women
students, students charged with
violations of the Honor Code and
the Fundamental Standard were
tried by an all-student judicial
board. The campus was tranquil
except for small Peace Vigils.
Student activism off campus,
however, was growing. Many
followed David Harris' example
and joined the Resistance. Others
shut down the Oakland Induction
Center in the fall of 1967.
In that same fall, the CIA came
on campus to recruit and several
students and faculty members
(including Bruce Frnaklin)
disrupted the interviews. They
picketed, made noise, and jumped
on the floor of the room above
the interviewer's head. In the
process of the demonstration, the
Dean of Students was hit over the
head with a picket sign.
The case was brought before
the student judicial board which
ruled that the protesters' conduct
did not violate the Fundamental

Standard. All six defendants weir
acquitted. The Administration
would not accept that decision
and took the case to an all-faculty
board. The defendants were found
guilty and several were expelled.
In the campus uproar that
followed, students seized the Old
Union for three days in the first
major sit-in in Stanford's history.
The students emerged
victorious charges against the
defendants were dropped, the
judicial procedure was revised to
create the Student Judicial
Council (SJC), and amnesty was
granted to all those sit ting-in.
Too Hasty
The acceptance of the new
judicial system was too hasty,
however, for it put the students
under the jurisdiction of a board
in which students were a
minority. Only four out of the
nine members of the SJC were
students, and they were appointed
by Committees with faculty
members on them.
Also in the wave of judicial
reform, the Administration
instituted a Campus Disruption
Policy, makig it unlawful to
disrupt the "legitimate functions"
of the University.
The SJC functioned wtih
somewhat tenuous power through
1969, 1970 and 1971; holding
hearings on such incidents as the
disruption of the Trusteees'
meeting, the Encina sit-in, and the
ROTC and Lodge demonstrations.
The political climate in 1968
and 1969 shifted as students
began to focus on Stanford's
complicity with the war in
Vietnam. SDS demanded that
Stanford "get out" of Southeast
Asia and that, as a first step, the
Trustees resign from their
military-oriented corporations.
Faculty Club
In the winter of 1969, several
people walked into a Trustees'
meeting in the Faculty Club and
were brought before the SJC for
causing disruption. Their example
sparked the April 3rd movement,
which demanded an end to
classified research,
chemical-biological warfare
research and counter-insurgency
research. The movement
demanded that Stanford Research
Institute be brought under closer
community control. When more
than 1300 people sat-in at the
Applied Electronics Lab (AEL)
and signed complicity statements
with the movement,
Administration threats to
prosecute were disregarded. The

building was vacated after nine
days only when the
Administration promised to have
the building shut down.
A few weeks after A EL, the
decision was made to occupy
Encina. The vote was taken at a
very emotional meeting which left
many people feeling bitter and
manipualted. When the door to
Encina was smashed open,those
who had been wavering about the
action retreated. Only 125 people
actually entered the building
while 1,000 more stood outside,
In the early morning, the police
came on campus for the first time
and cleared the building.
Suspensions
Realizing the Movement was
disillusioned and factionalized,
the Administration didn't bother
to keep up an appearance of
justice. It suspended the
demonstrators prior to trial. The
suspensions were reinforced by a
court injunction which meant that
by entering a classroom building,
defendants could get six months
in jail for contempt of court.
The suspensions were to be
lifted once the defendants asked
for a trial. The request for a group
trial, however, was denied, and
the defendants remained
suspended for several weeks. They
were eventually allowed a group
trial on the condition that they
plead guilty and rpesent only their
motivations. The defendants
performed a fifteen-minute
guerilla theater skit and walked
out.
In recent years, the main SJC
trials have revolved around the
off-ROTC movement and the
Lodge disruption. The judicial
system, however, has come under
increasingly more severe criticism.
In March, 1971, President Lyman
asked the ASSU Senate to appoint
its four student representatives,
once more, to the SJC
appointment committee. The
committee, in turn, would select
student members of the SJC' This
time, however, the Senate refused
to do so.
Reforms
The Senate articulated wheat
they felt were constructive
reforms for the system in a
referendum held soon afterwards.
The referendum stated that: 1)
the SJC should have jurisdiction
over proceedings concerning
faculty members, or consist
entirely of students for student
proceedings; 2) the SJC should
not be allowed to try students
already participating in legal

proceedings outside the
University, thereby creating
double jeopardy, and 3) SJC
decisions should be binding and
implemented, not merely
recommendations to be overruled
by President Lyman.
The referendum passed by
student vote but has not yet been
recognized as legitimate policy.
In the meantime, President
Lyman, by emergency powers
confered upon him in Article 4 of
Stanford's Legistlative and
Judicial Charter, called for an
interim committee of three
faculty, three students, and one
chairman. This has been called the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP).
The chairman, John Kaplan of
the Law School, was appointed by
President Lyman and eats lunch at
the Faculty Club with University
Prosecutor John Schwartz. The
faculty (Richard Brody of
Political Science, David Nivison of
Philosophy, and Robert White of
Materials Science and Electrical
Engineering) were appointed by
the faculty. The students were
chosen randomly by Stanford's
unbiased computer.
No Reconciliation
Fall of 1971 came with no
reconciliation. In a vote of 13-12,
The Senate reconfirmed its refusal
to participate in the SJC or CJP.
In a vote of 19-7, they also
resolved that they would
encouage all students not to
participate in President Lyman's
intterim judicial procedure until
the recommended reforms were
implemented.
In defiance of the Senate votes
and the student resolution, the
CJP has already begun
proceedings against a Chicano
student who has been tried in the
state court.
Our attempts to use reason,
and dialogue with the
administration have obviusly
failed. Our only recourse now is
to prevent those CJP hearings
from beginning on Friday when
those who disrupted Honeywell
Recruiters will go on trial. If there
is one thing we've learned from
the history of radical activities at
Stanford it is that repression
breeds resistance. We urge
everyone to join with us at 9 a.m.
at the Forum Room of Ugly on
Friday and together we will stop
the trials.

In 1967, still the days of panty
raids and curfew for women
students, students charged with
violations of the Honor Code and
the Fundamental Standard were
tried by an all-student judicial
board. The campus was tranquil
except for small Peace Vigils.
Student activism off campus,
however, was growing. Many
followed David Harris' example
and joined the Resistance. Others
shut down the Oakland Induction
Center in the fall of 1967.
In that same fall, the CIA came
on campus to recruit and several
students and faculty members
(including Bruce Frnaklin)
disrupted the interviews. They
picketed, made noise, and jumped
on the floor of the room above
the interviewer's head. In the
process of the demonstration, the
Dean of Students was hit over the
head with a picket sign.
The case was brought before
the student judicial board which
ruled that the protesters' conduct
did not violate the Fundamental

Standard. All six defendants weir
acquitted. The Administration
would not accept that decision
and took the case to an all-faculty
board. The defendants were found
guilty and several were expelled.
In the campus uproar that
followed, students seized the Old
Union for three days in the first
major sit-in in Stanford's history.
The students emerged
victorious charges against the
defendants were dropped, the
judicial procedure was revised to
create the Student Judicial
Council (SJC), and amnesty was
granted to all those sit ting-in.
Too Hasty
The acceptance of the new
judicial system was too hasty,
however, for it put the students
under the jurisdiction of a board
in which students were a
minority. Only four out of the
nine members of the SJC were
students, and they were appointed
by Committees with faculty
members on them.
Also in the wave of judicial
reform, the Administration
instituted a Campus Disruption
Policy, makig it unlawful to
disrupt the "legitimate functions"
of the University.
The SJC functioned wtih
somewhat tenuous power through
1969, 1970 and 1971; holding
hearings on such incidents as the
disruption of the Trusteees'
meeting, the Encina sit-in, and the
ROTC and Lodge demonstrations.
The political climate in 1968
and 1969 shifted as students
began to focus on Stanford's
complicity with the war in
Vietnam. SDS demanded that
Stanford "get out" of Southeast
Asia and that, as a first step, the
Trustees resign from their
military-oriented corporations.
Faculty Club
In the winter of 1969, several
people walked into a Trustees'
meeting in the Faculty Club and
were brought before the SJC for
causing disruption. Their example
sparked the April 3rd movement,
which demanded an end to
classified research,
chemical-biological warfare
research and counter-insurgency
research. The movement
demanded that Stanford Research
Institute be brought under closer
community control. When more
than 1300 people sat-in at the
Applied Electronics Lab (AEL)
and signed complicity statements
with the movement,
Administration threats to
prosecute were disregarded. The

building was vacated after nine
days only when the
Administration promised to have
the building shut down.
A few weeks after A EL, the
decision was made to occupy
Encina. The vote was taken at a
very emotional meeting which left
many people feeling bitter and
manipualted. When the door to
Encina was smashed open,those
who had been wavering about the
action retreated. Only 125 people
actually entered the building
while 1,000 more stood outside,
In the early morning, the police
came on campus for the first time
and cleared the building.
Suspensions
Realizing the Movement was
disillusioned and factionalized,
the Administration didn't bother
to keep up an appearance of
justice. It suspended the
demonstrators prior to trial. The
suspensions were reinforced by a
court injunction which meant that
by entering a classroom building,
defendants could get six months
in jail for contempt of court.
The suspensions were to be
lifted once the defendants asked
for a trial. The request for a group
trial, however, was denied, and
the defendants remained
suspended for several weeks. They
were eventually allowed a group
trial on the condition that they
plead guilty and rpesent only their
motivations. The defendants
performed a fifteen-minute
guerilla theater skit and walked
out.
In recent years, the main SJC
trials have revolved around the
off-ROTC movement and the
Lodge disruption. The judicial
system, however, has come under
increasingly more severe criticism.
In March, 1971, President Lyman
asked the ASSU Senate to appoint
its four student representatives,
once more, to the SJC
appointment committee. The
committee, in turn, would select
student members of the SJC' This
time, however, the Senate refused
to do so.
Reforms
The Senate articulated wheat
they felt were constructive
reforms for the system in a
referendum held soon afterwards.
The referendum stated that: 1)
the SJC should have jurisdiction
over proceedings concerning
faculty members, or consist
entirely of students for student
proceedings; 2) the SJC should
not be allowed to try students
already participating in legal

proceedings outside the
University, thereby creating
double jeopardy, and 3) SJC
decisions should be binding and
implemented, not merely
recommendations to be overruled
by President Lyman.
The referendum passed by
student vote but has not yet been
recognized as legitimate policy.
In the meantime, President
Lyman, by emergency powers
confered upon him in Article 4 of
Stanford's Legistlative and
Judicial Charter, called for an
interim committee of three
faculty, three students, and one
chairman. This has been called the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP).
The chairman, John Kaplan of
the Law School, was appointed by
President Lyman and eats lunch at
the Faculty Club with University
Prosecutor John Schwartz. The
faculty (Richard Brody of
Political Science, David Nivison of
Philosophy, and Robert White of
Materials Science and Electrical
Engineering) were appointed by
the faculty. The students were
chosen randomly by Stanford's
unbiased computer.
No Reconciliation
Fall of 1971 came with no
reconciliation. In a vote of 13-12,
The Senate reconfirmed its refusal
to participate in the SJC or CJP.
In a vote of 19-7, they also
resolved that they would
encouage all students not to
participate in President Lyman's
intterim judicial procedure until
the recommended reforms were
implemented.
In defiance of the Senate votes
and the student resolution, the
CJP has already begun
proceedings against a Chicano
student who has been tried in the
state court.
Our attempts to use reason,
and dialogue with the
administration have obviusly
failed. Our only recourse now is
to prevent those CJP hearings
from beginning on Friday when
those who disrupted Honeywell
Recruiters will go on trial. If there
is one thing we've learned from
the history of radical activities at
Stanford it is that repression
breeds resistance. We urge
everyone to join with us at 9 a.m.
at the Forum Room of Ugly on
Friday and together we will stop
the trials.

Center in the fall of 1967.
In that same fall, the CIA came
on campus to recruit and several
students and faculty members
(including Bruce Frnaklin)
disrupted the interviews. They
picketed, made noise, and jumped
on the floor of the room above
the interviewer's head. In the
process of the demonstration, the
Dean of Students was hit over the
head with a picket sign.
The case was brought before
the student judicial board which
ruled that the protesters' conduct
did not violate the Fundamental

Standard. All six defendants weir
acquitted. The Administration
would not accept that decision
and took the case to an all-faculty
board. The defendants were found
guilty and several were expelled.
In the campus uproar that
followed, students seized the Old
Union for three days in the first
major sit-in in Stanford's history.
The students emerged
victorious charges against the
defendants were dropped, the
judicial procedure was revised to
create the Student Judicial
Council (SJC), and amnesty was
granted to all those sit ting-in.
Too Hasty
The acceptance of the new
judicial system was too hasty,
however, for it put the students
under the jurisdiction of a board
in which students were a
minority. Only four out of the
nine members of the SJC were
students, and they were appointed
by Committees with faculty
members on them.
Also in the wave of judicial
reform, the Administration
instituted a Campus Disruption
Policy, makig it unlawful to
disrupt the "legitimate functions"
of the University.
The SJC functioned wtih
somewhat tenuous power through
1969, 1970 and 1971; holding
hearings on such incidents as the
disruption of the Trusteees'
meeting, the Encina sit-in, and the
ROTC and Lodge demonstrations.
The political climate in 1968
and 1969 shifted as students
began to focus on Stanford's
complicity with the war in
Vietnam. SDS demanded that
Stanford "get out" of Southeast
Asia and that, as a first step, the
Trustees resign from their
military-oriented corporations.
Faculty Club
In the winter of 1969, several
people walked into a Trustees'
meeting in the Faculty Club and
were brought before the SJC for
causing disruption. Their example
sparked the April 3rd movement,
which demanded an end to
classified research,
chemical-biological warfare
research and counter-insurgency
research. The movement
demanded that Stanford Research
Institute be brought under closer
community control. When more
than 1300 people sat-in at the
Applied Electronics Lab (AEL)
and signed complicity statements
with the movement,
Administration threats to
prosecute were disregarded. The

building was vacated after nine
days only when the
Administration promised to have
the building shut down.
A few weeks after A EL, the
decision was made to occupy
Encina. The vote was taken at a
very emotional meeting which left
many people feeling bitter and
manipualted. When the door to
Encina was smashed open,those
who had been wavering about the
action retreated. Only 125 people
actually entered the building
while 1,000 more stood outside,
In the early morning, the police
came on campus for the first time
and cleared the building.
Suspensions
Realizing the Movement was
disillusioned and factionalized,
the Administration didn't bother
to keep up an appearance of
justice. It suspended the
demonstrators prior to trial. The
suspensions were reinforced by a
court injunction which meant that
by entering a classroom building,
defendants could get six months
in jail for contempt of court.
The suspensions were to be
lifted once the defendants asked
for a trial. The request for a group
trial, however, was denied, and
the defendants remained
suspended for several weeks. They
were eventually allowed a group
trial on the condition that they
plead guilty and rpesent only their
motivations. The defendants
performed a fifteen-minute
guerilla theater skit and walked
out.
In recent years, the main SJC
trials have revolved around the
off-ROTC movement and the
Lodge disruption. The judicial
system, however, has come under
increasingly more severe criticism.
In March, 1971, President Lyman
asked the ASSU Senate to appoint
its four student representatives,
once more, to the SJC
appointment committee. The
committee, in turn, would select
student members of the SJC' This
time, however, the Senate refused
to do so.
Reforms
The Senate articulated wheat
they felt were constructive
reforms for the system in a
referendum held soon afterwards.
The referendum stated that: 1)
the SJC should have jurisdiction
over proceedings concerning
faculty members, or consist
entirely of students for student
proceedings; 2) the SJC should
not be allowed to try students
already participating in legal

proceedings outside the
University, thereby creating
double jeopardy, and 3) SJC
decisions should be binding and
implemented, not merely
recommendations to be overruled
by President Lyman.
The referendum passed by
student vote but has not yet been
recognized as legitimate policy.
In the meantime, President
Lyman, by emergency powers
confered upon him in Article 4 of
Stanford's Legistlative and
Judicial Charter, called for an
interim committee of three
faculty, three students, and one
chairman. This has been called the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP).
The chairman, John Kaplan of
the Law School, was appointed by
President Lyman and eats lunch at
the Faculty Club with University
Prosecutor John Schwartz. The
faculty (Richard Brody of
Political Science, David Nivison of
Philosophy, and Robert White of
Materials Science and Electrical
Engineering) were appointed by
the faculty. The students were
chosen randomly by Stanford's
unbiased computer.
No Reconciliation
Fall of 1971 came with no
reconciliation. In a vote of 13-12,
The Senate reconfirmed its refusal
to participate in the SJC or CJP.
In a vote of 19-7, they also
resolved that they would
encouage all students not to
participate in President Lyman's
intterim judicial procedure until
the recommended reforms were
implemented.
In defiance of the Senate votes
and the student resolution, the
CJP has already begun
proceedings against a Chicano
student who has been tried in the
state court.
Our attempts to use reason,
and dialogue with the
administration have obviusly
failed. Our only recourse now is
to prevent those CJP hearings
from beginning on Friday when
those who disrupted Honeywell
Recruiters will go on trial. If there
is one thing we've learned from
the history of radical activities at
Stanford it is that repression
breeds resistance. We urge
everyone to join with us at 9 a.m.
at the Forum Room of Ugly on
Friday and together we will stop
the trials.

The case was brought before
the student judicial board which
ruled that the protesters' conduct
did not violate the Fundamental

Standard. All six defendants weir
acquitted. The Administration
would not accept that decision
and took the case to an all-faculty
board. The defendants were found
guilty and several were expelled.
In the campus uproar that
followed, students seized the Old
Union for three days in the first
major sit-in in Stanford's history.
The students emerged
victorious charges against the
defendants were dropped, the
judicial procedure was revised to
create the Student Judicial
Council (SJC), and amnesty was
granted to all those sit ting-in.
Too Hasty
The acceptance of the new
judicial system was too hasty,
however, for it put the students
under the jurisdiction of a board
in which students were a
minority. Only four out of the
nine members of the SJC were
students, and they were appointed
by Committees with faculty
members on them.
Also in the wave of judicial
reform, the Administration
instituted a Campus Disruption
Policy, makig it unlawful to
disrupt the "legitimate functions"
of the University.
The SJC functioned wtih
somewhat tenuous power through
1969, 1970 and 1971; holding
hearings on such incidents as the
disruption of the Trusteees'
meeting, the Encina sit-in, and the
ROTC and Lodge demonstrations.
The political climate in 1968
and 1969 shifted as students
began to focus on Stanford's
complicity with the war in
Vietnam. SDS demanded that
Stanford "get out" of Southeast
Asia and that, as a first step, the
Trustees resign from their
military-oriented corporations.
Faculty Club
In the winter of 1969, several
people walked into a Trustees'
meeting in the Faculty Club and
were brought before the SJC for
causing disruption. Their example
sparked the April 3rd movement,
which demanded an end to
classified research,
chemical-biological warfare
research and counter-insurgency
research. The movement
demanded that Stanford Research
Institute be brought under closer
community control. When more
than 1300 people sat-in at the
Applied Electronics Lab (AEL)
and signed complicity statements
with the movement,
Administration threats to
prosecute were disregarded. The

building was vacated after nine
days only when the
Administration promised to have
the building shut down.
A few weeks after A EL, the
decision was made to occupy
Encina. The vote was taken at a
very emotional meeting which left
many people feeling bitter and
manipualted. When the door to
Encina was smashed open,those
who had been wavering about the
action retreated. Only 125 people
actually entered the building
while 1,000 more stood outside,
In the early morning, the police
came on campus for the first time
and cleared the building.
Suspensions
Realizing the Movement was
disillusioned and factionalized,
the Administration didn't bother
to keep up an appearance of
justice. It suspended the
demonstrators prior to trial. The
suspensions were reinforced by a
court injunction which meant that
by entering a classroom building,
defendants could get six months
in jail for contempt of court.
The suspensions were to be
lifted once the defendants asked
for a trial. The request for a group
trial, however, was denied, and
the defendants remained
suspended for several weeks. They
were eventually allowed a group
trial on the condition that they
plead guilty and rpesent only their
motivations. The defendants
performed a fifteen-minute
guerilla theater skit and walked
out.
In recent years, the main SJC
trials have revolved around the
off-ROTC movement and the
Lodge disruption. The judicial
system, however, has come under
increasingly more severe criticism.
In March, 1971, President Lyman
asked the ASSU Senate to appoint
its four student representatives,
once more, to the SJC
appointment committee. The
committee, in turn, would select
student members of the SJC' This
time, however, the Senate refused
to do so.
Reforms
The Senate articulated wheat
they felt were constructive
reforms for the system in a
referendum held soon afterwards.
The referendum stated that: 1)
the SJC should have jurisdiction
over proceedings concerning
faculty members, or consist
entirely of students for student
proceedings; 2) the SJC should
not be allowed to try students
already participating in legal

proceedings outside the
University, thereby creating
double jeopardy, and 3) SJC
decisions should be binding and
implemented, not merely
recommendations to be overruled
by President Lyman.
The referendum passed by
student vote but has not yet been
recognized as legitimate policy.
In the meantime, President
Lyman, by emergency powers
confered upon him in Article 4 of
Stanford's Legistlative and
Judicial Charter, called for an
interim committee of three
faculty, three students, and one
chairman. This has been called the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP).
The chairman, John Kaplan of
the Law School, was appointed by
President Lyman and eats lunch at
the Faculty Club with University
Prosecutor John Schwartz. The
faculty (Richard Brody of
Political Science, David Nivison of
Philosophy, and Robert White of
Materials Science and Electrical
Engineering) were appointed by
the faculty. The students were
chosen randomly by Stanford's
unbiased computer.
No Reconciliation
Fall of 1971 came with no
reconciliation. In a vote of 13-12,
The Senate reconfirmed its refusal
to participate in the SJC or CJP.
In a vote of 19-7, they also
resolved that they would
encouage all students not to
participate in President Lyman's
intterim judicial procedure until
the recommended reforms were
implemented.
In defiance of the Senate votes
and the student resolution, the
CJP has already begun
proceedings against a Chicano
student who has been tried in the
state court.
Our attempts to use reason,
and dialogue with the
administration have obviusly
failed. Our only recourse now is
to prevent those CJP hearings
from beginning on Friday when
those who disrupted Honeywell
Recruiters will go on trial. If there
is one thing we've learned from
the history of radical activities at
Stanford it is that repression
breeds resistance. We urge
everyone to join with us at 9 a.m.
at the Forum Room of Ugly on
Friday and together we will stop
the trials.

Rehabilitation Movement.)
