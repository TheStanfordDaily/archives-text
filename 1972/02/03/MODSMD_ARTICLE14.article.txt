# On Broadway
## Tips For Topless Town 
### DAN BRENNER 
Few experiences can be as refreshing as a
Saturday night field trip to that mecca of
haut-culture San Francisco, Broadway at North
Beach.
For freshmen who have not extended themselves
beyond the parameters of the Paris Expresso
Theater to the east or Mayfield Avenue to the west,
or for physics PhD. candidates who have not seen
daylight since they entered Varian labs last
September, Broadway is the Bay Area's gaslight
district.
As a person whose moral attitudes are
self-admittedly predominantly puritanical—my idea
of a seductive act is Annette Funicello doing the
twist in a beach party movie— the North Beach
world borders on science fiction. Nevertheless for
those who have thought about the possibility of a
"wild evening out on the town," the following three
suggestions may make the evening all the more wild.
It should be stressed that such suggestions would
be most valuable for the untried, people out there,
the ones who still get a kick out of watching a
Fizzies tablet bubble in a glass of Sparkletts.
Helpful Hints
1. Don't take a car. The cable car ride from
Market and Powell Streets is a real zinger and if you
aren't crunched onto the back platform, the crisp
San Francisco breeze will make your eyes water.
However, the crisp San Francisco breeze will also
make the water in your eyes freeze, so some
precaution is advisable. While sunglasses at night will
make you appear suspect, a pair of goggles can be
slipped on while going down a hill would not be out
of order. Besides, it might start a new fashion.
2. Travel with a companion. After disembarking
from the cable car, the walk to Broadway is a quick
three blocks. Unfortunately the three blocks
resemble Chicago in the thirties or Central Park on
an unlit night. This isn't to say that one isn't safe
walking over to Broadway. Any person who has a
fundamental ability in karate, jujitsu, and
kick-boxing should experience no trepidation
walking the blocks alone. One could dare say that
anyone over 275 pounts could dispense with such
skills, as well.
However, if you resemble a five foot ten bean
sprout like myself, there is a bit of smug security in
knowing that, should some traveling salesman
happen to want to demonstrate the newest thing in
blackjacks, at least he'll get your companion first.
One other suggestion: before going up to North
Beach using this route, practice whistling, "You'll
Never Walk Alone;" it might come in handy.
3. Don't spend too much time in any one place.
Once yourrive at the entrance to Broadway's block
of nighclubs, you will be thrilled at the dazzling
display of bright lights, colorful marquees, and
the most sordid teasers this side of Tijuana.

Among the more touristy places is "Big Al's".
Currently appearing at Big Al's is a stage show
entitled "Dance of Love." The choreography leaves
something to be desired, but the costumes leave
nothing to the imagination. Also located on this
street are such historical institutions as the Condor
Club, where the whole Broadway scene started with
Carol Doda's immodest use of silicon to her act.
While Miss Doda started her own club a few years
ago, she has returned to the Condor, which shows
what a sentimental performer she is.
Another hot spot is the Casbah. Here the visitor
may enjoy the catcalls of one consumately
unauthentic Arab barker. The Cashbah could be
considered, conservative if not Victorian for their
stick-to-it attitude of presenting only belly dancing
as their stage show. One gets the impression that
belly dancing to regular Broadway shows is like
comparing a bathtub to the Atlantic Ocean.
Finally, a few clubs down from the Cashbah is an
institution whose barker advertises with the boast,
"This place has been busted 29 times. It must be
good." From the advertisements on the outside of
this club a visitor will leave Broadway, convinced
that bust number 30 is not far off.

HANGING OUT—A large number of Stanford students and assorted bystanders stood outside the Condor
Club on Big Game night 1970 awaiting a promised topless dance by two of the Condor's performers. They
finally made an appearance (above) outside one of the club's windows, fully clothed. Despite their clothed
status, the police soon came and hustled them back inside. In that neighborhood, it couldn't have been for
disturbing the peace.

or for physics PhD. candidates who have not seen
daylight since they entered Varian labs last
September, Broadway is the Bay Area's gaslight
district.
As a person whose moral attitudes are
self-admittedly predominantly puritanical—my idea
of a seductive act is Annette Funicello doing the
twist in a beach party movie— the North Beach
world borders on science fiction. Nevertheless for
those who have thought about the possibility of a
"wild evening out on the town," the following three
suggestions may make the evening all the more wild.
It should be stressed that such suggestions would
be most valuable for the untried, people out there,
the ones who still get a kick out of watching a
Fizzies tablet bubble in a glass of Sparkletts.
Helpful Hints
1. Don't take a car. The cable car ride from
Market and Powell Streets is a real zinger and if you
aren't crunched onto the back platform, the crisp
San Francisco breeze will make your eyes water.
However, the crisp San Francisco breeze will also
make the water in your eyes freeze, so some
precaution is advisable. While sunglasses at night will
make you appear suspect, a pair of goggles can be
slipped on while going down a hill would not be out
of order. Besides, it might start a new fashion.
2. Travel with a companion. After disembarking
from the cable car, the walk to Broadway is a quick
three blocks. Unfortunately the three blocks
resemble Chicago in the thirties or Central Park on
an unlit night. This isn't to say that one isn't safe
walking over to Broadway. Any person who has a
fundamental ability in karate, jujitsu, and
kick-boxing should experience no trepidation
walking the blocks alone. One could dare say that
anyone over 275 pounts could dispense with such
skills, as well.
However, if you resemble a five foot ten bean
sprout like myself, there is a bit of smug security in
knowing that, should some traveling salesman
happen to want to demonstrate the newest thing in
blackjacks, at least he'll get your companion first.
One other suggestion: before going up to North
Beach using this route, practice whistling, "You'll
Never Walk Alone;" it might come in handy.
3. Don't spend too much time in any one place.
Once yourrive at the entrance to Broadway's block
of nighclubs, you will be thrilled at the dazzling
display of bright lights, colorful marquees, and
the most sordid teasers this side of Tijuana.

Among the more touristy places is "Big Al's".
Currently appearing at Big Al's is a stage show
entitled "Dance of Love." The choreography leaves
something to be desired, but the costumes leave
nothing to the imagination. Also located on this
street are such historical institutions as the Condor
Club, where the whole Broadway scene started with
Carol Doda's immodest use of silicon to her act.
While Miss Doda started her own club a few years
ago, she has returned to the Condor, which shows
what a sentimental performer she is.
Another hot spot is the Casbah. Here the visitor
may enjoy the catcalls of one consumately
unauthentic Arab barker. The Cashbah could be
considered, conservative if not Victorian for their
stick-to-it attitude of presenting only belly dancing
as their stage show. One gets the impression that
belly dancing to regular Broadway shows is like
comparing a bathtub to the Atlantic Ocean.
Finally, a few clubs down from the Cashbah is an
institution whose barker advertises with the boast,
"This place has been busted 29 times. It must be
good." From the advertisements on the outside of
this club a visitor will leave Broadway, convinced
that bust number 30 is not far off.

finally made an appearance (above) outside one of the club's windows, fully clothed. Despite their clothed
status, the police soon came and hustled them back inside. In that neighborhood, it couldn't have been for
disturbing the peace.
