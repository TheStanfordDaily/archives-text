# Drama Dept. Production
## An Exciting 'Edward II' 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Long Elizabethean dramas with
their typically large casts and
complicated plots can often either
be very boring and tiring or very
exciting and moving. Fortunately,
the Stanford Drama Department's
current production of Christopher
Marlowe's "Edward II" is best
described by the latter adjectives.
Basically strong acting
performances have been combined
with excellent direction and
incredible technical work to make
"Edward II" one of the first
dramatic highlights of this young
year.
It is a cliche to point out that
the lasting value of good drama
comes from its "relevancy" to
different times and societies. Most
people who have seen even as few
as one good work by William
Shakespeare would tend to agree.
Marlowe's work is another very
obvious testimony to the ability
of good drama to outlive both its
author and the society in which it
was based.
This 16th century work
concerns the reign of Edward II
from 1307 to 1330. The story
begins with Edwards ascension to
the throne. Immediately the new
king displays his antagonism for
existing standards of royal
behavior by recalling his male
lover, Gaveston, who had been
exiled by his father for corrupting
young Edward.
Rehabilitiate the King
Many members of Edward's
court feel his behavior is very
threatening to the welfare of their
country and they want to again
"banish Gaveston, as a possible first
step in "rehabilitating" the king.
But Queen Isabella remains
faithful despite Edward's obvious
preference for Gaveston and she
convinces the opposition forces,
led by her lover, Mortimer, to
repeal Gaveston's banishment.
Gaveston's haughty presence
sparks predictable violence and a
bloody civil war soon begins.
Eventually Edward is stripped of
his crown and he follows his father
into the grave. Soon afterwards,
the new King Edward imprisons
his mother and has Mortimer, the
leader of the "rebels," killed. The
drama has completed its
360-degree revolution and 20+
years after his father had faced a
similar situation, the new King
Edward begins his reign with a
great possibility of future violence
and unrest.

The applicability to today's
political situation of many of the
questions Marlowe raises is
obvious almost from the
beeinnine of the play. Will a
political alternative which on
paper seems vastly preferable to
an existing system be as successful
in practice? Does political power
grow out of the point of a sword?
How are .iacred and secular law
and morality compatible or
incompatible? How do most
political figures weight personal
relationships and actions in terms
of their possible influence on a
public image?
Marlowe's Shrewdness
How shrewd it was of Marlowe
to emphasize the question of a
king's personal relationships and
their influence on his public image
and indirectly a whole country,
by making the king's lover be a
male.
These and many other
questions including deeply
philosophical ones about love,
death etc., are definitely
contained in Marlowe's work, but
it takes a strong production as the
Stanford one to make them
become apparent to the audience.
The cast was almost without
exception composed of quite
talented actors. In the first act
especially, a few actors' words
were a bit hard to understand, but
throughout the great majority of
the play, vocal delivery and
articulation was much more than
merely adequate.
There always exists a
temptation with works from
another period to try and recreate
the diction and accents of that
time, this can often create
numberous problems for many
actors. This cast seemed more
intent in clearly getting the all
important blank verse across to
the audience and their approach
worked well.
Leo Greene as the Bishop of
Coventry was particularly
noteworthy for his magnificently
powerful and stately vocal
delivery. W. B. Nodiff as Prince
Edward had a marvelous accent
and she carried off her majorspeech
at the end of the play with the
necessary combination of
precision and strength.
Moving to total acting
performances, Peter Silbert as
Edward II was very good in a
most difficult role. Silbert saved
his finest acting for the scene in
which he resigns his crown and his

performance at this crucial point
in the play was no less than
magnificent.
Carolyn Gillespie as Queen
Isabella made the only female role
in the play quite memorable as
she successfully executed the
difficult change from a nearly
blindly faithful wife to Edward to
a lover of his rival Mortimer.
Ron Vawter was cunning and
forceful as Mortimer and Roger
Kozol did a fine job as the very
dislikeable Gaveston. The
remainder of the cast was nearly
totally competent.
Very important to the
production's success was the
incredibly professional technical
work and expert coordination of
all facets of the production by
director Stephen Rosenfield.
To detail the technical
components which were such an
integral part of this production's
success would take an incredible
amount of space, but for brevity's
sake let me say that the
combination of costumes,
lighting, set and sound were
nearly-flawless.
The costumes, designed by
Corliss Nickerson, were splendid
and especially magnificent were
Edward's coronation gown, the
Bishop of Coventry's beautiful
purple-dominated robes and one
of Isabella's primarily green
gowns. Nickerson's job was
especially remarkable since a cast
of 22 people had to portray
nearly 90 characters and this
obviously necessitate an equal
number of varied costumes.
R. Craig Wolfs lighting
perfectly fit the outstandingly
authentic set which was designed
by Eric Warren. And Shawn
Murphy's sound design was much,
much more than background
music, as an incredibly intense
section of the second act will
demonstrate to anyone who sees
the production.
All too often, I think the
technical aspect of a production is
foolishly subjugated to the acting
end. But Rosenfield and technical
director Susie Farr obviously
realized the importance of making
the technical aspect an integral
part of this production and their
talented direction made that
combination very admirable. Go
see "Edward II" and learn some
important things about the 20th
century from a 16th century man
who wrote about the 14 th
century.

with excellent direction and
incredible technical work to make
"Edward II" one of the first
dramatic highlights of this young
year.
It is a cliche to point out that
the lasting value of good drama
comes from its "relevancy" to
different times and societies. Most
people who have seen even as few
as one good work by William
Shakespeare would tend to agree.
Marlowe's work is another very
obvious testimony to the ability
of good drama to outlive both its
author and the society in which it
was based.
This 16th century work
concerns the reign of Edward II
from 1307 to 1330. The story
begins with Edwards ascension to
the throne. Immediately the new
king displays his antagonism for
existing standards of royal
behavior by recalling his male
lover, Gaveston, who had been
exiled by his father for corrupting
young Edward.
Rehabilitiate the King
Many members of Edward's
court feel his behavior is very
threatening to the welfare of their
country and they want to again
"banish Gaveston, as a possible first
step in "rehabilitating" the king.
But Queen Isabella remains
faithful despite Edward's obvious
preference for Gaveston and she
convinces the opposition forces,
led by her lover, Mortimer, to
repeal Gaveston's banishment.
Gaveston's haughty presence
sparks predictable violence and a
bloody civil war soon begins.
Eventually Edward is stripped of
his crown and he follows his father
into the grave. Soon afterwards,
the new King Edward imprisons
his mother and has Mortimer, the
leader of the "rebels," killed. The
drama has completed its
360-degree revolution and 20+
years after his father had faced a
similar situation, the new King
Edward begins his reign with a
great possibility of future violence
and unrest.

The applicability to today's
political situation of many of the
questions Marlowe raises is
obvious almost from the
beeinnine of the play. Will a
political alternative which on
paper seems vastly preferable to
an existing system be as successful
in practice? Does political power
grow out of the point of a sword?
How are .iacred and secular law
and morality compatible or
incompatible? How do most
political figures weight personal
relationships and actions in terms
of their possible influence on a
public image?
Marlowe's Shrewdness
How shrewd it was of Marlowe
to emphasize the question of a
king's personal relationships and
their influence on his public image
and indirectly a whole country,
by making the king's lover be a
male.
These and many other
questions including deeply
philosophical ones about love,
death etc., are definitely
contained in Marlowe's work, but
it takes a strong production as the
Stanford one to make them
become apparent to the audience.
The cast was almost without
exception composed of quite
talented actors. In the first act
especially, a few actors' words
were a bit hard to understand, but
throughout the great majority of
the play, vocal delivery and
articulation was much more than
merely adequate.
There always exists a
temptation with works from
another period to try and recreate
the diction and accents of that
time, this can often create
numberous problems for many
actors. This cast seemed more
intent in clearly getting the all
important blank verse across to
the audience and their approach
worked well.
Leo Greene as the Bishop of
Coventry was particularly
noteworthy for his magnificently
powerful and stately vocal
delivery. W. B. Nodiff as Prince
Edward had a marvelous accent
and she carried off her majorspeech
at the end of the play with the
necessary combination of
precision and strength.
Moving to total acting
performances, Peter Silbert as
Edward II was very good in a
most difficult role. Silbert saved
his finest acting for the scene in
which he resigns his crown and his

performance at this crucial point
in the play was no less than
magnificent.
Carolyn Gillespie as Queen
Isabella made the only female role
in the play quite memorable as
she successfully executed the
difficult change from a nearly
blindly faithful wife to Edward to
a lover of his rival Mortimer.
Ron Vawter was cunning and
forceful as Mortimer and Roger
Kozol did a fine job as the very
dislikeable Gaveston. The
remainder of the cast was nearly
totally competent.
Very important to the
production's success was the
incredibly professional technical
work and expert coordination of
all facets of the production by
director Stephen Rosenfield.
To detail the technical
components which were such an
integral part of this production's
success would take an incredible
amount of space, but for brevity's
sake let me say that the
combination of costumes,
lighting, set and sound were
nearly-flawless.
The costumes, designed by
Corliss Nickerson, were splendid
and especially magnificent were
Edward's coronation gown, the
Bishop of Coventry's beautiful
purple-dominated robes and one
of Isabella's primarily green
gowns. Nickerson's job was
especially remarkable since a cast
of 22 people had to portray
nearly 90 characters and this
obviously necessitate an equal
number of varied costumes.
R. Craig Wolfs lighting
perfectly fit the outstandingly
authentic set which was designed
by Eric Warren. And Shawn
Murphy's sound design was much,
much more than background
music, as an incredibly intense
section of the second act will
demonstrate to anyone who sees
the production.
All too often, I think the
technical aspect of a production is
foolishly subjugated to the acting
end. But Rosenfield and technical
director Susie Farr obviously
realized the importance of making
the technical aspect an integral
part of this production and their
talented direction made that
combination very admirable. Go
see "Edward II" and learn some
important things about the 20th
century from a 16th century man
who wrote about the 14 th
century.
Long Elizabethean dramas with
their typically large casts and
complicated plots can often either
be very boring and tiring or very
exciting and moving. Fortunately,
the Stanford Drama Department's
current production of Christopher
Marlowe's "Edward II" is best
described by the latter adjectives.

Marlowe's work is another very
obvious testimony to the ability
of good drama to outlive both its
author and the society in which it
was based.
This 16th century work
concerns the reign of Edward II
from 1307 to 1330. The story
begins with Edwards ascension to
the throne. Immediately the new
king displays his antagonism for
existing standards of royal
behavior by recalling his male
lover, Gaveston, who had been
exiled by his father for corrupting
young Edward.
Rehabilitiate the King
Many members of Edward's
court feel his behavior is very
threatening to the welfare of their
country and they want to again
"banish Gaveston, as a possible first
step in "rehabilitating" the king.
But Queen Isabella remains
faithful despite Edward's obvious
preference for Gaveston and she
convinces the opposition forces,
led by her lover, Mortimer, to
repeal Gaveston's banishment.
Gaveston's haughty presence
sparks predictable violence and a
bloody civil war soon begins.
Eventually Edward is stripped of
his crown and he follows his father
into the grave. Soon afterwards,
the new King Edward imprisons
his mother and has Mortimer, the
leader of the "rebels," killed. The
drama has completed its
360-degree revolution and 20+
years after his father had faced a
similar situation, the new King
Edward begins his reign with a
great possibility of future violence
and unrest.

The applicability to today's
political situation of many of the
questions Marlowe raises is
obvious almost from the
beeinnine of the play. Will a
political alternative which on
paper seems vastly preferable to
an existing system be as successful
in practice? Does political power
grow out of the point of a sword?
How are .iacred and secular law
and morality compatible or
incompatible? How do most
political figures weight personal
relationships and actions in terms
of their possible influence on a
public image?
Marlowe's Shrewdness
How shrewd it was of Marlowe
to emphasize the question of a
king's personal relationships and
their influence on his public image
and indirectly a whole country,
by making the king's lover be a
male.
These and many other
questions including deeply
philosophical ones about love,
death etc., are definitely
contained in Marlowe's work, but
it takes a strong production as the
Stanford one to make them
become apparent to the audience.
The cast was almost without
exception composed of quite
talented actors. In the first act
especially, a few actors' words
were a bit hard to understand, but
throughout the great majority of
the play, vocal delivery and
articulation was much more than
merely adequate.
There always exists a
temptation with works from
another period to try and recreate
the diction and accents of that
time, this can often create
numberous problems for many
actors. This cast seemed more
intent in clearly getting the all
important blank verse across to
the audience and their approach
worked well.
Leo Greene as the Bishop of
Coventry was particularly
noteworthy for his magnificently
powerful and stately vocal
delivery. W. B. Nodiff as Prince
Edward had a marvelous accent
and she carried off her majorspeech
at the end of the play with the
necessary combination of
precision and strength.
Moving to total acting
performances, Peter Silbert as
Edward II was very good in a
most difficult role. Silbert saved
his finest acting for the scene in
which he resigns his crown and his

performance at this crucial point
in the play was no less than
magnificent.
Carolyn Gillespie as Queen
Isabella made the only female role
in the play quite memorable as
she successfully executed the
difficult change from a nearly
blindly faithful wife to Edward to
a lover of his rival Mortimer.
Ron Vawter was cunning and
forceful as Mortimer and Roger
Kozol did a fine job as the very
dislikeable Gaveston. The
remainder of the cast was nearly
totally competent.
Very important to the
production's success was the
incredibly professional technical
work and expert coordination of
all facets of the production by
director Stephen Rosenfield.
To detail the technical
components which were such an
integral part of this production's
success would take an incredible
amount of space, but for brevity's
sake let me say that the
combination of costumes,
lighting, set and sound were
nearly-flawless.
The costumes, designed by
Corliss Nickerson, were splendid
and especially magnificent were
Edward's coronation gown, the
Bishop of Coventry's beautiful
purple-dominated robes and one
of Isabella's primarily green
gowns. Nickerson's job was
especially remarkable since a cast
of 22 people had to portray
nearly 90 characters and this
obviously necessitate an equal
number of varied costumes.
R. Craig Wolfs lighting
perfectly fit the outstandingly
authentic set which was designed
by Eric Warren. And Shawn
Murphy's sound design was much,
much more than background
music, as an incredibly intense
section of the second act will
demonstrate to anyone who sees
the production.
All too often, I think the
technical aspect of a production is
foolishly subjugated to the acting
end. But Rosenfield and technical
director Susie Farr obviously
realized the importance of making
the technical aspect an integral
part of this production and their
talented direction made that
combination very admirable. Go
see "Edward II" and learn some
important things about the 20th
century from a 16th century man
who wrote about the 14 th
century.
Long Elizabethean dramas with
their typically large casts and
complicated plots can often either
be very boring and tiring or very
exciting and moving. Fortunately,
the Stanford Drama Department's
current production of Christopher
Marlowe's "Edward II" is best
described by the latter adjectives.
Basically strong acting
performances have been combined
with excellent direction and
incredible technical work to make
"Edward II" one of the first
dramatic highlights of this young
year.
It is a cliche to point out that
the lasting value of good drama
comes from its "relevancy" to
different times and societies. Most
people who have seen even as few
as one good work by William
Shakespeare would tend to agree.
