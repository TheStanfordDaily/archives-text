Dublin Embassy Burned
DUBLIN - Thousands of Irishmen stormed the
British Embassy and destroyed it with fire bombs
yesterday, a few hours after the victims of
Londonderry's Bloody Sunday were laid to rest in
Northern Ireland. The building was left a
smouldering shell.
The building had been evacuated and all valuable
records removed because of previous attacks
Monday and Tuesday. The British government
protested and demanded compensation. Embassy
sources estimated the damage at $234,000.
A fierce firefight between British troops and
guerrillas erupted and terrorist bombs blasted a path
of destruction through Belfast.
In London, Defense Minister Lord Carrington
pledged before the House of Lords that Britain
would make no concession to violence and terrorism
in Northern Ireland.
He said the British army would break up a civil
rights march planned for this weekend.
The Dublin demonstrators overwhelmed police
to reach the embassy and then physically blocked
fire engines coming to extinguish the blaze.
Davis Asks Reagan Testimony
SAN JOSE — Angela Davis told a court hearing
yesterday she would subpoena Gov. Ronald Reagan
to testify about his role in what she says is a state
conspiracy against her.
The 28-year-old black revolutionary also told
why she fled California after an Aug. 7, 1970
shootout at a San Rafael courthouse.
"I distrust the judicial system so much, so
thoroughly," she said, "that I left California not
because I was guilty but because I was innocent and

I feared the judicial system."
Davis spoke during pre-trial hearings as defense
attorneys sought a change in trial site and asked the
court to pay defense costs.
Outside the courthouse, sheriffs deputies
arrested six persons on charges of interfering with
court processes. On Monday 18 persons
demonstrating in Davis' support were arrested
on the same charge.
Davis told Superior Court Judge Richard E.
Arnason that the state is conspiring to oppress her,
blacks and the poor.
The prosecution opposed the defense moves and
also said that Davis' supporters are creating "an aura
of apprehension" in the case.
"If there were not this deliberate attempt to
bring deliberate pressure — people rounded up and
brought here and pumped full of emotional flavor —
security measures would not be what they are
today," said Albert Harris Jr., assistant state
attorney general.
Welfare Compromise Likely
WASHINGTON - The Nixon administration
indicated yesterday it has agreed to work out a
compromise of its controversial welfare reform plan
with Sen. Abraham A. Ribicoff, D-Conn., that will
involve a prior test of its key provision.
But a high administration source indicated the
compromise also would put the plan into effect
once the test has been completed.
Ribicoff told a reporter the compromise was
worked out in a long meeting Wednesday with Elliot
L. Richardson, secretary of health, education and
welfare, and John D. Ehrlichman, Nixon's top aide
on domestic affairs.
Ribicoff, a key figure in the Senate consideration

of the legislation, at first favored putting the entire
welfare reform plan into effect in the pending bill as
the House voted.
But last Friday he startled his colleagues and the
administration by announcing that he would
support only a pilot effort on a major element of
the Nixon plan-aid for the working poor.
Nixon Urges Dock Strike End
WASHINGTON — President Nixon urged the
Democratic-controlled Congress yesterday to get
moving on new laws to halt the long West Coast
dock strike and prevent such crippling walkouts in
all crucial transportation industries.
"The dock strike on the West Coast continues to
impose a cruel and intolerable burden upon the
American people," Nixon said.
Talks continued in San Francisco on the strike of
13,000 dock workers that has closed 24 ports in
California, Washington and Oregon.
The British Columbia Supreme Court yesterday
granted an injunction ordering Vancouver
longshoremen to resume handling cargo diverted
here from strikebound U.S. West Coast ports.
Sadat Visits Moscow Again
CAIRO — President Anwar Sadat of Egypt arrived
in Moscow vesterdav for military and political talks
with Kremlin leaders as Israel agreed to participate
in American-sponsored talks with Egypt on
reopening the Suez Canal.
During Sadat's visit to Moscow, his third in less
than a year, he was expected to appeal for
additional Soviet military support to force Israeli
troops from occupied Arab territory.
The Israeli decision was announced following a
special two-hour Cabinet session in Jerusalem.

DRAFTEE—Don Bunce was drafted yesterday by the Washington Redskins.
Many other male Stanford students learned their chances of being drafted by
another organization located in Washington, D.C. All in all, it was a very drafty
day.
