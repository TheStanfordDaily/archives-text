# Pro Football Drafts Brown, Bunce, Butler
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
The quality of Stanford's 1971
varsity football squad was reaffirmed
yesterday as three more seniors were
selected in the second and last series of
pro football draft rounds.
Running back Jackie Brown was
drafted in the eighth round by the
Oakland Raiders. Brown, who scored
Stanford's only touchdown in their
13-12 Rose Bowl victory' this year, is
undecided if he will play for the
Raiders. Said Brown, "If I play pro
football it will only be to achieve an
end. Law school takes priority."
Brown was thirteenth in total
rushing for the Pac-8 last season with
479 yards, and was Stanford's leading
ground gainer in this year's Rose Bowl,
rushing for 62 yards.
Quarterback Don Bunce, who was
voted most valuable player at this
year's Rose Bowl, was taken by the
Washington Redskins in the twelfth
round. Bunce said last night that he
was "disappointed in the way things
turned out."
The quarterback added that he
"didn't know why I was drafted when
I was and by the team I was. The
possibilities of doing other things are
getting greater and greater."
Bunce also said "I'd really like to
go to medical school or to go to
Canada and play football there while
going to medical school at the same

time." He explained that the Canadian
League's relatively infrequent practices
were attractive attributes.
Bunce's incredulity came in the
light of his outstanding performance
for Stanford during the 1971 season.
He led the Pac-8 in total offense with
2523 yards and in total passing
yardage with 2275. In the Rose Bowl,
the 6'l", 196 pound quarterback
completed 24 of 44 passes for 290
yards. He gained 24 yards rushing.
In the fourteenth round, UPI
All-American Dave Chaney, a San Jose
linebacker, was selected by the Kansas
City Chiefs. His teammate, defensive
back Eric Dahl, was drafted by the
New England Patriots in the sixteenth Â°
round.
Also in the sixteenth round, 6'2",
246 pound defensive guard Larry
Butler was selected by the Atlanta
Falcons. Butler was the third
Thunderchicken to be drafted by the
pros. Greg Sampson and Pete Lazetich
were chosen Tuesday by the Houston
Oilers and the San Diego Chargers,
respectively.
Also drafted Tuesday was
All-American linebacker Jeff Siemon,
who was selected by the Minnesota
Vikings. Most observers were surprised
that Bill Meyers, and Tim Schallich,
both offensive tackles, and Benny
Barnes, safety, were not drafted.
