# Grad Student Files Federal Suit To Ban Chemical Additive Use
## 
### JANE BUSSEY 
The question of whether the
evaluation of the safety of chemical
additives should remain the private
property of its sponsor and the
government is approaching a court
battle.
Stanford graduate student in
genetics Dale B. Hattis and the
Environmental Defense Fund (EDF)
of Berkeley are suing the federal
government to get the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to release
information on food preservatives the
agency claims constitute "commercial
property."
The suit is scheduled to be filed
today in US District Court.
Sodium Nitrite
The food additive in question is
sodium nitrite, commonly found as a
preservative and color fixative in
salami, hot dogs, and cold cuts.
But the issue is not sodium nitrite.
"Yeah, this is politics, of course it's
politics," said Hattis, who worked in
Washington one summer for consumer
advocate Ralph Nader. "We picked
this particular one as an example of
the general pattern."
"I think that scientists have to be
political scientists as well," explained

Hattis of his connection with the
ecology battle.
He says that the FDA requires
private companies to submit proof
that a food additive is safe. The agency
then controls public review of their
policies by "use of secrecy."
Immune
"The federal bureaucracy is so large
and powerful by this point that it is
essentially immune to checks and
balances," Hattis said. The suit would
presumably provide a balance to the
"regulatory-industrial complex which
develops anywhere there is a
regulatory system."
The close connection between the
FDA and chemical industries,
evidenced by the latter's lobbying and
the exchange of jobs between the two,
causes some environmentalists to
suspect sloppiness in the scientific
research of the watchdog agency.
The proof which these special
interests supply for tolerance levels for
food additives might not hold up
under closer scientific scrutingy, Hattis
believes.
Hattis believes there is sufficient
evidence to support further
investigation.
First doubts about the safety of
sodium nitrite came in 1960, when
fish meal preserved in nitrite was
blamed for the illness and deaths in

numerous sheep in Norway.
The deaths, attributed to severe
liver damage, presented the possibility
that sodium nitrite may combine with
other food elements to form
nitrosamines. Nitrosamine compounds
have been established as
cancer-producing and mutagenic
secondary products, and were found in
the sheeps' livers, in this case.
Examine Data
Hattis requested the sodium nitrite
data to examine "what tests they have
done on nitrites to justify adding them
to food."
He requested the data to review the
justification for adding it to food.
Re-evaluation is particularly pertinent
because the tests occurred before the
question of carcinogenicity became
prominent.
When Hattis requested the petitions
establishing the safety of sodium
nitrite from Morton Salt Co. and Tuna
Products Corp. in July 1970, the FDA
didn't answer until June 1971.
In December 1971, the FDA
refused to disclose the research to
Hattis because "toxicological and
other technical information is valuable
commercial property that is regarded
as confidential information."
Hattis was joined in his efforts by
the EDF, a non-profit corporation
with a staff of lawyers and scientists

dedicated to preserving the
environment.
Lederberg
Dr. Joshua Lederberg, Stanford
Nobel prize winning geneticist,
submitted a statement in Hattis' behalf
urging that litigation "be expedited
wherever possible."
Lederberg stated that scientists
must be allowed access to evaluations
of environmental chemicals in order to
continuously review them. Otherwise
unsuspected accidents like thalidomide
disasters (where a sleeping drug caused
numerous birth deformities) will
reoccur.
Hattis is optimistic about the
outcome of this litigation and thinks
"that they'll rule that we're right."
But he admits that, "If the FDA really
wants to be a bastard about it they
may just give up that one | study) and
say, 'OK, sue us for the other 250!"
Ecology suits are closely connected
with political power, Hattis thinks.
"It's a continuing thing. You've got to
be a pro about it, because they're
pros."
But he says that scientists have an
edge over federal bureaucracy.
Bureacratic agencies can be viewed as
micro-environments, "with these
people as defending their ecological
niches. It's good to know the nature of
the beast so you can control it."
