## Prison Shuttle-'Help Because People Need It' 
### GARY ATKINS (Second of two parts) 
The road to La Honda prison camp is a
narrow excuse for a highway, more a winding
series of patches than a road, but Sharon
Winslow knows it well.
Almost every Sunday for the past five
months, she has driven down the road,
carrying wives and mothers into the camp to
visit their men. She says she's working for a
revolution.
Winslow is a slim girl, a junior in political
science at Stanford. She's also a member of a
local Black Panther auxiliary, the
Intercommunal Survival Committee to
Combat Fascism (ISCCF), formed here six
months ago. The group is now operating a
number of "survival programs," such as
Winslow's prison shuttle, throughout Santa
Clara and San Mateo counties. The idea,
according to the Panthers is to bring people to
a "revolutionary consciousness" by serving
them and having them participate in
community programs.
"Although the war makes you a radical and
seeing a lot of oppression makes you a
radical," she says, "you still have to set a
revolutionary example. Otherwise, you get
stuck in dogmatism. You get together with

other people and sit back and read your Marx
and Lenin and talk about organizing the
industrial proletariat — I mean, if you want to
do that, that's cool, but I couldn't see it. You
just end up in ideological debates and nobody
goes out to serve the people, which is where
we (in the ISCCF) started from, what we all
wanted to do."
What Winslow does now is drive — to
Soledad, to San Quentin, but mainly to La
Honda. The camp, a minimum security
facility run by San Mateo County, is not a bad
prison in the California sense of the term. It's
an honor camp, for punishing misdemeanors
and minor felonies, where an inmate can
seriously say, "if a person has to do some
time, this is the place to do it."
Every Sunday, the camp allows four hours
of "contact visiting," which is to say that
prisoners and their relatives can visit under
redwood trees or in the camp cafeteria.
Inaccessible
But the problem with La Honda is that,
even with the liberal visiting rules, many of
the prisoners' families cannot get to the camp,
isolated as it is in the coast hills on the other
side of the Santa Cruz mountains.
The camp's parking lot on visiting day tells
the storv best, for it is a lot where shiny new

Mercuries and Mercedes often mean parents
visiting a son busted for drugs, while
Winslow's old white van means a family, too
poor to afford its own transportation, is
visiting a father arrested for welfare fraud.
On a recent Sunday, two ISCCF drivers
carried 14 people to the camp, most of whom
would not have been able to have seen their
husband, brother, or father without the
Panther program. . ,
But Winslow's prison shuttle is not just a
conventional community service program:
there's a little "political education" involved
as well.
"What we're trying to do is get people
organized, get people to a new perspective, a
radical perspective, because that's where we're
coming from."
Usually it's done just by talking to the
people and explaining to them that the Black
Panthers no longer hold to that stereotype of
guns and violence. It's all a matter of helping
people and making sure they know where the
help comes from.
Dorothy Yuzan, who visits her husband
Rick in La Honda is a case in point. Yuzan has
been one of Winslow's regular passengers for
the past several months, every Sunday
bringing four of her five children up to La

Honda to visit their father.
Rick Yuzan used to be a bartender until he
lost his job and had to go on welfare. While he
was looking for a new job, he spent welfare
money intended for a car on clothes for his
five children.
Now Rick is in La Honda for welfare fraud
and Dorothy, also unemployed, not only has
to support her family on the money she gets
from welfare, but must repay the money
spent for clothes as well.
And that's made her do some thinking —
about "little people" and "how easily they
can get railroaded," about the way social
workers treat people on welfare, about the
way the Black Panthers have helped her and
her family through their prison shuttle.
"Before I started riding up here," she says,
"I used to think the Black Panthers were just
a bunch of people who didn't want to get off
their asses. I thought they wanted everyone to
give them something.
"But when you get in a hole and you find
out that these are the people giving you
something and asking for nothing in
return . .."
Taking Time
One of the nice things about the ISCCF
drivers, she savs, is that "here these kids are

taking a lot of time to do things while the
older people — who have the money to do
things — don't care and live in their own little
world."
She also likes the fact that ISCCF workers
do not make her fill out a lot of forms and
papers, as at the county welfare office.
"With Sharon, all they know is that here's
somebody who needs help, so let's help," she
says. "They don't have to know why you
need help, or what you want to do, or why
your husband's in jail, or why you want to
visit him . . .
"It's like if you see a little child on the
street on a cold day and he doesn't have a
coat on, you give him a coat. You don't worry
about why he doesn't have a coat, whether he
doesn't have it because his mother's drinking
or doesn't care — you just give the little kid a
coat."
So Dorothy has been converted, and so, to
a certain extent, has Rick. He does not quite
go to Dorothy's extent — she says she does
not believe society works any more — but
when he speaks about the Black Panthers, and
especially about Winslow and her prison
shuttle, he sums up his feelings in a very few
words: "They're human beings, that's what it
is."
