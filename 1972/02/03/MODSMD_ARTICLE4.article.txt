# not always a defense
## Double-Jeopardy Complex 
### 
John kaplan

Inasmuch as this is the first official motion filed
before me in my capacity as Chairman of the
Stanford Judicial Panel, a decent respect for the
Stanford community requires that I set down in
public my decision and the reasons for it.
The charge filed against Mr. R~, a student,
before the Campus Judicial Panel, is one of assault,
which, together with other charges is scheduled for
hearing by a hearing officer in the near future. Mr.
R— pleads double jeopardy claiming that he
cannot bo properly tried before the Campus Judicial
Panel for this assault on the grounds that he has
already been tried and convicted and sentenced for
this same alleged assault in the Palo Alto Municipal
Court.
The issue of double jeopardy has excited a great
deal of controversy on the campus. Apparently, a
large percentage of the Student Senate has taken the
view that a fundamental student right is to be
immune from campus discipline il one has been
convicted in the civil courts of an offense based on
the same facts.
Unless double jeopardy means something
different for student and faculty, this type of
conflict (and, of course, these are not the only
possible positions) must be resolved.
Since the defendant claims a right based on
double jeopardy not to undergo any hearing on this
charge, it is essential that at this point 1 take the
prosecution's allegations concerning the offense as
correct. Of course, should they be found not
substantiated, that will end the matter.
The question then before me (and my decision
will be reviewed by the full membership of the
Judicial Panel at a later time before any penalty can
be assessed) is whether the fact that a Stanford
student has been criminally prosecuted and
convicted in the criminal courts of an assault upon
another student on the campus must in all cases
immunize him from University discipline for the
same action.
1 could deny this motion simply on the ground
that its answer is implied in Rule 21 of the
Procedures for the Adjudication of Student
Disciplinary Cases laid down by the President in
accordance with Article 4 of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter. That rule provides merely that
should penalties have been assessed against the
student in a State or Federal court, the panel 'shall
recommend such additional sanctions if any which
it believes necessary to protect the persons,
property and function of the University."'

On much broader grounds, however, the fact is
that our entire legal system is pervaded with the
notion that separate interests of individuals, groups
or governments may be protected in separate
proceedings. The most dramatic demonstration of
this, 1 suppose, in our society is what might occur to
one salesman who became drunk and injured
someone while driving. He could be prosecuted in
the criminal courts for drunken driving.
However, no one would argue that his conviction
would prevent the Division of Motor Vehicles from
revoking or suspending his license. (Indeed, in some
states this is mandatory). Nor could one maintain
that someone injured by his driving could not sue in
the civil courts for his damages despite a defense of
double jeopardy.
One can prolong the hypothetical at some length.
It is possible to imagine that his employer might
discharge him for his conduct (especially if he were
driving on company business) and that this might be
supported by an arbitration; that if he were a
practicing member of a church which forbade
drinking, he might be excommunicated; and,
indeed, that if his wife were a member of the
WCTU, she might bring a successful divorce suit
based on his action.
Mr. R—, however, seems to argue that the
punishment he received from the court for his
assault—three years probation- is so serious that in
fact no decision by the Campus Judicial Panel
imposing any extra sanction would be justified
under Rule 21.
There are several problems with this reasoning,
however. First of all, we have yet to hear any of the
facts surrounding the alleged assault. It may be that
the argument of Mr. R— is correct, but this is for
the Panel to decide after a full and complete hearing
on the facts.
At this time, it cannot be concluded that the
judge decided in this case that three years probation
was the total amount of punishment for the
defendant from any source and that no other person
or group could vindicate its own interests.
Secondly, under the defendant's double jeopardy
argument, the more serious the crime of which he
was accused—and hence the greater likelihood of
criminal prosecution—the less the University
community could have to say about his
behavior regardless of whether or not he were felt
to be physically dangerous.

charge, it is essential that at this point 1 take the
prosecution's allegations concerning the offense as
correct. Of course, should they be found not
substantiated, that will end the matter.
The question then before me (and my decision
will be reviewed by the full membership of the
Judicial Panel at a later time before any penalty can
be assessed) is whether the fact that a Stanford
student has been criminally prosecuted and
convicted in the criminal courts of an assault upon
another student on the campus must in all cases
immunize him from University discipline for the
same action.
1 could deny this motion simply on the ground
that its answer is implied in Rule 21 of the
Procedures for the Adjudication of Student
Disciplinary Cases laid down by the President in
accordance with Article 4 of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter. That rule provides merely that
should penalties have been assessed against the
student in a State or Federal court, the panel 'shall
recommend such additional sanctions if any which
it believes necessary to protect the persons,
property and function of the University."'

On much broader grounds, however, the fact is
that our entire legal system is pervaded with the
notion that separate interests of individuals, groups
or governments may be protected in separate
proceedings. The most dramatic demonstration of
this, 1 suppose, in our society is what might occur to
one salesman who became drunk and injured
someone while driving. He could be prosecuted in
the criminal courts for drunken driving.
However, no one would argue that his conviction
would prevent the Division of Motor Vehicles from
revoking or suspending his license. (Indeed, in some
states this is mandatory). Nor could one maintain
that someone injured by his driving could not sue in
the civil courts for his damages despite a defense of
double jeopardy.
One can prolong the hypothetical at some length.
It is possible to imagine that his employer might
discharge him for his conduct (especially if he were
driving on company business) and that this might be
supported by an arbitration; that if he were a
practicing member of a church which forbade
drinking, he might be excommunicated; and,
indeed, that if his wife were a member of the
WCTU, she might bring a successful divorce suit
based on his action.
Mr. R—, however, seems to argue that the
punishment he received from the court for his
assault—three years probation- is so serious that in
fact no decision by the Campus Judicial Panel
imposing any extra sanction would be justified
under Rule 21.
There are several problems with this reasoning,
however. First of all, we have yet to hear any of the
facts surrounding the alleged assault. It may be that
the argument of Mr. R— is correct, but this is for
the Panel to decide after a full and complete hearing
on the facts.
At this time, it cannot be concluded that the
judge decided in this case that three years probation
was the total amount of punishment for the
defendant from any source and that no other person
or group could vindicate its own interests.
Secondly, under the defendant's double jeopardy
argument, the more serious the crime of which he
was accused—and hence the greater likelihood of
criminal prosecution—the less the University
community could have to say about his
behavior regardless of whether or not he were felt
to be physically dangerous.

Inasmuch as this is the first official motion filed
before me in my capacity as Chairman of the
Stanford Judicial Panel, a decent respect for the
Stanford community requires that I set down in
public my decision and the reasons for it.
The charge filed against Mr. R~, a student,
before the Campus Judicial Panel, is one of assault,
which, together with other charges is scheduled for
hearing by a hearing officer in the near future. Mr.
R— pleads double jeopardy claiming that he
cannot bo properly tried before the Campus Judicial
Panel for this assault on the grounds that he has
already been tried and convicted and sentenced for
this same alleged assault in the Palo Alto Municipal
Court.
The issue of double jeopardy has excited a great
deal of controversy on the campus. Apparently, a
large percentage of the Student Senate has taken the
view that a fundamental student right is to be
immune from campus discipline il one has been
convicted in the civil courts of an offense based on
the same facts.
Unless double jeopardy means something
different for student and faculty, this type of
conflict (and, of course, these are not the only
possible positions) must be resolved.
Since the defendant claims a right based on
