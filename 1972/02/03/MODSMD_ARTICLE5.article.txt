The case of the Stanford
Maoist firebrand professor, H.
Bruce Franklin, is another
example of the legal aphorism
that the weakest part of any civil
liberties case is apt to be the guy
who it's about—whether he be
plaintiff or defendant. The thorny

defendant is part of our culture,
from John Brown to the atheist
lady Madalyn Murray O'Hair. He
is such a bastard, in i,he view of
the community, that wo are
blinded to the fact that what lie
stands for is something
indispensable to us all—the rignt
of free speech under our system
of law. The Constitution is at its
most explicit here: There shall be
NO abridgement of freedom to
speak.
The right of free speech is not
tested until we must award it to
someone we hate. Nice guys do
not ordinarily press civil rights
claims. The nice guy's instinct is
never to press any claim, even
when he is clearly hurt.
The 37-year-old professor and
his wife sure qualify as thorny
cats. At a press conference in Palo
Alto after an investigative board
had found him guilty of
something-just what remains
unclear- Jane Franklin wore a
black dress and an unloaded M-L
carbine. She was not smiling. Her
husband, clearly loving every
minute of it, advocated violence
on the campus.

When a reporter, Kenneth
Lamott, later asked Franklin if

he meant it, the young teacher
said, "Sure. I don't think anything
would be going too far. I certainly
don't think the people on the
advisory board should be iliuwed
to keep teaching their classes."
Although this is just talk, it's
pictty strong stuff for Palo Alto,
which Is probably the most
conventual coilooe campus outside
organized religion. Th nr e's East
Palo Alto, to be sure, but in
Stanford you see standard
scrubbed WASPS, and tweedy
pipe smoking profs. Stanford is
still what the Ivy League and
Oxbridge used to be: A retreat for
the learned and the learning, with
the outside world, and especially
its pressing concerns, held firmly
at bay.
There is good argument for the
thesis that Palo Alto is the sanest
community in this country, that it
represents an ideal to which all
others could strive. Stanford was
a bastion of academic freedom
and free speech—until her own ox
was gored. In the struggle which
ended with Franklin's firing, it is
clear to me that Stanford—and
Palo Alto, which was very much
into the matters-lost, and
Franklin won. What Franklin won
was a propaganda victory, which
was what he sought.

What Stanford betrayed was
the First Amendment and the
memorable defense of it in Justice
Holmes' opinion in the 1919
Abrams case:
"I think we should be eternally
vigilant against attempts to check
the expression of opinions that we
loathe and believe to be fraught
with death, unless they so
imminently threaten immediate
interference with the lawful and
pressing purposes of the law that
an immediate check is required to
save the country ..." Holmes
added he regretted he could not
put his belief in free speech and
ideas for the defendants "into
more impressive words."

Nobody really thinks Brother
Franklin endangers the country,
or Palo Alto, or the university.
When h'j becomes violent, rather
than when he talks violence, he
loses the protection of the First
Amendment and rightly. We have
laws for that sort of thing, as the
man says.
One of the review board who
kept his head was theologian
Robert McAfee Brown, who
admitted disagreement with much
of what Franklin says and how he
says it; but nonetheless added,
" . ..1 fear we may do untold
harm to ourselves and the cause of
higher education unless, by
imposing a penalty short of
dismissal, we seek to keep him as
a very uncomfortable but very
important part of what this
university or any university is
meant to be."
