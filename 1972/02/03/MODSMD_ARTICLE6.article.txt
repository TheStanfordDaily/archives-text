Editor, THE DAILY:
1 have disagreed with Daily
rock concert reviews before, but
never have 1 seen one that I
thought was as totally wrong as
Barry Wood's review of Saturday's
old Pavilion Concert. It seems
that "professionalism" is more
important to him than good
music.
I can't imagine how he could
call The Great Nameless
Wonderband "unspirited and
uninspired." They played a great
set consisting mostly of their own
material, which I find lifting and
exhilierating—along the vibes I get
from the Grateful Dead. To me,
the music they put out Saturday
night was a lot more real and
honest than Cold Blood's slick
"plastic/fantastic" style.
Were you listening or just
watching, Barry? Maybe you
didn't dig them because the light
show wasn't together during their
act, or because they didn't exactly
have a dazzling stage presence or
foxy lead singer or something.
But they're really good
musicians, I think, and are
"unprofessional" enough to do
free gigs every so often, just
because they like to play. (As
evidenced Friday afternoon at the
coffee-house and again at Toyon
Friday night).
Somehow, I can't believe that
the majority of the audience
didn't like this band. They may
not have much polish, but they
make damn good music.
And apart from the
Wonderband, it amazes me that
anyone could call Blue Mountain's
performance that night "sad."
What do you want man? The
"competition" between the

guitarists, vocalists and horn
section which Barry finds so
annoying, was one of the factors
that made their music so
fantastic!
Rather than detracting from
the music the interaction between
musicians pulled them up higher
and higher as their performance
went on. The encore at the end
was brought on by a lot of
howling from an appreciative
audience. A "sad" performance,
indeed?
How could Mr. Wood claim
that Blue Mountain "represents
the worst in hard rock" because
they were so loud, when it was
obvious that both Stoneground
and Cold Blood were much
louder? (My ears were ringing all
day Sunday from Cold Blood's
blaring horns).
I agree that Stoneground was
fantastic, but why the big rave for
Cold Blood? Sure Lydia Pense
sounds like Janis—but I for one
find it very difficult to believe
that her singing really reflects her
experience, whereas with Janis
you knew it was real.
Moreover, praising Cold
Blood's horn section, which to me
was uniformly uninspired and
overly loud, and panning Blue
Mountain's horns, which were for
the most part creative and
exciting, just my mind.
For me, Cold Blood's smooth,
professional, practiced
performance (that is essentially
the same as it was last year) didn't
do nearly as much as The Great
Nameless Wonderband and Blue
Mountain. I hope those two
groups do many more gigs in this
area, and I think a lot of other
people would dig it too.

In reference to the letter in the
January 27 Daily regarding
gynecology services at Cowell, a
few words of explanation may be
useful and help clear up any
misconceptions. All the physicians
at Cowell (10) provide ordinary
gynecological care, and patients
are seen the same day on a walk-in
basis as with other sorts of
problems and illness.
When a consultation
specifically with a gynecologist is
necessary, usually for a more
complicated or special problem,
such a physician is available at

Cowell, and also, when necessary,
on referral from the Health
Service, at the Palo Alto Medical
Clinic. For non-urgent or elective
cases, the appointment with the
gynecologist can usually be made
within 1 or 2 weeks, or less. For
truly urgent or emergency cases
the gynecologist is available
within minutes to hours as is
appropriate.

I enjoyed reading Professor E.
Shaw's letter to the Daily,
especially his conclusion on the
universality of his economic
science. The readers of the Daily
might be interested to know that
Professor E. Shaw has also been
an adviser to the repressive
governments of several U.S.
colonies in Asia and Latin
America. Also, he once attempted
to give advice to the Government
of Ghana which rejected his
"economic science" as being
definitely in favor of international
capital and against the masses of
the country.
In fact, Ghanaian officials had
to be a little less than polite in
order to get rid of Professor Shaw.
Weren't Professor Shaw close
toretirement, it could be
worthwhile for Stanford to follow
African example.

Whereas the creation of the
CJP and its subsequent use for the
prosecution of students is in
violation of the ASSU
constitution, previous resolutions
by the Student Senate, and a
referendum by the student body,
Whereas those being brought to
trial for occupation of the
Placement Center were active in
accordance with a student
referendum which sought to
restrict war-related recruiting on
campus,
Whereas the ASSU Council of
Presidents sponsored and
supported this action in
accordance with the above
mentioned referendum,
Whereas the administration has
again shown its willingness to use
arbitrary powers in lieu of
negotiation and counciliation in
dealing with the student body,
The Student Senate resolves

that the present prosecution
conducted by the administration
are unjust, without legal basis and
designed to promote further
turmoil on this campus and that
all concerned students should
attempt to rectify these
injustices by demonstrating
support for the defendants
through their presence at the
trials, and by any other effective
means, and by the combined
implementation of the student
referendum.
This resolution was passed in a
Student Senate Meeting on
January 27, 1972. However, only
a small part of it was reported in
the Daily, and considering the
importance of it, I thought the
whole resolution should appear in
full context.
1 would urge all students to
carefully weigh and appreciate
the will of the Senate concerning
this resolution.
James Jefferson, Jr.
Chairman, ASSU Senate
Editor, THE DAILY:
A basic problem, common to a
great many members of the
Stanford community, has arisen in
recent years with the emergence
of radicalism and now seems ever
apparent in the actions which are
now focusing upon the firing of
Bruce Franklin. That problem, as
it appears now, is the
indiscriminate use of terminology
within the radical movement. The
prime case in point is that of the
general movement which calls its
followers The People. Human
beings in a society, regardless of
their individual political
viewpoints, are people. When in
the course of events, as has
happened here, a small minority
has emerged calling itself by that
name, I wonder how long personal
and individual freedom are to
remain.
In that respect America at
present is populated by
oppressed people—oppressed in
that irresponsible radical groups
are acting in their name and mine.
The constant vomiting of left
wing propaganda makes one
constantly aware that one cannot
be a "people" without following
the party line. And when violence
and curtailment of individual
rights occurs because the party
wishes to substitute its moralities
in place of reason, and this
becomes the party line, I cannot
accept responsibility for The
People. How crude it is to see
beautiful words such as people,
society, and freedom lose their
meaning. No, cal! them something
else, but not people: we as society
are "The People", no one else.

A fact which the University
refuses to accept is that despite
the relatively few number of

Native American professors in this
country, there are hundreds of
people who not only teach
courses, but also can set up a
Native American Studies Program.
These people are native
Americans, people who I feel are
experts in the field. Mr. Baehetti's
view, as stated in the Daily, of
opposition to the mascot is
invalid. The administration should
clearly state, "We don't want it or
we don't want to finance it."
Since there are no follow-up
programs for Native American
students, it is obvious this
University has no idea of what the
Native American student needs.
The University has to open its

eyes to see who can best help the
Native American student.

A basic problem, common to a
great many members of the
Stanford community, has arisen in
recent years with the emergence
of radicalism and now seems ever
apparent in the actions which are
now focusing upon the firing of
Bruce Franklin. That problem, as
it appears now, is the
indiscriminate use of terminology
within the radical movement. The
prime case in point is that of the
general movement which calls its
followers The People. Human
beings in a society, regardless of
their individual political
viewpoints, are people. When in
the course of events, as has
happened here, a small minority
has emerged calling itself by that
name, I wonder how long personal
and individual freedom are to
remain.
In that respect America at
present is populated by
oppressed people—oppressed in
that irresponsible radical groups
are acting in their name and mine.
The constant vomiting of left
wing propaganda makes one
constantly aware that one cannot
be a "people" without following
the party line. And when violence
and curtailment of individual
rights occurs because the party
wishes to substitute its moralities
in place of reason, and this
becomes the party line, I cannot
accept responsibility for The
People. How crude it is to see
beautiful words such as people,
society, and freedom lose their

A fact which the University
refuses to accept is that despite
the relatively few number of

Native American professors in this
country, there are hundreds of
people who not only teach
courses, but also can set up a
Native American Studies Program.
These people are native
Americans, people who I feel are
experts in the field. Mr. Baehetti's
view, as stated in the Daily, of
opposition to the mascot is
invalid. The administration should

1 have disagreed with Daily
rock concert reviews before, but
never have 1 seen one that I
thought was as totally wrong as
Barry Wood's review of Saturday's
old Pavilion Concert. It seems
that "professionalism" is more
important to him than good
music.
I can't imagine how he could
call The Great Nameless
Wonderband "unspirited and
uninspired." They played a great
set consisting mostly of their own
material, which I find lifting and
exhilierating—along the vibes I get
from the Grateful Dead. To me,
the music they put out Saturday
night was a lot more real and
honest than Cold Blood's slick
"plastic/fantastic" style.
Were you listening or just
watching, Barry? Maybe you
didn't dig them because the light
show wasn't together during their
act, or because they didn't exactly
have a dazzling stage presence or
foxy lead singer or something.
But they're really good
musicians, I think, and are
"unprofessional" enough to do
free gigs every so often, just
because they like to play. (As
evidenced Friday afternoon at the
coffee-house and again at Toyon
Friday night).
Somehow, I can't believe that
the majority of the audience
didn't like this band. They may
not have much polish, but they
make damn good music.
And apart from the
Wonderband, it amazes me that
anyone could call Blue Mountain's
performance that night "sad."
What do you want man? The
"competition" between the

guitarists, vocalists and horn
section which Barry finds so
annoying, was one of the factors
that made their music so
fantastic!
Rather than detracting from
the music the interaction between
musicians pulled them up higher
and higher as their performance
went on. The encore at the end
was brought on by a lot of
howling from an appreciative
audience. A "sad" performance,
indeed?
How could Mr. Wood claim
that Blue Mountain "represents
the worst in hard rock" because
they were so loud, when it was
obvious that both Stoneground
and Cold Blood were much
louder? (My ears were ringing all
day Sunday from Cold Blood's
blaring horns).
I agree that Stoneground was
fantastic, but why the big rave for
Cold Blood? Sure Lydia Pense

find it very difficult to believe

Moreover, praising Cold
Blood's horn section, which to me
was uniformly uninspired and
overly loud, and panning Blue
Mountain's horns, which were for
the most part creative and
exciting, just my mind.
For me, Cold Blood's smooth,
professional, practiced
performance (that is essentially
the same as it was last year) didn't
do nearly as much as The Great
Nameless Wonderband and Blue
Mountain. I hope those two
groups do many more gigs in this
area, and I think a lot of other
people would dig it too.

In reference to the letter in the
January 27 Daily regarding
gynecology services at Cowell, a
few words of explanation may be
useful and help clear up any
misconceptions. All the physicians
at Cowell (10) provide ordinary
gynecological care, and patients
are seen the same day on a walk-in
basis as with other sorts of
problems and illness.
When a consultation
specifically with a gynecologist is
necessary, usually for a more
complicated or special problem,
such a physician is available at

Cowell, and also, when necessary,
on referral from the Health
Service, at the Palo Alto Medical
Clinic. For non-urgent or elective
cases, the appointment with the
gynecologist can usually be made
within 1 or 2 weeks, or less. For
truly urgent or emergency cases
the gynecologist is available
within minutes to hours as is
appropriate.

A basic problem, common to a

recent years with the emergence
of radicalism and now seems ever

it appears now, is the
indiscriminate use of terminology
within the radical movement. The
prime case in point is that of the
general movement which calls its
followers The People. Human
beings in a society, regardless of
their individual political
viewpoints, are people. When in
the course of events, as has
happened here, a small minority
has emerged calling itself by that

remain.
In that respect America at
present is populated by
oppressed people—oppressed in
that irresponsible radical groups

The constant vomiting of left

1 have disagreed with Daily
rock concert reviews before, but
never have 1 seen one that I
thought was as totally wrong as
Barry Wood's review of Saturday's
old Pavilion Concert. It seems
that "professionalism" is more
important to him than good
music.
I can't imagine how he could
call The Great Nameless
Wonderband "unspirited and
uninspired." They played a great
set consisting mostly of their own
material, which I find lifting and
exhilierating—along the vibes I get
from the Grateful Dead. To me,
the music they put out Saturday
night was a lot more real and
honest than Cold Blood's slick
"plastic/fantastic" style.
Were you listening or just
watching, Barry? Maybe you
didn't dig them because the light
show wasn't together during their
act, or because they didn't exactly
have a dazzling stage presence or
foxy lead singer or something.
But they're really good
musicians, I think, and are
"unprofessional" enough to do
free gigs every so often, just
because they like to play. (As
evidenced Friday afternoon at the
coffee-house and again at Toyon
Friday night).
Somehow, I can't believe that
the majority of the audience
didn't like this band. They may
not have much polish, but they
make damn good music.
And apart from the
Wonderband, it amazes me that
anyone could call Blue Mountain's
performance that night "sad."
What do you want man? The
"competition" between the

guitarists, vocalists and horn
section which Barry finds so
annoying, was one of the factors
that made their music so
fantastic!
Rather than detracting from
the music the interaction between
musicians pulled them up higher
and higher as their performance
went on. The encore at the end
was brought on by a lot of
howling from an appreciative
audience. A "sad" performance,
indeed?
How could Mr. Wood claim
that Blue Mountain "represents
the worst in hard rock" because
they were so loud, when it was
obvious that both Stoneground
and Cold Blood were much
louder? (My ears were ringing all
day Sunday from Cold Blood's
blaring horns).
I agree that Stoneground was
fantastic, but why the big rave for
Cold Blood? Sure Lydia Pense
sounds like Janis—but I for one
find it very difficult to believe
that her singing really reflects her
experience, whereas with Janis
you knew it was real.
Moreover, praising Cold
Blood's horn section, which to me
was uniformly uninspired and
overly loud, and panning Blue
Mountain's horns, which were for
the most part creative and
exciting, just my mind.
For me, Cold Blood's smooth,

The University has to open its

1 have disagreed with Daily
rock concert reviews before, but
never have 1 seen one that I
thought was as totally wrong as
Barry Wood's review of Saturday's
old Pavilion Concert. It seems
that "professionalism" is more
important to him than good
music.
I can't imagine how he could
call The Great Nameless
Wonderband "unspirited and
uninspired." They played a great
set consisting mostly of their own
material, which I find lifting and
exhilierating—along the vibes I get
from the Grateful Dead. To me,
the music they put out Saturday
night was a lot more real and
honest than Cold Blood's slick
"plastic/fantastic" style.
Were you listening or just
watching, Barry? Maybe you
didn't dig them because the light
show wasn't together during their
act, or because they didn't exactly
have a dazzling stage presence or
foxy lead singer or something.
But they're really good
musicians, I think, and are
"unprofessional" enough to do
free gigs every so often, just
because they like to play. (As
evidenced Friday afternoon at the
coffee-house and again at Toyon
Friday night).
Somehow, I can't believe that
the majority of the audience
didn't like this band. They may
not have much polish, but they
make damn good music.
And apart from the
Wonderband, it amazes me that
anyone could call Blue Mountain's
performance that night "sad."
What do you want man? The
"competition" between the

guitarists, vocalists and horn
section which Barry finds so
annoying, was one of the factors
that made their music so
fantastic!
Rather than detracting from
the music the interaction between
musicians pulled them up higher
and higher as their performance
went on. The encore at the end
was brought on by a lot of
howling from an appreciative
audience. A "sad" performance,
indeed?
How could Mr. Wood claim
that Blue Mountain "represents
the worst in hard rock" because
they were so loud, when it was
obvious that both Stoneground
and Cold Blood were much
louder? (My ears were ringing all
day Sunday from Cold Blood's
blaring horns).
I agree that Stoneground was
fantastic, but why the big rave for
Cold Blood? Sure Lydia Pense
sounds like Janis—but I for one
find it very difficult to believe
that her singing really reflects her
experience, whereas with Janis
you knew it was real.
Moreover, praising Cold
Blood's horn section, which to me
was uniformly uninspired and
overly loud, and panning Blue
Mountain's horns, which were for
the most part creative and
exciting, just my mind.
For me, Cold Blood's smooth,
professional, practiced
performance (that is essentially
the same as it was last year) didn't
do nearly as much as The Great
Nameless Wonderband and Blue
Mountain. I hope those two
groups do many more gigs in this
area, and I think a lot of other
people would dig it too.

In reference to the letter in the
January 27 Daily regarding
gynecology services at Cowell, a
few words of explanation may be
useful and help clear up any
misconceptions. All the physicians
at Cowell (10) provide ordinary
gynecological care, and patients
are seen the same day on a walk-in
basis as with other sorts of
problems and illness.
When a consultation
specifically with a gynecologist is
necessary, usually for a more
complicated or special problem,
such a physician is available at

Cowell, and also, when necessary,
on referral from the Health
Service, at the Palo Alto Medical
Clinic. For non-urgent or elective
cases, the appointment with the
gynecologist can usually be made
within 1 or 2 weeks, or less. For
truly urgent or emergency cases
the gynecologist is available
within minutes to hours as is
appropriate.

I enjoyed reading Professor E.
Shaw's letter to the Daily,
especially his conclusion on the
universality of his economic
science. The readers of the Daily
might be interested to know that
Professor E. Shaw has also been
an adviser to the repressive
governments of several U.S.
colonies in Asia and Latin
America. Also, he once attempted
to give advice to the Government
of Ghana which rejected his
"economic science" as being
definitely in favor of international
capital and against the masses of
the country.
In fact, Ghanaian officials had
to be a little less than polite in
order to get rid of Professor Shaw.
Weren't Professor Shaw close
toretirement, it could be
worthwhile for Stanford to follow
African example.

Whereas the creation of the
CJP and its subsequent use for the
prosecution of students is in
violation of the ASSU
constitution, previous resolutions
by the Student Senate, and a
referendum by the student body,
Whereas those being brought to
trial for occupation of the
Placement Center were active in
accordance with a student
referendum which sought to
restrict war-related recruiting on
campus,
Whereas the ASSU Council of
Presidents sponsored and
supported this action in
accordance with the above
mentioned referendum,
Whereas the administration has
again shown its willingness to use
arbitrary powers in lieu of
negotiation and counciliation in
dealing with the student body,
The Student Senate resolves

that the present prosecution
conducted by the administration
are unjust, without legal basis and
designed to promote further
turmoil on this campus and that
all concerned students should
attempt to rectify these
injustices by demonstrating
support for the defendants
through their presence at the
trials, and by any other effective
means, and by the combined
implementation of the student
referendum.
This resolution was passed in a
Student Senate Meeting on
January 27, 1972. However, only
a small part of it was reported in
the Daily, and considering the
importance of it, I thought the
whole resolution should appear in
full context.

carefully weigh and appreciate
the will of the Senate concerning
this resolution.

A basic problem, common to a
great many members of the
Stanford community, has arisen in
recent years with the emergence
of radicalism and now seems ever
apparent in the actions which are
now focusing upon the firing of
Bruce Franklin. That problem, as
it appears now, is the
indiscriminate use of terminology
within the radical movement. The
prime case in point is that of the
general movement which calls its
followers The People. Human
beings in a society, regardless of
their individual political
viewpoints, are people. When in
the course of events, as has
happened here, a small minority
has emerged calling itself by that
name, I wonder how long personal
and individual freedom are to
remain.
In that respect America at
present is populated by
oppressed people—oppressed in
that irresponsible radical groups
are acting in their name and mine.
The constant vomiting of left
wing propaganda makes one
constantly aware that one cannot
be a "people" without following
the party line. And when violence
and curtailment of individual
rights occurs because the party
wishes to substitute its moralities
in place of reason, and this
becomes the party line, I cannot
accept responsibility for The
People. How crude it is to see
beautiful words such as people,
society, and freedom lose their
meaning. No, cal! them something
else, but not people: we as society
are "The People", no one else.

A fact which the University
refuses to accept is that despite
the relatively few number of

Native American professors in this
country, there are hundreds of
people who not only teach
courses, but also can set up a
Native American Studies Program.
These people are native
Americans, people who I feel are
experts in the field. Mr. Baehetti's
