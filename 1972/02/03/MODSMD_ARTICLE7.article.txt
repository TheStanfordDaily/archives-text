## Mother Jones & The USE 
### 
jan gutter

There are stories told to this
day of Mother Jones, perhaps the
greatest woman agitator in all of
labor history, in the backwoods
coal mining districts of West
Virginia. Hunted, arrested, at
times even deported, held in
custody by the militia, she
organized for sixty years, all white
hair, benevolent features and
caustic tongue, dodging the
bullets of police and gunmen
alike. Fiery and profane, she was
the idol of miners everywhere.
1912 found her in a military
prison in Piatt Virginia gazing out
between the cold iron bars of the
'bullpen' along with fifty other
strikers and organizers.
It seems Mother Jones' crime
had been to arrive the day after
deputies and guards from the
mine had driven an armored train
with gatling guns through a tent
colony of miners as they slept.
While lead poured into the quiet
tents of the workers, a man by the
name of Epstaw rose and picked
up his children. He told them to
run for their lives. His feet were
shot away. Women were
wounded. Children died, No one
was arrested. Three days later a
mine guard was killed. So Mother
Jones found herself in the pokey.
The strike went badly.
Deprived of its leadership and

unable to hold public meetings,
the miners became demoralized.
They sent a secret correspondence
to the prison, asking permission to
call off the strike. A sympathetic
soldier delivered the message. It
was signed by the same Epstaw
who had been crippled months
earlier.
Note
Mother Jones borrowed a
broken stub of a pencil from
somewhere in the next cell.
Hardly pausing to read the note,
she quickly scribbled something
across its back in the dim light.
Curious, the soldier asked in a
whisper what her reply was.
"Well!", responded the eighty
four year old woman, "I told
them to pray for the dead ... and
fight like Hell for the living!"
Not unlike Mother Jones, USE
organizers at Stanford have found
themselves in something less than
an arena of free and open
discussion. I couldn't but feel a
tinge of irony as President Lyman
urged Stanford workers to
approach the upcoming NLRB
elections in an "atmosphere of
free inquiry and open discussion".
For almost a year now, USE
reporters have sought a regular
spot at the President's own press
interviews broadcast every
Tuesday night on KZSU.
Aback
Admittedly KZSU is student
media, but as members of the
Stanford community we were
rather taken aback when
instructed that approval for new
panel members must be obtained

through the office of University
Relations. Cornered, Assistant
Director Andy Doty, responded
that "Actually it was KZSU's
decision—but his office
encouraged the station to keep
outside adults from dominating
the program." We pressed the
matter. Radio station
representatives then had to
sheepishly admit that really the
only decision the University had
left up to them was whether or
not they wanted any interview at
all.
Vaudeville tactics appeared.
The USE reported would tiptoe
through the studio door five
minutes after the program
commenced. The President would
counter by sending John Swartz
as a substitute to the next session.
KZSU management could only
wring its hands and plea that USE
stick to showing up only at every
second interview. Finally Dr.
Lyman cut his press conference to
every second week. Now we're
even frozen out of that as he
moves to "exclusive" interviews
from the comfort of his home in
the faculty ghetto.
USE has tried almost
everything shy of laying seige to
the KZSU transmitter in order to
obtain equal rights to University
media. Should workers get
together and pull their power
plug? What would Mother Jones
have done?

shot away. Women were
wounded. Children died, No one
was arrested. Three days later a
mine guard was killed. So Mother
Jones found herself in the pokey.
The strike went badly.
Deprived of its leadership and

unable to hold public meetings,
the miners became demoralized.
They sent a secret correspondence
to the prison, asking permission to
call off the strike. A sympathetic
soldier delivered the message. It
was signed by the same Epstaw
who had been crippled months
earlier.
Note
Mother Jones borrowed a
broken stub of a pencil from
somewhere in the next cell.
Hardly pausing to read the note,
she quickly scribbled something
across its back in the dim light.
Curious, the soldier asked in a
whisper what her reply was.
"Well!", responded the eighty
four year old woman, "I told
them to pray for the dead ... and
fight like Hell for the living!"
Not unlike Mother Jones, USE
organizers at Stanford have found
themselves in something less than
an arena of free and open
discussion. I couldn't but feel a
tinge of irony as President Lyman
urged Stanford workers to
approach the upcoming NLRB
elections in an "atmosphere of
free inquiry and open discussion".
For almost a year now, USE
reporters have sought a regular
spot at the President's own press
interviews broadcast every
Tuesday night on KZSU.
Aback
Admittedly KZSU is student
media, but as members of the
Stanford community we were
rather taken aback when
instructed that approval for new
panel members must be obtained

through the office of University
Relations. Cornered, Assistant
Director Andy Doty, responded
that "Actually it was KZSU's
decision—but his office
encouraged the station to keep
outside adults from dominating
the program." We pressed the
matter. Radio station
representatives then had to
sheepishly admit that really the
only decision the University had
left up to them was whether or
not they wanted any interview at
all.
Vaudeville tactics appeared.
The USE reported would tiptoe
through the studio door five
minutes after the program
commenced. The President would
counter by sending John Swartz
as a substitute to the next session.
KZSU management could only
wring its hands and plea that USE
stick to showing up only at every
second interview. Finally Dr.
Lyman cut his press conference to
every second week. Now we're
even frozen out of that as he
moves to "exclusive" interviews
from the comfort of his home in
the faculty ghetto.
USE has tried almost
everything shy of laying seige to
the KZSU transmitter in order to
obtain equal rights to University
media. Should workers get
together and pull their power
plug? What would Mother Jones
have done?

There are stories told to this
day of Mother Jones, perhaps the
greatest woman agitator in all of
labor history, in the backwoods
coal mining districts of West
Virginia. Hunted, arrested, at
times even deported, held in
custody by the militia, she
organized for sixty years, all white
hair, benevolent features and
caustic tongue, dodging the
bullets of police and gunmen
alike. Fiery and profane, she was
the idol of miners everywhere.
1912 found her in a military
prison in Piatt Virginia gazing out
between the cold iron bars of the
'bullpen' along with fifty other
strikers and organizers.
It seems Mother Jones' crime
had been to arrive the day after
deputies and guards from the
mine had driven an armored train
with gatling guns through a tent
colony of miners as they slept.
While lead poured into the quiet
tents of the workers, a man by the
name of Epstaw rose and picked
up his children. He told them to
run for their lives. His feet were
shot away. Women were
wounded. Children died, No one
was arrested. Three days later a
mine guard was killed. So Mother
Jones found herself in the pokey.
