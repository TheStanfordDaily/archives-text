# Nixon's Offer: Generous Or Perfidious?
## 
### 
President Nixon labeled his
latest Indochina peace proposals a
"generous offer. . . that is fair to
'everybody concerned." North
f ' Viet Nam and Provisionary
Revolutionary Government (PRG)
spokesmen have denounced it as
'a perfidious maneuver to deceive
the American electorate in an
election year" and a "scheme for
maintaining American puppet
governments in Indochina."
Given the fact that over one
thousand people of Indochina are
dying every week with the
continuing war, it is imperative to
remind ourselves of the central
issues of the war and judge
'Nixon's proposals by the extent
t to which they confront those
fundamental issues.
What has inspired the
Vietnamese people to persist in
struggle against French
colonialism and subsequently
against American technological
warfare for over 25 years without
giving up?
The goal is that of achieving
freedom from foreign control and
the right to national
independence. With that aim
being the dominant motif of two
thousand years of Vietnamese
politial history and the primary
inspiration of the revolutionary
parties today, can we expect the
National Liberation Front (NLF)
or North Viet Nam to view
Nixon's proposals as generous
enough to induce them to agree to
a military ceasefire?
The Nixon proposals are asking
North Viet Nam and the PRG to
risk the political future of their
country to a process of elections
which will take place only one
month after President Thieu
resigns, elections in which Thieu
himself could well be reinstated
into office.
Elections
Nixon has attempted to outline
a system of elections that sounds
fair to American people and
government officials, because he
realizes there is an American
mesmerization with the concept
of elections. The Vietnamese
people are more realistic about
the function of national
elections they understand it as a

bothersome process designed to
" legit i m ize" predetermined
leaders. Not only are the Saigon
presidential elections of 1967 and
1971 instructive in this regard,
but the North Vietnamese and the
PRG poignantly remember the
last time they were promised free,
general elections by Western
powers, viz., the 1954 Geneva
Accords guaranteed such elections
for all of Viet Nam to be held in
1956.

Shoots in Asia

The only "election" which
ensued from the Geneva Accords
was the mock referendum which
Ngo Dinh Diem carried out in
1955, "winning" for himself
98.2% of the vote. Such sham
electoral results were acheived
from sheer fabrications of election
returns and by repression of the
revolutionary activity of the Viet
Minh. With Saigon's present
Phoenix program designed to
imprison or kill any sympathizers
of the NLF, it is unlikely that the
Liberation Army in South Viet
Nam will agree to an election
process such as proposed by
Nixon and Thieu.
Moreover, the Liberation
Forces know that any election
which would take place within
one month of Thieu's resignation
would be hopelessly rigged against
thern. The U.S. has for years been
preparing for such election rigging
in Viet Nam. Harvard's Samuel P.
Huntington, for one, wrote just
such a contingency paper,
"Getting Ready for Political
Competition in South Viet Nam,"
designed to rig elections most
effectively in that country'.
Even with the "international
supervision" which the Nixon
proposals promise would oversee
the electoral process, the real
question which the revolutionary

parties recognize is the question
of real political power during the
interim period between a peace
agreement and the actual carrying
out of the elections. If such real
power is monopolized by a
"caretaker government" in Saigon
run by Thieu's men and by
Thieu's appointed colonels at the
head of the provincial
governments, there is no
guarantee for the PRG to
campaign freely in the political

arena.
The PRG on the other hand, in
its seven-point peace proposal of
July 1, 1971 is asking for the
formation of "a broad
three-segment government of
national concord that will assume
its functions during the period
between the restoration of peace
and the holding of general
elections."
The PRG, being one of those
three segments, will then hold a
measure of real power in Saigon
and will be assured that they
could build their political
campaign without fear of reprisal
from the Saigon army and police
apparatus. As soon as the PRG
could be assured of fair political
competition between themselves
and the Saigon government by
sharing power in some coalition
arrangement, the NLF promises to
enter into cease-fire with the
armed forces of the Saigon
administration.
Not Acceptible
Without that guarantee of de
facto, free political activity for
the PRG, Nixon's insistence on a
general cease-fire as sine qua non
for U.S. withdrawal of troops will
not be acceptable to the PRG.
There has been a long debate
over what the North Vietnamese
and the PRG expect of the U.S.
vis-a-vis the Saigon government.
Nixon and Kissinger have said
there has been a demand to
"overthrow our ally." In fact,
what the PRG and North
Vietnamese peace plans have
called for is that the U.S.
withdraw its support from the
Saigon government.
If Nixon believes that

withdrawing US support is the
equivalent of overthrowing the
Saigon regime, what does this say
for the ten-year American
investment of lives and money
and Nixon's Vietnamization
program, all of which was
intended to allow the Saigon
regime "stand on its own feet."
Not only will the PRG find the
political aspects of Nixon's
proposals unacceptable, but
presently there is little chance of
their agreement to the military
proposals. They believe the
military position of the United
States in Indochina presently is
very untenable.
Withdrawals
American people are
demanding more rapid troop
withdrawals from Indochina, the
US troops still on the battlefield
are refusing to fight, and
American bombing—although as
high as ever in Laos and
Cambodia and destructive of
many people—is militarily largely
ineffective.
The Liberation armies of the
Indochinese nations, on the other
hand, are on the offensive. The
Plain of Jars is again controlled by
the Pathet Lao, Lon Nol's armies
are retreating from the
Cambodian countryside back into
Phnom Penh, and there are many
indications of a major offensive
imminent in South Viet Nam. (It
is likely that Nixon realized the
increased domestic pressure for
quick withdrawal which would
come if and when the Liberation
Forces launch a major offensive;
this is likely one key to the timing
of his latest proposals.)
In short, with the Liberation
forces presently being on the
offensive, it is difficult to
conceive how a ceasefire could be
to their advantage. Indeed,
Nixon's proposals seem not to be
just short of an American-Saigon
surrender as he suggests, but
conversely Nixon is virtually
asking the North Vietnamese and
the NLF to surrender.
Little is new in Nixon's
proposals except phraseology.
Substantively, he is still seeking a
government in South Viet Nam
which will be favorable to the US
and preclude significant power to
the PRG. There are no grounds on
which to expect that the
revolutionary parties in Viet Nam
will give up the goal they have
been actively fighting for over the
past decades and accept Nixon's
"old wine in new bottles."
