The Ampex Micro 24 is a fine performing take-along machine
for making on-the-spot recordings or playing pre-recorded cas
settes. It operates on batteries or plugs into the wall. It has a
built-in five-inch speaker, and sounds a good deal better than
most other machines of its type, and comes with a mike, a car
rying case, and a blank cassette. The Micro ?4 originally sold
for SI 19.95, which should tell you something about just how
good it really is. Grab one!
