### BOB VINING 
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
officers arrested six persons yesterday
following the disruption of a class
taught by Professor of Engineering
William Shockley.
Five women, including a German
Department graduate student and the
wife of a Stanford law student, were
arrested. Also arrested was a male
photographer for the newspaper
Pamoja Venceremos.
They were identified as part of a
group that visited the class to protest
Shockley's genetic theories concerning
race and intelligence.
The women were charged with
wearing masks to avoid recognition,
disturbing the peace, and entering with
intent to disrupt lawful business,
according to sheriffs officials.

John Hawkes was charged with
disturbing the peace and trespassing.
Bail for him was $375.
Those arrested were: Betsy Elich,
graduate student in the Department of
German; Enid Hunkeler, wife of
Stanford law student Wally Hunkeler;
Laura King of Berkeley; Mary
Cummings of Menlo Park; former
Stanford student Barbara Hyland; and
John Hawkes 111, son of novelist John
Hawkes.
The women were taken to
Elmwood Women's Detention Center,
while Hawkes was taken to North
County Jail. Hawkes was released on
bail. The women were released on
their own recognizance.
Nine persons wearing white sheets,
accompanied by an unidentified male
wearing no sheet, confronted Shockley
at his 11:00 a.m. class in quantum
mechanics. Photographer Hawkes took
pictures throughout the affair.
Schwartz Called
Before Shockley went to the
classroom, a graduate student in the
class informed him that protesters
were waiting for him. Shockley then
phoned Special Assistant to the
President John Schwartz. Schwartz
later instructed Stanford Police
Captain William Wullschleger to call in
Santa Clara County police.
The arrests were made after those
dressed in sheets, the accompanying
male, and Hawkes had left the class.
Two Stanford policemen identified a
group standing outside the
McCullough Building, where the class
was held, as the disrupters. Sheriff's
deputies who had swept through the
building chased the group.
The protesters, who carried signs
saying, "No Freedom to Practice
Racism," and "Positive Eugenics: Off
Shockley?," told Shockley they were
from the local Ku Klux Klan. They
said they wanted to give him a prize.
For approximately forty minutes
Shockley talked and argued with the
protesters and with a Nigerian student

in the class. The Nigerian student,
Oladele B. Ajayi, said Shockley told
him he would have to audit the class.
Ajayi said Shockley had told him
"certain people are more qualified for
certain things, and I'm not qualified to
be in the class."
At one point, Shockley's wife asked
Ajayi, "Why don't you get your
friends out of this place?" Ajayi
answered that he had not known that
protesters were going to visit the class.
The protesters urged Shockley to
settle Ajayi's grievance before
everyone in the room. Shockley said
he could not do that under the
circumstances.
Shockley and Associate Chairman
of Electrical Engineering Ralph Smith
asked the protesters to leave. They lei
when a protester announced that
police were on the way.
Before leaving, they said they
would keep track of Ajayi's complaint,
and would return to the class.
Shockley Supported
Later in the afternoon, Shockley
met with members of the class. Four
of the six class members signed a
statement to the effect that Shockley
had not threatened Ajayi to make the
Nigerian audit the class. A fifth
student said he would sign a similar
statement. Ajayi would not sign any
statement.
After the meeting, Shockley
declared: "I don't consider the
students to be as much at fault for
their actions as . . . the higher levels of
the academic community." He said the
Stanford Board of Trustees "are the
ultimate control of this. The situation
at San Francisco State got a lot better
fast."
In related developments, Vice
Provost Robert Rosenzweig called on
the faculty to see classroom
disruptions as "a vivid threat" to their
freedom. Also, the ASSU Student
Senate last night called for a
committee to investigate the "alleged
racism" of Prof. Shockley.
