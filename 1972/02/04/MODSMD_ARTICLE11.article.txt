Shock ley
Editor, THE DAILY:
Professor Shockley says his
data indicate American Orientals
and Jews are more successful and
brainy than other racial groups.
As a "thinking exercise",
therefore, has he considered
whether the hapless non-Jewish
Caucasians of this country, so
cruelly disadvantaged in their
genetic make-up, ought submit to
voluntary sterilization? As a
fair-minded raceologist,
courageous enough to avoid the
dread "Speer syndrome", will he
recognize the dysgenic threat
posed to future generations by the
unregulated procreation of so
large an inferior group in our
nation as the Caucasians?

Rip-Offs
Editor, THE DAILY:
The issue of ripped-off faculty
club silverware is still with us. The
confused and opposed have stated
their side. Those of us who
support the action must state ours
as well. Monday's Daily quoted
out of context a SRM statement
issued following the rip-off. The
Daily failed to put the statement
into its historical perspective, to
point out that the "security of the
faculty—as exemplified by the
prestigious faculty club—has in
the past been achieved by
acquiesence to forces of political
repression." Professors Ross,
Baran and Franklin were all
sighted as examples. More
importantly, the full statement
put the faculty into a semi-class
perspective. It stressed the
privileges the faculty receives
"From little things like 'faculty
only' tickets, to more important
things like receiving a salary raise
when workers are laid off in the
university."
The class question is crucial.
Even upper class students can and
do work in solidarity with poor
and working people. The rip-off
was a symbolic attack on the
luxury of the ruling elite. It is
ridiculous for the faculty to eat
off thricely plated silverware. The
amount of capital tied up in the
luxury items of the upper classes
is appalling. Any attack against
this, however symbolic, is at least
understandable, and at best
entirely mandatory.
Stealing has to be seen in
context as well. The land Stanford
is built on after all is stolen from
the native Americans. Theft of
third world resources and cheeap
labor sustains the American
economic system. Ripping off
silverware is simply not the same
kind of theft. However symbolic,
it is in fact an attack on the
thieves.
The crucial question is that of
tactics. Any tactic of
confrontation left unexplained is
going to have negative effects to

those not involved. The major
weakness of the action was that
the whole collective felt
responsible for an action that was
not collectively decided upon and
which was not well explained
afterwards. Those of us who
support the action accept that
criticism whole heartedly and will
learn from it. Nevertheless we feel
that the action was basically
correct, as an attack on tthe
symbols of the ruling elite, based
on a recognition of that elite's
privileges and the pillage and grand
theft necessary to support it.

FMC Recruiting
Editor,THE DAILY:
On Friday, Feb. 4, the
placement center will welcome
FMC as its representatives come
to recruit future employees. Its
worth knowing what sort of an
organization successful applicants
will be involved with.
FMC is a local corporation,
headquartered in San Jose,
established in 1883 to serve
agribusiness. However, it didn't
really become big until World War
II when it had the foresight to
realize that the best business of all
is war. As it expanded into
producing armored vehicles its
sales jumped from $10 million
before the war to $241 million at
the end of the war.
Luckily for FMC, although the
war was over defense was here to
stay. Since then FMC has
continued to grow through
annexations to be a conglomerate
involved in a wide variety of
activities, from producing
pesticides (FMC has fought hard
against the attempts of the Farm
Workers, UFWOC, to regulate the
use of pesticides) to producing
phosphates (FMC has declared
that housewives are to blame for
phosphate pollution of our water)
to, most profitably of all,
producing "a lot of mean
weapons" according to FMC's
chairman of the board, James
Hait.
Nearly 20 percent of FMC's
income is for the production of
sophisticated weapon systems,
including armored vehicles,
anti-personnel mines and
projectiles, and assault and patrol
boats. Their biggest success was
the Ml 13, an armored vehicle
which has become the most
widely used armored vehicle in
the "Free World". They were used
to spearhead the invasion of Laos
last year. In fact, they have been
compared with the helicopter as
the workhorse of this war by
officials from the Dept. of
Defense. In addition to making
Ml 13, FMC produces mortar and
ammunition carriers, mobile
command posts, flame throwers,
carriers for the Vulcan
anti-aircraft guns, as well as
carriers for several surface-to-air

missile systems, including Lance
and Pershing which are equipped
with nuclear warheads. FMC helps
pacify the rivers with their River
Assault Flotilla and helps the
marines with their new LVTP-7,
an amphibious assault vehicle.
FMC profits even more directly
from the killing of Vietnamese
people with the production of a
wide range of weapons such as the
Beehive artillery projectile and
cluster bomb which explodes into
hundreds of half-inch darts that
only penetrate flesh and must be
surgically removed. These bombs
are designed to do no damage to
structures, but only to kill and
maim people.
Is FMC antithetic to the
interests of Stanford? Apparently
not, as Bill Hewlett is both a
member of the Board of FMC and
a trustee at Stanford. Can we
abrogate FMC's fundamental right
to produce whatever is most
profitable? Isn't it too complex a
problem to pass moral judgement
on FMC as FMC doesn't actually
drop the bombs they make and
after all, Coca-Cola manufacturers
also benefit from the war? While
these points are debated by our
concerned but cautious faculty,
Vietnamese people are being
slaughtered.
Its not hard to see that these
arguements are no more than an
intellectual smokescreen designed
to conceal the willing compliance
of Stanford with the genocidal
policies of imperialism. Those of
us who refuse to close our eyes
and do nothing must act to assert
not only our right to affect the
policies of the university but also
the right of the Vietnamese
people to exist. There will be a
rally at 12 noon on Friday at
White Plaza to put our rights into
practice.

Alum Attacks Band Again
Dear President Lyman,
My letter to you of January
6th, regarding the poor
appearance of the Stanford Band
on New Years' Day, was answered
by Donald Carlson of your
University Relations Department.
I am enclosing another copy of
my original letter since I do not
know whether you personally had

a chance to read it. In re-reading
my letter, apparently I did not
make it clear that I was watching
the band in person and not over
TV that day. As you can see from
Mr. Carlson's answer, he obviously
defends the performance of the
band, and perhaps you do, too.
As I stated previously, as you
are president of the University, I
am interested in how you view
these incidents, because the band
does represent the University in a
situation such as the tournament
of Roses, and should not be
allowed to present, as Mr. Carlson
explains, "their views of what is
good for Stanford", without
University approval.
You might also be interested to
note that in a separate letter
addressed to my wife, in reply to
one she wrote to you, Mr. Carlson
gave the reasons for the band's
performance as follows:
1. "There are six music
majors."
2. "There are some really first
rate musicians in the band. They
just have other more demanding
academic interests."
3. "These students play for the
fun of it."
4. "The band is an independv t
student organization, not
University-managed one."
5. "The Michigan band spent
more time practicing for the Rose
Bowl alone, than our band spent
in practice for the whole season."
6. "President Lyman has good
friends in the band."
In addition, Mr. Carlson did
not answer several of the most
important questions in my letter:
Why are there hippies in
pseudo-band uniforms?
Is sloppiness, poor taste, and
disregard for human values a part
of the current curriculum?
Does Stanford really stand
"extreme left of center" as shown
by the band at the half-time
performance?
Does Stanford really turn out
students who represent the school
by parodying the values on which
the school has been built over the
years?
President Lyman, do you really
concur with the performance of
the band, the explanation
provided by Mr. Carlson, and his
total disregard in answering the
above questions?

anti-personnel mines and
projectiles, and assault and patrol
boats. Their biggest success was
the Ml 13, an armored vehicle
which has become the most
widely used armored vehicle in
the "Free World". They were used
to spearhead the invasion of Laos
last year. In fact, they have been
compared with the helicopter as
the workhorse of this war by
officials from the Dept. of
Defense. In addition to making
Ml 13, FMC produces mortar and
ammunition carriers, mobile
command posts, flame throwers,
carriers for the Vulcan
anti-aircraft guns, as well as
carriers for several surface-to-air

missile systems, including Lance
and Pershing which are equipped
with nuclear warheads. FMC helps
pacify the rivers with their River
Assault Flotilla and helps the
marines with their new LVTP-7,
an amphibious assault vehicle.
FMC profits even more directly
from the killing of Vietnamese
people with the production of a
wide range of weapons such as the
Beehive artillery projectile and
cluster bomb which explodes into
hundreds of half-inch darts that
only penetrate flesh and must be
surgically removed. These bombs
are designed to do no damage to
structures, but only to kill and
maim people.
Is FMC antithetic to the
interests of Stanford? Apparently
not, as Bill Hewlett is both a
member of the Board of FMC and
a trustee at Stanford. Can we
abrogate FMC's fundamental right
to produce whatever is most
profitable? Isn't it too complex a
problem to pass moral judgement
on FMC as FMC doesn't actually
drop the bombs they make and
after all, Coca-Cola manufacturers
also benefit from the war? While
these points are debated by our
concerned but cautious faculty,
Vietnamese people are being
slaughtered.
Its not hard to see that these
arguements are no more than an
intellectual smokescreen designed
to conceal the willing compliance
of Stanford with the genocidal
policies of imperialism. Those of
us who refuse to close our eyes
and do nothing must act to assert
not only our right to affect the
policies of the university but also
the right of the Vietnamese
people to exist. There will be a
rally at 12 noon on Friday at
White Plaza to put our rights into
practice.

Alum Attacks Band Again
Dear President Lyman,
My letter to you of January
6th, regarding the poor
appearance of the Stanford Band
on New Years' Day, was answered
by Donald Carlson of your
University Relations Department.
I am enclosing another copy of
my original letter since I do not
know whether you personally had

a chance to read it. In re-reading
my letter, apparently I did not
make it clear that I was watching
the band in person and not over
TV that day. As you can see from
Mr. Carlson's answer, he obviously
defends the performance of the
band, and perhaps you do, too.
As I stated previously, as you
are president of the University, I
am interested in how you view
these incidents, because the band
does represent the University in a
situation such as the tournament
of Roses, and should not be
allowed to present, as Mr. Carlson
explains, "their views of what is
good for Stanford", without
University approval.
You might also be interested to
note that in a separate letter
addressed to my wife, in reply to
one she wrote to you, Mr. Carlson
gave the reasons for the band's
performance as follows:
1. "There are six music
majors."
2. "There are some really first
rate musicians in the band. They
just have other more demanding
academic interests."
3. "These students play for the
fun of it."
4. "The band is an independv t
student organization, not
University-managed one."
5. "The Michigan band spent
more time practicing for the Rose
Bowl alone, than our band spent
in practice for the whole season."
6. "President Lyman has good
friends in the band."
In addition, Mr. Carlson did
not answer several of the most
important questions in my letter:
Why are there hippies in
pseudo-band uniforms?
Is sloppiness, poor taste, and
disregard for human values a part
of the current curriculum?
Does Stanford really stand
"extreme left of center" as shown
by the band at the half-time
performance?
Does Stanford really turn out
students who represent the school
by parodying the values on which
the school has been built over the
years?
President Lyman, do you really
concur with the performance of
the band, the explanation
provided by Mr. Carlson, and his
total disregard in answering the
above questions?

Professor Shockley says his
data indicate American Orientals
and Jews are more successful and
brainy than other racial groups.
As a "thinking exercise",
therefore, has he considered
whether the hapless non-Jewish
Caucasians of this country, so
cruelly disadvantaged in their
genetic make-up, ought submit to
voluntary sterilization? As a
fair-minded raceologist,
courageous enough to avoid the
dread "Speer syndrome", will he
recognize the dysgenic threat
posed to future generations by the
unregulated procreation of so
large an inferior group in our
nation as the Caucasians?
Juliette L. George
Rip-Offs
Editor, THE DAILY:
The issue of ripped-off faculty
club silverware is still with us. The
confused and opposed have stated
their side. Those of us who
support the action must state ours
as well. Monday's Daily quoted
out of context a SRM statement
issued following the rip-off. The
Daily failed to put the statement
into its historical perspective, to
point out that the "security of the
faculty—as exemplified by the
prestigious faculty club—has in
the past been achieved by
acquiesence to forces of political
repression." Professors Ross,
Baran and Franklin were all
sighted as examples. More
importantly, the full statement
put the faculty into a semi-class
perspective. It stressed the
privileges the faculty receives
"From little things like 'faculty
only' tickets, to more important
things like receiving a salary raise
when workers are laid off in the
university."
The class question is crucial.
Even upper class students can and
do work in solidarity with poor
and working people. The rip-off
was a symbolic attack on the
luxury of the ruling elite. It is
ridiculous for the faculty to eat
off thricely plated silverware. The
amount of capital tied up in the
luxury items of the upper classes
is appalling. Any attack against
this, however symbolic, is at least
understandable, and at best
entirely mandatory.
Stealing has to be seen in
context as well. The land Stanford
is built on after all is stolen from
the native Americans. Theft of
third world resources and cheeap
labor sustains the American
economic system. Ripping off
silverware is simply not the same
kind of theft. However symbolic,
it is in fact an attack on the
thieves.
The crucial question is that of
tactics. Any tactic of
confrontation left unexplained is
going to have negative effects to

those not involved. The major
weakness of the action was that
the whole collective felt
responsible for an action that was
not collectively decided upon and
which was not well explained
afterwards. Those of us who
support the action accept that
criticism whole heartedly and will
learn from it. Nevertheless we feel
that the action was basically
correct, as an attack on tthe
symbols of the ruling elite, based
on a recognition of that elite's
privileges and the pillage and grand
theft necessary to support it.

FMC Recruiting
Editor,THE DAILY:
On Friday, Feb. 4, the
placement center will welcome
FMC as its representatives come
to recruit future employees. Its
worth knowing what sort of an
organization successful applicants
will be involved with.
FMC is a local corporation,
headquartered in San Jose,
established in 1883 to serve
agribusiness. However, it didn't
really become big until World War
II when it had the foresight to
realize that the best business of all
is war. As it expanded into
producing armored vehicles its
sales jumped from $10 million
before the war to $241 million at
the end of the war.
Luckily for FMC, although the
war was over defense was here to
stay. Since then FMC has
continued to grow through
annexations to be a conglomerate
involved in a wide variety of
activities, from producing
pesticides (FMC has fought hard
against the attempts of the Farm
Workers, UFWOC, to regulate the
use of pesticides) to producing
phosphates (FMC has declared
that housewives are to blame for
phosphate pollution of our water)
to, most profitably of all,
producing "a lot of mean
weapons" according to FMC's
chairman of the board, James
Hait.
Nearly 20 percent of FMC's
income is for the production of
sophisticated weapon systems,
including armored vehicles,
anti-personnel mines and
projectiles, and assault and patrol
boats. Their biggest success was
the Ml 13, an armored vehicle
which has become the most

Professor Shockley says his
data indicate American Orientals
and Jews are more successful and
brainy than other racial groups.
As a "thinking exercise",
therefore, has he considered
whether the hapless non-Jewish
Caucasians of this country, so
cruelly disadvantaged in their
genetic make-up, ought submit to
voluntary sterilization? As a
fair-minded raceologist,
courageous enough to avoid the
dread "Speer syndrome", will he
recognize the dysgenic threat
posed to future generations by the
unregulated procreation of so
large an inferior group in our
nation as the Caucasians?

Rip-Offs
Editor, THE DAILY:
The issue of ripped-off faculty
club silverware is still with us. The
confused and opposed have stated
their side. Those of us who
support the action must state ours
as well. Monday's Daily quoted
out of context a SRM statement
issued following the rip-off. The
Daily failed to put the statement
into its historical perspective, to
point out that the "security of the
faculty—as exemplified by the
prestigious faculty club—has in
the past been achieved by
acquiesence to forces of political
repression." Professors Ross,
Baran and Franklin were all
sighted as examples. More
importantly, the full statement
put the faculty into a semi-class
perspective. It stressed the
privileges the faculty receives
"From little things like 'faculty
only' tickets, to more important
things like receiving a salary raise
when workers are laid off in the
university."
The class question is crucial.
Even upper class students can and
do work in solidarity with poor
and working people. The rip-off
was a symbolic attack on the
luxury of the ruling elite. It is
ridiculous for the faculty to eat
off thricely plated silverware. The
amount of capital tied up in the
luxury items of the upper classes
is appalling. Any attack against
this, however symbolic, is at least
understandable, and at best
entirely mandatory.
Stealing has to be seen in
context as well. The land Stanford
is built on after all is stolen from
the native Americans. Theft of
third world resources and cheeap
labor sustains the American
economic system. Ripping off
silverware is simply not the same
kind of theft. However symbolic,
it is in fact an attack on the
thieves.
The crucial question is that of
tactics. Any tactic of
confrontation left unexplained is
going to have negative effects to

those not involved. The major
weakness of the action was that
the whole collective felt
responsible for an action that was
not collectively decided upon and
which was not well explained
afterwards. Those of us who
support the action accept that
criticism whole heartedly and will
learn from it. Nevertheless we feel
that the action was basically
correct, as an attack on tthe
symbols of the ruling elite, based
on a recognition of that elite's
privileges and the pillage and grand
theft necessary to support it.

FMC Recruiting
Editor,THE DAILY:
On Friday, Feb. 4, the
placement center will welcome
FMC as its representatives come
to recruit future employees. Its
worth knowing what sort of an
organization successful applicants
will be involved with.
FMC is a local corporation,
headquartered in San Jose,
established in 1883 to serve
agribusiness. However, it didn't
really become big until World War
II when it had the foresight to
realize that the best business of all
is war. As it expanded into
producing armored vehicles its
sales jumped from $10 million
before the war to $241 million at
the end of the war.
Luckily for FMC, although the
war was over defense was here to
stay. Since then FMC has
continued to grow through
annexations to be a conglomerate
involved in a wide variety of
activities, from producing
pesticides (FMC has fought hard
against the attempts of the Farm
Workers, UFWOC, to regulate the
use of pesticides) to producing
phosphates (FMC has declared
that housewives are to blame for
phosphate pollution of our water)
to, most profitably of all,
producing "a lot of mean
weapons" according to FMC's
chairman of the board, James
Hait.
Nearly 20 percent of FMC's
income is for the production of
sophisticated weapon systems,
including armored vehicles,
anti-personnel mines and
projectiles, and assault and patrol
boats. Their biggest success was
the Ml 13, an armored vehicle
which has become the most
widely used armored vehicle in
the "Free World". They were used
to spearhead the invasion of Laos
last year. In fact, they have been
compared with the helicopter as
the workhorse of this war by
officials from the Dept. of
Defense. In addition to making
Ml 13, FMC produces mortar and
ammunition carriers, mobile
command posts, flame throwers,
carriers for the Vulcan
anti-aircraft guns, as well as
carriers for several surface-to-air

missile systems, including Lance
and Pershing which are equipped
with nuclear warheads. FMC helps
pacify the rivers with their River
Assault Flotilla and helps the
marines with their new LVTP-7,
an amphibious assault vehicle.
FMC profits even more directly
from the killing of Vietnamese
people with the production of a
wide range of weapons such as the
Beehive artillery projectile and
cluster bomb which explodes into
hundreds of half-inch darts that
only penetrate flesh and must be
surgically removed. These bombs
are designed to do no damage to
structures, but only to kill and
maim people.
Is FMC antithetic to the
interests of Stanford? Apparently
not, as Bill Hewlett is both a
member of the Board of FMC and
a trustee at Stanford. Can we
abrogate FMC's fundamental right
to produce whatever is most
profitable? Isn't it too complex a
problem to pass moral judgement
on FMC as FMC doesn't actually
drop the bombs they make and
after all, Coca-Cola manufacturers
also benefit from the war? While
these points are debated by our
concerned but cautious faculty,
Vietnamese people are being
slaughtered.
Its not hard to see that these
arguements are no more than an
intellectual smokescreen designed
to conceal the willing compliance
of Stanford with the genocidal
policies of imperialism. Those of
us who refuse to close our eyes
and do nothing must act to assert
not only our right to affect the
policies of the university but also
the right of the Vietnamese
people to exist. There will be a
rally at 12 noon on Friday at
White Plaza to put our rights into
practice.

Alum Attacks Band Again
Dear President Lyman,
My letter to you of January
6th, regarding the poor
appearance of the Stanford Band
on New Years' Day, was answered
by Donald Carlson of your
University Relations Department.
I am enclosing another copy of
my original letter since I do not
know whether you personally had

a chance to read it. In re-reading
my letter, apparently I did not
make it clear that I was watching
the band in person and not over
TV that day. As you can see from
Mr. Carlson's answer, he obviously
defends the performance of the
band, and perhaps you do, too.
As I stated previously, as you
are president of the University, I
am interested in how you view
these incidents, because the band
does represent the University in a
situation such as the tournament
of Roses, and should not be
allowed to present, as Mr. Carlson
explains, "their views of what is
good for Stanford", without
University approval.
You might also be interested to
note that in a separate letter
addressed to my wife, in reply to
one she wrote to you, Mr. Carlson
gave the reasons for the band's
performance as follows:
1. "There are six music
majors."
2. "There are some really first
rate musicians in the band. They
just have other more demanding
academic interests."
3. "These students play for the
fun of it."
4. "The band is an independv t
student organization, not
University-managed one."
5. "The Michigan band spent
more time practicing for the Rose
Bowl alone, than our band spent
in practice for the whole season."
6. "President Lyman has good
friends in the band."
In addition, Mr. Carlson did
not answer several of the most
important questions in my letter:
Why are there hippies in
pseudo-band uniforms?
Is sloppiness, poor taste, and
disregard for human values a part
of the current curriculum?
Does Stanford really stand
"extreme left of center" as shown
by the band at the half-time
performance?
Does Stanford really turn out
students who represent the school
by parodying the values on which
the school has been built over the
years?
President Lyman, do you really
concur with the performance of
the band, the explanation
provided by Mr. Carlson, and his
total disregard in answering the
above questions?

Workers, UFWOC, to regulate the
use of pesticides) to producing
phosphates (FMC has declared
that housewives are to blame for
phosphate pollution of our water)
to, most profitably of all,
producing "a lot of mean
weapons" according to FMC's
chairman of the board, James
Hait.
Nearly 20 percent of FMC's
income is for the production of
sophisticated weapon systems,
including armored vehicles,
anti-personnel mines and
projectiles, and assault and patrol
boats. Their biggest success was
the Ml 13, an armored vehicle
which has become the most
widely used armored vehicle in
the "Free World". They were used
to spearhead the invasion of Laos
last year. In fact, they have been
compared with the helicopter as
the workhorse of this war by
officials from the Dept. of
Defense. In addition to making
Ml 13, FMC produces mortar and
ammunition carriers, mobile
command posts, flame throwers,
carriers for the Vulcan
anti-aircraft guns, as well as
carriers for several surface-to-air

missile systems, including Lance
and Pershing which are equipped
with nuclear warheads. FMC helps
pacify the rivers with their River
Assault Flotilla and helps the
marines with their new LVTP-7,
an amphibious assault vehicle.
FMC profits even more directly
from the killing of Vietnamese
people with the production of a
wide range of weapons such as the
Beehive artillery projectile and
cluster bomb which explodes into
hundreds of half-inch darts that
only penetrate flesh and must be
surgically removed. These bombs
are designed to do no damage to
structures, but only to kill and
maim people.
Is FMC antithetic to the
interests of Stanford? Apparently
not, as Bill Hewlett is both a
member of the Board of FMC and
a trustee at Stanford. Can we
abrogate FMC's fundamental right
to produce whatever is most
profitable? Isn't it too complex a
problem to pass moral judgement
on FMC as FMC doesn't actually
drop the bombs they make and
after all, Coca-Cola manufacturers
also benefit from the war? While
these points are debated by our
concerned but cautious faculty,
Vietnamese people are being
slaughtered.
Its not hard to see that these
arguements are no more than an
intellectual smokescreen designed
to conceal the willing compliance
of Stanford with the genocidal
policies of imperialism. Those of
us who refuse to close our eyes
and do nothing must act to assert
not only our right to affect the
policies of the university but also
the right of the Vietnamese
people to exist. There will be a
rally at 12 noon on Friday at
White Plaza to put our rights into
practice.

Alum Attacks Band Again
Dear President Lyman,
My letter to you of January
6th, regarding the poor
appearance of the Stanford Band
on New Years' Day, was answered
by Donald Carlson of your
University Relations Department.
I am enclosing another copy of
my original letter since I do not
know whether you personally had

a chance to read it. In re-reading
my letter, apparently I did not
make it clear that I was watching
the band in person and not over
TV that day. As you can see from
Mr. Carlson's answer, he obviously
defends the performance of the
band, and perhaps you do, too.
As I stated previously, as you
are president of the University, I
am interested in how you view
these incidents, because the band
does represent the University in a
situation such as the tournament
of Roses, and should not be
allowed to present, as Mr. Carlson
explains, "their views of what is
good for Stanford", without
University approval.
You might also be interested to
note that in a separate letter
addressed to my wife, in reply to
one she wrote to you, Mr. Carlson
gave the reasons for the band's
performance as follows:
1. "There are six music
majors."
2. "There are some really first
rate musicians in the band. They
just have other more demanding
academic interests."
3. "These students play for the
fun of it."
4. "The band is an independv t
student organization, not
University-managed one."
5. "The Michigan band spent
more time practicing for the Rose
Bowl alone, than our band spent
in practice for the whole season."
6. "President Lyman has good
friends in the band."
In addition, Mr. Carlson did
not answer several of the most
important questions in my letter:
Why are there hippies in
pseudo-band uniforms?
Is sloppiness, poor taste, and
disregard for human values a part
of the current curriculum?
Does Stanford really stand
"extreme left of center" as shown
by the band at the half-time
performance?
Does Stanford really turn out
students who represent the school
by parodying the values on which
the school has been built over the
years?
President Lyman, do you really
concur with the performance of
the band, the explanation
provided by Mr. Carlson, and his
total disregard in answering the
above questions?

Professor Shockley says his
data indicate American Orientals
and Jews are more successful and
brainy than other racial groups.
As a "thinking exercise",
therefore, has he considered
whether the hapless non-Jewish
Caucasians of this country, so
cruelly disadvantaged in their
genetic make-up, ought submit to
voluntary sterilization? As a
fair-minded raceologist,
courageous enough to avoid the
dread "Speer syndrome", will he
recognize the dysgenic threat
posed to future generations by the
unregulated procreation of so
large an inferior group in our
nation as the Caucasians?

Rip-Offs
Editor, THE DAILY:
The issue of ripped-off faculty
club silverware is still with us. The
confused and opposed have stated
their side. Those of us who
support the action must state ours
as well. Monday's Daily quoted
out of context a SRM statement
issued following the rip-off. The
Daily failed to put the statement
into its historical perspective, to
point out that the "security of the
faculty—as exemplified by the
prestigious faculty club—has in
the past been achieved by
acquiesence to forces of political
repression." Professors Ross,
Baran and Franklin were all
sighted as examples. More
importantly, the full statement
put the faculty into a semi-class
perspective. It stressed the
privileges the faculty receives
"From little things like 'faculty
only' tickets, to more important
things like receiving a salary raise
when workers are laid off in the
university."
The class question is crucial.
Even upper class students can and
do work in solidarity with poor
and working people. The rip-off
was a symbolic attack on the
luxury of the ruling elite. It is
ridiculous for the faculty to eat
off thricely plated silverware. The
amount of capital tied up in the
luxury items of the upper classes
is appalling. Any attack against
this, however symbolic, is at least
understandable, and at best
entirely mandatory.
Stealing has to be seen in
context as well. The land Stanford
is built on after all is stolen from
the native Americans. Theft of
third world resources and cheeap
labor sustains the American
economic system. Ripping off
silverware is simply not the same
kind of theft. However symbolic,
it is in fact an attack on the
thieves.
The crucial question is that of
tactics. Any tactic of
confrontation left unexplained is
going to have negative effects to

those not involved. The major
weakness of the action was that
the whole collective felt
responsible for an action that was
not collectively decided upon and
which was not well explained
afterwards. Those of us who
support the action accept that
criticism whole heartedly and will
learn from it. Nevertheless we feel
that the action was basically
correct, as an attack on tthe
symbols of the ruling elite, based
on a recognition of that elite's
privileges and the pillage and grand
theft necessary to support it.

FMC Recruiting
Editor,THE DAILY:
On Friday, Feb. 4, the
placement center will welcome
FMC as its representatives come
to recruit future employees. Its
worth knowing what sort of an
organization successful applicants
will be involved with.
FMC is a local corporation,
headquartered in San Jose,
established in 1883 to serve
agribusiness. However, it didn't
really become big until World War
II when it had the foresight to
realize that the best business of all
is war. As it expanded into
producing armored vehicles its
sales jumped from $10 million
before the war to $241 million at
the end of the war.
Luckily for FMC, although the
war was over defense was here to
stay. Since then FMC has
continued to grow through
annexations to be a conglomerate
involved in a wide variety of
activities, from producing
pesticides (FMC has fought hard
against the attempts of the Farm
Workers, UFWOC, to regulate the
use of pesticides) to producing
phosphates (FMC has declared
that housewives are to blame for
phosphate pollution of our water)
to, most profitably of all,
