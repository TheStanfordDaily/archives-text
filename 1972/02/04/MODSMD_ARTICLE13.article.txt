# Horowitz Hits Academic Orthodoxy
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
David Horowitz, editor of
Ramparts magazine, blamed
"academic orthodoxy" which
"gets your mind ... so that
nobody can think another way"
for the perpetuation of the ruling
class in this country.
Appearing as part of a panel
highlighting the opening of the
second annual Sociology Fair
Wednesday afternoon, Horowitz
presented his program for
"breaking the whole orthodoxy"
in academic institutions.
He said that most importantly
"Departments should be forced to
hire right away people of radically
different perspectives," and he
blasted the fact that there is no
Marxist professor in the Social
Science departments at either
Stanford or Berkeley. He also
criticized the treatment given the
late Marxist Paul Baran when he
taught here.
Horowitz recommended that
tenure should be granted
immediately upon hiring because
he feels that the real reason for
maintaining Assistant Professors is

that "they're easily exploitable
people."
Horowitz also claimed that the
budgets of University department
should be disclosed because "Any
structure in which you don't
know what's coming off â€” you
can bet your boots it's working to
your disadvantage," and that the
Ph.D. should be abolished since he

believes "it doesn't get people to
be scientists, it just makes them
tow the line."
The Sociology Fair is presented
by Graduate Students in
Sociology and will continue today
with Berkeley professor Guy
Swanson speaking on "Family
Dramas" (3:30-5:00 in Room
61H).
