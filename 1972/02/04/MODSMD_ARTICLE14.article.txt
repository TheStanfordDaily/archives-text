# Slate Wants Evaluation
## 
### 
A newly-elected "coalition"
slate of student officers of the
Education Association yesterday
called for the implementation of a
public evaluation of faculty
members, possibly with "pay
increments dependent on a
satisfactory evaluation."
The slate, which consists of
Jim Talley, president; Lynn
Curry, vice president; Lois Risling,
secretary; and Ron Miller,
treasurer, was elected after
balloting by School of Education
students Tuesday and Wednesday.
Talley hailed the "high degree
of student participation" in the
recent campaign, stating that the

voting had a turnout of "almost
50 percent" of the School of
Education student body. He
described it as "one of the most
viable graduate student
organizations" at Stanford.
As evidence of this
participation, Talley cited the fact
that Pascal Forgione, whom
Talley defeated for the
presidency, was now "fully
behind the coalition."
Curry, the newly-elected vice
president, appealed to the
Administration "to help
implement this platform," and
not to stifle student involvement.
