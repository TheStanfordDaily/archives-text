# ACT Depression Drama
## 'Paradise...' Doesn't Wear Well 
### DOUG ARTHUR 
By 1935, Clifford Odets had
established himself as a major
playwright by "Waiting for Lefty"
and "Awake and Sing," and the
Depression had become an
entrenched American malady. As
an artist vitally concerned with
the social conditions resulting
from the failure of capitalism,
Odets responded with a new play.
"Paradise Lost" pursues the
economic, social and moral
decline of the Gordons, who
reflect the plight of other
poverty-stricken families. Odets
represented the entire middle class
on his stage, a class whose values
and way of life had been pulled
out from under it.
The play doesn't wear well. It
is flawed (Odets thought it too
jammed), and many of the figures
of speech just don't make sense
anymore. The play's caricatures
and heavy-handed
characterizations are overly
conventional. The scope of the
action is diffuse and cumbersome.
And yet, for all its faults, the
play presents an affirmation of
personal integrity in the face of
disaster in its main character, Leo
Gordon. It is not one disaster, but
a series of catastrophes that
plummet the family lower and
lower.
Realistic Set
The realistic stage set depicts a
comfortable living room, a
cluttered dining room, and an
entrance hall (upstage with steps
leading to the second floor) of a
Bronx family. The bonds among
the many characters are stressed
by grouping them around the
dining room table. A radio near
the bay window (stage right) plays
the big band dance tunes of the
30's, in contrast to the pathetic
condition of the Gordons.
A large gold statue of a track
star dominates the set; it

represents Ben Gordon (Richard
Council) before his heart trouble
finished his track career. It is the
ideal Ben and its presence is a
constant reminder of what has
been lost.
Director Allen Fletcher has
utilized the statue to the utmost
advantage. Ben spits on the image
of his former self; the gangster
Kewpie wipes it off, later he hugs
the statue after Ben has been
killed in a robbery attempt;
corrupt men place money on the
statue. The statue symbolizes all
of the Gordons.
Another son, Julie, is afflicted
with sleeping sickness. The
daughter loses her most prized
possession, a piano. The head of
the family loses his business
money which, despite offers of
aid, causes the family to be
evicted.
A Corrupt Society
Other scenes involve the larger
society. A group of workers relate
the reprehensible working
conditions, meager pay scales, and
unfair labor practices of the
period. Corruption is the common
denominator for most
institutions, including, of course,
the police and the local political
bosses. E. Kerrigan Prescott as
Phil Foley plays the Irish political
boss with a zeal in his
pronouncements.
The blocking was generally
effective in vitalizing this show,
with one notable exception, the
last scene. With the stage almost
bare (the furniture is on the
street), two characters are kept
stationary while another two talk
to each other. Otherwise, this
production, especially in the
scenes with several characters, was
competently directed.
Elizabeth Covey's period
costumes did much to reflect the
fortunes of the characters. As the

Gordons become increasingly
threadbare, the politician wears a
blue pin-striped suit. The gangster
Kewpie, outclasses anyone,
however.
In the lead role of Leo Gordon,
G. Wood's German accent was a
bit too strong, some of his lines
were almost incomprehensible.
The most refreshing character in
the play is Gus Michaels, played
by Joseph Bird, who makes all his
scenes comical. It's a losing cause
though in the general context of
the drama.
Consummate Performance
Winifred Mann gave a
consummate performance as Clara
Gordon, the mother. Her
expressiveness and role grow with
the play. When she loses her
temper with her husband's
business partner, her anger springs
almost spontaneously.
The last scene is probably the
best in the play. Julie sits in a
wheel chair where he will be taken
to a hospital. The remaining
members of the family wait in the
dining room while a "prosperity
party" is organized outside. The
politician and his hacks demand
that the Gordon's re-possessed
furniture be removed from the
sidewalk so as not to spoil the
false look of prosperity in the
neighborhood.
Leo Gordon refuses, and his
wife gradually comes to
understand his reasons for taking
a stand for his integrity. At the
end, they can open the windows
without shame. So what's the
point? In Odets' words: "to know
from this that something must be
done."

playwright by "Waiting for Lefty"
and "Awake and Sing," and the
Depression had become an
entrenched American malady. As
an artist vitally concerned with
the social conditions resulting
from the failure of capitalism,
Odets responded with a new play.
"Paradise Lost" pursues the
economic, social and moral
decline of the Gordons, who
reflect the plight of other
poverty-stricken families. Odets
represented the entire middle class
on his stage, a class whose values
and way of life had been pulled
out from under it.
The play doesn't wear well. It
is flawed (Odets thought it too
jammed), and many of the figures
of speech just don't make sense
anymore. The play's caricatures
and heavy-handed
characterizations are overly
conventional. The scope of the
action is diffuse and cumbersome.
And yet, for all its faults, the
play presents an affirmation of
personal integrity in the face of
disaster in its main character, Leo
Gordon. It is not one disaster, but
a series of catastrophes that
plummet the family lower and
lower.
Realistic Set
The realistic stage set depicts a
comfortable living room, a
cluttered dining room, and an
entrance hall (upstage with steps
leading to the second floor) of a
Bronx family. The bonds among
the many characters are stressed
by grouping them around the
dining room table. A radio near
the bay window (stage right) plays
the big band dance tunes of the
30's, in contrast to the pathetic
condition of the Gordons.
A large gold statue of a track
star dominates the set; it

represents Ben Gordon (Richard
Council) before his heart trouble
finished his track career. It is the
ideal Ben and its presence is a
constant reminder of what has
been lost.
Director Allen Fletcher has
utilized the statue to the utmost
advantage. Ben spits on the image
of his former self; the gangster
Kewpie wipes it off, later he hugs
the statue after Ben has been
killed in a robbery attempt;
corrupt men place money on the
statue. The statue symbolizes all
of the Gordons.
Another son, Julie, is afflicted
with sleeping sickness. The
daughter loses her most prized
possession, a piano. The head of
the family loses his business
money which, despite offers of
aid, causes the family to be
evicted.
A Corrupt Society
Other scenes involve the larger
society. A group of workers relate
the reprehensible working
conditions, meager pay scales, and
unfair labor practices of the
period. Corruption is the common
denominator for most
institutions, including, of course,
the police and the local political
bosses. E. Kerrigan Prescott as
Phil Foley plays the Irish political
boss with a zeal in his
pronouncements.
The blocking was generally
effective in vitalizing this show,
with one notable exception, the
last scene. With the stage almost
bare (the furniture is on the
street), two characters are kept
stationary while another two talk
to each other. Otherwise, this
production, especially in the
scenes with several characters, was
competently directed.
Elizabeth Covey's period
costumes did much to reflect the
fortunes of the characters. As the

Gordons become increasingly
threadbare, the politician wears a
blue pin-striped suit. The gangster
Kewpie, outclasses anyone,
however.
In the lead role of Leo Gordon,
G. Wood's German accent was a
bit too strong, some of his lines
were almost incomprehensible.
The most refreshing character in
the play is Gus Michaels, played
by Joseph Bird, who makes all his
scenes comical. It's a losing cause
though in the general context of
the drama.
Consummate Performance
Winifred Mann gave a
consummate performance as Clara
Gordon, the mother. Her
expressiveness and role grow with
the play. When she loses her
temper with her husband's
business partner, her anger springs
almost spontaneously.
The last scene is probably the
best in the play. Julie sits in a
wheel chair where he will be taken
to a hospital. The remaining
members of the family wait in the
dining room while a "prosperity
party" is organized outside. The
politician and his hacks demand
that the Gordon's re-possessed
furniture be removed from the
sidewalk so as not to spoil the
false look of prosperity in the
neighborhood.
Leo Gordon refuses, and his
wife gradually comes to
understand his reasons for taking
a stand for his integrity. At the
end, they can open the windows
without shame. So what's the
point? In Odets' words: "to know
from this that something must be
done."

an artist vitally concerned with
the social conditions resulting
from the failure of capitalism,
Odets responded with a new play.
"Paradise Lost" pursues the
economic, social and moral
decline of the Gordons, who
reflect the plight of other
poverty-stricken families. Odets
represented the entire middle class
on his stage, a class whose values
and way of life had been pulled
out from under it.
The play doesn't wear well. It
is flawed (Odets thought it too
jammed), and many of the figures
of speech just don't make sense
anymore. The play's caricatures
and heavy-handed
characterizations are overly
conventional. The scope of the
action is diffuse and cumbersome.
And yet, for all its faults, the
play presents an affirmation of
personal integrity in the face of
disaster in its main character, Leo
Gordon. It is not one disaster, but
a series of catastrophes that
plummet the family lower and
lower.
Realistic Set
The realistic stage set depicts a
comfortable living room, a
cluttered dining room, and an
entrance hall (upstage with steps
leading to the second floor) of a
Bronx family. The bonds among
the many characters are stressed
by grouping them around the
dining room table. A radio near
the bay window (stage right) plays
the big band dance tunes of the
30's, in contrast to the pathetic
condition of the Gordons.
A large gold statue of a track
star dominates the set; it

represents Ben Gordon (Richard
Council) before his heart trouble
finished his track career. It is the
ideal Ben and its presence is a
constant reminder of what has
been lost.
Director Allen Fletcher has
utilized the statue to the utmost
advantage. Ben spits on the image
of his former self; the gangster
Kewpie wipes it off, later he hugs
the statue after Ben has been
killed in a robbery attempt;
corrupt men place money on the
statue. The statue symbolizes all
of the Gordons.
Another son, Julie, is afflicted
with sleeping sickness. The
daughter loses her most prized
possession, a piano. The head of
the family loses his business
money which, despite offers of
aid, causes the family to be
evicted.
A Corrupt Society
Other scenes involve the larger
society. A group of workers relate
the reprehensible working
conditions, meager pay scales, and
unfair labor practices of the
period. Corruption is the common
denominator for most
institutions, including, of course,
the police and the local political
bosses. E. Kerrigan Prescott as
Phil Foley plays the Irish political
boss with a zeal in his
pronouncements.
The blocking was generally
effective in vitalizing this show,
with one notable exception, the
last scene. With the stage almost
bare (the furniture is on the
street), two characters are kept
stationary while another two talk
to each other. Otherwise, this
production, especially in the
scenes with several characters, was
competently directed.
Elizabeth Covey's period
costumes did much to reflect the
fortunes of the characters. As the

Gordons become increasingly
threadbare, the politician wears a
blue pin-striped suit. The gangster
Kewpie, outclasses anyone,
however.
In the lead role of Leo Gordon,
G. Wood's German accent was a
bit too strong, some of his lines
were almost incomprehensible.
The most refreshing character in
the play is Gus Michaels, played
by Joseph Bird, who makes all his
scenes comical. It's a losing cause
though in the general context of
the drama.
Consummate Performance
Winifred Mann gave a
consummate performance as Clara
Gordon, the mother. Her
expressiveness and role grow with
the play. When she loses her
temper with her husband's
business partner, her anger springs
almost spontaneously.
The last scene is probably the
best in the play. Julie sits in a
wheel chair where he will be taken
to a hospital. The remaining
members of the family wait in the
dining room while a "prosperity
party" is organized outside. The
politician and his hacks demand
that the Gordon's re-possessed
furniture be removed from the
sidewalk so as not to spoil the
false look of prosperity in the
neighborhood.
Leo Gordon refuses, and his
wife gradually comes to
understand his reasons for taking
a stand for his integrity. At the
end, they can open the windows
without shame. So what's the
point? In Odets' words: "to know
from this that something must be
done."
