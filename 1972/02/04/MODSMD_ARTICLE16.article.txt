# SF Symphony
## Strong Guest Performances 
### DAVID W. WILLIAMS 
If in Wednesday's symphony
concert there was anything
worthy of complaint, it might be
that the total effect of the
program was a bit on the sombre
side. Otherwise, the music was
extremely engaging and the
orchestra in fine form and very
well conducted. The Honegger
"Symphony No. 2," was replaced
by Samuel Barber's "Meditation"
from the Medea Suite, and the
rest of the program (the
Mendelssohn violin concerto, and
the Sibelius "Symphony No. 1")
were played as announced.
The Barber composition,
inspired by the tragedy of
Euripides is indeed a tone poem,
one of seven movements that
recounts Medea's reactions toward
her children even as she
contemplates the murder of
Jason. It is a remarkably serious
composition, one which offers a
real challenge to the conductor,
and the players as its moods and
rhythms change rapidly.
Last night's visiting conductor,
former director of the Osaka
Philharmonic, and the newly
appointed director of the
Vancouver Symphony, Kaziyoshi
Akiyama is a very skilled if not
brilliant conductor, who got as
much out of that orchestra as
anyone ever has. The strings were
perfectly in tune, and only once
or twice could one hear a hom

out of order and even then only if
one was listening "critically."
Marvelous Composition
The Sibelius may have been
better played, though I felt more
at ease with the tempos in the
Barber. This niarvelously romantic
composition, written when
Sibelius was 34, is surely one of
the most popular compositions of
the twentietli century. Hence that
Mr. Akiyama's reading, compared
no doubt in a hundred minds to
dozens of other performances,
received spontaneous applause is
surely to his credit.
Nothing seemed hackneyed,
even the famous opening of the
allegro, and the very popular
scherzo was played with
freshness, sparkle and originality.
The andante was delicate enough,
though I have heard it played less
sentimentally, and perhaps the
tempi of the finale (sonata quasi
una fantasia) were not taken
rapidly enough, and there seemed
to be the merest lack of rhythmic
variation. Still his senior
conductor never let the music fall
into cliche, precisely because he
was rigorously interpreting every
phrase, leaving very little to
"tradition."
In the Mendelssohn concerto,
the orchestra was not always
lively enough for my taste, for
this composition is synonomous
with fun, but such it seems was
Pinchas Zukerman's impression,

and he more than did it justice. I
have heard so much about Pinch as
Zukerman in the last few months,
that seeing him threatened to
prove anti-climactic; happily the
suspicion was totally
unwarranted, for he is quite equal
to his reputation.
He is surprisingly relaxed,
often standing with the violin
hanging loosely from his fingers
durring the tutti sections, picking
up when his turn came to play
almost as if it were a toy. His
playing is as rigorous as his
manner is graceful and easy. At
times the elegance of his style
gave way to affectation, but
indeed I have never heard the
staccato passages in the last
movement played with such
definition and lightness of tone
and touch.
Both Mr. Zukerman and Mr.
Akiyama are to be congratulated
for their scrupulous deviation to
works which run the real risk of
being taken for granted. It was a
joyous evening indeed.

her children even as she
contemplates the murder of
Jason. It is a remarkably serious
composition, one which offers a
real challenge to the conductor,
and the players as its moods and
rhythms change rapidly.
Last night's visiting conductor,
former director of the Osaka
Philharmonic, and the newly
appointed director of the
Vancouver Symphony, Kaziyoshi
Akiyama is a very skilled if not
brilliant conductor, who got as
much out of that orchestra as
anyone ever has. The strings were
perfectly in tune, and only once
or twice could one hear a hom

out of order and even then only if
one was listening "critically."
Marvelous Composition
The Sibelius may have been
better played, though I felt more
at ease with the tempos in the
Barber. This niarvelously romantic
composition, written when
Sibelius was 34, is surely one of
the most popular compositions of
the twentietli century. Hence that
Mr. Akiyama's reading, compared
no doubt in a hundred minds to
dozens of other performances,
received spontaneous applause is
surely to his credit.
Nothing seemed hackneyed,
even the famous opening of the
allegro, and the very popular
scherzo was played with
freshness, sparkle and originality.
The andante was delicate enough,
though I have heard it played less
sentimentally, and perhaps the
tempi of the finale (sonata quasi
una fantasia) were not taken
rapidly enough, and there seemed
to be the merest lack of rhythmic
variation. Still his senior
conductor never let the music fall
into cliche, precisely because he
was rigorously interpreting every
phrase, leaving very little to
"tradition."
In the Mendelssohn concerto,
the orchestra was not always
lively enough for my taste, for
this composition is synonomous
with fun, but such it seems was
Pinchas Zukerman's impression,

and he more than did it justice. I
have heard so much about Pinch as
Zukerman in the last few months,
that seeing him threatened to
prove anti-climactic; happily the
suspicion was totally
unwarranted, for he is quite equal
to his reputation.
He is surprisingly relaxed,
often standing with the violin
hanging loosely from his fingers
durring the tutti sections, picking
up when his turn came to play
almost as if it were a toy. His
playing is as rigorous as his
manner is graceful and easy. At
times the elegance of his style
gave way to affectation, but
indeed I have never heard the
staccato passages in the last
movement played with such
definition and lightness of tone
and touch.
Both Mr. Zukerman and Mr.
Akiyama are to be congratulated
for their scrupulous deviation to
works which run the real risk of
being taken for granted. It was a
joyous evening indeed.
If in Wednesday's symphony
concert there was anything
worthy of complaint, it might be
that the total effect of the
program was a bit on the sombre
side. Otherwise, the music was
extremely engaging and the
orchestra in fine form and very
well conducted. The Honegger
"Symphony No. 2," was replaced
by Samuel Barber's "Meditation"
from the Medea Suite, and the
rest of the program (the
Mendelssohn violin concerto, and
the Sibelius "Symphony No. 1")
were played as announced.
The Barber composition,
inspired by the tragedy of
Euripides is indeed a tone poem,
one of seven movements that
recounts Medea's reactions toward
her children even as she
contemplates the murder of
Jason. It is a remarkably serious
composition, one which offers a
real challenge to the conductor,
and the players as its moods and
