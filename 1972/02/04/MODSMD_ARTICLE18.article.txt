# 'The Boy friend'
## An Unbroken Continuum Of Musical Numbers 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Ken Russell's "The Boy
Friend" is the latest of a
successive number of films to have
been, to put it gently, "altered"
by current MGM studio head Jim
Aubrey. More than a couple of
producers and directors in
Hollywood would like to have
Aubrey's scalp for the butchery
allegedly performed on their
pictures but Russell, surprisingly
considering his prima donna
reputation, is not among them.
In a trade advertisement,
Russell explained that once he has
develivered a film, the company
has the right to do with the
product anything it wishes, and
insisted that he was flying to Los
Angeles not to murder Aubrey, as
had been suggested, but Rex Reed
(Reed, one of the very few
reporters allowed on the set of
"The Boy Friend," apparently
abused Russell's hospitality by
slicing him up in print).
When I made up my list of the
best films of the year a couple of
weeks ago, I noticed in passing
that nothing from MGM was even
remotely in contention. Over the
past few years, control at the
studio has changed hands too
many times to count and though
the Aubrey regime reportedly is
gradually balancing the books, the
financial situation seems just as
dire as the artistic dilemma.
Aside from "Ryan's
Daughter," which stands as a
special case since it was initiated
several regimes ago and was
directed by David Box Office
Lean, the only MGM film which
made a respectable amount of
money last year was "Shaft,"
which pulled in six million and
ranks number 12 among the year's
moneymakers.
MGM's next money films of
the year were, embarrassingly,
reissues of "2001: A Space
Odyssey" and "Doctor Zhivago,"
followed by such box office
bombs as "Dirty Dingus McGee,"
"Pretty Maids All in a Row,"
"The Wild Rovers," "Night of
Dark Shadows," "The Last Run,"
"Get Carter" and "Brewster
McCloud." The recent record
can't be too impressive either,
with such gems as "Believe in
Me," "Villain" and"The Gang
That Couldn't Shoot Straight."
At the moment, the MGM
brass faces a lawsuit over another
loser, "Chandler," on which,
claims producer Michael Laughlin,
"all editing, post-production, as

well as additional scenes were
executed by James T. Aubrey,
Jr." More significantly, one of
Hollywood's most talented
directors, Blake Edwards, had his
latest film, "A Case of Need"
starring James Coburn and
Jennifer O'Neill, taken away from
him before completing work on it.
Through most of his career,
Edwards has proved himself quite
adept at the economics of film
production and though his last
two projects, "Darling Lili" and
MGM's own "The Wild Rovers,"
have gone monstrously over
budget, he had so far redeemed
himself by guiding "A Case of
Need" on schedule and budget.
What will happen at MGM is
clearly a question mark, but the
most telling testament of its status
at the moment is that only one
major director (Ken Russell
himself) is preparing a project at
the studio. Though it's still
difficult to endorse the concept of
non-movie people running a
studio, the results Warner
Brothers has produced under the
auspices of Kinney Cars and
United Artists under Transamerica
haven't proved disastrous.
Thus, if he won't let the artists
he employs finish their work, the
burden of creation rests with
Aubrey. For the record, Aubrey's
career has provided Merle Miller
and Jacqueline Susann with
material for "Only You, Dick
Daring" and"The Love Machine"
respectively, has lately been
dating, so say the gossips, Raquel
Welch, and, in his heyday at CBS,
bestowed upon us "The Beverly
Hillbillies" and "Petticoat
Junction."
At this point, if saying that
"The Boy Friend" is MGM's best
film in a great while isn't damning
with faint praise, I don't know
what is. Far from the perverse and
frenzied realism of "The Music
Lovers" and"The Devils," Russell
has made a film primarily
intended to charm and if he lacks
the innocent naivete needed to
charm genuinely and warmly, he
at least possesses the imagination
to divert and amuse.
If Russell showed us the more
unsavory aspects of Tchaikovsky
and religious history respectively
in his two previous films, he
certainly reveals the seamy side of
show business in "The Boy
Friend." The action of Sandy
Wilson's featherweight stage
musical is transplanted to a
second-rate pavillion in a

third-rate British resort town
where a vaudeville troupe is
attempting to get through a show.
The daytime audience can't
consist of more than 20 people
and just before the performance
(whose running time essentially
encompasses that of the film), the
star, enacted with relish by an
unbilled Glenda Jackson, arrives
with a broken leg and it is up to
the inexperienced ingenue to

carry the day.
Naturally, the ingenue is
Twiggy and the film exists to a
great extent as a showcase for her
hoped-for talents. Twiggy handles
the requirements of the genre,
such as singing and dancing,
decently but then it is not only
the ability to reproduce routines
that is needed in a film of this
sort. After all, Ruby Keeler never
could dance and if Dick Powell

was ever considered a terrific
singer, we can do without them,
thank you.
The essential problem is that
Russell doesn't extract much star
quality from Twiggy, doesn't
caress her with the camera,
doesn't allow her the time in any
early shot or sequence to project
herself naturally so that she may
become firmly and endearingly
implanted in our memories.
Christopher Gable, who played
the drowned lover in "Women in
Love" and Tchaikovsky's boy
friend in "The Music Lovers,"
who was a member of the Royal
Ballet and choreographed the
film, also executes the requisite
steps, but at times his eyes reveal
real decadence behind his feigned
innocence. The rest of Russell's
stock company asserts itself
admirably and I especially
appreciated (as 1 did in "The
Devils") the appearance of
Georgina Hale, this time as a
raucous comedienne.
Providing the springboard for
many of Russell's leaps of
imagination is his invention of the
role of a Hollywood film director
who happens to drop in on the
performance. Noting his presence,
the players pander flagrantly to
him in hopes of being given a
one-way ticket to California.
At the same time, Russell
ostensibly takes us into the
imagination of the director to
witness ripe Hollywood versions
of the numbers actually being
performed onstage. Thus, a tacky
dance routine may magically
become a second generation
Busby Berkeley production
number in which dancers traverse
a giant gramaphone turntable or a
gilded Twiggy tops off an
overgrown Rolls Royce grill.
Most of Russell's instincts as to
musical staging, decor and
atmosphere are sound and one of
the most inventive aspects of the
film lies in the development of its
admittedly feeble love story.
Russell intertwines the developing
love stories of both Twiggy and
Gable and the characters they
portray onstage to the point
where lines delivered in
performance are sometimes part
of the stage script and sometimes
direct conversation between
people, not actors. The eventual
happy ending, while just as hokey
as any other, is rendered more
satisfying, if not more
suspenseful, by the twist given its
development.
While Russell succeeds in many
individual instances, the
movement of the film as a whole
remains problematical. In
retrospect, the film seems like an
unbroken continuum of musical
numbers, some better than others
but none dazzlingly memorable.
What is lacking is contrast, a sense
not in this case of moderation but
modulation. As a result, the film
seems much longer than it really
is.
What lies on Aubrey's cutting
room floor will probably remain a
mystery forever but experience
reveals that excellent and lengthy
films such as "Children of
Paradise," "The Seven Samurai"
and "Lawrence of Arabia" seem
longer (and, needless to say, less
satisfying) in their cut versions
than in their original state. Even if
"The Boy Friend" never could
have shared such distinguished
company, a longer, correctly
paced version might have yielded
more satisfaction in seemingly less
time.

SKIN AND BONES—In her movie debut, Twiggy portrays a backstage
helper who has to replace an ailing star in The Boyfriend." Ken
Russell produced, directed and wrote the screenplay based on Sandy
Wilson's musical. "The Boyfriend" co-stars Christopher Gable. "The
Boyfriend" is currently playing at the Alhambra Theater in San
Francisco.
