### BILL CLASTER 
After splitting a pair of non-conference games
with Utah and Air Force, Stanford returns to
Pacific-8 action this weekend with a pair of games
against Cal. Friday night's 8 p.m. contest will be at
Maples with Saturday's game being televised from
Berkeley at 2:30 p.m.
Cal has played well in spots this season. They
opened the year with a thrilling 82-81 overtime
victory over Houston, then proceeded to knock off
USF and Arizona in easy fashion. The Bears then
consecutively met and lost to four top-ranked
teams, South Carolina, Princeton, Missouri and
Hawaii, and lost their early season momentum.
They have split their remaining games, and enter
Friday's contest with an 8-11 mark.
Graduation Losses
It's an understatement to say that Cal was hurt
by last year's graduation. In addition to losing their
third leading scorer of all-time, Jackie Ridgle, the
Bears lost three-time captain and all Pac-8 guard
Charlie Johnson. In addition, all-leaguer Phil
Chenier signed with the Baltimore Bullets as a
hardship case, thus foregoing his senior year of
eligibility.
Yet the two starters that return from last year's
squad are anything but pushovers. Center Ansley
Truitt is averaging 16 points and 10 rebounds a
game, and should become the greatest rebounderin
Cal history. His only problem this season has been a
tendency to foul too much too often.
The other returning starter is 6'6" junior forward
John Coughran. He is averaging close to 20 points a
game, and according to Cal coach Jim Padgett is
"the best forward in the conference." Padgett must
have thought he was the best forward in the country

Monday night, as Coughran poured through a
school-record 47 points against the Utah State
Aggies.
Other starters for the Bears include 6'4" Bill
Duwe and 6'l" Eric Long at the guards, and 6'B"
Carl Meier at forward.
Stanford again will play without injured forward
Dave Frost. Coach Dallmar fears that the Indians'
second top scorer might be out indefinitely, and
notes that his injury "leaves our front line really
short handed, and puts tremendous pressure on
Steve Shupe and Bob Buell."
Terry Praised
Dallmar was full of praise for guards Claude
Terry and Bob Nicholson. In regard to Terry,
Dallmar said, "he continues to carry the scoring
load as well as do so many other important things."
Of Nicholson he said, "he plays very well with Terry
and gives Claude someone to work with for those
medium range jumpers of his."
Latest Indian statistics show Terry leading the
Tribe's scoring with 20.5 points per game, and Mike
Mann topping the rebounders with 6.7 per game.
Bob Nicholson is the top shooter from the field
with a 56% mark, and Dave Frost and Pat Rusco
share the free-throw shooting lead with 83% figures.
Stanford and Cal are evenly matched. The
difference should lie in how well Mann can contain
Truitt, and whether or not the Bear center can
remain free of foul trouble. A pair of wins for the
Indians could enhance their chances for a second
place Pac-8 finish, as current co-leader USC has lost
star guard Paul Westphal for the season. They have
since been defeated by Seattle and Santa Clara, two
teams that previously would have had little chance
against the Trojans.

opened the year with a thrilling 82-81 overtime
victory over Houston, then proceeded to knock off
USF and Arizona in easy fashion. The Bears then
consecutively met and lost to four top-ranked
teams, South Carolina, Princeton, Missouri and
Hawaii, and lost their early season momentum.
They have split their remaining games, and enter
Friday's contest with an 8-11 mark.
Graduation Losses
It's an understatement to say that Cal was hurt
by last year's graduation. In addition to losing their
third leading scorer of all-time, Jackie Ridgle, the
Bears lost three-time captain and all Pac-8 guard
Charlie Johnson. In addition, all-leaguer Phil
Chenier signed with the Baltimore Bullets as a
hardship case, thus foregoing his senior year of
eligibility.
Yet the two starters that return from last year's
squad are anything but pushovers. Center Ansley
Truitt is averaging 16 points and 10 rebounds a
game, and should become the greatest rebounderin
Cal history. His only problem this season has been a
tendency to foul too much too often.
The other returning starter is 6'6" junior forward
John Coughran. He is averaging close to 20 points a
game, and according to Cal coach Jim Padgett is
"the best forward in the conference." Padgett must
have thought he was the best forward in the country

Monday night, as Coughran poured through a
school-record 47 points against the Utah State
Aggies.
Other starters for the Bears include 6'4" Bill
Duwe and 6'l" Eric Long at the guards, and 6'B"
Carl Meier at forward.
Stanford again will play without injured forward
Dave Frost. Coach Dallmar fears that the Indians'
second top scorer might be out indefinitely, and
notes that his injury "leaves our front line really
short handed, and puts tremendous pressure on
Steve Shupe and Bob Buell."
Terry Praised
Dallmar was full of praise for guards Claude
Terry and Bob Nicholson. In regard to Terry,
Dallmar said, "he continues to carry the scoring
load as well as do so many other important things."
Of Nicholson he said, "he plays very well with Terry
and gives Claude someone to work with for those
medium range jumpers of his."
Latest Indian statistics show Terry leading the
Tribe's scoring with 20.5 points per game, and Mike
Mann topping the rebounders with 6.7 per game.
Bob Nicholson is the top shooter from the field
with a 56% mark, and Dave Frost and Pat Rusco
share the free-throw shooting lead with 83% figures.
Stanford and Cal are evenly matched. The
difference should lie in how well Mann can contain
Truitt, and whether or not the Bear center can
remain free of foul trouble. A pair of wins for the
Indians could enhance their chances for a second
place Pac-8 finish, as current co-leader USC has lost
star guard Paul Westphal for the season. They have
since been defeated by Seattle and Santa Clara, two
teams that previously would have had little chance
against the Trojans.
