# Placement Center Case Begins, Hearing Disruption Expected
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Serious disruptions are expected
today at the first of the Campus
Judicial Panel (CJP) hearings on the
November 4 "mill-in" at the
Placement Center in opposition to
recruiting by the Honeywell
Corporation.
The CJP's hearing for four students
charged with violating the Campus
Disruption Policy at the Center will
begin at 9:30 a.m. in the Forum Room
of the Undergraduate Library. KZSU
will broadcast the hearings live.
The four are: junior Don Lee, a
member of Venceremos, and
sophomores Paul Loeb (Young
Crows), Pete Knutson (Young Crows)
and Steve Downey.

The Coordinating Committee of the
Stanford Rehabilitation Movement
(SRM) late yesterday decided that the
"hearings will not go on—people will
block them." The SRM's Steering
Committee has already set up a tactics
squad to coordinate activities and have
immediate contact with those who are
handling surveillance of the police who
are expected to be nearby for the
hearings.
Last night the ASSU Senate voted
17-10 to kill a proposal made Tuesday
night by an ad hoc committee to
authorize a student police force to
uphold student referendums and
Senate votes.
The force was designed to "enforce
student body opinion on the

Placement Center issue and the
Student Senate resolution on the
Campus Judicial Panel in particular."
After the vote, protests were heard
from the 60 "volunteers" who had
appeared at the meeting to sign on as
members of the force.
The group had come from a History
corner speech by Peter Boehmer, a
recently-fired professor at San Diego
State. After the Senate vote, Boehmer
and about 30 others moved to the Law
School where he continued his speech
in the Law Library for about another
half hour. A "tour" of the Library
followed and the group dispersed.
New Senators
There was considerable speculation
that the presence of a number of the
newly-elected senators from graduate
schools was a significant factor in the
vote against the police force.
Reportedly some senators were also
disaffected by the presence of the
volunteers during the vote.
Yesterday Law Professor John
Kaplan's 2:15 class was disrupted by
students who questioned him about
his role as chairman of the CJP. Of the
disruption Kaplan said "I shouldn't be
upset—but I am."
The SRM will also hold a rally
tomorrow at the Placement Center at
12:30 p.m. to protest the recruiting of
the FMC Corporation.
The CJP hearing will be the first of
its kind under the new judicial rules
adopted after the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) was abolished. Presiding
over the hearing will be Santa Clara
University Law Professor Lillian
Altree.
Altree will hear the evidence and
then present what she perceives to be
the facts of the case to the CJP for its
consideration. Under the SJC the
entire Council itself heard the
evidence. The defendants in the case
have objected to this particular aspect
of the change in judicial procedures.
Motions Denied
Defense counsel have also filed a
motion requesting that the CJP
hearings be held in the evening instead
of the morning so that students and
workers might attend and testify at
the hearings without missing class or
work. Kaplan denied this motion.
Kaplan also denied a defense
motion to convene the entire CJP to
hear arguments questioning the
legitimacy of the Panel and its
hearings. In a related motion, the
defense asked that all hearings be held
before the entire Panel instead of
before the hearing officer alone.
The defense also requested that
"law students who act as defense

counsel be paid or given credit for
their work" and that a defense
"lawyer of the defendants choosing be
paid for by the University." Both
motions were rejected by Kaplan.
Serving as defense counsel for the
four Placement Center defendants are
law students Wally Hunkeler, Peter
Goldscheider, Owen Blank, Mick
Goldstein, Dave Schlissel and
Stephanie Wildman.
Class Distrupted
Kaplan's evidence law class was
disrupted by a number of people who
questioned Kaplan about the CJP.
They identified themselves as members
of an SRM "Rehab Squad." According
to some of the protesters, Kaplan told
them that he would rather try people
than "see the University run by a
bunch of thugs."

After ten or fifteen minutes of
interchange, Kaplan said "there'll be
no more questions" and asked the
demonstrators to leave. The protesters
left at about 2:45 and Kaplan kept his
class ten minutes longer than usual to
cover the planned material for the day.
Last night Kaplan told the Daily
that the demonstration was "just not
what should be going on at this
University." He said it was "very
unnerving and I guess I proved it by
screwing up the rest of the class time."
It was reported that after the
demonstrators left the class one of
Kaplan's students attempted to ask
him a further question about the CJP,
but was squelched by Kaplan. Another
student in the class, Sam Swift, said he
thought Kaplan had been "pretty
arbitrary and dictatorial."
