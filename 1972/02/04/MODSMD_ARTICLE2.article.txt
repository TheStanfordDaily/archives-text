# Placement Center Case Begins, Hearing Disruption Expected
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Serious disruptions are expected
today at the first of the Campus
Judicial Panel (CJP) hearings on the
November 4 "mill-in" at the
Placement Center in opposition to
recruiting by the Honeywell
Corporation.
The CJP's hearing for four students
charged with violating the Campus
Disruption Policy at the Center will
begin at 9:30 a.m. in the Forum Room
of the Undergraduate Library. KZSU
will broadcast the hearings live.
The four are: junior Don Lee, a
member of Venceremos, and
sophomores Paul Loeb (Young
Crows), Pete Knutson (Young Crows)
and Steve Downey.

The Coordinating Committee of the
Stanford Rehabilitation Movement
(SRM) late yesterday decided that the
"hearings will not go on—people will
block them." The SRM's Steering
Committee has already set up a tactics
squad to coordinate activities and have
immediate contact with those who are
handling surveillance of the police who
are expected to be nearby for the
hearings.
Last night the ASSU Senate voted
17-10 to kill a proposal made Tuesday
night by an ad hoc committee to
authorize a student police force to
uphold student referendums and
Senate votes.
The force was designed to "enforce
student body opinion on the

Placement Center issue and the
Student Senate resolution on the
Campus Judicial Panel in particular."
After the vote, protests were heard
from the 60 "volunteers" who had
appeared at the meeting to sign on as
members of the force.
The group had come from a History
corner speech by Peter Boehmer, a
recently-fired professor at San Diego
State. After the Senate vote, Boehmer
and about 30 others moved to the Law
School where he continued his speech
in the Law Library for about another
half hour. A "tour" of the Library
followed and the group dispersed.
New Senators
There was considerable speculation
