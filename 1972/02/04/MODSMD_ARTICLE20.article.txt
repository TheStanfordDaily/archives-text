# Stanford Hockey Team Easily Downs Cal, USF
## 
### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
After a disappointing showing
against Air Force in Fresno,
Stanford rolled over Cal and the
University of San P'rancisco in
uninspired form. The Cards must
play better position hockey and
show more desire if they are going
to have a chance of defeating the
league-leading San Francisco Seals
when they face-off against them
Sunday night.
Against Air Force, Stanford
was nervous v and tired. They

played poor position and did not
produce the kind of defensive
hockey needed to stop the
high-powered Cadet offense. If
Air Force had not scored three
goals in the first six minutes and if
Stanford had connected on some
of their own plays early in the
game the contest might have been
more even.
The Cards will have two more
chances to redeem themselves,
however, when they visit

Colorado Springs later this month.
Cal Falls
On Sunday the 23rd, Stanford
defeated Cal, 9-3. The Cards
started slowly but poured it on in
the third period as they tallied
four times. Tom Perrot and Paul
Tittmann were the offensive stars
for Stanford. The game was quite
rough as Cal took advantage of
the permissive referees and
knocked Stanford around. Several
flagrant charging violations went
unnoticed by the officials.
The Stanford scoring plays
were well executed. Eddie
Leonard fed Tom Perrot on two
of his three goals. On one Leonard
hit Perrot with a perfect pass
sending him in on the Cal goalie
all alone. The line of Pat Baldwin,
Rich Jaros, and Tittmann was also
passing spectacularly and had it
not been for some outstanding
netminding by the Cal goalie, they
would have scored more.
On Tuesday night the Cards
took on cellar-dwelling USF.
Stanford played a very sluggish
first period, allowing USF to score
first. But the Cards tied up the
score as Tittmann combined with

Jaros and Baldwin to score.
Cards Control
Eventually the Indians took
control of the game as they ceased
their sloppy and sluggish play.
The Cards dominated play for the
last two periods, but as in their
game against Cal, they ran up
against tough goaltending. The
Indians were continually frustrated
in their opponent's end.
Tittmann recorded his first hat
trick of 1972 and the
Baldwin-Tittmann-Jaros line again
supplied the offensive punch for
the Cards.
Stanford must be in top form
against San Francisco on Sunday
night. The Seals have more ability,
better skaters, and more depth
than any of Stanford's league
opponents. The Cards must score
early and often and must keep the
Seals' explosive offense in control
with good backchecking.
Since the Seals are not as rough
or as intimidating as Belmont and
the Berkeley Juniors the game
should be an interesting and
exciting one to watch. Gametime
is 8:15 p.m. at Legg's Arena in
San Francisco.
