# Stanford Baseball Squad Opens 1972 Season Today
## 
### STAN WILSON 
Stanford's varsity baseball
team opens its season Friday
against USF, and a young but
talented group of performers
promises to improve on last year's
record-setting season. The team,
led by All-American Rod Boone,
has an excellent chance of
surpassing last year's season win
record of 39 victories.
According to Coach Ray
Young, "We're ready to play
now." The team has "certainly
the best depth in the last 5 or 6
years." The first four pitchers are
all returnees, and altogether the
team has five returning players
who lettered as freshmen. Coach
Young is looking for pitching
strength in right-handers Dan
Shaw and Tom Kammeyer, and
southpaws Bob Dipietro and Nick
Peterson. The team features an
excellent defense and a powerful
offense.
Excellent Line-Up
Besides Boone, Coach Young
looks for added power from right

fielder Mike Nelson and first
baseman Mark Lucich, both of
whom were second-team
all-conference selections last year.
But the "lineup from top to
bottom should be excellent,"
continued Coach Young. Other
probable starters are Bob Reece at
catcher, Dave Edson at second
base, A 1 O'Brien, another
All-Conference selection, at
shortstop, Kim Hannaford at third
base, and Glen Johnson at center.
As usual, the Pac-8 is one of
the strongest conferences in the
country, with perennial power
USC probably providing the
Indians with their major
challenge. Coach Young describes
the Southern Division, comprised
of Stanford, Cal, USC, and UCLA,
as "probably four of the best
teams in the country."
Accordingly, this should be one of
the best conterence races in years
in terms of quality.
North Powerful
Similarly, the Northern
Division will be very powerful,

with Oregon perhaps the strongest
of the four teams. Last year
Stanford posted a 39-21 season
record. The 39 wins established a
season win record for a Stanford
team. The squad finished second
in the Pac-8 with an 11-6 record,
after losing four of its first five
starts.
Saturday afternoon at 2 p.m.
the varsity will play an alumni
team, which will enable the fans
to view several past Stanford stars
who are now playing professional
baseball. Stanford plays an
eighteen game league slate,
meeting each of the Southern
Division teams six times. The
winner of the Southern Division
will play the winner of the
Northern Division for the
conference championship.
The team had an excellent fall
showing, and continued clear
weather has enabled them to get
an early start on the spring
campaign. The varsity baseball
team works out nine months of
the year, and will probably be one
of the best in the country.

with Oregon perhaps the strongest
of the four teams. Last year
Stanford posted a 39-21 season
record. The 39 wins established a
season win record for a Stanford
team. The squad finished second
in the Pac-8 with an 11-6 record,
after losing four of its first five
starts.
Saturday afternoon at 2 p.m.
the varsity will play an alumni
team, which will enable the fans
to view several past Stanford stars
who are now playing professional
baseball. Stanford plays an
eighteen game league slate,
meeting each of the Southern
Division teams six times. The
winner of the Southern Division
will play the winner of the
Northern Division for the
conference championship.
The team had an excellent fall
showing, and continued clear
weather has enabled them to get
an early start on the spring
campaign. The varsity baseball
team works out nine months of
the year, and will probably be one
of the best in the country.

FACE-OFF—Stanford's hockey club team will face the league-leading San Francisco Seals Sunday. The
icemen have downed Cal and USF, while losing to Air Force in their last three outings.
Stanford's varsity baseball
team opens its season Friday
against USF, and a young but
talented group of performers
promises to improve on last year's
record-setting season. The team,
led by All-American Rod Boone,
has an excellent chance of
surpassing last year's season win
record of 39 victories.
According to Coach Ray
Young, "We're ready to play
now." The team has "certainly
the best depth in the last 5 or 6
years." The first four pitchers are
all returnees, and altogether the
team has five returning players
who lettered as freshmen. Coach
Young is looking for pitching
strength in right-handers Dan
Shaw and Tom Kammeyer, and
southpaws Bob Dipietro and Nick
Peterson. The team features an
excellent defense and a powerful
offense.
Excellent Line-Up
Besides Boone, Coach Young
looks for added power from right

fielder Mike Nelson and first
baseman Mark Lucich, both of
whom were second-team
all-conference selections last year.
But the "lineup from top to
bottom should be excellent,"
continued Coach Young. Other
probable starters are Bob Reece at
catcher, Dave Edson at second
base, A 1 O'Brien, another
All-Conference selection, at
shortstop, Kim Hannaford at third
base, and Glen Johnson at center.
As usual, the Pac-8 is one of
the strongest conferences in the
country, with perennial power
USC probably providing the
Indians with their major
challenge. Coach Young describes
the Southern Division, comprised
of Stanford, Cal, USC, and UCLA,
as "probably four of the best
teams in the country."
Accordingly, this should be one of
the best conterence races in years
in terms of quality.
North Powerful
Similarly, the Northern
Division will be very powerful,

with Oregon perhaps the strongest
of the four teams. Last year
Stanford posted a 39-21 season
record. The 39 wins established a
season win record for a Stanford
team. The squad finished second
in the Pac-8 with an 11-6 record,
after losing four of its first five
