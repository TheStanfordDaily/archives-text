# Gymnastics Tomorrow
## Cards Meet UCLA 
### MIKE HERMAN 
"It's going to be close ... I
don't want to predict, but I feel
we're getting it together and
should look good." These were
the comments of gymnastics
coach, Dan Millman, as his squad
prepared for its upcoming match
against UCLA.
The highly promising Stanford
gymnasts, with team leader Steve
Hug back after a week's absence,
face the always dangerous Bruins
tomorrow night at 7:30 p.m. in
the Old Pavilion.
The clash may go a long way in
determining what Pacific Eight
team will represent the conference
in the NCAA gymnastics playoffs.
Stanford and UCLA, along with
the University of Washington, are
regarded as the two teams in the
Pac-8 and therefore a victory on
Saturday is crucial to the Indians'
title hopes.
Individual Effort
However, gymnastics, like
track, is a sport which is more
individualistic than most team
sports. Hug, who as a 16-year
old participated in the 1968
United States Olympic team,
referred to this singular spirit
when he was asked about the

team's prospects for a victory over
UCLA: "I really don't think that
the match is all that important. I
don't look at the scores
anymore."
Hug did not take part in the
UCLA Invitational Tournament
with his teammates last
weekend, but travelled to
Pennsyl.a.iia instead for a match
with a Japanese all-star team,
reputed to be the world's premier
gymnasts. The journey proved
ill-fated, however, as Hug
seriously sprained his ankle five
minutes prior to the match
attempting a side somersault from
one ankle. The freak injury
prevented him from participating
in the international meet and has
kept him from gaining top form
for the match against UCLA.
Meanwhile, the balance of the
team was participating for the
first time ever in the UCLA
Invitational, a meet that brought
together many of the nation's best
gym squads. At a superficial
glance, the weekend might appear
to have been a complete fiasco,
since the team could only manage
a sixth place finish in the
seven-team event. Yet the strength
of the competition was such that,
with Hug out, the Indians
performed well.
Lobos Tops
The University of New Mexico,
which is a likely candidate for the
NCAA team championship this
year, finished first. Behind that
powerhouse were California State
College at Fullerton, who last year
was the college division's national
champion; California, always a
strong opponent who was nearly
at top strength, San Fernando
Valley State College, UCLA,
Stanford and USC, a team that
the Indians outpointed for the
second time in two weeks.
Again, individual efforts proved
the only bright aspects of the
meet for the Indians. Bob
Anderson, always a crowd pleaser,
displayed his usual solid,
inspirational form.
Much-improved junior, Ted
Miyamoto, worked the all-around
event for the first time, and
showed great promise.
Across the Stanford campus,
gymastics is an increasingly
popular sport. The opportunity of
witnessing a top conference battle
as well as the performance of the
sophomore sensation, Hug, ought
to offer an enjoyable respite to a
sports weekend otherwise
dominated by the Stanford-Cal
basketball games.

gym squads. At a superficial
glance, the weekend might appear
to have been a complete fiasco,
since the team could only manage
a sixth place finish in the
seven-team event. Yet the strength
of the competition was such that,
with Hug out, the Indians
performed well.
Lobos Tops
The University of New Mexico,
which is a likely candidate for the
NCAA team championship this
year, finished first. Behind that
powerhouse were California State
College at Fullerton, who last year
was the college division's national
champion; California, always a
strong opponent who was nearly
at top strength, San Fernando
Valley State College, UCLA,
Stanford and USC, a team that
the Indians outpointed for the
second time in two weeks.
Again, individual efforts proved
the only bright aspects of the
meet for the Indians. Bob
Anderson, always a crowd pleaser,
displayed his usual solid,
inspirational form.
Much-improved junior, Ted
Miyamoto, worked the all-around
event for the first time, and
showed great promise.
Across the Stanford campus,
gymastics is an increasingly
popular sport. The opportunity of
witnessing a top conference battle
as well as the performance of the
sophomore sensation, Hug, ought
to offer an enjoyable respite to a
sports weekend otherwise
dominated by the Stanford-Cal
basketball games.
"It's going to be close ... I
don't want to predict, but I feel
we're getting it together and
should look good." These were
the comments of gymnastics
coach, Dan Millman, as his squad
prepared for its upcoming match
against UCLA.
The highly promising Stanford
gymnasts, with team leader Steve
Hug back after a week's absence,
face the always dangerous Bruins
tomorrow night at 7:30 p.m. in
the Old Pavilion.
The clash may go a long way in
determining what Pacific Eight
team will represent the conference
in the NCAA gymnastics playoffs.
Stanford and UCLA, along with
the University of Washington, are
regarded as the two teams in the
Pac-8 and therefore a victory on
Saturday is crucial to the Indians'
title hopes.
Individual Effort
However, gymnastics, like
track, is a sport which is more
individualistic than most team
sports. Hug, who as a 16-year
old participated in the 1968
United States Olympic team,
referred to this singular spirit
when he was asked about the

team's prospects for a victory over
UCLA: "I really don't think that
the match is all that important. I
don't look at the scores
anymore."
Hug did not take part in the
UCLA Invitational Tournament
with his teammates last
weekend, but travelled to
Pennsyl.a.iia instead for a match
with a Japanese all-star team,
reputed to be the world's premier
gymnasts. The journey proved
ill-fated, however, as Hug
seriously sprained his ankle five
minutes prior to the match
attempting a side somersault from
one ankle. The freak injury
prevented him from participating
in the international meet and has
kept him from gaining top form
for the match against UCLA.
Meanwhile, the balance of the
team was participating for the
first time ever in the UCLA
Invitational, a meet that brought
together many of the nation's best
gym squads. At a superficial
