Viet Cong Reject Plan
PARIS — The Viet Cong placed before the Paris talks
yesterday its revised peace plan calling for the immediate
resignation of Nguyen Van Thieu as South Vietnam's
president. But the United States suggested the Communist
side take another look at President Nixon's eight-point
plan as the basis for ending the Indochina war.
U.S. Ambassador William J. Porter made no detailed
response to the Viet Cong plan but in Washington a State
Department official said there seemed to be some hopeful
elements in it.
The Communists told Porter they do not accept the
plan disclosed last week by Nixon on television and put to
the North Vietnamese by presidential aide Henry A.
Kissinger last Oct. 11.
Porter replied: "This seems to indicate a basic
misunderstanding of the negotiating process generally and
of what our proposal is designed to do specifically."
British Increase Troop Strength
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Britain ordered a battalion
of army reinforcements to Northern Ireland yesterday.
Defiant civil rights leaders refused to call off an illegal
protest march set for Sunday near the border with
southern Ireland.
The troop movements, which will bring army strength
in the province to 15,000 men, were announced after
another day of gun battles and explosions in the streets of
major northern Irish cities.
Over the border in the Irish republic, Prime Minister
Jack Lynch pledged tough action to crush insurgents
"seeking to overthrow the institutions of the state."

He accused outlaws of leading Wednesday night's
destruction of Britain's embassy in Dublin and warned
such men were endangering "our institutions of freedom
and democracy."
In London, the British foreign secretary, Sir Alec
Douglas-Home, demanded full compensation from the
Irish government for the destroyed embassy and told
Dublin it must change its present attitude to the crisis.
Otherwise, he declared, it "could do the most serious
damage — and lasting damage — to the relationship
between our two countries."
In Dublin, Lynch said he had promised Britain full
compensation.
In Washington, Secretary of State William P. Rogers
said the United States would be willing to play a useful
role in the Northern Ireland dispute, but "personally 1
don't think we can."
The secretary said President Nixon had expressed deep
concern over the recent events.
Rogers also told newsmen after a meeting with Foreign
Minister Patrick J. Hillery of Ireland that the United
States would not intervene in the situation and is not "in
a position to condemn anybody."
North Viets Ready To Lose Troops
SAIGON — A senior U.S. Military advisor said yesterday
that North Vietnam is ready to lose 10,000 men in a
central highlands offensive. The reason, he said, is that the
Communists feel they must demonstrate that they are still
a power to be considered in negotiations.
The North Vietnamese fear the U.S. will simply forget
negotiations and withdraw, the adviser said.
