# Professors Testify For Davis
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
Two Stanford professors and a
graduate student testified for the
defense in Angela Davis' trial
yesterday in San Jose. Statistics
Professor Bradley Efron, Political
Science Professor Charles Drekmeier
and Political Science graduate student
Charles Bruner each presented
evidence backing a defense motion for
change of venue on grounds that jury
selection procedures in Santa Clara
County are unrepresentative.
Efron explained a study he did for
the defense relating income to
likelihood to register to vote. He
found a "nice, almost linear
relationship," which showed that the
higher one's income, the more likely
he is to register.
Using data from the 1970 census
and a 1965 County Planning
Commission Report, Efron found
that, for example, in Santa Clara's
poorest census tract, where the average
income is $5172, 42 percent of the
people registered to vote. In the
wealthiest tract, where the average
income is over $16,000, 82 percent of
the people registered. For every $1000
increase in income a person is four
percent more likely to register, he

found.
Using a standard correlation test
Efron found that "it is almost
impossible" that this relationship
happened by chance. Because of the
relationship, according to Efron,
"voter registration will not give a
representative sample of the
population. It will be skewed toward
the wealthier population."
Bruner was called to testify about a
public opinion survey he and 20 other
members of the political science
department took for the Davis defense
council.
Among his findings were the
following:
- the higher one's income, the more
likely he is to register to vote.
—the higher one's educational level,
the more likely he is to register to
vote.
—caucasions are more likely to
register than members of ethnic
minorities.
- attitudes toward Angela Davis do
not differ significantly in different
income groups or educational levels.
—attitudes toward Angela Davis do
change significantly between registered
voters and those not registered. Those
registered are more likely to regard

Davis unfavorably.
—ethnic minorities were "less
prejudiced by the case" and less likely
to disapprove of Davis. Minorities are
also more likely to favor the defense in
a criminal case and are more likely to
agree that "the prosecution railroads
innocent victims."
Drekmeier was called as an expert
witness to explain why persons of low
socio-economic status are less likely to
register. He cited overt discrimination
as a major reason, especially in the
American South, but noted the
following reasons also:
—they are less clear what personal
gains can be obtained by the victory of
a particular candidate.
-they are confused by the
predominantly middle class values
projected through the mass media.
-they are less sure of the political
efficacy of the vote.
— they are more likely to be cynical
of the political process.
—especially among women they
have less time and energy to get to the
polls.
-they belong to fewer political
groups and find that conventional
politics is very abstract, and does not
relate to their situation.
