# Three Unions Remain In NLRB Election Race

A second union is out of the
running for the right to represent
Stanford maintenance workers in
collective bargaining.
"I was told by my attorney in San
Francisco that we were out," John
Pierini, business manager of
Construction General Laborers Union
Local 270 told the Daily yesterday.
"We may be on the ballot, but
we're definitly out," he said. The
organization was one of five originally
named by the National Labor
Relations Board as being eligible to
participate in an election in which
University maintenance, food service,
custodial workers and others will pick
a union to organize them.
NLRB Supervisory Attorney Walter
Kintz confirmed that the union had
notified the San Francisco office of
the NLRB that it wouldn't be

participating in the elction. The
Contruction Laborers apparently
failed to collect enough authorization
cards signed by Stanford employees to
give evidence of a "showing of
interest" whcih makes them ineligible
to compete with the other unions.
Another union stipulated as eligible
in the NLRB ruling, the Workers
Action Caucus, has disbanded and
won't join the campaign either.
While both the unions will be listed
on the ballot, the only three
organizations now competing for the
workers' votes are the United Stanford
Employees, the California School
Employees Association-Stanford
Employees Association and the
Teamsters. Both the USE and
CSEA-SEA have confirmed their
intentions to join in the election, while
Teamsters officials have been
unavailable for comment.
