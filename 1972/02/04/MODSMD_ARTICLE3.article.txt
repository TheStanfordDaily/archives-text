# Lyman Receives Petition
## Amsterdam Urges Mascot Change 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
University Ombudsman Lois
Amsterdam has recommended that
"any and all Stanford University use
of the Indian symbol should be
immediately disavowed and
permanently stopped."
In a letter to President Richard
Lyman yesterday, Amsterdam said
Stanford's continued use of the
symbol "brings up to visibility a
painful lack of sensitivity and
awareness on the part of the
University."
Her letter accompanied a petition
sent to her this week by native
American students asking for an end
to the Indian symbol.
The petition was signed by 55
native Americans here and charged
that continued use of the symbol
showed "non-Indian members of the
Stanford Community are not sensitive
to the 'humaness' of their native
American counterparts."
'Sympathy'
President Lyman could not be
reached for comment last night.
However, at a KZSU press conference
earlier this week he said he viewed the

native American request "with a good
deal of sympathy."
Native American Lorenzo Stars said
the recommendation was what he
"expected and hoped for."
The petition had also urged the
University to "fulfill its promise to the
students of its native American
program by improving and supporting
the program, and thereby making its
promise to improve native American
education a reality."
Concerning this request,
Amsterdam said she would make
specific recommendations within two
weeks because of this problem's
"greater complexity."
Special Need
But she did note that in her
investigation to date, she has found a
"need for special academic programs
and support."
Abandonment of the Indian symbol
now appears just about certain.
Negative reaction to the change has
been very mild. Alumni Director Tom
Newell said he had received only two
calls about the change so far. Earlier
this week he predicted alumni would
be "saddened" and "disappointed,"

but "not very upset" about the
change.
Acting Athletic Director Bob
Young said "I'm not very strong one
way or another. I realize there's a
minority problem involved."
Search Committee
Noting that a won-less record was
more important than a symbol, Buck
Club President Clark Graham of
Sacramento had said, "I don't expect
|a change] to be a hazard from a
fundraising standpoint," especially if
"people are really being hurt" by
sustained use of the image.
The Indian was adopted as the
Stanford symbol by the Executive
Committee of the Associated Students
around Big Game time in 1930.
Stanford's native Americans made
an appeal to have the school's symbol
changed last year. But they only
succeeded in changing the Indian from
a big-nosed caricature of a brave to a
chief.
Assistant to the President Bill Stone
said last night that President Lyman
was not in his office yesterday and
therefore probably had not seen
Amsterdam's recommendations.
Search Committee?
Thus it is not known what action
will be taken next concerning the
Stanford symbol. But Stone did
indicate the possibility of a small
committee being formed to examine
other mascot possibilities.
In her letter to Lyman, Amsterdam
suggests that a committee might be
appropriate to choose a new symbol
"but neither a committee nor the
input of popular opinion seems
approriate on the question whether
the University should cease to use a
debasing racial symbol."
In their petition to Amsterdam the
native Americans said, "no one would
show such an ignorance by choosing

the name The Jews' or 'The Negroes'
for a school team. ... Stanford has
placed the name of a race on its
entertainment.
There is little chance," it contines,
"that those who regard 'Indians' as a
team name will every realize the
importance of socio-economic
problems, the traditional life-styles,
and the religious practices which are
central to an understanding of today's
Indian people."
Prince Lightfoot and the dollies are
also criticized. The petition charges
that their performances are
"completely false," "ethnically
wrong," and that they "reinforce the
ignorant 'Hollywood stereotype' of
native Americans."

wrong," and that they "reinforce the
ignorant 'Hollywood stereotype' of
native Americans."
University Ombudsman Lois
Amsterdam has recommended that
"any and all Stanford University use
of the Indian symbol should be
immediately disavowed and
permanently stopped."
In a letter to President Richard
Lyman yesterday, Amsterdam said
Stanford's continued use of the
symbol "brings up to visibility a
painful lack of sensitivity and
awareness on the part of the
University."
Her letter accompanied a petition
sent to her this week by native
American students asking for an end
to the Indian symbol.
The petition was signed by 55
native Americans here and charged
that continued use of the symbol
showed "non-Indian members of the
Stanford Community are not sensitive
to the 'humaness' of their native
American counterparts."
'Sympathy'
President Lyman could not be
reached for comment last night.
However, at a KZSU press conference
earlier this week he said he viewed the

native American request "with a good
deal of sympathy."
Native American Lorenzo Stars said
the recommendation was what he
"expected and hoped for."
The petition had also urged the
University to "fulfill its promise to the
students of its native American
program by improving and supporting
the program, and thereby making its
promise to improve native American
education a reality."
Concerning this request,
Amsterdam said she would make
specific recommendations within two
weeks because of this problem's
"greater complexity."
Special Need
But she did note that in her
investigation to date, she has found a
"need for special academic programs
and support."
Abandonment of the Indian symbol
now appears just about certain.
Negative reaction to the change has
been very mild. Alumni Director Tom
Newell said he had received only two
calls about the change so far. Earlier
this week he predicted alumni would
be "saddened" and "disappointed,"

but "not very upset" about the
change.
Acting Athletic Director Bob
Young said "I'm not very strong one
way or another. I realize there's a
minority problem involved."
Search Committee
Noting that a won-less record was
more important than a symbol, Buck
Club President Clark Graham of
Sacramento had said, "I don't expect
|a change] to be a hazard from a
fundraising standpoint," especially if
"people are really being hurt" by
sustained use of the image.
The Indian was adopted as the
Stanford symbol by the Executive
Committee of the Associated Students
around Big Game time in 1930.
Stanford's native Americans made
an appeal to have the school's symbol
changed last year. But they only
succeeded in changing the Indian from
a big-nosed caricature of a brave to a
chief.
Assistant to the President Bill Stone
said last night that President Lyman
was not in his office yesterday and
therefore probably had not seen
Amsterdam's recommendations.
Search Committee?
Thus it is not known what action
will be taken next concerning the
Stanford symbol. But Stone did
indicate the possibility of a small
committee being formed to examine
other mascot possibilities.
In her letter to Lyman, Amsterdam
suggests that a committee might be
appropriate to choose a new symbol
"but neither a committee nor the
input of popular opinion seems
approriate on the question whether
the University should cease to use a
debasing racial symbol."
In their petition to Amsterdam the
native Americans said, "no one would
show such an ignorance by choosing

the name The Jews' or 'The Negroes'
for a school team. ... Stanford has
placed the name of a race on its
entertainment.
There is little chance," it contines,
"that those who regard 'Indians' as a
team name will every realize the
importance of socio-economic
problems, the traditional life-styles,
and the religious practices which are
central to an understanding of today's
Indian people."
Prince Lightfoot and the dollies are
also criticized. The petition charges
that their performances are
"completely false," "ethnically
wrong," and that they "reinforce the
ignorant 'Hollywood stereotype' of
native Americans."
