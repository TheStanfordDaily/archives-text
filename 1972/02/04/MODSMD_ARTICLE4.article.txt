# Meyer Library Windows Broken
## 
### 
Last night at approximately 11:00, rocks were thrown through six plate
glass windows and a set of double doors in the Meyer Library Forum Room.
The windows and doors are located on the north and west sides of the room.
A spokesman for the University estimated the damage at more than
$1,000. No arrests were reported. There were also reports of scattered
violence elsewhere on campus during the evening.
Witnesses who arrived at the scene at Meyer soon after the windows were
broken saw three persons running away from the library toward the
Bookstore.
The Forum Room is to be the site of the Campus Judicial Panel hearings
on the November 4 disruption at the Placement Center. The hearings are
scheduled to begin this morning.
