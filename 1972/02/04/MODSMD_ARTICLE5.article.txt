# Administrators Opposed Palo Alto For Davis Trial
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
When it appeared that the Angela Davis trial would be
held in Palo Alto, Stanford administrators warned county
officials that a trial here could turn the campus into a
gathering place for activists from throughout the country.
The Daily learned this week that administrators
contacted Santa Clara County officials during November
to warn them of what they called "the New Haven
analogy."
University officials feared that if the trial were held at
North County Courthouse, within a mile of the campus,
there would be an influx of activists—similar to the
protests and confrontations at Yale University during the
1970 trial of Black Panther Bobby Seale in New Haven.
"We did our best to do what we could to see that the
trial was held in San Jose," Vice Provost Robert
Rosenzweig confirmed Wednesday.
'Court Aware'
Superior Court Judge John Racanelli. presiding jurist
when the judges set the trial in San Jose, said the"court
was aware" of the Stanford fears through Santa Clara
County officials.
But Racanelli said Stanford's proximity to North
County "was not a major factor" in the selection of the
trial site.
Davis was moved to North County Dec. 2, a month
after the decision to change the site of her murder and
kidnapping trial from Marin to Santa Clara County. The
trial was expected to take place in Palo Alto until the
judges announced the San Jose site at the end of
December.
Lyman Visits Official
President Richard W. Lyman went to San Jose in
November to meet with County Executive Howard
Campen, the county's top administrator. Lyman said he
visited Campen when he learned that "some people did
not know about the New Haven situation. We just wanted

them to take into consideration that piece of history."
But the President insisted, "We were not pressuring
people to move the trial to San Jose. I was not pretending
to have an overall opinion of where the trial ought to be.
We were just pointing out one among what we recognized
were many factors going into making the decision."
"Dr. Lyman was very concerned about what some of
the consequences might be to the Stanford campus ... if
the trial went on at the North County facilities," Campen
recalled.
"I discussed the situation with Sheriff Geary and Judge
Racanelli," Campen added. "He certainly, I'm sure,
considered it. How much weight he gave it, I couldn't
begin to say."
Campen emphasized that the judges considered many
trial sites and scores of security problems before making
their decision.
Daughter at Yale
Lyman said he had "next to firsthand knowledge"
about the Yale situation because his daughter is a student
there. Yale had problems with hundreds of protesters who
used the campus as an organizing base during the Seale
trial, Lyman said.
Lyman conceded "they had more rumors than they
had actual people" coming on campus. But he said that
protesters came "from Boston and New York." The
visitors camped out in dormitories, and"Yale students
had to organize mass feeding kitchens," according to
Lyman.
"All the ingredients (at Yale) seemed to be here, or at
least some of them," Lyman's legal adviser James Siena
said. "But nobody was prepared to go out and say it was
bound to happen here; there are differences in place and
time."
LA, Portland
Siena said administrators expected a stream of people
