# Administrators Opposed Palo Alto For Davis Trial
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
When it appeared that the Angela Davis trial would be
held in Palo Alto, Stanford administrators warned county
officials that a trial here could turn the campus into a
gathering place for activists from throughout the country.
The Daily learned this week that administrators
contacted Santa Clara County officials during November
to warn them of what they called "the New Haven
analogy."
University officials feared that if the trial were held at
North County Courthouse, within a mile of the campus,
there would be an influx of activists—similar to the
protests and confrontations at Yale University during the
1970 trial of Black Panther Bobby Seale in New Haven.
"We did our best to do what we could to see that the
trial was held in San Jose," Vice Provost Robert
Rosenzweig confirmed Wednesday.
'Court Aware'
Superior Court Judge John Racanelli. presiding jurist
when the judges set the trial in San Jose, said the"court
was aware" of the Stanford fears through Santa Clara
County officials.
But Racanelli said Stanford's proximity to North
County "was not a major factor" in the selection of the
trial site.
Davis was moved to North County Dec. 2, a month
after the decision to change the site of her murder and
kidnapping trial from Marin to Santa Clara County. The
trial was expected to take place in Palo Alto until the
judges announced the San Jose site at the end of
December.
Lyman Visits Official
President Richard W. Lyman went to San Jose in
November to meet with County Executive Howard
Campen, the county's top administrator. Lyman said he
visited Campen when he learned that "some people did
not know about the New Haven situation. We just wanted

them to take into consideration that piece of history."
But the President insisted, "We were not pressuring
people to move the trial to San Jose. I was not pretending
to have an overall opinion of where the trial ought to be.
We were just pointing out one among what we recognized
were many factors going into making the decision."
"Dr. Lyman was very concerned about what some of
the consequences might be to the Stanford campus ... if
the trial went on at the North County facilities," Campen
recalled.
"I discussed the situation with Sheriff Geary and Judge
Racanelli," Campen added. "He certainly, I'm sure,
considered it. How much weight he gave it, I couldn't
begin to say."
Campen emphasized that the judges considered many
trial sites and scores of security problems before making
their decision.
Daughter at Yale
Lyman said he had "next to firsthand knowledge"
about the Yale situation because his daughter is a student
there. Yale had problems with hundreds of protesters who
used the campus as an organizing base during the Seale
trial, Lyman said.
Lyman conceded "they had more rumors than they
had actual people" coming on campus. But he said that
protesters came "from Boston and New York." The
visitors camped out in dormitories, and"Yale students
had to organize mass feeding kitchens," according to
Lyman.
"All the ingredients (at Yale) seemed to be here, or at
least some of them," Lyman's legal adviser James Siena
said. "But nobody was prepared to go out and say it was
bound to happen here; there are differences in place and
time."
LA, Portland
Siena said administrators expected a stream of people


PRESIDENT RICHARD LYMAN


ANGELA DAVIS
from "Southern California, Portland, etc." rather than
from the ghettos of East Palo Alto.
Freshman Charles Ogletree, chairman of Stanford's
Angela Davis Defense Committee, agreed yesterday that
"there would have been people from around the country
using Stanford as a focal point if the trial had been in Palo
Alto."
Presidential Assistant John Schwartz said that he and
University Relations official Frank Newman mentioned
the New Haven situation during a telephone discussion
with Victor Calvo, a member of the County Board of
Supervisors and a Stanford alumnus.
Schwartz said that during a discussion of other matters
he asked Calvo about the Yale situation without
"expressing any University preference" about the trial
site. (Calvo said the supervisors "never became a party to
the judges' discussion about where the case would be
tried.")
Many Upset
A number of administrators expressed their fears to
officials of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department,
which is handling security for the trial of the black
revolutionary.
Lyman revealed that he requested his meeting with
Campen after ar. adu ir.i./rator talked with Undersheriff
Tom Rosa and learned "that Rosa had never heard of the
New Haven situation. ... I was taken aback that they
hadn't even thought of all that when it was so vivid to all
of us."
But Lyman insisted he was not criticizing the Sheriff's
Department because educators need to be aware of such
national campus issues while law enforcement officials do
not.
'Lot of Considerations'
When Sheriff James Geary was told of the New Haven
analogy, "he made the point that there are a lot of
considerations to be taken into account besides the
proximity of North County courthouse," according to
Siena.
Geary said he told Siena "that I had heard reports that
Stanford was overly concerned."
The Sheriff added that he argued Stanford would not
pose problems as a rallying point "anymore than would
San Jose State," located in San Jose.
There have been no major problems thus far on the San
Jose campus, Geary said, and he "didn't anticipate any

trouble from Stanford either" if the trial had been held at
North County.
San Jose Not Likely
However, Rosenzweig told the Daily that San Jose
State was less likely to become a "staging area. They
don't have significant dorm space. It's a commuter
college. San Jose is bigger than Palo Alto; things get
absorbed there easier."
Rosenzweig said he discussed these differences with
San Jose State President John Bunzel and recalled: "Jack
was not happy at the prospect of having the trial there."
Stanford's fears did not please the Sheriff's
department. "We had every indication that the Sheriff was
very unhappy with us on this," Rosenzweig commented.
"That's no secret. We were all very surprised that the trial
was not held here."
Geary believed that North County was the most secure
location and reportedly had begun to prepare the facilities
for a trial there.
"As you are well aware, the Sheriff was in favor of
having it in the North County facility," County Executive
Campen commented yesterday.
Racanelli Aware
In a telephone interview, Judge Racanelli said
yesterday that the judges were aware of "the
administration's views on the campus, as related to
Stanford vis-a-vis the Palo Alto facility."
But he emphasized, "there were far more important
factors, (which) regarded the kind of security
arrangements" (at the trial site).
"It was the limitation of the Palo Alto facility,"
Racanelli commented. "The security conditions of the
defendant and the security of her as a party to a suit
which has every character of being a long one, certainly
were very much considered."
The judge said the Palo Alto location is a single
building containing both offices and courts, while the
building being used in San Jose's government complex "is
a regular facility for criminal trials, which lent itself far
more feasibly to a lengthy trial of this nature than any
other facility in the county."
Racanelli suggested that Geary, in his preference for
Palo Alto, may not have been aware of "special problems
which maybe were not his responsibility initially," and
which "involved the management of the long proceeding."
The judge also said a county official pointed out that
major trials involving possible capital punishment are
normally held in the county seat, in this case San Jose.

had actual people" coming on campus. But he said that
protesters came "from Boston and New York." The
visitors camped out in dormitories, and"Yale students
had to organize mass feeding kitchens," according to
Lyman.
"All the ingredients (at Yale) seemed to be here, or at
least some of them," Lyman's legal adviser James Siena
said. "But nobody was prepared to go out and say it was
bound to happen here; there are differences in place and
time."
LA, Portland
Siena said administrators expected a stream of people


PRESIDENT RICHARD LYMAN


ANGELA DAVIS
from "Southern California, Portland, etc." rather than
from the ghettos of East Palo Alto.
Freshman Charles Ogletree, chairman of Stanford's
Angela Davis Defense Committee, agreed yesterday that
"there would have been people from around the country
using Stanford as a focal point if the trial had been in Palo
Alto."
Presidential Assistant John Schwartz said that he and
University Relations official Frank Newman mentioned
the New Haven situation during a telephone discussion
with Victor Calvo, a member of the County Board of
Supervisors and a Stanford alumnus.
Schwartz said that during a discussion of other matters
he asked Calvo about the Yale situation without
"expressing any University preference" about the trial
site. (Calvo said the supervisors "never became a party to
the judges' discussion about where the case would be
tried.")
Many Upset
A number of administrators expressed their fears to
officials of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department,
which is handling security for the trial of the black
revolutionary.
Lyman revealed that he requested his meeting with
Campen after ar. adu ir.i./rator talked with Undersheriff
Tom Rosa and learned "that Rosa had never heard of the
New Haven situation. ... I was taken aback that they
hadn't even thought of all that when it was so vivid to all
of us."
But Lyman insisted he was not criticizing the Sheriff's
Department because educators need to be aware of such
national campus issues while law enforcement officials do
not.
'Lot of Considerations'
When Sheriff James Geary was told of the New Haven
analogy, "he made the point that there are a lot of
considerations to be taken into account besides the
proximity of North County courthouse," according to
Siena.
Geary said he told Siena "that I had heard reports that
Stanford was overly concerned."
The Sheriff added that he argued Stanford would not
pose problems as a rallying point "anymore than would
San Jose State," located in San Jose.
There have been no major problems thus far on the San
Jose campus, Geary said, and he "didn't anticipate any

trouble from Stanford either" if the trial had been held at
North County.
San Jose Not Likely
However, Rosenzweig told the Daily that San Jose
State was less likely to become a "staging area. They
don't have significant dorm space. It's a commuter
college. San Jose is bigger than Palo Alto; things get
absorbed there easier."
Rosenzweig said he discussed these differences with
San Jose State President John Bunzel and recalled: "Jack
was not happy at the prospect of having the trial there."
Stanford's fears did not please the Sheriff's
department. "We had every indication that the Sheriff was
very unhappy with us on this," Rosenzweig commented.
"That's no secret. We were all very surprised that the trial
was not held here."
Geary believed that North County was the most secure
location and reportedly had begun to prepare the facilities
for a trial there.
"As you are well aware, the Sheriff was in favor of
having it in the North County facility," County Executive
Campen commented yesterday.
Racanelli Aware
In a telephone interview, Judge Racanelli said
yesterday that the judges were aware of "the
administration's views on the campus, as related to
Stanford vis-a-vis the Palo Alto facility."
But he emphasized, "there were far more important
factors, (which) regarded the kind of security
arrangements" (at the trial site).
"It was the limitation of the Palo Alto facility,"
Racanelli commented. "The security conditions of the
defendant and the security of her as a party to a suit
which has every character of being a long one, certainly
were very much considered."
The judge said the Palo Alto location is a single
building containing both offices and courts, while the
building being used in San Jose's government complex "is
a regular facility for criminal trials, which lent itself far
more feasibly to a lengthy trial of this nature than any
other facility in the county."
Racanelli suggested that Geary, in his preference for
Palo Alto, may not have been aware of "special problems
which maybe were not his responsibility initially," and
which "involved the management of the long proceeding."
The judge also said a county official pointed out that
major trials involving possible capital punishment are
normally held in the county seat, in this case San Jose.
When it appeared that the Angela Davis trial would be
held in Palo Alto, Stanford administrators warned county
officials that a trial here could turn the campus into a
gathering place for activists from throughout the country.
The Daily learned this week that administrators
contacted Santa Clara County officials during November
to warn them of what they called "the New Haven
analogy."
University officials feared that if the trial were held at
North County Courthouse, within a mile of the campus,
there would be an influx of activists—similar to the
protests and confrontations at Yale University during the
1970 trial of Black Panther Bobby Seale in New Haven.
"We did our best to do what we could to see that the
trial was held in San Jose," Vice Provost Robert
Rosenzweig confirmed Wednesday.
'Court Aware'
Superior Court Judge John Racanelli. presiding jurist
when the judges set the trial in San Jose, said the"court
was aware" of the Stanford fears through Santa Clara
County officials.
But Racanelli said Stanford's proximity to North
County "was not a major factor" in the selection of the
trial site.
Davis was moved to North County Dec. 2, a month
after the decision to change the site of her murder and
kidnapping trial from Marin to Santa Clara County. The
trial was expected to take place in Palo Alto until the
judges announced the San Jose site at the end of
December.
Lyman Visits Official
President Richard W. Lyman went to San Jose in
November to meet with County Executive Howard
Campen, the county's top administrator. Lyman said he
visited Campen when he learned that "some people did
not know about the New Haven situation. We just wanted

them to take into consideration that piece of history."
But the President insisted, "We were not pressuring
people to move the trial to San Jose. I was not pretending
to have an overall opinion of where the trial ought to be.
We were just pointing out one among what we recognized
were many factors going into making the decision."
"Dr. Lyman was very concerned about what some of
the consequences might be to the Stanford campus ... if
the trial went on at the North County facilities," Campen
recalled.
"I discussed the situation with Sheriff Geary and Judge
Racanelli," Campen added. "He certainly, I'm sure,
considered it. How much weight he gave it, I couldn't
begin to say."
Campen emphasized that the judges considered many
trial sites and scores of security problems before making
their decision.
Daughter at Yale
Lyman said he had "next to firsthand knowledge"
about the Yale situation because his daughter is a student
there. Yale had problems with hundreds of protesters who
used the campus as an organizing base during the Seale
trial, Lyman said.
Lyman conceded "they had more rumors than they
had actual people" coming on campus. But he said that
protesters came "from Boston and New York." The
visitors camped out in dormitories, and"Yale students
had to organize mass feeding kitchens," according to
Lyman.

don't have significant dorm space. It's a commuter
college. San Jose is bigger than Palo Alto; things get
absorbed there easier."
Rosenzweig said he discussed these differences with
San Jose State President John Bunzel and recalled: "Jack
was not happy at the prospect of having the trial there."
Stanford's fears did not please the Sheriff's
department. "We had every indication that the Sheriff was
very unhappy with us on this," Rosenzweig commented.
"That's no secret. We were all very surprised that the trial
was not held here."
Geary believed that North County was the most secure
location and reportedly had begun to prepare the facilities
for a trial there.
"As you are well aware, the Sheriff was in favor of
having it in the North County facility," County Executive
Campen commented yesterday.
Racanelli Aware
In a telephone interview, Judge Racanelli said
yesterday that the judges were aware of "the
administration's views on the campus, as related to
Stanford vis-a-vis the Palo Alto facility."
But he emphasized, "there were far more important
factors, (which) regarded the kind of security
arrangements" (at the trial site).
"It was the limitation of the Palo Alto facility,"
Racanelli commented. "The security conditions of the
defendant and the security of her as a party to a suit
which has every character of being a long one, certainly
were very much considered."
The judge said the Palo Alto location is a single
building containing both offices and courts, while the
building being used in San Jose's government complex "is
a regular facility for criminal trials, which lent itself far
more feasibly to a lengthy trial of this nature than any
other facility in the county."
Racanelli suggested that Geary, in his preference for
Palo Alto, may not have been aware of "special problems
which maybe were not his responsibility initially," and
which "involved the management of the long proceeding."
The judge also said a county official pointed out that
major trials involving possible capital punishment are
normally held in the county seat, in this case San Jose.
When it appeared that the Angela Davis trial would be
held in Palo Alto, Stanford administrators warned county
officials that a trial here could turn the campus into a
gathering place for activists from throughout the country.
The Daily learned this week that administrators
contacted Santa Clara County officials during November
to warn them of what they called "the New Haven
analogy."
University officials feared that if the trial were held at
North County Courthouse, within a mile of the campus,
there would be an influx of activists—similar to the
protests and confrontations at Yale University during the
1970 trial of Black Panther Bobby Seale in New Haven.
"We did our best to do what we could to see that the
trial was held in San Jose," Vice Provost Robert
Rosenzweig confirmed Wednesday.
'Court Aware'
Superior Court Judge John Racanelli. presiding jurist
when the judges set the trial in San Jose, said the"court
was aware" of the Stanford fears through Santa Clara
County officials.
But Racanelli said Stanford's proximity to North
County "was not a major factor" in the selection of the
trial site.
Davis was moved to North County Dec. 2, a month
after the decision to change the site of her murder and
kidnapping trial from Marin to Santa Clara County. The
trial was expected to take place in Palo Alto until the
judges announced the San Jose site at the end of
December.
Lyman Visits Official
President Richard W. Lyman went to San Jose in
November to meet with County Executive Howard
Campen, the county's top administrator. Lyman said he
visited Campen when he learned that "some people did
not know about the New Haven situation. We just wanted

them to take into consideration that piece of history."
But the President insisted, "We were not pressuring
people to move the trial to San Jose. I was not pretending
to have an overall opinion of where the trial ought to be.
We were just pointing out one among what we recognized
were many factors going into making the decision."
"Dr. Lyman was very concerned about what some of
the consequences might be to the Stanford campus ... if
the trial went on at the North County facilities," Campen
recalled.
"I discussed the situation with Sheriff Geary and Judge
Racanelli," Campen added. "He certainly, I'm sure,
considered it. How much weight he gave it, I couldn't
begin to say."
Campen emphasized that the judges considered many
trial sites and scores of security problems before making
their decision.
Daughter at Yale
Lyman said he had "next to firsthand knowledge"
about the Yale situation because his daughter is a student
there. Yale had problems with hundreds of protesters who
used the campus as an organizing base during the Seale
trial, Lyman said.
Lyman conceded "they had more rumors than they
had actual people" coming on campus. But he said that
protesters came "from Boston and New York." The
visitors camped out in dormitories, and"Yale students
had to organize mass feeding kitchens," according to
Lyman.
"All the ingredients (at Yale) seemed to be here, or at
least some of them," Lyman's legal adviser James Siena
said. "But nobody was prepared to go out and say it was
bound to happen here; there are differences in place and
time."
LA, Portland
Siena said administrators expected a stream of people


PRESIDENT RICHARD LYMAN


ANGELA DAVIS
from "Southern California, Portland, etc." rather than
from the ghettos of East Palo Alto.
Freshman Charles Ogletree, chairman of Stanford's
Angela Davis Defense Committee, agreed yesterday that
"there would have been people from around the country
using Stanford as a focal point if the trial had been in Palo
Alto."
Presidential Assistant John Schwartz said that he and
University Relations official Frank Newman mentioned
the New Haven situation during a telephone discussion
with Victor Calvo, a member of the County Board of
Supervisors and a Stanford alumnus.
Schwartz said that during a discussion of other matters
he asked Calvo about the Yale situation without
"expressing any University preference" about the trial
site. (Calvo said the supervisors "never became a party to
the judges' discussion about where the case would be
tried.")
Many Upset
A number of administrators expressed their fears to
officials of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department,
which is handling security for the trial of the black
revolutionary.
Lyman revealed that he requested his meeting with
Campen after ar. adu ir.i./rator talked with Undersheriff
Tom Rosa and learned "that Rosa had never heard of the
New Haven situation. ... I was taken aback that they
hadn't even thought of all that when it was so vivid to all
of us."
But Lyman insisted he was not criticizing the Sheriff's
Department because educators need to be aware of such
national campus issues while law enforcement officials do
not.
'Lot of Considerations'
When Sheriff James Geary was told of the New Haven
analogy, "he made the point that there are a lot of
considerations to be taken into account besides the
proximity of North County courthouse," according to
Siena.
Geary said he told Siena "that I had heard reports that
Stanford was overly concerned."
The Sheriff added that he argued Stanford would not
pose problems as a rallying point "anymore than would
San Jose State," located in San Jose.
There have been no major problems thus far on the San
Jose campus, Geary said, and he "didn't anticipate any

trouble from Stanford either" if the trial had been held at
North County.
