# alters fundamental rights
## CJP An Unauthorized System 
### 
A major political trial begins
Friday morning at 9:30 in the
Meyer Library Forum Room
under the new student judicial
system created this fall by
President Lyman. This system,
called the Campus Judicial Panel,
has no authority as it is
constituted. President Lyman is
not authorized to unilaterally
institute a new judicial procedure,
nor is he authorized to alter
fundamental student rights.
In 1902, Mrs. Jane Stanford
made an amendment to the
University trusts, to assure
students that they would be
treated by traditional elementary
principles of justice, which read,
"It shall be the duty of the Board
of Trustees to make general laws
providing for the government of
the University, and to provide for
just and equitable rules of
discipline."
In accordance with this, the
Board of Trustees delegated its
full power to provide for "just
and equitable rules of discipline"
for students through the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968.
The LJC was created by the
joint approval of a student
referendum, the Academic
Council and the president. In fact,
it was then seen as necessary to
have such a tri-partite agreement
to assure "just and equitable rules
of discipline." Amendments to
the LJC can come only through
approval by the student

legislature, Academic Council, and
President.
The Charter provided for four
things: 1) the Student Conduct
Legislative Council, a tri partite
committee empowered to initiate
student conduct legislation; 2) the
Stanford Judicial Council; 3)
amendment of the Charter only
by joint agreement of students,
faculty, and administration; 4)
residual authority of the President
to promulgate regulations over
student conduct.
Two Points
There are two points to be
made which demonstrate that
President Lyman's exercise of his
"emergency power" to create the
new Campus Judicial Panel was
without authority according to
the university trusts and the LJC.
First, the Article IV provision in
the LJC granting residual
authority to the president can
only grant such powers as are
"just and equitable." And, these
powers are defined by Articles I,
11, and 111 of the LJC listed in the
paragraph before. These three
articles show a preference for
action by students, faculty and
administration jointly, after
initiative by the SCLC.
Even assuming that an
emergency existed, President
Lyman was required by LJC
section 102b to go to the SCLC to
get his proposals through. There
was ample time to do so. But
Professor Home, Lyman's
appointee and chairman of the

placement center defense collective

SCLC, refused to convene that
committee despite repeated
attempts by student members to
have the committee consider
proposals for reform of the SJC
submitted by the student body.
Lyman did not attempt to bring
his proposal to that body.
Second, assuming that Lyman
had authority to take some
unilateral action, he did not have
authority to fundamentally alter
or expand the powers of the
judicial system.
There are two sub-points to
this: First, President Lyman's
residual authority does not
include the power to amend the
LJC—and its extensive provisions
for the SJC—which is granted only
to joint approval by students,
faculty, and administration. That
President Lyman's proposed CJP
extends beyond the SJC described
in the Charter is demonstrated in
the next section.
The corollary to this point is
that if a defect existed (in this
case a lack of student members
for the SJC), the president had
authority to only remedy the
defect.
Absolute Authority
If these interpretations do not
apply, then we might as well
simply admit that the president
has absolute authority over
students and deal with things
from that perspective.
Not only was altering the
judicial system beyond the
president's power, but by making
that change, he has usurped rights
of students in the following areas:
under the new system, the
discretion of the chairman is
increased, while student control is
lessened; the fact-finding process
excludes students; areas like
sentencing and privilege against
self-incrimination remain
unclarified; the subpoena power
of the university prosecutor is
apparently increased; and the
randomness of the selection
process is suspect.
Under CJP procedures (Section
11 of the regulation) a hearing
shall be open unless the student
and chairman agree. Under the
SJC (11. F. 6) the hearing could be
open only at defendants' request.
The chairman did not participate
in the decision that the hearing be
open or closed. The defendant's
right to decide on this question
was important because tapes of
the proceeding and police agents
in the courtroom could be used
later for court prosecution.
Bifurcated
Under the new system the
fact-finding process is separated
from the application of the "law"
and the sentencing. Under this
bifurcated system, student rights
are reduced because the facts are
found by a hearing officer who
serves at the pleasure of the
university. This hearing officer has
complete discretion to determine
what evidence is relevant to his
findings of fact. Under the SJC,
which has four student members,

that body determined the facts. In
the courts, a defendant has a right
to a trail by a jury of his peers;
and it is this jury that finds the
facts.
Sentencing procedure remains
unclarified under this new
bifurcated svstem.
Moreover, the CJP reserves the
right (section 21) to consider the
likelihood of "similar misconduct
in the future." From what
standards may they determine this
definition of "rehabilitation"?
Under the old system, such
witnesses could testify as to
mitigation and motivation before
the convened SJC.
Another unclarified area is the
privilege against self-incrimination
for witnesses. Under CJP (7d)
only the defendant may
specifically claim this privilege.
SJC rule D.6 specifically provided
that a student witness, as well as a
defendant, could refuse to give
testimony which would
incriminate him.
The former system allowed a
challenge to panel members for
alleged bias; there is no such
provision under the new system.
The defendant also had an
absolute right to challenge the
jurisdiction of the Board, another
right which has slipped away
under present rules.
The subpoena power of the
university prosecutor is also
apparently increased, as evidenced
by the conduct in Rafas Roble's
trial, where a student was
threatened with disciplinary
action for refusal to testify. Under
the SJC, only a defendant could
be punished for refusal to
cooperate (section E).
Random?
Finally, consider that students
were allegedly selected at random
to replace the SJC procedure,
where students were appointed by
the elected student senate. Yet 50
percent of the four selected
students (three CJP members plus
one alternate) are law students.
The law school student body is
four percent of the university
population.
Finally, transcending all the
procedural objections, is the fact
that the new procedures move the
judicial aspect of decision-making
even farther away from the
community whose conduct is to
be regulated.
Others have called attention to
the fact that the university
prosecutes those who protest
genocide but insists on an "open
campus" for its perpetrators.
Perhaps this explains why the
administration initiated a
wholesale revision—and
reduction—of student rights rather
than simply appointing four
"random" students to the SJC.
