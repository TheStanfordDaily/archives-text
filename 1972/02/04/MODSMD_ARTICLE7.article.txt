# KKK's Statement On Shockley
## 
### 
Yesterday the newly
rejuvenated Stanford Chapter of
the Ku Klux Klan dressed in
uniforms of white sheets marched
to William Shockley's class to
bestow on him recognition for his
furthering of racism and genocide.
When he came into his class the
Chapter cheered and presented
him with a large wooden cross and
a bonus award of a free
sterilization at the hospital of his
choice.
Our satirizing stopped abruptly
when a black student in
Shockley's class began to talk
about his own experience with
Shockley's racism.
The student explained that last
Tuesday Shockley told him to
become an auditor of the class or
risk flunking it. In addition,
Shockley suggested that "some
people just aren't fit for certain
professions." The student was so

shaken by this discussion with
Shockley that he left his room on
campus and moved into a motel
and moreover he had to take
medication from Cowell.
Shockley however, disagreed
with the student's interpretation
of the conversation. It was
revealed that the conversation had
been taped and it was suggested
that the tape be played for all
those present. Shockley refused.
At this time, the assistant
chairman of the electrical
engineering department declared
our activity a disruption, and the
Santa Clara County Sheriffs were
summoned.
Although we know we had
done nothing illegal (President
Lyman had said on KZSU the
night before that classroom
disruptions were not punishable
by law), we decided to leave, but
we promised to return next week

to see if the student's grievance
had been satisfactorily cleared up.
We left the building and stopped
for a few moments outside the
entrance. At that time, some ten
Sheriff's deputies marched from
the building and charged our
group, although, and 1 repeat, we
had done nothing illegal. Six
people were arrested and charged
with disturbing the peace (we
never raised our voices!), trespass
(we were never told we were
trespassing), and wearing a mask
while committing a misdemeanor.
Yesterday, we learned that
humor and peaceful protest
against the war in Indochina and
racism at home will no longer be
tolerated at Stanford. And, more
concretely, we've learned it will
take more than awards and
costumes to stop Shockley.
