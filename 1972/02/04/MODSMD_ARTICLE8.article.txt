# my turmoil for today
## Delusions Of The Franklin Decision 
### 
Franklin is fired. And the dust
will not settle. Good. Certain
forms of tranquility are
uncomfortably close to death. But
today the turmoil I feel seems
mine alone.
According to the doubtful
record, H. Bruce Franklin has
been dismissed from his tenured
position at Stanford University
for intentionally urging and
inciting demonstrators to occupy
the Computation Center, to
ignore a police order to disperse,
and to engage in disruptive
behavior.
Forget for a moment the issues
of academic freedom and freedom
of speech. For me the university's
decision is based on two very
serious delusions:
First, it seems the
self-deceiving action of a vain and
aristocratic beast refusing to
recognize its imminent extinction.
There is no question here of the
"proper uses of the university."
By dismissing Franklin, Stanford
is simply trying to save itself — its
property, its employment, its
revenues, its scholarship — and
whatever power and status those
resources currently claim for it.
The increasing urgency of our
problems with privilege and
poverty, the newer concepts of
the educational enterprise, will
eventually dismantle private
institutions like Stanford whether
it resists it or not.

Second, and more important
for me, in its death-throes I hear
Stanford once more announcing
that it has assumed the obligation
of protecting me from myself.
What arrogance! This rankles me
to the core. In loco parentis,
Stanford insists on maintaining
the right to keep me safe from
influences it considers devisive,
from men who might move me to
action for which I might be made
to suffer (or benefit?)
It is the same self-serving
assumption that has plagued us all
since our births. Parents and
politicians, prophets and priests
all seem to seek their own
preservation by imposing upon us
their idea of our responsibility to
ourselves: what it is we should not
hear, red, do, be.
Will there ever come a day
when I will be allowed the dignity
to decide my own fate? Or will I
always be considered somewhat of
a child by still one more
self-appointed surrogate parent, or
the latest dogma, or the next
institution supposedly designed to
serve me — but always so quick to
impose its authority in order to
keep itself intact? I loathe the
least instance of this implicit
mistrust in my capacity to think
and feel properly for myself!
Obligation
But here's the rub: For, if I
feel this sense of responsibility to
my own integrity, mustn't 1

assume a harsher obligation than
any administrative decision might
impose? In denouncing Stanford's
assumption that Father Knows
Best, I feel the need to be damned
sure that / know better.
Therefore, 1 must listen so much
more closely, weigh the issues so
much more thoroughly, and
search out the deepest meaning of
my heart's responses until a
reliably informed and defenseless
honesty allows me to choose my
course of action.
And assuming I have somehow
escaped Stanford's insulting
supervision, doesn't it follow that
I must also carefully scrutinize the
offer of someone as provocative as
H. Bruce Franklin in order to
avoid losing my integrity to yet
another set of self-serving
illusions?
My turmoil deepens: I stand in
White Plaza, and in my
socio-political ignorance I thrill to
Franklin's analysis of the
American past. Yes, yes, I agree!
We stole it all from the Indians.
At least I know more about it
than my Russian immigrant
grandmother. So shouldn't I do
something about it? Sure. But
suddenly I feel the need to know
myself even more thoroughly in
order to be better able to separate
insight from invective. And the
alternatives 1 hear offered — are
they quite accurate? Those
"people" they're always talking
about — who are they? Are they
me? Am I included? I hope so.
But I'm not so sure.
Think
I feel the need now to go back
to my books, to think a lot longer
about these things before I sit-in
at the Union, to feel my way into
the truth of my existence because
I sense that Franklin really is
trying to move me to risk the very
direction of my life for an
inspiring ideal.
Is it my ideal, though? I
remember those dreary

disillusioned middle-aged lady
communists in Doris Lessing's
books who come to feel they've
wasted their entire lives in pursuit
of a goal they will never live to see
remotely realized. Do I have
better faith? Are there enough
strokes in self-sacrifice to satisfy
me? Besides, knowing fuli well my
middle-class origins, my casual
acquaintance with my Jewish
heritage, my own heavy set of
Portnoy's Complaints, how clearly
will I ever be able to see the
objective issues outside my
subjective skin° 1 was born in the
same crummy borough as
Franklin. So I feel an affinity.
And an aversion for what I think I
know much too well. Personality
intrudes. Projections: his doggy
look annoys me — I see the
bloodhounds after Bambi. Lyman
at bay. Sure, the emperor has no
clothes, but his nakedness makes
me want to give him my scarf —
until Voltaire comes along to
make me sign petitions and checks
in Defense of Bruce.
Oh, it's rough to know where
to expend one's limited energy.
Take the long view or the short?
The long so easily leads to
Hamlet's wordy inertia, or if
you're lucky, to Gautama's silent
grace. And if I don't move my ass
soon surely some Franklin-ophile
will make it tough for me to live
with myself by labeling me a
'fascist liberal.' Damn it, I don't
want to be accused of 'copping
out' just because I won't be easily
coerced by someone else's passion
for his version of justice. I'm
having enough trouble holding on
to my own passionate
responsibility to my own essential
truth. Or is my individuality one
more capitalist myth?
Mind-Fuck
"You can cut through all that
mind-fucking crap," I hear some
Venceremos say, "by joining our
struggle for liberation. By joining
the cause, you will be liberated!"
Wow. Stirring words. So, my
salvation can be assured in my
struggle for salvation. Sisyphus
should have been so lucky.
Once again I'm left shaking.
The goals of the group — any
group — are bound to deaden me
to myself, aren't they? The

Michael rubin

demand of the group is always so
great: the sacrifice of self-interest,
the code of behavior required, the
costume, all those drill-nights
working at the blackboard to
figure out the next tactical
maneuver like a football squad.
Hell, where am / in that huddle.
I'm afraid I've donned some
depersonalizing helmet, some
wooden mask in the interests of
some cheap illusion of
immortality, that awful lie that
one's security is achieved in a
circle of clenched fists and a loud
communal shout.
But the capitalist-pig war
grinds on and I've been on all the
marches. My guts cry out for
more direct action too. I try to
read Marx again. An impossible
job for me. I give it up for
Marcuse. Find myself drawn to
Kropotkin and Emma Goldman.
Is utter anarchy the answer? Find
myself putting it all aside for
Krishnamurti and The Primal
Scream. And all the while I'm
wondering if, short of living on a
few berries and nuts, is there
really any honest way to earn my
next meal?
