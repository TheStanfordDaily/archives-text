Compulsory Education
In an article entitled
"Compulsory Education: The
Plain People Resist," in the
January 15 Saturday Review,
Stephen Arons writes about the
conflict between the Amish and
the government's compulsory
schooling laws:
"In September of 1968, Jonas
Yoder and two other Amish
residents of Wisconsin refused,
because of their religious beliefs,
to send their children to high
school. In so doing, they exposed
themselves to criminal
prosecution and possible prison
sentences for defying the state's
compulsory attendance law.
"In December 1971, the
United States Supreme Court
heard oral arguments on whether
or not Wisconsin may
constitutionally limit the free
exercise of religion by means of a
compulsory school law
"In their simple act of
conscience, the Amish defendants
raised another major issue in the
conflict between state power and
individual freedom."
Arons goes on to note that
although "both parties in the case
(Wisconsin v. Yoder) have been at
pains to insist that no general
challenge to compulsory
education" is being presented by
the desire of the Amish to be
exempt from the compulsory

attendance laws, still "the case
does, in fact, call into question
the entire rationale for
compulsory schooling."
Commenting on the Wisconsin
v. Yoder case, Fred M. Hechinger
wrote in the January 16 New
York Times: "The charge is made
that compuslory education,
instead of being a protection of
children's rights, is a means of
making them servants of the state
and its economic and political
establishment.
"This liberal view sees
compulsory education not as a
way of creating good citizens for
harmonious association in a
democracy but as a tool with
which to repress both
individualism and the dissident
claims and heritage of minorities."
Hechinger is, of course, in
favor of "creating good citizens
for harmonious association in a
democracy." He trots out two
favorite arguments for
compulsory schooling--the
government's need for a socialized
citizenry informed in
government-run or
government-approved schools as
to their duties in the political
process and the bogey of child
labor.
It has turned out that Stephen
Arons, despite his generally
excellent treatment of the issues
in his Saturday Review article,
never really faces the fundamental
question of the rationale for
compulsory schooling. In a letter
which appears in the February 1
New York Times, Arons calls for
an exemption for the Amish and
then says:"The answer for the
rest of us is not the elimination of
compulsory schooling but the
diversification of values expressed
in schools."
I think both Hechinger and
Arons are wrong. The Amish are
right in saying they should not be
forced to attend school.
In the concern for the
particular way of life of the
Amish, however, the universal
victimization inherent in
go ve r n m en t a 11 y - controlled
education becomes obscured. The
only satisfactory solution to the
school question is abolition of the
public school system and of
compulsory attendance laws.
Aside from the important fact
that taxation (to fund state
schools) and compulsory

attendance are coercive in nature,
there is the problem of the
political state as the teacher of
morality.
This problem is prominently in
the foreground in the case of the
Amish. But it is really just as
much a problem for all other
parents and children.
Zachariah Montgomery in his
anti-public-school classic, Poison
Drops in the Federal Senate (just
reprinted by Arno Press and the
New York Times), points out that
children spend a great deal of
their time in school, and although
children do not have fully
developed moral beliefs of their
own, they are exposed to moral
beliefs considered acceptable by
the school authorities, but not
necessarily by their parents.
Instead of constant battles for
political control of the public
schools—battles over sex
education, prayer-reading,
flag-saluting, compulsory
attendance of ghetto youth and
Amish or whatever—the public
school system should simply be
ended.
Draft Amnesty
The January 10 Time
magazine's "Time Essay" on
amnesty for draft resisters and
deserters was a good example of
how not to discuss an issue.
First, Time's treatment of the
issue is harmed by a failure to

discuss the fundamental question
of what morally makes a crime a
crime.
Looking at this logically prior
question is a prerequisite to a
consideration of the question of
pardons and amnesty.
If we see crimes as violations of
individual rights then
non-cooperators with the draft
and draft-induced exiles have
committed statute-created
"crimes" without victims.
The only victims in the
conscription system are the
draftees. And since the only
persons who have a basis in right
in forgiving trespasses and
granting pardons are victims (not
government officials), it is the
operators and advocates of the
draft system who should in all
justice be begging the pardon of
the victims of this sytem of
involuntary servitude.
Secondly, nowhere does the
Time Essay discuss the political
nature of the crime of desertion.
A shoe repairman who quits work
or decides to enter another
occupation is not punished for
desertion.
Thirdly, the Time Essay claims
that Henry David Thoreau
believed that conscientious
objectors to unjust laws should
take their medicine and accept the
government's punishment of
them. This was not Thoreau's
position.
As Harry Kalven wrote in a
Center for the Study of
Democratic Institutions booklet
on civil disobedience, Thoreau
"says nothing about what some of
us take as a special morality in
civil disobedience—the need to
accept the punishment. He goes to
jail, but he goes because he cannot
figure out any way of getting out
of going. He offers no theory
about the propriety of going or
not going to jail; it just happens."
Fourthly, the Time Essay raises
an issue of equity by saying that
some men fought and died and
others escaped. Was this fair? The
unvoiced assumption here is that
those who went to Canada or
Sweden forced others to fight in
their place and thus become
jeopardized.
But this assumption ignores
who is really forcing whom in the
conscription system. It is the
government which forces men
into the army, not their fellow

draftees.
Fifthly, by focusing on
whether Sen. Robert Taft's partial
amnesty is politically expedient at
the present time (an important
tactical question), the Time Essay
ignores the fact that Taft's bill
perpetuates the conscription
principle by requiring that
returning draft resisters spend
three years in military or civilian
governmental service.
Representative Bella Abzug has
authored a bill providing for
unconditional amnesty.
Finally, the unjust nature of
American military intervention in
Indochina has a lot more bearing
than Time magazine seems to
realize on whether or not it is
correct for someone to desert or
resist conscription. Would we not
consider that Adolf Eichmann (a
volunteer for his job, not a
draftee) would have lived a more
honorable life if halfway through
his career he had decided that
what he was doing was wrong or
even unpleasant and had quit?
Gun Control
Recent issues of Guns & Ammo
magazine have had good coverage
of efforts to suppress Americans'
rights to keep and bear arms.
The January issue says: "Sen.
Philip A. Hart (D—Mich.) is
sponsoring what is probably the
toughest (gun control) bill now
pending in Congress. It would
outlaw private ownership of
pistols and revolvers after giving
citizens 180 days to sell their
weapons to the government 'for a
fair price.' After this period, any
unauthorized person with a
handgun in his possession would
be subject to a jail term of five
years and/or a fine of up to
$5000."
In the February issue, a letter
to the editor points out that "our
police departments are basically
apprehenders, not preventers or
protectors. ... The police—no
matter how hard they try—cannot
protect us, and now the anti-gun
nuts want to deprive us of the
right to protect ourselves."
An prticle by Harlon Carter in
the same issue attacks moderation
or compromise on matters of
principle. Carter points out
standing up for one's true position
shifts the grounds of debate and
forces the compromisers to move
in one's direction. Carter is also
forthright in stating what he
considers to be the goals of gun
control proponents:
"Our opponents intend to
eliminate the private possession of
firearms in this country, as in
Europe, except by the landed and
the politically and economically
privileged classes—and,
unfortunately, by the criminals."
A proper resolution of the
present controversy over guns
both in Palo Alto and elsewhere
would be one which upholds the
right to keep and bear arms.
People have a right to self-defense
against criminals (whether
common crooks or political
tyrants). Judicially, emphasis
belongs on the crime committed,
not on the weapon employed. All
controls on the possession and the
carrying (in a concealed or open
manner) of guns should be
repealed. It is only the initiation
of force or the threat thereof that
should be punished.
