a date in the history of rock music.
Eight years ago today, the Beatles arrived in New York for |
// their first U.S. tour. fj
kJ One year a n o today there was a rock performance at |
j Stanford. Demonstrators threw rocks through various campus \
| buildings in protest of the invasion of Laos. Even supporters of J
| the window-breaking music (the protesters by the way, acted in |
| concert) admitted that the performers had a pretty Laosy \
| justification. J
| If you hear of a major rock group in the area, either singing |
j or protesting, give our news office a call at ext. 4632. They're fj
| always getting stoned. I
\ IJ you 'd like to sell a used window, call our business office at |
