NABBED—A 15-year-old high school student is frisked after being arrested by plainclothes sheriff's deputies outside
President Richard Lyman's office Friday afternoon. He was arrested after two demonstrators wheeled a large garbage
container into the path of the police car shown. Eyewitnesses report that he did not take part in that incident.
