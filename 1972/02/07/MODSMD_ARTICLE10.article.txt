## Improve Native American Programs 
### 
55 native american students

We, the Native American members of the
Stanford Community, denounce the use of
the symbol of the Indian which is used to
represent the Stanford Athletic Teams and the
caricatures of the Indian accompanying the
symbol as illustrations for posters and fliers
which announce and advertise University
events. We urge that the use of the Indian
symbol be permanently discontinued. We also
urge the University to fulfill its promise to the
students of its Native American Program by
improving and supporting the program and
thereby making its promise to improve Native
American education a reality.
This petition is made necessary by the fact
that the non-Indian members of the Stanford
Community are not sensitive to the
"humaness" of their Native American
counter-parts. The name, the "Stanford
Indians" displays this lack of understanding.
A. This distortion is apparent in the
following ways:
1. The usage of the name, "Stanford
Indians," as the name of the athletic
teams of the school. No one would
show such an ignorance by choosing the
name "The Jews" or "The Negroes" for
a school team. Stanford has placed the
name of a race on its entertainment: A
race is not entertainment. While the
name remains unchanged, the ignornace
of non-Indians likewise remains the
same. There is little chance that those
who regard the term "Indian" as a team
name will ever realize the importance of
socio-economic problems, the
traditional life-styles, and the religious
practices which are central to an
understanding of today's Indian people.
We are People! No other team name
(i.e., the "Forty-Niner's," the
"Raiders," the "Bruins,") serve also as
the names of races. People will fail to
understand the human side of being
Indian as long as they can choose
instead to see only the entertaining
aspects of Indian life.
2. A major part of the symbol's use

involves "Prince" Tim Williams
"Lightfoot" and the Stanford "Dollies."
Neither the mascot nor the cheerleaders
wear traditional dress, and their
performances are degrading to the
Indian population of the Stanford
Community.
a. Lightfoot is especially insulting to
the Plains Indian students, for the
mascot's dances and costume are
improperly designed after their
traditional practices and dress. These
students have been raised to have a
deep regard for their traditional
dances and a great deal of respect for
the dancers who have earned the
honor of performing tribal rites.
Lightfoot's actions on the football
field indeed make a mockery of these
religious practices. Dancing to the
marching band is not traditional; the
fact that Lightfoot wears a
pseudo-traditional costume while
dancing with the band shows that the
code of respect that each wearer of
the costume must follow has been
ignored by him. The headdress is a
sign of great honor and is presented
to its wearer as a reward for deciding
right living.
Putting a "hex" on the opposing
team is a prostitution of the Eagle
dance of the Plains Indians, the
dance which the mascot's
spell-casting notions most resemble.
Because Lightfoot's performances are
completely false, we insist that they
are ethnically wrong, and that they
reinforce the ignorant "Hollywood"
stereo-type of Native Americans.
b. Though the Stanford "Dollies" do
not pretend to be traditional, their
dress is offensive, and the image
transmitted by their dress is totally
unreal. Indian women are never
allowed to act as the "Dollies" do
when they are dressed in the
"Hollywood Indian" image. They
will never accomodate an

understanding of real Indian living,
c. Publications by the Associated
Students of Stanford University and
printed decals, pennants, and dolls
sold in the Stanford Bookstore
habitually prostitute the use of the
Indian in order to announce and
advertise University events. Certainly
anyone can see that these
representations are designed to
capitalize on the facial characteristics
which non-Indians stubbornly
maintain are the patterns for
American Indians' facial
characteristics. The products are
physically unattractive and seem to
insist that the race which they are
fashioned after are also unattractive.
We have attached to this exhibit
many materials which show this
misuse. We are aware that the
Stanford Bookstore sells these
products only on request, but the
fact remains that the distorted
images continued to be sold. We feel
that such cartoons and
representatives are wrongly used; we
feel that they should not be
distributed.
B. We urge the University to reinforce and
give aid to the only really honest concern it
maintains for its Native American students: its
Native American Program.
By removing the Indian as Stanford's
symbol, the University would be renouncing a
grotesque ignorance that it has previously
condoned. We appreciate the long history of
Stanford's Indian symbol; however, we cannot
and will not accept the demeaning, insulting
ways in which this symbol distorts the image
of the Native American and prostitutes the
religious aspects of all tribes in general. By
retracting its misuse of the Indian symbol, the
University would be showing a readily
progressive concern for the American Indians
of the United States.

of non-Indians likewise remains the
same. There is little chance that those
who regard the term "Indian" as a team
name will ever realize the importance of
socio-economic problems, the
traditional life-styles, and the religious
practices which are central to an
understanding of today's Indian people.
We are People! No other team name
(i.e., the "Forty-Niner's," the
"Raiders," the "Bruins,") serve also as
the names of races. People will fail to
understand the human side of being
Indian as long as they can choose
instead to see only the entertaining
aspects of Indian life.
2. A major part of the symbol's use

involves "Prince" Tim Williams
"Lightfoot" and the Stanford "Dollies."
Neither the mascot nor the cheerleaders
wear traditional dress, and their
performances are degrading to the
Indian population of the Stanford
Community.
a. Lightfoot is especially insulting to
the Plains Indian students, for the
mascot's dances and costume are
improperly designed after their
traditional practices and dress. These
students have been raised to have a
deep regard for their traditional
dances and a great deal of respect for
the dancers who have earned the
honor of performing tribal rites.
Lightfoot's actions on the football
field indeed make a mockery of these
religious practices. Dancing to the
marching band is not traditional; the
fact that Lightfoot wears a
pseudo-traditional costume while
dancing with the band shows that the
code of respect that each wearer of
the costume must follow has been
ignored by him. The headdress is a
sign of great honor and is presented
to its wearer as a reward for deciding
right living.
Putting a "hex" on the opposing
team is a prostitution of the Eagle
dance of the Plains Indians, the
dance which the mascot's
spell-casting notions most resemble.
Because Lightfoot's performances are
completely false, we insist that they
are ethnically wrong, and that they
reinforce the ignorant "Hollywood"
stereo-type of Native Americans.
b. Though the Stanford "Dollies" do
not pretend to be traditional, their
dress is offensive, and the image
transmitted by their dress is totally
unreal. Indian women are never
allowed to act as the "Dollies" do
when they are dressed in the
"Hollywood Indian" image. They
will never accomodate an

understanding of real Indian living,
c. Publications by the Associated
Students of Stanford University and
printed decals, pennants, and dolls
sold in the Stanford Bookstore
habitually prostitute the use of the
Indian in order to announce and
advertise University events. Certainly
anyone can see that these
representations are designed to
capitalize on the facial characteristics
which non-Indians stubbornly
maintain are the patterns for
American Indians' facial
characteristics. The products are
physically unattractive and seem to
insist that the race which they are
fashioned after are also unattractive.
We have attached to this exhibit
many materials which show this
misuse. We are aware that the
Stanford Bookstore sells these
products only on request, but the
fact remains that the distorted
images continued to be sold. We feel
that such cartoons and
representatives are wrongly used; we
feel that they should not be
distributed.
B. We urge the University to reinforce and
give aid to the only really honest concern it
maintains for its Native American students: its
Native American Program.
By removing the Indian as Stanford's
symbol, the University would be renouncing a
grotesque ignorance that it has previously
condoned. We appreciate the long history of
Stanford's Indian symbol; however, we cannot
and will not accept the demeaning, insulting
ways in which this symbol distorts the image
of the Native American and prostitutes the
religious aspects of all tribes in general. By
retracting its misuse of the Indian symbol, the
University would be showing a readily
progressive concern for the American Indians
of the United States.

We, the Native American members of the
Stanford Community, denounce the use of
the symbol of the Indian which is used to
represent the Stanford Athletic Teams and the
caricatures of the Indian accompanying the
symbol as illustrations for posters and fliers
which announce and advertise University
events. We urge that the use of the Indian
symbol be permanently discontinued. We also
urge the University to fulfill its promise to the
students of its Native American Program by
improving and supporting the program and
thereby making its promise to improve Native
American education a reality.

that the non-Indian members of the Stanford

"humaness" of their Native American
counter-parts. The name, the "Stanford

Indians," as the name of the athletic
teams of the school. No one would

a school team. Stanford has placed the

honor of performing tribal rites.
Lightfoot's actions on the football
field indeed make a mockery of these
religious practices. Dancing to the
marching band is not traditional; the
fact that Lightfoot wears a
pseudo-traditional costume while
dancing with the band shows that the
code of respect that each wearer of
the costume must follow has been
ignored by him. The headdress is a
sign of great honor and is presented
to its wearer as a reward for deciding
right living.
Putting a "hex" on the opposing
team is a prostitution of the Eagle
dance of the Plains Indians, the
dance which the mascot's
spell-casting notions most resemble.
Because Lightfoot's performances are
completely false, we insist that they
are ethnically wrong, and that they
reinforce the ignorant "Hollywood"
stereo-type of Native Americans.
b. Though the Stanford "Dollies" do
not pretend to be traditional, their
dress is offensive, and the image
transmitted by their dress is totally
unreal. Indian women are never
allowed to act as the "Dollies" do
when they are dressed in the
"Hollywood Indian" image. They
will never accomodate an

understanding of real Indian living,
c. Publications by the Associated
Students of Stanford University and
printed decals, pennants, and dolls
sold in the Stanford Bookstore
habitually prostitute the use of the
Indian in order to announce and
advertise University events. Certainly
anyone can see that these
representations are designed to
capitalize on the facial characteristics
which non-Indians stubbornly
maintain are the patterns for
American Indians' facial
characteristics. The products are
physically unattractive and seem to
insist that the race which they are
fashioned after are also unattractive.
We have attached to this exhibit
many materials which show this
misuse. We are aware that the
Stanford Bookstore sells these
products only on request, but the
fact remains that the distorted
images continued to be sold. We feel
that such cartoons and
representatives are wrongly used; we
feel that they should not be
distributed.
B. We urge the University to reinforce and
give aid to the only really honest concern it
maintains for its Native American students: its
Native American Program.
By removing the Indian as Stanford's
symbol, the University would be renouncing a
grotesque ignorance that it has previously
condoned. We appreciate the long history of
Stanford's Indian symbol; however, we cannot
and will not accept the demeaning, insulting
ways in which this symbol distorts the image
of the Native American and prostitutes the
religious aspects of all tribes in general. By
retracting its misuse of the Indian symbol, the
University would be showing a readily
progressive concern for the American Indians
of the United States.

Amsterdam was signed by 55 Native American
students.)
