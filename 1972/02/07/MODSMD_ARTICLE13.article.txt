# Critic Says Biography Is 'Fart Out

### ROBERT VINING 
(Le Petomane by Jean Nohain and
F. Caradec, Sherbourne Press,
$5.00 hardbound.)
This book, in print barely five
years, already has established
itself as a classic in the
scatological disciplines. And yet,
astonishingly enough, the
Stanford community has not yet
been apprised of its existence.
So the volume lies quietly on a
shelf in the Lane Medical Library
here on campus.
What follows is a review of this
work.
I spent my high school years
convinced that my friend Bill
Cornwell possessed the most
prolific colon-rectum-sphincter
team the world had ever known.
The fellow broke wind with
scandalous ease, firing practically
at will as the occasion suited him.
Bill developed the backend
blast into an all-purpose
communicative medium.
Concurrence, dissent, pleasure,
discomfort, overwhelming joy,
sizzling excitement — each could
be conveyed in one of the deep
pronouncements issuing from
Bill's turbulent bowels.
Bill would conjure fart after
fart, each to be rated according to
the sound produced. The most
prodigious efforts were acclaimed
homeruns, while less powerful
poots were judged off-the-wall
triples, line smash doubles,
back-through-the-box singles, or,
in the rare case of fizzles,
ignorminious strikeouts.
Day in, day out, Bill was

unmatched for either power or
consistency. Cornwell, as the
saying went, came to play. Surely
there had never been his equal.
Or so I thought until I read Le
Petomane. From 1892 to 1900
Joseph Pujol, billed as "Le
Petomane," broke wind
professionally on Parisian stages.
At the Moulin Rouge his Sunday
box office receipts doubled those
of Sara Bernhardt.
Le Petomane could imitate the
sounds of dogs barking, cannons
exploding, dressmakers tearing
calico strips, could even play
tunes through his backside. Aided
by an opening in the seat of his
stage breeches, Le Petomane blew
out candles stationed a foot
behind him.
The audiences shook helplessly.
Their screaming, uncontrollable
laughter rose as each improbable
demonstration gave way to
another even more incredible.
As soon as I stumbled upon this
book I rushed to Bill with it. Our
assessments were similar.
Certainly the biography's
subject delights the imagination
but the same cannot be said
truthfully for the book itself. Le
Petomane does not enthrall as Le
Petomane intriges.
Le Petomane's ninety-six small
pages are pieced together from
journals, memoirs, and newspaper
accounts of the period. In one
relatively lengthy section the
reminiscences of Le Petomane's
eldest son are reprinted.
Repetition occasionally mars
eyewitness descriptions. They are

replete with similar depictions of
crowds paralyzed in frenzied
hilarity, of swooning ladies being
carried away by nurses.
At times the authors stoop to
padding their prose, as if they
were being paid by the word: "the
complete answer... to any
detailed question which can be
put and to the scepticism, in
particular, of certain detractors of
France's great citizen, Le
Petomane."
Sometimes they praise too
freely and make unnecessary
claims: "This little masterpiece is
the work of Louis Pujol, the
eldest living son of Joseph Pujol.
It was written without help but
with a respect and consideration
which in no way excludes
complete objectivity."
The book's materials, though
hardly perfect as historical
documents, are of unquestioned
value and need not be embellished
or presented as being anything
beyond what they are. Nohain
and Caradec should realize that Le

Petomane's artistry speaks for
itself throughout these pages.
The authors could have
included some descriptive analysis
of the phenomenon Joseph Pujol
and Bill Cornwell have practiced
with such consummate skill.
What are the different varieties
of sound, as distinguished by
pitch, timbre, and duration, which
can spring from deft derrierres?
E.g., what is the freep? How does
it differ from the double flotchy
and its frequent companion, the
followup contaga?
Nevertheless, anyone who
relishes the well-executed fart —
and there are those of us who DO
- will welcome Le Petomane as a
noteworthy addition to the scant
literature on what Nohain and
Caradec assert is "one of the most
important areas of human
possibility — the effect of will
power on the abdominal
muscles." Flawed though the
biography is, historical studies of
its sort are part of the necessary
spadework in the field.
