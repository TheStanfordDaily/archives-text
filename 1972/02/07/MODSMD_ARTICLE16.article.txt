# Ehrlich Hits Basis Of UN Conference
## 
### 
Little progress toward solving
the real ecological problems of the
world can be expected from
deliberations of the UN
Conference on the Human
Environment to be held next June
in Stockholm, Biology Prof. Paul
Ehrlich told a student-sponsored
meeting on Ecology and Third
World Development Friday, Feb.
4, at UC-Berkeley.
"1 am apprehensive that the
conference will turn out to be a
convention of establishment
representatives praising each
other's governments for all they
are doing to save the
environment," said the noted
population biologist
"Since virtually all governments
are promoting environmental
destruction," he said, "it may be
quite a spectacle. The nearly total
absence of population problems
from the conference agenda again
shows the tendency of UN
member nations to put personal

interests of their political leaders
and governments before those of
the world's people."
Ehrlich reiterated his assertion
that population growth among the
affluent poses a much greater
threat to the ecosphere than
excess reproduction by the poor.
"In terms of environmental
degradation, the birth of each
American child is 50 times the
disaster for the world as the birth
of a child in India," he said.
"The ecology movement has
not paid enough attention to the
critical problems of the
redistribution of wealth and
opportunity. As a result the
movement has gained little
support among the poor peoples
of the US or the world," Ehrlich
said.
"They know that the Western
world is largely run by a small
group of 'Henry Cabot Lodge'
types for their own benefit."
