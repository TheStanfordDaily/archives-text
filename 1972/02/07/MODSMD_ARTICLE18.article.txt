It is time for someone to come to the defense of the American
Indian as the symbol of Stanford's athletic efforts.
Recently, many influential members of the Stanford community
have expressed sympathy with the desire of 55 native American
students to end the use of the Indian as the school's mascot.
The Daily editoria. board in a January 28 editorial eloquently
supported the native Americans, claiming that, "The current status of
the Indian as Stanford's mascot is totally unacceptable. A symbol
which exploits or degrades any race or ethnic group cannot and
should not be tolerated."
President Richard Lyman spoke on the mascot controversy last
Tuesday in a KZSU interview, stating that he would receive the native
American's petitions, ". . . with an open mind, and I might go further
to say, with a good deal of sympathy."
Amsterdam Recommendation
University Ombudswoman Lois Amsterdam sent the petitions to
Lyman last Thursday with the recommendation that, . . any and all
Stanford University use of the Indian symbol should be immediately
disavowed and permanently stopped."
Amsterdam told the President that she feels the Indian symbol
"brings up to visibility a painful lack of sensitivity and awareness on
the part of the University."
Buck Club President Clark Graham believes that "If people are
being emotionally hurt [by the Indian mascot] it should be changed."
The San Francisco Chronicle editorialized yesterday that it did not see
any compelling reason for change, but agreed with Graham that the
Indian should not be retained if people are suffering because of it.
It appears as if the Administration wheels are grinding very fast to
accomodate the native American's request and any defense of the
Indian as Stanford's symbol must be made very quickly.
Changes Are Needed
Changes should be made in Stanford's use of the Indian as its
symbol, but to abolish it in favor of a Cardinal would be rash and
unnecessary.
The 55 petitioners feel that Stanford's Indian abuses and defames
the proud heritage of the native American. There are certain
manifestations of Stanford's use of the Indian which are very
objectionable. The Pom-Pon Dollies and Prince Lightfoot's role in
representing the Indian should be reviewed and possibly abolished.
Two years ago, the ridiculous bulbous-nosed caricature of the Indian
displayed on decals and Athletic Department stationary was banished
and many more corrections should be made in our presentation of the
Indian as our symbol.
The Indian should not be used as a mascot, a dummy held aloft on
a stick to physically represent a group of totally unrelated people.
Instead, the Indian should be seen as the embodiment of an honored
heritage and a high set of ideals by which a school would be proud to
be represented.
Stanford's native Americans have argued that our use of the Indian
has obscured their plight as a people. By encouraging the elimination
of any use of the Indian as a symbol, the native Americans are missing
a great opportunity to bring the proper attention and respect to
themselves and their proud ancestors.
By refining Stanford's symbolic use of the Indian, we can become
one of the only institutions in America to have a symbol that really
means something.
Meaningful Symbol
Instead of making ridiculous and frivolous use of an animal, the
symbol of the Indian can be implemented so as to present the true
image of the native American that can be understood, empathized
with, and respected. Moreover, national attention can be brought to
the Indian symbol through its ties with a successful athletic program.
The current attempts to abolish the Indian symbol have drawn the
full attention of the media. This will last only as long as the
shortsighted crusade to replace the Indian with the Cardinal. The
novel effort to make constructive social use out of a school's symbol
would have far more widespread effects.
The Daily sports staff firmly recommends that formal action be
taken to reform the Stanford-projected image of the native American.
We encourage readers to contribute letters to this sports page so we
can make known the community's feelings on the issue.
Lastly, we challenge the native Americans and the Administration
which supports them to not ignore this important opportunity to
glorify the heritage of the native American instead of burying it.

accomodate the native American's request and any defense of the
Indian as Stanford's symbol must be made very quickly.
Changes Are Needed
Changes should be made in Stanford's use of the Indian as its
symbol, but to abolish it in favor of a Cardinal would be rash and
unnecessary.
The 55 petitioners feel that Stanford's Indian abuses and defames
the proud heritage of the native American. There are certain
manifestations of Stanford's use of the Indian which are very
objectionable. The Pom-Pon Dollies and Prince Lightfoot's role in
representing the Indian should be reviewed and possibly abolished.
Two years ago, the ridiculous bulbous-nosed caricature of the Indian
displayed on decals and Athletic Department stationary was banished
and many more corrections should be made in our presentation of the
Indian as our symbol.
The Indian should not be used as a mascot, a dummy held aloft on
a stick to physically represent a group of totally unrelated people.
Instead, the Indian should be seen as the embodiment of an honored
heritage and a high set of ideals by which a school would be proud to
be represented.
Stanford's native Americans have argued that our use of the Indian
has obscured their plight as a people. By encouraging the elimination
of any use of the Indian as a symbol, the native Americans are missing
a great opportunity to bring the proper attention and respect to
themselves and their proud ancestors.
By refining Stanford's symbolic use of the Indian, we can become
one of the only institutions in America to have a symbol that really
means something.
Meaningful Symbol
Instead of making ridiculous and frivolous use of an animal, the
symbol of the Indian can be implemented so as to present the true
image of the native American that can be understood, empathized
with, and respected. Moreover, national attention can be brought to
the Indian symbol through its ties with a successful athletic program.
The current attempts to abolish the Indian symbol have drawn the
full attention of the media. This will last only as long as the
shortsighted crusade to replace the Indian with the Cardinal. The
novel effort to make constructive social use out of a school's symbol
would have far more widespread effects.
The Daily sports staff firmly recommends that formal action be
taken to reform the Stanford-projected image of the native American.
We encourage readers to contribute letters to this sports page so we
can make known the community's feelings on the issue.
Lastly, we challenge the native Americans and the Administration
which supports them to not ignore this important opportunity to
glorify the heritage of the native American instead of burying it.
It is time for someone to come to the defense of the American
Indian as the symbol of Stanford's athletic efforts.
Recently, many influential members of the Stanford community
have expressed sympathy with the desire of 55 native American
students to end the use of the Indian as the school's mascot.
The Daily editoria. board in a January 28 editorial eloquently
supported the native Americans, claiming that, "The current status of
the Indian as Stanford's mascot is totally unacceptable. A symbol
which exploits or degrades any race or ethnic group cannot and
should not be tolerated."
President Richard Lyman spoke on the mascot controversy last
Tuesday in a KZSU interview, stating that he would receive the native
American's petitions, ". . . with an open mind, and I might go further
to say, with a good deal of sympathy."
Amsterdam Recommendation
University Ombudswoman Lois Amsterdam sent the petitions to
Lyman last Thursday with the recommendation that, . . any and all
Stanford University use of the Indian symbol should be immediately
disavowed and permanently stopped."
Amsterdam told the President that she feels the Indian symbol
"brings up to visibility a painful lack of sensitivity and awareness on
the part of the University."
Buck Club President Clark Graham believes that "If people are
being emotionally hurt [by the Indian mascot] it should be changed."
The San Francisco Chronicle editorialized yesterday that it did not see
any compelling reason for change, but agreed with Graham that the
Indian should not be retained if people are suffering because of it.
It appears as if the Administration wheels are grinding very fast to
accomodate the native American's request and any defense of the
Indian as Stanford's symbol must be made very quickly.
