# Go To Building 10
## SRM Forced From Placement Center 
### 
A 15-year-old Palo Alto High
School student was arrested Friday
afternoon for disturbing the peace
following demonstrations at the
Placement Center and the President's
office.
Following a noon rally, about 75
demonstrators entered the Placement
Center to protest recruiting by FCM
Corporation. They remained in the
building for about 45 minutes until
they were routed by deputy sheriffs.
At about 2:15 p.m., after leaving
the Placement Center, the group
marched to the offices of President
Richard W. Lyman. The offices had
been locked in anticipation of the
protesters' arrival. They remained
outside for about 10 minutes until
police arrived.
The high school student was
arrested after two demonstrators
pushed a large trash container in the
path of a police squad car.
Noon Rally
The afternoon's activities began
with a noon rally in front of the
Placement Center on White Plaza.
Members of the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement told the
small crowd about FMC's war-related
activities and urged that its recruiters
be prevented from conducting
interviews inside the center.
Hospital worker John Dolly handed
out red ski masks to several of the
demonstrators shortly after 1:00 p.m.
Immediately thereafter, about 75 of
them entered the Placement Center.
No FMC Recruiter
Inside the center, the demonstrators
found no FMC recruiters. Protesters
occupied several of the small
interviewing booths, and debated with
a recruiter from Lincoln Laboratories,
a research organization affiliated with
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. She asked them to leave,
but they refused.
At about 1:45 p.m. Sheriff's
deputies arrived and cleared them
from the building. According to
Placement Center officials, most of the
day's interviews were held as

Shortly after the group was forced
from the Placement Center, several
bled air from the tires of police cars
parked outside, and after police had
left, about 50 people marched to
Lyman's office.
Doors Locked
They found both front and rear
doors to the office building locked,
and then beat on the plexiglass

windows for about ten minutes.
They had begun to disperse when
eight riot-equipped police arrived. The
officers walked to the front of the
building, then returned to their cars
behind the building and prepared to
leave.
Three of their four squad cars had
left when two demonstrators wheeled
the heavy trash container behind the

last, unmarked, car which was backing
in the direction of History Corner.
Those responsible escaped, but the
juvenile, standing nearby, was arrested
by a plainclothes officer.
As the arrest was made, police with
clubs held high chased the crowd from
the area behind the President's office
into the Quad. The demonstrators
then dispersed.
