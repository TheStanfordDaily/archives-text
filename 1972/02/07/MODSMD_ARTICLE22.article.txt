# Cal Games
## Cagers Split 
### BILL CLASTER 
In one of the most fiercely
contested games ever played
between long-time rivals Stanford
and Cal, the Indians outlasted the
Bears 93-86 in triple overtime at
Maples Pavilion Friday night.
The victory, coming on the
heels of triple overtime in the
freshman game, was so exciting
that it drained both players and
fans, and made Berkeley's 84-70
Saturday afternoon victory over
the Indians seem unimportant in
comparison.
Close Battle
Friday night's game was close
all the way. The Indians took a
36-33 halftime lead behind the
shooting and rebounding of
sophomores Mike Mann and Steve
Shupe who combined for 22
points and 14 rebounds. The
Bears tied the game six minutes
into the second half and the
margin never again got higher than
three. With 2:51 left in a 65-all
game, the Indians went into a stall
and worked the clock down for
one shot. But Claude Terry's
running 10 footer in the last two
seconds fell short and the game
went into overtime.
Stanford quickly fell behind
69-66, but managed to close the
score to 71-70 Cal with five
seconds left and Terry at the line
for a one and one. The Indian
guard made the first but missed
the second to send the game into
its second overtime.
Overtime Action
With the score tied at 80 all,
Cal's John Coughran lost the ball
out of bounds with just 13
seconds to play. Terry then hit
two free throws to put the Tribe
up by two with 10 seconds to
play. Cal then lost the ball on a
violation and it looked like it was
all over.
It wasn't. Terry was called for a
charging foul and the Bears had
one more chance with just two
seconds remaining. Cal's Eric
Long threw a high lob pass to
6'10" Ansley Truitt who turned
around and hit a fifteen footer,

and the game went into triple
overtime.
Indians Dominate
It was all Stanford in the final
extra period. Terry put the
Indians on the board first with a
steal and lay-up. A Steve Shupe
jumper and seven Indian free
throws put it away. Terry shot
poorly from the field, but still
managed 30 points, mainly on the
strength of 14 second half
free-throws. Like Terry, Mann and
Shupe played the entire 55
minutes with Mann getting 17
points and 19 rebounds and
Shupe scoring 21 while hauling in
12 rebounds.
Ansley Truitt led Cal with 28
points, but was only 12 for 32
from the field. He was not nearly
the dominating force that he
could have been as was evidenced
by his performance in Saturday
afternoon's game.
In the early moments of this
game it looked as if it might be a
repeat of Friday night's affair.
Neither team could produce much
of a lead, and only some late
baskets by Cal gave the Bears a
45-38 edge at half time. Cal
gradually built this lead into the
14 point margin that they held at
the end of the game. Both teams
seemed flat after the previous
night's thriller, as this game never
was very exciting.
Fine Defense
Terry had 16 for the Indians,
but again shot poorly from the
field. He was defensed superbly
by Cal's Eric Long who held
him to six points in the first half
on Friday night. Bob Buell topped
the Tribe with 18 while Steve
Shupe had 12 and gave another
aggressive effort on the boards.
6'6" John Coughran had 21 for
the Bears and combined with
Truitt to shut Stanford off the
boards. Together they held the
6'9" Mann to a mere two
rebounds.
The win and loss moved the
Indians Pacific 8 record to 3-3 and
their overall mark to 8-9, while
the Bears went to 2-4 and 9-12.
