# Gymnasts Edge Bruins

### DOUG WILSON 
Stanford's Bob Anderson took
all-around honors Saturday
evening to lead the Indian
gymnastics team to an exciting
four-point victory over
powerhouse UCLA,
152.15-148.40. Coach Dan
Millman's winning squad compiled
the highest team total ever scored
at Stanford.
Anderson managed nine
point-plus victories in both the
high bar and floor-exercise events.
In the latter, the Stanford
freshman was strongly challenged
by UCLA's Steve Gerlach;
Anderson defeated the Bruin
gymnast by five-hundredths of a
point, 9.10-9.05. On the high bar,
Anderson defeated teammates
Steve Hug and Bob Horwitz, for a
Stanford sweep of the event.
Hug, nursing a bad ankle which

he injured prior to an
international meet in Philadelphia
last week, was unable to execute
his usual dismount from the high
and parallel bars, but nevertheless
won the latter with an 8.85 point
total. The Stanford sophomore
tied for second in the side horse
event, with UCLA's Mike Haugen,
but failed to place in the top three
in the rings event and did not
participate in floor exercise or
vaulting.
The rings were won by
Stanford sophomore Howard
Bessen, who broke into the
nine-plus scoring column for the
first time in his career with a
superlative performance that
brought an ovation from the
crowd. Bessen defeated his high
school teammate, Mark Sherwood
of UCLA, who compiled 8.80
points to Bessen's 9.05.

Also earning loud applause was
Stanford's Shawn Skerrett, whose
9.05 point total in the vaulting
bested second-place Steve Gerlach
and UCLA. Leo Hollberg of
Stanford was third.
The side horse was won by Ken
Bailey of UCLA in the only event
dominated by the Bruins.
Stanford meets perennial Pac-8
champion Berkeley in its final
home meet on February 26, to be
held in Maples Pavilion.
