Irish March Peacefully
NEWRY, Northern Ireland — Pro-Roman Catholic
demonstrators estimated to number 20,000, marched
down Newry's streets in an illegal parade yesterday but
averted a clash with British troops by switching their
route at the last minute.
With tiny, defiant Bernadette Devlin in the lead, the
silent marchers headed down a hill toward Newry's city
center. An armed camp bristling with Northern Irish
police and 3,000 combat-ready British troops awaited
them.
Hanging over the procession was the memory of 13
civilians killed in a street fight with British soldiers in
Londonderry on last week's "Bloody Sunday."
But shortly after falling in step, the marchers veered
away from army barricades, made their way peacefully
back through side streets and wound up at mass rally near
their starting point.
There was no violence.
British Prime Minister Edward Heath raised broad hints
yesterday that his government is preparing a new political
initiative on Northern Ireland.
In a speech to young Conservatives, Heath called on
leaders of Northern Ireland's Roman Catholic minority to
join in talks toward a settlement.
He promised his government would "play its full share
in contributing to a fruitful outcome" and stressed that it
would use its "ingenuity" toward that end.
Thuy, Rogers Exchange Allegations
WASHINGTON — North Vietnamese Minister of State
Xuan Thuv and U.S. Secretary of State William P. Rogers
each accused the other's government yesterday of
blocking progress in efforts to end the Vietnam war.
Thuy said President Nixon's revelation of secret
negotiations with Hanoi created a serious obstacle to a
oeaceful settlement.

But Rogers said Xuan Thuy's government had been
"totally intransigent" in both secret and public
negotiations.
Rogers said, however, "they have not rejected President
Nixon's proposal in eight points as such. I would hope in
future they would realize negotiations hold out the best
hope."
He said these proposals "provide a basis on which
agreement could be reached."
Thuy said Nixon missed a chance to settle the war and
attain the release of American prisoners of war last fall
when Thieu was re-elected with no opposition candidates
running.
Nixon's support of Thieu, he said, was why North
Vietnam had changed its position on the return of
American prisoners.
They were interviewed on separate segments of the
CBS-TV program "Eace the Nation," Rogers in
Washington and Thuy in Paris.
Dock Talks Pressure Increases
SAN FRANCISCO — Negotiators in the 122-day West
Coast dock strike continue striving for contract agreement
before Congress votes a legislated settlement.
Sam Kagel, veteran private mediator, kept the
negotiating teams at the bargaining table in weekend talks
that extended into last night after a dinner break.
The effects of increasing pressures from the White
House and Congress were evident in the intensified
bargaining talks.
"We're working specifics now," said an International
Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union spokesman.
"We're making progress, no doubt of that," said a
spokesman for the employer Pacific Maritime Association.
Congressional leaders have promised to intensify their
efforts this week to pass legislation submitting the dispute
to compulsory arbitration.
