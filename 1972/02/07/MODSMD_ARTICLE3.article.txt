# White Van Adds To Bike Theft Mystery
## 
### 
A student who witnessed a bike
theft last Sunday night has challenged
MECHA leaders' contention that the
discovery of ten stolen bicycles in the
MECHA Casa Monday was the result
of "a direct attack by individuals who
desire to discredit" the Chicano
student organization. This statement
appeared in a letter from the MECHA
Mesa Directiva, published in last
Wednesday's Daily.
Junior, Ed Luce, said he and a girl
friend saw two persons removing
bicycles from the front of Lagunita
Court to the adjacent parking lot the
night of January 30. lie said he did
not see where the bikes were taken,
but did notice a white van parked in
the lot.
Later that evening, Luce said, he
saw a similar van, this one with a
Stanford emblem on the left side, in
front of the MECHA Casa. He added
that he saw no evidence of the stolen
bicycles at that time.
Monday, after learning that several
of his friends' bikes had been stolen,
Luce and another student, Andrew
Baldwin, proceeded to the MECHA
Casa when 1 they discovered the ten
stolen bicycles.

Assistant to the President Luis
Nogales told the Daily that three
MECHA students involved in a
work-study program have access to the
Stanford van. Both Nogales and
MECHA leader Jesse Calvillo said they
do not know who was driving the van
last Sunday night.
Calvillo expressed concern that the
bike theft incident may be used as a
basis of argument to evict MECHA
from its building.
Shirley Peppers, assistant to the
Dean of Students, said there is
currently some disagreement between
MECHA and the University
administration about the terms under
which the Dean's office leases the Casa
to the Chicano group. "However," she
said, "there has been no discussion of
eviction."
She added, "Until all the facts come
out on the bicycle issue, I can't say
whether it will have any effect on the
licensing question."
Acting Dean of Students Robert
Ereelen said, "I don't know enough
about the incident at this point to say,
but I would think it has no direct
bearing on our negotiations."
