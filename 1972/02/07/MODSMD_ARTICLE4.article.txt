# Poet Asks 'Identity With Heroes'
## 
### MARCIA FRIEDMAN 
Maya Angelou, black poet, author
and dancer, spoke on the importance
of maintaining identity with one's
heroes yesterday at the program for
Afro-American History Week at
Stanford.
Dressed in a long African print skirt
with a matching scarf wrapped around
her head, the tall stately woman spoke
on "Black American Contributions to
the American Way of Life" to an
audience which filled about
three-fourths of the main floor of
Memorial Auditorium.
"We have to see that people live in
direct relationship with their heroes,"
she said. "When they identify with
them, you have a healthy situation."
The program was offered by the
Office of the President at Stanford in
cooperation with the Peninsula
Chapter of the Links, Inc., an all black
women's group, and the Community
Activities Committee, an interracial
women's group, both of which raise
money for black college scholarships.
Angelou began her speech with a
story from Kenya in which a child asks
his mother why he never sees photos
of lions killing men and only sees
those of men killing lions.
"Wait my child, until the lion takes
the photo" the mother replied,
according to Angelou.
Author of I Know Why the Caged
Bird Sings and a more recent book of
poems, Just Give Mc a Cool Drink of
Water 'fore I Die, Angelou kept the

diverse audience spellbound as her
deep commanding voice made several
points, illustrating some with her
poetry, which largely reflects the black
experience in America.
"Black kid goes to school, his
history books ignore him, he gets no
A's," she said. "You can't break both
his legs and tell him to go to the
Olympics and win a sprinting contest,"
she added in reference to the effects of
slavery on American blacks.
Enslavement involves three
components, according to Miss
Angelou. They are, believing that the
slave is subhuman, convincing your
allies of the same, and convincing the
slave of it also.
"I used to believe that the worst
part of slavery was that we lost our
culture," she said, and added on a
more cheerful note, "My brothers and
sisters, it's not true. I leave that idea as
fast as a young woman leaves an old
husband."
After spending time in Africa, she
realized that many of the things she
had considered 'Afro-Americanisms'
were actually 'Africanisms.'
"The walk young black men do,"
she said, doing an imitation across the
stage which brought a great deal of
laughter and applause, "is really a
survival, not a revival."
"You can always trace any more
back to its source," she continued. "In
West Africa, when 13-year old boys
are left alone in the bush for three
months, they walk back to the village
in the very same way which says 'I am
a man'."
She extended this to the behavior of
white people in the South.
"European women didn't have the
affectations of Southern belles," she
said. "These Africanisms, like 'nice
girls drop their eyes and talk softly'
were things a slave couldn't do but
could teach to the white children."
One of her poems dealt with Joe
Louis defending his World
Heavyweight Championship. Through
it she emphasized how the fate of one
black affects the entire black
community.

"My race groaned. My race was
falling with him," she recited
forcefully and vividly about the
moment when he seemed to be losing
the fight.
"There's a lady in jail, Angela Davis.
James Baldwin wrote to her, 'We are
aware that you must not be taken to
the gas chamber with our bodies. If
they come for you in the morning,
they come for us at night'."

sisters, it's not true. I leave that idea as
fast as a young woman leaves an old
husband."
After spending time in Africa, she
realized that many of the things she
had considered 'Afro-Americanisms'
were actually 'Africanisms.'
"The walk young black men do,"
she said, doing an imitation across the
stage which brought a great deal of
laughter and applause, "is really a
survival, not a revival."
"You can always trace any more
back to its source," she continued. "In
West Africa, when 13-year old boys
are left alone in the bush for three
months, they walk back to the village
in the very same way which says 'I am
a man'."
She extended this to the behavior of
white people in the South.
"European women didn't have the
affectations of Southern belles," she
said. "These Africanisms, like 'nice
girls drop their eyes and talk softly'
were things a slave couldn't do but
could teach to the white children."
One of her poems dealt with Joe
Louis defending his World
Heavyweight Championship. Through
it she emphasized how the fate of one
black affects the entire black
community.

"My race groaned. My race was
falling with him," she recited
forcefully and vividly about the
moment when he seemed to be losing
the fight.
"There's a lady in jail, Angela Davis.
James Baldwin wrote to her, 'We are

the gas chamber with our bodies. If
they come for you in the morning,
they come for us at night'."
Maya Angelou, black poet, author
and dancer, spoke on the importance
of maintaining identity with one's
heroes yesterday at the program for
Afro-American History Week at
Stanford.
Dressed in a long African print skirt
with a matching scarf wrapped around
her head, the tall stately woman spoke
on "Black American Contributions to
the American Way of Life" to an
audience which filled about
three-fourths of the main floor of
Memorial Auditorium.
"We have to see that people live in
direct relationship with their heroes,"
she said. "When they identify with
them, you have a healthy situation."
The program was offered by the
Office of the President at Stanford in
cooperation with the Peninsula
Chapter of the Links, Inc., an all black
women's group, and the Community
Activities Committee, an interracial
women's group, both of which raise
money for black college scholarships.
Angelou began her speech with a
story from Kenya in which a child asks
his mother why he never sees photos
of lions killing men and only sees
those of men killing lions.
"Wait my child, until the lion takes
the photo" the mother replied,
according to Angelou.
Author of I Know Why the Caged
Bird Sings and a more recent book of
poems, Just Give Mc a Cool Drink of
Water 'fore I Die, Angelou kept the

diverse audience spellbound as her
deep commanding voice made several
points, illustrating some with her
poetry, which largely reflects the black
experience in America.
"Black kid goes to school, his
history books ignore him, he gets no
A's," she said. "You can't break both
his legs and tell him to go to the
Olympics and win a sprinting contest,"
she added in reference to the effects of
slavery on American blacks.
Enslavement involves three
components, according to Miss
Angelou. They are, believing that the
slave is subhuman, convincing your
allies of the same, and convincing the
slave of it also.
"I used to believe that the worst
part of slavery was that we lost our
culture," she said, and added on a
more cheerful note, "My brothers and
sisters, it's not true. I leave that idea as
fast as a young woman leaves an old
husband."
