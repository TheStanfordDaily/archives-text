# CJP Hearings Begin; One Arrest At Protest
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Stanford worker and radical John
Dolly was arrested Saturday morning
by Santa Clara County Sheriffs
deputies during a protest against a
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) hearing in
the Graduate School of Business
(GSB). (See photo sequence on page
six.)
The CJP hearings were being held
for four students charged for the
November 4 "mill-in" at the
Placement Center. The hearings will
continue today starting at 8:00 a.m. in
the conference room of Roscoe Maples
Pavilion. They will be closed to the
public.
Dolly was charged with felonious
assault on a Sheriff's deputy,
interfering with an officer in the
performance of his duty and
disturbing the peace. Dolly posted
$500 bail and was released Saturday.
Dolly's arrest on Saturday was

preceded by the first session of the
CJP Friday in UGLY, over the
Placement Center "mill-in." On trial
for violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption are junior Don Lee of
Venceremos, sophomore Paul Loeb of
the Young Crows, sophomore Pete
Knutson of the Young Crows and
sophomore Steve Downey. They
compose the so-called "Placement
Center 4."
Arriving at the Meyer Library's
Forum Room Friday morning where
six windows and two doors had been
broken Thursday night, the defendants
and their counsel found themselves
"barred" by about 30 demonstrators
at the west doors of the room and
soon left.
Sheriffs Arrive
Santa Clara County Sheriff
Lieutenant Don Tamm arrived outside
the room and asked if anyone was
being barred from entering the room.
No one responded so Tamm entered
for a brief period and then left.
At 9:55, hearing officer Lillian
Altree noted that the defendants were
not present and adjourned the hearing.
In further discussions Altree said that
"given the kinds of circumstances
surrounding them, the hearings are
very fair." She added that although
the CJP was "not perfect, it has the
potential of working quite fairly."
At a 1:00 p.m. rally Friday at the
Placement Center defendants Lee and
Loeb were served by the Stanford
police with summonses for a new
hearing which CJP Chairman John
Kaplan had scheduled for 8:30 a.m.
Saturday at GSB. Counselors Blank,
Schlissel, and Goldscheider were also
served with similar summonses.
On Saturday, about 60
demonstrators began gathering at GSB
at 8:00 a.m. Upon arriving outside
Room 75 they discovered signs on the
doors saying that the hearings were
"not open to the public." Altree said
she had closed the hearings because of
the disturbances Friday morning.
Shortly before 8:30, the time for
which the hearing was scheduled,
twenty riot clad Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Deputies arrived on the scene.
At 8:30, Lee and Loeb arrived with
counselors Owen Blank, David

Schlissel and Peter Goldscheider.
Tac Squad 'Help'
Tamm told Lee that if he or the
others had any difficulty in entering
the hearing room, the Tac Squad
would "help" them past the
demonstrators. When Lee informed
the crowd of this, a narrow corridor
opened up through which Lee, Loeb
and their counsel were escorted by
Tamm and several officers.
Once inside the hearing room, the
defense moved that the case be
continued until Monday morning,
when the other two defendants and
the remaining three counselors could
appear.
Defense counselor Dave Schlissel
told the Daily that the defense desired
a continuance because they "never
expected that they would have a
hearing Saturday."
Hearing officer Altree said that
defendants Knutson and Downey had
severed their case from that of Lee and
Loeb by not appearing at the hearing.
The defense then argued that the
severence was "forced" because the
two absent defendants had not been
summoned.
Judicial Ethics
After Schwartz denied that the
severence had indeed been forced, an
enraged Lee jumped up, loudly
denounced the hearing and walked out
of the room. Outside he told the
waiting demonstrators that the hearing
was not being carried on with "any
kind of judicial ethics or propriety."
Loeb and the defense counsel
quickly followed Lee out of the room
and Altree recessed the hearing. After
the counsel had made brief speeches to
the protesters they went back into
Room 75 to carry on a private, two
hour discussion with Schwartz. The
focus of the discussion was on the
defense motion for a continuance of
the hearing until Monday.
While the hearings were going on
inside GSB, the Sheriff's deputies had
surrounded the demonstrators outside.
It was then that John Dolly began to
loudly question Tamm about "what
the fuck are you doing?" Dolly asked
if the demonstration was an illegal
assembly, and when told by Tamm
that it was not, he asked if people
could leave.
Tamm said to his officers "if these
people wish to leave, let them go
now." Then, addressing the protesters,
Tamm said "if you wish to go, go right
on up the ramp." He pointed up the
staircase on which he was standing.
Dolly said later that he did not hear
Tamm's second statement. In any case,
he said "I'm gonna' walk through
here," and tried to walk between two
deputies who were standing in front of
a staircase other than the one to which
Tamm had pointed.
Under Arrest
The two deputies whom Dolly
approached pushed him away with
their clubs. A sergeant then said
"you're under arrest," and grabbed
Dolly by the shirt. The sergeant then
put Dolly in a hammer lock and
dragged him away from the area.
After meeting with Schwartz in
private, counselors Blank and
Goldscheider left. Schlissel remained
and at noon was called back into the
hearing room. There Altree asked him
if he could assure her that all the
defendants and their counsel would be
present if a continuance until Monday
were granted.
Schlissel said he could make no such
guarantees because he could not get in
contact with any of the defendants.
Altree then said that the hearing
would continue and asked Schlissel if
he would remain to represent the
defense while the prosecution

presented its case. Schlissel refused,
saying that the entire defense
collective should be present. He then
left and the hearings went on in the
absence of both the defendants and
their counsel.
Duane Linsenbardt, a student in
electrical engineering, the first
prosecution witness, testified that his
interview with TRW was disrupted by
three to five people in two separate
rooms.
He said that he had a private
interview scheduled and that the three
to five people other than the
interviewer and himself in the room
would not leave â€” disrupting the
interview. The TRW representative and
Linsenbardt moved into another room
and tried again, only to have the group
of people follow them, Linsenbardt
then testified.
Keller Testifies
Ralph Keller, director of the
Placement Center, testified that he had
asked the people in the interviewing
rooms to leave so that Linsenbardt
could have his interview. They did not,
Keller said, so he told them that they
were in violation of the policy on
campus disruption.
Stanford police photographer Nikita
Bruno, the third witness at the
hearing, told the hearing officer that
the demonstrators against the TRW
interview had plenty of time to leave
after Keller asked them to.
Asked if "any individuals who were
in that room, whom Mr. Keller had
asked to eave, were known to you."

He answered affirmatively and singled
out Lee, Loeb, Downey and Knutson.
Schwartz showed Bruno the
pictures taken by Bruno at the
demonstration and asked him if the
defendants were shown in the pictures.
Bruno said they were. Schwartz
emphasized that the "identifications
of Mr. Knutson and Mr. Downey are
irrelevant to the purposes of this
case," explaining that for the time the
cases had been severed.
Both the fourth and fifth witnesses
identified Lee as having disrupted a
student's interview with a
representative from General Motors.
Francis Holtslander, the supervisor of
Recruitment Activities at the
Placement Center, testified that Lee
remained in the room after the student
requested a private hearing. She
identified Lee from Bruno's pictures.
Material Science and Engineering
graduate student Terry McNelly said
that his interview was indeed
interrupted and disrupted by Lee and
others. He also identified Lee from
Bruno's pictures. After recalling
Linsenbardt to make a positive
identification of Lee and Loeb,
Schwartz rested the University's case
against Lee and Loeb.
A meeting has been called for 7:30
p.m. tonight in Columbae to plan a
"militant non-violent action"
protesting the CJP and military
recruiting on the campus. The meeting
will also set groundrules for the action
which all those participating will be
expected to observe.
