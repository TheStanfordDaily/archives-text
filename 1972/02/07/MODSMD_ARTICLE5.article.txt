# CJP Hearings Begin; One Arrest At Protest
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Stanford worker and radical John
Dolly was arrested Saturday morning
by Santa Clara County Sheriffs
deputies during a protest against a
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) hearing in
the Graduate School of Business
(GSB). (See photo sequence on page
six.)
The CJP hearings were being held
for four students charged for the
November 4 "mill-in" at the
Placement Center. The hearings will
continue today starting at 8:00 a.m. in
the conference room of Roscoe Maples
Pavilion. They will be closed to the
public.
Dolly was charged with felonious
assault on a Sheriff's deputy,
interfering with an officer in the
performance of his duty and
disturbing the peace. Dolly posted
$500 bail and was released Saturday.
Dolly's arrest on Saturday was

preceded by the first session of the
CJP Friday in UGLY, over the
Placement Center "mill-in." On trial
for violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption are junior Don Lee of
Venceremos, sophomore Paul Loeb of
the Young Crows, sophomore Pete
Knutson of the Young Crows and
sophomore Steve Downey. They
compose the so-called "Placement
Center 4."
Arriving at the Meyer Library's
Forum Room Friday morning where
six windows and two doors had been
broken Thursday night, the defendants
and their counsel found themselves
"barred" by about 30 demonstrators
at the west doors of the room and
soon left.
Sheriffs Arrive
Santa Clara County Sheriff
Lieutenant Don Tamm arrived outside
the room and asked if anyone was
being barred from entering the room.
No one responded so Tamm entered
for a brief period and then left.
At 9:55, hearing officer Lillian
Altree noted that the defendants were
not present and adjourned the hearing.
In further discussions Altree said that
"given the kinds of circumstances
surrounding them, the hearings are
very fair." She added that although
the CJP was "not perfect, it has the
potential of working quite fairly."
At a 1:00 p.m. rally Friday at the
Placement Center defendants Lee and
Loeb were served by the Stanford
police with summonses for a new
hearing which CJP Chairman John
Kaplan had scheduled for 8:30 a.m.
Saturday at GSB. Counselors Blank,
Schlissel, and Goldscheider were also
served with similar summonses.
On Saturday, about 60
demonstrators began gathering at GSB
at 8:00 a.m. Upon arriving outside
Room 75 they discovered signs on the
doors saying that the hearings were
"not open to the public." Altree said
she had closed the hearings because of
the disturbances Friday morning.
Shortly before 8:30, the time for
which the hearing was scheduled,
twenty riot clad Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Deputies arrived on the scene.
At 8:30, Lee and Loeb arrived with
counselors Owen Blank, David

Schlissel and Peter Goldscheider.
Tac Squad 'Help'
Tamm told Lee that if he or the
others had any difficulty in entering
the hearing room, the Tac Squad
would "help" them past the
demonstrators. When Lee informed
the crowd of this, a narrow corridor
opened up through which Lee, Loeb
and their counsel were escorted by
Tamm and several officers.
Once inside the hearing room, the
defense moved that the case be
continued until Monday morning,
when the other two defendants and
the remaining three counselors could
appear.
Defense counselor Dave Schlissel
told the Daily that the defense desired
a continuance because they "never
expected that they would have a
hearing Saturday."
Hearing officer Altree said that
defendants Knutson and Downey had
severed their case from that of Lee and
Loeb by not appearing at the hearing.
The defense then argued that the
severence was "forced" because the
two absent defendants had not been
summoned.
Judicial Ethics
After Schwartz denied that the
severence had indeed been forced, an
enraged Lee jumped up, loudly
denounced the hearing and walked out
of the room. Outside he told the
waiting demonstrators that the hearing
was not being carried on with "any
kind of judicial ethics or propriety."
Loeb and the defense counsel
quickly followed Lee out of the room
and Altree recessed the hearing. After
the counsel had made brief speeches to
the protesters they went back into
Room 75 to carry on a private, two
hour discussion with Schwartz. The
focus of the discussion was on the
defense motion for a continuance of
the hearing until Monday.
While the hearings were going on
inside GSB, the Sheriff's deputies had
surrounded the demonstrators outside.
It was then that John Dolly began to
loudly question Tamm about "what
the fuck are you doing?" Dolly asked
if the demonstration was an illegal
assembly, and when told by Tamm
