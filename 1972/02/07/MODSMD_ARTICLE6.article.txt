# White House Singing Protester Speaks For Peace In Los Altos
## 
### JIM FRIEND 
Carol Feraci, the singer who last
week produced a "Stop the Killing"
banner while performing in the East
Room of the White House, and gave
President Nixon a speech condemning
the war in Vietnam, was the honored
guest of the Emergency Committee to
Stop the Escalation of the War in
Vietnam Sunday afternoon at
Congregation Beth Am in Los Altos.
About 100 people paid the three
dollar "donation" to hear Feraci. She
mingled informally for about an hour
and then spoke briefly to the
enthusiastic crowd. Among those
present was Stanford theologian
Robert McAfee Brown.
Feraci has been the object of a great
deal of public attention since her
public denunciation of the President's
war policies. Martha Mitchell said, "I
think she ought to be torn
limb-from-limb."
Despite the criticism that she has
encountered, Feraci is quite happy
about her decision. "I couldn't keep
quiet" claimed the thirty year old
Canadian entertainer. "Especially since
I had such an opportunity."
Moral Reasons
She says that she refused to appear
at first for moral reasons, but later
decided upon her protest and chose

to be part of the entertainment. She
said that no one in the group had any
knowledge of her intentions.
Immediate reaction to the speech
was negative. "Everyone was shocked"
she recalls. Feraci told President Nixon
that . . if Jesus Christ was in this
room tonight you would not dare to
drop another bomb . . .
Shortly after she spoke the audience
and numerous members of the Ray
Conniff group began to shout "throw
her out." Ray Conniff, who she says
took the protest as "a personal
affront," then informed Feraci that
she should leave and she did.
The Secret Service detained Feraci
for over an hour and then allowed her
to leave.
Feraci feels that she has now set a
precedent and that future entertainers

"won't go to the White House without
thinking about it."
She received her first professional
work singing with a group called the
Young Americans, a "right wing
organization" as she calls them. She
has since appeared on several television
shows including the Hollywood Palace,
the Smothers Brothers, and the John
Gary Show.
Asked about the future Feraci says
she "isn't sure what is going to
happen." She recently appeared on the
Jim Dunbar television show and is
leaving on Monday for Chicago and
another television appearance
regarding her White House protest.
Life Precious
She calls claims that she staged the
protest as a publicity stunt
"ridiculous."

the war in Vietnam, was the honored
guest of the Emergency Committee to
Stop the Escalation of the War in
Vietnam Sunday afternoon at
Congregation Beth Am in Los Altos.
About 100 people paid the three
dollar "donation" to hear Feraci. She
mingled informally for about an hour
and then spoke briefly to the
enthusiastic crowd. Among those
present was Stanford theologian
Robert McAfee Brown.
Feraci has been the object of a great
deal of public attention since her
public denunciation of the President's
war policies. Martha Mitchell said, "I
think she ought to be torn
limb-from-limb."
Despite the criticism that she has
encountered, Feraci is quite happy
about her decision. "I couldn't keep
quiet" claimed the thirty year old
Canadian entertainer. "Especially since
I had such an opportunity."
Moral Reasons
She says that she refused to appear
at first for moral reasons, but later
decided upon her protest and chose

to be part of the entertainment. She
said that no one in the group had any
knowledge of her intentions.
Immediate reaction to the speech
was negative. "Everyone was shocked"
she recalls. Feraci told President Nixon
that . . if Jesus Christ was in this
room tonight you would not dare to
drop another bomb . . .
Shortly after she spoke the audience
and numerous members of the Ray
Conniff group began to shout "throw
her out." Ray Conniff, who she says
took the protest as "a personal
affront," then informed Feraci that
she should leave and she did.
The Secret Service detained Feraci
for over an hour and then allowed her
to leave.
Feraci feels that she has now set a
precedent and that future entertainers

"won't go to the White House without
thinking about it."
She received her first professional
work singing with a group called the
Young Americans, a "right wing
organization" as she calls them. She
has since appeared on several television
shows including the Hollywood Palace,
the Smothers Brothers, and the John
Gary Show.
Asked about the future Feraci says
she "isn't sure what is going to
happen." She recently appeared on the
Jim Dunbar television show and is
leaving on Monday for Chicago and
another television appearance
regarding her White House protest.
Life Precious
She calls claims that she staged the
protest as a publicity stunt
"ridiculous."

WOMEN'S (AD) LIB-Last week Carol Feraci spoke her mind on the Indochina
War before President Nixon in the White House. Yesterday she explained her
protest before a group of about 100 Midpeninsula citizens in Los Altos. The
30-year-old entertainer's visit was sponsored by a local anti-war group.

week produced a "Stop the Killing"
banner while performing in the East
