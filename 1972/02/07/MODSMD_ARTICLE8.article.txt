## Indian Symbol Must Be Changed 
### 
lois amsterdam

The petition from the Stanford
Native American Community
raises two issues of importance.
The Stanford Indian Symbol
The first subject of the petition
— Stanford's continued use of the
Indian symbol in the 1970's —
brings up to visibility a painful
lack of sensitivity and awareness
on the part of the University. All
of us have in some way, by action
or inaction, accepted and
supported the use of the Indian
symbol on campus. We did not do
so with malice, or with intent to
defile a racial group. Rather, it
was a reflection of our society's
retarded understanding, dulled
perception and clouded vision.
Sensitivity and awareness do not
come easily when childish
misrepresentations in games,
history books and motion pictures
make up a large part of our
experience.
Because of our students, we
now have the chance to know the
Native American as one knows
any other real and intelligent
human beings; and we appreciate
that we owe the Native American
What all human beings are owed:
respect and dignity. Perhaps we
owe our Native American
Community an even greater debt
for awakening us to this
perception, by which we are made
more human.
The awakening compels an
immediate, positive and specific
response to their petition. The
Office of the Ombudsman
therefore urges and recommends
that Any And All Stanford
University Use Of The Indian
Symbol Should Be Immediately
Disavowed And Permanently
Stopped.
Athletic Teams and Events
I cannot add to the obvious
force of the petition's statement
on the demeaning exploitation of
a race of people as a symbol for
sport and entertainment. Whether
it be a team name, "mascot," or
dollie, all must be condemned as
the progency of an offensive use.

I do feel impelled however to
speak on a tangential problem. I
have heard and read of the
possible adverse reaction of our
alumni to the abandonment of the
Indian symbol. It is true that the
symbol has been utilized for many
years, and has therefore been
nostalgically incorporated into
some alumni activity and thought.
But our alumni devotion is of a
deeper sort. The alumni are
attached and committed to a
University, and to the men and
women who represent the
traditions, goals and aspirations of
that University. They do not
revere a symbol for its own sake,
but rather take pride in the
students who do their best to
represent Stanford in competitive
sport and intellectual endeavor.
The alumni will be proud when
their University removes any
vestige of a symbolic use which
degrades and insults members of
our community. Surely we do not
expect less from our alumni than
we do from ourselves; and we
should not disparage the alumni
by assuming that they would cling
obstinately to a symbol of the
past whose present
inappropriateness has become
plainly apparent.
Publications, Pennants,
The Indian symbol has
unhappily worked its way into
various particularly demeaning
materials distributed on campus
and off. This is understandable. It
is natural to capitalize upon any
university's symbol and even to
lighten the symbol's spirit with
caricature. This truth, however,
points up the importance of
curing the problem at its root. For
it is in the nature of a University
symbol that the University itself
cannot fully control its display: it
will be portrayed by many —
individual students, Stanford
sports fans, fans of Stanford's
athletic opponents, newscasters,
commercial exploiters — in ways
which the University itself cannot
restrict. Whatever Stanford's

symbol, it will inevitably be
chalked or painted in various
places by various hands,
sometimes under conditions of
haste and in a temper of gaiety or
derision. In these uses, caricature
and parody are inevitable. All of
this is as it should be; and it will
be perfectly acceptable when the
University itself selects a symbol
appropriate for such treatment.
The subjection of a racial group to
treatment of this sort is, however,
altogether unacceptable.
Native American Program
The petition's second point —
that the University should
improve its Native American
Program — is a matter of at least
equal importance but greater
complexity. I have had the
chance, in recent days, to discuss
it extensively with our Native
American students, with their
advisor and counselor, Gwen
Shunatona, and with other
members of the
Community who are especially
knowledgeable about minority
affairs.
It does appear that the Native
American Program as presently
operated has serious deficiencies
which both handicap our Native
American students in benefiting
from the educational potential of
the University and handicap the
University in realizing its
commitment to the Native
American group. There is a
problem, for example, in the
absence of adequate supporting
personnel; and there appears to be
a need for special academic
programs and support.
I am presently exploring these
and other problems further, and I
plan to make recommendations to
you concerning them within
another ten days or two weeks. I
would not want to make specific
recommendations on these
subjects without some further
study of details; but neither did I
want to delay my
recommendation on the pressing
matter of the Indian symbol until
the separable questions relating to
the Native American Program
could be fully worked through.
Because of the intensity of feeling
of our Native American
Community with regard to the
Indian symbol, the obvious justice
of their grievance, and the relative

simplicity of the remedy, I hope
that we can move quickly on the
matter. For that reason, I do not
recommend the kind of
committee consideration which
might be appropriate for a more
complex matter or one as to
which various segments of the
Community ought to be
consulted. A committee may be
appropriate, of course, to choose
a new symbol; but neither a
committee nor the input of
popular opinion seems
appropriate on the question
whether the University should
cease to use a debasing racial
symbol.

University, and to the men and
women who represent the
traditions, goals and aspirations of
that University. They do not
revere a symbol for its own sake,
but rather take pride in the
students who do their best to
represent Stanford in competitive
sport and intellectual endeavor.
The alumni will be proud when
their University removes any
vestige of a symbolic use which
degrades and insults members of
our community. Surely we do not
expect less from our alumni than
we do from ourselves; and we
should not disparage the alumni
by assuming that they would cling
obstinately to a symbol of the
past whose present
inappropriateness has become
plainly apparent.
Publications, Pennants,
The Indian symbol has
unhappily worked its way into
various particularly demeaning
materials distributed on campus
and off. This is understandable. It
is natural to capitalize upon any
university's symbol and even to
lighten the symbol's spirit with
caricature. This truth, however,
points up the importance of
curing the problem at its root. For
it is in the nature of a University
symbol that the University itself
cannot fully control its display: it
will be portrayed by many —
individual students, Stanford
sports fans, fans of Stanford's
athletic opponents, newscasters,
commercial exploiters — in ways
which the University itself cannot
restrict. Whatever Stanford's

symbol, it will inevitably be
chalked or painted in various
places by various hands,
sometimes under conditions of
haste and in a temper of gaiety or
derision. In these uses, caricature
and parody are inevitable. All of
this is as it should be; and it will
be perfectly acceptable when the
University itself selects a symbol
appropriate for such treatment.
The subjection of a racial group to
treatment of this sort is, however,
altogether unacceptable.
Native American Program
The petition's second point —
that the University should
improve its Native American
Program — is a matter of at least
equal importance but greater
complexity. I have had the
chance, in recent days, to discuss
it extensively with our Native
American students, with their
advisor and counselor, Gwen
Shunatona, and with other
members of the
Community who are especially
knowledgeable about minority
affairs.
It does appear that the Native
American Program as presently
operated has serious deficiencies
which both handicap our Native
American students in benefiting
from the educational potential of
the University and handicap the
University in realizing its
commitment to the Native
American group. There is a
problem, for example, in the
absence of adequate supporting
personnel; and there appears to be
a need for special academic
programs and support.
I am presently exploring these
and other problems further, and I
plan to make recommendations to
you concerning them within
another ten days or two weeks. I
would not want to make specific
recommendations on these
subjects without some further
study of details; but neither did I
want to delay my
recommendation on the pressing
matter of the Indian symbol until
the separable questions relating to
the Native American Program
could be fully worked through.
Because of the intensity of feeling
of our Native American
Community with regard to the
Indian symbol, the obvious justice
of their grievance, and the relative

simplicity of the remedy, I hope
that we can move quickly on the
matter. For that reason, I do not
recommend the kind of
committee consideration which
might be appropriate for a more
complex matter or one as to
which various segments of the
Community ought to be
consulted. A committee may be
appropriate, of course, to choose
a new symbol; but neither a
committee nor the input of
popular opinion seems
appropriate on the question
whether the University should
cease to use a debasing racial
symbol.

The petition from the Stanford
Native American Community
raises two issues of importance.
The Stanford Indian Symbol
The first subject of the petition
— Stanford's continued use of the
Indian symbol in the 1970's —
brings up to visibility a painful
lack of sensitivity and awareness
on the part of the University. All
of us have in some way, by action
or inaction, accepted and
supported the use of the Indian
symbol on campus. We did not do
so with malice, or with intent to
defile a racial group. Rather, it
was a reflection of our society's
retarded understanding, dulled
perception and clouded vision.
Sensitivity and awareness do not
come easily when childish
misrepresentations in games,
history books and motion pictures
make up a large part of our
experience.
Because of our students, we
now have the chance to know the
Native American as one knows
any other real and intelligent
human beings; and we appreciate
that we owe the Native American
What all human beings are owed:
respect and dignity. Perhaps we
owe our Native American
Community an even greater debt
for awakening us to this
perception, by which we are made
more human.
The awakening compels an
immediate, positive and specific
response to their petition. The
Office of the Ombudsman
therefore urges and recommends
that Any And All Stanford
University Use Of The Indian
Symbol Should Be Immediately
Disavowed And Permanently
Stopped.
Athletic Teams and Events
I cannot add to the obvious
force of the petition's statement
on the demeaning exploitation of
a race of people as a symbol for
sport and entertainment. Whether
it be a team name, "mascot," or
dollie, all must be condemned as
the progency of an offensive use.

I do feel impelled however to
speak on a tangential problem. I
have heard and read of the
possible adverse reaction of our
alumni to the abandonment of the
Indian symbol. It is true that the
symbol has been utilized for many
years, and has therefore been
nostalgically incorporated into
some alumni activity and thought.
But our alumni devotion is of a
deeper sort. The alumni are
attached and committed to a
University, and to the men and
women who represent the
traditions, goals and aspirations of
that University. They do not
revere a symbol for its own sake,
but rather take pride in the

knowledgeable about minority
affairs.
It does appear that the Native
American Program as presently
operated has serious deficiencies
which both handicap our Native
American students in benefiting
from the educational potential of
the University and handicap the
University in realizing its
commitment to the Native
American group. There is a
problem, for example, in the
absence of adequate supporting
personnel; and there appears to be
a need for special academic
programs and support.
I am presently exploring these
and other problems further, and I
plan to make recommendations to
you concerning them within
another ten days or two weeks. I
would not want to make specific
recommendations on these
subjects without some further
study of details; but neither did I
want to delay my
recommendation on the pressing
matter of the Indian symbol until
the separable questions relating to
the Native American Program
could be fully worked through.
Because of the intensity of feeling
of our Native American
Community with regard to the
Indian symbol, the obvious justice
of their grievance, and the relative

simplicity of the remedy, I hope
that we can move quickly on the
matter. For that reason, I do not
recommend the kind of
committee consideration which
might be appropriate for a more
complex matter or one as to
which various segments of the
Community ought to be
consulted. A committee may be
appropriate, of course, to choose
a new symbol; but neither a
committee nor the input of
popular opinion seems
appropriate on the question
whether the University should
cease to use a debasing racial
symbol.

The petition from the Stanford
Native American Community
raises two issues of importance.
The Stanford Indian Symbol
The first subject of the petition
— Stanford's continued use of the
Indian symbol in the 1970's —
brings up to visibility a painful
lack of sensitivity and awareness
on the part of the University. All
of us have in some way, by action
or inaction, accepted and
supported the use of the Indian
symbol on campus. We did not do
so with malice, or with intent to
defile a racial group. Rather, it
was a reflection of our society's
retarded understanding, dulled
perception and clouded vision.
Sensitivity and awareness do not
come easily when childish
misrepresentations in games,
history books and motion pictures
make up a large part of our
experience.
Because of our students, we
now have the chance to know the
Native American as one knows
any other real and intelligent
human beings; and we appreciate
that we owe the Native American
What all human beings are owed:
respect and dignity. Perhaps we
owe our Native American
Community an even greater debt
for awakening us to this
perception, by which we are made
more human.
The awakening compels an
immediate, positive and specific
response to their petition. The
Office of the Ombudsman
therefore urges and recommends
that Any And All Stanford
University Use Of The Indian
Symbol Should Be Immediately
Disavowed And Permanently
Stopped.
Athletic Teams and Events
I cannot add to the obvious
force of the petition's statement
on the demeaning exploitation of
a race of people as a symbol for
sport and entertainment. Whether
it be a team name, "mascot," or
dollie, all must be condemned as
the progency of an offensive use.

I do feel impelled however to
speak on a tangential problem. I
have heard and read of the
possible adverse reaction of our
alumni to the abandonment of the
Indian symbol. It is true that the
symbol has been utilized for many
years, and has therefore been
nostalgically incorporated into
some alumni activity and thought.
But our alumni devotion is of a
deeper sort. The alumni are
attached and committed to a
University, and to the men and
women who represent the
traditions, goals and aspirations of
that University. They do not
revere a symbol for its own sake,
but rather take pride in the
students who do their best to
represent Stanford in competitive
sport and intellectual endeavor.
The alumni will be proud when
their University removes any
vestige of a symbolic use which
degrades and insults members of
our community. Surely we do not
expect less from our alumni than
we do from ourselves; and we
should not disparage the alumni
by assuming that they would cling
obstinately to a symbol of the
past whose present
inappropriateness has become
plainly apparent.
Publications, Pennants,
The Indian symbol has
unhappily worked its way into
various particularly demeaning
materials distributed on campus
and off. This is understandable. It
is natural to capitalize upon any
university's symbol and even to
lighten the symbol's spirit with
caricature. This truth, however,
points up the importance of
curing the problem at its root. For
it is in the nature of a University
symbol that the University itself
cannot fully control its display: it
will be portrayed by many —
individual students, Stanford
sports fans, fans of Stanford's
athletic opponents, newscasters,
commercial exploiters — in ways
which the University itself cannot
restrict. Whatever Stanford's

symbol, it will inevitably be
chalked or painted in various
places by various hands,
sometimes under conditions of
haste and in a temper of gaiety or
derision. In these uses, caricature
and parody are inevitable. All of
this is as it should be; and it will
be perfectly acceptable when the
University itself selects a symbol
appropriate for such treatment.
The subjection of a racial group to
treatment of this sort is, however,
altogether unacceptable.
Native American Program
The petition's second point —
that the University should
improve its Native American
Program — is a matter of at least
equal importance but greater
complexity. I have had the
chance, in recent days, to discuss
it extensively with our Native
American students, with their
advisor and counselor, Gwen
Shunatona, and with other
members of the
Community who are especially
knowledgeable about minority
affairs.
It does appear that the Native
American Program as presently
operated has serious deficiencies
which both handicap our Native
American students in benefiting
from the educational potential of
the University and handicap the
University in realizing its
commitment to the Native
American group. There is a

absence of adequate supporting
personnel; and there appears to be
