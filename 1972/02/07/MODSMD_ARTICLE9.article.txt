Racism?
Editor, THE DAILY
This is written in response to
the article entitled "Three Cases
of Racism" which appeared in the
Daily on Wednesday, February 2.
In that article, the "campus and
public at large" were informed of
a "racist event"involving nine
stolen bicycles found in the
MECHA house.
I, for one, fail to see the racist
overtones in this particular
instance, although that is not my
reason for writing this. What I do
see is a misrepresentation of the
facts of the case, as few as those

facts may be, and I will attempt
to clear up some basic
discrepancies.
Contrary to what was stated in
that article, Andrew Baldwin did
not say that he had been told "by
an unknown informer that his
missing bicycle could be found at
the casa." Baldwin had talked
with Ed Luce, who had witnessed
the theft of two bicycles from
Lagunita Hall on Sunday night,
and was told that a van identical
to the MECHA van may have been
used in the thefts. Baldwin, who
resides at the same address as
Luce and whose bicycle was also
stolen on Sunday night, then

proceeded to investigate on his
own. It was under these
circumstances that he happened
to spot his own bicycle through a
bay window of the MECHA
house. Thus, there was never any
"unknown informer".
The MECHA officers have
implied, in successive articles in
the Daily, that an unknown
informer placed the stolen
bicycles in their house and then
contacted Baldwin, one of the
theft victims.
If Jesse Calvillo and Delia Islas
really want to find out who has
discredited the MECHA house,
they could begin by asking some
questions of other people involved
with their organization. For
instance; who has access to the
MECHA van? Who was on the
night shift at the casa on Sunday
night; Where was the MECHA van
on Sunday night? The MECHA
officers have stated in the Daily
that one person did see the
bicycles on Monday morning but
did not report it. Then isn't it
possible that the bicycles were
placed in the house on Sunday
night, the night they were stolen?
Obviously, the entire MECHA
household should not be held
responsible for the stolen bicycles.
But perhaps if some members
took a little time to look into the
case, rather than just passing it off
as another blatant example of
racism against Chicanos on the
Stanford campus, it might be
cleared up. pjj- t
v Eddie Luce,

Interaction
Editor, THE DAILY:
Student interaction with the

president of this University tends
to degenerate to the level of
grade-school playground feuds.
Such was the case with the KZSU
debate on the Placement Center,
and such is seen in the reply to
Doug McHenry printed in the
Daily on January 31.
So, in response to Lyman's
invective that McHenry wants
students to dominate
decision-making, an appropriate
response from my grade-school
days is "It takes one to call one."
Remember how Lyman said he
alone would make the Placement
Center decision regardless of the
student referendum and the
pending COSS report? Remember
how he declared Bruce Franklin
suspended before any hearings
into the charges had taken place?
Remember the many times he has
called police on campus, and then
seen them beat even innocent
students? He has taken full
responsibility for all these
decisions, proclaiming in effect:
"I am the PRESIDENT. I am the
OFFICIAL POWER of Stanford
University. None dare call
themselves Stanford but I."
Domination? He knows what he is
talking about.
But Mr. Lyman was right on
one thing. On those matters that
directly affect students more than
any other group, we do want to
dominate the decision-making
process. And we should! Wo
should make and implement
decisions on student services, for
example, including some degree of
influence on teaching, the primary
student service. We cannot leave
control of our lives with Lyman,
and suffer his domination.
Because we are alive, we must try

to control our lives for ourselves.
McHenry says that students
have not been allowed to
participate in any legitimate
manner in the decision-making
process. Lyman calls that untrue.
The only way to approach this
stand-off is with facts on specific
decisions that have been of vital
importance to students. Students
did not participate in any
legitimate manner in the decision
to fire Franklin. It has already
been decided that students will
not participate in any legitimate
manner in the decision to allow
the military and related industry
to recruit at the Placement
Center. The ASSU presidents
found out that they could do
nothing to stop the police from
being brought on campus last
week.
This is not to say that students
should have dominated these
decisions in the way the
administration did. No one should
monopolize decision-making, and
wield power like that. Students
should have a measure of power in
all decisions, and we should
dominate in those decisions that
affect us more than any other
group.

About McCabe's article on
Franklin: the latter did endanger
the University. Freedom of
speech, under a pervasive threat of
revolutionary terror, was
concretely imperiled. And there
were destructive actions.
Justice Holmes' interpretation
of the First Amendment referred
to subversive activity of a citizen
as such. To be dismissed from an
institution whose ground rules are
being violated is not the same
thing as being punished or exiled
by the State. To deny an
institution this basic freedom
would be to make nonsense of

how he declared Bruce Franklin
suspended before any hearings
into the charges had taken place?

called police on campus, and then
seen them beat even innocent
students? He has taken full
responsibility for all these
decisions, proclaiming in effect:
"I am the PRESIDENT. I am the
OFFICIAL POWER of Stanford
University. None dare call
themselves Stanford but I."
Domination? He knows what he is
talking about.
But Mr. Lyman was right on
one thing. On those matters that
directly affect students more than
any other group, we do want to
dominate the decision-making
process. And we should! Wo
should make and implement
decisions on student services, for
example, including some degree of
influence on teaching, the primary
student service. We cannot leave
control of our lives with Lyman,
and suffer his domination.
Because we are alive, we must try

to control our lives for ourselves.
McHenry says that students
have not been allowed to
participate in any legitimate
manner in the decision-making
process. Lyman calls that untrue.
The only way to approach this
stand-off is with facts on specific
decisions that have been of vital
importance to students. Students
did not participate in any
legitimate manner in the decision
to fire Franklin. It has already
been decided that students will
not participate in any legitimate
manner in the decision to allow
the military and related industry
to recruit at the Placement
Center. The ASSU presidents
found out that they could do
nothing to stop the police from
being brought on campus last
week.
This is not to say that students

About McCabe's article on
Franklin: the latter did endanger
the University. Freedom of
speech, under a pervasive threat of
revolutionary terror, was
concretely imperiled. And there
were destructive actions.
Justice Holmes' interpretation

to subversive activity of a citizen

This is written in response to
the article entitled "Three Cases
of Racism" which appeared in the
Daily on Wednesday, February 2.
In that article, the "campus and
public at large" were informed of
a "racist event"involving nine
stolen bicycles found in the
MECHA house.
I, for one, fail to see the racist
overtones in this particular
instance, although that is not my
reason for writing this. What I do
see is a misrepresentation of the
facts of the case, as few as those

facts may be, and I will attempt
to clear up some basic
discrepancies.
Contrary to what was stated in
that article, Andrew Baldwin did
not say that he had been told "by
an unknown informer that his
missing bicycle could be found at
the casa." Baldwin had talked
with Ed Luce, who had witnessed
the theft of two bicycles from
Lagunita Hall on Sunday night,
and was told that a van identical
to the MECHA van may have been
used in the thefts. Baldwin, who
resides at the same address as
Luce and whose bicycle was also
stolen on Sunday night, then

proceeded to investigate on his
own. It was under these
circumstances that he happened
to spot his own bicycle through a
bay window of the MECHA
house. Thus, there was never any
"unknown informer".
The MECHA officers have
implied, in successive articles in
the Daily, that an unknown
informer placed the stolen
bicycles in their house and then
contacted Baldwin, one of the
theft victims.
If Jesse Calvillo and Delia Islas
really want to find out who has
discredited the MECHA house,
they could begin by asking some
questions of other people involved
with their organization. For
instance; who has access to the
MECHA van? Who was on the
night shift at the casa on Sunday
night; Where was the MECHA van
on Sunday night? The MECHA
officers have stated in the Daily
that one person did see the
bicycles on Monday morning but
did not report it. Then isn't it
possible that the bicycles were
placed in the house on Sunday
night, the night they were stolen?
Obviously, the entire MECHA
household should not be held
responsible for the stolen bicycles.
But perhaps if some members
took a little time to look into the
case, rather than just passing it off
as another blatant example of
racism against Chicanos on the
Stanford campus, it might be
cleared up. pjj- t

Student interaction with the

to degenerate to the level of
grade-school playground feuds.
Such was the case with the KZSU

So, in response to Lyman's

Remember how Lyman said he
alone would make the Placement

Contrary to what was stated in
that article, Andrew Baldwin did
not say that he had been told "by
an unknown informer that his
missing bicycle could be found at
the casa." Baldwin had talked
with Ed Luce, who had witnessed
the theft of two bicycles from
Lagunita Hall on Sunday night,
and was told that a van identical
to the MECHA van may have been
used in the thefts. Baldwin, who
resides at the same address as
Luce and whose bicycle was also
stolen on Sunday night, then

proceeded to investigate on his
own. It was under these
circumstances that he happened
to spot his own bicycle through a
bay window of the MECHA
house. Thus, there was never any
"unknown informer".
The MECHA officers have
implied, in successive articles in
the Daily, that an unknown
informer placed the stolen
bicycles in their house and then
contacted Baldwin, one of the
theft victims.
If Jesse Calvillo and Delia Islas
really want to find out who has
discredited the MECHA house,
they could begin by asking some
questions of other people involved
with their organization. For
instance; who has access to the
MECHA van? Who was on the
night shift at the casa on Sunday
night; Where was the MECHA van
on Sunday night? The MECHA
officers have stated in the Daily
that one person did see the
bicycles on Monday morning but
did not report it. Then isn't it
possible that the bicycles were
placed in the house on Sunday
night, the night they were stolen?
Obviously, the entire MECHA
household should not be held
responsible for the stolen bicycles.
But perhaps if some members
took a little time to look into the
case, rather than just passing it off
as another blatant example of
racism against Chicanos on the
Stanford campus, it might be
cleared up. pjj- t

Interaction
Editor, THE DAILY:
Student interaction with the

president of this University tends
to degenerate to the level of
grade-school playground feuds.
Such was the case with the KZSU
debate on the Placement Center,
and such is seen in the reply to
Doug McHenry printed in the
Daily on January 31.
So, in response to Lyman's
invective that McHenry wants
students to dominate
decision-making, an appropriate
response from my grade-school
days is "It takes one to call one."
Remember how Lyman said he
alone would make the Placement
Center decision regardless of the
student referendum and the
pending COSS report? Remember
how he declared Bruce Franklin
suspended before any hearings
into the charges had taken place?
Remember the many times he has
called police on campus, and then
seen them beat even innocent
students? He has taken full
responsibility for all these
decisions, proclaiming in effect:
"I am the PRESIDENT. I am the
OFFICIAL POWER of Stanford
University. None dare call
themselves Stanford but I."
Domination? He knows what he is
talking about.
But Mr. Lyman was right on
one thing. On those matters that
directly affect students more than
any other group, we do want to
dominate the decision-making
process. And we should! Wo
should make and implement
decisions on student services, for
example, including some degree of
influence on teaching, the primary
student service. We cannot leave
control of our lives with Lyman,
and suffer his domination.
Because we are alive, we must try

to control our lives for ourselves.
McHenry says that students
have not been allowed to
participate in any legitimate
manner in the decision-making
process. Lyman calls that untrue.
The only way to approach this
stand-off is with facts on specific
decisions that have been of vital
importance to students. Students
did not participate in any
legitimate manner in the decision
to fire Franklin. It has already
been decided that students will
not participate in any legitimate
manner in the decision to allow
the military and related industry
to recruit at the Placement
Center. The ASSU presidents
found out that they could do
nothing to stop the police from
being brought on campus last
week.
This is not to say that students
should have dominated these
decisions in the way the
administration did. No one should
monopolize decision-making, and
wield power like that. Students
should have a measure of power in
all decisions, and we should
dominate in those decisions that
affect us more than any other
group.

Freedom imperiled
Editor, THE DAILY:
About McCabe's article on
Franklin: the latter did endanger
the University. Freedom of
speech, under a pervasive threat of
revolutionary terror, was
concretely imperiled. And there
were destructive actions.
Justice Holmes' interpretation
of the First Amendment referred
to subversive activity of a citizen
as such. To be dismissed from an
institution whose ground rules are
being violated is not the same
thing as being punished or exiled
by the State. To deny an
institution this basic freedom
would be to make nonsense of
law.

Racism?
Editor, THE DAILY
This is written in response to
the article entitled "Three Cases
of Racism" which appeared in the
Daily on Wednesday, February 2.
In that article, the "campus and
public at large" were informed of
a "racist event"involving nine
stolen bicycles found in the
MECHA house.
I, for one, fail to see the racist
overtones in this particular
instance, although that is not my
reason for writing this. What I do
see is a misrepresentation of the
facts of the case, as few as those

facts may be, and I will attempt
to clear up some basic
discrepancies.
Contrary to what was stated in
that article, Andrew Baldwin did
not say that he had been told "by
an unknown informer that his
