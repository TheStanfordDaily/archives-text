# Ex-President Recalls Pressures
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT (First of four parts) 
Kenneth Pitzer's stormy term as
Stanford's president was enough to
make him swear off jobs as a college
administrator.
"I decided that from now on,
administration was somebody else's
role, not mine," Pitzer explained in a
Daily interview Friday in Berkeley.
Pitzer is once again a Chemistry
professor at UC Berkeley, a position
he left in 1961 to become president of
Rice University in Houston. Pitzer
came to Stanford at the end of 1968,
but resigned less than two years later.
The quiet chemist recalled the
problems he faced when he moved
from smaller, quieter Rice: "When 1
came to Stanford, it was perfectly
obvious that there were going to be
pressures in terms of student
radicalism and the demonstrations.
"But I'd hoped that the
national-international situations
tending to generate this would be
solved much faster than they were or
have been," Pitzer recalled.

With his usual short and choppy
laugh, Pitzer admits that the job of
handling sit-ins and trashing made the
Stanford presidency "less to my taste
and interests than I had hoped. I
suspect the challenge of dealing with
that kind of problem might have been
more attractive to some people than it
was to me."
Pitzer wonders whether the
Stanford disruptions of three and four
years ago may have overwhelmed any
president: "In very troubled times, it
may simply be impossible for any one
person to last through the whole
period."
But Pitzer adds that he had a
problem not faced by all presidents —
the continuing alumni reactions to his
outspoken comments against the
Vietnam War, the draft, and the
invasion of Cambodia.
"There's no question that the
alumni and other supporters upon
which a private institution is
particularly dependent just don't like
it when the president of the institution
takes a personal position on a quite

extraneous subject," Pitzer
commented.
He conceded that anyone leading
an institution must worry "whether
expressing your personal views about
some national and international
question may interfere with the
progress of the organization that
you're heading."
But Pitzer added, "Nonetheless, I
felt that I wasn't going to go very far
in restraining myself as a citizen
because of a role in some institution."
He pointed to Yale's president
Kingman Brewster as one liberal
president who has successfully
expressed his opinions: "Kingman
certainly is as candid about his views
as anyone. On the other hand, there
were certain other factors that may
have made it more feasible in his case,
or maybe he just did a better job."
Stanford's Board of Trustees "went
along" with Pitzer's statements against
the war, he commented. But most of
the trustees wished that he would have
kept his views to himself: "While the
Board held varying opinions on these
issues, it seemed to me that most of
the Board members were inclined not
to express their opinions for the same
old reason: that it might offend
somebody, and therefore, why not
keep quiet instead?"
Pitzer said he had fewer problems
expressing personal opinions at Rice,
partly because he spoke there of
"institution-related issues"
particularly his successful effort to
desegregate the Southern college.
He explained that the chairman of
Rice's trustees "was quite outspoken
himself — usually on the same side of

the same issues. Whereas the pressure
was on the chairman, the president
sort of looked better by comparison.
His strong public position cer
tainly helpful."
Pitzer was also criticized by alumni
who felt he failed to deal firmly with
campus disruptions. They objected to
his reluctance to call in outside police
before internal mediation of sit-ins
failed.
Pitzer recalled, "1 think there are
many in the outside who just thought
that any sort of disruption should be
put down with great speed and
firmness. These people usually have no
particular idea of just how you are
going to accomplish this or what the
remaining consequences might be.
"But they are still very upset when
they continue to read in the
newspapers of disturbances at their
alma mater," Pitzer said. "There were
various reasons why it didn't seem
feasible to me to take any course very
much different than the one we
followed, even on hindsight."
Asked about his emphatic
endorsement of campus judicial
systems, Pitzer said, "Stanford
certainly must have a mechanism of
internal discipline and maintenance of
order that's more effective than it was
at that time. But the history of the
breakdown of previous internal
discipline systems meant that you
probably sort of had to work with the
one you had, nurse it along a bit and
try to improve it, rather than just
throw it out and try to start over again
another time."
(Tomorrow: Pitzer reviews the
confrontations he faced during his first
year as President.)

Vietnam War, the draft, and the
invasion of Cambodia.
"There's no question that the
alumni and other supporters upon
which a private institution is
particularly dependent just don't like
it when the president of the institution
takes a personal position on a quite

extraneous subject," Pitzer
commented.
He conceded that anyone leading
an institution must worry "whether
expressing your personal views about
some national and international
question may interfere with the
progress of the organization that
you're heading."
But Pitzer added, "Nonetheless, I
felt that I wasn't going to go very far
in restraining myself as a citizen
because of a role in some institution."
He pointed to Yale's president
Kingman Brewster as one liberal
president who has successfully
expressed his opinions: "Kingman
certainly is as candid about his views
as anyone. On the other hand, there
were certain other factors that may
have made it more feasible in his case,
or maybe he just did a better job."
Stanford's Board of Trustees "went
along" with Pitzer's statements against
the war, he commented. But most of
the trustees wished that he would have
kept his views to himself: "While the
Board held varying opinions on these
issues, it seemed to me that most of
the Board members were inclined not
to express their opinions for the same
old reason: that it might offend
somebody, and therefore, why not
keep quiet instead?"
Pitzer said he had fewer problems
expressing personal opinions at Rice,
partly because he spoke there of
"institution-related issues"
particularly his successful effort to
desegregate the Southern college.
He explained that the chairman of
Rice's trustees "was quite outspoken
himself — usually on the same side of

the same issues. Whereas the pressure
was on the chairman, the president
sort of looked better by comparison.
His strong public position cer
tainly helpful."
Pitzer was also criticized by alumni
who felt he failed to deal firmly with
campus disruptions. They objected to
his reluctance to call in outside police
before internal mediation of sit-ins
failed.
Pitzer recalled, "1 think there are
many in the outside who just thought
that any sort of disruption should be
put down with great speed and
firmness. These people usually have no
particular idea of just how you are
going to accomplish this or what the
remaining consequences might be.
"But they are still very upset when
they continue to read in the
newspapers of disturbances at their
alma mater," Pitzer said. "There were
various reasons why it didn't seem
feasible to me to take any course very
much different than the one we
followed, even on hindsight."
Asked about his emphatic
endorsement of campus judicial
systems, Pitzer said, "Stanford
certainly must have a mechanism of
internal discipline and maintenance of
order that's more effective than it was
at that time. But the history of the
breakdown of previous internal
discipline systems meant that you
probably sort of had to work with the
one you had, nurse it along a bit and
try to improve it, rather than just
throw it out and try to start over again
another time."

confrontations he faced during his first
year as President.)

REMEMBER? -Kenneth Pitzer, now a Chemistry professor at UC Berkeley,
recalls the "pressures of student radicalism" which he faced as Stanford
president. He describes strong reactions from alumni who objected to his
statements against the Vietnam War.
Kenneth Pitzer's stormy term as
Stanford's president was enough to
make him swear off jobs as a college
administrator.
"I decided that from now on,
administration was somebody else's
role, not mine," Pitzer explained in a
Daily interview Friday in Berkeley.
Pitzer is once again a Chemistry
professor at UC Berkeley, a position
he left in 1961 to become president of
Rice University in Houston. Pitzer
came to Stanford at the end of 1968,
but resigned less than two years later.
The quiet chemist recalled the
problems he faced when he moved
from smaller, quieter Rice: "When 1
came to Stanford, it was perfectly
obvious that there were going to be
pressures in terms of student
radicalism and the demonstrations.
"But I'd hoped that the
national-international situations
tending to generate this would be
solved much faster than they were or
have been," Pitzer recalled.

With his usual short and choppy
laugh, Pitzer admits that the job of
handling sit-ins and trashing made the
Stanford presidency "less to my taste
and interests than I had hoped. I
suspect the challenge of dealing with
that kind of problem might have been
more attractive to some people than it
was to me."
Pitzer wonders whether the
Stanford disruptions of three and four
years ago may have overwhelmed any
president: "In very troubled times, it
may simply be impossible for any one
person to last through the whole
period."
But Pitzer adds that he had a
problem not faced by all presidents —
the continuing alumni reactions to his
outspoken comments against the
Vietnam War, the draft, and the
invasion of Cambodia.
"There's no question that the
alumni and other supporters upon

Rice's trustees "was quite outspoken
himself — usually on the same side of

the same issues. Whereas the pressure
was on the chairman, the president
sort of looked better by comparison.
His strong public position cer
tainly helpful."
Pitzer was also criticized by alumni
who felt he failed to deal firmly with
campus disruptions. They objected to
his reluctance to call in outside police
before internal mediation of sit-ins
failed.
Pitzer recalled, "1 think there are
many in the outside who just thought
that any sort of disruption should be
put down with great speed and
firmness. These people usually have no
particular idea of just how you are
going to accomplish this or what the
remaining consequences might be.
"But they are still very upset when
they continue to read in the
newspapers of disturbances at their
alma mater," Pitzer said. "There were
various reasons why it didn't seem
feasible to me to take any course very
much different than the one we
followed, even on hindsight."
Asked about his emphatic
endorsement of campus judicial
systems, Pitzer said, "Stanford
certainly must have a mechanism of
internal discipline and maintenance of
order that's more effective than it was
at that time. But the history of the
breakdown of previous internal
discipline systems meant that you
probably sort of had to work with the
one you had, nurse it along a bit and
try to improve it, rather than just
throw it out and try to start over again
another time."

confrontations he faced during his first
year as President.)
