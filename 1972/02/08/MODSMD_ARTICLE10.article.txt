## Trouble In The Kitchen 
###

The campus turmoil so
common to American universities
during the late 60's has finally
spread this past year to West
Podunk State. The trouble there
arose from a strange situation that
could establish a dangerous
precedent nationwide.
It seems that one of State's
Food Service chefs decided to
prepare some gourmet delicacies
not usually included in the
students' sparse repast. The
veteran cook, H. Mousse Pepsin,
whose specialty was seafood,
served Coquille Saint-Jacques one
evening.
Many of the students were
delighted, but the Food Service
Director, Rick 4> Chard" Piemon,
was a bit annoyed at the liberty
his chef was taking. Yet Piemon
said nothing, for he wanted to

maintain a free atmosphere in his
kitchen.
Sensing this as an opportune
moment to act, Pepsin next
prepared his masterpiece,shewered
whale, a product of years of
study.
Not content just to cook the
dish, Pepsin carried it out into the
dining commons and urged the
students to partake. When some
of States's 89,000 student body
grumbled, Pepsin shouted at
them, "Eat it!"
Outrage
Piemon thought this an
outrage, but did not decide to act
until the following day when
Pepsin's next indignity was
heaped upon the dinner table:
fortune cookies with quotations
from Julia Childs!
This was the last straw. Piemon
called the other chefs together in
a secret meeting and told them, "I
want to fire H. Mousse Pepsin. His
interpretation of the freedom to
cook is a threat to this
university!"
"But chief," said one cook,
"You can't just fire him like that;
he's been around for almost a
decade. That's a long time."
Ten-Yeared
That's right;" added another.
"He's a ten-yeared cook. He can't
be fired without serious cause."
At that moment, the phone
rang. Piemon answered, and
listened with a shocked
expression.
"Gentlemen," the director
began after putting down the
receiver, "I have just been
informed that H. Mousse Pepsin
incited the students to sit-in at the
Food Service Building this
morning to protest for better
quality meals. Some 300 students
took the building and had to be
ejected by State Police after two
hours."
"Good God!"
"Anarchy!"
"Was anyone injured, chief?"
Souffles
"No, but the demonstrators
threw cheese souffles at the
police. In any case, gentlemen,
here is our serious cause. I'm
banning Pepsin from the kitchen
indefinately and convening a

group of you senior chefs to
consider the evidence and
recommend whether Pepsin
should be fired or not."
Outside, the news spread faster
than grease on a hot griddle.
Student supporters were shocked.
Other students, opposing Pepsin,
had been busy organizing hunger
strikes. The leader of this
opposition told campus reporters,
"H. Mousse Pepsin nauseates me."
Pepsin left campus, returning
only to present testimony to the
Board of Chefs.
At the end of months of
deliberation, the Board finally
voted to expel Pepsin from West
Podunk State.
Landmark
Piemon, in a press conference
that afternoon, commented, "I
think this decision will stand as a
landmark in a difficult but
essential effort for higher
education: to distinguish between
the protected free expression of
recipies, no matter how repugnent
to how many people, and a
license, on tlie other hand, to
wield any spatula and exploit any
opening to attack and bring to a
halt the functioning of one of the
greatest strongholds of free
cookery in the world today, the
American university Food
Service."
In an exclusive interview with
State's campus newspaper,
Piemon was quoted as saying, "It
seems to me a little odd to shed
crocodile tears over the possible
impact of this decision on
Stanford University."
Yet while such rational
dialogue was going on inside,
Pepsin supporters had called a
rally to decide on what actions to
take.
Stomach
Speaker after speaker
addressed the crowd, but lit tie
progress was made in reaching a
decision. One young man rose and
told the crowd, "1 think Mousse's
ideas an 1 spreading! In your hearts
you know he's right. And the best
way to a man's heart is through
his stomach!"
But at last a catalyst appeared
on the scene: Pepsin himself,
disobeying the ban to speak to the

rally.
"You've got to liberate and
rehabilitate your stomachs;" his
voice rang loud and clear. "You
must learn to cook for
yourselves!"
The crowd, as a single throat,
shouted in response, "Eat on!"
Pepsin continued: "I'm going
to stay on campus and give
People's Cooking Seminars at
Gourmet Mouse!"
"Eat on!"
"But now . . . Now, we must
show the Food Service where we
stand. I propose we have a sit-in at
the Faculty Dining Club!"
Last Supper
The crowd marched quickly
over to the Club and took it by
surprise. Pepsin went to the small
kitchen to prepare his Last
Supper.
Later, gathered round the
Club's elegant tables, Pepsin and
supporters were toasting the
Movement when, suddenly, a
quiche lorraine in the oven
exploded. Everyone, thinking the
noise to be the start of a Police
attack, fled the building.
In the following days, rallies
were held, but support and even
interest in the case hegan to
dwindle. Organizers of the
Student Stomach Movement
(SSM) watched in dismay as
apathy and indifference swept the
campus.
Finally after another month,
the Movement quietly ended.
Students against Pepsin all along,
claimed, "The demonstrators
spent more time stuffing their
mouths than their brains. Now
they're behind in units."
Food Service Director Piemon,
calling the entire Movement, "just
in bad taste" theorized that
tensions among the group caused
its demise.
Hut the real reason for the end
of West Podunk State's Student
Stomach Movement was known
only to the Resident Head of the
Campus Health Service: all the
demonstrators were in the
infirmary' with ulcers and the
gout.
