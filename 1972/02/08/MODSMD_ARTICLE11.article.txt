## NLRB Compromise Good 
###

In a column in the Daily on
February 1, 1972, Bob Griffin
expressed his interpretation of
what the NLRB has done for
employees of Stanford in its
recent decision. Evidentally he
sees the NLRB decision as
somehow designed to undermine
organization at Stanford and as a
disservice to Stanford employees.
Though 1, too, do not agree with
the NLRB's decision, I cannot
agree with Mr. Griffin's opinions.
I am no expert on labor law and
matters relating to labor
organizations, but there are
certain facts with which I am
familiar and which I believe need
clarification.
What the NLRB decision does
is to establish three voting units
within which employees may
decide whether or not they wish
to be represented by any of the
labor organizations seeking to
represent them in such units. In
weighing these choices, each
employee should attempt to
analyze each issue and collect all
the information necessary for
making an intelligent resolution of
each. Unquestionably one such
issue is the desirability of the
representational units set up by
the NLRB. The NLRB, in making
its decision, chose a compromise
between the positions advanced
for narrow craft-type units and
the position for a broad,
all-inclusive bargaining unit of all
non-professional, non-supervisory
employees (excluding only guards
and employees of the Press
already covered by collective
bargaining contracts).
The Board's decision could
have fragmented employees into
many small units which could
have planted the seeds for later
disputes between employees of
each unit regarding who has
jurisdiction to perform different
jobs. On the other hand, the units
are certainly less inclusive than
what was sought by either the
University or by United Stanford
Employees. At the NLRB hearings
the University's attorneys made a
substantial effort both to present
evidence and to argue the
considerable community of
interest shared by all
non-professional employees at
Stanford. For Mr. Griffin to
contend that the University was
insincere in advancing this
position indicates a
misunderstanding on his part.
Appropriate Unit
Mr. Griffin's article also creates
the impression that the NLRB
ruled that clerical workers do not
have the right to become part of
an organized labor group. In fact,
the NLRB decision does not
prohibit clerical employees from
organizing. All it says is that the
CSEA-SEA petition, which
excluded the clerical employees,
constituted an appropriate
bargaining unit. Regardless of the
result of tin' forthcoming
elections, clerical employees do
have the right to organize into a
separate unit and be represented
by a labor organization if a
majority of them wish to be so
represented.
Mr. Griffin also asserts that
NLRB rules exclude Hospital
employees from others in the
Stanford community because "the
Hospital is not directly connected
with the University." The

Hospital is a separate corporate
entity from the University. There
is, however, no question that with
passing time the relationship
between the University and the
Hospital has become closer. It is
probably correct to say that this
relationship is closer now than it
was at the time of the hearing.
However, the principle reason
Hospital employees are necessarily
separate from University
employees for organizational
purposes under the National
Labor Relations Act was not
clearly stated in the NLRB
decision.
In 1947 Congress passed the
Taft-Hartley Act which amended
the original National Labor
Relations Act. One of the
amendments of the Taft-Hartley
Act concerned the jurisdiction of
the NLRB. Whether one likes it or
not, excluded from the
jurisdiction of the NLRB by these
amendments were nonprofit
hospitals. Stanford University
Hospital is a nonprofit hospital.
Surprise
I am surprised at Mr. Griffin's
contentions that University
officials brought charges against
Hospital employees concerning
their alleged participation in a
sit-in at the Hospital. The five
employees terminated as a result
of the sit-in were, in fact,
University employees. Mr. Griffin
would, I thought, have
remembered this inasmuch as he
testified at the grievance hearing
of one of them.
Mr. Griffin contends that
President Lyman, in his letter to
employees concerning the
upcoming elections, violated
Section 8(a) (1) of the National
Labor Relations Act and thereby
committed a misdemeanor
punishable by up to six months in
jail. Section 8(a) (1) of the
National Labor Relations Act
prohibits an employer from
interfering with, restraining, or
coercing employees in their
organizational activities. It is not a
criminal statute and carries no
criminal sanction regardless of
how seriously it is breached.
Moreover, anyone who reads
President Lyman's letter will see
that it carries no threat to
employees, either explicit or
implicit, if they selected
representation by unions. Rather,
the letter urges all employees to
consider the pros and cons of
unionization and urges them to
give serious consideration to the
decision they are making in the
elections, whichever way they
make it. Such statements to me
do not appear to be a violation of
Section 8(a) (1). However, if Mr.
Griffin or anyone else believes to
the contrary he has the option of
filing a charge with the National
Labor Relations Board.
Mr. Griffin describes the NLRB
as a government agency whsoe
five Board members are appointed
bv Nixon. The five members who
decide NLRB cases are, in fact,
appointed by the President with
approval of the Senate. The terms
of the Board members are
staggered so that no President can
stack the Board immediately upon
taking office. The Stanford case
was decided by a three-member
panel of the five-member board.
Of these three members, only one,

Ralph Kennedy, is a Nixon
appointee.
Mr. Griffin asserts that any
labor organization that wishes to
use the services of the NLRB must
affirm that "they are not
Communists nor supporters of
subversive movements." In fact
these requirements were repealed
in 1959 by the Landrum-Clriffin
Act and since 1959 there have
been no restrictions of this kind at
all.
Every one has a right to express
his or her opinion. Mr. Griffin
expressed his. We each have
different perceptions of the
world, the NLRB, the University,
and the pros and cons of labor
organizations. However, I hope
that everyone, no matter what his
or her persuasions, will make an
effort to pass on as factual
information only that which
indeed is accurate.
