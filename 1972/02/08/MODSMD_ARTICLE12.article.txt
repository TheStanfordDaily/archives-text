Editor, THE DAILY:
The recently reported
American Indian opposition to
the use of the name "Indian" for
Stanford's athletic teams is
unfortunate and misdirected. As
an American Indian (Navajo) and
a Stanford alumnus (Class of
1950), I strongly oppose the
change and urge that the proposal
be sidelined unless it can be
convincingly demonstrated that
all concerned—American Indians,
Stanford students, and the
alumni—are unanimous that the
use of the name is somehow
harmful.
The name change is reportedly
sponsored by a group of Stanford
American Indian students who
claim the use of the name for
Stanford's athletic teams is
demeaning to Indians, in that the
public image of Indians is
distorted grossly by this
identification with Stanford
teams. In my view, this notion is
erroneous and, in fact, I beleive
the public image of Indians is
significantly enhanced by the
association with Stanford athletes.
The Stanford teams I have
seen, whether winning or losing,
have displayed the same high
physical and character attributes
which we Indians would like to
see attributed to our tribes.
Among these are strength,

courage, endurance,
resourcefulness, team spirit,
fairness, humility, dignity, and
plain old zest for the game. The
public display of these admirable
characteristics by "Indians" can
surely do the real Indians no
harm. Indeed, we should continue
to be proud of the fact that our
Indian group has been selected to
exemplify such high character and
performance traits.
In my view, the Indian student
accusations illustrate an
accelerating tendency of erstwhile
Indian spokesmen to seek out and
expose imagined racial slurs in
traditional events, names, and
activities—in the observance of
Columbus Day and Thanksgiving,
for example. To be sure, our
society has elements of racial
injustice and it is well that these
are publicly recognized and
condemned. The Indian students,
therefore, should be encouraged to
speak out about significant
discriminatory practices which
may have eluded notice by older,
less sensitive persons. The
"Indian" team name, however, is
not such a racial slur.
In summary, the Stanford
community should take care not
to be misled by the hasty advice
of a small group of Indian
students who clearly do not
represent mature Indian opinion.

The name "Indians" for
Stanford's teams is harmless,
appropriate, and should be
retained.

P.S. For what it's worth, I also
regret the passing of the friendly,
bulb-nosed Indian decal from the
bookstore. What a pity it was
sacrificed to bolster the ego of a
few uptight "spokesmen"!
Editor, THE DAILY:
A union that has a rule against
the strike? This is what Mike
Fineo, of the California School
Employees Asst. — Stanford
Employees Asst. (CSEA-SEA),
admitted to in the Daily article of
the 2nd. The question is: What's
the purpose of even joining a
union if the union has a rule
against striking? Workers join
unions to assure solidarity in
bargaining. But a union with a
rule against striking throws away
the only tool the workers have at
their disposal. This however, is the
ridiculous attitude of the rulers of
CSEA-SEA.
A vote for CSEA-SEA is the
same as throwing your vote away.
A no vote would be better. Like
the Teamsters, who were only
interested in the small but
powerful physical plant, the

CSEA-SEA is only concerned with
the extension of its own personal
influence. Like the Teamsters, the
CSEA-SEA wanted no part of the
2200 clerical workers excluded by
the NIRB decision. Everyone
knows what a company union is
and most workers realize how
harmful it is to their interests to
belong to a company union.
There are other people, good
people, who have been working
long and hard for Stanford
Workers. My personal choice is
USE. But whatever comes down,
remember, CSEA-SEA is not the
workers union. Whether you do
white collar work or blue collar or
no collar at all, CSEA-SEA
supports other interests. In the
end their loyalties lie somewhere
else.

A union that has a rule against
the strike? This is what Mike
Fineo, of the California School
Employees Asst. — Stanford
Employees Asst. (CSEA-SEA),
admitted to in the Daily article of
the 2nd. The question is: What's
the purpose of even joining a
union if the union has a rule
against striking? Workers join
unions to assure solidarity in
bargaining. But a union with a
rule against striking throws away
the only tool the workers have at
their disposal. This however, is the
ridiculous attitude of the rulers of
CSEA-SEA.
A vote for CSEA-SEA is the
same as throwing your vote away.
A no vote would be better. Like
the Teamsters, who were only
interested in the small but
powerful physical plant, the

CSEA-SEA is only concerned with
the extension of its own personal
influence. Like the Teamsters, the
CSEA-SEA wanted no part of the
2200 clerical workers excluded by
the NIRB decision. Everyone
knows what a company union is
and most workers realize how
harmful it is to their interests to
belong to a company union.
There are other people, good
people, who have been working
long and hard for Stanford
Workers. My personal choice is
USE. But whatever comes down,
remember, CSEA-SEA is not the
workers union. Whether you do
white collar work or blue collar or
no collar at all, CSEA-SEA
supports other interests. In the
end their loyalties lie somewhere
else.

The recently reported
American Indian opposition to
the use of the name "Indian" for
Stanford's athletic teams is
unfortunate and misdirected. As
an American Indian (Navajo) and
a Stanford alumnus (Class of
1950), I strongly oppose the
change and urge that the proposal
be sidelined unless it can be
convincingly demonstrated that
all concerned—American Indians,
Stanford students, and the
alumni—are unanimous that the
use of the name is somehow
harmful.
The name change is reportedly
sponsored by a group of Stanford
American Indian students who
claim the use of the name for
Stanford's athletic teams is
demeaning to Indians, in that the
public image of Indians is
distorted grossly by this
identification with Stanford
teams. In my view, this notion is
erroneous and, in fact, I beleive
the public image of Indians is
significantly enhanced by the
association with Stanford athletes.
The Stanford teams I have
seen, whether winning or losing,
have displayed the same high
physical and character attributes
which we Indians would like to
see attributed to our tribes.
Among these are strength,

courage, endurance,
resourcefulness, team spirit,
fairness, humility, dignity, and
plain old zest for the game. The
public display of these admirable
characteristics by "Indians" can
surely do the real Indians no
harm. Indeed, we should continue
to be proud of the fact that our
Indian group has been selected to
exemplify such high character and
performance traits.
In my view, the Indian student
accusations illustrate an
accelerating tendency of erstwhile
Indian spokesmen to seek out and
expose imagined racial slurs in
traditional events, names, and
activities—in the observance of
Columbus Day and Thanksgiving,
for example. To be sure, our
society has elements of racial
injustice and it is well that these
are publicly recognized and
condemned. The Indian students,
therefore, should be encouraged to
speak out about significant
discriminatory practices which
may have eluded notice by older,
less sensitive persons. The
"Indian" team name, however, is
not such a racial slur.
In summary, the Stanford
