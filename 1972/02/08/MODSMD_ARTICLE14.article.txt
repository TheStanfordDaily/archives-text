# Graduates Fare Well In Job Market
## 
### 
Last June's Stanford graduates
fared well in the job market in
comparison with their peers on
other campuses, Dr. Ralph W.
Keller, director of the University's
Career Planning and Placement
Center notes in his annual report.
This was in spite of "one of the
most tight-fisted job markets
faced by college graduates in
many years," the placement
director said in a campus
interview.

"While actual registration for
permanent placement dropped
form 2555 in the year previous,"
Keller said, "to 2360 in 1970-71,
the total number of persons
placed in jobs increased by 70
persons—from 1153 to 1223."
The difference between the
number of applicants and the
number placed, he explained, can
be accounted for by those who
returned to school or who didn't
report their status.

The Stanford increase should
be placed in perspective against a
national report by the College
Placement Council, which said
that for both business and
industry and at all degree
levels—A.B., master's and
doctoral-"the volume of offers
continued the downhill trend for
the second straight year at the
bachelor's level and for the third
year in a row at the master's and
doctoral level."
''Positions vacant"
announcements received at the
service, excluding classroom
teaching openings, dropped about
1200 over the comparable
periods—from 5333 in 1969-70 to
4186 in 1970-71.
Also down was the number of
companies and government
agencies interviewing at Stanford,
Dr. Keller reported. The
comparable figures were 352
interviews for the year just closed
against 525 for the previous year.
"The only candidates for whom

the picture brightened," Dr.
Keller observed, "were the master
of business administration (MBA)
degrees. The volume of offers for
them increased one and a half
percent over the year previous.
"The relative success of
Stanford's graduates in a tight job
market," he continued, "is
believed to be due fundamentally
to their excellent qualifications
and to the high quality of the
University's academic programs.
"Research studies conducted
by the College Placement Council
(show that) qualifications of
Stanford's candidates generally
surpass those from most
universities."
