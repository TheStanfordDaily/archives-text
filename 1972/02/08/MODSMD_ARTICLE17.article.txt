"Paul Simon," Paul Simon,
Columbia, KC 30750.
Couple in the next room
Bound to win a prize
They've been going at it all night
long
Well, I'm trying to get some sleep
But these motel walls are
cheap. . . .
Yeah. It's Paul Simon. He's
back from Jamaica and Paris and
New York and San Francisco and
wherever else he's been hanging
out since Art Garfunkel broke it
off.
But is it the same Paul Simon?
Kid, you better look around
How long you think that you can
Run that body down?
How many nights you think you
can
Do what you been do in'
Who you foolin'?
Permanently Down?
Well, maybe it's not quite the
same one. The old Simon got
down on things once in a while.
You remember "Silent Night" and
"Sounds of Silence." But this one
sounds like he's permanently
down—like maybe the split with
Garfunkel wasn't the friendly,
happy deal it was cracked up to
be.
I got some so-called friends
They'll smile right to my face
But when my back is turned
They'd like to stick it to me
Yes they would
Oh no no oh no no
There's only one thing I need to
know
Whose side are you on
Yeah. Maybe it wasn't so happy
at all.
Sometimes even the music
makes you want to cry, even if
you blot out the words in your
mind. The wrenching guitar on
"Mother and Child Reunion," for
instance. It pierces you with
sadness, makes it well up inside
you until you want to let out a
mournful wail like the one coming
from Simon's throat.
Love is not a game
Love is not a toy
Ixyve's no romance
Love will do you in
And love will wash you out
And needless to say
You won 't stand a chance. . . .
Depressing Music
There isn't much doubt; this is
the blackest folk music anyone
has heard since "I Am A Rock."
Gloomy, Depressing. It
overwhelms you with misery;
misery of your own that surfaces
from the deepest part of
memories you thought you lost
long ago. Simon can do that to
you.
But that's not the only
difference in this Simon. He's still
singing something that's basically
folk music, but he seems to have
moved a few steps closer to rock
this time. No one song is a hard
and fast example of this new facet
of Simon; it's just that all of them
seem to be a few degrees father
towards the hard sound.
The voice isn't exactly the one
vou heard on "Bridge Over

Troubled Water,' either. This is
where you really miss Garfunkel
and wish that he would come
back from Hollywood and be a
musician again. Simon is at his
best on the cuts where his singing
voice is like it used to be; he is at
his worst on the one or two in
which he has tried—God alone
knows why—to adopt a raspy
moan that sounds like a cheap
Bob Dylan, like some pervert in a
phone booth mumbling an
obscene message.
Best and Worst
Compare, for instance, Me and
Julio Down by the Schoolyard," a
whimsical ballad of the poor - boy
- from - the - neighborhood -
makes - good - as - a - hood type,
with "Armistice Day." There just
isn't much comparison—the
former is the best on the album;
the latter is the worst.
It's carbon and monoxide
The ole Detroit perfume
And it hangs on the highways
In the morning
And it lays you down by noon
Still, it's a fine record. Simon
seems to be looking at things and
trying to warn everyone that
things aren't so good as they look;
he may be right. That's a
depressing thought, because things
don't even look so good. But if
you're going to be depressed, you
might as well do it with class.
There's only one thing I need to
know
Whose side are you on, whose side
are you on
There's only one thing I need to
know
Whose side, whose side, whose
side. . . .
Yours, Paul. Definitely yours.

Sunfighter, Paul Kantner and
Grace Slick, Grunt FTR-1002
This is not an especially bad
album. This is not an especially
good album. If we begin with this
basic assumption, everything else
will fall into place.
First off, it must be admitted
that this reviewer did not have
tremendously high expectations
for "Sunfighter" in light of Paul
Kantner's disastrous "Blows
Against the Empire" of 1970.
That album has much in common
with "Sunfighter," but what helps
to at least partially save this new
offering is the presence of Grace
Slick and her extraordinary voice.
A Performing Group
The main thing that must be
remembered about the Airplane

and its various spinoffs is that
they are not primarily a recording
group, but a performing group. To
hear Hot Tuna (the Jack
Casady-Jorma Kaukonen-Joey
Covington Airplane-in
microcosm) is to hear them live;
otherwise, something important is
lost.
Anyway, on "Sunfighter," we
have the whole Airplane showing
up for various cuts, along with
Papa John Creach, David Crosby,
Graham Nash, Jerry Garcia, Peter
(brother of Jorma) Kaukonen,
ex-Airplane drummer Spencer
Dryden, and the Edwin Hawkins
Singers.
Unfortunately, few of them
actually make their presence
known. For the first time Graham
Nash's angelic high harmonies are
completely drowned out, and
when Crosby and Kantner sing
together, Kantner manages to
completely drown out Crosby.
Musically, the best song on the
album is "Silver Spoon," which
opens the record. It is pure Slick
singing alone, undiluted by
Kantner.
On most other cuts, Kantner is
too much in evidence for his own
good. It is his writing, not his
singing, that is his major
contribution to the Airplane, and
for my money, the more silent he
is, the more palatable he is.
Other interesting cuts on the
album include "Diana," a song
about the terrorist Diana Oughton
who was killed in New York when
the bomb she was making
exploded; "China;" and "When I
was a Boy I Watched the Wolves."
But these are not really good
enough to justify buying the
album. In short, "Sunfighter" is a
mixed album, and it leaves this
critic decidedly undecided.
