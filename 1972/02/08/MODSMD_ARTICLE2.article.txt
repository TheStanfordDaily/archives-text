# Prosecution Presents Case In CJP Disruption Hearing
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
After two false starts, the Campus
Judicial Panel (CJP) prosecution of
four students accused of disrupting the
Placement Center last November 4
began in earnest yesterday.
Acting on a motion from
prosecutor John Schwartz, hearing
officer Lillian Altree struck from the
record all testimony taken during a
confusing session last Saturday.
Schwartz stated the purpose was to
allow the defense to cross-examine his
witnesses.
A session that was to have been
held Friday was abruptly canceled
because of a demonstration held
outside the hearing room.
The four defendants accused of
disrupting job interviews during the
November "mill-in" are Steve
Downey, Pete Knutson, Don Lee, and
Paul Loeb.
When Downey and Knutson failed
to show up for Saturday's session,
Altree declared that their case had
been severed, and would be held
separately from thai of Lee and Loeb.
Defendants Rejoined
Yesterday, however, all four
defendants asked to be allowed to
present their case collectively at the 8
a.m. hearing in Roscoe Maples
Pavilion. After a phone call to confer
with CJP chairman, John Kaplan,
Altree approved the move. As a result
the case will also be prosecuted as one,
although each individual's charge will
be judged separately.
Yesterday's hearing began with
Altree rejecting several defense
motions: to reschedule time and place
of the sessions, to open them to the
public, to rule on the validity of the
CJP itself and its jurisdiction in the
matter, and to disqualify herself.
Responding to the jurisdictional
question raised by defense counsel
Owen Blank and witness Yale
Braunstein, Altree replied that "I have
no authority to say that I am without
jurisdiction ... I consider the sole
issue to be whether or not the campus
policy on disruptions was violated."
No Disqualification
Counsel David Schlissel then moved

for a voir dire to determine if Altree
should remove herself from the case.
Altree claimed that the request was
"not appropriate," stating that the
defense had its chance to move for her
disqualification last Wednesday, before
hearings began, and did not.
Blank replied that new evidence
had turned up which indicated that
"you have had off-the-record
conversations with prosecution
witnesses" since Wednesday, and that
it would be clear to any mind "within
the circle of rationality" that the
defense "couldn't have known" this
would happen at the time.
She asserted in response to Blank's
charge that "I have discussed the
merits of the case with no one,"
admitting that she had discussed the
time and location with Schwartz
because "he was the one who would
know"the places available.
Earlier, defense counsel Walter
Hunkler had objected to the selection
of the Morrison Room of Maples for
the proceedings, terming it a
"fortress." Altree said she feared for
her personal safety given the security
available at an open, public hearing.
Altree was also questioned by
counsel Peter Goldscheider as to the
amount of money she was being paid
to conduct the hearing. "Are you
implying that I would be inclined to
delay the hearings in order to obtain
more money?" she countered.
"I don't know what you'd be
inclined to do," Goldscheider
retorted.
"This question is closed," Altree
shot back.
She then rejected Blank's motion to
disqualify her for prejudice, stating,
"In good conscience, 1 do not feel I
am biased."
Car Attacked
In a related incident, Altree's car
was the target of an attack by person
or persons unknown yesterday
morning while she was conducting the
hearings in the Maples conference
room.
The car, which was parked at the
south end of the Maples lot, was

vandalized sometime shortly before 1
p.m.
When Altree adjourned the hearings
at 1 p.m., she found one tire slashed
with an ice pick, and glue, not yet dry,
poured over the ignition.
"It was a substantial inconvenience,
and not something I would like to
have had done to my car," she said.
An obviously upset Kaplan told the
Daily last night that he was
"outraged" at the action.
"This is clearly an effort to
terrorize people," he said. "I don't
think this is the way a civilized
community behaves.
"If I'd known anything like this
would happen, I wouldn't have
appointed a woman," to hold the
hearings, he said.
Center Testimony
At the afternoon session, the
prosecution proceeded to present
basically the same case it had at
Saturday's hearings. Schwartz called
three witnesses: Duane Linsenbardt,
whose interview with a representative
of TRW Corp. was disrupted by the
mill-in; Placement Center director
Ralph Keller; and Stanford police

GOOD DAY SUNSHINE—The weatherman gave a preview of spring yesterday
with a blue sky and balmy temperatures. It was a day for throwing frisbees,
footballs, or if you happen to be in The Stanford Rehabilitation Movement,
acorns (see above photo). Another signal of spring is Lake Lagunita which is now
full, although probably still a little cold.
