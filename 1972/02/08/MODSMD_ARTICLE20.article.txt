Irish Rival Parliament Meets
BELFAST — Northern Ireland opposition leaders met in
their unofficial rival parliament yesterday night with the
prospect that they soon may find themselves in jail.
Police said they have taken out court summonses
against 26 leaders of Sunday's 20,000-strong
anti-internment march in Newry. The march, like all
processions in Northern Ireland, was illegal under the
government's Special Powers Act.
Bernadette Devlin, the 24-year old civil rights activist
and member of British Parliament, said she too had
received a summons. She supports Roman Catholic
aspirations toward a united Ireland.
Miss Devlin and a Roman Catholic civil rights group
promised a day of disruption Wednesday in Northern
Ireland with "sit-ins, sit-downs and all sorts of things."
But other leaders of the Catholic minority spoke out
against those plans Monday and called instead for a
24-hour fast.
Spending Bill Limit
WASHINGTON — Hailing it as "realistic and
enforceable," President Nixon signed legislation yesterday
to limit political-advertising expenses and seal campaign
finance-reporting loopholes.
The law goes into effect in 60 days, so it won't apply
to early presidential primaries but it will cover later
primaries, and will limit to $8.4 million the amount a
presidential candidate can spend for radio and television
advertising this fall.
Nixon signed the legislation — the most comprehensive
change of campaign practices law in a half century —
without the public ceremony which often accompanies
presidential approval of major measures.
In a three-paragraph statement, Nixon called the bill
"an important step forward in an area which has been of
great public concern."
He noted that the measure stiffens reporting
requirements for the source and use of campaign funds.
The new law repeals the loophole-ridden and
little-enforced Corrupt Practices Act of 1925. Asked
whether the administration would enforce the new

provisions, White House press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler
responded, "Yes."
ABA Approves Abortion
NEW ORLEANS — The House of Delegates of the
American Bar Association gave overwhelming approval
yesterday to the idea of uniform abortion laws for all
states but balked at recommending uniform "no-fault"
divorce laws.
The proposed divorce legislation, drawn up by the
National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform State
Laws, was rejected by the ABA 170-72 after heated
debate.
The proposed abortion legislation, which provides for
abortion on demand up to 20 weeks of pregnancy,
received only scattered opposition from members of the
ABA's opening session here.
Environmental Lottery Proposed
SACRAMENTO — Californians would come out on top
even if they lose in a $1 million lottery proposed
yesterday because proceeds would be used for
environmental protection.
Assemblyman Dixon Arnett said his plan is "the first I
know of in the country" of that type and would result in
about $200 million in first-year revenues.
