# Businesses Obligation
## Dean Miller Speaks 
### DAN BRENNER 
Arjay Miller, Dean of the Graduate
School of Business, told businessmen
that they have social as well as profit
obligations in an address given to a
White House conference on industry in
Washington, I).C.
The former Ford Motor Co.
president said yesterday that he
regards business's recognition of social
goals as a "minimum kind of effort,
and one we can't avoid if we are to

gear our operations to the needs of our
time.
"Without adequate profits there is
no way for business to undertake and
sustain efforts to meet pressing social
needs," he declared. "We must earn
social progress, in a very literal sense."
The speech was the keynote address
of a three-day conference which
discusses technology and business, the
human side of enterprise, the structure
of the enterprise system, and sotiiil
responsibility.
Then Miller criticized classical
liberal economist Milton Friedman for
saying that businessmen who support
soeial responsibility are, in Friedman's
words, "preaching pure and
unadulterated socialism."
He declared that it "is really too
bad" that economists like Friedman
are wrong. Business would "be so
much simpler if our only task and our
only responsibility were to make
profits for stockholders."
The dean suggested that business
develop "specific, measurable
objectives, including the time period
over which each goal will be met," in
order to meet the responsibility.
Among such objectives might be:
quotas for hiring members of minority
groups, including women, expressed as
a percentage of new hires and
projected perhaps five years in the
future; quotas for upgrading
minority-group persons to higher levels
of skill and responsibility, with
specific numbers targeted in more of
the higher salary grades; quotas for
purchase of goods and services from
minority-owned firms, using
year-to-year goals; and bringing
minority-owned firms into a
company's sales or distribution
network.
Miller also urged businessmen to
speak out more on current issues, to
participate actively in public
organizations in all kinds, at local,

NUTS TO YOU—These demonstrators, banned from the hearing room at yesterday's CJP hearing at Maples Pavilion,
fashioned a "cluster bomb" from acorns and hurled it towards the arena. Standing just out of the line of fire was
Stanford police photographer Nick Bruno, along with a Stanford officer. Bruno later testified at the hearing.
