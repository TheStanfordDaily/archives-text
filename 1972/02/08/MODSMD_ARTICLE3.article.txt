# Businesses Obligation
## Dean Miller Speaks 
### DAN BRENNER 
Arjay Miller, Dean of the Graduate
School of Business, told businessmen
that they have social as well as profit
obligations in an address given to a
White House conference on industry in
Washington, I).C.
The former Ford Motor Co.
president said yesterday that he
regards business's recognition of social
goals as a "minimum kind of effort,
and one we can't avoid if we are to

gear our operations to the needs of our
time.
"Without adequate profits there is
no way for business to undertake and
sustain efforts to meet pressing social
needs," he declared. "We must earn
social progress, in a very literal sense."
The speech was the keynote address
of a three-day conference which
discusses technology and business, the
human side of enterprise, the structure
of the enterprise system, and sotiiil
responsibility.
Then Miller criticized classical
liberal economist Milton Friedman for
saying that businessmen who support
soeial responsibility are, in Friedman's
words, "preaching pure and
unadulterated socialism."
He declared that it "is really too
bad" that economists like Friedman
are wrong. Business would "be so
much simpler if our only task and our
only responsibility were to make
profits for stockholders."
The dean suggested that business
develop "specific, measurable
objectives, including the time period
over which each goal will be met," in
order to meet the responsibility.
Among such objectives might be:
quotas for hiring members of minority
groups, including women, expressed as
a percentage of new hires and
projected perhaps five years in the
future; quotas for upgrading
minority-group persons to higher levels
of skill and responsibility, with
specific numbers targeted in more of
the higher salary grades; quotas for
purchase of goods and services from
minority-owned firms, using
year-to-year goals; and bringing
minority-owned firms into a
company's sales or distribution
network.
Miller also urged businessmen to
speak out more on current issues, to
participate actively in public
organizations in all kinds, at local,

state and national levels, and to remain
open minded about social programs
that may interfere with traditional
ways of doing business.
"We must not be satisfied simply to
react to pressures. How much more
can be done, at less cost and with less
pulling and hauling, if we make up our
minds to anticipate trends and
problems and then devise a strategy to
meet the situation," Miller said.
He also proposed a "National Goals
Institute" to be established by law.
The Institute would have as tasks: (1)
determining how much new money
would be available for spending on
broad social purposes; (2) projecting
the cost of established programs over a
10-year period; (3) projecting the cost
of attaining additional social goals over
a 10-year period; and (4) publish

annually a listing of all national goals,
together with estimated costs and
resources available to meet them.
Miller explained his rationale
behind such a proposal: "Business
must get into the planning process
early and bring its experience to bear
before programs are baked into law."
He also predicted that, as the
recognition of social responsibilities
increase, a greater government role in
business will result. He insisted that
business "make the most of the
situation by cooperating fully in
setting the new ground rules."
Miller's address, "The Social
Responsibility of Business," was the
keynote speech before the "White
House Conference on the Industrial
World Ahead: A Look at Business
1990."
