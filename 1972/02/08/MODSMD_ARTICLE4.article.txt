# Trustee Election Set For April
## 
### JON GRAY 
Some morning early this April, 88,000 ballots will
leave Bowman Alumni House and filter across the
country. They will ask Stanford alumni to select four new
trustees.
As recommended in 1969 by an ad hoc committee of
the Board of Trustees headed by John Gardner, four
alumni members were added to the Trustees in 1970, and
four more will be elected this Spring.
Bowman Alumni House yesterday released a slate of
eight candidates named by a 13-member nominating
committee for the election.
Four Positions Open
There are four posts to be filled â€” two for individuals
35 and under, and two for those 36 and over.
The candidates for the first group are Linda Hawes
Clever, Sallyanne Payton, C. Reid Rogers and Robert
James Woolsey.
For the second group, aged 36 and over, the candidates
are A. Crawford Cooley, Benjamin S. Crocker, Arthur A.
Milligan and H. Melvin Swift, Jr.
In the November 1971 issue of the Stanford Alumni
Almanac, the 13-member Trustee Elections Nominating
Committee was announced, headed by Lewis L. Fenton,
and alumni were asked to submit nominations.
From approximately 200 nominees, the slate of eight
was chosen.
This slate of eight is not final. Petitions for candidates
with more than 500 signatures will be accepted until
April, when the ballots, statements and biographies go
out. The petition candidates will receive the same amount
of publicity as the original eight.
Any alumnus of the University is eligible to vote in this

election provided he has attended three quarters at
Stanford exclusive of summer quarter, is not currently
enrolled at Stanford, and is not a member of the Alumni
Executive Board, Stanford Alumni Association Stcff,
Stanford faculty or staff.
Alumni have from the first week of April until May 31
to fill out and return ballots. During the first week of
June, the Field Research Corporation of San Francisco
will tabulate the ballots. Shortly after June 9th, the Board
notifies the four new trustees.
Alumni members are elected for four years and cannot
be re-elected. The majority of the Board of Trustees, on
the other hand, is appointed for 5-year terms. "But
customarily these terms are renewed," says Thomas M.
Newell, Director of the Alumnae Association.
The four alumni members elected in 1970 were Najeeb
E. Halaby, Ira DeVoyd Hall Jr., Denis A. Hayes, and Alan
Norman Weeden.
With the additional four this Spring, alumni members
will make up one-quarter of the board.
