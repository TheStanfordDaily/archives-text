## System Stacked 
### 
The farcical manner in which both the prosecution and the defense
treated the hearings held Friday and Saturday by the Campus Judicial
Panel was disappointing to say the least.
Although we object to the defendants'apparent efforts to confuse
and prolong the proceedings of the Panel, we feel that to a certain
extent it was to be expected that the defendants would not take the
hearings seriously. We based those expectations on the fact that the
procedures of the Panel, which are drawn up and interpreted by the
Administration, are so heavily stacked against them.
We had hoped that the Administration and prosecutor John
Schwartz would have taken judicial fairness and the constitutional
rights of the defendants more seriously than they apparently did in
actions taken over the weekend. We do commend them for
recognizing that they were wrong and for seeking to rectify their
mistakes.
Although hearing officer Lilliam Altree reversed herself yesterday,
the fact that she had decided that Pete Knutson and Steve Downey
had severed themselves from Don Lee and Paul Loeb by not appearing
at Saturday's hearing seems highly objectionable.
It appears certain that Altree knew that neither Knutson nor
Downey had been served with a summons for the hearing and that
they were therefore under no obligation to appear.
Perhaps the most odious aspect of the weekend's hearings was that
the defendants were tried in absentia on Saturday. Despite the fact
that Saturday's testimony was stricken from the record yesterday, the
trial in absentia violates the long-standing right of defendants to
confront their accusers.
Even though the Panel's procedures permit such hearings, legal
ethics demanded that Altree grant a continuance of the case until such
time as all the defendants could appear with sufficient advance notice.
Apparently Schwartz realized that his actions and those of Altree
were legally unsound and too hastily decided upon. It seems that he
recognized the error of rushing to hold the hearing Saturday without
guaranteeing that the case could be properly adjudicated. These are
likely to have been the motivating factors in his motion to strike
Saturday's testimony from the record.
We are now forced to ask what sort of a judicial system it is that
would allow such sweeping erryrs and misjudgments to be made in the
first place. It is clear that a new and far better system must be devised
as soon as possible.
