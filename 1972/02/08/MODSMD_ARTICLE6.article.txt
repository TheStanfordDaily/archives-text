## Lottery Loophole, Part 2 
### 
The article on this subject
printed recently in the Daily was
an attempt to give a background
for understanding the apparent
loophole for Extended Priority
Group (EPSG) Subgroup B in
avoiding induction. The effective
loophole was confirmed by
Secretary of Defense Laird in a
public statement Sunday night,
January 30. He stated that there
would be no draft calls for
February and March, as well as
January, and that April would be
the earliest that calls might be
resumed.
This announcement clarifies
the fact that men who entered the
EPSG, Subgroup B, on January 1,
1972 will not have their numbers
reached by the March 1972 call,
and will therefore enter the
Second Priority Group on April 1,
1972. In this group they are
virtually immune from induction,
short of a national emergency.
All men placed in the Second
Priority Selection Group will
subsequently be reclassified I-H.
This is a new holding classification
for men who are unlikely to be
inducted in the foreseeable future.
In I-H status a man is unable to
appeal for most classifications

(save for 4-F, I-D, or other, more
unlikely, classifications), and he is
required only to keep Selective
Service informed of a current
mailing address; his file is not in
any other way processed.
The San Francisco Chronicle
gave front page coverage to
Laird's announcementon Monday
morning, January 31. Two
paragraphs of that article seemed
ambiguous and misleading, and
we'd like to clarify them here.
The first paragraph broadly
implied that men in Extended
Priority 1972, born in 1951 or
before, would be immune from
induction. The fact is that this
immunity applies only to men in
EPSG Subgroup B, that is, men
who entered Extended Priority
for the first time in 1972. Men in
Subgroup A, who entered
Extended Priority for the first
time in 1971, remain liable for
processing if their numbers were
reached before April 1, 1971.
A later paragraph in the article
stated that lawyers and draft
counselors feel that men should
now drop their appeals if they are
in this EPSG Subgroup B. We find
no technical reason for this being
adviseable. If you wish to
continue your appeal, you may,
although you should receive a I-H
classification shortly after April 1
regardless of your on-going
appeal. There is little risk in
dropping an appeal since we
assume Laird's announcement to
be a firm assurance of policy, but
there is no reason why you have
to do so in order to take
advantage of the loophole. The
Regulations seem very clear on
order of call and placement in
priority selection group: a man's

likelihood of induction is based
only on whether his number is
reached in the EPSG. If his
number i<- not reached, because
there are no calls, then full
availability is not relevant.
In contacting local boards and
National Selective Service, we
have met with conflicting
interpretations of this EPSG
Subgroup B situation. National
Headquarters, though cautious
and informal, seems receptive to
our reading that a man need not
be fully available for the first
three months of the year in order
to be placed in Second Priority on
April 1. Local boards, on the
other hand, may vary in how they
process men in EPSG, Subgroup
B. Some boards have advised men
that they must remain fully
available, not on appeal and
presumably having passed a
preinduction physical, for the
entire 3 month period. Again, this
advice is clearly contrary to the
Regulations and is, in our opinion,
erroneous and misleading.
Some men have been
concerned about the date on their
new I-A's. As long as your request
to drop your 11-S was postmarked
before midnight December 31,
1971, you are presumed to be
classified I-A as of the last day of
1971, and thus effectively
exposed to the draft pool for the
entire year, regardless of when
your board finally classified you.
The I-A classification card itself
will not indicate the effective
date, but the words "effective
Dec. 31" should be entered in
your draft file.

1972. In this group they are
virtually immune from induction,
short of a national emergency.
All men placed in the Second
Priority Selection Group will
subsequently be reclassified I-H.
This is a new holding classification
for men who are unlikely to be
inducted in the foreseeable future.
In I-H status a man is unable to
appeal for most classifications

(save for 4-F, I-D, or other, more
unlikely, classifications), and he is
required only to keep Selective
Service informed of a current
mailing address; his file is not in
any other way processed.
The San Francisco Chronicle
gave front page coverage to
Laird's announcementon Monday
morning, January 31. Two
paragraphs of that article seemed
ambiguous and misleading, and
we'd like to clarify them here.
The first paragraph broadly
implied that men in Extended
Priority 1972, born in 1951 or
before, would be immune from
induction. The fact is that this
immunity applies only to men in
EPSG Subgroup B, that is, men
who entered Extended Priority
for the first time in 1972. Men in
Subgroup A, who entered
Extended Priority for the first
time in 1971, remain liable for
processing if their numbers were
reached before April 1, 1971.
A later paragraph in the article
stated that lawyers and draft
counselors feel that men should
now drop their appeals if they are
in this EPSG Subgroup B. We find
no technical reason for this being
adviseable. If you wish to
continue your appeal, you may,
although you should receive a I-H
classification shortly after April 1
regardless of your on-going
appeal. There is little risk in
dropping an appeal since we
assume Laird's announcement to
be a firm assurance of policy, but
there is no reason why you have
to do so in order to take
advantage of the loophole. The
Regulations seem very clear on
order of call and placement in
priority selection group: a man's

likelihood of induction is based
only on whether his number is
reached in the EPSG. If his
number i<- not reached, because
there are no calls, then full
availability is not relevant.
In contacting local boards and
National Selective Service, we
have met with conflicting
interpretations of this EPSG
Subgroup B situation. National
Headquarters, though cautious
and informal, seems receptive to
our reading that a man need not
be fully available for the first
three months of the year in order
to be placed in Second Priority on
April 1. Local boards, on the
other hand, may vary in how they
process men in EPSG, Subgroup
B. Some boards have advised men
that they must remain fully
available, not on appeal and
presumably having passed a
preinduction physical, for the
entire 3 month period. Again, this
advice is clearly contrary to the
Regulations and is, in our opinion,
erroneous and misleading.
Some men have been
concerned about the date on their
new I-A's. As long as your request
to drop your 11-S was postmarked
before midnight December 31,
1971, you are presumed to be
classified I-A as of the last day of
1971, and thus effectively
exposed to the draft pool for the
entire year, regardless of when
your board finally classified you.
The I-A classification card itself
will not indicate the effective
date, but the words "effective
Dec. 31" should be entered in
your draft file.

The article on this subject
printed recently in the Daily was
an attempt to give a background
for understanding the apparent
loophole for Extended Priority
Group (EPSG) Subgroup B in
avoiding induction. The effective
loophole was confirmed by
Secretary of Defense Laird in a
public statement Sunday night,
January 30. He stated that there
would be no draft calls for
February and March, as well as
January, and that April would be
the earliest that calls might be
resumed.
This announcement clarifies
the fact that men who entered the
EPSG, Subgroup B, on January 1,
1972 will not have their numbers
reached by the March 1972 call,
and will therefore enter the
Second Priority Group on April 1,
1972. In this group they are
virtually immune from induction,
short of a national emergency.
