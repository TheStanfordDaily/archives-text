## Divine Destiny Reaches Micronesia

Anyone who has read Bury My
Heart at Wounded Knee or seen
the movie "Little Big-Man" can't
help wondering how white
Americans could allow the
systematic destruction of the
Indian peoples and cultures. It
seems beyond reason and
understanding that our
forefathers, of whom we are so
proud, could coldbloodedly shoot
down innocent men, women, and
children because they were in the
way of our "Divine Destiny". And
certainly those most to blame
were the liberal scholars,
philosophers, and thinkers of the
day who should have recognized
the values of these cultures and
the responsibility of the
physically stronger force to
protect, not destroy, them.
Nevertheless, we find that these
men of high ideals and moral
rectitude were strangely silent and
ineffectual, or perhaps not even
interested in preventing the
outrageous fate of their red
brothers. Our history shames us.
Moreover, we lost a great deal of
wisdom in the process. Have we
learned from our past? This
currently popular feeling of
nostalgia would have us believe so
as we watch on the screen the
beauty of the harmony with
nature that these ancient cultures
had acheived.
But we have not learned.
History is repeating itself and we
are reacting in exactly the same
way that our greatgrandfathers
did. We are either so wrapped up
in our petty self-centered
squabbles that we ignore the fact
that we are once again in the
process of destroying cultures for

which we are directly responsible,
or we are actively taking part in
that destruction.
It took the blood of countless
thousands to awaken us to the
folly and moral wrongness of our
involvement in Vietnam. We
justified this involvement in the
name of freedom and for the
avowed purpose of stopping
Communism. Not even these
"excuses" exist in the case of
Micronesia, and although guns and
bullets may never be used on the
Micronesian, a slaughter is taking
place never the less.
Micronesia
I speak of the slaughter of the
cultures of Micronesia, an area as
relatively remote from the centers
of American civilization today as
was the Wild West in the days of
the Indian Massacres. And the
responsibility we feel towards
helping the Micronesians must be
roughly equivalent to that felt by
the scholars of the last century
towards the Indians. Of course we
are "helping" the Indian today, a
hundred years too late, but then
again he has long since ceased to
be a threat to our ambitions. Not
so the Micronesian. He sits on
land that the military considers
strategically essential—a strange
parallel, right? His cultures are
intact, strong, and growing
increasingly militant as he
understands better what it will
mean for him if he continues to
welcome the white man with open
arms.
The white man has, of course,
grown more subtle and there will
probably be no massacres, unless
economic or political homicide
can be considered a massacre. But,
in any case, for most of us here at
Stanford and the other great
institutions of learning in this
country, the new Indian War, be it
won or lost, will mean nothing.
The reason for this conflict is
relatively easy to understand in
light of the situation in Southeast
Asia and the far Pacific, and
Micronesia's location. Micronesia
straddles the Pacific Ocean
between Hawaii and the
Phillipines and consists of many
tiny scattered islands.
Administered
It has been administered by the
United States since the 2nd World
War as a Strategic Trust of the
United Nations—which means the
U.S. promised to prepare
Micronesia for self determination,
but reserved the right to use the
islands for whatever military

purposes it desired. Twenty-five
years later the Micronesians think
they are about ready for
self-determination, but the U.S.
will agree only if Micronesia
decides to become a part of the
U.S. To the American military,
there is simply no way to give up
the bases that are already existing
or planned, especially with
increased pressures to remove the
military presence from Okinawa,
the Phillipines, and other Asian
countries.
The military views Micronesia
as their fall back point if it
becomes necessary, and have done
a good deal of contingency
planning so that the islands can be
turned into B-52 bases, jungle
warfare training centers, and or
nuclear submarine bases. For
Micronesia the construction of
these bases would, as has so often

been the case, mean the
corruption or annihilation of the
adjacent cultures.
Palau
For example, the island district
of Palau has a population of
roughly 13,000 people living on
180 square miles of land area.
Approximately 6,000 people live
in the main town of Koror and
the remaining population is
scattered in 20 or so small villages.
The military has stated its
absolute minimum requirement
for this district as 40 acres of
classified storage space, a good
airfield, space for ship dockage
and the construction of submarine
pens, and use of the largest island
(152 sq. mi.) for the training of
troops in amphibious landings and
jungle warfare. The Palau
Legislature has passed a resolution
stating very clearly that they do

not want the military on their
islands.
But what does all this really
mean to a bunch of scholars at a
West Coast University? It is
interesting to note that at least
one professor here at Stanford is
working on military contingency
plans for the area, an all too
familiar story of the wrong people
interested for the wrong reasons.
But generally speaking, Micronesia
remains a forgotten colony out
beyond civilization. Perhaps, after
it has been "civilized" and the
natives placed in proper
reservations we will begin to feel
sorry for them and make nostalgic
movies about those rich and
beautiful, but alas, extinct
cultures.
