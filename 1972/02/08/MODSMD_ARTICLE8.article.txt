The Faculty Advisory Board which recently
recommended the dismissal of English Professor H.
Bruce Franklin obviously spent a great deal of time
and care in drafting its decision. It is a shame, then,
that after all its deliberation and deliberateness, the
Board reached the wrong result.
We do not say this lightly. We realize that the
Board has gone through weeks of hearings and
reams of testimony. No one else has been so
thoroughly imbued with such first-hand knowledge
of the case, and there is an obvious argument for
deference to the "triers of fact."
Nevertheless, a consideration of the opinion, the
evidence, the First Amendment issues and the state
of the campus has led us to conclude that Bruce
Franklin should not have been fired.
We agree at the outset that the Board stated the
proper constitutional incitement standard. But in
the application of that standard to the facts, and in
the fact-finding itself, it appears the Board
unconsciously allowed its prior perceptions of
Franklin to blur its thinking processes.
On all three charges on which Franklin was found
guilty, there is seriously conflicting evidence. At
White Plaza, the conflict is not over what he said,
but its meaning and context. Because his words did
not literally urge unlawful action, the required
factual interpretation necessarily comes down to a
question of witness credibility and which parcels of
evidence the Board chose to emphasize.
When such uncertainty exists, it is hard to see
how the evidence can meet the Board's own
standard of "strongly persuasive."
The same is true, only more so, for the Comp

Center and Old Union charges. The actions at the
Comp Center are so confused, and Franklin's speech
at the Old Union so ambiguous, that they are not
even close calls and it takes some stretching by the
Board to find Franklin guilty.
For example, the most the Board can say in its
Conclusion on the Old Union charge is that Franklin
"provided justification or violent behavior, and
that "while no detailed blueprint for action was
provided, the necessity for prompt action was a
strong message." This, we submit, does not bring
the speech beyond the line of constitutional
protection.
We do not think the Board set out to eliminate
Franklin. What we do feel is that the effects of
living in Franklin's presence took their
psychological toll on the Board. It is likely that very
few people on this campus could have been
objective in this case.
Finally, even if the Board's findings of fact are
right, Frankin should not have been dismissed. A
university is a sounding-board for ideas. Its vitality
consists in tolerating more, not less, diversity than
the society at large. (We wonder, indeed, whether
constitutional safeguards themselves may be too
restrictive when applied to a university.) Those who
break its rules should be punished, but, as Robert
McAfEßrown notes in his dissenting opinion, given
the university's commitment to the exchange of
ideas, even obnoxious ones, "if there is the slightest
possibiity that an individual, called to account for
speech that transgresses permissible boundaries, will
more clearly respect such boundaries in the future,
he deserves to be given that chance. A severe
penalty does not deny him that opportunity, but
dismissal does."
