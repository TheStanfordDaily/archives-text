# due process overload
## Postscript On Franklin 
###

Many issues have been
broached by the Bruce Franklin
decision not unimportant among
these have been freedom of
speech, University complicity in
the military-industrial
ball-and-chain, and the University
as an open center for rational
discourse. The Daily opinion
pages have been crammed with
commentary on these matters,
some of it penetrating, some of it
convincing, and most of it
presented in good faith. There is,
however, one issue which has not
been broached adequately in the
correspondence on this case, due
process of law.
1 am not a lawyer and admit to
having frequent lapses of
unintended indiscretion. My
perspective on due process of law
has probably been more
influenced by the simple and
elegant approach to the subject of
"To Kill A Mockingbird" or "The
Ox-Bow Incident" than Tlie
Federal Court Reporter, 2d Series.
Having made these caveats, I wish
to recall to the limelight an article,
submitted to the Daily by
Franklin, and published on
December 3, 1971.
Most of us hardly noticed it. It
appeared on Page 5, the farthest
back the opinions page has been
placed in the paper all year. The

issue was also the last of the
quarter.
Twenty-four professors in
Earth Sciences signed a letter to
the Advisory Board which read, in
part:
"Because we feel that Professor
Franklin has been instrumental in
curtailing the freedom of large
sections of the Stanford
community and because his
actions have resulted in major
physical and psychological harm
to the university, we hope that
the Advisory Board will look
beyond the details of specific
actions and consider the case of
Professor Franklin in a broader
context."
Ominous
There is something very
ominous in the phrase, . .look
beyond the details of specific
actions and consider the case of
Professor Franklin in a broader
context." While I have been
wrestling with the arguments for
and against Franklin's firing—not
overwhelmed with all that he has
uttered but mightily worried
about making sure he has the right
to say it—the above rationale by
members of the faculty leaves me
with a bitter aftertaste of the
whole proceeding.
Due process is, I think, what
the Constitution is all about. The

above argument, presented in the
near-anonymity of signatures en
masse, is the antithesis of due
process. The letter invites the
Advisory Board to toss out the
weeks of painstaking testimony
and argument by both the
University and Franklin, to toss
out the serious deliberations by
legal members of the community
on the questions involved—in
short, to dump due process and
expedite the decision
Their contribution to the
University debate on the matter
reminds me of thsoe
vengeance-seeking members of the
Ox-Bow mob who were willing to
mete out justice by impulse. It
takes little courage to decide a
man's guilt or innocence on the
basis of hearsay, personal tastes,
or general feelings about what
someone has done. It is easy,
often convenient, but not
respectable.
Ox-Bow
Ox-Bow was an instance of
presumptive justice. And, I fear,
those members of the community
who made up their minds on the
case by employing the sloppy
jurisprudence of the "Earth
Sciences 24" have done a
disservice to themselves and the
community of which they are a
part.
If any one factor separates the
Franklin case from that of
Edward Alsworth Ross, a
professor of sociology-economics
who was forced to resign from the
University in November, 1900 for
somewhat political reasons, it is
that there was no Advisory Board

when Mr. Ross fought for and lost
his academic career. It was in
1903 that it and the Faculty
Senate were established. Dr.
Franklin took advantage of his
statuatory right to a hearing. The
"Earth Sciences 24" seem to
believe that such due process was
altogether unnecessary.
I should emphasize, I have not
been able to glibly accept the
conclusions of the majority
report, perhaps because I worry
about the influence of thinking
represented by these 24
professors. The Franklin case
demanded that everyone judge the
man on the four specific charges
brought against him, not whether
in general we think he should be
fired or retained.
The "Earth Sciences 24" did
not. They suggested that the
Advisory Board "look beyond the
details of specific actions," an
articulate expression of
Ox-Bowism but cleansed of its
deserved murkiness. If the Board
ignored the type of thinking that
these professors suggest, then at
least the University community
can be assured that, rightly or
wrongly, those seven men who
patiently applied themselves to
their unpleasant but important
task acted in good faith.
But if Dr. Franklin was fired on
a recommendation tainted with
the arbitrarity that these men
urge, then the exhausting
proceeding was an intolerable
instance of Ox-Bow for which no
one can be proud.
