# Sit-ins Frustrated Pitzer's Efforts At Mediation
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT (Second of four parts) 
When Kenneth Pitzer came to
Stanford in December, 1968, radicals
held a "Greet Pitzer" week and
marched into his office. The marches,
sit-ins, and confrontations were still
going on when he resigned from the
presidency one and a half years later.
Pitzer handled his first Stanford
protest by inviting members of the
Students for a Democratic Society to
step outside and chat with him for an
hour. That move was typical of his
efforts, largely unsuccessful, to
mediate campus disputes without
using outside police.
"There's no question that some
people thougiit I was being unduly
patient or tolerant of further
discussion than I should have been,"
Pitzer recalled in a Daily interview
Friday at UC Berkeley, where he is
now a Chemistry professor.
But he insisted that "it didn't seem
feasible to me to take any course very
much different than the one we
followed."
Pitzer's theory of internal campus
controls faced its decisive challenge in
April, 1968, when hundreds of
protesters occupied the Applied
Electronics Laboratory (AEL) and
stayed for nine days.
A3M
The demonstrators in the April
Third Movement were protesting
classified and war-related research at
AEL and other campus labs, as well as
the Stanford Research Institute (then
owned by the University). The long
sit-in ended only after Pitzer promised
to close the lab for a week and
threatened immediate suspension of
those remaining.
Demonstrators rejected
administration requests that they
voluntarily give their names to faculty
monitors so that they could be tried
before the Stanford Judicial Council.
"I think there was a trend — and
maybe it moved faster and further
than I saw or I wanted to think was
the case — in which both students and
faculty were unduly reluctant to
discipline one another internally,"
Pitzer said.
Indefensible Tactics
Describing the long sit-in, he

commented, "I think it degenerated. I
don't think it was defensible at any
point. But the relative balance of
commendable motives as compared
with unfortunate or indefensible
tactics was certainly more favorable in
the first day or two than it was later
on."
Pitzer faced great pressures to bring
in outside police to end the sit-in, an
option never before used at Stanford.
"Our feeling was that we wanted to
make every effort to try to close it off
without sort of passing that boundary
point of bringing in the outside
police."

Pitzer Looks Back

Asked if using police at that point
seemed a major turning point, Pitzer
said, "Yeah. In hindsight I may have
made more of that than I should have.
I don't know. A month afterwards,
they were brought in for the Encina
sit-in, so you can't really judge."
Riot Police
In the early morning of May 1,
1969, riot police came on campus for
the first time to end a 6 Vi hour sit-in
at Encina Hall. The protest was more
militant and less widely-based than the
AEL sit-in.
Pitzer said police were called
because "at that stage there had ceased
to be any threat of justification in
terms of drawing attention to issues or
getting a hearing on issues. It was that
very afternoon that there had been a
trustees' committee on campus hearing
arguments with respect to the alleged
issues.
"It seemed to me there was very
little hope that by any further delay
one could bring the thing to a close
any better than doing it right away."
At the time of the Encina bust,
there were rumors that then-Provost
Richard Lyman had made the decision
without consulting Pitzer. But the
former president said he returned from
a speaking engagement in Los Angeles
and "immediately when I got home I
was on the phone with Provost
Lyman.
We Agreed
"In the course of a five-minute
conversation, he outlined the variouf

steps that had been taken up to that
point, and the fact that he didn't see
anything else that could be done. I
didn't either. I think we were quite
agreed on it. I told him to go right
ahead and pass the word to the
Sheriff."
Activists had demanded that the
University control Stanford Research
Institute more closely, limiting its
extensive war-related research. By the
time of the Encina protest, it was clear
that the trustees instead were going to
sever SRI from the University.
Pitzer commented last week that
the protesters should have accepted
their defeat rather than mounting
another sit-in because "those issues
had been heard, argued, and so on."
He said, "there was no longer any
reasonable basis of wanting to be
heard on issues that could be dealt
with within the Stanford community."
"The local organization just has to
fight back and defend itself without
any particular compunctions further,"
Pitzer said, when radicals "push
against their local entity with the
argument that the war ought to be
stopped, or something else the local
people have no power to do."
Classified Research
Although the April Third
Movement lost its battle for control of
SRI, the faculty approved demands to
end classified research on campus.
Pitzer noted, "Most faculties at most
universities had said 'no' to classified
research, except for very peripheral
and marginal aspects, within a few

years of World War Two.
"Stanford was rather exceptional in
the relatively massive amount of
classified research it had going on in
the mid-1960'5."
Throughout the radical protests,
Pitzer expressed his own opposition to
the Vietnam War. When trustees first

considered the SRI issue, he called it a
chance for them to make clear that the
War was an "Edsel" and a "blunder."
He said he spoke to the trustees
about the war because "I wanted them
to understand to some greater degree
than I thought they did the intensity
of feeling of a substantial component

of the campus."
Pilzer said he still believes the war
is a mistake rather than an inevitable
result of the American system. "I still
have more faith in the general system
than the radical outlook."

Pitzer's second year at Stanford.)
