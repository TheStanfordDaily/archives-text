# What Can I Say, I Survive

New York, January
26—Yesterday, gale force winds
hit New York. The temperature
dropped thirty degrees in twelve
hours, and gusts swept debris and
construction materials from
young, growing skyscrapers,
breaking windows and strewing
midtown Manhattan with glass.
West 34th Street and Times
Square were closed to traffic and
pedestrians. On the East Side, a
wall collapsed, crushing three Con
Edison workers; one man died.
I can't think of a better
metaphore for this city than that
windstorm. New York is a
cyclone, a tornado, a hurricane. I
can understand why many visitors
and new residents feel
intimidated; 1 grew up in this
town, and even I am scared to
death half the time.
New Yorkers love to tell you
how dangerous a place the city
has become. The crime rate here is
truly stupendous; in some
categories it is even worse than
San Francisco. If you believe
everything you hear, the half-life
for an unarmed pedestrian under
six feet five inches is about three
minutes; if you own a german
shepherd and feed him only on
blood, the half-life increases to
four minutes, but you can be
arrested for cruelty to animals if
you try to walk him after sunset.
The New York Times ran an
amusing article on the front page
this week. It was a map of
Manhattan, taken from a French
newspaper, showing the dangerous
areas of the city as a warning to
potential tourists. Everything
north of 96th Street was marked
in black, indicating that the area
was considered dangerous both by
day and night. Since my parents
live on 199 th Street, and I grew
up on 200 th Street, and my new
apartment is on 125 th Street, this
was somewhat disconcerting.
I assume that we will not be
seeing too many Frenchmen this
summer.
New Yorkers love this image of
themselves. Everyone has a
mugging story, but when you get
down to cases it was always
someone else who was mugged. I
am the only person I know who is
actually a mugging victim, and
that was an unsuccessful 1964

attempt to steal my watch; I
frightened my assailant off by
threatening him with my
umbrella.
I am not trying to minimize the
dangers of walking alone at night
in New York City; I am just trying
to put the horror stories in
perspective. New York is at least
as dangerous as St. Louis or
Baltimore or Washington. So far, I
have been here for ten days, and
I'm still alive, Praise the Lord.
If New York is dangerous, the
danger is not apparant to the
casual observor; the dirt and the
expense are. I was ready for the

dirt—some things are eternal; the
expense hit me like a silver brick.
I was incredibly lucky last week
to find a 2'/2-room apartment for
only $232/ month. The reason I
got by so cheap is that the
building is subsidized by a
university, and is, in essence, a
faculty housing.
A meal in a reasonably good
New York restaurant runs to
about $8 a person; a meal in a
luxury restaurant is considerably
higher than a comparable feast at
Ernie's in San Francisco. A dinner
at La Caravelle, New York's finest
restaurant, runs about $14.00, not
including liquor, wines, or tips. A
la carte entrees at "21" (assuming
one can get in) are about $25.
This is expensive.
The sales tax is seven percent.
There is a city income tax.
If you can negotiate the crime,
the grime, the litter, the
mind-boggling cost of living, the
homicidal drivers, the dog
droppings, the cockroaches, the
rude waitresses, the strikes, the
erratic weather, the larcenous
auto mechanics and malicious
vandals, then New York has

something special for the survivor,
a vibrancy that makes any other
place I have been seem tranquil.
New York is an ethnic city,
populated almost entirely by
people who would be considered
not "really American" most other
places. Mon> than 50 percent of
the population is Negro, Puerto
Rican, or Jewish; and about 20
percent is Irish or Italian; only
five percent is good, standard,
old-stock American WASP. New
York is a city of "minorities," and
one of the smallest minorities is
that group which constitutes the
vast majority of the population of

the country as a whole.
New York is a city with a
compassion for the disadvantaged
and defeated. New York has the
largest budget of any
governmental unit in the country,
save that of the Federal
government itself, larger than the
budget of either New York State
or California. One-third of this
budget goes to welfare.
New York has a city university
that offers free tuition to any
graduate of a city high school,
with the sixth largest enrollment
of any school in the country, one
of the highest, if not the highest,
faculty pay scales in the country,
and a reputation for academic
excellence that is equal to that of
any other public institution in the
country.
New York City is the abortion
capital of the country, offering,
under a New York State law, legal
abortions upon request with no
residency requirement. The law is
a state law, but you can be sure
the initiative didn't come from
Schenectady.
New York is a gourmet's
paradise. You couldget fat walking

down the street. Each of New
York's "minorities" has
contributed a line of succulent
dishes that has been integrated
into a cosmopolitan stew that
cannot be duplicated elsewhere.
Supermarkets in Harlem carry
matzos and bagels; Chinese
restaurants abound in Spanish
neighborhoods; Puerto Ricans and
blacks sell kosher frankfurters in
Times Square and kosher pizza on
the Lower East Side. Only the
Irish haven't made a solid
gastronomic contribution but
they have cornered the liquor

market; you could stay pleasantly
crocked forever in Irish bars,
which are as abundant as lakes in
Killarny.
There is a provincialism in New
York, a feeling that no place else
is worth complaining about. The
delusion that their town is the
center of the world is certainly
not the exclusive property of New
Yorkers; but here it is special,
because more than any place else
in the United States, there is a
certain truth to it.
New York is not the beginning
and the end of the world, but it is
a vital generator of political and
social energy; one never gets the
feeling that this is a backwater.
I have travelled to distant
shores ("Yea, I have seen the land
across the Hudson, and it is a
good land, a land flowing with
milk and honey, taco stands and
freeways. . . ."), and yet, when I
am in New York I have the feeling
that, with all the dirt and the
hassle, this is where it is
happening, and life someplace
else, as congenial or exciting as it
may be, is sometimes just a bit
second-hand.

higher than a comparable feast at
Ernie's in San Francisco. A dinner
at La Caravelle, New York's finest
restaurant, runs about $14.00, not
including liquor, wines, or tips. A
la carte entrees at "21" (assuming
one can get in) are about $25.
This is expensive.
The sales tax is seven percent.
There is a city income tax.
If you can negotiate the crime,
the grime, the litter, the
mind-boggling cost of living, the
homicidal drivers, the dog
droppings, the cockroaches, the
rude waitresses, the strikes, the
erratic weather, the larcenous
auto mechanics and malicious
vandals, then New York has

something special for the survivor,
a vibrancy that makes any other
place I have been seem tranquil.
New York is an ethnic city,
populated almost entirely by
people who would be considered
not "really American" most other
places. Mon> than 50 percent of
the population is Negro, Puerto
Rican, or Jewish; and about 20
percent is Irish or Italian; only
five percent is good, standard,
old-stock American WASP. New
York is a city of "minorities," and
one of the smallest minorities is
that group which constitutes the
vast majority of the population of

the country as a whole.
New York is a city with a
compassion for the disadvantaged
and defeated. New York has the
largest budget of any
governmental unit in the country,
save that of the Federal
government itself, larger than the
budget of either New York State
or California. One-third of this
budget goes to welfare.
New York has a city university
that offers free tuition to any
graduate of a city high school,
with the sixth largest enrollment
of any school in the country, one
of the highest, if not the highest,
faculty pay scales in the country,
and a reputation for academic
excellence that is equal to that of
any other public institution in the
country.
New York City is the abortion
capital of the country, offering,
under a New York State law, legal
abortions upon request with no
residency requirement. The law is
a state law, but you can be sure
the initiative didn't come from
Schenectady.
New York is a gourmet's
paradise. You couldget fat walking

down the street. Each of New
York's "minorities" has
contributed a line of succulent
dishes that has been integrated
into a cosmopolitan stew that
cannot be duplicated elsewhere.
Supermarkets in Harlem carry
matzos and bagels; Chinese
restaurants abound in Spanish
neighborhoods; Puerto Ricans and
blacks sell kosher frankfurters in
Times Square and kosher pizza on
the Lower East Side. Only the
Irish haven't made a solid
gastronomic contribution but
they have cornered the liquor

market; you could stay pleasantly
crocked forever in Irish bars,
which are as abundant as lakes in
Killarny.
There is a provincialism in New
York, a feeling that no place else
is worth complaining about. The
delusion that their town is the
center of the world is certainly
not the exclusive property of New
Yorkers; but here it is special,
because more than any place else
in the United States, there is a
certain truth to it.
New York is not the beginning
and the end of the world, but it is
a vital generator of political and
social energy; one never gets the
feeling that this is a backwater.
I have travelled to distant
shores ("Yea, I have seen the land
across the Hudson, and it is a
good land, a land flowing with
milk and honey, taco stands and
freeways. . . ."), and yet, when I
am in New York I have the feeling
that, with all the dirt and the
hassle, this is where it is
happening, and life someplace
else, as congenial or exciting as it
may be, is sometimes just a bit
second-hand.

New York, January
26—Yesterday, gale force winds
hit New York. The temperature
dropped thirty degrees in twelve
hours, and gusts swept debris and
construction materials from
young, growing skyscrapers,
breaking windows and strewing
midtown Manhattan with glass.
West 34th Street and Times
Square were closed to traffic and
pedestrians. On the East Side, a
wall collapsed, crushing three Con
Edison workers; one man died.
I can't think of a better
metaphore for this city than that
windstorm. New York is a
cyclone, a tornado, a hurricane. I
can understand why many visitors
and new residents feel
intimidated; 1 grew up in this
town, and even I am scared to
death half the time.
New Yorkers love to tell you
how dangerous a place the city
has become. The crime rate here is
truly stupendous; in some
categories it is even worse than
San Francisco. If you believe
everything you hear, the half-life
for an unarmed pedestrian under
six feet five inches is about three
minutes; if you own a german
shepherd and feed him only on
blood, the half-life increases to
four minutes, but you can be
arrested for cruelty to animals if
you try to walk him after sunset.
The New York Times ran an
amusing article on the front page
this week. It was a map of
Manhattan, taken from a French
newspaper, showing the dangerous
areas of the city as a warning to
potential tourists. Everything
north of 96th Street was marked
in black, indicating that the area
was considered dangerous both by
day and night. Since my parents
live on 199 th Street, and I grew
up on 200 th Street, and my new
apartment is on 125 th Street, this
was somewhat disconcerting.
I assume that we will not be
seeing too many Frenchmen this
summer.
New Yorkers love this image of
themselves. Everyone has a
mugging story, but when you get
down to cases it was always
someone else who was mugged. I
am the only person I know who is
actually a mugging victim, and
that was an unsuccessful 1964

attempt to steal my watch; I
frightened my assailant off by
threatening him with my
umbrella.
I am not trying to minimize the
dangers of walking alone at night
in New York City; I am just trying
to put the horror stories in
perspective. New York is at least
as dangerous as St. Louis or
Baltimore or Washington. So far, I
have been here for ten days, and
I'm still alive, Praise the Lord.
If New York is dangerous, the
danger is not apparant to the
casual observor; the dirt and the
expense are. I was ready for the

dirt—some things are eternal; the
expense hit me like a silver brick.
I was incredibly lucky last week
to find a 2'/2-room apartment for
only $232/ month. The reason I
got by so cheap is that the
building is subsidized by a
university, and is, in essence, a
faculty housing.

in the United States, there is a
certain truth to it.
New York is not the beginning
and the end of the world, but it is
a vital generator of political and
social energy; one never gets the
feeling that this is a backwater.
I have travelled to distant
shores ("Yea, I have seen the land
across the Hudson, and it is a
good land, a land flowing with
milk and honey, taco stands and
freeways. . . ."), and yet, when I
am in New York I have the feeling
that, with all the dirt and the
hassle, this is where it is
happening, and life someplace
else, as congenial or exciting as it
may be, is sometimes just a bit
second-hand.

New York, January
26—Yesterday, gale force winds
hit New York. The temperature
dropped thirty degrees in twelve
hours, and gusts swept debris and
construction materials from
young, growing skyscrapers,
breaking windows and strewing
midtown Manhattan with glass.
West 34th Street and Times
Square were closed to traffic and
pedestrians. On the East Side, a
wall collapsed, crushing three Con
Edison workers; one man died.
I can't think of a better
metaphore for this city than that
windstorm. New York is a
cyclone, a tornado, a hurricane. I
can understand why many visitors
and new residents feel
intimidated; 1 grew up in this
town, and even I am scared to
death half the time.
New Yorkers love to tell you
how dangerous a place the city
has become. The crime rate here is
truly stupendous; in some
categories it is even worse than
San Francisco. If you believe
everything you hear, the half-life
for an unarmed pedestrian under
six feet five inches is about three
minutes; if you own a german
shepherd and feed him only on
blood, the half-life increases to
four minutes, but you can be
arrested for cruelty to animals if
you try to walk him after sunset.
The New York Times ran an
amusing article on the front page
this week. It was a map of
Manhattan, taken from a French
newspaper, showing the dangerous
areas of the city as a warning to
potential tourists. Everything
north of 96th Street was marked
in black, indicating that the area
was considered dangerous both by
day and night. Since my parents
live on 199 th Street, and I grew
up on 200 th Street, and my new
apartment is on 125 th Street, this
was somewhat disconcerting.
I assume that we will not be
seeing too many Frenchmen this
summer.
New Yorkers love this image of
themselves. Everyone has a
mugging story, but when you get
down to cases it was always
someone else who was mugged. I
am the only person I know who is
actually a mugging victim, and
that was an unsuccessful 1964

attempt to steal my watch; I
frightened my assailant off by
threatening him with my
umbrella.
I am not trying to minimize the
dangers of walking alone at night
in New York City; I am just trying
to put the horror stories in
perspective. New York is at least
as dangerous as St. Louis or
Baltimore or Washington. So far, I
have been here for ten days, and
I'm still alive, Praise the Lord.
If New York is dangerous, the
danger is not apparant to the
casual observor; the dirt and the
expense are. I was ready for the

dirt—some things are eternal; the
expense hit me like a silver brick.
I was incredibly lucky last week
to find a 2'/2-room apartment for
only $232/ month. The reason I
got by so cheap is that the
building is subsidized by a
university, and is, in essence, a
faculty housing.
A meal in a reasonably good
New York restaurant runs to
about $8 a person; a meal in a
luxury restaurant is considerably
higher than a comparable feast at
Ernie's in San Francisco. A dinner
at La Caravelle, New York's finest
restaurant, runs about $14.00, not
including liquor, wines, or tips. A
la carte entrees at "21" (assuming
one can get in) are about $25.
This is expensive.
The sales tax is seven percent.
There is a city income tax.
If you can negotiate the crime,
the grime, the litter, the
mind-boggling cost of living, the
homicidal drivers, the dog
droppings, the cockroaches, the
rude waitresses, the strikes, the
erratic weather, the larcenous
auto mechanics and malicious
vandals, then New York has

something special for the survivor,
a vibrancy that makes any other
place I have been seem tranquil.
New York is an ethnic city,
populated almost entirely by
people who would be considered
not "really American" most other
places. Mon> than 50 percent of
the population is Negro, Puerto
Rican, or Jewish; and about 20
percent is Irish or Italian; only
five percent is good, standard,
old-stock American WASP. New
York is a city of "minorities," and
one of the smallest minorities is
that group which constitutes the
vast majority of the population of

the country as a whole.
New York is a city with a
compassion for the disadvantaged
and defeated. New York has the
largest budget of any
governmental unit in the country,
save that of the Federal
government itself, larger than the
budget of either New York State
or California. One-third of this
budget goes to welfare.
New York has a city university
that offers free tuition to any
graduate of a city high school,
with the sixth largest enrollment
of any school in the country, one
of the highest, if not the highest,
faculty pay scales in the country,
and a reputation for academic
excellence that is equal to that of
any other public institution in the
country.
New York City is the abortion
capital of the country, offering,
under a New York State law, legal
abortions upon request with no
residency requirement. The law is
a state law, but you can be sure
the initiative didn't come from
Schenectady.
New York is a gourmet's
paradise. You couldget fat walking

down the street. Each of New
York's "minorities" has
contributed a line of succulent
dishes that has been integrated
into a cosmopolitan stew that
cannot be duplicated elsewhere.
Supermarkets in Harlem carry
matzos and bagels; Chinese
restaurants abound in Spanish
neighborhoods; Puerto Ricans and
blacks sell kosher frankfurters in
Times Square and kosher pizza on
the Lower East Side. Only the
Irish haven't made a solid
gastronomic contribution but
they have cornered the liquor

market; you could stay pleasantly
crocked forever in Irish bars,
which are as abundant as lakes in
Killarny.
There is a provincialism in New
York, a feeling that no place else
is worth complaining about. The
delusion that their town is the
center of the world is certainly
not the exclusive property of New
Yorkers; but here it is special,
because more than any place else
in the United States, there is a
certain truth to it.
