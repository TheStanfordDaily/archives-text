## Blow To Free Trade Of Ideas 
### 
Last Wednesday a faculty tribunal at Stanford issued a decision that
could have widespread ramifications across the country. The tribunal,
by a five-to-two decision, recommended the immediate dismissal of a
professor for allegedly inciting campus disruptions a year ago.
The tenure system has traditionally been considered a strong
safeguard against persecution for political beliefs. Yet the board's
recommendation of the dismissal of H. Bruce Franklin, an outspoken
associate professor of English, demonstrates that tenure offers no
automatic immunity to those instructors who challenge outright the
legitimacy of educational institutions.
The Stanford administration had charged Professor Franklin, a
radical Maoist, with disrupting a speech by Henry Cabot Lodge in
January 1971, and with urging violent demonstrations the following
month in protest against the South Vietnamese military action in
Laos. The faculty judges agreed that Professor Franklin had not
participated in the disruption of Ambassador Lodge's lecture, but
ruled that the English professor had in a later address incited the
occupation of the campus computer center, and encouraged resistance
to an order by police to disperse.
However, the decision of the panel, which is expected to be ratified

by Stanford President Richard Lyman, was apparently not based on
any specific acts or statements by Professor Franklin, but on the
general tone of his speeches at nighttime rallies. Three reporters from
the Stanford Daily who were present at these speeches stated that
Professor Franklin never advocated violence, and the paper, in an
editorial, called the faculty decision "outrageous," asserting that there
was not enough evidence to convict Professor Franklin.
The majority opinion of the tribunal also refrains from pinpointing
any specific instances of incitement to violence. Instead, the judges
urged Mr. Franklin's dismissal on the grounds that the professor
"engages in a pattern of conduct that constitutes a continual challenge
to the institution ... he must have known that the circumstances
under which he spoke involved a high risk of subsequent violence. . . .
His speeches sought to generate hostility."
This reasoning runs counter the law regarding public speech that
has been formulated in various decisions by the Supreme Court. It is
not unlawful for a speaker to advocate an idea, no matter how much
violence may be needed to carry out the idea in practice. Speech only
becomes criminal when it urges an audience to perform immediate
and illegal actions. One can advocate the overthrow of the United
States government, but it is unlawful to urge a crowd to pick up a gun
and shoot a policeman standing on the opposite corner.
If, as seems likely, Professor Franklin has been dismissed for being a
"challenge to the institution," and for giving speeches that "generate
hostility," the Stanford Daily is correct in stating that the tribunal's
decision defined free speech too narrowly and placed stricter limits on
free speech on the campus than exist in the general community. But
the threat to dissent and free speech is not limited to Stanford. It is
likely that university administrations across the country will look to
the Stanford decision as a precedent in dealing with rebellious
instructors on their own campuses.
The dismissal of H. Bruce Franklin from Stanford is a serious blow
to the continued free trade of ideas necessary to a university, no
matter how radical, critical, or severe those ideas may be. The decision
of the faculty panel, to quote from the opinion of the board's two
dissenting members, involves ' substantial costs ... in the form of
corrosive effects on academic freedom, and . . .in terms of lost
challenge in the subtle inhibition of dissent."
