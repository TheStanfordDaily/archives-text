# Everything You've Always Wanted To Know About Opera
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALI 
(Eds Note: With the Spring Opera
Theater opening this weekend in
San Francisco, Daily opera
reviewer Gary Sch midgut I felt it
was a good time to expouse his
own operatic theory.)

(First in a two-part series)
Last quarter in his column "On
the Brink" Steve Ungar issued an
amiable , discursive blast at opera
which, in effect, characterized this
form of entertainment as the
duck-billed platypus of art-forms.
As the Daily's resident
opera-monger, I felt obliged to sift
through the rubble for salvagable
pieces of opera which Steve's
scorched-earth humor left in its
wake. This, then, is my
counterblast.
The thesis of Steve's column
was that "opera is too much fun
to be dismissed completely." Well,
he had his fun at opera's expense
and, rather self-servingly I
thought, then dismissed it
completely. In the course of his
article most of the typical reasons
people invent for not liking opera
were catalogued, together with a
number of myths which I thought
had long since been put to sleep:
opera is Dead, opera is
Anti-dramatic, opera is sung in a
Foreign Language by Foreigners,
opera-singers are Fat, opera is an
excuse for Social Ritual. The
usual stuff.
The only thing I missed, mainly
because it would have fit Steve's
theme so well, was Ambrose
Bierce's typically nasty-minded
definition of opera.
A play representing life in
another world, whose
inhabitants have no speech but
song, no motions but gestures
and no postures but attitudes.
All acting is simulation, and
the word simulation is from
simia, an ape; but in opera the
actor takes for his model Simia
audibilis (or I'ithecanthropos
stentor)— the ape that howls.
Helped by some nefarious
etymology, Bierce takes opera at
its worst, and Steve has done
rather the same thing by
studiously ignoring the
felicities—the saving graces—of
opera. One would assume from his
column that only cretins and
otherwise aesthetically retarded
souls make up an opera audience.
Before looking at the positive
aspects of opera, however, I think
it is necessary to consider each of
the traditional counts in the
indictment against opera.
Opera As Fossil
The most damning criticism of
opera states that it is no longer of
this world; it is at best an artifact,
a fossil. Opera, as Steve puts it, "is
performed today essentially as it
was performed a hundred years
ago." My first response to this
war-horse of an idea is: why is
opera singled out for this
criticism? I hear no howls of
agony when Shakespeare is
performed as he was three
hundred years ago, or when Bach
and Beethoven are played as they
were 250 and 150 years ago.
We don't dismiss Michelangelo
because his idiom has come and
gone or Cellini simply because we
don't need quite such elaborate
salt-cellars today. We don't shun
Gothic cathedrals because their
builder's didn't have the wit to
invent methods of pre-stressing
concrete. What we do shun,
putting it broadly, is a work of art
that has nothing of beauty or
truth (about something we
recognize) in it any longer. This is
the only meaningful standard by
which to judge any artwork,
including an opera.
Musically, of course opera has
improved tremendously in the last
hundred years. To support the
contention that singers have
improved, it must suffice to cite
George Bernard Shaw, who
started writing musical criticism in
1876 and stopped in 1950: "The
notion that singing has
deteriorated in the present
century is only a phase of the
Good Old Times delusion. It has,
in fact, enormously improved."
Elsewhere improvement has been
remarkable: improved
instruments, better halls, better
acoustics, better, more
enlightened vocal training, wiser

musicological support and
research. One could go on.
Technical Advances
Technically, the advances over
19th century performance
standards need no elaboration.
Sophistication of stage-moving,
-designing, -lighting techniques has
increased fantastically.
Freedom of experimentation
with new and old operas alike has
increased greatly often to utterly
ludicrous effect. Hardly any opera
is, as Steve suggested, sacrosanct;
we have had modern-dress Mozart
and science-fiction Wagner. Right
here in S.F., the Spring Opera
Theater has indulged in the
wildest experimentation. Indeed, J
would venture the generalization
that a major cause of bad opera is
overly ingenious, unbridled or
ill-thought-out experimenting, not
the alleged mouldiness of the bulk
of the standard repertory.
Nor is the repertory so
stultifyingly un-modern as some
would have it. To say that opera
after 1910 is nonexistant requires
one to ignore the likes of Berg,
Bartok, Orff, Britten, Henze,
Janacek, or Ginastera. Anyone
who still thinks opera is quaint,
innocuous, centuries-old claptrap
is simply deluding himself.
Finally, one must say that it is
not necessarily bad that an opera
is performed as it was at its
premiere. We have no inclination
to correct the untrue anatomy of
Michelangelo's "David"; and
likewise (1 hope) we should have
no desire to fill out Mozart's
orchestration of "Don Giovanni"
because it lacks a sousaphone,
electric guitar, or the joys of
moog synthesis.
Opera As Theater
The next axiom accuses opera
of being anti-dramatic. The answer
to this is easy: opera is not,
should never attempt to be,
merely theater. Opera and drama
are discrete art-forms. More
precisely, opera is a more
expansive and multi-faceted
art form which includes but is not
wholly subservient to the
technical demands of drama.
Now, I am the first to admit
that theatrical values are often
short-changed in opera; when they
are, the result is invariably
less-than-ideal opera. But when
those values are served as well as
the additional duties of a singer
(e.g. maintenance of proper pitch,
tone, tempo, proper cue entrance,
acheivement of right vocal mood,
and so on) permit ... well, its
gangbusters.
People who crave opera as
theater should probably stick to
the legitimate stage, for there the
demands of naturalism and
realism may be appropriate--and
their fulfillment possible. The
presence of the fifth dimension of
music in opera makes it far a more
complex and problematical
art-form--one which cannot
permit preoccupation with
"theatrical" values alone.
Opera In English
Another ploy related to the
opera-is-absurd gambit concerns
language. The basic idea here is
the perfectly reasonable assertion
that a provincial audience which
knows no other language should
see opera in its own tongue. But
many factors arise to complicate
the issue.
First, English is not a grateful
language to sing; Italian, for
instance, with its prevalent vowel
sounds is a much more musical
language. Second, some operas are
so well known or so simply
plotted that translation into
English is hardly necessary.
Thirdly, the greater the
cosmopolitan nature and
sophistication of an audience the
more likely will be performance in
the original language, in order to
assure best the unity of the work
as it was written.
Hence, all the important opera
houses in the world (London,
Vienna, Milan, New York,
Hamburg, Berlin, and San
Francisco) as a rule perform in the
original language. Far from being
an insult, it is a compliment to the
audience. I should note that the

S.F. Opera has not been afraid to
do English operas (witness this
season's "Onegin"and last season's
"Magic Flute"). As well, the
Stanford Opera and other local
opera groups do much opera in
English.
Fourthly, there is a severe
shortage of good, up-to-date,
imaginative English translations of
many important operas. No
modern audience will stand for
much "When doubt the tortured
frame is rending" or "Such dish
by man not oft is seen." Finally,
some operatic librettos are so
mindblowingly pedestrian (though
the music may be subline) that
ignorance of what precisely is
being said is bliss.
Whether the native or the
original tongue is appropriate is a
question that should not be
decided dogmatically: both
provincialism and snobbery
should be avoided. Rather, the
question should be decided by
considering the nature of the
opera and the kind of audience
which will see it.
Woofer-Tweeter Syndrome
Next on the agenda is the
all-too-common desire to consign
opera to the dustbin because the
soprano is bovine. Steve sees a fat
soprano in "Faust" and
henceforeward as an opera it is
ruined for him. Gee. There are so
many things to worry about and
watch and listen for, that it seems
just a slight bit narrow-minded to
throw in the blanket simply
because the singer is obese. What
would Plato say about such
mundane concern for sensual
beauty?
Actually this sympton is quite
common. I like to think of it as
part of the Woofer-Tweeter
Syndrome. We don't blame a
woofer for not being a tweeter
because each speaker is designed
to produce its own kind of sound.
They are different in size due to
certain laws of physics. The same
is roughly true for sopranos, due
to certain laws of physiology.
Vocal tweeters (coloratura
sopranos, who sound to the
uninformed like trained canaries)
can afford to be svelte and petite,
for that only have to produce tiny
(albeit ear-piercing) sounds.
Soprano woofers, on the other
hand, are the ones who need
stamina and sheer lung-power to
do their job. They produce the

huge sounds and must take the
heavy "dramatic" roles. These
ladies have to be built like arks or
they will never make it to the
final curtain.
It is no coincidence that nearly
all of the great sopranos today are
big women: Sutherland, Sills,
Price, Arroyo, Nilsson, Home,
Caballe. All these singers saw what
happened when Maria Callas
decided to lose her weight
and -should this surprise
anyone—lost something of her
voice in the process. No, I think
meretricious is the best word for
the fat-soprano criticism.
Xenophobia
Another myth that should be
interred at last is that all our
opera-singers are imported from
Europe. A. This ideas is fiat-out
wrong, as a perusal of the list of
artists for the S.F. and N.Y.
seasons this year would show. B.
The nationality of a singer has
nothing to do with anything,
except to explain why he is
singing the language of a
particular performance
unintelligibly. This argument
should now seem rather dated. It
is a last-ditch argument designed
to play upon xenophobic biases.
The final attack upon opera
states that since people go to
opera for the silliest damned
reasons, opera itself must be
pretty damned silly. This
argument falls of its own weight.
True enough that many like opera
because pre- and post-opera
parties would seem odd without
it, that many need a good excuse
to spend $800 on a costume that
wouid be hee-hawed anywhere
but in an opera foyer, that many
see the opera as a necessary facade
for the nice bars in the basement.
Also true is the fact that people
go to opera for widely differing
thrills. Some go for sheer
spectacle, and are please to admire
the frame without ever looking at
the picture. And certainly opera is
still the most eye-filling live
spectacle there is. Some go
because they have a connubial or
blood relation whose will to go to
opera cannot be conveniently or
politely denied. But these are the
Trivial People and need not detain
us. They do help keep the Opera
from bankruptcy, and as long as
they do not chat, snore or eat
hard candy during the

performance they do not offend
me or lessen my respect for opera.
Orgasmic School
Many go to opera because they
get a thrill listening to vocal feats.
This I think of as the Orgasmic
School, whose creed was first
expressed by Walt Whitman: "1
hear the trained soprano . . . she
convulses me like the climax of
my love-grip." Now this sort of
enjoyment is not to be despised
altogether. It is exhilirating,
galvanic—this pleasure in a
beautifully produced, extenuated
and released vocal tone. I've
always thought Joyce caught this
thrill in vocal ism best in
"Ulysses," where he describes the
climactic moment in a tenor's
aria:
It soared, a bird, it held its
flight, a swift pure cry, soar
silver orb leaped serene,
speeding, sustained, to come,
don't spin it out too long long
breath he breath long life,
soaring high, high respledent,
aflame, crowned, high in the
effulgence symbolistic, high, of
the ethereal bosom, high, of
the high vast irradiation
everywhere all soaring all
around about the all, the
endlessnessnessness. . . .
Such is the thrill of great
vocalism, but this only touches
the superficial joy of opera.
The final segment of the opera
audience is the only one I care to
defend. This segment (what
percentage it represents depends
on one's pessimism regarding
human nature) approaches opera
in the same way it would
approach any work of art. That is,
they seek a coherent, unified, and
intelligible translation of human
experience into some kind of
sensible form (this is the best I
can do in the way of a definition
of art).
These people are willing to
concede the limitations which a
given form of art carries with it,
and are prepared to seek its
rewards within this framework.
To set these limitations upon
opera in proper perspective, then,
will be my concern in Part 11, for
it is a willingness to understand
and live with them alone that I
think can lead to the fullest
appreciation of this greatest
art-form.
