# Technology, Values Examined By Courses
## 
### 
The Humanities Special
Program is seeking external
funding for its experimental,
multi-disciplinary program in
"Values, Technology, and Society
(VTS) which began this year.
The eight courses, funded by
the University Progress Funds
during this pilot year, aimed at "a
new, timely mode for
undergraduate education using
technology as a central focus but
with human values as a central
component," notes Prof. Robert
McGinn, member of the VTS
Administrative committee.
McGinn plans to offer the same
eight courses next year and will
seek additional funding for ten
more. The proposal is aimed at
attracting types of funding such as
the grant received from the Ford
foundation for expanding the
Human Biology program.
"We have had really good
response to the program,"

McGinn notes. Over 220 students
have enrolled in six of the eight
courses offered so far this year.
Next quarter VTS will offer a
limited-enrollment seminar
making a chronological survey of
technological development. The
course will divide into four study
groups, studying different
primitive cultures from an
anthropological perspective and
follow technological paths leading
into the twentieth century.
