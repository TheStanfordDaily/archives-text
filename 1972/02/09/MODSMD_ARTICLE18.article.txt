# Gymnastics Mentor Explains Life-Style
## 
### 
Like most athletes, Dan Millman, Stanford's
Gymastics Coach, began his particular endeavor
because he had a need to feel a sense of
achievement, of worth, to overcome some basic
challenges. He began on the trampoline at 12 years
of age, and was California State Champion at 14
years of age.
Millman branched out to the other gymnastics
events in high school, and became one of the best
performers in Los Angeles. After winning the U.S.
Gymnastics Federation National Championships at
16 years of age, Millman was offered a number of
scholarships, and continued his education at U.C.
Berkeley.
Two months after beginning college, Millman was
flown to England for the World Trampoline
Championships, and characteristically, won.
From that time on, he concentrated on studies
(psychology major) and all around gymnastics.
Millman did very well at both .. . but one event, the
side horse, was to plague him, and as he quips, "One
judge said I should be reported to the S.P.C.A. for
cruelty to animals after seeing my side horse
performance."
Though scoring over 9.0 in every event except the
side horse, this one event was to hold him back
from all-around honors.
He competed in the Maccabiah Games in Israel,
and was on an international team that competed in
Canada.
Cycle Accident
One summer, in 1967, some fateful events befell
Millman. After doing some work in a Tony
Curtis-Sharon Tate movie, Millman flew to an
Olympic training camp in Pennsylvania where
potential Olympains trained together. "One of the
best training experiences of my life," he says. But
only two days after returning, and one day before
he was to be flown to the World Championships in
Yugoslavia as an observer, Millman's career was cut
short by a serious accident involving his motorcycle
and a misguided automobile.
Millman found himself in the hospital with a
shattered right leg and other miscellaneous injuries.
"I had some time to sit back and think."
Confronted for the first time with the fact that his
lifelong source of achievement might no longer
exist, some basic changes in his view of life evolved.
Millman began playing the guitar while still on his
back in the hospital. He became a vegetarian, having
"gained a sudden empathy for helpless, suffering
animals." After not eating for five days and eating
very little for two weeks after that, (and losing 25
pounts), "previously jaded tastes and senses became
more sensitive, and as I was able to walk on crutches
out of the hospital, it seemed like I was flying."
Millman gained some insight into the intrinsic
richness of just existing, and a previously
compulsive need for achievement as a source of
self-worth became smaller in light of new insights.
Yet Millman never liked unfinished business, and
began training with a new sense of dedication and
involvement. More than a year later, Dan Millman
was captain of the NCAA Championship team in

1968 and his 9.45 routine on the horizontal bar
captured the team title (by .05!) for Berkeley.
In his senior year in college, Dan was married,
and upon graduation, because a baby was on the
way, he decided to forsake an Olympic bid in favor
of a job in Los Angeles doing stunt-work and free
lance writing. Writing, he quickly discovered, wasn't
a sure source of income, and stunt-work in
Hollywood is a rat-race.
After briefly working as a trapeze artist, Mill man
tried his hand at selling life-insurance. Finally after a
month of L.A. smog and business suits, Millman
snapped. He and his wife drove up north looking for
work. He heard the job (coaching gymnastics) at
Stanford was open, applied, and was appointed.
More Life-Changes
"Since then," Millman recalls, "even more
life-changes have occurred." His coaching style has
evolved with the years, and has grown more
humanistic. "There is a pressure, because of the
competitive nature of sport today, for coaches to
feel that their success as individuals depends almost
solely upon their team's competitive record." It's
difficult then, for a coach not to end up viewing the
team as his team, and treating the athletes as objects
to work for his success.
If more coaches would constantly remind
themselves that the athletes belong there more than
the coaches, and a coach is essentially a team
assistant, to help but not to rule, the athletic
experience might be a more pleasant one for all
concerned. But because of growing competitive
pressures, and since coaches are human, it's a
difficult problem.
Since the Stanford gymnastics team had some lean
years, Millman learned to relax and have a sense of
humor, "if only for psychological self-preservation.
I learned that success as a coach can be judged in
many ways .. . how deeply he can engender a sense
of joy for the activity and how he can point out
how the activity can intrinsically add more meaning
to life in general."
Because of this, Dan Millman has dug for more
philosophical depth in gymnastics. He admits his job
is easier than for some coaches, because gymnastics
has some aesthetic performance aspects that some
other sports might not have, and many people come
to see gymnastics performances regardless of who
wins or loses.
As it happens, many young men have been
attracted to the Stanford program in gymnastics.
They like being treated as mature individuals and
enjoy making their own decisions about when and
with whom they compete, so Stanford is now one
of the top teams in the nation in gymnastics, and
should remain near the top for a number of years.
"What makes mp happiest," says Millman, "is
that we are able to field a fine team through a
humanistic program. It reaffirms my belief that as
long as the athlete desires to attain mastery, he is
the best judge of his own training and his life. I
hope many of the Stanford gymnasts will be able to
say it was one of the richest experiences of their
lives."

MILLMAN AND HIS MEN—Gymnastics coach Dan Millman is shown at lower left conversing witn one of

16 years of age, Millman was offered a number of
scholarships, and continued his education at U.C.
Berkeley.
Two months after beginning college, Millman was
flown to England for the World Trampoline
Championships, and characteristically, won.
From that time on, he concentrated on studies
(psychology major) and all around gymnastics.
Millman did very well at both .. . but one event, the
side horse, was to plague him, and as he quips, "One
judge said I should be reported to the S.P.C.A. for
cruelty to animals after seeing my side horse
performance."
Though scoring over 9.0 in every event except the
side horse, this one event was to hold him back
from all-around honors.
He competed in the Maccabiah Games in Israel,
and was on an international team that competed in
Canada.
Cycle Accident
One summer, in 1967, some fateful events befell
Millman. After doing some work in a Tony
Curtis-Sharon Tate movie, Millman flew to an
Olympic training camp in Pennsylvania where
potential Olympains trained together. "One of the
best training experiences of my life," he says. But
only two days after returning, and one day before
he was to be flown to the World Championships in
Yugoslavia as an observer, Millman's career was cut
short by a serious accident involving his motorcycle
and a misguided automobile.
Millman found himself in the hospital with a
shattered right leg and other miscellaneous injuries.
"I had some time to sit back and think."
Confronted for the first time with the fact that his
lifelong source of achievement might no longer
exist, some basic changes in his view of life evolved.
Millman began playing the guitar while still on his
back in the hospital. He became a vegetarian, having
"gained a sudden empathy for helpless, suffering
animals." After not eating for five days and eating
very little for two weeks after that, (and losing 25
pounts), "previously jaded tastes and senses became
more sensitive, and as I was able to walk on crutches
out of the hospital, it seemed like I was flying."
Millman gained some insight into the intrinsic
richness of just existing, and a previously
compulsive need for achievement as a source of
self-worth became smaller in light of new insights.
Yet Millman never liked unfinished business, and
began training with a new sense of dedication and
involvement. More than a year later, Dan Millman
was captain of the NCAA Championship team in

1968 and his 9.45 routine on the horizontal bar
captured the team title (by .05!) for Berkeley.
In his senior year in college, Dan was married,
and upon graduation, because a baby was on the
way, he decided to forsake an Olympic bid in favor
of a job in Los Angeles doing stunt-work and free
lance writing. Writing, he quickly discovered, wasn't
a sure source of income, and stunt-work in
Hollywood is a rat-race.
After briefly working as a trapeze artist, Mill man
tried his hand at selling life-insurance. Finally after a
month of L.A. smog and business suits, Millman
snapped. He and his wife drove up north looking for
work. He heard the job (coaching gymnastics) at
Stanford was open, applied, and was appointed.
More Life-Changes
"Since then," Millman recalls, "even more
life-changes have occurred." His coaching style has
evolved with the years, and has grown more
humanistic. "There is a pressure, because of the
competitive nature of sport today, for coaches to
feel that their success as individuals depends almost
solely upon their team's competitive record." It's
difficult then, for a coach not to end up viewing the
team as his team, and treating the athletes as objects
to work for his success.
If more coaches would constantly remind
themselves that the athletes belong there more than
the coaches, and a coach is essentially a team
assistant, to help but not to rule, the athletic
experience might be a more pleasant one for all
concerned. But because of growing competitive
pressures, and since coaches are human, it's a
difficult problem.
Since the Stanford gymnastics team had some lean
years, Millman learned to relax and have a sense of
humor, "if only for psychological self-preservation.
I learned that success as a coach can be judged in
many ways .. . how deeply he can engender a sense
of joy for the activity and how he can point out
how the activity can intrinsically add more meaning
to life in general."
Because of this, Dan Millman has dug for more
philosophical depth in gymnastics. He admits his job
is easier than for some coaches, because gymnastics
has some aesthetic performance aspects that some
other sports might not have, and many people come
to see gymnastics performances regardless of who
wins or loses.
As it happens, many young men have been
attracted to the Stanford program in gymnastics.
They like being treated as mature individuals and
enjoy making their own decisions about when and
with whom they compete, so Stanford is now one
of the top teams in the nation in gymnastics, and
should remain near the top for a number of years.
"What makes mp happiest," says Millman, "is
that we are able to field a fine team through a
humanistic program. It reaffirms my belief that as
long as the athlete desires to attain mastery, he is
the best judge of his own training and his life. I
hope many of the Stanford gymnasts will be able to
say it was one of the richest experiences of their
lives."

MILLMAN AND HIS MEN—Gymnastics coach Dan Millman is shown at lower left conversing witn one of

judge said I should be reported to the S.P.C.A. for
cruelty to animals after seeing my side horse
performance."
Though scoring over 9.0 in every event except the
side horse, this one event was to hold him back
from all-around honors.
He competed in the Maccabiah Games in Israel,
and was on an international team that competed in
Canada.
Cycle Accident
One summer, in 1967, some fateful events befell
Millman. After doing some work in a Tony
Curtis-Sharon Tate movie, Millman flew to an
Olympic training camp in Pennsylvania where
potential Olympains trained together. "One of the
best training experiences of my life," he says. But
only two days after returning, and one day before
he was to be flown to the World Championships in
Yugoslavia as an observer, Millman's career was cut
short by a serious accident involving his motorcycle
and a misguided automobile.
Millman found himself in the hospital with a
shattered right leg and other miscellaneous injuries.
"I had some time to sit back and think."
Confronted for the first time with the fact that his
lifelong source of achievement might no longer
exist, some basic changes in his view of life evolved.
Millman began playing the guitar while still on his
back in the hospital. He became a vegetarian, having
"gained a sudden empathy for helpless, suffering
animals." After not eating for five days and eating
very little for two weeks after that, (and losing 25
pounts), "previously jaded tastes and senses became
more sensitive, and as I was able to walk on crutches
out of the hospital, it seemed like I was flying."
Millman gained some insight into the intrinsic
richness of just existing, and a previously
compulsive need for achievement as a source of
self-worth became smaller in light of new insights.
Yet Millman never liked unfinished business, and
began training with a new sense of dedication and
involvement. More than a year later, Dan Millman
was captain of the NCAA Championship team in

1968 and his 9.45 routine on the horizontal bar
captured the team title (by .05!) for Berkeley.
In his senior year in college, Dan was married,
and upon graduation, because a baby was on the
way, he decided to forsake an Olympic bid in favor
of a job in Los Angeles doing stunt-work and free
lance writing. Writing, he quickly discovered, wasn't
a sure source of income, and stunt-work in
Hollywood is a rat-race.
After briefly working as a trapeze artist, Mill man
tried his hand at selling life-insurance. Finally after a
month of L.A. smog and business suits, Millman
snapped. He and his wife drove up north looking for
work. He heard the job (coaching gymnastics) at
Stanford was open, applied, and was appointed.
More Life-Changes
"Since then," Millman recalls, "even more
life-changes have occurred." His coaching style has
evolved with the years, and has grown more
humanistic. "There is a pressure, because of the
competitive nature of sport today, for coaches to
feel that their success as individuals depends almost
solely upon their team's competitive record." It's
difficult then, for a coach not to end up viewing the
team as his team, and treating the athletes as objects
to work for his success.
If more coaches would constantly remind
themselves that the athletes belong there more than
the coaches, and a coach is essentially a team
assistant, to help but not to rule, the athletic
experience might be a more pleasant one for all
concerned. But because of growing competitive
pressures, and since coaches are human, it's a
difficult problem.
Since the Stanford gymnastics team had some lean
years, Millman learned to relax and have a sense of
humor, "if only for psychological self-preservation.
I learned that success as a coach can be judged in
many ways .. . how deeply he can engender a sense
of joy for the activity and how he can point out
how the activity can intrinsically add more meaning
to life in general."
Because of this, Dan Millman has dug for more
philosophical depth in gymnastics. He admits his job
is easier than for some coaches, because gymnastics
has some aesthetic performance aspects that some
other sports might not have, and many people come
to see gymnastics performances regardless of who
wins or loses.
As it happens, many young men have been
attracted to the Stanford program in gymnastics.
They like being treated as mature individuals and
enjoy making their own decisions about when and
with whom they compete, so Stanford is now one
of the top teams in the nation in gymnastics, and
should remain near the top for a number of years.
"What makes mp happiest," says Millman, "is
that we are able to field a fine team through a
humanistic program. It reaffirms my belief that as
long as the athlete desires to attain mastery, he is
the best judge of his own training and his life. I
hope many of the Stanford gymnasts will be able to
say it was one of the richest experiences of their
lives."

MILLMAN AND HIS MEN—Gymnastics coach Dan Millman is shown at lower left conversing witn one of
his gymnasts before an event in the USC meet this year. Millman rejects the stereotyped coach's role and
regards himself as an assistant to his gymnasts instead of a taskmaster dedicated to winning. Stanford's
incredible gymnastic success this year is largely attributable to Millman and his philosophy that it is more
important to achieve aesthetic mastery than to win.
Like most athletes, Dan Millman, Stanford's
Gymastics Coach, began his particular endeavor
because he had a need to feel a sense of
achievement, of worth, to overcome some basic
challenges. He began on the trampoline at 12 years
of age, and was California State Champion at 14
years of age.
Millman branched out to the other gymnastics
events in high school, and became one of the best
performers in Los Angeles. After winning the U.S.
Gymnastics Federation National Championships at
16 years of age, Millman was offered a number of
scholarships, and continued his education at U.C.
Berkeley.
Two months after beginning college, Millman was
flown to England for the World Trampoline
Championships, and characteristically, won.
From that time on, he concentrated on studies
(psychology major) and all around gymnastics.
Millman did very well at both .. . but one event, the
side horse, was to plague him, and as he quips, "One
judge said I should be reported to the S.P.C.A. for
cruelty to animals after seeing my side horse
