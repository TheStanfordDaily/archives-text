# Frosh Standout
## Kelley Faces Big Challenge 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
This is the year of the big man
in college basketball. Marquette's
Jim Chones, UCLA's Bill Walton,
Maryland's Tom McMillan,
Washington's Steve Hawes, and
Ohio State's Luke Witte are just a
few of the giants who have
dominated the 1971-72 college
basketball scene.
Next year Stanford's 7 foot
freshman Rich Kelley will make a
bid to be included in a similar
elitegroupof the nation's top big
men. Although he hasn't yet
developed the strength of Hawes,
the soft hook of McMillan, the
powerful inside play of Chones, or
the overall dominance of Walton,
Kelley has shown a variety of
talents which should lead him to
future greatness.
Best Big Man
"Rich has the ability to be the
best big man we've ever had," says
freshman coach Bub Bowling. "He
has great mobility, is an
outstanding shooter, and passes
the ball as well as most guards."
Kelley is averaging 18.1 points
and over 16 rebounds a game for
the Stanford frosh. Surprisingly,
he had done mast of his scoring
on soft jumpers from the 10-15
foot range.
"Rich has such good mobility
and can shoot so well from
outside that his inside game has

suffered," explains Bowling.
"He'll have to strengthen his
inside game before he can become
really dominant in varsity ball."
Kelley has been extremely
effective defensively. He has
averaged over five blocked shots a
game and holds the team defense
intact by calling screens, directing
his teammates, and posing an
imminent threat for anyone who
dares to drive down the middle.
Front Line Strength
When Kelley moves up to the
varsity next season, Howie
Dallmar will inherit the same type
of problem that talent-laden
coaches like UCLA's John
Wooden face every year. Dallmar
will almost certainly start Kelley
and 6'9" Mike Mann but the other
starting spots are up for grabs.
Dave Frost, Steve Shupe, and
Bob Buell have all done
outstanding jobs for Stanford this
season but there won't be enough
starting spots to go around next
year. And the picture will be
clouded even further with the

addition of standout forwards
Scott Trobbe, Mel Arterberry, and
Archie Dean from this year's
frosh.
"Its going to be very
competitive on our own team to
see who starts up front," Bowling
predicts. "There are going to be
some excellent players sitting on
the bench."
Walton Battle
This front line strength will be
tested severely in Stanford's
games against UCLA, particularly
in Kelley's individual battles with
Walton "The difference between
Rich and Walton is that Rich
doesn't get up as quickly," says
Bowling. "Rich reacts quickly and
has good hands but he needs
better thrust."
Will Kelley be able to compete
with Walton? Bowling has
expressed guarded optimism. "I'm
sure he can compete with Walton
because of his intelligence, size,
and mobility. Whether he can
neutralize him is open to
question."

best big man we've ever had," says
freshman coach Bub Bowling. "He
has great mobility, is an
outstanding shooter, and passes
the ball as well as most guards."
Kelley is averaging 18.1 points
and over 16 rebounds a game for
the Stanford frosh. Surprisingly,
he had done mast of his scoring
on soft jumpers from the 10-15
foot range.
"Rich has such good mobility
and can shoot so well from
outside that his inside game has

suffered," explains Bowling.
"He'll have to strengthen his
inside game before he can become
really dominant in varsity ball."
Kelley has been extremely
effective defensively. He has
averaged over five blocked shots a
game and holds the team defense
intact by calling screens, directing
his teammates, and posing an
imminent threat for anyone who
dares to drive down the middle.
Front Line Strength
When Kelley moves up to the
varsity next season, Howie
Dallmar will inherit the same type
of problem that talent-laden
coaches like UCLA's John
Wooden face every year. Dallmar
will almost certainly start Kelley
and 6'9" Mike Mann but the other
starting spots are up for grabs.
Dave Frost, Steve Shupe, and
Bob Buell have all done
outstanding jobs for Stanford this
season but there won't be enough
starting spots to go around next
year. And the picture will be
clouded even further with the

addition of standout forwards
Scott Trobbe, Mel Arterberry, and
Archie Dean from this year's
frosh.
"Its going to be very
competitive on our own team to
see who starts up front," Bowling
predicts. "There are going to be
some excellent players sitting on
the bench."
Walton Battle
This front line strength will be
tested severely in Stanford's
games against UCLA, particularly
in Kelley's individual battles with
Walton "The difference between
Rich and Walton is that Rich
doesn't get up as quickly," says
Bowling. "Rich reacts quickly and
has good hands but he needs
better thrust."
Will Kelley be able to compete
with Walton? Bowling has
expressed guarded optimism. "I'm
sure he can compete with Walton
because of his intelligence, size,
and mobility. Whether he can
neutralize him is open to
question."
This is the year of the big man
in college basketball. Marquette's
Jim Chones, UCLA's Bill Walton,
Maryland's Tom McMillan,
Washington's Steve Hawes, and
Ohio State's Luke Witte are just a
few of the giants who have
dominated the 1971-72 college
basketball scene.
Next year Stanford's 7 foot
freshman Rich Kelley will make a
bid to be included in a similar
elitegroupof the nation's top big
men. Although he hasn't yet
developed the strength of Hawes,
the soft hook of McMillan, the
powerful inside play of Chones, or
the overall dominance of Walton,
Kelley has shown a variety of
talents which should lead him to
future greatness.
