# Apathy Hinders Recycling Program
## 
### DAN BRENNER News Commentary 
About two years ago the United
States became aware of the mess it was
making of its countryside. Stanford's
response was an ecology fair, colorful
blue and white streamers at football

games proclaiming "Recycle," high
flying rhetoric, and then apathy.
Today, the streamers have faded,
the rhetoric has been written into
textbooks, but the apathy remains.
The Stanford Recycling Project, the
volunteer-oriented plan to haul

bottles, cans and newspapers to
manufacturers rather than junk heaps,
is in need of people to act behind their
beliefs on ecology.
"Nobody thinks it's important
enough yet; it's just part of the
effluent society. Unless more students
join in, we're going to have to stop the
project," says Terry Fotre. manager of
the Recycling Project.
The recycling project got off to a
good start this year, though. Two
containers for each dormitory were
alloted by the Housing Office in order
to collect recyclables. The cans cost
about $500.
Two campus recycling centers were
also set up, one by the boathouse near
Lake Lagunita, one in the Wilbur
parking lot.
Unpleasant Job
But the key to the system is
supposed to be dormitory
representatives who would do the
unpleasant but necessary job of getting
the recyclable material from the dorms
to the centers. And that is where the
system has been breaking down.
"Some of the representatives
haven't been following through on the
weekends," notes Alan Cummings,
University housing officer. Fotre adds,
"Some people became reps only so
that they could put it on their college
transcripts."

One result of dorm rep negligence
by some occurred at the end of last
quarter. As neglected syrup-filled cans
in one dorm began to attract rodents
and other pests, the housing office was
forced to throw away the recyclables
because the reps forgot about the
project.
There also has been a serious lack
of volunteers to monitor the two
centers on the weekends. The result of
general community apathy to the
project has forced the closing of the
Lagunita facility and threatened the
future of the Wilbur center.
The Ecology House, which has
served with a few other community
members — notably dorm residents of
Junipero — as a task force for the
centers, have been asked to do more
than their share of the work.
"The Recycling Project is not an
Ecology House project," Fotre, a
member of the House explained,
although the general community
attitude might suggest that the House
had been elected as the official
cleanup committee for the university.
Unclaimed Garbage
Funds for the project came from an
autumn quarter auction of unclaimed
storage. The auction netted $1,200,
which was divided between the
Stanford Conservation Club and the
Ecology Recycling Fund, which Fotre
manages. Hut the fund has dwindled as
a result of lack of volunteers.
Fotre notes that recycling is
economically viable: "We're just about
on a break-even status." The costs
involved in recycling are basically
storage containers and trucking
rentals. It costs $40 to rent a hauler
for a load of recyclables to Bay Area

processing plants. The fund receives
$200 per ton of aluminum, $20 per
ton of mixed glass, $10 per ton of
bimetal cans, and $20 per ton of tin.
The recycled tin and bimetal cans
are not used to make new cans. M and
T Chemical Co. of San Francisco,
which accepts the recycled metals,
burns off the aluminum and tin
coatings in acid bath and sells the
remaining steel to mining companies

for use in precipitating copper out of
mines.
The aluminum cans are recycled by
Coors West, which turns it over to
Kaiser Aluminum in Oakland, and the
crushed glass, which is trucked to
Owens-Illinois Corp. and the Glass
Container Corporation, is recycled
into new containers.
But even when the Recycling
Project is able to get enough products
for a haul, it meets frustration in the
process. For instance on the last visit
to Glass Container the yard manager
refused to accept a batch of
recyclables, saying that they didn't
need them.
But the big headache for the
organizers of recycling is the general
apathy by Stanford people. "You're
dealing with a society that is geared to
the other direction when you try to
return junk," observed Fotre.
But recycling is not an end in itself,
Fotre observed; it's only a stop gap
measure. And it requires more than
sporadic tribute by the community.
But if ecology remains the empty
issue that it is, its present condition
for most students, then as Fotre
suggests, the time for preparing for
environmental restoration might run
out.
"Our commitment must be more
than putting cans at the end of the
hall," Cummings said.

project.
There also has been a serious lack
of volunteers to monitor the two
centers on the weekends. The result of
general community apathy to the
project has forced the closing of the
Lagunita facility and threatened the
future of the Wilbur center.
The Ecology House, which has
served with a few other community
members — notably dorm residents of
Junipero — as a task force for the
centers, have been asked to do more
than their share of the work.
"The Recycling Project is not an
Ecology House project," Fotre, a
member of the House explained,
although the general community
attitude might suggest that the House
had been elected as the official
cleanup committee for the university.
Unclaimed Garbage
Funds for the project came from an
autumn quarter auction of unclaimed
storage. The auction netted $1,200,
which was divided between the
Stanford Conservation Club and the
Ecology Recycling Fund, which Fotre
manages. Hut the fund has dwindled as
a result of lack of volunteers.
Fotre notes that recycling is
economically viable: "We're just about
on a break-even status." The costs
involved in recycling are basically
storage containers and trucking
rentals. It costs $40 to rent a hauler
for a load of recyclables to Bay Area

processing plants. The fund receives
$200 per ton of aluminum, $20 per
ton of mixed glass, $10 per ton of
bimetal cans, and $20 per ton of tin.
The recycled tin and bimetal cans
are not used to make new cans. M and
T Chemical Co. of San Francisco,
which accepts the recycled metals,
burns off the aluminum and tin
coatings in acid bath and sells the
remaining steel to mining companies

for use in precipitating copper out of
mines.
The aluminum cans are recycled by
Coors West, which turns it over to
Kaiser Aluminum in Oakland, and the
crushed glass, which is trucked to
Owens-Illinois Corp. and the Glass
Container Corporation, is recycled
into new containers.
But even when the Recycling
Project is able to get enough products
for a haul, it meets frustration in the
process. For instance on the last visit
to Glass Container the yard manager
refused to accept a batch of
recyclables, saying that they didn't
need them.
But the big headache for the
organizers of recycling is the general
apathy by Stanford people. "You're
dealing with a society that is geared to
the other direction when you try to
return junk," observed Fotre.
But recycling is not an end in itself,
Fotre observed; it's only a stop gap
measure. And it requires more than
sporadic tribute by the community.
But if ecology remains the empty
issue that it is, its present condition
for most students, then as Fotre
suggests, the time for preparing for
environmental restoration might run
out.
"Our commitment must be more
than putting cans at the end of the
hall," Cummings said.

RECYCLING—Recycling centers such as this one in a Wilbur Hall parking lot serve as collection points for recyclable
materials on campus. Recycling programs received strong support and cooperation at first, but enthusiasm and
participation has declined in recent months.
About two years ago the United
States became aware of the mess it was
making of its countryside. Stanford's
response was an ecology fair, colorful
blue and white streamers at football

games proclaiming "Recycle," high
flying rhetoric, and then apathy.
Today, the streamers have faded,
the rhetoric has been written into
textbooks, but the apathy remains.
The Stanford Recycling Project, the
volunteer-oriented plan to haul

bottles, cans and newspapers to
manufacturers rather than junk heaps,
is in need of people to act behind their
beliefs on ecology.
"Nobody thinks it's important
enough yet; it's just part of the
effluent society. Unless more students
join in, we're going to have to stop the
project," says Terry Fotre. manager of
the Recycling Project.
The recycling project got off to a
good start this year, though. Two
containers for each dormitory were
alloted by the Housing Office in order
to collect recyclables. The cans cost
about $500.
Two campus recycling centers were
also set up, one by the boathouse near
Lake Lagunita, one in the Wilbur
parking lot.
Unpleasant Job
But the key to the system is
supposed to be dormitory
representatives who would do the
unpleasant but necessary job of getting
the recyclable material from the dorms
to the centers. And that is where the
system has been breaking down.
"Some of the representatives
haven't been following through on the
weekends," notes Alan Cummings,
University housing officer. Fotre adds,
"Some people became reps only so
that they could put it on their college
transcripts."

One result of dorm rep negligence
by some occurred at the end of last
quarter. As neglected syrup-filled cans
in one dorm began to attract rodents
and other pests, the housing office was
forced to throw away the recyclables
because the reps forgot about the
project.
There also has been a serious lack

crushed glass, which is trucked to
Owens-Illinois Corp. and the Glass
Container Corporation, is recycled
into new containers.
But even when the Recycling
Project is able to get enough products
for a haul, it meets frustration in the
process. For instance on the last visit
to Glass Container the yard manager
refused to accept a batch of
recyclables, saying that they didn't
need them.
But the big headache for the
organizers of recycling is the general
apathy by Stanford people. "You're
dealing with a society that is geared to
the other direction when you try to
return junk," observed Fotre.
But recycling is not an end in itself,
Fotre observed; it's only a stop gap
measure. And it requires more than
sporadic tribute by the community.
But if ecology remains the empty
issue that it is, its present condition
for most students, then as Fotre
suggests, the time for preparing for
environmental restoration might run
out.
"Our commitment must be more
than putting cans at the end of the
hall," Cummings said.

RECYCLING—Recycling centers such as this one in a Wilbur Hall parking lot serve as collection points for recyclable
materials on campus. Recycling programs received strong support and cooperation at first, but enthusiasm and
participation has declined in recent months.
