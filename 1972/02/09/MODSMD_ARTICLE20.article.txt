Editor's note: The sports pages
will continue to print letters of all
viewpoints from the community
on the issue of Stanford's Indian
symbol.
Editor, THE DAILY:
I am Hopi Indian. lam also a
graduate of Stanford University.
I recently read with
disappointment and sadness of
the objections made by the Native
American Group at Stanford
concerning the use of the Indian
as a name and emblem for the
University, its team and various
student groups.
In the personal relationships
and studies that I have had and
made of Indians, it appears that
the various Indian Tribes have
displayed great intelligence,
courage, perserverance and a
tremendous sense of humor. In
addition, almost every Indian
Tribe and its members
participated enthusiastically in
some athletic exercises and
contests.
Not all use of the Indian names
or representations are without
malice or prejudice; however, by
the same token every use is not
degrading, ridiculous and
prejudicial.
I believe Stanford's history has
been one of pride and honor so
far as the Indians are concerned.
The Stanford athletic teams
and the Leland Stanford, Jr.
University Band have each, on
occasion, displayed courage,
perserverance and wit. I would
like to think that these qualities
have added to the luster of
the Indian symbol and that the
Indian name and symbol have
been of some encouragement and
inspiration to them.
I am extremely proud of my
Indian blood; I am proud that I
had the opportunity and good
fortune to attend and graduate

from Stanford; I am doubly proud
that Stanford chose the Indian as
its symbol and that the University
and its students have in the past
years displayed the intelligence,
courage and wit which I believe
the symbol represents.
I encourage the Native
Americans, the University and all
of its students to take appropriate
action to retain their proud
symbol.
I would be personally and
deeply saddened to see the
passing of this tradition.

Editor, THE DAILY:
We the undersigned faculty and
students of the Department of
Anthropology, register our
support of the Petition by Native
American students to the
University ombudsman,
requesting the University to
discontinue its use of
characterized images of the Native
American.
It is the tenet of
Anthropologists that each
culture—and each Native
American tribe—should be
appreciated on its own terms and
respected for what it is. Stanfords
use of "Indian" images makes a
mockery of the proud peoples of
this continent. We deplore the use
of this characterization and
support Native American students
requesting its discontinuation.
(Signed by 22 students and 15
faculty of the Anthropology
Department)
Editor, THE DAILY:
The article by University
Ombudsman Lois Amsterdam
regarding the use of an Indian
mascot presented a rather
interesting perspective on the

entire issue. Ms. Amsterdam's j
remarks, ostensibly made under !
the banner of sensitivity, provided |
a delightful example of an !
underlying theme in much of j
contemporary liberal politics: the j
need for self-flagellation.
The burden of present and past I
racial injustice creates a very real
challenge of reform for white !
America. Clearly, Ms. Amsterdam
was quite thankful to the Native
Indians for the opportunity to
slobber over her own whiteness
and lack of "sensitivity." Further,
her expiation will not be complete j
until all remnants of a proud I
tradition are rashly destroyed; j
sadly, this masochistic miasma j
seems to pervade many sectors of :
the campus community.
As for the Native Indians' j
demands, I must admire their I
perceptive insight into the !
psychology of the University j
Administration and the clever i
manner in which they have
provided another opportunity for
the whiteman's atonement; I am ;
convinced that the Administration |
will meet all of their requests. ;
Perhaps then the Lois ;
Amsterdams of Stanford will i
descend from their holy crosses j
and begin to act like rational j
individuals.
