## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
National Labor Relations Board
officials, representatives of Stanford
and five labor unions will meet today
in San Francisco to set a date for the
upcoming elections in which
University employees will choose
collective bargaining representatives.
The conference will take place
today at 10:00 a.m. in the Federal
Building, and when it ends both the
University staff and the unions will
know when the present campaign to
swing votes will be over.
Police will decide whether or not
they want the Stanford Police Officers
Association to represent them, while
the firemen will do likewise with the
International Association of Fire
Fighters, Local 1-12.
University physical plant workers,
custodians, food service employees,
and lab support personnel will have
five unions listed on the ballot, but
only the United Stanford Employees,
the California School Employees
A ssoc i a t i on-Stanford Employees
Association (CSEA-SEA) and
Teamsters Local 856 will actually be
competing.
Workers Action Caucus, another
union ruled eligible by the NLRB, has
broken up, and Construction General
Laborers Local 270 failed to come up
with enough employee pledge cards to
qualify.
Campaigns Speed Up
The campaign to win the large third
group of employees continues to speed
up. The CSEA-SEA has set a meeting
tomorrow night in the Art
Auditorium; the featured speaker will
be Samuel Holmes, special counsel to
the group.
The Teamsters Stanford
Organizational Committee met
Tuesday night at Rickey's Hyatt
House in Palo Alto to discuss strategy
and level some criticism at the other
two unions.
In addition to the normal
techniques of buttonholing individual
workers, the Teamsters intend to pass
out buttons and stick-on sunflowers
that say "Teamsters are Beautiful."
The union plans an extensive mailing
campaign starting tomorrow, and will
take out a series of ads in various news
media to explain its position.
Officials also say they will bring a
bus on campus to act as an office, and
are trying to get University office
space for a larger headquarters.
Lots Of Contacts
They've also been contacting
employees by phone, during lunch,
and on coffee breaks. A major
Teamster objective is to schedule a
debate between spokesmen of the
various unions in Memorial

Auditorium.
"No use in spinning your wheels at
the start," said Rudy Tham, a
Teamster official, explaining his
union's long inactivity. "We want to
be more effective near election time."
Art Blevins, a Stanford worker and
an Organizational Committee member,
called the CSEA-SEA a
"don't-rock-the-boat union." He
dismissed the union's claim that 90
percent of its goals have been met
without strikes: "Most of them were
met after the first Teamster
presentation to the campus .. . not
(after) a few little rallies or someone
pounding their slipper."
