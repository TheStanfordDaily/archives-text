Dock Strike Agreement
SAN FRANCISCO — Longshoremen and
shippers reached tentative agreement yesterday
to end the crippling 123-day-old West Coast
dock strike.
The settlement will be submitted to a
committee representing locals of the
International Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen's Union and to individual
shippers, said private mediator Sam Kagel.
The committee would set the date of a
membership ratification vote and decide it
there would be a return to work pending a vote,
said Kagel. The committee will meet here Feb.
12.
"I am authorized to announce that the
ILWU and PMA negotiating committees
reached agreement on all economic issues,"
Kagel told a news conference. "Certain specific
non-economic issues will be mediated and if
necessary arbitrated by me," he said.
Despite a tentative voluntary agreement in
negotiations, the Senate voted Tuesday to end
the 123-day West Coast dock strike by
compulsory arbitration.
A 79-3 roll-call vote sent the bill to the
House.
The measure provides for termination of the
arbitration proceedings at any time a voluntary
settlement of all issues is certified to the
secretary of Labor by both sides.
"We are still on strike," replied ILWU Local
13 President John Pandora in Los Angeles,
when asked by a newsman when a back-to-work
movement might begin. "We have a caucus call
at 10 a.m. Saturday in San Francisco to discuss
the tentative settlement. It's premature to talk
now about going back to work."
Press Interviews For Davis
SAN JOSE — Santa Clara County Sheriff James
Geary declared yesterday that black
revolutionary Angela Davis will be permitted
press interviews despite earlier claims by her
attorneys that all press interviews had been
banned.

Geary issued a statement saying that media
representatives must file written requests for
interviews and they would be granted "subject
to any orders issued by the court and the
security requirements of the installation." He
said they must be approved by Davis and her
attorneys.
Geary's statement climaxed a hectic morning
during which Davis' attorneys demanded that
Superior Court Judge Richard E. Arnason
cancel an order which they interpreted as
banning all future press interviews.
Arnason said in court that he had vacated a
July 28, 1971 order which had permitted Davis
one media interview each week, but had placed
no restrictions on future interviews.
Deputy County Counsel Byron Athan said
that at the present time he knew of no court
order limiting press interviews with Davis.
Athan said that since pre-trial hearings have
been going on four days a week, only one day
has been available for interviews and Geary
wants to be sure that Davis' health problems are
met and that she receives Drooer pxprricp
Pollution Measures Proposed
WASHINGTON — President Nixon has
proposed his first pollution tax, a levy on the
sulfur emitted from the smokestacks of
factories and power plants.
Administration spokesmen said the tax
would encourage industry to meet regional
air-quality standards that take effect in 1975.
To the extent that they don't, however, the
sulfur tax could be passed on to consumers in
the form of higher prices for electricity and
other products.
The sulfur tax was one of a half-dozen
legislative proposals promised in a special
message on the environment, sent to Congress
yesterday.
Nixon said he will propose a measure
encouraging states to take control of the
location of highways and airports by 1975.
Those which fail to obtain federal approval of
their plans by then would start losing federal

highway and airport construction aid and
land-acquisition money from the Land and
Water Conservation Fund.
Nixon also proposed to discourage the
development of coastal wetlands by removing
the eligibility of projects located on wetlands
from certain tax benefits available to
commercial construction.
Two other proposals would seek to control
the land disposal of toxic wastes and the soil
runoff from construction projects. Each would
rely on state regulation under federal
guidelines.
Packard To Head Campaign
SACRAMENTO - The head of President
Nixon's re-election campaign in the San
Francisco Bay Area will be David Packard,
former deputy defense secretary, Gov. Reagan
announced yesterday.
Packard will be regional chairman for
Nixon's campaign in Alameda, Contra Costa,
Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa
Clara counties, said Reagan, the President's
California campaign chairman.
'Day Of Disruption" Begins
BELFAST — Bombs and gunfire early today
ushered in a "Day of Disruption" staged by
Roman Catholics who want British-ruled
Northern Ireland united with the Irish republic.
An unidentified civilian was killed by
gunmen firing from a speeding car in Belfast's
Catholic Ardoyne district. He was the 240 th
person to die since Ulster erupted into violence
in mid-1969.
Two other civilians were injured in a
midnight bomb blast that smashed windows
and flung shrapnel over a wide area of the same
district. A garage and a truck were wrecked by
two explosions near the border with the Irish
republic, but no casualties were reported.
Police declined comment on speculation that
the bombing in one of Belfast's most heavily
populated Catholic districts could have been
carried out by Protestant hardliners to coincide

with the start of D-for-Disruption Day.
A British army spokesman said 550 extra
troops were being moved into Londonderry in
expectation of trouble during the 24-hour
campaign to disrupt civil life with strikes, sit-ins
and roadblocks.
Prime Minister Brian Faulkner, in an
unyielding address to Parliament Tuesday night,
ruled out any idea of Irish unity as a solution to
the violence and bloodshed that have stricken
the six counties of Protestant-controlled Ulster.
"What we have seen of the Irish republic, we
do not like," he said. "We do not admire the
petulant and bellicose utterances of its public
figures on the world stage."
The prime minister spoke as Northern
Ireland's Protestant majority, anxious to ward
off any weakening in the British fight against
the illegal Irish Republican Army, prepared to
launch an organization to thwart moves toward
a united Ireland.
US Bags First Gold Medal
SAPPORO, Japan — Diane Holum of
Northbrook, 111., flashed to an Olympic record
in the women's 1,500-meter speed skating
sprint today and gave the United States its first
gold medal of the 11th Winter Olympic Games.
The 20-year-old Miss Holum, the teen-age
darling of the U.S. team in the 1968 Games
when she won a silver medal and a bronze, took
the lead about midway in the race, in which the
old Olympic mark was broken five times.
Miss Holum smashed the 1968 mark of 2
minutes, 22.40 seconds by Finland's Kaija
Mustonen with a clocking of 2:20.85 to beat
world record holder Stein Baas-Kaiser of the
Netherlands who was timed in 2:21.05 for the
silver medal.
"Everybody told me that the 1,000 meters
was my best distance, but I knew I could win
this race," said Miss Holum.
The United States also got a seventh place in
the opening race of the women's speed skating
program, from Connie Carpenter of Madison,
Wis.

Those which fail to obtain federal approval of
their plans by then would start losing federal

highway and airport construction aid and
land-acquisition money from the Land and
Water Conservation Fund.
Nixon also proposed to discourage the
development of coastal wetlands by removing
the eligibility of projects located on wetlands
from certain tax benefits available to
commercial construction.
Two other proposals would seek to control
the land disposal of toxic wastes and the soil
runoff from construction projects. Each would
rely on state regulation under federal
guidelines.
Packard To Head Campaign
SACRAMENTO - The head of President
Nixon's re-election campaign in the San
Francisco Bay Area will be David Packard,
former deputy defense secretary, Gov. Reagan
announced yesterday.
Packard will be regional chairman for
Nixon's campaign in Alameda, Contra Costa,
Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa
Clara counties, said Reagan, the President's
California campaign chairman.
'Day Of Disruption" Begins
BELFAST — Bombs and gunfire early today
ushered in a "Day of Disruption" staged by
Roman Catholics who want British-ruled
Northern Ireland united with the Irish republic.
An unidentified civilian was killed by
gunmen firing from a speeding car in Belfast's
Catholic Ardoyne district. He was the 240 th
person to die since Ulster erupted into violence
in mid-1969.
Two other civilians were injured in a
midnight bomb blast that smashed windows
and flung shrapnel over a wide area of the same
district. A garage and a truck were wrecked by
two explosions near the border with the Irish
republic, but no casualties were reported.
Police declined comment on speculation that
the bombing in one of Belfast's most heavily
populated Catholic districts could have been
carried out by Protestant hardliners to coincide

with the start of D-for-Disruption Day.
A British army spokesman said 550 extra
troops were being moved into Londonderry in
expectation of trouble during the 24-hour
campaign to disrupt civil life with strikes, sit-ins
and roadblocks.
Prime Minister Brian Faulkner, in an
unyielding address to Parliament Tuesday night,
ruled out any idea of Irish unity as a solution to
the violence and bloodshed that have stricken
the six counties of Protestant-controlled Ulster.
"What we have seen of the Irish republic, we
do not like," he said. "We do not admire the
petulant and bellicose utterances of its public
figures on the world stage."
The prime minister spoke as Northern
Ireland's Protestant majority, anxious to ward
off any weakening in the British fight against
the illegal Irish Republican Army, prepared to
launch an organization to thwart moves toward
a united Ireland.
US Bags First Gold Medal
SAPPORO, Japan — Diane Holum of
Northbrook, 111., flashed to an Olympic record
in the women's 1,500-meter speed skating
sprint today and gave the United States its first
gold medal of the 11th Winter Olympic Games.
The 20-year-old Miss Holum, the teen-age
darling of the U.S. team in the 1968 Games
when she won a silver medal and a bronze, took
the lead about midway in the race, in which the
old Olympic mark was broken five times.
Miss Holum smashed the 1968 mark of 2
minutes, 22.40 seconds by Finland's Kaija
Mustonen with a clocking of 2:20.85 to beat
world record holder Stein Baas-Kaiser of the
Netherlands who was timed in 2:21.05 for the
silver medal.
"Everybody told me that the 1,000 meters
was my best distance, but I knew I could win
this race," said Miss Holum.
The United States also got a seventh place in
the opening race of the women's speed skating
program, from Connie Carpenter of Madison,
Wis.
Dock Strike Agreement
SAN FRANCISCO — Longshoremen and
shippers reached tentative agreement yesterday
to end the crippling 123-day-old West Coast
dock strike.
The settlement will be submitted to a
committee representing locals of the
International Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen's Union and to individual
shippers, said private mediator Sam Kagel.
The committee would set the date of a
membership ratification vote and decide it
there would be a return to work pending a vote,
said Kagel. The committee will meet here Feb.
12.
"I am authorized to announce that the
ILWU and PMA negotiating committees
reached agreement on all economic issues,"
Kagel told a news conference. "Certain specific
non-economic issues will be mediated and if
necessary arbitrated by me," he said.
Despite a tentative voluntary agreement in
negotiations, the Senate voted Tuesday to end
the 123-day West Coast dock strike by
compulsory arbitration.
A 79-3 roll-call vote sent the bill to the
House.
The measure provides for termination of the
arbitration proceedings at any time a voluntary
settlement of all issues is certified to the
secretary of Labor by both sides.
"We are still on strike," replied ILWU Local
13 President John Pandora in Los Angeles,
when asked by a newsman when a back-to-work
movement might begin. "We have a caucus call
at 10 a.m. Saturday in San Francisco to discuss
the tentative settlement. It's premature to talk
now about going back to work."
Press Interviews For Davis
SAN JOSE — Santa Clara County Sheriff James
Geary declared yesterday that black
revolutionary Angela Davis will be permitted
press interviews despite earlier claims by her
attorneys that all press interviews had been
banned.

Geary issued a statement saying that media
representatives must file written requests for
interviews and they would be granted "subject
to any orders issued by the court and the
security requirements of the installation." He
said they must be approved by Davis and her
attorneys.
Geary's statement climaxed a hectic morning
during which Davis' attorneys demanded that
Superior Court Judge Richard E. Arnason
cancel an order which they interpreted as
banning all future press interviews.
Arnason said in court that he had vacated a
July 28, 1971 order which had permitted Davis
one media interview each week, but had placed
no restrictions on future interviews.
Deputy County Counsel Byron Athan said
that at the present time he knew of no court
order limiting press interviews with Davis.
Athan said that since pre-trial hearings have
been going on four days a week, only one day
has been available for interviews and Geary
wants to be sure that Davis' health problems are
met and that she receives Drooer pxprricp
Pollution Measures Proposed
WASHINGTON — President Nixon has
proposed his first pollution tax, a levy on the
sulfur emitted from the smokestacks of
factories and power plants.
Administration spokesmen said the tax
would encourage industry to meet regional
air-quality standards that take effect in 1975.
To the extent that they don't, however, the
sulfur tax could be passed on to consumers in
the form of higher prices for electricity and
other products.
The sulfur tax was one of a half-dozen
legislative proposals promised in a special
message on the environment, sent to Congress
yesterday.
Nixon said he will propose a measure
encouraging states to take control of the
location of highways and airports by 1975.

Dock Strike Agreement
SAN FRANCISCO — Longshoremen and
shippers reached tentative agreement yesterday
to end the crippling 123-day-old West Coast
dock strike.
The settlement will be submitted to a
committee representing locals of the
International Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen's Union and to individual
shippers, said private mediator Sam Kagel.
The committee would set the date of a
membership ratification vote and decide it
there would be a return to work pending a vote,
said Kagel. The committee will meet here Feb.
12.
"I am authorized to announce that the
ILWU and PMA negotiating committees
reached agreement on all economic issues,"
Kagel told a news conference. "Certain specific
non-economic issues will be mediated and if
necessary arbitrated by me," he said.
Despite a tentative voluntary agreement in
negotiations, the Senate voted Tuesday to end
the 123-day West Coast dock strike by
compulsory arbitration.
A 79-3 roll-call vote sent the bill to the
House.
The measure provides for termination of the
arbitration proceedings at any time a voluntary
settlement of all issues is certified to the
secretary of Labor by both sides.
"We are still on strike," replied ILWU Local
13 President John Pandora in Los Angeles,
when asked by a newsman when a back-to-work
movement might begin. "We have a caucus call
at 10 a.m. Saturday in San Francisco to discuss
the tentative settlement. It's premature to talk
now about going back to work."
Press Interviews For Davis
SAN JOSE — Santa Clara County Sheriff James
Geary declared yesterday that black
revolutionary Angela Davis will be permitted
press interviews despite earlier claims by her
attorneys that all press interviews had been
banned.

Geary issued a statement saying that media
representatives must file written requests for
interviews and they would be granted "subject
to any orders issued by the court and the
security requirements of the installation." He
said they must be approved by Davis and her
attorneys.
Geary's statement climaxed a hectic morning
during which Davis' attorneys demanded that
Superior Court Judge Richard E. Arnason
cancel an order which they interpreted as
banning all future press interviews.
Arnason said in court that he had vacated a
July 28, 1971 order which had permitted Davis
one media interview each week, but had placed
no restrictions on future interviews.
Deputy County Counsel Byron Athan said
that at the present time he knew of no court
order limiting press interviews with Davis.
Athan said that since pre-trial hearings have
been going on four days a week, only one day
has been available for interviews and Geary
wants to be sure that Davis' health problems are
met and that she receives Drooer pxprricp
Pollution Measures Proposed
WASHINGTON — President Nixon has
proposed his first pollution tax, a levy on the
sulfur emitted from the smokestacks of
factories and power plants.
Administration spokesmen said the tax
would encourage industry to meet regional
air-quality standards that take effect in 1975.
To the extent that they don't, however, the
sulfur tax could be passed on to consumers in
the form of higher prices for electricity and
other products.
The sulfur tax was one of a half-dozen
legislative proposals promised in a special
message on the environment, sent to Congress
yesterday.
Nixon said he will propose a measure
encouraging states to take control of the
location of highways and airports by 1975.
Those which fail to obtain federal approval of
their plans by then would start losing federal

highway and airport construction aid and
land-acquisition money from the Land and
Water Conservation Fund.
Nixon also proposed to discourage the
development of coastal wetlands by removing
the eligibility of projects located on wetlands
from certain tax benefits available to
commercial construction.
Two other proposals would seek to control
the land disposal of toxic wastes and the soil
runoff from construction projects. Each would
rely on state regulation under federal
guidelines.
Packard To Head Campaign
SACRAMENTO - The head of President
Nixon's re-election campaign in the San
Francisco Bay Area will be David Packard,
former deputy defense secretary, Gov. Reagan
announced yesterday.
Packard will be regional chairman for
Nixon's campaign in Alameda, Contra Costa,
Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa
Clara counties, said Reagan, the President's
California campaign chairman.
'Day Of Disruption" Begins
BELFAST — Bombs and gunfire early today
ushered in a "Day of Disruption" staged by
Roman Catholics who want British-ruled
Northern Ireland united with the Irish republic.
An unidentified civilian was killed by
gunmen firing from a speeding car in Belfast's
Catholic Ardoyne district. He was the 240 th
person to die since Ulster erupted into violence
in mid-1969.
Two other civilians were injured in a
midnight bomb blast that smashed windows
and flung shrapnel over a wide area of the same
district. A garage and a truck were wrecked by
two explosions near the border with the Irish
republic, but no casualties were reported.
Police declined comment on speculation that
the bombing in one of Belfast's most heavily
populated Catholic districts could have been
carried out by Protestant hardliners to coincide

with the start of D-for-Disruption Day.
A British army spokesman said 550 extra
troops were being moved into Londonderry in
expectation of trouble during the 24-hour
campaign to disrupt civil life with strikes, sit-ins
and roadblocks.
Prime Minister Brian Faulkner, in an
unyielding address to Parliament Tuesday night,
ruled out any idea of Irish unity as a solution to
the violence and bloodshed that have stricken
the six counties of Protestant-controlled Ulster.
"What we have seen of the Irish republic, we
do not like," he said. "We do not admire the
petulant and bellicose utterances of its public
figures on the world stage."
The prime minister spoke as Northern
Ireland's Protestant majority, anxious to ward
off any weakening in the British fight against
the illegal Irish Republican Army, prepared to
launch an organization to thwart moves toward
a united Ireland.
US Bags First Gold Medal
SAPPORO, Japan — Diane Holum of
Northbrook, 111., flashed to an Olympic record
in the women's 1,500-meter speed skating
sprint today and gave the United States its first
gold medal of the 11th Winter Olympic Games.
The 20-year-old Miss Holum, the teen-age
darling of the U.S. team in the 1968 Games
when she won a silver medal and a bronze, took
the lead about midway in the race, in which the
old Olympic mark was broken five times.
Miss Holum smashed the 1968 mark of 2
minutes, 22.40 seconds by Finland's Kaija
Mustonen with a clocking of 2:20.85 to beat
world record holder Stein Baas-Kaiser of the
