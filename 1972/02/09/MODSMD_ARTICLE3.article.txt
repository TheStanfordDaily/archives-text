# Faculty Petition Supports Advisory Board Members
## 
### 
More than 200 faculty members
signed a statement condemning
personal attacks on the Advisory
Board, and pledging over $5,000
dollars for information leading to the
arrest and conviction of those
responsible for placing a fire bomb
outside the campus home of Sanford
Dornbusch.
The group, which includes more
than one fifth of the Academic
Council, also pledged "through our
words and actions to change the
atmosphere which has bred such
mindless personal attacks on our
colleagues." The attacks which they
.aid, "have escalated from verbal abuse
to midnight bombing."
The faculty statement, which was
signed by professors of diverse
Dolitical persuasions, praises the seven

Advisory Board members as having
"rendered extraordinary service."
"Some of us agree with the
majority decision in the Franklin
case;" it goes on, "some of us do not.
But we all recognize that these men
have carried the thankless burden of
decision for us. It is time to consider
what we owe them."
Professor Richard Scott, who
helped organize the petition, said the
Academic Council has no specific
plans to accomplish this goal. He said
he hopes the petition will bring the
faculty's attention to a joint effort to
stop the attacks which, he said,
include the Dornbusch incident,
columns in the press challenging the
motives of Advisory Board members
and disruptions of the members'
classes.
