# From Prince Lightfoot
## Indian Mascot Receives Support 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Although 55 native Americans here
have asked for abandonment of the
Stanford "Indian" mascot, one
Stanford Indian definitely thinks the
name should be kept.
That's Timm Williams, who has
performed as "Prince Lightfoot" at
football games for the past 20 years.
Williams, 48, and a full blooded
Yurok Indian, feels the Indian mascot
is an "honor" because it stands for the
supposed "fair play, strength, and
athletic prowess" of the red man.
In their criticism of the Indian
mascot, the native Americans have
called Lightfoot's performances
"degrading." They say Lightfoot's
dances and costumes are
pseudo-traditional and make a
"mockery" of real Indian traditions.
But Lightfoot says, "You can't
degrade anybody but yourself and I
have never allowed Prince Lightfoot to
act in a manner degrading to Indian
people."
Concerning the charge that his dress
and dance are not authentic, Lightfoot
says "that's their interpretation. When
I do them I feel they're authentic and
I'm a real Indian."
Dance Performed
Williams says he has done his dance

in costume at pow-wows of the
Montana and Sioux and that these
tribes have thoroughly enjoyed them.
"In my 20 years as Prince Lightfoot
I've never been criticized for degrading
Indians," he says.
"My position as an Indian has been
taken lightly," Williams claims. "They
seem to be saying I'm not a real
Indian."
He recalls having acid poured on his
clothing and being beaten up in high
school just for being an Indian. He also
remembers how his father died: He
quit eating after the Government
confiscated his land.
"You've got to fight for Indians
any way you can," he says, and feels
Prince Lightfoot is part of that fight.
While the native American petition
charged that Lightfoot's performances
and the Indian mascot obscure Indian
socio-economic problems, Williams
feels that the two do just the opposite
by focusing attention on the Indian.
Roles Compared
Williams feels his role is comparable
to that of Indians Buffie St. Marie and
Johnny Cash who through their
entertainment bring attention to
Indians. "The difference is that they
do it by singing and I do it by
dancing," he says.

Williams is also deeply involved
politically in Indian affairs. He is the
elected tribal leader of 3,400 Klamath
River Yuroks, Chairman of the
California Rural Indian Health Board
and director of the California Indian
Assistance Project. "I haven't had a
day off since January 2," Williams
says.
In his contact with Indians Williams
says he has found that most like being
the Stanford mascot. He says that 10
to 15 Indian communities are getting
up petitions calling for Stanford to
retain the symbol and adds that many
Indians have said they were willing to
come and testify that the symbol
should be retained.
Caution Urged
"I just hope the administration and
students wait to make their decision

until they've heard from what I
consider to be the Indian voice on the
outside," he says.
Assistant to the President Bill Stone
says he has received a substantial
amount of mail concerning the
proposed mascot change and that most
has been in favor of retaining the
Indian symbol. He adds that several of
these letters have come from Indian
alumni.
Stone also said that because
President Lyman has been tied up with
Trustee meetings, he has not yet had a
chance to look at Ombudsman Lois
Amsterdam's recommendation that
the mascot be changed.
He added that before any final
decision was made there would be an
opportunity for input from interested
parties.
