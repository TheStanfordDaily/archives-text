# Placement Center Demonstration Set
## 
### 
Last night at a meeting in
Columbae House, members of the
Stanford community planned a
non-violent sit-in, scheduled to begin
at 8:30 this morning at the Placement
Center. Demonstrators plan to
confront Navy recruiters.
A hunger fast, aimed at bringing
about a public meeting between
President Lyman and the community,
and moratoria on war-related
recruiting and campus judicial
proceedings, was also planned.
According to the organizers, these
tactics have been formulated to
emphasize "non-violent direct action."
The community members made
plans to occupy the Placement Center.
If police arrive, the plans are for only
two protesters to remain in the
building. Plans call for these two
"greeters" to engage in "rational
discourse" inside the building until
they are arrested.
The hunger strike is in support of
three demands: 1) a public meeting

between Lyman and the Stanford
community; 2) a moratorium on
recruiting by the military and
corporations producing
"anti-personnel weapons or holding
over $100 million in military
contracts"; 3) a moratorium on
campus judicial proceedings until a
judicial system is authorized by a
"binding vote of those individuals
under its jurisdiction."
Radical student leader Kwonping
Ho told the Daily Lot night that he is
being charged by th n Campus Judicial
Panel with disrupting the January 18
class of Engineering Professor William
Shockley.
Ho said that former ASSU elections
commissioner Alice Furumoto and
Don Lee, one of the so-cÂ£.lled
"Placement Center 4," have also been
charged, and that the hearing has been
set for 8:30 a.m. .Viondav at Memorial
Auditorium. CJF chairman John
Kaplan has designated Henry Ramsey
as hearing officer.
