# BSU Election
## 
### 
The Black Students Union elected
Charles Ogletree as chairman at a
meeting last night in Roble Hail.
Ogletree, a freshman from Merced,
California, is head of the Stanford
Students for the Defense of Angela
Davis and All Political Prisoners.
Following his election, Ogletree
said, "My ultimate goal is to continue
all the activities the BSU has stressed ."
Ogletree said there were many
obstacles to this, such as students no
longer giving money to the BSU
through ASSU fees. But he said this
was a "positive attack" on the BSU

since "it only alerts us to the fact of
racism on this campus."
Ogletree also said the BSU as a
"very functional group" would soon
become evident because "we are going
to move." Ogletree said they were
planning a response to an incident
involving Electrical Engineering
Professor William Shockley and a
black student as well as to other
"actions of overt racism on the
campus."
Ogletree also stressed that his
actions as chairman would reflect what
black students were thinking.
