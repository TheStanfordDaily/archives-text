## Terrorist Attack 
### 
Late one night last week a molotov cocktail fire
bomb was found at the rear door of the home of
Advisory Board member Sanford Dombusch. The
triggering device on the bomb failed and the
Dornbusch house and family escaped injury.
Although it is fairly clear that the firebombing
attempt has some relation to the Advisory Board's
decision to fire H. Bruce Franklin, the full reasoning
behind the attempt is uncertain.
Three theories have been advanced to explain the
act: that it was a real attempt to destroy the house
and attack its occupants; that it was merely an
attempt to scare Dornbusch and his family and was
never intended to do any actual damage; that it was

an attempt by some right-wing zealot who is trying
to throw suspicion upon the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement.
But it is immaterial who was responsible lor the
attempted bombing; it is unnecessary to withhold
judgment until we determine who was the
perpetrator of this useless violence. No matter how
one may feel about the proper types of
confrontation with an institution, this kind of
attack on an individual is clearly useless to anyone's
ends. Political aims, no matter how noble or ignoble
one may consider them, cannot be held to justify a
terrorist attack of this kind.
