## False Belief Aids Shockley 
### 
I hope that Professors of
Biology, Psychology and
Education will have been outraged
enough by the paid advertisement
''Professor's Shockley's
Views...." (Daily, Feb. 2) to
write columns of their own. They
are, after all, more qualifited than
I to refute Shockley's position.
But Professors are busy men,
and often do not have time to
fight racism. So I will try my best
to explain what I have learned in
their classes.
Shockley refers to a
vvidely-held, false belief: The least
"intelligent" (i.e. the poor, people

of color, etc.) have the most
children. Isn't it obvious? Average
family size of these people is
larger than that of middle and
upper classes.
Actually, in our society, the
more well-to-do are the most
prolific. The fallacy of the above
argument is that it fails to look at
the percentage of adults who
actually have children. Among the
poor, this percentage is low
enough to more than make up for
the larger family size of those who
reproduce.
That could be called a quibble.
But how can anyone read
Shockley's "inescapable"
conclusion from his research that
"Nature has color-coded groups of

individuals so that statistically
reliable predictions of their
adaptability to intellectually
rewarding and effective lives can
easily be made and profitably be
used by the pragmatic man in the
street" and doubt the racist
implications of Shockley's
writings? He is saying, simply and
clearly, that skin pigment is
Nature's way of telling the man
on the street to expect black men
to be dull and shiftless.
Professor Shockley claims his
work is motivated by concern for
the feelings of all involved." The
murders of the Spanish
Inquisition had equally good
intentions. They hoped to save
the souls of the Jews they
tortured and burned. Good
intentions do not justify
Shockley's 'thinking exercises'.
How many newspapers across
our nation ran this advertisement?
How many people were
influenced by its unscientific,
racist viewpoint? It is obvious that
one such advertisement produces
more suffering and more (day I
say it?) violence than Bruce
Franklin could have if he had
taught at Stanford till his
retirement.
We must examine the standards
of "service to the University"
which allow Shockley to continue
using the title "Stanford
Professor" to dignify his views
while expelling Bruce Franklin.
