Send the love potion
that never fails.
This big, bright bouquet of 1/ less thjn
freshly-cut flowers and Valen- mJm
tine trimmings is imaginatively - ,-tfjgESsx
blended in a beautiful ceramic
bowl of world-famous Haeger Pottery. Order
a Loveßundle early so that it can work its magic
all week. Vou can send one almost anywhere by
simply contacting your nearby FTD Florist. (Hint! He
can send candy with your flowers, too.)
But start plotting now. Valentine's Day is Monday.
The FTD Loveßundle.
