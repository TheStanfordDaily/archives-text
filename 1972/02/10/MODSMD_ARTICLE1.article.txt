# 65 Block Navy Recruiter From Placement Center
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
About 65 demonstrators
successfully blocked a United States
Navy recruiter from entering the
Placement Center yesterday morning.
Lt. (j.g.) Kenneth Santoro, a Navy
pilot stationed at the Alameda Naval
Air Station, left the campus after
spokesman Dave Josephson of
Columbae House confirmed that
Santoro would be "physically
restrained" from recruiting here.
A similar action is planned for 8:15
a.m. this morning, when Santoro is
again scheduled to conduct interviews
with students interested in a naval
aviation career.
After his entrance was blocked at
9:35 a.m., Santoro held a brief
discussion with the demonstrators,
refused an offer of a police escort into
the building from Lt. Don Tamm of
the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Office, and left.
Free Forum
During his discussion with the
group, he told Josephson that "I
always thought a campus was a free
forum of ideas." Josephson answered
that, "you are welcome to join us in a
free forum discussion, but you will not
be allowed to conduct your work
here."
Santoro was asked if he was aware
that an ASSU referendum was
approved last year to ban military
recruiters. He replied that Navy
recruiters "usually work right through
the administration," and that the
administration had approved his
appearance here.
He denounced the demonstrators'
action in blocking his entrance as "an
impingement of my freedom of
speech," and as "kind of a fascist
tactic," and suggested that the
students "work this out with your
administration."
Santoro denied that the United
States was guilty of war crimes and
atrocities in Vietnam, stating, "This is
a war, and vou have to accept that
fact."
He said that U.S. involvement was
justified because "their [the South

Vietnamese] government invited us
there in the first place," and drew
hisses from the group when he said
that it is "supposedly a freely elected
government."
Escort Refused
He then huddled briefly with
Tamm and Vice Provost Robert M.
Rosenzweig. When he refused Tamm's
offer of a police escort into the
building, he said later that he didn't
want to "create a situation" by
provoking physical confrontation.
After Santoro left, Tamm arrested
two protesters on outstanding
misdemeanor warrants stemming from
two separate incidents.
Kent Hutchings, a non-student, was
arrested on charges of interfering with
an officer, obstructing a public
throughfare, and contributing to the
delinquency of a minor in connection
with an incident behind President
Lyman's office February 3 when a
large trash receptacle was pushed in
the way of a police car. Hutchings was
taken to North County Jail in Palo
Alto, with bail set at $500 cash or
$1,000 bond.
Student Mike Enos was
apprehended and charged with
disturbing the peace, trespassing, and
wearing a mask in the commission of a
misdemeanor for alleged participation
in the February 3 disruption of
Professor William Shockley's class.
Judge James B. O'Grady set bail at the
same rate as for Hutchings.
Grad student Yale Braunstein called
the police tactic of arresting Hutchings
and Enos at the rally "harrassment,"
stating that normal procedure in a
misdemeanor case would be to phone
the two and allow them to turn
themselves in.
Other Warrants
Warrants have also been taken out
for the arrests of Jim Shoch in
connection with the Shockley
disturbance and Timothy Gad us in
connection with the garbage can
incident. Tamm said that both would
be notified by telephone of the
warrants, and would be asked to turn
themselves in.

Tamm did not deny Braunstein's
charge, but said that if there is a
warrant out it is "my duty" to arrest
them.
At a noon rally in White Plaza,
Josephson and about 20 others
announced that they were going on a
hunger strike until a list of three
demands were met by the
administration.
The demands included an
immediate open meeting between
President Lyman and the community,
an end to war recruitment on campus,
and a moratorium on all campus
judicial proceedings until a more
equitable system can be established.
He said that the strikers would
meet once a day at noon on the plaza
to drink fruit juice, and in this way
would show that "we're willing to lay
our lives out until what we consider to
be reasonable demands are met."
He also said that at least one faster
would remain outside Lyman's office
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m every day until
the demands are met.

a.m. this morning, when Santoro is
again scheduled to conduct interviews
with students interested in a naval
aviation career.
After his entrance was blocked at
9:35 a.m., Santoro held a brief
discussion with the demonstrators,
refused an offer of a police escort into
the building from Lt. Don Tamm of
the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Office, and left.
Free Forum
During his discussion with the
group, he told Josephson that "I
always thought a campus was a free
forum of ideas." Josephson answered
that, "you are welcome to join us in a
free forum discussion, but you will not
be allowed to conduct your work
here."
Santoro was asked if he was aware
that an ASSU referendum was
approved last year to ban military
recruiters. He replied that Navy
recruiters "usually work right through
the administration," and that the
administration had approved his
appearance here.
He denounced the demonstrators'
action in blocking his entrance as "an
impingement of my freedom of
speech," and as "kind of a fascist
tactic," and suggested that the
students "work this out with your
administration."
Santoro denied that the United
States was guilty of war crimes and
atrocities in Vietnam, stating, "This is
a war, and vou have to accept that
fact."
He said that U.S. involvement was
justified because "their [the South

Vietnamese] government invited us
there in the first place," and drew
hisses from the group when he said
that it is "supposedly a freely elected
government."
Escort Refused
He then huddled briefly with
Tamm and Vice Provost Robert M.
Rosenzweig. When he refused Tamm's
offer of a police escort into the
building, he said later that he didn't
want to "create a situation" by
provoking physical confrontation.
After Santoro left, Tamm arrested
two protesters on outstanding
misdemeanor warrants stemming from
two separate incidents.
Kent Hutchings, a non-student, was
arrested on charges of interfering with
an officer, obstructing a public
throughfare, and contributing to the
delinquency of a minor in connection
with an incident behind President
Lyman's office February 3 when a
large trash receptacle was pushed in
the way of a police car. Hutchings was
taken to North County Jail in Palo
Alto, with bail set at $500 cash or
$1,000 bond.
Student Mike Enos was
apprehended and charged with
disturbing the peace, trespassing, and
wearing a mask in the commission of a
misdemeanor for alleged participation
in the February 3 disruption of
Professor William Shockley's class.
Judge James B. O'Grady set bail at the
same rate as for Hutchings.
Grad student Yale Braunstein called
the police tactic of arresting Hutchings
and Enos at the rally "harrassment,"
stating that normal procedure in a
misdemeanor case would be to phone
the two and allow them to turn
themselves in.
Other Warrants
Warrants have also been taken out
for the arrests of Jim Shoch in
connection with the Shockley
disturbance and Timothy Gad us in
connection with the garbage can
incident. Tamm said that both would
be notified by telephone of the
warrants, and would be asked to turn
themselves in.

Tamm did not deny Braunstein's
charge, but said that if there is a
warrant out it is "my duty" to arrest
them.
At a noon rally in White Plaza,
Josephson and about 20 others
announced that they were going on a
hunger strike until a list of three
demands were met by the
administration.
The demands included an
immediate open meeting between
President Lyman and the community,
an end to war recruitment on campus,
and a moratorium on all campus
judicial proceedings until a more
equitable system can be established.
He said that the strikers would
meet once a day at noon on the plaza
to drink fruit juice, and in this way
would show that "we're willing to lay
our lives out until what we consider to
be reasonable demands are met."
He also said that at least one faster
would remain outside Lyman's office
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m every day until
the demands are met.

During his discussion with the
group, he told Josephson that "I
always thought a campus was a free
forum of ideas." Josephson answered
that, "you are welcome to join us in a
free forum discussion, but you will not
be allowed to conduct your work
here."
Santoro was asked if he was aware
that an ASSU referendum was
approved last year to ban military
recruiters. He replied that Navy
recruiters "usually work right through
the administration," and that the
administration had approved his
appearance here.
He denounced the demonstrators'
action in blocking his entrance as "an
impingement of my freedom of
speech," and as "kind of a fascist
tactic," and suggested that the
students "work this out with your
administration."
Santoro denied that the United
States was guilty of war crimes and
atrocities in Vietnam, stating, "This is
a war, and vou have to accept that
fact."
He said that U.S. involvement was
justified because "their [the South

Vietnamese] government invited us
there in the first place," and drew
hisses from the group when he said
that it is "supposedly a freely elected
government."
Escort Refused
He then huddled briefly with
Tamm and Vice Provost Robert M.
Rosenzweig. When he refused Tamm's
offer of a police escort into the
building, he said later that he didn't
want to "create a situation" by
provoking physical confrontation.
After Santoro left, Tamm arrested
two protesters on outstanding
misdemeanor warrants stemming from
two separate incidents.
Kent Hutchings, a non-student, was
arrested on charges of interfering with
an officer, obstructing a public
throughfare, and contributing to the
delinquency of a minor in connection
with an incident behind President
Lyman's office February 3 when a
large trash receptacle was pushed in
the way of a police car. Hutchings was
taken to North County Jail in Palo
Alto, with bail set at $500 cash or
$1,000 bond.
Student Mike Enos was
apprehended and charged with
disturbing the peace, trespassing, and
wearing a mask in the commission of a
misdemeanor for alleged participation
in the February 3 disruption of
Professor William Shockley's class.
Judge James B. O'Grady set bail at the
same rate as for Hutchings.
Grad student Yale Braunstein called
the police tactic of arresting Hutchings
and Enos at the rally "harrassment,"
stating that normal procedure in a
misdemeanor case would be to phone
the two and allow them to turn
themselves in.
Other Warrants
Warrants have also been taken out
for the arrests of Jim Shoch in
connection with the Shockley
disturbance and Timothy Gad us in
connection with the garbage can
incident. Tamm said that both would
be notified by telephone of the
warrants, and would be asked to turn
themselves in.

Tamm did not deny Braunstein's
charge, but said that if there is a
warrant out it is "my duty" to arrest
them.
At a noon rally in White Plaza,
Josephson and about 20 others
announced that they were going on a
hunger strike until a list of three
demands were met by the
administration.
The demands included an
immediate open meeting between
President Lyman and the community,
an end to war recruitment on campus,
and a moratorium on all campus
judicial proceedings until a more
equitable system can be established.
He said that the strikers would
meet once a day at noon on the plaza
to drink fruit juice, and in this way
would show that "we're willing to lay
our lives out until what we consider to
be reasonable demands are met."
He also said that at least one faster
would remain outside Lyman's office
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m every day until
the demands are met.
