Editor, THE DAILY:
Even though it went entirely
unreported, one of the most
interesting and revealing events to
occur in the ASSU Senate
happened at last Thursday's
meeting, when James Jefferson,
the chairman, ordered a
photographer from the
conservative newspaper, The
Arena, not to take pictures of the
meeting. The Senate proceeded to
uphold the ruling.
Generally speaking, the Senate
has been characterized, this year

as every other, by the passage of
meaningless symbolic resolutions,
petty bickering, vicious personal
slandering and, in dealing with the
administration, childish tactical
blunders. The saving grace in all
this was that these mistakes were
usually of no real importance, in
fact or in principle. Such was not
the case in this instance however.
The excuse given for this action
by the chairman and those who
supported him in suppressing
freedom of the press was that
their "right" not to have their

pictures taken outweighed the
right of the press to record for the
people to see, the activities of
their elected representatives in
action at a public meeting.
If freedom of the press can be
limited for the trivial reason given
in this case, perhaps other rights,
such as that of free speech by
officeholders, can similarly be
limited. After all, if some have the
"right" not to have their pictures
taken, perhaps 1 have the right not
to hear ridiculous and boring
speeches.

On these grounds, I request
that those who voted to support
the muzzling of the press at the
last Senate meeting respect my
right not to hear their voices, and
refrain forever from speaking in
public. I hope these people will
give my request some serious
consideration, since the entire
community would benefit very
greatly if they agreed to it.
Scott Burke,
Deputy chairman, ASSU Senate
Editor, THE DAILY:
In these troubled days of
modern time, when no matter
where you go there you are, when
the Ship of State appears destined
for destruction upon the rocks of
hate and disenchantment, when
no one is sure anymore whether
or not Moby Dick is a social
disease, how refreshing it would
be to have a nickname for this
illustrious university which
reflected the Stanford geist both
in its embryonic form as well as
its present development.
Our suggestion: The Stanford
University Robber Barons. Now
there's a nickname which aptly
describes Leland Sr. himself as
well as his educational progeny (as
manifested in the Stanford
Industrial Park), and which even
the most unenterprising football
coach could apply to his defensive
secondary.
Why not a campus referendum
to determine this?

If freedom of the press can be
limited for the trivial reason given
in this case, perhaps other rights,
such as that of free speech by
officeholders, can similarly be
limited. After all, if some have the
"right" not to have their pictures
taken, perhaps 1 have the right not
to hear ridiculous and boring
speeches.

On these grounds, I request
that those who voted to support
the muzzling of the press at the
last Senate meeting respect my
right not to hear their voices, and
refrain forever from speaking in
public. I hope these people will
give my request some serious
consideration, since the entire
community would benefit very
greatly if they agreed to it.
Scott Burke,
Deputy chairman, ASSU Senate
Editor, THE DAILY:
In these troubled days of
modern time, when no matter
where you go there you are, when
the Ship of State appears destined
for destruction upon the rocks of
hate and disenchantment, when
no one is sure anymore whether
or not Moby Dick is a social
disease, how refreshing it would
be to have a nickname for this
illustrious university which
reflected the Stanford geist both
in its embryonic form as well as
its present development.
Our suggestion: The Stanford
University Robber Barons. Now
there's a nickname which aptly
describes Leland Sr. himself as
well as his educational progeny (as
manifested in the Stanford
Industrial Park), and which even
the most unenterprising football
coach could apply to his defensive
secondary.
Why not a campus referendum
to determine this?

Editor, THE DAILY:
Even though it went entirely
unreported, one of the most
interesting and revealing events to
occur in the ASSU Senate
happened at last Thursday's
meeting, when James Jefferson,
the chairman, ordered a
photographer from the
conservative newspaper, The
Arena, not to take pictures of the
meeting. The Senate proceeded to
uphold the ruling.
Generally speaking, the Senate
has been characterized, this year

as every other, by the passage of
meaningless symbolic resolutions,
petty bickering, vicious personal
slandering and, in dealing with the
administration, childish tactical
blunders. The saving grace in all
this was that these mistakes were
usually of no real importance, in
fact or in principle. Such was not
the case in this instance however.
The excuse given for this action
by the chairman and those who
supported him in suppressing
freedom of the press was that
their "right" not to have their

pictures taken outweighed the
right of the press to record for the
people to see, the activities of
their elected representatives in
action at a public meeting.
If freedom of the press can be
limited for the trivial reason given
in this case, perhaps other rights,
such as that of free speech by
officeholders, can similarly be
limited. After all, if some have the
"right" not to have their pictures
taken, perhaps 1 have the right not
to hear ridiculous and boring
speeches.

On these grounds, I request
that those who voted to support
the muzzling of the press at the

refrain forever from speaking in
public. I hope these people will
