# Unconstitutional Arrests
## 
### 
Since Monday, Jan. 31, there have been 24 arrests
of people outside the courtroom where Angela
Davis is being tried—arrests of people exercising
their constitutional rights of assembly, people
demonstrating their support of sister Angela, and
people demanding a larger courtroom so Angela can
have a public trial. To date we have paid out
$6,800.00 in bail money.
Using Section 169 of the California Penal Code,
the county Sheriff has announced his intention of
arresting anyone who attempts to assemble or
demonstrate his support for Angela Davis. Section
169 is unconstitutional, and we will challenge it on
different fronts, by exercising our rights, by
exploring the use of a possible Federal court
injunction, and by seeking legislative repeal.
The first Amendment to the Constitution is
unequivocal. Congress shall make no law infringing
upon the rights of freedom of speech, assembly,
thought and the press. Our experience has always
been that the only way to protect a right is to
exercise it. This we have been doing and will
continue to do.
However, we are reasonable and patient. We don't
want to have people arrested for exercising their
constitutional rights, but neither will we give up our
rights because the sheriff has chosen to use an
unconstitutional section of the Penal Code to
prevent a show of support for Angela Davis.
We will give the authorities eleven days from
February 3 to lift the ban and meet other essential
demands of elementary justice. We demand:
1. The illegal ban on lawful protests and
assembly at the court-house be lifted
unconditionally.
2. All charges against the 24 people arrested

Monday, Jan. 31, and Wednesday, Feb. 2, must be
dismissed.
3. The facilities for the people's attendance of
the trial must be greatly expanded—to at least the
equivalent of the press facilities.
4. The fences surrounding Superior Court room
where Angela's trial will be held, must come down.
The photographing of people attending the trial,
including the press, potential jurors and witnesses
must be ended unconditionally.
If the authorities fail to work out these
arrangements which will bring them into concert
with the letter and intent of the constitutional
guarantees of freedom of assembly and a public
trial, then at 10:00 a.m. on Monday, Feb. 14, they
will be confronted with hundreds and even
thousands of people who will peacefully assemble to
demonstrate for their right to demonstrate and for
Angela's right to a fair trial which means in the first
place her release on bail. There will be no more
demonstrations until Feb. 14.
We do not seek to delay, impede or disrupt this
trial. We want the trial to proceed because we
believe that a jury of Angela's peers will free her.
The delays have been and are solely the 112
responsibility of the prosecution and now the
Sheriffs Department and Superior Court Judge
James Scott, who all have systematically denied
Angela her right to a fair trial and are now also
seeking to destroy our constitutional right of
freedom of speech and assembly.
Angela has been illegally held for over 15 months
without bail. We will continue our fight for her
freedom, which is so clearly the fight for our own.

Angela her right to a fair trial and are now also
seeking to destroy our constitutional right of
freedom of speech and assembly.
Angela has been illegally held for over 15 months
without bail. We will continue our fight for her
freedom, which is so clearly the fight for our own.

Since Monday, Jan. 31, there have been 24 arrests
of people outside the courtroom where Angela
Davis is being tried—arrests of people exercising
their constitutional rights of assembly, people
demonstrating their support of sister Angela, and
people demanding a larger courtroom so Angela can
have a public trial. To date we have paid out
$6,800.00 in bail money.
Using Section 169 of the California Penal Code,
the county Sheriff has announced his intention of
arresting anyone who attempts to assemble or
demonstrate his support for Angela Davis. Section
169 is unconstitutional, and we will challenge it on
different fronts, by exercising our rights, by
exploring the use of a possible Federal court
injunction, and by seeking legislative repeal.
The first Amendment to the Constitution is
unequivocal. Congress shall make no law infringing
upon the rights of freedom of speech, assembly,
thought and the press. Our experience has always
been that the only way to protect a right is to
exercise it. This we have been doing and will
continue to do.
However, we are reasonable and patient. We don't
want to have people arrested for exercising their
constitutional rights, but neither will we give up our
rights because the sheriff has chosen to use an
unconstitutional section of the Penal Code to
prevent a show of support for Angela Davis.
We will give the authorities eleven days from
February 3 to lift the ban and meet other essential
demands of elementary justice. We demand:
1. The illegal ban on lawful protests and
assembly at the court-house be lifted
unconditionally.
2. All charges against the 24 people arrested

Monday, Jan. 31, and Wednesday, Feb. 2, must be
dismissed.
3. The facilities for the people's attendance of
the trial must be greatly expanded—to at least the
equivalent of the press facilities.
4. The fences surrounding Superior Court room
where Angela's trial will be held, must come down.
The photographing of people attending the trial,
including the press, potential jurors and witnesses
must be ended unconditionally.
If the authorities fail to work out these
arrangements which will bring them into concert
with the letter and intent of the constitutional
guarantees of freedom of assembly and a public
trial, then at 10:00 a.m. on Monday, Feb. 14, they
will be confronted with hundreds and even
thousands of people who will peacefully assemble to
demonstrate for their right to demonstrate and for
Angela's right to a fair trial which means in the first
place her release on bail. There will be no more
demonstrations until Feb. 14.
We do not seek to delay, impede or disrupt this
trial. We want the trial to proceed because we
believe that a jury of Angela's peers will free her.
The delays have been and are solely the 112
responsibility of the prosecution and now the
Sheriffs Department and Superior Court Judge
James Scott, who all have systematically denied
Angela her right to a fair trial and are now also
seeking to destroy our constitutional right of
