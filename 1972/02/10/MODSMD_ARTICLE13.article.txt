## Band Learning Experience 
### 
jon erickson

After reading your second
letter to Dr. Lyman concerning
the Stanford Band, 1 feel
compelled to write and express
my feelings. Let me preface my
remarks by saying that like
yourself, I too am an alumnus
(8.5.-'65) and have followed with
great interest the developments at
Stanford over the past ten years.
At present, I work in the Palo
Alto area; but more importantly,
in my spare time, I do most of the
camera and sound work for the
Band—so you could say that I
have an "inside view," both of the
Band and of student life and
attitudes, in general.
The first thing I must do, is
explain the operation and nature
of the Stanford Band. For all
intents and purposes, the Band is
run by undergraduates. The
student staff is responsible for all
aspects of the Band operation
except musical arrangements and
funding (covering travel and
uniforms).
Not only is this situation a
great learning experience for the
student staff, but more
importantly, it enables the Band
to be a rather accurate reflection
of the contemporary Stanford
student. The members of the
Band decide what music they
want to play, what show themes
they want to present, and on a
broader scale, what image THEY
want to present.
(Think about it—who decided
the Michigan halftime show?
Judging solely from the music
they played, it definetly was not
someone under the age of 40!)
Now all this is not to say that
the members of the Band and the
student staff have the final say in
what goes on the field; every show
presented is passed by at least two
people in the University
administration: Dr. Arthur Barnes
(Director of Bands) and Chuck
Taylor (Director of Athletics).
Why is Stanford's band run in
this manner? Why not run it like
Michigan, or other schools like
that? And the answer is very
simple: if Stanford tried to
maintain a band in the "Big-Ten"
style, no one would want to join!
They would resent the
authority manifest in the
administration trying to tell them
what they liked to do. They
would abhor any style of band
that even approached "military
precision." And most important,
they would not enjoy (and thus
participate in) any group in which
they did not have something to
say in regards to its operation.
So just who is the Band playing
for . .. or put another way, why

are people in the Band??? The
Band plays first to have a good
time within its own ranks. Second
in importance, it is playing for the
enjoyment of the rest of the
student body and the enjoyment
of other fans, alumni, and the
general public. So if you told a
bandsman that you didn't like the
music or themes of the band, I
think the typical response would
be: "Tough! We did!"
Now, I would like to give you
my replies to the numerous points
of criticism voiced in your original
letter. You seem to feel that the
Band presented a show which was
"extreme left of center". To that
I can only say that either you are
politically on the extreme right
fringe and view anything to the
left of Barry Goldwater as
"Communistic," or you
misunderstood the concern the
Band has for important issues
affecting our national goals.
Problems in the areas of
Women's Liberation, violence on
our streets, questionable ethics on
the part of our politicians, the
economy, glossing-over of issues
by the television media; these
affect us all in one way or
another. To ignore these problems
and hope that they will go away,
manifest irresponsibility of the
first order. The Stanford Band, on
the other hand, brings these issues
before the public in a
light-hearted, satirical manner.
In no way are students (in your
words) "parodying the values on
which the school has been built;"
quite to the contrary, the students
are exemplifying those values to

the highest degree possible by
attempting to improve our society
so that future generations can
prosper and flourish.
Other items you mentioned
included: "several hippies in
psuedo-band uniforms" (must the
members of all bands have short
"crew-cut" and march in
"military-style" uniforms? I say
nol) "someone pulling a wagon
filled with soft drinks in the
middle of the band" (the next
time Stanford goes to the Rose
Bowl, why don't you join the
Band in that 7-mile march? Then I
think you might understand why
we had the foresight to bring
along the refreshments), "very
sloppy formation" (so what!), "a
member of the band with camera
taking pictures" (1 saw a great
number of people in the stands
with cameras taking pictures too).
In conclusion, I must say that
since you are a Stanford graduate
(which usually indicates
something of a gift of intelligence
and insight), I really would have
expected more of you.
Times change, students change,
attitudes change, bands change,
music changes, styles change. If I
may use your line, Mr. Schneider,
I am personally interested in what
you propose to do in the future to
adjust to change, what you
propose to do in the future to
broaden your horizons beyond
the 1950'5, and what you propose
to do in the future to become
aware of the challenges facing this
great university and our great
country.
