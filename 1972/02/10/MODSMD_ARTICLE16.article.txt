# Pollution Test
## 
### 
Today arid tomorrow the
Atlantic Richfield Company's
Clean Air Caravan will be at
Stanford. Arco Technicians will
check automobiles for excessive
pollution by administering a free
emissions test and a carburetor
adjustment, if necessary.
They will also provide a
diagnostic report and answer any
questions. These tests will take
place in the parking lot at the
corner of Campus Drive and
Salvatierra. The Richfield
Company states that 50% of all
vehicles tested in the past needed
an adjustment.
The Clean Air Caravan was
developed by Arco with the idea,
they say, that cleaner engines
will create cleaner skies.
