# Activist Josephson Plays Non-Violent Role
## 
### BOB VINING 
Speaking at noon rallies at
White Plaza, launching into
"rational dialogue" with
University officials at a
demonstration, striking up
choruses of "Solidarity Forever"
as protestors leave the Old Union,
participating in interminable
committee meetings to organize
against an ever-terminating war or
for an officially terminated Bruce
Franklin—ASSU Guest Professor
David Josephson, 26, spends a lot
of time doing what he has done
over and over before.
First appearing at Stanford in
the turbulent Cambodian Spring
of 1970, Josephson helped
organize the nonviolent theme
house, Columbae. Since then he
has directed numerous
nonviolence seminars that receive
University credit, and has assumed
a unique role in the New Left
movement at Stanford.
"One of David's primary things
is to try to draw new people into
the movement," says Third World

Liberation Front spokesman
Kwonping Ho. Ho has been
charged in connection with the
January 24th "visitation" of the
Faculty Club, and last week's
disruption of a class taught by
Engineering Prof. William
Shockley.
Josephson is "sort of like a
father figure," explains Ho. "A
guru—for those who are still into
gurus. He even looks a little like a
father, like Moses."
Six feet tall and marked by a
long, full dark beard, Josephson
drives from his Palo Alto house to
Columbae in a battered Chevrolet
truck. The truck, like the clothes
on his back and virtually every
other material thing he uses, has
been donated to him. The ASSU
Guest Professor draws no salary
from the ASSU or anyone else.
Thus he pays no income tax.
Josephson spent time working
for the Establishment before
turning his energies toward
dismantling it. Transfering from
Corland State University in New

York, he came to Portland State
in Oregon. There he worked with
the American Medical Association
lobby and interned for Gov. Tom
McCall.
In his junior year he began
work with the United Farm
Workers Organizing Committee
and a Portland antiwar group. He
started to investigate written
works on nonviolence—"but only
after I'd done my own thinking
on it first," he says. He began
thinking about nonviolence as it
might relate to draft opposition.
Before undertaking graduate
studies in political philosophy at
Claremont, Josephson spent a
summer writing poetry and fables
("tales"), and hiking on an
Oregon homestead, where his only
companion was a dog.
Vested Interest
He was uninvolved politically
during his stay at Claremont.
"Most of what I did that was
political was ask people why they
were staying in school," he
remembers. Finally there came a

classroom session devoted to
contrasting the political
philosophies of Hubert Humphrey
and Richard Nixon.
Josephson started to tell the
teacher he felt the topic was
absurd, but suddenly he realized
that the teacher controlled his
financial aid. Holding his peace,
he resolved to quit school with
just an M.A.
"I was opting out to someone's
craziness because of my vested
interest," he explains.
Stanford draft counselor Alan
Strain says Josephson can seem
"kind of hard or abrasive," he is
"not given to the trivia and small
talk that most of us spend so
much time with." Strain helped
found the Synergy Foundation,
which solicits contributions to
support Josephson and his
nonviolent projects. "I don't
know anything that his mind is
closed on. It's still not closed and
labeled on nonviolence," Strain
adds.
Even so, Josephson has been
preoccupied with nonviolence for
a long time. Before coming to
Stanford he worked in Palo Alto
with the Institute for the Study of
Nonviolence. In recent Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement (SRM)
activity, Josephson has been
recognized as a leader of an
important faction of the Stanford
community committed to
nonviolence. Working on the
steering and coordinating
committees of SRM, Josephson
has had to deal with members of
the revolutionary organization
Venceremos, which advocates
violent tactics.
Kwonping Ho, also active in
SRM, states Josephson "has tried
very hard to bridge that gap
between nonviolence and
violence," and "certainly
recognizes some good things in
Venceremos." Venceremos
member Don Lee says, "We work
together on the basis of what we
do agree on. When [Josephson]
makes criticisms, he makes them
fairly and openly." Lee is one of

the so-called "Placement Center
4," and has also been charged in
connection with last week's
disruption of Shockley's class.
Concern Over Liberals
"Our greatest struggle," Lee
remarks, "has been to get pacifists
to make specific actions."
Josephson is, Lee submits,
"struggling to understand our
politics—and I don't mean that in
a condescending way."

Josephson has suggested that
Venceremos people—who are
"always at a high level of
activity"- would not tend to
"monopolize" protest activity if
other people would take more
time for the movement, lie
professes to be more concerned
about liberals than about
revolutionaries who advocate
violence.
"At this stage of [the
movement's] development,"
Josephson declares, "the Sandy
Dornbusches are much more
frightening to me, because they
perpetuate a system and call it
something else." Prof. of
Sociology Sanford Dornbusch
voted with the majority on the
Advisory Board, which
recommended firing Assoc.
English Professor Bruce Franklin.
Dornbusch, when contacted by
the Daily, declined to comment
on Josephson.
Josephson says that Franklin,
who advocates violent revolution,
presents "an interesting and
difficult dichotomy for a
revolutionary. If you master the
monster with the same techniques
the monster is using on you—if
you're more effective at
them—then you still possess some
of the monster."
More Friendly
Professor of Religion Robert
McAfee Brown, another Advisory
Board member, notes that
Josephson "can involve people"
who are put off by "another kind
of rhetoric or style." Stanford
police chief Marvin Herrington
observes that Josephson's

manner seems more friendly"
than that of others involved in
campus protest. When Josephson
meets Herri ngton at a
demonstration or disruption, says
the police chief, "he tries to
explain to me just what it is that's
going on."
According to Vice Provost
Robert Rosen/.weig, however, his
own interactions with Josephson
have been so "shrill and

superficial" as to bo useless.
Rosenzweig calls him "a rather
intense person" who "appears to
be among the most influential"
campus leaders. The Vice Provost
cites ASSU Council of Presidents
member Larry Diamond as an
example of "other people who
work more quietly and effectively
over the long run."
At SRM, Columbae, or
community-wide planning
meetings, Josephson repeatedly
refers to the necessity of
preserving a firm, apparent
collection between tactics and
goals. He frequently warns against
getting locked into tactics that
ignore goals, against "getting
caught and sucked into something
we have no control over."
Often he cautions against
getting hung up in confrontations
with the police. "We must figure
out some way to get to the guys
who give the orders, without
getting sidetracked with the
people who just carry them out,"
Josephson counseled last
weekend.
Stop The Administration
Lately he has been particularly
concerned with focusing on
President Lyman. Josephson
maintains Lyman is directly,
personally responsible for the way
police have been employed on
campus, and for a Campus
Judicial Panel which Josephson
claims has no shred of legitimacy.
At recent meetings to plan
nonviolent action, Josephson
continually posed the question:
"How can we do something the
Administration has to stop? So far

it's been us trying to stop
something the Administration is
doing." This reeurring remark
reflects the influence of
Nietzsche. The German
philosopher, Josephson declares,
impressed him with "the
extraordinary necessity of
creating" while simultaneously
going about the business of
destroying a system believed
intolerable.
Kwonping Ho asserts that when
Josephson disagrees with tactics,
"sometimes he doesn't stay in
there and try to change things"
but instead "just drops out."
Two weeks ago, after an
all-afternoon occupation of the
Old Union, Josephson attended a
night meeting where it was
decided that small "affinity
groups" should return
immediately to the Old Union for
a sit-in. Josephson told his affinity
group he felt the tactic unwise,
but abided by the decision.
Visceral Nonviolence
When he reached the Old
Union, no sit-in was underway. A
door had been forced open and
people were milling around in
front of the building, waiting for
polcie to come. Josephson kept
repeating that he didn't "feel
good about this action at all."
Before police appeared inside the
building and the crowd started to
disperse hurriedly, Josephson
already was gathering his affinity
group together to withdraw to
Columbae, "to get centered."
Kwonping Ho, who studied
under Josephson last year, credits
Josephson with a "visceral"
nonviolence that has "a lot more
earthiness" than other people's
brands. Nevertheless, says Ho, "I
don't think David Josephson or
his politics relate to the Third
World." Ho labels Josephson's
constituency "middle-class,
affluent, disillusioned," and cites
"a lack of urgency in his politics."
"He talks of idealist instead of
materialist things. He talks of
building relationships," explains
Ho. "The Third World can't
identify with a commune." But
Josephson is still, Ho says, "trying
to get a grasp of the realities."
Insights at Stanford
Josephson states he is "trying
to introduce nonviolence as not
simply a tactic, but a way of
understanding life," including
economic and political life. His
notion of politics is
all-encompassing, for he holds
that "allthings have social
implications." More important
than the successful resolution of
immediate issues at Stanford, he
maintains, is the development of
an ongoing process to deal with
such problems.
"I deeply believe there's a
significant difference between
knowing something and
embodying it," Josephson says.
"My work at at Stanford brings
insights, but it's useless unless I
can embody them."
"I move too fast to embody
being nonviolent," he tells an
interviewer. "The best I do is not
be violent."
