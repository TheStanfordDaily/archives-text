## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Stanford workers will choose a
union on March 7, Brad Wells of the
National Labor Relations Board office
in San Francisco announced yesterday.
The election date and procedures
were set after a meeting of NLRB
officials, union representatives, and
University administrators yesterday
morning in San Francisco.
There will be four polling places:
the SLAC auditorium foyer, Maples
Pavilion, Medical Center Room Mll4,
and Geology Corner Room 321. The
area will be open at various times Of
the day to accommodate both day and
night shift workers.
Workers will be assigned to a
specific polling place and will need

drivers license or similar identification
in order to vote.
No Appearance
Wells also announced that
Construction General Laborers Local
270 will not appear on the ballot for
the voting unit composed of physical
plant workers, custodial and food
service employees, and others. The
union asked to be removed.
Workers Action Caucus will appear
on that ballot, although the
organization no longer exists and has
not conducted a campaign to win
vites.
The three unions that have made a
bid for the nomination are the
Teamsters, United Stanford

Employees (USE), and California State
Employees Association-Stanford
Employees Association (CSEA-SEA).
Firemen will decide if they want
International Association of Fire
Fighters Local 1-12; police make the
same choice on the Stanford Police
Officers Association.
Leaders Unhappy
Leaders of both the Teamsters and
USE were somewhat unhappy with the
outcome of yesterday's meeting.
Jim Berk, president of USE, was
particularly perturbed that the NLRB
refused to sustain a USE appeal to
place an additional 250 workers on the
voting rolls. "The NLRB says that the
little list of voters is written up by

management [the University], and any
addition of names that we may want
to make has to be approved by
management," he complained.
He said that the University - "not
surprisingly" — refused to cooperate.
But Berk indicated that his union
would urge workers not on the rolls to
vote under protest anyway.
Badly Located
He also said that the polling places
were inconveniently located, and said
that USE had advocated a mobile unit
to act as a polling place.
Keith Stothers, a member of the
Teamsters Stanford Organizational
Committee, also objected to the voting
procedure.
"We didn't get a mail ballot," he
said. A mail ballot is a procedure
where the NLRB mails everyone a
ballot, and they are filled out and
returned. "The University was against
it because the union usually wins on a
mail ballot," he said.
But Stothers admitted: "I don't
believe the NLRB is trying to screw
anybody over or anything .. . they
just want to get this over with."

place an additional 250 workers on the
voting rolls. "The NLRB says that the
little list of voters is written up by

management [the University], and any
addition of names that we may want
to make has to be approved by
management," he complained.
He said that the University - "not
surprisingly" — refused to cooperate.
But Berk indicated that his union
would urge workers not on the rolls to
vote under protest anyway.
Badly Located
He also said that the polling places
were inconveniently located, and said
that USE had advocated a mobile unit
to act as a polling place.
Keith Stothers, a member of the
Teamsters Stanford Organizational
Committee, also objected to the voting
procedure.
"We didn't get a mail ballot," he
said. A mail ballot is a procedure
where the NLRB mails everyone a
ballot, and they are filled out and
returned. "The University was against
it because the union usually wins on a
mail ballot," he said.
But Stothers admitted: "I don't
believe the NLRB is trying to screw
anybody over or anything .. . they
just want to get this over with."
Stanford workers will choose a
union on March 7, Brad Wells of the
National Labor Relations Board office
in San Francisco announced yesterday.
The election date and procedures
were set after a meeting of NLRB
officials, union representatives, and
University administrators yesterday
morning in San Francisco.
There will be four polling places:
the SLAC auditorium foyer, Maples
Pavilion, Medical Center Room Mll4,
and Geology Corner Room 321. The
area will be open at various times Of
the day to accommodate both day and
night shift workers.
Workers will be assigned to a
specific polling place and will need

drivers license or similar identification
in order to vote.
No Appearance
Wells also announced that
Construction General Laborers Local
270 will not appear on the ballot for
the voting unit composed of physical
plant workers, custodial and food
service employees, and others. The
union asked to be removed.
Workers Action Caucus will appear
on that ballot, although the
organization no longer exists and has
not conducted a campaign to win
vites.
The three unions that have made a
bid for the nomination are the
Teamsters, United Stanford

Employees (USE), and California State
Employees Association-Stanford
Employees Association (CSEA-SEA).
Firemen will decide if they want
International Association of Fire
Fighters Local 1-12; police make the
same choice on the Stanford Police
Officers Association.
Leaders Unhappy
Leaders of both the Teamsters and
USE were somewhat unhappy with the
outcome of yesterday's meeting.
Jim Berk, president of USE, was
particularly perturbed that the NLRB
refused to sustain a USE appeal to
place an additional 250 workers on the
voting rolls. "The NLRB says that the
little list of voters is written up by

management [the University], and any
addition of names that we may want
to make has to be approved by
management," he complained.
He said that the University - "not
surprisingly" — refused to cooperate.
But Berk indicated that his union
would urge workers not on the rolls to
