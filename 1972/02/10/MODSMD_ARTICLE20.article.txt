# Grads Slave Hard For Quals
## 
### DAN BRENNER 
If a person wanted to qualify
for the School of Education's
Ph.D program 18 years ago, he
would be faced at the end of his
first year with the untempting
obligation of succeeding at 12
hours of near non-stop testing
covering a scope of encyclopedic
proportions.
But with increasing "student
input" in their own affairs—the
convenient euphemism for
academic agony turned into
suggestions for improvement—the
graduate student has made
qualifying exams something that
he can co-exist with, sort of.
"It's sort of a baptism by
fire—that's as much a reason
behind them as well as to be a
screening device," said Peter
Johansen, a first-year graduate
student in communication.
The Ph.D qualifying
examination, a comprehensive test
usually covering the basic topics
of a discipline, is administered to
graduate students after their third
or fourth quarter. Successful
completion of the quals is a
pre-requisite for further work
toward the degree.
Once Over Lightly
The ostensible purpose of the
examinations is two-fold,
according to Tom Rhue, Assistant
Dean of Graduate Education.
First the examination can be
useful in firmly organizing a
student's thinking in his subject.
In this sense preparing for the test
is a "once over lightly" of the
flotsam and jetsam that constitute
a discipline.
Second the exam has an
evaluative function for the
department. "The department can
evaluate where the student is in
his work, rather than whether
he'll graduate," Rhue notes.
But the specific value of the
examination varies from
department to department and
from school to school. For
example, while the mathematics
qualifying exam is still a fairly
fierce test covering the three basic
areas of the subject, the
psychology department has no

qualifying examination at all.
Instead, a requirement of
successful completion of five of
nine area courses was substituted
for the quals two years ago.
Also the examinations vary in
the scope of questioning. In the
School of Education the
exam—which can be a take home,
open or closed book, or part oral,
part-written— is tailored to the
student with an emphasis on one
specific area of interest. "It's a
diagnostic instrument. It gives us a
real index to the status of the
student's program," Associate
Dean William Iverson of the
Education School notes.
The Communication
Department, in contrast, usually
offers two different area
examinations, one in
methodology, one in the student's
special area of interest. It is a
take-home examination.
Financial Question
While the qualifying
examination has numerous
implicaions for the scholastic
development of the graduate
student, it can also have quite
important financial meaning. 95
percent of the graduate students
in Humanities and Sciences are on
some form of financial aid,
according to the office of
Graduate Awards. The granting of
the awards however is "strictly" a
departmental decision. Failure on
the examination can mean that
those research checks will stop
coming.
"Too much importance is
placed 011 the examination
financially," notes Thomas
Czubiak, a third-year mathematics
Ph.D candidate. With shrinking
appropriations made by Congress
for graduate research, a less than
satisfactory performance on a
departmental qualifying
examination can be a major factor
in bankrupting the efforts of a
would-be doctor of philosophy.
Financial aid to graduate
students—which for instance
accounts for 98% of the funding
of graduate education in the
psychology department—is
presented in two ways. First a

grad student who becomes a
teaching assistant can receive a
tuition stipend from the "staff
benefits pool" and a salary from
the departmental teaching budget.
A graduate researcher can also
receive tuition courtesy of the
"staff benefits pool" and receive a
salary from his research contract.
Nervous Wrecks
So with the continuation of
financial backing dependent on
getting through the quals, the
examinations provide first-year
students with a generous scoop of
anxiety. Phil Garon, a graduate
student who complete his quals in
the department of communication
last month, thinks the exams are
"another initiation rite of
graduate school," which
sometimes can resemble an
endurance test rather than a
learning experience. "It made

nervous wrecks out of us," Garon
recalls, "But I don't know if I
could suggest a better way."
In fact the qualifying
examinations, which have their
historical roots in the oral and
written examinations required for
graduate study at Cambridge
University in can be
more severe in other countries
which maintain a "chamber of
horrors" quality in administering
them.
A graduate student from
Canada notes that exams there are
"very much more severe" than
here.
Not only are the conditions
under which the examinations are
given more easy-going here, he
thinks, but also the topic areas are
far more esoteric and a greater
number of pre-requisite courses
are required before the test.
