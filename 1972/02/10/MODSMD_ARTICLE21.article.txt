## Director Undermines 'Caesar' 
### DOUG ARTHUR 
The Berkeley Repertory Theatre's "Julius Caesar" could have been
a prodigious production had Michael Leibert not made a damning
directorial decision: an unwarranted emphasis upon the chorus of
"the People." This emphasis undermined the artistic integrity of the
show.
At times it seemed as if there were two shows. The main show
being an artistically clear and simple production of the drama,
interrupted at various points by a band of black clothed, white faced
thugs that proceeded to sabotage the entire work. It was especially
distressing since the play began on such a refined artistic level.
1 suppose the director's interpretation of the show influenced his
use of the chorus, although the director's note obscures more than it
clarifies. He says he wanted to emphasize the political nature of man
in the play (what else could you emphasize?), and yet the people are
represented by a faceless horde devoid of politics, or a raison d'etre
for that matter. Indeed, everyone (the actors) seemed to have their
own interpretation of the play, ranging from farce (Mark Anthony) to
tragedy (Brutus) to camp liturgy (the chorus of people.)
Technically Elementary
The Berkeley Repertory Theatre seats about 100 spectators who
face the playing space on three sides. Everything technical about this
production was elementary. Flat-black platforms broke up the stage
and highlighted the actors playing on them. There was one chair.
Nothing else.

The austerity was profound. Actors wore street clothes which
seemed appropriate as there were no sets, or even hand props. All the
props were mimed. Lighting consisted solely of white lights, no colors.
Only the most essential noises were heard on the sound track, such as
the storm. The production was pared down to the essentials.
The technique of a poor theatre in technical terms offers rich
possibilities for the actors, who become more consequential. While the
pacing of the show varied enough to sustain interest, several scenes
were left unfinished directorially.
The most flagrant scenes involved the chorus. After the murder of
Julius Caesar and the confrontation of Mark Antony with the
conspirators, the people start chanting "we will be sat-is-fied." At the
funeral orations, the people are quite vocal and manage to out-shout
Mark Antony's entire speech. After Brutus' great speech, all we hear is
a barrage of yelling so that the play is thrown off balance. 1 was also
irritated by the portrayal of Mark Antony as a cynic, and a rather
flippant one at that.
Directorial Excess
Another directorial excess concerned the drum beats and other
sound cues that intruded frequently in order to beat us over the head
with what we should notice onstage. Whatever expertise the actors
had displayed in creating a scene was negated by this stagey effect.
In most of the other scenes, the blocking worked very well in
illustrating spatially the impact of the language. Never did the
production lapse into sheer discourse. The action was an integral part
of the dialog, and every inch of the playing space was utilized. The
platforms could have been employed more often, especially in the
funeral orations.
One aspect of the play which the production illuminated for me
was the comparison of Julius Caesar and Calpurnia with Brutus and
Portia. The blocking was very similar for these two scenes, which
occur in sequence, and it called attention to the relationships of the
two men with their wives.
The uneveness of the acting was astounding. Due to the fact that
there was considerable potential in the cast, not to mention immense
disparities in the finished product, I tend to fault the director for this.
Even a few rudimentary comments might have helped a character like
Messala, played by Michael Fiske, who spent most of his time
"reacting" (slowly) to what everyone else did or said.
Eloquent Brutus
Henry Hoffman made an eloquent Brutus. His facial expression and
gestures related the brooding, intellectual quality of a man considering
the metaphysics of political power. The combination of a richly
sonorous voice and flawless elocution made his speeches a pleasure to
hear.
At the other extreme was David Coxwell's Mark Antony, who
didn't really speak, but rather dismissed everything he said as if he
were in a hurry to be done with it. His oratory was quick-paced and
strangely dispassionate. What I could hear of his funeral oration was
almost anti-rhetorical. Coxwell certainly has the stature and speaking
ability to carry the role if only he had had some direction.
James Edmondson did an adequate job with Julius Caesar, and
stressed his deafness at several points. Thomas Lynch as Cassius rose
on occasion to become emotionally powerful, as in his quarrel with
Brutus about the importance of honesty. Patricia Bower's (Portia)
idea of passion is to shout her lungs out.
("'Julius Caesar" is performed Tuesday through Friday nights at 8
p.m. and on Saturday at 7 and 9:30 p.m. Tickets are priced at $3 and
$2 (students) on weeknights and $3.75 and $2.75 (students) on

Mark Antony's entire speech. After Brutus' great speech, all we hear is
a barrage of yelling so that the play is thrown off balance. 1 was also
irritated by the portrayal of Mark Antony as a cynic, and a rather
flippant one at that.
Directorial Excess
Another directorial excess concerned the drum beats and other
sound cues that intruded frequently in order to beat us over the head
with what we should notice onstage. Whatever expertise the actors
had displayed in creating a scene was negated by this stagey effect.
In most of the other scenes, the blocking worked very well in
illustrating spatially the impact of the language. Never did the
production lapse into sheer discourse. The action was an integral part
of the dialog, and every inch of the playing space was utilized. The
platforms could have been employed more often, especially in the
funeral orations.
One aspect of the play which the production illuminated for me
was the comparison of Julius Caesar and Calpurnia with Brutus and
Portia. The blocking was very similar for these two scenes, which
occur in sequence, and it called attention to the relationships of the
two men with their wives.
The uneveness of the acting was astounding. Due to the fact that
there was considerable potential in the cast, not to mention immense
disparities in the finished product, I tend to fault the director for this.
Even a few rudimentary comments might have helped a character like
Messala, played by Michael Fiske, who spent most of his time
"reacting" (slowly) to what everyone else did or said.
Eloquent Brutus
Henry Hoffman made an eloquent Brutus. His facial expression and
gestures related the brooding, intellectual quality of a man considering
the metaphysics of political power. The combination of a richly
sonorous voice and flawless elocution made his speeches a pleasure to
hear.
At the other extreme was David Coxwell's Mark Antony, who
didn't really speak, but rather dismissed everything he said as if he
were in a hurry to be done with it. His oratory was quick-paced and
strangely dispassionate. What I could hear of his funeral oration was
almost anti-rhetorical. Coxwell certainly has the stature and speaking
ability to carry the role if only he had had some direction.
James Edmondson did an adequate job with Julius Caesar, and
stressed his deafness at several points. Thomas Lynch as Cassius rose
on occasion to become emotionally powerful, as in his quarrel with
Brutus about the importance of honesty. Patricia Bower's (Portia)
idea of passion is to shout her lungs out.
("'Julius Caesar" is performed Tuesday through Friday nights at 8
p.m. and on Saturday at 7 and 9:30 p.m. Tickets are priced at $3 and
$2 (students) on weeknights and $3.75 and $2.75 (students) on

MR. AND MRS. MACBETH—Jon Finch and Francesca Annis star in the soon-to-be-released Roman
Polanski directed version of Shakespeare's classic tragedy which will be shown in Memorial Auditorium on
Monday night at 7:30 p.m. Admission is free.
The Berkeley Repertory Theatre's "Julius Caesar" could have been
a prodigious production had Michael Leibert not made a damning
directorial decision: an unwarranted emphasis upon the chorus of
"the People." This emphasis undermined the artistic integrity of the
show.
At times it seemed as if there were two shows. The main show
being an artistically clear and simple production of the drama,
interrupted at various points by a band of black clothed, white faced
thugs that proceeded to sabotage the entire work. It was especially
distressing since the play began on such a refined artistic level.
1 suppose the director's interpretation of the show influenced his
use of the chorus, although the director's note obscures more than it
clarifies. He says he wanted to emphasize the political nature of man
in the play (what else could you emphasize?), and yet the people are
represented by a faceless horde devoid of politics, or a raison d'etre
for that matter. Indeed, everyone (the actors) seemed to have their
own interpretation of the play, ranging from farce (Mark Anthony) to
tragedy (Brutus) to camp liturgy (the chorus of people.)
Technically Elementary
The Berkeley Repertory Theatre seats about 100 spectators who
face the playing space on three sides. Everything technical about this
production was elementary. Flat-black platforms broke up the stage
and highlighted the actors playing on them. There was one chair.
Nothing else.

The austerity was profound. Actors wore street clothes which
seemed appropriate as there were no sets, or even hand props. All the
props were mimed. Lighting consisted solely of white lights, no colors.
Only the most essential noises were heard on the sound track, such as
the storm. The production was pared down to the essentials.
The technique of a poor theatre in technical terms offers rich
possibilities for the actors, who become more consequential. While the
pacing of the show varied enough to sustain interest, several scenes
were left unfinished directorially.
The most flagrant scenes involved the chorus. After the murder of
Julius Caesar and the confrontation of Mark Antony with the
conspirators, the people start chanting "we will be sat-is-fied." At the
funeral orations, the people are quite vocal and manage to out-shout
Mark Antony's entire speech. After Brutus' great speech, all we hear is

ability to carry the role if only he had had some direction.
James Edmondson did an adequate job with Julius Caesar, and
stressed his deafness at several points. Thomas Lynch as Cassius rose
on occasion to become emotionally powerful, as in his quarrel with
Brutus about the importance of honesty. Patricia Bower's (Portia)
idea of passion is to shout her lungs out.
("'Julius Caesar" is performed Tuesday through Friday nights at 8
p.m. and on Saturday at 7 and 9:30 p.m. Tickets are priced at $3 and
$2 (students) on weeknights and $3.75 and $2.75 (students) on
