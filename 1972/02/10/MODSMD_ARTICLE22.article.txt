## 'Indians' Takes Wrong Approach 
### JOSEPH FIKSEL 
The Palo Alto Community
Theater is now presenting
"Indians", by Arthur Kopit, a
two-act broadside at the
incredible hypocrisy displayed by
the American people in their
treatment of native Indians.
Rather than offering new
insights into the tragic history of
the Indians, Kopit experiments
with dramatic techniques. The
entire play takes place within the
troubled mind of "Buffalo Bill"
Cody, the glamorous Western hero.
As vignettes of his personal

exploits pass through his
consciousness, Bill becomes
increasingly disturbed by a sense
of guilt and betrayal. Though he
tries to defend his slaughter of the
buffalo, and his vain craving for
public limelight, it becomes
increasingly clear that he was a
feeble accomplice in the
destruction of the Indians, who
were once his friends.
The play begins with a glimpse
of Buffalo Bill's Wild West show.
He comes prancing in on a white
steed, adorned in white buckskins,
waving his hat at his cheering

admirers.
But as he begins to introduce
the show, hidden associations are
triggered off, and he flashes back
to an earlier time, when he was
acting as an intermediary between
the impoverished tribe of Sitting
Bull and a committee of three
senators who had come to hear
its grievances.
Stoic Dignity
This scene forms a basis for
most of the memory-sequences
that follow, and we return to it
several times. The bitterness and
stoic dignity of the Indians is
juxtaposed with the arrogance and
prejudice of their supposed
benefactors, a shop-wom device
that makes me feel as if he's seen
it all before.
Here the accusations are made,
the ironies of violated agreements
are exposed, and the demise of
the Indian nations is finally seen
as inevitable. In his ruthless drive
for wealth and power, the white
man simply crushed and
rationalized away all obstacles,
human or otherwise.
Against this panorama of
oppression, Buffalo Bill plays a
naive, pathetic role. Convinced
that the West is changing, and that
he must adjust to the new ways,
he climbs onto a bandwagon
which he only dimly understands.
Bumbling Efforts
His bumbling efforts to make

the Indians appreciate the
necessity of change are
compromised by his ambition and
desire for glory, and this
culminates in both ethnic and
personal tragedy. Sitting Bull and
his tribe are ultimately massacred,
and the play closes with Buffalo
Bill turning to the audience in a
last desperate cry for absolution.
His one greatest fear was that
he might die in his Wild West
Show arena, with his make-up on.
Poor Buffalo Bill was never even
able to get his make-up off.
Although the serious portions
of the play tend to be
heavy-handed and over-explicit,
some of the lighter scenes are
entertainingly creative. The use of
nightmarish, elongated cowboy
figures (actors on stilts)
emphasizes the distortions of
Bill's fantasy, giving visual
substance to the thematic
conception of the mind-stage.
One of the cleverest scenes
revived the common device of a
"play within a play", with some
humorous twists. Ned Buntline,
an opportunistic writer, has
conceived a playlet called "Scouts
of the Plains", ana has persuaded
Wild Bill Hickock and Buffalo Bill
to appear as themselves in a
private performance at the White
House.
Art Bodner as Wild Bill Hickock
gives an outstanding cameo
interpretation of the earthy
frontiersman rebelling against the
play's insipid falseness, which he
labels "dude-lickin' sissy-shit". He
finally knifes Buntline and rapes
the actress who was portraying an
Indian maiden, to the lascivious
delight of the President and his
First Lady.
Unfortunately, the blocking
and pace of "Indians" is clumsy.

A community theatre simply does
not have the stage equipment to
achieve a "hallucinatory mosaic"
effect, as Kopit intended; instead
of dissolving into one another, the
scenes are divided by
monotonous, distracting (japs.
Thus, as a historical
commentary, "Indians" does little
more than sling mud at an already
well-soiled record. As a surreal
psychological drama, it is more
successful, but Buffalo Bill is too
cardboard a character for us to
really experience the agony of his
cop-out. I would much rather
have climbed inside the head of
one of those beautiful, tormented
Indians.
("Indians"is performed on Friday
and Saturday nights at 8:30 p.m.
and tickets are priced at $2 and
$1.50 (students under 19). The
Palo Alto Community Theater is
