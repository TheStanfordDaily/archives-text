# Opera: Sublime Or Ridiculous?
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
(Second in a two-part series)
Opera is absurd, unreal,
irrational. Most denigrators of
opera have a flawless sense of this
perfectly obvious fact. How best
to confront it, that is the
question. I have concluded that
the best I can do is plead for (1)
patience with the problems of
producing opera and (2) respect
for the awesome power opera can
exert when created through genius
and performed well.
The criticism of unreality in art
is not new. Aristotle, defending
epic poetry in his "Poetics" from
the charge of improbability,
concluded that "we must accept it
in spite of absurdity .... As it is,
the absurdity is veiled by the
poetic charm with which the poet
invests it."
Saying that good poetry is
merely the art of telling lies
skillfully, Aristotle was simply
making unreality a part of his
definition of poetry. It is part of
the definition of opera, too. By all
odds, using Aristotle's phrase,
opera is the really Big Lie of the

art world, the one which requires
the most skill to tell and against
whose believability the odds are
stacked most heavily.
So opera is indeed absurd, a
fact even defenders of opera
gracefully admit. "The absurdity
of opera," Bertolt Brecht wrote,
"lies in the fact that rational
elements are used and
three-dimensional reality is aimed
at while at the same time
everything is neutralized by the
music. A dying man is real. If he
sings at the same time, we have
reached the sphere of absurdity."
Now, the response to this state
of affairs separates the
opera-lovers from the
opera-haters. Christoph Wieland
made the issue between them
clear in 1775:
People whom nature seems
to have endowed with more
cold reason than feeling and
musical taste have called
unnatural the feature that
makes opera what it is, and
that solely because they reject
the whole genre as something

altogether absurd and
incapable of being truly
imitative.
The unique feature Wieland refers
to is the "language of music,"
which in opera combines with the
language of speech and motion.
The Supreme Art
Which brings me to my main
thesis about opera, namely, that it
is the most complex,
multi-faceted, and therefore most
demanding of all art-forms. Just as
the capabilities of one sitting at
the console of a fully-ranked
organ exceed those of one seated
at an upright piano, so do the
complexities and potentialities of
opera exceed mere drama, mere
symphony, mere ballet, mere
architecture. Opera is, like the
organ, harder to perform, more
costly to produce, more
magnificent to hear. The organ is
the king of instruments. Opera
reigns supreme among the arts.
Opera demands much of the
listener-far more effort, alas,
than most listeners are able or
willing to exert. If one thinks of a

contract between the artist and
the person experiencing the art,
then the contract for opera surely
contains the most clauses, the
most intricate requirements of
knowledge and open-mindedness.
The viewer can hardly come to
opera ill-equipped: he should have
some knowledge of many
languages, various historical
periods, standards to judge dance,
sensitivity to theatrical nuances,
ideas about perspective,
knowledge of musical styles.
During the performance he must
watch assiduously for action in
the orchestra as well as on stage
and somehow appreciate them as
a unity.
Now this encompassing
complexity of opera, the source
of its great power, is also the
source of its vulnerability.
Consider the forces which militate
against the simultaneous
concatenation of a powerful idea
or ideal embedded in a brilliant
libretto vitalized by imaginative,
effective and affecting music, sung
by gifted singers who know how
to project beautiful tones and
vivid characters, to the
accompaniment of a note-perfect
orchestra under the leadership of
a conductor with the brain-power
to mold a complete musical
entity, coordinated on stage by a
perceptive director, all against the
background of an aptly lighted
and intelligent stage design.
Breathtaking. The odds against
such a crowning perfection,
dependent upon so many
variables, are staggering. Still, they
are overcome more frequently
than one might think.
Inept Opera
I am certainly not interested in
excusing ineptitude of intellect or
execution, which result in insults
to the viewer as well as to the
opera itself. Opera can be awful,
but even in its failures opera is a
most fascinating art. Opera can be
teeth-grindingly, seat-squirmingly
terrible. It can be hilariously or
pathetically bad. An atrocious
performance can leave one with a
whimsical mood or with the urge
to maim. Sometimes the only
reward is profound depression and
a $12 ticket stub.
But rare is the opera that
manages to fail in all respects;
indeed, I treasure those few
perfect failures which I have had
the luck to see: the power to
trample aesthetic sensibilities in so
many ways at once demands a
special kind of reverance! There is
usually something to admire and
enjoy in an opera, for it is one of
the nice things about this art that
one aspect can be thoroughly
successful while another is
foundering helplessly. The
sensitive opera-goer gradually
develops the ability to isolate and
ignore the bad and concentrate on

the good, though he may do so
grudgingly.
On the other hand, when all of
the constituencies of opera work
together to achieve a powerful
effect, when the execution is
perfect, when everyone is using
his brains, nothing can surpass
opera. This results (I am speaking
of my own experience now) in
supremely affecting experiences,
moments which have refurbished
the soul or the brain in ways not
possible in other art-forms,
moments which I cannot recall
without raising gooseflesh,
moments in which were created,
in Shakespeare's words, most
majestic visions.
However, the mere expression
of this kind of experience is pallid
at best and, I think, a highly
suspect way of arguing for opera.
One can listen indifferently to
stories of ESP, but to become
enthusiastic, to catch the tell-tale
gleam in the eye of true belief,
one must experience it. The same
is true of opera: let a person live
through such an experience in the
opera house, and all Aida's
elephants, all of the gold of
Wagner's Nibelungs, or all of
Mephisto's promises will not tear
him away from opera.
The power of opera is in the
combination of music and
experience. By way of closing I
would like to share a statement of
this unique power which I don't
think can be surpassed for
aptness, persuasiveness, and
charm. It is from James Harris'
"Discourse on Music, Painting and
Poetry" written in 1744. It
provides a fitting gathering
together of the issues I have raised
and ends in a spiritual vein, which
is finally the only way one can
express an appreciation of art.
Harris's punctuation and emphasis
have been retained:
And hence the genuine Charm
of Music, and the Wonders which
it works, thro'its gi'eat Professors.
A power, which consists not in
Imitations, and the raising of
Ideas; but, in the raising
Affections, to which Ideas may
correspond. There are few to be
found so insensible, I may say so
inhumane, as when good Poetry is
justly set to Music, not in some
degree to feel the Force

irresistible of so amiable a Union.
For to the Muses Friends it is a
Force irresistible, and penetrates
into the deepest Recesses of the
Soul.
Now this is that Source, from
whence Music was said formerly
to derive its greatest Efficacy. . . .
On this account also it has been
called a powerful Ally to
Reasoning, that the Objection is
solved, which is raised against the
Singing of Poetry (as in Operas,
Oratorios, etc.) from the want of
Probability and Resemblance to
Nature, to one indeed, who has no
musical Ear, this Objection may
have weight. It may even perplex
a Lover of Music, if it happen to
surprise him in his Hours of
Indifference. But when he is
feeling the Charm of Poetry so
accompanied, let him be angry (if
he can) with that which serves
only to interest him more
feelingly in the Subject, and
support him in a stronger and
more earnest Attention; which
enforces, by its Aid, the several
Ideas of the Poem and gives them
to his Imagination with unusual
Strength and Grandeur. He cannot
surely but confess, that he is a
Gainer in the Exchange, when he
barters the want of a single
Probability, that of Pronunciation
(a thing merely arbitrary and
every where different) for a noble
heightening of Affections which
are suitable to the Occasion, arid
enable him to enter into the
Subject with double Energy and
Enjoyment.
