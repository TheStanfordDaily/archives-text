# Reaction To Rosenzweig On Both Sides Of Fence
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Vice Provost Robert M.
Rosenzweig's superiors in the
administration couldn't be more
pleased with his performance.
However, some in the University
community, and specifically in the
Stanford Rehabilitation Movement,
aren't as impressed.
President Lyman, whom
Rosenzweig also serves as advisor, calls
him his "minister without portfolio,"
a man he wanted to be sure to include
in his administration.
Vice President and Provost William
Miller's praise for Rosenzweig is as
great as Lyman's. Miller feels that
Rosenzweig is "presidential material"
either here or at another university.
Those opposed to Rosenzweig say
that he has not lived up to his
estimation that "preserving an open
and free University is an enormously
great contribution to society."
Rosenzweig, 40, assumed his
present position last year after serving
for four years as associate provost.
From 1962 to 1967, Rosenzweig was
associate dean of the Graduate
Division and a lecturer in Political
Science.
Either currently or in the recent
past, Rosenzweig has had
responsibility for international studies
programs, minority affairs and for
dealing with campus disruptions.
Serious criticisms have been leveled at
the manner in which he has handled
each of these positions.
Korea Conference
In 1968, as the director of the
Stanford Center for Research in
International Studies, Rosenzweig was
the Stanford administrator for a Seoul,
Korea conference on "The Role of
Higher Education in National
Development in Asia."
About $35,000 worth of funding
for the conference came from the Asia
Foundation, which was revealed in
1967 as a front organization for the
Central Intelligence Agency.
The May 20, 1971 issue of
Chaparral asserted that Rosenzweig
and the University were doing their
best to cover up the Asia Foundation's
funding and were ignoring the ClA's
involvement.
In response to these charges,
Rosenzweig says that "we, to the best
of our ability, assured ourselves, on
the basis of assurances from them, that

they were no longer receiving money
from the CIA."
Do Nothing
Earlier in the 60's, Rosenzweig
served as the chairman of the new
faculty administration committee on
educational opportunities for
disadvantaged minorities. Lee
Herzenberg, resident associate in the
Genetics Department, asserted that
"he didn't do anything bad because he
didn't do anything at all other than
hold back progress."
Rosenzweig says that "it was
characteristic of universities at that
time that nothing was happening with
respect to minorities."
"In retrospect, it's very clear that
during that period, say 1964 to 1967,
there was no fundamental
commitment on the part of the
University to make a substantial effort
to open itself up to students from a
variety of minority groups."
Rosenzweig admits that "I didn't
push the admissions office into doing
anything" with regard to minority
student admissions. He says that he
"didn't sufficiently appreciate the
urgency, but I was trying to do more
than most people here were willing to
do at that time."
Hard Liner
Rosenzweig is generally viewed as a
"hard liner" dealing with campus
disruptions. He calls recent
demonstrations in various professors'
classes "direct assaults on the freedom
of teachers to teach and of students to
learn."
The Vice Provost says he is "fairly
substantially engaged in the various
aspects of dealing with campus
disruptions." Specifically, he mentions
"planning for them and trying to get
out of them when they happen."
With regard to the administration
decision to call police in to break up
the April, 1971 sit-in at Stanford
Hospital, Provost Miller says
Rosenzweig "certainly was a key
advisor."
Rosenzweig asserts that since Legal
Advisor to the President James Siena
had been so heavily involved in the
Bruce Franklin hearing, Siena "felt it
would be inappropriate to advise"
Lyman after the Faculty Advisory
Board had made its recommendations
in the case.
Rosenzweig said that he took over
for Siena as Lyman's chief advisor in
the President's decision to fire
Franklin.
Blind and Deaf
"I don't expect anybody to believe
it,"says Rosenzweig of the case, "but
the University was not keeping its eye
on Bruce Franklin. It was very hard on
the day of February 10 [1971] to
avoid noticing Bruce Franklin. You
had to be blind and deaf to miss what
he did."
Rosenzweig says of the controversy
over Electrical Engineering Professor

William Shockley, "It's perfectly clear
that Dr. Shockley can do any research
he wants to. That's one of the things
that the University is about as far as
I'm concerned."
He points out that even though it is
"possible" that Shockley's theories on
the genetic inferiority of blacks were
contributing to racism in this country,
"there's no reason why I have to
approve of what he believes in order to
support his right to say what he
believes."
Rosenzweig expresses his desire to
have further "interchanges of ideas"
with students. He says he "felt a little
guilty" about teaching an
undergraduate seminar on American
politics "because I've had less and less
time to devote to it." He describes
those seminars as "interesting and
intellectual experiences."
SRM Confrontation
His confrontation with Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement members
during a "mill-in" inside Building 10
last month is described by Rosenzweig
as a "challenging" opportunity to
"heighten our mutual understanding."
In further discussing the "mill-in,"
Rosenzweig claims it is "kind of sad"
that certain people were only out to
"make points, to call me names." He
says that "I don't like being disliked,
particularly by people who don't even
know me."
He says that "what I like most
about my job is that I keep learning
about this University, about other
universities, about people."
What about moving up to Provost
or President here or elsewhere? "I
guess I've thought about it,"he says.
"It seems like a natural next step. But
people are certainly not beating down
my door."

MAN ON THE SPOT—Vice Provost Robert M. Rosenzweig often handles campus disruptions as the administration's
representative. He was confronted by dozens of angry students during a mill-in in President Lyman's offices last month.
