U.S. Wins More Gold
SAPPORO, Japan — Teen-aged Anne Henning
assured the U.S. of its best Winter Olympics
showing since 1960 today, winning the 500-meter
speed skating event with an Olympic record time of
43.33 seconds. Hers was the second gold medal for
the U.S. during the current games. The other was
won yesterday by her speed skating teammate
Dianne Holum. The U.S. won three golds in 1960
and one each in 1964 and 1968.
Irish D-Day Fizzles
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — D-Day For
Disruption, the bid of Roman Catholic civil rights
leaders to paralyze this bloodstained British
province with 24 hours of civic chaos yesterday
collapsed in confusion and indifference. Flareups of
violence were no more than usual, and business
affairs functioned smoothly.
Dock Strike Nears End
SAN FRANCISCO — Negotiating teams stayed hard

at work yesterday with mediator Sam Kagel putting
finishing touches to a tentative agreement to settle
the West Coast's longest dock strike.
By agreement, there was no word of progress.
As Congress rushed through standby legislation
in Washington to end the strike by compulsory
arbitration, the push here was to perfect the
settlement before Saturday. The powerful coastwide
caucus of the International Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen's Union meets here Saturday and
will want a completed document to recommend for
ratification or rejection by the 13,000 ILWU
members.
Nixon Reviews World Slate
WASHINGTON — President Nixon told the nation
yesterday he scored "breakthroughs toward peace in
a changing world" by arranging his Peking and
Moscow summits and by rebuilding allied alliances.
He injected himself into the debate over alternatives
to his Vietnam policy by cautioning presidential
candidates to avoid statements which "might give
the enemy an incentive to prolong the war until

after the election."
Nixon commented in a nationwide radio
broadcast timed to correspond with the delivery of
his 94,000-word foreign-policy report to Congress.
* Faculty Club Furor *
Last night at the regular meeting of the
Harvard Club of the Peninsula, held at the
Faculty Club, a young club member and his
guests were nearly ejected by chief Chef
Arturo Lionetti and were shouted at by
other members as they attempted to speak.
Main Library employee Roy Boggs and
his guests had gone to the meeting to engage
in discussion about the evening's topic. As
they approached a dinner table to sit down,
Lionetti came up to them and asked whether
they indeed belonged there.
The club president, in squelching their
attempts to speak, threatened to call the
police. A Santa Clara County Sheriffs
deputy was indeed called to the scene to
investigate a fight and, finding none, left.

* Faculty Club Furor *
Last night at the regular meeting of the
Harvard Club of the Peninsula, held at the
Faculty Club, a young club member and his
guests were nearly ejected by chief Chef
Arturo Lionetti and were shouted at by
other members as they attempted to speak.
Main Library employee Roy Boggs and
his guests had gone to the meeting to engage
in discussion about the evening's topic. As
they approached a dinner table to sit down,
Lionetti came up to them and asked whether
they indeed belonged there.
The club president, in squelching their
attempts to speak, threatened to call the
police. A Santa Clara County Sheriffs
deputy was indeed called to the scene to
investigate a fight and, finding none, left.
U.S. Wins More Gold
SAPPORO, Japan — Teen-aged Anne Henning
assured the U.S. of its best Winter Olympics
showing since 1960 today, winning the 500-meter
speed skating event with an Olympic record time of
43.33 seconds. Hers was the second gold medal for
the U.S. during the current games. The other was
won yesterday by her speed skating teammate
Dianne Holum. The U.S. won three golds in 1960
and one each in 1964 and 1968.
Irish D-Day Fizzles
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — D-Day For
Disruption, the bid of Roman Catholic civil rights
leaders to paralyze this bloodstained British
province with 24 hours of civic chaos yesterday
collapsed in confusion and indifference. Flareups of
violence were no more than usual, and business
affairs functioned smoothly.
Dock Strike Nears End
SAN FRANCISCO — Negotiating teams stayed hard

at work yesterday with mediator Sam Kagel putting
finishing touches to a tentative agreement to settle
the West Coast's longest dock strike.
By agreement, there was no word of progress.
As Congress rushed through standby legislation
in Washington to end the strike by compulsory
arbitration, the push here was to perfect the
settlement before Saturday. The powerful coastwide
caucus of the International Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen's Union meets here Saturday and
will want a completed document to recommend for
ratification or rejection by the 13,000 ILWU
members.
Nixon Reviews World Slate
WASHINGTON — President Nixon told the nation
yesterday he scored "breakthroughs toward peace in
a changing world" by arranging his Peking and
Moscow summits and by rebuilding allied alliances.
He injected himself into the debate over alternatives
to his Vietnam policy by cautioning presidential
candidates to avoid statements which "might give
the enemy an incentive to prolong the war until

after the election."
Nixon commented in a nationwide radio
broadcast timed to correspond with the delivery of
his 94,000-word foreign-policy report to Congress.
