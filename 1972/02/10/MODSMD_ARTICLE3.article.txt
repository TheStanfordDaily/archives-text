# Back Pay Boost OK
## 
### 
Stanford faculty and staff will
receive back pay which was frozen by
last fall's 90-day wage-price controls,
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger
announced yesterday.
With few exceptions, retroactive
pay will be given to all employees on
February 22 or 25. The payments will
cover the period beginning when pay
raises were originally scheduled to take
effect and ending with the Nov. 15
end of the freeze.
Although congressional legislation
and subsequent Pay Board regulations
which allowed Stanford to pay the
back wages were handed down during
January, the announcement of these
payments apparently had to wait until
the necessary paperwork in the
personnel and payroll departments was
well underway.
The retroactive payments will also
reimburse employees for deductions
from their paychecks during the
90-day freeze to finance the Prudential
Staff Retirement Plan. A Cost of
Living Council ruling stopped the
University from assuming its full cost
during that period.

The announcement added that
salary increases to faculty and staff
would be made to the maximum
extent permitted by Federal law and
recently published Pay Board
regulations.
