# COSS Requests Ban On War Recruitment
## 
### 
After extensive hearings last month,
the Committee on Student Services
(COSS) yesterday voted 8-1 to
recommend to President Lyman that
"military recruiters be barred from
using the formal placement facilities at
Stanford."
COSS was asked by Lyman to
suggest future policy for the
Placement Center. Last November 11,
he said that he supported a policy of
open recruiting by all parties.
COSS included in the phrase
"placement facilities" the Career
Planning and Placement Center, the
Law School Placement Service, the

Graduate School of Business, "and any
similar facilities which may be
established in the future."
The committee passed 5-4 a
proposal to hold a student body
referendum to "establish the policy of
whether military recruiters and
recruiters from companies falling
within specific guidelines relating to
their production of weapons of war
should be barred from University
placement services."
Every Two Years
It was recommended that the
referendum be repeated every two
years and that it should either be
mailed to every registered student or
be enclosed in registration packets.
Included with each ballot would be a
summary of the more important
arguments heard by COSS.
In a referendum similar to the one
recommended by COSS, the student
body voted 1947 to 1496 last April to

ban military recruiters from campus.
They also voted 1758 to 1596 to
prohibit war industries from
recruiting.
In another 5-4 vote, COSS defeated
a proposal to bar "some companies
producing weapons of war" from
placement facilities "on principle."
The committee also recommended
that placement facilities provide more

open information about recruiting
corporations, including Department of
Defense contracts and hiring practices
for women and minority groups.
Neither Lyman nor Placement
Center Director Ralph Keller will have
any comment on the COSS
recommendations until they receive
copies of the formal statement, which
are expected to be ready by February
18.
