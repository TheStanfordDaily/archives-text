# ROTC, Cambodia Confrontations Plagued Pitzer
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT (Third of Four Parts) 
"The whole ROTC sequence is a long and,
as far as I'm concerned, a sad story," Kenneth
Pitzer recalled last week.
In Pitzer's second troubled year as
Stanford's president, the battle over ROTC
military training brought marches, sit-ins,
meetings and referenda.
Many protests remained nonviolent during
the 1969-70 school year. But running warfare
with riot police also became part of campus
politics, and "trashing" became part of the
Stanford vocabulary before ROTC's phase-out
was finally decreed in May.
In spring, 1969, the Academic Senate had
quietly voted to take away academic credit
from ROTC's military training courses. But
the Senate changed that vote the next winter
after Pitzer recommended in January that
individual ROTC courses be granted credit
through the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS).
"That this issue might become
controversial was certainly obvious," Pitzer
said in a Daily interview at UC Berkeley,
where he is now a Chemistry professor.
Wishful Thinking
But he argued that the faculty had engaged
in "merelv wishful thinking" in its earlier vote

to keep ROTC without any academic credit.
Pitzer said the Defense Department proved
unwilling to approve ROTC without any
credit, although there were reports that a
non-credit ROTC had been approved at
eastern colleges.
Pitzer insisted that the plan for partial
credit seemed the only workable way of
keeping the faculty's goal of maintaining "the
opportunity of ROTC for students on a less
official basis."
He argued that the plan for partial credit
was a significant change from "a prima facie
offering of credit." Pitzer said the
administration proposal shifted ROTC credit
'to a case where the burden of proof was on
the military people to show a particular
activity does merit credit."
Brooks Job
In the midst of the ROTC controversy,
serious questions were raised about the role of
Vice Provost Howard Brooks, who negotiated
the ROTC compromise with the Defense
Department. Brooks had been offered a
Defense Department job sometime before the
negotiations began. Another DoD job was
offered to Brooks sometime after the
negotiations.
Pitzer maintained the job offers came
"substantially before and substantially after"

Brooks' negotiating role and that he did not
doubt Brooks' integrity.
He conceded that "in retrospect, there was
a question as to whether he was the best
choice or not." Pitzer said another negotiator
might have been more acceptable "in terms
tactically of gaining faculty acceptance of the
outcome."
But he suggested that other types of
negotiators "would have simply alienated
themselves with respect to the Defense
Department people they were talking to."

Pitzer Looks Back

Many alumni vehemently demanded that
ROTC not be "offed." Pitzer recalled: "A
great many alumni felt very strongly that the
opportunity for ROTC ought to remain. This
was an area in which I found myself
personally on that same side.
"It seemed to me this was something that
should be the student's choice, when it could
be presented in an appropriate framework."
There were reports at the time that
Defense Department funding of Stanford
programs would be reduced in retaliation if
ROTC were eliminated.
Pitzer commented, "It was perfectly

obvious that certain people felt a certain way
on the issue. But there was no direct threats
that if you don't maintain ROTC, this or that
would happen."
The ROTC debates and protests continued
throughout winter and spring quarters. A
fullscale riot erupted April 29, when police
broke up a nonviolent sit-in at the Old Union
and when demonstrators learned that the U.S.
had invaded Cambodia.
The Cambodia invasion was the basis for an
unprecedented campus strike, lasting for over
a week and closing most regular classes and
campus functions.
Asked if the Cambodia strike, which
involved campuses throughout the country,
was a precedent for shutting down the
universities, Pitzer said, "Faced with the
realities of a massive situation, it may be a
precedent, but there's not much you can do
about it."
Pitzer added, "It seemed to me that this
was really not an effective or useful way of
protesting Cambodia. But when a sufficiently
large proportion of the community, both
students and faculty, are in a certain mood, it
is just not practical to force the community in
a different direction right then and now."
But Pitzer stressed that "as soon as most
people do want to go to class and most

faculty do want to teach, then it seems
important to bring appropriate pressure on
the remaining minority to make that
possible."
By the end of Pitzer's second school year
at Stanford, the faculty changed its mind
again and voted to eliminate any credit for
ROTC. Students went home with
"incompletes" to finish from courses which
never happened during the tumultuous
campus protests.
And Pitzer's own hopes to handle campus
disruptions through internal judicial systems
had been largely overwhelmed in a year of
violent clashes between police and
demonstrators.
Resignation
There have been rumors that Pitzer first
offered his resignation at a secret trustees'
meeting during the Cambodia strike.
Asked about the rumor, Pitzer commented,
"Well, that's not correct in any literal sense. I
suppose it is true that's about the time I began
to wonder about things, and 1 might have
wondered conversationally in a highly
informal way with one or two people."
Pitzer actually submitted his resignation in
June, 1970.

"incompletes" to finish from courses which
never happened during the tumultuous
campus protests.
And Pitzer's own hopes to handle campus
disruptions through internal judicial systems
had been largely overwhelmed in a year of
violent clashes between police and
demonstrators.
Resignation
There have been rumors that Pitzer first
offered his resignation at a secret trustees'
meeting during the Cambodia strike.
Asked about the rumor, Pitzer commented,
"Well, that's not correct in any literal sense. I
suppose it is true that's about the time I began
to wonder about things, and 1 might have
wondered conversationally in a highly
informal way with one or two people."
Pitzer actually submitted his resignation in
June, 1970.
(Tomorrow: What Pitzer has done since
leaving Stanford.)
"The whole ROTC sequence is a long and,
as far as I'm concerned, a sad story," Kenneth
Pitzer recalled last week.
In Pitzer's second troubled year as
Stanford's president, the battle over ROTC
military training brought marches, sit-ins,
meetings and referenda.
Many protests remained nonviolent during
the 1969-70 school year. But running warfare
with riot police also became part of campus
politics, and "trashing" became part of the
Stanford vocabulary before ROTC's phase-out
was finally decreed in May.
In spring, 1969, the Academic Senate had
quietly voted to take away academic credit
from ROTC's military training courses. But
the Senate changed that vote the next winter
after Pitzer recommended in January that
individual ROTC courses be granted credit
through the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS).
"That this issue might become
controversial was certainly obvious," Pitzer
said in a Daily interview at UC Berkeley,
where he is now a Chemistry professor.
Wishful Thinking
But he argued that the faculty had engaged
in "merelv wishful thinking" in its earlier vote

to keep ROTC without any academic credit.
Pitzer said the Defense Department proved
unwilling to approve ROTC without any
credit, although there were reports that a
non-credit ROTC had been approved at
eastern colleges.
Pitzer insisted that the plan for partial
credit seemed the only workable way of
keeping the faculty's goal of maintaining "the
opportunity of ROTC for students on a less
official basis."
He argued that the plan for partial credit
was a significant change from "a prima facie
offering of credit." Pitzer said the
administration proposal shifted ROTC credit
'to a case where the burden of proof was on
the military people to show a particular
activity does merit credit."
Brooks Job
In the midst of the ROTC controversy,
serious questions were raised about the role of
Vice Provost Howard Brooks, who negotiated
the ROTC compromise with the Defense
Department. Brooks had been offered a
Defense Department job sometime before the
negotiations began. Another DoD job was
offered to Brooks sometime after the
negotiations.
Pitzer maintained the job offers came
"substantially before and substantially after"

Brooks' negotiating role and that he did not
doubt Brooks' integrity.
He conceded that "in retrospect, there was
a question as to whether he was the best
choice or not." Pitzer said another negotiator
might have been more acceptable "in terms
tactically of gaining faculty acceptance of the
outcome."
But he suggested that other types of
negotiators "would have simply alienated
themselves with respect to the Defense
Department people they were talking to."

Pitzer Looks Back

Many alumni vehemently demanded that
ROTC not be "offed." Pitzer recalled: "A
great many alumni felt very strongly that the
opportunity for ROTC ought to remain. This
was an area in which I found myself
personally on that same side.
"It seemed to me this was something that
should be the student's choice, when it could
be presented in an appropriate framework."
There were reports at the time that
Defense Department funding of Stanford
programs would be reduced in retaliation if
ROTC were eliminated.
Pitzer commented, "It was perfectly

obvious that certain people felt a certain way
on the issue. But there was no direct threats
that if you don't maintain ROTC, this or that
would happen."
The ROTC debates and protests continued
throughout winter and spring quarters. A
fullscale riot erupted April 29, when police
broke up a nonviolent sit-in at the Old Union
and when demonstrators learned that the U.S.
had invaded Cambodia.
The Cambodia invasion was the basis for an
unprecedented campus strike, lasting for over
a week and closing most regular classes and
campus functions.
Asked if the Cambodia strike, which
involved campuses throughout the country,
was a precedent for shutting down the
universities, Pitzer said, "Faced with the
realities of a massive situation, it may be a
precedent, but there's not much you can do
about it."
Pitzer added, "It seemed to me that this
was really not an effective or useful way of
protesting Cambodia. But when a sufficiently
large proportion of the community, both
students and faculty, are in a certain mood, it
is just not practical to force the community in
a different direction right then and now."
But Pitzer stressed that "as soon as most
people do want to go to class and most

faculty do want to teach, then it seems
important to bring appropriate pressure on
the remaining minority to make that
possible."
By the end of Pitzer's second school year
at Stanford, the faculty changed its mind
again and voted to eliminate any credit for
ROTC. Students went home with
"incompletes" to finish from courses which

precedent, but there's not much you can do
about it."
Pitzer added, "It seemed to me that this
was really not an effective or useful way of
protesting Cambodia. But when a sufficiently
large proportion of the community, both
students and faculty, are in a certain mood, it
is just not practical to force the community in
a different direction right then and now."
But Pitzer stressed that "as soon as most
people do want to go to class and most

faculty do want to teach, then it seems
important to bring appropriate pressure on
the remaining minority to make that
possible."
By the end of Pitzer's second school year
at Stanford, the faculty changed its mind
again and voted to eliminate any credit for
ROTC. Students went home with
"incompletes" to finish from courses which
never happened during the tumultuous
campus protests.
And Pitzer's own hopes to handle campus
disruptions through internal judicial systems
had been largely overwhelmed in a year of
violent clashes between police and
demonstrators.
Resignation
There have been rumors that Pitzer first
offered his resignation at a secret trustees'
meeting during the Cambodia strike.
Asked about the rumor, Pitzer commented,
"Well, that's not correct in any literal sense. I
suppose it is true that's about the time I began
to wonder about things, and 1 might have
wondered conversationally in a highly
informal way with one or two people."
Pitzer actually submitted his resignation in
June, 1970.

"The whole ROTC sequence is a long and,
as far as I'm concerned, a sad story," Kenneth
Pitzer recalled last week.
In Pitzer's second troubled year as
Stanford's president, the battle over ROTC
military training brought marches, sit-ins,
meetings and referenda.
Many protests remained nonviolent during
the 1969-70 school year. But running warfare
with riot police also became part of campus
politics, and "trashing" became part of the
Stanford vocabulary before ROTC's phase-out
was finally decreed in May.
In spring, 1969, the Academic Senate had
quietly voted to take away academic credit
from ROTC's military training courses. But
the Senate changed that vote the next winter
after Pitzer recommended in January that
individual ROTC courses be granted credit
through the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS).
"That this issue might become
controversial was certainly obvious," Pitzer
said in a Daily interview at UC Berkeley,
where he is now a Chemistry professor.
Wishful Thinking
But he argued that the faculty had engaged
in "merelv wishful thinking" in its earlier vote

to keep ROTC without any academic credit.
Pitzer said the Defense Department proved
unwilling to approve ROTC without any
credit, although there were reports that a
non-credit ROTC had been approved at
eastern colleges.
Pitzer insisted that the plan for partial
credit seemed the only workable way of
keeping the faculty's goal of maintaining "the
opportunity of ROTC for students on a less
official basis."
He argued that the plan for partial credit
was a significant change from "a prima facie
offering of credit." Pitzer said the
administration proposal shifted ROTC credit
'to a case where the burden of proof was on
the military people to show a particular
activity does merit credit."
Brooks Job
In the midst of the ROTC controversy,
serious questions were raised about the role of
Vice Provost Howard Brooks, who negotiated
the ROTC compromise with the Defense
Department. Brooks had been offered a
Defense Department job sometime before the
negotiations began. Another DoD job was
offered to Brooks sometime after the
negotiations.
Pitzer maintained the job offers came
"substantially before and substantially after"

Brooks' negotiating role and that he did not
doubt Brooks' integrity.
He conceded that "in retrospect, there was
a question as to whether he was the best
choice or not." Pitzer said another negotiator
might have been more acceptable "in terms
tactically of gaining faculty acceptance of the
outcome."
But he suggested that other types of
negotiators "would have simply alienated
themselves with respect to the Defense
Department people they were talking to."

Pitzer Looks Back

Many alumni vehemently demanded that
ROTC not be "offed." Pitzer recalled: "A
great many alumni felt very strongly that the
opportunity for ROTC ought to remain. This
was an area in which I found myself
personally on that same side.
"It seemed to me this was something that
should be the student's choice, when it could
be presented in an appropriate framework."
There were reports at the time that
Defense Department funding of Stanford
programs would be reduced in retaliation if
ROTC were eliminated.
Pitzer commented, "It was perfectly

obvious that certain people felt a certain way
on the issue. But there was no direct threats
that if you don't maintain ROTC, this or that
would happen."
The ROTC debates and protests continued
throughout winter and spring quarters. A
fullscale riot erupted April 29, when police
broke up a nonviolent sit-in at the Old Union
and when demonstrators learned that the U.S.
had invaded Cambodia.
The Cambodia invasion was the basis for an
unprecedented campus strike, lasting for over
a week and closing most regular classes and
campus functions.
Asked if the Cambodia strike, which
involved campuses throughout the country,
was a precedent for shutting down the
universities, Pitzer said, "Faced with the
realities of a massive situation, it may be a
precedent, but there's not much you can do
about it."
Pitzer added, "It seemed to me that this
was really not an effective or useful way of
protesting Cambodia. But when a sufficiently
large proportion of the community, both
students and faculty, are in a certain mood, it
is just not practical to force the community in
a different direction right then and now."

people do want to go to class and most
