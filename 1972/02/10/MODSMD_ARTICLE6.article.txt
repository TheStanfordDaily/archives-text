## Judge Administration, Faculty 
### 
placement center collective

Due to an emergency situation
in which there is no legitimate or
effective body to deal with
faculty and administration
violations of student rights and
the regulations pertaining to those
rights, we petition the ASSU
Senate to exercise its residual
authority as the representative
organ of the students. The Senate
should immediately establish a
University Judicial Panel and a
Student Police Force to deal with
the problem.
If such action requires a
precedent, it can be found in
President Lyman's November 29,
1971, decree abolishing student
rights under the SJC.
(As we pointed out in our
February 4 letter to the Daily,
Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter, as limited by the
Founding Grant requirement of
"just and equitable" disciplinary
rules, could arguably provide
presidential authority for filling
the SJC vacancies. It hardly
permits a unilateral abrogation of
student rights on the pretext of
the need to fill vacancies on the
old SJC. Thus it is clear that
emergencies empower such action,
whether by the president or the
ASSU, even in the absence of
chartered authority.)
Our own case before the CJP
documents the nature of the
emergency.' By insisting on
scheduling hearings in the
mornings, Prof. John Kaplan has
deprived defendants and counsel
of their rights to attend classes
before any of us were adjudged
guilty of any violations.
Kaplan refused to even convene
the CJP to hear what we think are
irrefutable challenges to its
jurisdiction (including the
president's lack of authority to
establish the CJP, and the use of
the judicial machinery for
politically discriminatory
enforcement of campus rules).
By this refusal, Kaplan is
forcing us to have the case
adjudicated by an illegitimate
body, which happens to be

composed of judges appointed by
the prosecuting agency (the
administration).
(Kaplan makes the disingenous
suggestion that we could argue the
jurisdictional issue after Ms.
Altree makes her findings. But
once the university spends its
resources putting on the trial, it
will be impossible for the CJP to
objectively evaluate the reasons
why the trial was unauthorized in
the first place and then decline to
punish defendants already found
guilty.)
Saturday Morning Session
By springing a Saturday
morning session on us and
refusing to grant a continuance,
Chairman Kaplan, Prosecutor
Schwartz, and Hearing Officer
Altree conspired to deprive us of
our right to a well-publicized
hearing so that the community
can understand what is happening
to us.
It also turned out that half of
us were not notified of the session
and that we could not reach the
witnesses we intended to call to
present evidence on the
jurisdictional issue. Those of us
present Saturday morning
explained that this meant that we
would be unable to proceed with
our preliminary motions and
unable to adequately
cross-examine prosecution
witnesses. But the time was
convenient for Mr. Schwartz and
Ms. Altree, so they held their
hearing without us.
One Week Notice
After the ASSU prosecutor and
staff put together a case, a week's
notice must be provided for the
defendants so that they and their
part-time counsel may do the
same. If the defendant does not
show up, he will be suspended
from his teaching or
administrative job unless he shows
he was absent for "unavoidable
and extraordinary" reasons.
Defendants will have no
subpoena power, but witnesses
called by the complaining student
will be suspended from their

classes or their faculty or
administration post if they do not
cooperate fully.
Hearings will be open if the
UJP chairman wishes, even if
testimony could incriminate the
defendant; they will be closed (or
scheduled at an hour when no one
will be listening to them or know
about them) if we wish to
perpetrate any minor travesties.
Sentencing, of course, must
take account of the likelihood of
similar misconduct in the future.
This means that the severest
penalities, generally dismissal,
must be meted out to those who
profess that they think they did
the right thing under the
circumstances in their disruptive
actions against students.
The UJP will recommend a
punishment to the ASSU Council
of Presidents, who may consult
the prosecutor and any students
in deciding on the sanction. The
defendant may only submit
written argument that the above
procedures were net followed in
hearing his case.
Student Police Force
Sanctions would include fines,
suspensions, and dismissal. The
ASSU Senate would have to set
up a Student Police Force to
enforce the sanctions.
This is one point where we
should diverge from
administration practice, however.
The student police should be
empowered to stop suspended
administrators and faculty
members from defying the
sanctions by engaging them in
argument, making noise,
sitting-in, etc., but we should not
follow the administration practice
of using force when no one is
being directly harmed by those
violating our rules. (If, however,
recalcitrant administrators try to
continue their definace with the
aid of violent thugs whom they
call onto campus from outside,
then other measures may be
necessary.)
In view of the present
emergency, we urge immediate

enactment of the above
mentioned procedures and
prompt establishment of the UJP
and the Student Police Force.
Writing up procedures should
require minimal time and effort,
since the renunciation of
unnecessary violence would be the
only departure from the model
provded by President Lyman's
decree.
This is a serious proposal.
Students are being harassed and
prevented from attending classes;
several will be suspended shortly;
and the Placement Center and
other campus facilities arc being
used to help in improving the
efficiency of methods for killing
Asiansâ€”all in violation of campus
regulations and state, national,
and international law.
These fundamental violations
of our own rights, the hearing of
Rafas Robles's case by the same
illegal CJP mechanisms, and the
administration's refusal to even
consider stopping war crimes
being committed at the Placement
Center, demonstrate the nature of
the present emergency. Moreover,
the Senate is the only body that
can act. Despite the fact that the
CJP can consider complaints of
students against illegal
punishment by the
administration, it is obvious that
no help will come from this
quarter.
The president clearly is not
about to help. The Committee of
Fifteen, dominated by faculty and
administration members, has
shown no signs of resisting the
administration decision to bypass
it.
When approached about the
Franklin case last month, the
trustees told us that students have
no right to petition them and
discuss the issues if the situation
even appears to be covered by the
administration's adjudicative
methods. The ASSU Senate must
act.
Simple Solution
The solution is simple, since the
administration has shown us how
to handle emergencies. Get a copy
of the "Procedures for the
Adjudication of Student
Disciplinary Cases" (the CJP
decree). Every place the word
student, faculty, or administration
appears, substitute the
appropriate one of the other two
words to reverse the procedures.
Then we can give others a taste of
their own medicine through our
University Judicial Panel (UJP).
Any student will be able to
complain of any administration
violation, but a faculty member or
administrator can only complain
of personally being illegally
disciplined by student authorities.
The student prosecutorial
agency (like the administration
under the CJP) will appoint the
hearing officiers, who will make

unappealable findings of fact on
charges against faculty and
administrators. Defendants will be
able to argue, without presenting
witnesses, that the conduct they
were found to have committed
did not violate any rules, before
the full UJP.
This unbiased body will consist
of three randomly-selected faculty
members and four students
appointed by the student
prosecuting agency. Those who
participate on the panel, of
course, will only be people who
agree that faculty and
administration misconduct has
gotten so far out of hand as to
make the emergency measures
legitimate. The right to challenge
panel members for bias will not be
mentioned in our "Procedures"
document.

Defendants may have law
students as counsel, but no
hearings shall be postponed
because of the inability of counsel
to attend. The ASSU will hire a
lawyer as prosecutor, with a
backup staff of secretaries,
photographers, and student police
and investigators.
We hope you will not be
intimidated by the authoritarian
tactics of those trustees,
administrators, and faculty who
will go to any lengths to continue
using this university for their own
political ends.
