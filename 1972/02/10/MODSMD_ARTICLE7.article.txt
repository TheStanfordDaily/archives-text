# Personal Attack Unworthy Of Issue
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: The following is a
statement by Alan Dershowitz on
KZSU (Feb. 4, 1972) in response
to remarks by Resident R. Lyman
(KZSU, Feb. 1, 1972).
Earlier in the week, on this
station, Stanford President
Richard Lyman, in discussing the
Franklin case, singled me out for a
cynical and ad hominem attack.
Characterizing me as that
"Harvard Law Professor come to
Stanford to save us all from sin,"
he suggested that the
constitutional law views which I
have espoused are extreme and
irresponsible.
This is not the first time that I
have been subjected to personal
attack as the result of civil
liberties views I have espoused or
clients I have represented.
Previously, however, such attacks
have always come from
know-nothing reactionaries on the

far right (as they did when I
represented William Kunstler in
his Chicago contempt case or the
musical "Hair" when it was
banned in Boston).
Usually, I have chosen not to
respond publically to such ad
hominems. But Dr. Lyman's
attack is so reflective of the
unhealthy attitude toward civil
liberties that currently prevails in
many parts of the Stanford
campus, that I believe a vigorous
response is called for.
I first became interested in the
Franklin case when I learned that
he was without a lawyer; that the
administration, while spending
tens of thousands of dollars on
four excellent lawyers to present
its side of the case, had denied
Franklin's request for a modest
sum of money to retain one
attorney to present his side.
When I raised some questions

about this obvious inequity, I was
immediately subjected to attacks
by many of my former colleagues
on the Stanford Law faculty: my
motives were questioned, as was
the "propriety" of an outsider
intruding himself into the business
of his host University. I was
virtually made to feel like a
northern civil rights worker in
Mississippi during the early 60's.
But, of course, no one in the
administration, to this day, has
addressed the issue of counsel on
its merits.
When I sought to submit a brief
on behalf of the American Civil
Liberties Union setting out that
organization's long standing views
on speech—views which departed
from Franklin's in a number of
important respects—the Board at
first imposed barriers to accepting
it and when it finally did, two
members of the law faculty wrote
to the Board urging it to ignore
the ACLU brief, without in any
way addressing the issues raised in
that brief on their merits.
And now Dr. Lyman has joined
the chorus of ad hominem, also
without addressing himself to the

merits of the issues I have tried to
raise. The time has come for
concerned members of the
Stanford community—for those
who believe in civil liberties, even
when issues close to home are
involved—to insist that this
juvenile name calling be stopped,
and that the issues be addressed.
There are important civil
liberties issues at stake in the
Franklin firing—issues of national
si gni ficance—despite the
administration's attempts to
ridicule them and those who seek
to raise them. These issues are too
important to be dismissed as the
concern of isolated saviors. Civil
libertarians across this country are
casting a critical eye at this
campus— and with good cause.
If Dr. Lyman wants to
challenge my views of the
constitution on civil liberties and
those of the ACLU, I invite that
challenge on its merits. Let us
debate these issues rationally and
impersonally. I have not—and will
not—question Dr. Lyman's good
faith or motives, and it was
improper—in the extreme—for
him to question mine.
