(The following is an article in
response to the two articles by
Gary Atkins on the
I nte rcom munal Survival
Committee to Combat Fascism
and their relation to Venceremos
in the Daily of February 2 and 3.)

Although I'm not a member of
Venceremos, I feel it necessary to
reply to some of the accusations
and innuendos about Venceremos
made by Miriam Cherry and
Sharon Winslow of the
In t e rco m munal Survival
Committee to Combat Fascism in
the Daily articles on ISCCF by
Gary Atkins.
I've been studying the theory
and practice and talking with
members of both organizations
for quite a while now and have
come to realize that the main
contradiction between the two is
that ISCCF and the Black Panther
Party are revisionist, whereas
Venceremos is revolutionary.
Miriam Cherry claims, in the
first article, that "We saw
one-sided thinking in Venceremos,
a one-sided view that revolution is
based just on picking up the
gun—or talking about picking up
the gun." Venceremos made many
mistakes last year, such as failure
to work within a united front and
abandoning the student
movement, but they have never
seen revolution or serving the
people only in terms of "picking
up the gun."
I myself work at the Sojourner
Truth child care center in Palo
Alto, which is run by a united
front of Venceremos members
and other community people who
find a need to serve poor and
working people. Venceremos runs
and serves in other child care
centers and food co-ops in the
Bay Area, particularly in the
People's Medical Center in East
Redwood City.
Venceremos is constantly
trying to create new programs to
serve the people. It is ISCCF that
is one-sided because it only sees
one side of the dialectic, serve the
people; Venceremos sees the
dialectic as double sided: serve the
people, stop the pig.
Opponents To Child Care
In talking about the opponents
of their child care program,
Cherry states they are "people
who sit off to the side and

criticize, who try in various ways
to say that these programs are
wrong without investigating for
themselves or being themselves
involved. And we get it from both
sides, both reactionaries and
so-called revolutionaries who call
you 'racist sissy' as you walk by."
First of all, Venceremos doesn't
criticize the survival programs per
se. What they criticize is the fact
that those programs are more and
more being co-opted into and by
the establishment, i.e. by
capitalism. As for the 'racist sissy'
part, Venceremos labeled the
(white) members who split with
that term because they blindly
followed the leadership of Huey
P. Newton without seeing the
practice that came out of his
leadership, and because they
would accept no criticism and
refused to struggle over the issue
to find unity.
The cause of the split was not
just "a matter of tactics." The
split occurred because those
members mentioned above who
split refused to recognize the fact
that the Black Panther Party was
becoming totally revisionist, that
it had given up the idea of even
thinking about tactics for a
revolution.
The transformation to
revisionism is easily traceable in
Huey P. Newton's speeches: of
May 29, 1971, "What we are
interested in is for it (the system)
to correct itself as much as it can
do and after that if it doesn't do
everything that the people think is
necessary then we'll think about
reorganizing things. November 29,
1971, "We don't have to go
through a socialist phase."
January 29, 1972, "We're going to
put down our guns and work
within the system."
Direct Contradiction
This tactic is in direct
contradiction to "the idea,
according to the Panthers ... to
bring people to a "revolutionary
consciousness" by serving them
and having them participate in
community programs."
An organization cannot "work
within the system" or "put down
its guns" and still be revolutionary
or build revolutionary
consciousness. As Mao Tse-tung
points out, "a revolution is an
insurrection, an act of violence by
which one class overthrows

another," and to overthrow any
oppressive government takes guns.
History shows that no ruling
class has ever given up its power
peacefully. To "put down our
guns" means that the Panther and
ISCCF programs are open to
attack by the police, who remain
convinced that the Panthers are
out to destroy them.
To "work within the system"
with firm belief that real change is
possible by that route, is to admit
that revolution in the U.S. is
impossible because, as Felix
Greene, who has studied
American political socio-economic
systems for years, puts it, ". . .the
fake democracy of capitalism can
never by its very nature bring
about the fundamental changes
that are needed now, for what is
called democracy is merely the
way in which greed and
exploitation have been
institutionalized; it is, in other
words, designed precisely to
prevent fundamental change."
(The Enemy, p. 311)
Within The System
The above should not be taken
to mean that Venceremos is
totally against working within the
system. I have witnessed
Venceremos work with city
councils, student referendums, the
ASSU Senate, and as teachers at
Stanford and elsewhere.
Venceremos sees working
within the system as part of an
overall strategy to effect political
change, whereas ISCCF believes in
only working within the system.
Venceremos understands that
fundamental change will only
come when the capitalist ruling
class is no longer in power.
If a revolutionary organization
does not stick to its
Marxist-Leninist ideology, it will
be co-opted by capitalism, as the
Communist Party in the U.S. has
been and the Black Panther Party
and ISCCF are being. If the
members of an organization don't
"sit back and read . . . Marx and
Lenin" (Sharon Winslow) at least
daily, they will fall to revisionist
tactics of "working within the
system" and "put(ting) down our
guns." Just as practice determines
theory, does theory determine
practice.
So it should be clear that the
principal antagonism between
Venceremos and ISCCF and the
Black Panther Party is not over a
question of survival programs.
Both organizations have those. It
is rather a question of the tactic
of the latter organization of
working only within the system
for minor reforms, and
Venceremos' tactic of
fundamental change, "complete
satisfaction" (in the words of the
late Panther Fred Hampton)—by
any means necessary.

within the system" or "put down
its guns" and still be revolutionary
or build revolutionary
consciousness. As Mao Tse-tung
points out, "a revolution is an
insurrection, an act of violence by
which one class overthrows

another," and to overthrow any
oppressive government takes guns.
History shows that no ruling
class has ever given up its power
peacefully. To "put down our
guns" means that the Panther and
ISCCF programs are open to
attack by the police, who remain
convinced that the Panthers are
out to destroy them.
To "work within the system"
with firm belief that real change is
possible by that route, is to admit
that revolution in the U.S. is
impossible because, as Felix
Greene, who has studied
American political socio-economic
systems for years, puts it, ". . .the
fake democracy of capitalism can
never by its very nature bring
about the fundamental changes
that are needed now, for what is
called democracy is merely the
way in which greed and
exploitation have been
institutionalized; it is, in other
words, designed precisely to
prevent fundamental change."
(The Enemy, p. 311)
Within The System
The above should not be taken
to mean that Venceremos is
totally against working within the
system. I have witnessed
Venceremos work with city
councils, student referendums, the
ASSU Senate, and as teachers at
Stanford and elsewhere.
Venceremos sees working
within the system as part of an
overall strategy to effect political
change, whereas ISCCF believes in
only working within the system.
Venceremos understands that
fundamental change will only
come when the capitalist ruling
class is no longer in power.
If a revolutionary organization
does not stick to its
Marxist-Leninist ideology, it will
be co-opted by capitalism, as the
Communist Party in the U.S. has
been and the Black Panther Party
and ISCCF are being. If the
members of an organization don't
"sit back and read . . . Marx and
Lenin" (Sharon Winslow) at least
daily, they will fall to revisionist
tactics of "working within the
system" and "put(ting) down our
guns." Just as practice determines
theory, does theory determine
practice.
So it should be clear that the
principal antagonism between
Venceremos and ISCCF and the
Black Panther Party is not over a
question of survival programs.
Both organizations have those. It
is rather a question of the tactic
of the latter organization of
working only within the system
for minor reforms, and
Venceremos' tactic of
fundamental change, "complete
satisfaction" (in the words of the
late Panther Fred Hampton)—by
any means necessary.

response to the two articles by
Gary Atkins on the
I nte rcom munal Survival
Committee to Combat Fascism
and their relation to Venceremos
in the Daily of February 2 and 3.)
* * *
Although I'm not a member of
Venceremos, I feel it necessary to
reply to some of the accusations
and innuendos about Venceremos
made by Miriam Cherry and
Sharon Winslow of the
In t e rco m munal Survival
Committee to Combat Fascism in
the Daily articles on ISCCF by
Gary Atkins.
I've been studying the theory
and practice and talking with
members of both organizations
for quite a while now and have
come to realize that the main
contradiction between the two is
that ISCCF and the Black Panther
Party are revisionist, whereas
Venceremos is revolutionary.
Miriam Cherry claims, in the
first article, that "We saw
one-sided thinking in Venceremos,
a one-sided view that revolution is
based just on picking up the
gun—or talking about picking up
the gun." Venceremos made many
mistakes last year, such as failure
to work within a united front and
abandoning the student
movement, but they have never
seen revolution or serving the
people only in terms of "picking
up the gun."
I myself work at the Sojourner
Truth child care center in Palo
Alto, which is run by a united
front of Venceremos members
and other community people who
find a need to serve poor and
working people. Venceremos runs
and serves in other child care
centers and food co-ops in the
Bay Area, particularly in the
People's Medical Center in East
Redwood City.
Venceremos is constantly
trying to create new programs to
serve the people. It is ISCCF that
is one-sided because it only sees
one side of the dialectic, serve the
people; Venceremos sees the
dialectic as double sided: serve the
people, stop the pig.
Opponents To Child Care
In talking about the opponents
of their child care program,
Cherry states they are "people
who sit off to the side and

criticize, who try in various ways
to say that these programs are
wrong without investigating for
themselves or being themselves
involved. And we get it from both
sides, both reactionaries and
so-called revolutionaries who call
you 'racist sissy' as you walk by."
First of all, Venceremos doesn't
criticize the survival programs per
se. What they criticize is the fact
that those programs are more and
more being co-opted into and by
the establishment, i.e. by
capitalism. As for the 'racist sissy'
part, Venceremos labeled the
(white) members who split with
that term because they blindly
followed the leadership of Huey
P. Newton without seeing the
practice that came out of his
leadership, and because they
would accept no criticism and
refused to struggle over the issue
to find unity.
The cause of the split was not
just "a matter of tactics." The
split occurred because those
members mentioned above who
split refused to recognize the fact
that the Black Panther Party was
becoming totally revisionist, that
it had given up the idea of even
thinking about tactics for a
revolution.
The transformation to
revisionism is easily traceable in
Huey P. Newton's speeches: of
May 29, 1971, "What we are
interested in is for it (the system)
to correct itself as much as it can
do and after that if it doesn't do
everything that the people think is
necessary then we'll think about
reorganizing things. November 29,
1971, "We don't have to go
through a socialist phase."
January 29, 1972, "We're going to
put down our guns and work
within the system."
Direct Contradiction
This tactic is in direct
contradiction to "the idea,
according to the Panthers ... to
bring people to a "revolutionary
consciousness" by serving them
and having them participate in
community programs."
An organization cannot "work
within the system" or "put down
its guns" and still be revolutionary
or build revolutionary
consciousness. As Mao Tse-tung
points out, "a revolution is an
insurrection, an act of violence by
which one class overthrows

another," and to overthrow any

front of Venceremos members
and other community people who
find a need to serve poor and
working people. Venceremos runs
and serves in other child care
centers and food co-ops in the
Bay Area, particularly in the
People's Medical Center in East
Redwood City.
Venceremos is constantly
trying to create new programs to
serve the people. It is ISCCF that
is one-sided because it only sees
one side of the dialectic, serve the
people; Venceremos sees the
dialectic as double sided: serve the
people, stop the pig.
Opponents To Child Care
In talking about the opponents
of their child care program,
Cherry states they are "people
who sit off to the side and

criticize, who try in various ways
to say that these programs are
wrong without investigating for
themselves or being themselves
involved. And we get it from both
sides, both reactionaries and
so-called revolutionaries who call
you 'racist sissy' as you walk by."
First of all, Venceremos doesn't
criticize the survival programs per
se. What they criticize is the fact
that those programs are more and
more being co-opted into and by
the establishment, i.e. by
capitalism. As for the 'racist sissy'
part, Venceremos labeled the
(white) members who split with
that term because they blindly
followed the leadership of Huey
P. Newton without seeing the
practice that came out of his
leadership, and because they
would accept no criticism and
refused to struggle over the issue
to find unity.
The cause of the split was not
just "a matter of tactics." The
split occurred because those
members mentioned above who
split refused to recognize the fact
that the Black Panther Party was
becoming totally revisionist, that
it had given up the idea of even
thinking about tactics for a
revolution.
The transformation to
revisionism is easily traceable in
Huey P. Newton's speeches: of
May 29, 1971, "What we are
interested in is for it (the system)
to correct itself as much as it can
do and after that if it doesn't do
everything that the people think is
necessary then we'll think about
reorganizing things. November 29,
1971, "We don't have to go
through a socialist phase."
January 29, 1972, "We're going to
put down our guns and work
within the system."
Direct Contradiction
This tactic is in direct
contradiction to "the idea,
according to the Panthers ... to
bring people to a "revolutionary
consciousness" by serving them
and having them participate in
community programs."
An organization cannot "work
within the system" or "put down
its guns" and still be revolutionary
or build revolutionary
consciousness. As Mao Tse-tung
points out, "a revolution is an
insurrection, an act of violence by
which one class overthrows

another," and to overthrow any
oppressive government takes guns.
History shows that no ruling
class has ever given up its power
peacefully. To "put down our
guns" means that the Panther and
ISCCF programs are open to
attack by the police, who remain
convinced that the Panthers are
out to destroy them.
To "work within the system"
with firm belief that real change is
possible by that route, is to admit
that revolution in the U.S. is
impossible because, as Felix
Greene, who has studied
American political socio-economic
systems for years, puts it, ". . .the
fake democracy of capitalism can
never by its very nature bring
about the fundamental changes
that are needed now, for what is
called democracy is merely the
way in which greed and
exploitation have been
institutionalized; it is, in other
words, designed precisely to
prevent fundamental change."
(The Enemy, p. 311)
Within The System
The above should not be taken
to mean that Venceremos is
totally against working within the
system. I have witnessed
Venceremos work with city
councils, student referendums, the
ASSU Senate, and as teachers at
Stanford and elsewhere.
Venceremos sees working
within the system as part of an
overall strategy to effect political
change, whereas ISCCF believes in
only working within the system.
Venceremos understands that
fundamental change will only
come when the capitalist ruling
class is no longer in power.
If a revolutionary organization
does not stick to its
Marxist-Leninist ideology, it will
be co-opted by capitalism, as the
Communist Party in the U.S. has
been and the Black Panther Party
and ISCCF are being. If the
members of an organization don't
"sit back and read . . . Marx and
Lenin" (Sharon Winslow) at least
daily, they will fall to revisionist
tactics of "working within the
system" and "put(ting) down our
guns." Just as practice determines
theory, does theory determine
practice.
So it should be clear that the
principal antagonism between
Venceremos and ISCCF and the
Black Panther Party is not over a
question of survival programs.
Both organizations have those. It
is rather a question of the tactic
of the latter organization of
working only within the system
for minor reforms, and
Venceremos' tactic of
fundamental change, "complete
satisfaction" (in the words of the
late Panther Fred Hampton)—by
any means necessary.

Although I'm not a member of
Venceremos, I feel it necessary to
reply to some of the accusations
and innuendos about Venceremos
made by Miriam Cherry and
Sharon Winslow of the
In t e rco m munal Survival
Committee to Combat Fascism in
the Daily articles on ISCCF by
Gary Atkins.
I've been studying the theory
and practice and talking with
members of both organizations
for quite a while now and have
come to realize that the main
contradiction between the two is
that ISCCF and the Black Panther
Party are revisionist, whereas
Venceremos is revolutionary.
Miriam Cherry claims, in the
first article, that "We saw
one-sided thinking in Venceremos,
a one-sided view that revolution is
based just on picking up the
gun—or talking about picking up
the gun." Venceremos made many
mistakes last year, such as failure
to work within a united front and
abandoning the student
movement, but they have never
seen revolution or serving the
people only in terms of "picking
up the gun."
I myself work at the Sojourner
Truth child care center in Palo
Alto, which is run by a united
front of Venceremos members
and other community people who
find a need to serve poor and
working people. Venceremos runs
and serves in other child care
