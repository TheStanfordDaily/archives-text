# Pitzer Returns To Teaching Role
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT (Last of a Series) 
Kenneth Pitzer denies that the Board of Trustees
ever asked for his resignation as Stanford's
president.
"Come June, 1970, I simply had a discussion
with a few of the Board members in which 1 raised
the question myself," Pitzer recalled last week at
UC Berkeley, where he is now a Chemistry
professor.
"1 told them I was wondering whether the
sensible thing to do is to continue in this role or
not," Pitzer said. "1 got certain reactions, but that's
as far as I can go on the story."
But it is also perfectly clear that Pitzer had
become an unpopular president in many quarters by
June of 1971. The quiet, nervous-appearing man
never managed to build a constituency of supporters
among faculty or students. Trustees and many
alumni opposed his outspoken comments against
the war and charged that he was not taking strong
enough action against campus disruptions.
Asked if pressures to resign ever came from
influential alumni, Pitzer would only say, "I got lots
of letters and opinions from all sorts of sources, but
I'm not going to go into that."
Differences With Staff?
Pitzer was equally reluctant to talk about another
area—whether he had problems dealing with his own

administrative staff. "There were various differences
in detail, but very frankly I don't think it would be
useful to go into those detailed differences about
who thought what under what particular
circumstances."
President Richard Lyman, who was provost under
Pitzer, has avoided the type of outspoken
statements on national issues which characterized
Pitzer's term. Asked if Lyman ever suggested that he
not speak out, Pitzer said, "No, I don't know that
he ever did that."
Lyman has also taken a less conciliatory tone
toward campus sit-ins. Asked if Lyman urged such
an approach during Pitzer's term, the ex-president
said only, "Certainly one gains by experience in this
whole area. As time goes on, the appropriate way of
doing things at one time isn't necessarily the
appropriate way to do things sometime later."
There were also reports that the administration
staff was more loyal to Lyman than Pitzer because
they shared his style and because Lyman was a
veteran Stanford official who had been passed over
for the presidency.
"Minor Porblems"
Pitzer commented, "I think when any group has
sort of been working together for a long time and
somebody else comes in who is somewaht different,
there can't help but be some minor problems. But I
certainly wouldn't draw any particular attention to

that."
Asked if the administrative staff was really
"Lyman's team," Pitzer explained, "There's no
question but that Dr. Lyman as Provost had a staff,
including particularly Dr. Rosenzweig, who had
been working with him closely for a considerable
period of time. They had adjusted styles and so
forth, and this had its perfectly natural role. On the
other hand, Siena was my appointment, that was
later."
Pitzer said that by the time he resigned, changing
campus attitudes had made impossible his hopes to
mediate disputes solely through internal judicial
systems.
Maintain Order
"But an institution is in real trouble if it has to
routinely call upon outside forces to maintain
internal order," he added. Pitzer said he is no longer
close enough to Stanford events to know if the
University is currently in that kind of trouble.
Pitzer also commented that he did not know
enough of the details to comment on this year's
ouster of revolutionary Professor H. Bruc? Franklin.
But he said he was confident that the faculty and
administration "are perfectly steadfast in punishing
only clear acts of incitement, rather than dissident
opinions."

DECISIONS, DECISIONS—Former president Kenneth Pitzer emerges from a
January, 1970 Trustees' meeting which decided that the controversial Stanford
Research Institute would buy its independence from the university.
Asked if charges against Franklin
were considered during his
administration, Pitzer said, "There was
no specific consideration of charges
against Bruce Franklin. There was
consideration, after the spring
episodes—the rallies that led to
trashing and so on—as to whether
something that was said or done in the
rallies constituted incitement to riot,
without particular reference to any
one individual.
"We realized that incitement to riot
was an awfully difficult offense to
judge and to deal with, and, in effect,
nothing substantial was done about
it," Pitzer revealed.
Educational Reform
Looking back at his Stanford term,
Pitzer said it was a disappointment
that he did not find more time to
devote to educational reform and"the
academic side of things."
Noting the addition of recent
alumni to the Board of Trustees and
the expansion of student membership
on trustee committees, Pitzer said the
revisions "came out very close" to
what he advocated during his term as
president.
Pitzer said he told the trustees they
"ought to hear the views of students
and faculty firsthand" but that he
"opposed having current students or
current faculty on the trustees."
He argued that student or faculty
trustees would result in "an
unfortunate confusion of roles and
responsibilities" and an "undue mixing
of constituencies."
Cyclical Nature
Discussing the nature of campus
protests, Pitzer said his "best
hypothesis at the moment" is that
"this sort of disruptive activity has a
cyclical nature to it.
"Most of the campuses that have
had serious disruptions in the past
seem to have quieted down now."
Pitzer suggested. "It looks to me like
Stanford just got into the cycle several
years later, and hopefully may come
out of it pretty completely, even
though a cople of years later."
After leaving Stanford, Pitzer spent
most of a year travelling and "catching
up with what had been happening in
science in interesting and pleasant
places."
He and his wife visited the
University of Iniana and Cambridge,
England before Pitzer went back to
teaching at UC Berkeley in September.
Pitzer said he returned to Berkeley,

where he taught before becoming
president of Rice University in 1961,
because "the folks here were very
persuasive and cordial in suggesting
that I come back, where I have many
old ties and many old friends."
Pitzer confirmed that Stanford's
chemistry department and chemical
engineers also urged him to stay here
as a professor after he quit the
presidency.
He explained that "there couldn't
help but have been awkward
moments" for a president who became
a professor in the same university. He
said those problems were a "secondary
but still significant component in an
overall decision" to go to Berkeley
instead.
The chemist said the received
several offers from outside the
academic world, including the
leadership of a foundation, but that
those proposals did not seem as
"worthwhile and interesting" as
teaching.
Pitzer revealed that he was also
offered several new jobs in college
administrations after he quit the
Stanford presidency.
But he had faced enough of the
problems of a college president: "I just
turned those offers off completely.
When reminded of the time a
masked protestor spattered him with
red paint while he was dining at Grove
House, Pitzer smiled, "How could I
forget it? Let's say, I'm not expecting
to go through it again."

close enough to Stanford events to know if the
University is currently in that kind of trouble.
Pitzer also commented that he did not know
enough of the details to comment on this year's
ouster of revolutionary Professor H. Bruc? Franklin.
But he said he was confident that the faculty and
administration "are perfectly steadfast in punishing
only clear acts of incitement, rather than dissident
opinions."

DECISIONS, DECISIONS—Former president Kenneth Pitzer emerges from a
January, 1970 Trustees' meeting which decided that the controversial Stanford
Research Institute would buy its independence from the university.
Asked if charges against Franklin
were considered during his
administration, Pitzer said, "There was
no specific consideration of charges
against Bruce Franklin. There was
consideration, after the spring
episodes—the rallies that led to
trashing and so on—as to whether
something that was said or done in the
rallies constituted incitement to riot,
without particular reference to any
one individual.
"We realized that incitement to riot
was an awfully difficult offense to
judge and to deal with, and, in effect,
nothing substantial was done about
it," Pitzer revealed.
Educational Reform
Looking back at his Stanford term,
Pitzer said it was a disappointment
that he did not find more time to
devote to educational reform and"the
academic side of things."
Noting the addition of recent
alumni to the Board of Trustees and
the expansion of student membership
on trustee committees, Pitzer said the
revisions "came out very close" to
what he advocated during his term as
president.
Pitzer said he told the trustees they
"ought to hear the views of students
and faculty firsthand" but that he
"opposed having current students or
current faculty on the trustees."
He argued that student or faculty
trustees would result in "an
unfortunate confusion of roles and
responsibilities" and an "undue mixing
of constituencies."
Cyclical Nature
Discussing the nature of campus
protests, Pitzer said his "best
hypothesis at the moment" is that
"this sort of disruptive activity has a
cyclical nature to it.
"Most of the campuses that have
had serious disruptions in the past
seem to have quieted down now."
Pitzer suggested. "It looks to me like
Stanford just got into the cycle several
years later, and hopefully may come
out of it pretty completely, even
though a cople of years later."
After leaving Stanford, Pitzer spent
most of a year travelling and "catching
up with what had been happening in
science in interesting and pleasant
places."
He and his wife visited the
University of Iniana and Cambridge,
England before Pitzer went back to
teaching at UC Berkeley in September.
Pitzer said he returned to Berkeley,

where he taught before becoming
president of Rice University in 1961,
because "the folks here were very
persuasive and cordial in suggesting
that I come back, where I have many
old ties and many old friends."
Pitzer confirmed that Stanford's
chemistry department and chemical
engineers also urged him to stay here
as a professor after he quit the
presidency.
He explained that "there couldn't
help but have been awkward
moments" for a president who became
a professor in the same university. He
said those problems were a "secondary
but still significant component in an
overall decision" to go to Berkeley
instead.
The chemist said the received
several offers from outside the
academic world, including the
leadership of a foundation, but that
those proposals did not seem as
"worthwhile and interesting" as
teaching.
Pitzer revealed that he was also
offered several new jobs in college
administrations after he quit the
Stanford presidency.
But he had faced enough of the
problems of a college president: "I just
turned those offers off completely.
When reminded of the time a
masked protestor spattered him with
red paint while he was dining at Grove
House, Pitzer smiled, "How could I
forget it? Let's say, I'm not expecting
to go through it again."
Kenneth Pitzer denies that the Board of Trustees
ever asked for his resignation as Stanford's
president.
"Come June, 1970, I simply had a discussion
with a few of the Board members in which 1 raised
the question myself," Pitzer recalled last week at
UC Berkeley, where he is now a Chemistry
professor.
"1 told them I was wondering whether the
sensible thing to do is to continue in this role or
not," Pitzer said. "1 got certain reactions, but that's
as far as I can go on the story."
But it is also perfectly clear that Pitzer had
become an unpopular president in many quarters by
June of 1971. The quiet, nervous-appearing man
never managed to build a constituency of supporters
among faculty or students. Trustees and many
alumni opposed his outspoken comments against
the war and charged that he was not taking strong
enough action against campus disruptions.
Asked if pressures to resign ever came from
influential alumni, Pitzer would only say, "I got lots
of letters and opinions from all sorts of sources, but
I'm not going to go into that."
Differences With Staff?
Pitzer was equally reluctant to talk about another
area—whether he had problems dealing with his own

administrative staff. "There were various differences
in detail, but very frankly I don't think it would be
useful to go into those detailed differences about
who thought what under what particular
circumstances."
President Richard Lyman, who was provost under
Pitzer, has avoided the type of outspoken
statements on national issues which characterized
Pitzer's term. Asked if Lyman ever suggested that he
not speak out, Pitzer said, "No, I don't know that
he ever did that."
Lyman has also taken a less conciliatory tone
toward campus sit-ins. Asked if Lyman urged such
an approach during Pitzer's term, the ex-president
said only, "Certainly one gains by experience in this
whole area. As time goes on, the appropriate way of
doing things at one time isn't necessarily the
appropriate way to do things sometime later."
There were also reports that the administration
staff was more loyal to Lyman than Pitzer because
they shared his style and because Lyman was a
veteran Stanford official who had been passed over
for the presidency.
"Minor Porblems"
Pitzer commented, "I think when any group has
sort of been working together for a long time and
somebody else comes in who is somewaht different,
there can't help but be some minor problems. But I
certainly wouldn't draw any particular attention to

that."
Asked if the administrative staff was really
"Lyman's team," Pitzer explained, "There's no
question but that Dr. Lyman as Provost had a staff,
including particularly Dr. Rosenzweig, who had
been working with him closely for a considerable
period of time. They had adjusted styles and so
forth, and this had its perfectly natural role. On the
other hand, Siena was my appointment, that was
later."
Pitzer said that by the time he resigned, changing
campus attitudes had made impossible his hopes to
mediate disputes solely through internal judicial
systems.
Maintain Order
"But an institution is in real trouble if it has to
routinely call upon outside forces to maintain
internal order," he added. Pitzer said he is no longer
close enough to Stanford events to know if the
University is currently in that kind of trouble.
Pitzer also commented that he did not know
enough of the details to comment on this year's
ouster of revolutionary Professor H. Bruc? Franklin.

a professor in the same university. He
said those problems were a "secondary
but still significant component in an
overall decision" to go to Berkeley
instead.
The chemist said the received
several offers from outside the
academic world, including the
leadership of a foundation, but that
those proposals did not seem as
"worthwhile and interesting" as
teaching.
Pitzer revealed that he was also
offered several new jobs in college
administrations after he quit the
Stanford presidency.
But he had faced enough of the
problems of a college president: "I just
turned those offers off completely.
When reminded of the time a
masked protestor spattered him with
red paint while he was dining at Grove
House, Pitzer smiled, "How could I
forget it? Let's say, I'm not expecting
to go through it again."
Kenneth Pitzer denies that the Board of Trustees
ever asked for his resignation as Stanford's
president.
"Come June, 1970, I simply had a discussion
with a few of the Board members in which 1 raised
the question myself," Pitzer recalled last week at
UC Berkeley, where he is now a Chemistry
professor.
"1 told them I was wondering whether the
sensible thing to do is to continue in this role or
not," Pitzer said. "1 got certain reactions, but that's
as far as I can go on the story."
But it is also perfectly clear that Pitzer had
become an unpopular president in many quarters by
June of 1971. The quiet, nervous-appearing man
never managed to build a constituency of supporters
among faculty or students. Trustees and many
alumni opposed his outspoken comments against
the war and charged that he was not taking strong
enough action against campus disruptions.
Asked if pressures to resign ever came from
influential alumni, Pitzer would only say, "I got lots
of letters and opinions from all sorts of sources, but
I'm not going to go into that."
Differences With Staff?
Pitzer was equally reluctant to talk about another
area—whether he had problems dealing with his own

administrative staff. "There were various differences
in detail, but very frankly I don't think it would be
useful to go into those detailed differences about
who thought what under what particular
circumstances."
President Richard Lyman, who was provost under
Pitzer, has avoided the type of outspoken
statements on national issues which characterized
Pitzer's term. Asked if Lyman ever suggested that he
not speak out, Pitzer said, "No, I don't know that
he ever did that."
Lyman has also taken a less conciliatory tone
toward campus sit-ins. Asked if Lyman urged such
an approach during Pitzer's term, the ex-president
said only, "Certainly one gains by experience in this
whole area. As time goes on, the appropriate way of
doing things at one time isn't necessarily the
appropriate way to do things sometime later."
There were also reports that the administration
staff was more loyal to Lyman than Pitzer because
they shared his style and because Lyman was a
veteran Stanford official who had been passed over
for the presidency.
"Minor Porblems"
Pitzer commented, "I think when any group has
sort of been working together for a long time and
somebody else comes in who is somewaht different,
there can't help but be some minor problems. But I
certainly wouldn't draw any particular attention to

that."
Asked if the administrative staff was really
"Lyman's team," Pitzer explained, "There's no
question but that Dr. Lyman as Provost had a staff,
including particularly Dr. Rosenzweig, who had
been working with him closely for a considerable
period of time. They had adjusted styles and so
forth, and this had its perfectly natural role. On the
other hand, Siena was my appointment, that was
later."
Pitzer said that by the time he resigned, changing
campus attitudes had made impossible his hopes to
mediate disputes solely through internal judicial
systems.
Maintain Order
"But an institution is in real trouble if it has to
routinely call upon outside forces to maintain
internal order," he added. Pitzer said he is no longer
close enough to Stanford events to know if the
University is currently in that kind of trouble.
Pitzer also commented that he did not know
enough of the details to comment on this year's
ouster of revolutionary Professor H. Bruc? Franklin.
But he said he was confident that the faculty and
administration "are perfectly steadfast in punishing
only clear acts of incitement, rather than dissident
opinions."

DECISIONS, DECISIONS—Former president Kenneth Pitzer emerges from a
January, 1970 Trustees' meeting which decided that the controversial Stanford
Research Institute would buy its independence from the university.
Asked if charges against Franklin
were considered during his
administration, Pitzer said, "There was
no specific consideration of charges
against Bruce Franklin. There was
consideration, after the spring
episodes—the rallies that led to
trashing and so on—as to whether
something that was said or done in the
rallies constituted incitement to riot,
without particular reference to any
one individual.
"We realized that incitement to riot
was an awfully difficult offense to
judge and to deal with, and, in effect,
nothing substantial was done about
it," Pitzer revealed.
Educational Reform
Looking back at his Stanford term,
Pitzer said it was a disappointment
that he did not find more time to
devote to educational reform and"the
academic side of things."
Noting the addition of recent
alumni to the Board of Trustees and
the expansion of student membership
on trustee committees, Pitzer said the
revisions "came out very close" to
what he advocated during his term as
president.
Pitzer said he told the trustees they
"ought to hear the views of students
and faculty firsthand" but that he
"opposed having current students or
current faculty on the trustees."
He argued that student or faculty
trustees would result in "an
unfortunate confusion of roles and
responsibilities" and an "undue mixing
of constituencies."
Cyclical Nature
Discussing the nature of campus
protests, Pitzer said his "best
hypothesis at the moment" is that
"this sort of disruptive activity has a
cyclical nature to it.
"Most of the campuses that have
had serious disruptions in the past
seem to have quieted down now."
Pitzer suggested. "It looks to me like
Stanford just got into the cycle several
years later, and hopefully may come
out of it pretty completely, even
though a cople of years later."
After leaving Stanford, Pitzer spent
most of a year travelling and "catching
up with what had been happening in
science in interesting and pleasant
places."
He and his wife visited the
University of Iniana and Cambridge,
England before Pitzer went back to
teaching at UC Berkeley in September.
Pitzer said he returned to Berkeley,

where he taught before becoming
president of Rice University in 1961,
because "the folks here were very
persuasive and cordial in suggesting
that I come back, where I have many
old ties and many old friends."
Pitzer confirmed that Stanford's
chemistry department and chemical
engineers also urged him to stay here
as a professor after he quit the
presidency.
He explained that "there couldn't
help but have been awkward
moments" for a president who became
a professor in the same university. He
said those problems were a "secondary
but still significant component in an
