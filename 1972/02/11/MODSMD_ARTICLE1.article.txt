# Pitzer Returns To Teaching Role
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT (Last of a Series) 
Kenneth Pitzer denies that the Board of Trustees
ever asked for his resignation as Stanford's
president.
"Come June, 1970, I simply had a discussion
with a few of the Board members in which 1 raised
the question myself," Pitzer recalled last week at
UC Berkeley, where he is now a Chemistry
professor.
"1 told them I was wondering whether the
sensible thing to do is to continue in this role or
not," Pitzer said. "1 got certain reactions, but that's
as far as I can go on the story."
But it is also perfectly clear that Pitzer had
become an unpopular president in many quarters by
June of 1971. The quiet, nervous-appearing man
never managed to build a constituency of supporters
among faculty or students. Trustees and many
alumni opposed his outspoken comments against
the war and charged that he was not taking strong
enough action against campus disruptions.
Asked if pressures to resign ever came from
influential alumni, Pitzer would only say, "I got lots
of letters and opinions from all sorts of sources, but
I'm not going to go into that."
Differences With Staff?
Pitzer was equally reluctant to talk about another
area—whether he had problems dealing with his own

administrative staff. "There were various differences
in detail, but very frankly I don't think it would be
useful to go into those detailed differences about
who thought what under what particular
circumstances."
President Richard Lyman, who was provost under
Pitzer, has avoided the type of outspoken
statements on national issues which characterized
Pitzer's term. Asked if Lyman ever suggested that he
not speak out, Pitzer said, "No, I don't know that
he ever did that."
Lyman has also taken a less conciliatory tone
toward campus sit-ins. Asked if Lyman urged such
an approach during Pitzer's term, the ex-president
said only, "Certainly one gains by experience in this
whole area. As time goes on, the appropriate way of
doing things at one time isn't necessarily the
appropriate way to do things sometime later."
There were also reports that the administration
staff was more loyal to Lyman than Pitzer because
they shared his style and because Lyman was a
veteran Stanford official who had been passed over
for the presidency.
"Minor Porblems"
Pitzer commented, "I think when any group has
sort of been working together for a long time and
somebody else comes in who is somewaht different,
there can't help but be some minor problems. But I
certainly wouldn't draw any particular attention to

that."
Asked if the administrative staff was really
"Lyman's team," Pitzer explained, "There's no
question but that Dr. Lyman as Provost had a staff,
including particularly Dr. Rosenzweig, who had
been working with him closely for a considerable
period of time. They had adjusted styles and so
forth, and this had its perfectly natural role. On the
other hand, Siena was my appointment, that was
later."
Pitzer said that by the time he resigned, changing
campus attitudes had made impossible his hopes to
mediate disputes solely through internal judicial
systems.
Maintain Order
"But an institution is in real trouble if it has to
routinely call upon outside forces to maintain
internal order," he added. Pitzer said he is no longer
close enough to Stanford events to know if the
University is currently in that kind of trouble.
Pitzer also commented that he did not know
enough of the details to comment on this year's
ouster of revolutionary Professor H. Bruc? Franklin.
But he said he was confident that the faculty and
administration "are perfectly steadfast in punishing
only clear acts of incitement, rather than dissident
opinions."
