In a retrospective analysis of
the Franklin case (Daily, Feb. 8)
Dan Brenner argues that a
communication from 24
professors in Earth Sciences to the
Advisory Board (Daily, Dec. 3)
was an "ominous" threat to due
process because (a) it was signed
collectively rather than
individually and because (b) it
urged the Board to look beyond
the specific issues to the broader
context.
If Brenner had bothered to
look a little further he would have
found, for example, that a month
earlier (Daily, Nov. 2) members of
the German department published
a manifesto ostensibly in support
of Franklin which (a) was signed
collectively rather than
individually and (b) urged the
Advisory Board to look beyond

the specific issues to the broader
fact that (as they saw it) Franklin
was protesting the evils of an
oppressive institution.
Do such communications
constitute a threat to due process?
I think not. The significant point
is that Brenner's analysis, if it has
any force, is clearly double-edged;
it cuts at least as strongly against
Franklin as in his favor. Yet
Brenner ignores this. Moreover a
surprising number of the
arguments advanced on Franklin's
behalf have exhibited this same
pattern: when one tries to apply
them seriously, they backfire,
serving to discredit Franklin's
position rather than to support it.
It becomes increasingly
apparent that what tipped the
scales against Professor Franklin
at the Advisory Board hearings
was Franklin himself—with a
strong assist from his defenders,
advisers and supporters. Would
this fact, if established, discredit
the decision of the Advisory
Board? Certainly not, if one
recalls Jerome Frank's dictum
that judges cannot be robots, and

it is only by a false abstraction
that one could expect them to be.

Will you do the people on this
campus a big favor? Please stop
devoting eight-tenths of your
front page and editorial page to
the stupid, arrogant, self-righteous
antics and rantings of a small
group of thugs. They do not
represent Stanford students,
faculty or staff—nor even "the
people." They represent only the
few psychopaths in any society
who delight in smashing windows,
bullying others, stealing property,
disrupting classes and gaining
attention. They are incipient
fascists, and only the Daily is
taking them seriously.

recalls Jerome Frank's dictum
that judges cannot be robots, and

it is only by a false abstraction
that one could expect them to be.

A Big Favor
Editor, THE DAILY:
Will you do the people on this
campus a big favor? Please stop
devoting eight-tenths of your
front page and editorial page to
the stupid, arrogant, self-righteous
antics and rantings of a small
group of thugs. They do not
represent Stanford students,
faculty or staff—nor even "the
people." They represent only the
few psychopaths in any society
who delight in smashing windows,
bullying others, stealing property,
disrupting classes and gaining
attention. They are incipient
fascists, and only the Daily is
taking them seriously.
