Farcical Railroad
Editor, THE DAILY:
It is hard to believe that
everyone in the Stanford
community that has any interest
in justice and is committed to
ending the war in Vietnam has not
in some dramatic way condemned
the fascist farcical railroad
Schwartz, Rosenswine, and
Lie-man call the CJP.
What we are witnessing in
the case of Downey, Lee, Loeb,
and Knutson is political repression
at an advanced stage. The CJP is
nothing but a Kangaroo court.
Wake up people, the defendants
are receiving no legal safeguards
whatsoever. The CJP rules were
written up and devised by
Schwartz and Rosenswine. The

"neutral" hearing officer (Altree)
used to collect funds for Stanford
(giving her a good understanding
of who it would be profitable to
expel as far as donations go). The
defendants never get to see the
Panel, to present their case. The
chairman of the CJP, Kaplan, has
been quoted as saying that he
hates to judge in this case but
would rather do so than see the
university run by a bunch of
thugs. (Who are these thugs,
anyway? For anyone who has
been to a demonstration recently
knows who the real thugs are.
It's Tiny Tamm and his
Titillating Toe-tapping Thugs.)
Also, two of the faculty on the
board have signed the Open
Recruitment statement which in
this case is already judging their

guilt.
The railroad is now closed, and
anyone attempting to get on will
probably be charged by Schwartz
with something. Perhaps
obstructing a railroad, robbery, a
hold-up. Who knows? It is crucial
that people who scoff at all this
should listen to the trial on
KZSU, Thursday at 1:30 (as long
as that is still allowed) to hear for
themselves (we aren't entitled to
see for ourselves anymore).

Thankful
Editor, THE DAILY:
Stanford is fortunate,
particularly in times of crisis, to

have Richard Lyman and Larry
Diamond in positions of
leadership.
Some might question speaking
of these two in the same context,
since they sometimes find
themselves on opposite sides of
issues. I do not, of course, agree
with everything that both or
either of them say and do; but
then one ought to be wary of
anyone who agrees with
everything someone else says and
does.
But they appear to have in
common a determination to
condemn the often destructive,
apparently aimless "ego-trips
masquerading as revolution," and
to distinguish them from serious
efforts to improve the world and
the University. They remind us
that in seeking the perfect, it is
counter-productive to destroy the
good.
They are aware that the
presence of riot police on the
campus is a defeat for the entire
University—students, faculty, and
staff—not just for some ill-defined
inner circle of administrators.
They have in common the
determination not to "sell the
University's soul" to gain $260
million in gifts or to placate the
amateur guerrillas who, as Mr.
Diamond pointed out, belong in
jail.
They realize that the Stanford
administration and trustees did
not cause everything that is wrong
with the world, and hence cannot
solve all problems.
They remind us that the
scourge of war and militarism, will
not be brought under control by
starting a new war on the campus.
Thank you, Messrs. Lyman and
Diamond. "Blessed are the
peacemakers for they shall catch
hell from both sides."

Facts
Editor, THE DAILY:
Several times in the last week
uninformed statements regarding
the source of Stanford's lands
have appeared on these pages. For
the record here are the facts.
Leland Stanford purchased
what now comprises the Stanford
Campus from legal title holders to
the land. The legal owners
purchased the land from squatters
who acquired their rights by
"taking" and from other legal

owners who acquired their rights
by purchase, honest and
sometimes dishonest. Both parties
cheated (or dealt honestly) with
the Mexicans who in the days of
Spanish rule "appropriated" the
land from the Indians. There is no
record to indicate that the Indians
negotiated transfer of the land
from the resident wildlife.
There are those who will say
that Leland Stanford purchased
the land with money stolen from
the working class and sacrificed
the lives of "thousands" of
Chinese laborers in the process of
acquiring his wealth. Perhaps his
money was tainted - perhaps not.
That "thousands" of Chinese died
during construction of the
railroad is a figment of the
imagination.
History is replete with
conquests (thefts, if you will) of
land and exploitation of the
vanquished. None of us are free of
guilt, if we subscribe to the
current rationale that justifies
raping Stanford. Rather than
sophomoric exercises in petty
theft and Mafia style intimidation
would not mankind be better
served if we worked for a better
tomorrow rather than aimlessly
destroying today?

Insolence Of The Vulgar
Editor, THE DAILY:
I feel that I must protest in
some way the actions of a
(relatively) small number of
people at the 7:00 p.m. screening
of Thomas Mann's "Death in
Venice" this past Sunday. Their
lack of simple consideration and
common courtesy was highly
successful in destroying
Visconti's artwork for me, and, I
am sure, for many other members
of the audience.
Perhaps, on a Sunday evening
at Stanford University, some
people do go to the Sunday Flicks
expecting nothing more than a
mindless chronicle of the old
cliches: sex, crime and violence.
Perhaps these people want
nothing more than the
opportunity to shut off their
brains and be passively
entertained for two hours. If such
is the case, their disappointment
in "Death in Venice" is
understandable; not only is the
film devoid of nude scenes and

war footage, it contains only a
minimum of dialogue. All that
remains is excellent acting, some
outstanding cinematography, the
beauty of Venice, and the serenity
of Gustav Mahler's music.
But while I can, perhaps,
understand their motivation, I
cannot understand these few
people's infantile behavior. Why
in their disappointment, did they
not choose to leave the
auditorium, but rather to remain,
and thus prolong their suffering?
And having chosen to stay, why
did they insist upon destroying
for the rest of the audience the
atmosphere created by the film?
It is a sad commentary on the
quality of Stanford's student
body that it contains a not
insignificant number of people,
not only whose lack of taste is
dismaying, but whose lack of
respect for their fellow students
would allow them to express their
boredom, in a theater, in the
manner to which they have
become accustomed, after many
long quarters of practice, in White
Plaza and wherever evil lurks on
campus.
Perhaps my protest may take a
form first committed to paper by
William Hazlitt: "The insolence of
the vulgar is in proportion to their
ignorance: they treat everything
with contempt which they do not
understand."

Brilliant Symphony Review
Editor, THE DAILY:
If in Friday's review of the San
Francisco Symphony there was
anything worthy of complaint, it
might be that the total effect of
the article was a bit on the
loquacious side. Otherwise, the
paragraphs were extremely
perceptive, and followed the form
of an intellectual review very well.
The author is a very skilled if
not brilliant reviewer, who got as
much pompous panning out of a
favorable review as anyone ever
has. Nothing seemed hackneyed,
even the traditional nit-picking
criticism of a concert which the
author apparently enjoyed was
executed with freshness, sparkle
and originality. The second
paragraph, inspired by the
author's dictionary, is indeed a
tribute to the reviewer's art, and

takes itself remarkably seriously.
The criticism was delicate enough,
though I have seen more subtle jabs
in Time magazine's book review
pages.
The author is surprisingly
relaxed in his role, and is to be
congratulated for his scrupulous
deviations in a style which is
probably taken for granted. It was
an amusing article indeed.

Coping Not Sex-Linked
Editor, THE DAILY:
John Kaplan's remark
concerning damage to Lillian
Altree's car, quoted in the Feb. 8
Daily, deserves some comment.
To say "If I'd known anything
like this would happen, I wouldn't
have appointed a woman," is
typical of the unthinking sexism
that permeates our society. Gluing
the doorlocks of Ms. Altree's car
was a political act totally
unconnected with the sex of the
car's owner.
Kaplan also seems to imply that
a woman is not able to cope with
stress situations and,
concomitantly, there is more
disorder because a woman is in
charge. In reply we must
emphasize that the incidents at
the hearing occurred independent
ly of the sex of the hearing officer,
and we remind Kaplan that coping
is not a sex-linked characteristic.

Commendation
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Faculty Advisory Board is
to be commended for its decision
recommending dismissal of
Associate Professor Franklin. His
attempts to twist and use
academic freedom to serve his
own selfish ends certainly justify
this decision. The remarks he
made after the announcement
leave little to the imagination as
to what he was attempting to
accomplish.

They are aware that the

They remind us that the

Facts
Editor, THE DAILY:
Several times in the last week
uninformed statements regarding
the source of Stanford's lands
have appeared on these pages. For
the record here are the facts.
Leland Stanford purchased
what now comprises the Stanford
Campus from legal title holders to
the land. The legal owners
purchased the land from squatters
who acquired their rights by
"taking" and from other legal

owners who acquired their rights
by purchase, honest and
sometimes dishonest. Both parties
cheated (or dealt honestly) with
the Mexicans who in the days of
Spanish rule "appropriated" the
land from the Indians. There is no
record to indicate that the Indians
negotiated transfer of the land
from the resident wildlife.
There are those who will say
that Leland Stanford purchased
the land with money stolen from
the working class and sacrificed
the lives of "thousands" of
Chinese laborers in the process of
acquiring his wealth. Perhaps his
money was tainted - perhaps not.
That "thousands" of Chinese died
during construction of the
railroad is a figment of the
imagination.
History is replete with
conquests (thefts, if you will) of
land and exploitation of the
vanquished. None of us are free of
guilt, if we subscribe to the
current rationale that justifies
raping Stanford. Rather than
sophomoric exercises in petty
theft and Mafia style intimidation
would not mankind be better
served if we worked for a better
tomorrow rather than aimlessly
destroying today?

Insolence Of The Vulgar
Editor, THE DAILY:
I feel that I must protest in
some way the actions of a
(relatively) small number of
people at the 7:00 p.m. screening
of Thomas Mann's "Death in
Venice" this past Sunday. Their
lack of simple consideration and
common courtesy was highly
successful in destroying
Visconti's artwork for me, and, I
am sure, for many other members
of the audience.
Perhaps, on a Sunday evening
at Stanford University, some
people do go to the Sunday Flicks
expecting nothing more than a
mindless chronicle of the old
cliches: sex, crime and violence.
Perhaps these people want
nothing more than the
opportunity to shut off their
brains and be passively
entertained for two hours. If such
is the case, their disappointment
in "Death in Venice" is
understandable; not only is the
film devoid of nude scenes and

war footage, it contains only a
minimum of dialogue. All that
remains is excellent acting, some
outstanding cinematography, the
beauty of Venice, and the serenity
of Gustav Mahler's music.
But while I can, perhaps,
understand their motivation, I
cannot understand these few
people's infantile behavior. Why
in their disappointment, did they
not choose to leave the
auditorium, but rather to remain,
and thus prolong their suffering?
And having chosen to stay, why
did they insist upon destroying
for the rest of the audience the
atmosphere created by the film?
It is a sad commentary on the
quality of Stanford's student
body that it contains a not
insignificant number of people,
not only whose lack of taste is
dismaying, but whose lack of
respect for their fellow students
would allow them to express their
boredom, in a theater, in the
manner to which they have
become accustomed, after many
long quarters of practice, in White
Plaza and wherever evil lurks on
campus.
Perhaps my protest may take a
form first committed to paper by
William Hazlitt: "The insolence of
the vulgar is in proportion to their
ignorance: they treat everything
with contempt which they do not
understand."

Brilliant Symphony Review
Editor, THE DAILY:
If in Friday's review of the San
Francisco Symphony there was
anything worthy of complaint, it
might be that the total effect of
the article was a bit on the
loquacious side. Otherwise, the
paragraphs were extremely
perceptive, and followed the form
of an intellectual review very well.
The author is a very skilled if
not brilliant reviewer, who got as
much pompous panning out of a
favorable review as anyone ever
has. Nothing seemed hackneyed,
even the traditional nit-picking
criticism of a concert which the
author apparently enjoyed was
executed with freshness, sparkle
and originality. The second
paragraph, inspired by the
author's dictionary, is indeed a
tribute to the reviewer's art, and

takes itself remarkably seriously.
The criticism was delicate enough,
though I have seen more subtle jabs
in Time magazine's book review
pages.
The author is surprisingly
relaxed in his role, and is to be
congratulated for his scrupulous
deviations in a style which is
probably taken for granted. It was
an amusing article indeed.

Coping Not Sex-Linked
Editor, THE DAILY:
John Kaplan's remark
concerning damage to Lillian
Altree's car, quoted in the Feb. 8
Daily, deserves some comment.
To say "If I'd known anything
like this would happen, I wouldn't
have appointed a woman," is
typical of the unthinking sexism
that permeates our society. Gluing
the doorlocks of Ms. Altree's car
was a political act totally
unconnected with the sex of the
car's owner.
Kaplan also seems to imply that
a woman is not able to cope with
stress situations and,
concomitantly, there is more
disorder because a woman is in
charge. In reply we must
emphasize that the incidents at
the hearing occurred independent
ly of the sex of the hearing officer,
and we remind Kaplan that coping
is not a sex-linked characteristic.

The Faculty Advisory Board is
to be commended for its decision
recommending dismissal of
Associate Professor Franklin. His
attempts to twist and use
academic freedom to serve his

leave little to the imagination as
to what he was attempting to

Farcical Railroad
Editor, THE DAILY:
It is hard to believe that
everyone in the Stanford
community that has any interest
in justice and is committed to
ending the war in Vietnam has not
in some dramatic way condemned
the fascist farcical railroad
Schwartz, Rosenswine, and
Lie-man call the CJP.
What we are witnessing in
the case of Downey, Lee, Loeb,
and Knutson is political repression
at an advanced stage. The CJP is
nothing but a Kangaroo court.
Wake up people, the defendants
are receiving no legal safeguards
whatsoever. The CJP rules were
written up and devised by
Schwartz and Rosenswine. The

"neutral" hearing officer (Altree)
used to collect funds for Stanford
(giving her a good understanding
of who it would be profitable to
expel as far as donations go). The
defendants never get to see the
Panel, to present their case. The
chairman of the CJP, Kaplan, has
been quoted as saying that he
hates to judge in this case but
would rather do so than see the
university run by a bunch of
thugs. (Who are these thugs,
anyway? For anyone who has
been to a demonstration recently
knows who the real thugs are.
It's Tiny Tamm and his
Titillating Toe-tapping Thugs.)
Also, two of the faculty on the
board have signed the Open
Recruitment statement which in
this case is already judging their

guilt.
The railroad is now closed, and
anyone attempting to get on will
probably be charged by Schwartz
with something. Perhaps
obstructing a railroad, robbery, a
hold-up. Who knows? It is crucial
that people who scoff at all this
should listen to the trial on
KZSU, Thursday at 1:30 (as long
as that is still allowed) to hear for
themselves (we aren't entitled to
see for ourselves anymore).

Insolence Of The Vulgar
Editor, THE DAILY:
I feel that I must protest in
some way the actions of a
(relatively) small number of
people at the 7:00 p.m. screening
of Thomas Mann's "Death in
Venice" this past Sunday. Their
lack of simple consideration and
common courtesy was highly
successful in destroying
Visconti's artwork for me, and, I
am sure, for many other members
of the audience.
Perhaps, on a Sunday evening
at Stanford University, some
people do go to the Sunday Flicks
expecting nothing more than a
mindless chronicle of the old
cliches: sex, crime and violence.
Perhaps these people want
nothing more than the
opportunity to shut off their
brains and be passively
entertained for two hours. If such
is the case, their disappointment
in "Death in Venice" is
understandable; not only is the
film devoid of nude scenes and

war footage, it contains only a
minimum of dialogue. All that
remains is excellent acting, some
outstanding cinematography, the
beauty of Venice, and the serenity
of Gustav Mahler's music.
But while I can, perhaps,
understand their motivation, I
cannot understand these few
people's infantile behavior. Why
in their disappointment, did they
not choose to leave the
auditorium, but rather to remain,
and thus prolong their suffering?
And having chosen to stay, why
did they insist upon destroying
for the rest of the audience the
atmosphere created by the film?
It is a sad commentary on the
quality of Stanford's student
body that it contains a not
insignificant number of people,
not only whose lack of taste is
dismaying, but whose lack of
respect for their fellow students
would allow them to express their
boredom, in a theater, in the
manner to which they have
become accustomed, after many
long quarters of practice, in White
Plaza and wherever evil lurks on
campus.
Perhaps my protest may take a
form first committed to paper by
William Hazlitt: "The insolence of
the vulgar is in proportion to their
ignorance: they treat everything
with contempt which they do not
understand."

Brilliant Symphony Review
Editor, THE DAILY:
If in Friday's review of the San
Francisco Symphony there was
anything worthy of complaint, it
might be that the total effect of
the article was a bit on the
loquacious side. Otherwise, the
paragraphs were extremely
perceptive, and followed the form
of an intellectual review very well.
The author is a very skilled if
not brilliant reviewer, who got as
much pompous panning out of a
favorable review as anyone ever
has. Nothing seemed hackneyed,
even the traditional nit-picking
criticism of a concert which the
author apparently enjoyed was
executed with freshness, sparkle
and originality. The second
paragraph, inspired by the
author's dictionary, is indeed a
tribute to the reviewer's art, and

takes itself remarkably seriously.
The criticism was delicate enough,
though I have seen more subtle jabs
in Time magazine's book review
pages.
The author is surprisingly
relaxed in his role, and is to be
congratulated for his scrupulous
deviations in a style which is
probably taken for granted. It was
an amusing article indeed.

Coping Not Sex-Linked
Editor, THE DAILY:
John Kaplan's remark
concerning damage to Lillian
Altree's car, quoted in the Feb. 8
Daily, deserves some comment.
To say "If I'd known anything
like this would happen, I wouldn't
have appointed a woman," is
typical of the unthinking sexism
that permeates our society. Gluing
the doorlocks of Ms. Altree's car
was a political act totally
unconnected with the sex of the
car's owner.
Kaplan also seems to imply that
a woman is not able to cope with
stress situations and,
concomitantly, there is more
disorder because a woman is in
charge. In reply we must
emphasize that the incidents at
the hearing occurred independent
ly of the sex of the hearing officer,
and we remind Kaplan that coping
is not a sex-linked characteristic.

Commendation
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Faculty Advisory Board is
to be commended for its decision
recommending dismissal of
Associate Professor Franklin. His
attempts to twist and use
academic freedom to serve his
own selfish ends certainly justify
this decision. The remarks he
made after the announcement
leave little to the imagination as
to what he was attempting to
accomplish.

Farcical Railroad
Editor, THE DAILY:
It is hard to believe that
everyone in the Stanford
community that has any interest
in justice and is committed to
ending the war in Vietnam has not
in some dramatic way condemned
the fascist farcical railroad
Schwartz, Rosenswine, and
Lie-man call the CJP.
What we are witnessing in
the case of Downey, Lee, Loeb,
and Knutson is political repression
at an advanced stage. The CJP is
nothing but a Kangaroo court.
Wake up people, the defendants
are receiving no legal safeguards
whatsoever. The CJP rules were
written up and devised by
Schwartz and Rosenswine. The

"neutral" hearing officer (Altree)
used to collect funds for Stanford
(giving her a good understanding
of who it would be profitable to
expel as far as donations go). The
defendants never get to see the
Panel, to present their case. The
chairman of the CJP, Kaplan, has
been quoted as saying that he
hates to judge in this case but
would rather do so than see the
university run by a bunch of
thugs. (Who are these thugs,
anyway? For anyone who has
been to a demonstration recently
knows who the real thugs are.
It's Tiny Tamm and his
Titillating Toe-tapping Thugs.)
Also, two of the faculty on the
board have signed the Open
Recruitment statement which in
this case is already judging their

guilt.
The railroad is now closed, and
anyone attempting to get on will
probably be charged by Schwartz
with something. Perhaps
obstructing a railroad, robbery, a
hold-up. Who knows? It is crucial
that people who scoff at all this
should listen to the trial on
KZSU, Thursday at 1:30 (as long
as that is still allowed) to hear for
themselves (we aren't entitled to
see for ourselves anymore).

Thankful
Editor, THE DAILY:
Stanford is fortunate,
particularly in times of crisis, to

have Richard Lyman and Larry
Diamond in positions of
leadership.
Some might question speaking
of these two in the same context,
since they sometimes find
themselves on opposite sides of
issues. I do not, of course, agree
with everything that both or
either of them say and do; but
then one ought to be wary of
anyone who agrees with
everything someone else says and
does.
But they appear to have in
common a determination to
condemn the often destructive,
apparently aimless "ego-trips
masquerading as revolution," and
to distinguish them from serious
efforts to improve the world and
the University. They remind us
that in seeking the perfect, it is
counter-productive to destroy the
good.
They are aware that the
presence of riot police on the
campus is a defeat for the entire
University—students, faculty, and
staff—not just for some ill-defined
inner circle of administrators.
They have in common the
determination not to "sell the
University's soul" to gain $260
million in gifts or to placate the
amateur guerrillas who, as Mr.
Diamond pointed out, belong in
jail.
They realize that the Stanford
administration and trustees did
not cause everything that is wrong
with the world, and hence cannot
solve all problems.
They remind us that the
scourge of war and militarism, will
not be brought under control by
starting a new war on the campus.
Thank you, Messrs. Lyman and
Diamond. "Blessed are the
peacemakers for they shall catch
hell from both sides."

Facts
Editor, THE DAILY:
Several times in the last week
uninformed statements regarding
the source of Stanford's lands
have appeared on these pages. For
the record here are the facts.
Leland Stanford purchased
what now comprises the Stanford
Campus from legal title holders to
the land. The legal owners
purchased the land from squatters
who acquired their rights by
"taking" and from other legal

owners who acquired their rights
by purchase, honest and
sometimes dishonest. Both parties
cheated (or dealt honestly) with
the Mexicans who in the days of
Spanish rule "appropriated" the
land from the Indians. There is no
record to indicate that the Indians
negotiated transfer of the land
from the resident wildlife.
There are those who will say
that Leland Stanford purchased
the land with money stolen from
the working class and sacrificed
the lives of "thousands" of
Chinese laborers in the process of
acquiring his wealth. Perhaps his
money was tainted - perhaps not.
That "thousands" of Chinese died
during construction of the

Brilliant Symphony Review
Editor, THE DAILY:
If in Friday's review of the San
Francisco Symphony there was
anything worthy of complaint, it
might be that the total effect of
the article was a bit on the
loquacious side. Otherwise, the
paragraphs were extremely
perceptive, and followed the form
of an intellectual review very well.
The author is a very skilled if
not brilliant reviewer, who got as
much pompous panning out of a
favorable review as anyone ever
has. Nothing seemed hackneyed,
even the traditional nit-picking
criticism of a concert which the
author apparently enjoyed was
executed with freshness, sparkle
and originality. The second
paragraph, inspired by the
author's dictionary, is indeed a
tribute to the reviewer's art, and

takes itself remarkably seriously.
The criticism was delicate enough,
though I have seen more subtle jabs
in Time magazine's book review
pages.
The author is surprisingly
relaxed in his role, and is to be
congratulated for his scrupulous
deviations in a style which is
probably taken for granted. It was
an amusing article indeed.

Coping Not Sex-Linked
Editor, THE DAILY:
John Kaplan's remark
concerning damage to Lillian
Altree's car, quoted in the Feb. 8
Daily, deserves some comment.
To say "If I'd known anything
like this would happen, I wouldn't
have appointed a woman," is
typical of the unthinking sexism
that permeates our society. Gluing
the doorlocks of Ms. Altree's car
was a political act totally
unconnected with the sex of the
car's owner.
Kaplan also seems to imply that
a woman is not able to cope with
stress situations and,
concomitantly, there is more
disorder because a woman is in
charge. In reply we must
emphasize that the incidents at
the hearing occurred independent
ly of the sex of the hearing officer,
and we remind Kaplan that coping
is not a sex-linked characteristic.

Commendation
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Faculty Advisory Board is
to be commended for its decision
recommending dismissal of
Associate Professor Franklin. His
attempts to twist and use
academic freedom to serve his
own selfish ends certainly justify
this decision. The remarks he
made after the announcement
leave little to the imagination as
to what he was attempting to
accomplish.

Farcical Railroad
Editor, THE DAILY:
It is hard to believe that
everyone in the Stanford
community that has any interest
in justice and is committed to
ending the war in Vietnam has not
in some dramatic way condemned
the fascist farcical railroad
Schwartz, Rosenswine, and
Lie-man call the CJP.
What we are witnessing in
the case of Downey, Lee, Loeb,
and Knutson is political repression
at an advanced stage. The CJP is
nothing but a Kangaroo court.
Wake up people, the defendants
are receiving no legal safeguards
whatsoever. The CJP rules were
written up and devised by
Schwartz and Rosenswine. The

"neutral" hearing officer (Altree)
used to collect funds for Stanford
(giving her a good understanding
of who it would be profitable to
expel as far as donations go). The
defendants never get to see the
Panel, to present their case. The
chairman of the CJP, Kaplan, has
been quoted as saying that he
hates to judge in this case but
would rather do so than see the
university run by a bunch of
thugs. (Who are these thugs,
anyway? For anyone who has
been to a demonstration recently
knows who the real thugs are.
It's Tiny Tamm and his
Titillating Toe-tapping Thugs.)
Also, two of the faculty on the
board have signed the Open
Recruitment statement which in
this case is already judging their

guilt.
The railroad is now closed, and
anyone attempting to get on will
probably be charged by Schwartz
with something. Perhaps
obstructing a railroad, robbery, a
hold-up. Who knows? It is crucial
that people who scoff at all this
should listen to the trial on
KZSU, Thursday at 1:30 (as long
as that is still allowed) to hear for
themselves (we aren't entitled to
see for ourselves anymore).

Thankful
Editor, THE DAILY:
Stanford is fortunate,
particularly in times of crisis, to

have Richard Lyman and Larry
Diamond in positions of
leadership.
Some might question speaking
of these two in the same context,
since they sometimes find
themselves on opposite sides of
issues. I do not, of course, agree
with everything that both or
either of them say and do; but
then one ought to be wary of
anyone who agrees with
everything someone else says and
does.
But they appear to have in
common a determination to
condemn the often destructive,
apparently aimless "ego-trips
masquerading as revolution," and
to distinguish them from serious
efforts to improve the world and
the University. They remind us
that in seeking the perfect, it is
counter-productive to destroy the
good.
They are aware that the
presence of riot police on the
campus is a defeat for the entire
University—students, faculty, and
staff—not just for some ill-defined
inner circle of administrators.
They have in common the
determination not to "sell the
University's soul" to gain $260
million in gifts or to placate the
amateur guerrillas who, as Mr.
Diamond pointed out, belong in
jail.
They realize that the Stanford
administration and trustees did
not cause everything that is wrong
with the world, and hence cannot
solve all problems.
They remind us that the
scourge of war and militarism, will
not be brought under control by
starting a new war on the campus.
Thank you, Messrs. Lyman and
Diamond. "Blessed are the
peacemakers for they shall catch
hell from both sides."

Facts
Editor, THE DAILY:
Several times in the last week
uninformed statements regarding
the source of Stanford's lands
have appeared on these pages. For
the record here are the facts.
Leland Stanford purchased
what now comprises the Stanford
Campus from legal title holders to
the land. The legal owners
purchased the land from squatters
who acquired their rights by
"taking" and from other legal

owners who acquired their rights
by purchase, honest and
sometimes dishonest. Both parties
cheated (or dealt honestly) with
the Mexicans who in the days of
Spanish rule "appropriated" the
land from the Indians. There is no
record to indicate that the Indians
negotiated transfer of the land
from the resident wildlife.
There are those who will say
that Leland Stanford purchased
the land with money stolen from
the working class and sacrificed
the lives of "thousands" of
Chinese laborers in the process of
acquiring his wealth. Perhaps his
money was tainted - perhaps not.
That "thousands" of Chinese died
during construction of the
railroad is a figment of the
imagination.
History is replete with
conquests (thefts, if you will) of
land and exploitation of the
vanquished. None of us are free of
guilt, if we subscribe to the
current rationale that justifies
raping Stanford. Rather than
sophomoric exercises in petty
theft and Mafia style intimidation
would not mankind be better
served if we worked for a better
tomorrow rather than aimlessly
destroying today?

Insolence Of The Vulgar
Editor, THE DAILY:
I feel that I must protest in
some way the actions of a
(relatively) small number of
people at the 7:00 p.m. screening
of Thomas Mann's "Death in
Venice" this past Sunday. Their
lack of simple consideration and
common courtesy was highly
successful in destroying
Visconti's artwork for me, and, I
am sure, for many other members
of the audience.
Perhaps, on a Sunday evening
at Stanford University, some
people do go to the Sunday Flicks
expecting nothing more than a
mindless chronicle of the old
cliches: sex, crime and violence.
Perhaps these people want
nothing more than the
opportunity to shut off their
brains and be passively
entertained for two hours. If such
is the case, their disappointment
in "Death in Venice" is
understandable; not only is the
film devoid of nude scenes and

war footage, it contains only a
minimum of dialogue. All that
remains is excellent acting, some
outstanding cinematography, the
beauty of Venice, and the serenity
of Gustav Mahler's music.
But while I can, perhaps,
understand their motivation, I
cannot understand these few
people's infantile behavior. Why
in their disappointment, did they
not choose to leave the
auditorium, but rather to remain,
and thus prolong their suffering?
And having chosen to stay, why
did they insist upon destroying
for the rest of the audience the
atmosphere created by the film?
It is a sad commentary on the
quality of Stanford's student
body that it contains a not
insignificant number of people,
not only whose lack of taste is
dismaying, but whose lack of
respect for their fellow students
would allow them to express their
boredom, in a theater, in the
manner to which they have
become accustomed, after many
long quarters of practice, in White
Plaza and wherever evil lurks on
campus.
Perhaps my protest may take a

ly of the sex of the hearing officer,
and we remind Kaplan that coping
is not a sex-linked characteristic.

Commendation
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Faculty Advisory Board is
to be commended for its decision
recommending dismissal of
Associate Professor Franklin. His
attempts to twist and use
academic freedom to serve his
own selfish ends certainly justify
this decision. The remarks he
made after the announcement
leave little to the imagination as
to what he was attempting to
accomplish.
