# fee assessment
## Child-Care Needs Support 
### 
Driven by financial necessity, the Children's
Center of the Stanford Community is once again
asking the student body to vote a one-time, one
dollar fee assessment. The vote will be next week.
The funds will be used to make the improvements
needed to obtain a state license, and thus continue
what we feel is a vital service to the community.
The Children's Center provides a unique and
necessary service for Stanford students, staff and
faculty—reasonably priced child-care in a
"non-institutional" environment.
We realize that many Stanford students are
oblivious to the fate of the Children's Center
because they do not benefit directly from its
services. Ideally, we would not be asking Stanford
undergraduates to contribute to our funds, but
conditions are far from ideal; our requests for
financial aid from other sources have produced
little, and we need money now in order to meet
such state requirements as hot running water in the
buildings, adequate drainage of the play areas, and
modem kitchens.
The Children's Center currently makes enough
money from fees and donations to cover daily
operating expenses (and we expect to continue to
do so), but fees cannot possibly provide the capital
needed to make the necessary improvements.
No Permanent Subsidy
Stanford students seem to be apprehensive about
voting a permanent subsidy to the Children's
Center. While this very idea has been implemented
at many California campuses (Berkeley students
assessed themselves $35,000 annually, UCLA
$30,000, Foothill $8,500), we are not asking the
Stanford student body to donate funds on any such
continual basis.

All that we are asking for is a one-time assessment
to provide the funds for nonrecurring development
costs. If, and when, we obtain a state license, the
Center will be open to new sources of outside
funding, which in turn will enable us to expand our
services to the community.
The Children's Center does not wish to keep its
fi r »»iices in the dark, and we have outlined below
what we plan to do with the funds. Nor does the
Center wish to be seen as a burden on those of the
community who do not need its services.
But we believe that in the long run Stanford will
be a healthier place if the community will accept
the fact that many of its members are not childless,
and assume the responsibility of providing these
children with good day care.
