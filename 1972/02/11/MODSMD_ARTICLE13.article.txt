* CORRECTION *
Yesterday the Daily
incorrectly reported, in a story
on page 5, that David
Josephson draws no salary, and
has a house in Palo Alto.
Josephson informed the Daily
yesterday tht he receives $125
per quarter from the Dean of
Students Office for acting as
"resident tutor" at Columbae
House. Josephson's office is
located in a Palo Alto house,
where he often spends the
night.
