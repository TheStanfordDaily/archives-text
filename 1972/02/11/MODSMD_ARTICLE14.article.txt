# Psychic Health
## 
### 
A series of seminars on
psychosomatic health and
awareness, running from the 12th
to the 23rd of February, are being
offered in the main lounge of
Florence Moore.
Acharya Christopher Hills,
author of "Christ-Yoga of Peace"
and "Nuclear Evolution," will
lead the seminars. Hills has
devoted himself to research into
the nature of consciousness.
The seminars are intended to
give a broad exposure to some
techniques for control of
mind-body relationships. The first
seminar, for example, will deal
with vibration exercises in toning,
basic evolutionary exercises,
hemispherical dominance in brain
and psyche, control of yin yang
forces, psychic electricity in
self-healing, and colors and
psychomatic health.
The first seminar begins
Saturday, February 12, 1-5 p.m.
