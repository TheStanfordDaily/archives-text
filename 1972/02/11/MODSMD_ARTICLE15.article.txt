# Recruiters Cancel
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
The Navy yesterday canceled
scheduled recruiting at the Career
Planning and Placement Center
under the threat of a peaceful
disruption similar to the one
staged Wednesday.
Captain John C. Duck, head of
the Navy Reserve Officers
Training Corps, made the decision
to cancel yesterday's interviews
after a group of 65 demonstrators
barred Lt. (j.g.) Kenneth Santoro
from entering the center
Wednesday, and informed him
that they would also block
yesterday's session.
Duck said last night that it had
been "made clear" that the
recruiting would not be allowed,
and that "we didn't feel there was
any point in wasting their [the
recruiters'] time."
A group of about 65 assembled
in front of the Placement Center
at 8:15 yesterday morning to bar
the expected recruiters. Material
distributed at the scene said that
the demonstration would be
nonviolent and would involve no

shouting or baiting of police
should they be called in.
In contrast to Wednesday's
disruption, no police were in
evidence at all yesterday. On
Wednesday, Lt. Don Tamm of the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Office offered Santoro a police
escort into the building, which
was refused. Duck said that the
idea of a police escort for the
recruiters scheduled for yesterday
was "not considered."
Dave Josephson of Columbae
House made the announcement of
the cancellation to the crowd,
saying that it was "another day of
victory for the people."
After the demonstration broke
up, some eight demonstrators
went to the NROTC headquarters
in the athletic department
building, where they met with
Duck for about two hours. They
discussed "the war and other
political issues," and it "was all
very friendly," said Duck.
Students whose interviews
were canceled were given the
phone number of the recruiters at
the Alameda Naval Air Station.
