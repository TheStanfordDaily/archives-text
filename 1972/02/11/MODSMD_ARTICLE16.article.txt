# Black Students Call For Protest
## 
### 
Black student leaders from four
Bay Area colleges yesterday called
for a massive demonstration in
support of Angela Davis at the
San Jose courthouse on Monday.
At a morning press conference
in the ASSU offices, the seven
student body presidents and BSU
chairmen also issued four
demands concerning the Davis
trial:
—that the "illegitimate ban on
lawful protests and assembly" be
"lifted unconditionally."
—that all charges against 24
people arrested for demonstrating
at the courthouse on February 2
be dismissed.
—that facilities for people's
attendance at the trial be "greatly
expanded."
—and that fences around the
courthouse be taken down and
also that no more spectators,
members of the press, potential
jurors, and witnesses be forced to
have their picture taken.
Present at the press conference
were the student body presidents
from Mills and Merritt College;
the BSU chairman and
co-chairman from Foothill
College; and ASSU Council of
Presidents members Doug
McHenry and Diane Fields as well
as new Stanford BSU Chairman
Charles Ogletree.
In a prepared statement the
group said: "We feel because we
want to show our support for
Angela Davis we are being denied
our basic rights as both citizens
and human beings."
The statement concluded, "It is
in this spirit, a spirit which calls
for the courage to realize that

people still have constitutional
rights in this country . . . that we
urge students all over the state to
participate in a massive exercise of
our rights this coming Monday in
front of the courthouse in San
Jose.
A court order has banned
demonstrations within a square
mile of the courthouse. But
yesterday Franklin Alexander, a
spokesman for the national
Angela Davis defense committee,
said his group has obtained a
permit to hold their protest in a
parking lot across from the
courthouse.
Alexander said he expects
several hundred people to turn
out.
Ogletree hit out at the media
alleging that they had been
photographing empty press seats
at the hearings and then saying
spectator turnout for the hearings
had been light. Ogletree also
charged that spectators were being
wrongfully kept from the
courtroon.
The Stanford Students for the
Defense of Angela Davis and All
Political Prisoners will hold a rally
in White Plaza at noon today. The
rally is primarily to plan strategy
for the upcoming demonstration
on Monday.
Speaking will be Alexander;
Fania Davis, Angela's sister; and
members of the Stanford
committee. Committee Head and
BSU Chairman Charles Ogletree
said last night that recent events
in the case would be discussed,
such as the Judge allegedly
moving the trial date to Tuesday
to avoid the demonstration.

Defense of Angela Davis and All
Political Prisoners will hold a rally
in White Plaza at noon today. The
rally is primarily to plan strategy
for the upcoming demonstration
on Monday.
Speaking will be Alexander;
Fania Davis, Angela's sister; and
members of the Stanford
committee. Committee Head and
BSU Chairman Charles Ogletree
said last night that recent events
in the case would be discussed,
such as the Judge allegedly
moving the trial date to Tuesday
to avoid the demonstration.
Black student leaders from four
Bay Area colleges yesterday called
for a massive demonstration in
support of Angela Davis at the
San Jose courthouse on Monday.
At a morning press conference
in the ASSU offices, the seven
student body presidents and BSU
chairmen also issued four
demands concerning the Davis
trial:
—that the "illegitimate ban on
lawful protests and assembly" be
"lifted unconditionally."
—that all charges against 24
people arrested for demonstrating
at the courthouse on February 2
be dismissed.
—that facilities for people's
attendance at the trial be "greatly
expanded."
—and that fences around the
courthouse be taken down and
also that no more spectators,
members of the press, potential
jurors, and witnesses be forced to
have their picture taken.
Present at the press conference
were the student body presidents
from Mills and Merritt College;
the BSU chairman and
co-chairman from Foothill
College; and ASSU Council of
Presidents members Doug
McHenry and Diane Fields as well
as new Stanford BSU Chairman
Charles Ogletree.
In a prepared statement the
group said: "We feel because we
want to show our support for
Angela Davis we are being denied
our basic rights as both citizens
and human beings."
The statement concluded, "It is
in this spirit, a spirit which calls
for the courage to realize that

people still have constitutional
rights in this country . . . that we
urge students all over the state to
participate in a massive exercise of
our rights this coming Monday in
front of the courthouse in San
Jose.
A court order has banned
demonstrations within a square
mile of the courthouse. But
yesterday Franklin Alexander, a
spokesman for the national
Angela Davis defense committee,
said his group has obtained a
permit to hold their protest in a
parking lot across from the
courthouse.
Alexander said he expects
several hundred people to turn
out.
Ogletree hit out at the media
alleging that they had been
photographing empty press seats
at the hearings and then saying
spectator turnout for the hearings
had been light. Ogletree also
charged that spectators were being
wrongfully kept from the
courtroon.
The Stanford Students for the
Defense of Angela Davis and All
Political Prisoners will hold a rally
