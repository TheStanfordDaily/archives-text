# Physicist Yang Speaks
## Laureate Describes China 
### 
Chen Ning Yang, co-winner of
the Nobel Prize in 1957 for
nuclear research, characterized the
Chinese people as proud, highly
principled, and unselfish in a
lecture Wednesday night. He
based his observations on a
five-week trip last summer to the
People's Republic of China.
Professor Yang described
Chinese society and the system of
education to a largely Asian
overflow crowd of 800 in the
TMU Large Lounge.
"On the average", said Yang,
"people in China are much more
selfless than people in America."
He attributed this to the
egalitarian principles of social
organization and the educational
system.
Yang lectured at several
universities, including Shanghai
University, Peking University and
the Institute of Advanced Physics.
The universities seemed to be
returning to their former size
following the turmoil of the
cultural revolution.
Work Before College
The cultural revolution resulted
in a reorganization of education,
based on three egalitarian
principles:
—the education of a generation
dedicated to building a better
society.
—the linking of theoretical
research with practical
application.
—the encouragement of new
teaching methods.
Students, before going to
college, must work for three
years. They must be judged
selfless and able to serve society
by their co-workers, he said.

To link theory and practice,
factories are built adjacent to
schools and universities. Students
can then become acquainted with
working conditions.
In universities as well as
factories, every day is started with
a reading session. Newspapers and
Mao's works are read and
discussed. At this time, criticism
of self and others takes place.
Yang found that the people were
not afraid of speaking out or
receiving criticism from others.
International Opinion
He noted that the Chinese
people are aware of international
developments. Reference News, a
daily summary of international
news and opinion, includes
columns by Walter Lippman and
William F. Buckley. He added that
Lippman was one of the Chinese
favorites.
Yang felt that the egalitarian
principles of society "have
changed the behavior pattern of
people toward unselfishness." He
remarked that theft is almost
unknown.
Self-sufficiency, Yang said, is
encouraged on an individual as
well as on a provincial level.
Confidence
Yang was impressed by the
positive, forward-looking spirit
that prevailed. Many people are
still poor and housing is lacking.
However, the people see the
differences between the China of
today and of 23 years ago. There
is a confidence that China's
policies are leading her into a
better society.
In contrast, Yang felt that "the
United States is going through a

crisis of spirit."
Yang illustrated with slides his
visits to scientific institutions,
factories, hospitals and
communes, and a dinner with
Chou En-lai.
Yang, a native of China, came
to the United States in 1945 and
earned a doctorate in physics at
the Uniersity of Chicago. For
seven years he worked at the
Institute for Advanced Study at
Princeton. Since 1966, he has held
the Albert Einstein professorship
in physics and directed the
Institute for Theoretical Physics
at Stony Brook.

Yang, a native of China, came
to the United States in 1945 and
earned a doctorate in physics at
the Uniersity of Chicago. For
seven years he worked at the
Institute for Advanced Study at
Princeton. Since 1966, he has held
the Albert Einstein professorship
in physics and directed the
Institute for Theoretical Physics
at Stony Brook.
Chen Ning Yang, co-winner of
the Nobel Prize in 1957 for
nuclear research, characterized the
Chinese people as proud, highly
principled, and unselfish in a
lecture Wednesday night. He
based his observations on a
five-week trip last summer to the
People's Republic of China.
Professor Yang described
Chinese society and the system of
education to a largely Asian
overflow crowd of 800 in the
TMU Large Lounge.
"On the average", said Yang,
"people in China are much more
selfless than people in America."
He attributed this to the
egalitarian principles of social
organization and the educational
system.
Yang lectured at several
universities, including Shanghai
University, Peking University and
the Institute of Advanced Physics.
The universities seemed to be
returning to their former size
following the turmoil of the
cultural revolution.
Work Before College
The cultural revolution resulted
in a reorganization of education,
based on three egalitarian
principles:
—the education of a generation
dedicated to building a better
society.
—the linking of theoretical
research with practical
application.
—the encouragement of new
teaching methods.
Students, before going to
college, must work for three
years. They must be judged
selfless and able to serve society
by their co-workers, he said.

To link theory and practice,
factories are built adjacent to
schools and universities. Students
can then become acquainted with
working conditions.
In universities as well as
factories, every day is started with
a reading session. Newspapers and
Mao's works are read and
discussed. At this time, criticism
of self and others takes place.
Yang found that the people were
not afraid of speaking out or
receiving criticism from others.
International Opinion
He noted that the Chinese
people are aware of international
developments. Reference News, a
daily summary of international
news and opinion, includes
columns by Walter Lippman and
William F. Buckley. He added that
Lippman was one of the Chinese
favorites.
Yang felt that the egalitarian
principles of society "have
changed the behavior pattern of
people toward unselfishness." He
remarked that theft is almost
unknown.
Self-sufficiency, Yang said, is
encouraged on an individual as
well as on a provincial level.
Confidence
Yang was impressed by the
positive, forward-looking spirit
that prevailed. Many people are
still poor and housing is lacking.
However, the people see the
differences between the China of
today and of 23 years ago. There
is a confidence that China's
policies are leading her into a
better society.
In contrast, Yang felt that "the
United States is going through a

crisis of spirit."
Yang illustrated with slides his
visits to scientific institutions,
factories, hospitals and
communes, and a dinner with
Chou En-lai.
