# Improvisation Highlights Symphony
## 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
Once again, the San Francisco
Symphony gave another excellent
performance on Wednesday night
with a program consisting of
Vivaldi's "Concerto in F Minor,"
opus 8, No. 4, Mozart's "Piano
Concerto No. 20 in D Minor",
Webern's "Six Pieces for
Orchestra", opus 6, and
Schumann's "Symphony No. 4 in
D Minor".
Stuart Canin, concertmaster of
the symphony, was the violin
soloist in the Vivaldi. The piece
began impressively, with Canin
displaying his technical skill in
crisp passage work. The orchestra,
conducted by Nicklaus Wyss,
entered shakily at first, but soon
recovered the clarity and elegance
necessary for the piece. A small
orchestra with only strings and a
harpsichord, still developed a rich,
thick texture that made it sound
as if there were far more
instruments playing.
The second movement was
beautifully melodic. Canin played
the lines with a sonorous and
strong vibrato. The
accompaniment consisted of only
a delicate pizzicato line, changing
notes only as the soloist's
harmonies changed.
Canin contrasted the subtle
dynamics skillfully. He made the
difference between a piano and a
pianissimo sound as great as that
between a forte and a piano.
Blustery Allegro
The third movement, a blustery
allegro, began with leaps and
passage work in the solo. Canin
often slid up to his high notes, or,
in an attempt to avoid sliding,
missed his low notes. In the
middle of the movement,
however, he regained his grace to
burst out in a rapid cadenza-like
passage.
His tone became strong and

forceful as he built up only to
have the orchestra come in
delicately. Just as suddenly, both
orchestra and soloist burst into
minor key passage work. Canin
was again a little messy. The
precision of the orchestra echoing
his runs heightened the contrast.
But the piece ended with a good
passage run in all the parts, so
Canin did end on a good note.
The Vebern pieces stunned the
audience, as usual. The sound of
twelve tone works is pretty alien
to most audiences, except when
heard as background music for
Twilight Zone. The orchestra
performed them admirably. They
almost made Vebern sound
melodic, his own style of a
combination of forcefulness and
hesitancy was retained.
Vebern is a subtle composer.
His pauses are almost as important
as his tones. The pieces were
precisely timed. The feeling
evoked ran the gamut from
delicacy to violence, or as near to
violence as Vebern ever gets.
The clarity of the first piece
was astounding. All the
instruments, especially the oboe,
achieved a fragility that enhanced
the selection. The second piece
created a feeling of tension in a
juxtaposition of loud and soft
dissonant chords.
Excellent Contrast
The next two pieces provided
an excellent contrast. The solo
violin in the third piece gave a
spooky effect over the quiet
droning of the trumpets. The
fourth piece was a compromise
between quiet and loudness. The
use of a glockenspiel heightened
both impressions. There was an
excellent imitative passage
between an oboe, a violin, and a
trombone, where the lines
alternated in a quasi-melody.
The fifth piece was the most

turbulent. It highlighted the
percussive instruments, a gong, a
snare drum, and cymbals. The rest
of the orchestra remained
appropriately in the background.
The sixth piece contained one
predominant violin, played with a
gentle but cutting vibrato, in
contrast to a rich solo bassoon.
Filling the gaps was a harp that
grew stealthier as the piece
progressed.
The Schumann was lovely. The
piece is unlike most Schumann
works with its clear tones and
passage work. It is remarkably
predictable, for Schumann. Yet it
still retains the essence of
Schumann's turbulent and erratic
nature.
The orchestra more than did
the piece justice. Wyss led the
players through the spectrum of
emotions. At some places in the
first movement, there is a
beautiful melody, a pleading,
pathetic theme. The orchestra
made it as poignant as possible,
stretching out rubatos and
crescendos and using gentle
subitos that forecast the outburst
of string and wind passages in the
next stormy section.
Intense Undercurrent
At times, the bassoons
conveyed a playful feeling,
complemented by lilting violins.
Then suddenly, the trumpets
would burst into a triumphant
dotted rhythm. Each theme
melted naturally into the next
one. The quieter themes were
graceful, but the orchestra
retained the feeling of intenseness
that is the undercurrent in
Schumann's music.
The only pause between
movements came before the
scherzo third movement. The
scherzo alternated a gracious
feeling with an almost Russian
peasant theme. The trio of the

movement provided an excellent
contrast. It was always graceful,
nearly classical in clarity.
Occasionally it verged on being as
affected as classical trios. The
subito return to the scherzo
enhanced the contrast.
From there, the scherzo ran
into the last movement, a fierce
allegro marked by sudden tempo
and dynamic changes hinting at
Schumann's erratic nature. The
orchestra alternated emphasis
between bold horns and playful
violins and winds. The final
measures built up in traditional
cadential form, only to switch
suddenly from minor to major
several times. The real ending was
hurried and impulsive, just as
Schumann must have envisioned
it. The high point of the program
for me was the Mozart. Vladimir
Ashkenazy was the soloist. Aside
from being one of the greatest
pianists of this era, he has been an
idol of mine since the first concert
of his I saw in 1962. Not having
heard him in person for four
years, I was very eager to see how
he would play the Mozart.
The D Minor Concerto is
probably the most un-classical of
Mozart's piano concertos. It is
fraught with tempestuous
passages. Sudden outbursts of
emotion occur in both the
orchestra and the solo parts.
Ashkenazy performed the piece
more lightly than do most
pianists. It was a refreshing
change. Too often pianists
over-pedal and over-romanticize
it, so that it sounds weighted.
However, the orchestra began
too fast. The first exposition
lacked the dynamism and contrast
it should have. But once
Ashkenazy came in at a slower
tempo, the orchestra fell under his
direction, as if Wyss were hardly
there.
In the first movement,
Ashkenazy achieved an excellent
balance between romantic
interpretation and classical
crispness. His runs were light,
almost buffa, in the section where
the second melodic theme goes
through all kinds of
developments. Where the theme
itself entered, Ashkenazy treated
it lovingly, with controlled
emotion.
Ashkenazy ably complemented
the orchestra in several places
where it had the major themes.
Throughout the piece, there was a

perfect integration of orchestra
and soloist.
Feeling of Grace
The second movement began
lyrically. Ashkenazy played it
straight—no rubatos, waits before
phrases, or excessive pedal. His
turns were crisp and faster than
most Mozartean turns. He
achieved a feeling of grace which
the orchestra echoed. When the
orchestra took up the themes
from the piano, it tended to
romanticize them more. But,
when Ashkenazy had the
spotlight, the orchestra provided a
simple accompaniment and did
not try to compete with him.
The third movement was nn
excellent showpiece for both
parts. Ashkenazy spent much of
his time accompanying the
orchestra. When his time came,
however, he took over
completely. His arpeggios were
delicate and clear, almost
feathery. He played and flirted
with the melodies. His outbursts
into forte arpeggios were
emotional, a good contrast to the
gracious melodies preceding them;
throughout the piece he retained a
clear, controlled feeling, but this
did not at all detract from the
more romantic passages.
The most amazing part of the
performance was the cadenza in
the last movement. In the first
movement, Ashkenazy used
Beethoven's cadenza. He put all
the tempestuousness and lyricism
into it that Beethoven must have
wanted.
The shock came in the last
movement. Ashkenazy started out
to do Beethoven's cadenza for
that movement, or so it seemed.
But after about two measures he
plunged into a brilliant cadenza,
full of arpeggios, runs, and
amazing modulations. He achieved
a greater melodic unity than the
Beethoven one, a short,
unexceptional cadenza, ever did.
The cadenza was long and fully
displayed Ashkenazy's virtuosity.
Even Wyss seemed a little
surprised to hear it. He kept
looking at Ashkenazy
questioningly, to try to figure out
when to bring the orchestra in.
Ashkenazy improvised the
cadenza on the spot. Even his wife
had never heard it before. The
cadenza was the best part of a
beautiful concerto. It is rare to
hear performers imrpvise
cadenzas. It is even rarer to hear
them improvise great ones.
