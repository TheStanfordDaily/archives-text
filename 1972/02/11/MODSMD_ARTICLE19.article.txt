# Szabo & Friends Look Like Crazy
## 
### MARC BARMAN 
February is Monster Month at
In Your Ear. Stone Monsters like
Herbie Hancock, Kenny Burrell,
and John Klemmer and Prince
Lasha will all be there to play
games in the middle of your head.
Kicking it off was one of the
baddest groups around, the
spellbinder, the gypsy, Gabor
Szabo.
Last week was just ugly in my
shoes. Three midterms, a group
project, one huge pain. You know
how that feels.
Walking in to see Szabo Saturday
night was the best thing I could
have done. They were perfect.
SRO crowd, great vibes, and
damn, that little cat plays fine
music. You just had to smile,
relax, unwind, and dig in.
Unique Technique
Gabor, as you probably know,
is Hungarian, and a self-taught
guitarist. He has, therefore, both a
unique conception and a unique
technique. Almost unheard of
before 1964, he has become one
of the most important guitarists
on the modern scene. His
reputation as a composer is as
high as his reputation as a
guitarist, due to such songs as
Gypsy Woman (of San tana fame)
and others.
Second guitarist John Bryant is
a very diverse but a very together
fellow. He can play anything from
the hardest acid rock to the bluest
cool jazz, all with respect. His
composition Road to Zannadeau
was one of the high spots of the
evening, and served as a fine

showcase for his mellow vocals.
Tom Koster plays organ and
electric piano with great taste and
finesse. He plays organ with a
tradtional choice of stops, sounds,
etc., but his rhythmic and melodic
conception is nothing like a
"traditional" organ player. He
also knows not to be
heavy-handed, a fault many organ
players succumb to because of the
raw power of the instrument. He
makes excellent use of the organ's
musical extremities.
Organic sound
Stone Freak bass player is Doug
Rousch. Incredible to look at;
incredible to hear. He is a fast,
slippery, dangerous man with an
electric bass in his hand. The very
solid anchor to the group, he
plays like two men at once, and
gives the group a very alive,
organic sound.
On drums, "He has a name, but
we call him Spider." Spider has
the fire of about ten men. Every
beat crisp and precise, yet with
the kind of drive that keeps you
on the end of your chair, and
echoes through your entire
nervous system.
The interaction between these
musicians is beyond the intuitive
level. There are two ways a band
can sound that together. One is to
be incredibly over-rehearsed (a la
University of Michigan Marching
Robots, non?) and it sounds
incredibly over-rehearsed (ditto.).
The other is to do it the way
Szabo does, get five talented,
heavy musicians, and just cook
like crazy.

musicians is beyond the intuitive
level. There are two ways a band
can sound that together. One is to
be incredibly over-rehearsed (a la
University of Michigan Marching
Robots, non?) and it sounds
incredibly over-rehearsed (ditto.).
The other is to do it the way
Szabo does, get five talented,
heavy musicians, and just cook
like crazy.
February is Monster Month at
In Your Ear. Stone Monsters like
Herbie Hancock, Kenny Burrell,
and John Klemmer and Prince
Lasha will all be there to play
games in the middle of your head.
Kicking it off was one of the
baddest groups around, the
spellbinder, the gypsy, Gabor
Szabo.
Last week was just ugly in my
shoes. Three midterms, a group
project, one huge pain. You know
how that feels.
Walking in to see Szabo Saturday
night was the best thing I could
have done. They were perfect.
SRO crowd, great vibes, and
damn, that little cat plays fine
music. You just had to smile,
relax, unwind, and dig in.
Unique Technique
Gabor, as you probably know,
is Hungarian, and a self-taught
guitarist. He has, therefore, both a
unique conception and a unique
technique. Almost unheard of
before 1964, he has become one
of the most important guitarists
on the modern scene. His
reputation as a composer is as
high as his reputation as a
guitarist, due to such songs as
Gypsy Woman (of San tana fame)
and others.
Second guitarist John Bryant is
a very diverse but a very together
fellow. He can play anything from
the hardest acid rock to the bluest
cool jazz, all with respect. His
composition Road to Zannadeau
was one of the high spots of the
evening, and served as a fine

showcase for his mellow vocals.
Tom Koster plays organ and
electric piano with great taste and
finesse. He plays organ with a
tradtional choice of stops, sounds,
etc., but his rhythmic and melodic
conception is nothing like a
"traditional" organ player. He
also knows not to be
heavy-handed, a fault many organ
players succumb to because of the
raw power of the instrument. He
makes excellent use of the organ's
musical extremities.
Organic sound
Stone Freak bass player is Doug
Rousch. Incredible to look at;
incredible to hear. He is a fast,
slippery, dangerous man with an
electric bass in his hand. The very
solid anchor to the group, he
plays like two men at once, and
gives the group a very alive,
organic sound.
On drums, "He has a name, but
we call him Spider." Spider has
the fire of about ten men. Every
beat crisp and precise, yet with
the kind of drive that keeps you
on the end of your chair, and
echoes through your entire
nervous system.
The interaction between these
musicians is beyond the intuitive
level. There are two ways a band
can sound that together. One is to
be incredibly over-rehearsed (a la
University of Michigan Marching
Robots, non?) and it sounds
incredibly over-rehearsed (ditto.).
