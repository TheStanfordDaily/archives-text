# Caucuses Will Choose Delegates
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Supporters of nine candidates for
the Democratic nomination for
President will hold separate
delegate-selection caucuses across the
newly-formed 17th Congressional
District and the rest of the state
tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. The 17th
District includes Stanford, Palo Alto,
most of south San Mateo County and
part of San Jose.
The caucuses, will include only
registered Democrats who sign support
pledges for the candidate for whom
the caucuses are being held. Those
attending the caucuses will
recommend between six and twelve
people to represent the district for
their candidate at the Democratic
National Convention being held July
10-13 in Miami Beach.
Also selected by the caucuses will
be a district chairman who will sit on
the candidate's state committee with
the representatives from the other 42

Congressional districts.
The state committees for each
candidate will then meet on February
19 and make the final selection of 238
of California's 271 delegates to the
Democratic Convention. They are
expected to ratify the choices of
tomorrow's caucuses. Whichever
candidate wins the June 6 primary will
send its entire delegate slate to the
convention.
Candidates holding caucuses are:
Congresswoman Shirley A. Chisholm
(N.Y.); Senator Vance Hartke (Ind.);
Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, Jr.
(Minn.); Senator Henry M. Jackson
(Wash.) and Mayor John V. Lindsay of
New York City.
Also former Senator and 1968
Presidential candidate Eugene J.
McCarthy; Senator George S.
McGovern (S.D.); Senator Edmund S.
Muskie (Maine) and Mayor Samuel W.
Yorty of Los Angeles.
This new delegate-selection system

follows the guidelines of the
Democratic National Committee's
Commission on Party Reform, which
was headed by McGovern. Each
delegation must include a "fair
representation" of workers, women,
minority groups and various age
groups.
