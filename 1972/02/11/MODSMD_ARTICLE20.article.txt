# Splendid Concert By Quartet
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
Tuesday's splendid opening portion of the Julliard Quartet's cycle
of Mozart string quintets reaffirmed forcefully that chamber music
must be seen, not merely heard. The great classical chamber
music—especially Mozart and Haydn's—is eminently conversational;
these composers constructed their works with the same rhetorical
tools that are used to speak in sentences and paragraphs. And their
aim was at witty musical colloquy, unexpected repartee, and elegant
sociability.
As expressions of this intimate, humane and conversational nature
of chamber music, Mozart's quintets can hardly be equalled. And this
is why it is necessary to see them performed: the radio, television and
telephone give us enough disembodied voices. It is a shame, then, to
listen (as most people do) to chamber music oniy through electronic
means. The result is anonymity—not for the music and musicians but
for the listener, whose absence makes it impossible for him to
appreciate the visual aspect of the conversation. Try following a
multiple conversation on the other end of a telephone line; such is the
hard fate of the arm-chair chamber music listener.
So much for the hard sell. One thing is quite certain, the Julliard
Quartet (plus violist John Graham) requires no puffery. It has along,
impeccable reputation. To call it the best of its kind in the United
States would, I suspect, elicit small debate.
Effective Marshalling
The Julliard sound relies less upon unanimity of temper than upon
the effective marshalling of quite distinct personalities: Ist violin
Robert Mann's firebrand aggressiveness (which causes some harsh
moments) Samuel Rhodes' especially fine lyricism where the viola line
permits, together with Klaus Adam's versatile cello, which can be
grumpily rumbustious or condescendingly recessive as occasion
demands. Earl Carlyss, second violin, and John Graham, second viola,
lent expert support.
The Quintet in C minor (k.406, 1787) was Mozart's first essay in
the rather rare form of quartet plus viola. Though it possesses the
invariable fluency and adventurous modulation of Mozart, this work is

perhaps the least interesting of the six. The orchestration tends to
relax into a tri partite opposition, and this has the effect of making
the over-all "sound" seem rather heavy. The result is too close for
comfort to the common Viennese quartet-grinding of the time which
never ceases to be elegant but never daring either.
Nor is the melodic invention on a par with the other quintets. The
stolid character of K. 406 may be explained by noting that it is
essentially a transcription of a serenade for eight wind instruments
Mozart had written five years earlier. Though the Julliard played it
engagingly and with perfect gentility, K. 406 is at best a hint of things
to come.
Full Throttle
The Quintet in C major (K. 515, 1787) is Mozart at full throttle,
with melodic and rhetorical inventiveness that is simply unstoppable.
Though perhaps no composer respected or thought more in terms of
conventions, they always seem to be utterly at his mercy. This
conservative rebelliousness is exemplified in the C major quintet. The
humor, calculated perversities and artificial artlessness of the first
movement are wonderful; the minuet movement—achievable probably
only by Mozart brought a sense of spiritual involvement to the
shallow minuet-laendler idiom.
The last two movements of K. 515 were the evening's highlight.
The Andante is one of those patented Mozartean edifices of supreme
contentment and control. It is in the slow movements, like this one,
that I find most abundant the most impressive of all Mozart's
powers—the power to cope. The Allegro finale (hardly "graceful and
placid" as the program notes asserted) show Mozart at his most
puckish and exhilirating: the symphonies contain nothing in this vein
to surpass it.
Sandwiched indigestibly between the Mozart was Milton Babbitt's
fourth String Quartet (1970), which was commissioned especially for
the Julliard (by one of its enemies I should think). The price of the
honor is presumably the Julliard's sense of obligation to play it. One
can react to this string work on many levels:
A. Gut: More of same from the Pluck-and-Whine School of modern
violin composition.
B. Whimsical: The quartet should be sub-titled "Illusion of Space
(Empty)" or "Faucet: Dripping Violently". It is an elaborate musical
version of the Chinese water torture.
Predictable Isolation
C. Literary: The work ought to be compared with "Finnegan's
Wake." about which Joyce said "I have discovered I can do anything
with language I want." Babbitt makes the same assertion about music.
The predictable result of such arrogance is isolation; they may do
whatever they want with words (Joyce) or notes (Babbitt) but they
risk doing it alone. (NOTE: It is interesting to observe that Babbitt's
own explanation of his work in the Program was almost totally
incomprehensible!)
D. Allegorical: Babbitt gives us music that reflects our times:
astringent, incomprehensible as it passes us by, giving not even the
semblance of order, a meaningless filler of time and space to no
recognizable purpose.
E. Desperately Solicitous: Though giving little room for
interpretation by the players or understanding by the audience,
Babbitt does achieve that which modern music is so curiously
obsessed to do, fill up and characterize space. This is perhaps why
(and this is unthinkable for Mozart) the Babbitt work is much more
effective if listened to with the eyes closed, which is necessary to aid
the composer's disembodying and de-rationalizing tendencies. The
modernity of the piece is perfect and cries to be heard in a
quadrosonic system.
