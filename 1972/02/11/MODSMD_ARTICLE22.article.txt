Due to last minute changes
in film schedules which have
occurred in the lastfew weeks,
the Daily would again strongly
request that ALL groups
showing films on campus send
us schedules of their films and
when there is a late change,
that they notify us either in
writing or by calling the Daily
at 321-2300 X 4632.
