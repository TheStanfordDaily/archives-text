There are a lot of athletes at Stanford who aren't going to the
Olympics in Munich. Or being considered for the pro draft. Or
planning on endorsing any sports equipment, or posing for Sports
Illustrated poster pictures. I mean, they work hard, and they're
excellent performers, but they just aren't getting the publicity like
Bunce or Hug or Job or Timm Williams.
Like my friend, R. Bruce Henry. He's a fine runner, puts out in
practice, sprinted in Stanford's winning mile-relay effort at the recent
San Francisco Examiner Invitational; he runs a :49.2 for the quarter
mile, a :22.4 for the 220, and intercepted twice during an intra-mural
football game last fall. I'm sure in his own way, Bruce is just as fine a
guy as Bunce or Job—but the press simply isn't beating down his door.
I'm convinced it's his lack of image, and since I'm concerned about
the abuse the media is taking for not presenting fair pictures, equal
time, etc., I decided to talk to Bruce and see if we couldn't do
something about it.
Long Hair
Lots of famous athletes are growing their hair long. There's a
regulation, though, about how long you can wear your hair on the
track team during the season, so Bruce is trying a moustache. It's been
three weeks now, however, and Mr. Jordan, the track coach, still
hasn't noticed—and I hand't either until Bruce said something about
it, and I see him every day.
So how about unique experiences that have shaped his athletic
career until he has reached the level he's at now? Brian Job, the
Olympic swimmer, trained in a lake for years, and fell off a diving
board and broke his neck before a big meet; Jeff Siemon, the new
Minnesota Viking, has been greatly influenced by the Campus
Christian Crusade.
Unique Experience
We thought about putting something like "Bruce has overcome
great physical pain to become one of Stanford's top sprinters," but
pulling a hamstring at the Examiner meet was stretching the point. I
reminded him about the time he singlehandedly defeated a group of
crazed fraternity men by buzzing their residence on his motorcycle,
setting off firecrackers with a lighted cigarette; THIS is the stuff of
which charisma and images are made. He seemed doubtful, though,
especially about revealing the episode with the cigarette, least the
track people get the wrong idea; I couldn't understand it, because he
doesn't smoke, and nearly died when he accidentally inhaled instead
of lighting another firecracker.
Could Have Helped
All famous athletes are famous because they've been interviewed.
Here, I was in a position to help Bruce. "What tfb you run?" "The
quarter and the 220." "Where are you from?" "Dayton." "Do you
want to go to the Olympics?" "Sure,Hellsfire!"
1 don't care. Bruce Henry is a fine runner, a hard worker, and he
always has something nice to say at breakfast. Let the publicists and
Sports Illustrated mess up somebody else's life.
