# Baseball Team Impressive In Opener
## 
### STAN WILSON 
Stanford's Varsity baseball
team, led by outstanding pitching
performances from Bob
Kammeyer, Dan Shaw, Bob Di
Pietro, and Nick Peterson, opened
the 1972 campaign with a pair of
wins over USF and the
Philadelphia Rookies. The Indians
beat the Phillies 3-1, with Shaw
receiving credit for the win, and
on Wednesday Di Pietro was the
winner in a 6-0 decision over USF.
Coach Ray Young described
the victory over the Phillies as a

"well played game. The batting
was less aggressive than it could
have been, but the pitching was
excellent," explained Coach
Young. Stanford had plenty of
scoring opportunities, but could
capitalize on only three occasions.
Starts Rally
Second baseman Dave Edson
got things started for Stanford in
the fifth, with his run-scoring
single following two base hits and
a sacrifice. The Indians scored
their second run in the seventh on
two walks and a double by stellar

outfielder Rod Boone. The
Indians scored their final run in
the eighth inning on two base hits
and a sacrifice fly.
The Phillies could only manage
one run, that coming in the
fourth. A base hit, a hit batter,
and a fielders choice produced the
lone score for the Phillies. They
had some early threats, but "our
pitching got us out," explained
Coach Young. Kammeyer pitched
the first five innings against the
Phillies at Stanford's Sunken
Diamond, and Shaw threw the
final four innings for the win.
On Wednesday Di Pietro and
Peterson extended Stanford's
excellent pitching record, shutting
out offense-minded USF 6-0. The
pair gave up only six hits, and in
the two games Stanford pitchers
have yielded only three walks, an
exceptional record this early in
the season.
Offense Improves
Offensively, Stanford
continued to improve. Stanford
batters struck out only once
against USF, and managed seven
hits in important situations.
Coach Young was again pleased
with the defense, which produced
only one minor error, and
managed a pickoff. Sophomore

catcher Ed Orrizzi performed well
in his first starting role. Orrizzi, a
6'l" right-hander from
Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, drove
in Stanford's final two runs with a
double in the sixth inning. The
Indians played "very consistent
ball," playing 15 men in their
second victory at Sunken
Diamond. Coach Young
substituted freely, as in the first
game where sixteen players saw
action, in an effort to give
everyone a chance.
Stanford scored its first four
runs in the fourth inning on a
series of hits, errors, and
sacrifices.
The Indians go after win
number three today at Sunken
Diamond, playing the Phillies
again. Tom
Changnon, Randy Whittell, and
Mike Higgins will share the
pitching duties. Saturday Stanford
meets USF again, in a
doubleheader at Sunken
Diamond.
