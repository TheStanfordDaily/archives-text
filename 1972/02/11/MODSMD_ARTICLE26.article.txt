# Swimmers Face Tough Meets In LA
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
The Stanford swimming team
travels south this weekend to face
two of the nations strongest
swimming powers, UCLA and
USC. The Trojans are the only
team given any chance to beat
powerful Indiana for the NCAA
title, while UCLA has been picked
to finish third.
USC has an extremely well
balanced team with depth in every
event. In the 1000 and 500 free
they have 400 meter free world
record holder, Tom Mcßreen, who
is currently in the top three in the
country in both events. He is
backed up by BengtGingsjo, a
freshman from Sweden, who is in
the top ten in both events so far
this year.
Strong in 200 Free
In the 200 free the Trojans can

choose from any of a number of
swimmers who will probably be in
the NCAA finals in this event.
They have defending NCAA
champion James McConica,
freshman standout Ed McClesky,
and sophomore Kim Tutt. In the
sprints they have their
inspirational leader, Frank Heckl,
who won six gold medals at the
Pan American Games. So far this
year he has the third fastest 50
free and the fastest 100 free times
in the country.
In the 200 IM USC's Bruce
Kocsis, who also will probably
swim the 200 back, and Steve
Furniss both have recorded times
this year that are ranked in the
nation's top ten. In the 200 Fly
they have two possible NCAA
finalists in Robbie Orr and Chip
Furniss as both have recorded

excellent early season times. USC
has two strong relays and
Stanford will be hard pressed to
win either of them.
Trojan's Weak Spots
If the Trojans have any weak
spots they are in the 200 back
where Randy Whitchurch has a
good chance of winning, with the
possibility of Jack Deppe getting
second or third; and the 200
breast where Brian Job and Dave
Schilling should be able to get
first and second. On the basis of
times turned in this year, USC has
to be figured to get first and
second in the 1000, 500, and 200
free, the 200 IM and the 200 fly.
They also must be favored to win
the 50 and 100 free and both the
medley and freestyle relays.
The UCLA Bruins are strong
but don't have quite the front line
strength that USC has. The Bruins
are tough in the 1000 and 500
free with Steve Genter and Tim
McDonnell who both are
currently in the top ten in the
country in these events. Dave
O'Malley, who was instrumental
in the Bruins defeating Stanford
last year will again swim in the
200 and 100 free. He has recorded
times that are in the top ten in
both events this year.

In the 50 free UCLA has Barry
Townsend, last year's second
place finisher in the NCAA's.
However, Townsend has not been
very impressive so far this year,
and the Indians may be able to
pick up a win here. In the 200 IM
the Bruins rely on Cart Thomas
and bernie Steuson, who will also
probably swim the 200 fly. Both
Bruins will be tough for the
Indians to beat. In the 200 fly,
along with Stenson, they have
Bob Clark, last years second place
finisher at the NCAA's in this
event.
UCLA has a potential NCAA
200 back finalist in Steve Doyle,
along with senior Steve Gentes.
However, neither has done as well
as Whitchurch so far this year. In
the 200 breast, Job and Schilling
should go one-two, but they will
receive a good race from NCAA
record holder in the 100 brest,
Tom Bruce. Both relays will be
very close and who wins them will
go a long way in determining the
outcome of the meet.
Little Chance to Beat SC
On paper it appears that
Stanford has little chance of being
USC, and will have to be at its
best to defeat UCLA' Both USC
and UCLA have excellent front

line swimmers, and have good
depth to back them up.
Fortunately, however, swim meets
aren't won on paper. Coach Jim
Gaughran believes that beating
USC is a very remote possibility as
they are extremely strong. He
believes, however, that the Indians
have a good chance to beat
UCLA. By Gaughran's estimate,
the Indians must win the medley
relay and do well in such events as
the 1000 free, the 200 fly and the
sprints, along with getting
expected points in the 200 brest
and 200 back.
Gaughran expects that Stanford
will produce good times even if
they aren't able to defeat SC and
UCLA' He states, "We haven't
really had a chance to rest this
year, and many of our freshmen
and sophomores have never swam
in such a high quality meet."
Gaughran believes f hat both these
factors will mean that everyone
will be hitting their best times of
the season this weekend.
Gaughran states, that "losing both
these meets this weekend will not
be the end of the world. We are
looking for good times more than
anything else, and these meets will
be a good indication of how we
are progressing."

Schilling should be able to get
first and second. On the basis of
times turned in this year, USC has
to be figured to get first and
second in the 1000, 500, and 200
free, the 200 IM and the 200 fly.
They also must be favored to win
the 50 and 100 free and both the
medley and freestyle relays.
The UCLA Bruins are strong
but don't have quite the front line
strength that USC has. The Bruins
are tough in the 1000 and 500
free with Steve Genter and Tim
McDonnell who both are
currently in the top ten in the
country in these events. Dave
O'Malley, who was instrumental
in the Bruins defeating Stanford
last year will again swim in the
200 and 100 free. He has recorded
times that are in the top ten in
both events this year.

In the 50 free UCLA has Barry
Townsend, last year's second
place finisher in the NCAA's.
However, Townsend has not been
very impressive so far this year,
and the Indians may be able to
pick up a win here. In the 200 IM
the Bruins rely on Cart Thomas
and bernie Steuson, who will also
probably swim the 200 fly. Both
Bruins will be tough for the
Indians to beat. In the 200 fly,
along with Stenson, they have
Bob Clark, last years second place
finisher at the NCAA's in this
event.
UCLA has a potential NCAA
200 back finalist in Steve Doyle,
along with senior Steve Gentes.
However, neither has done as well
as Whitchurch so far this year. In
the 200 breast, Job and Schilling
should go one-two, but they will
receive a good race from NCAA
record holder in the 100 brest,
Tom Bruce. Both relays will be
very close and who wins them will
go a long way in determining the
outcome of the meet.
Little Chance to Beat SC
On paper it appears that
Stanford has little chance of being
USC, and will have to be at its
best to defeat UCLA' Both USC
and UCLA have excellent front

line swimmers, and have good
depth to back them up.
Fortunately, however, swim meets
aren't won on paper. Coach Jim
Gaughran believes that beating
USC is a very remote possibility as
they are extremely strong. He
believes, however, that the Indians
have a good chance to beat
UCLA. By Gaughran's estimate,
the Indians must win the medley
relay and do well in such events as
the 1000 free, the 200 fly and the
sprints, along with getting
expected points in the 200 brest
and 200 back.
Gaughran expects that Stanford
will produce good times even if
they aren't able to defeat SC and
UCLA' He states, "We haven't
really had a chance to rest this
year, and many of our freshmen
and sophomores have never swam
in such a high quality meet."
Gaughran believes f hat both these
factors will mean that everyone
will be hitting their best times of
the season this weekend.
Gaughran states, that "losing both
these meets this weekend will not
be the end of the world. We are
looking for good times more than
anything else, and these meets will
be a good indication of how we
are progressing."

Stalker. Longinotti and Stalker will carry Stanford's fly hopes into this weekend's competition with national powers USC and UCLA. The Indians chances for victory are slim against
the Trojans, the only team in the country given a chance to beat powerhouse Indiana. A supreme effort, however, could bring upsets in either of the meets to be held tonight and

The Stanford swimming team
travels south this weekend to face
two of the nations strongest
swimming powers, UCLA and
USC. The Trojans are the only
team given any chance to beat
powerful Indiana for the NCAA
title, while UCLA has been picked
to finish third.
USC has an extremely well
balanced team with depth in every
event. In the 1000 and 500 free
they have 400 meter free world
record holder, Tom Mcßreen, who
is currently in the top three in the
country in both events. He is
backed up by BengtGingsjo, a
freshman from Sweden, who is in
the top ten in both events so far
this year.
Strong in 200 Free
In the 200 free the Trojans can

choose from any of a number of
swimmers who will probably be in
the NCAA finals in this event.
They have defending NCAA
champion James McConica,
freshman standout Ed McClesky,
and sophomore Kim Tutt. In the
sprints they have their
inspirational leader, Frank Heckl,
who won six gold medals at the
Pan American Games. So far this
year he has the third fastest 50
free and the fastest 100 free times
in the country.
In the 200 IM USC's Bruce
Kocsis, who also will probably
swim the 200 back, and Steve
Furniss both have recorded times
this year that are ranked in the
nation's top ten. In the 200 Fly
they have two possible NCAA
finalists in Robbie Orr and Chip
Furniss as both have recorded

excellent early season times. USC
has two strong relays and
Stanford will be hard pressed to
win either of them.
Trojan's Weak Spots
If the Trojans have any weak
spots they are in the 200 back
where Randy Whitchurch has a
good chance of winning, with the
possibility of Jack Deppe getting
second or third; and the 200
breast where Brian Job and Dave

first and second. On the basis of

go a long way in determining the
outcome of the meet.
Little Chance to Beat SC
On paper it appears that
Stanford has little chance of being
USC, and will have to be at its
best to defeat UCLA' Both USC
and UCLA have excellent front

line swimmers, and have good
depth to back them up.
Fortunately, however, swim meets
aren't won on paper. Coach Jim
Gaughran believes that beating
USC is a very remote possibility as
they are extremely strong. He
believes, however, that the Indians
have a good chance to beat
UCLA. By Gaughran's estimate,
the Indians must win the medley
relay and do well in such events as
the 1000 free, the 200 fly and the
sprints, along with getting
expected points in the 200 brest
and 200 back.
Gaughran expects that Stanford
will produce good times even if
they aren't able to defeat SC and
UCLA' He states, "We haven't
really had a chance to rest this
year, and many of our freshmen
and sophomores have never swam
in such a high quality meet."
Gaughran believes f hat both these
factors will mean that everyone
will be hitting their best times of
the season this weekend.
Gaughran states, that "losing both
these meets this weekend will not
be the end of the world. We are
looking for good times more than
anything else, and these meets will
be a good indication of how we
are progressing."

RIGHT MAN THIS TlME—This picture was printed earlier in the quarter and the swimmer was incorrectly identified as Rich Longinotti. The butterflier involved in really Jock
Stalker. Longinotti and Stalker will carry Stanford's fly hopes into this weekend's competition with national powers USC and UCLA. The Indians chances for victory are slim against
the Trojans, the only team in the country given a chance to beat powerhouse Indiana. A supreme effort, however, could bring upsets in either of the meets to be held tonight and
tomorrow night in Los Angeles.
The Stanford swimming team
travels south this weekend to face
two of the nations strongest
swimming powers, UCLA and
USC. The Trojans are the only
team given any chance to beat
powerful Indiana for the NCAA
title, while UCLA has been picked
to finish third.
USC has an extremely well
balanced team with depth in every
event. In the 1000 and 500 free
they have 400 meter free world
record holder, Tom Mcßreen, who
is currently in the top three in the
country in both events. He is
backed up by BengtGingsjo, a
freshman from Sweden, who is in
the top ten in both events so far
this year.
Strong in 200 Free
In the 200 free the Trojans can

choose from any of a number of
swimmers who will probably be in
the NCAA finals in this event.
They have defending NCAA
champion James McConica,
freshman standout Ed McClesky,
and sophomore Kim Tutt. In the
sprints they have their
inspirational leader, Frank Heckl,
who won six gold medals at the
Pan American Games. So far this
year he has the third fastest 50
free and the fastest 100 free times
in the country.
In the 200 IM USC's Bruce
Kocsis, who also will probably
swim the 200 back, and Steve
Furniss both have recorded times
this year that are ranked in the
nation's top ten. In the 200 Fly
they have two possible NCAA
finalists in Robbie Orr and Chip
Furniss as both have recorded

excellent early season times. USC
has two strong relays and
Stanford will be hard pressed to
win either of them.
Trojan's Weak Spots
If the Trojans have any weak
spots they are in the 200 back
where Randy Whitchurch has a
good chance of winning, with the
possibility of Jack Deppe getting
second or third; and the 200
breast where Brian Job and Dave
Schilling should be able to get
first and second. On the basis of
times turned in this year, USC has
to be figured to get first and
second in the 1000, 500, and 200
free, the 200 IM and the 200 fly.
They also must be favored to win
the 50 and 100 free and both the
medley and freestyle relays.
The UCLA Bruins are strong
but don't have quite the front line
strength that USC has. The Bruins
are tough in the 1000 and 500
free with Steve Genter and Tim
McDonnell who both are
currently in the top ten in the
country in these events. Dave
O'Malley, who was instrumental
in the Bruins defeating Stanford
last year will again swim in the
200 and 100 free. He has recorded
times that are in the top ten in
both events this year.

In the 50 free UCLA has Barry
Townsend, last year's second
place finisher in the NCAA's.
However, Townsend has not been
very impressive so far this year,
and the Indians may be able to
pick up a win here. In the 200 IM
the Bruins rely on Cart Thomas
and bernie Steuson, who will also
probably swim the 200 fly. Both
Bruins will be tough for the
Indians to beat. In the 200 fly,
along with Stenson, they have
Bob Clark, last years second place
finisher at the NCAA's in this
event.
UCLA has a potential NCAA
200 back finalist in Steve Doyle,
along with senior Steve Gentes.
However, neither has done as well
as Whitchurch so far this year. In
the 200 breast, Job and Schilling
should go one-two, but they will
receive a good race from NCAA
record holder in the 100 brest,
Tom Bruce. Both relays will be
very close and who wins them will
go a long way in determining the
outcome of the meet.
