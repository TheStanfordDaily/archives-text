afternoon in the regionally
televised Pacific-Eight Game of

record and are in last place in the
standings.

fourth place in the conference

Francisco freshmen at 6:00 p.m.

starts at 2:30, with the freshmen
playing St. Mary's freshmen at

NO, THIS IS NOT THE ROSE BOWL—Don Bunce chases a loose ball in a rugby match with the San
Francisco Rugby Club. This play is similar to his fourth quarter fumble in the Rose Bowl. Don did not
recover that bobble, but played brilliantly the rest of the game to give the Cards a one poirt win. He
recovered the ball in the shot above and passed it out to a teammate. The Indians will face the Bats in an
exciting match here tomorrow at 1:30 p.m.
