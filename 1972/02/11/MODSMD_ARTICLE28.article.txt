# Whad'ya Hear, Whad'ya Say
## Who Will Decide? 
### Charlie Hoffman 
Events have moved very
quickly in the controversy over
the use of the Indian as the
Stanford athletic symbol. A week
ago, 55 Native Americans on
campus petitioned the president
to eliminate the Indian as the
school's mascot. Both President
Lyman and Ombudsman Lois
Amsterdam expressed sympathy
with the petitioners plight, and it
appeared that the Indian symbol's
fate was a foregone conclusion.
This week, however, dissenting
voices arose and produced a
debate on the issue involving all
sectors of the University
community. (See Letters section
below). The interest of the
Stanford community in the issue
has been great, but there are
elements threatening to cut it out
of the decision making process.
In Amsterdam's
recommendation to the President,
the Ombudsman urged that a
decision must be reached quickly
and that community's role in the
process should be minimal, saying
. .neither a committee nor the
input of popular opinion seem
appropriate on the question
whether the University should
cease to use a debasing racial
symbol."
Presidential assistant William
Stone, however, calmed fears that
the decision would be made
without input from the
community. "The President has
not opened the Ombudsman's
recommendation or the petition,

but a committee will probably be
formed and we will move slowly
in making this decision in order to
study all opinions."
Yet another threat to popular
decision making came last night at
the Student Senate meeting when
ASSU President Doug McHenry
recommended that the Senate
vote to eliminate the Indian
symbol and then let the students
decide on the new mascot in a
referendum. McHenry stated,
"The students are ignorant of
what institutional racism is all
about. This could be a problem of
a democratic system squashing the
rights of a minority."
It is unfortunate that
Amsterdam and McHenry see fit
to cut everyone else out of the
decision making. This issue is a
sensitive one and the principles
involved are very important. To
surround the issue with political
maneuverings and plunge it into
the cesspool of power politics
defames and degrades the issue at

hand.
The issue of the Indian symbol
cannot be resolved until it is fully
understood. To this end, input
from the interested parties and
the community which will be
affected should be sought. The
Native Americans on campus and
their brothers outside should meet
and discuss their differences.
It is my hope, as expressed in
last Monday's sports editorial,
that a compromise can be reached
wherein the Indian symbol can be
retained and the Native Americans
can structure the image to their
benefit. The general sentiment
among the Native Americans on
campus is that my proposal is too
idealistic and impractical. If the
Native Americans truly want to
bring people to a full appreciation
of their priceless heritage, they
should make some small effort to
examine the possibility of using
the Stanford Indian to aid them in
their just cause instead of
shunning it.

LOOK QUICKLY, YOU MAY NOT SEE THIS AGAIN—This photo of the 1972 Rose Bowl with Stanford's end zone flanked by a pair of
Indian figures may be a collector's item for more reasons than one. First, the Cards may not see the inside of the Rose Bowl for awhile.
Secondly, if and when we get to Pasadena again, there might not be any images of Indians gracing the end zone. The outcome of the current

formed and we will move slowly
in making this decision in order to
study all opinions."
Yet another threat to popular
decision making came last night at
the Student Senate meeting when
ASSU President Doug McHenry
recommended that the Senate
vote to eliminate the Indian
symbol and then let the students
decide on the new mascot in a
referendum. McHenry stated,
"The students are ignorant of
what institutional racism is all
about. This could be a problem of
a democratic system squashing the
rights of a minority."
It is unfortunate that
Amsterdam and McHenry see fit
to cut everyone else out of the
decision making. This issue is a
sensitive one and the principles
involved are very important. To
surround the issue with political
maneuverings and plunge it into
the cesspool of power politics
defames and degrades the issue at

hand.
The issue of the Indian symbol
cannot be resolved until it is fully
understood. To this end, input
from the interested parties and
the community which will be
affected should be sought. The
Native Americans on campus and
their brothers outside should meet
and discuss their differences.
It is my hope, as expressed in
last Monday's sports editorial,
that a compromise can be reached
wherein the Indian symbol can be
retained and the Native Americans
can structure the image to their
benefit. The general sentiment
among the Native Americans on
campus is that my proposal is too
idealistic and impractical. If the
Native Americans truly want to
bring people to a full appreciation
of their priceless heritage, they
should make some small effort to
examine the possibility of using
the Stanford Indian to aid them in
their just cause instead of
shunning it.

LOOK QUICKLY, YOU MAY NOT SEE THIS AGAIN—This photo of the 1972 Rose Bowl with Stanford's end zone flanked by a pair of
Indian figures may be a collector's item for more reasons than one. First, the Cards may not see the inside of the Rose Bowl for awhile.
Secondly, if and when we get to Pasadena again, there might not be any images of Indians gracing the end zone. The outcome of the current
campus controversy over Stanford's symbol will resolve this.
Events have moved very
quickly in the controversy over
the use of the Indian as the
Stanford athletic symbol. A week
ago, 55 Native Americans on
campus petitioned the president
to eliminate the Indian as the
school's mascot. Both President
Lyman and Ombudsman Lois
Amsterdam expressed sympathy
with the petitioners plight, and it
appeared that the Indian symbol's
fate was a foregone conclusion.
This week, however, dissenting
voices arose and produced a
debate on the issue involving all
sectors of the University
community. (See Letters section
below). The interest of the
Stanford community in the issue
has been great, but there are
elements threatening to cut it out
of the decision making process.
In Amsterdam's
recommendation to the President,
the Ombudsman urged that a
decision must be reached quickly
and that community's role in the
process should be minimal, saying
. .neither a committee nor the
input of popular opinion seem
appropriate on the question
whether the University should
cease to use a debasing racial
symbol."
Presidential assistant William
Stone, however, calmed fears that
the decision would be made
without input from the
community. "The President has
not opened the Ombudsman's
recommendation or the petition,

but a committee will probably be
formed and we will move slowly
in making this decision in order to
study all opinions."
