# Community Reaction To Indian Symbol Debate
## 
### 
Editorial Misunderstands
Editor, THE DAILY:
As two white students living in
Loro, the Native American house,
we feel that the recent sports
editorial (Feb. 7) concerning the
continued use of the Indian as a
mascot displays a lack of
understanding of the issue. We are
in complete sympathy with those
in our house who have petitioned
that the symbol be abolished.
Having lived here for two
quarters, we can only see this
article as an attempt to assuage
white consciences by
intellectually rationalizing the use
of the mascot as if Stanford were
doing the Indian people a favor by
"advertising" their culture. A
people's culture and heritage
cannot be represented by another
people—least of all a football team
and athletic department.
It is sheer rhetoric to say that
"the symbol of the Indian can be
implemented so as to present the
true image of the Native American
that can be understood,
empathized with, and respected."
How can a football team at
Stanford University be compared
to the Native American people?
How can Stanford feel it has the
right to suggest such a
connection?
We believe that the mascot is
deeply insulting to the Native
American students here, that the
university community should try
to see it from their point of view
and that their demands should be
implemented.

We defend the use of the
American Indian as the symbol of
Stanford's athletic efforts, and
look upon this tradition as a great
honor to all Native Americans.
The Indian was chosen because of
his image as a brave warrior,
known for his physical prowess
and cunning. This image embodies
the ideals for which our athletes
strive.
Other schools also use a group
of people as their mascot
(Trojans? Vikings?). These were
chosen because of their strength
and vigor. It is true that
occasionally a Viking may be
depicted as a fat little man with
long moustace and beard (a la
Santa Claus).
Does this mean that those of
Scandinavian descent should be so
super-sensitive as to cause an
uproar over the use of this
symbol? Obviously, changes could
be made to eliminate any overt
ridicule or disrespect in regard to

the Indian. However, we agree
with the Daily sports staff in that
it would be an ill-considered
decision to abolish the Indian
altogether.

I am compelled to respond to
some recent comments appearing
in the Daily on the Indian mascot
and symbolism issue.
It seems that some years after
others appropriate the Indian
lands in the area, Stanford
appropriate the Indian name and
symbolism. It has been
subsequently used without the
consent of the Indians to
represent students who are not at
all Indians and in a manner
insensitive to the Indian culture.
The most obvious affront to
the native american community is
Prince Lightfoot's performance of
a religious ritual which is, to the
native americans and their elders a
sacred rite and no more
appropriate for the entertainment
of a sports crowd than would be
High Mass to a Roman Catholic.
Lightfoot's hexing the opposing
team is somewhat akin to having
Billy Graham calling down the
forces of hell onto the heads of
the visiting "sinners." More subtle
but nevertheless offensive is the
paternalistically racist argument
that we Anglos are really using the
Indian's name in a way that is
good for them and will bring
honor to them and why don't
they understand our good
intentions? I hope that most of us
have lost enough of our racial
naivete to recognize this elitist
view for what it is, even though
some older Indian alumni and
friends of Stanford may not.
But regardless of these
arguments, if any racial minority
on campus unanimously requests
that the university not use their
name and symbolism in a manner
which that minority feels is
insensitive and degrading to them,
we should respect that request. If
we cannot accommodate the
Stanford Native American
Community in this petition, then
all other attempts at advising and
tutorial assistance will be hollow
indeed.

Editor, THE DAILY:
As a personal friend of Timm

Williams (better known as Prince
Lightfoot), I disagree with the
Daily's opinion concerning the use
of the "Indian" name in
connection with Stanford and
Timm's dancing at Stanford
football games.
Everyone knows why the
Indian name was chosen 40 years
ago—some of the ideal
characteristics of American
Indians are their honesty, courage
and perseverance. If being called
this is stereotyping, then it merely
gives the Indian people a legacy
which all of us might try to copy.
No one can be forced to live up to
an image if they do not so desire;
the Indian students on campus are
certainly free to accept or reject
any of these ideals if they so
desire.
Anyone who has had contact
with Timm Williams realizes that
he is hardly unreal, "inauthentic"
(to use the Daily's unfortunate
term) or stereotyped. Timm is the
leader of his own Yurok tribe in
Northern California as well as the
representative of over 50,000
American Indians in the U.S. It
was largely through Timm's
efforts that the National Indian
Health Board was founded and
operating today. Timm has been
elected the chairman of another
Indian Health group for three
years in succession, and the
people who elected him were
Indians—32 representatives of
other Indian groups.
Timm has danced at Stanford
for over 20 years, and when
people here talk with him during
his stay on campus, they realize
that he lives up to the ideals that
he represents when he dances
here. Wherever Timm goes
throughout his travels in this
country, American Indians,
government officials and everyone
else he meets recognize him as a
representative of Stanford, and
Timm always takes care to live up
to this responsibility because he
wants to. Timm is proud to lend
his talent to an institution such as
Stanford, because he realizes that
the ideals of the University are his
ideals.
Timm is a real Indian and his
dances are real. It is part of his
personal legacy as a human being
and as a member and leader of the
Indian nation. Timm dances not
only to entertain but to show who
he is, and he feels no shame in it.
The Indian community should
show pride in having a
representative such as Timm in
the Stanford community. Timm is
proud of his heritage as are most

Indians, and the Indians who he
represents throughout the country
are proud of him.

White Liberal Rhetoric
Editor, THE DAILY:
We believe that Robert Larson's
article reinterpreted the issue of
the blatant and insensitive misuse
of the Indian as the Stanford
symbol as being another case of
white liberals seeking absolution
of their sins. His misinterpretation
of the issue once again gave the
Stanford Community another
example of the white liberal
rhetoric and selfishness that is
ever existent. It seems that he has
entwined himself in his rhetoric in
an attempt to take advantage of
the issue in order to express his
discontent with the University
Administration instead of stating
his reasons why the Stanford
Indian symbol must be saved from
the "masochistic miasma" that
seems to pervade the Stanford
Community.
Mr. Larson slights the
Community's "lack of sensitivity"
in regard to the Native Americans'
culture, religion, tradition and
self-respect. We believe that the
article has exemplified the lack of
human compassion and
understanding that is found in
certain strata of this campus.
Also, it was mentioned that the
dropping of the Indian as the
Stanford symbol would be the
rash destruction of a proud
tradition. We fail to recognize the
correlation between the Stanford
Indian and the "proud tradition"
of the University. <
Surely, the members of this
Community do not give this
tradition priority over the
cross-cultural respect due our
Native Americans: we believe that
the Stanford Indian tradition
cannot be considered intelligibly
equal with that of the Native
American, which has evolved over
hundreds of years. If Mr. Larson
believes that the Stanford Indian
evokes pride essential to the
tradition of this University, we
ask, is the price that we must pay
the degradation of our Native
Americans' heritage?
Mr. Larson commends the
Native Americans for their
"perceptive insight" into the
psychology of the University
Administration. We wish to
expose his article as another

opportunistic attack on the
University Administration at the
expense of an issue important to
the Native Americans of this
nation.

What's In A Nickname?
Editor, THE DAILY:
I suggest that the only reason
for real Indians to get upset is if
there is a case for believing that
Stanford's athletic teams were
named after them as some sort of
joke, like "Hey gang, how's this
for cool. Let's call ourselves
Indians. Plenty wampum, plenty
squaws, plenty crazy when drink
firewater." Instead, it seems likely
that the name was chosen at a
time when the aim was to endow
one's teams with courage,
strength, and respect.
Stanford's Indians—the real
article, that is—should take a poll
to see if others feel that the name
and the image is thought to be
derisive. This is definitely a case
where their opinions shouldn't
count. What really counts is
whether the public thinks that Lo,
the Poor Indian is being ridiculed.
I believe that a poll would dispel
any such illusion.- And by the
way, part of my family came
from Oklahoma, which has had
Indian governors and such, and
one of my aunts and my
daughter-in-law (I'm getting along
in years, obviously) are part
Indian.
Maybe the Indians should look
around before they go on the
warpath. How about USC's
Trojans? Should the shades of
Priam and Hector and Paris return
from Hades to protest an untrojan

profile on SC'S posters? And how
about the UCLA Bruins?
UC Davis football and
basketball players have been
called the Aggies for over fifty
years. It's high time that the
California Farm Bureau
Federation objected to this
disgraceful satire of tillers of the
soil in this, our Nation's greatest
agricultural state. In fact, with no
trouble at all we might launch a
nation-wide movement to cease
and desist from disparagement of
Cornhuskers, Cowboys, Warriors,
and other minority groups, as well
as Beavers, Ducks, Huskies,
Cougars, Hawks, Broncos, Rams,
and other dignified members of
the animal kingdom.
When we get this mess cleaned

up, so that presumably no one's
feelings are hurt, we can employ
such virile and decisive names for
our muscle men as the Green
Wave, the Tide, or the Lakers,
except, of course, those are
already preempted. It is evident
that the task ahead for athletic
directors is a formidable one.

What's In A Nickname?
Editor, THE DAILY:
I suggest that the only reason
for real Indians to get upset is if
there is a case for believing that
Stanford's athletic teams were
named after them as some sort of
joke, like "Hey gang, how's this
for cool. Let's call ourselves
Indians. Plenty wampum, plenty
squaws, plenty crazy when drink
firewater." Instead, it seems likely
that the name was chosen at a
time when the aim was to endow
one's teams with courage,
strength, and respect.
Stanford's Indians—the real
article, that is—should take a poll
to see if others feel that the name
and the image is thought to be
derisive. This is definitely a case
where their opinions shouldn't
count. What really counts is
whether the public thinks that Lo,
the Poor Indian is being ridiculed.
I believe that a poll would dispel
any such illusion.- And by the
way, part of my family came
from Oklahoma, which has had
Indian governors and such, and
one of my aunts and my
daughter-in-law (I'm getting along
in years, obviously) are part
Indian.
Maybe the Indians should look
around before they go on the
warpath. How about USC's
Trojans? Should the shades of
Priam and Hector and Paris return
from Hades to protest an untrojan

profile on SC'S posters? And how
about the UCLA Bruins?
UC Davis football and
basketball players have been
called the Aggies for over fifty
years. It's high time that the
California Farm Bureau
Federation objected to this
disgraceful satire of tillers of the
soil in this, our Nation's greatest
agricultural state. In fact, with no
trouble at all we might launch a
nation-wide movement to cease
and desist from disparagement of
Cornhuskers, Cowboys, Warriors,
and other minority groups, as well
as Beavers, Ducks, Huskies,
Cougars, Hawks, Broncos, Rams,
and other dignified members of
the animal kingdom.
When we get this mess cleaned

up, so that presumably no one's
feelings are hurt, we can employ
such virile and decisive names for
our muscle men as the Green
Wave, the Tide, or the Lakers,
except, of course, those are
already preempted. It is evident
that the task ahead for athletic

Editorial Misunderstands
Editor, THE DAILY:
As two white students living in
Loro, the Native American house,
we feel that the recent sports
editorial (Feb. 7) concerning the
continued use of the Indian as a
mascot displays a lack of
understanding of the issue. We are
in complete sympathy with those
in our house who have petitioned
that the symbol be abolished.
Having lived here for two
quarters, we can only see this
article as an attempt to assuage
white consciences by
intellectually rationalizing the use
of the mascot as if Stanford were
doing the Indian people a favor by
"advertising" their culture. A
people's culture and heritage
cannot be represented by another
people—least of all a football team
and athletic department.
It is sheer rhetoric to say that
"the symbol of the Indian can be
implemented so as to present the
true image of the Native American
that can be understood,
empathized with, and respected."
How can a football team at
Stanford University be compared
to the Native American people?
How can Stanford feel it has the
right to suggest such a
connection?
We believe that the mascot is
deeply insulting to the Native
American students here, that the
university community should try
to see it from their point of view
and that their demands should be
implemented.

We defend the use of the
American Indian as the symbol of
Stanford's athletic efforts, and
look upon this tradition as a great
honor to all Native Americans.
The Indian was chosen because of
his image as a brave warrior,
known for his physical prowess
and cunning. This image embodies
the ideals for which our athletes
strive.
Other schools also use a group
of people as their mascot
(Trojans? Vikings?). These were
chosen because of their strength
and vigor. It is true that
occasionally a Viking may be
depicted as a fat little man with
long moustace and beard (a la
Santa Claus).
Does this mean that those of
Scandinavian descent should be so
super-sensitive as to cause an
uproar over the use of this
symbol? Obviously, changes could
be made to eliminate any overt
ridicule or disrespect in regard to

the Indian. However, we agree
with the Daily sports staff in that
it would be an ill-considered
decision to abolish the Indian
altogether.

I am compelled to respond to
some recent comments appearing
in the Daily on the Indian mascot
and symbolism issue.
It seems that some years after
others appropriate the Indian
lands in the area, Stanford
appropriate the Indian name and
symbolism. It has been
subsequently used without the
consent of the Indians to
represent students who are not at
all Indians and in a manner
insensitive to the Indian culture.
The most obvious affront to
the native american community is
Prince Lightfoot's performance of
a religious ritual which is, to the
native americans and their elders a
sacred rite and no more
appropriate for the entertainment
of a sports crowd than would be
High Mass to a Roman Catholic.
Lightfoot's hexing the opposing
team is somewhat akin to having
Billy Graham calling down the
forces of hell onto the heads of
the visiting "sinners." More subtle
but nevertheless offensive is the
paternalistically racist argument
that we Anglos are really using the
Indian's name in a way that is
good for them and will bring
honor to them and why don't
they understand our good
intentions? I hope that most of us
have lost enough of our racial
naivete to recognize this elitist
view for what it is, even though
some older Indian alumni and
friends of Stanford may not.
But regardless of these
arguments, if any racial minority
on campus unanimously requests
that the university not use their
name and symbolism in a manner
which that minority feels is
insensitive and degrading to them,
we should respect that request. If
we cannot accommodate the
Stanford Native American
Community in this petition, then
all other attempts at advising and
tutorial assistance will be hollow
indeed.

Editor, THE DAILY:
As a personal friend of Timm

Williams (better known as Prince
Lightfoot), I disagree with the
Daily's opinion concerning the use
of the "Indian" name in
connection with Stanford and
Timm's dancing at Stanford
football games.
Everyone knows why the
Indian name was chosen 40 years
ago—some of the ideal
characteristics of American
Indians are their honesty, courage
and perseverance. If being called
this is stereotyping, then it merely
gives the Indian people a legacy
which all of us might try to copy.
No one can be forced to live up to
an image if they do not so desire;
the Indian students on campus are
certainly free to accept or reject
any of these ideals if they so
desire.
Anyone who has had contact
with Timm Williams realizes that
he is hardly unreal, "inauthentic"
(to use the Daily's unfortunate
term) or stereotyped. Timm is the
leader of his own Yurok tribe in
Northern California as well as the
representative of over 50,000
American Indians in the U.S. It
was largely through Timm's
efforts that the National Indian
Health Board was founded and
operating today. Timm has been
elected the chairman of another
Indian Health group for three
years in succession, and the
people who elected him were
Indians—32 representatives of
other Indian groups.
Timm has danced at Stanford
for over 20 years, and when
people here talk with him during
his stay on campus, they realize
that he lives up to the ideals that
he represents when he dances
here. Wherever Timm goes
throughout his travels in this
country, American Indians,
government officials and everyone
else he meets recognize him as a
representative of Stanford, and
Timm always takes care to live up
to this responsibility because he
wants to. Timm is proud to lend
his talent to an institution such as
Stanford, because he realizes that
the ideals of the University are his
ideals.
Timm is a real Indian and his
dances are real. It is part of his
personal legacy as a human being
and as a member and leader of the
Indian nation. Timm dances not
only to entertain but to show who
he is, and he feels no shame in it.
The Indian community should
show pride in having a
representative such as Timm in
the Stanford community. Timm is
proud of his heritage as are most

Indians, and the Indians who he
represents throughout the country
are proud of him.

White Liberal Rhetoric
Editor, THE DAILY:
We believe that Robert Larson's
article reinterpreted the issue of
the blatant and insensitive misuse
of the Indian as the Stanford
symbol as being another case of
white liberals seeking absolution
of their sins. His misinterpretation
of the issue once again gave the
Stanford Community another
example of the white liberal
rhetoric and selfishness that is
ever existent. It seems that he has
entwined himself in his rhetoric in
an attempt to take advantage of
the issue in order to express his
discontent with the University
Administration instead of stating
his reasons why the Stanford
Indian symbol must be saved from
the "masochistic miasma" that
seems to pervade the Stanford
Community.
Mr. Larson slights the
Community's "lack of sensitivity"
in regard to the Native Americans'
culture, religion, tradition and
self-respect. We believe that the
article has exemplified the lack of
human compassion and
understanding that is found in
certain strata of this campus.
Also, it was mentioned that the
dropping of the Indian as the
Stanford symbol would be the
rash destruction of a proud
tradition. We fail to recognize the
correlation between the Stanford
Indian and the "proud tradition"
of the University. <
Surely, the members of this
Community do not give this
tradition priority over the
cross-cultural respect due our
Native Americans: we believe that
the Stanford Indian tradition
cannot be considered intelligibly
equal with that of the Native
American, which has evolved over
hundreds of years. If Mr. Larson
believes that the Stanford Indian
evokes pride essential to the
tradition of this University, we
ask, is the price that we must pay
the degradation of our Native
Americans' heritage?
Mr. Larson commends the
Native Americans for their
"perceptive insight" into the
psychology of the University

Timm is a real Indian and his

White Liberal Rhetoric
Editor, THE DAILY:
We believe that Robert Larson's
article reinterpreted the issue of
the blatant and insensitive misuse
of the Indian as the Stanford
symbol as being another case of
white liberals seeking absolution
of their sins. His misinterpretation
of the issue once again gave the
Stanford Community another
example of the white liberal
rhetoric and selfishness that is
ever existent. It seems that he has
entwined himself in his rhetoric in
an attempt to take advantage of
the issue in order to express his
discontent with the University
Administration instead of stating
his reasons why the Stanford
Indian symbol must be saved from
the "masochistic miasma" that
seems to pervade the Stanford
Community.
Mr. Larson slights the
Community's "lack of sensitivity"
in regard to the Native Americans'
culture, religion, tradition and
self-respect. We believe that the
article has exemplified the lack of
human compassion and
understanding that is found in
certain strata of this campus.
Also, it was mentioned that the
dropping of the Indian as the
Stanford symbol would be the
rash destruction of a proud
tradition. We fail to recognize the
correlation between the Stanford
Indian and the "proud tradition"
of the University. <
Surely, the members of this

tradition priority over the
cross-cultural respect due our
Native Americans: we believe that
the Stanford Indian tradition

ask, is the price that we must pay
the degradation of our Native

What's In A Nickname?
Editor, THE DAILY:
I suggest that the only reason
for real Indians to get upset is if
there is a case for believing that
Stanford's athletic teams were
named after them as some sort of
joke, like "Hey gang, how's this
for cool. Let's call ourselves
Indians. Plenty wampum, plenty
squaws, plenty crazy when drink
firewater." Instead, it seems likely
that the name was chosen at a
time when the aim was to endow
one's teams with courage,
strength, and respect.
Stanford's Indians—the real
article, that is—should take a poll
to see if others feel that the name
and the image is thought to be
derisive. This is definitely a case
where their opinions shouldn't
count. What really counts is
whether the public thinks that Lo,
the Poor Indian is being ridiculed.
I believe that a poll would dispel
any such illusion.- And by the
way, part of my family came
from Oklahoma, which has had
Indian governors and such, and
one of my aunts and my
daughter-in-law (I'm getting along
in years, obviously) are part
Indian.
Maybe the Indians should look
around before they go on the
warpath. How about USC's
Trojans? Should the shades of
Priam and Hector and Paris return
from Hades to protest an untrojan

profile on SC'S posters? And how
about the UCLA Bruins?
UC Davis football and
basketball players have been
called the Aggies for over fifty
years. It's high time that the
California Farm Bureau
Federation objected to this
disgraceful satire of tillers of the
soil in this, our Nation's greatest
agricultural state. In fact, with no
trouble at all we might launch a
nation-wide movement to cease
and desist from disparagement of
Cornhuskers, Cowboys, Warriors,
and other minority groups, as well
as Beavers, Ducks, Huskies,
Cougars, Hawks, Broncos, Rams,
and other dignified members of
the animal kingdom.
When we get this mess cleaned

up, so that presumably no one's
feelings are hurt, we can employ
such virile and decisive names for
our muscle men as the Green
Wave, the Tide, or the Lakers,

As two white students living in

We defend the use of the
American Indian as the symbol of

look upon this tradition as a great

The Indian was chosen because of
his image as a brave warrior,
known for his physical prowess
and cunning. This image embodies
the ideals for which our athletes
strive.
Other schools also use a group
of people as their mascot
(Trojans? Vikings?). These were
chosen because of their strength
and vigor. It is true that
occasionally a Viking may be
depicted as a fat little man with
long moustace and beard (a la
Santa Claus).
Does this mean that those of

I am compelled to respond to
some recent comments appearing
in the Daily on the Indian mascot
and symbolism issue.
It seems that some years after
others appropriate the Indian
lands in the area, Stanford
appropriate the Indian name and
symbolism. It has been
subsequently used without the
consent of the Indians to
represent students who are not at
all Indians and in a manner
insensitive to the Indian culture.
The most obvious affront to
the native american community is
Prince Lightfoot's performance of
a religious ritual which is, to the
native americans and their elders a
sacred rite and no more
appropriate for the entertainment
of a sports crowd than would be
High Mass to a Roman Catholic.
Lightfoot's hexing the opposing
team is somewhat akin to having
Billy Graham calling down the
forces of hell onto the heads of
the visiting "sinners." More subtle
but nevertheless offensive is the
paternalistically racist argument
that we Anglos are really using the
Indian's name in a way that is
good for them and will bring
honor to them and why don't
they understand our good
intentions? I hope that most of us
have lost enough of our racial
naivete to recognize this elitist
view for what it is, even though
some older Indian alumni and
friends of Stanford may not.
But regardless of these
arguments, if any racial minority
on campus unanimously requests
that the university not use their
name and symbolism in a manner
which that minority feels is
insensitive and degrading to them,
we should respect that request. If
we cannot accommodate the
Stanford Native American
Community in this petition, then
all other attempts at advising and
tutorial assistance will be hollow
indeed.

Williams "Authentic"
Editor, THE DAILY:
As a personal friend of Timm

Williams (better known as Prince
Lightfoot), I disagree with the
Daily's opinion concerning the use
of the "Indian" name in
connection with Stanford and
Timm's dancing at Stanford
football games.
Everyone knows why the
Indian name was chosen 40 years
ago—some of the ideal
characteristics of American
Indians are their honesty, courage
and perseverance. If being called
this is stereotyping, then it merely
gives the Indian people a legacy
which all of us might try to copy.
No one can be forced to live up to
an image if they do not so desire;
the Indian students on campus are
certainly free to accept or reject
any of these ideals if they so
desire.
Anyone who has had contact
with Timm Williams realizes that
he is hardly unreal, "inauthentic"
(to use the Daily's unfortunate
term) or stereotyped. Timm is the
leader of his own Yurok tribe in
Northern California as well as the
representative of over 50,000
American Indians in the U.S. It
was largely through Timm's
efforts that the National Indian
Health Board was founded and
operating today. Timm has been
elected the chairman of another
Indian Health group for three
years in succession, and the
people who elected him were
Indians—32 representatives of

and symbolism issue.
It seems that some years after
others appropriate the Indian
lands in the area, Stanford
appropriate the Indian name and
symbolism. It has been
subsequently used without the
consent of the Indians to
represent students who are not at
all Indians and in a manner
insensitive to the Indian culture.
The most obvious affront to
the native american community is
Prince Lightfoot's performance of
a religious ritual which is, to the
native americans and their elders a
sacred rite and no more
appropriate for the entertainment
of a sports crowd than would be
High Mass to a Roman Catholic.
Lightfoot's hexing the opposing
team is somewhat akin to having
Billy Graham calling down the
forces of hell onto the heads of
the visiting "sinners." More subtle
but nevertheless offensive is the
paternalistically racist argument
that we Anglos are really using the
Indian's name in a way that is
good for them and will bring
honor to them and why don't
they understand our good
intentions? I hope that most of us
have lost enough of our racial
naivete to recognize this elitist
view for what it is, even though
some older Indian alumni and
friends of Stanford may not.
But regardless of these
arguments, if any racial minority
on campus unanimously requests
that the university not use their
name and symbolism in a manner
which that minority feels is
insensitive and degrading to them,
we should respect that request. If
we cannot accommodate the
Stanford Native American
Community in this petition, then
all other attempts at advising and
tutorial assistance will be hollow
indeed.

Editor, THE DAILY:
As a personal friend of Timm

Williams (better known as Prince
Lightfoot), I disagree with the
Daily's opinion concerning the use
of the "Indian" name in
connection with Stanford and
Timm's dancing at Stanford
football games.
Everyone knows why the
Indian name was chosen 40 years
ago—some of the ideal
characteristics of American
Indians are their honesty, courage
and perseverance. If being called
this is stereotyping, then it merely
gives the Indian people a legacy
which all of us might try to copy.
No one can be forced to live up to
an image if they do not so desire;
the Indian students on campus are
certainly free to accept or reject
any of these ideals if they so
desire.
Anyone who has had contact
with Timm Williams realizes that
he is hardly unreal, "inauthentic"
(to use the Daily's unfortunate
term) or stereotyped. Timm is the
leader of his own Yurok tribe in
Northern California as well as the
representative of over 50,000
American Indians in the U.S. It
was largely through Timm's
efforts that the National Indian
Health Board was founded and
operating today. Timm has been
elected the chairman of another
Indian Health group for three
years in succession, and the
people who elected him were
Indians—32 representatives of
other Indian groups.
Timm has danced at Stanford
for over 20 years, and when
people here talk with him during
his stay on campus, they realize
that he lives up to the ideals that
he represents when he dances
here. Wherever Timm goes
throughout his travels in this
country, American Indians,
government officials and everyone
else he meets recognize him as a
representative of Stanford, and
Timm always takes care to live up
to this responsibility because he
wants to. Timm is proud to lend
his talent to an institution such as
Stanford, because he realizes that
the ideals of the University are his
ideals.
Timm is a real Indian and his
dances are real. It is part of his
personal legacy as a human being
and as a member and leader of the
Indian nation. Timm dances not
only to entertain but to show who
he is, and he feels no shame in it.
The Indian community should
show pride in having a
representative such as Timm in
the Stanford community. Timm is
proud of his heritage as are most

Indians, and the Indians who he
represents throughout the country
are proud of him.

White Liberal Rhetoric
Editor, THE DAILY:
We believe that Robert Larson's
article reinterpreted the issue of
the blatant and insensitive misuse
of the Indian as the Stanford
symbol as being another case of
white liberals seeking absolution
of their sins. His misinterpretation
of the issue once again gave the
Stanford Community another
example of the white liberal
rhetoric and selfishness that is
ever existent. It seems that he has
entwined himself in his rhetoric in
an attempt to take advantage of
the issue in order to express his
discontent with the University
Administration instead of stating
his reasons why the Stanford
Indian symbol must be saved from
the "masochistic miasma" that
seems to pervade the Stanford
Community.
Mr. Larson slights the
Community's "lack of sensitivity"
in regard to the Native Americans'
culture, religion, tradition and
self-respect. We believe that the
article has exemplified the lack of
human compassion and
understanding that is found in
certain strata of this campus.
Also, it was mentioned that the
dropping of the Indian as the
Stanford symbol would be the
rash destruction of a proud
tradition. We fail to recognize the
correlation between the Stanford
Indian and the "proud tradition"
of the University. <
Surely, the members of this
Community do not give this
tradition priority over the
cross-cultural respect due our
Native Americans: we believe that
the Stanford Indian tradition
cannot be considered intelligibly
equal with that of the Native
American, which has evolved over
hundreds of years. If Mr. Larson
believes that the Stanford Indian
evokes pride essential to the
tradition of this University, we
ask, is the price that we must pay
the degradation of our Native
Americans' heritage?
Mr. Larson commends the
Native Americans for their
"perceptive insight" into the
psychology of the University

What's In A Nickname?
Editor, THE DAILY:
I suggest that the only reason
for real Indians to get upset is if
there is a case for believing that
Stanford's athletic teams were
named after them as some sort of
joke, like "Hey gang, how's this
for cool. Let's call ourselves
Indians. Plenty wampum, plenty
squaws, plenty crazy when drink
firewater." Instead, it seems likely
that the name was chosen at a
time when the aim was to endow
one's teams with courage,
strength, and respect.
Stanford's Indians—the real
article, that is—should take a poll
to see if others feel that the name
and the image is thought to be
derisive. This is definitely a case
where their opinions shouldn't
count. What really counts is
whether the public thinks that Lo,
the Poor Indian is being ridiculed.
I believe that a poll would dispel
any such illusion.- And by the
way, part of my family came
from Oklahoma, which has had
Indian governors and such, and
one of my aunts and my
daughter-in-law (I'm getting along
in years, obviously) are part
Indian.
Maybe the Indians should look
around before they go on the
warpath. How about USC's
Trojans? Should the shades of
Priam and Hector and Paris return
from Hades to protest an untrojan

profile on SC'S posters? And how
about the UCLA Bruins?
UC Davis football and
basketball players have been
called the Aggies for over fifty
years. It's high time that the
California Farm Bureau
Federation objected to this
disgraceful satire of tillers of the
soil in this, our Nation's greatest
agricultural state. In fact, with no
trouble at all we might launch a
nation-wide movement to cease
and desist from disparagement of
Cornhuskers, Cowboys, Warriors,
and other minority groups, as well
as Beavers, Ducks, Huskies,
Cougars, Hawks, Broncos, Rams,
and other dignified members of
the animal kingdom.
When we get this mess cleaned

up, so that presumably no one's
feelings are hurt, we can employ
such virile and decisive names for
our muscle men as the Green
Wave, the Tide, or the Lakers,
except, of course, those are
already preempted. It is evident
that the task ahead for athletic
directors is a formidable one.

Editorial Misunderstands
Editor, THE DAILY:
As two white students living in
Loro, the Native American house,
we feel that the recent sports
editorial (Feb. 7) concerning the
continued use of the Indian as a
mascot displays a lack of
understanding of the issue. We are
in complete sympathy with those
in our house who have petitioned
that the symbol be abolished.
Having lived here for two
quarters, we can only see this
article as an attempt to assuage
white consciences by
intellectually rationalizing the use
of the mascot as if Stanford were
doing the Indian people a favor by
"advertising" their culture. A
people's culture and heritage
cannot be represented by another
people—least of all a football team
and athletic department.
It is sheer rhetoric to say that
"the symbol of the Indian can be
implemented so as to present the
true image of the Native American
that can be understood,
empathized with, and respected."
How can a football team at
Stanford University be compared
to the Native American people?
How can Stanford feel it has the
right to suggest such a
connection?
We believe that the mascot is
deeply insulting to the Native
American students here, that the
university community should try
to see it from their point of view
and that their demands should be
implemented.

In Agreement
Editor, THE DAILY:
We defend the use of the
American Indian as the symbol of
Stanford's athletic efforts, and
look upon this tradition as a great
honor to all Native Americans.
The Indian was chosen because of
his image as a brave warrior,
known for his physical prowess
and cunning. This image embodies
the ideals for which our athletes
strive.
Other schools also use a group
of people as their mascot
(Trojans? Vikings?). These were
chosen because of their strength
and vigor. It is true that
occasionally a Viking may be
depicted as a fat little man with
long moustace and beard (a la
Santa Claus).
Does this mean that those of
Scandinavian descent should be so
super-sensitive as to cause an
uproar over the use of this
symbol? Obviously, changes could
be made to eliminate any overt
ridicule or disrespect in regard to

the Indian. However, we agree
with the Daily sports staff in that
it would be an ill-considered
decision to abolish the Indian
altogether.

Editorial Misunderstands
Editor, THE DAILY:
As two white students living in
Loro, the Native American house,
we feel that the recent sports
editorial (Feb. 7) concerning the
continued use of the Indian as a
mascot displays a lack of
understanding of the issue. We are
in complete sympathy with those
in our house who have petitioned
that the symbol be abolished.
Having lived here for two
quarters, we can only see this
article as an attempt to assuage
white consciences by
intellectually rationalizing the use
of the mascot as if Stanford were
doing the Indian people a favor by
"advertising" their culture. A
people's culture and heritage
cannot be represented by another
people—least of all a football team
and athletic department.
It is sheer rhetoric to say that
"the symbol of the Indian can be
implemented so as to present the
true image of the Native American
that can be understood,
empathized with, and respected."
How can a football team at
Stanford University be compared
to the Native American people?
How can Stanford feel it has the
right to suggest such a
connection?
We believe that the mascot is
deeply insulting to the Native
American students here, that the
university community should try
to see it from their point of view
and that their demands should be
implemented.

We defend the use of the
American Indian as the symbol of
Stanford's athletic efforts, and
look upon this tradition as a great
honor to all Native Americans.
The Indian was chosen because of
his image as a brave warrior,
known for his physical prowess
and cunning. This image embodies
the ideals for which our athletes
strive.
Other schools also use a group
of people as their mascot
(Trojans? Vikings?). These were
chosen because of their strength
and vigor. It is true that
occasionally a Viking may be
depicted as a fat little man with
long moustace and beard (a la
Santa Claus).
Does this mean that those of
Scandinavian descent should be so
super-sensitive as to cause an
uproar over the use of this
symbol? Obviously, changes could
be made to eliminate any overt
ridicule or disrespect in regard to

the Indian. However, we agree
with the Daily sports staff in that
it would be an ill-considered
decision to abolish the Indian
altogether.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I am compelled to respond to
some recent comments appearing
in the Daily on the Indian mascot
and symbolism issue.
It seems that some years after
others appropriate the Indian
lands in the area, Stanford
appropriate the Indian name and
symbolism. It has been
subsequently used without the
consent of the Indians to
represent students who are not at
all Indians and in a manner
insensitive to the Indian culture.
The most obvious affront to
the native american community is
Prince Lightfoot's performance of
a religious ritual which is, to the
native americans and their elders a
sacred rite and no more
appropriate for the entertainment
of a sports crowd than would be
High Mass to a Roman Catholic.
Lightfoot's hexing the opposing
team is somewhat akin to having
Billy Graham calling down the
forces of hell onto the heads of
the visiting "sinners." More subtle
but nevertheless offensive is the
paternalistically racist argument
that we Anglos are really using the
Indian's name in a way that is
good for them and will bring
honor to them and why don't
they understand our good
intentions? I hope that most of us
have lost enough of our racial
naivete to recognize this elitist
view for what it is, even though
some older Indian alumni and
friends of Stanford may not.
But regardless of these
arguments, if any racial minority
on campus unanimously requests
that the university not use their
name and symbolism in a manner
which that minority feels is
insensitive and degrading to them,
we should respect that request. If
we cannot accommodate the
Stanford Native American
Community in this petition, then
all other attempts at advising and
tutorial assistance will be hollow
indeed.

Williams "Authentic"
Editor, THE DAILY:
As a personal friend of Timm

Williams (better known as Prince
Lightfoot), I disagree with the
Daily's opinion concerning the use
of the "Indian" name in
connection with Stanford and
Timm's dancing at Stanford
football games.
Everyone knows why the
Indian name was chosen 40 years
ago—some of the ideal
characteristics of American
Indians are their honesty, courage
and perseverance. If being called
this is stereotyping, then it merely
gives the Indian people a legacy
which all of us might try to copy.
No one can be forced to live up to
an image if they do not so desire;
the Indian students on campus are
certainly free to accept or reject
any of these ideals if they so
desire.
Anyone who has had contact
with Timm Williams realizes that
he is hardly unreal, "inauthentic"
(to use the Daily's unfortunate
term) or stereotyped. Timm is the
leader of his own Yurok tribe in
Northern California as well as the
representative of over 50,000
American Indians in the U.S. It
was largely through Timm's
efforts that the National Indian
Health Board was founded and
operating today. Timm has been
elected the chairman of another
Indian Health group for three
years in succession, and the
people who elected him were
Indians—32 representatives of
other Indian groups.
Timm has danced at Stanford
for over 20 years, and when
people here talk with him during
his stay on campus, they realize
that he lives up to the ideals that
he represents when he dances
here. Wherever Timm goes
throughout his travels in this
country, American Indians,
government officials and everyone
else he meets recognize him as a
representative of Stanford, and
Timm always takes care to live up
to this responsibility because he
wants to. Timm is proud to lend
his talent to an institution such as
Stanford, because he realizes that
the ideals of the University are his
ideals.
Timm is a real Indian and his
dances are real. It is part of his
personal legacy as a human being
and as a member and leader of the
Indian nation. Timm dances not
only to entertain but to show who
he is, and he feels no shame in it.
The Indian community should
show pride in having a
representative such as Timm in
the Stanford community. Timm is
proud of his heritage as are most

Indians, and the Indians who he
represents throughout the country
are proud of him.

White Liberal Rhetoric
Editor, THE DAILY:
We believe that Robert Larson's
article reinterpreted the issue of
the blatant and insensitive misuse
of the Indian as the Stanford
symbol as being another case of
white liberals seeking absolution
of their sins. His misinterpretation
of the issue once again gave the
Stanford Community another
example of the white liberal
rhetoric and selfishness that is
ever existent. It seems that he has
entwined himself in his rhetoric in
an attempt to take advantage of
the issue in order to express his
discontent with the University
Administration instead of stating
his reasons why the Stanford
Indian symbol must be saved from
the "masochistic miasma" that
seems to pervade the Stanford
Community.
Mr. Larson slights the
Community's "lack of sensitivity"
in regard to the Native Americans'
culture, religion, tradition and
self-respect. We believe that the
article has exemplified the lack of
human compassion and
understanding that is found in
certain strata of this campus.
Also, it was mentioned that the
dropping of the Indian as the
Stanford symbol would be the
rash destruction of a proud
tradition. We fail to recognize the
correlation between the Stanford
Indian and the "proud tradition"
of the University. <
Surely, the members of this
Community do not give this
tradition priority over the
cross-cultural respect due our
Native Americans: we believe that
the Stanford Indian tradition
cannot be considered intelligibly
equal with that of the Native
American, which has evolved over
hundreds of years. If Mr. Larson
believes that the Stanford Indian
evokes pride essential to the
tradition of this University, we
ask, is the price that we must pay
the degradation of our Native
Americans' heritage?
Mr. Larson commends the
Native Americans for their
"perceptive insight" into the
psychology of the University
Administration. We wish to
expose his article as another

opportunistic attack on the
University Administration at the
expense of an issue important to
the Native Americans of this
nation.

What's In A Nickname?
Editor, THE DAILY:
I suggest that the only reason
for real Indians to get upset is if
there is a case for believing that
Stanford's athletic teams were
named after them as some sort of
joke, like "Hey gang, how's this
for cool. Let's call ourselves
Indians. Plenty wampum, plenty
squaws, plenty crazy when drink
firewater." Instead, it seems likely
that the name was chosen at a
time when the aim was to endow
one's teams with courage,
strength, and respect.
Stanford's Indians—the real
article, that is—should take a poll
to see if others feel that the name
and the image is thought to be
derisive. This is definitely a case
where their opinions shouldn't
count. What really counts is
whether the public thinks that Lo,
the Poor Indian is being ridiculed.
I believe that a poll would dispel
any such illusion.- And by the
way, part of my family came
from Oklahoma, which has had
Indian governors and such, and
one of my aunts and my
daughter-in-law (I'm getting along
in years, obviously) are part
Indian.
Maybe the Indians should look
around before they go on the
warpath. How about USC's
Trojans? Should the shades of
Priam and Hector and Paris return
from Hades to protest an untrojan

profile on SC'S posters? And how
about the UCLA Bruins?
UC Davis football and
basketball players have been
called the Aggies for over fifty
years. It's high time that the
California Farm Bureau
Federation objected to this
disgraceful satire of tillers of the
soil in this, our Nation's greatest
agricultural state. In fact, with no
trouble at all we might launch a
nation-wide movement to cease
and desist from disparagement of
Cornhuskers, Cowboys, Warriors,
and other minority groups, as well
as Beavers, Ducks, Huskies,
Cougars, Hawks, Broncos, Rams,
and other dignified members of
the animal kingdom.
When we get this mess cleaned

up, so that presumably no one's
feelings are hurt, we can employ
such virile and decisive names for
our muscle men as the Green
Wave, the Tide, or the Lakers,
except, of course, those are
already preempted. It is evident
that the task ahead for athletic
directors is a formidable one.
