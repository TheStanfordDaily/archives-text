# Fasters Press Lyman To Accept Demands
## 
### 
For the past two days, 43 people
have been living on water and orange
juice to focus attention on the need
for an immediate moratorium on
recruiting, and judicial hearings. If our
demands are met, it begins the process
of resolving some of the conflicts
which have plagued the campus over
the last few months," Dave Josephson,
ASSU professor of Social Thought and
a member of the fasting group said
today.
The fasters will send ten people to
President Lyman's office at 9 a.m.
today to demand the moratorium of
the use of the Placement Center by
military recruiters and by corporations
either producing anti-personnel
weapons or holding over $100 million
dollars in military contracts, and a
moratorium on judicial hearings,
including the current one, at which
four students are being tried for

disruption of a placement interview,
"until a legitimate judicial system can
be established."
They will also demand that Lyman
hold an open meeting.
"Fasting is always the last
alternative people can use, after all
other channels have been exhausted.
It's the most serious thing people can
do with their own lives. But it's
necessary because the administration
has to realize that there are serious
people who want this conflict resolved
reasonably and are willing to make
sacrifices to put the community in
that mood," Josephson said.
Those fasting indicated they will
continue their fast until the demands
are met, however others indicated
their intention to support the fasters
by joining them for 24 hours, starting
Monday noon at a rally in White Plaza.
