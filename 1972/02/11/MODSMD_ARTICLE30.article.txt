# Shoving, Too
## CSEA Meeting Turns Into Shouting Match 
### GLENN GARVIN 
A California Schools Employee
Association-Stanford Employee
Association rally last night turned into
a shouting match between the
CSEA-SEA and two other
organizations that will compete in the
March 7 unionization election for
University workers.
About 35 workers attended the
hour-and-a-half meeting last night in
the Art Auditorium, listening to a
series of vocal battles that raged on
throughout the entire rally. Feelings
ran high, and after the meeting broke
up CSEA-SEA Junior Past President
Mike Fineo had a brief shoving match
with Steve Cardoza of the Teamster
Stanford Organizing Committee
(TSOC).
The Teamsters and United Stanford
Employees (USE) will both be on the
ballot with CSEA-SEA when
University workers choose a union to
represent them March 7.
The meeting went very peacefully
for the first half hour last night, but
several members of the TSOC and two
or three USE workers began asking
antagonistic questions, and things
went up in smo^,^
The atmosphere was so bitter that
at one point CSEA-SEA Vice President
Forrest Futtere stopped the meeting
and told Rudy Tham, a Teamster
organizer, "Conduct yourself as an
adult."

The heated discussion carried over
into the halls of the Cummings
Building after the meeting was over,
where several more arguments broke
out and Cardoza and Fineo shoved
each other momentarily.
Most of the war of words concerned
the CSEA-SEA attitude towards
strikes, and a proposed debate
between representatives of the three
unions.
CSEA-SEA in the past has boasted
that not once in the 40-year history of
the union has it gone on strike. When
several Teamsters claimed that meant
that CSEA-SEA had no Dower,
organizer Bill Young said, "We have no
policy against strikes... . It's just that
in the past our employees have never

felt the need."
No Molotov Cocktails
Sam Holmes, general counsel to
CSEA-SEA, added: "If it comes to
that, we won't throw molotov
cocktails, we won't bomb any
buildings, we won't cause any
riots . .. but we can strike."
He got a healthy round of applause
from everyone but the Teamsters and
USE.
Tham asked Young: "Would you
ask Teamsters to cooperate in a strike,
to refuse to cross picket lines?"
"Let me turn that question
around," Young shot back. "Would
Teamsters drive across our lines?
Would you order that?"
Both the Teamsters and USE

challenged the CSEA-SEA to a debate,
but Holmes said, "I see no point in
that discussion." Young called debates
"a stacked deck" and said, "I only
play with a stacked deck when I stack
it."
When Julia Harvey of USE
continued to assert—in a rather loud
voice—tnt she wanted a platform to
debate on, Young answered "I'm sure
you do." He turned up the volume on
his microphone as loud as it would go
and added: "BUT YOU WONT GET
THIS ONE!"
Harvey and Tham said later that
they would continue to press the issue
of an open debate between the three
unions. "Any terms," Tham declared
flatly. "We want a debate."
