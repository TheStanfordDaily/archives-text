# Johnson's Arrest Denied
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Santa Cruz County Sheriff Douglas
James is "still looking for" James
Edward Johnson, a onetime Stanford
radical being sought for allegedly
operating a "bomb factory" in the
Santa Cruz Mountains.
Fingerprints and physical
descriptions yesterday revealed that
the Los Angeles Sheriff's Office was
mistaken in thinking it had captured
the fugitive radical, who has been
sought by federal, state, and local
authorities for a year.

A spokesman for the LA sheriff told
the Daily, "There was a man by that
name arrested around the sixth for
burglary."
Sheriff James said he received a
teletype message from Los Angeles
Wednesday, indicating the fugitive
Johnson had been captured. But he
explained that a fingerprint check
through state authorities revealed
"that the one LA has is not the one we
wanted.
"The one LA has is six-foot-one
instead of five-foot-eleven," the Santa
Cruz sheriff added.
Early editions of yesterday's San
Francisco Examiner carried the
erroneous report that authorities had
arrested the fugitive Johnson, who is a
former Stanford engineering student.
Johnson was a quick-tempered
activist in the early years of Stanford's
radical movement. He was active in the
Students for a Democratic Society and
the Black Students Union.
Johnson was fined $100 by the
Stanford Judicial Council for
participating in a disruption of a
trustees' meeting at the Faculty Club
in February, 1969.
In fall of 1970, Johnson went
"underground" while facing trials on a
variety of felony and misdemeanor
charges in Santa Clara, San Mateo, and
San Francisco Counties.
Police charge that Johnson went to
an isolated mountain cabin and began
making sophisticated explosives which
were used by revolutionaries

throughout the Bay Area.
The charges are based on testimony
by Thomas Edward Mosher, a former
Stanford radical who turned out to be
an informer for the FBI and state and
local police agencies.
Mosher, who was reportedly
considered a close friend of Johnson,
testified before a Senate committee
last spring. Mosher revealed that he
had been an undercover agent in the
Stanford area since 1969.
Mosher testified that he led FBI
agents to the Santa Cruz cabin, where
Johnson allegedly stayed for months.
Mosher charged that Johnson
assembled explosives used to damage
the Palo Alto branch of the Bank of
America, as well as a Oomb which was
discovered unexploded at the Oakland
Police Department. Published reports
also indicate that Mosher, who is now
in hiding, linked Johnson to a bomb
which damaged the Marin County
Civic Center in 1970.
Johnson witnessed the murder of an
out-of-favor Black Panther near the
Santa Cruz Cabin, Mosher charged.
The informer also said he thought
Johnson was responsible for the April,
1970 arson at Stanford's Behavioral
Sciences center.
Local radicals confirm that Mosher
was involved in the radical movement
here and that Mosher and Johnson
were friends. But they charge that
Mosher was mentally unbalanced and
often "exaggerated" how much he
knew about radical activities.
