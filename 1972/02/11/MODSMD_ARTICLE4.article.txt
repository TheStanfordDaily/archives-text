# Prosecution Closes Case, CJP Hearing Nears End
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
Special Assistant to the President
John Schwartz, University prosecutor
in the Campus Judicial Panel case
against the so-called "Placement
Center 4" — defendants Don Lee, Paul
Loeb, Pete Knutson, and Steve
Downey — concluded his case
yesterday, and the defense presented
first three witnesses.
Closed hearings in the case
reconvene today at 9:00 a.m. in Room
83 of the Graduate School of Business,
where the defense plans to question its
final three witnesses and complete its
case.
Lillian Altree, a University of Santa
Clara law professor serving as Hearing
Officer in the case, will then prepare a
report "determining the facts relevant
to the charge and . .. (make) a
preliminary recommendation as to
whether or not those facts constitute a
violation of a University regulation as
charged."
She said she feared future
disruptions and feared for her personal
safety in an open hearing. She also
denied that she had decided to resign
as a Hearing Officer after the
Placement case is completed.
After the prosecution presented its
four witnesses yesterday, members of
the 11-man defense team presented
two motions to Altree which
apparenlty startled Schwartz.
The first, by defense counselor
Stephanie Wildman, asks Altree to
"take judicial notice of the fact that to

use the facilities of the Placement
Center a student must be registered
and possess a valid student body card
at the time of his interview." She
argued that, though Linsenbardt
testified that he had registered at the
beginning of the quarter, this did not
prove that he was still enrolled as a
student on November 4.
The second defense motion, by
defendant Don Lee, asks Altree to
recognize that Placement Center
interviews with defense industries are
not a "legitimate function" of the
University, and for this reason cannot
be punished under the disruption
policy, which punishes students who
"prevent or disrupt the effective
carrying out of a University function
or approved activity."
According to international law and
the Nuremberg principles, the defense
argued, placement interviews with the
armed forces or defense oriented
companies are illegitimate, and hence
cannot be puqished under the policy.
The prosecution yesterday
presented Roger Burnell, a TRW
recruiter who had attempted to
interview Linsenbardt; Terry
McNelley, a graduate student who had
scheduled an interview with a General
Motors recruiter on November 4, and
alleges that it was disrupted by Lee;
Stanford police chief Marvin
Herrington; and Frances Holtslander,
supervisor of recruitment activities at
the Placement Center.

Burnell identified defendants
Downey and Knutson as two of those
who disrupted his interview with
Linsenbardt. On cross-examination, he
stated that Stanford had offered to
reimburse him for expenses incurred in
his trip from Los Angeles to testify at
the hearings.
Burnell resisted attempts to
question his credibility or discover bias
in his attitude, despite several defense
efforts, especially on the bias issue.
The defense again probed
extensively for bias in Herrington's
performance as police chief and in his
testimony during the hearing.
McNelley testified that his
interview with a GM representative
was disrupted by Don Lee who, unlike
the other defendants, is charged with
two separate violations of the
disruption policy.
During the defense questioning,
Schwartz exploded into an angry
tirade against defense questioning
techniques, yelling that the defense
counsel's "line of questioning would
not be permitted in any court of law
and should not be permitted here."
The defense presented ASSU
co-president Doug McHenry, who
testified about the 1971 student
referendum against military and
defense industry recruiting; Leonard
Scheine, a law student who testified
about Lee's part in the demonstration;
and David Josephson, who described
the circumstances of the referendum
and November demonstrations.

prove that he was still enrolled as a
student on November 4.
The second defense motion, by
defendant Don Lee, asks Altree to
recognize that Placement Center
interviews with defense industries are
not a "legitimate function" of the
University, and for this reason cannot
be punished under the disruption
policy, which punishes students who
"prevent or disrupt the effective
carrying out of a University function
or approved activity."
According to international law and
the Nuremberg principles, the defense
argued, placement interviews with the
armed forces or defense oriented
companies are illegitimate, and hence
cannot be puqished under the policy.
The prosecution yesterday
presented Roger Burnell, a TRW
recruiter who had attempted to
interview Linsenbardt; Terry
McNelley, a graduate student who had
scheduled an interview with a General
Motors recruiter on November 4, and
alleges that it was disrupted by Lee;
Stanford police chief Marvin
Herrington; and Frances Holtslander,
supervisor of recruitment activities at
the Placement Center.

Burnell identified defendants
Downey and Knutson as two of those
who disrupted his interview with
Linsenbardt. On cross-examination, he
stated that Stanford had offered to
reimburse him for expenses incurred in
his trip from Los Angeles to testify at
the hearings.
Burnell resisted attempts to
question his credibility or discover bias
in his attitude, despite several defense
efforts, especially on the bias issue.
The defense again probed
extensively for bias in Herrington's
performance as police chief and in his
testimony during the hearing.
McNelley testified that his
interview with a GM representative
was disrupted by Don Lee who, unlike
the other defendants, is charged with
two separate violations of the
disruption policy.
During the defense questioning,
Schwartz exploded into an angry
tirade against defense questioning
techniques, yelling that the defense
counsel's "line of questioning would
not be permitted in any court of law
and should not be permitted here."
The defense presented ASSU
co-president Doug McHenry, who
testified about the 1971 student
referendum against military and
defense industry recruiting; Leonard
Scheine, a law student who testified
about Lee's part in the demonstration;
and David Josephson, who described
the circumstances of the referendum
and November demonstrations.
Special Assistant to the President
John Schwartz, University prosecutor
in the Campus Judicial Panel case
against the so-called "Placement
Center 4" — defendants Don Lee, Paul
Loeb, Pete Knutson, and Steve
Downey — concluded his case
yesterday, and the defense presented
first three witnesses.
Closed hearings in the case
reconvene today at 9:00 a.m. in Room
83 of the Graduate School of Business,
where the defense plans to question its
final three witnesses and complete its
case.
Lillian Altree, a University of Santa
Clara law professor serving as Hearing
Officer in the case, will then prepare a
report "determining the facts relevant
to the charge and . .. (make) a
preliminary recommendation as to
whether or not those facts constitute a
violation of a University regulation as
charged."
She said she feared future
disruptions and feared for her personal
safety in an open hearing. She also
denied that she had decided to resign
as a Hearing Officer after the
Placement case is completed.
After the prosecution presented its
four witnesses yesterday, members of
the 11-man defense team presented
two motions to Altree which
apparenlty startled Schwartz.
The first, by defense counselor
Stephanie Wildman, asks Altree to
"take judicial notice of the fact that to

use the facilities of the Placement
Center a student must be registered
and possess a valid student body card
at the time of his interview." She
argued that, though Linsenbardt
testified that he had registered at the
beginning of the quarter, this did not
prove that he was still enrolled as a
student on November 4.
