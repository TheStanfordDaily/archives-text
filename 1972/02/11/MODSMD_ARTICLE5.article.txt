# Socialist Candidate Outlines Goals
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
Linda Jenness, the Socialist
Workers Party presidential candidate
and former candidate for Mayor of
Atlanta and Governor of Georgia,
criticized the U.S. Government
yesterday for "playing a reactionary
role all around the world."
Jenness spoke to a predominanttly
female audience of about 50 people in
the Women's Clubhouse.
She acknowledged that her chances
of winning the election are
non-existent, but stressed the fact that*
her campaign would be instrumental in
unifying various movements whose
members "no longer believe the lies of
the United States Government."
Her campaign, unlike that of
Democratic hopeful Shirley Chisholm,
is not designed to get people "out of
the streets" and into the establishment
political system, she said. A vote for
either the Democrats or the
Republicans could not be a progressive
vote because both are capitalistic
parties that support the status quo, she
argued.
Jenness is 31 years old (which
makes her constitutionally ineligible
for the presidency), and has spent
most of her life in Georgia.
She was the Young Social Alliance
(YSA) representative at the 100 th
anniversary celebration of the Puerto
Rican Independence movement in
1968, and sppnt five weeks in Cuba as
part of a YSA delegation invited to the
Cuban government's tenth anniversary
of the Cuban revolution.
In 1969 she was the Socialist
Workers Party candidate for Mayor of
Atlanta, and in 1970 she ran against

Lester Maddox for Governor of
Georgia. In both elections she failed to
get her name on the ballot.
Jenness said the U.S. Government
employs two basic tactics in order to
insure its rule: repression and
deception. Yet she believes that
government authority is being
challenged today, and that the force of
people's movements is growing.
Jenness credited the student
movement as the faction that forced
President Nixon to withdraw troops
from Cambodia last spring.
She also praised the Women's
Liberation movement for waking up
and challenging the idea that women
are inferior to men. Jenness stressed
that she is a feminist candidate, and
supports the demand for the
constitutional right of all women to
have abortions.
Jenness also lent support to the
Black Nationalist, Chicano, and Gay
Liberation movements.
Jenness also emphasized the fact
that she considers the Vietnam War
still to be a major issue. She accused
Nixon of trying to deceive the
American public into believing that
the War is winding down, when in
reality he is merely "substituting
bombs for troops." She pointed out
the fact that the heaviest bombings of
the war have been carried out in the
last two months.
She urged students to show up for
anti-war demonstrations scheduled for
April 22, "even though you may be
tired of marching."
When questioned as to her solution
for ending the war she replied that she
would send every plane and every ship

to Vietnam and "put the men on and
bring them home." She claimed it
could be done in one week.
POWs would be returned shortly
afterward, she says, because there
would be no logical reason for the
North Vietnamese to keep them if
American troops were no longer in
Asia.
Jenness also advocated an end to all
military aid, and the withdrawal of all
American troops from all foreign
countries. She criticized Senator
McGovern for voting in favor of the
bill to sell Phantom jets to Israel.
She believes that nationalization of
major industries is another major goal,
because national planning is the only
logical way to regulate the economy.
She estimated her campaign budget
at half a million dollars. Her name is

scheduled to be on the ballot in at
least 19 states, and several suits are
being waged to declare election
restrictions that prevent her from
getting on the ballot unconstitutional.
One of the states whose election laws
she is contesting is California.
She expects to draw support
especially from young women and
students, but intends to concentrate
on other factions as well. She
cautioned the 25 million newly
enfranchised voters not to be co-opted
into voting Democratic, as the black,
Chicano and labor movements have
done so often in the past.
Jenness also attacked Nixon's wage
and price control economy plan, and
accused him of trying to win an
unsatisfactory "Korean-type
settlement" in Vietnam, from the
Chinese.

challenged today, and that the force of
people's movements is growing.
Jenness credited the student
movement as the faction that forced
President Nixon to withdraw troops
from Cambodia last spring.
She also praised the Women's
Liberation movement for waking up
and challenging the idea that women
are inferior to men. Jenness stressed
that she is a feminist candidate, and
supports the demand for the
constitutional right of all women to
have abortions.
Jenness also lent support to the
Black Nationalist, Chicano, and Gay
Liberation movements.
Jenness also emphasized the fact
that she considers the Vietnam War
still to be a major issue. She accused
Nixon of trying to deceive the
American public into believing that
the War is winding down, when in
reality he is merely "substituting
bombs for troops." She pointed out
the fact that the heaviest bombings of
the war have been carried out in the
last two months.
She urged students to show up for
anti-war demonstrations scheduled for
April 22, "even though you may be
tired of marching."
When questioned as to her solution
for ending the war she replied that she
would send every plane and every ship

to Vietnam and "put the men on and
bring them home." She claimed it
could be done in one week.
POWs would be returned shortly
afterward, she says, because there
would be no logical reason for the
North Vietnamese to keep them if
American troops were no longer in
Asia.
Jenness also advocated an end to all
military aid, and the withdrawal of all
American troops from all foreign
countries. She criticized Senator
McGovern for voting in favor of the
bill to sell Phantom jets to Israel.
She believes that nationalization of
major industries is another major goal,
because national planning is the only
logical way to regulate the economy.
She estimated her campaign budget
at half a million dollars. Her name is

scheduled to be on the ballot in at
least 19 states, and several suits are
being waged to declare election
restrictions that prevent her from
getting on the ballot unconstitutional.
One of the states whose election laws
she is contesting is California.
She expects to draw support
especially from young women and
students, but intends to concentrate
on other factions as well. She
cautioned the 25 million newly
enfranchised voters not to be co-opted
into voting Democratic, as the black,
Chicano and labor movements have
done so often in the past.
Jenness also attacked Nixon's wage
and price control economy plan, and
accused him of trying to win an
unsatisfactory "Korean-type
settlement" in Vietnam, from the
Chinese.
Linda Jenness, the Socialist
Workers Party presidential candidate
and former candidate for Mayor of
Atlanta and Governor of Georgia,
criticized the U.S. Government
yesterday for "playing a reactionary
role all around the world."
Jenness spoke to a predominanttly
female audience of about 50 people in
the Women's Clubhouse.
She acknowledged that her chances
of winning the election are
non-existent, but stressed the fact that*
her campaign would be instrumental in
unifying various movements whose
members "no longer believe the lies of
the United States Government."
Her campaign, unlike that of
Democratic hopeful Shirley Chisholm,
is not designed to get people "out of
the streets" and into the establishment
political system, she said. A vote for
either the Democrats or the
Republicans could not be a progressive
vote because both are capitalistic
parties that support the status quo, she
argued.
Jenness is 31 years old (which
makes her constitutionally ineligible
for the presidency), and has spent
most of her life in Georgia.
She was the Young Social Alliance
(YSA) representative at the 100 th
anniversary celebration of the Puerto
Rican Independence movement in
1968, and sppnt five weeks in Cuba as
part of a YSA delegation invited to the
Cuban government's tenth anniversary
of the Cuban revolution.
In 1969 she was the Socialist
Workers Party candidate for Mayor of
Atlanta, and in 1970 she ran against

Lester Maddox for Governor of
Georgia. In both elections she failed to
get her name on the ballot.
Jenness said the U.S. Government
employs two basic tactics in order to
insure its rule: repression and
deception. Yet she believes that
government authority is being
challenged today, and that the force of
people's movements is growing.
