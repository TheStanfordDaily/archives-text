# Mascot Referendum Postponed By Senate
## 
### 
After extended debate, the Student
Senate last night postponed action on
the future of the Indian mascot until it
had been informed of the University
administration's plans on the issue.
A suggestion from ASSU F'resident
Doug Mcllenry for the Senate to reject
the Indian symbol and call for a
student referendum to choose a new
one was delayed for consideration at
the next Senate meeting.
McHenrv had asked for immediate

Senate action, pointing out that it was
a legislative body similar to the ASSU
Executive Committee, which chose the
Indian as Stanford's mascot in the first
place.
Several senators objected to the
idea of immediate action on two basic
grounds: one of tradition, since the
mascot has existed for almost forty
years; the other of the student body's
right to participate in this decision.
