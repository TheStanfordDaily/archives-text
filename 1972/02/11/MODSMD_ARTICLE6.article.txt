# Mascot Referendum Postponed By Senate
## 
### 
After extended debate, the Student
Senate last night postponed action on
the future of the Indian mascot until it
had been informed of the University
administration's plans on the issue.
A suggestion from ASSU F'resident
Doug Mcllenry for the Senate to reject
the Indian symbol and call for a
student referendum to choose a new
one was delayed for consideration at
the next Senate meeting.
McHenrv had asked for immediate

Senate action, pointing out that it was
a legislative body similar to the ASSU
Executive Committee, which chose the
Indian as Stanford's mascot in the first
place.
Several senators objected to the
idea of immediate action on two basic
grounds: one of tradition, since the
mascot has existed for almost forty
years; the other of the student body's
right to participate in this decision.
John Bradley suggested a student
plebiscite to decide whether or not the
Indian symbol should be an option in
the choice of a new mascot.
McHenry replied that, in his
opinion, most white students at
Stanford were ignorant of what
institutional racism was all about.
"This could be a problem of a
democratic system squashing the rights
of a minority," he said. "It would be a
tragedy if this student body voted for
a symbol which has been rejected as
racist by the Native American
students."
Fifty-five Native American students
have petitioned the University to
abolish the Indian as a symbol,
charging that it is demeaning.

However, the motion that "the
Student Senate supports the Native
American students in their struggle to
remove the Indian as the symbol of
the Stanford Athletic Department,"
was postponed by a 13-10 vote for
consideration at next week's meeting.
The motion for a student
referendum was also postponed, to
give the Senate time to discuss the
issue with members of the University
administration.
In other action, the Senate
approved a 'Conference on University
Governance,' which is to take place on
April 8. Student representatives from
each dormitory and living group on
campus will attend this conference to
produce specific ideas on improving
student life on campus. These

suggestions will be consolidated and
returned to the Student Senate, which
will suggest action on them to the
University administration.
No action was taken on a resolution
proposed by Buck Shott guaranteeing
access to any open Senate meeting for
any member of the press. The
resolution was triggered by Senate
Chairman James Jefferson's ouster of
an Arena photographer in last week's
meeting, in compliance with the
wishes of several senators. A small
group of senators stated that they had
a right not to be photographed on the
Senate floor. For the second time,
these senators blocked action on the
resolution by leaving the meeting. The
Senate then adjourned for lack of a
quorum.
