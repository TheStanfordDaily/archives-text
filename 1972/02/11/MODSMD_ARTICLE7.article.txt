## Daily Misinterprets Proceedings 
### 
I was deeply concerned by your
editorial of this past Tuesday.
Your statement "Perhaps the
most odious aspects of the
weekend's hearings were that the
defendants were tried in absentia
on Saturday" was a very serious
charge, and although my duties as
spelled out by the rules are fairly
restricted at this point, I do
consider myself charged with at
least some responsibility for the
overall fairness of the procedures.
As far as I can tell, the Daily
was under the impression (as
indicated in its story on the CJP
Disruption hearing Monday) that
when two of the defendants did
not appear because they had not
been properly served, the
prosecution case went on against
them anyway. If this were true,
every word the Daily had said
about it would be justified. In
fact, the tape indicates
conclusively (as has been
confirmed by the hearing officer
herself) that this flatly did not
happen. It was understood by
everyone, so far as I can tell, that
the hearing was proceeding only
against the two defendants who
had been properly served and did
appear.
Apparently, the Daily reporter
had not understood this and was
misled by the fact that the two
absent defendants were referred

to on a number of occasions as
part of more general descriptions
of who did what—with of course
the understanding on all sides that
any evidence against them as
defendants would have to be
presented on another occasion.
This whole matter was
somewhat muddled by the fact
that the two defendants who had
been properly served and did
appear, walked out on the hearing.
My impression, however, is that
the Daily did not complain they
were tried in absentia. Indeed,
barring any method of physical
restraint (a la Bobby Seale) it
would be strange to hold that a
defendant could prevent any part
of his trial simply by leaving the
room.
In short, so far as I can
determine, the Daily reporter
simply did not understand what
was happening, the Daily did not
bother to check with either me,
the hearing officer, or the counsel
for the defendants or the
prosecution, all of whom could
have quite simply enlightened the
editorial writer as to what had
taken place.
All of the above is even more
baffling when it is combined with
the Daily's complaints about
severance of defendants. It is
difficult for me to see how one
can complain about severing

defendants who did not appear,
and at the same time complain
that they were in fact not severed
but tried in absentia. The concept
of severance is a fairly interesting
one. Certainly I have never had
any intimation at this point that
defendants (in any forum) have a
right to consolidation of their
trials. Indeed, in civil courts,
almost overwhelmingly it is the
defendants who are protesting
against consolidation and asking
for severance and the prosecution
which is objecting to this.
As far as I am concerned, I sent
the four cases for trial together
because it seemed more
convenient to me at the time since
there would be duplications of
evidence and I did not think that
four was too large a number for
the hearing officer to handle. I

John kaplan

regarded this as a purely
housekeeping matter and certainly
did not expect that it would lead
to a campus issue.
I realize that these problems in
reporting and editoralizing do
tend to occur because legal
proceedings can be fairly
complicated. Perhaps the Daily
would consider getting a number
of law students who at least are
somewhat more familiar with legal
proceedings to advise on the legal
aspects of any of the cases.
It might be that under these
conditions the Daily could
perform a great service in
correctly informing the
community concerning the
operations of the Campus Judicial
Panel.

everyone, so far as I can tell, that
the hearing was proceeding only
against the two defendants who
had been properly served and did
appear.
Apparently, the Daily reporter
had not understood this and was
misled by the fact that the two
absent defendants were referred

to on a number of occasions as
part of more general descriptions
of who did what—with of course
the understanding on all sides that
any evidence against them as
defendants would have to be
presented on another occasion.
This whole matter was
somewhat muddled by the fact
that the two defendants who had
been properly served and did
appear, walked out on the hearing.
My impression, however, is that
the Daily did not complain they
were tried in absentia. Indeed,
barring any method of physical
restraint (a la Bobby Seale) it
would be strange to hold that a
defendant could prevent any part
of his trial simply by leaving the
room.
In short, so far as I can
determine, the Daily reporter
simply did not understand what
was happening, the Daily did not
bother to check with either me,
the hearing officer, or the counsel
for the defendants or the
prosecution, all of whom could
have quite simply enlightened the
editorial writer as to what had
taken place.
All of the above is even more
baffling when it is combined with
the Daily's complaints about
severance of defendants. It is
difficult for me to see how one
can complain about severing

defendants who did not appear,
and at the same time complain
that they were in fact not severed
but tried in absentia. The concept
of severance is a fairly interesting
one. Certainly I have never had
any intimation at this point that
defendants (in any forum) have a
right to consolidation of their
trials. Indeed, in civil courts,
almost overwhelmingly it is the
defendants who are protesting
against consolidation and asking
for severance and the prosecution
which is objecting to this.
As far as I am concerned, I sent
the four cases for trial together
because it seemed more
convenient to me at the time since
there would be duplications of
evidence and I did not think that
four was too large a number for
the hearing officer to handle. I

John kaplan

regarded this as a purely
housekeeping matter and certainly
did not expect that it would lead
to a campus issue.
I realize that these problems in
reporting and editoralizing do
tend to occur because legal
proceedings can be fairly
complicated. Perhaps the Daily
would consider getting a number
of law students who at least are
somewhat more familiar with legal
proceedings to advise on the legal
aspects of any of the cases.
It might be that under these
conditions the Daily could
perform a great service in
correctly informing the
community concerning the
operations of the Campus Judicial
Panel.

"We presented this latest Viet Nam peace proposal to the Democratic presidential candidates one week
ago—only to have it rejected!"
I was deeply concerned by your
editorial of this past Tuesday.
Your statement "Perhaps the
most odious aspects of the
weekend's hearings were that the
defendants were tried in absentia
on Saturday" was a very serious
charge, and although my duties as
spelled out by the rules are fairly
restricted at this point, I do
consider myself charged with at
least some responsibility for the
overall fairness of the procedures.
As far as I can tell, the Daily
was under the impression (as
indicated in its story on the CJP
Disruption hearing Monday) that
when two of the defendants did
not appear because they had not
been properly served, the
prosecution case went on against
them anyway. If this were true,
every word the Daily had said
about it would be justified. In
fact, the tape indicates
conclusively (as has been
confirmed by the hearing officer
herself) that this flatly did not
happen. It was understood by
everyone, so far as I can tell, that
the hearing was proceeding only
against the two defendants who
had been properly served and did
appear.
