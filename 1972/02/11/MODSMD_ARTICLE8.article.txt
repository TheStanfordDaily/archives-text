I find it impossible to believe
that your editorial "System
Stacked" (Daily 2/8/72) is based
on any reasonable understanding
of what has taken place during the
hearings to which you refer.
To begin with, the hearing
scheduled for Friday, February
4th was adjourned in the morning
when none of the defendants
appeared. At about noon on
Friday Professor Kaplan,
Chairman of the Campus Judicial
Panel, had notices hand delivered
to the mailing address of all four
defendants and their counsel
notifying them that he had
scheduled the hearing for the
following morning. In a
further attempt to notify them, he
requested the campus police to
deliver a copy of the notice to
each defendant personally. The
campus police did deliver this
copy to Mr. Lee and Mr. Loeb but
were unable to locate Mr. Downey
and Mr. Knutson.
On Saturday two defendants,
Mr. Lee and Mr. Loeb, did appear
and two, Mr. Knutson and Mr.
Downey, did not appear. No
proceedings were conducted with
regard to the latter two
defendants, and it was
acknowledged that as to them
(i.e., as to any defendants who do
not appear) another hearing
would have to be scheduled by
Professor Kaplan, and notices
again mailed etc.
In contrast, since Mr. Lee and
Mr. Loeb did appear on Saturday,
the hearing on the charges against
them was begun. These two
defendants made several motions,
and when these motions were
denied, they and their counsel

John j schwartz

walked out of the hearing. This
hearing (on the charges against the
two defendants who had appeared
and walked out) then continued.
On Saturday afternoon, after the
University's case had been
presented against Mr. Lee and Mr.
Loeb, the hearing was adjourned
until Monday morning at which
time the defense of these two
students was expected to begin.
On Monday morning all four
defendants appeared. The two
defendants who had not appeared
on Saturday requested that their
cases also be heard at that
time—even though the hearing in
their cases had not yet been
scheduled again. After obtaining
the concurrence of Professor
Kaplan by telephone, Miss Altree
agreed to the request. It was then
decided that any testimony
against Mr. Knutson and Mr.
Downey which had also been
presented on Saturday against Mr.
Lee and Mr. Loeb would be
considered as testimony against all
four defendants in order to give
the two defendants who had
walked out of Saturday's hearing
a further opportunity for cross
examination.
On the basis of these facts
there has certainly been, in the
present case, no trial or hearing in
absentia. A hearing in absentia
occurs when the hearing proceeds
without any appearance. It is not
a trial in absentia when a hearing
continues after a person charged
voluntarily withdraws from the
hearing.
In view of these facts, I also
find it difficult to understand
your statement that Miss Altree
"reversed herself yesterday." Miss
Altree ruled on Saturday that the
hearing on the charges against Mr.
Lee and Mr. Loeb would proceed
despite the walkout by Mr. Lee
and Mr. Loeb and despite the
non-appearance of Mr. Downey
and Mr. Knutson. Her consent on
Monday to the request of Mr.
Downey and Mr. Knutson that
their cases also be heard on
Monday was hardly a reversal of
that ruling. Had Mr. Downey and
Mr. Knutson appeared on
Saturday, their cases would have
been heard at that time, together
with those of the defendants who
did appear.
Finally, I would think that a
detailed explanation by the Daily
of why it believes that the present
judicial procedures are "so heavily
stacked" would be immeasurably
more credible and helpful to its
readers than the naked conclusion
presented in the instant editorial.

not appear) another hearing
would have to be scheduled by
Professor Kaplan, and notices
again mailed etc.
In contrast, since Mr. Lee and
Mr. Loeb did appear on Saturday,
the hearing on the charges against
them was begun. These two
defendants made several motions,
and when these motions were
denied, they and their counsel

John j schwartz

walked out of the hearing. This
hearing (on the charges against the
two defendants who had appeared
and walked out) then continued.
On Saturday afternoon, after the
University's case had been
presented against Mr. Lee and Mr.
Loeb, the hearing was adjourned
until Monday morning at which
time the defense of these two
students was expected to begin.
On Monday morning all four
defendants appeared. The two
defendants who had not appeared
on Saturday requested that their
cases also be heard at that
time—even though the hearing in
their cases had not yet been
scheduled again. After obtaining
the concurrence of Professor
Kaplan by telephone, Miss Altree
agreed to the request. It was then
decided that any testimony
against Mr. Knutson and Mr.
Downey which had also been
presented on Saturday against Mr.
Lee and Mr. Loeb would be
considered as testimony against all
four defendants in order to give
the two defendants who had
walked out of Saturday's hearing
a further opportunity for cross
examination.
On the basis of these facts
there has certainly been, in the
present case, no trial or hearing in
absentia. A hearing in absentia
occurs when the hearing proceeds
without any appearance. It is not
a trial in absentia when a hearing
continues after a person charged
voluntarily withdraws from the
hearing.
In view of these facts, I also
find it difficult to understand
your statement that Miss Altree
"reversed herself yesterday." Miss
Altree ruled on Saturday that the
hearing on the charges against Mr.
Lee and Mr. Loeb would proceed
despite the walkout by Mr. Lee
and Mr. Loeb and despite the
non-appearance of Mr. Downey
and Mr. Knutson. Her consent on
Monday to the request of Mr.
Downey and Mr. Knutson that
their cases also be heard on
Monday was hardly a reversal of
that ruling. Had Mr. Downey and
Mr. Knutson appeared on
Saturday, their cases would have
been heard at that time, together
with those of the defendants who
did appear.
Finally, I would think that a
detailed explanation by the Daily
of why it believes that the present
judicial procedures are "so heavily
stacked" would be immeasurably
more credible and helpful to its
readers than the naked conclusion
presented in the instant editorial.

I find it impossible to believe
that your editorial "System
Stacked" (Daily 2/8/72) is based
on any reasonable understanding
of what has taken place during the
hearings to which you refer.
To begin with, the hearing
scheduled for Friday, February
4th was adjourned in the morning
when none of the defendants
appeared. At about noon on
Friday Professor Kaplan,
Chairman of the Campus Judicial
Panel, had notices hand delivered
to the mailing address of all four
defendants and their counsel
notifying them that he had
scheduled the hearing for the
following morning. In a
further attempt to notify them, he
requested the campus police to
deliver a copy of the notice to
each defendant personally. The
campus police did deliver this
copy to Mr. Lee and Mr. Loeb but
were unable to locate Mr. Downey
and Mr. Knutson.
On Saturday two defendants,
Mr. Lee and Mr. Loeb, did appear
and two, Mr. Knutson and Mr.
Downey, did not appear. No
proceedings were conducted with
regard to the latter two
defendants, and it was
acknowledged that as to them
(i.e., as to any defendants who do
not appear) another hearing
would have to be scheduled by
Professor Kaplan, and notices
again mailed etc.
In contrast, since Mr. Lee and
Mr. Loeb did appear on Saturday,
the hearing on the charges against
