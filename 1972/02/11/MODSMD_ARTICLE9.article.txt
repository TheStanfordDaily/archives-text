# more than alphabet soup
## CJP Gives Administration All Power 
### 
Most students and faculty at
Stanford seem to have had no
reaction to the imposition on the
student community of a new
judicial arrangement, the Campus
.Judicial Panel. They evidently
consider it to be merely a new
version of the old SJC—part of the
boring but inevitable alphabet
soup of bureaucracy. President
Lyman has reinforced this benign
image, in terming the CJP an
"interim system", which is to
exist only until the unruly
Student Senate consents to a new,
permanent judicial structure.
However, such a permanent
judicial system, one assumes,
would remedy what Lyman sees
as the "defects" of the old SJC:
of the two defects he cited on
KZSU November 23, the primary
one was the "total dependence of
the existing judicial system (i.e.,
SJC) on the cooperation of the
student government." One would
infer, therefore, that there will be
no new permanent judiciary for
students until the Student Senate
agrees to a system which does not
require the student government's
participation in it in order to
function; i.e., a system to judge
students that can (and one
assumes will) ignore the student
body's government. Until such

"agreement" is reached, students
will be subject to the "interim"
CJP.
All of which is to say that since
students will no longer allow
themselves to be co-opted into
legitimizing a judicial structure in
which students have no effective
participation (old SJC), then the
administration will simply create
an adjudicating procedure in
which students will have no
decision-making power at all: the
CJP. To be sure, that solution
only substitutes overt
administration control for the
covert, functional control it had
under the previous system, but
such a naked structure can be
useful in showing students exactly
how little authority students
really have at Stanford.
Despite the fact that there are
students on the CJP, this system,
in its conception, structure, and
actual operation, represents an
attempt by the Lyman
administration to consolidate in
itself all campus judicial authority
over students. If one were to
undertake the (admittedly
low-level) enterprise of actually
constructing a "flow chart" of the
CJP, one could hardly arrive at
any other conclusion.
The CJP system was apparently

designed by John Kaplan of the
Law School, and John Schwartz,
Special Assistant to the President
for Disciplinary Affairs (or some
such). John Schwartz happens to
be the university's prosecutor in
that system, and in that capacity
is interested in convicting students
as charged. Schwartz is also the
man within the President's Office
who actually brings charges
against any student that the CJP is
to try—a determination he
supposedly makes on his own
"impartial" reading of the
"facts".
The CJP itself is a complexly
yet curiously designed system. It
calls for a two-part proceeding:
the first held by an
"independent" hearing officer
(similar to the movie "Z"), who is
to decide, through adversary-type
hearings, what actually took
place. The second part is the full
CJP (three faculty, three students,
one chairman), who than are to
decide, on the basis of the hearing
officer's report, "the applicability
of University regulations and
appropriate sanctions." (Lyman)
Since the hearing officer takes all
the evidence, and determines
which aspects of the event will (or
will not) be admissible as
"relevant", his or her "impartial"
view of the "facts" defines the
basis for judgment. Such a
system effectively insulates the
three student members of the CJP
from listening to or questioning
either prosecution or defense
witnesses: they know what the
hearing officer tells them they
should know.
This hearing officer is chosen
from a list of seven candidates,
prepared by the three chairmen of
the Law School's three standing
committees (this is, of course, an
impartial list, since there are no
political overtones to the
composition of either the Law
School or these three
committees). The final choice is
actually made by the Chairman of
the. CJP—John Kaplan—who in
turn was appointed by President
Lyman.
The three student members are
chosen "objectively" by
computerized random sample.
Thus instead of, say, student
members elected at large by 30
percent or 40 percent of the
student population, Schwartz and

Kaplan decided on a three-man
sample for 12,000 students; not
exactly a statistically reliable
procedure. More importantly,
even if those three arbitrary
students voted as a bloc, the
system severely limits the range of
their authority, and anyway they
can be over-ruled by the- three
faculty members plus Kaplan,
who votes in "tied" situations.
And finally, if a defendant
wishes to appeal, he can do so—to
President Lyman.
In short, all this procedural
rubbish means that 1) John
Schwartz determines the charges
against a student, then prosecutes
him under a system he designed
with 2) John Kaplan, who chooses
the all-important hearing officer,
and provides the tie-breaking vote
in case of "deadlock"; and the
only appeal is to 3) President
Lyman, who hired Schwartz,
asked Schwartz and Kaplan to
design the new procedure, and
then appointed Kaplan chairman
of that new panel.
Given that these three men are,
for all functional intents and
purposes, of the same opinion in

Richard saltman

matters of student power and
dissent; given that a sizeable
minority—and on certain issues,
majority—of the students hold
differing views; and given the
source of this new CJP, and
the manner in which it invests
judicial authority, one could
plausibly worry about the way in
which this new system will be
used. Certainly, the nature and
direction of the present
proceedings doesn't leave one
much room for optimism.. . .
In this perspective, the issue at
stake in these CJP hearings is not
only the four individuals charged.
If this trial is allowed to finish,
and sentence passed and executed,
the CJP will have been
legitimized, and the opportunity
created for the Lyman
administration to use this patently
fraudulent construction at will.
The President's Office considers
itself the sole judge of acceptable
student actions on campus. I
would think every Stanford
student would be personally
insulted by that assumption.
