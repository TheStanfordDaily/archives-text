We can arrange to have a 1972 Capri V-6, or any other European car waiting for you in Europe at a
substantial savings. Let us show you how our complete package plan can save you money. All arrangements are
made at the lowest cost before you leave; including the best auto insurance, the safest return shipping, and free
S.E.A. services upon arrival of your car stateside. You also get a free S.E.A. travel kit which includes a Road Atlas,
maps, and the Boitish Royal Auto Club guide to the continent. Arrangements for financing can also be made.
