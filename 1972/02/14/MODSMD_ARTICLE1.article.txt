# Researchers Prepare Vaccines With Human Cells

(AP) — Sometime in the next two
months a child will take a drop of
cherry red liquid on his tongue and
swallow his way into American
medical history.
He will become the first member of
the general public in the United States
to take a polio vaccine prepared with
living human tissue cells.
For Dr. Leonard Hayflick, a
44-year-old professor of medical
microbiology at Stanford, the event
will culminate a 10-year battle to
change the way vaccines are
manufactured. It will end a decade of
scientific controversy and could open
an era eventually affecting everyone
receiving vaccines for diseases such as
polio, mumps, measles and rubella.
"It opens the door and means all
vaccines eventually can be produced
with human cells. It means vaccines
are going to be safer and cheaper and
we'll be able to achieve levels of
standardization that weren't possible
before," Hayflick asserted in an
interview.
To produce a vaccine, large

quantities of the virus it fights must be
grown, using living animal cells as the
soil. Polio virus, for example, is grown
in kidney tissue of African green
monkeys.
But only one batch of vaccine is
produced from each monkey, even
though secondary cell cultures could
be grown and more virus particles
produced. Scientists feared producing
"secondary" cultures from a
"primary" culture might produce
contaminants.
Similar techniques are used with
chicken embryo cells for measles and
mumps vaccine; duck embryo for
rubella.
But human cells never were used.
Some scientists worried other viruses
might be locked in the cells and the
stress of vaccine production would
unlock them, causing cancer or other
diseases in someone receiving the
vaccine.
Then 10 years ago Hay flick and a
colleague began growing human cells
from the lung of a fetus surgically
aborted. They conducted exhaustive
tests looking for viruses in the cells,
then sent the cells to dozens of other
scientists for more tests. No viruses
were found, and the cells, called WI-38
cells, were pronounced clean. There
was no evidence that starting new
secondary cultures of the cells caused
unwanted changes.
Meanwhile, other researchers began
finding dangerous viruses in monkey
and chicken tissue.
Scientists devised tests to screen for
these viruses in vaccines prepared with
animal tissue, but the possibility that a
test might fail or an unknown virus
slip through remained.
As a solution, Hayflick and his
colleague proposed growing vaccine
viruses in the WI-38 cells. There would

be no risk of unknown animal viruses.
It would be cheaper, since monkeys,
for example, cost about $50 each and
maintaining laboratory animals is
expensive. And using the same,
intensively studied human cells in
batch after batch of vaccine would
allow standardization of vaccines
impossible where a different animal is
used for each batch.
The original cells can divide up to
50 times, producing what Hayflick
said would provide enough cells to
meet all expected vaccine demands for
the next 20 years.
But the Division of Biologies
Standards (DBS) in the National
Institutes of Health, responsible for
regulating vaccines for the general
public, balked. DBS was supported by
other scientists who said using human
cells was risky. They said there might
be latent viruses in the WI-38 cells that
wouldn't show up for years.
Other countries, however, began
producing vaccines with the WI-38
cells. By 1970, Hayflick said, several
European countries including Russia,
France, Great Britain and Yugoslavia
had successfully used such vaccines for
polio, rubella, measles, smallpox and
other diseases.
In the United States, a respiratory
disease vaccine prepared from WI-38
cells was used by the military, which
isn't governed by DBS.
Finally last fall DBS said it would
consider a polio vaccine prepared from
human cells. Pfizer, Inc., a
pharmaceutical manufacturer, has
applied for permission to produce it.
Company spokesmen in New York
said they hope within two months to
receive final DBS approval and begin
marketing the vaccine through normal
channels.
