## Shaping Population Policy 
### 
jam.es rummonds

For the first time in our history
the government of the United
States is developing an explicit
population policy. While
discussion of population policy
can be politely phrased in terms of
such matters as family planning
and the morality of liberalized
abortion laws, it belongs more
properly to the realms of political
economy and human ecology. For
the decision to integrate
demographic concerns into the
political process, like the closing
of the frontiers of Western
civilization, represents a great
historical watershed.
Either overtly or covertly, the
forthcoming population policy of
the United States will influence
conscious decisions with regard
not only to national and
international patterns of wealth
distribution, resource
consumption, and political
domination, but also the role of
women and the family, the
availability of life styles, (job
opportunities, where we live, the
number of children we choose to
have), and man's very relationship
with himself and nature. It is a
decision once made, that could
influence events until the end of
history.
The first question is, what is
population policy? In the past,
government in the United States
has adopted measures that today
would be called population
policy. Examples include the
"open-door" immigration policy,
the Indian wars, and the
California Water Project. Each of
these measures dealt either with
the number of people living
within particular territorial
boundaries, the allocation of
resources (wealth) among
competing segments of the
population, or the composition of
the human stock controlling the
territorial resources.
However, at the time of their
adoption, these policies were
conceived of and intended to
serve other interests, namely,
nation building and resource
development. In this distinction
lies the unique character of
population policy today. In the
past, population policy has been
almost exclusively covert,
inadvertent, and beyond the
technological means of a society
to influence or manage directly.
Today it is manifestly a means
whereby rationally motivated
adjustments in the size,
distribution, and composition
characteristics of human
aggregations can be utilized to
accomplsh ends deemed desirable
by the dominant forces in society.
Thus, the critically important
question is, what values and
interests will be served by the
population policy of the United
States. (In other words, whose
interests will be protected and
promoted by the organized
resources of society, to what acts,
transactions or agreements will
public policy refuse to give its
sanction, what will be the plan,
purpose and morality of civil
regulation through population
policy?)
Two Positions
There are essentially two

positions. Population policy is
often understood as the provision
of family planning services equally
available to all, vigorous research
and development programs on
more effective means of birth
control, increased discretion for
doctor and patient with regard to
termination of unintended
pregnancy and like particularistic
measures. This approach is
predicated on the traditional
belief in the rationality of man
and the abstract notion of a right
natural order or "law".
Accordingly, it is assumed that,
when presented with full
information, an individual will
rationally choose a course of
action consistent with the goals of
the politically organized social
order. This applies to all behavior,
whether it be demographic,
political, or economic. This
approach enables policy-makers
not only to hold constant
political, and economic factors,
but to treat them as if they were
independent of demographic
trends.
This family planning or
unwanted fertility approach to
population policy is fatally
defective for two reasons. First,
because the assumption that
individual decisions will be
consistent with the "public
interest" is just an assumption.
The equally plausible assumption
that individual decisions are
inconsistent, if not contradictory
to the public interest invalidates
the whole approach.
Unwanted Fertility
Second, this approach to
population policy is, in reality, a
policy designed to accomplish the
specific goal of eliminating
"unwanted fertility". It does not
deal with the impact of the
numbers of people on the
realization of human values,
particularly non-economic values.
In other words, family planning
policy has yet to come fully to
issue with the reality, that the
number of people and their
distribution within an economic
or political community is
determinitive, to a substantial
degree, of the political and
economic value options available
to the community. To the extent
that these factors are perceived as
correlates or to the extent that a
desirable level of population is
envisioned, it is seen as a function
of demography's own natural law
that is, the "demographic
transition."
The operative principles behind
the decline from high to low birth
rates (the demographic
transition)are found in the social
and economic organization of
society. Urbanization and
industrialization lead to
substantial alteration, if not
disintegration, of the roles and
values of individuals in societies
characterized by high birth rates.
Cost Prohibitive
In short, in urban industiral
society the "costs" of children
become prohibitive or so say the
economists. Thus, it can be seen
that in reality a policy of family
planning relies not on freedom of
choice and individual rationality,
but on the dominant forces that

control the lives of individuals.
These are the social and economic
organization of society.
But does not this concept of a
demographic transition belie the
very intention of family planning
policy and raise a contradiction
between asserted and actual
values?
The distinct advantage of the
characterization of population
policy as family planning is that it
allows for the apparent
maintenance of "traditional
American values" within the
context of the modern "corporate
state". While reciting praise to
free enterprise, rationality, and
individual liberty, political and
economic power is being
concentrated in fewer and fewer
hands and the costs of not only
children, but individuality,
diversity and community are
becoming increasingly
burdensome.
Revolutionary Change
This represents nothing less
than a revolutionary change in the
basic conditions of American life.
As a result of their failure to
acknowledge these changed
conditions, apologists for the
corporate state are willing to offer
family planning policy as a
palatable if ineffective answer to
the population problem.
It is a feeble and pathetic
reaffirmation of the Aristotelian
dialectic, the power of rationality
and the Protestant ethic.
The alternative formulation of
population policy, like the first, is
predicated on an important
assumption. The assumption is,
that the population problem is
symptomatic of an imbalance in
the fundamental conditions of
human existence. Therefore, any
effort to resolve the problem must
address itself to these basic
conditions. This can be done by
recognizing four simple
propositions.
One, that man exists within the
context of a physical universe and
is subject to its controlling
principles.
Interdependent Systems
Two, that human life, like all
forms of known life, is supported
by delicate interdependent
systems that are limited in their
capacity to adapt to or tolerate
change.
Three, that human beings, in
common with other animals, will
compete for scarce resources. In
human society, the system of
resource allocation among
competing demands is called the
political economy.
Four, that human beings,
unlike all other organisms, have the
capacity, individually and
corporately, to choose among
diverse forms of adaptation to
demographic and environmental
conditions.
Population policy, if
understood as "the general
principles by which government is
guided in its management of

population affairs," must deal
with each of these propositions.
In short, the specific action
programs embodied in population
â€¢ policy that deal with birth
control, resources ownership and
regulation, health care, education,
and world economics must, each
be considered in the light of an
overall "population budget." Our
population, in other words, must
be consistent with the values for
which our society stands.
Never in the history of Western
man has there been a clearer
statement of the death of our
ideology than the decision by the
government of the United States
to develop an explicit population
policy. For, inherent in this
recognition of our finitude, is
recognition of the decay,
corruption, and alienation of
Western man in a "thing-oriented"
mass industrial society. Seize the
time!

For the first time in our history
the government of the United
States is developing an explicit
population policy. While
discussion of population policy
can be politely phrased in terms of
such matters as family planning
and the morality of liberalized
abortion laws, it belongs more
properly to the realms of political
economy and human ecology. For
the decision to integrate
demographic concerns into the
political process, like the closing
of the frontiers of Western
civilization, represents a great
historical watershed.
Either overtly or covertly, the
forthcoming population policy of
the United States will influence
conscious decisions with regard
not only to national and
international patterns of wealth
distribution, resource
consumption, and political
domination, but also the role of
women and the family, the
availability of life styles, (job
opportunities, where we live, the
number of children we choose to
have), and man's very relationship
with himself and nature. It is a
decision once made, that could
influence events until the end of
history.
The first question is, what is
population policy? In the past,
government in the United States
has adopted measures that today
would be called population
policy. Examples include the
"open-door" immigration policy,
the Indian wars, and the
California Water Project. Each of
these measures dealt either with
the number of people living
within particular territorial
boundaries, the allocation of
resources (wealth) among
competing segments of the
population, or the composition of
the human stock controlling the
territorial resources.
However, at the time of their
adoption, these policies were
conceived of and intended to
serve other interests, namely,
nation building and resource
development. In this distinction
lies the unique character of
population policy today. In the
past, population policy has been
almost exclusively covert,
inadvertent, and beyond the
technological means of a society
to influence or manage directly.
Today it is manifestly a means
whereby rationally motivated
adjustments in the size,
distribution, and composition
characteristics of human
aggregations can be utilized to
accomplsh ends deemed desirable
by the dominant forces in society.
Thus, the critically important
question is, what values and
interests will be served by the
population policy of the United
States. (In other words, whose
interests will be protected and
promoted by the organized
resources of society, to what acts,
transactions or agreements will
public policy refuse to give its
sanction, what will be the plan,
purpose and morality of civil
regulation through population
policy?)
Two Positions
There are essentially two

positions. Population policy is
often understood as the provision
of family planning services equally
available to all, vigorous research
and development programs on
more effective means of birth
control, increased discretion for
doctor and patient with regard to
termination of unintended
pregnancy and like particularistic
measures. This approach is
predicated on the traditional
belief in the rationality of man
and the abstract notion of a right
natural order or "law".
Accordingly, it is assumed that,
when presented with full
information, an individual will
rationally choose a course of
action consistent with the goals of
the politically organized social
order. This applies to all behavior,
whether it be demographic,
political, or economic. This
approach enables policy-makers
not only to hold constant
political, and economic factors,
but to treat them as if they were
independent of demographic
trends.
This family planning or
unwanted fertility approach to
population policy is fatally
defective for two reasons. First,
because the assumption that
individual decisions will be
consistent with the "public
interest" is just an assumption.
The equally plausible assumption
that individual decisions are
inconsistent, if not contradictory
to the public interest invalidates
the whole approach.
Unwanted Fertility
Second, this approach to
population policy is, in reality, a
policy designed to accomplish the
specific goal of eliminating
"unwanted fertility". It does not
deal with the impact of the
numbers of people on the
realization of human values,
particularly non-economic values.
In other words, family planning
policy has yet to come fully to
issue with the reality, that the
number of people and their
distribution within an economic
or political community is
determinitive, to a substantial
degree, of the political and
economic value options available
to the community. To the extent
that these factors are perceived as
correlates or to the extent that a
desirable level of population is
envisioned, it is seen as a function
of demography's own natural law
that is, the "demographic
transition."
The operative principles behind
the decline from high to low birth
rates (the demographic
transition)are found in the social
and economic organization of
society. Urbanization and
industrialization lead to
substantial alteration, if not
disintegration, of the roles and
values of individuals in societies
characterized by high birth rates.
Cost Prohibitive
In short, in urban industiral
society the "costs" of children
become prohibitive or so say the
economists. Thus, it can be seen
that in reality a policy of family
planning relies not on freedom of
choice and individual rationality,
but on the dominant forces that

control the lives of individuals.
These are the social and economic
organization of society.
But does not this concept of a
demographic transition belie the
very intention of family planning
policy and raise a contradiction
between asserted and actual
values?
The distinct advantage of the
characterization of population
policy as family planning is that it
allows for the apparent
maintenance of "traditional
American values" within the
context of the modern "corporate
state". While reciting praise to
free enterprise, rationality, and
individual liberty, political and
economic power is being
concentrated in fewer and fewer
hands and the costs of not only
children, but individuality,
diversity and community are
becoming increasingly
burdensome.
Revolutionary Change
This represents nothing less
than a revolutionary change in the
basic conditions of American life.
As a result of their failure to
acknowledge these changed
conditions, apologists for the
corporate state are willing to offer
family planning policy as a
palatable if ineffective answer to
the population problem.
It is a feeble and pathetic
reaffirmation of the Aristotelian
dialectic, the power of rationality
and the Protestant ethic.
The alternative formulation of
population policy, like the first, is
predicated on an important
assumption. The assumption is,
that the population problem is
symptomatic of an imbalance in
the fundamental conditions of
human existence. Therefore, any
effort to resolve the problem must
address itself to these basic
conditions. This can be done by
recognizing four simple
propositions.
One, that man exists within the
context of a physical universe and
is subject to its controlling
principles.
Interdependent Systems
Two, that human life, like all
forms of known life, is supported
by delicate interdependent
systems that are limited in their
capacity to adapt to or tolerate
change.
Three, that human beings, in
common with other animals, will
compete for scarce resources. In

planning relies not on freedom of
choice and individual rationality,
but on the dominant forces that

control the lives of individuals.
These are the social and economic
organization of society.
But does not this concept of a
demographic transition belie the
very intention of family planning
policy and raise a contradiction
between asserted and actual
values?
The distinct advantage of the
characterization of population
policy as family planning is that it
allows for the apparent
maintenance of "traditional
American values" within the
context of the modern "corporate

free enterprise, rationality, and
individual liberty, political and
economic power is being
concentrated in fewer and fewer

becoming increasingly
burdensome.
Revolutionary Change
This represents nothing less
than a revolutionary change in the
basic conditions of American life.
As a result of their failure to
acknowledge these changed

family planning policy as a
palatable if ineffective answer to
the population problem.
It is a feeble and pathetic
reaffirmation of the Aristotelian

and the Protestant ethic.
The alternative formulation of
population policy, like the first, is
predicated on an important
assumption. The assumption is,
that the population problem is
symptomatic of an imbalance in
the fundamental conditions of
human existence. Therefore, any
effort to resolve the problem must
address itself to these basic
conditions. This can be done by
recognizing four simple
propositions.
One, that man exists within the
context of a physical universe and
is subject to its controlling
principles.
Interdependent Systems
Two, that human life, like all
forms of known life, is supported
by delicate interdependent
systems that are limited in their
capacity to adapt to or tolerate
change.
Three, that human beings, in
common with other animals, will
compete for scarce resources. In
human society, the system of
resource allocation among
competing demands is called the
political economy.
Four, that human beings,
unlike all other organisms, have the
capacity, individually and
corporately, to choose among
diverse forms of adaptation to
demographic and environmental
conditions.
Population policy, if
understood as "the general
principles by which government is
guided in its management of

population affairs," must deal
with each of these propositions.
In short, the specific action
programs embodied in population
â€¢ policy that deal with birth
control, resources ownership and
regulation, health care, education,
and world economics must, each
be considered in the light of an
overall "population budget." Our
population, in other words, must
be consistent with the values for
which our society stands.
Never in the history of Western
man has there been a clearer
statement of the death of our
ideology than the decision by the
government of the United States

For the first time in our history
the government of the United
States is developing an explicit
population policy. While
discussion of population policy
can be politely phrased in terms of
such matters as family planning
and the morality of liberalized
abortion laws, it belongs more
properly to the realms of political
economy and human ecology. For
the decision to integrate
demographic concerns into the
political process, like the closing
of the frontiers of Western
civilization, represents a great
historical watershed.
Either overtly or covertly, the
forthcoming population policy of
the United States will influence
conscious decisions with regard
not only to national and
international patterns of wealth
distribution, resource
consumption, and political
domination, but also the role of
women and the family, the
availability of life styles, (job
opportunities, where we live, the
number of children we choose to
have), and man's very relationship
with himself and nature. It is a
decision once made, that could
influence events until the end of
history.
The first question is, what is
population policy? In the past,
government in the United States
has adopted measures that today
would be called population
policy. Examples include the
"open-door" immigration policy,
the Indian wars, and the
California Water Project. Each of
these measures dealt either with
the number of people living
within particular territorial
boundaries, the allocation of
resources (wealth) among
competing segments of the
population, or the composition of
the human stock controlling the
territorial resources.
However, at the time of their
adoption, these policies were
conceived of and intended to
serve other interests, namely,
nation building and resource
development. In this distinction
lies the unique character of
population policy today. In the
past, population policy has been
almost exclusively covert,
inadvertent, and beyond the
technological means of a society
to influence or manage directly.
Today it is manifestly a means
whereby rationally motivated
adjustments in the size,
distribution, and composition
characteristics of human
aggregations can be utilized to
accomplsh ends deemed desirable
by the dominant forces in society.
Thus, the critically important
question is, what values and
interests will be served by the
population policy of the United
States. (In other words, whose
interests will be protected and
promoted by the organized
resources of society, to what acts,
transactions or agreements will
public policy refuse to give its
sanction, what will be the plan,
purpose and morality of civil
regulation through population
policy?)
Two Positions
There are essentially two

positions. Population policy is
often understood as the provision
of family planning services equally
available to all, vigorous research
and development programs on
more effective means of birth
control, increased discretion for
doctor and patient with regard to
termination of unintended
pregnancy and like particularistic
measures. This approach is
predicated on the traditional
belief in the rationality of man
and the abstract notion of a right
natural order or "law".
Accordingly, it is assumed that,
when presented with full
information, an individual will
rationally choose a course of
action consistent with the goals of
the politically organized social
order. This applies to all behavior,
whether it be demographic,
political, or economic. This
approach enables policy-makers
not only to hold constant
political, and economic factors,
but to treat them as if they were
independent of demographic
trends.
This family planning or
unwanted fertility approach to
population policy is fatally
defective for two reasons. First,
because the assumption that
individual decisions will be
consistent with the "public
interest" is just an assumption.
The equally plausible assumption
that individual decisions are
inconsistent, if not contradictory
to the public interest invalidates
the whole approach.
Unwanted Fertility
Second, this approach to
population policy is, in reality, a
policy designed to accomplish the
specific goal of eliminating
"unwanted fertility". It does not
deal with the impact of the
numbers of people on the
realization of human values,
particularly non-economic values.
In other words, family planning
policy has yet to come fully to
issue with the reality, that the
number of people and their
distribution within an economic
or political community is
determinitive, to a substantial
degree, of the political and
economic value options available
to the community. To the extent
that these factors are perceived as
correlates or to the extent that a
desirable level of population is
envisioned, it is seen as a function
of demography's own natural law
that is, the "demographic
transition."
The operative principles behind
the decline from high to low birth
rates (the demographic
transition)are found in the social
and economic organization of
society. Urbanization and
industrialization lead to
substantial alteration, if not
disintegration, of the roles and
values of individuals in societies
characterized by high birth rates.
Cost Prohibitive
In short, in urban industiral
society the "costs" of children
become prohibitive or so say the
economists. Thus, it can be seen
that in reality a policy of family
planning relies not on freedom of
choice and individual rationality,
but on the dominant forces that

control the lives of individuals.
These are the social and economic
organization of society.
But does not this concept of a
demographic transition belie the
very intention of family planning
policy and raise a contradiction
between asserted and actual
values?
The distinct advantage of the
characterization of population

This family planning or
unwanted fertility approach to
population policy is fatally
defective for two reasons. First,
because the assumption that
individual decisions will be
consistent with the "public
interest" is just an assumption.
The equally plausible assumption
that individual decisions are
inconsistent, if not contradictory
to the public interest invalidates
the whole approach.
Unwanted Fertility
Second, this approach to
population policy is, in reality, a
policy designed to accomplish the
specific goal of eliminating
"unwanted fertility". It does not
deal with the impact of the
numbers of people on the
realization of human values,
particularly non-economic values.
In other words, family planning
policy has yet to come fully to
issue with the reality, that the
number of people and their
distribution within an economic
or political community is
determinitive, to a substantial
degree, of the political and
economic value options available
to the community. To the extent
that these factors are perceived as
correlates or to the extent that a
desirable level of population is
envisioned, it is seen as a function
of demography's own natural law
that is, the "demographic
transition."
The operative principles behind
the decline from high to low birth
rates (the demographic
transition)are found in the social
and economic organization of
society. Urbanization and
industrialization lead to
substantial alteration, if not
disintegration, of the roles and
values of individuals in societies
characterized by high birth rates.
Cost Prohibitive
In short, in urban industiral
society the "costs" of children
become prohibitive or so say the
economists. Thus, it can be seen
that in reality a policy of family
planning relies not on freedom of
choice and individual rationality,
but on the dominant forces that

control the lives of individuals.
These are the social and economic
organization of society.
But does not this concept of a
demographic transition belie the
very intention of family planning
policy and raise a contradiction
between asserted and actual
values?
The distinct advantage of the
characterization of population
policy as family planning is that it
allows for the apparent
maintenance of "traditional
American values" within the
context of the modern "corporate
state". While reciting praise to
free enterprise, rationality, and
individual liberty, political and
economic power is being
concentrated in fewer and fewer
hands and the costs of not only
children, but individuality,
diversity and community are
becoming increasingly
burdensome.
Revolutionary Change
This represents nothing less
than a revolutionary change in the
basic conditions of American life.
As a result of their failure to
acknowledge these changed
conditions, apologists for the
corporate state are willing to offer
family planning policy as a
palatable if ineffective answer to
the population problem.
It is a feeble and pathetic
reaffirmation of the Aristotelian
dialectic, the power of rationality
and the Protestant ethic.
The alternative formulation of
population policy, like the first, is
predicated on an important
assumption. The assumption is,
that the population problem is
symptomatic of an imbalance in
the fundamental conditions of
human existence. Therefore, any
effort to resolve the problem must
address itself to these basic
conditions. This can be done by
recognizing four simple
propositions.
One, that man exists within the
context of a physical universe and
is subject to its controlling
principles.
Interdependent Systems
Two, that human life, like all
forms of known life, is supported
by delicate interdependent
systems that are limited in their
capacity to adapt to or tolerate
change.
Three, that human beings, in
common with other animals, will
compete for scarce resources. In
human society, the system of
resource allocation among
competing demands is called the
political economy.
Four, that human beings,
unlike all other organisms, have the
capacity, individually and
corporately, to choose among
diverse forms of adaptation to
demographic and environmental
conditions.
Population policy, if
understood as "the general
principles by which government is
guided in its management of

population affairs," must deal
with each of these propositions.
In short, the specific action
programs embodied in population
â€¢ policy that deal with birth
control, resources ownership and
regulation, health care, education,
and world economics must, each
be considered in the light of an
overall "population budget." Our
population, in other words, must
be consistent with the values for
which our society stands.
Never in the history of Western
man has there been a clearer
statement of the death of our
ideology than the decision by the
government of the United States
to develop an explicit population
policy. For, inherent in this
recognition of our finitude, is
recognition of the decay,
corruption, and alienation of
Western man in a "thing-oriented"
mass industrial society. Seize the
time!

For the first time in our history
the government of the United
States is developing an explicit
population policy. While
discussion of population policy
can be politely phrased in terms of
such matters as family planning
and the morality of liberalized
abortion laws, it belongs more
properly to the realms of political
economy and human ecology. For
the decision to integrate
demographic concerns into the
political process, like the closing
of the frontiers of Western
civilization, represents a great
historical watershed.
Either overtly or covertly, the
forthcoming population policy of
the United States will influence
conscious decisions with regard
not only to national and
international patterns of wealth
distribution, resource
consumption, and political
domination, but also the role of
women and the family, the
availability of life styles, (job
opportunities, where we live, the
number of children we choose to
have), and man's very relationship
with himself and nature. It is a
decision once made, that could
influence events until the end of
history.
The first question is, what is
population policy? In the past,
government in the United States
has adopted measures that today
would be called population
policy. Examples include the
"open-door" immigration policy,
the Indian wars, and the
California Water Project. Each of
these measures dealt either with
the number of people living
within particular territorial
boundaries, the allocation of
resources (wealth) among
competing segments of the
population, or the composition of
the human stock controlling the
territorial resources.
However, at the time of their
adoption, these policies were
conceived of and intended to
serve other interests, namely,
nation building and resource
development. In this distinction
lies the unique character of
population policy today. In the
past, population policy has been
almost exclusively covert,
inadvertent, and beyond the
technological means of a society
to influence or manage directly.
Today it is manifestly a means
whereby rationally motivated
adjustments in the size,
distribution, and composition
characteristics of human
aggregations can be utilized to
accomplsh ends deemed desirable
by the dominant forces in society.
Thus, the critically important
question is, what values and
interests will be served by the
population policy of the United
States. (In other words, whose
interests will be protected and
promoted by the organized
resources of society, to what acts,
transactions or agreements will
public policy refuse to give its
sanction, what will be the plan,
purpose and morality of civil
regulation through population
policy?)
Two Positions
There are essentially two

positions. Population policy is
often understood as the provision
of family planning services equally
available to all, vigorous research
and development programs on
more effective means of birth
control, increased discretion for
doctor and patient with regard to
termination of unintended
pregnancy and like particularistic
measures. This approach is
predicated on the traditional
belief in the rationality of man
and the abstract notion of a right
natural order or "law".
Accordingly, it is assumed that,
when presented with full
information, an individual will
rationally choose a course of
action consistent with the goals of
the politically organized social
order. This applies to all behavior,
whether it be demographic,
political, or economic. This
approach enables policy-makers
not only to hold constant
political, and economic factors,
but to treat them as if they were
independent of demographic
trends.
This family planning or
unwanted fertility approach to
population policy is fatally
defective for two reasons. First,
because the assumption that
individual decisions will be
consistent with the "public
interest" is just an assumption.
The equally plausible assumption
that individual decisions are
inconsistent, if not contradictory
to the public interest invalidates
the whole approach.
Unwanted Fertility
Second, this approach to
population policy is, in reality, a
policy designed to accomplish the
specific goal of eliminating
"unwanted fertility". It does not
deal with the impact of the
numbers of people on the
realization of human values,
particularly non-economic values.
In other words, family planning
policy has yet to come fully to
issue with the reality, that the
number of people and their
distribution within an economic
or political community is
determinitive, to a substantial
degree, of the political and
economic value options available
to the community. To the extent
that these factors are perceived as
correlates or to the extent that a
desirable level of population is
