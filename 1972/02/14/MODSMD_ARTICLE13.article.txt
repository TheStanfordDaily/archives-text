## Cry, My Beloved Country

There is a little sunbrowned
boy who runs around naked in the
backyard of our home in
Thailand. When the monsoon
floods our garden, he wallows in
it, trying to catch the catfish. His
nickname is Mah Wat, which
roughly means "puppy of the
temple", for in Thailand lost or
stray dogs are given sanctuary in
the Buddhist temples, and Mah
Wat acts like those dogs:
pampered by our family and the
neighbors, wandering in and out
at will. When I left Thailand two
years ago he had just lerned to
walk.
When I came to America I was
a thoroughly Westernized, naively
idealistic foreign student. I came
from the elite class, and was
uncomfortable with the radical
rhetoric at Stanford. For all of
last year I stayed on the fringe of
the anti-war movement, trying to
come to terms with the fact that
the American involvement in
South East Asia were killing my
people. And yet it was hard to
reconcile this realization with my
own personal predicament of
having come from an upper-class,
comfortable background, for
radicals were accusing foreign
students of being trained in
America to return as the
managerial elite, and the
accusations struck too close to
myself.
Last summer I went home.
Before I left Stanford I made
arrangements with Pacific Studies
Center to do research on
counter-insurgency and American
involvement, both economic and
military, in Thailand.
I saw Mah Wat again, a year
older and a little chubbier. But
this time I saw him in a different
light. When I held him in my arms
again I could only see an image
which I had been forced to see
repeatedly at Stanford. It was the
image of an eight year old
Vietnamese child with his chin
meted to his chest, his face a
gaping hole of burnt flesh. And
then the rhetoric became real.
Watching Mah Wat play under the
rain trees, I saw too clearly what
FMC, McDonnell-Douglas, and
numerous war corporations were
doing. Cluster bombs and
anti-personnel weapons were no
longer words but mutilated flesh.
The cry of Vietnam became to me
a cry of Thailand, and all the
other peoples of South East Asia
who are being bombed and
maimed by American imperialism.
Travels
For a long while the word,
American imperialism was hard for
me to say. But I began to travel
around Thailand. I saw the
thousands of bars, massage
parlors, and brothels in Bangkok.
I saw the slums grow around U.S.

airbases, and the contempt which
U.S. servicement had for all
brown "gooks". I saw a whole
culture being debased. I saw,
finally, the complete
infrastructure, from petty
ventures such as brothels and
tailor shops, to large ventures such
as transportation and construction
firms on contract for U.S.
airbases, complete catering to and
depending on the American
counter-insurgency measures
aimed at suppressing internal
dissent, and which resutled in the
napalming and forced
resettlement of several hill tribes.
I returned to Stanford angered
but confused. By a gradual
process of political education,
through studying radical
economics, through meeting other
Third World people with the same
experience of imperialism, I began
to comprehend the
interrelatedness of imperialism: I
saw that what was happening in
Thailand was also happening in
Latin America, Africa, and the
rest of Asia. From a basically
nationalist consciousness I
broadened to a Third World
consciousness, where the struggles
of the oppressed peoples in
America and the rest of the world
are intimately tied to the Thai and
Vietnamese struggle. From that
consciousness, involvement in the
movement at Stanford was
natural.
Relevant
Every aspect of the movement
at Stanford is relevant to Third
World concern. The prestige of
Stanford University, exemplified
so well by the Faculty Club, was
bought at the expense of
thousands of Chinese coolies who
built Leland Stanford's railroads.
The racism of Shockley, not
merely academic but actually
practiced in the classroom,
reflects and builds upon the
rampant racism of the Vietnam
War. And the recruitment policy
reflects another distorted priority:
an abstract, tenuous pretense of
academic freedom being held
more important than the lives of
thousands of brown people who
are being maimed and killed every
day.
Yet there is much I can learn at
Stanford. There are many
attempts to acculturate foreign
students and turn us into
managers for the American
empire, but there is also a lot of
valuable knowledge that can be
used to the benefit of the Third
World. However, it would be a
gross hypocrisy for me to merely
study and remain complacent to
the harm which Stanford
University and the
weapons-producing corporations
are causing the peoples of South
East Asia. The only alternative is
to be involved, to actively
participate in a struggle which has
direct bearing on the struggle
thousands of miles away, and
which is relevant to the fate of a
presence, causing a severe problem
to the Thai economy. At the same
time the Gl's were paying $25 for
hired wives, American private
investment was borrowing.
I also saw the military aspects
of imperialism. I visited SRI in

BAngkok and researched the
counter-insurgency plans of
agencies of the Agency for
International Development or the
military. On the one hand, I
travelled upcountry, seeing the
still peaceful lives of the villagers.
On the other hand, I saw the
complete corruption of the Thai
government, and how it worked
hand-in-hand with the U.S.
government in developing
little sunbrowned child playing in
our backyard.
The price of involvement is
high, especially at the hands of
the Campus Judicial Panel which
may may have impartial members,
but which by its very structure
and set-up serves the interests of
the Administration.
For a non-American the risk is
even greater. As a guest in this
country my rights are very limited
and sometimes Americans are
offended that a "foreigner" is
meddling in American internal
affairs. But the fact is that as a
South East Asian whose people
are being killed by American
bombs, I have an implicit
responsibility to be involved, even
at the risk of being thrown out of
the country. This risk is very real,
and at times successful in
demoralizing and intimidating me.
I have no desire to be a martyr,
but it will be easier for me to face
Mah Wat with the knowledge that
I tried to stop the killing than to
return two years later with a
Stanford degree and good job
prospects, but knowing that in the
meantime the brothers and sisters
of Mah Wat all over Indochina
have been turned into burnt
marshmellows, and all the fathers
and mothers of Mah Wat over
South East Asia turned into pimps
and prostitutes, without my so
much as protesting.
I have been charged with
several incidents and will appear
before the Campus Judicial Panel
very soon. Several others are
currently being tried, and many
more will be charge; in the days to
come. The Student Senate and
ASSU Council of Presidents have
declared the CJP to be
illegitimate, and urged all students
to refuse co-operation with it.
In this time of very real
political repression, massive
resistance is the only way we may
retain our right to dissent.
Dissension and resistance invovles
risks now, and every person must
make that very preliminary
committment of being willing to
take risks for certain principles.
The peoples of Indochina have
taken their risks, and are winning.
The Placement Center Four have
taken their risks. I am taking risks
now. And in the days to come, if
this movement is to every
succeed, and if the war is to be
opposed, and repression on this
campus to be resisted, all of us
must make a committment, to a
certain level of struggle, recognize
the risks involved, and not be
intimidated. Only then will we
ever succeed.
