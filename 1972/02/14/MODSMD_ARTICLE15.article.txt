# Health Students Form Association
## 
### 
Health students at the Medical
Center formed the Stanford
Health Students Association
(SHSA) last week to work to
better health care by improving
communication and relationships
among health students.
The new group is
unconventional because it will be
open to all of the 550 health
students at the Medical Center
including medical, nursing,
physical therapy and graduate
students. Most schools have
organizations for medical students
and separate associations for other
health students, or none at all.
Work has begun on educational
projects, proposals for changes in
the nursing school and a variety of
social activities, including r
paint-in to be held at the Gardner
Health Center in San Jose.
Clinical team learning and
reorganization of preclinical
classes are two immediate
concerns of the group. To
improve communication among

health people the SHSA will
encourage the formation of
groups of students with common
interests and responsibilities at the
hospital.
The groups will discuss the
medical, social and psychological
problems of individual patients as
well as the problem of economic,
racial and sexual hierarchies
among health workers.
The SHSA will study
preclinical classes and propose
changes. One suggestion might be
for nurses, family practitioners
and x-ray technicians to study
anatomy together while students
in surgery would study anatomy
with the future operating room
nurses.
