BASEBALL
Phillie Rookies s—Stanford 2
Stanford I—U. of San Francisco 0
Stanford 9—U. of San Francisco 0
Ray Young's diamondmen lost their first game of
the season Friday to the Philadelphia Phillie
Rookies. The Rookies took a 2-0 lead, but the
Cards' A 1 O'Brien scored in the third and eighth to
send the contest into extra innings. Three unearned
runs in the eleventh gave the Rookies the game.
Not one USF runner has crossed the plate against
Stanford pitching this year. Earlier this week, the
Indians shut out the Dons 6-0 and kept up their
perfect record with 1-0 and 9-0 wins in a Saturday
afternoon doubleheader. Bob DiPietro and Nick
Peterson shut out USF in the opener and Dan Shaw
and Bob Kammeyer blanked the Dons in the
nightcap.
GOLF
Defending champion Gary Vanier did not have to
qualify in the San Francisco City Golf
Championships, but his teammates made a fine
showing in Saturday's play at Lincoln Park. Five
Stanford linksters placed in the top thirty on the
par 68 course. Tom Keelin, Jim Dwuletand Conrad

Nilmeier all turned in the second best score of the
day, 70. Bruce Robertson shot a 72 and Aly
Trompas recorded a 73.
Stanford frosh 53—Diablo Valley 1
The Stanford freshmen crushed Diablo Valley
College Friday afternoon on the Stanford Golf
Course, 53-1. Mike McGowan shot a 75 to pace the
frosh. George Pettinger turned in a 68 and Aly
Trompas and Bob Chapman scored 79's. Dave
Baskins and Dave Robinson also bested their Diablo
opponents with rounds of 80 and 81.
RUGBY
Bats 13—Stanford Varsity 10
In a rough game marred by numerous injuries,
the Bay Area Touring Side edged the Indian ruggers
with a long penalty kick in the last five minutes of
play. The Cards had been down 10-4, but Eric
Debooyer and Gordy Riegel broke out of a ruck and
thundered downfield with Riegel taking the ball
across for the four point try. Kip Oxman made the
conversion to knot the score at 10-10.
The Indians were within a yard of the winning
score after the Bats' go ahead kick but were
repulsed. Coach Pete Kmetovic's men outmuscled
the Bats but the visitors' superior kicking game
spelled the difference.

NUMBER TWO—Claude Terry leaps high over Oregon's Ken Strand to can a 25 foot shot that propelled
him into second place on Stanford's all-time scoring list. A 1 Carlson of the Ducks and Gary Cain look on
as Terry hits from the top of the key. Terry now needs only nine points to become the Indians' most
prolific scorer, a feat which will surely be accomplished at Oregon State this coming Friday.

runs in the eleventh gave the Rookies the game.
Not one USF runner has crossed the plate against
Stanford pitching this year. Earlier this week, the
Indians shut out the Dons 6-0 and kept up their
perfect record with 1-0 and 9-0 wins in a Saturday
afternoon doubleheader. Bob DiPietro and Nick
Peterson shut out USF in the opener and Dan Shaw
and Bob Kammeyer blanked the Dons in the
nightcap.
GOLF
Defending champion Gary Vanier did not have to
qualify in the San Francisco City Golf
Championships, but his teammates made a fine
showing in Saturday's play at Lincoln Park. Five
Stanford linksters placed in the top thirty on the
par 68 course. Tom Keelin, Jim Dwuletand Conrad

Nilmeier all turned in the second best score of the
day, 70. Bruce Robertson shot a 72 and Aly
Trompas recorded a 73.
Stanford frosh 53—Diablo Valley 1
The Stanford freshmen crushed Diablo Valley
College Friday afternoon on the Stanford Golf
Course, 53-1. Mike McGowan shot a 75 to pace the
frosh. George Pettinger turned in a 68 and Aly
Trompas and Bob Chapman scored 79's. Dave
Baskins and Dave Robinson also bested their Diablo
opponents with rounds of 80 and 81.
RUGBY
Bats 13—Stanford Varsity 10
In a rough game marred by numerous injuries,
the Bay Area Touring Side edged the Indian ruggers
with a long penalty kick in the last five minutes of
play. The Cards had been down 10-4, but Eric
Debooyer and Gordy Riegel broke out of a ruck and
thundered downfield with Riegel taking the ball
across for the four point try. Kip Oxman made the
conversion to knot the score at 10-10.
The Indians were within a yard of the winning
score after the Bats' go ahead kick but were
repulsed. Coach Pete Kmetovic's men outmuscled
the Bats but the visitors' superior kicking game
spelled the difference.

NUMBER TWO—Claude Terry leaps high over Oregon's Ken Strand to can a 25 foot shot that propelled
him into second place on Stanford's all-time scoring list. A 1 Carlson of the Ducks and Gary Cain look on
as Terry hits from the top of the key. Terry now needs only nine points to become the Indians' most
prolific scorer, a feat which will surely be accomplished at Oregon State this coming Friday.
BASEBALL
Phillie Rookies s—Stanford 2
Stanford I—U. of San Francisco 0
Stanford 9—U. of San Francisco 0
Ray Young's diamondmen lost their first game of
the season Friday to the Philadelphia Phillie
Rookies. The Rookies took a 2-0 lead, but the
Cards' A 1 O'Brien scored in the third and eighth to
send the contest into extra innings. Three unearned
runs in the eleventh gave the Rookies the game.
