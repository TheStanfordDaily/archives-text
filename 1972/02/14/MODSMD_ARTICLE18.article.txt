### BILL CLASTER 
A lay-up by Oregon State
guard Freddie Boyd in the final
four seconds Friday night gave the
Beavers a 68-64 victory over
Stanford, and put an end to the
Indians' six game home winning
streak. Boyd's shot, accomplished
in heavy traffic, broke a 64-64 tie
and was followed by a pair of Sam
Whithead free throws in the
game's last second.
Until Boyd made his shot, it
looked like nobody wanted to win
the game. Neither team played
particularly well, and they both
were plagued by numerous
mistakes.
Oregon State held a 38-35
halftime lead, and led by as much
as ten on one occasion. The
Beavers built their early advantage
on the shooting and rebounding
of 6'11" Steve Erickson and 6'9"
Neal Jurgenson.
However the Indians came to
life in the second half behind the
aggressive defense and rebounding
of forwards Steve Shupe and Bob
Buell. Buell tied the game at 62 all
with 4:20 left on a steal and a
lay-up. A free throw by Bob
Nicholson off of an OSU technical
(called because the Beavers would
not come out of their zone

defense and challenge the Indians)
and one by Claude Terry gave the
Tribe a 64-62 lead with 1:40 to
play.
But OSU's Jurgenson came
back to tie it on a jumper. The
Beavers then fouled Nicholson
who proceeded to miss the shot
and give the Beavers the ball with
45 seconds remaining. A near Bob
Buell steal with ten seconds left
gave the Beavers the ball out of
bounds underneath the Stanford
basket. The inbound pass went to
Boyd, and OSU had its victory.
The anticipated scoring duel
between Claude Terry and Boyd
never really materialized. Terry
had 19 but again was not in top
form. Boyd shot a poor 6 out of
18 from the floor and finished
with 15 points. Nevertheless, the
flashy OSU guard displayed some
amazingly quick moves, and
appeared to be able to get up a
good shot almost at will.
Jurgenson led the Beavers with
16, while Erickson, a soft
shooting sophomore, added 14.
The Northerners shot only 31%
from the floor, but hit 86% from
the line.
For the Indians, Buell and
Shupe each added 13 points to
their rebounding and

ball-hawking.
Saturday afternoon, the
Indians came from behind in the
waning minutes of the game to
edge the Oregon Ducks, 82-78.
Stanford led at halftime 41-33,
but Doug Little and Rusty Blair
brought the Ducks back to take a
53-52 advantage with 10:42
remaining in the contest.
Oregon pulled away to margins
of as many as nine points, but the
Cards scored 12 points in under
two minutes while shutting out
the Ducks to lead 78-73 in the
final seconds.
Claude Terry took game high
scoring honors with 26, 10 of
which came during Stanford's
dramatic comeback in the last six
minutes. The star senior now is in
second place on the Indian's
all-time scoring list and needs only
nine more to move ahead of Tom
Dose's 1441 points.
Little, playing aggressive
defense against Terry, netted 24
points to pace the Ducks. Bob
Buell poured in 17 points and
Steve Shupe grabbed a game-high
12 rebounds.
The Indian's Pac-8 record
stands at an even 4-4, while
Oregon languishes in last place
with an 0-6 mark.

Beavers then fouled Nicholson
who proceeded to miss the shot
and give the Beavers the ball with
45 seconds remaining. A near Bob
Buell steal with ten seconds left
gave the Beavers the ball out of
bounds underneath the Stanford
basket. The inbound pass went to
Boyd, and OSU had its victory.
The anticipated scoring duel
between Claude Terry and Boyd
never really materialized. Terry
had 19 but again was not in top
form. Boyd shot a poor 6 out of
18 from the floor and finished
with 15 points. Nevertheless, the
flashy OSU guard displayed some
amazingly quick moves, and
appeared to be able to get up a
good shot almost at will.
Jurgenson led the Beavers with
16, while Erickson, a soft
shooting sophomore, added 14.
The Northerners shot only 31%
from the floor, but hit 86% from
the line.
For the Indians, Buell and
Shupe each added 13 points to
their rebounding and

ball-hawking.
Saturday afternoon, the
Indians came from behind in the
waning minutes of the game to
edge the Oregon Ducks, 82-78.
Stanford led at halftime 41-33,
but Doug Little and Rusty Blair
brought the Ducks back to take a
53-52 advantage with 10:42
remaining in the contest.
Oregon pulled away to margins
of as many as nine points, but the
Cards scored 12 points in under
two minutes while shutting out
the Ducks to lead 78-73 in the
final seconds.
Claude Terry took game high
scoring honors with 26, 10 of
which came during Stanford's
dramatic comeback in the last six
minutes. The star senior now is in
second place on the Indian's
all-time scoring list and needs only
nine more to move ahead of Tom
Dose's 1441 points.
Little, playing aggressive
defense against Terry, netted 24
points to pace the Ducks. Bob
Buell poured in 17 points and
Steve Shupe grabbed a game-high
12 rebounds.
The Indian's Pac-8 record
stands at an even 4-4, while
Oregon languishes in last place
with an 0-6 mark.
A lay-up by Oregon State
guard Freddie Boyd in the final
four seconds Friday night gave the
Beavers a 68-64 victory over
Stanford, and put an end to the
Indians' six game home winning
streak. Boyd's shot, accomplished
in heavy traffic, broke a 64-64 tie
and was followed by a pair of Sam
Whithead free throws in the
game's last second.
Until Boyd made his shot, it
looked like nobody wanted to win
the game. Neither team played
particularly well, and they both
were plagued by numerous
mistakes.
Oregon State held a 38-35
halftime lead, and led by as much
as ten on one occasion. The
Beavers built their early advantage
on the shooting and rebounding
of 6'11" Steve Erickson and 6'9"
Neal Jurgenson.
However the Indians came to
life in the second half behind the
aggressive defense and rebounding
of forwards Steve Shupe and Bob
Buell. Buell tied the game at 62 all
with 4:20 left on a steal and a
lay-up. A free throw by Bob
Nicholson off of an OSU technical
(called because the Beavers would
not come out of their zone

defense and challenge the Indians)
and one by Claude Terry gave the
Tribe a 64-62 lead with 1:40 to
play.
But OSU's Jurgenson came
back to tie it on a jumper. The
Beavers then fouled Nicholson
who proceeded to miss the shot
and give the Beavers the ball with
