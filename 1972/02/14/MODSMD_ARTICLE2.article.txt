# Administration, Defense Finish Placement Case
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
Both the prosecution and defense
completed their closing arguments in
the case of the so-called "Placement
Center 4" Friday, after the defense
witnesses argued the "moral sense of
the community" demanded the
acquittal of the defendants.
Three defense witnesses described
the "war crimes." and military
production of the companies whose
interviews the four are accused of
disrupting, and recounted the futile
attempts made by students to change
Placement Center policy on military
and defense industry recruiting.
Political Science Professor Hubert
Marshall argued against a finding of
guilt in the case, asserting that it is
"inappropriate to apply the disruption
policy to non-violent interference with
military interviews."
Marshall argued that TRW and other
defense contractors committed
"incitement to induce Stanford
students to aid and abet" the
companies in their participation in
"the military violence going on in
South East Asia."
Moral Sense
A conviction "would run contrary
to the deeply held moral sense of the
community," Marshall concluded, to
applause from the defense team.
In his 45-minute closing argument,
University Prosecutor .John Schwartz

argued that interviews are a normal,
established, and legitimiate function of
the Placement Center. Duane
Linsenbardt, a graduate student, had
scheduled a 2:00 p.m. interview with
TRW, according to Schwartz, and had
requested a private conference with
the company representative.
Defendants In Room
Schwartz also said witnesses and
photographs placed all the defendants
in the interview room, and
uncontroverted testimony indicated
that the defendants followed the
student and the recruiter to another
interview room when they were moved
by the Placement Staff.
In both rooms, Placement Center
director Ralph Keller asked everyone,
including the defendants, to leave,
Schqartz asserted, and they did not
reply or exit.
He urged a finding of fact by the
hearing officer that "all in the room
knew that their departure was desired
and they had been ordered to leave."
Schwartz also urged a finding that
"each defendant intruded upon and
refused to leave a private conference
between a TRW representative and
Linsenberdt, and prevented the
effective carrying out of the
conference." For this reason, he
advocated a preliminary
recommendation of guilt in the case.
The prosecutor also maintained that

Don Lee had intentionally disrupted a
General Motors interview, and did not
leave when asked by Frances
Holtslander, supervisor of recruitment
activities.
Closing Arguments
In closing arguments for the
defense, counselor Owen Blank argued
on Lee's behalf that Holtslander had
demonstrated her bias against the
defendant by asking him to leave while
ignoring other demonstrators, and that
she had invalidated her request by
failing to identify herself.
Defense arguments in the charge
involving all four defendants took three
forms: that the defendants did not
interfere with genuine interviews, but
rather were entrapped by the
Administration; that even if they did
disrupt interviews, the recruiting was
not a legitimate University function,
and the four hence could not be
prosecuted for interfering with an
unlawful activity; and that even if they
violated the disruption policy, the
defendants were justified, because
they intended to prevent a larger,
genocidal crime.
Intimidation
According to the defense, the
administration by prosecuting the four
is attempting to "intimidate all
movement challenges." Counselors
also argued that the administration
had not prosecuted a genuine violation,
but instead attempted to
"manufacture a perfect case against
these individuals."
On rebuttal argument, Schwartz
denied that the prosecution had staged
the case, and noted that no warning or
request to leave was required to prove
a violation of the policy.
Each side must submit, written
arguments and documentary evidence
by Tuesday. Altree will then prepare a
written report containing findings of
fact and a preliminary
recommendation on issues of guilt or
innocence by February 25, and submit
it to the entire CJP.

A conviction "would run contrary
to the deeply held moral sense of the
community," Marshall concluded, to
applause from the defense team.
In his 45-minute closing argument,
University Prosecutor .John Schwartz

argued that interviews are a normal,
established, and legitimiate function of
the Placement Center. Duane
Linsenbardt, a graduate student, had
scheduled a 2:00 p.m. interview with
TRW, according to Schwartz, and had
requested a private conference with
the company representative.
Defendants In Room
Schwartz also said witnesses and
photographs placed all the defendants
in the interview room, and
uncontroverted testimony indicated
that the defendants followed the
student and the recruiter to another
interview room when they were moved
by the Placement Staff.
In both rooms, Placement Center
director Ralph Keller asked everyone,
including the defendants, to leave,
Schqartz asserted, and they did not
reply or exit.
He urged a finding of fact by the
hearing officer that "all in the room
knew that their departure was desired
and they had been ordered to leave."
Schwartz also urged a finding that
"each defendant intruded upon and
refused to leave a private conference
between a TRW representative and
Linsenberdt, and prevented the
effective carrying out of the
conference." For this reason, he
advocated a preliminary
recommendation of guilt in the case.
The prosecutor also maintained that

Don Lee had intentionally disrupted a
General Motors interview, and did not
leave when asked by Frances
Holtslander, supervisor of recruitment
activities.
Closing Arguments
In closing arguments for the
defense, counselor Owen Blank argued
on Lee's behalf that Holtslander had
demonstrated her bias against the
defendant by asking him to leave while
ignoring other demonstrators, and that
she had invalidated her request by
failing to identify herself.
Defense arguments in the charge
involving all four defendants took three
forms: that the defendants did not
interfere with genuine interviews, but
rather were entrapped by the
Administration; that even if they did
disrupt interviews, the recruiting was
not a legitimate University function,
and the four hence could not be
prosecuted for interfering with an
unlawful activity; and that even if they
violated the disruption policy, the
defendants were justified, because
they intended to prevent a larger,
genocidal crime.
Intimidation
According to the defense, the
administration by prosecuting the four
is attempting to "intimidate all
movement challenges." Counselors
also argued that the administration
had not prosecuted a genuine violation,
but instead attempted to
"manufacture a perfect case against
these individuals."
On rebuttal argument, Schwartz
denied that the prosecution had staged
the case, and noted that no warning or
request to leave was required to prove
a violation of the policy.
Each side must submit, written
arguments and documentary evidence
by Tuesday. Altree will then prepare a
written report containing findings of
fact and a preliminary
recommendation on issues of guilt or
innocence by February 25, and submit
it to the entire CJP.
Both the prosecution and defense
completed their closing arguments in
the case of the so-called "Placement
Center 4" Friday, after the defense
witnesses argued the "moral sense of
the community" demanded the
acquittal of the defendants.
Three defense witnesses described
the "war crimes." and military
production of the companies whose
interviews the four are accused of
disrupting, and recounted the futile
attempts made by students to change
Placement Center policy on military
and defense industry recruiting.
Political Science Professor Hubert
Marshall argued against a finding of
guilt in the case, asserting that it is
"inappropriate to apply the disruption
policy to non-violent interference with
military interviews."
Marshall argued that TRW and other
defense contractors committed
"incitement to induce Stanford
students to aid and abet" the
companies in their participation in
"the military violence going on in
South East Asia."

A conviction "would run contrary
to the deeply held moral sense of the
community," Marshall concluded, to
