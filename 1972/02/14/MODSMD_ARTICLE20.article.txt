# Davis Protest Expected
## 
### JAMES E. LOBSENZ 
Franklin Alexander, the National
Coordinator of the United Committee
to Free Angela, urged a noontime rally
audience last Friday, to "show up in
mass" for a protest demonstration
outside the County Courthouse today
at 10 a.m. in San Jose.
"There is a conspiracy in this
country to kill Angela Davis in the gas
chamber," Alexander declared. He
charged the white people of the
Stanford community with the
responsibility of protesting the
location and the restrictive security
conditions surrounding Davis' trial.
"If you don't do it,"he charged,
"you will be guilty of the greatest
crime — giving up your own rights."
Alexander explained that "a tide of
fascism" in this country was on its
way to limiting the rights of all
citizens to the exercise of free speech.
"The only way to guarantee your right
to civil liberties is to exercise them,"
he told the crowd.
Alexander stated that he did not
come to the rally to talk to black
people, because they were already
motivated to protest in Angela's
behalf. "I am talking in the main to
the people on my left, the white
people of this community," he said
while gesturing towards the Tresidder
lunchtime crowd a 100 yards away. He
invited them to come listen to him,
promising that "these black people
here will not eat you up." His appeal
was largely successful, and in a few

minutes a sizable crowd of about 200
people had gathered.
Alexander charged that the state is
trying to convict Angela for exercising
her right to free speech, and
specifically that the government was
trying to prevent her from speaking
out on thy prison system in California.
He explained that "the only way
we are ever going to be able to free
this frame up victim is by organizing
the grandest, biggest, thing this
country has ever seen. We wish to

build a people's movement."
He also condemned the practice of
putting all trial spectators through a
personal search, and a metal detection
probe before being allowed entrance
to the courtroom. He told the crowd
that he had asked a security guard
whether this was an infringement of
personal liberties. The guard answered,
"It may be, but we are going to do it
anyway." "What does this mean?"
asked Alexander. "It means they are
going to kill Angela Davis, anyway."
