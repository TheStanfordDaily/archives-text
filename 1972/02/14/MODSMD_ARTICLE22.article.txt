Time Says Irving Hoax
NEW YORK — Time magazine printed parts of Clifford
Irving's "Autobiography of Howard Hughes" yesterday
and said they proved the book is a hoax, much of it
pirated from another writer's unpublished manuscript.
The magazine also said Irving and his research assistant,
Richard Suskind, had admitted that the "autobiography"
was a hoax.
The Irving excerpts were published in tandem with
matching passages from a manuscript by writer James
Phelan, who once collaborated on a Hughes biography
with long-time Hughes aide Noah Dietrich, 83. Dietrich
later completed the book with another freelance writer,
Bob Thomas of the Associated Press, and it is to be
published this month.
Time said that in some cases the Irving and Phelan
manuscript versions of Hughes anecdotes were virtually
identical and sometimes they were substantially the same.
Air Attacks Continue
SAIGON — A Viet Cong Tet cease-fire for South Vietnam
began today, but the United States ignored it with a sixth
successive day of heavy air attacks.
The number of raids in South Vietnam soared past the
600 mark. One new strike was reported inside North
Vietnam.

Preliminary reports from the allied commands and spot
checks in the field indicated no serious violations in the
first hours of the four-day Viet Cong cease-fire that began
at 1 a.m. Monday-noon yesterday EST.
In the 24 hours prior to the truce, several small,
scattered actions were reported. One American was
reported killed and two were wounded.
The U.S. Command said tactical fighter-bombers and
rocket-firing American helicopter gunships killed 52
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops in three
actions—in the central highlands, the Mekong Delta and
east of Saigon. One U.S. helicopter was shot down 20
miles east of Saigon. The pilot was killed and the co-pilot
wounded.
Parliament Change Demand
LONDON — Thousands of families ate cold dinner
yesterday in unheated homes as power cuts multipled into
Britain's worst industrial crisis in 46 years and stirred
opposition to Prime Minister Edward Heath's Conservative
government.
The administration warned that Britain faces a total
shutdown of industry by the end of the month if a
five-week-old strike by coal miners continues to hamper
operations at coal-fired electricity plants.
An estimated 80 per cent of the country's 18 million
homes use electricity one way or another in their heating
systems.
