# ACLU Delays Decision
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
The American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) will not decide until March 9
whether it will join in a court
challenge of H. Bruce Franklin's ouster
from the faculty.
The issue had been scheduled for
last Thursday night's meeting of the
regional ACLU's Executive
Committee. But ACLU Legal Director
Paul Halvonik said ACLU involvement
in the Franklin case will be considered
instead by next month's meeting of
the Board of Directors, a larger group
than the Executive Committee.
Halvonik said "there is no rush
about it" because a court challenge
need not be mounted immediately. He
added that the delay will allow ACLU
members to study articles about the
Franklin case in the ACLU newsletter
this week. The magazine will include
the Advisory Board's summary and
opposing arguments about the case
from Law Professors Gerald Gunther
and Alan Dershowitz.
English Professor Ronald Rebholz,
a leader of a campus fundraising drive
to support the Franklin suit, said his

group has raised $6,200 thus far,
including $5,000 from a single
anonymous donor.
Fundraising Efforts?
Rebholz said major fundraising
efforts will not be scheduled until the
group knows whether the ACLU will
join the challenge.
"We'd go ahead anyway without
the ACLU," Rebholz explained, "but
it would help a great deal if the ACLU
did intervene. We would need a lot less
money."
In the meantime, Franklin has
stopped giving regular lectures to a
seminar based on the "Literature and
Revolution" course he had planned to
teach before his ouster.
Franklin said the course is being
taught by Merle Rabine, an English
graduate student and fellow
Venceremos member, because "Merle's
got the same thing to say and he can
say it as well as I can. We have the
most common ideas in the world."
Book About Stalin
The fired revolutionary is spending
much of his time researching and
writing a book about Stalin.
"It's a collection of his writings
plus a long historical essay, which is
the hardest thing I've ever written. It's
a question of summing up the history
of the twentieth century," Franklin
said.
Franklin argued that Americans
have been "conditioned to think of
Stalin as a murderer. But they said
those things about Fidel and Ho Chi
Minh, too."
Asked about rumors that he had
received a job offer from an Eastern
school, Franklin would say only that
he received a letter from the member
of "some committee," asking if he
would be interested.
Franklin said he responded that he
"wanted to stay around here for some
time, but what did they have in

mind?"
Franklin TV Interview
Rejecting protests from Law
Professor Herbert Packer, KGO-TV
last night aired an interview with
Franklin which included a phone call
to Packer.
Franklin was the guest in the studio
for the "Callout" program, taped
earlier in the week. Packer, who
supported Franklin's ouster, had
agreed in advance to participate in part

of the program over the telephone.
But Packer said he later made an
unsuccessful demand for omission of
his comments because "they shut me
off too quickly."
Packer said Franklin debated with
him over the phone and drowned out
his comments, when "I just expected
the moderator to ask me a question."
A spokesman for the San Francisco
television station said Packer would be
offered additional time in the future if
he wanted to expand his comments.

added that the delay will allow ACLU
members to study articles about the
Franklin case in the ACLU newsletter
this week. The magazine will include
the Advisory Board's summary and
opposing arguments about the case
from Law Professors Gerald Gunther
and Alan Dershowitz.
English Professor Ronald Rebholz,
a leader of a campus fundraising drive
to support the Franklin suit, said his

group has raised $6,200 thus far,
including $5,000 from a single
anonymous donor.
Fundraising Efforts?
Rebholz said major fundraising
efforts will not be scheduled until the
group knows whether the ACLU will
join the challenge.
"We'd go ahead anyway without
the ACLU," Rebholz explained, "but
it would help a great deal if the ACLU
did intervene. We would need a lot less
money."
In the meantime, Franklin has
stopped giving regular lectures to a
seminar based on the "Literature and
Revolution" course he had planned to
teach before his ouster.
Franklin said the course is being
taught by Merle Rabine, an English
graduate student and fellow
Venceremos member, because "Merle's
got the same thing to say and he can
say it as well as I can. We have the
most common ideas in the world."
Book About Stalin
The fired revolutionary is spending
much of his time researching and
writing a book about Stalin.
"It's a collection of his writings
plus a long historical essay, which is
the hardest thing I've ever written. It's
a question of summing up the history
of the twentieth century," Franklin
said.
Franklin argued that Americans
have been "conditioned to think of
Stalin as a murderer. But they said
those things about Fidel and Ho Chi
Minh, too."
Asked about rumors that he had
received a job offer from an Eastern
school, Franklin would say only that
he received a letter from the member
of "some committee," asking if he
would be interested.
Franklin said he responded that he
"wanted to stay around here for some
time, but what did they have in

mind?"
Franklin TV Interview
Rejecting protests from Law
Professor Herbert Packer, KGO-TV
last night aired an interview with
Franklin which included a phone call
to Packer.
Franklin was the guest in the studio
for the "Callout" program, taped
earlier in the week. Packer, who
supported Franklin's ouster, had
agreed in advance to participate in part

of the program over the telephone.
But Packer said he later made an
unsuccessful demand for omission of
his comments because "they shut me
off too quickly."
Packer said Franklin debated with
him over the phone and drowned out
his comments, when "I just expected
the moderator to ask me a question."
A spokesman for the San Francisco
television station said Packer would be
offered additional time in the future if
he wanted to expand his comments.
The American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) will not decide until March 9
whether it will join in a court
challenge of H. Bruce Franklin's ouster
from the faculty.
The issue had been scheduled for
last Thursday night's meeting of the
regional ACLU's Executive
Committee. But ACLU Legal Director
Paul Halvonik said ACLU involvement
in the Franklin case will be considered
instead by next month's meeting of
the Board of Directors, a larger group
than the Executive Committee.
Halvonik said "there is no rush
about it" because a court challenge
need not be mounted immediately. He
added that the delay will allow ACLU
members to study articles about the
Franklin case in the ACLU newsletter
this week. The magazine will include
