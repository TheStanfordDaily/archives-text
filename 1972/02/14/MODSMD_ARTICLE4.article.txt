# Area Demos Recommend Delegates
## 
### JIM WASCHER RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Several hundred voters from the
17th Congressional District met to
select members of California's giant
delegation to the Democratic National
Convention Saturday.
Supporters of nine contenders for
the party's presidential nomination
caucused separately throughout the

district to nominate delegates to the
Miami convention in July.
Several members of the Stanford
community were named to delegate
positions, including ASSU Council of
Presidents member Larry Diamond
(for Sen. George McGovern) and Prof.
Bernard Cohen, chairman of the
Sociology Department (for Sen.
Edmund Muskie).
Similar caucuses were held in the
state's 42 other Congressional districts.
Each caucus elected a district
representative who will sit on the
candidate's state committee. Those
committees will meet Saturday to
make the final selection of 238 of
California's 271 delegates to the
Democratic Convention.
The state committees are expected
to ratify the choices of the caucuses
but they are not required to do so.
Whichever candidate wins the June 6
primary will send his entire slate to the
convention.
Candidates holding caucuses were
Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm

(N.Y.); Senator Vance Hartke (Ind.);
Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, Jr.
(Minn.); Senator Henry Jackson
(Wash.) and Mayor John V. Lindsay
of New York City.
Also, former Senator and 1968
presidential candidate Eugene J.
McCarthy; Senator George S.
McGovern (S.D.); Senator Edmund S.
Muskie (Maine) and Mayor Samuel W.
Yorty of Los Angeles. Congressman
Wilbur D. Mills (Ark.),
Congresswoman Patsy Mink (Hawaii)
and Governor George C. Wallace (Ala.)
are also seeking the Democratic
presidential nomination, but did not
hold caucuses.
McGovern's caucus was the most
popular, with nearly 300 people
attending. Joe Carieton of the
Midpeninsula Citizens for McGovern
estimated that 45% of those attending
were under 30.
Elected district co-chairmen were
1970 Congressional candidate Stuart
McLean and Jose Martinez, director of
Operation SER, a Chicano manpower

training program. The caucus was held
at Wilbur Junior High School in Palo
Alto.
Diamond was the only Stanford
student nominated as a delegate. He is
the Northern California chairman of
the National Youth Caucus and served
as precinct coordinator in McLean's
campaign.
At the Muskie caucus, chaired by
Palo Alto Mayor Kirke Comstock,
sophomore Vic Harding was also
selected as a delegate, finishing seventh
in a field of 51 for the 12 positions
available.
Harding told the Daily that he
realized that as a delegate he would
have to "give an inordinate amount of
time," but that he felt it necessary' to
have "someone experienced in
parliamentary procedure" on the slate.
Harding, who served as a page at
the 1968 Democratic Convention in
Chicago, said that he intended to
concentrate heavily on "the less visible
things that the public doesn't always
pay attention to, things like the
selection of a national committeeman
and woman."
About 125 people turned out for
the Muskie caucus at the Palo Alto
Cultural Center, and 51 of those
declared their candidacy for delegate.
Mayor Comstock himself refused a
nomination because he felt the time
element involved would conflict with
his city job.
The caucus for New York Mayor
John V. Lindsay, held at Cubberley
High School in Palo Alto, drew 45
people, but no members of the
Stanford community were selected as
delegates. Two other Peninsula
students were selected, though.
The caucus for former Sen. Eugene
McCarthy drew only six people to

Columbae House as active participants,
none of them Stanford students. All
six were recommended as delegates.
Thirty three people attended the
Chisholm caucus which was held at the
home of Kate Harden in Sunnyvale.
Seven of those present were under 25.
Stanford graduate business student
Mike Heumann was nominated as a
delegate and was also selected as
district representative to Chisholm's
state committee.
The Humphrey caucus drew twenty
seven people to the Walter Hayes
Elementary School in Palo Alto.
Stanford senior Craig Granet was
recommended as a delegate to the
Convention. Granet was one of three
18-25 year olds at the Humphrey
caucus.
