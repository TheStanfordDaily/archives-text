# Another Meeting Today
## Fasters Confer With Lyman 
### JON GRAY 
A delegation representing about 20
people fasting in support of demands
for moratoriums on military recruiting
and on campus judicial proceedings
will meet with President Richard
Lyman this morning to continue
negotiations begun Friday.
Friday's negotiations ended after an
hour of inconclusive debate over
demands that Lyman: (1) hold an
open meeting with the Stanford
community, (2) declare a moratorium
on "war recruiting" at the Placement
Center, and (3) impose a moratorium
on prosecutions through the Campus
Judicial Panel.
Lyman rejected the demand for an

open meeting, observing that large
meetings "put a premium on boldness
to come to the mike," without
allowing participants to discuss issues
subtly.
Instead, he advocated small
meetings and radio shows using
phone-in questions as methods of
improving communications between
the Administration and the Stanford
community.
No Reply
Dave Josephson of Columbae
House responded, charging that some
students received no reply from
Lyman or Assistant to the President
Bill Stone when they wrote letters.
He contended that Lvman limits his

feed-back to a small segment of the
community by participating only in
small meetings and radio shows.
Josephson believes a broad spectrum
of the community would attend a
mass meeting because it requires less
initiative than phone calls, letters, or
small meetings.
Vice Provost Robert Rosenzweig
argued that open meetings "reward the
wrong qualities," and discriminate
against individuals who do not have
the theatrical ability or articulation to
impress an audience.
No Specific Policy
Josephson explained that fasters
demand a moratorium on military
recruiting without advocating a
specific policy.
Josephson justified the moratorium
as a device to force the University to
resolve the issue, instead of
perpetuating a "crisis" which has
existed since Fall quarter.
"COSS [the Committee on Student
Services] thinks it has come up with
something," Lyman noted. The
committee voted Wednesday 8 to 1 in
favor of recommending that "military
recruiters be barred from using the
formal placement facilities at
Stanford."
Noon Rally
The fasters will hold a noon rally
today to encourage students, faculty,
and staff to join them in fasting from
noon Monday until noon Tuesday in
support of the three demands. They
have scheduled a meeting Tuesday at
noon to break bread in White Plaza for
people who wish to end their fast at
that time.
The number of fasters has
diminished by about half since Friday,
when 43 people participated.
At a meeting Friday, the Faculty
Political Action Group voted to
support the fasters in their three
demands. FARG members plan to join
the fasters today at noon in White
Plaza.

Vice Provost Robert Rosenzweig
argued that open meetings "reward the
wrong qualities," and discriminate
against individuals who do not have
the theatrical ability or articulation to
impress an audience.
No Specific Policy
Josephson explained that fasters
demand a moratorium on military
recruiting without advocating a
specific policy.
Josephson justified the moratorium
as a device to force the University to
resolve the issue, instead of
perpetuating a "crisis" which has
existed since Fall quarter.
"COSS [the Committee on Student
Services] thinks it has come up with
something," Lyman noted. The
committee voted Wednesday 8 to 1 in
favor of recommending that "military
recruiters be barred from using the
formal placement facilities at
Stanford."
Noon Rally
The fasters will hold a noon rally
today to encourage students, faculty,
and staff to join them in fasting from
noon Monday until noon Tuesday in
support of the three demands. They
have scheduled a meeting Tuesday at
noon to break bread in White Plaza for
people who wish to end their fast at
that time.
The number of fasters has
diminished by about half since Friday,
when 43 people participated.
At a meeting Friday, the Faculty
Political Action Group voted to
support the fasters in their three
demands. FARG members plan to join
the fasters today at noon in White
Plaza.

HUNGER FAST—A Wells Fargo guard converses w»th unseen fasters yesterday in front of President Richard Lyman's
house.
A delegation representing about 20
people fasting in support of demands
for moratoriums on military recruiting
and on campus judicial proceedings
will meet with President Richard
Lyman this morning to continue
negotiations begun Friday.
Friday's negotiations ended after an
hour of inconclusive debate over
demands that Lyman: (1) hold an
open meeting with the Stanford
community, (2) declare a moratorium
on "war recruiting" at the Placement
Center, and (3) impose a moratorium
on prosecutions through the Campus
Judicial Panel.
Lyman rejected the demand for an

open meeting, observing that large
meetings "put a premium on boldness
to come to the mike," without
allowing participants to discuss issues
subtly.
Instead, he advocated small
meetings and radio shows using
phone-in questions as methods of
improving communications between
the Administration and the Stanford
community.
No Reply
Dave Josephson of Columbae
House responded, charging that some
students received no reply from
Lyman or Assistant to the President
Bill Stone when they wrote letters.
He contended that Lvman limits his

feed-back to a small segment of the
community by participating only in
small meetings and radio shows.
Josephson believes a broad spectrum
of the community would attend a
mass meeting because it requires less
initiative than phone calls, letters, or
small meetings.
