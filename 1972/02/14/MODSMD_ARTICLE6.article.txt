## Moratoria Demands 
### 
On Friday, three demands were presented to
President Lyman. They are: 1) an immediate
moratorium on use of the Placement Center by
military recruiters and recruiters from corporations
substantially involved in the War; 2) a moratorium
on campus judicial proceedings until a legitimate
judicial system is established; 3) a public meeting
with Lyman to discuss the issues of recruting and
judicial procedure.
All of these demands are reasonable and deserve
the support of the community.
The most important demand concerns the
Placement Center. It stems from the realization that
continued recruitment and continued
demonstrations in response serve no purpose at this
point except to make a solution to the problem
much more difficult. The Committee on Student
Services has supported an end to war-related
recruitment and that solution must be faced
honestly by the Administration.
The judicial problems on this campus are legion.
It is true that President Lyman, under the judicial
charter, has the legal right to make whatever
changes or establish whatever judicial system he
thinks is appropriate or necessary. Nonetheless, a
judicial system in which those who are being judged
have no control over the system which judges them
is hardly fair.
When student government refused to appoint
members to the old judicial council (SJC) they took
the course of last resort, hoping that by their refusal
to co-operate they would get the President to
unblock the judicial apparatus and seriously
consider several student-originated changes in the
procedures. Instead, the President put in a new

system, with the rules written by the prosecutor and
the head judge.
It is clear that the system now under operations is
inadequate. Justice would be better served by
calling a halt and trying, at least, to solve the
problem before allowing students to be sentenced,
possibly even expelled, unfairly. In doing this,
however, a mechanism must be established to allow
those students who wish an immediate trial, to have
one.
We offer enthusiastic endorsement to the third
demand presented to the President. A public
meeting with the President to discuss these issues is
long overdue. The fact that there has been no such
meeting on any issue in the recent past only
underscores the distance which lias grown up
between the governed and those who govern.
Communication may not solve any problems, but
without it there can only be mistrust and
misunderstanding.
Our attention has been drawn to these demands
by a group of over twenty people who are entering
their sixth day of fasting. They plan to continue
until the demands are met. Today many others have
indicated their intention to join the fast for
twenty-four hours, starting at noon, with a
convocation in White Plaza.
The decision to fast is an individual one which
can hardly be recommended from the editorial
pages of a newspaper. We do receommend, however,
that people support the demands of the fasters and
that President Lyman swiftly agree to the moratoria
and a public meeting so that we can move rationally
towards a solution of the problems which face us.
