## The 						End Of The 1-Y Deferment 
### 
peter hanawalt

In regulations effective
December 9, 1971, Selective
Service rescinded all reference to
the 1-Y classification. The status
covered by the former 1-Y,
however, has not changed. This
status covers temporary
unacceptability for induction due
to medical, moral, or
administrative conditions.
Selective Service has simply
re-named this category of
unacceptability 1-A (holding), and
has moved to a policy of having
only one medical exemption
classification, that of 4-F for
permanently disqualifying
conditions.
It is not clear how draft boards
plan to process men who
currently hold 1-Y classifications.
But it appears that the change of
name from 1-Y to 1-A (holding) is
not part of a plan to go back and
review all old 1-Y's, in order to
now find them fit for induction.
A man who is now 1-Y can
expect soon to be reclassified 1-A
or 4-F.
If a man now holds a
permanent 1-Y, that is, he is not
scheduled for re-examination,
then it appears that he should be
classified 4-F in the future. Local
boards in San Jose, however, have
interpreted regulations to state
that the 4-F determination could
only come from an Army
decision. Therefore, a permanent
1-Y file may be sent back to an
induction center to validate
classification to 4-F, or a man

may actually be called back for
re-examination for his 4-F to be
granted, although this latter
possibility seems unlikely.
Ordinarily, if a man fails a
physical examination twice for
the same condition, he will be
termed permanently
unacceptable. This status has
previously taken the form of a
permanent 1-Y or 4-F. We now
expect that a man in 1-A
(holding) who fails a second
physical for the same condition
will be given a 4-F. The local
board in San Jose agrees that this
may become the policy. It has
been our experience, however,
that with conditions such as high
blood pressure and
underweight/overweight, men
have continued to be called back
for re-examination more than
twice.
If a man now holds a
temporary 1-Y (date noted for
expiration/re-examination), then
it appears that he should be
classified 1-A (holding) in the
future. The classification card,
however, will have no indication
of whether or not it signifies 1-A
(holding) — that the man remains
medically unacceptable, or 1-A
(fully available). Most men can
determine this fact for themselves
by referring to the Notice of
Acceptability (DD Form 62) sent
them by the Army induction
center. No man can be inducted
until he has been determined to
be medically acceptable.

If a man has a Notice of
Acceptability checked
"unacceptable for service," then
he knows he is not currently
inductable. He will probably be
called up for a re-examination
physical at about the time that
was indicated as "date of
expiration" for the 1-Y. This time
of re-examination can be more
definitely predicted by looking at
the original copy of the Notice of
Acceptability in a man's draft file.
In the "remarks" section a
notation will read,
"re-examination believed justified
(RBJ) in — months."
Disadvantage
An immediate disadvantage of
the 1-A (holding) is the fact that a
man's classification appeal rights,
in order to be kept open, must
now be requested at a time when
he is not necessarily in need of
appeal. A man who is classified
1-A (holding) can appeal only if
he requests it in writing within 15
days of the date of mailing of the
1-A. His rights of appeal include a
personal appearance before the
local board and a personal
appearance before the state appeal
board of the state in which he is
living.
A man who has been
determined medically
unacceptable prior to receiving his
1-A should consider requesting his
appeal rights within the 15 day
period, even if he will not be
re-examined for 6 months or a
year. His appeal could be based on

a request for 4-F classification, or
simply on the apparent
inappropriateness of 1-A status
(supposedly meaning available for
induction), while he is
unacceptable. If requested, these
appeal rights may be granted
immediately, which renders them
less useful, or they may be
postponed by the local board
until a man is actually found
medically acceptable.
Classification appeal rights,
however, only indirectly confront
an adverse medical determination.
At best they allow a man to bring
facts to the board's attention, and
may give him additional time to
obtain new information. Because
the Army sets medical standards
and makes virtually all
acceptability decisions, a man's
most effective appeal is in directly
confronting the Army decision
that was made at the physical.
This can be done by submitting
additional medical information
and requesting re-examination, or
by requesting a final papers review
by the U.S. Army Recruiting
Command, which each man is
entitled to. These appeals should
be initiated through the local
board and will not be acted upon
if requested after issuance of an
induction order.
Priority Groups
Another disadvantage of the
1-A (holding) is the fact that a
man apparently enters the First
Priority Selection Group of the
lottery in the year in which he
receives the 1-A (holding), as he
would if he were 1-A (fully
available). Therefore, a man enters

the lottery pool in a year when he
is unacceptable for induction, and
if his number is reached, then he
remains available to be inducted
in the future as a member of the
Extended Priority Selection
Group (providing he is
subsequently found acceptable).
This interpretation of
unacceptability status and lottery
selection group has some
complexities. Selective Service
recently issued a regulation which
states that a man who remains
"fully available" to be inducted
for 270 consecutive days in the
First Priority and/or Extended
Priority Selection Groups will be
placed in Second Priority
Selection Group thereafter. This
necessary "full availability" does
not allow a man to be under any
appeals, and implies that 1-A
(holding) status would also not
count toward the 270 days.
However, the 1-A (holding) is not
a postponement of "full
availability" at the man's request,
nor does it have the lottery
advantages of a deferred status.
Further development of the new
270 day regulation may affect
more specifically the 1-A
(holding) status.
Again, Selective Service policy
for dealing with unacceptable
status in the absence of the 1-Y is
indefinite. Men with complicated
situations involving recent or
expected reclassification to 1-A
(holding) should feel free to
contact this office for more
information.

until he has been determined to
be medically acceptable.

If a man has a Notice of
Acceptability checked
"unacceptable for service," then
he knows he is not currently
inductable. He will probably be
called up for a re-examination
physical at about the time that
was indicated as "date of
expiration" for the 1-Y. This time
of re-examination can be more
definitely predicted by looking at
the original copy of the Notice of
Acceptability in a man's draft file.
In the "remarks" section a
notation will read,
"re-examination believed justified
(RBJ) in — months."
Disadvantage
An immediate disadvantage of
the 1-A (holding) is the fact that a
man's classification appeal rights,
in order to be kept open, must
now be requested at a time when
he is not necessarily in need of
appeal. A man who is classified
1-A (holding) can appeal only if
he requests it in writing within 15
days of the date of mailing of the
1-A. His rights of appeal include a
personal appearance before the
local board and a personal
appearance before the state appeal
board of the state in which he is
living.
A man who has been
determined medically
unacceptable prior to receiving his
1-A should consider requesting his
appeal rights within the 15 day
period, even if he will not be
re-examined for 6 months or a
year. His appeal could be based on

a request for 4-F classification, or
simply on the apparent
inappropriateness of 1-A status
(supposedly meaning available for
induction), while he is
unacceptable. If requested, these
appeal rights may be granted
immediately, which renders them
less useful, or they may be
postponed by the local board
until a man is actually found
medically acceptable.
Classification appeal rights,
however, only indirectly confront
an adverse medical determination.
At best they allow a man to bring
facts to the board's attention, and
may give him additional time to
obtain new information. Because
the Army sets medical standards
and makes virtually all
acceptability decisions, a man's
most effective appeal is in directly
confronting the Army decision
that was made at the physical.
This can be done by submitting
additional medical information
and requesting re-examination, or
by requesting a final papers review
by the U.S. Army Recruiting
Command, which each man is
entitled to. These appeals should
be initiated through the local
board and will not be acted upon
if requested after issuance of an
induction order.
Priority Groups
Another disadvantage of the
1-A (holding) is the fact that a
man apparently enters the First
Priority Selection Group of the
lottery in the year in which he
receives the 1-A (holding), as he
would if he were 1-A (fully
available). Therefore, a man enters

the lottery pool in a year when he
is unacceptable for induction, and
if his number is reached, then he
remains available to be inducted
in the future as a member of the
Extended Priority Selection
Group (providing he is
subsequently found acceptable).
This interpretation of
unacceptability status and lottery
selection group has some
complexities. Selective Service
recently issued a regulation which
states that a man who remains
"fully available" to be inducted
for 270 consecutive days in the
First Priority and/or Extended
Priority Selection Groups will be
placed in Second Priority
Selection Group thereafter. This
necessary "full availability" does
not allow a man to be under any
appeals, and implies that 1-A
(holding) status would also not
count toward the 270 days.
However, the 1-A (holding) is not
a postponement of "full
availability" at the man's request,
nor does it have the lottery
advantages of a deferred status.
Further development of the new
270 day regulation may affect
more specifically the 1-A
(holding) status.
Again, Selective Service policy
for dealing with unacceptable
status in the absence of the 1-Y is
indefinite. Men with complicated
situations involving recent or
expected reclassification to 1-A
(holding) should feel free to
contact this office for more
information.

In regulations effective
December 9, 1971, Selective
Service rescinded all reference to
the 1-Y classification. The status
covered by the former 1-Y,
however, has not changed. This
status covers temporary
unacceptability for induction due
to medical, moral, or
administrative conditions.
Selective Service has simply
re-named this category of
unacceptability 1-A (holding), and
has moved to a policy of having
only one medical exemption
classification, that of 4-F for
permanently disqualifying
conditions.
It is not clear how draft boards
plan to process men who
currently hold 1-Y classifications.
But it appears that the change of
name from 1-Y to 1-A (holding) is
not part of a plan to go back and
review all old 1-Y's, in order to
now find them fit for induction.
A man who is now 1-Y can
expect soon to be reclassified 1-A
or 4-F.
If a man now holds a
permanent 1-Y, that is, he is not
scheduled for re-examination,
then it appears that he should be
classified 4-F in the future. Local
boards in San Jose, however, have
interpreted regulations to state
that the 4-F determination could
only come from an Army
decision. Therefore, a permanent
1-Y file may be sent back to an
induction center to validate
classification to 4-F, or a man

may actually be called back for
re-examination for his 4-F to be
granted, although this latter
possibility seems unlikely.
Ordinarily, if a man fails a
physical examination twice for
the same condition, he will be
termed permanently
unacceptable. This status has
previously taken the form of a
permanent 1-Y or 4-F. We now
expect that a man in 1-A
(holding) who fails a second
physical for the same condition
will be given a 4-F. The local
board in San Jose agrees that this
may become the policy. It has
been our experience, however,
that with conditions such as high
blood pressure and
underweight/overweight, men
have continued to be called back
for re-examination more than
twice.
If a man now holds a
temporary 1-Y (date noted for
expiration/re-examination), then
it appears that he should be
classified 1-A (holding) in the
future. The classification card,
however, will have no indication
of whether or not it signifies 1-A
(holding) — that the man remains
medically unacceptable, or 1-A
(fully available). Most men can
determine this fact for themselves
by referring to the Notice of
Acceptability (DD Form 62) sent
them by the Army induction
center. No man can be inducted
until he has been determined to
be medically acceptable.

If a man has a Notice of

is unacceptable for induction, and
if his number is reached, then he
remains available to be inducted
in the future as a member of the
Extended Priority Selection
Group (providing he is
subsequently found acceptable).
This interpretation of
unacceptability status and lottery
selection group has some
complexities. Selective Service
recently issued a regulation which
states that a man who remains
"fully available" to be inducted
for 270 consecutive days in the
First Priority and/or Extended
Priority Selection Groups will be
placed in Second Priority
Selection Group thereafter. This
necessary "full availability" does
not allow a man to be under any
appeals, and implies that 1-A
(holding) status would also not
count toward the 270 days.
However, the 1-A (holding) is not
a postponement of "full
availability" at the man's request,
nor does it have the lottery
advantages of a deferred status.
Further development of the new
270 day regulation may affect
more specifically the 1-A
(holding) status.
Again, Selective Service policy
for dealing with unacceptable
status in the absence of the 1-Y is
indefinite. Men with complicated
situations involving recent or
expected reclassification to 1-A
(holding) should feel free to
contact this office for more
information.

In regulations effective
December 9, 1971, Selective
Service rescinded all reference to
the 1-Y classification. The status
covered by the former 1-Y,
however, has not changed. This
status covers temporary
unacceptability for induction due
to medical, moral, or
administrative conditions.
Selective Service has simply
re-named this category of
unacceptability 1-A (holding), and
has moved to a policy of having
only one medical exemption
classification, that of 4-F for
permanently disqualifying
conditions.
It is not clear how draft boards
plan to process men who
currently hold 1-Y classifications.
But it appears that the change of
name from 1-Y to 1-A (holding) is
not part of a plan to go back and
review all old 1-Y's, in order to
now find them fit for induction.
A man who is now 1-Y can
expect soon to be reclassified 1-A
or 4-F.
If a man now holds a
permanent 1-Y, that is, he is not
scheduled for re-examination,
then it appears that he should be
classified 4-F in the future. Local
boards in San Jose, however, have
interpreted regulations to state
that the 4-F determination could
only come from an Army
decision. Therefore, a permanent
1-Y file may be sent back to an
induction center to validate
classification to 4-F, or a man

may actually be called back for
re-examination for his 4-F to be
granted, although this latter
possibility seems unlikely.
Ordinarily, if a man fails a
physical examination twice for
the same condition, he will be
termed permanently
unacceptable. This status has
previously taken the form of a
permanent 1-Y or 4-F. We now
expect that a man in 1-A
(holding) who fails a second
physical for the same condition
will be given a 4-F. The local
board in San Jose agrees that this
may become the policy. It has
been our experience, however,
that with conditions such as high
blood pressure and
underweight/overweight, men
have continued to be called back
for re-examination more than
twice.
If a man now holds a
temporary 1-Y (date noted for
expiration/re-examination), then
it appears that he should be
classified 1-A (holding) in the
future. The classification card,
however, will have no indication
of whether or not it signifies 1-A
(holding) — that the man remains
medically unacceptable, or 1-A
(fully available). Most men can
determine this fact for themselves
by referring to the Notice of
Acceptability (DD Form 62) sent
them by the Army induction
center. No man can be inducted
until he has been determined to
be medically acceptable.

If a man has a Notice of
Acceptability checked
"unacceptable for service," then
he knows he is not currently
inductable. He will probably be
called up for a re-examination
physical at about the time that
was indicated as "date of
expiration" for the 1-Y. This time
of re-examination can be more
definitely predicted by looking at
the original copy of the Notice of
Acceptability in a man's draft file.
In the "remarks" section a
notation will read,
"re-examination believed justified
(RBJ) in — months."
Disadvantage
An immediate disadvantage of
the 1-A (holding) is the fact that a
man's classification appeal rights,
in order to be kept open, must
now be requested at a time when
he is not necessarily in need of
appeal. A man who is classified
1-A (holding) can appeal only if
he requests it in writing within 15
days of the date of mailing of the
1-A. His rights of appeal include a
personal appearance before the
local board and a personal
appearance before the state appeal
board of the state in which he is
living.
A man who has been
determined medically
unacceptable prior to receiving his
1-A should consider requesting his
appeal rights within the 15 day
period, even if he will not be
re-examined for 6 months or a
year. His appeal could be based on

a request for 4-F classification, or
simply on the apparent
inappropriateness of 1-A status
(supposedly meaning available for
induction), while he is
unacceptable. If requested, these
appeal rights may be granted
immediately, which renders them
less useful, or they may be
postponed by the local board
until a man is actually found
medically acceptable.
Classification appeal rights,
however, only indirectly confront
an adverse medical determination.
At best they allow a man to bring
facts to the board's attention, and
may give him additional time to
obtain new information. Because
the Army sets medical standards
and makes virtually all
acceptability decisions, a man's
most effective appeal is in directly
confronting the Army decision
that was made at the physical.
This can be done by submitting
additional medical information
and requesting re-examination, or
by requesting a final papers review
by the U.S. Army Recruiting
Command, which each man is
entitled to. These appeals should
be initiated through the local
board and will not be acted upon
if requested after issuance of an
induction order.
Priority Groups
Another disadvantage of the
1-A (holding) is the fact that a
man apparently enters the First
Priority Selection Group of the
lottery in the year in which he
receives the 1-A (holding), as he
would if he were 1-A (fully
available). Therefore, a man enters

the lottery pool in a year when he
is unacceptable for induction, and
if his number is reached, then he
remains available to be inducted
in the future as a member of the
Extended Priority Selection
Group (providing he is
subsequently found acceptable).

selection group has some
