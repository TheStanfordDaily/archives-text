## Shockley's Views Impair Teaching 
###

(The following is the result of
my research into how Dr.
Shockley has combined his roles
as a professor of electrical
engineering and a dysgenics
researcher. / have been
particularly interested in the
confrontation last Tuesday
between him and a member of his
class, Oladele Ajayi, a Nigerian
student.)
On Tuesday, Feb. 1, after a
meeting of Shockley's EE 327 A,
Mr. Ajayi was invited to discuss a
particular assignment Shockley
felt was not well executed. Dr.
Shockley asked Ajayi to explain
the problem to him and he
proceeded to demonstrate what
he was trying to accomplish. The
argument that ensued over that
particular assignment apparently
had root in a previous classroom
quiz which Ajayi had solved
correctly, but using a method
which Shockley had not
mentioned in the class.
In line with the philosophy of
the course, Ajayi had then
demanded an explanation from
Shockley as to why it was
inappropriate to use another
method. Shockley became upset
over the discussion, and, when the
Tuesday assignment came up he
was unwilling or incapable of
dealing with it.

During Tuesday's ' argument
Shockley stated that he had
gotten an "uneasy feeling" about
Ajayi's performance on the last
two assignments (the ones
following the first
demonstration). He also stated
that he was in an awkward
situation regarding Black
Americans and did not feel able to
grade Ajayi's future assignments
because of the strong emotions
involved in grading, and the
possibility of campus blacks
taking exception to a grade he
would give. He then suggested
Ajayi audit the course.
Ajayi told Shockley he did not
want to be an auditor unless
everyone in the class was, and
asked Shockley to clarify why he
should not take the class for a
grade. "Certain students do better
in certain subjects," was
Shockley's answer. He proceeded
to elaborate on the subject of
auditing with a statement
regarding his emotional inability
to grade Ajayi's work and his
opinion that on the basis of the
past two assignments the Nigerian
did not have the capability to pass
the course.
Ajayi's advisor who Shockley
had called in, now attempted to
question him on how he, as a
professor, could help Ajayi, given

the assumption that he did not
understand the work. Shockley
had no reply. The conversation
then turned to a discussion of
certain theories of the course
which Ajayi explained to
Shockley's satisfaction. The
meeting concluded with
Shockley's proposal to have an
independent grader grade all
papers for the course.
Unacceptable
This was unacceptable to
Ajayi, who contended he wanted
equal not preferential treatment,
and on Thursday the whole class
voted it down on the premiss that
if a professor is capable of
teaching a course, he is also
capable of grading it.
The following are clarifications
of certain points at issue:
Shockley has questioned
Ajayi's ability to pass the class.
However, on the tape of the first
lecture one hears him tell Ajayi
that his academic background and
grades qualify him for the course.
It is even noted that he
successfully completed a similar
course fall quarter at Stanford.
Beyond this, during the discussion
Tuesday Shockley admitted that,
up to the paper in question, Ajayi
had been performing well and
raising questions he himself had
not considered.
The question, then, is would a
white student with this strong
background, who had been
performing well in the class,
except for one paper (which those
who did not turn in were not
questioned on) be told he was
incapable and asked to audit the
course?
Over Reaction?
Shockley has accused Ajayi of
over-reacting to the normal
criticisms of a professor, and
seeking to cause trouble because
of his aversion to Shockley's racial
theories. However, listening to
tapes of earlier class periods where
discussions of campus politics
occurred, one hears Ajayi support
Shockley's right to free speech
and to teach electrical
engineering. Ajayi became upset
only after Tuesday, when it
became apparent that Shockley's
racial theories had ceased to be a
matter of free speech outside the
classroom and had become
applied within.
Shockley maintains there are
no racial overtones in his teaching
at Stanford and his confrontation
with Ajayi, the first black man or
woman to take a Stanford class
from him. However, going back
only three weeks, it was in his
class, on the day of the first
disruption, where he stated that
"Black people are here even when
sons of professors can't get in."

On the same day he made another
observation, this time to Ajayi,
where the racism was equally
blatant.
"I will be perfectly honest with
you about my theories, but in
your own case you are probably
in the top percentile of where you
came from," Shockley said.
Parallels
Coming now to the argument
on Tuesday with Ajayi, it seems
impossible to overlook certain
parallels between his statements
"Certain students do better in
certain subjects" and"I doubt
your capability to pass this
course," and Shockley's
advertisement in the Feb. 2nd
Daily saying, "Nature has
color-coded groups of individuals
so that statistically reliable
predictions of their adaptability
to intellectually rewarding and
effective lives can easily be made
and profitably be used by the
pragmatic man on the street."
Is this another case of
color-coding?
Beyond the area of racist
statements arises the more
fundamental question of whether
Shockley is able to effectively
teach a class with black students
in it. On his own admission the
presence of Mr. Ajayi made him
emotionally unable to evaluate his
work fairly. This emotional
reaction was magnified to the
point that Shockley felt unable to
evaluate any member of the class,
one of the major functions of a
professor.
One must question whether
Shockley, who feels Ajayi is
incapable because of one paper, is
not so threatened by the
possibility that a black man can
perform successfully in his own
field, that he is unable to function
as a professor and must seek some
way to prove the validity of his
theory. If this is the situation,
then any black man would
similarly threaten and incapacitate
Dr. Shockley.
We now come to the three
central issues to which Stanford
must address itself:
—Is Dr. Shockley capable of
teaching black students?
—If he is unable to teach black
students then Stanford is no
longer simply allowing him
academic freedom in his racial
theorizing, but is aiding him in the
implementation of his theories.
—If Stanford purports to be an
institution open to students of
any color, then it is both
impossible and illegal to retain a
professor who is unable to teach
any student who wishes to take
his course.
