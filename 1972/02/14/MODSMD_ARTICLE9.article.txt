Blind Condemnation
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the letter written by Gordon
Dexter, printed in Friday's Daily,
Mr. Dexter used the phrases,
"stupid, arrogant; self-righteous
antics and rantings of a small
group of thugs . . . psyco
paths . . . incipient fascists",
referring primarily to members of
the SRM.
I do not agree with many of the
activities of the SRM, but Mr.
Dexter's blind condemnation of
the movement and the people
involved in it goes far beyond any
rational or just disagreement. No
cause or group of people can be
blanketly condemned in such a
loose manner with any accuracy.
Most of the students involved in

the SRM are concerned and
thoughtful members of the
community who feel it their right
and duty to protest what they
view as injustices in the University.
While I agree that they are often
arrogant in their self-surety, I
suggest that Mr. Dexter himself is
not "without sin" in that respect.
Decisions and opinions on
campus issues should not be
reached after reading Daily
headlines or talking with your
freshman advisor. Read the
articles; think about them; then
talk to a member of the SRM who
could explain better than I or the
Daily the goals and beliefs of that
group.
