# Women's Athletics Challenged
## 
### TERRIE McDONALD (First in a series) 
Stanford not only attracts National
Merit scholars and high school student
body presidents, but also nationally
and internationally renowned female
athletes.
Some, like freshman tennis player
Liza Pande turn pro and become
ineligible for intercollegiate play, but
most others are simply absorbed into
the University where they find their
talents are unencouraged and
unrewarded.
Stanford does not actively recruit
its female athletes, nor does it award
athletic scholarships to women. The
women on campus with strong sports
backgrounds are unquestionably at
Stanford because of the school's
academic curriculum. However, in a
community which prides itself on
attracting and developing excellence,
women's athletics appears to reside
uncomfortably at the bottom of
university priorities.
The Women's Physical Education
(WPE) department has deliberately
directed its efforts toward serving the
broad spectrum of Stanford women
with the available funds and facilities.
The further development and
encouragement of highly skiiled girls
evidently comes at the expense of the
non-competitive classes and is a
trade-off that is made grudgingly.
Committee Review
At present, there is a joint
committee reviewing all aspects of
men's and women's athletics, physical
education and recreation at Stanford.

This Administrative Panel on Internal
Athletics, Physical Education and
Recreational Programs is comprised of
representatives from the Men's and
Women's Physical Education
Departments, the School of
Education, the Provost's office and the
Committee on Athletics and Physical
Education (CAPE). While insisting that
"informal" communication has always
existed between the men's and
women's gyms, some members regard
the Panel as the first, and critically
needed, "formal" channel for
co-operation between the
departments.
The panel, at its organizational
meeting in November 1971, proposed
"to explore ways and means for more
interchange between men's and
women's Physical Education
Departments (MPE and WPE)
regarding use of facilities, instructors,
equipment, programs, etc." For now,
the distance between the men's and
women's gyms remains
bureaucratically and philosophically as
well as geographically formidable.
Vicky King, like other members of
the men's varsity swim team, spends
between three and four hours each day
in the men's pool. She swims 12,000
yards daily with the rest of the team,
training under varsity coach Jim
Gaughran. She will receive one unit
academic credit for passing the MPE
intercollegiate swimming class, but
ironically, inflexibility of policy
language would prevent her from
competing on '.he women's
intercollegiate squad. Under present

wording, King would have to be
enrolled in the WPE's competitive
swimming class in order to swim with
the women's team. Men's conference
rules prohibit King from competing
against men in varsity meets and
Stanford does not recognize her as
eligible for women's competitive
swimming while she works with
Gaughran.
King is not currently affected by
the situation while she prepares for the
Olympic tryouts, but the technicality
raises questions about potential
conflicts and is one of the
discrepancies confronting the
Administrative Panel's goals of
co-operation and shared staff and
facilities.
King, a freshman, was 1970
National Champion freestyler, member
ol the 1968 Olympic swim team and
member of the 800 meter freestyle
relay team thaf, ;ield the world record
for two years. She will leave Stanford
spring quarter and return to Arden
Hills Swim Club to work with Sherm

Chavoor, 1972 Women's Olympic
Swimming Coach with whom she
trained for four years before coming
to Stanford. She speculated that when
she retires from high pressure A mature
Athletic Union (AAU) competitions
after the Olympics, she would like to
represent Stanford at the
intercollegiate level. Yet, when she
sees women working out in the smaller
Encina gym pools "because they are
swimming all over each other in the
women's pool" she sympathizes with
the numerous top-level ex-swimmers
who have given up swimming entirely
at Stanford.
Last spring, in a dispute over
department priorities, tournament
tennis players voiced their frustration
with their tournament scheduling.
Unlike the men, Stanford women do
not compete against other Pacific 8
schools on a formal basis. In basketball
the girls are satisfied with the level of
competition in their league while some
tennis players are outraged by theirs.

WOMEN TRAIN WITH MEN'S VARSITY—Vicky King, member of the men's
varsity swim team, sits with teammate Jeff Pease at meet against Arden Hills
Swim Club. Standing are swimmers Jock Stalker and Mei Ong, the Malasian
National Champion who, with King and Cathy Kriegshauser, works out with the
men.
Referring to the 36 match
tournament schedule that saw only
one Stanford girl lose one match, last
year's top seeded female player, Sally
Ride, stated, "It's not only not good
practice, it's bad practice to play
against girls who can't even serve."
Ride, Tyson Quit To Improve
Ride and Molly Tyson, her doubles
partner, are not on the tennis team
this year. They left a team Ride called
"potentially the best in the nation"
because they say WPE, in developing
the department, "has made a decision
between tournament play and general
improvement." Department staff
states that emphasis on the
instructional aspects of sports has been
accomplished by concentrating
resources on popular, high enrollment
classes. The number of tournament
classes has dropped from eight to five
in the last two years. Girls in the
remaining competitive programs have
specialized needs that are often lost in
a department geared to "breadth."
Ride spoke of the U.S. Lawn Tennis
Association (USLTA) invitational in
Ojai, California, which Stanford has
traditionally attended. After initially
being told they could not attend, four
girls eventually paid their own
expenses and made the 350 mile trip.
But, said Ride, "We had to beg and
plead and threaten to get them to sign
for us to play."
WPE department chairman Pamela
Strathairn explained the situation
differently. She noted that over the
past several years it has become
"department policy that we
participate and make our commitment
to events that are sponsored by
colleges and universities," specifically
those in the Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
(NCI AC). The approximately 18
public and private colleges and
universities from Fresno to the Oregon
border are members of NCIAC.
Strathairn reiterated that Stanford
traditionally took part in the Ojai
tournament until last year, but, she
said, "in light of the changed policies
of the department, which went into
effect when we felt we had a
commitment to students besides tennis
players, we had to limit [department
funding] to events sponsored by
colleges." She acknowledged that
department funding for the USLTA
tournament had been eliminated, but
said, "We gave the girls our blessings to

attend the tournament."
Broad Program Emphasized
Strathairn emphasized the
department's concern for
programming "breadth" and its
"obligation to provide competitive
experience on the intercollegiate level
for as many of the sports as possible."
She noted that an informal tennis
tournament between the Pacific 8
schools had also been cut from the
budget because "with the funds that
were available, we needed to have
them available for students in other
sports besides tennis, as well as for the
tennis program in general." It was
decided that the $300 to $1,000 it
cost to send six girls to Southern
California, Washington or Oregon
could be better spread out "extending
to 12 players taking part in five
divisional conference
tournaments. . and maintaining
intercollegiates in the other sports.
The importance of $300 to $1,000
to WPE is put into perspective when
one realizes that the entire travel
allotment for the department's five
varsity teams is $1,600. This amount
covers meals, transportation costs and
occasional overnight expenses for
faculty representatives and team
members in tennis, fencing (coed),
field hockey, basketball and
swimming.
Jim Gaughran estimates that the
men spend "over $20,000 at least" on
their competitive swimming program
alone with travel accounting for a
substantial portion of the amount.
Last year the women's gymnastics
and track and field instructor married
and left the department. Gymnastics is
now taught on elementary and
intermediate levels only and there
is neither a competitive women's
gymnastics team nor an organized
recreational group.
In contrast, fencing at Stanford,
with its long campus tradition, has a
separate intercollegiate affiliation with
the Northern California Fencing
Association (NCFA). Jean Helliwell,
instructs the elementary, intermediate,
advanced and tournament fencing
classes as well as an epee tutorial. She
observed that most students have
never picked up a foil before they join
a physical education class here, but
that from the beginning her
instruction is oriented toward
competition.
In addition to attending 10 or 11
NCFA intercollegiate meets yearly, the
16 students in the tournament fencing
class form the nucleus of Fencing

Club, an organization which includes
faculty, staff and alumni fencers and
participates in competitions funded by
club dues.
'Competition Is Fun'
Enthusiasm for the sport, which
goes beyond the 55 to 80 students
admitted to the limited enrollment
classes each quarter, reflects Helliwell's
philosophy that "competition is fun"
and that when students show they are
interested in learning a sport, "it's
worth the time to do it right."
Helliwell, who is working within the
department to review the women's
intercollegiate situation, advocates
travelling to other schools —
particularly to those differing from
Stanford in surroundings and facilities.
Her anecdotes of fencers from the
Midwest and East gaining a new
perspective on California through their
various tournament travels echoes the
statements of Sherm Chavoor and
Stanford swimmers.
Speaking about swimmers who have
set records or won titles, or any girl
who was highly motivated in
competitive sports before entering
college, Chavoor said, "Boys still have
the NCAA meets, strong
intercollegiate competition and
scholarships to look forward to; travel
is the big incentive for girls."
Varsity swimming is offered fall
quarter, to coincide with the NCIAC
season, but not during winter, when
the national meet is held. College
women are not eligible to compete in
the nationals unless they are registered
in a college swimming course.
Zelinger feels that it is the lack of
funds confining girls to Bay Area
competitions. "If we had the money,
we'd use it to get more out of town
meets," she said. When asked about
the inconvenience of swimming in the
women's pool, without starting blocks
or underwater lights, Zelinger said,
"Little things like that help, but in a
trade-off, we'd rather travel."
Money is undeniably a factor in
determining the scope of the women's
athletic programs, but Strathairn
subordinated it to the problem of
facilities. "The more important part of
this whole business of the
intercollegiate program does not
revolve around available funds for
travel to these meets and entry fees,
but rather the availability of facilities
to enable teams to have the kind of
practice they ought to have without
taking those facilities away from the
95 percent of the students who are not
on the teams."
