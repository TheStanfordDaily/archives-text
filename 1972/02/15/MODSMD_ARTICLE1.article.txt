# Women's Athletics Challenged
## 
### TERRIE McDONALD (First in a series) 
Stanford not only attracts National
Merit scholars and high school student
body presidents, but also nationally
and internationally renowned female
athletes.
Some, like freshman tennis player
Liza Pande turn pro and become
ineligible for intercollegiate play, but
most others are simply absorbed into
the University where they find their
talents are unencouraged and
unrewarded.
Stanford does not actively recruit
its female athletes, nor does it award
athletic scholarships to women. The
women on campus with strong sports
backgrounds are unquestionably at
Stanford because of the school's
academic curriculum. However, in a
community which prides itself on
attracting and developing excellence,
women's athletics appears to reside
uncomfortably at the bottom of
university priorities.
The Women's Physical Education
(WPE) department has deliberately
directed its efforts toward serving the
broad spectrum of Stanford women
with the available funds and facilities.
The further development and
encouragement of highly skiiled girls
evidently comes at the expense of the
non-competitive classes and is a
trade-off that is made grudgingly.
Committee Review
At present, there is a joint
committee reviewing all aspects of
men's and women's athletics, physical
education and recreation at Stanford.

This Administrative Panel on Internal
Athletics, Physical Education and
Recreational Programs is comprised of
representatives from the Men's and
Women's Physical Education
Departments, the School of
Education, the Provost's office and the
Committee on Athletics and Physical
Education (CAPE). While insisting that
"informal" communication has always
existed between the men's and
women's gyms, some members regard
the Panel as the first, and critically
needed, "formal" channel for
co-operation between the
departments.
The panel, at its organizational
meeting in November 1971, proposed
"to explore ways and means for more
interchange between men's and
women's Physical Education
Departments (MPE and WPE)
regarding use of facilities, instructors,
equipment, programs, etc." For now,
the distance between the men's and
women's gyms remains
bureaucratically and philosophically as
well as geographically formidable.
Vicky King, like other members of
the men's varsity swim team, spends
between three and four hours each day
in the men's pool. She swims 12,000
yards daily with the rest of the team,
training under varsity coach Jim
Gaughran. She will receive one unit
academic credit for passing the MPE
intercollegiate swimming class, but
ironically, inflexibility of policy
language would prevent her from
competing on '.he women's
intercollegiate squad. Under present

wording, King would have to be
enrolled in the WPE's competitive
swimming class in order to swim with
the women's team. Men's conference
rules prohibit King from competing
against men in varsity meets and
Stanford does not recognize her as
eligible for women's competitive
swimming while she works with
Gaughran.
King is not currently affected by
the situation while she prepares for the
Olympic tryouts, but the technicality
raises questions about potential
conflicts and is one of the
discrepancies confronting the
Administrative Panel's goals of
co-operation and shared staff and
facilities.
King, a freshman, was 1970
National Champion freestyler, member
ol the 1968 Olympic swim team and
member of the 800 meter freestyle
relay team thaf, ;ield the world record
for two years. She will leave Stanford
spring quarter and return to Arden
Hills Swim Club to work with Sherm

Chavoor, 1972 Women's Olympic
Swimming Coach with whom she
trained for four years before coming
to Stanford. She speculated that when
she retires from high pressure A mature
Athletic Union (AAU) competitions
after the Olympics, she would like to
represent Stanford at the
intercollegiate level. Yet, when she
sees women working out in the smaller
Encina gym pools "because they are
swimming all over each other in the
women's pool" she sympathizes with
the numerous top-level ex-swimmers
who have given up swimming entirely
at Stanford.
Last spring, in a dispute over
department priorities, tournament
tennis players voiced their frustration
with their tournament scheduling.
Unlike the men, Stanford women do
not compete against other Pacific 8
schools on a formal basis. In basketball
the girls are satisfied with the level of
competition in their league while some
tennis players are outraged by theirs.
