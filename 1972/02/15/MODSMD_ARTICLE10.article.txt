# Women Prison Offical Responds
## 
### 
Nita Turner, Senior Deputy at Milpitas Women's Jail,
disagreed with many of the criticisms commonly made of
women's prisons in a telephone interview with the Daily
Tuesday.
"We have a work-furlough program for our prisoners
where they can leave prison every day to go to college
classes or to work," Turner said. "Some of them work at
jobs they had before they were incarcerated."
The Milpitas Jail holds between seventy and a hundred
women. Sixteen of them participate in the work-furlough
program.
Only women who have received sentences of less than a
year are imprisoned at the Milpitas facility.
"We try to provide counseling," Turner stated.
"Psychologists, drug abuse people, Alcoholics Anonymous
and church groups all come to the prison to help the
women."
"We have no high school equivalency courses or
vocational training," she added. "However, we do have
typing classes."
"We also try to provide exercise facilities," she
continued. "There's a yard outdoors where the ladies play
volleyball, and a room inside for bad weather. In the past,

lots of the prisoners gained weight, but in the last two or
three years it hasn't been brought to my attention."
The prisoners can order any book they want from the
County Library, according to Turner. The librarian comes
to the prison once a week to pick up and deliver books
they have ordered.
"We also don't censor the mail at all," Turner said.
"Each prisoner can receive and mail one letter a day to
each person that she writes to. The only reason for the
limit is that we don't have enough storage space."
On the subject of drugs, Turner said, "There are no
drug problems in jail that I'm aware of. We do have a
full-time doctor available in case anyone goes through
withdrawal when she first comes in. We also have nurses."
The Milpitas prisoners are allowed one half-hour visit a
week. They can have two people present during the visit.
The visitors and the prisoner are separated by a glass panel
and must talk over the telephone.
If a prisoner has children, the children are allowed to
visit her once a month.
Turned added that the women sleep in dormitories
rather than cells. There are no facilities for solitary
confinement in the Milpitas facility, according to Turner.
