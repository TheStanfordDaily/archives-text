### 
I wake in middle-of-the-night terror
next to the warm sleeping body of my
lover
yet alone in the conviction that I am
in a prison cell
shut away, suddenly, from all that
makes my life.
I sense the great weight of the prison
pressing down on the little box of
room I lie in
alone forgotten.
How often do women awake
in the prison of marriage,
of solitary motherhood
alone and forgotten,
of exhaustion from meaningless work,
of self-despising learned early,

of advancing age
alone and forgotten.
How many women lie awake at this
moment
struggling as I do against
despair,
knowing the morning will
crush us once again
under the futility of our lives.
And how short a step it is
—for us—to the more obvious
imprisonment
of bars and concrete
where our sisters lie
alone forgotten.
