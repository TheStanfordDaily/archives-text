# Often Worse Than Men's
## Prison Problems Parallel Women's Troubles Outside 
### LYNN REDER 
The California Institue for Women (C.1.W.) at
Frontera looks more like a convalescent hospital
than a prison. The buildings are always spotlessly
clean and there is some semblance of an educational
program of vocational training and recreation.
In some very obvious ways though women's
facilities are worse than men's institutions. Because
so few women are in prison, they can not afford to
build different complexes for different types of
convicted women. There is only one correctional
institution in California for women.
All women, from maxium to minimum security,
are housed there, ages ranging from 15 to 67. Prison
officials estimate that one per cent or less of women
prisoners need "maximum" security confinement,
yet controls for these few govern the lives of all
women in prison.
Another problem is that between 50 and 80
percent of women in jail have children and thus they
experience much suffering. When a man goes to
prison, he presumes that his wife will continue to
raise the children. However, in the reverse situation,
the woman is much less confident. Often children
are sent to another home by an agency.
Vaginal Exam
Mortification and profanation of women
prisoners begins with the rectal and vaginal exam for
contraband and a supervised bath to insure that the
inmate really cleans herself.
The vaginal inspection is common to almost any
women's jail or prison. Some institutions claim that
it is for health reasons as well as a search for narcotics.
Most inmates claim that it has little to do with
either: it is just another step in destroying the
captive's pride.
The 'search' or inspection is sometimes done
several times and with many people present.
Furthermore, although the vagina is always suspect,
they never check the nose or ears.
All of the prisoner's possessions are taken away
and she is given unattractive uniforms to wear; she
may be stripped at any time for the possibility of
smuggling. At Alderson, the federal prison, even a
woman's underpants are taken away; she must wear
boxer shorts of a coars material. C.I.W. is more
lenient in this respect: inmates may keep their
underwear if they are of r w pastel color; navy blue,

purple, brown, black or red are not allowed (the
latter because the guards consider red the color of
homosexuals.)
More debilitiating than this loss of privacy and
freedom is the psychological dependency on the
guards instilled in the prisoners. Most of the guards
were at one time working in mental institutions or
as school teachers and tend to think of these women
as mental cases or as children.
An inmate who dares to defy authority is placed
in solitary confinement. This rehabilitation consists
of total isolation from all stimuli, be it people,
books, movies or work. If an inmate persists at
defying the women guards, the male "goon squad''
is called to strip and shower the "problem".
It seems that prison life just perpetuates the
common dependency syndrome found in most
women. The person making decisions is no longer a
parent, boyfriend or husband, but the authority
figure is still present, now in the shape of a guard.
Life in prison consists of one bell after another.
The other major time consumer in prison is
concern with one's health and one's appearance. At
C.I.W. and at Terminal Island, women are allowed
to purchase cosmetics. One of the most frequent
"special entertainments" at prisons are fashion
shows and one prison in New York achieved the
absurd by holding a beauty contest: "Miss
Imprisoned America!'"
Female values and emotional weaknesses are
perpetuated in yet another way. As well as being
forced to be dependent upon the guards, most of
the inmates find surrogate men to lean on in their
homosexual relationships. The homosexual
relationship in itself is not bad; it provides the
inmates with feeling of belonging and gives them
their only source of love and affection while in
prison. The sad part is that the relationships
produce all of the bad qualities one finds in
heterosexual relationships, i.e., jealousy and
dependency.
Censorship
Both the educational facilities and the vocational
training programs are decidely worse in women's
prisons than in men's. Libraries are always smaller in
women's institutions with most legal books and any
political material prohibited. To prohibit lawbooks
seems especially outrageous, it i, rather like denying

a suspect her lawyer.
An example of some of the "political' material
denied the women prisoners are black magazines as
controversial as Ebondy and Jet. Spanish literature
are also frequently banned as are incoming or
outging letters in Spanish; the censors can not read
them.
Men's prisons have correspondence courses;
women's do not. For women, the domestic arts are
stressed in prison: cleaning, kitchen work and the
needle arts. Women earn 2 to 6c per hour for
keypunching, ironing or sewing uniforms.
An evaluation of vocational training programs for
women made by the State of California's
Department of Corrections agreed that vocational
rehabilitation was a total failure. The vocational
programs at C.I.W. are essentially ceramics,
cosmetology, vocational sewing, landscaping,
laundry, vocational housekeeping and nurses' aid
training.
Women are on probation and parole longer with
more frequent visits required of them than men. This
helps women remain moredependent and facilitates a
greater number of probation and parole violations
for them.
Suit Filed
There are many more job placement centers and
attempts to get male ex-cons jobs. The men have
more work furlough opportunities and job hunting
furloughs. Patty Roberts, an attorney associated
with the Prison Law Project in Berkeley, recently
filed suit against the San Bruno Jail in San Francisco
County because men in the jail were allowed out on
work furloughs and the women were not.
The California Institute for Men has a visiting
policy where wives and children can have a picnic
lunch in a parklike setting in the prison and visit
with the inmates. Apart from the conjugal visits
men are also allowed out in some prisons for a
period of three days in order to begin job hunting
for positions to assume upon release.
Mrs. Swisher, in charge of the punishment prison
at Muncy said, however, she "probably wouldn't
encourage" conjugal visits for home furloughs for
women: "It might be all right for men. but it's going
to makt> a whole lot more work for the state nine
months later if they allow women oyt. .«. ."

LUCKY—Although ho may not realize it, the male prisoner is better off in many
ways than the female prisoner. Men have better work furlough programs, more
vocational training, more library, and better exercise facilities than women
