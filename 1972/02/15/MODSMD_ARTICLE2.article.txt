# Davis Supporters Tour Security Set-Up
## 
### 
About 450 people attended a two-hour long rally
yesterday in a parking lot 150 yards away from the
courtroom in which Angela Davis will probably be
tried, and then "toured" the security facilities
installed by Santa Clara County for the trial.
According to ASSU co-president Doug McHenry,
about 60 Stanford students drove to San Jose for
the demonstration in a chartered bus and in car
pools organized by the Black Students Union. He
characterized the size of the Stanford contingent as
"disappointing."
Leaflets and posters at the rally advanced four
specific demands: "1. [An] unconditional end to
the prohibition of free speech and peaceable
assembly. 2. A larger courtroom or at least facilities
for the public equal to those for the press. 3.
Removal of the 12 foot steel fence locking in the
Angela Davis courtroom, and an end to mugshots
for courtroom visitors. 4. Dismissal of charges
against those arrested in peaceful picket lines
supporting Angela Davis."
Twenty-four people have been arrested near the
courtroom during the past three weeks and charged
with violations of California Penal Code section
169.
This statute prohibits "picketing or parading"
near a courtroom with "the intent to interfere with,
obstruct, or impede the administration of justice

0r... to influence any judge, juror, witness, or
officer of the court in the discharge of his duty,"
and provides misdemeanor penalties for violators.
Davis supporters claim the law unconstitutionally
abridges their rights to free speech and assembly,
and plan to challenge its validity in court. An
identical Louisiana law was found constitutional in
a unanimous 1965 U.S. Supreme Court decision.
Pre-trial hearings in the Davis case were
completed last week, and Judge Richard Arnason
has adjourned the court until he decides on motions
submitted during the hearings. When the court
reconvenes, Arnason will probably set a date for the
long-delayed trial.
The "National United Committee to Free Angela
Davis" organized yesterday's rally, and obtained a
permit from County Executive Howard Campen to
use the parking lot across from the county
administration building.
The four-hour permit, which established
conditions for the rally, expired at 2:00 p.m.
The protesters' "tour" proceeded with the
permission of Sheriff's Lieutenant Don Tamm, who
spoke briefly to tha audience after being called
"front and center" by Franklin Alexander,
co-chairman of the National United Committee.
"Tourists" were "guided" by Fania Davis Jordan,
Angela Davis' sister and one of the so-called "San

Jose 24" arrested for demonstrating near the
courtroom.
Before beginning the "tour," Alexander issued
strict instructions to ensure "perfect discipline" and
avoid arrests. He ordered demonstrators to refrain
from carrying signs, clapping, singing, chanting, or
giving clenched-fist salutes.
About 20 monitors carrying walkie-talkies
supervised the marchers, leading them through the
county building complex and by the fences
encircling the entrance to Courtroom No. 1 in the
Criminal-Legal building, where Davis will be tried.
Jail facilities in San Jose for Davis have not yet
been completed, and she is still being held at North
County Jail in Palo Alto, according to Sheriff's
Office officials.
During the rally Stanford's Third World
Liberation Front distributed a leaflet announcing a
noon rally on Wednesday in White Plaza, which will
demand the dismissal of Electrical Engineering
professor William Shockley from the University, the
acquittal of all people facing criminal and CJP
charges for disrupting Shockley's classes, and an
investigation conducted by third world people of
"Stanford's racist policies and practices."
The rally and tour yesterday attracted more than
100 newsmen, including reporters from national
television networks and international newspapers
and magazines.
