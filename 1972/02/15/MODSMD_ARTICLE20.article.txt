"Jamming with Edward/" Mick
Jagger, Nicky Hopkins, Bill
Wyman, Ry Cooder, Charlie
Watts, Rolling Stones Records
COC 39100.
There's just no excuse for this
record. It's so pitiably poor that
the five "artists" whose names are
displayed so prominently on the
cover must be ashamed. If they're
not, they should be.
This album is a jam session that
was taped during the recording of
"Let It Bleed" in 1969, which the
Rolling Stones are just getting
around to releasing at a discount
($3.98 list) rate. Unfortunately,
this record is a rip-off at half the
price.
It's hard to pinpoint exactly
what's wrong with this record.
With so much talent in evidence,
as witness Hopkins' superb
keyboard performance and
Cooder's imaginative guitar work,
it deserves a better fate than it
got.
The fault, surprisingly enough,
seems to be with the three Stones,
most particularly drummer Watts
and vocalist Jagger. Mick just does
not operate well in a jamming
situation: he seems to need a
polished set of lyrics that he can
experiment with, as is the
situation with most of the Stones
songs. The sort of situation he
found himself in with "Jamming
with Edward!" was virtually a
make-it-up-as-you-go-along deal.
And the usually excellent Watts
just sounds bored by the whole
thing.
Long Waits
Simon and Garfunkel were
frequently the target of criticism
because it took them seemingly
ages to produce a new album—it

was a year and a half between
"Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and
Thyme" and "Bookends," and
another year and a half until
"Bridge Over Troubled Water."
But what is overlooked is that the
Stones are just as slow. "Beggar's
Banquet" was released in
mid-1968; their next new album,
"Let It Bleed," in late 1969; and
their newest studio album,
"Sticky Fingers," in mid-1971.
The difference between the
oft-criticized S&G and the Stones
is that in the period since
"Beggar's Banquet," the Stones
have released four, count 'em,
greatest-hits and/or live albums:
'Through the Past Darkly
(Greatest Hits Volume 2)," "Get
YerYa-Yas Out," "Hot Rocks
1964-1971", and now "Jamming
with Edward!"
That's called saturating the
market. But if they run out of
good material, that's still no
reason to perpetrate "Jamming"
on us. No excuse at all.

"Sittin' In," Kenny Loggins and
Jim Messina. Columbia C 31044.
This is a pretty good album,
but certainly nothing to write
home about. It's primary fixtures
are Kenny Loggins, composer of
the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's
"House at Pooh Corner" (which is
included here), and Jim Messina,
formerly with Poco and before
that with Buffalo Springfield, who
wrote many of the songs,
produced, played lead guitar, and
sings on this album.
The album is basically pretty
bland, which in itself places it

above other releases in that it is
not actively revolting. It's
basically good-timey music that is
for the most part unobtrusive but
pleasant.
Chief flaw on the album is
Loggins' voice, which somewhat
resembles David Crosby's voice on
the Crosby, 'Stills and Nash studio
version of "Long Time Comin'."
However, where Crosby can alter
his voice for different songs,
Loggins always sounds virtually
the same.
The only song on which he
really shines is "The House at
Pooh Corner,'' which is kind of
loosely based on A.A. Milne's
children's tales. It is a marvelous,
gentle, wry song, and Loggins'
version is far superior to the Nitty
Gritty Dirt Band's.
Universally Good
Otherwise, "Sittin' In" is
proudcer/singer/writer Messina's
album. Since splitting from Poco,
this is his first venture, and his
songs on this record are almost
universally good.
His good, clean vocal style is at
its best on "Lovin' Me," but he
makes a substantial contribution
throughout the record.
His major flaw, however, is that
he is not a very good guitarist. In
Buffalo Springfield, he replaced
Bruce Palmer on bass, and
whatever talents he had on guitar
must surely have paled beside
those of Stephen Stills and Neil
Young. Here, he is competent at
best, and invisible at worst.
All told, "Sittin' In" is not
brilliant, but it has its moments.
It's an enjoyable way to spend
three and a half bucks.

Singles l n' Things
Don McLean's "American Pie"
(United Artists), which dominated
the singles charts for so long, has
finally been knocked out of the
number one spot, and will soon be
relegated to "solid gold" status.
According to KFRC, the usurper
was A 1 Green's "Let's Stay
Together" (Hi/London), which
only lasted a week at the top and
which was in turn dumped by
Nilsson's "Without You" (RCA),
a comfortable piece of schlock if
ever there was.
McLean meanwhile has been
unable to produce a follow-up
single after the fantastc success of
his first. Both "Vincent" and
Winter Wood" from his album
have received airplay, but neither
are tremendously good.
A novelty record with all the
appeal of Daddy Dewdrop's
"Chick-a-boom" is "Jungle Fever"
(Polydor) by Chakachas. Needless
to say, it has no rhyme or reason,
is totally senseless and ridiculous,
and is well on its way to becoming
a huge hit. So it goes.

Neil Young's "Heart of Gold"
(Reprise) from his forth-coming
"Harvest" Ip is one of the fastest
rising singles on the charts. It is
much better than Young's last 45,
"Only Love Can Break Your
Heart," and if it is any indication,
the album should be a real treat.
Boring Ways
After a brilliant single in
"Everybody's Everything,"
Santana has reverted to its old
boring ways with "No One to
Depend On" (Columbia), which
soudns like "Oye Como Va,"
which sounds like "Jingo," which
sounds like "Evil Ways," which
sounds like. . . .
After her unwarranted success
with "Brand New Key," Melanie
Safka is trying "Ring the Living
Bell" (Neighborhood) as a
follow-up. The newer song is an
improvement over the first, but
won't be nearly as big a hit.
After years of success in Britain
and failure in the U.S., T. Rex
finally has an American hit with
"Bang a Gong" (Reprise), while
Three Dog Night and Bread both
continue their lengthy win streaks

with, respectively, "Never Been to
Spain" (Dunhill) and "Everything
I Own" (Elektra).
Robert John is hitting big with
his faithful remake of the old
Tokens hit "The Lion Sleeps
Tonight" (Atlantic), while Paul
Simon has a sure thing in "Mother
and Child Reuinion" (Columbia..
Fascinating Song
The best new song on the
charts is America's "A Horse with
No Name" (Reprise), which is a
fascinating song more than faintly
reminiscent of Neil Young.
Tops on the steer clear list are
the Osmond Brothers' "Down By
The Lazy River" (MGM) and the
Supremes' "Floy Joy" (Motown),
which is their worst song in years.
Oddity of the Month: a year or
so back, we had Miguel Rios
putting words to Beethovens
"Ode to Joy," with moderate
success. Now, a group called
Apollo 100 has done an |
instrumental version with Moog
synthesizer of Bach's "Joy"
(Mega). Johann Sebastian,
Superstar?

"Jamming with Edward/" Mick
Jagger, Nicky Hopkins, Bill
Wyman, Ry Cooder, Charlie
Watts, Rolling Stones Records
COC 39100.
There's just no excuse for this
record. It's so pitiably poor that
the five "artists" whose names are
displayed so prominently on the
cover must be ashamed. If they're
not, they should be.
This album is a jam session that
was taped during the recording of
"Let It Bleed" in 1969, which the
Rolling Stones are just getting
around to releasing at a discount
($3.98 list) rate. Unfortunately,
this record is a rip-off at half the
price.
It's hard to pinpoint exactly
what's wrong with this record.
With so much talent in evidence,
as witness Hopkins' superb
keyboard performance and
Cooder's imaginative guitar work,
it deserves a better fate than it
got.
The fault, surprisingly enough,
seems to be with the three Stones,
most particularly drummer Watts
and vocalist Jagger. Mick just does
not operate well in a jamming
situation: he seems to need a
polished set of lyrics that he can
experiment with, as is the
situation with most of the Stones
songs. The sort of situation he
found himself in with "Jamming
with Edward!" was virtually a
make-it-up-as-you-go-along deal.
And the usually excellent Watts
just sounds bored by the whole
thing.
Long Waits
Simon and Garfunkel were
frequently the target of criticism
because it took them seemingly
ages to produce a new album—it

was a year and a half between
"Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and
Thyme" and "Bookends," and
another year and a half until
"Bridge Over Troubled Water."
But what is overlooked is that the
Stones are just as slow. "Beggar's
Banquet" was released in
mid-1968; their next new album,
"Let It Bleed," in late 1969; and
their newest studio album,
"Sticky Fingers," in mid-1971.
The difference between the
oft-criticized S&G and the Stones
is that in the period since
"Beggar's Banquet," the Stones
have released four, count 'em,
greatest-hits and/or live albums:
'Through the Past Darkly
(Greatest Hits Volume 2)," "Get
YerYa-Yas Out," "Hot Rocks
1964-1971", and now "Jamming
with Edward!"
That's called saturating the
market. But if they run out of
good material, that's still no
reason to perpetrate "Jamming"
on us. No excuse at all.

"Sittin' In," Kenny Loggins and
Jim Messina. Columbia C 31044.
This is a pretty good album,
but certainly nothing to write
home about. It's primary fixtures
are Kenny Loggins, composer of
the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's
"House at Pooh Corner" (which is
included here), and Jim Messina,
formerly with Poco and before
that with Buffalo Springfield, who
wrote many of the songs,
produced, played lead guitar, and
sings on this album.
The album is basically pretty
bland, which in itself places it

above other releases in that it is
not actively revolting. It's
basically good-timey music that is
for the most part unobtrusive but
pleasant.
Chief flaw on the album is
Loggins' voice, which somewhat
resembles David Crosby's voice on
the Crosby, 'Stills and Nash studio
version of "Long Time Comin'."
However, where Crosby can alter
his voice for different songs,
Loggins always sounds virtually
the same.
The only song on which he
really shines is "The House at
Pooh Corner,'' which is kind of
loosely based on A.A. Milne's
children's tales. It is a marvelous,
gentle, wry song, and Loggins'
version is far superior to the Nitty
Gritty Dirt Band's.
Universally Good
Otherwise, "Sittin' In" is
proudcer/singer/writer Messina's
album. Since splitting from Poco,
this is his first venture, and his
songs on this record are almost
universally good.
His good, clean vocal style is at
its best on "Lovin' Me," but he
makes a substantial contribution
throughout the record.
His major flaw, however, is that
he is not a very good guitarist. In
Buffalo Springfield, he replaced
Bruce Palmer on bass, and
whatever talents he had on guitar
must surely have paled beside
those of Stephen Stills and Neil
Young. Here, he is competent at
best, and invisible at worst.
All told, "Sittin' In" is not
brilliant, but it has its moments.
It's an enjoyable way to spend

Singles l n' Things
Don McLean's "American Pie"
(United Artists), which dominated
the singles charts for so long, has
finally been knocked out of the
number one spot, and will soon be
relegated to "solid gold" status.
According to KFRC, the usurper
was A 1 Green's "Let's Stay
Together" (Hi/London), which
only lasted a week at the top and
which was in turn dumped by
Nilsson's "Without You" (RCA),
a comfortable piece of schlock if
ever there was.
McLean meanwhile has been
unable to produce a follow-up
single after the fantastc success of
his first. Both "Vincent" and
Winter Wood" from his album
have received airplay, but neither
are tremendously good.
A novelty record with all the
appeal of Daddy Dewdrop's
"Chick-a-boom" is "Jungle Fever"
(Polydor) by Chakachas. Needless
to say, it has no rhyme or reason,
is totally senseless and ridiculous,
and is well on its way to becoming
a huge hit. So it goes.

Neil Young's "Heart of Gold"
(Reprise) from his forth-coming
"Harvest" Ip is one of the fastest
rising singles on the charts. It is
much better than Young's last 45,
"Only Love Can Break Your
Heart," and if it is any indication,
the album should be a real treat.
Boring Ways
After a brilliant single in
"Everybody's Everything,"
Santana has reverted to its old
boring ways with "No One to
Depend On" (Columbia), which
soudns like "Oye Como Va,"
which sounds like "Jingo," which
sounds like "Evil Ways," which
sounds like. . . .
After her unwarranted success
with "Brand New Key," Melanie
Safka is trying "Ring the Living
Bell" (Neighborhood) as a
follow-up. The newer song is an

"Jamming with Edward/" Mick
Jagger, Nicky Hopkins, Bill
Wyman, Ry Cooder, Charlie
Watts, Rolling Stones Records
COC 39100.
There's just no excuse for this
record. It's so pitiably poor that
the five "artists" whose names are
displayed so prominently on the
cover must be ashamed. If they're
not, they should be.
This album is a jam session that
was taped during the recording of
"Let It Bleed" in 1969, which the
Rolling Stones are just getting
around to releasing at a discount
($3.98 list) rate. Unfortunately,
this record is a rip-off at half the
price.
It's hard to pinpoint exactly
what's wrong with this record.
With so much talent in evidence,
as witness Hopkins' superb
keyboard performance and
Cooder's imaginative guitar work,
it deserves a better fate than it
got.
The fault, surprisingly enough,
seems to be with the three Stones,
most particularly drummer Watts
and vocalist Jagger. Mick just does
not operate well in a jamming
situation: he seems to need a
polished set of lyrics that he can
experiment with, as is the
situation with most of the Stones
songs. The sort of situation he
found himself in with "Jamming
with Edward!" was virtually a
make-it-up-as-you-go-along deal.
And the usually excellent Watts
just sounds bored by the whole
thing.
Long Waits
Simon and Garfunkel were
frequently the target of criticism
because it took them seemingly
ages to produce a new album—it

was a year and a half between
"Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and
Thyme" and "Bookends," and
another year and a half until
"Bridge Over Troubled Water."
But what is overlooked is that the
Stones are just as slow. "Beggar's
Banquet" was released in
mid-1968; their next new album,
"Let It Bleed," in late 1969; and
their newest studio album,
"Sticky Fingers," in mid-1971.
The difference between the
oft-criticized S&G and the Stones
is that in the period since
"Beggar's Banquet," the Stones
have released four, count 'em,
greatest-hits and/or live albums:
'Through the Past Darkly
(Greatest Hits Volume 2)," "Get
YerYa-Yas Out," "Hot Rocks
1964-1971", and now "Jamming
with Edward!"
That's called saturating the

good material, that's still no

"Sittin' In," Kenny Loggins and
Jim Messina. Columbia C 31044.
This is a pretty good album,
but certainly nothing to write
home about. It's primary fixtures
are Kenny Loggins, composer of
the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's
"House at Pooh Corner" (which is
included here), and Jim Messina,
formerly with Poco and before
that with Buffalo Springfield, who
wrote many of the songs,
produced, played lead guitar, and
sings on this album.
The album is basically pretty
bland, which in itself places it

above other releases in that it is
not actively revolting. It's
basically good-timey music that is
for the most part unobtrusive but
pleasant.
Chief flaw on the album is
Loggins' voice, which somewhat
resembles David Crosby's voice on
the Crosby, 'Stills and Nash studio
version of "Long Time Comin'."
However, where Crosby can alter
his voice for different songs,
Loggins always sounds virtually
the same.
The only song on which he
really shines is "The House at
Pooh Corner,'' which is kind of
loosely based on A.A. Milne's
children's tales. It is a marvelous,
gentle, wry song, and Loggins'
version is far superior to the Nitty
Gritty Dirt Band's.
Universally Good
Otherwise, "Sittin' In" is
proudcer/singer/writer Messina's
album. Since splitting from Poco,
this is his first venture, and his
songs on this record are almost
universally good.
His good, clean vocal style is at
its best on "Lovin' Me," but he
makes a substantial contribution
throughout the record.
His major flaw, however, is that
he is not a very good guitarist. In
Buffalo Springfield, he replaced
Bruce Palmer on bass, and
whatever talents he had on guitar
must surely have paled beside
those of Stephen Stills and Neil
Young. Here, he is competent at
best, and invisible at worst.
All told, "Sittin' In" is not
brilliant, but it has its moments.
It's an enjoyable way to spend
three and a half bucks.

proudcer/singer/writer Messina's
album. Since splitting from Poco,
this is his first venture, and his
songs on this record are almost
universally good.
His good, clean vocal style is at
its best on "Lovin' Me," but he
makes a substantial contribution
throughout the record.
His major flaw, however, is that
he is not a very good guitarist. In
Buffalo Springfield, he replaced
Bruce Palmer on bass, and
whatever talents he had on guitar
must surely have paled beside
those of Stephen Stills and Neil
Young. Here, he is competent at
best, and invisible at worst.
All told, "Sittin' In" is not
brilliant, but it has its moments.
It's an enjoyable way to spend
three and a half bucks.

Singles l n' Things
Don McLean's "American Pie"
(United Artists), which dominated
the singles charts for so long, has
finally been knocked out of the
number one spot, and will soon be
relegated to "solid gold" status.
According to KFRC, the usurper
was A 1 Green's "Let's Stay
Together" (Hi/London), which
only lasted a week at the top and
which was in turn dumped by
Nilsson's "Without You" (RCA),
a comfortable piece of schlock if
ever there was.
McLean meanwhile has been
unable to produce a follow-up
single after the fantastc success of
his first. Both "Vincent" and
Winter Wood" from his album
have received airplay, but neither
are tremendously good.
A novelty record with all the
appeal of Daddy Dewdrop's
"Chick-a-boom" is "Jungle Fever"
(Polydor) by Chakachas. Needless
to say, it has no rhyme or reason,
is totally senseless and ridiculous,
and is well on its way to becoming
a huge hit. So it goes.

Neil Young's "Heart of Gold"
(Reprise) from his forth-coming
"Harvest" Ip is one of the fastest
rising singles on the charts. It is
much better than Young's last 45,
"Only Love Can Break Your
Heart," and if it is any indication,
the album should be a real treat.
Boring Ways
After a brilliant single in
"Everybody's Everything,"
Santana has reverted to its old
boring ways with "No One to
Depend On" (Columbia), which
soudns like "Oye Como Va,"
which sounds like "Jingo," which
sounds like "Evil Ways," which
sounds like. . . .
After her unwarranted success
with "Brand New Key," Melanie
Safka is trying "Ring the Living
Bell" (Neighborhood) as a
follow-up. The newer song is an
improvement over the first, but
won't be nearly as big a hit.
After years of success in Britain
and failure in the U.S., T. Rex
finally has an American hit with
"Bang a Gong" (Reprise), while
Three Dog Night and Bread both
continue their lengthy win streaks

with, respectively, "Never Been to
Spain" (Dunhill) and "Everything
I Own" (Elektra).
Robert John is hitting big with
his faithful remake of the old
Tokens hit "The Lion Sleeps
Tonight" (Atlantic), while Paul
Simon has a sure thing in "Mother
and Child Reuinion" (Columbia..
Fascinating Song
The best new song on the
charts is America's "A Horse with
No Name" (Reprise), which is a
fascinating song more than faintly
reminiscent of Neil Young.
Tops on the steer clear list are
the Osmond Brothers' "Down By
The Lazy River" (MGM) and the
Supremes' "Floy Joy" (Motown),
which is their worst song in years.
Oddity of the Month: a year or
so back, we had Miguel Rios
putting words to Beethovens
"Ode to Joy," with moderate
success. Now, a group called
Apollo 100 has done an |
instrumental version with Moog
synthesizer of Bach's "Joy"
(Mega). Johann Sebastian,
Superstar?

"Jamming with Edward/" Mick
Jagger, Nicky Hopkins, Bill
Wyman, Ry Cooder, Charlie
Watts, Rolling Stones Records
COC 39100.
There's just no excuse for this
record. It's so pitiably poor that
the five "artists" whose names are
displayed so prominently on the
cover must be ashamed. If they're
not, they should be.
This album is a jam session that
was taped during the recording of
"Let It Bleed" in 1969, which the
Rolling Stones are just getting
around to releasing at a discount
($3.98 list) rate. Unfortunately,
this record is a rip-off at half the
price.
It's hard to pinpoint exactly
what's wrong with this record.
With so much talent in evidence,
as witness Hopkins' superb
keyboard performance and
Cooder's imaginative guitar work,
it deserves a better fate than it
got.
The fault, surprisingly enough,
seems to be with the three Stones,
most particularly drummer Watts
and vocalist Jagger. Mick just does
not operate well in a jamming
situation: he seems to need a
polished set of lyrics that he can
experiment with, as is the
situation with most of the Stones
songs. The sort of situation he
found himself in with "Jamming
with Edward!" was virtually a
make-it-up-as-you-go-along deal.
And the usually excellent Watts
just sounds bored by the whole
thing.
Long Waits
Simon and Garfunkel were
frequently the target of criticism
because it took them seemingly
ages to produce a new album—it

was a year and a half between
"Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and
Thyme" and "Bookends," and
another year and a half until
"Bridge Over Troubled Water."
But what is overlooked is that the
Stones are just as slow. "Beggar's
Banquet" was released in
mid-1968; their next new album,
"Let It Bleed," in late 1969; and
their newest studio album,
"Sticky Fingers," in mid-1971.
The difference between the
oft-criticized S&G and the Stones
is that in the period since
"Beggar's Banquet," the Stones
have released four, count 'em,
greatest-hits and/or live albums:
'Through the Past Darkly
(Greatest Hits Volume 2)," "Get
YerYa-Yas Out," "Hot Rocks
1964-1971", and now "Jamming
with Edward!"
That's called saturating the
market. But if they run out of
good material, that's still no
reason to perpetrate "Jamming"
on us. No excuse at all.

"Sittin' In," Kenny Loggins and
Jim Messina. Columbia C 31044.
This is a pretty good album,
but certainly nothing to write
home about. It's primary fixtures
are Kenny Loggins, composer of
the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's
"House at Pooh Corner" (which is
included here), and Jim Messina,
formerly with Poco and before
that with Buffalo Springfield, who
wrote many of the songs,
produced, played lead guitar, and
sings on this album.
The album is basically pretty
bland, which in itself places it

above other releases in that it is
not actively revolting. It's
basically good-timey music that is
for the most part unobtrusive but
pleasant.
Chief flaw on the album is
Loggins' voice, which somewhat
resembles David Crosby's voice on
the Crosby, 'Stills and Nash studio
version of "Long Time Comin'."
However, where Crosby can alter
his voice for different songs,
Loggins always sounds virtually
the same.
The only song on which he
really shines is "The House at
Pooh Corner,'' which is kind of
loosely based on A.A. Milne's
children's tales. It is a marvelous,
gentle, wry song, and Loggins'
version is far superior to the Nitty
Gritty Dirt Band's.
Universally Good
Otherwise, "Sittin' In" is
proudcer/singer/writer Messina's
album. Since splitting from Poco,
this is his first venture, and his
songs on this record are almost

His good, clean vocal style is at
its best on "Lovin' Me," but he
makes a substantial contribution
throughout the record.
His major flaw, however, is that
he is not a very good guitarist. In
Buffalo Springfield, he replaced
Bruce Palmer on bass, and
whatever talents he had on guitar
must surely have paled beside
those of Stephen Stills and Neil
Young. Here, he is competent at
best, and invisible at worst.
All told, "Sittin' In" is not
brilliant, but it has its moments.
It's an enjoyable way to spend
