# Women's Studies Gain New Variety, Popularity
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
The number of courses offered primarily about women
has increased from virtually none three years ago to about
tv/enty this year.
In addition to the formal University courses, about
twenty courses ranging from "Home Repair," to "Images
of Women in Modern Literature," are offered each quarter
without credit by the Women's Center, an independent
coalition of campus women's groups sponsored by the
YWCA.
The women's courses being offered this quarter by the
University include the following:
—Women in America, taught by Carl Degler,
enrollment of 8 women and 5 men.
—Seminar on Sex Roles and the Psychology of Women,
Sandra Bern, 5 women, 2 men
—Prostitution, Margot McNiel, 17 women, 8 men
—Women in the Middle Ages, Penny Gold, 8 women, 3
men
—Life and Love in Ancient Rome, Mason Blacher, 6
women, 17 men
Approximately the same number of women's courses
are taught in the autumn and spring quarters, but the
selection is expanding and changing rapidly, so no
complete list of courses can be made.
So far, there is no co-ordination of courses from one
department to the next. Most of the courses have arisen
because individual departments felt a growing interest in
this area. Large enrollments have supported these courses
offered, but often the number of students is limited to
allow a discussion format.
In the anthropology department six female graduate
students last spring initiated and conducted a popular
lecture course called "The Position of Women in
Cross-Cultural Perspective." The course drew about 100
women and 25 men.
When the psychology department for the first time this
fall offered a course called "Psychology of Sex Roles,"

236 students, predominantly women, enrolled. In the
English department Ann Mellor recently initiated a course
called "Women In Literature."
History department Professor Carl Degler is teaching a
course called "Women in America," for the first time this
quarter. In the past he has taught a course called "Race
and Sex in America," which compared the situation of
blacks in this country to that of women, but he felt that
most interest was in the women aspect this year, and he
concentrated on that part.
Although Degler teaches his class as a seminar, and
consequently limits its enrollment to 15, over 50 students
signed up trying to get in this quarter. Those who were
able to take the class almost universally are finding it one
of the most relevant courses they have taken at Stanford.
"This class has affected nearly every aspect of my life,"
explained junior Patti Barnett. "It's sort of grueling in a
sense. I'm finally looking at what a woman really is."
"It's a unique class," says Jan Gritlefeld, "No one ever
taught you this in high school, or other college courses."
One reason it is so exceptional, according to Jane Gillett,
is that "the subject matter touches very close to the core
of your being."
Degler, however, says that he tries to emphasize the
course's academic aspects. "It's primarily an intellectual
operation, with emotional overtones," he said.
Degler assigns an average of two books per week which
are discussed thoroughly in the two hour class period
Wednesday afternoons. "It's a very disciplined study,"
said Brent Appel, a senior and one of the five men in the
class. "It really has a lot of substance to it."
"I don't shy away from sensitive areas such as female
and male sexuality," said Degler, "but on the other hand I
don't encourage these gut reactions."
Another course taking a historical look at women is
"Women in the Middle Ages," taught by history graduate
student Penny Gold. "The woman is put in perspective of
Middle Age politics, economics, and art," she explained.

"We don't talk too much about the contempoary
situation, but you make the connections anyway. People
don't know that much about the Middle Ages, so we have
to spend most of our time on that. Studying history does
seem to raise consciousness, however, or to put it in a less
jargonistic way of talking, it increases understanding."
Sue Campbell, a junior in Gold's class, says"It is
fantastic. It really has made me see the ramifications of
the position of women in the Middle ages to where we are
today. Courtly love, for example, put women on a
pedistal. We still have the influence of that ideology of the
Knights — the woman is not just a lover, but the
embodiment of perfection, purity and virginity."
"Life and Love in Ancient Rome" is a classics
department course taught for the second time by classics
graduate student Mason Blacher. The course looks at the
role of women through each stage of Roman history.
Reading assignments average one short book each week,
and classes are about 25 percent lecture and 75 percent
discussion.
He is presently working on preparations for another
course to be entitled "Life and Love in Ancient Greece."
"There is a lot of entertaining dirty literature around in
the classics, and there is no good reason why people aren't
reading it," Blacher said.
Another women's course this quarter deals with the
subject "Prostitution." "The first problem is that of
definition," according to teacher Margot McNeil. "What's
the difference between a prostitute who gets paid a lot of
money, and a wife who doesn't get paid, but has to do
housework and take care of her husband?"
Though there is no formal program in women's studies,
two students, Pam Cowan and Debbie Streeter, have
incorporated the discipline into their regular University
programs — Cowan in "Modern Thought and Literature,"
and Streeter in the Humanities Honors Program.
Streeter, a junior, says she designed the
interdepartmental major because "I was really bored with
the traditional majors." A supporter of women's
liberation, she said, "I went into the program with my
ideas about women pretty solid, but I have been made
aware of many more aspects. I've found the courses very

helpful in talking to people about it."
Generalizing on her experience in women's courses so
far, she finds "It's a very emotional subject. In almost
every class the students get very emotionally involved, and
often people end up with a lot of hard feelings. The
professors don't always handle it very well, but even more
of a problem are the guys and girls who become very
defensive."
"It's hard to talk about a subject which hits very close
to home, and there can be clashes between the students. A
guy, for example, might say 'come on, don't you think
you're getting a bit ridiculous,' and communications begin
to break down."
One of the problems Streeter sees is that there are so
few women teachers. "You get in a course like 'Human
Sexuality,' where there are no women teaching, and a man
gets up there and presumes to tell you what a woman's
orgasm is like."
Cowan also took many of the women's courses, but
now is more interested in taking courses preparing herself
for law school. "A lot of people are interested in women's
studies, and I think the courses are good, but I don't
think it's a good subject to major in," she said. "I think
women have to get somewhere, and that you need a
background like law or medicine. You don't get that from
women's studies."
"Of course, when I took the courses I thought they
were very good. I was very emotionally involved, and the
insights I got were really valuable."
Cowan agrees that her consciousness was raised by the
courses. She feels that Stanford's women's movement is
"a really good thing. A lot more has to be done, though,
and I want to see what happens when women leave here
and are forced to deal with having to get jobs."
Serving as a student member of the University
committee on Education and Employment at Stanford,
Cowan finds the recently publicized affirmative action
program for women not all that encouraging. "I think
they're doing it because someone is breathing down their
neck. Nobody is really gung-ho, and it's going to be a
really tedious, slow process."

University include the following:
—Women in America, taught by Carl Degler,
enrollment of 8 women and 5 men.
—Seminar on Sex Roles and the Psychology of Women,
Sandra Bern, 5 women, 2 men
—Prostitution, Margot McNiel, 17 women, 8 men
—Women in the Middle Ages, Penny Gold, 8 women, 3
men
—Life and Love in Ancient Rome, Mason Blacher, 6
women, 17 men
Approximately the same number of women's courses
are taught in the autumn and spring quarters, but the
selection is expanding and changing rapidly, so no
complete list of courses can be made.
So far, there is no co-ordination of courses from one
department to the next. Most of the courses have arisen
because individual departments felt a growing interest in
this area. Large enrollments have supported these courses
offered, but often the number of students is limited to
allow a discussion format.
In the anthropology department six female graduate
students last spring initiated and conducted a popular
lecture course called "The Position of Women in
Cross-Cultural Perspective." The course drew about 100
women and 25 men.
When the psychology department for the first time this
fall offered a course called "Psychology of Sex Roles,"

236 students, predominantly women, enrolled. In the
English department Ann Mellor recently initiated a course
called "Women In Literature."
History department Professor Carl Degler is teaching a
course called "Women in America," for the first time this
quarter. In the past he has taught a course called "Race
and Sex in America," which compared the situation of
blacks in this country to that of women, but he felt that
most interest was in the women aspect this year, and he
concentrated on that part.
Although Degler teaches his class as a seminar, and
consequently limits its enrollment to 15, over 50 students
signed up trying to get in this quarter. Those who were
able to take the class almost universally are finding it one
of the most relevant courses they have taken at Stanford.
"This class has affected nearly every aspect of my life,"
explained junior Patti Barnett. "It's sort of grueling in a
sense. I'm finally looking at what a woman really is."
"It's a unique class," says Jan Gritlefeld, "No one ever
taught you this in high school, or other college courses."
One reason it is so exceptional, according to Jane Gillett,
is that "the subject matter touches very close to the core
of your being."
Degler, however, says that he tries to emphasize the
course's academic aspects. "It's primarily an intellectual
operation, with emotional overtones," he said.
Degler assigns an average of two books per week which
are discussed thoroughly in the two hour class period
Wednesday afternoons. "It's a very disciplined study,"
said Brent Appel, a senior and one of the five men in the
class. "It really has a lot of substance to it."
"I don't shy away from sensitive areas such as female
and male sexuality," said Degler, "but on the other hand I
don't encourage these gut reactions."
Another course taking a historical look at women is
"Women in the Middle Ages," taught by history graduate
student Penny Gold. "The woman is put in perspective of
Middle Age politics, economics, and art," she explained.

"We don't talk too much about the contempoary
situation, but you make the connections anyway. People
don't know that much about the Middle Ages, so we have
to spend most of our time on that. Studying history does
seem to raise consciousness, however, or to put it in a less
jargonistic way of talking, it increases understanding."
Sue Campbell, a junior in Gold's class, says"It is
fantastic. It really has made me see the ramifications of
the position of women in the Middle ages to where we are
today. Courtly love, for example, put women on a
pedistal. We still have the influence of that ideology of the
Knights — the woman is not just a lover, but the
embodiment of perfection, purity and virginity."
"Life and Love in Ancient Rome" is a classics
department course taught for the second time by classics
graduate student Mason Blacher. The course looks at the
role of women through each stage of Roman history.
Reading assignments average one short book each week,
and classes are about 25 percent lecture and 75 percent
discussion.
He is presently working on preparations for another
course to be entitled "Life and Love in Ancient Greece."
"There is a lot of entertaining dirty literature around in
the classics, and there is no good reason why people aren't
reading it," Blacher said.
Another women's course this quarter deals with the
subject "Prostitution." "The first problem is that of
definition," according to teacher Margot McNeil. "What's
the difference between a prostitute who gets paid a lot of
money, and a wife who doesn't get paid, but has to do
housework and take care of her husband?"
Though there is no formal program in women's studies,
two students, Pam Cowan and Debbie Streeter, have
incorporated the discipline into their regular University
programs — Cowan in "Modern Thought and Literature,"
and Streeter in the Humanities Honors Program.
Streeter, a junior, says she designed the
interdepartmental major because "I was really bored with
the traditional majors." A supporter of women's
liberation, she said, "I went into the program with my
ideas about women pretty solid, but I have been made
aware of many more aspects. I've found the courses very

helpful in talking to people about it."
Generalizing on her experience in women's courses so
far, she finds "It's a very emotional subject. In almost
every class the students get very emotionally involved, and
often people end up with a lot of hard feelings. The
professors don't always handle it very well, but even more
of a problem are the guys and girls who become very
defensive."
"It's hard to talk about a subject which hits very close
to home, and there can be clashes between the students. A
guy, for example, might say 'come on, don't you think
you're getting a bit ridiculous,' and communications begin
to break down."
One of the problems Streeter sees is that there are so
few women teachers. "You get in a course like 'Human
Sexuality,' where there are no women teaching, and a man
gets up there and presumes to tell you what a woman's
orgasm is like."
Cowan also took many of the women's courses, but
now is more interested in taking courses preparing herself
for law school. "A lot of people are interested in women's
studies, and I think the courses are good, but I don't
think it's a good subject to major in," she said. "I think
women have to get somewhere, and that you need a
background like law or medicine. You don't get that from
women's studies."
"Of course, when I took the courses I thought they
were very good. I was very emotionally involved, and the
insights I got were really valuable."
Cowan agrees that her consciousness was raised by the
courses. She feels that Stanford's women's movement is
"a really good thing. A lot more has to be done, though,
and I want to see what happens when women leave here
and are forced to deal with having to get jobs."
Serving as a student member of the University
committee on Education and Employment at Stanford,
Cowan finds the recently publicized affirmative action
program for women not all that encouraging. "I think
they're doing it because someone is breathing down their
neck. Nobody is really gung-ho, and it's going to be a
really tedious, slow process."
The number of courses offered primarily about women
has increased from virtually none three years ago to about
tv/enty this year.
In addition to the formal University courses, about
twenty courses ranging from "Home Repair," to "Images
of Women in Modern Literature," are offered each quarter
without credit by the Women's Center, an independent
coalition of campus women's groups sponsored by the
YWCA.

Approximately the same number of women's courses
are taught in the autumn and spring quarters, but the
selection is expanding and changing rapidly, so no
complete list of courses can be made.
So far, there is no co-ordination of courses from one
department to the next. Most of the courses have arisen
because individual departments felt a growing interest in
this area. Large enrollments have supported these courses
offered, but often the number of students is limited to
allow a discussion format.
In the anthropology department six female graduate
students last spring initiated and conducted a popular
lecture course called "The Position of Women in
Cross-Cultural Perspective." The course drew about 100
women and 25 men.
When the psychology department for the first time this
fall offered a course called "Psychology of Sex Roles,"

236 students, predominantly women, enrolled. In the
English department Ann Mellor recently initiated a course
called "Women In Literature."
History department Professor Carl Degler is teaching a
course called "Women in America," for the first time this
quarter. In the past he has taught a course called "Race
and Sex in America," which compared the situation of
blacks in this country to that of women, but he felt that
most interest was in the women aspect this year, and he
concentrated on that part.
Although Degler teaches his class as a seminar, and
consequently limits its enrollment to 15, over 50 students
signed up trying to get in this quarter. Those who were
able to take the class almost universally are finding it one
of the most relevant courses they have taken at Stanford.
"This class has affected nearly every aspect of my life,"
explained junior Patti Barnett. "It's sort of grueling in a
sense. I'm finally looking at what a woman really is."
"It's a unique class," says Jan Gritlefeld, "No one ever
taught you this in high school, or other college courses."
One reason it is so exceptional, according to Jane Gillett,
is that "the subject matter touches very close to the core
of your being."
Degler, however, says that he tries to emphasize the
course's academic aspects. "It's primarily an intellectual
operation, with emotional overtones," he said.
Degler assigns an average of two books per week which
are discussed thoroughly in the two hour class period
Wednesday afternoons. "It's a very disciplined study,"
said Brent Appel, a senior and one of the five men in the
class. "It really has a lot of substance to it."
"I don't shy away from sensitive areas such as female
and male sexuality," said Degler, "but on the other hand I
don't encourage these gut reactions."
Another course taking a historical look at women is
"Women in the Middle Ages," taught by history graduate
student Penny Gold. "The woman is put in perspective of
Middle Age politics, economics, and art," she explained.

"We don't talk too much about the contempoary
situation, but you make the connections anyway. People
don't know that much about the Middle Ages, so we have
to spend most of our time on that. Studying history does
seem to raise consciousness, however, or to put it in a less
jargonistic way of talking, it increases understanding."
Sue Campbell, a junior in Gold's class, says"It is
fantastic. It really has made me see the ramifications of
the position of women in the Middle ages to where we are
today. Courtly love, for example, put women on a
pedistal. We still have the influence of that ideology of the
Knights — the woman is not just a lover, but the
embodiment of perfection, purity and virginity."
"Life and Love in Ancient Rome" is a classics
department course taught for the second time by classics
graduate student Mason Blacher. The course looks at the
role of women through each stage of Roman history.
Reading assignments average one short book each week,
and classes are about 25 percent lecture and 75 percent
discussion.
He is presently working on preparations for another
course to be entitled "Life and Love in Ancient Greece."
"There is a lot of entertaining dirty literature around in
the classics, and there is no good reason why people aren't
reading it," Blacher said.
Another women's course this quarter deals with the
subject "Prostitution." "The first problem is that of
definition," according to teacher Margot McNeil. "What's
the difference between a prostitute who gets paid a lot of
money, and a wife who doesn't get paid, but has to do
housework and take care of her husband?"
Though there is no formal program in women's studies,
two students, Pam Cowan and Debbie Streeter, have
incorporated the discipline into their regular University
programs — Cowan in "Modern Thought and Literature,"
and Streeter in the Humanities Honors Program.
Streeter, a junior, says she designed the
interdepartmental major because "I was really bored with
the traditional majors." A supporter of women's
liberation, she said, "I went into the program with my
ideas about women pretty solid, but I have been made
aware of many more aspects. I've found the courses very

helpful in talking to people about it."
Generalizing on her experience in women's courses so
far, she finds "It's a very emotional subject. In almost
every class the students get very emotionally involved, and
often people end up with a lot of hard feelings. The
professors don't always handle it very well, but even more
of a problem are the guys and girls who become very
defensive."
"It's hard to talk about a subject which hits very close
to home, and there can be clashes between the students. A
guy, for example, might say 'come on, don't you think
you're getting a bit ridiculous,' and communications begin
to break down."
One of the problems Streeter sees is that there are so
few women teachers. "You get in a course like 'Human
Sexuality,' where there are no women teaching, and a man
gets up there and presumes to tell you what a woman's
orgasm is like."
Cowan also took many of the women's courses, but
now is more interested in taking courses preparing herself
for law school. "A lot of people are interested in women's
studies, and I think the courses are good, but I don't
think it's a good subject to major in," she said. "I think
women have to get somewhere, and that you need a
background like law or medicine. You don't get that from
women's studies."
"Of course, when I took the courses I thought they
were very good. I was very emotionally involved, and the
insights I got were really valuable."
Cowan agrees that her consciousness was raised by the
courses. She feels that Stanford's women's movement is
"a really good thing. A lot more has to be done, though,
and I want to see what happens when women leave here
and are forced to deal with having to get jobs."
Serving as a student member of the University
committee on Education and Employment at Stanford,
Cowan finds the recently publicized affirmative action
program for women not all that encouraging. "I think
they're doing it because someone is breathing down their
neck. Nobody is really gung-ho, and it's going to be a
really tedious, slow process."
The number of courses offered primarily about women
has increased from virtually none three years ago to about
tv/enty this year.
In addition to the formal University courses, about
twenty courses ranging from "Home Repair," to "Images
of Women in Modern Literature," are offered each quarter
without credit by the Women's Center, an independent
coalition of campus women's groups sponsored by the
YWCA.
The women's courses being offered this quarter by the
University include the following:
—Women in America, taught by Carl Degler,
enrollment of 8 women and 5 men.
—Seminar on Sex Roles and the Psychology of Women,
Sandra Bern, 5 women, 2 men
—Prostitution, Margot McNiel, 17 women, 8 men
—Women in the Middle Ages, Penny Gold, 8 women, 3
men

allow a discussion format.
In the anthropology department six female graduate
students last spring initiated and conducted a popular
lecture course called "The Position of Women in
Cross-Cultural Perspective." The course drew about 100
women and 25 men.
When the psychology department for the first time this
fall offered a course called "Psychology of Sex Roles,"

236 students, predominantly women, enrolled. In the
English department Ann Mellor recently initiated a course
called "Women In Literature."
History department Professor Carl Degler is teaching a
course called "Women in America," for the first time this
quarter. In the past he has taught a course called "Race
and Sex in America," which compared the situation of
blacks in this country to that of women, but he felt that
most interest was in the women aspect this year, and he
concentrated on that part.
Although Degler teaches his class as a seminar, and
consequently limits its enrollment to 15, over 50 students
signed up trying to get in this quarter. Those who were
able to take the class almost universally are finding it one
of the most relevant courses they have taken at Stanford.
"This class has affected nearly every aspect of my life,"
explained junior Patti Barnett. "It's sort of grueling in a
sense. I'm finally looking at what a woman really is."
"It's a unique class," says Jan Gritlefeld, "No one ever
taught you this in high school, or other college courses."
One reason it is so exceptional, according to Jane Gillett,
is that "the subject matter touches very close to the core
of your being."
Degler, however, says that he tries to emphasize the
course's academic aspects. "It's primarily an intellectual
operation, with emotional overtones," he said.
Degler assigns an average of two books per week which
are discussed thoroughly in the two hour class period
Wednesday afternoons. "It's a very disciplined study,"
said Brent Appel, a senior and one of the five men in the
class. "It really has a lot of substance to it."
"I don't shy away from sensitive areas such as female
and male sexuality," said Degler, "but on the other hand I
don't encourage these gut reactions."
Another course taking a historical look at women is
"Women in the Middle Ages," taught by history graduate
student Penny Gold. "The woman is put in perspective of
Middle Age politics, economics, and art," she explained.

"We don't talk too much about the contempoary
situation, but you make the connections anyway. People
don't know that much about the Middle Ages, so we have
to spend most of our time on that. Studying history does
seem to raise consciousness, however, or to put it in a less
jargonistic way of talking, it increases understanding."
Sue Campbell, a junior in Gold's class, says"It is
fantastic. It really has made me see the ramifications of
the position of women in the Middle ages to where we are
today. Courtly love, for example, put women on a
pedistal. We still have the influence of that ideology of the
Knights — the woman is not just a lover, but the
embodiment of perfection, purity and virginity."
"Life and Love in Ancient Rome" is a classics
department course taught for the second time by classics
graduate student Mason Blacher. The course looks at the
role of women through each stage of Roman history.
Reading assignments average one short book each week,
and classes are about 25 percent lecture and 75 percent
discussion.
He is presently working on preparations for another
course to be entitled "Life and Love in Ancient Greece."
"There is a lot of entertaining dirty literature around in
the classics, and there is no good reason why people aren't
reading it," Blacher said.
Another women's course this quarter deals with the
subject "Prostitution." "The first problem is that of
definition," according to teacher Margot McNeil. "What's
the difference between a prostitute who gets paid a lot of
money, and a wife who doesn't get paid, but has to do
housework and take care of her husband?"
Though there is no formal program in women's studies,
two students, Pam Cowan and Debbie Streeter, have
incorporated the discipline into their regular University
programs — Cowan in "Modern Thought and Literature,"
and Streeter in the Humanities Honors Program.
Streeter, a junior, says she designed the
interdepartmental major because "I was really bored with
the traditional majors." A supporter of women's
liberation, she said, "I went into the program with my
ideas about women pretty solid, but I have been made
aware of many more aspects. I've found the courses very

helpful in talking to people about it."
Generalizing on her experience in women's courses so
far, she finds "It's a very emotional subject. In almost
every class the students get very emotionally involved, and
often people end up with a lot of hard feelings. The
professors don't always handle it very well, but even more
of a problem are the guys and girls who become very
defensive."
"It's hard to talk about a subject which hits very close
to home, and there can be clashes between the students. A
guy, for example, might say 'come on, don't you think
you're getting a bit ridiculous,' and communications begin
to break down."
One of the problems Streeter sees is that there are so
few women teachers. "You get in a course like 'Human
Sexuality,' where there are no women teaching, and a man
gets up there and presumes to tell you what a woman's
orgasm is like."
Cowan also took many of the women's courses, but
now is more interested in taking courses preparing herself
for law school. "A lot of people are interested in women's
studies, and I think the courses are good, but I don't
think it's a good subject to major in," she said. "I think
women have to get somewhere, and that you need a
background like law or medicine. You don't get that from
women's studies."
"Of course, when I took the courses I thought they
were very good. I was very emotionally involved, and the
insights I got were really valuable."
Cowan agrees that her consciousness was raised by the
courses. She feels that Stanford's women's movement is
"a really good thing. A lot more has to be done, though,
and I want to see what happens when women leave here
and are forced to deal with having to get jobs."
Serving as a student member of the University
committee on Education and Employment at Stanford,
Cowan finds the recently publicized affirmative action
program for women not all that encouraging. "I think
they're doing it because someone is breathing down their
neck. Nobody is really gung-ho, and it's going to be a
really tedious, slow process."
