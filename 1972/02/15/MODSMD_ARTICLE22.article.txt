Russian UN Employee Arrested
NEW YORK — A Russian United Nations employee was
arrested on Long Island last night on charges of espionage
in connection with the solicitation of classified documents
on the Navy's new FI4A fighter plane.
The arrest of Valery I. Markelov was disclosed in
Washington by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, and the FBI
in New York later said Markelov had been brought to the
city FBI office for further questioning.
At the Soviet mission to the United Nations, a
spokesman declined to comment on the arrest, saying the
mission would have to "study" the situation. He declined
to say whether Markelov was a Soviet citizen.
A spokesman for the FI4A contractor, Grumman
Aerospace Corp. of Bethpage, on Long Island, declined to
comment on the arrest.
'Cease-Fires' In Effect
SAIGON — Cease-fires for the Tet lunar new year
celebration were shattered by 35 Communist violations
across South Vietnam, the Saigon command claimed this
morning.
The Viet Cong cease-fire began at 1 a.m. Saigon time
yesterday, and an allied truce went into effect 17 hours
later. The Viet Cong truce, which is scheduled to run for
96 hours, expires at 1 a.m. Friday. The allied cease-fire is
for only 24 hours and runs out at 6 p.m. today.
While the allied cease-fire was in effect, the thrust of
the intensive U.S. bombing raids across South Vietnam
shifted to enemy supply lines in Laos.
The U.S. and South Vietnamese commands refused to
agree to the longer truce, saying the enemy would use the
cease-fire to infiltrate troops and supplies. In the weeks
leading up to Tet, allied officials said the enemy might
launch a major offensive during the holiday.
McGovern, Muskie Strong In Caucuses
LOS ANGELES — Sens. George McGovern of South
Dakota and Edmund S. Muskie of Maine appeared to be
"in a dead heat" in drawing California Democrats to a
series of grass roots party caucuses, it was reported
yesterday.
An incomplete tally of the caucuses held Saturday to
help select delegates to the Democratic National
Convention show that McGovern pulled more than 6,000
voters to 35 of the 43 sessions reporting. Muskie attracted
5,431 to 36 caucuses reporting.
McGovern's strength was seen as a surprise because
public opinion polls indicate he is well behind Muskie in
popular support. Muskie officials argued that the caucus
system was not a real test of popularity.
In all, more than 16,000 Democrats attended the
caucuses, according to the partial figures. The final figure
is expected to exceed 20,000. The caucuses were held in
compliance with a new state party reform law.
Strength also was displayed by Sen. Hubert H.
Humphrey, D-Minn., Rep. Shirley Chisholm, D-N.Y., and
New York Mayor John V. Lindsay.

Humphrey had a turnout of 1,478 at 33 caucuses
reporting, Chisholm 1,402 at 35, and Lindsay 1,279 at 35.
China Trade Barriers Lowered
WASHINGTON — President Nixon opened the door a bit
wider yesterday for trade with Communist China, putting
it on an equal footing with the Soviet Union. And the
White House announced a rough schedule of open-ended
talks with Chinese leaders during his visit to Peking.
The President leaves for China Thursday, and will
arrive Monday.
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said the
"across-the-board parity" in trade regulations for
Communist China with the Soviet Union and Eastern
European countries will permit the flow of a larger
number of non-strategic products into China.
Under the new regulations, China will be able to
import a long list of items previously banned including
such things as locomotives, construction equipment, a
variety of industrial chemicals, internal combustion
engines and rolling mills.
In general, there currently are no restrictions on
products China can send into the United States as a result
of an initial easing of trade rules by Nixon last June.
In further preparation for his China mission, Nixon
conferred yesterday with conservative Sen. James Buckley
of New York and with French intellectual Andre Malraux,
a longtime acquaintaince of various Chinese leaders.
A new communications satellite went into operation
yesterday 22,300 miles in space to carry television and
newspaper reports of Nixon's visit to China.
Nixon Promises Anti-Busing Aetion
WASHINGTON — President Nixon assured a group of
Congressmen yesterday he will try to offset the trend of
federal court decisions requiring widespread busing of
public-school children.
The chief executive did not commit himself to a
specific course on the explosive political issue, a White
House spokesman said.
But eight congressional sponsors of antibusing
legislation or constitutional amendments said after a
two-hour meeting with Nixon that the President made
clear he will take specific steps, perhaps as early as next
month.
Later, Roy Wilkins, executive director of the NAACP,
said of the meeting: "He ought to stay out of it
altogether. It's very unseemly for the President of the
United States to do this."
"He has no business calling together only the busing
opponents and asking 'What shall we do now?' in order to
hold back 22 million black people who have millions of
children in schools," Wilkins said in a Washington speech.
Three approaches were discussed — intervention by the
attorney general in more court cases, legislation to ban use
of federal funds for busing, or a constitutional
amendment to prohibit assigning a student to a particular
school because of his race.

opponents and asking 'What shall we do now?' in order to

Three approaches were discussed — intervention by the
attorney general in more court cases, legislation to ban use
of federal funds for busing, or a constitutional
amendment to prohibit assigning a student to a particular
school because of his race.
Russian UN Employee Arrested
NEW YORK — A Russian United Nations employee was
arrested on Long Island last night on charges of espionage
in connection with the solicitation of classified documents
on the Navy's new FI4A fighter plane.
The arrest of Valery I. Markelov was disclosed in
Washington by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, and the FBI
in New York later said Markelov had been brought to the
city FBI office for further questioning.
At the Soviet mission to the United Nations, a
spokesman declined to comment on the arrest, saying the
mission would have to "study" the situation. He declined
to say whether Markelov was a Soviet citizen.
A spokesman for the FI4A contractor, Grumman
Aerospace Corp. of Bethpage, on Long Island, declined to
comment on the arrest.
'Cease-Fires' In Effect
SAIGON — Cease-fires for the Tet lunar new year
celebration were shattered by 35 Communist violations
across South Vietnam, the Saigon command claimed this
morning.
The Viet Cong cease-fire began at 1 a.m. Saigon time
yesterday, and an allied truce went into effect 17 hours
later. The Viet Cong truce, which is scheduled to run for
96 hours, expires at 1 a.m. Friday. The allied cease-fire is
for only 24 hours and runs out at 6 p.m. today.
While the allied cease-fire was in effect, the thrust of
the intensive U.S. bombing raids across South Vietnam
shifted to enemy supply lines in Laos.
The U.S. and South Vietnamese commands refused to
agree to the longer truce, saying the enemy would use the
cease-fire to infiltrate troops and supplies. In the weeks
leading up to Tet, allied officials said the enemy might
launch a major offensive during the holiday.
McGovern, Muskie Strong In Caucuses
LOS ANGELES — Sens. George McGovern of South
Dakota and Edmund S. Muskie of Maine appeared to be
"in a dead heat" in drawing California Democrats to a
series of grass roots party caucuses, it was reported
yesterday.
An incomplete tally of the caucuses held Saturday to
help select delegates to the Democratic National
Convention show that McGovern pulled more than 6,000
voters to 35 of the 43 sessions reporting. Muskie attracted
5,431 to 36 caucuses reporting.
McGovern's strength was seen as a surprise because
public opinion polls indicate he is well behind Muskie in
popular support. Muskie officials argued that the caucus
system was not a real test of popularity.
In all, more than 16,000 Democrats attended the
caucuses, according to the partial figures. The final figure
is expected to exceed 20,000. The caucuses were held in
compliance with a new state party reform law.
Strength also was displayed by Sen. Hubert H.
Humphrey, D-Minn., Rep. Shirley Chisholm, D-N.Y., and
New York Mayor John V. Lindsay.

Humphrey had a turnout of 1,478 at 33 caucuses
reporting, Chisholm 1,402 at 35, and Lindsay 1,279 at 35.
China Trade Barriers Lowered
WASHINGTON — President Nixon opened the door a bit
wider yesterday for trade with Communist China, putting
it on an equal footing with the Soviet Union. And the
White House announced a rough schedule of open-ended
talks with Chinese leaders during his visit to Peking.
The President leaves for China Thursday, and will
arrive Monday.
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said the
"across-the-board parity" in trade regulations for
Communist China with the Soviet Union and Eastern
European countries will permit the flow of a larger
number of non-strategic products into China.
Under the new regulations, China will be able to
import a long list of items previously banned including
such things as locomotives, construction equipment, a
variety of industrial chemicals, internal combustion
engines and rolling mills.
In general, there currently are no restrictions on
products China can send into the United States as a result
of an initial easing of trade rules by Nixon last June.
In further preparation for his China mission, Nixon
conferred yesterday with conservative Sen. James Buckley
of New York and with French intellectual Andre Malraux,
a longtime acquaintaince of various Chinese leaders.
A new communications satellite went into operation
yesterday 22,300 miles in space to carry television and
newspaper reports of Nixon's visit to China.
Nixon Promises Anti-Busing Aetion
WASHINGTON — President Nixon assured a group of
Congressmen yesterday he will try to offset the trend of
federal court decisions requiring widespread busing of
public-school children.
The chief executive did not commit himself to a
specific course on the explosive political issue, a White
House spokesman said.
But eight congressional sponsors of antibusing
legislation or constitutional amendments said after a
two-hour meeting with Nixon that the President made
clear he will take specific steps, perhaps as early as next
month.
Later, Roy Wilkins, executive director of the NAACP,
said of the meeting: "He ought to stay out of it
altogether. It's very unseemly for the President of the
United States to do this."
"He has no business calling together only the busing
opponents and asking 'What shall we do now?' in order to
hold back 22 million black people who have millions of

clear he will take specific steps, perhaps as early as next
month.
Later, Roy Wilkins, executive director of the NAACP,
said of the meeting: "He ought to stay out of it
altogether. It's very unseemly for the President of the
United States to do this."
"He has no business calling together only the busing
opponents and asking 'What shall we do now?' in order to
hold back 22 million black people who have millions of
children in schools," Wilkins said in a Washington speech.
Three approaches were discussed — intervention by the
attorney general in more court cases, legislation to ban use
of federal funds for busing, or a constitutional
amendment to prohibit assigning a student to a particular
school because of his race.
Russian UN Employee Arrested
NEW YORK — A Russian United Nations employee was
arrested on Long Island last night on charges of espionage
in connection with the solicitation of classified documents
on the Navy's new FI4A fighter plane.
The arrest of Valery I. Markelov was disclosed in
Washington by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, and the FBI
in New York later said Markelov had been brought to the
city FBI office for further questioning.
At the Soviet mission to the United Nations, a
spokesman declined to comment on the arrest, saying the
mission would have to "study" the situation. He declined
to say whether Markelov was a Soviet citizen.
A spokesman for the FI4A contractor, Grumman
Aerospace Corp. of Bethpage, on Long Island, declined to
comment on the arrest.
'Cease-Fires' In Effect
SAIGON — Cease-fires for the Tet lunar new year
celebration were shattered by 35 Communist violations
across South Vietnam, the Saigon command claimed this
morning.
The Viet Cong cease-fire began at 1 a.m. Saigon time
yesterday, and an allied truce went into effect 17 hours
later. The Viet Cong truce, which is scheduled to run for
96 hours, expires at 1 a.m. Friday. The allied cease-fire is
for only 24 hours and runs out at 6 p.m. today.
While the allied cease-fire was in effect, the thrust of
the intensive U.S. bombing raids across South Vietnam
shifted to enemy supply lines in Laos.
The U.S. and South Vietnamese commands refused to
agree to the longer truce, saying the enemy would use the
cease-fire to infiltrate troops and supplies. In the weeks
leading up to Tet, allied officials said the enemy might
launch a major offensive during the holiday.
McGovern, Muskie Strong In Caucuses
LOS ANGELES — Sens. George McGovern of South
Dakota and Edmund S. Muskie of Maine appeared to be
"in a dead heat" in drawing California Democrats to a
series of grass roots party caucuses, it was reported
yesterday.
An incomplete tally of the caucuses held Saturday to
help select delegates to the Democratic National
Convention show that McGovern pulled more than 6,000
voters to 35 of the 43 sessions reporting. Muskie attracted
5,431 to 36 caucuses reporting.
McGovern's strength was seen as a surprise because
public opinion polls indicate he is well behind Muskie in
popular support. Muskie officials argued that the caucus
system was not a real test of popularity.
In all, more than 16,000 Democrats attended the
caucuses, according to the partial figures. The final figure
is expected to exceed 20,000. The caucuses were held in
compliance with a new state party reform law.
Strength also was displayed by Sen. Hubert H.
Humphrey, D-Minn., Rep. Shirley Chisholm, D-N.Y., and
New York Mayor John V. Lindsay.

Humphrey had a turnout of 1,478 at 33 caucuses
reporting, Chisholm 1,402 at 35, and Lindsay 1,279 at 35.
China Trade Barriers Lowered
WASHINGTON — President Nixon opened the door a bit
wider yesterday for trade with Communist China, putting
it on an equal footing with the Soviet Union. And the
White House announced a rough schedule of open-ended
talks with Chinese leaders during his visit to Peking.
The President leaves for China Thursday, and will
arrive Monday.
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said the
"across-the-board parity" in trade regulations for
Communist China with the Soviet Union and Eastern
European countries will permit the flow of a larger
number of non-strategic products into China.
Under the new regulations, China will be able to
import a long list of items previously banned including
such things as locomotives, construction equipment, a
variety of industrial chemicals, internal combustion
engines and rolling mills.
In general, there currently are no restrictions on
products China can send into the United States as a result
of an initial easing of trade rules by Nixon last June.
In further preparation for his China mission, Nixon
conferred yesterday with conservative Sen. James Buckley
of New York and with French intellectual Andre Malraux,
a longtime acquaintaince of various Chinese leaders.
A new communications satellite went into operation
yesterday 22,300 miles in space to carry television and
newspaper reports of Nixon's visit to China.
Nixon Promises Anti-Busing Aetion
WASHINGTON — President Nixon assured a group of
Congressmen yesterday he will try to offset the trend of
federal court decisions requiring widespread busing of
public-school children.
The chief executive did not commit himself to a
specific course on the explosive political issue, a White
House spokesman said.
But eight congressional sponsors of antibusing
legislation or constitutional amendments said after a
two-hour meeting with Nixon that the President made
clear he will take specific steps, perhaps as early as next
month.
Later, Roy Wilkins, executive director of the NAACP,
said of the meeting: "He ought to stay out of it
altogether. It's very unseemly for the President of the
United States to do this."
"He has no business calling together only the busing
opponents and asking 'What shall we do now?' in order to
hold back 22 million black people who have millions of
children in schools," Wilkins said in a Washington speech.
Three approaches were discussed — intervention by the
attorney general in more court cases, legislation to ban use
of federal funds for busing, or a constitutional
amendment to prohibit assigning a student to a particular
school because of his race.
