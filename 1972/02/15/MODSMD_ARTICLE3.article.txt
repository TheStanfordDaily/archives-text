# Faculty Starts One Day Fast
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
Members of the Faculty Political
Action Group (FPAG) held a
"non-lunch" at the Faculty Club
yesterday to start off a 24-hour
supportive fast.
The 17 faculty members were
demonstrating their support of the
demands issued Friday to President
Lyman by over 20 hunger strikers,
according to Professor Ray Giraud,

chairman of the French and Italian
Department.
The fasters filled two large tables
inside the faculty club. Small signs in
the middle of each table announced
their purpose, and the demonstrators
made a few more signs out of menus.
These signs did not seem visible to
the regular lunchers at the Club,
however. About 150 people ate their
noon meals in the dining room,

seemingly unaware of the events
transpiring nearby. The FPAG
members did not try to talk to the
diners.
At one point Faculty Club Director
Forrest Tregea informed the fasters
that they were occupying places which
normally accommodate eating
customers. He asked how many of
them were members of the club.
Associate Professor of History Hal
Kahn and Professor Giraud then asked
to see the rules of the Club. Tregea
informed them that they could "come
upstairs any time and see the rules."
When the professors continued to ask
to see the club rules, Tregea asked
Kahn if he was a member of the
Faculty Club.
Kahn answered, "I'm considering
joining, and I wouldn't want to join an
organization without seeing the rules."
Tregea injected, "I'm not sure
you're qualified to join."
"Let's settle this right now,"
retorted Kahn, and reached for his
wallet, apparently to show Tregea his
faculty I.D. card. Tregea, however,
walked away.
The protesters left the Faculty Club
quietly shortly before 1:00 p.m.
