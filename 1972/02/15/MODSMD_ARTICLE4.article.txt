# Moratorium Demands
## Lyman Meets Fasters 
### JON GRAY 
The second meeting between
President Richard Lyman and the
delegation led by David Josephson
representing about twenty fasters
ended yesterday morning with little
headway made, and no date set for
future negotiations.
For over an hour the ten-man
delegation sat around a large
conference table in the President's
office occasionally sipping orange juice
while debating their three demands
with President Lyman and Vice
Provost Rosenzweig.
According to Columbae
participants Lyman said no further
discussions with the group would be
productive.
Last Tuesday, forty-three began

fasting in support of three demands
that Lyman: (1) hold an open meeting
with the Stanford community, (2)
declare a moratorium on "war
recruiting" at the Placement Center,
and (3) impose a moratorium on
prosecutions through the Campus
Judicial Panel.
Lyman again denied the demands in
the discussion saying that "these
demands with the possible exception
of the open meeting... are not
negotiable."
"I can't say in thinking about this
that we have a little moratorium or a
medium sized moratorium or an
unlimited moratorium," continued
Lyman, "without it giving away the
principles that I believe are
important."
Since Tuesday the protesters have
met daily at noon in White Plaza to
share orange and carrot juice.
Over the week their numbers have
dwindled to about twenty. But
yesterday at a noon rally on White
Plaza, they called for members of the
community to show their support of
the demands by fasting with them for
twenty-four hours. The fasters also
called for renewed protests at the
Placement Center later on this week.
Day Fasters to Break Bread
Today at a noon rally on White
Plaza, those who plan to fast for only
a day will break bread together. A core
of the original fasters say they will
continue until Lyman accedes to their
demands.
Also at today's rally Dave
Josephson will announce a
telephone-letter campaign. He will ask
all members of the community to
either write or phone in their opinion
of the three demands to the
President's office.
Yesterday's meeting began with the
fasters asking Lyman whether he had
given any thought to the issues
covered at the last meeting — the
demands for an open meeting and a
moratorium on campus military
recruiting.
Lyman said he had particularly
done a lot of thinking about the

fasters because their tactics "are so
different from what Venceremos is
doing."
Lyman's reply to the demand that
he call a moratorium on the present
campus judicial proceeding was to
relate the history of the formation of
the present system.
"There was a kind of moratorium
in the judicial system for. . . seven or
eight months between the first request
and the rejection of that request next
spring from me to the ASSU senate,"
Lyman said.
He finally invoked the President's
emergency power to "set up a judicial
system which could cope" until a new
one could be arrived at through the
proper mechanism, the committee of
fifteen, which represents students,
faculty and administration.
Column Inaccurate
He stated that a column in a recent
Daily which related the history of the
judicial system was "grossly
inaccurate ... in that it at least
strongly suggested if it did not flatly
state that the Administration upon
having its request for student
cooperation for the ASSU turned
down, created its own arbitrary
system."
Lyman stated the Administration
waited until the new Senate had been
elected to give them a chance to
approve it. "We gave them a chance to
debate and vote on it,"he said, "but
they voted not to cooperate."
When Josephson questioned why
the ASSU should cooperate with the
Administration, Lyman pointed out
that the ASSU was not refusing to
work with the Administration, but
rather with the system which "the
student body had voted for."
"Only then did we move,"
continued Lyman.
Decision Making Process
The final discussion of the hour
centered around the decision-making
process of the University. "We're
simply asking that anyone that lives
under the system have a right to
participate in its formation," said
Josephson.

share orange and carrot juice.
Over the week their numbers have
dwindled to about twenty. But
yesterday at a noon rally on White
Plaza, they called for members of the
community to show their support of
the demands by fasting with them for
twenty-four hours. The fasters also
called for renewed protests at the
Placement Center later on this week.
Day Fasters to Break Bread
Today at a noon rally on White
Plaza, those who plan to fast for only
a day will break bread together. A core
of the original fasters say they will
continue until Lyman accedes to their
demands.
Also at today's rally Dave
Josephson will announce a
telephone-letter campaign. He will ask
all members of the community to
either write or phone in their opinion
of the three demands to the
President's office.
Yesterday's meeting began with the
fasters asking Lyman whether he had
given any thought to the issues
covered at the last meeting — the
demands for an open meeting and a
moratorium on campus military
recruiting.
Lyman said he had particularly
done a lot of thinking about the

fasters because their tactics "are so
different from what Venceremos is
doing."
Lyman's reply to the demand that
he call a moratorium on the present
campus judicial proceeding was to
relate the history of the formation of
the present system.
"There was a kind of moratorium
in the judicial system for. . . seven or
eight months between the first request
and the rejection of that request next
spring from me to the ASSU senate,"
Lyman said.
He finally invoked the President's
emergency power to "set up a judicial
system which could cope" until a new
one could be arrived at through the
proper mechanism, the committee of
fifteen, which represents students,
faculty and administration.
Column Inaccurate
He stated that a column in a recent
Daily which related the history of the
judicial system was "grossly
inaccurate ... in that it at least
strongly suggested if it did not flatly
state that the Administration upon
having its request for student
cooperation for the ASSU turned
down, created its own arbitrary
system."
Lyman stated the Administration
waited until the new Senate had been
elected to give them a chance to
approve it. "We gave them a chance to
debate and vote on it,"he said, "but
they voted not to cooperate."
When Josephson questioned why
the ASSU should cooperate with the
Administration, Lyman pointed out
that the ASSU was not refusing to
work with the Administration, but
rather with the system which "the
student body had voted for."
"Only then did we move,"
continued Lyman.
Decision Making Process
The final discussion of the hour
centered around the decision-making
process of the University. "We're
simply asking that anyone that lives
under the system have a right to
participate in its formation," said
Josephson.

NON LUNCH—French and Italian Department Chairman Raymond Giraud and Associate History Professor Hal Kahn
didn't eat lunch at the Faculty Club yesterday. They and 15 other members of the Faculty Political Action Group are
fasting for 24 hours in protest against war recruiting and the Campus Judicial Panel.
The second meeting between
President Richard Lyman and the
delegation led by David Josephson
representing about twenty fasters
ended yesterday morning with little
headway made, and no date set for
future negotiations.
For over an hour the ten-man
delegation sat around a large
conference table in the President's
office occasionally sipping orange juice
while debating their three demands
with President Lyman and Vice
Provost Rosenzweig.
According to Columbae
participants Lyman said no further
discussions with the group would be
productive.
Last Tuesday, forty-three began

fasting in support of three demands
that Lyman: (1) hold an open meeting
with the Stanford community, (2)
declare a moratorium on "war
recruiting" at the Placement Center,
and (3) impose a moratorium on
prosecutions through the Campus
Judicial Panel.
Lyman again denied the demands in
the discussion saying that "these
demands with the possible exception
of the open meeting... are not
negotiable."
"I can't say in thinking about this
that we have a little moratorium or a
medium sized moratorium or an
unlimited moratorium," continued
Lyman, "without it giving away the
principles that I believe are
important."
Since Tuesday the protesters have
met daily at noon in White Plaza to
share orange and carrot juice.
Over the week their numbers have
dwindled to about twenty. But
yesterday at a noon rally on White
Plaza, they called for members of the
community to show their support of
