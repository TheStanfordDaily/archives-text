## Letter To Undergrad Women 
### 
chri»ty gladwin

As a graduate student, I've sat
in two classes (both economics)
with undergraduate women at
Stanford, and I can't help but
wonder if they are any more
"enlightened" about what they
are going to do with their lives
than I was as an undergraduate.
Right now I have two goals: to
be a social scientist and to enjoy
life with my family (1 son, age 5,
1 daughter, age 3, 1 husband).
Ten years ago I would have
thought these goals mutually
exclusive. Now I think that
women have to be able to realize
both goals if they're going to be
"equal" to men in a real way. Ten
years ago I decided a family was
more important than a career.
Now I think I was socially
brainwashed, because now I can
look at the men who were
undergraduates with me and see
that they have both.
Women's lib has got to me. But
has it gotten through to you?
When Gloria Steinhem says we
realize we're all human beings,
what does that mean? To me it
means that the goals of men and
women are not that different: we
would like to live in a loving
environment and we'd like to do
productive, stimulating work.
Women's lib does not mean we're
down on housewives. We're not
out to push women into careers.
We are out to open up closed
doors for women, to give women
alternative ways of living they
didn't have ten years ago (in the
U.S.). In short, I believe that: a)

Every women, like every man, has
a right to enjoy her work, b)
Every woman, like every man, has
a right to have children.
The two "rights" are not
contradictory. Most of the men I
know (over thirty) have children
they love and cherish and jobs
they more or less enjoy but
definitely wouldn't give up to go
on welfare. When men are trying
to decide what to do with their
lives, they are not asked to make a
choice between a career or
children. I wonder how many
undergraduate women at Stanford
feel that they have to make that
choice.
The reason I wonder is due to
the lack of support among
undergraduates for the day care
center. I assume most students
know that the day care center is a
unique institution in that: a) It's a
community school: parents and
teachers control what happens to
their children, b) It has a sliding
pay scale: one pays according to
one's income. This means that
parents who need their children in
a nursery school can send them. It
also means that 48% of the
children in the school pay

$57-$74 per month, while 33% of
the children pay $85-$lOl per
month. ($9O/mth is the going rate
for day care in the Palo Alto
area.) The people at the top of the
scale (who pay twice as much as
the people on the bottom of the
scale) obviously feel that good
day care in a loving environment
should be had by anyone who
wants and needs it.
Basic Requirement
Unfortunately, a sliding fee
scale does not satisfy the basic
requirement for an enterprise to
survive: price should be greater
than average cost. 57% of the
children in the day care center
pay less than the costs of keeping
them there. So the center has a
debt of $30/mth. It needs
financial support.
Last quarter the assessment
vote for the day care center lost
by 180 votes. I wonder if it lost
because undergraduate women
could not see themselves needing
or using a day care center ten
years hence. Do they feel they
have to make a choice between a
career and children? Do they
assume that, because they want to
have children someday, they will

also enjoy staying "at home"
being a housewife? I did, and was
very much surprised that I didn't
enjoy staying at home, learning to
cook, having coffee with friends.
Many of my friends do enjoy
staying at home, and wouldn't
want to work, so that their having
to make a choice between career
and children didn't adversely
affect them. But I feel that this
choice has adversely affected
many women. I am not surprised
when I see statistics on the
predominance of women
alchoholics over men, or the
predominance of women with
mental health problems. I am not
surprised that women who have
been at home raising a family for
ten years are often
"unmotivated" to go out into the
cruel world to resume a career. I
am not surprised about the
number of women who are
accepted into graduate school and
then never show up. I do feel that
the choice between children and
career should not have to be made
by anyone, woman or man.
Wishful Thinking
But the choice has to be made
by women unless:
1) Part time jobs are viewed by
society to be as productive as full
time jobs
2) Men spend as much of their
9 to 5 lives raising their children
as women do
3) Good day care centers that
are parent controlled and
operated are available and not
prohibitively expensive.
ISlow let's face it: the first two
solutions are wishful thinking now
(although I hope to see both in
the future) for two reasons. First,
part time workers are considered
inefficient; one has to be a total
slave to the achievement ethic.
Hence women and men are unable
to find part time jobs so that they
can spend half their time with

their children. Second, most men
are not willing to stay at home
taking care of their children. The
ones that are willing are faced
with the problem of finding and
holding a part time job. I
personally only know 5 men who
take care of their children as
much as their wives do. And
they're academics, so that they
can work at home. They don't
have to punch a clock.
Therefore, at the present time,
day care is the only solution
which allows women to have both
careers and children. And of the
three solutions I've mentioned, it
is probably the least threatening
to the status quo. Hence I see it as
having the best chance of solving
the problem of women now. I
conclude that if undergraduate
women want to have children and
a career in their lives, then at
some time in their futures they
will need and use day care. Hence
they should support the children's
center now.
Some members of the Stanford
community are against supporting
day care for a minority of the
students. By preventing student
support of a community-run
children's center operating with
much cooperative effort now, the
Stanford "voluntarists" are just
hastening the arrival of a day care
center run by some branch of the
university bureaucracy. Such a
center will not be controlled by
the community or supported by
community effort, but will
undoubtably require far greater
expenditures than the present
Children's Center. These
expenditures will be paid by
students either directly or
indirectly. Tomorrow's students
will thus pay much more for the
unwillingness of today's students
to part with a dollar.

community school: parents and
teachers control what happens to
their children, b) It has a sliding
pay scale: one pays according to
one's income. This means that
parents who need their children in
a nursery school can send them. It
also means that 48% of the
children in the school pay

$57-$74 per month, while 33% of
the children pay $85-$lOl per
month. ($9O/mth is the going rate
for day care in the Palo Alto
area.) The people at the top of the
scale (who pay twice as much as
the people on the bottom of the
scale) obviously feel that good
day care in a loving environment
should be had by anyone who
wants and needs it.
Basic Requirement
Unfortunately, a sliding fee
scale does not satisfy the basic
requirement for an enterprise to
survive: price should be greater
than average cost. 57% of the
children in the day care center
pay less than the costs of keeping
them there. So the center has a
debt of $30/mth. It needs
financial support.
Last quarter the assessment
vote for the day care center lost
by 180 votes. I wonder if it lost
because undergraduate women
could not see themselves needing
or using a day care center ten
years hence. Do they feel they
have to make a choice between a
career and children? Do they
assume that, because they want to
have children someday, they will

also enjoy staying "at home"
being a housewife? I did, and was
very much surprised that I didn't
enjoy staying at home, learning to
cook, having coffee with friends.
Many of my friends do enjoy
staying at home, and wouldn't
want to work, so that their having
to make a choice between career
and children didn't adversely
affect them. But I feel that this
choice has adversely affected
many women. I am not surprised
when I see statistics on the
predominance of women
alchoholics over men, or the
predominance of women with
mental health problems. I am not
surprised that women who have
been at home raising a family for
ten years are often
"unmotivated" to go out into the
cruel world to resume a career. I
am not surprised about the
number of women who are
accepted into graduate school and
then never show up. I do feel that
the choice between children and
career should not have to be made
by anyone, woman or man.
Wishful Thinking
But the choice has to be made
by women unless:
1) Part time jobs are viewed by
society to be as productive as full
time jobs
2) Men spend as much of their
9 to 5 lives raising their children
as women do
3) Good day care centers that
are parent controlled and
operated are available and not
prohibitively expensive.
ISlow let's face it: the first two
solutions are wishful thinking now
(although I hope to see both in
the future) for two reasons. First,
part time workers are considered
inefficient; one has to be a total
slave to the achievement ethic.
Hence women and men are unable
to find part time jobs so that they
can spend half their time with

their children. Second, most men
are not willing to stay at home
taking care of their children. The
ones that are willing are faced
with the problem of finding and
holding a part time job. I
personally only know 5 men who
take care of their children as
much as their wives do. And
they're academics, so that they
can work at home. They don't
have to punch a clock.
Therefore, at the present time,
day care is the only solution
which allows women to have both
careers and children. And of the
three solutions I've mentioned, it
is probably the least threatening
to the status quo. Hence I see it as
having the best chance of solving
the problem of women now. I
conclude that if undergraduate
women want to have children and
a career in their lives, then at
some time in their futures they
will need and use day care. Hence
they should support the children's
center now.
Some members of the Stanford
community are against supporting
day care for a minority of the
students. By preventing student
support of a community-run
children's center operating with
much cooperative effort now, the
Stanford "voluntarists" are just
hastening the arrival of a day care
center run by some branch of the
university bureaucracy. Such a
center will not be controlled by
the community or supported by
community effort, but will
undoubtably require far greater
expenditures than the present
Children's Center. These
expenditures will be paid by
students either directly or
indirectly. Tomorrow's students
will thus pay much more for the
unwillingness of today's students
to part with a dollar.

As a graduate student, I've sat
in two classes (both economics)
with undergraduate women at
Stanford, and I can't help but
wonder if they are any more
"enlightened" about what they
are going to do with their lives
than I was as an undergraduate.
Right now I have two goals: to
be a social scientist and to enjoy
life with my family (1 son, age 5,
1 daughter, age 3, 1 husband).
Ten years ago I would have
thought these goals mutually
exclusive. Now I think that
women have to be able to realize
both goals if they're going to be
"equal" to men in a real way. Ten
years ago I decided a family was
more important than a career.
Now I think I was socially
brainwashed, because now I can
look at the men who were
undergraduates with me and see
that they have both.
Women's lib has got to me. But
has it gotten through to you?
When Gloria Steinhem says we
realize we're all human beings,
what does that mean? To me it
means that the goals of men and
women are not that different: we
would like to live in a loving
environment and we'd like to do
productive, stimulating work.
Women's lib does not mean we're
down on housewives. We're not
out to push women into careers.
We are out to open up closed
doors for women, to give women
alternative ways of living they
didn't have ten years ago (in the
U.S.). In short, I believe that: a)

Every women, like every man, has
a right to enjoy her work, b)
Every woman, like every man, has
a right to have children.
The two "rights" are not
contradictory. Most of the men I
know (over thirty) have children
they love and cherish and jobs
they more or less enjoy but
definitely wouldn't give up to go
on welfare. When men are trying
to decide what to do with their
lives, they are not asked to make a
choice between a career or
children. I wonder how many
undergraduate women at Stanford
feel that they have to make that
choice.
The reason I wonder is due to
the lack of support among
undergraduates for the day care
center. I assume most students

by anyone, woman or man.
Wishful Thinking
But the choice has to be made
by women unless:
1) Part time jobs are viewed by
society to be as productive as full
time jobs
2) Men spend as much of their
9 to 5 lives raising their children
as women do
3) Good day care centers that
are parent controlled and
operated are available and not
prohibitively expensive.
ISlow let's face it: the first two
solutions are wishful thinking now
(although I hope to see both in
the future) for two reasons. First,
part time workers are considered
inefficient; one has to be a total
slave to the achievement ethic.
Hence women and men are unable
to find part time jobs so that they
can spend half their time with

their children. Second, most men
are not willing to stay at home
taking care of their children. The
ones that are willing are faced
with the problem of finding and
holding a part time job. I
personally only know 5 men who
take care of their children as
much as their wives do. And
they're academics, so that they
can work at home. They don't
have to punch a clock.
Therefore, at the present time,
day care is the only solution
which allows women to have both
careers and children. And of the
three solutions I've mentioned, it
is probably the least threatening
to the status quo. Hence I see it as
having the best chance of solving
the problem of women now. I
conclude that if undergraduate
women want to have children and
a career in their lives, then at
some time in their futures they
will need and use day care. Hence
they should support the children's
center now.
Some members of the Stanford
community are against supporting
day care for a minority of the
students. By preventing student
support of a community-run
children's center operating with
much cooperative effort now, the
Stanford "voluntarists" are just
hastening the arrival of a day care
center run by some branch of the
university bureaucracy. Such a
center will not be controlled by
the community or supported by
community effort, but will
undoubtably require far greater
expenditures than the present
Children's Center. These
expenditures will be paid by
students either directly or
indirectly. Tomorrow's students
will thus pay much more for the
unwillingness of today's students
to part with a dollar.

student in Food Research)

As a graduate student, I've sat
in two classes (both economics)
with undergraduate women at
Stanford, and I can't help but
wonder if they are any more
"enlightened" about what they
are going to do with their lives
than I was as an undergraduate.
Right now I have two goals: to
be a social scientist and to enjoy
life with my family (1 son, age 5,
1 daughter, age 3, 1 husband).
Ten years ago I would have
thought these goals mutually
exclusive. Now I think that
women have to be able to realize
both goals if they're going to be
"equal" to men in a real way. Ten
years ago I decided a family was
more important than a career.
Now I think I was socially
brainwashed, because now I can
look at the men who were
undergraduates with me and see
that they have both.
Women's lib has got to me. But
has it gotten through to you?
When Gloria Steinhem says we
realize we're all human beings,
what does that mean? To me it
means that the goals of men and
women are not that different: we
would like to live in a loving
environment and we'd like to do
productive, stimulating work.
Women's lib does not mean we're
down on housewives. We're not
out to push women into careers.
We are out to open up closed
doors for women, to give women
alternative ways of living they
didn't have ten years ago (in the
U.S.). In short, I believe that: a)

Every women, like every man, has
a right to enjoy her work, b)
Every woman, like every man, has
a right to have children.
The two "rights" are not
contradictory. Most of the men I
know (over thirty) have children
they love and cherish and jobs
they more or less enjoy but
definitely wouldn't give up to go
on welfare. When men are trying
to decide what to do with their
lives, they are not asked to make a
choice between a career or
children. I wonder how many
undergraduate women at Stanford
feel that they have to make that
choice.
The reason I wonder is due to
the lack of support among
undergraduates for the day care
center. I assume most students
know that the day care center is a
unique institution in that: a) It's a
community school: parents and
teachers control what happens to
their children, b) It has a sliding
pay scale: one pays according to
one's income. This means that
parents who need their children in
a nursery school can send them. It
also means that 48% of the
children in the school pay

$57-$74 per month, while 33% of
the children pay $85-$lOl per
month. ($9O/mth is the going rate
for day care in the Palo Alto
area.) The people at the top of the
scale (who pay twice as much as
the people on the bottom of the
scale) obviously feel that good
day care in a loving environment
should be had by anyone who
wants and needs it.
Basic Requirement
Unfortunately, a sliding fee
scale does not satisfy the basic
requirement for an enterprise to
survive: price should be greater
than average cost. 57% of the
children in the day care center
pay less than the costs of keeping
them there. So the center has a
debt of $30/mth. It needs
financial support.
Last quarter the assessment
vote for the day care center lost
by 180 votes. I wonder if it lost
because undergraduate women
could not see themselves needing
or using a day care center ten
years hence. Do they feel they
have to make a choice between a
career and children? Do they
assume that, because they want to
have children someday, they will

also enjoy staying "at home"
being a housewife? I did, and was
very much surprised that I didn't
enjoy staying at home, learning to
cook, having coffee with friends.
Many of my friends do enjoy
staying at home, and wouldn't
want to work, so that their having
to make a choice between career
and children didn't adversely
affect them. But I feel that this
choice has adversely affected
many women. I am not surprised
when I see statistics on the
predominance of women
alchoholics over men, or the
predominance of women with
mental health problems. I am not
surprised that women who have
been at home raising a family for
ten years are often
"unmotivated" to go out into the
cruel world to resume a career. I
am not surprised about the
number of women who are
accepted into graduate school and
then never show up. I do feel that
the choice between children and
career should not have to be made
by anyone, woman or man.
