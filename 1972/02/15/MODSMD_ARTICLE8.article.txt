## Harvard Club's Night To Remember 
###

The Harvard Club of the Peninsula has; according to the president
of the club, Mr. Trosman; a potential membership of over 1800
members in the area. What I fear was a fairly representative sample
showed up for a dinner meeting of the club on the evening of
Wednesday, February 9, 1972, at the Stanford Faculty Club.
By the time my guests and I arrived just shortly past 7:30 p.m., a
group of approximately seventy members and their wives and guests
had assembled in a lounge where the cocktail hour was nearing a close.
A very pleasant grey-haired lady approached me as I crossed the
threshold of the lounge and introduced herself as Mrs. Marion
Scudder, the lady through whom my reservations had been finalized. I
introduced myself and presented my guests.
Mrs. Scudder clasped my hand in both of hers and told me how
happy they all were to have me there. Her smiling face bespoke a
mixture of surprise and befuddlement not unfamiliar to one who has
attended Harvard functions from coast to coast for several years and
who, in addition, happens to be black. As has been the case often in
the past, I was the only black attending the meeting. Indeed, I believe
I was the first black man ever to attend a meeting of this club as a
member, perhaps in any capacity.
The nine of us who composed the group I had invited got drinks
and began to circulate. I was talking to the club president when I
noticed a very fat man just outside the room talking to an elderly
couple.
From descriptions I had heard I assumed that the fat man was
Arturo Lionetti, the head chef at the Faculty Club. The week before
this meeting an article had appeared in a campus weekly, The
Chapparal, in which Mr. Lionetti, was quoted as refering to black
people as "spooks." Being, as I am, employed at the Stanford Main
Library, I had read the article. I went over to Mr. Lionetti, introduced
myself and attempted to question him about the remarks attributed
to him. He hurriedly replied that the article was all just "propaganda,"
then he rushed away.
The Incident
About four minutes later dinner was announced and everyone
proceeded to the dining room. As I was standing among my guests

preparing to sit down at a table, Mr. Lionetti approached me from
behind. As he entered my line of sight he asked me, "Hey, do you
belong here? Are you with the people eating here tonight?"
To say that I was outraged is to attempt to describe feelings that
are indescribable to whites and that need no verbal description for
non-whites. I stared intently at the fat chef and replied angrily, "Of
course I belong here. Where do you come off asking me whether I
belong here or not. Mind your own business and get away from me
you fat slob!" Mr. Lionetti recoiled from the effects of my abusive
language, then replied defensively, "Well you aren't wearing a name
tag."
"No one else is wearing a name tag at this table and you didn't
question them," was my heated answer. This was indeed the case as
any of my guests can verify.
Again I told the chef, "Get away from me and don't you dare ask
me whether I belong here until you've questioned everyone else in this
room."
Mr. Lionetti, I trust, correctly discerned the extent of my
indignation at this point and walked away a safe distance to a cart-full
of plates where he continued to peer at me while he dished out the
abominable curried chicken and limp asparagus he would soon inflict
upon me as a final indignity.
The Deluge
My guests and I had entered the dining hall some what ahead of the
rest of the party since we were a large group and we wished to sit
together if possible. Consequently the incident between Mr. Lionetti
and me was witnessed by only a few persons other than my guests.
As dinner progressed I stared intently at Mr. Lionetti and he at me.
When the young women who were serving the meal approached me to
ask me about my salad, dessert, etc., I gave them choice messages to
relay to Mr. Lionetti; then as they told him, I watched for his
response. The young women found the terms "fatso" and "tubby"
particularly amusing. As Mr. Lionetti and I continued our staring
match the other members and wives watched incredulously
wondering, no doubt, what was going on between us. As I was soon to
find out their speculations were running toward the most grandiose
extremes.
After the business portion of the meeting, the speakers were due to
be introduced.
At this point one of my guests, Mr. John Harris, realized that this
would be the most appropriate time to bring the insulting behavior of
Mr. Lionetti to the attention of the membership. I was later to learn
that another of my guests, Mrs. Lise Giraud, had brought the incident
to the attention of the president of the club before dinner began.
When she told him that Mr. Lionetti had asked me whether or not I
belonged there his reply was, "Oh, that's all right, he (meaning me)
can stay."
John Harris rose and asked to be recognized on a point of personal
privilege. He was greeted with a wave of shouts and jeers generally
demanding that he "shut up," "sit down" and "get out." He tried
several times to tell them that a member of the club, namely me, had
been grossly insulted by an employee of the Faculty Club. No one was
willing to listen. The president of the club asked us to leave, telling us
that he knew "our tactics" and that he would not allow us to "destroy
the Harvard Club of the Peninsula."
When I rose to try to explain what John was doing I received the
same sort of response. The president threatened to call the police and
have us evicted if we did not sit down or leave. We contended that we
had paid $6.35 apiece to attend the meeting and had a right to be
heard and that we would not be evicted. We decided, however, not to
press the issue and sat down.
Why did they react so extremely to what was an orderly appeal for
a few minutes forebearance to inform the club of a racist slap at one
of its members?
The answer lies in three letters that stand for three words, S.R.M.,
i.e., the Stanford Rehabilitation Movement. Several of us were
wearing SRM buttons that evening, including me. During the cocktail
hour several of my guests, though not I personally, were questioned
about the buttons. When the members found out that they stood for
the 'infamous' agitators who had the 'temerity' to be actively
opposing militarism and racism on campus they evidently began to
come quickly to the 'irrefutable' conclusion that our presence at the
meeting could denote nothing less than the coming of the revolutionary
apocalypse right there, smack-dab in the middle of the Harvard Club
of the Peninsula.
The sublime or perhaps ridiculous irony of their judgement of our
purposes is that my guests and I had specifically seen the meeting as
an opportunity to engago so-called established members of the
community in that holy of holies, rational dialogue. We paid our
money, appeared appropriately dressed and used not a single word of
profanity throughout the evening despite numerous occasions that I
think called for it. Our reasoned efforts to obtain at least recognition
if not redress for a blatantly racist injustice done to me were met with
mindless cries for order.
The topic for discussion that evening was "Is our legal system doing
its job?" The first speaker was Thomas Ehrlich, Dean of the Stanford
Law School. During his speech a Santa Clara County Police officer
arrived. I later learned (hat the police had been told there was a "fight' at
the Faculty Club. However, observing a scene of what seemed total
tranquility, the deputy took no further action. Little did he realize
that the tranquil gazes of the members were really stares of boredom
toward the speaker or else angry concentration directed at every move
my guests and I made.
What had occurred? I think many of the people that attended the
meeting got in touch with themselves for the first time in a long while.
I doubt if many of them thought they were the kind of people who
would call for police the first time a black tried to speak in their
presence. But they were. They demonstrated far better than all the
statistics I or anyone else could produce what kind of job our legal
system is doing. They saw us, in our coats, ties and floor length
dresses, as drooling drug-crazed revolutionaries and screamed for the
police the moment we moved to speak, not break plates or steal
silverware, just speak.
If the sight of a few buttons and one black face are that threatening
something is terribly wrong somewhere. My guests and I have seen this
for a long time. I hope some members of the Harvard Club saw it the
evening of Feb. 9. For all of us that meeting of the Harvard Club of
the Peninsula should be what Walter Lord called the evening the
Titanic sank, "a night to remember."
