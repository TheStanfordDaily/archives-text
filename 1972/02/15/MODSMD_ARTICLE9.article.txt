# 'Daily' Interview
## Woman Ex-Con Finds 'Jail Makes You An Animal' 
### EMMA PRICE 
(Patty Wood is a member of the
Prisoner's Union, a group of convicts
and ex-cons working to help prisoners.
She is white, from Texas, age 25. The
interview took place in the kitchen of
the Prisoner's Union house on Seventh
Street in San Francisco.)
Daily: How long were you in prison?
Wood: I was in the Women's House of
Detention in New York for eight and a
half months and then they extradicted
me to California and I was in the
county jail at Santa Rita in Alameda
for four and a half months.
Daily: What was the county jail at
Santa Rita like?
Wood: It was terrible.l was put in "the
hole" which is solitary confinement.
There were no windows and you
weren't allowed to smoke. The cell
had a toilet in it, but I couldn't flush
the toilet. The matrons had to flush it.
I had to sleep with my head outside
the covers and six times a night they
put on the overhead light to make sure
I was there.
Daily: Why were you in the hole?
Wood: It's supposed to be for
disciplinary cases, which I wasn't.
They had no right to put me there.
The reason they did was that I had
pleaded not guilty and they treat you
the worst then. They try to break you
down.
Daily: What else did they do to get
you to change to a guilty plea?
Wood: They tried to take away my
writing priveleges. I was only allowed
five letters a week anyway, and they
tried to take that away. I also couldn't
get anything to read.
Yell & Scream
Daily: Could you ever leave the hole?
Wood: Yes, twice a day to smoke. But
I had to yell and scream to even get
them to do that for me, which they
were supposed to do. It took half an
hour of screaming. Before I went back
to the hole I'd be searched to make
sure I wasn't bringing any cigarettes
back with me.
Daily: What was your worst
experience in prison?
Wood: I was six months pregnant
when I was arrested. I got absolutely
no medical attention for the next

three months. I never saw a doctor at
all. I had to really hussle to even get
them to give me milk. It was my first
baby so I didn't know anything about
it. My water burst at 3 a.m. I told the
matron but she told me I'd be all right.
They wouldn't take me over specially.
The regular bus for the hospital left the
prison at eight in the morning, so I
went on that. I think it was the
loneliest I've ever been in my life.
Daily: What happened at the hospital?
Wood: I was there three days. I was
really low. I hate to cry, but I couldn't
help it. At first they had me in the
ordinary ward but then theymoved me
to the prison ward. The prison ward
was much better even though it was
guarded. All the other women tried to
pick me up and take care of me. I got
a lot more sympathy and
understanding than on the free ward.
Daily: What happened to your baby
after you went back to jail?
Wood: They left her in the hospital.
They fed her on an experimental
formula and she got double
pneumonia. Finally after five weeks
my parents came and took her to their
house.
Turn into Animal
Daily: Could you describe a typical
day in jail?
Wood: There's nothing to say about
the hole. You just pace up and down
and go mad. You eat, sleep and live in
the same cell. I consistently had
bruises on my hands from banging on
the wall. The hole turns you into an
animal.
Daily: What about life in regular
prison?
Wood: You'd wake up, sit in your
room, eat meals in the corridor.
They'd lock us up before each meal to
make sure we were all there. We had to
do work, and there was also some time
to sit in the day room.
Daily: What kind of work?
Wood: It was slave labor. We had to
mop the floors and do the laundry. We
sewed uniforms for both the men's
and women's prisons and for the
hospitals.
Daily: Did they have any vocational
training or anything?
Wood: Yes, they had cosmetology,

nurses aid, and clerical training.
Clerical was the best they offered so it
was hard to get into. You had to be a
"model prisoner". I'd hate to have
that label put on me.
Daily: Why?
Wood: It takes away all your
self-respect. If you go along with the
administration, you have no
individuality, you turn into a
vegetable.
Daily: Getting back to your normal
day, did you have any kind of
exercise?
Wood: There were no exercise
facilities for the women. The men's
prisons do have these facilities.
Because of this, and because the diet is
almost pure starch, almost ninety
percent of the women come out of jail
fat.
Daily: Did you?
Wood: After I had my baby I weighed
155 pounds. I was really determined
to get rid of it so I used to exercise by
my bed. I'd get a lot of static from the
matron and from the other women in
the prison. They resented me because
they didn't have the motivation. This
was when I was still in New York.
Angela Davis came and she was on the
same corridor with me. She was a big
exercise freak and we used to exercise
together. The women sure didn't give
us any static after that, because Angela
Davis was like a movie star.
Daily: Was there any kind of library or
anything?
Wood: No, it was much worse than
what I hear about men's prisons. There
were no law books at all. They assume
women don't have minds.
Daily: What were most of the women
in for?
Wood: Forgery, drugs, prostitution.
Sometimes the same prostitute would
be in five times a week. The courts
were making a lot of money off of
those women.
Daily: Was there any attempt to make
you more "lady-like"?
Wood: Yes. You see men's and
women's prisons are founded on very
different principles. Men's prisons are
supposed to protect society from the
hardened criminals. But in women's
prisons, they try to lead you back to

the fold. They try to teach you how to
be a housewife and how to depend on
men. In other words, they see you as
having been led astray. You have no
mind of your own.
Daily: Do they send you out with
anything?
Wood: Yes, sixty dollars to get home
and one outfit of clothing. The
country jails send you out with
nothing. A lot of women have no place
to turn except back to the streets
where they came from.
Daily: Is there any kind of effort
made by the women prisoners to fight
back?
Wood: It's harder to organize women
in jail than men. The men have all
these political societies from the
Panthers to John Birch. Women form
family groups instead of political
groups. Families are what they're used
to.
Daily: What kind of family groups?
Wood: Well, the strong women take
the father role, and other women
become wives, brothers, and sisters.
They really call each other "sister" or
mama .
Daily: What about homosexuality?
Wood: It's accepted completely. I'd
say seventy to eighty percent of the
women are homosexual, at some
point. You have to do it just to
survive. It's not based on race or class
or anyting. In fact, there's a lot less
racism in women's jails than in men's,
and there's less in men's than the
media says.
Daily: Is the homosexuality ever
forced on anyone?
Wood: No, never. You naturally form
very deep friendships in jail, but
they're not always gay. There's a lot of
honesty, and if you're feeling bad you
get a lot of support. Like when I had

my baby, the other women
understood it because they'd been low
too. If someone's hurting, everyone
will yell and scream together until the
matron comes.
Daily: So everyone's pretty honest in
jail?
Wood: No, you have to do a lot of
acting. You have to play tough.
Daily: What were your relationships
with the matrons like?
Goon Squad
Wood: It was like a mother-child
relationship, with all the negative
aspects of the mother. We had to beg
for things if we wanted them, please,
please. Then if we got violent they'd
send in the goon squad.
Daily: What were the matrons like?
Wood: They were mostly young. A lot
of them were married to policemen, it
was a family thing. They were pretty
unexperienced in life. They really dug
the power role.
Daily: How did the matrons react
when you formed close friendships?
Wood: They tried to break them up.
The matrons are unhappy people.
When they see you laughing and
singing to keep each other from
crying, they try to break it up. Each
matron can make up her own rules, so
if they don't like you they can always
punish you.
Daily: Did you find it hard to keep in
touch with the outside world?
Wood: Yes. Women lose connections,
especially with their men, since men
don't visit much. When you're in
prison, you think about men all the
time and picture one man.
Daily: Is there any work program for
women prisoners where you can go
outside during the day to work?
Wood: No, none for women, all of
them are for men.

Daily: What about drugs in jail?
Wood: They're easy to get, but it's a
lot harder than in men's jails. In men's
jails, the guards almost encourage
drugs because it keeps the men passive.
But they figure women are already
submissive. There's always a way to
get them, though, especially pills.
Daily: What about cigarettes?
Wood: You're almost forced to smoke
in jail, since it's one of the few things
you can do. Cigarettes are like money,
people trade them. You're always
tense and nervous and smoking.
Daily: Where do you get the money
for them?
Wood: You'd buy the cigarettes at the
commissary. You could buy
toothpaste and shampoo there too.
Most women didn't get any money
from their families, so they'd make
deals with other prisoners. "I'm
working in the kitchen, so I'll make
you a sandwich for some cigarettes or
some money." Of course the butches
always had lots of money, since people
would pay them. Lots of people were
really nice, though, and would share
cigarettes.
Daily: Can you tell me something
about the Prisoner's Union?
Wood: It's a labor union for the
convicts inside. We have three basic
demands. End economic exploitation,
and the indeterminate sentence, and
restore human and civil rights to
convicts inside and outside. We're also
trying to develop support for prisoners
on the outside. So we have programs
where people can write letters to
prisoners. Anyone whose interest in
helping with any of our programs
should call us or come to our office.

send in the goon squad.
Daily: What were the matrons like?
Wood: They were mostly young. A lot
of them were married to policemen, it
was a family thing. They were pretty
unexperienced in life. They really dug
the power role.
Daily: How did the matrons react
when you formed close friendships?
Wood: They tried to break them up.
The matrons are unhappy people.
When they see you laughing and
singing to keep each other from
crying, they try to break it up. Each
matron can make up her own rules, so
if they don't like you they can always
punish you.
Daily: Did you find it hard to keep in
touch with the outside world?
Wood: Yes. Women lose connections,
especially with their men, since men
don't visit much. When you're in
prison, you think about men all the
time and picture one man.
Daily: Is there any work program for
women prisoners where you can go
outside during the day to work?
Wood: No, none for women, all of
them are for men.

Daily: What about drugs in jail?
Wood: They're easy to get, but it's a
lot harder than in men's jails. In men's
jails, the guards almost encourage
drugs because it keeps the men passive.
But they figure women are already
submissive. There's always a way to
get them, though, especially pills.
Daily: What about cigarettes?
Wood: You're almost forced to smoke
in jail, since it's one of the few things
you can do. Cigarettes are like money,
people trade them. You're always
tense and nervous and smoking.
Daily: Where do you get the money
for them?
Wood: You'd buy the cigarettes at the
commissary. You could buy
toothpaste and shampoo there too.
Most women didn't get any money
from their families, so they'd make
deals with other prisoners. "I'm
working in the kitchen, so I'll make
you a sandwich for some cigarettes or
some money." Of course the butches
always had lots of money, since people
would pay them. Lots of people were
really nice, though, and would share
cigarettes.
Daily: Can you tell me something
about the Prisoner's Union?
Wood: It's a labor union for the
convicts inside. We have three basic
demands. End economic exploitation,
and the indeterminate sentence, and
restore human and civil rights to
convicts inside and outside. We're also
trying to develop support for prisoners
on the outside. So we have programs
where people can write letters to
prisoners. Anyone whose interest in
helping with any of our programs
should call us or come to our office.
(Patty Wood is a member of the
Prisoner's Union, a group of convicts
and ex-cons working to help prisoners.
She is white, from Texas, age 25. The
interview took place in the kitchen of
the Prisoner's Union house on Seventh
Street in San Francisco.)
Daily: How long were you in prison?
Wood: I was in the Women's House of
Detention in New York for eight and a
half months and then they extradicted
me to California and I was in the
county jail at Santa Rita in Alameda
for four and a half months.
Daily: What was the county jail at
Santa Rita like?
Wood: It was terrible.l was put in "the
hole" which is solitary confinement.
There were no windows and you
weren't allowed to smoke. The cell
had a toilet in it, but I couldn't flush
the toilet. The matrons had to flush it.
I had to sleep with my head outside
the covers and six times a night they
put on the overhead light to make sure
I was there.
Daily: Why were you in the hole?
Wood: It's supposed to be for
disciplinary cases, which I wasn't.
They had no right to put me there.
The reason they did was that I had
pleaded not guilty and they treat you
the worst then. They try to break you
down.
Daily: What else did they do to get
you to change to a guilty plea?
Wood: They tried to take away my
writing priveleges. I was only allowed
five letters a week anyway, and they
tried to take that away. I also couldn't
get anything to read.
Yell & Scream
Daily: Could you ever leave the hole?
Wood: Yes, twice a day to smoke. But
I had to yell and scream to even get
them to do that for me, which they
were supposed to do. It took half an
hour of screaming. Before I went back
to the hole I'd be searched to make
sure I wasn't bringing any cigarettes
back with me.
Daily: What was your worst
experience in prison?
Wood: I was six months pregnant
when I was arrested. I got absolutely
no medical attention for the next

three months. I never saw a doctor at
all. I had to really hussle to even get
them to give me milk. It was my first
baby so I didn't know anything about
it. My water burst at 3 a.m. I told the
matron but she told me I'd be all right.
They wouldn't take me over specially.
The regular bus for the hospital left the
prison at eight in the morning, so I
went on that. I think it was the
loneliest I've ever been in my life.
Daily: What happened at the hospital?
Wood: I was there three days. I was
really low. I hate to cry, but I couldn't
help it. At first they had me in the
ordinary ward but then theymoved me
to the prison ward. The prison ward
was much better even though it was
guarded. All the other women tried to
pick me up and take care of me. I got
a lot more sympathy and
understanding than on the free ward.
Daily: What happened to your baby
after you went back to jail?
Wood: They left her in the hospital.
They fed her on an experimental
formula and she got double
pneumonia. Finally after five weeks
my parents came and took her to their
house.
Turn into Animal
Daily: Could you describe a typical
day in jail?
Wood: There's nothing to say about
the hole. You just pace up and down
and go mad. You eat, sleep and live in
the same cell. I consistently had
bruises on my hands from banging on
the wall. The hole turns you into an
animal.
Daily: What about life in regular
prison?
Wood: You'd wake up, sit in your
room, eat meals in the corridor.
They'd lock us up before each meal to
make sure we were all there. We had to
do work, and there was also some time
to sit in the day room.
Daily: What kind of work?
Wood: It was slave labor. We had to
mop the floors and do the laundry. We
sewed uniforms for both the men's
and women's prisons and for the
hospitals.
Daily: Did they have any vocational
training or anything?
Wood: Yes, they had cosmetology,

nurses aid, and clerical training.
Clerical was the best they offered so it
was hard to get into. You had to be a
"model prisoner". I'd hate to have
that label put on me.
Daily: Why?
Wood: It takes away all your
self-respect. If you go along with the
administration, you have no
individuality, you turn into a
vegetable.
Daily: Getting back to your normal
day, did you have any kind of
exercise?
Wood: There were no exercise
facilities for the women. The men's
prisons do have these facilities.
Because of this, and because the diet is
almost pure starch, almost ninety
percent of the women come out of jail
fat.
Daily: Did you?
Wood: After I had my baby I weighed
155 pounds. I was really determined
to get rid of it so I used to exercise by
my bed. I'd get a lot of static from the
matron and from the other women in
the prison. They resented me because
they didn't have the motivation. This
was when I was still in New York.
Angela Davis came and she was on the
same corridor with me. She was a big
exercise freak and we used to exercise
together. The women sure didn't give
us any static after that, because Angela
Davis was like a movie star.
Daily: Was there any kind of library or
anything?
Wood: No, it was much worse than
what I hear about men's prisons. There
were no law books at all. They assume
women don't have minds.
Daily: What were most of the women
in for?
Wood: Forgery, drugs, prostitution.
Sometimes the same prostitute would
be in five times a week. The courts
were making a lot of money off of
those women.
Daily: Was there any attempt to make
you more "lady-like"?
Wood: Yes. You see men's and
women's prisons are founded on very
different principles. Men's prisons are
supposed to protect society from the
hardened criminals. But in women's
prisons, they try to lead you back to

the fold. They try to teach you how to
be a housewife and how to depend on
men. In other words, they see you as
having been led astray. You have no
mind of your own.
Daily: Do they send you out with
anything?
Wood: Yes, sixty dollars to get home
and one outfit of clothing. The
country jails send you out with
nothing. A lot of women have no place
to turn except back to the streets
where they came from.
Daily: Is there any kind of effort
made by the women prisoners to fight
back?
Wood: It's harder to organize women
in jail than men. The men have all
these political societies from the
Panthers to John Birch. Women form
family groups instead of political
groups. Families are what they're used
to.
Daily: What kind of family groups?
Wood: Well, the strong women take
the father role, and other women
become wives, brothers, and sisters.
They really call each other "sister" or
mama .
Daily: What about homosexuality?
Wood: It's accepted completely. I'd
say seventy to eighty percent of the
women are homosexual, at some
point. You have to do it just to
survive. It's not based on race or class
or anyting. In fact, there's a lot less
racism in women's jails than in men's,
and there's less in men's than the
media says.
Daily: Is the homosexuality ever
forced on anyone?
Wood: No, never. You naturally form
very deep friendships in jail, but
they're not always gay. There's a lot of
honesty, and if you're feeling bad you
get a lot of support. Like when I had

my baby, the other women
understood it because they'd been low
too. If someone's hurting, everyone
will yell and scream together until the
matron comes.
Daily: So everyone's pretty honest in
jail?
Wood: No, you have to do a lot of
acting. You have to play tough.
Daily: What were your relationships
with the matrons like?
Goon Squad
Wood: It was like a mother-child
relationship, with all the negative
aspects of the mother. We had to beg
for things if we wanted them, please,
please. Then if we got violent they'd
send in the goon squad.
Daily: What were the matrons like?
Wood: They were mostly young. A lot
of them were married to policemen, it

were making a lot of money off of
those women.
Daily: Was there any attempt to make
you more "lady-like"?
Wood: Yes. You see men's and
women's prisons are founded on very
different principles. Men's prisons are
supposed to protect society from the
hardened criminals. But in women's
prisons, they try to lead you back to

the fold. They try to teach you how to
be a housewife and how to depend on
men. In other words, they see you as
having been led astray. You have no
mind of your own.
Daily: Do they send you out with
anything?
Wood: Yes, sixty dollars to get home
and one outfit of clothing. The
country jails send you out with
nothing. A lot of women have no place
to turn except back to the streets
where they came from.
Daily: Is there any kind of effort
made by the women prisoners to fight
back?
Wood: It's harder to organize women
in jail than men. The men have all
these political societies from the
Panthers to John Birch. Women form
family groups instead of political
groups. Families are what they're used
to.
Daily: What kind of family groups?
Wood: Well, the strong women take
the father role, and other women
become wives, brothers, and sisters.
They really call each other "sister" or
mama .
Daily: What about homosexuality?
Wood: It's accepted completely. I'd
say seventy to eighty percent of the
women are homosexual, at some
point. You have to do it just to
survive. It's not based on race or class
or anyting. In fact, there's a lot less
racism in women's jails than in men's,
and there's less in men's than the
media says.
Daily: Is the homosexuality ever
forced on anyone?
Wood: No, never. You naturally form
very deep friendships in jail, but
they're not always gay. There's a lot of
honesty, and if you're feeling bad you
get a lot of support. Like when I had

my baby, the other women
understood it because they'd been low
too. If someone's hurting, everyone
will yell and scream together until the
matron comes.
Daily: So everyone's pretty honest in
jail?
Wood: No, you have to do a lot of
acting. You have to play tough.
Daily: What were your relationships
with the matrons like?
Goon Squad
Wood: It was like a mother-child
relationship, with all the negative
aspects of the mother. We had to beg
for things if we wanted them, please,
please. Then if we got violent they'd
send in the goon squad.
Daily: What were the matrons like?
Wood: They were mostly young. A lot
of them were married to policemen, it
was a family thing. They were pretty
unexperienced in life. They really dug
the power role.
Daily: How did the matrons react
when you formed close friendships?
Wood: They tried to break them up.
The matrons are unhappy people.
When they see you laughing and
singing to keep each other from
crying, they try to break it up. Each
matron can make up her own rules, so
if they don't like you they can always
punish you.
Daily: Did you find it hard to keep in
touch with the outside world?
Wood: Yes. Women lose connections,
especially with their men, since men
don't visit much. When you're in
prison, you think about men all the
time and picture one man.
Daily: Is there any work program for
women prisoners where you can go
outside during the day to work?
Wood: No, none for women, all of
them are for men.

Daily: What about drugs in jail?
Wood: They're easy to get, but it's a
lot harder than in men's jails. In men's
jails, the guards almost encourage
drugs because it keeps the men passive.
But they figure women are already
submissive. There's always a way to
get them, though, especially pills.
Daily: What about cigarettes?
Wood: You're almost forced to smoke
in jail, since it's one of the few things
you can do. Cigarettes are like money,
people trade them. You're always
tense and nervous and smoking.
Daily: Where do you get the money
for them?
Wood: You'd buy the cigarettes at the
commissary. You could buy
toothpaste and shampoo there too.
Most women didn't get any money
from their families, so they'd make
deals with other prisoners. "I'm
working in the kitchen, so I'll make
you a sandwich for some cigarettes or
some money." Of course the butches
always had lots of money, since people
would pay them. Lots of people were
really nice, though, and would share
cigarettes.
Daily: Can you tell me something
about the Prisoner's Union?
Wood: It's a labor union for the
convicts inside. We have three basic
demands. End economic exploitation,
and the indeterminate sentence, and
restore human and civil rights to
convicts inside and outside. We're also
trying to develop support for prisoners
on the outside. So we have programs
where people can write letters to
prisoners. Anyone whose interest in
helping with any of our programs
should call us or come to our office.
(Patty Wood is a member of the
Prisoner's Union, a group of convicts
and ex-cons working to help prisoners.
She is white, from Texas, age 25. The
interview took place in the kitchen of
the Prisoner's Union house on Seventh
Street in San Francisco.)
Daily: How long were you in prison?
Wood: I was in the Women's House of
Detention in New York for eight and a
half months and then they extradicted
me to California and I was in the
county jail at Santa Rita in Alameda
for four and a half months.
Daily: What was the county jail at
Santa Rita like?
Wood: It was terrible.l was put in "the
hole" which is solitary confinement.
There were no windows and you
weren't allowed to smoke. The cell
had a toilet in it, but I couldn't flush
the toilet. The matrons had to flush it.
I had to sleep with my head outside
the covers and six times a night they
put on the overhead light to make sure
I was there.
Daily: Why were you in the hole?
Wood: It's supposed to be for
disciplinary cases, which I wasn't.
They had no right to put me there.
The reason they did was that I had
pleaded not guilty and they treat you
the worst then. They try to break you
down.
Daily: What else did they do to get
you to change to a guilty plea?
Wood: They tried to take away my
writing priveleges. I was only allowed
five letters a week anyway, and they
tried to take that away. I also couldn't
get anything to read.
Yell & Scream
Daily: Could you ever leave the hole?
Wood: Yes, twice a day to smoke. But
I had to yell and scream to even get
them to do that for me, which they
were supposed to do. It took half an
hour of screaming. Before I went back
to the hole I'd be searched to make
sure I wasn't bringing any cigarettes
back with me.
Daily: What was your worst
experience in prison?
Wood: I was six months pregnant
when I was arrested. I got absolutely
no medical attention for the next

three months. I never saw a doctor at
all. I had to really hussle to even get
them to give me milk. It was my first
baby so I didn't know anything about
it. My water burst at 3 a.m. I told the
matron but she told me I'd be all right.
They wouldn't take me over specially.
The regular bus for the hospital left the
prison at eight in the morning, so I
went on that. I think it was the
loneliest I've ever been in my life.
Daily: What happened at the hospital?
Wood: I was there three days. I was
really low. I hate to cry, but I couldn't
help it. At first they had me in the
ordinary ward but then theymoved me
to the prison ward. The prison ward
was much better even though it was
guarded. All the other women tried to
pick me up and take care of me. I got
a lot more sympathy and
understanding than on the free ward.
Daily: What happened to your baby
after you went back to jail?
Wood: They left her in the hospital.
They fed her on an experimental
formula and she got double
pneumonia. Finally after five weeks
my parents came and took her to their
house.
Turn into Animal
Daily: Could you describe a typical
day in jail?
Wood: There's nothing to say about
the hole. You just pace up and down
and go mad. You eat, sleep and live in
the same cell. I consistently had
bruises on my hands from banging on
the wall. The hole turns you into an
animal.
Daily: What about life in regular
prison?
Wood: You'd wake up, sit in your
room, eat meals in the corridor.
They'd lock us up before each meal to
make sure we were all there. We had to
do work, and there was also some time
to sit in the day room.
Daily: What kind of work?
Wood: It was slave labor. We had to
mop the floors and do the laundry. We
sewed uniforms for both the men's
and women's prisons and for the
hospitals.
Daily: Did they have any vocational
training or anything?
Wood: Yes, they had cosmetology,

nurses aid, and clerical training.
Clerical was the best they offered so it
was hard to get into. You had to be a
"model prisoner". I'd hate to have
that label put on me.
Daily: Why?
Wood: It takes away all your
self-respect. If you go along with the
administration, you have no
individuality, you turn into a
vegetable.
Daily: Getting back to your normal
day, did you have any kind of
exercise?
Wood: There were no exercise
facilities for the women. The men's
prisons do have these facilities.
Because of this, and because the diet is
almost pure starch, almost ninety
percent of the women come out of jail
fat.
Daily: Did you?
Wood: After I had my baby I weighed
155 pounds. I was really determined
to get rid of it so I used to exercise by
my bed. I'd get a lot of static from the
matron and from the other women in
the prison. They resented me because
they didn't have the motivation. This
was when I was still in New York.
Angela Davis came and she was on the
same corridor with me. She was a big
exercise freak and we used to exercise
together. The women sure didn't give
us any static after that, because Angela
Davis was like a movie star.
Daily: Was there any kind of library or
anything?
Wood: No, it was much worse than
what I hear about men's prisons. There
were no law books at all. They assume
women don't have minds.
Daily: What were most of the women
in for?
Wood: Forgery, drugs, prostitution.
Sometimes the same prostitute would
be in five times a week. The courts
were making a lot of money off of
those women.
Daily: Was there any attempt to make
you more "lady-like"?
Wood: Yes. You see men's and

Daily: Could you describe a typical
day in jail?
Wood: There's nothing to say about
the hole. You just pace up and down
and go mad. You eat, sleep and live in
the same cell. I consistently had
bruises on my hands from banging on
the wall. The hole turns you into an
animal.
Daily: What about life in regular
prison?
Wood: You'd wake up, sit in your
room, eat meals in the corridor.
They'd lock us up before each meal to
make sure we were all there. We had to
do work, and there was also some time
to sit in the day room.
Daily: What kind of work?
Wood: It was slave labor. We had to
mop the floors and do the laundry. We
sewed uniforms for both the men's
and women's prisons and for the
hospitals.
Daily: Did they have any vocational
training or anything?
Wood: Yes, they had cosmetology,

nurses aid, and clerical training.
Clerical was the best they offered so it
was hard to get into. You had to be a
"model prisoner". I'd hate to have
that label put on me.
Daily: Why?
Wood: It takes away all your
self-respect. If you go along with the
administration, you have no
individuality, you turn into a
vegetable.
Daily: Getting back to your normal
day, did you have any kind of
exercise?
Wood: There were no exercise
facilities for the women. The men's
prisons do have these facilities.
Because of this, and because the diet is
almost pure starch, almost ninety
percent of the women come out of jail
fat.
Daily: Did you?
Wood: After I had my baby I weighed
155 pounds. I was really determined
to get rid of it so I used to exercise by
my bed. I'd get a lot of static from the
matron and from the other women in
the prison. They resented me because
they didn't have the motivation. This
was when I was still in New York.
Angela Davis came and she was on the
same corridor with me. She was a big
exercise freak and we used to exercise
together. The women sure didn't give
us any static after that, because Angela
Davis was like a movie star.
Daily: Was there any kind of library or
anything?
Wood: No, it was much worse than
what I hear about men's prisons. There
were no law books at all. They assume
women don't have minds.
Daily: What were most of the women
in for?
Wood: Forgery, drugs, prostitution.
Sometimes the same prostitute would
be in five times a week. The courts
were making a lot of money off of
those women.
Daily: Was there any attempt to make
you more "lady-like"?
Wood: Yes. You see men's and
women's prisons are founded on very
different principles. Men's prisons are
supposed to protect society from the
hardened criminals. But in women's
prisons, they try to lead you back to

the fold. They try to teach you how to
be a housewife and how to depend on
men. In other words, they see you as
having been led astray. You have no
mind of your own.
Daily: Do they send you out with
anything?
Wood: Yes, sixty dollars to get home
and one outfit of clothing. The
country jails send you out with
nothing. A lot of women have no place
to turn except back to the streets
where they came from.
Daily: Is there any kind of effort
made by the women prisoners to fight
back?
Wood: It's harder to organize women
in jail than men. The men have all
these political societies from the
Panthers to John Birch. Women form
family groups instead of political
groups. Families are what they're used
to.
Daily: What kind of family groups?
Wood: Well, the strong women take
the father role, and other women
become wives, brothers, and sisters.
They really call each other "sister" or
mama .
Daily: What about homosexuality?
Wood: It's accepted completely. I'd
say seventy to eighty percent of the
women are homosexual, at some
point. You have to do it just to
survive. It's not based on race or class
or anyting. In fact, there's a lot less
racism in women's jails than in men's,
and there's less in men's than the
media says.
Daily: Is the homosexuality ever
forced on anyone?
Wood: No, never. You naturally form
very deep friendships in jail, but
they're not always gay. There's a lot of
honesty, and if you're feeling bad you
get a lot of support. Like when I had

my baby, the other women
understood it because they'd been low
too. If someone's hurting, everyone
will yell and scream together until the
matron comes.
Daily: So everyone's pretty honest in
jail?
Wood: No, you have to do a lot of
acting. You have to play tough.
Daily: What were your relationships
with the matrons like?
Goon Squad
Wood: It was like a mother-child
relationship, with all the negative
aspects of the mother. We had to beg
for things if we wanted them, please,
please. Then if we got violent they'd
send in the goon squad.
Daily: What were the matrons like?
Wood: They were mostly young. A lot
of them were married to policemen, it
was a family thing. They were pretty
unexperienced in life. They really dug
the power role.
Daily: How did the matrons react
when you formed close friendships?
Wood: They tried to break them up.
The matrons are unhappy people.
When they see you laughing and
singing to keep each other from
crying, they try to break it up. Each
matron can make up her own rules, so
if they don't like you they can always
punish you.
Daily: Did you find it hard to keep in
touch with the outside world?
Wood: Yes. Women lose connections,
especially with their men, since men
don't visit much. When you're in
prison, you think about men all the
time and picture one man.
Daily: Is there any work program for
women prisoners where you can go
outside during the day to work?
Wood: No, none for women, all of
them are for men.

Daily: What about drugs in jail?
Wood: They're easy to get, but it's a
lot harder than in men's jails. In men's
jails, the guards almost encourage
drugs because it keeps the men passive.
But they figure women are already
submissive. There's always a way to
get them, though, especially pills.
Daily: What about cigarettes?
Wood: You're almost forced to smoke
in jail, since it's one of the few things
you can do. Cigarettes are like money,
people trade them. You're always
tense and nervous and smoking.
Daily: Where do you get the money
for them?
Wood: You'd buy the cigarettes at the
commissary. You could buy
toothpaste and shampoo there too.
Most women didn't get any money
from their families, so they'd make
deals with other prisoners. "I'm
working in the kitchen, so I'll make
you a sandwich for some cigarettes or
some money." Of course the butches
always had lots of money, since people
would pay them. Lots of people were
really nice, though, and would share
cigarettes.
Daily: Can you tell me something
about the Prisoner's Union?
Wood: It's a labor union for the
convicts inside. We have three basic
demands. End economic exploitation,
and the indeterminate sentence, and
restore human and civil rights to
convicts inside and outside. We're also
trying to develop support for prisoners
on the outside. So we have programs
where people can write letters to
prisoners. Anyone whose interest in
helping with any of our programs
should call us or come to our office.

Prisoner's Union, a group of convicts
and ex-cons working to help prisoners.

interview took place in the kitchen of
the Prisoner's Union house on Seventh
Street in San Francisco.)
Daily: How long were you in prison?
Wood: I was in the Women's House of
Detention in New York for eight and a
half months and then they extradicted
me to California and I was in the
county jail at Santa Rita in Alameda
for four and a half months.
Daily: What was the county jail at
Santa Rita like?
Wood: It was terrible.l was put in "the
hole" which is solitary confinement.
There were no windows and you
weren't allowed to smoke. The cell
had a toilet in it, but I couldn't flush
the toilet. The matrons had to flush it.
I had to sleep with my head outside
the covers and six times a night they
put on the overhead light to make sure
I was there.
Daily: Why were you in the hole?
Wood: It's supposed to be for
disciplinary cases, which I wasn't.
They had no right to put me there.
The reason they did was that I had
pleaded not guilty and they treat you
the worst then. They try to break you
down.
Daily: What else did they do to get
you to change to a guilty plea?
Wood: They tried to take away my
writing priveleges. I was only allowed
five letters a week anyway, and they
tried to take that away. I also couldn't
get anything to read.
Yell & Scream
Daily: Could you ever leave the hole?
Wood: Yes, twice a day to smoke. But
I had to yell and scream to even get
them to do that for me, which they
were supposed to do. It took half an
hour of screaming. Before I went back
to the hole I'd be searched to make
sure I wasn't bringing any cigarettes
back with me.
Daily: What was your worst
experience in prison?
Wood: I was six months pregnant
when I was arrested. I got absolutely
no medical attention for the next

three months. I never saw a doctor at
all. I had to really hussle to even get
them to give me milk. It was my first
baby so I didn't know anything about
it. My water burst at 3 a.m. I told the
matron but she told me I'd be all right.
They wouldn't take me over specially.
The regular bus for the hospital left the
prison at eight in the morning, so I
went on that. I think it was the
loneliest I've ever been in my life.
Daily: What happened at the hospital?
Wood: I was there three days. I was
really low. I hate to cry, but I couldn't
help it. At first they had me in the
ordinary ward but then theymoved me
to the prison ward. The prison ward
was much better even though it was
guarded. All the other women tried to
pick me up and take care of me. I got
a lot more sympathy and
understanding than on the free ward.
Daily: What happened to your baby
after you went back to jail?
Wood: They left her in the hospital.
They fed her on an experimental
formula and she got double
pneumonia. Finally after five weeks
my parents came and took her to their
house.

had a toilet in it, but I couldn't flush
the toilet. The matrons had to flush it.
I had to sleep with my head outside
the covers and six times a night they
put on the overhead light to make sure
I was there.
Daily: Why were you in the hole?
Wood: It's supposed to be for
disciplinary cases, which I wasn't.
They had no right to put me there.
The reason they did was that I had
pleaded not guilty and they treat you
the worst then. They try to break you
down.
Daily: What else did they do to get
you to change to a guilty plea?
Wood: They tried to take away my
writing priveleges. I was only allowed
five letters a week anyway, and they
tried to take that away. I also couldn't
get anything to read.
Yell & Scream
Daily: Could you ever leave the hole?
Wood: Yes, twice a day to smoke. But
I had to yell and scream to even get
them to do that for me, which they
were supposed to do. It took half an
hour of screaming. Before I went back
to the hole I'd be searched to make
sure I wasn't bringing any cigarettes
back with me.
Daily: What was your worst
experience in prison?
Wood: I was six months pregnant
when I was arrested. I got absolutely
no medical attention for the next

three months. I never saw a doctor at
all. I had to really hussle to even get
them to give me milk. It was my first
baby so I didn't know anything about
it. My water burst at 3 a.m. I told the
matron but she told me I'd be all right.
They wouldn't take me over specially.
The regular bus for the hospital left the
prison at eight in the morning, so I
went on that. I think it was the
loneliest I've ever been in my life.
Daily: What happened at the hospital?
Wood: I was there three days. I was
really low. I hate to cry, but I couldn't
help it. At first they had me in the
ordinary ward but then theymoved me
to the prison ward. The prison ward
was much better even though it was
guarded. All the other women tried to
pick me up and take care of me. I got
a lot more sympathy and
understanding than on the free ward.
Daily: What happened to your baby
after you went back to jail?
Wood: They left her in the hospital.
They fed her on an experimental
formula and she got double
pneumonia. Finally after five weeks
my parents came and took her to their
house.
Turn into Animal
Daily: Could you describe a typical
day in jail?
Wood: There's nothing to say about
the hole. You just pace up and down
and go mad. You eat, sleep and live in
the same cell. I consistently had
bruises on my hands from banging on
the wall. The hole turns you into an
animal.
Daily: What about life in regular
prison?
Wood: You'd wake up, sit in your
room, eat meals in the corridor.
They'd lock us up before each meal to
make sure we were all there. We had to
do work, and there was also some time
to sit in the day room.
Daily: What kind of work?
Wood: It was slave labor. We had to
mop the floors and do the laundry. We
sewed uniforms for both the men's
and women's prisons and for the
hospitals.
Daily: Did they have any vocational
training or anything?
Wood: Yes, they had cosmetology,

nurses aid, and clerical training.
Clerical was the best they offered so it
was hard to get into. You had to be a
"model prisoner". I'd hate to have
that label put on me.
Daily: Why?
Wood: It takes away all your
self-respect. If you go along with the
administration, you have no
individuality, you turn into a
vegetable.
Daily: Getting back to your normal
day, did you have any kind of
exercise?
Wood: There were no exercise
facilities for the women. The men's
prisons do have these facilities.
Because of this, and because the diet is
almost pure starch, almost ninety
percent of the women come out of jail
fat.
Daily: Did you?
Wood: After I had my baby I weighed
155 pounds. I was really determined
to get rid of it so I used to exercise by
my bed. I'd get a lot of static from the
matron and from the other women in
the prison. They resented me because
they didn't have the motivation. This
was when I was still in New York.
Angela Davis came and she was on the
same corridor with me. She was a big
exercise freak and we used to exercise
together. The women sure didn't give
us any static after that, because Angela
Davis was like a movie star.
Daily: Was there any kind of library or
anything?
Wood: No, it was much worse than
what I hear about men's prisons. There
were no law books at all. They assume
women don't have minds.
Daily: What were most of the women
in for?
Wood: Forgery, drugs, prostitution.
Sometimes the same prostitute would
be in five times a week. The courts
were making a lot of money off of
those women.
Daily: Was there any attempt to make
you more "lady-like"?
Wood: Yes. You see men's and
women's prisons are founded on very
different principles. Men's prisons are
supposed to protect society from the
hardened criminals. But in women's
prisons, they try to lead you back to

the fold. They try to teach you how to
be a housewife and how to depend on
men. In other words, they see you as
having been led astray. You have no
mind of your own.
Daily: Do they send you out with
anything?
Wood: Yes, sixty dollars to get home
and one outfit of clothing. The
country jails send you out with
nothing. A lot of women have no place
to turn except back to the streets
where they came from.
Daily: Is there any kind of effort
made by the women prisoners to fight
back?
Wood: It's harder to organize women
in jail than men. The men have all
these political societies from the
Panthers to John Birch. Women form
family groups instead of political
groups. Families are what they're used
to.
Daily: What kind of family groups?
Wood: Well, the strong women take
the father role, and other women
become wives, brothers, and sisters.
They really call each other "sister" or
mama .
Daily: What about homosexuality?
Wood: It's accepted completely. I'd
say seventy to eighty percent of the
women are homosexual, at some
point. You have to do it just to
survive. It's not based on race or class
or anyting. In fact, there's a lot less
racism in women's jails than in men's,
and there's less in men's than the
media says.
Daily: Is the homosexuality ever
forced on anyone?
Wood: No, never. You naturally form
very deep friendships in jail, but
they're not always gay. There's a lot of
honesty, and if you're feeling bad you
get a lot of support. Like when I had

my baby, the other women
understood it because they'd been low
too. If someone's hurting, everyone
will yell and scream together until the
matron comes.
Daily: So everyone's pretty honest in
jail?
Wood: No, you have to do a lot of
acting. You have to play tough.
Daily: What were your relationships
with the matrons like?
Goon Squad
Wood: It was like a mother-child
relationship, with all the negative
aspects of the mother. We had to beg
for things if we wanted them, please,
please. Then if we got violent they'd
send in the goon squad.
Daily: What were the matrons like?
Wood: They were mostly young. A lot
of them were married to policemen, it
was a family thing. They were pretty
unexperienced in life. They really dug
the power role.
Daily: How did the matrons react
when you formed close friendships?
Wood: They tried to break them up.
The matrons are unhappy people.
When they see you laughing and
singing to keep each other from
crying, they try to break it up. Each
matron can make up her own rules, so
if they don't like you they can always
punish you.
Daily: Did you find it hard to keep in
touch with the outside world?
Wood: Yes. Women lose connections,
especially with their men, since men
don't visit much. When you're in
prison, you think about men all the
time and picture one man.
Daily: Is there any work program for
women prisoners where you can go
outside during the day to work?
Wood: No, none for women, all of
them are for men.

Daily: What about drugs in jail?
Wood: They're easy to get, but it's a
lot harder than in men's jails. In men's
jails, the guards almost encourage
drugs because it keeps the men passive.
But they figure women are already
submissive. There's always a way to
get them, though, especially pills.
Daily: What about cigarettes?
Wood: You're almost forced to smoke
in jail, since it's one of the few things
you can do. Cigarettes are like money,
people trade them. You're always
tense and nervous and smoking.
Daily: Where do you get the money
for them?
Wood: You'd buy the cigarettes at the
commissary. You could buy
toothpaste and shampoo there too.
Most women didn't get any money
from their families, so they'd make
deals with other prisoners. "I'm
working in the kitchen, so I'll make
you a sandwich for some cigarettes or
some money." Of course the butches
always had lots of money, since people
would pay them. Lots of people were
really nice, though, and would share
cigarettes.
Daily: Can you tell me something
about the Prisoner's Union?
Wood: It's a labor union for the
convicts inside. We have three basic
demands. End economic exploitation,
and the indeterminate sentence, and
restore human and civil rights to
convicts inside and outside. We're also
trying to develop support for prisoners
on the outside. So we have programs
where people can write letters to
prisoners. Anyone whose interest in
helping with any of our programs
should call us or come to our office.
(Patty Wood is a member of the
Prisoner's Union, a group of convicts
and ex-cons working to help prisoners.
She is white, from Texas, age 25. The
interview took place in the kitchen of
the Prisoner's Union house on Seventh
Street in San Francisco.)
Daily: How long were you in prison?
Wood: I was in the Women's House of
Detention in New York for eight and a
half months and then they extradicted
me to California and I was in the
county jail at Santa Rita in Alameda
for four and a half months.
Daily: What was the county jail at
Santa Rita like?
Wood: It was terrible.l was put in "the
hole" which is solitary confinement.
There were no windows and you
weren't allowed to smoke. The cell
had a toilet in it, but I couldn't flush
the toilet. The matrons had to flush it.
I had to sleep with my head outside
the covers and six times a night they
put on the overhead light to make sure
I was there.
