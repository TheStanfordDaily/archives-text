# Most SES Recommendations Implemented Quickly

(First of three parts)
In November, 1969, the tenth and
final report of The Study of Education
at Stanford was issued, marking the
completion of a three-year study that
analyzed every aspect of the university
and its functions.
Since then, a constant, if quiet,
process of implementation has taken
place, and most feel that the
implementation of SES
recommendations is now virtually
complete.
Not all recommendations were
approved or even considered, but the
bulk of SES-urged reforms have been
instigated â€” and in a relatively short
time.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs, whose office was one of
SES's proposals, says the
implementation of SES
recommendations has been "both
complete and speedy."
Religion Professor Edwin Good,
who was actively engaged in the
preparation of several SES reports,
says implementation has gone "a
whale of a distance in a remarkably
short time."
The initiative for the study came
late in 1965 from then-President J.E.
Wallace Sterling, who suggested the
need for a new and comprehensive
review of the university's educational
programs.
A 10-member Steering Committee
was appointed during winter quarter
of 1967, with its first reports
appearing in late 1968.
After an introductory report, the

study issued findings and
recommendations in nine areas:
undergraduate education; residences
and campus life, undergraduate
admissions and financial aid; advising
and counseling, the extra-cirriculum;
graduate education; teaching, research
and the faculty; overseas study; and
government of the university.
Focus On Undergraduate Education
Despite the universal scope of the
study, its main focus was on the
quality of undergraduate education. It
is also the area in which the greatest
percentage of SES recommendations
have been realized.
The most apparent change was the
elimination of the old General Studies
Program in the summer of 1969, and
its replacement with the current
distribution requirements. The General
Studies Program was the result of a
previous large-scale work: the Stanford
Study of Undergraduate Education in
1954-56.
SES said the program was marked
by "rigidity, superficiality, selectivity
and unreality." The Steering
Committee, speaking of its own
proposals, said "we are recommending
changes in the structure of
undergraduate education to insure that
our students will have the freedom
necessary to cultivate self-discipline."
Graduation requirements have now
been reduced to the completion of
courses in general academic areas
(humanities, social sciences, and
science and technology). The
university-wide foreign language
requirement has also been dropped.
Another very apparent change came

in grading. Following approval by the
Academic Senate (which must pass on
all such changes), a new grading
program went into effect fall term,
1970.
The old grades of D and F were
eliminated, as were designations of
plus or minus to a grade. Should a
student fail to achieve an A, B or C in

a course, the course is now dropped
entirely from his record. Restrictions
on the number of pass/fail courses
were also eliminated.
According to a not yet fully
analyzed survey by the Academic
Planning Office, three-quarters of the
students questioned said they prefer
the present grading system, although

many doubted whether it promoted an
actual indication of academic
achievement.
Faculty were not as favorable,
however, as only 46% responding to
the survey named it as their first
choice. A larger number added that
the present system would be more
likeable with the addition of plus and
minus modifiers.
SES also placed special emphasis on
the Freshman Seminar Program, urging
its expansion and closer ties with the
advising program. Gibbs says,"the
Freshman Seminar Program is one of
the strongest of the extra-depart
mental programs at Stanford; faculty
participation is strong and student
interest high."
SES proposals have not been
adopted in toto, however. Several
important recommendations have
either been rejected or have received
little attention.
Honors Programs Not Examined
The Undergraduate Education
report urged the creation of an honors
program in which "carefully selected
students would spend their entire
senior year doing independent
work . . . under the guidance of a
faculty member." The plan has
received little, if any, consideration.
The report also urged that courses
no longer be assigned units, but that
requirements be based simply on the
number of courses completed. SES
recommended that a certain number
of courses, rather than the current 180
units, be necessary for graduation.
That idea is still being analyzed.
SES also proposed that Stanford

switch to a semester system, and came
up with three alternative calendars.
The Academic Senate created an ad
hoc committee to study the question.
The committee, chaired by Good,
urged the change to semesters, but the
Senate as a whole rejected the idea.
Included in its "first and most
important recommendation," SES
proposed that a standing Senate
committee be set up "to concern itself
solely with identifying institutional
problems and seeing to it that they
receive attention."
C-US Formed
This role has been filled by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US), first formed in the fall of
1969. Though it grew out of an SES
recommendation and has overseen a
good part of the study's
implementation, the committee is
concerned with more than SES.
Good, this year's chairman, says the
committee "does not conceive of itself
as going from thing to thing in SES,"
and has not been "particularly aware
of its role" in the implementation of
SES proposals.
Good says the C-US, which is
charged by the Senate with monitoring
"the presentation and substance of
undergraduate education," serves, in
his words, "to attempt to foster
innovation of various kinds."
There is "no sense," he says, "that
as an outgrowth of SES, we have a
responsibility for SES." But, he adds,
SES serves as "a constant background"
for the committee's work.
