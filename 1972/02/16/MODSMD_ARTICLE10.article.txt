## Where Are Liberals Now?

An Open Letter to Professors
Marc Mancall and Lincoln Moses
as prototypes. Where are You?
You who are against the war, You
who are against violence, You
who are against the destruction of
property? Where are you now that
a group of students has been
standing in front of the placement
center, non-violently refusing
entrance to military recruiters?
Whare are you now that students
have been milling-in at the
placement center non-violently
protesting interviews by
corporations that live on the
blood of the Vietnamese? Where
are you when students are
arrested for exposing racism,
non-violent.
You who used to flock to the
dorms, to the microphones, to the
platform yes, even to the doors of
draftboards in San Mateo, to tell
the world that you opposed the
war but equally opposed violent
or destructive acts in the name of
peace?
Remember your debates with
the radicals during the Cambodia
strike? The dorm discussions to
convince students that violence is
a self-defeating tactic?
"I agree with your ends," you
used to say, "but not your
means."
"Violence only begets
violence."
"Look at the victories SNCC
won in the south with
non-violence."
"Remember Martin Luther
King."
"Trashing just turns off alot of
people who otherwise could be

counted on to support you."
Where?
So where are you now? Where
is your praise, your support, your
help, your committment to a
movement which has restricted
itself beyond belief? To a
movement which has never
advocated any actions which you
yourself, by your own words,
could not or would not take part
in?
Where are you? Signing
statements deploring one of the
three or four unorganized,
unclaimed acts of "violence" to
occur during this whole period? Is
that where you are?
Four students are being tried
this week for non-violently
disrupting an interview at the
placement center last November.
The procedures by which they are
being tried make southern courts
look like a model of civil liberties.
Even before the preliminary
hearing is completed, the head of
the Judicial Panel which will
ultimately judge their guilt and set
their penalty has been warning
people of the pressures he has
been getting to expel the
defendants.
Stand-By?
Can you stand by and see them
expelled? or even suspended for a
quarter or more? for an act which
might merit a few days in jail at

most if it were done anywhere off
campus?
Or is that the sticky po : \t?
Non-violent tactics are good off
campus, in someone else's
community, or on campus if
espousing them can draw students
away from trashing. Where are
you?
Where are your petitions, your
ads signed by 200 faculty
members, your letter and articles
in the Daily?
Wire
Where are you now, now that
it's come down to the wire? Will
you just let it all happen, or will
you step forward today, even if
only to join with students (you
don't have to fast) in demanding a
moratorium on recruitment at the
placement so that the
recommendations of the
committee on Student Services
can be considered and
implemented in an atmosphere of
rational dialogue.
You have asked for tactics and
demands that the whole
community can get behind. How
much closer to the least common [
denominator can we come?

Non-violent tactics are good off
campus, in someone else's
community, or on campus if
espousing them can draw students
away from trashing. Where are
you?
Where are your petitions, your
ads signed by 200 faculty
members, your letter and articles
in the Daily?
Wire
Where are you now, now that
it's come down to the wire? Will
you just let it all happen, or will
you step forward today, even if
only to join with students (you
don't have to fast) in demanding a
moratorium on recruitment at the
placement so that the
recommendations of the
committee on Student Services
can be considered and
implemented in an atmosphere of
rational dialogue.
You have asked for tactics and
demands that the whole
community can get behind. How
much closer to the least common [
denominator can we come?

as prototypes. Where are You?
You who are against the war, You
who are against violence, You
who are against the destruction of
property? Where are you now that
a group of students has been
standing in front of the placement
center, non-violently refusing
entrance to military recruiters?
Whare are you now that students
have been milling-in at the
placement center non-violently
protesting interviews by
corporations that live on the
blood of the Vietnamese? Where
are you when students are
arrested for exposing racism,
non-violent.
You who used to flock to the
dorms, to the microphones, to the
platform yes, even to the doors of
draftboards in San Mateo, to tell
the world that you opposed the
war but equally opposed violent
or destructive acts in the name of
peace?
Remember your debates with
the radicals during the Cambodia
strike? The dorm discussions to
convince students that violence is
a self-defeating tactic?
"I agree with your ends," you
used to say, "but not your
means."
"Violence only begets
violence."
"Look at the victories SNCC
won in the south with
non-violence."
"Remember Martin Luther
King."
"Trashing just turns off alot of
people who otherwise could be

counted on to support you."
Where?
So where are you now? Where
is your praise, your support, your
help, your committment to a
movement which has restricted
itself beyond belief? To a
movement which has never
advocated any actions which you
yourself, by your own words,
could not or would not take part
in?
Where are you? Signing
statements deploring one of the
three or four unorganized,
unclaimed acts of "violence" to
occur during this whole period? Is
that where you are?
Four students are being tried
this week for non-violently
disrupting an interview at the
placement center last November.
The procedures by which they are
being tried make southern courts
look like a model of civil liberties.
Even before the preliminary
hearing is completed, the head of
the Judicial Panel which will
ultimately judge their guilt and set
their penalty has been warning
people of the pressures he has
been getting to expel the
defendants.
Stand-By?
Can you stand by and see them
expelled? or even suspended for a
quarter or more? for an act which
might merit a few days in jail at

most if it were done anywhere off
campus?
