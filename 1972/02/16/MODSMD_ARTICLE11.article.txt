## Recruiting Is Basic Issue 
### 
Paul loeb

Often obscured behind the debate over the basic illegitimacy of the
C.J.P. is the basic issue on campus of recruitment by the military and
by heavily militarily related corporations. Without this recruiting and
other connections of this campus with U.S. military intervention
around the world we would not now be in the process of being tried
before the C.J. P.
What is at issue here is a question of different perceptions of reality
and of rights in conflict. We view campus recruitment by the military
and by these corporations as the first step in providing the necessary
manpower to continue our military presence (be it with ground troops
or with automated weapons systems) in Asia.
By my calculations we have now spent 18 hours in hearings. As in
recent months the average number of Indochinese killed per hour by
American bombers is twelve. There have been approximately two
hundred and sixteen human beings killed by American planes and
technology while we have sat in the hearing room.
Perceptions
When we act to prevent recruiting by those corporations who make
the bomb delivery systems, the bombs, the planes, and the electronics
which aims the bombs and protects the planes, we are doing it because
our perception of reality tells us that the rights of those people, who
would be alive today were it not for our bombing, take precedence
over the rights of the corporations that produce the materials of war
to recruit at the placement center.
Not only do many of these corporations make weapons which are
clearly designed to cause unnecessary suffering among civilian
populations (such as cluster bombs, anti-personnel mines and fire
bombs) but by producing technology which can begin to largely
replace men with machines (the automated battlefield) these
corporations are concretely prolonging a war in which ground troops
are refusing to fight as in the current situation without the technology
produced by these corporations there would be no choice but for the
U.S. to withdraw.
Just as persons are restrained from shooting others (unless they are
in positions of power) because shooting someone is abridging their
right to live, we must take a moral stand and say that we will not

allow our campus to aid in the basic deprivation of the Indochinese of
their rights to live as free men and women.
Not Ashamed
We who 'disrupted' the interviews of TRW, Honeywell, and G.M.
are not ashamed of our actions. One cannot be penitent about
preventing murder and we ask others to join us to begin to claim our
institution as one which need not serve death and fear but one which
can serve hope and life. I have never heard the sound of impersonal
death from the sky, but we must fight wherever we can to see that
those people who die in Indochina fighting against our planes for the
right to determine their own future do not die in vain.
Next week will see General Dynamics (No. 2 in defense contracts),
McDonnell Douglas (No. 5), Litton Industries (No. 9) and the return
of TRW corp. (No. 34). I for one will be there attempting to enforce
the will of our community that these corporations have no place
conducting their business on our campus. I hope others will join me.

Just as persons are restrained from shooting others (unless they are
in positions of power) because shooting someone is abridging their
right to live, we must take a moral stand and say that we will not

allow our campus to aid in the basic deprivation of the Indochinese of
their rights to live as free men and women.
Not Ashamed
We who 'disrupted' the interviews of TRW, Honeywell, and G.M.
are not ashamed of our actions. One cannot be penitent about
preventing murder and we ask others to join us to begin to claim our
institution as one which need not serve death and fear but one which
can serve hope and life. I have never heard the sound of impersonal
death from the sky, but we must fight wherever we can to see that
those people who die in Indochina fighting against our planes for the
right to determine their own future do not die in vain.
Next week will see General Dynamics (No. 2 in defense contracts),
McDonnell Douglas (No. 5), Litton Industries (No. 9) and the return
of TRW corp. (No. 34). I for one will be there attempting to enforce
the will of our community that these corporations have no place
conducting their business on our campus. I hope others will join me.

Often obscured behind the debate over the basic illegitimacy of the
C.J.P. is the basic issue on campus of recruitment by the military and
by heavily militarily related corporations. Without this recruiting and
other connections of this campus with U.S. military intervention
around the world we would not now be in the process of being tried
before the C.J. P.
What is at issue here is a question of different perceptions of reality
and of rights in conflict. We view campus recruitment by the military
and by these corporations as the first step in providing the necessary
manpower to continue our military presence (be it with ground troops
or with automated weapons systems) in Asia.
By my calculations we have now spent 18 hours in hearings. As in
recent months the average number of Indochinese killed per hour by
American bombers is twelve. There have been approximately two
hundred and sixteen human beings killed by American planes and
technology while we have sat in the hearing room.
Perceptions
When we act to prevent recruiting by those corporations who make
the bomb delivery systems, the bombs, the planes, and the electronics
which aims the bombs and protects the planes, we are doing it because
our perception of reality tells us that the rights of those people, who
would be alive today were it not for our bombing, take precedence
over the rights of the corporations that produce the materials of war
to recruit at the placement center.
Not only do many of these corporations make weapons which are
clearly designed to cause unnecessary suffering among civilian
populations (such as cluster bombs, anti-personnel mines and fire
bombs) but by producing technology which can begin to largely
replace men with machines (the automated battlefield) these
corporations are concretely prolonging a war in which ground troops
are refusing to fight as in the current situation without the technology
produced by these corporations there would be no choice but for the
U.S. to withdraw.
Just as persons are restrained from shooting others (unless they are
in positions of power) because shooting someone is abridging their
right to live, we must take a moral stand and say that we will not

allow our campus to aid in the basic deprivation of the Indochinese of
their rights to live as free men and women.
