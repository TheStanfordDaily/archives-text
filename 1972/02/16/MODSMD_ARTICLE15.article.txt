# Creativity Center Grows Confidently

### CARLA KALLAN 
If an institute that
ostentatiously dubbs itself the
"Center for Creativity and
Growth" would seem to have
optimistic — or even
presumptuous—expectations,
Director Frieda Porat feels
confident that these objectives
will be met.
The Center, an extention of
Goddard College in Plainsfield,
Vermont, was founded in Palo
Alto by Porat together with
other California psychiatrists and
psychologists in July, 1970. Since
that time, it has concentrated
primarily on the areas of gestalt
therapy, marriage and family
problems, and counseling for
single men and women, and
couples. Recently, the Center
achieved the status of a non-profit
organization.
The most innovative aspect of
the Center is its field-work
training program, that leads to a
fully accredited MA degree in
education, psychology, or
counseling from Goddard
College. Each student assumes
responsibility for his own plan of
study. The student

may choose to attend a variety of
seminars, or instead work on a
more one-to-one basis with
individuals. Both appraoches
fulfill the requirements for
completion of the degree.
"The program," emphasizes
Mrs. Porat, "is self-initiating You

are in charge of your own pace, of
your own progress. You know
what subjects you would like to
cover, and what is the best way to
do this."
Credit for projects conducted
through the Center is currently
being offered through the UC

Santa Cruz Extention. Stanford
students have the opportunity to
design their own field-work or
research projects through SCIRE.
It is hoped that ultimately the
Center will serve as a general
training enter for students
working on MA degrees.
