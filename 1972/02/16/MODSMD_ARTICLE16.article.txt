# Advance Registration To Start
## 
### 
Advance registration, complete
registration for Spring Quarter,
will replace preregistration, which
has been only signing class lists
and turning in study list cards.
Class lists may be signed
starting Wednesday, February 23,
at 8:00 a.m. at the Registrar's
Office in the lobby of the Old
Union—by juniors, seniors and
graduates with last names starting
with L and M. Time Schedules
will be available Thursday,
February 17, at the Registrar's
Office in the lobby of the Old
Union.
Students will now be expected
to arrange for payment of fees
before signing class lists. Tuition

grant cards will be available, and
fees can be deferred until Spring
registration day —March
27 -without charge. I.D. cards will
get validating stickers.
New forms called Permit to
Register, PTR's, will replace the
familiar IBM cards. These are 11"
x 15" green and gray forms with
tear-out sections comparable to
the old fee, study list and
information cards.
PTR's for advance registration
will be given to departments and
advisers and may be picked up
starting Tuesday, February 22.
PTR's will be given out by
departments and advisers through
Monday, March 6. Advance

registration may be completed
through March 10.
