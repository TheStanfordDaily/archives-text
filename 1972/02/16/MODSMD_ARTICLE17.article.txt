# Cashier Move
## 
### 
The Encina Cashier Office
will be moved the afternoon of
February 18 to a new location
in the Old Student Union. The
consolidation of the two
offices in the Old Union will
give the cashier enough tellers
to render the services necessary
for advance registration
without students walking to
Encina.
