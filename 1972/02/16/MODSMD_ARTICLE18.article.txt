# Polanski's Brutal Vision
## A 						New 'Macbeth' 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Roman Polanski's "Macbeth," which opens today
at the Music Hall in San Francisco and which was
screened Monday night in Mem Aud, confirms with
the darkness of its vision the basic unlikability of
the play itself. History has proven "Macbeth" to be
one of the most difficult of Shakespeare's tragedies
to perform successfully and I think that it is to
Polanski's credit that, if nothing else, he has taken a
strong and original approach to the material and
stuck by it in driving relentlessly towards the
inevitable ghastly conclusion.
(I attended Monday's screening with some
apprehension, having heard of some unfortunate
audience participation at recent showings of
"McCabe and Mrs. Miller" and "Death in Venice."
However, it was not the overflow crowd that I
should have feared but the quality of the sound
reproduction. At the moment,l have no way of
knowing whether blame rests with the actors, the
print or the sound system at Mem Aud. Whatever
the case, anywhere from a third to a half of the
dialogue was inaudible from the balcony, the worst
victim/culprit being Francesca Annis as Lady
Macbeth, from whom I cannot testify to have
understood any given line in its entirety).
Bleak and Barbaric
Polanski's vision is bleak and barbaric in the
extreme and thus appropriate not only to the
deadly action of the play but to what we know of
conditions in Britain at any time before the
fifteenth century. The temptation of a modernistic
psychological interpretation is resisted, since for the
Shakespeare of "Macbeth" as for authors from
Vergil to Conrad, it is the characters' actions, not
intent, that counts. As much as Freud is attacked
today for, among other things, the sexism he has
perpetrated, among the most successful
Shakespearean productions of late have been those
most conspicuously Freudian in approach and while
"Hamlet" may be a more complex work than
"Macbeth," the fact that its complexities can be
approached psychologically may render it more
accessible to modern audiences.
The pervading gloom and starkness of Polanski's
windswept, rain drenched and cloud covered
Scotland is punctuated to unearthly proportions by
occasional glimpses of a distant sun which, while
casting a cold, sick light, also isolates the action in a
remote physical universe. Removing the action even
further from touch, the two remotely likable
characters, Duncan and Banquo, are dispatched
before the film is half over. Of all the innovations

Polanski introduces, the most successful are those
most subtle and least dwelled upon. A dance
performed around swords stuck in the ground at an
early banquet could be an ancestor to the latter day
Scottish sword dances and the coronation of
Macbeth occurs in an odd circular semi-structure and
thus offers one mm-o possible explanation for the
function of Stonehenge.
King Duncan ironically asks Lady Macbeth to
dance just after she has plotted the king's murder
and when Macbeth is occupied with dark thoughts
before committing the same murder, Polanski
almost magically transforms a circular open air
courtyard into a deep pit, if not the very bottom of
the underworld. Lady Macbeth's serene sleepwalk in
the nude notwithstanding, the only production
value remotely attributable to executive producer
Hugh M. Hefner is the appearance of at least two
dozen wrinkled nude witches around the cauldron,
witches that bear more than a passing resemblance
to the sagging granny of many a Playboy cartoon.
Younger Actors
As with Zeffirelli's immensely popular "Romeo
and Juliet," Polanski's chief innovation was
supposed to have been the casting of actors much
younger than usual in the leading roles. Like
Zeffirelli, he is more successful with the male than
the female. Jon Finch, who played a brief scene as
an unwanted acquaintance of Peter Finch in
"Sunday Bloody Sunday," projects considerable
strength and ambition which, while it may cast
some doubt on his initial hesitancy, renders fully
believable his brutal actions and especially his final
confrontation of Macduff and his followers. Even
considering the inadequate soundtrack, Francesca
Annis' Lady Macbeth is a total washout.
The greatest flaw of the production is the shallow
relationship of the Macbeths themselves, the virtual
nonexistence of Lady Macbeth as a motivating force
or catalyst. Even in death, Macbeth doesn't seem to
give her a second thought and Finch, who holds his
own with the rest of the men in the cast, is least
interesting in the scenes he shares with his leading
lady. Annis' performance is additionally
disappointing in terms of Polanski's career, for the
director has certainly proved himself generous to
young actresses in the past, especially to Catherine
Deneuve in "Repulsion" and Mia Farrow in the
otherwise overrated "Rosemary's Baby."
Using Polanski's present version as a springboard,
I think a much more interesting and convincing
"Macbeth" could retain a male lead of Finch's lean
years but offer a Lady Macbeth in, perhaps, her
mid-forties who goads her younger spouse on to
fouler and fouler deeds while still trying to exercise
her ever-dwindling sexual power. Her position could
be seen as increasingly desperate, with nothing
(certainly not her youth) to lose and everything
(particularly the continuing affection of her
husband) to gain. In this context, Polanski's choice
of having Macbeth practically ignore his wife's death
could have been convincing. However, Macbeth
himself could be made less attractive, allowing an
older, more experienced Lady Macbeth to play off
his sexual insecurity. In this way, the new factors of
the gullibility and recklessness of youth and the
possessiveness and changing needs of middle age
could be brought into play, creating additional
contexts which would have been greatly welcome in
the current production.

When the thought that I would be writing about "Macbeth'" first
presented itself, 1 silently promised that I would not discuss the
murder of Polanski's wife, Sharon Tate, in connection with the film.
Polanski himself publicly hoped that critics would comment upon
his work, not his life. Having seen the film, however, I find that the
issue is unavoidable and that it would be more pretentious to avoid
mentioning the subject than to do so. Both while watching the film
and in retrospect, the violence remains the most thoroughly effective
aspect of the film and when Lady Macduff and her
son are brutally slaughtered by intruders, the connection is direct and
immediate. If Orson Welles' brilliant battle scene in "Falstaff"
conveyed the awkwardness of mass medieval combat, Polanski's
"Macbeth" convinces us of the overwhelming difficulty of
man-to-man dueling when encumbered by a full suit of armor, for it is
all Macbeth and Macduff can do to keep their balance, much less to
strike telling blows on the other's person.
Especially in these supposedly scholarly environs, we must
occasionally be reminded that Shakespeare was and still is intended to
be performed, not only read, and when a performance can be guided
by a sensibility as strong as Polanski's, I think there is cause to be
grateful. Hopefully the days of applauding stagy Hallmark Hall of
Fame productions as the hallmark of quality are over. The problem in
this case is that Polanski, through his very strength, makes an already
disagreeable work seem even more gruesome. "Macbeth" must have
provided Polanski with near-ideal material for self-purging but at the
same time seems a very odd choice for a new production company to
make as a project to inspire confidence for future ventures.

Macbeth occurs in an odd circular semi-structure and
thus offers one mm-o possible explanation for the
function of Stonehenge.
King Duncan ironically asks Lady Macbeth to
dance just after she has plotted the king's murder
and when Macbeth is occupied with dark thoughts
before committing the same murder, Polanski
almost magically transforms a circular open air
courtyard into a deep pit, if not the very bottom of
the underworld. Lady Macbeth's serene sleepwalk in
the nude notwithstanding, the only production
value remotely attributable to executive producer
Hugh M. Hefner is the appearance of at least two
dozen wrinkled nude witches around the cauldron,
witches that bear more than a passing resemblance
to the sagging granny of many a Playboy cartoon.
Younger Actors
As with Zeffirelli's immensely popular "Romeo
and Juliet," Polanski's chief innovation was
supposed to have been the casting of actors much
younger than usual in the leading roles. Like
Zeffirelli, he is more successful with the male than
the female. Jon Finch, who played a brief scene as
an unwanted acquaintance of Peter Finch in
"Sunday Bloody Sunday," projects considerable
strength and ambition which, while it may cast
some doubt on his initial hesitancy, renders fully
believable his brutal actions and especially his final
confrontation of Macduff and his followers. Even
considering the inadequate soundtrack, Francesca
Annis' Lady Macbeth is a total washout.
The greatest flaw of the production is the shallow
relationship of the Macbeths themselves, the virtual
nonexistence of Lady Macbeth as a motivating force
or catalyst. Even in death, Macbeth doesn't seem to
give her a second thought and Finch, who holds his
own with the rest of the men in the cast, is least
interesting in the scenes he shares with his leading
lady. Annis' performance is additionally
disappointing in terms of Polanski's career, for the
director has certainly proved himself generous to
young actresses in the past, especially to Catherine
Deneuve in "Repulsion" and Mia Farrow in the
otherwise overrated "Rosemary's Baby."
Using Polanski's present version as a springboard,
I think a much more interesting and convincing
"Macbeth" could retain a male lead of Finch's lean
years but offer a Lady Macbeth in, perhaps, her
mid-forties who goads her younger spouse on to
fouler and fouler deeds while still trying to exercise
her ever-dwindling sexual power. Her position could
be seen as increasingly desperate, with nothing
(certainly not her youth) to lose and everything
(particularly the continuing affection of her
husband) to gain. In this context, Polanski's choice
of having Macbeth practically ignore his wife's death
could have been convincing. However, Macbeth
himself could be made less attractive, allowing an
older, more experienced Lady Macbeth to play off
his sexual insecurity. In this way, the new factors of
the gullibility and recklessness of youth and the
possessiveness and changing needs of middle age
could be brought into play, creating additional
contexts which would have been greatly welcome in
the current production.

When the thought that I would be writing about "Macbeth'" first
presented itself, 1 silently promised that I would not discuss the
murder of Polanski's wife, Sharon Tate, in connection with the film.
Polanski himself publicly hoped that critics would comment upon
his work, not his life. Having seen the film, however, I find that the
issue is unavoidable and that it would be more pretentious to avoid
mentioning the subject than to do so. Both while watching the film
and in retrospect, the violence remains the most thoroughly effective
aspect of the film and when Lady Macduff and her
son are brutally slaughtered by intruders, the connection is direct and
immediate. If Orson Welles' brilliant battle scene in "Falstaff"
conveyed the awkwardness of mass medieval combat, Polanski's
"Macbeth" convinces us of the overwhelming difficulty of
man-to-man dueling when encumbered by a full suit of armor, for it is
all Macbeth and Macduff can do to keep their balance, much less to
strike telling blows on the other's person.
Especially in these supposedly scholarly environs, we must
occasionally be reminded that Shakespeare was and still is intended to
be performed, not only read, and when a performance can be guided
by a sensibility as strong as Polanski's, I think there is cause to be
grateful. Hopefully the days of applauding stagy Hallmark Hall of
Fame productions as the hallmark of quality are over. The problem in
this case is that Polanski, through his very strength, makes an already
disagreeable work seem even more gruesome. "Macbeth" must have
provided Polanski with near-ideal material for self-purging but at the
same time seems a very odd choice for a new production company to
make as a project to inspire confidence for future ventures.

BARBER OF SEVlLLE—Shigemi Matsumoto (Rosina) and Alan Titus
(Figaro) star in the Spring Opera Theater's production of Rossini's
"Barber of Seville." The opera is currently in repertory at the Curran
Theater in San Francisco.
Roman Polanski's "Macbeth," which opens today
at the Music Hall in San Francisco and which was
screened Monday night in Mem Aud, confirms with
the darkness of its vision the basic unlikability of
the play itself. History has proven "Macbeth" to be
one of the most difficult of Shakespeare's tragedies
to perform successfully and I think that it is to
Polanski's credit that, if nothing else, he has taken a
strong and original approach to the material and
stuck by it in driving relentlessly towards the
inevitable ghastly conclusion.
(I attended Monday's screening with some
apprehension, having heard of some unfortunate
audience participation at recent showings of
"McCabe and Mrs. Miller" and "Death in Venice."
However, it was not the overflow crowd that I
should have feared but the quality of the sound
reproduction. At the moment,l have no way of
knowing whether blame rests with the actors, the
print or the sound system at Mem Aud. Whatever
the case, anywhere from a third to a half of the
dialogue was inaudible from the balcony, the worst
victim/culprit being Francesca Annis as Lady
Macbeth, from whom I cannot testify to have
understood any given line in its entirety).
Bleak and Barbaric
Polanski's vision is bleak and barbaric in the
extreme and thus appropriate not only to the
deadly action of the play but to what we know of
conditions in Britain at any time before the
fifteenth century. The temptation of a modernistic
psychological interpretation is resisted, since for the
Shakespeare of "Macbeth" as for authors from
Vergil to Conrad, it is the characters' actions, not
intent, that counts. As much as Freud is attacked
today for, among other things, the sexism he has
perpetrated, among the most successful
Shakespearean productions of late have been those
most conspicuously Freudian in approach and while
"Hamlet" may be a more complex work than
"Macbeth," the fact that its complexities can be
approached psychologically may render it more
accessible to modern audiences.
The pervading gloom and starkness of Polanski's
windswept, rain drenched and cloud covered
Scotland is punctuated to unearthly proportions by
occasional glimpses of a distant sun which, while
casting a cold, sick light, also isolates the action in a
remote physical universe. Removing the action even
further from touch, the two remotely likable
characters, Duncan and Banquo, are dispatched
before the film is half over. Of all the innovations

Polanski introduces, the most successful are those
most subtle and least dwelled upon. A dance
performed around swords stuck in the ground at an
early banquet could be an ancestor to the latter day
Scottish sword dances and the coronation of
Macbeth occurs in an odd circular semi-structure and
thus offers one mm-o possible explanation for the
function of Stonehenge.

himself could be made less attractive, allowing an
older, more experienced Lady Macbeth to play off
his sexual insecurity. In this way, the new factors of
the gullibility and recklessness of youth and the
possessiveness and changing needs of middle age
could be brought into play, creating additional
contexts which would have been greatly welcome in
the current production.

When the thought that I would be writing about "Macbeth'" first
presented itself, 1 silently promised that I would not discuss the
murder of Polanski's wife, Sharon Tate, in connection with the film.
Polanski himself publicly hoped that critics would comment upon
his work, not his life. Having seen the film, however, I find that the
issue is unavoidable and that it would be more pretentious to avoid
mentioning the subject than to do so. Both while watching the film
and in retrospect, the violence remains the most thoroughly effective
aspect of the film and when Lady Macduff and her
son are brutally slaughtered by intruders, the connection is direct and
immediate. If Orson Welles' brilliant battle scene in "Falstaff"
conveyed the awkwardness of mass medieval combat, Polanski's
"Macbeth" convinces us of the overwhelming difficulty of
man-to-man dueling when encumbered by a full suit of armor, for it is
all Macbeth and Macduff can do to keep their balance, much less to
strike telling blows on the other's person.
Especially in these supposedly scholarly environs, we must
occasionally be reminded that Shakespeare was and still is intended to
be performed, not only read, and when a performance can be guided
by a sensibility as strong as Polanski's, I think there is cause to be
grateful. Hopefully the days of applauding stagy Hallmark Hall of
Fame productions as the hallmark of quality are over. The problem in
this case is that Polanski, through his very strength, makes an already
disagreeable work seem even more gruesome. "Macbeth" must have
provided Polanski with near-ideal material for self-purging but at the
same time seems a very odd choice for a new production company to
make as a project to inspire confidence for future ventures.

BARBER OF SEVlLLE—Shigemi Matsumoto (Rosina) and Alan Titus
(Figaro) star in the Spring Opera Theater's production of Rossini's
"Barber of Seville." The opera is currently in repertory at the Curran
Theater in San Francisco.
Roman Polanski's "Macbeth," which opens today
at the Music Hall in San Francisco and which was
screened Monday night in Mem Aud, confirms with
the darkness of its vision the basic unlikability of
the play itself. History has proven "Macbeth" to be
one of the most difficult of Shakespeare's tragedies
to perform successfully and I think that it is to
Polanski's credit that, if nothing else, he has taken a
strong and original approach to the material and
stuck by it in driving relentlessly towards the
inevitable ghastly conclusion.
(I attended Monday's screening with some
apprehension, having heard of some unfortunate
audience participation at recent showings of
"McCabe and Mrs. Miller" and "Death in Venice."
However, it was not the overflow crowd that I
should have feared but the quality of the sound
reproduction. At the moment,l have no way of
knowing whether blame rests with the actors, the
print or the sound system at Mem Aud. Whatever
the case, anywhere from a third to a half of the
dialogue was inaudible from the balcony, the worst
victim/culprit being Francesca Annis as Lady
Macbeth, from whom I cannot testify to have
understood any given line in its entirety).
Bleak and Barbaric
Polanski's vision is bleak and barbaric in the
extreme and thus appropriate not only to the
deadly action of the play but to what we know of
conditions in Britain at any time before the
fifteenth century. The temptation of a modernistic
psychological interpretation is resisted, since for the
Shakespeare of "Macbeth" as for authors from
Vergil to Conrad, it is the characters' actions, not
intent, that counts. As much as Freud is attacked
today for, among other things, the sexism he has
perpetrated, among the most successful
Shakespearean productions of late have been those
most conspicuously Freudian in approach and while
"Hamlet" may be a more complex work than
"Macbeth," the fact that its complexities can be
approached psychologically may render it more
accessible to modern audiences.
The pervading gloom and starkness of Polanski's
windswept, rain drenched and cloud covered
Scotland is punctuated to unearthly proportions by
occasional glimpses of a distant sun which, while
casting a cold, sick light, also isolates the action in a
remote physical universe. Removing the action even
further from touch, the two remotely likable
characters, Duncan and Banquo, are dispatched
before the film is half over. Of all the innovations

Polanski introduces, the most successful are those
most subtle and least dwelled upon. A dance
performed around swords stuck in the ground at an
early banquet could be an ancestor to the latter day
Scottish sword dances and the coronation of
Macbeth occurs in an odd circular semi-structure and
thus offers one mm-o possible explanation for the
function of Stonehenge.
King Duncan ironically asks Lady Macbeth to
dance just after she has plotted the king's murder
and when Macbeth is occupied with dark thoughts
before committing the same murder, Polanski
almost magically transforms a circular open air
courtyard into a deep pit, if not the very bottom of
the underworld. Lady Macbeth's serene sleepwalk in
the nude notwithstanding, the only production
value remotely attributable to executive producer
Hugh M. Hefner is the appearance of at least two
dozen wrinkled nude witches around the cauldron,
witches that bear more than a passing resemblance
to the sagging granny of many a Playboy cartoon.
Younger Actors
As with Zeffirelli's immensely popular "Romeo
and Juliet," Polanski's chief innovation was
supposed to have been the casting of actors much
younger than usual in the leading roles. Like
Zeffirelli, he is more successful with the male than
the female. Jon Finch, who played a brief scene as
an unwanted acquaintance of Peter Finch in
"Sunday Bloody Sunday," projects considerable
strength and ambition which, while it may cast
some doubt on his initial hesitancy, renders fully
believable his brutal actions and especially his final
confrontation of Macduff and his followers. Even
considering the inadequate soundtrack, Francesca
Annis' Lady Macbeth is a total washout.
The greatest flaw of the production is the shallow
relationship of the Macbeths themselves, the virtual
nonexistence of Lady Macbeth as a motivating force
or catalyst. Even in death, Macbeth doesn't seem to
give her a second thought and Finch, who holds his
own with the rest of the men in the cast, is least
interesting in the scenes he shares with his leading
lady. Annis' performance is additionally
disappointing in terms of Polanski's career, for the
director has certainly proved himself generous to
young actresses in the past, especially to Catherine
Deneuve in "Repulsion" and Mia Farrow in the
otherwise overrated "Rosemary's Baby."
Using Polanski's present version as a springboard,
I think a much more interesting and convincing
"Macbeth" could retain a male lead of Finch's lean
years but offer a Lady Macbeth in, perhaps, her
mid-forties who goads her younger spouse on to
fouler and fouler deeds while still trying to exercise
her ever-dwindling sexual power. Her position could
be seen as increasingly desperate, with nothing
(certainly not her youth) to lose and everything
(particularly the continuing affection of her
husband) to gain. In this context, Polanski's choice
of having Macbeth practically ignore his wife's death
could have been convincing. However, Macbeth
himself could be made less attractive, allowing an
older, more experienced Lady Macbeth to play off
his sexual insecurity. In this way, the new factors of
