# Delightful Opening For Spring Opera
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
A few days early, the Spring Opera Theater gave San Franeisco a
frilly, frivolous—but delightful—valentine in its opening night "Barber
of Seville" last Friday. While the stage setting for Rossini's buoyant
comedy certainly looked like a valentine card (much lace-work, bright
colors, dancing lights), the style of the production can only be
described as Early Hellzapoppin.
While a few timid glances at the commcdia dellarte tradition of
Italian comedy were noticeable, Richard Pearlman's direction paid its
primary debt to the vaudevillian choreographic tradition and the
shameless melodrama of the hiss-the-villain sort. Fortunately,
Rossini's music and plot are so sturdily put together—and the comedy
so eternally relevant—that the "Barber" stood up even under the
terrible burden of unbridled comic invention. Lesser operas would
have collapsed into unfunny chaos.
The result of this unabashed angling for laughter is a far more
complexly staged and detailed "Barber" than one could every expect
in a big opera house. The long rehearsal schedule necessary to pull it
off would be prohibitive with expensive singers and full orchestra.
And a cast of older, more prominent singers would probably not show
the unself-conscious flexibility that this production required.
The exuberant, young cast rose as one to the challenges of the
director's stylized choreography (Rossini's music is highly danceablc),
extravagant prat-falling, and mugging. And even then the singers were
sometimes too breathless to sing according to their abilities.
Leading a cast that was remarkabley supple both in voice and stage
presence was Alan Titus as the know-it-all barber, Figaro. Titus,
currently riding the crest of Bernstein's popular "Mass" for which he
was the Celebrant, has made the move from culture-hero to comic
hero seem easy. Figaro hasn't an ounce of humility and the only thing
that can save him (or the baritone singing his part) is sheer charisma.
Titus has charisma and much more: a fine figure, utter nonchalance
on stage, and a very pleasing, agile and well-focused voice. Should he
manage to avoid an occasional crack, and should his voice grow in
size, the part of Figaro could become his personal property. Titus,
incidentally, can also juggle, play the guitar, and do a nice hand-stand.
Shigemi Matsumoto's coloratura singing as the cunning little vixen
Rosina was nearly flawless. Nothing could be more mellow and
effortless than her cascading ornamentation, especially in low and
mid-range. Indeed, the only area of strain still remains the higher
reaches, where some harshness and vibrato impinge.
The role of Count Almaviva (disguised lover of Rosina, who is ward
to Dr. Bartolo, who himself wants to marry Rosina) requires great
dexterity and musicianship, and tenor John Walker filled these needs
with his best performance to date. Though his tone needs still to grow
warmer and less pinched, the intelligence of his singing cannot be
denied.
As Dr. Bartolo—the opera's representative from the supercilious
older generation—Daniel Sullivan was quite enjoyable, though I felt
now and then that he was at his wit's end to do all his stage business.
Sullivan's baritone served him best in the patter sections and failed
him only when real brow-beating volume was needed. His castrato
voice (I cast no aspersions!) was hilariously good.
As the irrepressibly conniving Don Basilio, Philip Booth gave us the
kind of oily, wicked—and lovable—villain which is firmly in the augst
tradition of Snidely Whiplash.
As the down-trodden time-betrayed servant, mezzo Donna Petersen
was deservedly applauded. The conclusion she reaches in her big
aria—that we must learn to love ourselves—comes close to the
mechanism of all comedy, and this opera in particular. It is self-love
that makes all the characters so interesting and—when come-uppances
are distributed—so amusing. But the point of the opera, 1 think, is that
self-love isolates, is anti-social, and eventually leads to a downfall of
one sort or another.
The finale of the production translates this idea into the typically
modern and brutal zero-sum formulation: LOVE OR PERISH. I
wouldn't phrase the "message" of the opera (and Rossini would have
been appalled to find there is one) quite so harshly. Still, the Spring
Opera has the right idea.

incidentally, can also juggle, play the guitar, and do a nice hand-stand.
Shigemi Matsumoto's coloratura singing as the cunning little vixen
Rosina was nearly flawless. Nothing could be more mellow and
effortless than her cascading ornamentation, especially in low and
mid-range. Indeed, the only area of strain still remains the higher
reaches, where some harshness and vibrato impinge.
The role of Count Almaviva (disguised lover of Rosina, who is ward
to Dr. Bartolo, who himself wants to marry Rosina) requires great
dexterity and musicianship, and tenor John Walker filled these needs
with his best performance to date. Though his tone needs still to grow
warmer and less pinched, the intelligence of his singing cannot be
denied.
As Dr. Bartolo—the opera's representative from the supercilious
older generation—Daniel Sullivan was quite enjoyable, though I felt
now and then that he was at his wit's end to do all his stage business.
Sullivan's baritone served him best in the patter sections and failed
him only when real brow-beating volume was needed. His castrato
voice (I cast no aspersions!) was hilariously good.
As the irrepressibly conniving Don Basilio, Philip Booth gave us the
kind of oily, wicked—and lovable—villain which is firmly in the augst
tradition of Snidely Whiplash.
As the down-trodden time-betrayed servant, mezzo Donna Petersen
was deservedly applauded. The conclusion she reaches in her big
aria—that we must learn to love ourselves—comes close to the
mechanism of all comedy, and this opera in particular. It is self-love
that makes all the characters so interesting and—when come-uppances
are distributed—so amusing. But the point of the opera, 1 think, is that
self-love isolates, is anti-social, and eventually leads to a downfall of
one sort or another.
The finale of the production translates this idea into the typically
modern and brutal zero-sum formulation: LOVE OR PERISH. I
wouldn't phrase the "message" of the opera (and Rossini would have
been appalled to find there is one) quite so harshly. Still, the Spring
Opera has the right idea.

Curran Theater in San Francisco.)
A few days early, the Spring Opera Theater gave San Franeisco a
frilly, frivolous—but delightful—valentine in its opening night "Barber
of Seville" last Friday. While the stage setting for Rossini's buoyant
comedy certainly looked like a valentine card (much lace-work, bright
colors, dancing lights), the style of the production can only be
described as Early Hellzapoppin.
While a few timid glances at the commcdia dellarte tradition of
Italian comedy were noticeable, Richard Pearlman's direction paid its
primary debt to the vaudevillian choreographic tradition and the
shameless melodrama of the hiss-the-villain sort. Fortunately,
Rossini's music and plot are so sturdily put together—and the comedy
so eternally relevant—that the "Barber" stood up even under the
terrible burden of unbridled comic invention. Lesser operas would
have collapsed into unfunny chaos.
The result of this unabashed angling for laughter is a far more
complexly staged and detailed "Barber" than one could every expect
in a big opera house. The long rehearsal schedule necessary to pull it
off would be prohibitive with expensive singers and full orchestra.
And a cast of older, more prominent singers would probably not show
the unself-conscious flexibility that this production required.
The exuberant, young cast rose as one to the challenges of the
director's stylized choreography (Rossini's music is highly danceablc),
extravagant prat-falling, and mugging. And even then the singers were
sometimes too breathless to sing according to their abilities.
Leading a cast that was remarkabley supple both in voice and stage
presence was Alan Titus as the know-it-all barber, Figaro. Titus,
currently riding the crest of Bernstein's popular "Mass" for which he
was the Celebrant, has made the move from culture-hero to comic
hero seem easy. Figaro hasn't an ounce of humility and the only thing
that can save him (or the baritone singing his part) is sheer charisma.
Titus has charisma and much more: a fine figure, utter nonchalance
on stage, and a very pleasing, agile and well-focused voice. Should he
manage to avoid an occasional crack, and should his voice grow in
size, the part of Figaro could become his personal property. Titus,
incidentally, can also juggle, play the guitar, and do a nice hand-stand.
