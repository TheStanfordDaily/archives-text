# Student Body To Vote Again On Child Day Care Center
## 
### DANIEL BRENNER 
Tomorrow and Friday Stanford
students will again vote whether or not
to assess themselves one dollar to pay
for permanent improvements at the
Children's Center of the Stanford
Community (CCSC).
The Center, an incorporated
tax-exempt day care facility, needs the
funds to bring its premises up to state
licensing standards.
The referendum funds would
provide for scholarships, structural
remodeling, and capital equipment like
washers, dryers, dishwashers, and
playground equipment. According to
the budget outline released by the
Center, no money would go for
operating costs which CCSC currently
covers with fees collected from parents
using the center.
Opposition to the assessment
centers around questions of whether
students should be forced to pay for
services they will not receive, the
emotional appeal of the
pro-assessment campaign, and the
possibility of repeat requests for
money.
Located in an old elementary
school on Mayfield Avenue at Santa
Ynez, CCSC provides two programs
which serve its 102 families. The Day
Care Center, for children two and a
half to five and a half, uses two
classrooms and provides scheduled half
or full day care for the children of
Stanford faculty, staff, and students.
The Little Kids' Place cares for infants
over nine months and children under
two and a half on an hourly basis in
one big room, a school auditorium.
Some Provision
"Every community should make
some provision for day care," says
sophomore Beth Garfield, who, with
Kathy Waller is co-sponsoring the
ASSU Senate initiative. "I don't see
why Stanford students should be an
exception," she adds.
But Robin Freedman, who along

with Chris Hocker is organizing the
opposition to the assessment, disagrees
that all students should be asked to
support CCSC. "Those people who
want to vote for $1 should just
voluntarily give it," she said.
Among Bay Area universities,
Stanford is one of the few institutions
not giving large-scale child care. In
Spring 1970 the ASSU Senate
allocated $1600 to the Childrens'
Center. $1000 was used as seed money
for the salaries of the Little Kids'
Place, $600 for heavy duty play
equipment.
But last . fall an assessment
referendum was defeated. "I don't
think students knew how the Center
would spend the money. They should
have another chance to vote on the
issue," Garfield says.
At UC Berkeley, the student body
assessed itself 50 cents per quarter to
provide three large day care centers.
Foothill College students have given
$8,500 to their center which provides
for $10 per month unlimited day care
to students' children. And Sacramento
State students allocated $35,000 for
an on-campus center.
According to CCSC, the
referendum is not calling for
permanent day-to-day operating
expenses but for a one-time outlay for
necessary improvements. The
organizers of the group realize that
most Stanford students have no direct
use of the facility but contend there is
no other funding source available until
they are licensed by the state, which
won't happen until they can make the
necessary improvements.
Opened In 1969
The Center began in 1969 with a
single room at the Children's
Convalescent Hospital, a part-day
program and one teacher. Today, with
a staff of 14 it still maintains the
character of an improvised program
with what appears to be a bare
minimum of available facilities.

The Center's monthly operating
funds come from fees collected on a
graduated scale of payments, ranging
from $52.50 to $92.50 a month for
the Day Care Program and 60 cents to
$1 an hour at the Little Kids' Place.
Costs for full time care elsewhere in
the Palo Alto area run from $90 to
$100 per month. During 1970-71 the
Center's total income was $35,178.14
of which $31,630.94 went to pay the
teachers employed by the two
programs. Tim Cobum, who opposes
the assessment, has stressed the lack of
volunteerism on the part of husbands
whose wives use the Center.
A prerequisite for using the
Children's Center facility is that one
parent must be connected in some way
to the University. About half of the
parents taking advantage of the facility
are students, with the other half being
Stanford faculty and staff.
The Day Care Center is open from
7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. daily and the
Little Kids' Place is available for child
supervision on an hourly basis from
7:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. No sign-up is
required for use of the Little Kids'
Place. Both programs are currently
running at the limit of their capacity.
Free House
The school house was granted to
CCSC by the University Land Use
Committee on an annual basis for free.
But the costs of renovating the
facility, to bring it up to the revised
state licensing standards must be borne
by CCSC, which cannot raise funds
from regular income.
For instance, one state day care
center requirement calls for hot
lunches for each child. In order to do
this, dishwashers must be purchased,
and county health codes insist that the
machines must have a 180 degree
Farenheit rinse cycle. As Judy
Sanchez, a board member and working
mother notes, the two requirements
mean that the Center must buy the
most expensive non-institutional
dishwasher because it is the only one
which meets county standards.

Other physical improvements for
the Center that the CCSC intends to
implement with assessment funds
include: hot water installation in
bathrooms and classrooms; improved
front yard drainage; kitchen
equipment in order to prepare hot
lunches; and washing equipment to
satisfy state codes requiring that all
bedding used by a child be washed
each day.
Misdemeanor
The necessity for making these
physical improvements comes from a
state law making it a misdemeanor to
operate an unlicensed child care
facility. Although the state licensing
agency, the Department of Social
Welfare, has taken a benevolent
approach about prosecuting, Sanchez
notes, unless the improvements are
made and the Center becomes eligible
for licensing, CCSC faces the
possibility of being closed down.
Efforts to open other funding
sources besides referendum
assessments have been unsuccessful.
Volunteer assessments for these
outlays have raised only $250. While
allowing CCSC to use the buildings
rent-free, the University, in the process
of cutting back some educational
programs through the Budget
Adjustment Program, is hesitant to
assume full funding of the Center.
Federal money, sparse at best, is not
available for capital expenditures
which the Center needs in order to be
eligible for state licensing and possible
state aid.
Besides being eligible for licensing,
CCSC would become "more attractive
to outside funding sources" if the
referendum succeeds, Sanchez notes.
For instance CCSC has filed with the
United Fund for on-going support but
as yet has not been granted any.
The controversy over tomorrow's
referendum centers on whether or not
students should support what CCSC
people believe will be a one-time
capital expenditures outlay for major
improvements of the Center. The
assessment would then supposedly
clear the way for state licensing and
open up other channels for further
large assistance.

have another chance to vote on the
issue," Garfield says.
At UC Berkeley, the student body
assessed itself 50 cents per quarter to
provide three large day care centers.
Foothill College students have given
$8,500 to their center which provides
for $10 per month unlimited day care
to students' children. And Sacramento
State students allocated $35,000 for
an on-campus center.
According to CCSC, the
referendum is not calling for
permanent day-to-day operating
expenses but for a one-time outlay for
necessary improvements. The
organizers of the group realize that
most Stanford students have no direct
use of the facility but contend there is
no other funding source available until
they are licensed by the state, which
won't happen until they can make the
necessary improvements.
Opened In 1969
The Center began in 1969 with a
single room at the Children's
Convalescent Hospital, a part-day
program and one teacher. Today, with
a staff of 14 it still maintains the
character of an improvised program
with what appears to be a bare
minimum of available facilities.

The Center's monthly operating
funds come from fees collected on a
graduated scale of payments, ranging
from $52.50 to $92.50 a month for
the Day Care Program and 60 cents to
$1 an hour at the Little Kids' Place.
Costs for full time care elsewhere in
the Palo Alto area run from $90 to
$100 per month. During 1970-71 the
Center's total income was $35,178.14
of which $31,630.94 went to pay the
teachers employed by the two
programs. Tim Cobum, who opposes
the assessment, has stressed the lack of
volunteerism on the part of husbands
whose wives use the Center.
A prerequisite for using the
Children's Center facility is that one
parent must be connected in some way
to the University. About half of the
parents taking advantage of the facility
are students, with the other half being
Stanford faculty and staff.
The Day Care Center is open from
7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. daily and the
Little Kids' Place is available for child
supervision on an hourly basis from
7:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. No sign-up is
required for use of the Little Kids'
Place. Both programs are currently
running at the limit of their capacity.
Free House
The school house was granted to
CCSC by the University Land Use
Committee on an annual basis for free.
But the costs of renovating the
facility, to bring it up to the revised
state licensing standards must be borne
by CCSC, which cannot raise funds
from regular income.
For instance, one state day care
center requirement calls for hot
lunches for each child. In order to do
this, dishwashers must be purchased,
and county health codes insist that the
machines must have a 180 degree
Farenheit rinse cycle. As Judy
Sanchez, a board member and working
mother notes, the two requirements
mean that the Center must buy the
most expensive non-institutional
dishwasher because it is the only one
which meets county standards.

Other physical improvements for
the Center that the CCSC intends to
implement with assessment funds
include: hot water installation in
bathrooms and classrooms; improved
front yard drainage; kitchen
equipment in order to prepare hot
lunches; and washing equipment to
satisfy state codes requiring that all
bedding used by a child be washed
each day.
Misdemeanor
The necessity for making these
physical improvements comes from a
state law making it a misdemeanor to
operate an unlicensed child care
facility. Although the state licensing
agency, the Department of Social
Welfare, has taken a benevolent
approach about prosecuting, Sanchez
notes, unless the improvements are
made and the Center becomes eligible
for licensing, CCSC faces the
possibility of being closed down.
Efforts to open other funding
sources besides referendum
assessments have been unsuccessful.
Volunteer assessments for these
outlays have raised only $250. While
allowing CCSC to use the buildings
rent-free, the University, in the process
of cutting back some educational
programs through the Budget
Adjustment Program, is hesitant to
assume full funding of the Center.
Federal money, sparse at best, is not
available for capital expenditures
which the Center needs in order to be
eligible for state licensing and possible
state aid.
Besides being eligible for licensing,
CCSC would become "more attractive
to outside funding sources" if the
referendum succeeds, Sanchez notes.
For instance CCSC has filed with the
United Fund for on-going support but
as yet has not been granted any.
The controversy over tomorrow's
referendum centers on whether or not
students should support what CCSC
people believe will be a one-time
capital expenditures outlay for major
improvements of the Center. The
assessment would then supposedly
clear the way for state licensing and
open up other channels for further
large assistance.
Tomorrow and Friday Stanford
students will again vote whether or not
to assess themselves one dollar to pay
for permanent improvements at the
Children's Center of the Stanford
Community (CCSC).
The Center, an incorporated
tax-exempt day care facility, needs the
funds to bring its premises up to state
licensing standards.
The referendum funds would
provide for scholarships, structural
remodeling, and capital equipment like
washers, dryers, dishwashers, and
playground equipment. According to
the budget outline released by the
Center, no money would go for
operating costs which CCSC currently
covers with fees collected from parents
using the center.
Opposition to the assessment
centers around questions of whether
students should be forced to pay for
services they will not receive, the
emotional appeal of the
pro-assessment campaign, and the
possibility of repeat requests for
money.
Located in an old elementary
school on Mayfield Avenue at Santa
Ynez, CCSC provides two programs
which serve its 102 families. The Day
Care Center, for children two and a
half to five and a half, uses two
classrooms and provides scheduled half
or full day care for the children of
Stanford faculty, staff, and students.
The Little Kids' Place cares for infants
over nine months and children under
two and a half on an hourly basis in
one big room, a school auditorium.
Some Provision
"Every community should make
some provision for day care," says
sophomore Beth Garfield, who, with
Kathy Waller is co-sponsoring the
ASSU Senate initiative. "I don't see
why Stanford students should be an
exception," she adds.
But Robin Freedman, who along

with Chris Hocker is organizing the
opposition to the assessment, disagrees
that all students should be asked to
support CCSC. "Those people who
want to vote for $1 should just
voluntarily give it," she said.
Among Bay Area universities,
Stanford is one of the few institutions
not giving large-scale child care. In
Spring 1970 the ASSU Senate
allocated $1600 to the Childrens'
Center. $1000 was used as seed money
for the salaries of the Little Kids'
Place, $600 for heavy duty play
equipment.
But last . fall an assessment
referendum was defeated. "I don't
think students knew how the Center
would spend the money. They should
have another chance to vote on the
issue," Garfield says.

7:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. No sign-up is
required for use of the Little Kids'
Place. Both programs are currently
running at the limit of their capacity.
Free House
The school house was granted to
CCSC by the University Land Use
Committee on an annual basis for free.
But the costs of renovating the
facility, to bring it up to the revised
state licensing standards must be borne
by CCSC, which cannot raise funds
from regular income.
For instance, one state day care
center requirement calls for hot
lunches for each child. In order to do
this, dishwashers must be purchased,
and county health codes insist that the
machines must have a 180 degree
Farenheit rinse cycle. As Judy
Sanchez, a board member and working
mother notes, the two requirements
mean that the Center must buy the
most expensive non-institutional
dishwasher because it is the only one
which meets county standards.

Other physical improvements for
the Center that the CCSC intends to
implement with assessment funds
include: hot water installation in
bathrooms and classrooms; improved
front yard drainage; kitchen
equipment in order to prepare hot
lunches; and washing equipment to
satisfy state codes requiring that all
bedding used by a child be washed
each day.
Misdemeanor
The necessity for making these
physical improvements comes from a
state law making it a misdemeanor to
operate an unlicensed child care
facility. Although the state licensing
agency, the Department of Social
Welfare, has taken a benevolent
approach about prosecuting, Sanchez
notes, unless the improvements are
made and the Center becomes eligible
for licensing, CCSC faces the
possibility of being closed down.
Efforts to open other funding
sources besides referendum
assessments have been unsuccessful.
Volunteer assessments for these
outlays have raised only $250. While
allowing CCSC to use the buildings
rent-free, the University, in the process
of cutting back some educational
programs through the Budget
Adjustment Program, is hesitant to
assume full funding of the Center.
Federal money, sparse at best, is not
available for capital expenditures
which the Center needs in order to be
eligible for state licensing and possible
state aid.
Besides being eligible for licensing,
CCSC would become "more attractive
to outside funding sources" if the
referendum succeeds, Sanchez notes.
For instance CCSC has filed with the
United Fund for on-going support but
as yet has not been granted any.
The controversy over tomorrow's
referendum centers on whether or not
students should support what CCSC
people believe will be a one-time
capital expenditures outlay for major
improvements of the Center. The
assessment would then supposedly
clear the way for state licensing and
open up other channels for further
large assistance.
Tomorrow and Friday Stanford
students will again vote whether or not
to assess themselves one dollar to pay
for permanent improvements at the
Children's Center of the Stanford
Community (CCSC).
The Center, an incorporated
tax-exempt day care facility, needs the
funds to bring its premises up to state
licensing standards.
The referendum funds would
provide for scholarships, structural
remodeling, and capital equipment like
washers, dryers, dishwashers, and
playground equipment. According to
the budget outline released by the
Center, no money would go for
operating costs which CCSC currently
covers with fees collected from parents
using the center.
Opposition to the assessment
centers around questions of whether
students should be forced to pay for
services they will not receive, the
emotional appeal of the
pro-assessment campaign, and the
possibility of repeat requests for
money.
Located in an old elementary
school on Mayfield Avenue at Santa
Ynez, CCSC provides two programs
which serve its 102 families. The Day
Care Center, for children two and a
half to five and a half, uses two
classrooms and provides scheduled half
or full day care for the children of
Stanford faculty, staff, and students.
The Little Kids' Place cares for infants
over nine months and children under
two and a half on an hourly basis in
one big room, a school auditorium.
Some Provision
"Every community should make
some provision for day care," says
sophomore Beth Garfield, who, with
Kathy Waller is co-sponsoring the
ASSU Senate initiative. "I don't see
why Stanford students should be an
exception," she adds.
But Robin Freedman, who along

with Chris Hocker is organizing the
opposition to the assessment, disagrees
that all students should be asked to
support CCSC. "Those people who
want to vote for $1 should just
voluntarily give it," she said.
Among Bay Area universities,
Stanford is one of the few institutions
not giving large-scale child care. In
Spring 1970 the ASSU Senate
allocated $1600 to the Childrens'
Center. $1000 was used as seed money
for the salaries of the Little Kids'
Place, $600 for heavy duty play
equipment.
But last . fall an assessment
referendum was defeated. "I don't
think students knew how the Center
would spend the money. They should
have another chance to vote on the
issue," Garfield says.
At UC Berkeley, the student body
assessed itself 50 cents per quarter to
provide three large day care centers.
Foothill College students have given
$8,500 to their center which provides
for $10 per month unlimited day care
to students' children. And Sacramento
State students allocated $35,000 for
an on-campus center.
According to CCSC, the
referendum is not calling for
permanent day-to-day operating
expenses but for a one-time outlay for
necessary improvements. The
organizers of the group realize that
most Stanford students have no direct
use of the facility but contend there is
no other funding source available until
they are licensed by the state, which
won't happen until they can make the
necessary improvements.
Opened In 1969
The Center began in 1969 with a
single room at the Children's
Convalescent Hospital, a part-day
program and one teacher. Today, with
a staff of 14 it still maintains the
character of an improvised program
with what appears to be a bare
minimum of available facilities.

The Center's monthly operating
funds come from fees collected on a
graduated scale of payments, ranging
from $52.50 to $92.50 a month for
the Day Care Program and 60 cents to
$1 an hour at the Little Kids' Place.
Costs for full time care elsewhere in
the Palo Alto area run from $90 to
$100 per month. During 1970-71 the
Center's total income was $35,178.14
of which $31,630.94 went to pay the
teachers employed by the two
programs. Tim Cobum, who opposes
the assessment, has stressed the lack of
volunteerism on the part of husbands
whose wives use the Center.
A prerequisite for using the
Children's Center facility is that one
parent must be connected in some way
to the University. About half of the
parents taking advantage of the facility
are students, with the other half being
Stanford faculty and staff.
The Day Care Center is open from
7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. daily and the
Little Kids' Place is available for child

United Fund for on-going support but
as yet has not been granted any.
The controversy over tomorrow's
referendum centers on whether or not
students should support what CCSC
people believe will be a one-time
capital expenditures outlay for major
improvements of the Center. The
assessment would then supposedly
clear the way for state licensing and
open up other channels for further
large assistance.
