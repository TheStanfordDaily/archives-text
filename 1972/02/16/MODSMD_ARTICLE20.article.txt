# Final Julliard Concert
## Enrapturing Music 
### DAVID W. WILLIAMS 
The reports from the Julliard
Quartet concerts of last Tuesday
and Friday varied so widely that I
hardly knew quite what to expect
at their Sunday concert. I have
listened for many years to the
second Julliard recording of the
Bartok quartet "No. 4", but I had
; not heard any of their Mozart.
The first work, the "Quintet in
j B flat, K. 174" began well enough
! though there was some
i awkwardness in a few transitional
I passages, and more often the
! intonation seemed a trifle fuzzy,
j The slow movement seemed to
; lack style and at moments even
! grace, seeming little more than an
; exercise of a nineteen year old
prodigy on the verge of becoming
j a composer. There is real poetry
here, and I have heard it better
played.
However, it was in the minuet
that the players seem to find
themselves, and while a colleague
of mine thought the tempi too
rapid, I thought them best in the
concluding allegro. I

have rarely heard it played in so
joyful, refreshing and interesting a
manner.
The Bartok quartet, often
called the most beautiful of the
six, is surely one of the greatest
masterpieces of the man.
The structure of this work in
five movements is conceived as an
arch with the almost
Stravinskyesque bass figure of the
first movement, appearing in the
opening bars of the finale, and
dominating the rhythm of that
movement's close. Moreover, the
second movement, a scherzo
played in muted fashion, provides
the fourth movement with much
of its thematic material.
The fourth movement is a
rustic dance played tutto
pizzicato, so that the players
appear as a group of country
minstrels strumming away in some
timeless central European
paradise, quite removed from the
worldly frenzy of the second
movement. The scherzo, which in
Beethoven's time was usually a
dance-like joke, and even the
scherzo of the Eroica may with
certain reservations be so
described, is thus written in the
spirit of tragic irony, suggesting
the utter grimness of life under
capitalism in its all too obvious
decline. It was a lively and
intelligent performance, and some
of the Bartok buffs thought it the
best performance of this mustic
that they'd heard.
I sometimes think that
sweetest knowledge I possess is
that while Mozart imitated Handel
in the fugues of the Requium, he
died with Pergolesi's "Stabat
Mater" on his lips. Pergolesi was a
very black African, and how he
got to Europe to write that
composition so beloved of Mozart
and indeed the most popular

composition of the century, and
then with a stroke reform French
opera and establish the style of
Italian opera even beyond the
time of Verdi, heaven only knows.
Mozart's comic style owes
much to "La Serva Padrona," but
whenever he wishes to affect the
tragic he usually evokes either the
world of Haydn's sturrri and drang
or that of the deeply tragic
"Stabat Mater," the deathbed
composition of the African
composer, who died at the age of
twenty-six.
As it happens, it is that last
composition that Mozart evokes
in the "G minor Quintet, K. 516,"
(1787), the program's final
offering, and indeed each
movement, as it exhausts the
possibilities of this apparently
African style, is more beautiful
than the last, and while some
maintain that the finale is
anti-climatic after the second
adaeio. I prefer to credit, as
Einstein does in the operas,
Mozart with that Shakespearean
sense of decorum that ends the
most magnificient sonnet iwth a
prosaic couplet.
Truly it is Mozart's sense of
drama and not a simple fear of
death that determines the tone of
this music, and those critics,
among them Einstein and Burke,
who see in it a variety of death
wishes or some vague kind of
philosophical weakness are surely
quite wrong. For all the Mozart
laments here is the brevity of life,
and terrible feeling that one will
die before his work is finished.
Suffice it to say that I clapped but
little upon the conclusion of this
work having exhausted myself
listening enraptured to the finest
performance of a Mozart chamber
work that I have ever heard. Bravo
Julliard String Quartet, and many
manv thanks.

prodigy on the verge of becoming
j a composer. There is real poetry
here, and I have heard it better
played.
However, it was in the minuet
that the players seem to find
themselves, and while a colleague
of mine thought the tempi too
rapid, I thought them best in the
concluding allegro. I

have rarely heard it played in so
joyful, refreshing and interesting a
manner.
The Bartok quartet, often
called the most beautiful of the
six, is surely one of the greatest
masterpieces of the man.
The structure of this work in
five movements is conceived as an
arch with the almost
Stravinskyesque bass figure of the
first movement, appearing in the
opening bars of the finale, and
dominating the rhythm of that
movement's close. Moreover, the
second movement, a scherzo
played in muted fashion, provides
the fourth movement with much
of its thematic material.
The fourth movement is a
rustic dance played tutto
pizzicato, so that the players
appear as a group of country
minstrels strumming away in some
timeless central European
paradise, quite removed from the
worldly frenzy of the second
movement. The scherzo, which in
Beethoven's time was usually a
dance-like joke, and even the
scherzo of the Eroica may with
certain reservations be so
described, is thus written in the
spirit of tragic irony, suggesting
the utter grimness of life under
capitalism in its all too obvious
decline. It was a lively and
intelligent performance, and some
of the Bartok buffs thought it the
best performance of this mustic
that they'd heard.
I sometimes think that
sweetest knowledge I possess is
that while Mozart imitated Handel
in the fugues of the Requium, he
died with Pergolesi's "Stabat
Mater" on his lips. Pergolesi was a
very black African, and how he
got to Europe to write that
composition so beloved of Mozart
and indeed the most popular

composition of the century, and
then with a stroke reform French
opera and establish the style of
Italian opera even beyond the
time of Verdi, heaven only knows.
Mozart's comic style owes
much to "La Serva Padrona," but
whenever he wishes to affect the
tragic he usually evokes either the
world of Haydn's sturrri and drang
or that of the deeply tragic
"Stabat Mater," the deathbed
composition of the African
composer, who died at the age of
twenty-six.
As it happens, it is that last
composition that Mozart evokes
in the "G minor Quintet, K. 516,"
(1787), the program's final
offering, and indeed each
movement, as it exhausts the
possibilities of this apparently
African style, is more beautiful
than the last, and while some
maintain that the finale is
anti-climatic after the second
adaeio. I prefer to credit, as
Einstein does in the operas,
Mozart with that Shakespearean
sense of decorum that ends the
most magnificient sonnet iwth a
prosaic couplet.
Truly it is Mozart's sense of
drama and not a simple fear of
death that determines the tone of
this music, and those critics,
among them Einstein and Burke,
who see in it a variety of death
wishes or some vague kind of
philosophical weakness are surely
quite wrong. For all the Mozart
laments here is the brevity of life,
and terrible feeling that one will
die before his work is finished.
Suffice it to say that I clapped but
little upon the conclusion of this
work having exhausted myself
listening enraptured to the finest
performance of a Mozart chamber
work that I have ever heard. Bravo
Julliard String Quartet, and many
manv thanks.
The reports from the Julliard
Quartet concerts of last Tuesday

hardly knew quite what to expect
at their Sunday concert. I have
listened for many years to the
second Julliard recording of the
Bartok quartet "No. 4", but I had

i awkwardness in a few transitional
I passages, and more often the
