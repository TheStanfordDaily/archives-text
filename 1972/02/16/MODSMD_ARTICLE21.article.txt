# Tolly's Follies
## Taj Does It Again 
### Don Tollefson 
Last Saturday for the second time in recent
months, the masterful blues artist Taj Mahal, once
again stole the show at Winterland from the
evening's "headliner." Back in November it was Van
Morrison he overshadowed and last weekend it was
the Quicksilver Messenger Service.
Taj is undeniably one of the finest solo blues
artists around and he is possibly unequaled in his
unique style of country blues. The depth he brings
to simple songs is a rare pleasure to watch and to
hear and his ability to hold an audience incredibly
attentive with his story-telling approach is quite
remarkable.
Taj is at his best on simple little things with lyrics
something like this, "Champagne don't drive me
crazy, Cocaine don't make me lazy, ain't nobody's
business but my own. Candy is dandy, but liquor is
quicker. You can drink all the liquor down in Costa
Rica. Ain't nobody's business but your own."
But don't think that Taj just sings easy-going
nonsense material. On the surface some of his songs
may seem fairly "light," but his style and talent can
make songs about even everyday things like fishin'
and hangin' around provide more insight into life and
people's conditions than many of the so-called
"heavy socially conscious" songs.
Instrumental Prowess
Taj didn't demonstrate as much of his
outstanding guitar and banjo technique as I had seen
him do other shows, but he did do enough
numbers which showcased these talents so that
newcomers to his audience must have been aware
of his prowess.
As he often does, Taj finished up with his
legendary "Little Red Light," in which he gets a
whole audience screaming and clapping and singing
along with only his vocal lead to follow. As usual,
the crowd exploded when Taj had finished his set.
Taj is definitely a tough act to follow, but at the
beginning of their set, Quicksilver seemed like they
might really live up to their top billing. They started
out with two fine numbers, "Have Another Hit"
and "Tell Me Doctor" and I was thinking how great
it was to hear one of the original San Francisco
bands playing at their best. My joy was shortlived.
Somehwere in the midst of a nearly 25 minute
long version of "Mona," Quicksilver began a rapid
downhill descent, and with one or two exceptions,
the rest of their set was incredibly disappointing,
especially considering their fine start. The villain of
the whole thing was lead singer Dino Valente.
Hard to Endure
Valente has a very big ego. He so dominates
Quicksilver's stage presence with his constant
movement and "showing-off" that it is impossible
to concentrate on much of anything else while he's
on stage. Valente's nasal singing can be fine at times,
but all too often he goes off on tangents and starts
screaming and moaning until it becomes a bit hard
to endure.
Unfortunately the rest of the band often follows
Valente's lead into the realm of mediocrity. They
try to make up for a lack of quality by turning up
the volume and this naturally only makes things
worse.
The band was at its worst on an incredibly
disappointing version of "Who Do You Love,"
which was a great full side cut on their "Shady

Grove" album. You could hardly recognize the
song, except at the very beginning and the very end
and fortunately, they were merciful enough to
perform a truncated version.
What is really bothersome is that this is a
talented group. Gary Duncan can be a very good
lead guitarist, newcomers Mark Ryan (bass) and
Charles Schoning (keyboards) are very competent,
drummer Greg Elmore is one of the better ones
around and Valente at times can sing very well.
Mr. Quicksilver
But Valente seems to be undermining the whole
group's success with his unfortunate ego trips. When
he isn't singing, he always has to be "jamming" on
the congas or trying to conduct the rest of the band
or generally being Mr. Quicksilver. This and his
oftimes ear-piercing vocals seem to push Quicksilver
rapidly downhill. With all that talent they could be
very good, if Valente would realize that he has a
competent group behind him and that all he needs
to do is to perform the kind of vocal numbers which
he is very capable on. Give us all a break, Dino.
The opening act on Saturday's show,
Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen,
definitely deserves mention. Commander Cody has
been playing a lot in the Bay Area in recent months,
one of their better songs, "Hot Rod Lincoln," has
just been released as a single and they are a very
good band in a very unique way.
Their material consists mainly of truckdriving
music and oldie-goldies, all of which are dominated
by a strong electric country sound. They perform
very enjoyable country-tainted versions of oldies
like "Crying Time," "Tutti Fruitti," "Be Bop A
Lulu," and "Jailhouse Rock," and fortunately they
concentrate on performing the music and avoid
meddling in the theatrical aspect which Sha-Na-Na
handles so well.
Combine those oldies with great versions of
favorites like "I'm Lost in the Ozarks Again," "It
Should've Been Me With That Real Fine Chick" and
"Looking At The World Through A Windshield,"
and you have a most unique and enjoyable kind of
entertainment. Commander Cody is a very welcome
opening act on any bill
