The Daily would like to request that
anyone who is sponsoring an entertainment
event, either on or off campus, please
notify us of that event in writing, as far in
advance as possible, so we will be able to
include it in our weekly Entertainment
Calendar. We are also considering reviving a
Films of the Week column and in order to
do that, we need to have all groups which
are sponsoring films they will be showing
the rest of the quarter. Address all
