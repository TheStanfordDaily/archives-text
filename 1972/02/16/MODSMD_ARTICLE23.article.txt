# Swimmers Dunked

### MIKE CHASSON 
The Stanford swimming team
suffered two of its worst dual
meet defeats in history last
weekend, getting crushed by USC,
82-31, and UCLA, 81-32.
On Friday night the Indians
were beaten by what may be the
best team in the country. USC
simply overwhelmed the Indians
by taking first and second in six
of the 11 events. They won every
event except the 1000 free and
the 200 breast. To make matters
worse many of USC's top
swimmers were not even
swimming their best events. Frank
Heckl normally a sprinter, swam
and won the 500 free. Tom
Mcßreen, who usually swims
distance freestyle, won the 200
back. Kim Tutt who normally
swims the sprints, won the 200
fly.

There were a couple bright
spots in an otherwise dismal
evening. Terry Sutton in winning
the 1000 free set USC pool,
meet, and Stanford varsity records
in recording a 9.40.3. This time is
currently the third fastest in the
country. Sutton dropped 27
seconds of his best 1000 from last
year, and 17 seconds off his best
from this year. Coach Jim
Gaughran called Sutton's swim
"probably the best individual dual
meet performance in the 12 years
I have been here."
The other bright spot was in
the 200 breast as Brian Job and
Dave Schilling went one-two. Job
dropped his season best to 2.06.8
maintaining his position as the
number one breastroker so far this
year. Schilling recorded a 2.08.9
to remain number two in the
country.

Bruins Tough
Against UCLA on Saturday
afternoon things didn't get much
better. The Bruins like the Trojans
were just too much for the
Indians to handle. The first event
was the medley relay and the
Indians needed a win to have a
chance to win the meet. Instead
they were touched out at the wall
even though Steve Carey anchored
in 46.4, his best 100 free since the
NCAA's two years ago.
In losing the relay the Indians
recorded the fourth fastest time in
the country this year. After the
medley relay Stanford was only
able to win the 1000 free, as
Sutton once again did an excellent
job in beating Bruin ace Steve
Genter; and the 200 breast where
Job and Schilling went one-two
once again.
Strongest Ever
Gaughran called the SC and
UCLA teams the strongest either
has ever had. He was disappointed
in losing so badly to these teams,
but was not disappointed by the
results in terms of doing well at
the NCAA's, the meet which
Stanford shoots for every year.
Gaughran also indicated that "the
kids were more tired, than rested"
from the extremely short taper
that was done for the meet.
Gaughran believes with a good
rest period the Indians will do
quite well at the NCAA's.
In the next few weeks
Gaughran will give the swimmers
who haven't made Pacific-8 or
NCAA cutoff times a chance to
make them, while working hard
those that have made the times.
Stanford faces Cal next weekend
at Berkeley in what will probably
be an extremely close meet. Cal is
ineligible for the NCAA
Championships and is expected to
do everything they can to beat
Stanford, something they haven't
done in over 30 years.

WATER WATER EVERYWHERE-Breaststroker Dave Schilling
comes up for air against Arden Hills earlier this year. The Stanford
captain provided one of the few bright spots in his team's disastrous
Southern California outing by taking two seconds in the 200 Breast,
maintaining his position as the second fastest breaststroker in the
country behind Brian Job.
