Editor, THE DAILY:
As a fitting name for Stanford
athletes, how about "Imperialistic
Racist Dogs?" Not only does it
tell it as some people think it is
(and, surely, it used to be worse),
but it has regal, speedy
connotations and it recognizes a
populous species on the campus —
one that won't bark back. It is a
bit long for a nickname and the
initials I.R.D. have no zing. For a
better sound the last word might
be changed to "puppies" which
would enable such yells as, "Go,
Stanford IRPs," or simply, "Go,
IRP!" There is another animal
name beginning with the letter
"P" that comes to mind, but even
the most ardent critics of our
racial and social injustices will
have to admit to its overuse.
This humorous (?) defensive (!)
reaction to the 55 Native
American petitioners doesn't seem
as brilliantly funny as when I first
wrote it. Their feelings have
finally begun to penetrate my
thick scalp. The term "Indian" IS
so general it can apply to any one
of several cultures on at least
three continents. None of these
cultures needs to be, or can be,
further dignified by Stanford's
gratuitous use of such a general
term. Additionally, the number
and diversity of individuals
covered by the term makes it
impossible to solicit permission to
use the name. If the University
(students, faculty, alumni and
friends such as me) can't
acknowledge these points, what
silly, thoughtless children we will
show ourselves to be.
However, there are the
personal feelings of a good, gentle

man to consider: Timm Williams.
As faithful "Prince Lightfoot" he
has made a colorful and dignififed
contribution to the Stanford
scene for two decades. Most
students over the years have
seemed to react to him with
friendly tolerance. Many small
children, and some of us who are
not so small, have admired him
with genuine affection. I suggest
that the University ask the people
of his Indian Nation to consider
honoring Stanford by allowing
the use of the name "Yuroks."
This specific American Indian
group of the California area might
benefit in many ways from the
special friendship and interest of
this University. As individuals and
as a whole, this academic
community could certainly help
young Yurok men and women
toward a greater discovery and
development of their potentials. If
I were seeking the privilege of
using their name in such a way, I
would want at least an 80%
favorable vote of approval by the
Yurok people. Then I would go to
work with them on their behalf to
be damn sure Stanford lived up to
the honor! And, I would enjoy
the prospect of watching Timm
dance at Stanford athletic
contests for many decades to
come.

I have been following with
interest the controversy over the
use of the Indian as Stanford's
mascot though I have refrained

until now from expressing my
personal feeling as I felt that those
native Americans in the Stanford
community were the ones most
affected and so were the people to
make their feelings known. Well,
we now have both sides of the
"penny" so to speak — objection
to the use of the Indian as a
mascot by our native students and
I don't blame them for I was
repulsed too by that silly looking
little Indian on the decals and
other items sold in the bookstore
— and the use of a warrior chief in
full ceremonial headdress which is
another matter, symbolizing the
strength, courage, and bravery of
a race of people whom the white
man on this continent has treated
so abominably.
I am hoping that this is the
Indian we shall see on our banners
and decals from now on. Timm
Williams certainly has portrayed
the native American at his finest
(both on the athletic field and in
his work) — what he was before
being corrupted, ridiculed and all
but rendered extinct by white
settlers bent on their own selfish
ends.
Is our conscience pricking us so
badly that we feel that the only
way to expiate our forefathers'
sins against this noble race is to
abolish a symbol which somebody
had the foresight to adopt 40
years ago by perpetuating for
posterity the American Indian's
fine characteristics? (No doubt
they had conscience pangs too
and wanted to expiate past crimes
against the native American but in
a positive way.)

populous species on the campus —
one that won't bark back. It is a
bit long for a nickname and the
initials I.R.D. have no zing. For a
better sound the last word might
be changed to "puppies" which
would enable such yells as, "Go,
Stanford IRPs," or simply, "Go,
IRP!" There is another animal
name beginning with the letter
"P" that comes to mind, but even
the most ardent critics of our
racial and social injustices will
have to admit to its overuse.
This humorous (?) defensive (!)
reaction to the 55 Native
American petitioners doesn't seem
as brilliantly funny as when I first
wrote it. Their feelings have
finally begun to penetrate my
thick scalp. The term "Indian" IS
so general it can apply to any one
of several cultures on at least
three continents. None of these
cultures needs to be, or can be,
further dignified by Stanford's
gratuitous use of such a general
term. Additionally, the number
and diversity of individuals
covered by the term makes it
impossible to solicit permission to
use the name. If the University
(students, faculty, alumni and
friends such as me) can't
acknowledge these points, what
silly, thoughtless children we will
show ourselves to be.
However, there are the
personal feelings of a good, gentle

man to consider: Timm Williams.
As faithful "Prince Lightfoot" he
has made a colorful and dignififed
contribution to the Stanford
scene for two decades. Most
students over the years have
seemed to react to him with
friendly tolerance. Many small
children, and some of us who are
not so small, have admired him
with genuine affection. I suggest
that the University ask the people
of his Indian Nation to consider
honoring Stanford by allowing
the use of the name "Yuroks."
This specific American Indian
group of the California area might
benefit in many ways from the
special friendship and interest of
this University. As individuals and
as a whole, this academic
community could certainly help
young Yurok men and women
toward a greater discovery and
development of their potentials. If
I were seeking the privilege of
using their name in such a way, I
would want at least an 80%
favorable vote of approval by the
Yurok people. Then I would go to
work with them on their behalf to
be damn sure Stanford lived up to
the honor! And, I would enjoy
the prospect of watching Timm
dance at Stanford athletic
contests for many decades to
come.

I have been following with
interest the controversy over the
use of the Indian as Stanford's
mascot though I have refrained

until now from expressing my
personal feeling as I felt that those
native Americans in the Stanford
community were the ones most
affected and so were the people to
make their feelings known. Well,
we now have both sides of the
"penny" so to speak — objection
to the use of the Indian as a
mascot by our native students and
I don't blame them for I was
repulsed too by that silly looking
little Indian on the decals and
other items sold in the bookstore
— and the use of a warrior chief in
full ceremonial headdress which is
another matter, symbolizing the
strength, courage, and bravery of
a race of people whom the white
man on this continent has treated
so abominably.
I am hoping that this is the
Indian we shall see on our banners
and decals from now on. Timm
Williams certainly has portrayed
the native American at his finest
(both on the athletic field and in
his work) — what he was before
being corrupted, ridiculed and all
but rendered extinct by white
settlers bent on their own selfish
ends.
Is our conscience pricking us so
badly that we feel that the only
way to expiate our forefathers'
sins against this noble race is to
abolish a symbol which somebody
had the foresight to adopt 40
years ago by perpetuating for
posterity the American Indian's
fine characteristics? (No doubt
they had conscience pangs too
and wanted to expiate past crimes
against the native American but in
a positive way.)

As a fitting name for Stanford
athletes, how about "Imperialistic
Racist Dogs?" Not only does it
tell it as some people think it is
(and, surely, it used to be worse),
but it has regal, speedy
connotations and it recognizes a
populous species on the campus —
one that won't bark back. It is a
