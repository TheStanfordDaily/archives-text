# Fast Continues For Eighth Day
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
A fast with three goals: an open
community meeting with President
Lyman and moratoria on war
recruiting at the Placement Center and
on all proceedings of the Campus
Judicial Panel, entered its eighth day
this morning.
The fast continues despite Lyman's
decision Monday that any further
negotiations with the fasters would be
fruitless. According to the fasters,
Lyman had stated previously that the
second and third demands of the
fasters were not negotiable.
At a noon rally in White Plaza
yesterday, Dave Josephson, spokesman
for the fasters, in responding to
Lyman's commendation of the fasters
because their tactics "are so different
from what Venceremos is doing" said
Lyman "hasn't dealt with us any
differently than he has with
Venceremos."
Josephson also asked that members
of the community who support the
goals of the fast should either call or
write to Lyman to make their feelings
known to him.
Josephson said that the goal of the
phone-mail drive was to convince
Lyman that he was wrong to think the
fasters "didn't represent the
community." Fasters yesterday
continued to sit outside* Lyman's
office in Building 10.
In behalf of the fasters, Josephson
expressed support for Third World
Liberation Front and SRM member
Kwonping Ho, whose Campus Judicial
Panel hearing for the invasion of the
Faculty Club on January 24 begins
Friday. The first hearing starts at 1:30
p.m. in the Annenburg Auditorium of
the Cummings Art Building.
Venceremos member Geri Foote
also asked support for herself and
three others who are being brought
before the Panel for the January 18
disruption of Electrical Engineering
Professor William Shockley's class. The
other three are Ho, Don Lee and Alice
Furumoto. Their hearings begin
Monday. A rally will be held at noon
today in White Plaza by the Third
World Liberation Front to support Ho
and denounce Shockley.
Last night, Lyman and Political
Science Professor Hubert Marshall
discussed war recruitment at the
Placement Center on KZSU.
According to faster John Marx from

Columbae, Lyman's office phoned him
yesterday afternoon to ask him to
appear with them on the program.
Marx said that he rejected the
invitation because he felt "the need
for Dick to discuss such issues in an
atmosphere which is conducive to
open community discussion. A
30-minute radio program in no way
meets that need and should not be
viewed as an alternative to a
community meeting."
After the noon rally Placement
Center 4 defense collective member
Dave Schlissel entered the Center for a
scheduled appointment with General
Dynamics. Schlissel said that General
Dynamics was the second largest
Department of Defense contractor.
Since the Center does not officially
open after lunch until 1:00 p.m.,
Schlissel and the six who accompanied
him found the doors locked.

Frances Holtslander admitted Schlissel
but refused to allow the others in even
though Schlissel expressed the desire
for a public interview.
Holtslander told Schlissel that he
had no right to an open interview even
though Placement Center procedures
permit an interviewee to conduct such
an interview.
Schlissel held the "interview" with
the General Dynamics representative
until 1:00 p.m. when Holtslander
admitted the six waiting outside. The
General Dynamics recruiter then
concluded the interview.
A stench bomb had been tossed
through the front door of the Center
at 10:00 a.m. by a young woman.
Although the air in the Center still
reeked when the six entered at 1:00
p.m., it was reported that the building
was not evacuated

appear with them on the program.
Marx said that he rejected the
invitation because he felt "the need
for Dick to discuss such issues in an
atmosphere which is conducive to
open community discussion. A
30-minute radio program in no way
meets that need and should not be
viewed as an alternative to a
community meeting."
After the noon rally Placement
Center 4 defense collective member
Dave Schlissel entered the Center for a
scheduled appointment with General
Dynamics. Schlissel said that General
Dynamics was the second largest
Department of Defense contractor.
Since the Center does not officially
open after lunch until 1:00 p.m.,
Schlissel and the six who accompanied
him found the doors locked.

Recruitment Activities Supervisor
Frances Holtslander admitted Schlissel
but refused to allow the others in even
though Schlissel expressed the desire
for a public interview.
Holtslander told Schlissel that he
had no right to an open interview even
though Placement Center procedures
permit an interviewee to conduct such
an interview.
Schlissel held the "interview" with
the General Dynamics representative
until 1:00 p.m. when Holtslander
admitted the six waiting outside. The
General Dynamics recruiter then
concluded the interview.
A stench bomb had been tossed
through the front door of the Center
at 10:00 a.m. by a young woman.
Although the air in the Center still
reeked when the six entered at 1:00
p.m., it was reported that the building
was not evacuated
A fast with three goals: an open
community meeting with President
Lyman and moratoria on war
recruiting at the Placement Center and
on all proceedings of the Campus
Judicial Panel, entered its eighth day
this morning.
The fast continues despite Lyman's
decision Monday that any further
negotiations with the fasters would be
fruitless. According to the fasters,
Lyman had stated previously that the
second and third demands of the
fasters were not negotiable.
At a noon rally in White Plaza
yesterday, Dave Josephson, spokesman
for the fasters, in responding to
Lyman's commendation of the fasters
because their tactics "are so different
from what Venceremos is doing" said
Lyman "hasn't dealt with us any
differently than he has with
Venceremos."
Josephson also asked that members
of the community who support the
goals of the fast should either call or
write to Lyman to make their feelings
known to him.
Josephson said that the goal of the
phone-mail drive was to convince
Lyman that he was wrong to think the
fasters "didn't represent the
community." Fasters yesterday
continued to sit outside* Lyman's
office in Building 10.
In behalf of the fasters, Josephson
expressed support for Third World
Liberation Front and SRM member
Kwonping Ho, whose Campus Judicial
Panel hearing for the invasion of the
Faculty Club on January 24 begins
Friday. The first hearing starts at 1:30
p.m. in the Annenburg Auditorium of
the Cummings Art Building.
Venceremos member Geri Foote
also asked support for herself and
three others who are being brought
before the Panel for the January 18
disruption of Electrical Engineering
Professor William Shockley's class. The
other three are Ho, Don Lee and Alice
Furumoto. Their hearings begin
Monday. A rally will be held at noon
today in White Plaza by the Third
World Liberation Front to support Ho
and denounce Shockley.
Last night, Lyman and Political
Science Professor Hubert Marshall
discussed war recruitment at the
Placement Center on KZSU.
According to faster John Marx from

Columbae, Lyman's office phoned him
yesterday afternoon to ask him to
appear with them on the program.
Marx said that he rejected the
invitation because he felt "the need
for Dick to discuss such issues in an
atmosphere which is conducive to
