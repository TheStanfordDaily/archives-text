Mitchell Resigns From Cabinet
WASHINGTON — John N. Mitchell resigned as
attorney general yesterday to take command of
President Nixon's re-election campaign. Nixon
nominated Richard G. Kleindienst, Mitchell's
deputy and personal choice, for the Cabinet
post. Senate liberals promised close questioning
of Kleindienst, an Arizona conservative, but
early indications were that his nomination
would be confirmed.
Mitchell, one of Nixon's closest personal and
political advisers, managed his 1968 campaign.
His resignation to direct the 1972 effort had
been expected for months, but apparently was
delayed by debate within the administration
about his successor.
Edgar Snow Dies
EYSINS, Switzerland — Edgar Snow, for years
the only non-Communist American Journalist

publications, including the Chicago Tribune,
New York Sun, Life, Look, the Saturday
Evening Post, the London Herald and Le
Nouveau Candide of Paris.
Over the years Snow became a personal
friend of Chairman Mao Tse-tung and other
Communist leaders.
His books include "Red Star Over China,"
"The Battle for Asia," and"The Other Side of
the River: Red China Today."

By FRED COLEMAN
(Jerry's brother)
LONDON — Prime Minister Edward Heath
urged Britain's trade union movement

yesterday to end the coal miners' strike that
could halt British industry within two weeks.
The powerful Trade Union Congress turned him
down.
The number of workers laid off because of
electric power cuts passed one million.
Thousands of trade unionists and miners
marched on Parliament, chanting "Heath out"
and demanding that the government grant the
miners' pay demands.
Chavez Pledges 'Sit-Down'
ATWATER, Calif. - AFL-CIO United Farm
Workers Organizing Committee members were
ordered yesterday to quit working and sit down
in any fields entered by "armed persons."
The policy declaration followed a funeral
attended by hundreds of UFWOC members for
a union farm worker shot to death by a U.S.
border patrolman near here Friday.

"To end these assaults against farm workers,
it is necessary that from now on, we will do a
sit-down whenever armed persons enter a field
where we are working," Chavez' statement said.
Doek Strike Near Ratification
SAN FRANCISCO — The 110-man caucus of
the longshoremen's union voted late last night
to recommend that the 13,000 striking
members of 29 West Coast locals ratify a
contract which would end the 130-day
walkout.
The decision came on the fourth day of
discussions in which delegates debated and
explored all facets of the tentative agreement
reached a week ago Tuesday between the
International Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen's Union and the 122-member
shippers' Pacific Maritime Association.
