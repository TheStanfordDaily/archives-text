# Lyman Calls Fast Demands 'Unacceptable’
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
President Richard Lyman stated
last night that he could not, as a
matter of principle, accept a
moratorium on open recruiting on
campus.
In a KZSU Campus Conference,
Lyman remarked that accepting the
hunger strike demands for moratoria
on military-war related recruiting and
on student judicial hearings, "would
involve abandonment of sets of
principles held as strongly and deeply
as those of the fasters in favor of steps
which I believe are wrong."
Lyman said, "I am impressed by
the depth of feeling and real
self-sacrifice shown by the
fasters. . . and by the calm and
unabusive manner with which they

carried on their discussion with me."
However, the President was
"depressed" by the characterization of
the administration's position as harsh
and unfeeling, devoid of the moral
fervor or personal courage
demonstrated by our opponents.
The President also protested "a lack
of self-perception" on the part of the
strikers. "Non-violent does not mean
non-coercive," noted Lyman. He
rejected "the line of reasoning which
runs, if a protest is non-violent, it is
good, and therefore 1 should yield to
the demands."
"Would you have me do the
bidding of anyone willing to starve
himself?" Lyman asked in response to
a reporter's query later in the

broadcast. "What if his demand was to
restore ROTC to campus?"
Monetary Loss
A severe monetary loss to the
University would also be the result of
prohibiting military recruiting on
campus, Lyman argued. "Barring
recruitment facilities to the military
would, under existing law, result in the
loss of NASA and DoD support
amounting to $16.4 million annually,"
explained Lyman.
"This would directly affect the
income of 98 faculty members, 306
students, 144 senior research
associates, 416 other staff whose
employment is directly dependent on
these research funds and 206 other
people through loss of indirect cost
recovery," he added.

After the regular broadcast, Lyman
joined Art Professor Albert Elsen,
another defendent of open recruiting,
in a debate against ASSU President
Larry Diamond and Political Science
Professor Herbert Marshall, who favor
prohibiting recruiting by the military
and by corporations heavily involved
in the Indochina War.
All four speakers expressed
pessimism as to whether or not a
compromise could be reached on the
recruiting issue.
End All Recruiting
Diamond suggested that, "an end to
all recruiting at the Placement Center
might be the only solution to a
situation where both sides occupy
such strongly-held positions which
they will not yield."
Lyman twice admitted that, while
he does not want to see an end to all
recruiting at the Placement Center, "I
could live with that solution."
Marshall held that the University
operates on a double standard, at the
Placement Center, willing to act
aggressively against rascism exhibited
by recruiters, but does nothing to
oppose the war in Indochina.
No Right To Recruit
He cited the case of
Goldman-Sachs, a banking firm, which
was banned from the Placement
Center after an alleged rascist incident
during an interview of a black student.
The discrimination was never verified
in court of law.
"This established that corporations
or individuals have no right to use the
Placement Center if their actions
violate the deeply-held moral
sentiments of the community, or
threaten harm to individuals,"
according to Marshall.
"But when the Air Force comes
here to recruit bomber pilots to rain
death upon the people of Indochina,
no action can be taken," noted
Marshall. "The administration is
saying, in effect, that rascism in a job
interview is a greater evil than the
slaughter of the Indochinese people."
Professor Elsen labelled a ban on
military recruiting as "a cop-out." He
suggested that "the ideal situation
would be to have a war recruiter come
and nobody show up," and urged that,
"we use our roles as students and
teachers to educate ourselves about
the realities of the Indochina War."

All four speakers expressed
pessimism as to whether or not a
compromise could be reached on the
recruiting issue.
End All Recruiting
Diamond suggested that, "an end to
all recruiting at the Placement Center
might be the only solution to a
situation where both sides occupy
such strongly-held positions which
they will not yield."
Lyman twice admitted that, while
he does not want to see an end to all
recruiting at the Placement Center, "I
could live with that solution."
Marshall held that the University
operates on a double standard, at the
Placement Center, willing to act
aggressively against rascism exhibited
by recruiters, but does nothing to
oppose the war in Indochina.
No Right To Recruit
He cited the case of
Goldman-Sachs, a banking firm, which
was banned from the Placement
Center after an alleged rascist incident
during an interview of a black student.
The discrimination was never verified
in court of law.
"This established that corporations
or individuals have no right to use the
Placement Center if their actions
violate the deeply-held moral
sentiments of the community, or
threaten harm to individuals,"
according to Marshall.
"But when the Air Force comes
here to recruit bomber pilots to rain
death upon the people of Indochina,
no action can be taken," noted
Marshall. "The administration is
saying, in effect, that rascism in a job
interview is a greater evil than the
slaughter of the Indochinese people."
Professor Elsen labelled a ban on
military recruiting as "a cop-out." He
suggested that "the ideal situation
would be to have a war recruiter come
and nobody show up," and urged that,
"we use our roles as students and
teachers to educate ourselves about
the realities of the Indochina War."

President Richard Lyman stated
last night that he could not, as a
matter of principle, accept a
moratorium on open recruiting on
campus.
In a KZSU Campus Conference,
Lyman remarked that accepting the
hunger strike demands for moratoria
on military-war related recruiting and
on student judicial hearings, "would
involve abandonment of sets of
principles held as strongly and deeply
as those of the fasters in favor of steps
which I believe are wrong."
Lyman said, "I am impressed by
the depth of feeling and real
self-sacrifice shown by the
fasters. . . and by the calm and
unabusive manner with which they

carried on their discussion with me."
However, the President was
"depressed" by the characterization of
the administration's position as harsh
and unfeeling, devoid of the moral
fervor or personal courage
demonstrated by our opponents.
The President also protested "a lack
of self-perception" on the part of the
strikers. "Non-violent does not mean
non-coercive," noted Lyman. He
rejected "the line of reasoning which
runs, if a protest is non-violent, it is
good, and therefore 1 should yield to
the demands."
"Would you have me do the
bidding of anyone willing to starve
himself?" Lyman asked in response to
a reporter's query later in the

broadcast. "What if his demand was to
restore ROTC to campus?"
Monetary Loss
A severe monetary loss to the
University would also be the result of
prohibiting military recruiting on
campus, Lyman argued. "Barring
recruitment facilities to the military
would, under existing law, result in the
loss of NASA and DoD support
amounting to $16.4 million annually,"
explained Lyman.
"This would directly affect the
income of 98 faculty members, 306
students, 144 senior research
associates, 416 other staff whose
employment is directly dependent on
these research funds and 206 other
people through loss of indirect cost
recovery," he added.

After the regular broadcast, Lyman
joined Art Professor Albert Elsen,
another defendent of open recruiting,
in a debate against ASSU President
Larry Diamond and Political Science
Professor Herbert Marshall, who favor
prohibiting recruiting by the military
and by corporations heavily involved
in the Indochina War.
All four speakers expressed
