# Little Room For Classes
## Dated Facilities Restrict Women 
### TERRIE McDONALD (Second In A Series) 
Pamela Strathairn, Chairman of the Women's Physical
Education (WPE) department, estimates that between 35
and 40 percent of Stanford's undergraduate women enroll
in a physical education class each quarter. She is proud of
the instructional program and faculty of "physical
educators" that draws hundreds of girls into the WPE
classes.
The department, however, is a victim of its own
success. The physical plant was built in the 1930'5, at a
time when Stanford's female enrollment had just topped
300. Lagunita Court was being built to house the overflow
from Roble, the sole women's dorm.
Taxed Gym
Designed to accommodate 500 women, the gym
facility groaned under a class enrollment of nearly twice
that number last fall. (This figure includes the
approximately 100 men who take part in coed classes at
the women's gym each quarter.)
The demand for floor space in the gym is such that it is
virtually impossible for a girl to shoot a few baskets or
practice a dance routine during the day. In the evening,
serious athletes vie for time with men and women taking
advantages of recreation hours in the gym. Female
gymnasts have to go to the men's gym to find room for
non-class exercise during the afternoon.
The women's gym, tennis courts, pool and field all do
double and triple duty for classes, workouts and
recreation. Tennis courts are tied up with classes from 10
a.m. until just before dusk Monday through Thursday
while the 25-yard outdoor pool absorbs the activity that
was planned to be spread across a complex of three pools.
Four levels of swimming instruction, water safety

instructor and life-saving classes, as well as students taking
advantage of open recreation hours crowd the facility.
Because there is no track in the area, joggers co-exist with
soccer players and frisbee throwers when golfers are not
using the field for a driving range.
Athletic Priorities
Tailoring their policies and programs to fit the
limitations imposed by critically inadequate facilities, the
WPE department has established definite priorities.
When the gymnastics and track and field instructor left
the department last year, she was replaced by an
instructor who teaches swimming, tennis and conditioning
as well as gymnastics. Strathairn called gymnastics
"terrifically popular, more so than any other sport in
recent years," yet instruction here for women does not go
beyond the intermediate level.
Strathairn stated that it might even have been "an error
for Stanford to join the group of schools developing
gymnastics when we couldn't handle it." What Stanford
can't provide its female gymnasts is adequate storage
space for proper equipment, the scheduling of gymnasium
hours and faculty time away from other sports.
Graduate student Andrea Mattson is one of the few
girls who work on the tumbling mats and do free exercise
in the men's gym. She took up gymnastics at Stanford last
winter when WPE still offered girls Wednesday night and
Friday afternoon workouts in addition to advanced and
tournament classes.
Now, she says, "several top quality girls have quit
because they couldn't even get into the intermediate
class." She added that a girl who is anxious to work out,
but is just beginning in gymnastics, is at an obvious
disadvantage when she has to go to the men's gym. The

INADEQUATE FACILITIES—GirI's gymnastics program and Physical
Education (WPE) opportunities are severely limited by dated facilities. WPE
department priorities stress class instruction, not competition.
few girls to overcome their self-consciousness are an
obvious minority.
Julie Cates, another of the girls who exercises in the
men's gym while varsity coach Dan Millman holds
practices for his gymnasts, admires Millman and would
like to see him teach a women's class.
Knowing he doesn't have time for that, the female
gymnasts have looked for a grad student to coach them,
but their efforts outside class have failed, as have their
attempts to sway the WPE department with reports and
sign-up lists.
Gymnasts Become Trampolinists
Millman does not instruct girls who exercise in the
men's gym, but many of the disappointed female
gymnasts show up in his co-ed trampoline classes. While
noting that both he and varsity swim coach Jim Gaughran
believe girls enjoy competing against other females rather
than boys, he indicated the co-ed class situation works out
well. He stated that "gymnastics is an artistic activity. It is
no more masculine or feminine than painting."
Gaughran stated that, "To the extent that women want
to be integrated into the men's physical education
program, at least in my area, they can be by coming over
and signing up." But, he said, "How many girls want to
train as hard as we are going; only three at the present
time." He added "when we have the new facility, it would
be possible for us to train more girls, if the girls wanted."
The facility Gaughran refers to is a swimming pool and
squash/handball complex which will be completed as
Phase II of the Master Building Plan for the Department
of Physical Education and Athletics. He hopes the three
pool complex, which will have both men's and women's
lockers, will bo ready for fall term, 1973.
The opening of a new swimming complex in 1973 may
well alleviate some of the congestion at the women's pool,
but Senior Margie Shuer is concerned about the present
situation, which may continue in spite of the new
facilities.
Shuer has been a student member of the Committee on
Athletics and Physical Education for three years and is
now the only voting student member of the
Administrative Panel on Internal Athletics, Physical
Education and Recreational Programs which reviews the
existing departments.
Have And Have-Nots
She stated, "I see collegiate athletic programs as cases
of 'the haves and the have-nots.' The men seem to have
everything, including use of facilities at prime time, good
coaching and the chance to represent their university in
meaningful, big-time competition.
"When a girl comes from the AAU (Amateur Athletic
Union) program in swimming she comes from a situation
of complete equality in the sport. In college, she
encounters a situation of complete inequality. There are
talented women at this university and I believe they
should have the right to compete on the national
intercollegiate level if they qualify. And they have."
Strathairn's answer to Shuer's complaint is that the
WPE's "basic commitment is to the breadth of the
program as opposed to the percentage-wise limited
number of highly skilled students, who, if they want to

have the top level competition in any of the sports, are
not denied this if they are affiliated with, say, the Santa
Clara Swim Team (AAU) or enter tennis tournaments as
individuals, which students have done in the past.
"We take the posture here that we cannot possibly be
all things to abl people. You have to set your priorities in
the direction of the majority of the students," she stated.
Shuer mentioned, "that in addition to the female
athletes who have competed on their own, without the
satisfaction of University backing, there are girls who have
not been able to compete in national level collegiate
competitions because of WPE financing and priorities."
"It is," as Gaughran said, "a matter of numbers and
desire. If feeling is widespread at all, say a number that is
reasonable — 40 to 50 girls — then it is incumbent upon us
to provide a program for them. The reason it hasn't been
organized is because no one has taken a stand," he said.
It is difficult to say just how widespread support for
more competitive programs is in each sport, but when, as
in the case of gymnastics, the WPE department is unable
to offer even an advanced class, the question becomes
impossible to answer.
However, there appears to be a middle ground
supported by large numbers of female athletes in
swimming, basketball and tennis.
Girls who are interested in sports and competition are
interested in excellence, realizing their potential and
winning. They intend to have fun and maintain their
academics, but they expect Stanford to respond to their
specific talents.
Lack Of Coaches
Ann Hill, President of the Women's Recreation
Association and a member of the varsity tennis team in
1970-71, said, "Instruction isn't totally out of the
question, but by the time you are in a tournament class,
you don't need elementary instruction." A current
member of the tennis team said, "after playing tennis for
10 or 12 years it is a waste of practice time to spend 15
minutes throwing the ball up in the air."
Shelia Zelinger, a varsity swimmer who says she is
basically satisfied with the WPE program, stated, "the
emphasis on the well-rounded program instead of
competition is too much to the extreme of being
well-rounded. It would be more helpful if the women in
the physical education department would adopt the
attitude that competition is not inferior, but just as
beneficial as instruction."
Similarly, basketball players have voiced the opinion
that the approach to their tournament class ought to be
different than that towards the other classes. They would
like to be coached in the strategies of competition once
they have mastered the basic skills.
The excellence of the WPE department's class
instruction is not disputed, and no one contests the
necessity of teaching basic skills. The WPE department has
stated that this is where they concentrate their resources,
but varsity team members contend that they also need a
particular type of instruction: coaching.
It was Gaughran who stated the situation most
concisely, "Physical educators aren't necessarily coaches.
Some are both, many are. But being a good physical
educator doesn't necessarily mean you are a good coach."
