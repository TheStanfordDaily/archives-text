# Little Room For Classes
## Dated Facilities Restrict Women 
### TERRIE McDONALD (Second In A Series) 
Pamela Strathairn, Chairman of the Women's Physical
Education (WPE) department, estimates that between 35
and 40 percent of Stanford's undergraduate women enroll
in a physical education class each quarter. She is proud of
the instructional program and faculty of "physical
educators" that draws hundreds of girls into the WPE
classes.
The department, however, is a victim of its own
success. The physical plant was built in the 1930'5, at a
time when Stanford's female enrollment had just topped
300. Lagunita Court was being built to house the overflow
from Roble, the sole women's dorm.
Taxed Gym
Designed to accommodate 500 women, the gym
facility groaned under a class enrollment of nearly twice
that number last fall. (This figure includes the
approximately 100 men who take part in coed classes at
the women's gym each quarter.)
The demand for floor space in the gym is such that it is
virtually impossible for a girl to shoot a few baskets or
practice a dance routine during the day. In the evening,
serious athletes vie for time with men and women taking
advantages of recreation hours in the gym. Female
gymnasts have to go to the men's gym to find room for
non-class exercise during the afternoon.
The women's gym, tennis courts, pool and field all do
double and triple duty for classes, workouts and
recreation. Tennis courts are tied up with classes from 10
a.m. until just before dusk Monday through Thursday
while the 25-yard outdoor pool absorbs the activity that
was planned to be spread across a complex of three pools.
Four levels of swimming instruction, water safety

instructor and life-saving classes, as well as students taking
advantage of open recreation hours crowd the facility.
Because there is no track in the area, joggers co-exist with
soccer players and frisbee throwers when golfers are not
using the field for a driving range.
Athletic Priorities
Tailoring their policies and programs to fit the
limitations imposed by critically inadequate facilities, the
WPE department has established definite priorities.
When the gymnastics and track and field instructor left
the department last year, she was replaced by an
instructor who teaches swimming, tennis and conditioning
as well as gymnastics. Strathairn called gymnastics
"terrifically popular, more so than any other sport in
recent years," yet instruction here for women does not go
beyond the intermediate level.
Strathairn stated that it might even have been "an error
for Stanford to join the group of schools developing
gymnastics when we couldn't handle it." What Stanford
can't provide its female gymnasts is adequate storage
space for proper equipment, the scheduling of gymnasium
hours and faculty time away from other sports.
Graduate student Andrea Mattson is one of the few
girls who work on the tumbling mats and do free exercise
in the men's gym. She took up gymnastics at Stanford last
winter when WPE still offered girls Wednesday night and
Friday afternoon workouts in addition to advanced and
tournament classes.
Now, she says, "several top quality girls have quit
because they couldn't even get into the intermediate
class." She added that a girl who is anxious to work out,
but is just beginning in gymnastics, is at an obvious
disadvantage when she has to go to the men's gym. The

INADEQUATE FACILITIES—GirI's gymnastics program and Physical
Education (WPE) opportunities are severely limited by dated facilities. WPE
department priorities stress class instruction, not competition.
