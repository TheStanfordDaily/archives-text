## The 						Voices Of Building 10 
### 
Ralph kostant

(While researching a story on
the attic tunnel system of thâ€¢
Inner Quad, I overheard the
following conversation through an
air vent in the vicinity of Building
10.)
Voice 1: Oy vay ist mir! What to
do? What to do?
Voice 2: Now John, as my
personal adviser, I should think it
fitting for you to remain cool,
calm, and, I might go further to
say, collected. Especially in times
of great crisis for the University,
which is to say, when my job is at
stake.
Voice 1: But sir, wherever we
put the Campus Judicial Panel
hearings, they seem to find it.
Voice 2: By "they" do you mean
the demonstrators or the
de fen dents?
Voice 1: Does it matter?
Voice 2: Not really. Let us review
the situation rationally.
Voice 1: Well, you'll remember

that the student Senate, they
should choke on their resolutions,
refused to name students to the
SJC. They cited one of those
referendums, where the student
body voted for either an all
student judicial panel as they had
in 1967 or a student-faculty panel
that would hear cases involving
faculty.
Voice 2: What gall! Next they'll
be saying they should have had a
voice in the Franklin Inquisi. . . .
Damn it! It slipped out again!
Voice 1: I understand, sir. It
happens to all of us. Well,
claiming the right to a hearing
before a jury of their peers, they
paralyzed the judicial system.
Voice 2: And that was when I
gave the students my judicial
system.
Voice 1: Oh yes, sir! And, if I
may say so, it was a very Biblical
image. Moses descending from
Sinai, (Voice 2: Ye 5....) the

Holy Law in his hands, (Voice 2:
Yes. . . .) only to find the Israelis
had rejected him, his Law and his
God!
Voice 2: Can it, Schwartz.
Voice 1: But they didn't like it,
sir!
Voice 2: I know that! But who's
they? The student Senate! The
student body supported me! Why,
out of our first computer list of
50 students we found all five
panel members!
Voice 1: Of course, 75% of those
we asked refused to serve, many
of whom said they were observing
the ASSU boycott, and. . . .
Voice 2: Can it, Schwartz.
Voice 1: Well, sir, I just want to
give you all the facts, like Henry
Kissinger gives the other King
Richard.
Voice 2: Henry Kissinger you're
not. And the title is still President
Richard, for both of us, for the
time being.
Voice 1: I'm sorry sir, it slipped
out. Well, then we called our first
hearing for those ruffians from
the Placement Center. We
scheduled a 9 a.m. hearing at
Meyer Library, knowing that if
protesters attempted to block my
entry, we could have them
arrested. But they fooled us! They
let me in and blocked the entry of
the defendants.
Voice 2: They're clever, John. I'll
give them that much. But I've
faced cleverer opponents and
emerged victorious. Do you know
what they call me? "The man who
finally got Franklin."
Voice 1: You've got job security
now sir! Well, we then tried

holding CJP sessions at odd hours
and places, such as Saturday
morning at 8 a.m. at the Business
School, and not telling the
defendants. That worked pretty
well, but was too obvious. So we
tried one Monday at 8 a.m. at
Maples Pavilion. This time we told
the defendants, but figured the
protesters wouldn't find us.
Voice 2: And?
Voice 1: They found us. But there
were less of them! And we kept
them out of the hearing room.

The tide may be turning. We'll
keep them off balance by moving
back and forth between Maples
and the Biz school. With a little
luck, not even KZSU will be able
to find us. Then we can have our
type of hearing!
Voice 2: If only the Super Bowl
committee hadn't rejected our
plan to use the football stadium!
John, do you hear a scurrying
sound from above the ceiling?
