## Vote No On Fee Assessment 
###

And so it goes, another
quarter, another fee assessment.
Once again, Stanford students
have the opportunity to vote on
the Child Care Center, whether or
not to assess themselves one dollar
for its support.
Last quarter, some of you
might remember, the students did
just that. The Child Care
referendum was defeated by
nearly two hundred votes. One
would think that this decision
would be final, and that students
would not get an instant replay,
with all the accompanying waste
of effort and money (the
Elections Commissioner gets paid
for running this election)
involved. One would be wrong.
Thus, even as all but the most
hardhearted of us are being
haunted by the specter of small
children crying for a Day Care
Center on campus, the need for
hard facts concerning the Center
is pressing.
Facts
Fact: The Child Care Center
has not in the past and does not
intend to serve Stanford students.
No more than one hundred
families have used the present
Child Care services at any one
time. Of these, the majority are
not students. The percentage of
Stanford students who are
married, have children of
nursery-school age, and have no
access to any other Childrens
Center in the immediate area is
tiny if it exists at all.
The proposed Center will serve
the children of staff. This is not to
imply that staff families do not
need or deserve such facilities.
Rather, why should students pay
for staff? Should the staff be
assessed a dollar per quarter to
finance a student facility?
Fact: There are at least
thirty-eight Day Nurseries in
operation right now between San
Mateo and Mountain View. Of

these, 17 are in Palo Alto, 12 are
in Menlo Park, and 3 in East Palo
Alto. A quick perusal of the"Day
Nursery" section of the Palo Alto
telephone book will confirm this.
These private facilities include
church-related co-operative,
Montessori, and regular
garden-variety nursery schools.
In addition, there is the
Sojourner Truth Child Care
Center in Palo Alto (not listed in
the Yellow Pages) if you are of
the Venceremos persuasion. Quite
obviously, there are plenty of
Child Care Centers to go around.
The proposed Stanford Center
represents at best a convenience,
not a need. Judging by the small
number of families, let alone
student families, which have
utilized the Stanford Center in the
past, the convenience is hardly
worth $12,000 worth of taxation.
License
Fact: According to the
proponents of the assessment, the
money will be used not for the
actual operation of the Center,
but for preliminary work which
will enable it to get a license from
the State of California. This leaves
the question, what will happen
when and if the license is granted?
Who will pay for the facility then?
Will there be another student fee
to cover the costs of operations?
What assurance is there that a
license will be granted? The
potential that the Stanford Center
will become a $12,000 white
elephant is too great to warrant a
compulsory fee assessment.
Fact: The Child Care Center
proponents have never mounted a
campaign to finance the Center
through voluntary contribution
except for the few days following
the defeat of the fee assessment
last October. Instead, they are, in
effect, taking the easiest route
available, the referendum. By
doing so, they need not devote
much attention to facts such as
who will be benefited or what else
is available.
Test
They may spend what must be
a considerable amount of money
printing up large pictures of small
children happily at play, hoping
that such an approach will
persuade 50% plus 1 to spend the
money of the others. The only
real test of the value of any
enterprise is the amount of
support it can gain on its own

merits. Any other test, such as a
fee referendum, is coercive.
Those who favor the Child
Care center are hoping that the
soft spots in our hearts for little
kids are equaled or exceeded by
the soft spots in our heads. The
issue, however, is not little kids; it
is whether or not all students are

to pay for the convenience of a
very few.
If you choose to give money to
an organization, that's fine. If you
are forced to "give," that's
coercion.
