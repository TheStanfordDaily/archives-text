Fast
Editor, THE DAILY:
This weekend a group of
students fasted. They were and
are still fasting because they are
firmly committed to Peace and
Justice. They are asking the
Stanford Administration to
declare a moratorium on Military
and para-militarv recruiting, the
CJP proceedings, and to arrange
an open meeting between the
students and the President of this
University.
Those three requests are not
particularly ouUandish. They are
not asking the Administration to
decide anything about the
Placement center issue
immediately, only to allow the
Community a chance to pause and
really have time to reflect on the
events of the past two weeks, the
question of War involvement, and
student input into decisions at
Stanford.
On the CJP issue, they have
again taken a mild stance. They
are asking only that the present
stacked system be halted until a
more equitable one can be devised
to replace it. When the Student
Senate refused to place students
on the old SJC, it was hoped that
the Committee of Fifteen would
begin to earnestly consider the
question of revising the Charter.
Instead, the C-15 not only did not
produce, but did not meet for the
duration of Winter Quarter until
just last Thursday. The fasters ask
for commitment on the part of
the Administration to stop the
CJP until there is some real
consideration of the student
grievances against the present and
old systems.
Finally, they are asking that the
man who ultimately controls many
aspects of the University take
time to meet with the people
whose lives he is affecting. Again,
this certainly does not seem
unreasonable.
Last Friday, a group of Faculty
condemned the bombing attempt
on Professor Dornbusch's home

and offered a $5000 reward for
information leading to the arrest
of the person responsible. I have
been asked why the Council of
Presidents didn't join in this
condemnation. I ask in return,
when has the Faculty condemned
the burning of student
dormitories? Where is the outcry
against the use of police against
non-violent protestors?
I do condemn vehemently the
bombing attempt at the
Dornbusch residence. If those
members of the faculty are really
against violence, they will support
the protests of the fasters; they
will speak out against the
complicity of the University in
the slaughter of S.E. Asians.

Support For Shockley
Editor,THE DAILY:
The opposition to Professor
Shockley's views is grounded
neither in fact, logic, nor moral
outrage. The shrill moral outrage
is a mere mask behind which hide
two powerful vested interests. For
a university that claims to be as
sophisticated as Stanford, the
unmasking of Shockley's
opponents is long overdue.
One vested interest is that of
the environmentalists, who have
established a far-reaching
academic and research empire.
This empire is very lucrative.
Obviously, if Shockley is right,
the empire of the
environmentalists is threatened.
The level of moral noise that they
have raised suggests that they
cannot deal with Shockley in the
realm of fact and logic and have no
other recourse for the defense of
their fat pocketbooks.
Fierce moral noises always
result when a man of science
enters a preserve of charlatans.
Moral outrage was heaped upon
Galileo by the Church in defense
of its material interest, and upon
doctors of medicine by

witchdoctors. Every Marxist
knowns that moral outrage is a
sign that the moralizer's
pocketbook is threatened.
The other vested interest is that
of the left. Environmentalism
teaches that all faults are due to
society. Thus, this liberal dogma is
a vehicle for revolution, through
which the left's leaders hope to
gain positions of power and
wealth. Unable to produce any
ideas of its own, the left
frantically clings to
environmentalism as its
justification. Thus, the opponents
of Shockley stand unmasked,
naked in their greed.
A good Marxian analysis
spares no one. It is Shockley's
pocketbook that spurs him to
brave the moral noises. He knows
that if he is right, his pocketbook
will diminish through taxes to pay
the way for those who are not
equipped genetically to make it
on their own.

CSEA-SEA Meeting
Editor, THE DAILY:
I feel there should be a reply to
the article in the Daily of Feb.
11th about the CSEA-SEA
Meeting.
I was personally invited to this
meeting by Mr. Young, of CSEA
to ask questions as this was to be
an open forum.
The meeting ran smooth till the
first question was asked. Because
any question is antagonistic that
can not be answered by the truth.
At one point the question was
raised if it was true that Samuel
A. Holmes has .ii the past
represented mostly Employers in
the majority of cases that he has
handled. He side stepped this
question and never did answer. I
ff el that it is difficult to represent
tiie management for a length of
time and then change teams and
represent the workers.

All questions by the
Teamsters', USE and SEA
interested people were either left
unanswered, sidestepped or
evaded by half truths.
At one time there was a
question by myself about the
handling of a grievance by SEA, at
this time I, not Rudy Tham, was
told to "conduct myself as a
adult". Since I was asked to this
meeting to ask questions of the
CSEA officials I considered this
the adult way to conduct myself.
As to the shoving match in the
halls of the Cummings Building,
this was completely one sided by
Mike Fineo, who was completely
flustered because he had to alibi
for the do nothingness of himself
in his handling of my grievances.
As we try to decide whether to
vote for one of the two
organizations, or an experienced
union, we should look back at
SEA over the past years and see
how it looks to us on the issues of
importances. To me it looks like a
two faced organization, one face
is the Unviersity's and the other is
Mike Fineo's.

Arena
Editor, THE DAILY:
The reason and context of
Student Senate Chairman
Jefferson's ruling to bar Arena
photographers from taking
pictures of the Student Senate
were completely ignored in Scott
Burke's letter to the Daily that
appeared on February 10. We
have learned in the past that the
Arena, the official organ of the
notorious Free Campus
Movement, has provided
photographs to community and
campus authorities to identify
campus activists for the purpose
of making arrests. There is no
reason why Senators whose
pictures may be used for such
purposes should not only tolerate,
but vote to approve the presence
of these photographers (how
many people would volunteer to
sit for an FBI photography
session)?
Burke's request that "those

who voted to muzzle the free
press at the last Senate meeting
respect my right not to hear their
voices, and refrain forever from
speaking in public .. . since the
entire community would benefit
very greatly if they agreed to it" is
revealing. First, barring the Arena
from photographing is not
muzzling the "free press," as any
newspaper which collaborates
with the repressive forces of
society is not free. Secondly, the
statement shows how liberals are
unwittingly duped to support the
"freedoms" that are provided for
the privileged few of this society.
For these reasons, it is no
coincidence that all the Black
Senators, best understanding the
repressive nature of this society,
voted along with the radical
Senators to oust the Arena
photographer.

ASSU Senators
Correction
Editor, THE DAILY:
I wish to correct an error of
fact in the Daily editorial of
February 14 on "Moratoria
Demands."
The Committee on Services to
Students has not "supported an
end to war-elated recruitment."
The Committee, by an 8-1 vote,
recommends an end to military
recruitment at the formal
placement facilities of Stanford
University. A resolution urging
that some companies producing
weapons of war be barred was
defeated 5-4, meaning that the
majority of the Committee feels
that no restrictions should be put
on recruiting by "war-related"
industries. The student
referendum which the Committee
recommends (by another 5-4
vote) is different from an ASSU
referendum, in that all students
would receive a ballot and a set of
arguments on both sides of the
issue.
Perhaps this will clear up some
misinformation.
