## A 						Tale For Grown-Ups

cem cem cakmak

Once upon a time in a remote
and unknown corner of the world
there was a country where the
waters were abundant, the roads
were redundant, the land was
fertile, and the learned men were
of high dignity.
Everyone was merely after his
own interest and no one ever
cared about another's distress.
He who was well fed and warm
thought everybody else to be the
same.
One day, someone from this
peace-loving liberal community
suddenly threw himself on the
streets, shouting to his death:
"Ouuugghh! Aagghh! Help,
help me, please, ohh! I am being
staked, I, staked, ouuvhh, agghh,
help! help. .. At first no one
payed the slightest attention to
him; everybody peacefully went
about his business, nobody cared
in the least! But the man's cry
was so high, mighty and persistent
that the inhabitants of the
country became quite disturbed,
restless, and soon thereafter, quite
anxious!
At last, the security and
peace-keeping prefects and
policemen of the city arrested the
ever-moaning man, and looked
closely around him to see whether
there really was any stick going
through him. They did not see
anything of that kind. "This man
is a liar" they said, "he shouts,
boisters, and disturbs the people's
peace". And they ostracised the
poor man, put him in a cave in the
remotest part of the country.
Policemen
The time went by as usual until
one day the people heard the
outrageous cries of the policemen
who had arrested the
trouble-maker. "Help!
Help! ... A stake is transfixing
me .. . Ahh! Ohh! ... A stake is
in me, ougghh, please, it's piercing
me, help, help!" There was such a
burst of cries that the earth
trembled. They were captured and
brought to the jurisdiction of the
'Kadi' (grey-haired religious
judge). Kadi, after a long and
close scrutiny, even using his
hands, came to the conclusion
that there was not any stake
entering them.
Upon his verdict they were

chained and thrown into a
notorious catacomb.
Again there was peace and
tranquility. Suddenly, one day
Kadi also, running wildly all over,
his imperial gown flying in the
wind, his reverent cap off his bold
head, started screaming: "Agghh!
my ... ugghh! Ohh, God! Please!
The stick! I'm being drilled, ohh,
that stick." His scream was as
might as his official position; it
reached up the stairs of the Palace
to the sensitive ears of the Sultan.
Increasingly amazed, Sultan
convened his wise men. "What the
hell is this. Even Kadi got
sticked!" said he, and ordered:
"Go and see whether there is
really a stick in Kadi". The
Surgeon General went to Kadi's
place, and turned him upside
down, searched him all over
thoroughly. Finally, rather
embarrassed and disappointed, he
issued a report stating that,
"Although no stick was seen
through Kadi's body, he,
evidently, for evil reasons, thinks
that some stick is drilling him. I,
hereby, urgently recommend that
he be sent to a lunatic asylum, for
he is out of his mind". Poor Kadi
was locked in a madhouse.
But, after a while, one fine
early morning, the Surgeon
General who had not seen the
stick impaling the Kadi threw
himself out from his warm bed to
the streets and cried out,
terror-stricken: "Help,
help . . . Ogghh! Aghh! Now, that
stake is driving in me, ouugghh, he
cried madly. Those who saw
the Surgeon General in such a
desperate and rather ludicrous
situation could not help laughing.
Fabrications
"This is too much!" roared the
King-Sultan, "this is absolute
nonsense, they all complain about
some stakes, but no one has been
able to see any, damn it! All
wicked fabrication!" he said.
Upon his Majesty's
request a committee of three
distinguished scholars was duly
formed from among the faculty of
the country's most famous
School. The honorable committee
members ended their inquiry
without success, with a statement
affirming that "despite all the

efforts to observe whether any
in-or-outgoing stake exists, we
were totally unable to see
anything of the sort and
regretfully inform you that the
S.G. unbecomingly and
unashamedly tried to deceive us,
and in so doing hopes to provoke
people of this country against law
and order. The
next move was to tie up the S.G.
and exile him to a bare island.
Oddly enough, not long after
the S.G.'s unhappy fate, the three
eminent scholars started a
heart-breaking choral scream
which can not be imagined!
"Help! Ouuuh, help! Agghhh!
Good citizens, help, a stake is
stabbing me, it's in me, going,
ohh, going, ahhh! Help, help. ..
With great amazement, the Grand
Vezir of Religion, The Vezir of
Education, and the Prime Vezir of
Vezirs rebuked them and said:
"Behave yourselves, you fools!
Long before it was proved that
there is no such thing, don't make
noise". But later, realizing that
there was no use in reprimanding
them, they arrested and jailed
them.
But it did not take long before
all the Cabinet Ministers began
desperately yelling and running
with cries and implorings: "Ohhh!
Help our beloved citizens. Now,
it's drilling us too! Ooogghh!"
The King-Sultan, terribly
annoyed, roared: "What the hell
are you crying for! Apparently,
there is no s f ick or stake in sight!
You are lying, you, ungrateful
lot!" But all was useless because
the day came when almost
everybody in the country started
screaming, crying, bellowing in
the same way a? the others did
before. King-Sultan issued yet
another imperial edict stating that
those who were not hit by the
stake should investigate the ones
who complain about stakes. So
they did.
The happy and contented ones
held a rally before the Imperial
Palace shouting such slogans as,
"Down with Sticks!", "No stake
but beef-steak!", "Long live
King-Emperor, down with stake
monger!" etc. But their happiness
too did not last long. After some
time they also joined the crowd,

pain-stricken, crying, begging.
Helpless, everyone shouted
at each other: "You liar! I'm the
only one who is being drilled by
the stake! Ohh! Because of your
frantic cries no one hears my
lament!" Everyone accused others
of being selfish! With the clamour,
and uproar time went by.
Sufferings and miseries gradually
died out; no one raised his voice
any longer. They'd got inured to
stakes. All of a sudden,
roundabout midnight, an
incredible uproar burst out from
the windows of the Palace! It was
like an earthquake! Everybody
jumped out from his warm bed. It
was the King-Sultan, with his long
underpants, half-naked and
barefoot running wild to the
Market Place, throwing himself all
over and crying: don't stand
there! Ayyyiiyaahh!
Ouuggmmpphh! Why don't you
come and get this out of me!
People, with experienced eyes,
surrounding the King said, "Our
Highness! How can we take it
out?
Hold on a bit longer,
after a while, just like us, you'll
get used to it and be all right!"

fertile, and the learned men were
of high dignity.
Everyone was merely after his
own interest and no one ever
cared about another's distress.
He who was well fed and warm
thought everybody else to be the
same.
One day, someone from this
peace-loving liberal community
suddenly threw himself on the
streets, shouting to his death:
"Ouuugghh! Aagghh! Help,
help me, please, ohh! I am being
staked, I, staked, ouuvhh, agghh,
help! help. .. At first no one
payed the slightest attention to
him; everybody peacefully went
about his business, nobody cared
in the least! But the man's cry
was so high, mighty and persistent
that the inhabitants of the
country became quite disturbed,
restless, and soon thereafter, quite
anxious!
At last, the security and
peace-keeping prefects and
policemen of the city arrested the
ever-moaning man, and looked
closely around him to see whether
there really was any stick going
through him. They did not see
anything of that kind. "This man
is a liar" they said, "he shouts,
boisters, and disturbs the people's
peace". And they ostracised the
poor man, put him in a cave in the
remotest part of the country.
Policemen
The time went by as usual until
one day the people heard the
outrageous cries of the policemen
who had arrested the
trouble-maker. "Help!
Help! ... A stake is transfixing
me .. . Ahh! Ohh! ... A stake is
in me, ougghh, please, it's piercing
me, help, help!" There was such a
burst of cries that the earth
trembled. They were captured and
brought to the jurisdiction of the
'Kadi' (grey-haired religious
judge). Kadi, after a long and
close scrutiny, even using his
hands, came to the conclusion
that there was not any stake
entering them.
Upon his verdict they were

chained and thrown into a
notorious catacomb.
Again there was peace and
tranquility. Suddenly, one day
Kadi also, running wildly all over,
his imperial gown flying in the
wind, his reverent cap off his bold
head, started screaming: "Agghh!
my ... ugghh! Ohh, God! Please!
The stick! I'm being drilled, ohh,
that stick." His scream was as
might as his official position; it
reached up the stairs of the Palace
to the sensitive ears of the Sultan.
Increasingly amazed, Sultan
convened his wise men. "What the
hell is this. Even Kadi got
sticked!" said he, and ordered:
"Go and see whether there is
really a stick in Kadi". The
Surgeon General went to Kadi's
place, and turned him upside
down, searched him all over
thoroughly. Finally, rather
embarrassed and disappointed, he
issued a report stating that,
"Although no stick was seen
through Kadi's body, he,
evidently, for evil reasons, thinks
that some stick is drilling him. I,
hereby, urgently recommend that
he be sent to a lunatic asylum, for
he is out of his mind". Poor Kadi
was locked in a madhouse.
But, after a while, one fine
early morning, the Surgeon
General who had not seen the
stick impaling the Kadi threw
himself out from his warm bed to
the streets and cried out,
terror-stricken: "Help,
help . . . Ogghh! Aghh! Now, that
stake is driving in me, ouugghh, he
cried madly. Those who saw
the Surgeon General in such a
desperate and rather ludicrous
situation could not help laughing.
Fabrications
"This is too much!" roared the
King-Sultan, "this is absolute
nonsense, they all complain about
some stakes, but no one has been
able to see any, damn it! All
wicked fabrication!" he said.
Upon his Majesty's
request a committee of three
distinguished scholars was duly
formed from among the faculty of
the country's most famous
School. The honorable committee
members ended their inquiry
without success, with a statement
affirming that "despite all the

efforts to observe whether any
in-or-outgoing stake exists, we
were totally unable to see
anything of the sort and
regretfully inform you that the
S.G. unbecomingly and
unashamedly tried to deceive us,
and in so doing hopes to provoke
people of this country against law
and order. The
next move was to tie up the S.G.
and exile him to a bare island.
Oddly enough, not long after
the S.G.'s unhappy fate, the three
eminent scholars started a
heart-breaking choral scream
which can not be imagined!
"Help! Ouuuh, help! Agghhh!
Good citizens, help, a stake is
stabbing me, it's in me, going,
ohh, going, ahhh! Help, help. ..
With great amazement, the Grand
Vezir of Religion, The Vezir of
Education, and the Prime Vezir of
Vezirs rebuked them and said:
"Behave yourselves, you fools!
Long before it was proved that
there is no such thing, don't make
noise". But later, realizing that
there was no use in reprimanding
them, they arrested and jailed
them.
But it did not take long before
all the Cabinet Ministers began
desperately yelling and running
with cries and implorings: "Ohhh!
Help our beloved citizens. Now,
it's drilling us too! Ooogghh!"
The King-Sultan, terribly
annoyed, roared: "What the hell
are you crying for! Apparently,
there is no s f ick or stake in sight!
You are lying, you, ungrateful
lot!" But all was useless because
the day came when almost
everybody in the country started
screaming, crying, bellowing in
the same way a? the others did
before. King-Sultan issued yet
another imperial edict stating that
those who were not hit by the
stake should investigate the ones
who complain about stakes. So
they did.
The happy and contented ones
held a rally before the Imperial
Palace shouting such slogans as,
"Down with Sticks!", "No stake
but beef-steak!", "Long live
King-Emperor, down with stake
monger!" etc. But their happiness
too did not last long. After some
time they also joined the crowd,

pain-stricken, crying, begging.
Helpless, everyone shouted
at each other: "You liar! I'm the
only one who is being drilled by
the stake! Ohh! Because of your
frantic cries no one hears my
lament!" Everyone accused others
of being selfish! With the clamour,
and uproar time went by.
Sufferings and miseries gradually
died out; no one raised his voice
any longer. They'd got inured to
stakes. All of a sudden,
roundabout midnight, an
incredible uproar burst out from
the windows of the Palace! It was
like an earthquake! Everybody
jumped out from his warm bed. It
was the King-Sultan, with his long
underpants, half-naked and
barefoot running wild to the
Market Place, throwing himself all
over and crying: don't stand
there! Ayyyiiyaahh!
Ouuggmmpphh! Why don't you
come and get this out of me!
People, with experienced eyes,
surrounding the King said, "Our
Highness! How can we take it
out?
Hold on a bit longer,
after a while, just like us, you'll
get used to it and be all right!"

thought everybody else to be the
same.
One day, someone from this
peace-loving liberal community
suddenly threw himself on the
streets, shouting to his death:
"Ouuugghh! Aagghh! Help,
help me, please, ohh! I am being
staked, I, staked, ouuvhh, agghh,
help! help. .. At first no one
payed the slightest attention to
him; everybody peacefully went
about his business, nobody cared
in the least! But the man's cry
was so high, mighty and persistent
that the inhabitants of the
country became quite disturbed,
restless, and soon thereafter, quite
anxious!
At last, the security and
peace-keeping prefects and
policemen of the city arrested the
ever-moaning man, and looked
closely around him to see whether
there really was any stick going
through him. They did not see
anything of that kind. "This man
is a liar" they said, "he shouts,
boisters, and disturbs the people's
peace". And they ostracised the
poor man, put him in a cave in the
remotest part of the country.
Policemen
The time went by as usual until
one day the people heard the
outrageous cries of the policemen
who had arrested the
trouble-maker. "Help!
Help! ... A stake is transfixing
me .. . Ahh! Ohh! ... A stake is
in me, ougghh, please, it's piercing
me, help, help!" There was such a
burst of cries that the earth
trembled. They were captured and
brought to the jurisdiction of the
'Kadi' (grey-haired religious
judge). Kadi, after a long and
close scrutiny, even using his
hands, came to the conclusion
that there was not any stake
entering them.
Upon his verdict they were

chained and thrown into a
notorious catacomb.
Again there was peace and
tranquility. Suddenly, one day
Kadi also, running wildly all over,
his imperial gown flying in the
wind, his reverent cap off his bold
head, started screaming: "Agghh!
my ... ugghh! Ohh, God! Please!
The stick! I'm being drilled, ohh,
that stick." His scream was as
might as his official position; it
reached up the stairs of the Palace
to the sensitive ears of the Sultan.
Increasingly amazed, Sultan
convened his wise men. "What the
hell is this. Even Kadi got
sticked!" said he, and ordered:
"Go and see whether there is
really a stick in Kadi". The
Surgeon General went to Kadi's
place, and turned him upside
down, searched him all over
thoroughly. Finally, rather
embarrassed and disappointed, he
issued a report stating that,
"Although no stick was seen
through Kadi's body, he,
evidently, for evil reasons, thinks
that some stick is drilling him. I,
hereby, urgently recommend that
he be sent to a lunatic asylum, for
he is out of his mind". Poor Kadi
was locked in a madhouse.
But, after a while, one fine
early morning, the Surgeon
General who had not seen the
stick impaling the Kadi threw
himself out from his warm bed to
the streets and cried out,
terror-stricken: "Help,
help . . . Ogghh! Aghh! Now, that
stake is driving in me, ouugghh, he
cried madly. Those who saw
the Surgeon General in such a
desperate and rather ludicrous
situation could not help laughing.
Fabrications
"This is too much!" roared the
King-Sultan, "this is absolute
nonsense, they all complain about
some stakes, but no one has been
able to see any, damn it! All
wicked fabrication!" he said.
Upon his Majesty's
request a committee of three
distinguished scholars was duly
formed from among the faculty of
the country's most famous
School. The honorable committee
members ended their inquiry
without success, with a statement
affirming that "despite all the

efforts to observe whether any
in-or-outgoing stake exists, we
were totally unable to see
anything of the sort and
regretfully inform you that the
S.G. unbecomingly and
unashamedly tried to deceive us,
and in so doing hopes to provoke
people of this country against law
and order. The
next move was to tie up the S.G.
and exile him to a bare island.
Oddly enough, not long after
the S.G.'s unhappy fate, the three
eminent scholars started a
heart-breaking choral scream
which can not be imagined!
"Help! Ouuuh, help! Agghhh!
Good citizens, help, a stake is
stabbing me, it's in me, going,
ohh, going, ahhh! Help, help. ..
With great amazement, the Grand
Vezir of Religion, The Vezir of
Education, and the Prime Vezir of
Vezirs rebuked them and said:
"Behave yourselves, you fools!
Long before it was proved that
there is no such thing, don't make
noise". But later, realizing that
there was no use in reprimanding
them, they arrested and jailed
them.
But it did not take long before
all the Cabinet Ministers began
desperately yelling and running
with cries and implorings: "Ohhh!
Help our beloved citizens. Now,
it's drilling us too! Ooogghh!"
The King-Sultan, terribly
annoyed, roared: "What the hell
are you crying for! Apparently,
there is no s f ick or stake in sight!
You are lying, you, ungrateful
lot!" But all was useless because
the day came when almost
everybody in the country started
screaming, crying, bellowing in
the same way a? the others did
before. King-Sultan issued yet
another imperial edict stating that
those who were not hit by the
stake should investigate the ones
who complain about stakes. So
they did.
The happy and contented ones
held a rally before the Imperial
Palace shouting such slogans as,
"Down with Sticks!", "No stake
but beef-steak!", "Long live
King-Emperor, down with stake
monger!" etc. But their happiness
too did not last long. After some
time they also joined the crowd,

pain-stricken, crying, begging.
Helpless, everyone shouted
at each other: "You liar! I'm the
only one who is being drilled by
the stake! Ohh! Because of your
frantic cries no one hears my
lament!" Everyone accused others
of being selfish! With the clamour,
and uproar time went by.
Sufferings and miseries gradually
died out; no one raised his voice
any longer. They'd got inured to
stakes. All of a sudden,
roundabout midnight, an
incredible uproar burst out from
the windows of the Palace! It was
like an earthquake! Everybody
jumped out from his warm bed. It
was the King-Sultan, with his long
underpants, half-naked and
barefoot running wild to the
Market Place, throwing himself all
over and crying: don't stand
there! Ayyyiiyaahh!
Ouuggmmpphh! Why don't you
come and get this out of me!
People, with experienced eyes,
surrounding the King said, "Our
Highness! How can we take it
out?
Hold on a bit longer,
after a while, just like us, you'll
get used to it and be all right!"

Once upon a time in a remote

there was a country where the
waters were abundant, the roads
were redundant, the land was

"Ouuugghh! Aagghh! Help,
help me, please, ohh! I am being
staked, I, staked, ouuvhh, agghh,
help! help. .. At first no one
payed the slightest attention to
him; everybody peacefully went
about his business, nobody cared
in the least! But the man's cry
was so high, mighty and persistent
that the inhabitants of the
country became quite disturbed,
restless, and soon thereafter, quite
anxious!
At last, the security and
peace-keeping prefects and
policemen of the city arrested the
ever-moaning man, and looked
closely around him to see whether
there really was any stick going
through him. They did not see
anything of that kind. "This man
is a liar" they said, "he shouts,
boisters, and disturbs the people's
peace". And they ostracised the
poor man, put him in a cave in the
remotest part of the country.
Policemen
The time went by as usual until
one day the people heard the
outrageous cries of the policemen
who had arrested the
trouble-maker. "Help!
Help! ... A stake is transfixing
me .. . Ahh! Ohh! ... A stake is
in me, ougghh, please, it's piercing
me, help, help!" There was such a
burst of cries that the earth
trembled. They were captured and
brought to the jurisdiction of the
'Kadi' (grey-haired religious
judge). Kadi, after a long and
close scrutiny, even using his
hands, came to the conclusion
that there was not any stake
entering them.
Upon his verdict they were

chained and thrown into a
notorious catacomb.
Again there was peace and
tranquility. Suddenly, one day
Kadi also, running wildly all over,
his imperial gown flying in the
wind, his reverent cap off his bold
head, started screaming: "Agghh!
my ... ugghh! Ohh, God! Please!
The stick! I'm being drilled, ohh,
that stick." His scream was as
might as his official position; it
reached up the stairs of the Palace
to the sensitive ears of the Sultan.
Increasingly amazed, Sultan
convened his wise men. "What the
hell is this. Even Kadi got
sticked!" said he, and ordered:
"Go and see whether there is
really a stick in Kadi". The
Surgeon General went to Kadi's
place, and turned him upside
down, searched him all over
thoroughly. Finally, rather
embarrassed and disappointed, he
issued a report stating that,
"Although no stick was seen
through Kadi's body, he,
evidently, for evil reasons, thinks
that some stick is drilling him. I,
hereby, urgently recommend that
he be sent to a lunatic asylum, for
he is out of his mind". Poor Kadi
was locked in a madhouse.
But, after a while, one fine
early morning, the Surgeon
General who had not seen the
stick impaling the Kadi threw
himself out from his warm bed to
the streets and cried out,
terror-stricken: "Help,
help . . . Ogghh! Aghh! Now, that
stake is driving in me, ouugghh, he
cried madly. Those who saw
the Surgeon General in such a
desperate and rather ludicrous
situation could not help laughing.
Fabrications
"This is too much!" roared the
King-Sultan, "this is absolute
nonsense, they all complain about
some stakes, but no one has been
able to see any, damn it! All
wicked fabrication!" he said.
Upon his Majesty's
request a committee of three
distinguished scholars was duly
formed from among the faculty of
the country's most famous
School. The honorable committee
members ended their inquiry
without success, with a statement
affirming that "despite all the

efforts to observe whether any
in-or-outgoing stake exists, we
were totally unable to see
anything of the sort and
regretfully inform you that the
S.G. unbecomingly and
unashamedly tried to deceive us,
and in so doing hopes to provoke
people of this country against law
and order. The
next move was to tie up the S.G.
and exile him to a bare island.
Oddly enough, not long after
the S.G.'s unhappy fate, the three
eminent scholars started a
heart-breaking choral scream
which can not be imagined!
"Help! Ouuuh, help! Agghhh!
Good citizens, help, a stake is
stabbing me, it's in me, going,
ohh, going, ahhh! Help, help. ..
With great amazement, the Grand
Vezir of Religion, The Vezir of
Education, and the Prime Vezir of
Vezirs rebuked them and said:
"Behave yourselves, you fools!
Long before it was proved that
there is no such thing, don't make
noise". But later, realizing that
there was no use in reprimanding
them, they arrested and jailed
them.
But it did not take long before
all the Cabinet Ministers began
desperately yelling and running
with cries and implorings: "Ohhh!
Help our beloved citizens. Now,
it's drilling us too! Ooogghh!"
The King-Sultan, terribly
annoyed, roared: "What the hell
are you crying for! Apparently,
there is no s f ick or stake in sight!
You are lying, you, ungrateful
lot!" But all was useless because
the day came when almost
everybody in the country started
screaming, crying, bellowing in
the same way a? the others did
before. King-Sultan issued yet
another imperial edict stating that
those who were not hit by the
stake should investigate the ones
who complain about stakes. So
they did.
The happy and contented ones
held a rally before the Imperial
Palace shouting such slogans as,
"Down with Sticks!", "No stake
but beef-steak!", "Long live
King-Emperor, down with stake
monger!" etc. But their happiness
too did not last long. After some
time they also joined the crowd,

pain-stricken, crying, begging.
Helpless, everyone shouted
at each other: "You liar! I'm the
only one who is being drilled by
the stake! Ohh! Because of your
frantic cries no one hears my
lament!" Everyone accused others
of being selfish! With the clamour,
and uproar time went by.
Sufferings and miseries gradually
died out; no one raised his voice
any longer. They'd got inured to
stakes. All of a sudden,
roundabout midnight, an
incredible uproar burst out from
the windows of the Palace! It was
like an earthquake! Everybody
jumped out from his warm bed. It
was the King-Sultan, with his long
underpants, half-naked and
barefoot running wild to the
Market Place, throwing himself all
over and crying: don't stand
there! Ayyyiiyaahh!
Ouuggmmpphh! Why don't you
come and get this out of me!
People, with experienced eyes,
surrounding the King said, "Our
Highness! How can we take it
out?
Hold on a bit longer,
after a while, just like us, you'll
get used to it and be all right!"
