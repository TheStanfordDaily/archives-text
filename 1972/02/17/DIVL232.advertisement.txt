you'll do work traditionally done by lawyers
— work which is challenging, responsible
and intellectually stimulating. Lawyer's
Assistants are now so critically needed that
The Institute for Paralegal Training can
offer you a position in the city of your choice
— and a higher starting salary than you'd
expect as a recent college graduate. Here
is a career as a professional with financial
rewards that increase with your developing
expertise.
If you are a student of high academic
standing and are interested in a legal
career, come speak with our representative.
Contact the Placement Office.
