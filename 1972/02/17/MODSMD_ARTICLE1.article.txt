# Gibbs Focuses On Undergraduate Education
## 
### BOB MICHELET (Second of three parts 
In its extensive work, the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) paid
special attention to the quality of
undergraduate education, and one of
its most significant recommendations
was the creation of the job of Dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
In one of its nine reports, published
in 1969, the SES Steering Committee
said, "Stanford needs what it has never
had, a steady focus on its education of
undergraduates . . .
"Budgetary leverage and personal
leadership will be required to sustain
the enhanced attention to the
education of undergraduates that is so
clearly called for," the report said.
"There has to be an administrative
'somebody' to exercise this leverage
and leadership."
That "somebody" is James Gibbs, a
professor of Anthropology, who was
named the first Dean of
Undergraduate Studies in April, 1970.
The creation of an Office and Dean of
Undergraduate Studies is consistently
pointed to as one of the most
important SES recommendations.
Sense of Concern
In a recent report on the first year
of his office, Gibbs says its activities
"have strengthened the University's
sense of concern about undergraduate
education."
Gibbs says his office has "defined
three major areas of responsibility:
administering and coordinating
curricular and non-curricular academic
services that transcend schools and

departments; stimulating innovation in
undergraduate education; and the
advocacy of undergraduate
education."
He notes that the "strongest
impact" of Office activities has been
"in the provision of curricular and
non-curricular academic services," but
admits that "in the roles of stimulating
innovation and advocacy of
undergraduate education our impact
has been less dramatic and more
subtle."
Gibbs points to student-initiated
programs such as SWOPSI, SCIRE and
Urban Studies, and to the
Undergraduate Special Program as
"designed to widen the range of
options open to undergraduate
students by introducing innovative
modes of instruction and additional
curricular content."
His report also notes several
changes in the advising system,
especially for freshmen. SES devoted
an entire report to advising and many
of its recommendations have been
followed.
"The SES recommendations
necessitated a massive reorganization
of both the nature and the amount of
information available to the student
body and faculty," he says. In order to
meet these needs, an Academic
Information Center was opened in the
Old Union in 1970, and publications
such as Approaching Stanford have
been revised.
New Emphasis
The most important development
has been a new emphasis on freshman

advising in residences, and the shift in
responsibility for advising from the
Registrar's Office to the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
Another area of SES concern was
admissions and financial aid. Acting on
an SES suggestion, the Academic
Senate formed a new Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid.
Materials Science Professor Arthur
Bienenstock, who has chaired the
committee since its formation, says it
"has come a long way on SES
recommendations," adding that the
"goals of SES have for the most part
been achieved."
Bienenstock notes that much of the
initiative for implementation of SES
recommendations has come through
Dean of Admissions Fred Hardagon.
Bienenstock says the committee has
had "great confidence" in Hargadon,
and has not wanted to "tie the hands"
of the Dean with "the simplistic
schemes of SES."
For this reason, he says, the
committee has "not followed the
procedural instructions of SES," but
still has implemented a good part of its
recommendations.
Expansion
Bienenstock points especially to an
expansion (from 1600 to 9200) of the
number of high schools receiving
admissions information about
Stanford, and to new means "by
which the criteria for admissions can
be broadened and diversified."
"The application form has been
modified so that more stress is placed

on the reporting of outstanding
nonacademic achievements,"
Bienenstock said in a November, 1970
report. Three College Board
Achievement Tests are also now
required for admission.
In a report on "University
Residences and Campus Life," SES
said "the problem of creating a
campus community, a pleasant and
stimulating place in which to live and
work, demands our constant concern."
The majority of SES
recommendations in this area,
however, remain merely suggestions,
largely due to financial shortages.
Among its recommendations, SES
proposed 50 new apartment units for
graduate students and young faculty,
recreation and meeting facilities for
Escondido Village, a campus "Main
Street" of shops between Dinkelspiel
and Campus Drive, and, "as a matter
of highest priority," the construction
of new residences for undergraduates.
Of these and other proposals, only
a few have approached or entered the
implementation stage. The Planning
Office says there are no plans for any
new undergraduate dorms, and
Manzanita Park, once considered a
stopgap housing measure, seems
headed for a long life.
Implementation of SES
recommendations in most areas has
been good. Many admit, however, that
SES was weak in its analysis of
graduate education, and another, more
probing study is being prepared for
release soon.

FlRST—Anthropology professor James Gibbs was the choice to be the first Dean
of Undergraduate Studies when the position was created in 1970.
Financial problems have of course
been a factor in SES implementation.
Gibbs notes that "we have not been
able to move as fast" in areas of
student services and innovative
education due to budget shortages.
He adds, though, that University
officials have been "reasonably
generous to our office," and that it has
"not been deprived absolutely,"
considering the general availability of
funds these days.
The office's operation has not been
without its problems, however. Some
disagreement has arisen, for example,
over the increased role of the Office of

Dean of Undergraduate Studies
(O-DUS) in programs such as SWOPSI
and SCIRE.
SCIRE Director Jane Huseby notes
that at least 1/3 of her program's
budget is now controlled by the
O-DUS, and that the Policy Boards of
both SWOPSI and SCIRE have lost
their power to grant course credit.
The Policy Boards now act only as
advisory committees, and the final
decision for credit rests with the Dean
and the chairman of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies.
Huseby says that the O-DUS is
generally working well, but notes that
"for student programs it's still a

problem. It's still important," she says,
"that we have some mutual respect
going."
Gibbs, though pleased with
first-year progress, admits that staff
shortages have created problems, and
feels additional staff is needed "to
permit us to spend less time in
managing ongoing programs and more
time in liasion, long-range planning,
an; more creative performance of our
roles as stimulator of innovation and
advocate for undergraduate
education."
