## DicK, Chou Broach Vietnam Peace Issue 
### 
-concerned asian scholars

The setting is the Great Hall of
the People in Peking. President
Nixon, Premier Chou En-lai and a
bevy of translators, having
engaged in an appropriate amount
of small talk settle back in their
chairs to discuss the major item
on their agenda: peace in
Indochina. The optimistic
American President broaches the
issue. .. .
NIXON: Well, Premier, don't you
agree that my government's offer
for peace in Southeast Asia is
equitable? Take, for instance, our
offer that South Vietnam's future
is to be determined bv elections
six months after an agreement.
This election will permit all
political forces to be represented
and will be internationally
supervised. President Thieu and
Vice President Hoang will resign
one month before such an
election, and we promise to abide
by the results of this election."
CHOU: "Well, Dick,-do you
mind if I call you Dick—we have
to give you credit; you are
marvelous at dealing with the
politics of an issue but now let's
deal with the issue. Your plan
virtually assures the perpetuation
of the present Saigon government
because of the system of elections
which you devise. We are not
naive enough to believe that
President Thieu would have
resigned if he felt there was the
slightest possibility that he would
not be reelected. We all
remember, too, that international
supervision of elections is
meaningless; you were Vice
President when Eisenhower
decided to ignore the provision
for elections in Vietnam back in
1956.
"A second point that follows
from this, Dick, is that your plan
allows the present Saigon
bureaucracy, and its agents in the
provinces of South Viet Nam, to
continue with their present work.
Under this arrangement nothing
prevents President Thieu from
pressuring his own appointees, in
both the military and in the
provincial governments, to secure
for him another overwhelming
election "victory" like he
engineered for himself in 1971.
"Furthermore, Dick, we have
every reason to believe that while
there may weli be a ceasefire
during the election, Saigon's
police force, which is
indistinguishable fro«i the
military in its functioning, will
continue its anti-communist work
under the guise of legitimate
police powers. A six month
interim during which Saigon
armed police forces would remain
intact would not provide adequate
security for N.L.F. supporters to
reveal their identities and
campaign openly for their cause.

"We suggest, Dick, that you
take another look at the
seven-point peace plan of the
N.L.F. where they call for the
formation of an interim
government in which they share a
measure of real political power.
Only then will they be in a
position to check the
anti-communist repression of the
Saigon armed forces and the
Saigon police forces. Only with
this guarantee of sharing real
political power in the interim
period can the patriotic forces
dare to expose themselves and
campaign for political office."
DICK: "Well, Premier, I can see
you haven't fully grasped just how
generous our proposal is. For
instance, we have proposed that as
part of a ceasefire there will be no
further infiltration of outside
forces into any of the countries of
Indochina. Now, isn't that fair
enough?"
CHOU: "Come on, Dick, let's get
back to the fundamentals. First of
all, you are asking the North
Vietnamese to accept the
definition of 'outside forces.' You
are, in effect, asking them to
withdraw in the absence of an
acceptable resolution of the
issues.
"Secondly, Dick, without a
firm pledge from you to halt all
material aid to the Thieu regime,
the North Vietnamese and the
N.L.F. would be foolish not to see
this as an attempt to buy time for
the Saigon regime; don't forget,
the patriotic Vietnamese are
winning. The only viable proposal
you can make is to cease all aid to
Saigon.
"Thirdly, now that the war
rages in Laos and Cambodia too,
it is not clear that the North
Vietnamese, or anyone else, can
call a ceasefire in those countries.
The North Vietnamese probably
feel that your country would use
any hostilities in those countries
as a pretext for U.S. reescalation
whenever you desired that course
of action.
'Finally, Dick, while you talk
about a ceasefire, you don't
mention limiting Thieu's use of
his police power. Saigon now has
one of the largest and most
repressive police forces in the
world. We are not naive enough to
think that Thieu will renounce
their use."
DICK: (An increasingly angry
President. .. .) "This isn't a
question of politics, it is a
question of humanitarianism and
how to build a generation of
peace. We propose that all
innocent civilians be released
parallel with troop withdrawals.
CHOU: "Yes, Dick, the question
is a generation of peace, isn't it?
We would like to know what you

mean by that word innocent
civilians? Are they prisoners who
are not political prisoners? Is the
inclusion of this world a device to
keep political prisoners in South
Vietnam in custody until after the
election? But even more
important, Dick, is your
systematic exaggeration of the
importance of the POW issue; it
has become a cloud to obscure the
real issue—total and complete
withdrawl of American troops
unconditionally. It is another
manifestation of your disregard of
all non-American lives.
"You never mention all the
POWs held in the South that are
detained in far worse conditions
than those held in the North. For
example, we noted that inspection
of North Vietnamese camps has
failed not due to North

Vietnamese refusal but due to the
failure of the South to allow
reciprocal inspection.
"Bluntly, Dick, the crux of the
matter is a political settlement in
Indochina, and this can be
accomplished only after all your
forces and aid are withdrawn The
Vietnamese people understand
only too well the dynamics of
American influence in the Saigon
regime."
DICK: "But Premier, we do say
that within six months of the
signing of such an agreement, we
will withdraw from South
Vietnam."
CHOU: "Yes I know, Dick, but
what about continued aid to
Saigon; your proposals have no
provisions for either a weapons
embargo or an embargo on
non-military "advisors." Also, it is

possible that what appears to be a
generous offer of aid to the
Indochinese people may in fact
become a vast new infusion of life
into the corpses of the Cambodian
and Laotian pro-American
regimes. If I may be direct again,
Dick, your withdrawal of troops is
not enough if it is tied to all sorts
of other conditions and if it
means there will be continued
American presence politically and
economically in South Vietnam."
DICK: "Well, Premier, I want to
make one thing perfectly clear
your stubbornness may mean
you'll have to deal with George
Wallace for the next four years;
but at least you won't have a Dick
Nixon to kick around anymore."

Saigon police forces. Only with
this guarantee of sharing real
political power in the interim
period can the patriotic forces
dare to expose themselves and
campaign for political office."
DICK: "Well, Premier, I can see
you haven't fully grasped just how
generous our proposal is. For
instance, we have proposed that as
part of a ceasefire there will be no
further infiltration of outside
forces into any of the countries of
Indochina. Now, isn't that fair
enough?"
CHOU: "Come on, Dick, let's get
back to the fundamentals. First of
all, you are asking the North
Vietnamese to accept the
definition of 'outside forces.' You
are, in effect, asking them to
withdraw in the absence of an
acceptable resolution of the
issues.
"Secondly, Dick, without a
firm pledge from you to halt all
material aid to the Thieu regime,
the North Vietnamese and the
N.L.F. would be foolish not to see
this as an attempt to buy time for
the Saigon regime; don't forget,
the patriotic Vietnamese are
winning. The only viable proposal
you can make is to cease all aid to
Saigon.
"Thirdly, now that the war
rages in Laos and Cambodia too,
it is not clear that the North
Vietnamese, or anyone else, can
call a ceasefire in those countries.
The North Vietnamese probably
feel that your country would use
any hostilities in those countries
as a pretext for U.S. reescalation
whenever you desired that course
of action.
'Finally, Dick, while you talk
about a ceasefire, you don't
mention limiting Thieu's use of
his police power. Saigon now has
one of the largest and most
repressive police forces in the
world. We are not naive enough to
think that Thieu will renounce
their use."
DICK: (An increasingly angry
President. .. .) "This isn't a
question of politics, it is a
question of humanitarianism and
how to build a generation of
peace. We propose that all
innocent civilians be released
parallel with troop withdrawals.
CHOU: "Yes, Dick, the question
is a generation of peace, isn't it?
We would like to know what you

mean by that word innocent
civilians? Are they prisoners who
are not political prisoners? Is the
inclusion of this world a device to
keep political prisoners in South
Vietnam in custody until after the
election? But even more
important, Dick, is your
systematic exaggeration of the
importance of the POW issue; it
has become a cloud to obscure the
real issue—total and complete
withdrawl of American troops
unconditionally. It is another
manifestation of your disregard of
all non-American lives.
"You never mention all the
POWs held in the South that are
detained in far worse conditions
than those held in the North. For
example, we noted that inspection
of North Vietnamese camps has
failed not due to North

Vietnamese refusal but due to the
failure of the South to allow
reciprocal inspection.
"Bluntly, Dick, the crux of the
matter is a political settlement in
Indochina, and this can be
accomplished only after all your
forces and aid are withdrawn The
Vietnamese people understand
only too well the dynamics of
American influence in the Saigon
regime."
DICK: "But Premier, we do say
that within six months of the
signing of such an agreement, we
will withdraw from South
Vietnam."
CHOU: "Yes I know, Dick, but
what about continued aid to
Saigon; your proposals have no
provisions for either a weapons
embargo or an embargo on
non-military "advisors." Also, it is

possible that what appears to be a
generous offer of aid to the
Indochinese people may in fact
become a vast new infusion of life
into the corpses of the Cambodian
and Laotian pro-American
regimes. If I may be direct again,
Dick, your withdrawal of troops is
not enough if it is tied to all sorts
of other conditions and if it
means there will be continued
American presence politically and
economically in South Vietnam."
DICK: "Well, Premier, I want to
make one thing perfectly clear
your stubbornness may mean
you'll have to deal with George
Wallace for the next four years;
but at least you won't have a Dick
Nixon to kick around anymore."

The setting is the Great Hall of
the People in Peking. President
Nixon, Premier Chou En-lai and a
bevy of translators, having
engaged in an appropriate amount
of small talk settle back in their
chairs to discuss the major item
on their agenda: peace in
Indochina. The optimistic
American President broaches the
issue. .. .
NIXON: Well, Premier, don't you
agree that my government's offer
for peace in Southeast Asia is
equitable? Take, for instance, our
offer that South Vietnam's future
is to be determined bv elections
six months after an agreement.
This election will permit all
political forces to be represented
and will be internationally
supervised. President Thieu and
Vice President Hoang will resign
one month before such an
election, and we promise to abide
by the results of this election."
CHOU: "Well, Dick,-do you
mind if I call you Dick—we have
to give you credit; you are
marvelous at dealing with the
politics of an issue but now let's
deal with the issue. Your plan
virtually assures the perpetuation
of the present Saigon government
because of the system of elections
which you devise. We are not
naive enough to believe that
President Thieu would have
resigned if he felt there was the
slightest possibility that he would
not be reelected. We all
remember, too, that international
supervision of elections is
meaningless; you were Vice
President when Eisenhower
decided to ignore the provision
for elections in Vietnam back in
1956.
"A second point that follows
from this, Dick, is that your plan
allows the present Saigon
bureaucracy, and its agents in the
provinces of South Viet Nam, to
continue with their present work.
Under this arrangement nothing
prevents President Thieu from
pressuring his own appointees, in
both the military and in the
provincial governments, to secure
for him another overwhelming
election "victory" like he
engineered for himself in 1971.
"Furthermore, Dick, we have
every reason to believe that while
there may weli be a ceasefire
during the election, Saigon's
police force, which is
indistinguishable fro«i the
military in its functioning, will
continue its anti-communist work
under the guise of legitimate
police powers. A six month
interim during which Saigon
armed police forces would remain
intact would not provide adequate
security for N.L.F. supporters to
reveal their identities and
campaign openly for their cause.

"We suggest, Dick, that you
take another look at the
seven-point peace plan of the
N.L.F. where they call for the
formation of an interim
government in which they share a
measure of real political power.
Only then will they be in a
position to check the
anti-communist repression of the
Saigon armed forces and the
Saigon police forces. Only with
this guarantee of sharing real
political power in the interim

dare to expose themselves and

of North Vietnamese camps has
failed not due to North

Vietnamese refusal but due to the
failure of the South to allow
reciprocal inspection.
"Bluntly, Dick, the crux of the
matter is a political settlement in
Indochina, and this can be
accomplished only after all your
forces and aid are withdrawn The
Vietnamese people understand
only too well the dynamics of
American influence in the Saigon
regime."
DICK: "But Premier, we do say
that within six months of the
signing of such an agreement, we
will withdraw from South
Vietnam."
CHOU: "Yes I know, Dick, but
what about continued aid to
Saigon; your proposals have no
provisions for either a weapons
embargo or an embargo on
non-military "advisors." Also, it is

possible that what appears to be a
generous offer of aid to the
Indochinese people may in fact
become a vast new infusion of life
into the corpses of the Cambodian
and Laotian pro-American
regimes. If I may be direct again,
Dick, your withdrawal of troops is
not enough if it is tied to all sorts
of other conditions and if it
means there will be continued
American presence politically and
economically in South Vietnam."
DICK: "Well, Premier, I want to
make one thing perfectly clear
your stubbornness may mean
you'll have to deal with George
Wallace for the next four years;
but at least you won't have a Dick
Nixon to kick around anymore."

-concerned asian scholars

The setting is the Great Hall of
the People in Peking. President
Nixon, Premier Chou En-lai and a
bevy of translators, having
engaged in an appropriate amount
of small talk settle back in their
chairs to discuss the major item
on their agenda: peace in
Indochina. The optimistic
American President broaches the
issue. .. .
NIXON: Well, Premier, don't you
agree that my government's offer
for peace in Southeast Asia is
equitable? Take, for instance, our
offer that South Vietnam's future
is to be determined bv elections
six months after an agreement.
This election will permit all
political forces to be represented
and will be internationally
supervised. President Thieu and
Vice President Hoang will resign
one month before such an
election, and we promise to abide
by the results of this election."
CHOU: "Well, Dick,-do you
mind if I call you Dick—we have
to give you credit; you are
marvelous at dealing with the
politics of an issue but now let's
deal with the issue. Your plan
virtually assures the perpetuation
of the present Saigon government
because of the system of elections
which you devise. We are not
naive enough to believe that
President Thieu would have
resigned if he felt there was the
slightest possibility that he would
not be reelected. We all
remember, too, that international
supervision of elections is
meaningless; you were Vice
President when Eisenhower
decided to ignore the provision
for elections in Vietnam back in
1956.
"A second point that follows
from this, Dick, is that your plan
allows the present Saigon
bureaucracy, and its agents in the
provinces of South Viet Nam, to
continue with their present work.
Under this arrangement nothing
prevents President Thieu from
pressuring his own appointees, in
both the military and in the
provincial governments, to secure
for him another overwhelming
election "victory" like he
engineered for himself in 1971.
"Furthermore, Dick, we have
every reason to believe that while
there may weli be a ceasefire
during the election, Saigon's
police force, which is
indistinguishable fro«i the
military in its functioning, will
continue its anti-communist work
under the guise of legitimate
police powers. A six month
interim during which Saigon
armed police forces would remain
intact would not provide adequate
security for N.L.F. supporters to
reveal their identities and
campaign openly for their cause.

"We suggest, Dick, that you
take another look at the
seven-point peace plan of the
N.L.F. where they call for the
formation of an interim
government in which they share a
measure of real political power.
Only then will they be in a
position to check the
anti-communist repression of the
Saigon armed forces and the
Saigon police forces. Only with
this guarantee of sharing real
political power in the interim
period can the patriotic forces
dare to expose themselves and
campaign for political office."
DICK: "Well, Premier, I can see
you haven't fully grasped just how
generous our proposal is. For
instance, we have proposed that as
part of a ceasefire there will be no
further infiltration of outside
forces into any of the countries of
Indochina. Now, isn't that fair
enough?"
CHOU: "Come on, Dick, let's get
back to the fundamentals. First of
all, you are asking the North
Vietnamese to accept the
definition of 'outside forces.' You
are, in effect, asking them to
withdraw in the absence of an
acceptable resolution of the
issues.
"Secondly, Dick, without a
firm pledge from you to halt all
material aid to the Thieu regime,
the North Vietnamese and the
N.L.F. would be foolish not to see
this as an attempt to buy time for
the Saigon regime; don't forget,
the patriotic Vietnamese are
winning. The only viable proposal
you can make is to cease all aid to
Saigon.
"Thirdly, now that the war
rages in Laos and Cambodia too,
it is not clear that the North
Vietnamese, or anyone else, can
call a ceasefire in those countries.
The North Vietnamese probably
feel that your country would use
any hostilities in those countries
as a pretext for U.S. reescalation
whenever you desired that course
of action.
'Finally, Dick, while you talk
about a ceasefire, you don't
mention limiting Thieu's use of
his police power. Saigon now has
one of the largest and most
repressive police forces in the
world. We are not naive enough to
think that Thieu will renounce
their use."
DICK: (An increasingly angry
President. .. .) "This isn't a
question of politics, it is a
question of humanitarianism and
how to build a generation of
peace. We propose that all
innocent civilians be released
parallel with troop withdrawals.
CHOU: "Yes, Dick, the question
is a generation of peace, isn't it?
We would like to know what you

mean by that word innocent
civilians? Are they prisoners who
are not political prisoners? Is the
inclusion of this world a device to
keep political prisoners in South
Vietnam in custody until after the
election? But even more
important, Dick, is your
systematic exaggeration of the
importance of the POW issue; it
has become a cloud to obscure the
real issue—total and complete
withdrawl of American troops
unconditionally. It is another
manifestation of your disregard of
all non-American lives.
"You never mention all the
POWs held in the South that are
detained in far worse conditions
than those held in the North. For
example, we noted that inspection
of North Vietnamese camps has
failed not due to North

Vietnamese refusal but due to the
failure of the South to allow
reciprocal inspection.
