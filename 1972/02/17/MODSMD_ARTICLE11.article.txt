## Public Enemy No. 1: Cockroaches 
### 
Steven g. ungar

New York, February 7 — It is a
mistake to believe that New
Yorkers are out of touch with
nature. This is nonsense. Nature
intrudes itself constantly into
every life in this city.
Not the neat, antiseptic, Sierra
Club "Central Park Country"
Nature; nature in the raw, in its
messiest, barnyard form. Snow
which quickly turns to slush; dog
manure on the sidewalks; tree sap
and pigeon droppings on your car;
and the cockroach.
The cockroach is a part of New
York, like the Hudson River or St.
Patrick's Cathedral. It is a reality
of the city, but one that never
penetrates the consciousness of
the nation.
New York is infested with
cockroaches; there is scarcely a
building in the city free of them.
The slums have rats, the old
mansions have termites; everyone
has cockroaches. Cockroaches are
as much a part of the fabric of life
as is the rising of the sun, the
setting of the soot.
Best Known City
This is probably the best
publicized city in the world. It is
the center of the nation's
publishing and communications
industries. When Walter Cronkite
and John Chancellor and Howard
K. Smith tell you what happened
in Kentucky, they are telling you
from New York.
Everyone knows the name of
the mayor of New York; who
knows the name of the mayor of
Tokyo, or London, or for that

matter, Detroit or Houston or San
Diego? You know about New
York because the people who are
responsible for telling you about
the world live here, so the local
scene gets better coverage than
any other place.
But the reality that is
transmitted to the outside about
life in New York is a different
reality than that experienced by
New Yorkers. Lindsay is a hero in
Arizona, but to most New
Yorkers he's a bum. Would
Lindsay be as popular in Klamath
Falls if the reality of New York,
as seen by its citizens, were the
reality that is presented to Oregon
by the media? Perhaps not.
When New York is shown to
the nation,on television or in the
movies, we see a version of the
city that is recognizable but not
quite accurate. We see Lindsay
walking the streets of Harlem, or
Rockefeller eating a knish. What
we don't see is either one of
them stepping on a cockroach.
A Simple Creature
It is quite possible that many
readers have never seen a
cockroach. (I have personally
never seen one in any part of
California). The cockroach is a
small brown insect, generally
about an inch long, but
occasionally growing much larger.
Although it is winged, the variety
in New York does not fly (Thank
you, God). Someplace in the
vicinity of its beady little head are
two antennae.
A simple creature: small head,
inch-long brown body, two
antennae, six legs.
During the day cockraoches
stay hidden in their nests, which
they seem to build near blumbing,
which translates into kitchen or
bathroom in most places. At
night, they come out to forage, or
run the mile, or whatever their
little cockroach mind tells them
they should do.
Cockroaches are absolutely

harmless to man. They do not
bite, they do not sting. They are
reputed to have a characteristic
odor, but I myself have never
been able to detect it. It is
inconceivable that they eat very
much, and as far as I know, their
droppings are inconsequential.
They are among the most ancient
creatures on the face of the earth.
Disgusting Creature
The cockroach's only apparent
vice is that it is, beyond all
reasonable doubt, one of the most
disgusting creatures in God's
creation. The cockroach is
quintessential repulsion. It is the
epitome of creepy, crawly things,
and instantly conjures up images
of something moving in your
food, something running across
your foot, up your leg, down your
back, something in the sugar
bowl, dirt in the meat, decay,
crawling out of the drainpipe,
crawling across the refrigerator,
antennae waving, hundreds of
little cockroach legs scrambling
across the fruit, across the
table cloth, across your shoe, up
your leg, down your back, it's
down your BACK!!
Yuchhh.
This is New York. The land of
the cockroach. There are places
with bigger cockroaches. I have
seen, with my own eyes, people in
Miami Beach stepping into the
street to allow a cockroach to
stroll by. You don't risk stepping
on anything that big.
Japanese Beetle
And in Hawaii, for two weeks I
shared a room in a small motel on
the windward slopes of Haleakala
with several dozen of the fiercest
cockroaches I have ever seen.
Those bugs were trained by the
Green Berets, or perhaps by the

Japanese before the war. They
didn't wait for night to come out
and explore.
They could be controlled, if
not stopped, by direct application
of Black Flag Ant and Roach
Killer. I will never forget one
gutsy little sapper cockroach,
making a kamikaze charge at me
out of the bathroom sink, a
satchel charge strapped to his
back. Nearly scared me to death.
Got him with the Black Flag.
Wished I had a flamethrower.
The New York cockroaches
aren't nearly as adventurous.
During the day, I have the run of
the entire apartment. But at night,
I retire to my strategic hamlet, as
the cockroaches overrun the
countryside. On occasion, I will
launch a search-and-destroy
mission, calling in aerosol strikes
on suspected enemy positions,
interdicting supply routes, routing
them from their nests. The next
morning I go out with whisk
broom and dust pan to sweep up
the corpses, upping the body
count by including aphids, grains
of rice, and roach-sized pieces of
dust.
But I am afraid all that
insecticide is eventually going to
do me as much harm as the
roaches. This is chemical warfare,
and I am in the process of
defoliating my kitchen.
So far, there has been only one
confirmed sighting of a cockroach
outside of the known area of
enemy concentration, and that
was a futile attempt by one
desperado to overrun the Firebase
Bathroom, an attack that was
fearlessly repulsed by turning on
the water in the sink and washing
the intruder into the Hudson
River.

Cockroach infestation is not
confined to old houses. I live in a
bright, new, clean, modern
apartment building. The rich,
famous and powerful are also
subject to cohabitation with
cockroaches, and there are so
many rich, famous and powerful
people in New York that one
must wonder to what extent
cockroaches have affected the fate
of the nation and the world.
How many nervous executives
have made a hasty decision when
confronted by a cockroach
running across the washroom
sink? Has the New York Times, or
CBS, or Doubleday, done
something it later regretted,
because an irritable editor tried to
step on a roach, missed, and then
imagined it running up his pants
leg?
How many United Nations
decisions have been affected by
roach infestation? U.N. embassies
are as susceptible to our crawling
friends as any other building in
the city. One immediately thinks
of Khrushchev in the General
Assembly. Had the premier been
inspired by a scene he had
recently witnessed in the embassy
kitchen? Or, had he seen
something crawl across his desk,
and responded with typical
peasant bluntness? Bang, bang,
bang, missed the little bastard,
bang, bang, bang, bingo:
International Crisis.
You'll never get the truth on
television. Who would believe that
Israel refused to withdraw its
troops from Arab lands across the
Amazon because Abba Eban was
flustered by a cockroach? Better
to live with the other reality.
Some realities the world isn't
readv for.

New York, February 7 — It is a
mistake to believe that New
Yorkers are out of touch with
nature. This is nonsense. Nature
intrudes itself constantly into
every life in this city.
Not the neat, antiseptic, Sierra
Club "Central Park Country"
Nature; nature in the raw, in its
messiest, barnyard form. Snow
which quickly turns to slush; dog
manure on the sidewalks; tree sap
and pigeon droppings on your car;
and the cockroach.
The cockroach is a part of New
York, like the Hudson River or St.
Patrick's Cathedral. It is a reality
of the city, but one that never
penetrates the consciousness of
the nation.
New York is infested with
cockroaches; there is scarcely a
building in the city free of them.
The slums have rats, the old
mansions have termites; everyone
has cockroaches. Cockroaches are
as much a part of the fabric of life
as is the rising of the sun, the
setting of the soot.
Best Known City
This is probably the best
publicized city in the world. It is
the center of the nation's
publishing and communications
industries. When Walter Cronkite
and John Chancellor and Howard
K. Smith tell you what happened
in Kentucky, they are telling you
from New York.
Everyone knows the name of
the mayor of New York; who
knows the name of the mayor of
Tokyo, or London, or for that

matter, Detroit or Houston or San
Diego? You know about New
York because the people who are
responsible for telling you about
the world live here, so the local
scene gets better coverage than
any other place.
But the reality that is
transmitted to the outside about
life in New York is a different
reality than that experienced by
New Yorkers. Lindsay is a hero in
Arizona, but to most New
Yorkers he's a bum. Would
Lindsay be as popular in Klamath
Falls if the reality of New York,
as seen by its citizens, were the
reality that is presented to Oregon
by the media? Perhaps not.
When New York is shown to
the nation,on television or in the
movies, we see a version of the
city that is recognizable but not
quite accurate. We see Lindsay
walking the streets of Harlem, or
Rockefeller eating a knish. What
we don't see is either one of
them stepping on a cockroach.
A Simple Creature
It is quite possible that many
readers have never seen a
cockroach. (I have personally
never seen one in any part of
California). The cockroach is a
small brown insect, generally
about an inch long, but
occasionally growing much larger.
Although it is winged, the variety
in New York does not fly (Thank
you, God). Someplace in the
vicinity of its beady little head are
two antennae.
A simple creature: small head,
inch-long brown body, two
antennae, six legs.
During the day cockraoches
stay hidden in their nests, which
they seem to build near blumbing,
which translates into kitchen or
bathroom in most places. At
night, they come out to forage, or
run the mile, or whatever their
little cockroach mind tells them
they should do.
Cockroaches are absolutely

harmless to man. They do not
bite, they do not sting. They are
reputed to have a characteristic
odor, but I myself have never
been able to detect it. It is
inconceivable that they eat very
much, and as far as I know, their
droppings are inconsequential.
They are among the most ancient
creatures on the face of the earth.
Disgusting Creature
The cockroach's only apparent
vice is that it is, beyond all
reasonable doubt, one of the most
disgusting creatures in God's
creation. The cockroach is
quintessential repulsion. It is the
epitome of creepy, crawly things,
and instantly conjures up images
of something moving in your
food, something running across
your foot, up your leg, down your
back, something in the sugar
bowl, dirt in the meat, decay,
crawling out of the drainpipe,
crawling across the refrigerator,
antennae waving, hundreds of
little cockroach legs scrambling
across the fruit, across the
table cloth, across your shoe, up
your leg, down your back, it's
down your BACK!!
Yuchhh.
This is New York. The land of
the cockroach. There are places
with bigger cockroaches. I have
seen, with my own eyes, people in
Miami Beach stepping into the
street to allow a cockroach to
stroll by. You don't risk stepping
on anything that big.
Japanese Beetle
And in Hawaii, for two weeks I
shared a room in a small motel on
the windward slopes of Haleakala
with several dozen of the fiercest
cockroaches I have ever seen.
Those bugs were trained by the
Green Berets, or perhaps by the

Japanese before the war. They
didn't wait for night to come out
and explore.
They could be controlled, if
not stopped, by direct application
of Black Flag Ant and Roach
Killer. I will never forget one
gutsy little sapper cockroach,
making a kamikaze charge at me
out of the bathroom sink, a
satchel charge strapped to his
back. Nearly scared me to death.
Got him with the Black Flag.
Wished I had a flamethrower.
The New York cockroaches
aren't nearly as adventurous.
During the day, I have the run of
the entire apartment. But at night,
I retire to my strategic hamlet, as
the cockroaches overrun the
countryside. On occasion, I will
launch a search-and-destroy
mission, calling in aerosol strikes
on suspected enemy positions,
interdicting supply routes, routing
them from their nests. The next
morning I go out with whisk
broom and dust pan to sweep up
the corpses, upping the body
count by including aphids, grains
of rice, and roach-sized pieces of
dust.
But I am afraid all that
insecticide is eventually going to
do me as much harm as the
roaches. This is chemical warfare,
and I am in the process of
defoliating my kitchen.
So far, there has been only one
confirmed sighting of a cockroach
outside of the known area of
enemy concentration, and that
was a futile attempt by one
desperado to overrun the Firebase
Bathroom, an attack that was
fearlessly repulsed by turning on
the water in the sink and washing
the intruder into the Hudson
River.

Cockroach infestation is not
confined to old houses. I live in a
bright, new, clean, modern
apartment building. The rich,
famous and powerful are also
subject to cohabitation with
cockroaches, and there are so
many rich, famous and powerful
people in New York that one
must wonder to what extent
cockroaches have affected the fate
of the nation and the world.
How many nervous executives
have made a hasty decision when
confronted by a cockroach
running across the washroom
sink? Has the New York Times, or
CBS, or Doubleday, done
something it later regretted,
because an irritable editor tried to
step on a roach, missed, and then
imagined it running up his pants
leg?
How many United Nations
decisions have been affected by
roach infestation? U.N. embassies
are as susceptible to our crawling
friends as any other building in
the city. One immediately thinks
of Khrushchev in the General
Assembly. Had the premier been
inspired by a scene he had
recently witnessed in the embassy
kitchen? Or, had he seen
something crawl across his desk,
and responded with typical
peasant bluntness? Bang, bang,
bang, missed the little bastard,
bang, bang, bang, bingo:
International Crisis.
You'll never get the truth on
television. Who would believe that
Israel refused to withdraw its
troops from Arab lands across the
Amazon because Abba Eban was
flustered by a cockroach? Better
to live with the other reality.
Some realities the world isn't
readv for.

mistake to believe that New
Yorkers are out of touch with
nature. This is nonsense. Nature
intrudes itself constantly into
every life in this city.
Not the neat, antiseptic, Sierra
Club "Central Park Country"
Nature; nature in the raw, in its
messiest, barnyard form. Snow
which quickly turns to slush; dog
manure on the sidewalks; tree sap
and pigeon droppings on your car;
and the cockroach.
The cockroach is a part of New
York, like the Hudson River or St.
Patrick's Cathedral. It is a reality
of the city, but one that never
penetrates the consciousness of
the nation.
New York is infested with
cockroaches; there is scarcely a
building in the city free of them.
The slums have rats, the old
mansions have termites; everyone
has cockroaches. Cockroaches are
as much a part of the fabric of life
as is the rising of the sun, the
setting of the soot.
Best Known City
This is probably the best
publicized city in the world. It is
the center of the nation's
publishing and communications
industries. When Walter Cronkite
and John Chancellor and Howard
K. Smith tell you what happened
in Kentucky, they are telling you
from New York.
Everyone knows the name of
the mayor of New York; who
knows the name of the mayor of
Tokyo, or London, or for that

matter, Detroit or Houston or San
Diego? You know about New
York because the people who are
responsible for telling you about
the world live here, so the local
scene gets better coverage than
any other place.
But the reality that is
transmitted to the outside about
life in New York is a different
reality than that experienced by
New Yorkers. Lindsay is a hero in
Arizona, but to most New
Yorkers he's a bum. Would
Lindsay be as popular in Klamath
Falls if the reality of New York,
as seen by its citizens, were the
reality that is presented to Oregon
by the media? Perhaps not.
When New York is shown to
the nation,on television or in the
movies, we see a version of the
city that is recognizable but not
quite accurate. We see Lindsay
walking the streets of Harlem, or
Rockefeller eating a knish. What
we don't see is either one of
them stepping on a cockroach.
A Simple Creature
It is quite possible that many
readers have never seen a
cockroach. (I have personally
never seen one in any part of
California). The cockroach is a
small brown insect, generally
about an inch long, but
occasionally growing much larger.
Although it is winged, the variety
in New York does not fly (Thank
you, God). Someplace in the
vicinity of its beady little head are
two antennae.
A simple creature: small head,
inch-long brown body, two
antennae, six legs.
During the day cockraoches
stay hidden in their nests, which
they seem to build near blumbing,
which translates into kitchen or
bathroom in most places. At
night, they come out to forage, or
run the mile, or whatever their
little cockroach mind tells them
they should do.
Cockroaches are absolutely

harmless to man. They do not
bite, they do not sting. They are
reputed to have a characteristic
odor, but I myself have never
been able to detect it. It is
inconceivable that they eat very
much, and as far as I know, their
droppings are inconsequential.
They are among the most ancient
creatures on the face of the earth.
Disgusting Creature
The cockroach's only apparent
vice is that it is, beyond all
reasonable doubt, one of the most
disgusting creatures in God's
creation. The cockroach is
quintessential repulsion. It is the
epitome of creepy, crawly things,
and instantly conjures up images
of something moving in your
food, something running across
your foot, up your leg, down your
back, something in the sugar
bowl, dirt in the meat, decay,
crawling out of the drainpipe,
crawling across the refrigerator,
antennae waving, hundreds of
little cockroach legs scrambling
across the fruit, across the
table cloth, across your shoe, up
your leg, down your back, it's
down your BACK!!
Yuchhh.
This is New York. The land of
the cockroach. There are places
with bigger cockroaches. I have
seen, with my own eyes, people in
Miami Beach stepping into the
street to allow a cockroach to
stroll by. You don't risk stepping
on anything that big.
Japanese Beetle
And in Hawaii, for two weeks I
shared a room in a small motel on
the windward slopes of Haleakala
with several dozen of the fiercest
cockroaches I have ever seen.
Those bugs were trained by the
Green Berets, or perhaps by the

Japanese before the war. They
didn't wait for night to come out
and explore.
They could be controlled, if
not stopped, by direct application
of Black Flag Ant and Roach
Killer. I will never forget one
gutsy little sapper cockroach,
making a kamikaze charge at me
out of the bathroom sink, a
satchel charge strapped to his
back. Nearly scared me to death.
Got him with the Black Flag.
Wished I had a flamethrower.
The New York cockroaches
aren't nearly as adventurous.
During the day, I have the run of
the entire apartment. But at night,
I retire to my strategic hamlet, as
the cockroaches overrun the
countryside. On occasion, I will
launch a search-and-destroy
mission, calling in aerosol strikes
on suspected enemy positions,
interdicting supply routes, routing
them from their nests. The next
morning I go out with whisk
broom and dust pan to sweep up
the corpses, upping the body
count by including aphids, grains
of rice, and roach-sized pieces of
dust.
But I am afraid all that
insecticide is eventually going to
do me as much harm as the
roaches. This is chemical warfare,
and I am in the process of
defoliating my kitchen.
So far, there has been only one
confirmed sighting of a cockroach
outside of the known area of
enemy concentration, and that
was a futile attempt by one
desperado to overrun the Firebase
Bathroom, an attack that was
fearlessly repulsed by turning on
the water in the sink and washing
the intruder into the Hudson
River.

Cockroach infestation is not
confined to old houses. I live in a
bright, new, clean, modern
apartment building. The rich,
famous and powerful are also
subject to cohabitation with
cockroaches, and there are so
many rich, famous and powerful
people in New York that one
must wonder to what extent
cockroaches have affected the fate
of the nation and the world.
How many nervous executives
have made a hasty decision when
confronted by a cockroach
running across the washroom
sink? Has the New York Times, or
CBS, or Doubleday, done
something it later regretted,
because an irritable editor tried to
step on a roach, missed, and then
imagined it running up his pants
leg?
How many United Nations
decisions have been affected by
roach infestation? U.N. embassies
are as susceptible to our crawling
friends as any other building in
the city. One immediately thinks
of Khrushchev in the General
Assembly. Had the premier been
inspired by a scene he had
recently witnessed in the embassy
kitchen? Or, had he seen
something crawl across his desk,
and responded with typical
peasant bluntness? Bang, bang,
bang, missed the little bastard,
bang, bang, bang, bingo:
International Crisis.
You'll never get the truth on
television. Who would believe that
Israel refused to withdraw its
troops from Arab lands across the
Amazon because Abba Eban was
flustered by a cockroach? Better
to live with the other reality.
Some realities the world isn't
readv for.

Yorkers are out of touch with
nature. This is nonsense. Nature
intrudes itself constantly into
every life in this city.
Not the neat, antiseptic, Sierra
Club "Central Park Country"
Nature; nature in the raw, in its
messiest, barnyard form. Snow
which quickly turns to slush; dog
manure on the sidewalks; tree sap
and pigeon droppings on your car;
and the cockroach.
The cockroach is a part of New
York, like the Hudson River or St.
Patrick's Cathedral. It is a reality
of the city, but one that never
penetrates the consciousness of
the nation.
New York is infested with
cockroaches; there is scarcely a
building in the city free of them.
The slums have rats, the old
mansions have termites; everyone
has cockroaches. Cockroaches are
as much a part of the fabric of life
as is the rising of the sun, the
setting of the soot.
Best Known City
This is probably the best
publicized city in the world. It is
the center of the nation's
publishing and communications
industries. When Walter Cronkite
and John Chancellor and Howard
K. Smith tell you what happened
in Kentucky, they are telling you
from New York.
Everyone knows the name of
the mayor of New York; who
knows the name of the mayor of
Tokyo, or London, or for that

matter, Detroit or Houston or San
Diego? You know about New
York because the people who are
responsible for telling you about
the world live here, so the local
scene gets better coverage than
any other place.
But the reality that is
transmitted to the outside about
life in New York is a different
reality than that experienced by
New Yorkers. Lindsay is a hero in
Arizona, but to most New
Yorkers he's a bum. Would
Lindsay be as popular in Klamath
Falls if the reality of New York,
as seen by its citizens, were the
reality that is presented to Oregon
by the media? Perhaps not.
When New York is shown to
the nation,on television or in the
movies, we see a version of the
city that is recognizable but not
quite accurate. We see Lindsay
walking the streets of Harlem, or
Rockefeller eating a knish. What
we don't see is either one of
them stepping on a cockroach.
A Simple Creature
It is quite possible that many
readers have never seen a
cockroach. (I have personally
never seen one in any part of
California). The cockroach is a
small brown insect, generally
about an inch long, but
occasionally growing much larger.
Although it is winged, the variety
in New York does not fly (Thank
you, God). Someplace in the
vicinity of its beady little head are
two antennae.
A simple creature: small head,
inch-long brown body, two
antennae, six legs.
During the day cockraoches
stay hidden in their nests, which
they seem to build near blumbing,
which translates into kitchen or
bathroom in most places. At
night, they come out to forage, or
run the mile, or whatever their
little cockroach mind tells them
they should do.
Cockroaches are absolutely

harmless to man. They do not
bite, they do not sting. They are
reputed to have a characteristic
odor, but I myself have never
been able to detect it. It is
inconceivable that they eat very
much, and as far as I know, their
droppings are inconsequential.
They are among the most ancient
creatures on the face of the earth.
Disgusting Creature
The cockroach's only apparent
vice is that it is, beyond all
reasonable doubt, one of the most
disgusting creatures in God's
creation. The cockroach is
quintessential repulsion. It is the
epitome of creepy, crawly things,
and instantly conjures up images
of something moving in your
food, something running across
your foot, up your leg, down your
back, something in the sugar
bowl, dirt in the meat, decay,
crawling out of the drainpipe,
crawling across the refrigerator,
antennae waving, hundreds of
little cockroach legs scrambling
across the fruit, across the
table cloth, across your shoe, up
your leg, down your back, it's
down your BACK!!
Yuchhh.
This is New York. The land of
the cockroach. There are places
with bigger cockroaches. I have
seen, with my own eyes, people in
Miami Beach stepping into the
street to allow a cockroach to
stroll by. You don't risk stepping
on anything that big.
Japanese Beetle
And in Hawaii, for two weeks I
shared a room in a small motel on
the windward slopes of Haleakala
with several dozen of the fiercest
cockroaches I have ever seen.
Those bugs were trained by the
Green Berets, or perhaps by the

Japanese before the war. They
didn't wait for night to come out
and explore.
They could be controlled, if
not stopped, by direct application
of Black Flag Ant and Roach
Killer. I will never forget one
gutsy little sapper cockroach,
making a kamikaze charge at me
out of the bathroom sink, a
satchel charge strapped to his
back. Nearly scared me to death.
Got him with the Black Flag.
Wished I had a flamethrower.
The New York cockroaches
aren't nearly as adventurous.
During the day, I have the run of
the entire apartment. But at night,
I retire to my strategic hamlet, as
the cockroaches overrun the
countryside. On occasion, I will
launch a search-and-destroy
mission, calling in aerosol strikes
on suspected enemy positions,
interdicting supply routes, routing
them from their nests. The next
morning I go out with whisk
broom and dust pan to sweep up
the corpses, upping the body
count by including aphids, grains
of rice, and roach-sized pieces of
dust.
But I am afraid all that
insecticide is eventually going to
do me as much harm as the
roaches. This is chemical warfare,
and I am in the process of
defoliating my kitchen.
So far, there has been only one
confirmed sighting of a cockroach
outside of the known area of
enemy concentration, and that
was a futile attempt by one
desperado to overrun the Firebase
Bathroom, an attack that was
fearlessly repulsed by turning on
the water in the sink and washing
the intruder into the Hudson
River.

Cockroach infestation is not
confined to old houses. I live in a
bright, new, clean, modern
apartment building. The rich,
famous and powerful are also
subject to cohabitation with
cockroaches, and there are so
many rich, famous and powerful
people in New York that one
must wonder to what extent
cockroaches have affected the fate
of the nation and the world.
How many nervous executives
have made a hasty decision when
confronted by a cockroach
running across the washroom
sink? Has the New York Times, or
CBS, or Doubleday, done
something it later regretted,
because an irritable editor tried to
step on a roach, missed, and then
imagined it running up his pants
leg?
How many United Nations
decisions have been affected by
roach infestation? U.N. embassies
are as susceptible to our crawling
friends as any other building in
the city. One immediately thinks
of Khrushchev in the General
Assembly. Had the premier been
inspired by a scene he had
recently witnessed in the embassy
kitchen? Or, had he seen
something crawl across his desk,
and responded with typical
peasant bluntness? Bang, bang,
bang, missed the little bastard,
bang, bang, bang, bingo:
International Crisis.
You'll never get the truth on
television. Who would believe that
Israel refused to withdraw its
troops from Arab lands across the
Amazon because Abba Eban was
flustered by a cockroach? Better
to live with the other reality.
Some realities the world isn't
readv for.
