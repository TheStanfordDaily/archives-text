# Irwin Decries Crime And Punishment
## 
### 
Punishment should fit the
crime—not the individual, Prof.
John Irwin of San Francisco State
College said during a visit here
Tuesday.
Author of The Felon and
contributor to a new American
Friends Service Committee report,
"Struggle for Justice," Irwin
served five years at Soledad for
armed robbery before earning his
Ph.D. and becoming a sociology
professor.
"We must punish for the act,
not the person," he said. "It
should be as serious for Bobby
Kennedy's son to possess
marijuana as it is for a black
ghetto dweller's son."
He criticized police chiefs who
feel present justice is "too
lenient," radicals who regard all
prisoners as "political," and
liberals who place their faith in
rehabilitation
American already has the
highest proportion of prisoners
per capita in the world and the

average length of sentence served
has risen from 24 to 29 months,
he noted.
Radicals who think there's no
need for prisons are "naive," are
inclined to overlook the so-called
"orientation systems" in
totalitarian regimes, he added.
While the number of acts
considered crimes should be
reduced, he noted, society "must
deal with the need to eliminate
private vengeance or other
substitute forms of returning hurt
for hurt" in such cases as murder.
Many of the shortcomings of
our present prison system stem
from the premise that "good"
people have the right to work on
the minds of the "sick," he added.
Since California adopted this
"rehabilitative" model, including
indeterminate sentencing, the
median time served has risen from
24 to 36 months—the longest in
the country. "This uncertainty
[of sentence ] is one of the most

exquisite forms of torture," the
AFSC report notes.
''After decades of
experimentation [with
rehabilitative programs], that
treatment has failed miserably.
Not only has treatment not
produced any desirable changes, it
has increased the numbers and
suffering of those receiving the
treatment."

The discretionary power
embodied in individualized
treatment "has been to select out
not the most dangerous
criminals. . . but those persons
with less power and influence,
persons who are perceived as the
greatest nuisances, or those who
most offend against middle-class
morality or who refuse to knuckle
under to prison authorities."
