# Prison Info Center Opens
## 
### 
A new organization on campus,
a Prison Information Center, has
recently opened offices in the
Tresidder Loft.
While still in the planning
stage, it plans to bring a variety of
information to the Stanford
community on prison life.
According to Ed Drummond, a
member of the center,
door-to-door solicitations for used
books will take place in Stanford

dorms next week for the Soledad
Prison library. Drop-off points for
the old or unneeded books will
also be located around campus.
To expand into other activities
such as teaching in prisons or
encouraging the Stanford people
to take part in prison -related
activities, the center is looking for
some kind of funding from here
or the outside.
