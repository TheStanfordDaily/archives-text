# Human Sex Draws Crowd
## 
### JAN FELDMAN 
Over 1,000 students can be
observed crowding into Memorial
Auditorium every Monday,
Wednesday and Friday afternoon
this term. The scene is not a
re-enactment of registration. The
main attraction is not the ASSU
flicks, nor is it an appearance by
H. Bruce Franklin.
These students are on their
way to the largest class on
campus, Human Sexuality, taught
by Drs. Herant Katchadourian and
Donald Lunde.
The course, which deals with
the anatomical, behavioral and
cultural aspects of sex, is an
attempt to fill an information gap
for Stanford students. Before the
class was established, Lunde said,
"Many students felt they had no
source of sexual information
except their roommates."
The two professors of
psychiatry try to present their
students with an objective look at
a wide range of sexual behavior.
Their lectures include such diverse
subjects as autoeroticism,
psychosexual development and
erotic literature.
Human Sexuality grew out of a
committee appointed in 1966 to
study health issues in the
University community.
Katchadourian said, "When the
issue of sex education came up I
suggested we teach a course, one
thing led to another, and I got the
job." He began teaching the

course on a trial basis the next
year. Lunde, since he joined the
faculty three years ago, has been
sharing the responsibility with his
colleague.
Enrollment Rises
The enrollment in Human
Sexuality has increased steadily
each year. Katchadourian finds
the size of the class an advantage
in that they can reach so many
students at one time. He pointed
out that "if we were to teach
classes of 25 students each, it
would take 40 years to get to the
same number of students that we
do in one year."
In an effort not to put
everyone asleep in what Lunde
calls "that huge, dark depressing
auditorium," both men try to be
entertaining lecturers. On the first
day of class this term,
Katchadourian flashed a slide of a
skeleton on the wide screen at the
front of Mem Aud and said, "This
is an unfortunate freshman who
masturbated himself to death."
Such unexpected quips are likely
to be heard at any lecture.
Katchadourian feels that
humor is "important to a topic
like sex, where there is some
discomfort.
"Approaching the subject in a
light vein," he said, "puts it in
perspective so that it doesn't
become a kind of grim issue."
However, the purpose of
Human Sexuality is not to
entertain. Katchadourian said he
is impressed with the integrity and
seriousness of his students, which
have prevented the class from
"degenerating into burlesque."
He and Lunde attribute the
popularity of their course not to
its entertaining aspects, but to the
fact that students really want to
learn about sex. Many students
agree.
One co-ed said, "There are a
lot of things I didn't know about
sex and wanted to find out."
Another claimed, "This is the
most practical course I've taken at
Stanford."
Some students register for
Human Sexuality as a lark and are
surprised to find that it is a source
of valuable information. Hal
Daseking, a senior in engineering,
took the class "as a refreshing
change from most of my courses,"
and has found himself "learning a
lot of interesting things."
There has been some
speculation among the students
about the difficulty of Human
Sexuality. Katchadourian said,

"This is neither the easiest nor thy
most difficult course at this
level." (Human Sexuality is a
lower level Human Biology
course.)
Katchadourian's experience as
a former Stanford ombudsman
has made him particularly
receptive to feedback. He said he
and Lunde have had only
encouragement and support from
the administration, faculty and
local community. Written
evaluations of the course by the
students show mostly
enthusiastic, positive responses.
Complaints
However, there are occasional
complaints from students.
Katchadourian recently
received a letter protesting the
lecturers' "sexual bias" and
"tendency to ignore, malign and
mock female sexuality."
Last year a group of students
questioned Lunde's credentials for
lecturing on homosexuality. They
said only a homosexual could
know what it is like to be gay.
Lunde replied that he had never
had syphillis or given birth to a
child, but was considered
qualified to speak on those topics.

Two years ago, Lunde said, a
slide of a Tampax elicited nervous
laughter from the class. Lunde
subsequently received a letter
from students who felt the matter
too private to be discussed in
class. They argued that the
women already knew about the
subject, and that it was none of
the men's business.
Human Sexuality has changed
somewhat during the years it has
been offered at Stanford, and the
two professors predict it will
continue to change.
Originally the lectures
consisted of material which is now
in the textbook, Fundamentals of
Human Sexuality, written by
Katchadourian and Lunde.
Xeroxed copies of the book are
now on reserve in UGLY. After it
is published in March, the
professors will not have to go into
so much detail during class time.
They hope to be able to share
with the class some of the
available artistic films on
childbirth and intercourse, and to
keep the students informed of
current developments in the
rapidly moving science of human
sexual behavior.

about the difficulty of Human
Sexuality. Katchadourian said,

"This is neither the easiest nor thy
most difficult course at this
level." (Human Sexuality is a
lower level Human Biology
course.)
Katchadourian's experience as
a former Stanford ombudsman
has made him particularly
receptive to feedback. He said he
and Lunde have had only
encouragement and support from
the administration, faculty and
local community. Written
evaluations of the course by the
students show mostly
enthusiastic, positive responses.
Complaints
However, there are occasional
complaints from students.
Katchadourian recently
received a letter protesting the
lecturers' "sexual bias" and
"tendency to ignore, malign and
mock female sexuality."
Last year a group of students
questioned Lunde's credentials for
lecturing on homosexuality. They
said only a homosexual could
know what it is like to be gay.
Lunde replied that he had never
had syphillis or given birth to a
child, but was considered
qualified to speak on those topics.

Two years ago, Lunde said, a
slide of a Tampax elicited nervous
laughter from the class. Lunde
subsequently received a letter
from students who felt the matter
too private to be discussed in
class. They argued that the
women already knew about the
subject, and that it was none of
the men's business.
Human Sexuality has changed
somewhat during the years it has
been offered at Stanford, and the
two professors predict it will
continue to change.
Originally the lectures
consisted of material which is now
in the textbook, Fundamentals of
Human Sexuality, written by
Katchadourian and Lunde.
Xeroxed copies of the book are
now on reserve in UGLY. After it
is published in March, the
professors will not have to go into
so much detail during class time.
They hope to be able to share
with the class some of the
available artistic films on
childbirth and intercourse, and to
keep the students informed of
current developments in the
rapidly moving science of human
sexual behavior.

SHADOW SYMBOLISM?—Students leave Mem Aud following a
Human Sexuality class are treated to a frontal assault by Hoover's last
symbol.
Over 1,000 students can be
observed crowding into Memorial
Auditorium every Monday,
Wednesday and Friday afternoon
this term. The scene is not a
re-enactment of registration. The
main attraction is not the ASSU
flicks, nor is it an appearance by
H. Bruce Franklin.
These students are on their
way to the largest class on
campus, Human Sexuality, taught
by Drs. Herant Katchadourian and
Donald Lunde.
The course, which deals with
the anatomical, behavioral and
cultural aspects of sex, is an
attempt to fill an information gap
for Stanford students. Before the
class was established, Lunde said,
"Many students felt they had no
source of sexual information
except their roommates."
The two professors of
psychiatry try to present their
students with an objective look at
a wide range of sexual behavior.
Their lectures include such diverse
subjects as autoeroticism,
psychosexual development and
erotic literature.
Human Sexuality grew out of a
committee appointed in 1966 to
study health issues in the
University community.
Katchadourian said, "When the
issue of sex education came up I
suggested we teach a course, one
thing led to another, and I got the
job." He began teaching the

course on a trial basis the next
year. Lunde, since he joined the
faculty three years ago, has been
sharing the responsibility with his
colleague.
Enrollment Rises
The enrollment in Human
Sexuality has increased steadily
each year. Katchadourian finds
the size of the class an advantage
in that they can reach so many
students at one time. He pointed
out that "if we were to teach
classes of 25 students each, it
would take 40 years to get to the
same number of students that we
do in one year."
In an effort not to put
everyone asleep in what Lunde
calls "that huge, dark depressing
auditorium," both men try to be
entertaining lecturers. On the first
day of class this term,
Katchadourian flashed a slide of a
skeleton on the wide screen at the
front of Mem Aud and said, "This
is an unfortunate freshman who
masturbated himself to death."
Such unexpected quips are likely
to be heard at any lecture.
Katchadourian feels that
humor is "important to a topic
like sex, where there is some
discomfort.
"Approaching the subject in a
light vein," he said, "puts it in
perspective so that it doesn't
become a kind of grim issue."
However, the purpose of
Human Sexuality is not to
entertain. Katchadourian said he
is impressed with the integrity and
seriousness of his students, which
have prevented the class from
"degenerating into burlesque."
He and Lunde attribute the
popularity of their course not to
its entertaining aspects, but to the
fact that students really want to
learn about sex. Many students
agree.
One co-ed said, "There are a
lot of things I didn't know about
sex and wanted to find out."
Another claimed, "This is the
most practical course I've taken at
Stanford."
Some students register for
Human Sexuality as a lark and are
surprised to find that it is a source
of valuable information. Hal
Daseking, a senior in engineering,
took the class "as a refreshing
change from most of my courses,"
and has found himself "learning a
lot of interesting things."

course on a trial basis the next
year. Lunde, since he joined the
faculty three years ago, has been
sharing the responsibility with his
colleague.
Enrollment Rises
The enrollment in Human
Sexuality has increased steadily
each year. Katchadourian finds
the size of the class an advantage
in that they can reach so many
students at one time. He pointed
out that "if we were to teach
classes of 25 students each, it
would take 40 years to get to the
same number of students that we
do in one year."
In an effort not to put
everyone asleep in what Lunde
calls "that huge, dark depressing
auditorium," both men try to be
entertaining lecturers. On the first
day of class this term,
Katchadourian flashed a slide of a
skeleton on the wide screen at the
front of Mem Aud and said, "This
is an unfortunate freshman who
masturbated himself to death."
Such unexpected quips are likely
to be heard at any lecture.
Katchadourian feels that
humor is "important to a topic
like sex, where there is some
discomfort.
"Approaching the subject in a
light vein," he said, "puts it in
perspective so that it doesn't
become a kind of grim issue."
However, the purpose of
Human Sexuality is not to
entertain. Katchadourian said he
is impressed with the integrity and
seriousness of his students, which
have prevented the class from
"degenerating into burlesque."
He and Lunde attribute the
popularity of their course not to
its entertaining aspects, but to the
fact that students really want to
learn about sex. Many students
agree.
One co-ed said, "There are a
lot of things I didn't know about
sex and wanted to find out."
Another claimed, "This is the
most practical course I've taken at
Stanford."
Some students register for
Human Sexuality as a lark and are
surprised to find that it is a source
of valuable information. Hal
Daseking, a senior in engineering,
took the class "as a refreshing
change from most of my courses,"
and has found himself "learning a
lot of interesting things."
There has been some
speculation among the students
about the difficulty of Human
Sexuality. Katchadourian said,

"This is neither the easiest nor thy
most difficult course at this
level." (Human Sexuality is a
lower level Human Biology
course.)
Katchadourian's experience as
a former Stanford ombudsman
has made him particularly
receptive to feedback. He said he
and Lunde have had only
encouragement and support from
the administration, faculty and
local community. Written
evaluations of the course by the
students show mostly
enthusiastic, positive responses.
Complaints
However, there are occasional
complaints from students.
Katchadourian recently
received a letter protesting the
lecturers' "sexual bias" and
"tendency to ignore, malign and
mock female sexuality."
Last year a group of students
questioned Lunde's credentials for
lecturing on homosexuality. They
said only a homosexual could
know what it is like to be gay.
Lunde replied that he had never
had syphillis or given birth to a
child, but was considered
qualified to speak on those topics.

Two years ago, Lunde said, a
slide of a Tampax elicited nervous
laughter from the class. Lunde
subsequently received a letter
from students who felt the matter
too private to be discussed in
class. They argued that the
women already knew about the
subject, and that it was none of
the men's business.
Human Sexuality has changed
somewhat during the years it has
been offered at Stanford, and the
two professors predict it will
continue to change.
Originally the lectures
consisted of material which is now
in the textbook, Fundamentals of
Human Sexuality, written by
Katchadourian and Lunde.
Xeroxed copies of the book are
now on reserve in UGLY. After it
is published in March, the
professors will not have to go into
so much detail during class time.
They hope to be able to share
with the class some of the
available artistic films on
childbirth and intercourse, and to
keep the students informed of
current developments in the
rapidly moving science of human
sexual behavior.

SHADOW SYMBOLISM?—Students leave Mem Aud following a
Human Sexuality class are treated to a frontal assault by Hoover's last
symbol.
Over 1,000 students can be
observed crowding into Memorial
Auditorium every Monday,
Wednesday and Friday afternoon
this term. The scene is not a
re-enactment of registration. The
main attraction is not the ASSU
flicks, nor is it an appearance by
H. Bruce Franklin.
These students are on their
way to the largest class on
campus, Human Sexuality, taught
by Drs. Herant Katchadourian and
Donald Lunde.
The course, which deals with
the anatomical, behavioral and
cultural aspects of sex, is an
attempt to fill an information gap
for Stanford students. Before the
class was established, Lunde said,
"Many students felt they had no
source of sexual information
except their roommates."
The two professors of
psychiatry try to present their
students with an objective look at
a wide range of sexual behavior.
Their lectures include such diverse
subjects as autoeroticism,
psychosexual development and
erotic literature.
Human Sexuality grew out of a
committee appointed in 1966 to
study health issues in the
University community.
Katchadourian said, "When the
issue of sex education came up I
suggested we teach a course, one
thing led to another, and I got the
job." He began teaching the

course on a trial basis the next
year. Lunde, since he joined the
faculty three years ago, has been
sharing the responsibility with his
colleague.
