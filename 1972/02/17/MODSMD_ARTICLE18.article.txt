# 'Hard Core' Viewers Vary
## 
### DANIEL BRENNER 
Television has never been a
great source of time-wasting for
the majority of Stanford students.
People in show business refer to
the occasional tuner-in as a "light
watcher," selective viewers who
chose specific programming and
usually watch only that.
But there does exist a hard
core of "heavy watchers,"
students who make television
watching a near-full time
preoccupation. They get up to
"Today"; they lunch with
Virginia Graham or the Electric
Company; they have an afternoon
beer with Mike Douglas, eat
dinner with Bugs Bunny or Rob
and Laura Petree or Jeannie; they
book to the Felony Squad; and
they doze off to the Saint,
Johnny or Dick, or to the booth
announcer of the channel 36
movie.
For these people, those hooked
on the cathode tube, television
becomes an electronic calendar to
mark the change of hours. It's not
6:00 p.m.; it's May berry R.F.I).
time; seminars begin after Dick
Van Dyke, dinner is served
following Please Don't Eat the
Daisies. You know it's late when
you turn on channel 4 for Carson
and they're giving you the next
day's news.
TV Etiquette
Against this background of
media goop, an intricate set of TV
etiquette has been informally
developed in the lounges of
Stanford dormitories. For
instance, there are three basic
styles by which one can
successfully change the station
upon entering the room.
First, one can non-chalantly
strut up to the set, take a
pre possessing stare at what's on,
and with a gallant flick of the
wrist spin the dial to another
channel. This technique is most
efficacious for persons who would

describe themselves as
seventh-grade bullies, although
various kick boxers report a high
rate of success with this method.
The second technique is the
appeal to right of eminent
domain. Here a person who
maintains the longevity record for
the TV room can with no
repercussions decide which station
will be viewed. For example in
Burbank Hall, a number of
persons seem to have moved from
their dorm room into the
leather-couched salon du
television on a semi-permanent
basis. Each of these glassy-eyed
undergrads has become a member
of an information ruling clique
over the click.
'Mad Dash'
Furthermore, a person can
make "the mad dash" for the
knob, supposing that he just
cannot bear to watch the fifth run
of "Rodan" some afternoon. The
hypnotic factor — the influence of
TV in making people not realize
that there is any difference in one
channel from another — can be to
this person's advantage. He might
try moving from two spectaculars
quickly; for example "Hercules
Unchained" can be substituted for
"Hercules Against the Barbarian"
quite easily (although film buffs
will obviously spot "Hercules
Unchained" as a shallow shadow

for the robust performances of
screen giants Mark Forest, Jose
Greci, and lovely Gloria Miland
who starred in "Hercules Against
the Barbarians.")
Beyond the rules for changing
channels, other, more subtle,
expressions of TV room behavior
have been motivated. For instance
there is a definite, although
unclear, limit on the amount of
commentary even the cleverist TV
critic can get away with —
without being ostrocized by the
meany stares by fellow watchers.
The query, "What else is on?"
must be proffered most
assiduously, for an inappropriate
challenge to the station status quo
can tip off others that, because
you're the only one who doesn't
like what's on, you possess the
unenviable qualities of a flaming
creep. On the other hand, the
challenge at the right time can
make you a cultural liberator and
a perceptive wizard who can spot
a loser after the first commercial.
Noise Pollution Performers
There is also the matter of how
much noise one can make without
calling attention to yourself.
Potato chips, mini-tacos, or
cheetos must be avoided unless
you plan to share them with the
masses. Canned drinks have been a
safe performer although the clank
of their containers might

occasionally cause an unpleasant
glance to come your way. Pizza is
safe, but then chewing gum,
especially the bubble-blowing
variety is improper. And, above all
else, don't start with gherkins: the
pungent scent of pickle is a sure
way to become an enemy of TV
room squatters.
One other element of etiquette
that has grown up in the dorms is
the seating arrangement. In
Florence Moore's Gavilan House
for instance some seats are much
better than others, those persons
expecting to watch TV in the
horizontal should either do so on
the floor or expect their tootsies
to experience an occasional shove.
In Roble, where the basement
television room has become an
on-going institution for
development of TV etiquette, the
seating of persons is carefully
orchestrated so that those with
longest standing continue to enjoy
preferential seating. A genuine
feeling of community has thus
flourished as the television, the
electronic cyclops, has in its own
alienating way, brought people
closer together.
