## 'Orfeo' A Masterpiece 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
I confess 1 approached Spring
Opera Theater's new production
of Claudio Monteverdi's "Orfeo"
with a kind of abandon-all-hope
-ye-who-enter-here sense of doom.
How could a 365-year-old opera —
indeed, for all practical purposes
the very first opera ever written —
be other than esoteric, stilted,
musically naive and generally
inaccessible? It seemed like the
occasion for a convocation of
musicological worms, not a flesh
and blood opera audience. The
mere thought made me yawn.
To my astonishment and
delight, however, the performance
was nothing short of a revelation
of "Orfeo's" beauty and
sophistication. The work is a
masterpiece, as it would appear
musicians have known for some
time: no less than 15 editions of
"Orfeo" have appeared since
1900, and the list of Monteverdi's
editors includes many notable
composers (d'lndy, Orff,
Hindemith, Respighi, Krenek,
Dallapiccola). Yet, though
"Orfeo" is obviously a musician's
(and singer's) delight, it took a
production strong in every
department to push the beauties
of the opera forcefully into the
public domain.
The secret of its success lies, I
think, in a reluctance to chase
after the will-o-the-wisp of
absolute authenticity. Though
"Orfeo" was performed without
cuts and without intermission
(daring but wise), other aspects
were judiciously modulated. No
attempt was made to achieve the
precise "sound" of a Monteverdi
orchestra (circa 1607), the
excessive vocal ornamentation was
temperately simplified, and the
lower vocal sonorities were
favored more than is usual for this
period (the age of juvenile and
castrato singing, after all). All of
these alterations I found very well
taken; what is important, is that
the character and idiom of
Monteverdi remained intact.
Perfect Clarity
The hope, when a
long-moribund artwork is being
revived, is that its integrity and
aesthetic self-sufficiency will
somehow be recaptured and that
it will by some kind of magic

stand on its own. Spring Opera
must have sensed "Orfeo's"
potential and therefore wisely
abandoned plans to intersperse
English in the performance. As it
was, the plot — which is simply
the thoroughly familiar Orpheus
myth — developed with perfect
clarity, and the dramatic tension
was maintained with only
momentary slips.
A major source of success lay
in Mr. Adler's sensitive casting. In
the most arduous role of Orfeo
was baritone William Justus,
whose intelligence, agility, and
stamina made the switch from the
usual tenor assignment a
well-advised one. Justus' voice
possesses striking emotive
capabilities, and he thinks not in
notes but in phrases — a sine qua
non for Monteverdi.
The voice most likely to
succeed in this cast, however, was
Joy Blackett's. Her pillowy, lush
mezzosoprano as the Messenger

and Hope was simply stunning. I
can only hope she will return in a
role that will plumb more fully
her considerable vocal resources.
Uniquely Lovely
Boy soprano Robert Calvert
and counter-tenor (or male alto)
John Ferrante helped give this
production a hint of the kind of
voices which originally sang
"Orfeo." As the Spirit of Music
Calvert sang with fine purity of
tone after a few nervous
moments. Ferrante's tonal quality
is uniquely lovely; it is a shame
that modern audiences find it so
hard to acquire the taste for this
special kind of vocal ism.
Others in the cast deserve
mention: Gwen Jones' Euridice
was ingratiating — surprisingly
brief though her part is; as the
underworld deities Pluto and
Proserpina, Philip Booth and
Carolyn Lewis gave satisfying
portrayals; and William Powers as

Charon the guardian of Hades,
while coming closer than anyone
in the cast to betraying a vibrato,
still achieved the desired
cavernous effects.
The Monteverdi vocal line is
grateful to singers and to a man
the cast responded to the
requirements of purity and clarity
of intonation. Supporting the cast
was the orchestra led by Byron
Dean Ryan. In the face of much
uncertainty as to performance
practices for this early music, I
bow to Ryan's realization of the
score. If one is to judge from the
pace and vitality of the
performance as a whole, Ryan's
leadership was praiseworthy
indeed.
The sets and costumes
provided excellent effects within
the resources of the Spring Opera,
giving a quite plausible sense of
the physical qualities of Italian
court entertainment as it was in
Mantua in 1607.
Two Complaints
Gerald Freedman's stage
direction achieved a level of
stylization which seemed to
compliment aptly the stylized
nature of Morteverdi's music. And
he happily made the orchestral
interludes seem visually necessary.
Two major complaints: Orfeo's
fateful journey out of Hades with
Euridice was ineffectually staged,
and the insurance-policy vignettes
of "modernism" which began and
ended the opera struck me as
intrusive and gratuitous (ditto
Orfeo's modern-dress costume).
And that awful modern guitar
which meandered through the
stage-action — quel horreur!
This "Orfeo" is an historic
production; for San Francisco it
pushes the frontiers of opera back
nearly two centuries. It also
retrieves from the land of the
dead (more successfully than
Orpheus does with Euridice) a
work of unquestionable genius
and importance. An estimable
success by any standards. It was,
incidentally, funded partially by
the Federal Government. Big
Brother may have some redeeming
cultural value after all.
(Orfeo will be repeated at the
Curran Theater in San Francisco
on Feb. 20 at 2:30 and on Feb.
25 at 8:30.)
