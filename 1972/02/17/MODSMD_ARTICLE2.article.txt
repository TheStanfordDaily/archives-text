# 350 Turn Out At Rally Asking Shockley Ouster
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
A rally calling for the ouster of
Nobel Prize-winning physicist and
engineering professor William
Shockley drew about 350 people to
White Plaza yesterday noon, including
the subject of the rally himself.
Shockley sat expressionless but
tight-lipped while a succession of
speakers branded him a
"mother-fucking racist" and an
"oppressor." Later, Shockley briefly
addressed the crowd, telling them that
"I do not find any respect for the
power of rational thinking" at the
rally.
The rally, sponsored by the Third
World Coalition Against Shockley,
heard from several minority group
speakers before marching to President
Lyman's office and posting a
resolution on his door calling for a
committee to investigate charges of
racism against Shockley and "any
member of the faculty or professional
staff' so charged.
Burn In Effigy
The group of about 80 marchers

then burned Shockley in effigy outside
Lyman's office before dispersing.
At the White Plaza rally, former
ASSU elections commissioner Alice
Furumoto called Shockley "a
mother-fucking racist" as he stood not
more than five feet away. BSU
member Chris Fleming expanded the
attack to include Faculty Club chef
Arturo Lionetti for his attempt to
block black Harvard Club member
Roy Boggs from a recent club function
and also the Stanford Indian mascot.
Chris Yee then handed Shockley a
sign to hold that read "One Shockley
Among Many." Shockley wrote on the
other side "Truth . . . Concern . . .
Death" and held it silently while Yee
spoke.
'Color-Code'
Bill Flores of MEChA and Juan
Flores of Venceremos and the Faculty
Political Action Group also spoke,
along with others. After a brief play
satirizing Shockley, the demonstrators
read their resolution, accusing
Shockley of "advocating the doctrine
that | in his own words) 'nature has
color-coded groups'" according to
potential intellectual capability.
The resolution also asked "that
Shockley, a nation-wide example of
racism in a university at its worst, be
dismissed from Stanford University."
Shockley then spoke to the
generally hostile group, telling them
that "I'm here simply because I'd have
less self-esteem if I wasn't."
He said that he felt his proposed
program of voluntary sterilization was

necessary because of "the poor
unfortunate illegitimate slum babies
who have no shake" and are
"disenfranchised and cut off from the
mainstream of American life."
He also asserted that he would be
"glad to debate" the implications of
his theories and plans with qualified
representatives in the fields of
genetics, psychology, and religion.
Recruiting
About 80 people then marched to
Lyman's office, where Kwonping Ho
announced: 1) that there would be a
rally at 8:30 a.m. this morning to
block recruiting of naval missile
engineers at the Placement Center; 2)
that four students arrested for
disrupting Shockley's class last month
would face CJP proceedings Monday;
and 3) that Ho's own CJP hearing in
connection with the so-called Faculty
Club eat-in would begin at 1:30 p.m.
in the Art Auditorium.
Shortly after the rally, one
Stanford police officer, two Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Officers, and
two Stanford police photographers
detained black leader Christopher
Laury for about 15 minutes behind
the bookstore.
One of the Santa Clara officers
checked on a supposedly outstanding
warrant charging Laury with a traffic
violation. The check proved negative,
and Laury was allowed to go.
"They saw me at the rally, and they
just singled me out," Laury said
afterwards. He said that the violation
had already been "cleared up in
court."
