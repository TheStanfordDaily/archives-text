# New San Jose Theater Opens Tonight With 'Aida'
## 
### 
The new San Jose Community
Theater will have its grand
opening tonight with a
performance of Verdi's "Aida."
"Aida" will feature
mezzo-soprano Grace Bumbry,
bass Ezio Flagello and soprano
Marisa Galvany. Tonight's
performance is at 8 p.m. and there
will be a second performance this
Saturday night at 8 p.m.
The new theater is located at
W. San Carlos St.and Almaden St.
in downtown San Jose. It is
located very close to the San Jose
Civic Auditorium and San Jose's
Main Library.
The theater was designed by
William Wesley Peters, Chief
Architect of the Taliesen
Associated Architects of the
Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation.
It is designed to house all forms of
the theatre: concert, opera,
musical and drama theatre, ballet,
dance and individual artists.
The house will seat 1945 to

2701 persons in two
configurations which is
accomplished by lowering or
raising the auditorium ceiling,
with corresponding acoustic
adjustments that are necessary
with the changed volumes of the
house. A fully rigged stage with an
automated orchestra shell,
adjustable procenium openings,
calipers stages and extended
forestages reportedly will give
"complete freedom to
productions of a widely varying
nature."
The stage lifts will work in a
number of configurations to
provide either an orchestra pit,
patron seating, a thrust stage, or a
combination of any two of the
above. Back stage areas are on
three different levels and the
individual and chorus dressing
rooms can accommodate
productions with a cast of 100.
The entire building is air
conditioned.

Following the opening with
"Aida" a number of other events
have been scheduled for the
theater in the near future. The
San Jose Music Theatre will
present its production of "South
Pacific" on February 24-26. The
San Francisco Ballet will
perform on February 29 and
March 1. Pianist Philippe
Entremont will perform with the
San Jose Symphony on March 3.
Allyn Ferguson will be featured
with his "Evening With The Stars"
on March 4 and Lillian Gish will
give a solo performance on March
7.
