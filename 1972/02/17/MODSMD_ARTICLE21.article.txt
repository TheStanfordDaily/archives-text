# 'Romeo And Juliet'
## A 						Night At The Ballet 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
Comparisons are often made
between the film "Love Story"
and Shakespeare's tragedy
"Romeo and Juliet," and I too,
see their similarities — they are
both, in their proper contexts,
trash.
Somebody should have love
stories of any kind declared illegal
on February 14. However, having
just spent the weekend laughing
all the way through the paper
airplanes and whistling performed
by the boys in the band during
the Mem Aud screening of "Love
Story," and being surprisingly
bored through Natalia Makarova's
dancing in the ABT Ballet's
opening night production of
"Romeo and Juliet," and having
to choose one of the two, I
wholeheartedly would
recommend that someone pay 75
cents to laugh at "Love Story" at
the Flicks than pay $10.00 to
sleep through "Romeo and
Juliet."
The American Ballet Theatre
opened its week long stay at the
Opera House, by reviving the
1943 ballet, bringing Romeo and
Juliet back from the dead, just to
have them die again on stage. It
was true tragedy.
It's not that the actual
production was below par
technically, quite the contrary,
everyone did the most they could
do with what they had, they just
didn't have anything. One is
disappointed at the sheer waste of
talent, especially that of
Makarova's, which went on for
almost an hour.
She dances, and danced
Monday night, brilliantly, with
the technical perfection that gives
her the appearance of clouds in
the air. I was really as angry as I
was disappointed that I payed
$10.00 to see Makarova dance
through something that did not
show a bit of her talent.
Anyone who saw Makarova do
"Swan Lake" with the company
last year at the Opera House, or

who will see her in the upcoming
production of "Giselle," would
feel the same.
But, as Erich Segal would tell
the story behind "Love Story," so
one must tell the story behind
"Romeo and Juliet."
The people in the cheaper
seats, arrive first; the peasants and
the peons take their places in the
absolute extremities of the
balcony, and the standing room
only people line the back of the
main floor seats draping
themselves over everything, half
an hour early fighting like beggars
for a place in the money parade.
Curtain was scheduled to go up
at 8:30,
At exactly, not approximately
8:20, the ruling class of San
Francisco begin checking out their
boxes, and shaking each other's
hands and smiling benevolently to
the people below them.
At 8:30 everybody was firmly
in their seats, ready to go, and
patiently, at that point, waiting
for the curtain to go up. At 8:45,
everybody was still in their seats,
but patience was definitely not a
part of it.
By nine o'clock, the
curtain was still not up.
Sometime later, a nervous man
with a white hankerchief appeared
on stage to announce the worst,
or so it seemed. Two of the
dancers (not Makarova) were not
performing and would be replaced
by other dancers. So?
With that, the curtain finally
went up, and 50 minutes later
went down, and nobody cared at
all.
Intermission time came, but it

did not go for 30 minutes. Those
of us in the orchestra section close
to the front heard this incredible
crash-boom-poof from the stage.
We all looked at each other, and
we knew something was
rotten . . . Sure enough, eternities
later another nervous man, this
time without a hanky, told the
audience, "Pardon us, the
switchboard has blown up."
By that time, anybody who
was anybody had gone, because
they were too embarrassed to be
caught waiting that long, and as a
result, they missed the best part
of the program. The last two
ballets, were Eliot Feild's, "A
Soldier's Tale," and a marvelous
abstract ballet by Alvin Ailey
"The River." It was worth waiting
for.
The entire company danced
extremely well, and turned in
technically fine performances.
Both the audience and the dancers
seemed to enjoy Duke Ellington's
music. "A Soldier's Tale" should
be seen by anyone who can't
imagine sleezy ballerinas.
Tickets are still available for
ballet performances all week,
including another presentation of
"The River," Saturday evening
which is well worth the time, and
both a matinee performance
Sunday of "Giselle," and a
Sunday evening performance of
"Giselle" danced by Natalia
Makarova.
"Giselle" rates with "Swan
Lake" as the finest classical ballet
to be seen. If you can see it done
by a Russian dancer like
Makarova, you will be very lucky.
I should have been so lucky.

dancing in the ABT Ballet's
opening night production of
"Romeo and Juliet," and having
to choose one of the two, I
wholeheartedly would
recommend that someone pay 75
cents to laugh at "Love Story" at
the Flicks than pay $10.00 to
sleep through "Romeo and
Juliet."
The American Ballet Theatre
opened its week long stay at the
Opera House, by reviving the
1943 ballet, bringing Romeo and
Juliet back from the dead, just to
have them die again on stage. It
was true tragedy.
It's not that the actual
production was below par
technically, quite the contrary,
everyone did the most they could
do with what they had, they just
didn't have anything. One is
disappointed at the sheer waste of
talent, especially that of
Makarova's, which went on for
almost an hour.
She dances, and danced
Monday night, brilliantly, with
the technical perfection that gives
her the appearance of clouds in
the air. I was really as angry as I
was disappointed that I payed
$10.00 to see Makarova dance
through something that did not
show a bit of her talent.
Anyone who saw Makarova do
"Swan Lake" with the company
last year at the Opera House, or

who will see her in the upcoming
production of "Giselle," would
feel the same.
But, as Erich Segal would tell
the story behind "Love Story," so
one must tell the story behind
"Romeo and Juliet."
The people in the cheaper
seats, arrive first; the peasants and
the peons take their places in the
absolute extremities of the
balcony, and the standing room
only people line the back of the
main floor seats draping
themselves over everything, half
an hour early fighting like beggars
for a place in the money parade.
Curtain was scheduled to go up
at 8:30,
At exactly, not approximately
8:20, the ruling class of San
Francisco begin checking out their
boxes, and shaking each other's
hands and smiling benevolently to
the people below them.
At 8:30 everybody was firmly
in their seats, ready to go, and
patiently, at that point, waiting
for the curtain to go up. At 8:45,
everybody was still in their seats,
but patience was definitely not a
part of it.
By nine o'clock, the
curtain was still not up.
Sometime later, a nervous man
with a white hankerchief appeared
on stage to announce the worst,
or so it seemed. Two of the
dancers (not Makarova) were not
performing and would be replaced
by other dancers. So?
With that, the curtain finally
went up, and 50 minutes later
went down, and nobody cared at
all.
Intermission time came, but it

did not go for 30 minutes. Those
of us in the orchestra section close
to the front heard this incredible
crash-boom-poof from the stage.
We all looked at each other, and
we knew something was
rotten . . . Sure enough, eternities
later another nervous man, this
time without a hanky, told the
audience, "Pardon us, the
switchboard has blown up."
By that time, anybody who
was anybody had gone, because
they were too embarrassed to be
caught waiting that long, and as a
result, they missed the best part
of the program. The last two
ballets, were Eliot Feild's, "A
Soldier's Tale," and a marvelous
abstract ballet by Alvin Ailey
"The River." It was worth waiting
for.
The entire company danced
extremely well, and turned in
technically fine performances.
Both the audience and the dancers
seemed to enjoy Duke Ellington's
music. "A Soldier's Tale" should
be seen by anyone who can't
imagine sleezy ballerinas.
Tickets are still available for
ballet performances all week,
including another presentation of
"The River," Saturday evening
which is well worth the time, and
both a matinee performance
Sunday of "Giselle," and a
Sunday evening performance of
"Giselle" danced by Natalia
Makarova.
"Giselle" rates with "Swan
Lake" as the finest classical ballet
to be seen. If you can see it done
by a Russian dancer like
Makarova, you will be very lucky.
I should have been so lucky.

It's not that the actual
production was below par
technically, quite the contrary,
everyone did the most they could
do with what they had, they just
didn't have anything. One is
disappointed at the sheer waste of
talent, especially that of
Makarova's, which went on for
almost an hour.
She dances, and danced
Monday night, brilliantly, with
the technical perfection that gives
her the appearance of clouds in
the air. I was really as angry as I
was disappointed that I payed
$10.00 to see Makarova dance
through something that did not
show a bit of her talent.
Anyone who saw Makarova do
"Swan Lake" with the company
last year at the Opera House, or

who will see her in the upcoming
production of "Giselle," would
feel the same.
But, as Erich Segal would tell
the story behind "Love Story," so
one must tell the story behind
"Romeo and Juliet."
The people in the cheaper
seats, arrive first; the peasants and
the peons take their places in the
absolute extremities of the
balcony, and the standing room
only people line the back of the
main floor seats draping
themselves over everything, half
an hour early fighting like beggars
for a place in the money parade.
Curtain was scheduled to go up
at 8:30,
At exactly, not approximately
8:20, the ruling class of San
Francisco begin checking out their
boxes, and shaking each other's
hands and smiling benevolently to
the people below them.
At 8:30 everybody was firmly
in their seats, ready to go, and
patiently, at that point, waiting
for the curtain to go up. At 8:45,
everybody was still in their seats,
but patience was definitely not a
part of it.
By nine o'clock, the
curtain was still not up.
Sometime later, a nervous man
with a white hankerchief appeared
on stage to announce the worst,
or so it seemed. Two of the
dancers (not Makarova) were not
performing and would be replaced
by other dancers. So?
With that, the curtain finally
went up, and 50 minutes later
went down, and nobody cared at
all.
Intermission time came, but it

did not go for 30 minutes. Those
of us in the orchestra section close
to the front heard this incredible
crash-boom-poof from the stage.
We all looked at each other, and
we knew something was
rotten . . . Sure enough, eternities
later another nervous man, this
time without a hanky, told the
audience, "Pardon us, the
switchboard has blown up."
By that time, anybody who
was anybody had gone, because
they were too embarrassed to be
caught waiting that long, and as a
result, they missed the best part
of the program. The last two
ballets, were Eliot Feild's, "A
Soldier's Tale," and a marvelous
abstract ballet by Alvin Ailey
"The River." It was worth waiting
for.
The entire company danced
extremely well, and turned in
technically fine performances.
Both the audience and the dancers
seemed to enjoy Duke Ellington's
music. "A Soldier's Tale" should
be seen by anyone who can't
imagine sleezy ballerinas.
Tickets are still available for
ballet performances all week,
including another presentation of
"The River," Saturday evening
which is well worth the time, and
both a matinee performance
Sunday of "Giselle," and a
Sunday evening performance of
"Giselle" danced by Natalia
Makarova.
"Giselle" rates with "Swan
Lake" as the finest classical ballet
to be seen. If you can see it done
by a Russian dancer like
Makarova, you will be very lucky.
I should have been so lucky.
