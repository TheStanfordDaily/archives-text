## Ellen Burstyn Speaks 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Actress Ellen Burstyn has
recently been selected as Best
Supporting Actress by the New
York Film Critics and the
National Film Critics for her
performance as Lois Farrow in
"The Last Picture Show." She is
also expected to be one of the
nominees for the Academy Award
in that category. Burstyn has
previously appeared in "Alex In
Wonderland, " "Goodbye,
Charlie," and "For Those Who
Think Young." She also stars in
the soon to-be-released "The King
Of Marvin Gardenswhich also
features Jack Nicholson and
which is directed by Bob
Rafelson, who directed "Five
Easy Pieces." Last Friday, Daily
Entertainment Editor Don
To lief son interviewed Burstyn in
San Francisco.

How did you enjoy working
with director Peter Bogdanovich
in "The Last Picture Show?" He's
terrific. I love Peter and 1 think
he's a great director. The same
thing goes for Bob Rafelson for
that matter.
How would you respond to the
criticism that Bogdanovich's
directing style is just a
compilation of the styles of other
directors whom he's studied? Is
there anything wrong with that?
Most styles are a compilation of
other styles. Peter's a brilliant film
historian.
Do you feel that "The Last
Picture Show" will be able to
change the values and perceptions
of many of the people who see it?
I feel that a film can only help
hasten the next step of your
enlightenment, which you would
eventually reach anyway.
How do you look upon your
role as Lois Farrow? Lois was a
product of her condition and she
passed her experience on to her
daughter. Lois has developed her
self-awareness within the confines
of her exposure.
Do you feel you're defending
the character you played?
Everybody has to be defended.
What do you think of Cybil
Shepard who played your
daughter Jacy in the film? She's a
very smart, young girl who is
finding herself.
Is there anyone in the film who
you particularly admired? On
location, you kind of fall in love
with everybody. Jeff Bridges was
a superb actor. I loved the
character Dwayne in the film. I
felt that way about all those
characters.
How do you feel about
winning the Best Supporting
Actress awards from the New
York Film Critics and the
National Film Critics? I consider
them an honor because of who
votes for them. They're critics
who have no investment in
anything. The Oscars are bullshit.
And I think Columbia is backing
"Nicholas & Alexandra" because
it cost more money and"The Last
Picture Show" is already making
money. But I still intend to attend

the Oscar ceremonies, because I
want to see those fellows stand up
for Charlie Chaplin. Bagdonavich
is filming a documentary on
Chaplin which will be shown at
his tribute which he'll attend in
person at the Oscar ceremonies.
As far as my own chances go, I
expect Ann-Margaret to win the
best supporting actress award for
her role in "Carnal Knowledge."
Would you support a boycott
of the Oscars? 1 don't think it's
that important.
But with all the publicity
games which surround the Oscars,
don't you feel compromised in
setting up a press conference? I
don't feel compromised being
interviewed. But I'd be
embarrassed to take out an ad for
myself to win an Oscar.
Who are some of the actresses
whom you especially admire? I
really liked Jane Fonda in
"Klute." I also admire Jeanne
Moreau and Dame Edith Evans.
What are some of the better
recent releases in your estimation?
I liked Klute and "El Topo" was
very good. "El Topo" was
Alexandro Jodorowsky's quest for
enlightenment.
Considering the criticism that
"El Topo" has received, do you
not feel that Jodorowsky
exploited violence in some ways?
No, I uncategorically feel that the
violence was a real part of his
spiritual quest. Somebody like
Sam Peckinpah exploits violence
in a film like "The Wild Bunch."
Peckinpah is sick.
Speaking of violence, how do
you feel about the current movie
rating system? I think the ratings
should be reversed so kids can go
to X-rated movies.
What is your next film about?
It will either be called "The King
of Marvin Gardens" or "The
Philosopher King." It's about a
triangular relationship. It has a
very psychological structure. It's a
very balanced triangular
relationship, until a fourth
character enters the scene. Then a
new triangle is formed and I get
left out.
What is your opinion of Jack
Nicholson who will be in the film
with you? Nicholson is building
the kind of career that English
actors have. He'll be a major
American artist.
What did Nicholson think
about "Drive, He Said," which
was the first movie he directed
and which has received a
considerable amount of bad
reviews? He thought it was a very
good first film.
What films do you have lined
up in the future? I've turned
down a number of offers recently.
I turned down a John Wayne film
which had Ben Jonson, who was
in "The Last Picture Show" in it.
I refused their first two offers and
the third offer they said, "What
do you want?" and I said, "I want
not to be in this movie." But I
didn't turn it down for political
reasons. I don't think politics. I

have no objection to being in a
good movie.
As a major actress, how do you
feel about the woman's movement
and someone like Gloria Steinem?
I think she's terrific. I think
everybody's in the women's
movement. It had to happen now.
You have also done a lot of
television acting in your career.
How do you feel about television?
I think it's violent all the time. 1
limit the amount of television my
10 year old son can watch. I don't
like the concept of people living
vicariously, which is what
television embodies.

Most styles are a compilation of
other styles. Peter's a brilliant film
historian.
Do you feel that "The Last
Picture Show" will be able to
change the values and perceptions
of many of the people who see it?
I feel that a film can only help
hasten the next step of your
enlightenment, which you would
eventually reach anyway.
How do you look upon your
role as Lois Farrow? Lois was a
product of her condition and she
passed her experience on to her
daughter. Lois has developed her
self-awareness within the confines
of her exposure.
Do you feel you're defending
the character you played?
Everybody has to be defended.
What do you think of Cybil
Shepard who played your
daughter Jacy in the film? She's a
very smart, young girl who is
finding herself.
Is there anyone in the film who
you particularly admired? On
location, you kind of fall in love
with everybody. Jeff Bridges was
a superb actor. I loved the
character Dwayne in the film. I
felt that way about all those
characters.
How do you feel about
winning the Best Supporting
Actress awards from the New
York Film Critics and the
National Film Critics? I consider
them an honor because of who
votes for them. They're critics
who have no investment in
anything. The Oscars are bullshit.
And I think Columbia is backing
"Nicholas & Alexandra" because
it cost more money and"The Last
Picture Show" is already making
money. But I still intend to attend

the Oscar ceremonies, because I
want to see those fellows stand up
for Charlie Chaplin. Bagdonavich
is filming a documentary on
Chaplin which will be shown at
his tribute which he'll attend in
person at the Oscar ceremonies.
As far as my own chances go, I
expect Ann-Margaret to win the
best supporting actress award for
her role in "Carnal Knowledge."
Would you support a boycott
of the Oscars? 1 don't think it's
that important.
But with all the publicity
games which surround the Oscars,
don't you feel compromised in
setting up a press conference? I
don't feel compromised being
interviewed. But I'd be
embarrassed to take out an ad for
myself to win an Oscar.
Who are some of the actresses
whom you especially admire? I
really liked Jane Fonda in
"Klute." I also admire Jeanne
Moreau and Dame Edith Evans.
What are some of the better
recent releases in your estimation?
I liked Klute and "El Topo" was
very good. "El Topo" was
Alexandro Jodorowsky's quest for
enlightenment.
Considering the criticism that
"El Topo" has received, do you
not feel that Jodorowsky
exploited violence in some ways?
No, I uncategorically feel that the
violence was a real part of his
spiritual quest. Somebody like
Sam Peckinpah exploits violence
in a film like "The Wild Bunch."
Peckinpah is sick.
Speaking of violence, how do
you feel about the current movie
rating system? I think the ratings
should be reversed so kids can go
to X-rated movies.
What is your next film about?
It will either be called "The King
of Marvin Gardens" or "The
Philosopher King." It's about a
triangular relationship. It has a
very psychological structure. It's a
very balanced triangular
relationship, until a fourth
character enters the scene. Then a
new triangle is formed and I get
left out.
What is your opinion of Jack
Nicholson who will be in the film
with you? Nicholson is building
the kind of career that English
actors have. He'll be a major
American artist.
What did Nicholson think
about "Drive, He Said," which
was the first movie he directed
and which has received a
considerable amount of bad
reviews? He thought it was a very
good first film.
What films do you have lined
up in the future? I've turned
down a number of offers recently.
I turned down a John Wayne film
which had Ben Jonson, who was
in "The Last Picture Show" in it.
I refused their first two offers and
the third offer they said, "What
do you want?" and I said, "I want
not to be in this movie." But I
didn't turn it down for political
reasons. I don't think politics. I

have no objection to being in a
good movie.
As a major actress, how do you
feel about the woman's movement
and someone like Gloria Steinem?
I think she's terrific. I think
everybody's in the women's
movement. It had to happen now.
You have also done a lot of
television acting in your career.
How do you feel about television?
I think it's violent all the time. 1
limit the amount of television my
10 year old son can watch. I don't
like the concept of people living
vicariously, which is what
television embodies.

National Film Critics? I consider
them an honor because of who
votes for them. They're critics
who have no investment in
anything. The Oscars are bullshit.
And I think Columbia is backing
"Nicholas & Alexandra" because
it cost more money and"The Last
Picture Show" is already making
money. But I still intend to attend

the Oscar ceremonies, because I
want to see those fellows stand up
for Charlie Chaplin. Bagdonavich
is filming a documentary on
Chaplin which will be shown at
his tribute which he'll attend in
person at the Oscar ceremonies.
As far as my own chances go, I
expect Ann-Margaret to win the
best supporting actress award for
her role in "Carnal Knowledge."
Would you support a boycott
of the Oscars? 1 don't think it's
that important.
But with all the publicity
games which surround the Oscars,
don't you feel compromised in
setting up a press conference? I
don't feel compromised being
interviewed. But I'd be
embarrassed to take out an ad for
myself to win an Oscar.
Who are some of the actresses
whom you especially admire? I
really liked Jane Fonda in
"Klute." I also admire Jeanne
Moreau and Dame Edith Evans.
What are some of the better
recent releases in your estimation?
I liked Klute and "El Topo" was
very good. "El Topo" was
Alexandro Jodorowsky's quest for
enlightenment.
Considering the criticism that
"El Topo" has received, do you
not feel that Jodorowsky
exploited violence in some ways?
No, I uncategorically feel that the
violence was a real part of his
spiritual quest. Somebody like
Sam Peckinpah exploits violence
in a film like "The Wild Bunch."
Peckinpah is sick.
Speaking of violence, how do
you feel about the current movie
rating system? I think the ratings
should be reversed so kids can go
to X-rated movies.
What is your next film about?
It will either be called "The King
of Marvin Gardens" or "The
Philosopher King." It's about a
triangular relationship. It has a
very psychological structure. It's a
very balanced triangular
relationship, until a fourth
character enters the scene. Then a
new triangle is formed and I get
left out.
What is your opinion of Jack
Nicholson who will be in the film
with you? Nicholson is building
the kind of career that English
actors have. He'll be a major
American artist.
What did Nicholson think
about "Drive, He Said," which
was the first movie he directed
and which has received a
considerable amount of bad
reviews? He thought it was a very
good first film.
What films do you have lined
up in the future? I've turned
down a number of offers recently.
I turned down a John Wayne film
which had Ben Jonson, who was
in "The Last Picture Show" in it.
I refused their first two offers and
the third offer they said, "What
do you want?" and I said, "I want
not to be in this movie." But I
didn't turn it down for political
reasons. I don't think politics. I

have no objection to being in a
good movie.
As a major actress, how do you
feel about the woman's movement
and someone like Gloria Steinem?
I think she's terrific. I think
everybody's in the women's
movement. It had to happen now.
You have also done a lot of
television acting in your career.
How do you feel about television?
I think it's violent all the time. 1
limit the amount of television my
10 year old son can watch. I don't
like the concept of people living
vicariously, which is what
television embodies.
Actress Ellen Burstyn has
recently been selected as Best
Supporting Actress by the New
York Film Critics and the
National Film Critics for her
performance as Lois Farrow in
"The Last Picture Show." She is
also expected to be one of the
nominees for the Academy Award
in that category. Burstyn has
previously appeared in "Alex In
Wonderland, " "Goodbye,
Charlie," and "For Those Who
Think Young." She also stars in
the soon to-be-released "The King
Of Marvin Gardenswhich also
features Jack Nicholson and
which is directed by Bob
Rafelson, who directed "Five
Easy Pieces." Last Friday, Daily
Entertainment Editor Don
To lief son interviewed Burstyn in
San Francisco.

How did you enjoy working
with director Peter Bogdanovich
in "The Last Picture Show?" He's
terrific. I love Peter and 1 think
he's a great director. The same
thing goes for Bob Rafelson for
that matter.
How would you respond to the
criticism that Bogdanovich's
directing style is just a
compilation of the styles of other
directors whom he's studied? Is
there anything wrong with that?
Most styles are a compilation of
other styles. Peter's a brilliant film
historian.
Do you feel that "The Last
Picture Show" will be able to
change the values and perceptions
of many of the people who see it?
I feel that a film can only help
hasten the next step of your
enlightenment, which you would
eventually reach anyway.
How do you look upon your
role as Lois Farrow? Lois was a
product of her condition and she
passed her experience on to her
daughter. Lois has developed her
self-awareness within the confines
of her exposure.
Do you feel you're defending
the character you played?
Everybody has to be defended.
What do you think of Cybil
Shepard who played your
daughter Jacy in the film? She's a
very smart, young girl who is
finding herself.
Is there anyone in the film who
you particularly admired? On
location, you kind of fall in love
with everybody. Jeff Bridges was
a superb actor. I loved the
character Dwayne in the film. I
felt that way about all those
characters.
How do you feel about
winning the Best Supporting
Actress awards from the New
York Film Critics and the
National Film Critics? I consider
them an honor because of who
votes for them. They're critics
who have no investment in
