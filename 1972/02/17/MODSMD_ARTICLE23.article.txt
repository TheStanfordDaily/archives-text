New Hampshire Buildings Bombed
MANCHESTER, N.H. — The bombing of police and fire
headquarters here yesterday has been linked by the state
attorney general to plans to blow up the New Hampshire
primary headquarters of President Nixon.
A man and a woman were arrested and charged in the
bombings shortly after the three blasts occurred. Atty.
Gen. Warren Pudman said that when the two were taken
into custody a news release concerning the bombings also
was obtained.
The release said that besides the police station, the
Nixon headquarters also had been a target. No bomb was
found at the headquarters, where 12 antiwar
demonstrators were arrested Saturday during a talk by
George Romney, secretary of the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development.
A fourth bomb was discovered by a janitor on the
outside window ledge of Police Chief John Stips' office.
Demolition experts said the bomb didn't explode because
of faulty wiring.
No policemen or firemen were injured when three
bombs shattered windows at the police station and the
nearby new fire headquarters. Authorities said the bombs
had been placed outside the buildings.
Rudman said the news release linked the bombings to a
group called "The People's Liberation Army." Referring
to the anti-Nixon demonstration, the typewritten
statement said "the pigs viciously attacked them" and
that "while demonstrations like this are necessary, we are
not going to get far, always fighting on the pigs' terms."
Valerie Hawkins of Dover, a spokesman for the group
that demonstrated at the Nixon headquarters, denied that
this group had any connection with the bombings. "Our
purposes were peaceful. We were demonstrating against
Nixon, not against the Manchester police," she said.
Nixon Leaves For China
WASHINGTON — President Nixon, after doing llth-hour
homework at his secluded mountaintop retreat, departs
this morning on the first leg of his self-described "Journey
for Peace" to China.
As Nixon prepared to fly back by helicopter after an
overnight stay at Camp David in Maryland's Catoctin
Mountains, aides wrapped up final details for his historic
13-day, 20,395-mile trip — including plans for a
star-spangled departure ceremony.
Congressional leaders and Cabinet officials are to join a

thousand flag-waving school children who will be on the
White House South Lawn to bid farewell to the President,
Mrs. Nixon and the 13-member official party at 7 a.m.
PST. He will fly non-stop to Hawaii today.
Nixon will make brief remarks at the departure
ceremony which follows a White House meeting with
bipartisan congressional leaders.
US. Air Force Blasts North Again
SAIGON — American fighter-bombers launched scores of
strikes yesterday against powerful Soviet-made 130 mm
artillery inside North Vietnam and resumed pounding the
targets this morning, the U.S. Command announced.
The command said one Air Force F4 was shot down
yesterday inside North Vietnam just north of the
Demilitarized Zone and the two crewmen are listed as
missing. Radio Hanoi claimed two planes were sfiot down
and a number of airmen killed or captured.
The raids were the heaviest inside North Vietnam since
the intensive bombing last Dec. 26-30. The downed F4
was the first reported loss of American aircraft and airmen
over North Vietnam since the December raids.
Seven Sailors Take Sanctuary
SAN DIEGO — Seven sailors, including six from the
aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, were in sanctuary at churches
yesterday hours before the ship's departure for Vietnam.
As two dozen persons picketed the ship, five crewmen
were given sanctuary in the First Church of the Bretheran.
The Navy confirmed, meanwhile, that the carrier with
80 planes would leave for the war zone as antiwar
spokesmen had told a group of 150 persons at a rally
Tuesday.
"The attack carrier will sail about a month earlier than
normally scheduled as a precautionary measure," said
Adm. Bernard A. Clarey, commander of the U.S. Pacific
Fleet.
British Power Crisis Deepens
LONDON — The toll of jobless approached three million
yesterday because of the power crisis and Britons were
told to expect even more hours without lights and heat.
But a bright spot appeared. An independent inquiry
into the coal miners' strike that has forced electricity cuts
came to an end and its members promised to recommend
a pay settlement by tomorrow. If accepted by the
government's Coal Board and the union, an end could
come by the weekend to Britain's worst blackout since
the blitz in World War 11.
Soviet Fishermen Fined
ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Three Soviet officers were fined
a total of $80,000 yesterday on charges of conducting
illegal fisheries support activities in U.S. waters, and
$170,000 more will be paid to satisfy a civil complaint
against their two ships.
A plea of guilty was directed by a federal judge in the
criminal charges against the three officers after they asked
that their pleas be changed from innocent to no contest.
They were fined a total of $80,000.
G. Kent Edwards, U.S. attorney in Alaska, announced
a $170,000 out-of-court settlement in the civil compalint
against the two ships, the 362-foot processing vessel
Lamut and trawler Kolyvan. The vessels, seized by the
Coast Guard last month about nine miles from St.
Matthew Island in the Bering Sea, are being held on Adak
Island.
The fines are to be paid by the Soviet Embassy to the
Justice Department in Washington, D.C., today.
