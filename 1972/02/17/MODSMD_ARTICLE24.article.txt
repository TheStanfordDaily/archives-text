# Faculty Club Hearing Start In Doubt
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP)
hearings for Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement member Kwonping Ho,
scheduled to begin at 1:30 p.m. today,
may be delayed indefinitely due to
questions arising over the hearing
officer's connection with a
prosecution witness.
Ho is charged with two counts of
violating the Fundamental Standard
stemming from the invasion of the
Faculty Club on January 24.
Specifically, Ho is charged with assault
on chief Club chef Arturo Lionetti and
forcibly entering the Club kitchen
with the intent to steal food.
Defense counsel Zach Wasserman

yesterday morning asked CJP
Chairman John Kaplan to question
hearing officer Leslie Minkus about
Minkus' connection with prosecution
witness and Stanford law professor
Jack Friedenthal. Minkus is a professor
at Golden Gate College of Law.
Friedenthal at one time headed the
Stanford Judicial Council, the
predecessor of the CJP.
Minkus, who is a former attorney
for the Office of Economic
Opportunity (OEO) and for California
Rural Legal Assistance (CRLA),
admitted having studied under
Friedenthal about twelve years ago.
Minkus said he felt he could judge the
hearing fairly in spite of this

connection.
Nevertheless, Kaplan decided that if
he received a formal motion from the
defense to disqualify Minkus as the
hearing officer, he would grant that
motion. Kaplan explained last night to
the Daily that "it is very important
that it [the hearing] is seen to be fair
by the community."
Should the hearing in fact go on, it
will be held in the Annenburg
Auditorium of the Cummings Art
Building. In addition to Wasserman,
defense counsel in the case will be law
students Wally Hunkeler and Jerry
Peterson. Special Assistant to the
President John Schwartz will
prosecute for the University.
