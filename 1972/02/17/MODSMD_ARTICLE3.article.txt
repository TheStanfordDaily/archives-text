# CSEA-SEA Won't Debate Competitors As Employee Union Election Nears
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
The three groups competing for the
votes of Stanford workers in the
March 7 election to unionize the
University will not meet in a debate.
Forrest Futtere, vice president of
the California School Employees
Association - Stanford Employee
Association (CSEA - SEA), said the
chances for a debate are "none
whatsoever.
"Absolutely not," Futtere said.
"There is nothing to discuss. There is
just nothing we are willing to discuss
with them."
The other two unions — United
Stanford Employees (USE) and the
Teamsters — both challenged CSEA -
SEA when the union held a meeting
last Thursday night for workers.
Stacked Deck
At the time, Bill Young, CSEA -
SEA negotiator, said debates were "a
stacked deck" and advised the other
two unions: "The only time I play
with a stacked deck is when I stack
it."
Neither USE nor the Teamsters has
made a formal offer to CSEA - SEA,
but both made the informal challenge
Thursday, and both indicated they art 1
preparing letters offering to meet on
any terms CSEA - SEA would like. But
no one expects CSEA - SEA to pick up
the challenge.
"We feel we have something to
offer, and we want the people to
compare it with what the other unions
have," said Art Blevins of the
Teamsters Stanford Organizing
Committee (TSOC). "But we can
understand that CSEA might not have

anything to offer."
"They've been the main union on
this campus for three years. They've
had a chance to operate without much
outside interference and without
having to fight too much with other
unions. And what have they done?"
Blevins continued. "If you ask them
on a podium what they've done the
last three years and they come up
empty-handed, it could be pretty
embarrassing."
Paranoid
Jim Berk, USE president, said he
was "whole-heartedly in favor" of the
idea of a debate. He said CSEA - SEA
was "paranoid" and called the union's
position "the weakest of the three.
Any time they have to compete, they
just wither. I don't blame them. If I
were them, I'd avoid it, too."
Futtere said that the only reason
that the Teamsters and USE had
proposed a debate was because they
had no positive issues of their own to
stress. "They would not take issue
with us if they had any position to
stand on," he said.
Blevins admitted that both his
organization and USE had turned a
great deal of fire on CSEA - SEA. "It's
better to have a union than no union
and with CSEA you have no union at
all," he said. He said that fact would
show up on a debate: "On a forum
like they had the other night
(Thursday] they can shove the
question right off their shoulder and
they don't have to answer it at all. In a
debate, where they have so much time
to fill, they have to answer it."
Keith Stothers, another member of

TSOC, also said that CSEA - SEA
deserved attack more than the other
two unions.
'Claimed So Much'
"They have claimed so much in the
past and put out a letter to the effect
that they have demanded this and
demanded that and demanded all these
things and they have gotten all these
things from the University," Stothers
said. "We know for a fact that they
never demand anything,(lhiat they only
asked for things and said' felt that
no one should have the right to
demand anything irom the
University."
Futtere was reluctant to answer the
charges by USE and the Teamsters
that CSEA - SEA was a "company
union" without conferring with the
rest of the union members. "We let
our people decide how we stand," he
said.
He suggested that the Daily submit
questions in writing to the
organization.
Stothers suggested that the debate
be held in Memorial Auditorium on
University time. "President Lyman
suggested that we inform ourselves as
much as we can," he pointed out.
"That's about the best way there is to
inform yourself."
lan Jacobsen, assistant director of
personnel services, said he doubted the
University would agree to such a
scheme.
Sufficient Time
"The University position is that
there is a sufficient amount of time
and sufficient time during lunch hours

and after work and so on to allow
employees to have access to union
representatives and find the
information thev need," he said.
