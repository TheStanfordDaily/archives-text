# Child Care Center Balloting On Assessment Begins Today
## 
### DAN BRENNER 
Stanford students will vote today
and tomorrow on a referendum that
asks for $1 assessment next quarter to
provide funding for major renovations
for the Children's Center of the
Stanford Community (CCSC).
The funds, center leaders contend,
are necessary to bring the May Held
Avenue facility up to state licensing
standards and make the Center
available for other sources of funding.
The referendum, which was turned
down by students last quarter, was the
subject of a KZSU debate yesterday
between Jim Newcommer and Anne
Murphy of CCSC, and Chris Hocker
and Robin Friedman of the Stanford
Voluntarists, who oppose the
assessment.
Murphy attacked a statement made
by Hocker in yesterday's Daily which
contended that there were 38 other
day nurseries between San Mateo and
Mountain View that could serve
Stanford. Murphy, an undergraduate
mother, noted that only two of those
were on a graduated-fee scale, and
none of them served children two and

a half years or younger.
Convenience?
Hocker claimed that the CCSC "is
not a need and at best a convenience,"
noting that one-half of one percent of
the student population use it."The
whole issue is a comedy re-run of an
issue that serves so very few students,"
he said.
Newcommer stressed the
importance of maintaining a quality
facility. Defending a $2000 budget
appropriation for educational and
playground equipment he said. "You
can go out and beg for equipment, but
if you spend some money for solid
equipment, it'll last for 10 years."
Friedman, noting that if people
wanted to support the Center they
could donate voluntarily, maintained
that students "should only have to pay
half of the approximately $12,000
that would be raised by the
assessment.
According to figures from CCSC's
January, 1972, records, 35 students,
17 staff, and 10 faculty as well as 22
persons who are not related to

Stanford but whose spouses are, use
the Day Care Center. The Little Kids'
Place, the facility for children two and
one half years or younger, is used by
23 students, 22 staff, 10 faculty, and
53 Stanford-spouse related persons.
Bank Loans
The Voluntarists suggested that the
CCSC should seek bank loans in order
to cover expenses. Newcommer felt
that this wasn't practical, especially
until the Center is licensed. Murphy
added that the reason they were
coming to the student body was
because "we've tried everything else,"
and that the funds might allow the
Center to expand to a larger facility.
Mocker objected to the lack of a
guarantee that the Center would be
licensed. Murphy replied, "We can't
automatically be sure we're going to
get a license. We're going to try as hard
as possible to get it."
Voting on the assessment will take
place from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. today
and tomorrow at the Post Office,
Engineering Corner, Physics Tank, and
lounges of the Business, Law and
Medical Schools.
