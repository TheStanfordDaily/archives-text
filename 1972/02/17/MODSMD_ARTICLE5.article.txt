## Approve Fee Assessment 
### 
Students will vote today and tomorrow on
whether to assess themselves SI in order to keep the
Children's Center of the Stanford Community in
operation. The Daily feels this assessment should be
approved.
To meet state licensing requirements the Center
must raise several thousand dollars immediately.
Operating, as it does as a self-supporting
cooperative, with a sliding fee scale based on ability
to pay, the Center must have this one time
assessment in order to survive.
The Children's Center provides complete day
care facilities virtually unavailable elsewhere in the
area. If the Center closed, more than 100 Stanford
families (more than half of them student families),
would be forced to compete for places at a handful
of off-campus centers already overburdened
attempting to meet the needs of their own
communities.
The University, as a major employer and as a
major "importer" of low income student families is
shirking its responsibility in refusing to provide
funding to keep a child care center going. It is with
great reluctance that we urge students to pick up

the burden in this emergency. Child care center
support is certainly a legitimate use of University
moneys.
The majority of students do not have children
now, but do have a stake in child care. Support for
the child care center is support for the kind of
community we prefer to live in. Families with
children should not be forced to retire one of the
parents, usually the mother, from work or school
for babysitting duty. Day care can equally well be
provided in a group setting freeing adults for other
occupations.
The Center should eventually be expanded far
beyond its present capacity. It has been estimated
that there are currently 3000 pre-school children in
the Stanford community. Many of their parents
would like to have day care arrangements. This
expansion will have to be financed by the
University.
When the Center obtains its license, we feel that
the University should take over what the students
have begun. Day care based on the ability to pay
should eventually be available to all Stanford
students and staff.
