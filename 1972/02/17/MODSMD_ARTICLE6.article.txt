## Treason Implies Consent

marcy kann

Several of the individuals
interviewed as potential jurors in
the Berrigan case have alluded to
the treasonous nature of the acts
for which the defendants are
being brought to trial. (Time, 14
Feb., 1972) Whether the
Harrisburg Seven are formally
tried for treason or not, the
charge of conspiracy (particularly
in such a case as this one, in which
the .government is the party
bringing the suit) evokes an
emotional reaction of
outrage —and personal
hurt—against the "traitors."
In spite of our having strong
feelings about the abstract
concept, treason, we actually have
very nebulous notions about what
conditions must exist for treason
to exist, that is, what kinds of
relationships permit and what

kinds prohibit an individual's
being a traitor.
The Constitution states:
"Treason against the United
States shall consist only in levying
war against them, or in adhering
to their enemies, giving them aid
and comfort." Lysander Spooner,
a constitutional lawyer writing
just before the Civil War,
extrapolates that treason implies
"treachery, deceit, breach of
faith... . A traitor is a
betrayer—who who practices
injury, while professing
friendship." (No Treason, Nol 2,
P- 7)
The Constitution was originally
drawn up as a contractual
agreement between parties
voluntarily consenting to be
governed by it. If a person does
not choose to accept this

contract, therefore, he is not in
any way bound by it, and, of
course, he is not guaranteed the
corresponding liberties provided
for those who submitted to be
bound by it. It is almost
unnecessary to add that a
government thus established,
based solely on the consent of the
goverened, may not initiate action
against individuals not under its
jurisdiction without perverting
justice vis a vis these
extra-governmental persons.
Consent to Government
If an individual has not freely
consented, that is, without
coercion of any sort, to a

government, (and I seriously
doubt that any of the defendants
in the Berrigan case was ever
asked to sign the Constitution)
then there is no way imaginable
for him to break any promise of
allegiance to the government, as
no such promise was ever made by
him.
Neither can one be a traitor if
he informs thepartywith whom he
has contracted (that is, the
government) that he no longer
wishes to receive its services, or
that he does not wish to be
associated with the party any
longer. Any action which he
subsequently takes to injure the
government is no breach of faith
and therefore is not treason.
Men who take action against
the government without
announcing their break with the
government are no more guilty of
treason than the men in the two
previous situations, if they are so
acting to resist the usurpations of
their natural rights to life, liberty
and property by the government.
Aiding and Abetting
To fail to take such action
would be treason, as it would be
aiding and abetting forces
antagonistic to justice, and hence
in opposition to any government

which claims to act in accordance
with justice.
There are no grounds, then, for
charging the defendants with
treason or rendering any decision
on their case based on the
assumption that they have acted
traitorously. In fact, one might
ask whether the "crime of
treason" isn't* really a specious
crime, manufactured by those
who hold political power, to
assure themselves continued
power.
This point is one which we
ought to keep in mind, not only
in our reading of the trial of the
Harrisburg Seven, or the Chicago
Eight, or Daniel Ellsberg and
Anthony Russo, but also, in a

year which will perhaps witness
new political trials in the wake of
demonstrations at the national
political nominating conventions.

in such a case as this one, in which
the .government is the party
bringing the suit) evokes an
emotional reaction of
outrage —and personal
hurt—against the "traitors."
In spite of our having strong
feelings about the abstract
concept, treason, we actually have
very nebulous notions about what
conditions must exist for treason
to exist, that is, what kinds of
relationships permit and what

kinds prohibit an individual's
being a traitor.
The Constitution states:
"Treason against the United
States shall consist only in levying
war against them, or in adhering
to their enemies, giving them aid
and comfort." Lysander Spooner,
a constitutional lawyer writing
just before the Civil War,
extrapolates that treason implies
"treachery, deceit, breach of
faith... . A traitor is a
betrayer—who who practices
injury, while professing
friendship." (No Treason, Nol 2,
P- 7)
The Constitution was originally
drawn up as a contractual
agreement between parties
voluntarily consenting to be
governed by it. If a person does
not choose to accept this

contract, therefore, he is not in
any way bound by it, and, of
course, he is not guaranteed the
corresponding liberties provided
for those who submitted to be
bound by it. It is almost
unnecessary to add that a
government thus established,
based solely on the consent of the
goverened, may not initiate action
against individuals not under its
jurisdiction without perverting
justice vis a vis these
extra-governmental persons.
Consent to Government
If an individual has not freely
consented, that is, without
coercion of any sort, to a

government, (and I seriously
doubt that any of the defendants
in the Berrigan case was ever
asked to sign the Constitution)
then there is no way imaginable
for him to break any promise of
allegiance to the government, as
no such promise was ever made by
him.
Neither can one be a traitor if
he informs thepartywith whom he
has contracted (that is, the
government) that he no longer
wishes to receive its services, or
that he does not wish to be
associated with the party any
longer. Any action which he
subsequently takes to injure the
government is no breach of faith
and therefore is not treason.
Men who take action against
the government without
announcing their break with the
government are no more guilty of
treason than the men in the two
previous situations, if they are so
acting to resist the usurpations of
their natural rights to life, liberty
and property by the government.
Aiding and Abetting
To fail to take such action
would be treason, as it would be
aiding and abetting forces
antagonistic to justice, and hence
in opposition to any government

which claims to act in accordance
with justice.
There are no grounds, then, for
charging the defendants with
treason or rendering any decision
on their case based on the
assumption that they have acted
traitorously. In fact, one might
ask whether the "crime of
treason" isn't* really a specious
crime, manufactured by those
who hold political power, to
assure themselves continued
power.
This point is one which we
ought to keep in mind, not only
in our reading of the trial of the
Harrisburg Seven, or the Chicago
Eight, or Daniel Ellsberg and
Anthony Russo, but also, in a

year which will perhaps witness
new political trials in the wake of
demonstrations at the national
political nominating conventions.
