Editor, THE DAILY:
A number of us on the Daily
staff are opposed to the fee
assessment being voted on in the
upcoming student body election
which would provide a subsidy to
the on-campus cooperative
nursery school which calls itself
the "Children's Center of the
Stanford Community."
Each of us opposes taxing
students to pay for this venture
for some if not all of the
following reasons:
—This Children's Center does
not aid the general student
welfare. That is, it does not
benefit each and every student.
—The fee assessment will have
tangible effects only for the small
interest group which is promoting
the referendum and sends its
children to the center.
—In this case, students are
subsidizing faculty and staff
children.
—Surely those who support
those who refuse to pay income
tax and telephone tax (because
they pay for the war) should
respect those who do not want to
support child-care centers.
—The political composition of
the personnel at the Children's
Center makes the facility liable to
be an indoctrination center rather
than a nursery school or creche.
—The people running the
Children's Center have proven
themselves incompetent. (This is
why they need a subsidy.) This
was the basis of Chaparral
editorial opposition to child-care
fee assessments in the past.
—This is a charity drive
enforced by an election.
Voluntary charity is quite proper;

forced charity is not.
—Single students here on
financial aid are not the
stereotypical "rich" students
described in some
pro-child-care-assessment
statements. Some of these
scholarship students have
correctly pointed out that they
are in no position to be paying for
all these assessments, otherwise
they would be married and have
children of their own. These
students believe that students,
faculty members, and staff
members should be similarly
responsible and not have children
they cannot afford.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Once again we hear Chris
Hocker holding forth on his
theory of why one should vote
"no" on the Child Care
referendum. At one point in his
article he states: "the Child Care
referendum was defeated by
nearly two hundred votes" and
therefore he argues that the
community should not be
presented with the question again.
Interestingly enough, the
Hocker-Friedman slate was
defeated last spring by more than
two hundred votes. By his own
logic, I would certainly hope that
we never have to hear from either
of them again in electoral politics.
The issues raised by Mr.
Hocker about the Day Care fee
assessment are ones that should be
addressed. Mr. Hocker,
unfortunately, does so in a way

which is entirely self-serving and
non-informative.
First, he states that the
percentage of students with
children who need the center is
"tiny if not non-existent." This is
patently false as I feel Mr. Hocker
must realize. Taking a quick tour
around Escondido Village should
be enough to convince one of
that. If such direct observation is
not enough, one should check the
number of requests for places at
the Day Care Center by students
which could not be
accommodated because of lack of
space. The fact is that students
need this center very much. The
reason that the center is now
unable to serve all the students
who need the service is because
they must pay their bills out of
fees. Therefore, approximately
half the children must pay full
scale fees in order for the center
to survive. Contrary to what Mr.
Hocker may believe, most
Stanford graduate or
undergraduate parents are not
wealthy enough to afford full
scale. So faculty children are
placed because they can afford to
pay-
Mr. Hocker also sites the
number of Day Care centers in
operation from San Mateo to
Mountain View. What he is saying,
in effect, is that if you are a
student at Stanford, you should
truck your kid to San Mateo
before class. Great idea! He goes
on to modify, this by saying that
there are 17 centers (there are
really only 10) in Palo Alto.
Inconvenience and cost would
prevent most students from using
these other facilities.

I cannot help but wonder how
much Mr. Hocker's concern is
really "coercive taxing" and how
much is sexist bais. He apparently
wants to make it as difficult as
possible for women who are
students and have children to
continue their education. The idea
of not paying just because you do
not directly use the service at this
point in time is ridiculous.
Following that line of reasoning,
those of us who don't have school
age children would refuse to pay
property tax, and those of us who
are still young would withhold the
portion of our taxes which goes to
social security.
I don't think that any of us
would ever attribute a soft spot in
the heart to Chris Hocker. On the
basis of his arguments, a soft spot
in the head may be more
appropriate.

When is Daily editor Frank
Miller going independent?
While the Stanford community
debates the pros and cons of
student-subsidized child care, it
should also know of the Daily's
conflict of interest in this issue.
At the Daily editorial meeting
which hammered out the Daily
endorsement of the fee
assessment, four Daily editorial
board members noted that coming
out against fee assessments would
not be in the Daily's interest since
the Daily would be asking for a
subsidy from the students in the
spring.
The Daily intends to ask the
students for a $2 fee assessment

this spring to enable the paper to
"go independent."
Two years ago the Daily
alleged that it needed a fee
assessment to prevent the paper
from reducing the number of
pages in each issue. The student
body voted for the fee assessment,
and the Daily reduced the size of
its average issue anyway. The
Daily also claimed that the fee
assessment would provide "the
nest egg of reserves which can
eventually make the Daily
financially independent and free
for all students." (Daily, April 14,
1970. p. 2.) Two years have
passed, and the Daily is neither
free nor independent.
Last year the Daily asked for
an increase in its fee assessment of
25%. They argued that they
needed the money to move
towards independence and avoid
censorship from the University.
They cried "freedom of the
press," and the referendum
passed, yet the Daily is still not
independent.
Between the two fee elections
President Lyman called for an
independent Daily after the paper
ran an article by radical D.
McGuire. Since then, the Daily
has not become independent, but
there has been a noticeable shift
to the right in the paper's news
and opinions pages. And the
University has ceased its loud calls
for Daily independence.
The Daily's support for the
child care assessment takes on a
different light when it is seen as
merely a prelude to bigger (and
better?) requests from students.

patently false as I feel Mr. Hocker
must realize. Taking a quick tour
around Escondido Village should
be enough to convince one of
that. If such direct observation is
not enough, one should check the
number of requests for places at
the Day Care Center by students
which could not be
accommodated because of lack of
space. The fact is that students
need this center very much. The
reason that the center is now
unable to serve all the students
who need the service is because
they must pay their bills out of
fees. Therefore, approximately
half the children must pay full
scale fees in order for the center
to survive. Contrary to what Mr.
Hocker may believe, most
Stanford graduate or
undergraduate parents are not
wealthy enough to afford full
scale. So faculty children are
placed because they can afford to
pay-
Mr. Hocker also sites the
number of Day Care centers in
operation from San Mateo to
Mountain View. What he is saying,
in effect, is that if you are a
student at Stanford, you should
truck your kid to San Mateo
before class. Great idea! He goes
on to modify, this by saying that
there are 17 centers (there are
really only 10) in Palo Alto.
Inconvenience and cost would
prevent most students from using
these other facilities.

I cannot help but wonder how
much Mr. Hocker's concern is
really "coercive taxing" and how
much is sexist bais. He apparently
wants to make it as difficult as
possible for women who are
students and have children to
continue their education. The idea
of not paying just because you do
not directly use the service at this
point in time is ridiculous.
Following that line of reasoning,
those of us who don't have school
age children would refuse to pay
property tax, and those of us who
are still young would withhold the
portion of our taxes which goes to
social security.
I don't think that any of us
would ever attribute a soft spot in
the heart to Chris Hocker. On the
basis of his arguments, a soft spot
in the head may be more
appropriate.

When is Daily editor Frank
Miller going independent?
While the Stanford community
debates the pros and cons of
student-subsidized child care, it
should also know of the Daily's
conflict of interest in this issue.
At the Daily editorial meeting
which hammered out the Daily
endorsement of the fee
assessment, four Daily editorial
board members noted that coming
out against fee assessments would
not be in the Daily's interest since
the Daily would be asking for a
subsidy from the students in the
spring.
The Daily intends to ask the
students for a $2 fee assessment

this spring to enable the paper to
"go independent."
Two years ago the Daily
alleged that it needed a fee
assessment to prevent the paper
from reducing the number of
pages in each issue. The student
body voted for the fee assessment,
and the Daily reduced the size of
its average issue anyway. The
Daily also claimed that the fee
assessment would provide "the
nest egg of reserves which can
eventually make the Daily
financially independent and free
for all students." (Daily, April 14,
1970. p. 2.) Two years have
passed, and the Daily is neither
free nor independent.
Last year the Daily asked for
an increase in its fee assessment of
25%. They argued that they
needed the money to move
towards independence and avoid
censorship from the University.
They cried "freedom of the
press," and the referendum
passed, yet the Daily is still not
independent.
Between the two fee elections
President Lyman called for an
independent Daily after the paper
ran an article by radical D.
McGuire. Since then, the Daily
has not become independent, but
there has been a noticeable shift
to the right in the paper's news
and opinions pages. And the
University has ceased its loud calls
for Daily independence.
The Daily's support for the
child care assessment takes on a
different light when it is seen as
merely a prelude to bigger (and
better?) requests from students.

A number of us on the Daily
staff are opposed to the fee
assessment being voted on in the
upcoming student body election
which would provide a subsidy to
the on-campus cooperative
nursery school which calls itself
the "Children's Center of the
Stanford Community."
Each of us opposes taxing
students to pay for this venture
for some if not all of the
following reasons:
—This Children's Center does
not aid the general student
welfare. That is, it does not
benefit each and every student.
—The fee assessment will have
tangible effects only for the small
interest group which is promoting
the referendum and sends its
children to the center.
—In this case, students are
subsidizing faculty and staff
children.
—Surely those who support
those who refuse to pay income
tax and telephone tax (because
they pay for the war) should
respect those who do not want to
support child-care centers.
—The political composition of
the personnel at the Children's
Center makes the facility liable to
be an indoctrination center rather
than a nursery school or creche.
—The people running the
Children's Center have proven
themselves incompetent. (This is
why they need a subsidy.) This
was the basis of Chaparral
editorial opposition to child-care
fee assessments in the past.
—This is a charity drive
enforced by an election.
Voluntary charity is quite proper;

forced charity is not.
—Single students here on
financial aid are not the
stereotypical "rich" students
described in some
pro-child-care-assessment
statements. Some of these
scholarship students have
correctly pointed out that they
are in no position to be paying for
all these assessments, otherwise
they would be married and have
children of their own. These
students believe that students,
faculty members, and staff
members should be similarly
responsible and not have children
they cannot afford.

Once again we hear Chris
Hocker holding forth on his
theory of why one should vote
"no" on the Child Care
referendum. At one point in his
article he states: "the Child Care
referendum was defeated by
nearly two hundred votes" and
therefore he argues that the
community should not be
presented with the question again.
Interestingly enough, the
Hocker-Friedman slate was
defeated last spring by more than
two hundred votes. By his own
logic, I would certainly hope that
we never have to hear from either
of them again in electoral politics.
The issues raised by Mr.

assessment are ones that should be

body voted for the fee assessment,
and the Daily reduced the size of
its average issue anyway. The
Daily also claimed that the fee
assessment would provide "the
nest egg of reserves which can
eventually make the Daily
financially independent and free
for all students." (Daily, April 14,
1970. p. 2.) Two years have
passed, and the Daily is neither
free nor independent.
Last year the Daily asked for
an increase in its fee assessment of
25%. They argued that they
needed the money to move
towards independence and avoid
censorship from the University.
They cried "freedom of the
press," and the referendum
passed, yet the Daily is still not
independent.
Between the two fee elections
President Lyman called for an
independent Daily after the paper
ran an article by radical D.
McGuire. Since then, the Daily
has not become independent, but
there has been a noticeable shift
to the right in the paper's news
and opinions pages. And the
University has ceased its loud calls
for Daily independence.
The Daily's support for the
child care assessment takes on a
different light when it is seen as
merely a prelude to bigger (and
better?) requests from students.

A number of us on the Daily
staff are opposed to the fee
assessment being voted on in the
upcoming student body election
which would provide a subsidy to
the on-campus cooperative
nursery school which calls itself
the "Children's Center of the
Stanford Community."
Each of us opposes taxing
students to pay for this venture
for some if not all of the
following reasons:
—This Children's Center does
not aid the general student
welfare. That is, it does not
benefit each and every student.
—The fee assessment will have
tangible effects only for the small
interest group which is promoting
the referendum and sends its
children to the center.
—In this case, students are
subsidizing faculty and staff
children.
—Surely those who support
those who refuse to pay income
tax and telephone tax (because
they pay for the war) should
respect those who do not want to
support child-care centers.
—The political composition of
the personnel at the Children's
Center makes the facility liable to
be an indoctrination center rather
than a nursery school or creche.
—The people running the
Children's Center have proven
themselves incompetent. (This is
why they need a subsidy.) This
was the basis of Chaparral
editorial opposition to child-care
fee assessments in the past.
—This is a charity drive
enforced by an election.
Voluntary charity is quite proper;

forced charity is not.
—Single students here on
financial aid are not the
stereotypical "rich" students
described in some
pro-child-care-assessment
statements. Some of these
scholarship students have
correctly pointed out that they
are in no position to be paying for
all these assessments, otherwise
they would be married and have
children of their own. These
students believe that students,
faculty members, and staff
members should be similarly
responsible and not have children
they cannot afford.

Once again we hear Chris
Hocker holding forth on his
theory of why one should vote
"no" on the Child Care
referendum. At one point in his
article he states: "the Child Care
referendum was defeated by
nearly two hundred votes" and
therefore he argues that the
community should not be
presented with the question again.
Interestingly enough, the
Hocker-Friedman slate was
defeated last spring by more than
two hundred votes. By his own
logic, I would certainly hope that
we never have to hear from either
of them again in electoral politics.
The issues raised by Mr.
Hocker about the Day Care fee
assessment are ones that should be
addressed. Mr. Hocker,
unfortunately, does so in a way

which is entirely self-serving and
non-informative.
First, he states that the
percentage of students with
children who need the center is
"tiny if not non-existent." This is
patently false as I feel Mr. Hocker
must realize. Taking a quick tour
around Escondido Village should
be enough to convince one of
that. If such direct observation is
not enough, one should check the
number of requests for places at
the Day Care Center by students
which could not be
accommodated because of lack of
space. The fact is that students
need this center very much. The
reason that the center is now
unable to serve all the students
who need the service is because
they must pay their bills out of
fees. Therefore, approximately
half the children must pay full
scale fees in order for the center
to survive. Contrary to what Mr.
Hocker may believe, most
Stanford graduate or
undergraduate parents are not
wealthy enough to afford full
scale. So faculty children are
placed because they can afford to
pay-
Mr. Hocker also sites the
number of Day Care centers in
operation from San Mateo to
Mountain View. What he is saying,
in effect, is that if you are a
student at Stanford, you should
truck your kid to San Mateo
before class. Great idea! He goes
on to modify, this by saying that
there are 17 centers (there are
really only 10) in Palo Alto.
Inconvenience and cost would
prevent most students from using
these other facilities.

I cannot help but wonder how
much Mr. Hocker's concern is
really "coercive taxing" and how
much is sexist bais. He apparently
wants to make it as difficult as
possible for women who are
students and have children to
continue their education. The idea
of not paying just because you do
not directly use the service at this
point in time is ridiculous.
Following that line of reasoning,
those of us who don't have school
age children would refuse to pay
property tax, and those of us who
are still young would withhold the
portion of our taxes which goes to
social security.
I don't think that any of us
would ever attribute a soft spot in
the heart to Chris Hocker. On the
basis of his arguments, a soft spot
in the head may be more
appropriate.
