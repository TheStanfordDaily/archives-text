shockley four

We are presently charged before
the Campus Judicial Panel for
"preventing the effective carrying
out of an examination" in Prof.
William Shockley's class. We
would like to lay out some of the
reasons why we feel that Prof.
Shockley must be opposed.
First, our primary concern is
not that Shockley thinks black
people are of sub-intelligence. We
expect that if you took a poll of
the honest opinions of most of
the white faculty at Stanford you
would find that Shockley's views
are not so odd.
There are basically two issues
involved. The first is that Stanford
is a white supremacist institution.
We do not attack its subjective
racism or we would find ourselves
attacking the majority of white
people in this country.
Racism is the subjective
attitudes which legitimize the
objective conditions of oppression
of Third World people, and makes
the supremacy of whites seem
natural. So objectively, we must
look at who teaches here, who
goes to school here, and what
Stanford's relationship to the
Third World peoples both here
and around the world consists of.
Aids Status Quo
Secondly, putting aside
Shockley's subjective feelings, we
attack him because he is directly
aiding the white supremacist
status quo, and more importantly,
advocating genocide. Given the
history of Third World,
particularly black people in this
country, we must conclude that
Shockley is urging and inciting
genocide where there is a "clear
and present danger" of his ideas
being put into practice.
In fact, compulsory
sterilization laws for welfare
women have already been
introduced in some states.
Shockley masks his racism in
pseudo-scientific terms so that it
can rationalize the implementation
of oppression and genocide.
None of us are black, this is
true. And in fact two of us are
white. So why do we put
ourselves on the line opposing
Shockley? The four of us are
committed to opposing U.S.
Imperialism on all fronts.
When we say "Stanford Out of
the War" we do not confine
ourselves to the war against
Southeast Asia, or even the other
underdeveloped nations
throughout the world which U.S.
corporations control. We believe,
that the primary contradiction in
the world today is between

Imperialism and oppressed
nations.
Black people in this country
constitute an oppressed nation. It
is they who realize first that the
present state benefits only a few
by exploiting the majority. It is
they who see revolution not only
as the means to a better society,
but also as the only chance for
survival.
Shockley is part of the war
against the Black nation. Because
black people are resisting the
most, white professors and
senators must find "scientific"
means of making genocide legal to
protect their own positions. So
when we say "Stanford Out of the
War", we include Shockley in that
war.
Shockley's rationale can be
used by a narrow white elite
against any Third World people.
In the context of American
history and foreign policy, this is
clearly recognized by the two
Asian defendants.
The Japanese were interred
during WWII because "Once a Jap,
always a Jap." Chinese and
Philipinos were (and are) paid less,
because "they can live on less".
And now Indochinese are being
killed as "gooks" who "do not
value human life as Westerners
do".
Successful Orientals
Although Shockley loudly
states that Orientals are more
successful, to demonstrate he's
not a white supremacist, this is
only a ploy.
First of all, by implying that
Orientals are smarter, Shockley is
attempting to cloud his white
supremacy, when in fact Asian
people have been consistently
oppressed in this country and the
rest of the world by people who
think like Shockley.
And further, Shockley seeks to
destroy Third World unity by the
divine tactic of appealing to racial
chauvinism. This is not only
tokenism, but also the familiar
strategy of divide and rule.
Three of us are members of the
Venceremos organization. Our
Central Committee is three
quarters Third World and we have
many black and brown
An attack on our Third World
comrades and on their peoples is
an attack on us as weU.
Our hearings are presently
scheduled to begin on Monday,
Washington's Birthday, at 8:30
a.m. in Geology 320. We urge
everyone to come and check out
the issues involved.

We are presently charged before
the Campus Judicial Panel for
"preventing the effective carrying
out of an examination" in Prof.
William Shockley's class. We
would like to lay out some of the
reasons why we feel that Prof.
Shockley must be opposed.
First, our primary concern is
not that Shockley thinks black
people are of sub-intelligence. We
expect that if you took a poll of
the honest opinions of most of
the white faculty at Stanford you
would find that Shockley's views
are not so odd.
There are basically two issues
involved. The first is that Stanford
is a white supremacist institution.
We do not attack its subjective
racism or we would find ourselves
attacking the majority of white
people in this country.
Racism is the subjective
attitudes which legitimize the
objective conditions of oppression
of Third World people, and makes
the supremacy of whites seem
natural. So objectively, we must
look at who teaches here, who
goes to school here, and what
Stanford's relationship to the
Third World peoples both here
and around the world consists of.
Aids Status Quo
Secondly, putting aside
Shockley's subjective feelings, we
attack him because he is directly
aiding the white supremacist
status quo, and more importantly,
advocating genocide. Given the
history of Third World,
particularly black people in this
country, we must conclude that
Shockley is urging and inciting
genocide where there is a "clear
and present danger" of his ideas
being put into practice.
In fact, compulsory
sterilization laws for welfare
women have already been
introduced in some states.
Shockley masks his racism in
pseudo-scientific terms so that it
can rationalize the implementation
of oppression and genocide.
None of us are black, this is
true. And in fact two of us are
white. So why do we put
ourselves on the line opposing
Shockley? The four of us are
committed to opposing U.S.
Imperialism on all fronts.
When we say "Stanford Out of
the War" we do not confine
ourselves to the war against
Southeast Asia, or even the other
underdeveloped nations
throughout the world which U.S.
corporations control. We believe,
that the primary contradiction in
the world today is between

Imperialism and oppressed
nations.
Black people in this country
constitute an oppressed nation. It
is they who realize first that the
present state benefits only a few
by exploiting the majority. It is
they who see revolution not only
as the means to a better society,
but also as the only chance for
survival.
Shockley is part of the war
against the Black nation. Because
black people are resisting the
most, white professors and
senators must find "scientific"
means of making genocide legal to
protect their own positions. So
when we say "Stanford Out of the
War", we include Shockley in that
war.
Shockley's rationale can be
used by a narrow white elite
against any Third World people.
In the context of American
history and foreign policy, this is
clearly recognized by the two
Asian defendants.
The Japanese were interred
during WWII because "Once a Jap,
always a Jap." Chinese and
Philipinos were (and are) paid less,
because "they can live on less".
And now Indochinese are being
killed as "gooks" who "do not
value human life as Westerners
do".
Successful Orientals
Although Shockley loudly
states that Orientals are more
successful, to demonstrate he's
not a white supremacist, this is
only a ploy.
First of all, by implying that
Orientals are smarter, Shockley is
attempting to cloud his white
supremacy, when in fact Asian
people have been consistently
oppressed in this country and the
rest of the world by people who
think like Shockley.
And further, Shockley seeks to
destroy Third World unity by the
divine tactic of appealing to racial
chauvinism. This is not only
tokenism, but also the familiar
strategy of divide and rule.
Three of us are members of the
Venceremos organization. Our
Central Committee is three
quarters Third World and we have
many black and brown
An attack on our Third World
comrades and on their peoples is
an attack on us as weU.
Our hearings are presently
scheduled to begin on Monday,
Washington's Birthday, at 8:30
a.m. in Geology 320. We urge
everyone to come and check out
the issues involved.
