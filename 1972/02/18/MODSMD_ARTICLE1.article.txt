# Legal Inquiry Prompts Campus Police Changes
## 
### 
The Stanford Police Department
yesterday changed the emergency
lights on its cars from red to amber,
and removed the word "police" from
its badges, shoulder patches, and cars.
The University made the equipment
changes after learning that the Daily
was investigating the legal status of
Stanford's emergency vehicles and
"police" officers.
Stanford changed the equipment
and the "police" designation "to clear
up any misunderstanding," James
Siena, Legal Adviser to the President,
said yesterday.
Stanford, however, has not
necessarily violated the California
Vehicle Code by using red lights and
sirens on its police vehicles, he
iasisted.
Before making the changes,
Stanford officials consulted
Lieutenant Don Tamm of the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Office and
Assistant District Attorney Craig
Brown.
According to Tamm, "as soon as
the matter was called to our attention
[by the Daily], we notified Stanford,
and were informed that the matter
would be taken care of."
Reduced Powers
Stanford officers at present have no
more power than a Wells Fargo
security guard or a private citizen, but
Administration officials have been
negotiating with the Sheriff's Office in
an attempt to obtain peace officer
status.
The last meeting with Sheriffs
Office representatives, however, was
held "two or three months ago,"
according to Stanford police chief
Marvin Herrington. No new meetings
are presently scheduled.
Because of the ambivalent status of
his department, Herrington has not
hired new officers during the past six
months, relying instead on Wells Fargo
security guards.
Stanford last year supported a bill
in the State Legislature which would
have enpowered the University to train
its officers to state standards and to
delegate complete peace officer
powers to them.

Santa Clara County Sheriff James
Geary opposed the bill, which failed.
Geary appears unwilling to allow
Stanford to retain operational control
of peace officers, and has refused to
swear Stanford officers in as reserve
Sheriffs deputies, an arrangement
which would provide them with peace
officer powers while on duty.
Contract Favored
He favors instead a contract
arrangement, in which Stanford would
pay the Sheriff's Office for law
enforcement services on campus, but
the Sheriff would retain control of all
peace officers.

QUICK CHANGE ARTIST?-On
Wednesday, the word "Police" was
painted in the blank space above
"Stanford Junior" on the doors of
police cars. Officials removed the word
when the Daily discovered that, under
the Penal Code, it was being used
improperly.
A peace officer may make an arrest
with less cause than a citizen, demand
identification, question a suspect, and
search a person, building, or other
area.
At a Faculty Senate meeting
yesterday, President Richard Lyman
commented on the status of the
Stanford police, saying "the lack of
our own police force trained for and
attuned to University problems is in
the long run intolerable."
In an interview yesterday,
Herrington recognized the same
problem, observing that morale within
the department is already "very low

because of the ambiguity of the men's
position." He believes that morale will
not deteriorate further because of
changes in equipment and name.
When asked what other changes
were contemplated, he responded:
"We're going to change whatever we
have to change to comply with the
technicalities of the law."
Permit Required
In the course of its investigation,
the Daily learned that the California
Vehicle Code requires any vehicle with
red lights and a siren to have a permit
as an Authorized Emergency Vehicle.
According to both Herrington and
James Arquette of the California
Highway Patrol office in Sacramento,
Stanford does not hold permits for its
vehicles.
Stanford apparently had violated
Vehicle Code provisions for years
before the Daily discovered code
sections 30, 165, 2416, 21055, 25250,
and 27002. According to Herrington
and Siena, Stanford has not removed
sirens from its vehicles, but instead has
cut the wiring leading to them.
Because they no longer have red
emergency lights and sirens, Stanford
police cars will not respond "Code 3"
(with red lights and siren) to fire
alarms, crime reports, and the like,
Herrington said.
He added, though, that "other
effects on the activities of the
department are very minor."
'Police' Removed
The Stanford "police" department
will change its name because the word
"police" can be used only to designate
an organization of sworn peace
officers, under section 146 c of the
Penal Code. The law provides
misdemeanor penalties for violators.
Stanford officers also appear to
have frequently violated section 146 a
of the Penal Code, which states: "Any
person who falsely represents himself
to be a public officer. .. and in such
assumed character arrests or detains or
threatens to arrest or detain, or
intimidates any person ... shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor." The
law provdes a maximum $1000 fine
and/or a year in jail as penalties.
