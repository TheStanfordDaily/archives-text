"Winola Nkwasi"
Editor, THE DAILY:
On February 3 you published a
scurrilous letter about me. The
author was "Winola Nkwasi,
visiting scholar". One hopes that
"Winola" will make the visit brief.
One knows, from the letter, that
"Winola" is not a scholar. One
suspects that "Winola" does not
exist, since there is no trace of the
person in the offices of the
registrar, the graduate division and
foreign visitors. It disappoints me
a bit that your staff did not
confirm the signature before you
published the letter nor assist me
in the later search for the author.
The letter alleged that I have
been "adviser to the repressive
governments of several U.S.
colonies in Asia and Latin
America". That is false. The letter
alleged that my advice to the
government of Ghana was rejected
"as being definitely in favor of
international capital and against
the masses of the country". That
is false. The letter alleged that
Ghanian officials had to get rid
of me. That is false. Three strikes
on "Winola"!
When "Winola's" next letter
arrives, give no less space to an
editorial on the Dornbusch bomb.
E.S. Shaw
Professor, Economics
Editor's Note: The Daily also has
been unable to find a "Winola
Nkwasi, visiting scholar"
anywhere at Stanford. The Daily
has no knowledge that he does
exist. If he does, we would ask
him to come forward and identify
himself to us.
In direct contradiction to the
Nkwasi letter an Emmerich M.
Schebeck of the International
Bank for Reconstruction and
Development said in a recent
phone conversation that the
Nkwasi letter was a "Complete
misrepresen ta tion'' of Shaw s
work in Ghana. On the contrary,
Schebeck said, the work Shaw did
"was certainly appreciated—not
only by the Ghanian officials but
also by the people."
The Daily apologizes to Prof.
Shaw for any problems the
Nkwasi letter might have caused.
Threat to Education
Editor, THE DAILY:
One does not have to subscribe
to Professor Shockley's views to
recognize that one's own freedom
is threatened by the recent
disruptions of his quantum
mechanics class. Apparently there
are some among us who, ignorant
of the painful history that led to

the traditions of academic
freedom, believe that the effective
action toward one holding
unpopular views is to silence him.
Apparently he must be silenced
whether he is expounding his
unpopular views or whether he is
teaching physics. These are the
tactics of the arrogant Nazi
bullyboys of the thirties. In my
view, they pose a great threat to
education and I am appalled and
saddened to mark the silence of
the AAUP and the ACLU on this
issue.
After the disruptions, I got in
touch with Professor Shockley to
determine whether in his view
anything more could be done to
avoid such episodes in the future.
At that time he asked me whether
I would be willing to grade his
midquarter exam so that there
could be no possible question of
bias raised concerning a member
of his class. I agreed and
subsequently did so. At no time
was there an "emotional
reaction—magnified to the point
that Shockley felt unable to
evaluate any member of the class,
"as charged in the February 14th
Daily story. Although I do not
know Professor Shockley well, I
do know him well enough to
recognize how out of character
such a statement would be.

Daily Editorial
Editor's Reply:
A letter by Herb Borock, Bill
Evers, and Tina Swent that
appeared in yesterday's Daily is
filled with inaccuracies, malicious
insinuations and outright lies.
The three signers of the letter,
none in attendance at the Daily
Editorial Board meeting in
question, were wrong in their
statement that the Board
members "noted that coming out
against fee assessments would not
be in the Daily's interest."
At the meeting referred to in
the letter, one member of the
Board introduced the argument
that any fee assessment under any
circumstances is immoral and
improper since it forces students
to contribute for something they
do not necessarily benefit from.
The entire board rejected this
extreme argument, citing the
precedent of our support for fee
assessments in the past — when
they deserved support.
Not surprisingly, we have
supported our own fee
assessments. We can recall four
other fee assessments we
supported because we thought
they served students. But we also
remember another which we
opposed because it was for a
poorly-planned program.
After rejecting a total ban on
fee assessments, the Board went
on to consider a number of

arguments — both for and against
the assessment.
Yesterday's letter implied that
the Daily conspired to support the
assessment because opposing it
would weaken our own political
interests. Such implausible
Machiavellian tactics were not
even mentioned by any member
of the Board. The Daily supports
the Children's Center fee
assessment on its merits as a
necessary community service —
not because it is somehow
politically expedient.
The Daily is currently negotiating
with the University
Administration over what form
the Daily independence should
take and when the process will
happen. Note that the question is
not if, but when. The Daily has
committed itself to total financial
and legal independence from the
University and we intend to
achieve that as soon as possible.
The University has not ceased
its calls for Daily independence
and in fact, is extremely impatient
because the issue has not been
fully resolved yet.
The Daily will probably again
ask for a fee assessment from
students to pay for the Daily next
year. Although the amount has
not yet been finally determined, it
will not be larger as one part of
yesterday's letter insinuated. The
amount, in fact, will be less than
the current year's assessment.

Threat to Education
Editor, THE DAILY:
One does not have to subscribe
to Professor Shockley's views to
recognize that one's own freedom
is threatened by the recent
disruptions of his quantum
mechanics class. Apparently there
are some among us who, ignorant
of the painful history that led to

the traditions of academic
freedom, believe that the effective
action toward one holding
unpopular views is to silence him.
Apparently he must be silenced
whether he is expounding his
unpopular views or whether he is
teaching physics. These are the
tactics of the arrogant Nazi
bullyboys of the thirties. In my
view, they pose a great threat to
education and I am appalled and
saddened to mark the silence of
the AAUP and the ACLU on this
issue.
After the disruptions, I got in
touch with Professor Shockley to
determine whether in his view
anything more could be done to
avoid such episodes in the future.
At that time he asked me whether
I would be willing to grade his
midquarter exam so that there
could be no possible question of
bias raised concerning a member
of his class. I agreed and
subsequently did so. At no time
was there an "emotional
reaction—magnified to the point
that Shockley felt unable to
evaluate any member of the class,
"as charged in the February 14th
Daily story. Although I do not
know Professor Shockley well, I
do know him well enough to
recognize how out of character
such a statement would be.

Daily Editorial
Editor's Reply:
A letter by Herb Borock, Bill
Evers, and Tina Swent that
appeared in yesterday's Daily is
filled with inaccuracies, malicious
insinuations and outright lies.
The three signers of the letter,
none in attendance at the Daily
Editorial Board meeting in
question, were wrong in their
statement that the Board
members "noted that coming out
against fee assessments would not
be in the Daily's interest."
At the meeting referred to in
the letter, one member of the
Board introduced the argument
that any fee assessment under any
circumstances is immoral and
improper since it forces students
to contribute for something they
do not necessarily benefit from.
The entire board rejected this
extreme argument, citing the
precedent of our support for fee
assessments in the past — when
they deserved support.
Not surprisingly, we have
supported our own fee
assessments. We can recall four
other fee assessments we
supported because we thought
they served students. But we also
remember another which we
opposed because it was for a
poorly-planned program.
After rejecting a total ban on
fee assessments, the Board went
on to consider a number of

arguments — both for and against
the assessment.
Yesterday's letter implied that
the Daily conspired to support the
assessment because opposing it
would weaken our own political
interests. Such implausible
Machiavellian tactics were not
even mentioned by any member
of the Board. The Daily supports
the Children's Center fee
assessment on its merits as a
necessary community service —
not because it is somehow
politically expedient.
The Daily is currently negotiating
with the University
Administration over what form
the Daily independence should
take and when the process will
happen. Note that the question is
not if, but when. The Daily has
committed itself to total financial
and legal independence from the
University and we intend to
achieve that as soon as possible.
The University has not ceased
its calls for Daily independence
and in fact, is extremely impatient
because the issue has not been
fully resolved yet.
The Daily will probably again
ask for a fee assessment from
students to pay for the Daily next
year. Although the amount has
not yet been finally determined, it
will not be larger as one part of
yesterday's letter insinuated. The
amount, in fact, will be less than
the current year's assessment.

"Winola Nkwasi"
Editor, THE DAILY:
On February 3 you published a
scurrilous letter about me. The
author was "Winola Nkwasi,
visiting scholar". One hopes that
"Winola" will make the visit brief.
One knows, from the letter, that
"Winola" is not a scholar. One
suspects that "Winola" does not
exist, since there is no trace of the
person in the offices of the
registrar, the graduate division and
foreign visitors. It disappoints me
a bit that your staff did not
confirm the signature before you
published the letter nor assist me
in the later search for the author.
The letter alleged that I have
been "adviser to the repressive
governments of several U.S.
colonies in Asia and Latin
America". That is false. The letter
alleged that my advice to the
government of Ghana was rejected
"as being definitely in favor of
international capital and against
the masses of the country". That
is false. The letter alleged that
Ghanian officials had to get rid
of me. That is false. Three strikes

Daily Editorial
Editor's Reply:
A letter by Herb Borock, Bill
Evers, and Tina Swent that
appeared in yesterday's Daily is
filled with inaccuracies, malicious
insinuations and outright lies.
The three signers of the letter,
none in attendance at the Daily
Editorial Board meeting in
question, were wrong in their
statement that the Board
members "noted that coming out
against fee assessments would not
be in the Daily's interest."
At the meeting referred to in
the letter, one member of the
Board introduced the argument
that any fee assessment under any
circumstances is immoral and
improper since it forces students
to contribute for something they
do not necessarily benefit from.
The entire board rejected this
extreme argument, citing the
precedent of our support for fee
assessments in the past — when
they deserved support.
Not surprisingly, we have
supported our own fee
assessments. We can recall four
other fee assessments we
supported because we thought
they served students. But we also
remember another which we
opposed because it was for a
poorly-planned program.
After rejecting a total ban on
fee assessments, the Board went
on to consider a number of

arguments — both for and against
the assessment.
Yesterday's letter implied that
the Daily conspired to support the
assessment because opposing it
would weaken our own political
interests. Such implausible
Machiavellian tactics were not
even mentioned by any member
of the Board. The Daily supports
the Children's Center fee
assessment on its merits as a
necessary community service —
not because it is somehow
politically expedient.
The Daily is currently negotiating
with the University
Administration over what form
the Daily independence should
take and when the process will
happen. Note that the question is
not if, but when. The Daily has
committed itself to total financial
and legal independence from the
University and we intend to
achieve that as soon as possible.
The University has not ceased
its calls for Daily independence
and in fact, is extremely impatient
because the issue has not been
fully resolved yet.
The Daily will probably again
ask for a fee assessment from
students to pay for the Daily next
year. Although the amount has
not yet been finally determined, it
will not be larger as one part of
yesterday's letter insinuated. The
amount, in fact, will be less than
the current year's assessment.

"Winola Nkwasi"
Editor, THE DAILY:
On February 3 you published a
scurrilous letter about me. The
author was "Winola Nkwasi,
visiting scholar". One hopes that
"Winola" will make the visit brief.
One knows, from the letter, that
"Winola" is not a scholar. One
suspects that "Winola" does not
exist, since there is no trace of the
person in the offices of the
registrar, the graduate division and
foreign visitors. It disappoints me
a bit that your staff did not
confirm the signature before you
published the letter nor assist me
in the later search for the author.
The letter alleged that I have
been "adviser to the repressive
governments of several U.S.
colonies in Asia and Latin
America". That is false. The letter
alleged that my advice to the
government of Ghana was rejected
"as being definitely in favor of
international capital and against
the masses of the country". That
is false. The letter alleged that
Ghanian officials had to get rid
of me. That is false. Three strikes
on "Winola"!
When "Winola's" next letter
arrives, give no less space to an
editorial on the Dornbusch bomb.
E.S. Shaw
Professor, Economics
Editor's Note: The Daily also has
been unable to find a "Winola
Nkwasi, visiting scholar"
anywhere at Stanford. The Daily
has no knowledge that he does
exist. If he does, we would ask
him to come forward and identify
himself to us.
In direct contradiction to the
Nkwasi letter an Emmerich M.
Schebeck of the International
Bank for Reconstruction and
Development said in a recent
phone conversation that the
Nkwasi letter was a "Complete
misrepresen ta tion'' of Shaw s
work in Ghana. On the contrary,
Schebeck said, the work Shaw did
"was certainly appreciated—not
only by the Ghanian officials but
also by the people."
The Daily apologizes to Prof.
Shaw for any problems the
Nkwasi letter might have caused.
Threat to Education
Editor, THE DAILY:
One does not have to subscribe
to Professor Shockley's views to
recognize that one's own freedom
is threatened by the recent
disruptions of his quantum
mechanics class. Apparently there
are some among us who, ignorant
of the painful history that led to

the traditions of academic
freedom, believe that the effective
action toward one holding
unpopular views is to silence him.
Apparently he must be silenced
whether he is expounding his
unpopular views or whether he is
teaching physics. These are the
tactics of the arrogant Nazi
bullyboys of the thirties. In my
view, they pose a great threat to
education and I am appalled and
saddened to mark the silence of
the AAUP and the ACLU on this
issue.
After the disruptions, I got in
touch with Professor Shockley to
determine whether in his view
anything more could be done to
avoid such episodes in the future.
At that time he asked me whether
I would be willing to grade his
midquarter exam so that there
could be no possible question of
bias raised concerning a member
of his class. I agreed and
subsequently did so. At no time
was there an "emotional
reaction—magnified to the point
that Shockley felt unable to
evaluate any member of the class,
"as charged in the February 14th
Daily story. Although I do not
know Professor Shockley well, I
do know him well enough to
recognize how out of character
such a statement would be.
