## Biologist Questions Shockley's Genetics 
### 
Paul r. ehrlich

Mr. Roberts appears to think
that Professor Shockley threatens
the "environmentalists." Shockley
in fact threatens no one
conversant with the scientific
literature on race and intelligence.
Shockley is simply attempting
unsuccessfully to come to grips
with undergraduate genetics. All
competent geneticists are quite
happy to admit that there is a
substantial genetic component in
the ability of people to perform
on standard IQ tests. No
geneticist, to my knowledge,
thinks "all faults are due to
society." No competent geneticist
will tell you, however, that it is
possible to compare the
magnitude of the genetic
component in two different
groups living in different
environments, be they male and
female, Catholic and Protestant,
or dark-skinned and light-skinned.

It would be pointless to
reiterate in detail the many
distortions and technical flaws in
Professor Shockley's polemics. His
claim, for instance, that science
has avoided the question of race
and intelligence is just 180 degrees
off base. The original IQ testers
thought that innate ability was
precisely what they were testing.
Fifty years of research has shown
that original notion to be
erroneous.
But putting aside the
technicalities, which seem only to
confuse Professor Shockley and
his followers, anyone can see the
fundamental flaw in his argument.
Suppose that we had a magic
device which would automatically
give us a "genetic IQ" score for
any individual—that is, a rating of
his innate capacity for some kind
of "intelligence" which everyone
agreed upon (there is, of course,

no agreement on what
"intelligence" is today). That
device would permit us to do
what Shockley so craves—measure
the "genetic IQ" of a large
number of dark-skinned people
and light-skinned people and then
calculate an average for each
group. Then we could see which
group had the higher average.
But once you were able to
measure individual genetic
capacity (a prerequisite to getting
Shockley's answer) there would be
little point in comparing groups.
If we could measure the innate
capacity of individuals—then
individuals could be educated
•i ■ • —

according to their own innate
capacity. Since even Shockley
would agree that not every white
would have less capacity than
every black (or vice versa),
treating people educationally on
the basis of skin pigmentation
group, rather than known
individual ability, would be
patently ridiculous. An analogous
case would be to give Wasserman
tests ( a test of whether an
individual has or has not got
syphilis) to all faculty members in
the University. On discovering,
say, that 13 per cent of Full
Professors had syphilis while only
11 per cent of Assistant Professor

had syphilis, Professor Shockley
might then recommend treating
the entire group of Full Professors
with penicillin and letting the
Assistant Professors rot, rather
than treating individuals according
to whether or not they were
infected.
To make the point perfectly
clear to Mr. Roberts: In a sane
society people should be treated
according to their individual
capabilities and behavior, not
according to your preconceptions
about them based on arbitrary
classifications according to
skin-color, sex, blood group, or

what-have-you.
Since, unfortunately, our
society is not sane, I presumably
would be justified in considering
Mr. Roberts to be an arrogant,
stupid racist simply because he is
at the Hoover Institution. Since,
however, I know that there are
people at Hoover who are humble,
smart, and nonracist, I will not do
that. I will draw my conclusions
about him on the basis of his
individual capabilities as displayed
in his letter to the Daily.

number of dark-skinned people
and light-skinned people and then
calculate an average for each
group. Then we could see which
group had the higher average.
But once you were able to
measure individual genetic
capacity (a prerequisite to getting
Shockley's answer) there would be
little point in comparing groups.
If we could measure the innate
capacity of individuals—then
individuals could be educated
•i ■ • —

according to their own innate
capacity. Since even Shockley
would agree that not every white
would have less capacity than
every black (or vice versa),
treating people educationally on
the basis of skin pigmentation
group, rather than known
individual ability, would be
patently ridiculous. An analogous
case would be to give Wasserman
tests ( a test of whether an
individual has or has not got
syphilis) to all faculty members in
the University. On discovering,
say, that 13 per cent of Full
Professors had syphilis while only
11 per cent of Assistant Professor

had syphilis, Professor Shockley
might then recommend treating
the entire group of Full Professors
with penicillin and letting the
Assistant Professors rot, rather
than treating individuals according
to whether or not they were
infected.
To make the point perfectly
clear to Mr. Roberts: In a sane
society people should be treated
according to their individual
capabilities and behavior, not
according to your preconceptions
about them based on arbitrary
classifications according to
skin-color, sex, blood group, or

what-have-you.
Since, unfortunately, our
society is not sane, I presumably
would be justified in considering
Mr. Roberts to be an arrogant,
stupid racist simply because he is
at the Hoover Institution. Since,
however, I know that there are
people at Hoover who are humble,
smart, and nonracist, I will not do
that. I will draw my conclusions
about him on the basis of his
individual capabilities as displayed
in his letter to the Daily.

Mr. Roberts appears to think
that Professor Shockley threatens
the "environmentalists." Shockley
in fact threatens no one
conversant with the scientific
literature on race and intelligence.
Shockley is simply attempting
unsuccessfully to come to grips
with undergraduate genetics. All
competent geneticists are quite
happy to admit that there is a
substantial genetic component in
the ability of people to perform
on standard IQ tests. No
geneticist, to my knowledge,
thinks "all faults are due to
society." No competent geneticist
will tell you, however, that it is
possible to compare the
magnitude of the genetic
component in two different
groups living in different
environments, be they male and
female, Catholic and Protestant,
or dark-skinned and light-skinned.

It would be pointless to
reiterate in detail the many
distortions and technical flaws in
Professor Shockley's polemics. His
claim, for instance, that science
has avoided the question of race
and intelligence is just 180 degrees
off base. The original IQ testers
thought that innate ability was
precisely what they were testing.
Fifty years of research has shown
that original notion to be
erroneous.
But putting aside the
technicalities, which seem only to
confuse Professor Shockley and
his followers, anyone can see the
fundamental flaw in his argument.
Suppose that we had a magic
device which would automatically
give us a "genetic IQ" score for
any individual—that is, a rating of
his innate capacity for some kind
of "intelligence" which everyone
agreed upon (there is, of course,

no agreement on what
"intelligence" is today). That
device would permit us to do
what Shockley so craves—measure
the "genetic IQ" of a large
number of dark-skinned people
and light-skinned people and then
calculate an average for each
group. Then we could see which
group had the higher average.
