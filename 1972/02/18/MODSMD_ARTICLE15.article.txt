# Regent Elitism Admitted

SACRAMENTO (AP) -
University of California President
Charles Hitch acknowledged
Wednesday that the UC Board of
Regents is an elite group and not
fairly representative of California
society.
He proposed to legislators that
a blue ribbon commission be
established to screen prospective
nominees for presentation to the
governor, who makes the ultimate
selection.
Hitch suggested that the chief
justice of the State Supreme
Court, or someone designated by
him, head such a commission.
Students and professors should
be excluded from the Board of
Regents, Hitch stated, because
they are too involved in the issues
that come before it.
He did not rule out their
participation in the commission
called to nominate regents,
however.
His proposal came in a
90-minute presentation to a joint
Senate-Assembly committee that

is reviewing the state's higher
education master plan.
Generally, Hitch said he would
make no major changes in the
current method of governing
higher education in California,
particularly the autonomy UC
enjoys under the State
Constitution.
Hitch also proposed that the
number of appointed regents be
increased from 18 to 19, adding
one additional member
representing the alumni.
The discussion began when the
committee chairman,
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos,
D—San Jose, challenged a
statement by Hitch that the
regents, appointed by the
governor to 16-year terms, are
responsive to the public.
"I find it hard to see that the
regents are responsible to
anyone," Tasconcellos said. He
added there are no blacks, no
Mexican-Americans, few women,
no young people and no poor
people on the board.
"Is that a responsible body?"

he asked Hitch.
The president replied, "That is
a very serious question ... I
would say it's not a fairly
representative board."
Sen. Alfred Alquist, D—San
Jose, commented, "You donate a
million bucks, or two million
bucks, to the university and you
get appointed to the board."
Hitch smiled and replied, "1
can think of worse qualifications
than giving $2 million to the
university."
Coincidentally Tuesday,
Assemblyman Dixon Arnett,
R—Redwood City, introduced a
bill to create such a
regent-nominating commission as
Hitch proposed. The commission
also would nominate candidates
for appointment to the State
College Board of Trustees.
Members would include the
speaker of the Assembly,
president pro tem of the Senate,
the state chief justice, the
chairman of the trustees or
regents and representatives of
faculty and student bodies.
