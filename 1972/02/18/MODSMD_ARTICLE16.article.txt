# CSEA Wont Debate With Teamsters, USE
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
United Stanford Employees,
one of the three unions seeking
the approval of University
workers as a collective bargaining
agent, will hold an open meeting
sometime next week for the
purpose of taking a stand on the
issue of open and closed shops.
USE President Jim Berk said
that he has received a number of
questions from workers about
where the organization stands on
making union membership
compulsory, but "our officers
can't speak because our
membership has never taken a
position on it."
The meeting will be open to
the general public, but it will be a
general business meeting and only
USE members will be permitted
to take part in voting.
The Teamsters, another union
running in the March 7 election,
has advocated a closed shop;
California School of

Employees-Association Stanford
Employees Association
(CSEA-SEA) has more or less
opposed it.
Meanwhile, a very large
camper-bus has been touring the
campus for the last two days,
dispensing coffee, donuts, and
Teamster literature. The bus is the
brainchild of the Stanford
Teamster Organizing Committee,
and it will be on campus every
day until election time, when it
will be used to take employees to
the polls to vote.
CSEA-SEA is continuing with a
low-key campaign after an
attempted mass meeting last
Thursday drew only 30 people
and ended in a shouting match
between members of the three
unions.
CSEA-SEA has refused to
debate the other two unions,
engaging primarily in worker to
worker contacts and a large
mailing drive.


NO DEBATE—The United Stanford Employees and the Teamsters
informally challenged the California School Employees Association to
a debate which the CSEA refused.
