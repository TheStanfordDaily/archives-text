# Republican President Visits Red China
## 
### BOB BACON 
Today Richard M. Nixon,
Republican President of the
United States, is on his way to the
People's Republic of (Communist)
China.
What motivated this one-time
member of the House
Un-American Activities
Committee to visit the nation
whose policies he considers
anathema?
And on the other side, what
prompted the leaders who
continually denounce "American
imperialists" to invite Nixon to
Peking?
Aware of the pitfalls inherent
in attempting to read men's (and
nation's) minds, and warned that
"no one in the United States
should consider himself an expert
on China," the Daily consulted a
number of Stanford's leading
China-watchers in an attempt to
shed some light on these
questions.
The four scholars the Daily
questioned were unanimous in
their expectation that nothing
that happens during the visit will
overshadow the fact that the trip
is taking place. "The principal
accomplishment of the trip is that
it's happening at all," said Lyman
Van Slyke, Director of the
Stanford Center for East Asian
Studies.
Major Agreements Unlikely
"I'll be surprised if there are
any major agreements," he
continued. "If people think there
will be quick changes in the world
situation, they will be
disappointed. But I'm sure that
substantive matters will be
discussed."
"They aren't meeting to settle
the Vietnam War," said
Economics Professor John Gurley.
"If there are implications for the
Vietnam War, they will be
long-run implications."
"It's an opening, a remarkable
first step for countries that have
had no relations," according to
Mark Mancall, Associate Professor
of History. "Much of the
negotiation has already taken
place. They've probably already
written the official communique
to satisfy both sides," he said.
The joint statement last July
announcing the plans for the trip
said that "The meeting... is to
seek the normalization of

relations between the two
countries and also to exchange
views on questions of concern to
the two sides."
Communication
What does "normalization of
relations" mean in the years
ahead? Principally communication
and trade, barring another
upheaval such as the "Cultural
Revolution." Van Slyke and
Mancall pointed out that one
concrete step that may come from
the visit is the establishment of a
permanent communication link
between the new nations, perhaps
at the United Nations.
The exchange of scholarly
information and groups of
academics is also seen in the
offing.
This week trade restrictions
with China were eased by the U.S.
government, and a gradual
increase in trade is forecast. "That
will be a slow process," said
Charles Ridley, graduate student
in Asian Languages and former
Hoover Institution researcher.
"China doesn't need much of
what we make, and they don't
have much to offer us. There will
be more trade as China becomes
more industrialized."
Mancall predicted that
eventually U.S.-Chinese relations
would be similar to U.S.-Russian
relations. Full diplomatic
recognition with exchange of
ambassadors must wait for
resolution of the Taiwan question,
according to Chinese leaders, but
Mancall noted that "formal
diplomatic recognition is trivial in
the final analysis. We've actually
recognized one another by the
fact that Nixon and their
government leaders will meet one
another."
If nothing earthshaking is
expected to come out of the visit,
why is Nixon going?
Prestige
"Nixon's personal and
historical prestige," Mancall
replied. "Nixon wants many
things, including (1) to go down
in history as an international
statesman, (2) to get re-elected
and (3) to have the Chinese put
pressure on Hanoi to end the
Vietnam War." Van Slyke's
analysis was similar.
Gurley stated that the United
States is seeking "to establish a
less costly and more profitable

area in Asia for trade, investment,
and natural resource exploitation
by U.S. corporations," and to do
this the Nixon Administration is
seeking an "understanding" with
China to permit the neutralization
of Southeast Asia, free of Russian
or Chinese economic or military
control.
American domestic politics, he
said, is not as important a factor
in the modification of the China
policy as is the American
economic position in Asia.
Big-Power Politics
All four cited the pragmatics
of big-power politics as among
China's motiviations in welcoming
Nixon. China's enmity to Japan
and Russia is centuries old. China
views with alarm the growing
economic and potential military
power of Japan and the increased
ties between those two powers.
China is apparently seeking
detente with the United States in
an attempt to balance the
situation and enable itself to
concentrate on the perceived
Russian and Japanese threats.
U.S.-Russian rapproachment is
another fear of the Chinese, and
the improvement of relations with
the United States will also serve to
protect China from any dealing
between those two giants, such as
the Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks.
Ridley cited an "old Chinese
diplomatic philosophy, 'We use
barbarians to control
barbarians,' " and suggested that
China was not adverse to
protecting herself by having the
major powers squabbling amongst
one another.
Gurley stated that "China's
main objective is to weaken the
U.S., Japan, and the USSR as
imperialist powers in Asia. In
pursuit of this goal, China is not
abandoning her revolutionary
stand, but is using both diplomacy
and revoltuion to achieve it."
Subordination
He also said that the
"neutralization" of Southewast
Asia which he described as being
to the United States' advantage is
also advantageous to the Chinese
by making the Indochinese
nations "less inclined to
subordinate themselves to the
capitalist powers or to the Soviet
Union."
Ridley and Van Slyke both

pointed out that the Chinese are
undoubtedly more amenable to
the visit since Nixon is visiting
their country, rather than their
leaders traveling to Washington.
Peking is receiving an important
psychological boost in this
acknowledgment of their major
world status, and the affair is
reminiscent of the paying of
tribute by foreign government to
Imperial China in centuries past.
In addition, according to
Mancall, the Chinese want to see
Nixon re-elected. "Like the Soviet
Union, they prefer Republican
presidents. Republicans are more
flexible since they don't have to
fear being accused of being soft
on Communism. No Democrat
could do what Nixon is doing," he
explained.
Internal Politics
Ridley noted that Chinese
internal politics are also involved.
"It appears that Premier Chou
En-lai has come out of the
Cultural Revolution as a
conciliator. More doctrinaire

leaders on both sides appear to
have been put aside."
The western-educated Chou, he
said, is more concerned with
international relations than are
the original revolutionaries such as
Mao Tse-tung, who are
preoccupied with making internal
changes in China.
Neither country is about to
significantly alter its ideology. But
both giants of the Pacific see
"normalization of relations" and
the opening of channels of
communication as being to their
advantage.
As Chairman Mao says,
"strategically we should despise
all our enemies, but technically
we should take them all
seriously." Both countries
appear to be doing that in
preparing to meet for the first
time on the summit level.
