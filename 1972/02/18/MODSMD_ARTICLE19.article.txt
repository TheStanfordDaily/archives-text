# Conductor Kertesz Sparks Symphony
## 
### DAVID W. WILLIAMS 
Istvan Kertesz was not a name
I knew until I heard his recording
of Mozart's "La Clamenza di
Tito," and had to admit that he
was one of the greatest living
conductors. Kertesz is a careful
scholar, sensitive both to the text
and the immediate problems of
performance. All three works on
Wednesday's San Francisco
Symphony program were
testaments to his exceptionally
good taste and musicianship,
causing the audience no exertion
except that of vigorous applause.
The Haydn "Symphony No.
67" is a work accorded the
respect of a major work, but
which is seldom played (there is as
yet only one generally available
recording). But the more one
listens to this work in F major,
the more one is convinced that it
is more of a masterpiece than
either the more popular
symphonies in B flat that precede
and follow it.
Both his "Symphony No. 66"
and "Symphony No. 68" look
forward to his last twenty five
masterpieces it is true, but more
crucially they represent the more
conventional side of Haydn's
genius, endlessly joyful and
amused. The "Symphony No. 67"
recalls, at least in the first
movement, the period of the
sturm and drang, but the mood is
hardly that of the tragic No. 26 or
No. 39, but is rather the agitation
and exploration that characterizes
the opening movements of the
famous "Farewell," and "La
Passione" symphonies.
Elegant Adagio
The elegant adagio recalls the
world of the Eszterhaza musicals
though the writing is more learned
than that, more complex in every
way. The last two movements
contain elaborate concertante
passages, a trio for two solo
violins in the minuet and a slow
movement (adagio e cantabile for
two violins and cello) like that of
the last movement of the Mozart
"Violin Concerto No. 5", in the
finale, all of which was admirably
played by Stuart Canin and his
colleagues. In general the
orchestra seemed to grasp every
subtlety, and they and Kertesz

managed to produce a rich yet
controlled sound that made what
too many commentators refer to
as Haydn's weakest period appear
worthy of further investigation.
The Hindemith "Nobilissima
Visione," a work in three
movements designed as a ballet
based upon the life of Saint
Francis, written in collaboration
with choreographer Leonide
Massine and the set designer
Tchelichev, is really an extremely
beautiful tone poem rich with
material drawn largely from the
14th century composer Mauchaut.
The harmonies are rich and
surprisingly conventional, and the
moods that the music evokes are
of a decidedly romantic nature,
both complex and various.
Here Kertesz was at his best.
The music flowed with
uncommon grace, and the
orchestra was always "right on."
It was in the last movement, a
passicaglia, that one deeply
sensed the passionate side of
Hindemith's sensibility, too often
dismissed as the critics harp on
the twentieth-century German
composer's "classical" and
"neo-classical" qualities as the
epitome of the impersonal. The
passicaglia was so movingly
played, and so scrupulously
executed that all such criticism,
despite the fact that the very form
is an archaism, seemed much
beside the point.
Elegaic Quality
The Dvorak "Symphony No.
8" in G major has long been one
of my favorite symphonies. More
graceful than the justly popular
ninth, "from the New World," its
restrained elegaic quality as well
as its vigorous exploitation of
sonata form, closely resembles
both the fourth symphonies of
Brahms and Tchaikowsky.
The first two movements were
vigorously and delicately played,
if a trifle unexceptional over all.
The allegretto might have done
more rapidly, but still it was an
awfully delicious reading. Both
orchestra and conductor seemed
best in the great finale, and the
strings and brass appeared to be in
their element. Indeed no concert
could have ended on a more
perfect note.

uncommon grace, and the
orchestra was always "right on."
It was in the last movement, a
passicaglia, that one deeply
sensed the passionate side of
Hindemith's sensibility, too often
dismissed as the critics harp on
the twentieth-century German
composer's "classical" and
"neo-classical" qualities as the
epitome of the impersonal. The
passicaglia was so movingly
played, and so scrupulously
executed that all such criticism,
despite the fact that the very form
is an archaism, seemed much
beside the point.
Elegaic Quality
The Dvorak "Symphony No.
8" in G major has long been one
of my favorite symphonies. More
graceful than the justly popular
ninth, "from the New World," its
restrained elegaic quality as well
as its vigorous exploitation of
sonata form, closely resembles
both the fourth symphonies of
Brahms and Tchaikowsky.
The first two movements were
vigorously and delicately played,
if a trifle unexceptional over all.
The allegretto might have done
more rapidly, but still it was an
awfully delicious reading. Both
orchestra and conductor seemed
best in the great finale, and the
strings and brass appeared to be in
their element. Indeed no concert
could have ended on a more
perfect note.
Istvan Kertesz was not a name
I knew until I heard his recording
of Mozart's "La Clamenza di
Tito," and had to admit that he
was one of the greatest living
conductors. Kertesz is a careful
scholar, sensitive both to the text
and the immediate problems of
performance. All three works on
Wednesday's San Francisco
Symphony program were
testaments to his exceptionally
good taste and musicianship,
causing the audience no exertion
except that of vigorous applause.
The Haydn "Symphony No.
67" is a work accorded the
respect of a major work, but
which is seldom played (there is as
yet only one generally available
recording). But the more one
listens to this work in F major,
the more one is convinced that it
is more of a masterpiece than
either the more popular
symphonies in B flat that precede
and follow it.
Both his "Symphony No. 66"
and "Symphony No. 68" look
forward to his last twenty five
masterpieces it is true, but more
crucially they represent the more
conventional side of Haydn's
genius, endlessly joyful and
amused. The "Symphony No. 67"
recalls, at least in the first
movement, the period of the
sturm and drang, but the mood is
hardly that of the tragic No. 26 or
No. 39, but is rather the agitation
and exploration that characterizes
the opening movements of the
famous "Farewell," and "La
Passione" symphonies.
Elegant Adagio
The elegant adagio recalls the
world of the Eszterhaza musicals
though the writing is more learned
than that, more complex in every
way. The last two movements
contain elaborate concertante
passages, a trio for two solo
violins in the minuet and a slow
movement (adagio e cantabile for
two violins and cello) like that of
the last movement of the Mozart
"Violin Concerto No. 5", in the
finale, all of which was admirably
played by Stuart Canin and his
colleagues. In general the
orchestra seemed to grasp every
subtlety, and they and Kertesz

managed to produce a rich yet
controlled sound that made what
too many commentators refer to
as Haydn's weakest period appear
worthy of further investigation.
The Hindemith "Nobilissima
Visione," a work in three
movements designed as a ballet
based upon the life of Saint
Francis, written in collaboration
with choreographer Leonide
Massine and the set designer
Tchelichev, is really an extremely
beautiful tone poem rich with
material drawn largely from the
14th century composer Mauchaut.
The harmonies are rich and
surprisingly conventional, and the
moods that the music evokes are
of a decidedly romantic nature,
both complex and various.
Here Kertesz was at his best.
The music flowed with
uncommon grace, and the
orchestra was always "right on."
It was in the last movement, a
passicaglia, that one deeply
sensed the passionate side of
