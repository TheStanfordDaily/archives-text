The University spent more than
$180,000 on the hearings which
resulted in the ouster of Associate
English Professor H. Bruce Franklin,
administrators announced last night.
The figures for direct and indirect
costs of the dismissal process listed
almost $70,000 for the time spent by
seven professors on the faculty
Advisory Board. But the totals did not
consider hundreds of man-hours which
top administrators devoted to the case.
The totals included more than
$65,000 spent on lawyers for the
Administration and the Advisory
Board.
Administrators divided the costs
into three broad areas in a terse release
issued by the University's News
Service. The Daily learned of
additional details, which were

confirmed by Assistant Provost Alan
Grundmann. Grundmann handled
physical arrangements for the hearing
and compiled the total costs.
The first area in the official
announcement involved $83,800 "in
court reporting and legal fees." Court
reporters and preparation of a
transcript for the 33 hearing sessions
ran up an $18,000 bill. The Advisory
Board's lawyer, UC Law Professor Jan
Vetter, reportedly charged only token
fees because of his interest in the case.
Most of the $65,000 remaining in
this category apparently went to
attorney Raymond Fisher and the
team of Los Angeles lawyers which
represented the Administration.
(Franklin objected during the
hearings that the Administration and
the Advisory Board refused to pay his
legal expenses.)

A second category of $26,700
represented "direct costs" of the
hearing. Such costs included secretarial
services for the Board, duplicating
services, construction of the
courtroom, and a retired reporter
hired for the hearing by the University
News Service.
