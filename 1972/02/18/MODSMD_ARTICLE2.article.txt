# University Reveals Expenses Of Franklin Trial: $180,000

The University spent more than
$180,000 on the hearings which
resulted in the ouster of Associate
English Professor H. Bruce Franklin,
administrators announced last night.
The figures for direct and indirect
costs of the dismissal process listed
almost $70,000 for the time spent by
seven professors on the faculty
Advisory Board. But the totals did not
consider hundreds of man-hours which
top administrators devoted to the case.
The totals included more than
$65,000 spent on lawyers for the
Administration and the Advisory
Board.
Administrators divided the costs
into three broad areas in a terse release
issued by the University's News
Service. The Daily learned of
additional details, which were

confirmed by Assistant Provost Alan
Grundmann. Grundmann handled
physical arrangements for the hearing
and compiled the total costs.
The first area in the official
announcement involved $83,800 "in
court reporting and legal fees." Court
reporters and preparation of a
transcript for the 33 hearing sessions
ran up an $18,000 bill. The Advisory
Board's lawyer, UC Law Professor Jan
Vetter, reportedly charged only token
fees because of his interest in the case.
Most of the $65,000 remaining in
this category apparently went to
attorney Raymond Fisher and the
team of Los Angeles lawyers which
represented the Administration.
(Franklin objected during the
hearings that the Administration and
the Advisory Board refused to pay his
legal expenses.)

A second category of $26,700
represented "direct costs" of the
hearing. Such costs included secretarial
services for the Board, duplicating
services, construction of the
courtroom, and a retired reporter
hired for the hearing by the University
News Service.
Additional "direct costs" involved
bailiffs, closed-circuit television, and
noon lunches for Board members.
The third category reported
included $69,800 "in faculty time for
several months work by the Advisory
Board." Grundmann said Board
Chairman Donald Kennedy provided
estimates of the proportion of their
time which the professors spent on the
hearing and deliberations during each
month.
The professors worked on the case
during 80 percent of their time in
October and 70 percent in November
and December, Grundmann reported.
Grundmann explained he "just
looked up their salaries and
extrapolated" to determine the cost of
the Board members' time. He said the
method was the same as that used to
bill the government for professors'
time on research contracts.

He added he lumped the time he
spent arranging facilities into the
category for professors' costs.
Grundmann said his listing of
expenses did not include other
administrators involved in the Franklin
case because such projects are part of
their "normal employment. You can't
put such costs off on the Franklin
case; that's life now."
Presidential legal adviser James
Siena estimated that the Franklin case
became a "sporadic halftime" project
for him throughout the year between
initial charges against Franklin and his
dismissal.
But Siena agreed that
administrators' time should not be
considered a part of the costs for the
case: "While it's an extraordinary
event, it's within the responsibilities of
administrators."
