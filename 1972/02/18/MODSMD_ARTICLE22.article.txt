# 'Billy Jack'
## An Extremely Powerful Film 
### TODD McCARTHY 
When "Billy Jack" was quietly
released last summer, it was
casually overlooked by the
cosmopolitan opinion makers and
didn't last more than a couple of
weeks on both the East and West
Coasts. Warner Brothers, without
faith in the project from the
beginning, didn't promote the
film and was prepared to write it
off as another independently
produced flop.
However, star-director
co-author Tom Laughlin was not
about to see his baby sink into
obsucrity so easily, and he
pumped his own money into a
high-powered ad campaign in
Minneapolis and watched his film
build from a modest opening to a
record breaking, open-ended
engagement.
In a rare case of Middle
America vindicating itself, "Billy
Jack" caught on in the Midwest,
where there are few critics but
many potential patrons, and by
the end of the year had grossed
four million dollars, more than
such well known items as
"McCabe and Mrs. Miller," "The
Omega Man" and "Bananas."
It will undoubtedly make
considerably more as it returns to
areas where it was originally
ignored but even now Laughlin
isn't satisfied, as he is suing
Warners (in a rather complicated
case) for improper handling of his
film and has recently taken ads in
the trades to admonish the
industry and critics for not
considering his film seriously for
year-end honors.
The belated verdict is that
"Billy Jack" (currently at the
Paris) is a decidedly unusual and
honorable film which is not only
rather charming in its total lack of
sophistication and artistic

pretention but extremely
powerful on the basic gut
emotional level in a way that the
best social consciousness pictures
can be.
I generally avoid the
sociological approach in discussing
films since most works intended
primarily to be relevant are
preachy, limited in scope and are,
by and large, bad movies anyway.
However much I would like to
avoid making such a comment, it
seems to me that "Billy Jack"
genuinely and reasonably deals
with many issues that beset
people today, from ecology to
race to virginity to gun control to
the tough-guy mystique to the
usefulness of political prisoners.
Naturally, the plot is
constructed so that the
protagonists promote the correct
causes and the baddies are
reactionaries but "Billy Jack" is
by no means plagued by
optimistic simplification. Drastic
divisions and disagreements exist
within the ranks to the point
where Billy Jack, partisan to a
strongly pacific faction, cannot
conceive of giving up his gun
while a faceless hick cop actually
breaks rank to defend what he,
not the local authorities, believes
is right.
Briefly, the action takes place
in a small southwestern
community outside of which a

progressive educational center has
been instituted, which will accept
anyone, no questions asked, for as
long as he or she wants to stay
and participate. The influx and
intermingling of blacks, Indians,
Chicanos and freaks predictably
upsets the civic leaders and no
restraint is exercised in trying to
exterminate the new community.
However, the center is run by a
strong liberal in the best sense
(quietly but convincingly played
by Laughlin's wife Dolores
Taylor, who also co-wrote "Billy
Jack") and is protected by a
half-breed of mysterious
background and experience.
Billy Jack, an ex-GI who is also
indoctrinated into an obscure
Indian cult, has great difficulty
supressing his violent urges and
finally, in a scene of great
simplicity and equally great direct
emotional force, takes the most
difficult step of his life by
accepting another person's love
and submerging himself in the
cause. At film's end, Billy is both
a (political) prisoner and (we
understand) a national hero and I
have heard rumblings that a sequel
to "Billy Jack" is already in the
works.
Integrated into the cast (which
I assume is largely comprised of
non-professionals) are members of
San Francisco's The Committee,
whose creative contribution to the
school is, naturally enough,

practice in improvisational
theatre. They are also responsible
for the funniest scene in the
picture, in which a phony hold-up
is staged in town to the
consternation of the local police.
In "Billy Jack," we finally have
a populist film which deserves to
be popular.

After several re runs of the
Janus Film Festival, the new
Altura Festival at the Fine Arts
is a welcome change. The festival,
comprised of 20 films on
double-bills to be shown over five
weeks, offers a number of films
never seen outside the Surf
Theatre in San Francisco and
certainly never seen in Palo Alto.
Bunuel and Pasolini dominate
the festival and among the most
attractive programs are Max
Ophuls' resurrected last film
"Lola Montes" with Luchino
Visconti's "Senso," a Kurosawa
double bill of the fabulous
"Yojimbo" and the Japanese
version of "Macbeth," "Throne of
Blood," Rene Clair's innovative
early musicals "Le Million"and
"Under the Roofs of Paris" and
Rossellini's "The Rise of Louis
XIV" with Polanski's macabre
"Cul-de-Sac."
Don't miss Jean Cocteau's
extraordinary "Beauty and the
Beast," either on Saturday in
Cubberley or on channel 9 on
Friday or Monday evenings.

certainly never seen in Palo Alto.
Bunuel and Pasolini dominate
the festival and among the most
attractive programs are Max
Ophuls' resurrected last film
"Lola Montes" with Luchino
Visconti's "Senso," a Kurosawa
double bill of the fabulous
"Yojimbo" and the Japanese
version of "Macbeth," "Throne of
Blood," Rene Clair's innovative
early musicals "Le Million"and
"Under the Roofs of Paris" and
Rossellini's "The Rise of Louis
XIV" with Polanski's macabre
"Cul-de-Sac."
Don't miss Jean Cocteau's
extraordinary "Beauty and the
Beast," either on Saturday in
Cubberley or on channel 9 on
Friday or Monday evenings.
When "Billy Jack" was quietly
released last summer, it was
casually overlooked by the
cosmopolitan opinion makers and
didn't last more than a couple of
weeks on both the East and West
Coasts. Warner Brothers, without
faith in the project from the
beginning, didn't promote the
film and was prepared to write it
off as another independently
produced flop.
However, star-director
co-author Tom Laughlin was not
about to see his baby sink into
obsucrity so easily, and he
pumped his own money into a
high-powered ad campaign in
Minneapolis and watched his film
build from a modest opening to a
record breaking, open-ended
engagement.
In a rare case of Middle
America vindicating itself, "Billy
Jack" caught on in the Midwest,
where there are few critics but
many potential patrons, and by
the end of the year had grossed
four million dollars, more than
such well known items as
"McCabe and Mrs. Miller," "The
Omega Man" and "Bananas."
It will undoubtedly make
considerably more as it returns to
areas where it was originally
ignored but even now Laughlin
isn't satisfied, as he is suing
Warners (in a rather complicated
case) for improper handling of his
film and has recently taken ads in
the trades to admonish the
industry and critics for not
considering his film seriously for
year-end honors.
The belated verdict is that
"Billy Jack" (currently at the
Paris) is a decidedly unusual and
honorable film which is not only
rather charming in its total lack of
sophistication and artistic

pretention but extremely
powerful on the basic gut
emotional level in a way that the
best social consciousness pictures
can be.
I generally avoid the
sociological approach in discussing
films since most works intended
primarily to be relevant are
preachy, limited in scope and are,
by and large, bad movies anyway.
However much I would like to
avoid making such a comment, it
seems to me that "Billy Jack"
genuinely and reasonably deals
with many issues that beset
people today, from ecology to
race to virginity to gun control to
the tough-guy mystique to the
usefulness of political prisoners.
Naturally, the plot is
constructed so that the
protagonists promote the correct
causes and the baddies are
reactionaries but "Billy Jack" is
by no means plagued by
optimistic simplification. Drastic
divisions and disagreements exist
within the ranks to the point
where Billy Jack, partisan to a
strongly pacific faction, cannot
conceive of giving up his gun
while a faceless hick cop actually
breaks rank to defend what he,
not the local authorities, believes
is right.
Briefly, the action takes place
in a small southwestern
community outside of which a

progressive educational center has
been instituted, which will accept
anyone, no questions asked, for as
long as he or she wants to stay
and participate. The influx and
intermingling of blacks, Indians,
Chicanos and freaks predictably
upsets the civic leaders and no
restraint is exercised in trying to
exterminate the new community.
However, the center is run by a
strong liberal in the best sense
(quietly but convincingly played
by Laughlin's wife Dolores
Taylor, who also co-wrote "Billy
Jack") and is protected by a
half-breed of mysterious
background and experience.
Billy Jack, an ex-GI who is also
indoctrinated into an obscure
Indian cult, has great difficulty
supressing his violent urges and
finally, in a scene of great
simplicity and equally great direct
emotional force, takes the most
difficult step of his life by
accepting another person's love
and submerging himself in the
cause. At film's end, Billy is both
a (political) prisoner and (we
understand) a national hero and I
have heard rumblings that a sequel
to "Billy Jack" is already in the
works.
Integrated into the cast (which
I assume is largely comprised of
non-professionals) are members of
San Francisco's The Committee,
whose creative contribution to the
school is, naturally enough,

practice in improvisational
theatre. They are also responsible
for the funniest scene in the
picture, in which a phony hold-up
is staged in town to the
consternation of the local police.
In "Billy Jack," we finally have
a populist film which deserves to
be popular.

After several re runs of the
Janus Film Festival, the new
Altura Festival at the Fine Arts
is a welcome change. The festival,
comprised of 20 films on
double-bills to be shown over five
weeks, offers a number of films
never seen outside the Surf
Theatre in San Francisco and
certainly never seen in Palo Alto.
Bunuel and Pasolini dominate
the festival and among the most
attractive programs are Max
Ophuls' resurrected last film
"Lola Montes" with Luchino
Visconti's "Senso," a Kurosawa
double bill of the fabulous
"Yojimbo" and the Japanese
version of "Macbeth," "Throne of
Blood," Rene Clair's innovative
early musicals "Le Million"and
"Under the Roofs of Paris" and
Rossellini's "The Rise of Louis
XIV" with Polanski's macabre
"Cul-de-Sac."
Don't miss Jean Cocteau's
extraordinary "Beauty and the
Beast," either on Saturday in
Cubberley or on channel 9 on
Friday or Monday evenings.
When "Billy Jack" was quietly
released last summer, it was
casually overlooked by the
cosmopolitan opinion makers and
didn't last more than a couple of
weeks on both the East and West
Coasts. Warner Brothers, without
faith in the project from the
beginning, didn't promote the
film and was prepared to write it
off as another independently
produced flop.
However, star-director
co-author Tom Laughlin was not
about to see his baby sink into
obsucrity so easily, and he
pumped his own money into a
high-powered ad campaign in
Minneapolis and watched his film
build from a modest opening to a
record breaking, open-ended
engagement.
In a rare case of Middle
America vindicating itself, "Billy
Jack" caught on in the Midwest,
where there are few critics but
many potential patrons, and by
the end of the year had grossed
four million dollars, more than
such well known items as
"McCabe and Mrs. Miller," "The
Omega Man" and "Bananas."
It will undoubtedly make
considerably more as it returns to
areas where it was originally
ignored but even now Laughlin
isn't satisfied, as he is suing
Warners (in a rather complicated
case) for improper handling of his
film and has recently taken ads in
the trades to admonish the
industry and critics for not
considering his film seriously for
year-end honors.
The belated verdict is that
"Billy Jack" (currently at the
Paris) is a decidedly unusual and
honorable film which is not only
rather charming in its total lack of
sophistication and artistic

pretention but extremely
powerful on the basic gut
emotional level in a way that the
best social consciousness pictures
can be.
I generally avoid the
sociological approach in discussing
films since most works intended
primarily to be relevant are
preachy, limited in scope and are,
by and large, bad movies anyway.
However much I would like to
avoid making such a comment, it
seems to me that "Billy Jack"
genuinely and reasonably deals
with many issues that beset
people today, from ecology to
race to virginity to gun control to
the tough-guy mystique to the
usefulness of political prisoners.
Naturally, the plot is
constructed so that the
protagonists promote the correct
causes and the baddies are
reactionaries but "Billy Jack" is
by no means plagued by
optimistic simplification. Drastic
divisions and disagreements exist
within the ranks to the point
where Billy Jack, partisan to a
strongly pacific faction, cannot
conceive of giving up his gun
while a faceless hick cop actually
breaks rank to defend what he,
not the local authorities, believes
is right.
Briefly, the action takes place
in a small southwestern
community outside of which a

progressive educational center has
been instituted, which will accept
anyone, no questions asked, for as
long as he or she wants to stay
and participate. The influx and
intermingling of blacks, Indians,
Chicanos and freaks predictably
upsets the civic leaders and no
restraint is exercised in trying to
exterminate the new community.
However, the center is run by a
strong liberal in the best sense
(quietly but convincingly played
by Laughlin's wife Dolores
Taylor, who also co-wrote "Billy
Jack") and is protected by a
half-breed of mysterious
background and experience.
Billy Jack, an ex-GI who is also
indoctrinated into an obscure
Indian cult, has great difficulty
supressing his violent urges and
finally, in a scene of great
simplicity and equally great direct
emotional force, takes the most
difficult step of his life by
accepting another person's love
and submerging himself in the
cause. At film's end, Billy is both
a (political) prisoner and (we
understand) a national hero and I
have heard rumblings that a sequel
to "Billy Jack" is already in the
works.
Integrated into the cast (which
I assume is largely comprised of
non-professionals) are members of
San Francisco's The Committee,
whose creative contribution to the
school is, naturally enough,

practice in improvisational
theatre. They are also responsible
for the funniest scene in the
picture, in which a phony hold-up
is staged in town to the
consternation of the local police.
In "Billy Jack," we finally have
