MlSSED—Stanford slugging star Rod Boone takes a cut in the USF doubleheader last Saturday.
Co-captain Boone was selected to the 2nd team All-America last year as a sophomore. He hit for a .363
average last season and was chosen as the Indians' most valuable player in that campaign. Dominating the
teams' batting statistics, Boone led the club in runs scored, hits, doubles, home runs, total bases and runs
batted in. He will lead the Cards into tomorrow's doubleheader with highly regarded Santa Clara.
