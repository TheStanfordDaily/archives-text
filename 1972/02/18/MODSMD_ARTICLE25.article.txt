# Diamondmen Edge Cal-State Hayward
## 
### STAN WILSON 
Stanford's baseball team, led onet'
again by several excellent pitching
performances, shutout Hayward
Wednesday 2-0, to improve their
early season record to 5-1. Tom
Changnon, Mike Higgins, and Nick
Peterson split pitching duties,
with Changnon receiving credit
for the win.
"Our pitching has dominated
every game so far," explained
Coach Ray Young. "Our hitting
has not been that bad, we just
haven't been scoring enough
runs." So far this year Stanford
pitchers have hurled four
consecutive shutouts against
college competition, with an
overall earned run average of 0.40.
Six Stanford pitchers have yet to
give up an earned run.
Stanford started things off in
the Hayward game in the first
inning, scoring a run on a base hit
and three consecutive walks. In
the same inning, third baseman
Kim Hannaford made an
outstanding play at second to put
an end to any Hayward hopes for
scoring in that inning.

Stanford struck again in the
sixth on a run-scoring single by
Tom Williams, and Nick Peterson
shut out Hayward the rest of the
way to preserve a 2-0 decision.
Rod Boone and Tom Williams
each had two hits for Stanford,
and Kim Hannaford had a base hit
as well as playing an excellent
defensive game for the Indians.
The win gives Stanford needed
momentum for weekend games
against Davis and Santa Clara.
Friday the Indians travel to
Davis, and Saturday they're back
at Sunken Diamond for a double
header aginst Santa Clara, one of
the best teams in the nation
according to Coach Young.
Stanford will send Bob DiPietro
against the Broncos in the first
game, and Dan Shaw will pitch
the second. Santa Clara will
counter with Dan Troedson and
Todd Brentlinger, two talented
veterans, and the offense will be
led by hard-hitting third baseman
Gene Delyon.
The game will start at 12
o'clock Saturday, with the first
game lasting seven innings, and
the second going the full nine.
