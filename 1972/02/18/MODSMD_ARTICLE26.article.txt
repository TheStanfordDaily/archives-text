# Swimmers Face Cal Test
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
The Stanford swimming team
travels across the Bay this
weekend for what may be a close
meet against the California
Golden Bears, Saturday afternoon
at 2:00.
The Bears are led by versatile
freshman Mark Croghan, who
could swim the 200 IM, 200 fly,
1000 free or 200 breast in the
meet this weekend. Cal also has
Guy Molina in the 200 free and
200 back, Larry Shofe in the 500
and 1000 free, and Paul Nolan
and Gerry Keeler in the sprints.
On the basis of times done this
year Stanford should be an easy
winner. They have better times in
every event, with the possible
exception of the 100 free.
Terry Sutton coming off an

excellent weekend in Los Angeles
should have no problem in
winning the 1000 free, and the
500 free if necessary. The Indians
have a good chance to go one-two
in the 200 fly with Rick
Longinotti and John Stalker,
though they will be challenged by
Croghan and possibly Reed
Pendleton. In the 200 back Randy
Whitchurch and Jack Deppe
should place first and second, but
Molina has a lifetime best that
would place him close to both
Indians.
Dave Schilling should be able
to win in the 200 IM though
Croghan will be close to him all
the way. Brian Job and Schilling
will have no problem going
one-two once again in the 200
breast. The sprints could go either

way, since, except for Steve
Carey's relav split last weekend
the Stanford sprinters have not
been impressive. Stanford should
easily win both the 400 medley
relay and the 400 free relay.
How close the meet actually is
will depend a great deal on how
much emphasis Cal places on this
meet. Cal is ineligible for the
NCAA Championships, thus they
have a choice of pointing for the
dual meet this weekend or trying
to do a good job at the
Pacific-Eight Championships,
which are in two weeks. If they
decide to try for their best times
of the year against the Indians,
the meet could be fairly close
depending on how mentally
prepared Stanford is by meet
time.
