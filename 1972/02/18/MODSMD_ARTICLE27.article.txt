# Nicholson works And Wins
## 
### BILL CLASTER 
At the beginning of this year's basketball season, most people
assumed that John Stratton and Pat Rusco would continue last year's
battle for the other starting guard spot next to Claude Terry. Darrell
Fregia also was thought to have an outside chance at the job. Few
people, if any, thought that Bob Nicholson would take over that
position.
Yet Nicholson, the senior from Sanger (near Fresno), not only has
won a starting role, but has played an important part in Stanford's
relatively successful season.
To put it mildly, "Nick" has been a surprise. After leading his
Sanger High team to a 15-4 record while averaging 18 points a game,
Nicholson settled into relative obscurity at Stanford. He averaged 4.1
points for the 1968-6P Freshman team, and ir. two years and eighteen
games of varsity competition had a grand total of eighteen points.
Never once did he get to play when a game was still undecided.
Big Change
But things have changed this year. Nicholson got his chance and he
made the best of it. "Getting a chance was by far the biggest
difference in this season from the past two. Part of this has to do with
our bigger front line this year. Before, when we were small, Coach
Dallmar wanted to get as big a team on the court as possible. Now
that our rebounding has improved, there's more room for a 6'l"
guard."
Nicholson has done more though than just get a chance. He played
ball all last summer, and worked especially hard on his shooting. "I
know I don't have the best moves in the world, so when 1 get an open
shot, I've got to be able to hit it."
Having to work hard to get to play has almost become a way of life
for Nicholson. In high school his father was the team's coach, and
according to "Nick", "pushed me a lot harder than anybody else on
the team. I realize that it was the best thing for me in the long run,
but there were a lot of rough times."
Scholarship Offers
Upon high school graduation, Bob was offered athletic scholarships
by UC San Diego and four or five state schools. He turned them down
for an academic scholarship to Stanford, and has never regretted it.
Nicholson adds, "Even when I wasn't getting to play in the games, I
was happy to be here. For me, the education was the important part
and the basketball just a bonus."
Currently the number three shooter in the Pacific-8 with a .558
mark, Nicholson has a remarkably soft touch from the outside, and
unlike his backcourt mate Terry, shoots with almost flawless form.
His scoring average of only seven points a game can be attributed to

the fact that he averages less than five shots an outing. Yet his floor
leadership has given the Indians the poise that they have lacked in
recent years.
He passes well and has the ability to penetrate defenses and draw
them to him. Naturally, this sets up the other players for short
jumpers. In addition, the defense can't really completely key on Terry
when Nicholson is taking his drives through the center of the key.
Mann Helpful
"Nick" cerdits much of this year's Indian success to sophomore
Mike Mann. "Mike makes a big difference in our club. When he's on
like he was against Washington and Steve Hawes, we can really bo a
tough team. It also helps on defense to know that you've got a shot
blocker underneath to give you help."
Nicholson, an economics major, plans to go to UCLA Business
School next year. There he will have the privilege of watching UCLA's
Bill Walton, of whom Bob says, "is as good as Curtis Rowe or Sidney
Wicks and maybe even as good as Kareem Jabbar." However, unlike
almost everyone else who watches the UCLA machine roll, Nicholson
will be able to say he started against them last year. That, in itself, is
certainly a lot more than he or anybody else ever expected.

SANDWICHED—Senior Bob Nicholson drives between Cal defenders Harry Brown (42) and Ted Rudow
(34). Drives like the one shown above have given Claude Terry more room to operate in since opposing
teams cannot take Terry's backcourt mate lightly. Nicholson's inspired play has been a big factor in the
marked improvement of this year's varsity.

UP AND OVER—Frosh center Rich Kelley leaps over a USF defender
last Friday in the freshmens' 11th win of the season. The 7'l" Kelley
leads the frosh in scoring with a 18.5 average and is also pacing the
squad in rebounds with an average of 16. The Indian frosh will meet
the alumni tonight at 7:00 p.m.


IN CONTROL—Bob Nicholson sets up in Stanford's triple overtime
victory over Cal February 4th. Having escaped from two years of
service on the Indian bench, Nicholson has nailed down a starting
guard position with his fine shooting and playmaking ability.

will be able to say he started against them last year. That, in itself, is
certainly a lot more than he or anybody else ever expected.

SANDWICHED—Senior Bob Nicholson drives between Cal defenders Harry Brown (42) and Ted Rudow
(34). Drives like the one shown above have given Claude Terry more room to operate in since opposing
teams cannot take Terry's backcourt mate lightly. Nicholson's inspired play has been a big factor in the
marked improvement of this year's varsity.

UP AND OVER—Frosh center Rich Kelley leaps over a USF defender
last Friday in the freshmens' 11th win of the season. The 7'l" Kelley
leads the frosh in scoring with a 18.5 average and is also pacing the
squad in rebounds with an average of 16. The Indian frosh will meet
the alumni tonight at 7:00 p.m.


IN CONTROL—Bob Nicholson sets up in Stanford's triple overtime
victory over Cal February 4th. Having escaped from two years of
service on the Indian bench, Nicholson has nailed down a starting
guard position with his fine shooting and playmaking ability.
At the beginning of this year's basketball season, most people
assumed that John Stratton and Pat Rusco would continue last year's
battle for the other starting guard spot next to Claude Terry. Darrell
Fregia also was thought to have an outside chance at the job. Few
people, if any, thought that Bob Nicholson would take over that
position.
Yet Nicholson, the senior from Sanger (near Fresno), not only has
won a starting role, but has played an important part in Stanford's
relatively successful season.
To put it mildly, "Nick" has been a surprise. After leading his
Sanger High team to a 15-4 record while averaging 18 points a game,
Nicholson settled into relative obscurity at Stanford. He averaged 4.1
points for the 1968-6P Freshman team, and ir. two years and eighteen
games of varsity competition had a grand total of eighteen points.
Never once did he get to play when a game was still undecided.
Big Change
But things have changed this year. Nicholson got his chance and he
made the best of it. "Getting a chance was by far the biggest
difference in this season from the past two. Part of this has to do with
our bigger front line this year. Before, when we were small, Coach
Dallmar wanted to get as big a team on the court as possible. Now
that our rebounding has improved, there's more room for a 6'l"
guard."
Nicholson has done more though than just get a chance. He played
ball all last summer, and worked especially hard on his shooting. "I
know I don't have the best moves in the world, so when 1 get an open
shot, I've got to be able to hit it."
Having to work hard to get to play has almost become a way of life
for Nicholson. In high school his father was the team's coach, and
according to "Nick", "pushed me a lot harder than anybody else on
the team. I realize that it was the best thing for me in the long run,
but there were a lot of rough times."
Scholarship Offers
Upon high school graduation, Bob was offered athletic scholarships
by UC San Diego and four or five state schools. He turned them down
for an academic scholarship to Stanford, and has never regretted it.
Nicholson adds, "Even when I wasn't getting to play in the games, I
was happy to be here. For me, the education was the important part
and the basketball just a bonus."
Currently the number three shooter in the Pacific-8 with a .558
mark, Nicholson has a remarkably soft touch from the outside, and
unlike his backcourt mate Terry, shoots with almost flawless form.
His scoring average of only seven points a game can be attributed to

the fact that he averages less than five shots an outing. Yet his floor
leadership has given the Indians the poise that they have lacked in
recent years.
He passes well and has the ability to penetrate defenses and draw
them to him. Naturally, this sets up the other players for short
jumpers. In addition, the defense can't really completely key on Terry
when Nicholson is taking his drives through the center of the key.
Mann Helpful
"Nick" cerdits much of this year's Indian success to sophomore
Mike Mann. "Mike makes a big difference in our club. When he's on
like he was against Washington and Steve Hawes, we can really bo a
tough team. It also helps on defense to know that you've got a shot
blocker underneath to give you help."
Nicholson, an economics major, plans to go to UCLA Business
School next year. There he will have the privilege of watching UCLA's
Bill Walton, of whom Bob says, "is as good as Curtis Rowe or Sidney
Wicks and maybe even as good as Kareem Jabbar." However, unlike
almost everyone else who watches the UCLA machine roll, Nicholson
will be able to say he started against them last year. That, in itself, is
certainly a lot more than he or anybody else ever expected.
