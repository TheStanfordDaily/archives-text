# Alumni Test Frosh Cagers
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford fans will get a glimpse
of past and future Indian stars
tonight when the Stanford
freshmen host the alumni in an
8:00 p.m. game at Maples
Pavilion.
The frosh sport a 12-3 record
after two impressive wins last
weekend. The Indians ripped USF
97-66 on Friday night and
avenged an earlier loss to St.
Mary's by overwhelming the Gaels
97-69 Saturday afternoon.
Rich Kelley leads a balanced
Stanford scoring attack with an
18.5 average. Mel Arterberry,
Scott Trobbe, Archie Dean, Ben
Bluitt, Mark Gilberg, and Mike
Simons all are averaging between
8 and 13 points per game.
If last year's game is any
indication, the alumni will not be
pushovers. The 1970-71 Stanford
frosh trailed by four points with
30 seconds left but managed to
pull out an 83-81 victory.
This year's alumni squad
features eight former Stanford
captains and several of the leading
Indian career scorers. John
Arillaga is 14th on the all-time
scoring list and Mai McElwain is
17th. Art Harris, the fourth
leading career scorer and second

to Claude Terry in single season
scoring, may also play.
Other members of the alumni
team include Dennis O'Neil,
Stanford's third leading scorer last
year, Gary Petersmeyer, Fred
Green, Greg Osborne, John
Hendry, Gary Loveridge, Phil
Kelly, and Don and Doug
Clementson.
Assistant freshman coach Stan
Dowson will also don an alumni
uniform. Dowson, who has gained
immeasurable fame as a two on
two player, warned that he will
personally "destroy" the frosh.
Dowson could be a valuable
weapon for the alumni because he
knows all the freshman plays.
The alumni have consistently
made a good showing in the
annual contest except when they
decided to practice before the
1968 game. After working out on
Friday afternoon and partying on
Friday night, the grads were so
stiff that they lost by 20 points
on Saturday.
Still, the frosh do not seem
overconfident. "The old guys

could give us a tough time if they
don't schedule a practice," says
Kelley.
Saturday afternoon the frosh
will return to intercollegiate
action with a 7:00 p.m. game
against San Francisco City College
at Maples. Admission to both
games will be free.
