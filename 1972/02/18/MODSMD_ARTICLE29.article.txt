# Testimony Begins In CJP Hearing
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Two prosecution witnesses
presented varying testimony yesterday
against Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement (SRM) member Kwonping
Ho in his Campus Judicial Panel (CJP)
hearing for two violations of the
Fundamental Standard.
Ho has been charged with assault
on Faculty Club Executive Chef
Arturo Lionetti and with forcibly
entering the Faculty Club kitchen "for
the purpose of stealing food." Both
charges stem from the SRM's invasion
of the Faculty Club on January 24.
The hearing continues today at
9:30 a.m. in Room 83 of the Graduate

School of Business. Golden Gate
College of Law professor Leslie
Minkus serves as the hearing officer.
The defense declined yesterday to
have Minkus disqualified from the case
even though he had admitted studying
under prosecution witness and
Stanford law professor Jack
Friedenthal.
Lionetti, the first witness at the
hearing, testified that in attempting to
gain entry to the kitchen, Ho had
pushed him on the shoulder with his
right hand and elbowed him in the ribs
with his left arm.
Different Story
However, the second witness of the

afternoon, Faculty Club Manager
Forrest Tregea, stated that Ho had
been pushing with his right hand on
the door that Tregea had been trying
to shut. He further testified that Ho
had pushed Lionetti on the chest with
his left hand.
Before the witnesses had given their
testimony the defense counsel
attempted to "bring into question the
CJP's authority and your [Minkus']
authority to hear this case."
The defense cited Articles 111 and
IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter of 1968, which discuss the
requirements for student body
approval of new judicial systems.
However, since the CJP was founded
by President Lyman under special
powers, it is supposedly exempt from
those Articles. Minkus rejected the
motion because he did not feel he
could properly rule on it under CJP
procedures.
Hearing officer Minkus granted
defense requests that "all witnesses
would be excluded from the hearing
until after their testimony" and that
photographers and police officers be
excluded from the hearing as well.
In a statement at the beginning of
the hearing, Ho told the audience of
75 that the "possible consequence" of
the hearing could be his suspension or
expulsion. Should this happen, Ho said
he might be deported. If so, he would
then be drafted into the Singapore
army for three years.
Scuffle Described
In further testimony about the
alleged assault, Lionetti said that in
attempting to shut a door leading to
the Faculty Club kitchen to keep
protesters out he had "grabbed onto
the [door's] safety bar and held my
ground."
Lionetti said that Ho approached

shouting several times to the crowd of
350 in the Club dining room " 'Let's
go into the kitchen, that's where the
food is.' " Lionetti asserted that Ho
then "gave me an elbow right in the
ribs and then pushed me with his
hand. He was so close to me that we
almost kissed each other."
Lionetti, in explaining, how he, at
263 pounds could be shoved aside by a
140 pound Ho, likened the
confrontation to "David and Goliath."
In response to defense cross
examination designed to uncover any
bias on his part Lionetti said "some of
my best friends are Chinamen."
Gained Entrance
In his testimony Tregea said his
own and Lionetti's efforts to close the
doors leading to the kitchen against
the demonstrators were unsuccessful.
He said "Mr. Ho was able to push the
door I was holding and I had to step
back. Almost simultaneously Mr. Ho
pushed Mr. Lionetti out of the way"
and entered the kitchen.
Tregea also confirmed that he had
written a memorandum stating that
approximately $200 worth of food
was "consumed or missing" as a result
of the January 24 incident. This sum
was included in the total $2,000 loss
which Tregea previously asserted had
been incurred by the Club.
Starting Monday, a CJP hearing for
Ho and three others will begin on
Campus Disruption Policy violation
charges coming from the January 18
protest in the class of Electrical
Engineering professor William
Shockley.
The three others are Venceremos
members Gerry Foote, Don Lee, and
Alice Furumoto. The hearing will start
at 8:30 a.m. and will be held in
Geology Room 320 on the Outer
Quad.

College of Law professor Leslie
Minkus serves as the hearing officer.
The defense declined yesterday to
have Minkus disqualified from the case
even though he had admitted studying
under prosecution witness and
Stanford law professor Jack
Friedenthal.
Lionetti, the first witness at the
hearing, testified that in attempting to
gain entry to the kitchen, Ho had
pushed him on the shoulder with his
right hand and elbowed him in the ribs
with his left arm.
Different Story
However, the second witness of the

afternoon, Faculty Club Manager
Forrest Tregea, stated that Ho had
been pushing with his right hand on
the door that Tregea had been trying
to shut. He further testified that Ho
had pushed Lionetti on the chest with
his left hand.
Before the witnesses had given their
testimony the defense counsel
attempted to "bring into question the
CJP's authority and your [Minkus']
authority to hear this case."
The defense cited Articles 111 and
IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter of 1968, which discuss the
requirements for student body
approval of new judicial systems.
However, since the CJP was founded
by President Lyman under special
powers, it is supposedly exempt from
those Articles. Minkus rejected the
motion because he did not feel he
could properly rule on it under CJP
procedures.
Hearing officer Minkus granted
defense requests that "all witnesses
would be excluded from the hearing
until after their testimony" and that
photographers and police officers be
excluded from the hearing as well.
In a statement at the beginning of
the hearing, Ho told the audience of
75 that the "possible consequence" of
the hearing could be his suspension or
expulsion. Should this happen, Ho said
he might be deported. If so, he would
then be drafted into the Singapore
army for three years.
Scuffle Described
In further testimony about the
alleged assault, Lionetti said that in
attempting to shut a door leading to
the Faculty Club kitchen to keep
protesters out he had "grabbed onto
the [door's] safety bar and held my
ground."
Lionetti said that Ho approached

shouting several times to the crowd of
350 in the Club dining room " 'Let's
go into the kitchen, that's where the
food is.' " Lionetti asserted that Ho
then "gave me an elbow right in the
ribs and then pushed me with his
hand. He was so close to me that we
almost kissed each other."
Lionetti, in explaining, how he, at
263 pounds could be shoved aside by a
140 pound Ho, likened the
confrontation to "David and Goliath."
In response to defense cross
examination designed to uncover any
bias on his part Lionetti said "some of
my best friends are Chinamen."
Gained Entrance
In his testimony Tregea said his
own and Lionetti's efforts to close the
doors leading to the kitchen against
the demonstrators were unsuccessful.
He said "Mr. Ho was able to push the
door I was holding and I had to step
back. Almost simultaneously Mr. Ho
pushed Mr. Lionetti out of the way"
and entered the kitchen.
Tregea also confirmed that he had
written a memorandum stating that
approximately $200 worth of food
was "consumed or missing" as a result
of the January 24 incident. This sum
was included in the total $2,000 loss
which Tregea previously asserted had
been incurred by the Club.
Starting Monday, a CJP hearing for
Ho and three others will begin on
Campus Disruption Policy violation
charges coming from the January 18
protest in the class of Electrical
Engineering professor William
Shockley.
The three others are Venceremos
members Gerry Foote, Don Lee, and
Alice Furumoto. The hearing will start
at 8:30 a.m. and will be held in
Geology Room 320 on the Outer
Quad.
Two prosecution witnesses
presented varying testimony yesterday
against Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement (SRM) member Kwonping
Ho in his Campus Judicial Panel (CJP)
hearing for two violations of the
Fundamental Standard.
Ho has been charged with assault
on Faculty Club Executive Chef
Arturo Lionetti and with forcibly
entering the Faculty Club kitchen "for
the purpose of stealing food." Both
charges stem from the SRM's invasion
of the Faculty Club on January 24.
The hearing continues today at
9:30 a.m. in Room 83 of the Graduate

School of Business. Golden Gate
