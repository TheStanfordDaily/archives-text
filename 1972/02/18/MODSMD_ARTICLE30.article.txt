# Faculty Senate Vote Criticizes Disruptions
## 
### PATTY FELS 
By an overwhelming majority, the Faculty Senate yesterday passed a
resolution condemning "concerted disruption in classrooms and laboratories,
threatened and attempted violence and other forms of intimidation" against
members of the Stanford community.
The resolution, introduced for the Steering Committee by Math Professor
Halsey Royden, asked that members of the University "make every effort to
identify and assist in holding legally responsible those who engage in these and
other violent and disruptive acts directed against any University member."
It concluded by urging the Administration to "use all reasonable means to
protect the performance of essential University functions, including the prompt
prosecution of all cases involving violent and disruptive conduct, through
appropriate judicial mechanisms, including the Campus Judicial Panel."
Royden said that although there have been at least 10 cases of classroom
disruption this year, the faculty has been extremely apathetic. "Disruption of
classroom and laboratories comes very close to sacred ground," he commented.
The resolution passed by a 36-1 vote, with three abstentions.
Lyman Report
In his presidential report, Lyman explained his position on Placement Center
recruiting. Calling it an "irreconcilable issue," he said there is no feasible way to
distinguish between moral and immoral recruiting and emphasizes that Stanford
tries not to make moral choices for students.
He considers the possibility of no recruiting a compromise and added that it
would be unenforceable. "Recruiting won't vanish. It just won't be in the
recruiting area," he said.
In a second report, Provost William Miller said he had written to the Steering
Committee expressing his concern that there is no mechanism to review
questions regarding faculty and student relations in a classroom situation.
"Until quite recently it was possible to view this situation as one in which real
offenses were probably few and most certainly randomly distributed," he said.
'Consequently, they probably did not justify the very real costs of attempting to
find a systematic remedy. I think that may no longer be good enough."
Miller went on to say, "I am struck by the greater readiness of students to
articulate real and imagined offenses against them and their unwillingness to
settle for purely procedural responses."
Policy Sought
The Steering Committee is now trying to develop a policy that will recognize
student interests and also protect faculty.
Doug McHenry, a member of the ASSU Council of Presidents, delivered a
i-peech to clarify student opinions on campus issues. He stressed the problem of
University governance.
Mc Henry complained that there is no redress system for students against
faculty performance. He feels that too much emphasis is placed on research
rather than teaching. He also criticized the declining use of faculty evaluation
sheets.
Discussing the Shockley issue, McHenry said, "It's a question of whether
racism lowers the quality of education."
Mascot Change
When questioned by ASSU representative Scott Burke about the Indian
mascot controversy, Lyman said he had met with the Ombudsman and would
meet with Native American students in the near future. "I'm not sure how you
decide on an issue like that," he said. He added even if a referendum defeats the
change that he still might insist on it.
At the close of the meeting Dean of Engineering Joseph Pettit gave his final
report on the School of Engineering. He is leaving to become president of
Georgia Tech.

rather than teaching. He also criticized the declining use of faculty evaluation
sheets.
Discussing the Shockley issue, McHenry said, "It's a question of whether
racism lowers the quality of education."
Mascot Change
When questioned by ASSU representative Scott Burke about the Indian
mascot controversy, Lyman said he had met with the Ombudsman and would
meet with Native American students in the near future. "I'm not sure how you
decide on an issue like that," he said. He added even if a referendum defeats the
change that he still might insist on it.
At the close of the meeting Dean of Engineering Joseph Pettit gave his final
report on the School of Engineering. He is leaving to become president of
Georgia Tech.
By an overwhelming majority, the Faculty Senate yesterday passed a
resolution condemning "concerted disruption in classrooms and laboratories,
threatened and attempted violence and other forms of intimidation" against
members of the Stanford community.
The resolution, introduced for the Steering Committee by Math Professor
Halsey Royden, asked that members of the University "make every effort to
identify and assist in holding legally responsible those who engage in these and
other violent and disruptive acts directed against any University member."
It concluded by urging the Administration to "use all reasonable means to
protect the performance of essential University functions, including the prompt
prosecution of all cases involving violent and disruptive conduct, through
appropriate judicial mechanisms, including the Campus Judicial Panel."
Royden said that although there have been at least 10 cases of classroom
disruption this year, the faculty has been extremely apathetic. "Disruption of
classroom and laboratories comes very close to sacred ground," he commented.
The resolution passed by a 36-1 vote, with three abstentions.
Lyman Report
In his presidential report, Lyman explained his position on Placement Center
recruiting. Calling it an "irreconcilable issue," he said there is no feasible way to
distinguish between moral and immoral recruiting and emphasizes that Stanford
tries not to make moral choices for students.
He considers the possibility of no recruiting a compromise and added that it
would be unenforceable. "Recruiting won't vanish. It just won't be in the
recruiting area," he said.
In a second report, Provost William Miller said he had written to the Steering
Committee expressing his concern that there is no mechanism to review
questions regarding faculty and student relations in a classroom situation.
"Until quite recently it was possible to view this situation as one in which real
offenses were probably few and most certainly randomly distributed," he said.
'Consequently, they probably did not justify the very real costs of attempting to
find a systematic remedy. I think that may no longer be good enough."
Miller went on to say, "I am struck by the greater readiness of students to
articulate real and imagined offenses against them and their unwillingness to
settle for purely procedural responses."
Policy Sought
The Steering Committee is now trying to develop a policy that will recognize
student interests and also protect faculty.
Doug McHenry, a member of the ASSU Council of Presidents, delivered a
i-peech to clarify student opinions on campus issues. He stressed the problem of
University governance.
Mc Henry complained that there is no redress system for students against
faculty performance. He feels that too much emphasis is placed on research
rather than teaching. He also criticized the declining use of faculty evaluation
sheets.
Discussing the Shockley issue, McHenry said, "It's a question of whether
