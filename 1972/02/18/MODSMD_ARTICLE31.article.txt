# Senate OKs Photographs
## 
### TINA COOPER 
The Student Senate, after extended debate, last night voted 18-9 to admit all
photographers to its meetings. Buck Schott submitted the 'Open. Senate'
resolution in response to Chairman James Jefferson's barring of an Arena
photographer from a meeting two weeks ago.
Schott said his resolution was based on the principle of freedom of the press.
He defined a public office as one which was open to the scrutiny of reporters
and photographers.
Several senators opposed the resolution on the basis of "political realities on
this campus." They feared that conservative photographers might turn in their
negatives to the police to help identify senators at demonstrations. Pete Knutson
offered an amendment allowing individual senators to refuse to be
photographed, but this was defeated.
In other action, a motion to relieve Mike Dawson of his position as a senator
was delayed until he appeared to speak in his own defense. There is some doubt
whether Dawson has been registered as a student since last winter quarter.
A resolution condemning bombings and vandalism on campus was delayed
until next meeting for lack of a quorum.
