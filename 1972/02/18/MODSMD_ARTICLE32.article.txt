Death Penalty Repealed ?
LOS ANGELES — The California Supreme Court
has declared the death penalty unconstitutional,
KNXT television reported last night. Court sources
were not immediately available for confirmation.
The station said it learned of the "unconfirmed"
decision "from highly placed sources in Gov.
Reagan's office, the state legislature and the
California judiciary."
One of Gov. Reagan's press aides, contacted after
the television report, said he knew nothing of the
purported Supreme Court vote.
The court's decision came on a 6-1 vote in Los
Angeles Wednesday, the station said.
KNXT said it contacted a Supreme Court clerk
who would only say, "A momentous court decision
will be announced tomorrow (Friday) at noon."
"The decision has been cloaked in secrecy with
sources at first hedging, but then asking not to be
quoted when they did speak," the television station
reported.
"The decision is believed to have been made on a
suit brought by the American Civil Liberties
Union," the report continued.
The decision affects 100 men and five women
under sentence of death in the state's prisons.
KNXT said the lone dissenter on the court was

Justice Marshall F. McCombe. He could not be
reached for comment.
Trial Dale Set
SAN JOSE — Superior Court Judge Richard E.
Arnason set a February 28 trial date for Angela
Davis yesterday after rejecting a defense motion to
move the trial and have the state pay defense costs.
Davis' trial was scheduled to start January
21 and has been continued on a day-to-day basis
since that date while her attorneys argued several
defense motions.
Arnason granted in part a motion ordering the
prosecution to give the defense information on
prospective jurors. But he said the prosecution
doesn't have to disclose the source of the
information or any information that it doesn't
already possess.
Chief defense attorney Howard Moore Jr. said:
"We're not disappointed in Judge Arnason's rulings.
We'll be ready the 28th. Miss Davis is ready to get it
underway. She wants her freedom."
Despite denial of the motion to have the state
pay defense costs, Moore said Miss Davis' attorneys
would remain in the case. "As it stands now we
don't have enough money but we are hopeful
donations will come through," he said.

'Journey For Peace'
WASHINGTON — President Nixon began his
"journey for peace" to China yesterday. He said he
was undertaking an historic mission for all mankind
in search of a common ground with the long-hostile
and isolated Asian Communist power.
As he embarked for the first face-to-face summit
meeting ever between U.S. and Chinese Communist
leaders, he tempered his words of hope with words
of caution.
"We are .. . under no illusion that 20 years of
hostility ... will be swept away by one week of
talks," Nixon told some 8,000 persons attending
farewell ceremonies at the White House.
Power Cuts In Ireland
LONDON — Britain's power crisis spread to
Northern Ireland for the first time yesterday, adding
an order for four daily electricity cuts to the
province's troubles.
At the same time, the government warned that
power cuts already hitting homes and factories
across Britain for up to 12 hours a day will be
increased next Wednesday unless the crisis is settled.
Industry Minister John Davies told Parliament
that even with these further cuts, power plants can
be kept running only until the end of next week.

prosecution to give the defense information on
prospective jurors. But he said the prosecution
doesn't have to disclose the source of the
information or any information that it doesn't
already possess.
Chief defense attorney Howard Moore Jr. said:
"We're not disappointed in Judge Arnason's rulings.
We'll be ready the 28th. Miss Davis is ready to get it
underway. She wants her freedom."
Despite denial of the motion to have the state
pay defense costs, Moore said Miss Davis' attorneys
would remain in the case. "As it stands now we
don't have enough money but we are hopeful
donations will come through," he said.

'Journey For Peace'
WASHINGTON — President Nixon began his
"journey for peace" to China yesterday. He said he
was undertaking an historic mission for all mankind
in search of a common ground with the long-hostile
and isolated Asian Communist power.
As he embarked for the first face-to-face summit
meeting ever between U.S. and Chinese Communist
leaders, he tempered his words of hope with words
of caution.
"We are .. . under no illusion that 20 years of
hostility ... will be swept away by one week of
talks," Nixon told some 8,000 persons attending
farewell ceremonies at the White House.
Power Cuts In Ireland
LONDON — Britain's power crisis spread to
Northern Ireland for the first time yesterday, adding
an order for four daily electricity cuts to the
province's troubles.
At the same time, the government warned that
power cuts already hitting homes and factories
across Britain for up to 12 hours a day will be
increased next Wednesday unless the crisis is settled.
Industry Minister John Davies told Parliament
that even with these further cuts, power plants can
be kept running only until the end of next week.
Death Penalty Repealed ?
LOS ANGELES — The California Supreme Court
has declared the death penalty unconstitutional,
KNXT television reported last night. Court sources
were not immediately available for confirmation.
The station said it learned of the "unconfirmed"
decision "from highly placed sources in Gov.
Reagan's office, the state legislature and the
California judiciary."
One of Gov. Reagan's press aides, contacted after
the television report, said he knew nothing of the
purported Supreme Court vote.
The court's decision came on a 6-1 vote in Los
Angeles Wednesday, the station said.
KNXT said it contacted a Supreme Court clerk
who would only say, "A momentous court decision
will be announced tomorrow (Friday) at noon."
"The decision has been cloaked in secrecy with
sources at first hedging, but then asking not to be
quoted when they did speak," the television station
reported.
"The decision is believed to have been made on a
suit brought by the American Civil Liberties
Union," the report continued.
The decision affects 100 men and five women
under sentence of death in the state's prisons.
KNXT said the lone dissenter on the court was

Justice Marshall F. McCombe. He could not be
reached for comment.
Trial Dale Set
SAN JOSE — Superior Court Judge Richard E.
Arnason set a February 28 trial date for Angela
Davis yesterday after rejecting a defense motion to
move the trial and have the state pay defense costs.
Davis' trial was scheduled to start January
21 and has been continued on a day-to-day basis
since that date while her attorneys argued several
defense motions.
Arnason granted in part a motion ordering the
prosecution to give the defense information on
prospective jurors. But he said the prosecution
doesn't have to disclose the source of the
information or any information that it doesn't
already possess.
Chief defense attorney Howard Moore Jr. said:
