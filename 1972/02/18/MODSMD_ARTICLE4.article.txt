# One Arrest Made
## Deputies Clear Center 
### CHRIS PECK 
Approximately 50 students occupied Placement Center
interview rooms yesterday until Santa Clara County
Sheriffs deputies ordered the building cleared at 10:15
a.m. One student, Tom Meyer, was arrested when he
declined to leave the interview room of Litton Industries.
The demonstrators had asked recruiters from
McDonnel-Douglas Aircraft, the U.S. Naval Missile Center,
and Litton Industries to discuss the role their
organizations play in the Vietnam War.
Sheriff's deputies moved into the building after
director Ralph Keller asked the protesters to leave because
"you are interrupting the regular activity of the Placement
Center and not allowing the scheduled interviews to be
held." The occupation lasted about an hour and a half
before Keller called the sheriff's office.
Meyer's arrest came after Lieutenant Donald Tamm
announced to the crowd that anyone caught in an
interview room was subject to immediate arrest if the
recruiter in the room indicated that he was unable to
conduct his regularly scheduled interviews because of the
action of persons in the room.
Meyer was arrested in the interview room of Litton
Industries where he was discussing the ethical basis of the
disruption with Litton representative Jerry King. "I was
definitely intimidated by these people," King said prior to
Meyer's arrest.
No Interference
After Meyer's arrest, Lieutenant Tamm went to the
room where Naval Missile Center representative Ray
Mansini was discussing the Navy's missile systems with
about six demonstrators. Although at least two interviews
were scheduled with Mansini during the time his interview
room was occupied, he told Tamm that "none of these
people significantly interfered with my work here"
thereby allowing the six to escape arrest.
McDonnell-Douglas representative Norm Stocks
seemed the most indignant over the disruption and
commented after the protesters had left the building,
"Well, I'm glad that's over. Now we can all get down to
business again."

Meyer, who had been fasting nine days, apparently
contemplated being arrested before he entered the
Placement Center, and read a prepared statement as
deputies led him away from the building.
"Our paid employee, Richard Lyman, has failed in his
responsibility to see to it that organizations which are
deeply involved in war crimes in Southeast Asia do not
carry on their business at Stanford by recruiting here," he
said. "For nine days I have been fasting, asking Mr.
Lyman to suspend this recruiting."
Cookies Baked
Meyer had baked cookies for the recruiters, saying he
felt no ill will towards them. They were not easy to eat,
however, because someone had planted a nauseous
chemical in the corridor where the interview rooms are
located.
Most of the attention centered around Naval Missile
Center representative Mansini and McDonnell-Douglas
man Stocks.
The Stanford Rehabilitation Movement gave out fact
sheets on McDonnell-Douglas which claimed the company
did more than $3 billion of war related research and
development a year, mostly in the construction of fighter
bombers.
Interviews Attempted
About 15 students signed up for interviews with
McDonnell-Douglas, Litton, TRW, and the Naval Missile
Center and about four of them attempted to have
interviews during the demonstration.
One asked the demonstrators, "Isn't it my decision
who I want to work for and shouldn't I be allowed to
make that decision on my own?"
"Of course," replied one of the occupants of the
building, "but we think that you should make that
decision and discuss your plans far away from this
University campus."
The Navy interviews were cancelled as a result of the
protest, but the three other companies remained at the
Placement Center during the afternoon to talk with
prospective employees.
