# Deficiencies Plague Women's PE
## 
### TERRIE McDONALD (Last in a series) 
Freshmen women entering Stanford
last fall found a publicity flyer
explaining men's intramurals and club
sports in their orientation packet. All
the freshmen did. The freshmen men,
however, did not find a flyer
publicizing women's recreation and
intramurals in their folders. No one
did.
Dutch Fehring, Director of Men's
Intramurals and Club Sports, has a
salaried staff of six part-time students,
a dozen sports directors and fifteen
club sports managers working with
him to organize the exclusively male
intramurals and somewhat co-ed club
sports. His office coordianted the
printing and distribution of the flyers.
Karen Cartwright is president of the
Women's Recreation Association
(WRA), the completely volunteer,
student run organization that plans all
women's and co-ed intramurals, co-ed
tournaments and women's and co-ed
recreational activities. She is also a
full-time undergraduate and House
Fellow at Branner Hall.
Cartwright arrived on campus early
last fall to put stacks of the
three-year-old Women's Physical
Eduation (WPE) and WRA brochure in
dormitories before the freshmen
arrived. It is an attractive, six page
booklet of dated information.
'Little Sister'
The WRA, technically an
independent organization with a
$4,500 budget and board of student
sports managers, remains a "little
sister" appendage tied to WPE through
use of department equipment,

facilities and supplies. Carroll Diaz, an
assistant professor in the WPE
department, teaches a full schedule of
classes and serves as faculty advisor to
the WRA.
The obsolete booklet publicizes
WPE classes as well as extra-curricular
sports and recreational opportunities,
but when WRA finally brings its
publicity up to date, WPE won't be
included in the brochure. WPE
Department Chairman, Pamela
Strathairn, feels that it is important to
distinguish between the non-credit
recreation activities and credit classes.
While the distinction between
recreational and curricular sports for
women is scarcely in danger of
blurring, Strathairn's sentiments hint
at WPE's concern for preserving
academic credibility for its courses.
The one unit academic credit assigned
to most physical education courses
may not be much, but it symbolizes
Stanford's recognition of the
legitimacy of sports at this very
academic institution and explains
WPE's insistence on instructional
excellence.
Bottom of the Pole
The department faculty supported
the 1967 change from a school-wide,
two-quarter physical education
requirement to the current elective
system and saw the administrative
necessity of eliminating Stanford's PE
major in 1963, but other changes and
proposals have not been so positive.
There is an uneasy awareness that, as
one WPE faculty member said,
"Women's physical education is at the
bottom of the totem pole."
Strathairn is unhappy with the

University's 1968 decision to withhold
professorial rank and tenure from
physical education department
personnel who did not already hold
them. The new policy, she said, strikes
at the teaching profession's traditional
mechanism for providing job security.
There is also a faction on campus
lobbying for the removal of academic
credit from physical education courses
that causes the department some
concern.
However, while the academic side
of women's sports is curtailed by
inadequate facilities and its status is
ocassionally questioned, it is the
recreationaJ aspect that Strathairn
feels is weakest.
The WRA co-ordinates and finances
recreational swimming hours at the
women's pool, female and co-ed
intramurals, co-ed tournaments, game
refereeing dance clinics, and recreation
nights in the gym. The organization
encounters many of the same
difficulties as the WPE department,
mostly with space.
Limited Space
Female gymnasts are limited in
work-out opportunities because of the
gym's popularity and complain when
they "see boys playing basketball
immediately after our class" during
open recreation hours. Fencers,
dancers, gymnasts and basketball
players crowd each other out in the
competition for space.
Sounding out the interests of
Stanford co-eds ; and then marshalling
WRA resources to meet than is
another problem. Ann Hill, last year's
WRA president, took office fall

quarter 1970, with a core of three
people and a random collection of
information on costs and previous
programs. She investigated, organized
and built up a recreational program
that was termed a "revival" by one
WRA member.
Hill commented that the $4,500
WRA has received from the University
since 1966 "was a lot of money then,"
but not enough when she was
president. Hill stated that in the past
poor organization and lack of planning
had prevented the WRA from putting
the money to best use.
Cartwright emphasizes the
individual's responsibility for the
women's recreation program. "If the
women are interested, they will
organize," she said.
She cited examples of WRA
sponsored golf and tennis tournaments
that were ignored by the student body
in general and concluded the Stanford
woman's interest in athletics is
satisfied primarily through WPE
classes. Beyond that, she said, "The
WRA satisfies the needs and interests
of the gi:!s and has more than
sufficient finds for expanding."
Can't Drag Them
Cartwright pointed out that on
recreation nights last fall, when the
court and equipment were available in
the women's gym, 15 to 20 girls
initially showed up for volleyball. As
mid-terms appraoched, the number
dwindled to 10 and finally faded to
three or four. "You can't drag girls
into the gym," she stated. "We
encourage, not coerce."
Volleyball, a popular co-ed
sport during spring quarter, is not
offered by WPE for girls only.
Paula Johnson, the WRA
volleyball manager, feels that
"classes would level out the wide
diversity of talent" and encourage
more women to come out for the
sport on recreation nights in the
gym.
Cartwright and Department
Chairman Straithairn maintain
that if enough interest in
volleyball had been shown during
autumn recreation hours, WPE
would have offered the sport as a
class.
The plight <~f the Stanford
co-ed interested in participating in
recreational sports without having
to devote time to recruiting
players, planning schedules and
publicizing games is largely
unresolved.
WPE protects itself from
allotting faculty time and facilities
to potentially unpopular classes
by testing enthusiasm through the
WRA. Women interested in a
sport not offered by WPE or WRA
are told to first work with WRA
until participation can be shown
over a period of time.
Junior Mary Gillam is
interested in lacrosse and thinks
other Stanford girls would sign up
for a class if the sport were
offered in the time schedule. She
does not sympathize with the
suggestion that she first help
generate support for a lacrosse
program and become involved in
it recreationally, stating, "It's not
my duty as a student to organize
classes."
Strongly motivated girls are an
essential nucleus for developing
recreation programs and
generating broad appeal. Often
members of a varsity team must
campaign among their friends for
others who are looking for
exercise, competition and some
girls' locker-room camaradarie.
The dozen girls' intramural
basketball teams reflect this
enthusiasm and the organizational
effort Karen Cartwright has
personally directed toward the
sport this year. She is on the
varsity team and officiates at
intramurals. She noted that half
of the intramural teams have
members of the varsity team as
either captains or players.
Referring to the Daily's overall
coverage of girl's athletics,

Cartwright said, "The men's
sports page tends to make a joke
of women's sports. They use it as
comic relief for the boys." She is
now "reluctant" to have men over
WRA activities and the result has
been an almost complete lack of
reporting on women's events.
Diaz, the WRA advisor, is a
strong advocate of co-ed
intramurals as a partial remedy for
the meager 100 to 200 girl turn
out for WRA events.
"You can expect boys to pull
girls out to play because they
need them," she said.
Need for Sanctuary
She was equally emphatic in
insisting that it is important to
retain all-girl teams on this
male-dominated campus. She
referred to the physical education
classes as something of a
"sanctuary" and agreed that there
is a definite need for encouraging
girls to establish group friendships
through athletics.
Dutch Fehring, who oversees
men's intramurals and the Club
Sports program, also anticipates
the coming of more co-ed sports.
He notes that women have
requested and enjoyed a very
limited participation in men's
events where there is no program
for girls. In the past, girls have run
in men's cross-country races and
competed against each other in
track and field events with the
understanding that should they
place, they could not score
intramural points.
Fencing Club is the only one of
the 15 Club Sports under
Fehring's auspices with a female
manager. Each club determines its
own membership eligibility
requirements. Several are co-ed
and the rest are all-male. There are
no all-female club sports.
No Football
Last fall Fehring had to ask
girls to leave the field as they
attempted to participate in men's
intramural touch football. Later,
his assistants were instructed to
escort girls off the courts during a
basketball game. He stressed that
six highly motivated girls
trying to crash men's intramurals
hardly constituted a mass
movement.
A half dozen of the male team
managers advanced the argument,
"they live with us, why can't they
play with us." But, said Fehring,
more of the men said they would
"rather not" have girls involved.
