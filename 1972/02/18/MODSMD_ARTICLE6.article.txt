## Stanford 'Police' Debacle 
### 
For several years the Stanford Police
Department has regularly violated California
Vehicle Code sections regulating emergency
vehicles and Penal Code sections prohibiting
"impersonation of officers." Yesterday, the
police department and the administrators
who control it began to comply with the
law. Also yesterday, the Santa Clara County
Sheriffs Office began to enforce laws on
campus which it should have applied to
Stanford years ago.
After investigation by the Daily
demonstrated that the University police
violated the law, police chief Marvin
Herrington, Special Assistant to the
President John Schwartz, and Legal Advisor
to the President James Siena have ordered
the Stanford department to change its red
emergency lights to amber caution lights,
and to remove the word "police" from cars,
badges, shoulder patches, and the like.
Presumably, the Stanford department will
soon be designated by another, less
deceptive word.
All of this would be unimportant -
technical law violations — except that
Stanford officers are not trained to drive
under emergency conditions. Other law
enforcement officers receive instruction on
laws and departmental regulation which
govern driving with emergency equipment,
but Stanford officers drive untrained.
Indeed, Stanford officers have demonstrated
their driving incompetence on many
occasions, as students who have almost been
hit by speeding police vehicles and Sheriffs
deputies who have been tempted to cite
Stanford policemen for their dangerous
emergency driving will testify.
On Wednesday, Stanford officers wore
badges reading "Stanford Police," with
"State of California" in a circle on the
inside of the badge. These badges violated
penal code sections 146 c and 146 d, and,
when used to arrest, detain, or intimidate,

constituted a violation of section 146 a.
As most Stanford students realize, the
Stanford "police" are in reality no more
than security officers, and have no special
powers to arrest, order, or detain.
Unfortunately, Stanford policemen often
remain unaware of this distinction, and have
detained and intimidated citizens unlawfully.
Hopefully, a change in the name of
Stanford's public safety operation will also
produce an increased awareness of the legal
powers of its officers.
Responsibility for these penal code and
vehicle code offenses lies not with the men
wearing badges and driving cars without
permits, but with the University officials
and legal advisors who forced officers to
violate the law. Either by negligence,
through ignorance of the law, or by design
and conspiracy, with an understanding of
the law, Stanford's administrators have
provided officers with the apparel and
equipment to falsely represent themselves as
public officers.
Stanford has been negotiating with the
Sheriffs Office in an attempt to obtain
peace officer status for men employed and
controlled by the Administration. If these
negotiations prove successful, the University
may legally re-equip its officers.
We agree in part with President Lyman -
Stanford is not served by a police force
trained for and attuned to University
problems, and the present situation is
intolerable. The University requires
complete police services, whether provided
by the Sheriffs Office, the Palo Alto police
department, a special police district, or by
peace officers operationally controlled by
the administration. We do not know which
alternative would be best, but we know
complete, sensitive law enforcement services
must be provided as soon as possible on
campus.

to the President James Siena have ordered
the Stanford department to change its red
emergency lights to amber caution lights,
and to remove the word "police" from cars,
badges, shoulder patches, and the like.
Presumably, the Stanford department will
soon be designated by another, less
deceptive word.
All of this would be unimportant -
technical law violations — except that
Stanford officers are not trained to drive
under emergency conditions. Other law
enforcement officers receive instruction on
laws and departmental regulation which
govern driving with emergency equipment,
but Stanford officers drive untrained.
Indeed, Stanford officers have demonstrated
their driving incompetence on many
occasions, as students who have almost been
hit by speeding police vehicles and Sheriffs
deputies who have been tempted to cite
Stanford policemen for their dangerous
emergency driving will testify.
On Wednesday, Stanford officers wore
badges reading "Stanford Police," with
"State of California" in a circle on the
inside of the badge. These badges violated
penal code sections 146 c and 146 d, and,
when used to arrest, detain, or intimidate,

constituted a violation of section 146 a.
As most Stanford students realize, the
Stanford "police" are in reality no more
than security officers, and have no special
powers to arrest, order, or detain.
Unfortunately, Stanford policemen often
remain unaware of this distinction, and have
detained and intimidated citizens unlawfully.
Hopefully, a change in the name of
Stanford's public safety operation will also
produce an increased awareness of the legal
powers of its officers.
Responsibility for these penal code and
vehicle code offenses lies not with the men
wearing badges and driving cars without
permits, but with the University officials
and legal advisors who forced officers to
violate the law. Either by negligence,
through ignorance of the law, or by design
and conspiracy, with an understanding of
the law, Stanford's administrators have
provided officers with the apparel and
equipment to falsely represent themselves as
public officers.
Stanford has been negotiating with the
Sheriffs Office in an attempt to obtain
peace officer status for men employed and
controlled by the Administration. If these
negotiations prove successful, the University
may legally re-equip its officers.
We agree in part with President Lyman -
Stanford is not served by a police force
trained for and attuned to University
problems, and the present situation is
intolerable. The University requires
complete police services, whether provided
by the Sheriffs Office, the Palo Alto police
department, a special police district, or by
peace officers operationally controlled by
the administration. We do not know which
alternative would be best, but we know
complete, sensitive law enforcement services
must be provided as soon as possible on
campus.
For several years the Stanford Police
Department has regularly violated California
Vehicle Code sections regulating emergency
vehicles and Penal Code sections prohibiting
"impersonation of officers." Yesterday, the
police department and the administrators
who control it began to comply with the
law. Also yesterday, the Santa Clara County
Sheriffs Office began to enforce laws on
campus which it should have applied to
Stanford years ago.
After investigation by the Daily
demonstrated that the University police
violated the law, police chief Marvin
Herrington, Special Assistant to the
President John Schwartz, and Legal Advisor
to the President James Siena have ordered
the Stanford department to change its red
emergency lights to amber caution lights,
and to remove the word "police" from cars,
badges, shoulder patches, and the like.
