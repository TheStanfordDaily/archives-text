Open Letter to Daniel Bershader:
On behalf of the Stanford
Community, and the undersigned
organizations in particular, we
request that the Academic
Council undertake an
examination of the role and
activist of William Shockley as a
professor at Stanford University.
We feel that the need for such
an examination is urgent and
appropriate in light of several
recent developments. We draw
your attention specifically to the
following:
1. It has become apparent that
Shockley's theories about racial
genetics are preventing him from
competently fulfilling his duties in
the classroom as a member of the
Stanford faculty;
2. The effect of Shockley's
inability to function as a
fair-minded professor has not only

caused grave difficulty—even
personal trauma—at Stanford, but
has had international
repercussions.
3. Significantly, members of
the American Physical Society
have elected to disavow "any
professional support for William
Shockley in the promulgation of
his racist theories."
The above developments, plus
others, call for a formal
examination by the Council into
Shockley's continued presence on
campus. This examination should
commence immediately before
Shockley's membership on the
Stanford faculty becomes any
more embarrassing to the
University, before any more
students are injured by his
incompetence and unfairness, and
before he takes further advantage
of his exalted position as a

tenured faculty member to flaunt
his ill-conceived ideas.
We would appreciate a reply as
quickly as possible as to whether
the Academic Council will
undertake the requested
examination.

Fair Policy
Editor, THE DAILY:
I am a grad student who uses
Placement Center facilities. I've
talked to "war related" companies

because I wish to find out for
myself what they are doing and
make my own moral judgment of
any job activity I might be
offered. This is not a legal
question to be decided by others,
since all businesses recruiting at
Stanford are operating within the
law of the land.
The only fair policy Stanford
can follow on this issue is to
protect my freedom of choice.
Dave Josephson and his followers
should be urging me to choose as
they would. Instead, they demand
that Stanford deny me
information and opportunity in
some areas while providing
assistance in other jobs. I too,
could fast or be obstructive to
make my point, but I would not
respect an administration which
made decisions on that basis.
