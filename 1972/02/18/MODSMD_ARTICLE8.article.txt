# 'disruption proofing'
## Special System Protects Lecturers 
### 
The Department of Human
Biology provided three of its
professors to the Faculty
Advisory Board last quarter. As a
human biology major, I have had
the dubious distinction this
quarter of having some of my
morning classes disrupted:
Hamburg once, Dornbusch twice.
Now with the interruptions of
Professor Shockley's class, it
seems this tactic has become an
established part of the campus
radical repertoire. If these
professors' manifest wish is to
deliver their planned lectures,
then we certainly have a conflict
on our hands.

I mentioned this subject to an
Industrial Engineering/Systems
Analysis major friend of mine the
other day, and he immediately
began working on a solution.
According to my friend, the
problem calls for devising some
means of conducting lecture
classes that are totally 'disruption
proof.' His answer, costly and
impractical as it may be, is
frightening by virtue of its totally
repressive nature.
Only you can the judge;
herewith my friend's solution:
Every student registering for a
large lecture course will receive 11
pre-stamped envelopes in his reg
packet. There is one for each
week of the quarter, plus one
extra (whose purpose will be
explained later).
The students are further
required to make a $10 deposit to
the University for each large
course in which they enroll. This
deposit will be refunded along
with the course grade in the
following quarter's packet.
Apparently, the purpose of the
above device is to test the
students' threshold level of
sacrifice and commitment, thus
presuming to put classroom
disruptions out of economic
reach.
Back to the envelopes—each
one is to be numbered and
self-addressed by the student,
then dropped off at the
department office of the course to
be taken. These will then be sent
back to those enrolled students,
one a week, indicating the
location of the class for that
week.
Here, the assumption is that
one cannot disrupt a class that
one cannot locate. Of course, as a
consequence, much of the time
schedule will become obsolete
beyond the first week of each
quarter.
My friend encountered a snag

at this point: knowing how
students are wont to cast most
paper matter to the winds, such
information could get into the
wrong hands.
One could stamp every
envelope TOP SECRET but since
it is 'in' this season to reveal
classified information to the
public, such a solution seems of
limited value.
Coding the class locations
would be a possibility but one
encounters the risk of someone
breaking the code. At last my
friend solved his quandary—the
locations are typed in a special ink
that combusts in the presence of
air.
Imagine—you open your
hermetically sealed envelope, read
the location of your class for that
week, and thirty seconds later, the
paper bursts into smokeless flame.
Clean and simple. . . .
.. .But not failproof. Should
any unauthorized student break
this first-line defense, Phase Two
will certainly deter him from his
disruption-bent goals:
Each enrolled student enters
the classroom to find a large TV
screen suspended from the ceiling.
At the start of the hour, the
screen lights up with the face of
the professor.
Rather than the professor
being in another room making a
simultaneous transmission (too
inviting for sabotage), each lecture
is pre-recorded. The real beauty of
Phase Two is the engineering of
the TV screen itself.
It is attached to the roof of the
auditorium by unbreakable
titanium supports, and inclined at
an angle pre-tested for easy
viewing. Design features include a
wire mesh cage protecting the
screen from breaking by
projectiles hurled from the floor.
This mesh is electrified at 25
million volts to serve a two-fold
purpose of both deterring

jerry coleman

tampering with the screen and
instantly melting any tomatoes,
eggs, or pies thrown from the
audience.
The volume will be kept on full
(just below the ear drum rupture
level) in order to be heard above
any unfriendly comments made
by students.
As you can see, this plan covers
most any contingency or
unexpected situation. It is not
without its flaws though, and has
already received some criticism
from student groups on a major
point.
Although designed to prevent
unwanted comments from the
audience, this system also
prevents concerned and responsive
questioning of any sort. The
smiling face of the professor on
the overhead screen remains
oblivious to relevant student
input.
At last, the secret of the 11th
envelope is revealed—two weeks
before the final exam, students
are allowed to write their
questions on lecture material on a
single piece of binder paper, place
the sheet in the envelope and
drop it off at the department
office.
Some time during dead week
each student will receive his
personalized copy of the answers
to selected questions.
Such is the complete text of
my friend's plan to create
'disruption proof' classes. The
newly formed President's
Committee on Improbable Ideas
has been considering the details in
special sessions held last month.
The full plan was only released
to the public today so as to
minimize popular reaction from
biasing the committee.

human biology major, I have had
the dubious distinction this
quarter of having some of my
morning classes disrupted:
Hamburg once, Dornbusch twice.
Now with the interruptions of
Professor Shockley's class, it
seems this tactic has become an
established part of the campus
radical repertoire. If these
professors' manifest wish is to
deliver their planned lectures,
then we certainly have a conflict
on our hands.

I mentioned this subject to an
Industrial Engineering/Systems
Analysis major friend of mine the
other day, and he immediately
began working on a solution.
According to my friend, the
problem calls for devising some
means of conducting lecture
classes that are totally 'disruption
proof.' His answer, costly and
impractical as it may be, is
frightening by virtue of its totally
repressive nature.
Only you can the judge;
herewith my friend's solution:
Every student registering for a
large lecture course will receive 11
pre-stamped envelopes in his reg
packet. There is one for each
week of the quarter, plus one
extra (whose purpose will be
explained later).
The students are further
required to make a $10 deposit to
the University for each large
course in which they enroll. This
deposit will be refunded along
with the course grade in the
following quarter's packet.
Apparently, the purpose of the
above device is to test the
students' threshold level of
sacrifice and commitment, thus
presuming to put classroom
disruptions out of economic
reach.
Back to the envelopes—each
one is to be numbered and
self-addressed by the student,
then dropped off at the
department office of the course to
be taken. These will then be sent
back to those enrolled students,
one a week, indicating the
location of the class for that
week.
Here, the assumption is that
one cannot disrupt a class that
one cannot locate. Of course, as a
consequence, much of the time
schedule will become obsolete
beyond the first week of each
quarter.
My friend encountered a snag

at this point: knowing how
students are wont to cast most
paper matter to the winds, such
information could get into the
wrong hands.
One could stamp every
envelope TOP SECRET but since
it is 'in' this season to reveal
classified information to the
public, such a solution seems of
limited value.
Coding the class locations
would be a possibility but one
encounters the risk of someone
breaking the code. At last my
friend solved his quandary—the
locations are typed in a special ink
that combusts in the presence of
air.
Imagine—you open your
hermetically sealed envelope, read
the location of your class for that
week, and thirty seconds later, the
paper bursts into smokeless flame.
Clean and simple. . . .
.. .But not failproof. Should
any unauthorized student break
this first-line defense, Phase Two
will certainly deter him from his
disruption-bent goals:
Each enrolled student enters
the classroom to find a large TV
screen suspended from the ceiling.
At the start of the hour, the
screen lights up with the face of
the professor.
Rather than the professor
being in another room making a
simultaneous transmission (too
inviting for sabotage), each lecture
is pre-recorded. The real beauty of
Phase Two is the engineering of
the TV screen itself.
It is attached to the roof of the
auditorium by unbreakable
titanium supports, and inclined at
an angle pre-tested for easy
viewing. Design features include a
wire mesh cage protecting the
screen from breaking by
projectiles hurled from the floor.
This mesh is electrified at 25
million volts to serve a two-fold
purpose of both deterring

jerry coleman

tampering with the screen and
instantly melting any tomatoes,
eggs, or pies thrown from the
audience.
The volume will be kept on full
(just below the ear drum rupture
level) in order to be heard above
any unfriendly comments made
by students.
As you can see, this plan covers
most any contingency or
unexpected situation. It is not
without its flaws though, and has
already received some criticism
from student groups on a major
point.
Although designed to prevent
unwanted comments from the
audience, this system also
prevents concerned and responsive
questioning of any sort. The
smiling face of the professor on
the overhead screen remains
oblivious to relevant student
input.
At last, the secret of the 11th
envelope is revealed—two weeks
before the final exam, students
are allowed to write their
questions on lecture material on a
single piece of binder paper, place
the sheet in the envelope and
drop it off at the department
office.
Some time during dead week
each student will receive his
personalized copy of the answers
to selected questions.
Such is the complete text of
my friend's plan to create
'disruption proof' classes. The
newly formed President's
Committee on Improbable Ideas
has been considering the details in
special sessions held last month.
The full plan was only released
to the public today so as to
minimize popular reaction from
biasing the committee.

Now with the interruptions of
Professor Shockley's class, it
seems this tactic has become an
established part of the campus
radical repertoire. If these
professors' manifest wish is to
deliver their planned lectures,
then we certainly have a conflict
on our hands.

I mentioned this subject to an
Industrial Engineering/Systems
Analysis major friend of mine the
other day, and he immediately
began working on a solution.
According to my friend, the
problem calls for devising some
means of conducting lecture
classes that are totally 'disruption
proof.' His answer, costly and
impractical as it may be, is
frightening by virtue of its totally
repressive nature.
Only you can the judge;
herewith my friend's solution:
Every student registering for a
large lecture course will receive 11
pre-stamped envelopes in his reg
packet. There is one for each
week of the quarter, plus one
extra (whose purpose will be
explained later).
The students are further
required to make a $10 deposit to
the University for each large
course in which they enroll. This
deposit will be refunded along
with the course grade in the
following quarter's packet.
Apparently, the purpose of the
above device is to test the
students' threshold level of
sacrifice and commitment, thus
presuming to put classroom
disruptions out of economic
reach.
Back to the envelopes—each
one is to be numbered and
self-addressed by the student,
then dropped off at the
department office of the course to
be taken. These will then be sent
back to those enrolled students,
one a week, indicating the
location of the class for that
week.
Here, the assumption is that
one cannot disrupt a class that
one cannot locate. Of course, as a
consequence, much of the time
schedule will become obsolete
beyond the first week of each
quarter.
My friend encountered a snag

at this point: knowing how
students are wont to cast most
paper matter to the winds, such
information could get into the
wrong hands.
One could stamp every
envelope TOP SECRET but since
it is 'in' this season to reveal
classified information to the
public, such a solution seems of
limited value.
Coding the class locations
would be a possibility but one
encounters the risk of someone
breaking the code. At last my
friend solved his quandary—the
locations are typed in a special ink
that combusts in the presence of
air.
Imagine—you open your
hermetically sealed envelope, read
the location of your class for that
week, and thirty seconds later, the
paper bursts into smokeless flame.
Clean and simple. . . .
.. .But not failproof. Should
any unauthorized student break
this first-line defense, Phase Two
will certainly deter him from his
disruption-bent goals:
Each enrolled student enters
the classroom to find a large TV
screen suspended from the ceiling.
At the start of the hour, the
screen lights up with the face of
the professor.
Rather than the professor
being in another room making a
simultaneous transmission (too
inviting for sabotage), each lecture
is pre-recorded. The real beauty of
Phase Two is the engineering of
the TV screen itself.
It is attached to the roof of the
auditorium by unbreakable
titanium supports, and inclined at
an angle pre-tested for easy
viewing. Design features include a
wire mesh cage protecting the
screen from breaking by
projectiles hurled from the floor.
This mesh is electrified at 25
million volts to serve a two-fold
purpose of both deterring

tampering with the screen and
instantly melting any tomatoes,
eggs, or pies thrown from the
audience.
The volume will be kept on full
(just below the ear drum rupture
level) in order to be heard above
any unfriendly comments made
by students.
As you can see, this plan covers
most any contingency or
unexpected situation. It is not
without its flaws though, and has
already received some criticism
from student groups on a major
point.
Although designed to prevent
unwanted comments from the
audience, this system also
prevents concerned and responsive
questioning of any sort. The
smiling face of the professor on
the overhead screen remains
oblivious to relevant student
input.
At last, the secret of the 11th
envelope is revealed—two weeks
before the final exam, students
are allowed to write their
questions on lecture material on a
single piece of binder paper, place
the sheet in the envelope and
drop it off at the department
office.
Some time during dead week
each student will receive his
personalized copy of the answers
to selected questions.
Such is the complete text of
my friend's plan to create
'disruption proof' classes. The
newly formed President's
Committee on Improbable Ideas
has been considering the details in
special sessions held last month.
The full plan was only released
to the public today so as to
minimize popular reaction from
biasing the committee.
