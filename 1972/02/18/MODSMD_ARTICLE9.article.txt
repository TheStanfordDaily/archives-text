## Freshmen Need Screening 
### 
Charles s. weaver

The local radicals, fasters, and
other individuals are attempting
to prevent the use of the
Placement Center for recruiting
by the Military and equally evil
corporations that conduct large
volumes of business with the
Department of Defense. The
protesters object to this use of a
campus facility because Stanford

should not provide a service to
such sinister organizations.
The radical viewpoint is
myopic to the extreme. The value
of the Placement Center service is
trivial when compared to the
value of the Stanford-trained
employee. The radicals should
cease attacking the tip of the
iceberg and work to prevent any

of these sinister organizations
from ever using any training that
was obtained on the Stanford
Campus.
Most students will spend all of
their professional life (40 or 50
years) away from the campus, and
thus they will not be subjected to
our continuing enlightened public
debate on the evils of the
Department of Defense and its
subcontractors. They will soon
forget which corporations are
sinister, and the graduates will be
unaware when new corporations
are added to the campus list. Once
off the campus, many eventually
may make a career decision and
go to work for General Dynamics.
Since the Placement Center needs
to be blockaded, there obviously
are some students considering a
career at General Dynamics even
before they have left Stanford.
Therefore it will be necessary

to require all incoming freshmen
to sign a binding agreement not to
work for the military or any
corporation that is judged
unworthy by University screening
procedures. The agreement would
be enforced throughout the
lifetime of the student.
Special problems will be faced
by the alumnus when after a
career of many years in a
corporation, the corporation is
suddenly declared to be on the
sinister list. Logically the alumnus
should immediately resign. Since
this could frequently cause great
hardship, the University in all
fairness must be prepared to
provide financial support for these
unemployed alumni while they
are seeking new positions.
