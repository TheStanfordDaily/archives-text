# Amsterdam Wins Case
## Death Penalty Ruling Praised 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Law Professor Anthony Amsterdam said Friday
that the State Supreme Court's abolition of the
death penalty as unconstitutional was "the first
recognition that the evolution of civilized standards
of decency in contemporary society has come to
condemn death as a penalty for crime."
The court ruled 6-1 Thursday that capital
punishment was both "cruel" and "unusual" and
thus prohibited by the state's constitution. The
ruling was made on the case of Robert Page
Anderson, convicted of murder, attempted murder,
and first degree robbery. It was Amsterdam who
argued Anderson's case before the high court in
January.
At a press conference in Bowman Alumni House,
Amsterdam said:
"It is, I think, particularly encouraging that in a
time when the rhetoric of violence is heard loudly
on both sides of the political spectrum, and as much
from those who would defend law and order as
defeat it, that the California Supreme Court has
been able to see through the rhetoric of violence
and perform its obligation under the state
constitution."
Federal Decision?
The United States Supreme Court is also
considering the constitutionality of the death
penalty. Amsterdam also argued against the penalty
before it last month. Friday he said it would be
"foolhardy" to now predict what the U.S. Supreme
Court's ruling will be, based on the California
decision. But he added that since the wording

between the state and federal constitutions on
punishment is so close, the state's decision will be
"relevant" and "hopefully persuasive" to the federal
court.
(The California Constitution forbids "cruel or
unusual punishment" while the federal constitution
forbids "cruel and unusual punishment.")
Paul Halvonik, director of the Northern
California Chapter of the ACLU, also present at the
press conference, noted that the California Supreme
Court was "probably the most prestigious in the
country" and that its ruling by such a convincing
margin "certainly has to have some impact on the
U.S. Supreme Court."
Jerome Falk, a San Francisco lawyer who was a
co-counsel with Amsterdam in the Anderson case,
claimed that the abolition of the death penalty
would save the state hundreds of millions of dollars
even over a very short time because of the great
expense of lengthy capital trials. "This has to be a
happy day for anyone who truly cares about law
and order and the administration of justice," he
commented.
Reagan Speaks
Governor Ronald Reagan reacted to the court's
decision charging that the court had "set itself
above the will of the people" and had made
California "less safe." In response to Reagan's
comments Amsterdam said:
"This is the kind of vicious and unreasoning
rhetoric that can be expected from a political
demagogue. The decision of the California Supreme
Court is within its proper function and

responsibility to enforce a constitution which
preserves the rights of individuals against abusive
legislative actions.
"The California Supreme Court does not sit, and
in this case did not sit as a super legislature . . . What
it did was its inescapable job to interpret a
constitutional document which is the safeguard of
all of us, and if and when the courts abnegate that
responsibility and if and when our civil liberties are
turned over to political demagogues, then this state
and country will be less safe than they are today."
One newsman asked Amsterdam what you say to
the wife of a policemen who has been slain.
Amsterdam replied, "you say that to take life is an
atrocity and that all of us deeply sympathize and
grieve with the loss of any human life. And that we
reaffirm our belief in the value of all life by taking a
step which announces that it is no more right for
the state than any other individual to take a human
life."
Killing Abhorrent
"Killing is abhorrent, the murder of a policeman
is abhorrent, and capital punishment for the same
reasons is abhorrent," he added.
Amsterdam also said Friday that the only way
for the death penalty to be reimposed in the state is
by a constitutional amendment deleting the "cruel
or unusual punishment" clause from the state
constitution.
He also said that the U.S. Supreme Court could
not overturn the case because the California court
had based its ruling on the state and not the federal
constitution.

LEGAL EAGLES—Law professor Anthony Amsterdam argued the case that
caused the State Supreme Court to outlaw the death penalty. The victory
climaxed a long fight by the attorney to repeal capital punishment. He has also
argued the issue before the U.S. Supreme Court. Amsterdam and Jerome Falk, a
co-counsel in the death penalty case, are currently representing the Daily in its
case against the Palo Alto police over a search of the paper's office and files last
spring.

Anderson, convicted of murder, attempted murder,
and first degree robbery. It was Amsterdam who
argued Anderson's case before the high court in
January.
At a press conference in Bowman Alumni House,
Amsterdam said:
"It is, I think, particularly encouraging that in a
time when the rhetoric of violence is heard loudly
on both sides of the political spectrum, and as much
from those who would defend law and order as
defeat it, that the California Supreme Court has
been able to see through the rhetoric of violence
and perform its obligation under the state
constitution."
Federal Decision?
The United States Supreme Court is also
considering the constitutionality of the death
penalty. Amsterdam also argued against the penalty
before it last month. Friday he said it would be
"foolhardy" to now predict what the U.S. Supreme
Court's ruling will be, based on the California
decision. But he added that since the wording

between the state and federal constitutions on
punishment is so close, the state's decision will be
"relevant" and "hopefully persuasive" to the federal
court.
(The California Constitution forbids "cruel or
unusual punishment" while the federal constitution
forbids "cruel and unusual punishment.")
Paul Halvonik, director of the Northern
California Chapter of the ACLU, also present at the
press conference, noted that the California Supreme
Court was "probably the most prestigious in the
country" and that its ruling by such a convincing
margin "certainly has to have some impact on the
U.S. Supreme Court."
Jerome Falk, a San Francisco lawyer who was a
co-counsel with Amsterdam in the Anderson case,
claimed that the abolition of the death penalty
would save the state hundreds of millions of dollars
even over a very short time because of the great
expense of lengthy capital trials. "This has to be a
happy day for anyone who truly cares about law
and order and the administration of justice," he
commented.
Reagan Speaks
Governor Ronald Reagan reacted to the court's
decision charging that the court had "set itself
above the will of the people" and had made
California "less safe." In response to Reagan's
comments Amsterdam said:
"This is the kind of vicious and unreasoning
rhetoric that can be expected from a political
demagogue. The decision of the California Supreme
Court is within its proper function and

responsibility to enforce a constitution which
preserves the rights of individuals against abusive
legislative actions.
"The California Supreme Court does not sit, and
in this case did not sit as a super legislature . . . What
it did was its inescapable job to interpret a
constitutional document which is the safeguard of
all of us, and if and when the courts abnegate that
responsibility and if and when our civil liberties are
turned over to political demagogues, then this state
and country will be less safe than they are today."
One newsman asked Amsterdam what you say to
the wife of a policemen who has been slain.
Amsterdam replied, "you say that to take life is an
atrocity and that all of us deeply sympathize and
grieve with the loss of any human life. And that we
reaffirm our belief in the value of all life by taking a
step which announces that it is no more right for
the state than any other individual to take a human
life."
Killing Abhorrent
"Killing is abhorrent, the murder of a policeman
is abhorrent, and capital punishment for the same
reasons is abhorrent," he added.
Amsterdam also said Friday that the only way
for the death penalty to be reimposed in the state is
by a constitutional amendment deleting the "cruel
or unusual punishment" clause from the state
constitution.
He also said that the U.S. Supreme Court could
not overturn the case because the California court
had based its ruling on the state and not the federal
constitution.

LEGAL EAGLES—Law professor Anthony Amsterdam argued the case that
caused the State Supreme Court to outlaw the death penalty. The victory
climaxed a long fight by the attorney to repeal capital punishment. He has also
argued the issue before the U.S. Supreme Court. Amsterdam and Jerome Falk, a
co-counsel in the death penalty case, are currently representing the Daily in its
case against the Palo Alto police over a search of the paper's office and files last
spring.
Law Professor Anthony Amsterdam said Friday
that the State Supreme Court's abolition of the
death penalty as unconstitutional was "the first
recognition that the evolution of civilized standards
of decency in contemporary society has come to
condemn death as a penalty for crime."
The court ruled 6-1 Thursday that capital
punishment was both "cruel" and "unusual" and
thus prohibited by the state's constitution. The
ruling was made on the case of Robert Page
Anderson, convicted of murder, attempted murder,
and first degree robbery. It was Amsterdam who
argued Anderson's case before the high court in
