# Ho Defense Testimony Continues
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Several points of conflicting
prosecution and defense
testimony were raised during the
Campus Judicial Panel hearings
Friday and Saturday on charges
relating to Kwonping Ho's actions
during an "eat-in" at the Faculty
Club January 24.
Ho has been charged with
entering the Faculty Club kitchen
"for the purpose of stealing food"
and assaulting Faculty Club
Executive Chef Arturo Lionetti in
violation of the Fundamental
Standard.
The testimony, which varied
on whether Ho entered the
Faculty Club kitchen himself or
encouraged others to do so, dealt
with his behavior at the double
doors (also referred to as the
hallway doors) between the
Faculty Club's main dining room
and the hallway running past the
club's kitchen (see accompanying
diagram).
Law Professor Jack
Friedenthal, the final prosecution
witness, testified that Ho and two
others, while trying to push
through the hallway doors,

periodicaly turned around and
encouraged others to come over
by gesturing and saying things like
"The food is in this place! Let's
get the food!"
Witnesses Disagree
However defense witnesses
disagreed. KZSU News Director
Pete Williams aid that others
mentioned food, but Ho did not.
"It seems to me," Williams said,
"that if he had said something like
that, I think I would have heard
it." Economics graduate student
Clemente Foraro, who had also
been pushing on the hallway
doors, was sure Ho did not say
"Come on over here to the
kitchen."
Concerning the assault,
Friedenthal said he did not see Ho
elbow Lionetti, but concluded
that it was possible because
"Lionetti was right there and
Lionetti sticks out!"
Williams testified that he saw
no pushing or shoving at the
hallway doors and Forero claimed
that if someone had come in
contact with Lionetti he would
have seen it.
The most controversial

testimony disputed whether Ho
ever entered the kitchen or not.
Friedenthal claimed that he
actually saw Ho enter the kitchen
among the first group that went
in. Friedenthal also said, "I saw
people taking food of various
kinds" while he was in the
kitchen, and said he saw Ho at
least once inside the kitchen with
some bread in his hands.
Williams saw no one enter the
kitchen, but conceded it was
possible that Ho moved into the
kitchen before he got there.
Forero testified that he never saw
Ho go into the kitchen, and said
that, as he and Ho were standing
outside the kitchen, Friedenthal
came out of the kitchen and
headed further down the hallway
to the exit door, which Faculty
Club Manager Forrest Tregea was
attempting to lock despite
resistance by protesters.
German students Dorothy
Rosenberg and Betsy Elich both
stated that Ho never entered the
kitchen but walked directly past it
and turned down the hallway
looking for the exit door. Elich
added that Ho could not have
gone into the kitchen before
turning the corner, and Rosenberg
said that Ho proceeded further
down the hallway in the direction
of the lobby rather than coming
back toward the kitchen. Williams
also acknowledged seeing Ho at
the end of the hallway near the
lobby.
In regard to Ho's intention for
originally going through the
hallway doors, freshman Rosie
Wolf explained that she and Ho
went into the dining room looking
for exits in case there was a need
for quick dispersal. She recalled

Ho pointing to the hallway doors,
over which there is an exit sign,
and saying "I bet those doors lead
to the back door. I wonder if it
[the back door] is locked."
Looking for Exit
Forero felt that when Ho
reached the hallway doors, he was
more concerned with finding an
exit from the Faculty Club than
with entering the kitchen.
Special Assistant to the
President John Schyvartz, who is
prosecuting the case for the
Administration, once again denied
the defense request of immunity
for their witnesses, but did say,
"The University will not bring
charges against any other students
as a result of this incident."
Schwartz explained this apparent
contradiction by saying that
witnesses were still not immune
from charges relating to other
incidents.
The Fundamental Standard
which Ho is accused of violating,
states that "Students are expected
to show both within and without
the University such respect for
order, morality, personal honor,
and the rights of others as is
demanded of good citizens.
Failure to observe this will be
sufficient cause for removal from
the University."
The prosecution, the defense,
and Hearing Officer Leslie Minkus
meet today at 9:00 a.m. at Room
83 of the Graduate School of
Business in order to determine
where the hearings will continue.
In probing for possible bias on
the part of Friedenthal, the
defense introduced a Daily photo
which showed Friedenthal,
Schwartz, and CJP Chairman John
Kaplan together at the Faculty
Club subsequent to the incident.
