# Imperialism Meetings Open
## 
### JIM FRIEND 
Paul Sweezy, a leading
American Marxist economist, and
Andreas Papandreou, Greek
opposition politician in exile, will
be participants in a four-day
symposium on imperialism which
begins today.
Sweezy's keynote address on
"Imperialism in the 70's" will be
at 7:30 in Cubberly Auditorium.
Sweezy, as editor of Monthly
Review and co-author (with the
late Paul Baran, Stanford
professor of economics) of
Monopoly Capital, was a major
intellectual influence in the New
Left's adoption of Marxian
analysis in the late 1960'5.
Among those participating in
the various discussions are six
Stanford professors (Martin
Carnoy, John Gurley, Alan
Manne, Ronald McKinnon, Tibor
Scitovsky, Lyman Van Slyke) and
one student, former BSU
chairman Mike Dawson.
Jean-Louis Servan Schreiber,
visiting lecturer in the
Communications Department, will
be a panelist in Thursday's
discussion on "U.S. Business
Abroad."
Topics to be discussed in panel
format include "U.S. Business
Abroad: Development or
Exploitation?," "Is Foreign Aid
an Alternative?," and
"Consequences of U.S.

Imperialism in People's Lives."
The main intent of the
symposium, according to it's
organizer, economics graduate
student Bill Behn, is
"educational." Behn says that he
has structured the four-day
symposium with the hope of
reaching those persons who are
"interested but confused" about
the usage of the term imperialism,
but find that the word gives them
a "funny feeling."
Asked whether the symposium
includes only radicals among the
speakers, Behn pointed to three
panel discussions, "Asia in the
70'5.," "U.S. Business Abroad,"
and "Is Foreign Aid an
Alternative?," as having a broad
spectrum of views. He says that an
effort has been made here to
"construct a dialogue between
radicals and non-radicals" in order
to allow the audience an
opportunity to "make clearer
analyses of the validity of the
different perspectives."
