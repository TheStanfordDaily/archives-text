Schawlow Speaks
Professor Arthur L. Schawlow,
one of the world's leading experts
in laser research, will be the first
speaker Wednesday in a new series
of illustrated lectures of "Physics
Today and Tomorrow."
Sponsored by Stanford's
Physics Department and the
University Lecture Committee,
the series "will attempt to show in
non-technical terms what recent
developments have taken place [in
physics] and where the future
may lead."
Schawlow, one of the most
sought-after interpreters of
science for the layman, will speak
at 8 p.m. in the Physics Lecture
Hall. All lectures in the series will
be open to the public.
On April 5, Professor Melvin
Schwartz, a specialist in
high-energy physics investigations
of nuclear particles, will give a
talk entitled "If Time Flowed
Backwards. ..?"
Final series speaker on May 3
will be Prof. William M. Fairbank,

world-renowned expert on
low-temperature physics,
discussing "Near Zero, A Frontier
of Physics."
Dean Named
Civil Engineering Professor
Robert L. Street will take over as
acting dean of the Stanford
School of Engineering March 1,
according to an announcement by
President Richard W. Lyman.
Street has done "an
outstanding job as associate dean
for research" in the school, said
Provost William F. Miller in a
letter to engineering faculty
members. In addition Street serves
as vice chairman of his own
Department of Civil Engineering.
The search for a permanent
dean is proceeding "as quickly as
possible," Miller added, but was
not able to forecast a date for its
completion.
Former Dean Joseph Pettit
announced last October that he
would become president of
Georgia Institute of Technology,
leaving his position open.
