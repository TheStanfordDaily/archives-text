# Stanford Splits In Oregon
## 
### 
Coach Howie Dallmar's cagers
mimicked their previous
weekend's competition with
Oregon schools as they fell to
Oregon State on Friday night
87-62 and rallied to defeat Oregon
the following day by the score of
91-79.
The Oregon State crowd gave
Claude Terry a standing ovation
when the Stanford star passed
Tom Dose to become the Indians'
leading all-time scorer. Terry's 15
points led all Card scorers as the

Beaver defense shut off the
Indians.
Beavers Dominate
The Beavers dominated every
phase of the game and harrassed
the Stanford attack into one of its
worst shooting efforts with a 34
percent accuracy mark. OSU shot
.516 from the floor and was paced
bv Freddie Boyd's 25 points.
Steve Ericksen and Neal
Jurgenson contributed 18 and 17
points to the Beaver total.
Bob Buell and Steve Shupe hit
for 11 and 10 points and reserve
John Stratton finished with nine.
Rebounding from their poor
showing against OSU, the Cards
thrashed cellar dwelling Oregon
on Saturday. With the pressure of
the scoring record relieved, Terry
poured through 36 points to spark
the Card victory. Terry hit on 10
of 12 free throws in his scoring
spree.
The Indians led by only three
points at halftime, 46-43, but

pulled away to a 10 point margin
at 77-67 midway through the
second half.
Winless Ducks
The Ducks, who have not won
a conference game in eight
outings, had 28 fouls called
against them including two
technicals. They were led in the
roughly played game by Doug
Little who netted 20 points. Bill
Ingram and Rusty Blair hit for 19
and 18 points to provide the bulk
of the Oregon scoring along with
Little.
Buell and Shupe each had 14
points for Stanford and Mike
Mann contributed 12. Stratton
had another good game as he and
Bob Nicholson dropped in seven
points for the victorious Indians.
The win over Oregon evened
the Cards' conference record at
5-5, but OSU's victories over Cal
and Stanford vaulted the Beavers
into third place in the Pac-8 race.

ALL ALONE—Claude Terry finds himself free from obstacles as he sails towards the basket against
Oregon two weekends ago at Maples Pavilion. Terry is also all alone at the top of the Stanford all-time
scoring list with 1484 points, having topped Tom Dose's 1441 against Oregon State in Corvallis Friday
night. The senior from Modesto has four more games in which to put his new record farther out of reach.

SUPER SCREEN—Freshman Archie Dean prepares to shoot over 7'o"
center Rich Kelley's screen against USF two weeks ago. Dean, Melvin
Arterberry, Scott Trohbe, and Ben Bluitt are all averaging between 10
and 13 points a game.
