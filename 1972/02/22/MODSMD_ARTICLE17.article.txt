## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
After being embarrassed by the
alumni Friday night, Stanford's
freshman basketball team coasted
to an 81-64 victory over San
Francisco City College Saturday
night at Maples Pavilion.
Rich Kelley scored 19 points
and grabbed 20 rebounds to pace
the frosh against CCSF while Mel
Arterberry and Mike Simons
contributed 18 and 15 points.
Stanford led by only four
points at halftime but three fast

break baskets at the start of the
second half put the game out of
reach. Kelley, Arterberry, and
Simons scored 37 of the Indians'
48 second half points as the frosh
recorded their 13th victory of the
season against 3 losses. CCSF is
now 15-12.
On Friday night the alumni
took advantage of 34 Indian
turnovers to score a 97-94 victory.
Mai McElwain poured in 32 points
to lead the alumni attack.
McElwain. a 1969 graduate, is
17th on the list of all-time

Stanford scorers.
John Arillaga, a 1960 graduate
who is 14th on the career scoring
list, scored 18 points while 1968
graduate Gary Pctersmeyer netted
18 points and was credited with
nine assists.
Stanford held a 19 point lead
midway in the second half when
assistant coach Bob Chastain
pulled his starters. The freshman
substitutes finished the game and
couldn't hold off a spirited alumni
comeback.
Despite their lack of speed, the
alumni played some excellent
basketball. The grads' shooting
was phenomenal at times and they
made up for their height
disadvantage with some aggressive
rebounding and defense. 6'o"
assistant freshman coach Stan
Dowson typified the alumni
hustle by pulling down n'ne
rebounds.
Kelley led the frosh scoring
with 22 points. Ben Bluitt
pumped in 18 points and
Arterberry added 14.
