Three Stanford golfers survived the first two rounds of match play
over the holiday weekend in the San Francisco City Golf
Championships at Harding Park.
Co-medalists Tom Keelin and Bruce Robertson each won twice as
did freshman Dave Baskins. In a stunning upset, defending champion
Gary Vanier was defeated by Mike O'Toole one up.
Two other Stanford players, freshman Conrad Nilmeier and Senior
Jim Dwulett, won their first round matches but were eliminated in
Sunday's second round.
