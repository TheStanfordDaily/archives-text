# Navy To Bar Non-ROTC Schools For Officers' Graduate Studies
## 
### 
Under pressure from the House
Armed Services Committee, the Navy
has prohibited its officers from taking
government financed graduate
programs at Stanford and other
colleges that have phased out ROTC
programs.
The Navy policy came to light last
week when a letter to a congressman
in Massachusetts by Secretary of the
Navy John Chafee was made public.
Chafee said the policy was made in
response to an earlier letter he had
received from Rep. F. Edward Hebert
(D-La.), chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee.
Captain John C. Duck, director of
Navy ROTC here, confirmed that the
policy will go into effect next year.
There are currently about 35 Navy
officers here under a program under
which the Navy pays the officers full
pay and allowances plus tuition.
Most of the officers are in civil
engineering and business, according
to Duck. He said normally the number
of Navy officers entering Stanford
would be 15 or 16 but next year there
will be only three, and these are
exceptions to the policy.
Policy For Other Services?
It is unclear if the policy will apply
to the Army and Air Force officers
attending school here. Major Dennis
Gillem, from the Army ROTC office
here, said the Army ROTC had not
heard "either way" about Army
graduate students but it seemed logical
that the policy would apply to all
services — including the Army and Air
Force.
Lauress Wise, associate dean of the
school of engineering, estimates that
about 100 military students have
attended Stanford annually for the last
several years.

The University first learned of the
policy informally several months ago,
according to Vice Provost Robert
Rosenzweig. The University asked for
confirmation and received a letter
from Chafee explaining Hebert's
position.
The letter quoted from a report of
the House committee on legislation
involving the ROTC: "It is morally
wrong for the military to spend dollars
sending students to a particular college
or university which has chosen not to
cooperate with the military services.
"We do not believe that the fact
that a particular university has an
element of prestige is sufficient reason
for sending a student to a university
which has withdrawn from ROTC,"
the committee said.
Chaffee also quoted a letter from
Hebert, "It is our hope that it will not
be necessary to place a flat prohibition
against sending students to these
universities which have withdrawn
from the ROTC program when we
consider the procurement bill next
year but if it is necessary to legislate
on that subject then legislate we will.
"I am not at this time asking you to
withdraw students prior to the
completion of the program in which
they are enrolled but I am adamant
that no new students will be permitted
to enter such programs at these
universities," Hebert wrote.
Chafee closed his letter saying that
he did not agree with the policy and
he hopes the Navy would be able to
achieve a change in the policy.
'Some Other Way'
Duck said he agreed with Chafee
and said, "We're not really gaining
something [with the policy]. We
would be better if there were some
other way of getting the message
across to these universities."

Duck interpreted Hebert's
statements as saying, "If you won't
stop these people [from attending
those universities] we will."
Rosenzweig told the Palo Alto
Times last week, the policy is "a
pointless kind of self denial on the
part of the government.
"It's not serious from our point of
view," he said, ".. . they don't bring
anything more than tuition as any
other student does ... the advantage is
very largely on the side of the

services . .
Besides Stanford the schools put
off-limits to Navy graduate students
are: Princeton University, Columbia
University, Harvard University, New
York University, Boston University,
Brown University, the State University
of New York at Buffalo, Tufts
University, Dartmouth College, Boston
College, Colgate University, Hobart
and William Smith Colleges, Yale
University, and the Pratt Institute of
Brooklyn.

Under pressure from the House
Armed Services Committee, the Navy
has prohibited its officers from taking
government financed graduate
programs at Stanford and other
colleges that have phased out ROTC
programs.
The Navy policy came to light last
week when a letter to a congressman
in Massachusetts by Secretary of the
Navy John Chafee was made public.
Chafee said the policy was made in
response to an earlier letter he had
received from Rep. F. Edward Hebert
(D-La.), chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee.
Captain John C. Duck, director of
Navy ROTC here, confirmed that the
policy will go into effect next year.
There are currently about 35 Navy
officers here under a program under
which the Navy pays the officers full
pay and allowances plus tuition.
Most of the officers are in civil
engineering and business, according
to Duck. He said normally the number
of Navy officers entering Stanford
would be 15 or 16 but next year there
will be only three, and these are
exceptions to the policy.
Policy For Other Services?
It is unclear if the policy will apply
to the Army and Air Force officers
attending school here. Major Dennis
Gillem, from the Army ROTC office
here, said the Army ROTC had not
heard "either way" about Army
graduate students but it seemed logical
that the policy would apply to all
services — including the Army and Air
Force.
Lauress Wise, associate dean of the
school of engineering, estimates that
about 100 military students have
attended Stanford annually for the last
several years.

The University first learned of the
policy informally several months ago,
according to Vice Provost Robert
Rosenzweig. The University asked for
confirmation and received a letter
from Chafee explaining Hebert's
position.
The letter quoted from a report of
the House committee on legislation
involving the ROTC: "It is morally
wrong for the military to spend dollars
sending students to a particular college
or university which has chosen not to
cooperate with the military services.
"We do not believe that the fact
that a particular university has an
element of prestige is sufficient reason
for sending a student to a university
which has withdrawn from ROTC,"
the committee said.
Chaffee also quoted a letter from
Hebert, "It is our hope that it will not
be necessary to place a flat prohibition
against sending students to these
universities which have withdrawn
from the ROTC program when we
consider the procurement bill next
year but if it is necessary to legislate
on that subject then legislate we will.
"I am not at this time asking you to
withdraw students prior to the
completion of the program in which
they are enrolled but I am adamant
that no new students will be permitted
to enter such programs at these
universities," Hebert wrote.
Chafee closed his letter saying that
he did not agree with the policy and
he hopes the Navy would be able to
achieve a change in the policy.
'Some Other Way'
Duck said he agreed with Chafee
and said, "We're not really gaining
something [with the policy]. We
would be better if there were some
other way of getting the message
across to these universities."

Duck interpreted Hebert's
statements as saying, "If you won't
stop these people [from attending
those universities] we will."
Rosenzweig told the Palo Alto
Times last week, the policy is "a
pointless kind of self denial on the
part of the government.
"It's not serious from our point of
view," he said, ".. . they don't bring
anything more than tuition as any
other student does ... the advantage is
very largely on the side of the

services . .
Besides Stanford the schools put
off-limits to Navy graduate students
are: Princeton University, Columbia
University, Harvard University, New
York University, Boston University,
Brown University, the State University
of New York at Buffalo, Tufts
University, Dartmouth College, Boston
College, Colgate University, Hobart
