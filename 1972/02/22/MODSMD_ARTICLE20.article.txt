Nixon, Mao Meet
PEKING — President Nixon talked
with Chairman Mao Tse-tung in an
unexpected meeting at Mao's home
yesterday only a few hours after
beginning his visit to China.
The hour-long discussion by the
President and the Communist
chairman was described as "frank and
serious" — indicating in Communist
terminology that the talk ended in
fundamental disagreement.
But at a banquet afterward, a warm
atmosphere prevailed in contrast to
the subdued welcome given Nixon in
late morning, and there the President
proposed that China and the United
States begin a long march toward
peace without compromising their
principles of communism and
capitalism.
The meeting with Mao came as a
surprise so early in the visit. It had not
been on Nixon's schedule and it
delayed the first formal meeting with
Premier Chou En-lai.
Although Nixon had been expected
to see Mao during his week-long visit,
no time had been set. There was
speculation that the meeting would
come at the end of the visit.
The President had been greeted by
Chou at the airport on his arrival in
late morning and they met formally in
the afternoon after Nixon's talk with

Mao.
Nixon and Chou toasted each other
at the banquet in the Great Hall of the
People in central Peking.
A Chinese military band played
"America the Beautiful" as Nixon
toasted his hosts with rice wine.
"The American people are a great
people. The Chinese people are a great
people. The people of our two
countries have always been friendly to
each other. But owing to reasons
known to all, the contacts between the
two peoples were suspended for over
20 years," Chou said.
"Now through the common efforts
of China and the United States the
gates to friendly contact have finally
opened."
Nixon's toast concluded, "let us in
these next five days start a long march
together. Not in lock step, but on
different roads leading to the same
goal: a goal of building a world
structure of peace and justice in which
all may stand together with equal
dignity, in which each nation, large or
small, has a right to determine its own
form of government free of outside
interference or domination."
Then he quoted Mao: "So many
deeds cry out to be done and always
urgently . .. Seize the day! Seize the
hour!"
Said Nixon: "This is the hour. This
is the day for our two peoples to rise

to the heights of greatness which can
build a new and better world."
The President's use of the words
"long march" evoked memories of the
"Long March" of 1934 when Mao's
Communist forces, fleeing from the
heavy pressure of Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalist armies, marched 6,000 or
more miles from Kiangsi Province on a
torturous route to Yenan in a remote
area of Shensi Province.
Bail For Angela?
SAN JOSE — Attorneys for Angela
Davis predicted yesterday that the
black revolutionary will be free on bail
tomorrow.
Judge Richard Arnason said he
would rule on the bail matter
tomorrow in light of Friday's
California Supreme Court decision
declaring the death penalty illegal.
Attorney Doris Walker said
Arnason already has found on the
record that Davis is "a good bail risk"
except for a California penal code
section which prohibits bail in capital
cases "when proof of his guilt is
evident or the presumption thereof
great."
Since there are no more capital
offenses, Davis must be released, her
lawyers contend.
She has been in jail since three
months after the August 1970 San
Rafeal courthouse shootout in which
four men, including a judge, were
killed.
