# Class Disruption Charged
## 'Shockley Four' Hearing Opens 
### JIM WASCHER 
The Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) began hearings
yesterday for four students charged with violation of the
Policy on Campus Disruption for entering the class of
Electrical Engineering Professor William Shockley on
January 18.
The four are Venceremos members Don Lee, Alice
Furumoto and Gerry Foote and Third World Liberation
Front member Kwonping Ho. They are alleged by the
Administration to have been among the 16 persons who
entered Shockley's class to protest his theories on the
genetic inferiority of blacks.
CJP Chairman John Kaplan chose Boalt Hall [UC
Berkeley] Law Professor Henry Ramsey as the hearing
officer for the case. After hearing the evidence in the case,
Ramsey will decide whether the facts in the case show
that the four did indeed violate the Policy on Campus
Disruption. Ramsey is the only black of the six hearing
officers whom Kaplan had chosen.
Question Of Jurisdiction
When the hearing began at 9:30 a.m., defense counsel
Zach Wasserman asked Ramsey to rule that he had "no
jurisdiction over this case." He urged that Ramsey find
that "neither he nor the Campus Judicial Panel has
authority to adjudicate" this or any other case.
In denying the motion, Ramsey said he was not "ruling
on the merits" of the motion. Rather, he said, he felt he
was not empowered by CJP procedures to rule on such
motions.
Shockley, the Administration's first witness, said that
at least 12 persons had entered his class last month five
minutes after the class members had begun taking a quiz.
Shockley testified that he had done "my best to indicate"
that the class was being disrupted.
Shockley said he took two pictures of those sitting at

the back of the room and one of a black man standing at
the front reading a statement.
"Anticipating a further disturbance," Shockely said, "I
didn't want to be holding" the pictures so he handed the
pictures to Troy Barbee, Lab Director for the Center for
Material Research. Barbee had been summoned to the
classroom by a McCullough Building secretary.
Shockley said "I take no position on whether I was
encouraging them or not" by talking to them in extended
fashion on what he felt were statements which were
"inaccurate, unwarranted and adverse to the future of
mankind."
Barbee, who was the Administration's second witness,
testified that the black man who had been reading the
statement walked by him and "took the pictures out of
my hand."
'Walked Over'
Barbee said that he followed the demonstrator to the
back of the room to retrieve the pictures. He explained
that when the demonstrator "leaned in my way, I literally
walked over him. But by that time the pictures had been
destroyed." After he had been "walked over," the
demonstrator fell onto a woman sitting in the back row of
the room.
The Lab Director said that he was not aware that the
demonstrator had fallen on the woman until "she gave me
a shot in the back."
When Special Assistant to the President John Schwartz,
the Administration's prosecutor, asked Barbee to identify
the woman from the audience of about 25 persons,
Barbee identified freshman Rosie Wolf. Schwartz then
showed Barbee pictures from past demonstrations out of
which Barbee picked a close-up of defendant Gerry Foote,
identifying her as the woman who had given her the "shot
in the back."

demonstrator had fallen on the woman until "she gave me
a shot in the back."
When Special Assistant to the President John Schwartz,
the Administration's prosecutor, asked Barbee to identify
the woman from the audience of about 25 persons,
Barbee identified freshman Rosie Wolf. Schwartz then
showed Barbee pictures from past demonstrations out of
which Barbee picked a close-up of defendant Gerry Foote,
identifying her as the woman who had given her the "shot
in the back."
The Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) began hearings
yesterday for four students charged with violation of the
Policy on Campus Disruption for entering the class of
Electrical Engineering Professor William Shockley on
January 18.
The four are Venceremos members Don Lee, Alice
Furumoto and Gerry Foote and Third World Liberation
Front member Kwonping Ho. They are alleged by the
Administration to have been among the 16 persons who
entered Shockley's class to protest his theories on the
genetic inferiority of blacks.
CJP Chairman John Kaplan chose Boalt Hall [UC
Berkeley] Law Professor Henry Ramsey as the hearing
officer for the case. After hearing the evidence in the case,
Ramsey will decide whether the facts in the case show
that the four did indeed violate the Policy on Campus
Disruption. Ramsey is the only black of the six hearing
officers whom Kaplan had chosen.
Question Of Jurisdiction
When the hearing began at 9:30 a.m., defense counsel
Zach Wasserman asked Ramsey to rule that he had "no
jurisdiction over this case." He urged that Ramsey find
that "neither he nor the Campus Judicial Panel has
authority to adjudicate" this or any other case.
In denying the motion, Ramsey said he was not "ruling
on the merits" of the motion. Rather, he said, he felt he
was not empowered by CJP procedures to rule on such
motions.
Shockley, the Administration's first witness, said that
at least 12 persons had entered his class last month five
minutes after the class members had begun taking a quiz.
Shockley testified that he had done "my best to indicate"
that the class was being disrupted.
Shockley said he took two pictures of those sitting at

the back of the room and one of a black man standing at
the front reading a statement.
"Anticipating a further disturbance," Shockely said, "I
didn't want to be holding" the pictures so he handed the
pictures to Troy Barbee, Lab Director for the Center for
Material Research. Barbee had been summoned to the
classroom by a McCullough Building secretary.
Shockley said "I take no position on whether I was
encouraging them or not" by talking to them in extended
fashion on what he felt were statements which were
"inaccurate, unwarranted and adverse to the future of
mankind."
Barbee, who was the Administration's second witness,
testified that the black man who had been reading the
statement walked by him and "took the pictures out of
my hand."
'Walked Over'
Barbee said that he followed the demonstrator to the
back of the room to retrieve the pictures. He explained
that when the demonstrator "leaned in my way, I literally
walked over him. But by that time the pictures had been
destroyed." After he had been "walked over," the
demonstrator fell onto a woman sitting in the back row of
the room.
The Lab Director said that he was not aware that the
demonstrator had fallen on the woman until "she gave me
a shot in the back."
