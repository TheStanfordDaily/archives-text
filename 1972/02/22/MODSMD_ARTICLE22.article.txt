# Unity, Ideals Sustain Tired Fasters
## 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
"I never thought I could last this long," declared
Barbara Bishop. She is one of 9even people who
have been fasting for two weeks in support of an
open meeting with President Lyman and moratoria
on recruiting by the military or companies holding
more than $100 million in defense contracts at the
Placement Center and on CJP hearings.
"It's not that hard to do when you have a lot of
people and a cause," Bishop stated. However, the
group may announce an end to the fast at a press
conference today at 10 a.m. in White Plaza.
Although the fasters are weak and tired after two
weeks on juice and water, their morale is high and
their solidarity is impressive. For some, the
experience has had a significant personal impact.
16 Pounds Lost
"I'm feeling pretty good," Ed Jackson said. He
has lost 16 pounds during the fast. "In a personal
sense I've learned a lot about how far our bodies can
really go and how our whole society is so
comfort-oriented."
For Jeff Wright the long fast has "re-emphasized
the wisdom of certain ideals. Being weak like this,
the idea of power politics really seems absurd."
He commented that, "This started as an
expedient political tactic. It's taken on many more
dimensions. It's become sort of a spiritual thing."
Not surprisingly, the protestors' attitude towards

food has changed. They no longer experience it as a
necessity of lffe and express amazement at how
much time people spend eating.
According to Karen Stoneman, "It's really an
experience, taking the whole concept of food and
just putting it aside."
The number of fasters has been diminishing
slowly from a high of 43 and it is difficult to predict
how much longer the demonstration will continue.
"Right now I feel good about it continuing for
quite some time if it's effective," Wright said. He
believes protestors are "much more likely to get
real, tangible results by talking."
Fast's Effectiveness
Has the fast been effective?
"As far as accomplishing the goals we've set out,
no it hasn't," Wright said. "As far as making us
credible in Lyman's eyes, yes."
Some of the fasters talked with the president
over the weekend. "Lyman has a respect for us. I
don't think he's totally cynical when he says he
admires our depth of conviction," Wright said.
"I don't expect the demands to be met
tomorrow," Jackson said. Wright admitted that the
fasters may modify their goals.
Most of the fasters are keeping up with their
classes despite the end of the quarter rush, and
maintaining most of their normal activities.
The first few days without food are the hardest,

Stoneman reports. "I was really light-headed and I
flunked a midterm. Now I'm used to it. It's a way of
life."
The fasters are in constant contact with doctors.
So far, they do not feel their health is threatened
and in some ways they feel it is improved.
Although a tired Dave Josephson, ASSU
Professor of Social Thought, admits to drinking
some soup to "rejuvenate me," the rest of the
fasters subsist on orange or vegetable juice, a lot of
water, and vitamin pills.
A Rest For The Heart
"We aren't planning to wreck our health," Wright
emphasizes. "It's been a tremendous rest for my
heart; it beats about 20 beats a minute slower." He
added, "I feel I've added years to my life by fasting
this way."
Three of the remaining fasters are women. "I
think we're the stronger sex when it comes to
something like this," Stoneman, an experienced
dieter, said. "I don't think I've suffered as much as
the boys. I lose weight very slowly." She has lost
only five pounds.
Fasting may make it hard to concentrate, and
ironically for a group committed to rational
dialogue, it sometimes makes it difficult to talk.
"We tend to slur our words and talk lower and
slower," Bishop noted. "We've noticed that
sometimes only another faster can understand us."
"I never thought I could last this long," declared
Barbara Bishop. She is one of 9even people who
have been fasting for two weeks in support of an

think we're the stronger sex when it comes to
something like this," Stoneman, an experienced
dieter, said. "I don't think I've suffered as much as
the boys. I lose weight very slowly." She has lost
only five pounds.
Fasting may make it hard to concentrate, and
ironically for a group committed to rational
dialogue, it sometimes makes it difficult to talk.
"We tend to slur our words and talk lower and
slower," Bishop noted. "We've noticed that
sometimes only another faster can understand us."
"I never thought I could last this long," declared
Barbara Bishop. She is one of 9even people who
have been fasting for two weeks in support of an
open meeting with President Lyman and moratoria
on recruiting by the military or companies holding
more than $100 million in defense contracts at the
Placement Center and on CJP hearings.
"It's not that hard to do when you have a lot of
people and a cause," Bishop stated. However, the
group may announce an end to the fast at a press
conference today at 10 a.m. in White Plaza.
Although the fasters are weak and tired after two
weeks on juice and water, their morale is high and
their solidarity is impressive. For some, the
experience has had a significant personal impact.
16 Pounds Lost
"I'm feeling pretty good," Ed Jackson said. He
has lost 16 pounds during the fast. "In a personal
sense I've learned a lot about how far our bodies can
really go and how our whole society is so
comfort-oriented."
For Jeff Wright the long fast has "re-emphasized
the wisdom of certain ideals. Being weak like this,
the idea of power politics really seems absurd."
He commented that, "This started as an
expedient political tactic. It's taken on many more
dimensions. It's become sort of a spiritual thing."
Not surprisingly, the protestors' attitude towards

food has changed. They no longer experience it as a
necessity of lffe and express amazement at how
much time people spend eating.
According to Karen Stoneman, "It's really an
experience, taking the whole concept of food and
just putting it aside."
The number of fasters has been diminishing
slowly from a high of 43 and it is difficult to predict
how much longer the demonstration will continue.
"Right now I feel good about it continuing for
quite some time if it's effective," Wright said. He
believes protestors are "much more likely to get
real, tangible results by talking."
Fast's Effectiveness
Has the fast been effective?
"As far as accomplishing the goals we've set out,
no it hasn't," Wright said. "As far as making us
credible in Lyman's eyes, yes."
Some of the fasters talked with the president
over the weekend. "Lyman has a respect for us. I
don't think he's totally cynical when he says he
admires our depth of conviction," Wright said.
"I don't expect the demands to be met
tomorrow," Jackson said. Wright admitted that the
fasters may modify their goals.
Most of the fasters are keeping up with their
classes despite the end of the quarter rush, and
maintaining most of their normal activities.
The first few days without food are the hardest,

Stoneman reports. "I was really light-headed and I
flunked a midterm. Now I'm used to it. It's a way of
life."
The fasters are in constant contact with doctors.
So far, they do not feel their health is threatened
and in some ways they feel it is improved.
Although a tired Dave Josephson, ASSU
Professor of Social Thought, admits to drinking
some soup to "rejuvenate me," the rest of the
fasters subsist on orange or vegetable juice, a lot of
water, and vitamin pills.
A Rest For The Heart
"We aren't planning to wreck our health," Wright
emphasizes. "It's been a tremendous rest for my
heart; it beats about 20 beats a minute slower." He
added, "I feel I've added years to my life by fasting
this way."
Three of the remaining fasters are women. "I
think we're the stronger sex when it comes to
something like this," Stoneman, an experienced
dieter, said. "I don't think I've suffered as much as
the boys. I lose weight very slowly." She has lost
only five pounds.
