# Stanford Woman Shoots Intruder
## 
### 
A 19 year-old youth was shot by a Stanford housewife as he reportedly tried
to break into a home adjacent to the Stanford campus Friday morning.
The condition of the wounded man, Michael Law of 2858 Fordham St. in
East Palo Alto, was not critical as of yesterday. He was recovering under guard in
the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center.
Velma Priddle, wife of Stanford grounds supervisor and soccer coach Fred
Priddle, shot Law in the abdomen with a .22-caliber rifle when he appeared to be
about to attack her.
Priddle was at home alone at the time. Officers investigating the case said
there would be no charges filed against her.
The shooting occurred near a poolside screen door of the Priddle's residence
on 664 Foothill Blvd. Priddle saw a car draw up to her house; a young man take
an object from the trunk of the car and walk to the back of the house, according
to police reports.
She called the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department and removed the
loaded .22-caliber rifle from a closet.
When she confronted Law attempting to enter the screen door, he raised a
screw driver he was holding as if to attack her. Priddle then fired the shot.
Law had been picked up February 15 on suspicion of burglarizing another
house near campus, and had been released on his own recognizance from North
County jail.
Priddle commented yesterday that it was "fabulous" how quickly the
Sheriffs Department reacted to her call. "It was heartening to find they were so
efficient," she said. The shooting, she added, "was quite a shock."
