# TMU Food Service Head 'Quits'
## 
### KATHY WEINBERGER 
Lee Schafer, the man hired five
months ago to solve the problems and
to improve the much maligned food
service at the embattled Tresidder
Memorial Union (TMU) resigned under
pressure Friday afternoon.
William Myers, manager of
University Food Services, has been
named Interim Food Services Director
for TMU, and will serve until June 1,
the date of his recently announced
resignation from the University.
In a written statement issued
Sunday, Tresidder Director Forrest
Tregea lauded Schafer's
accomplishments in "the quality of
food served, the level of staff training,
and [improvements in the] general
appearance of the facility," but
expressed regret that "Mr. Schafer's
and my differences of management
philosophy could not be reconciled."
Schafer, however, disagreed with
Tregea's assessment of the situation
leading to his resignation. "Forrest is
an absolute jewel," he said of Tregea.
"What he's trying to accomplish for
Tresidder is for it to be an active, vital,
and alive spot for students to
congregate — the same as my goals.
"I quit because the new regulations
imposed on me by Acting Dean of
Students Bob Freelen would be
impossible to work under. I wouldn't
be able to accomplish my objective of
providing a good food service for
students," he explained.
No Confirmation
Schafer's explanation of the "new
regulations" put forth by Freelen
could not be confirmed by Freelen.
Schafer claimed that Freelen advised
Tregea that Food Services Manager
Myers "could do a better job of
running the Tresidder food service
than [Schafer] could."
Schafer stated, "With no advance
notice to me or anyone else, I was told
that Mr. Myers would move into my
office Tuesday morning [today] and
that from then on I would report to
him."
Schafer feels confident that
someone like Myers, whose
background rests totally within
University food services, would be
unable to handle a restaurant situation
like the Tresidder Food Service in a
manner appealing to customers.
From all outward appearances,

Tresidder has been doing better this
year than ever before. The food is
fresh and well prepared, tables and
premises are kept clean and tidy, and
the place seems to be constantly
crowded. Even Tresidder dinners have
become appetizing to many people.
During his short tenure at
Tresidder, Schafer supervised the
redecoration of the cafeteria area,
lowered food prices, and personally
helped serve customers during peak
hours.
At the time of his appointment,
Tregea expressed the belief that
Schafer's selection would improve the
entire Tresidder operation and
produce profits from the food service.
"The morale of the employees is just
tremendous," he said. "With a new
man, and the place more attractive,
they're all excited."
Internal Dissatisfaction
Unknown to many people whose
only connection with Tresidder is
gastronomic consumption, some
workers feel the internal functioning
of the food service has been suffering,
and TMU's financial problems have
not been alleviated.
According to a full-time employee
of the Union, "Mr. Schafter did clean
up the place beautifully, and made it

very attractive, but he surely murdered
the crew. He treated you like a tool,
not a human being. It has become too
much like a concentration camp, not
like a university."
A student who has worked there
four years agreed. "Schafer is a
fucking petty-bureaucrat. He acts too
much like an officer. He did a lot of
good things, but he doesn't know how
to relate to workers."
Some of the employees, however
were dismayed at the sudden
announcement that Schafer would not
be returning.
"Our boss has been fired and we
were not even consulted," one worker
told a student customer Friday night
shortly after the decision had been
made. "I don't see anything we can do
about it, but I think it's a shame.
Working for Schafer was certainly
better than it was before. The food is
better now and the atmosphere around
here has certainly improved," she said.
"I can't figure out what caused him
to leave," remarked another worker.
Employee Dispute?
According to this morning's issue of
Employees Organize, the newspaper of
the United Stanford Employees
(USE), Schafer's resignation was
triggered by a conflict with

dishwashers Paul Ortega and Willie
Smith. It stated that Ortega and Smith
left their jobs Friday morning after
arguing with their supervisor Jerry
Philpot, and later Tregea, about being
seen taking an unscheduled break
during a lull in the morning work load.
The paper reports that student
workers called Freelen in to settle the
dispute, that Ray Caldera from the
personnel office came over to enter
the discussion, and that Schafer left as
a result of the disagreement.
Freelen, however, claimed that the
first he heard that Schafer would not
return to his position was at 6:30 p.m.
Friday evening, when he was informed
of this by Tregea.
Caldera could not be reached for
comment.
As a result of Friday's conflict,
complaints by Cruz Salgado (a night
dishwasher at Tresidder who filed a
grievance, requesting more help in the
dishroom and at least one weekend
night off), and general complaints
about treatment of TMU employees
by the management, USE has drawn
up 16 demands.
The demands include allowing
workers the right to elect supervisors
from among existing employees, to

take part in all decisions affecting their
work, to receive a higher minimum
wage, and to receive free meals, "just
like any other restaurant," according
to Employees Organize.
Problems Denied
Schafer denies having had much
problem with unrest from employees.
"There is a small element, perhaps a
half dozen, who are unhappy. But
they just want to screw around and
receive a pay check," he commented.
"The others realize that their main
purpose at the Union is to work for
the benefit of the students, pushing
their personal interests aside.
"A year ago the employees were
running the Union and everyone
complained about how bad the
operation was. I intended to provide a
first class food service, and for that the
staff needs to respond to the needs of
the public," he added.
Myers stated that he hopes he will
be able to be less strict in supervising
the behavior of employees than
Schafer found possible. "I will try very
hard to generate enough trust with the
employees that they will know things
need to be done. I won't operate with
a club. I think you can get more
results from people if you appeal to

their sensibilities," he explained. "But
I never spent a day in Tresidder, so it's
hard to say I'll be able to do any
better than Schafer did," he added.
"I believe in working with people,
not driving them, beating them down,
or condescending to them," he
concluded.
Myers said he intends to continue
many of the innovations Schafer
started, "but we need to consider the
relationship between the product sold
and the cost. Schafer lowered prices
and improved food choice and quality,
but if he underpriced things because
they were popular, this is bad," he
commented.
Until Myers gets the feel for his
new position he is unable to predict
what ways he will change the
operation. "I know the current
financial problems are very serious,
and we need to pinpoint the cause,"
he said. "I also know a change is
needed to alleviate the personnel
problems," he added.
Myers intends to continue working
with the dorm food service, although
his associate Maxine Anersson will
take over his major responsibilities
there. "But I'm not abandoning my
responsibility to the residence halls,"
he stated.

problems," he added.

with the dorm food service, although
his associate Maxine Anersson will

there. "But I'm not abandoning my

he stated.
Lee Schafer, the man hired five
months ago to solve the problems and
to improve the much maligned food
service at the embattled Tresidder
Memorial Union (TMU) resigned under
pressure Friday afternoon.
William Myers, manager of
University Food Services, has been
named Interim Food Services Director
for TMU, and will serve until June 1,
the date of his recently announced
resignation from the University.
In a written statement issued
Sunday, Tresidder Director Forrest
Tregea lauded Schafer's
accomplishments in "the quality of
food served, the level of staff training,
and [improvements in the] general
appearance of the facility," but
expressed regret that "Mr. Schafer's
and my differences of management
philosophy could not be reconciled."
Schafer, however, disagreed with
Tregea's assessment of the situation
leading to his resignation. "Forrest is
an absolute jewel," he said of Tregea.
"What he's trying to accomplish for
Tresidder is for it to be an active, vital,
and alive spot for students to
congregate — the same as my goals.
"I quit because the new regulations
imposed on me by Acting Dean of
Students Bob Freelen would be
impossible to work under. I wouldn't
be able to accomplish my objective of
providing a good food service for
students," he explained.
No Confirmation
Schafer's explanation of the "new
regulations" put forth by Freelen
could not be confirmed by Freelen.
Schafer claimed that Freelen advised
Tregea that Food Services Manager
Myers "could do a better job of
running the Tresidder food service
than [Schafer] could."
Schafer stated, "With no advance
notice to me or anyone else, I was told
that Mr. Myers would move into my
office Tuesday morning [today] and
that from then on I would report to
him."
Schafer feels confident that
someone like Myers, whose
background rests totally within
University food services, would be
unable to handle a restaurant situation
like the Tresidder Food Service in a
manner appealing to customers.
From all outward appearances,

Tresidder has been doing better this
year than ever before. The food is
fresh and well prepared, tables and
premises are kept clean and tidy, and
the place seems to be constantly
crowded. Even Tresidder dinners have
become appetizing to many people.
During his short tenure at
Tresidder, Schafer supervised the
redecoration of the cafeteria area,
lowered food prices, and personally
helped serve customers during peak
hours.
At the time of his appointment,
Tregea expressed the belief that
Schafer's selection would improve the
entire Tresidder operation and
produce profits from the food service.
"The morale of the employees is just
tremendous," he said. "With a new
man, and the place more attractive,
they're all excited."
Internal Dissatisfaction
Unknown to many people whose
only connection with Tresidder is
gastronomic consumption, some
workers feel the internal functioning
of the food service has been suffering,
and TMU's financial problems have
not been alleviated.
According to a full-time employee
of the Union, "Mr. Schafter did clean
up the place beautifully, and made it

very attractive, but he surely murdered
the crew. He treated you like a tool,
not a human being. It has become too
much like a concentration camp, not
like a university."
A student who has worked there
four years agreed. "Schafer is a
fucking petty-bureaucrat. He acts too
much like an officer. He did a lot of
good things, but he doesn't know how
to relate to workers."
Some of the employees, however
were dismayed at the sudden
announcement that Schafer would not
be returning.
"Our boss has been fired and we
were not even consulted," one worker
told a student customer Friday night
shortly after the decision had been
made. "I don't see anything we can do
about it, but I think it's a shame.
Working for Schafer was certainly
better than it was before. The food is
better now and the atmosphere around
here has certainly improved," she said.
"I can't figure out what caused him
to leave," remarked another worker.
Employee Dispute?
According to this morning's issue of
Employees Organize, the newspaper of
the United Stanford Employees
(USE), Schafer's resignation was
triggered by a conflict with

dishwashers Paul Ortega and Willie
Smith. It stated that Ortega and Smith
left their jobs Friday morning after
arguing with their supervisor Jerry
Philpot, and later Tregea, about being
seen taking an unscheduled break
during a lull in the morning work load.
The paper reports that student
workers called Freelen in to settle the
dispute, that Ray Caldera from the
personnel office came over to enter
the discussion, and that Schafer left as
a result of the disagreement.
Freelen, however, claimed that the
first he heard that Schafer would not
return to his position was at 6:30 p.m.
Friday evening, when he was informed
of this by Tregea.
Caldera could not be reached for
comment.
As a result of Friday's conflict,
complaints by Cruz Salgado (a night
dishwasher at Tresidder who filed a
grievance, requesting more help in the
dishroom and at least one weekend
night off), and general complaints
about treatment of TMU employees
by the management, USE has drawn
up 16 demands.
The demands include allowing
workers the right to elect supervisors
from among existing employees, to

take part in all decisions affecting their
work, to receive a higher minimum
wage, and to receive free meals, "just
like any other restaurant," according
to Employees Organize.
Problems Denied
Schafer denies having had much
problem with unrest from employees.
"There is a small element, perhaps a
half dozen, who are unhappy. But
they just want to screw around and
receive a pay check," he commented.
"The others realize that their main
purpose at the Union is to work for
the benefit of the students, pushing
their personal interests aside.
"A year ago the employees were
running the Union and everyone
complained about how bad the
operation was. I intended to provide a
first class food service, and for that the
staff needs to respond to the needs of
the public," he added.
Myers stated that he hopes he will
be able to be less strict in supervising
the behavior of employees than
Schafer found possible. "I will try very
hard to generate enough trust with the
employees that they will know things
need to be done. I won't operate with
a club. I think you can get more
results from people if you appeal to

their sensibilities," he explained. "But
I never spent a day in Tresidder, so it's
hard to say I'll be able to do any
better than Schafer did," he added.
"I believe in working with people,
not driving them, beating them down,
or condescending to them," he
concluded.
Myers said he intends to continue
many of the innovations Schafer
started, "but we need to consider the
relationship between the product sold
and the cost. Schafer lowered prices
and improved food choice and quality,
but if he underpriced things because
they were popular, this is bad," he
commented.
Until Myers gets the feel for his
new position he is unable to predict
what ways he will change the
operation. "I know the current
financial problems are very serious,
and we need to pinpoint the cause,"
he said. "I also know a change is
needed to alleviate the personnel
problems," he added.

Lee Schafer, the man hired five
months ago to solve the problems and
to improve the much maligned food
service at the embattled Tresidder
Memorial Union (TMU) resigned under
pressure Friday afternoon.
William Myers, manager of
University Food Services, has been
named Interim Food Services Director
for TMU, and will serve until June 1,
the date of his recently announced
resignation from the University.
In a written statement issued
Sunday, Tresidder Director Forrest
Tregea lauded Schafer's
accomplishments in "the quality of
food served, the level of staff training,
and [improvements in the] general
appearance of the facility," but
expressed regret that "Mr. Schafer's
and my differences of management
philosophy could not be reconciled."
Schafer, however, disagreed with
Tregea's assessment of the situation
leading to his resignation. "Forrest is
an absolute jewel," he said of Tregea.
"What he's trying to accomplish for
Tresidder is for it to be an active, vital,
and alive spot for students to
congregate — the same as my goals.
"I quit because the new regulations
imposed on me by Acting Dean of
Students Bob Freelen would be
impossible to work under. I wouldn't
be able to accomplish my objective of
providing a good food service for
students," he explained.
No Confirmation
Schafer's explanation of the "new
regulations" put forth by Freelen
could not be confirmed by Freelen.
Schafer claimed that Freelen advised
Tregea that Food Services Manager
Myers "could do a better job of
running the Tresidder food service
than [Schafer] could."
Schafer stated, "With no advance
notice to me or anyone else, I was told
that Mr. Myers would move into my
office Tuesday morning [today] and
that from then on I would report to
him."
Schafer feels confident that
someone like Myers, whose
background rests totally within
University food services, would be
unable to handle a restaurant situation
like the Tresidder Food Service in a
manner appealing to customers.
From all outward appearances,

Tresidder has been doing better this
year than ever before. The food is
fresh and well prepared, tables and
premises are kept clean and tidy, and
the place seems to be constantly
crowded. Even Tresidder dinners have
become appetizing to many people.
During his short tenure at
Tresidder, Schafer supervised the
redecoration of the cafeteria area,
lowered food prices, and personally
helped serve customers during peak
hours.
At the time of his appointment,
Tregea expressed the belief that
Schafer's selection would improve the
entire Tresidder operation and
produce profits from the food service.
"The morale of the employees is just
tremendous," he said. "With a new
man, and the place more attractive,
they're all excited."
Internal Dissatisfaction
Unknown to many people whose
only connection with Tresidder is
gastronomic consumption, some
workers feel the internal functioning
of the food service has been suffering,
and TMU's financial problems have
not been alleviated.
According to a full-time employee
of the Union, "Mr. Schafter did clean
up the place beautifully, and made it

very attractive, but he surely murdered
the crew. He treated you like a tool,
not a human being. It has become too
much like a concentration camp, not
like a university."
A student who has worked there
four years agreed. "Schafer is a
fucking petty-bureaucrat. He acts too
much like an officer. He did a lot of
good things, but he doesn't know how
to relate to workers."
Some of the employees, however
were dismayed at the sudden
announcement that Schafer would not
be returning.
"Our boss has been fired and we
were not even consulted," one worker
told a student customer Friday night
shortly after the decision had been
made. "I don't see anything we can do
about it, but I think it's a shame.
Working for Schafer was certainly
better than it was before. The food is
better now and the atmosphere around
here has certainly improved," she said.
"I can't figure out what caused him
to leave," remarked another worker.
Employee Dispute?
According to this morning's issue of
Employees Organize, the newspaper of
the United Stanford Employees
(USE), Schafer's resignation was
triggered by a conflict with

dishwashers Paul Ortega and Willie
Smith. It stated that Ortega and Smith
left their jobs Friday morning after
arguing with their supervisor Jerry
Philpot, and later Tregea, about being
seen taking an unscheduled break
during a lull in the morning work load.
The paper reports that student
workers called Freelen in to settle the
dispute, that Ray Caldera from the
personnel office came over to enter
the discussion, and that Schafer left as
a result of the disagreement.
Freelen, however, claimed that the
first he heard that Schafer would not
return to his position was at 6:30 p.m.
Friday evening, when he was informed
of this by Tregea.
Caldera could not be reached for
comment.
As a result of Friday's conflict,
complaints by Cruz Salgado (a night
dishwasher at Tresidder who filed a
grievance, requesting more help in the
dishroom and at least one weekend
night off), and general complaints
about treatment of TMU employees
by the management, USE has drawn
up 16 demands.
The demands include allowing
workers the right to elect supervisors
from among existing employees, to

take part in all decisions affecting their
work, to receive a higher minimum
wage, and to receive free meals, "just
like any other restaurant," according
to Employees Organize.
Problems Denied
Schafer denies having had much
problem with unrest from employees.
"There is a small element, perhaps a
half dozen, who are unhappy. But
they just want to screw around and
receive a pay check," he commented.
"The others realize that their main
purpose at the Union is to work for
the benefit of the students, pushing
their personal interests aside.
"A year ago the employees were
running the Union and everyone
complained about how bad the
operation was. I intended to provide a
first class food service, and for that the
staff needs to respond to the needs of
the public," he added.
Myers stated that he hopes he will
be able to be less strict in supervising
the behavior of employees than
Schafer found possible. "I will try very
hard to generate enough trust with the
employees that they will know things
need to be done. I won't operate with
a club. I think you can get more
results from people if you appeal to

their sensibilities," he explained. "But
I never spent a day in Tresidder, so it's
hard to say I'll be able to do any
better than Schafer did," he added.
"I believe in working with people,
not driving them, beating them down,
or condescending to them," he
concluded.
Myers said he intends to continue
many of the innovations Schafer
started, "but we need to consider the
relationship between the product sold
and the cost. Schafer lowered prices
and improved food choice and quality,
but if he underpriced things because
they were popular, this is bad," he
commented.

and the cost. Schafer lowered prices
and improved food choice and quality,
but if he underpriced things because
they were popular, this is bad," he
commented.
Until Myers gets the feel for his
new position he is unable to predict
what ways he will change the
operation. "I know the current
financial problems are very serious,
and we need to pinpoint the cause,"
he said. "I also know a change is
needed to alleviate the personnel
problems," he added.

Lee Schafer, the man hired five
months ago to solve the problems and
to improve the much maligned food
service at the embattled Tresidder
Memorial Union (TMU) resigned under
pressure Friday afternoon.
William Myers, manager of
University Food Services, has been
named Interim Food Services Director
for TMU, and will serve until June 1,
the date of his recently announced
resignation from the University.
In a written statement issued
Sunday, Tresidder Director Forrest
Tregea lauded Schafer's
accomplishments in "the quality of
food served, the level of staff training,
and [improvements in the] general
appearance of the facility," but
expressed regret that "Mr. Schafer's
and my differences of management
philosophy could not be reconciled."
Schafer, however, disagreed with
Tregea's assessment of the situation
leading to his resignation. "Forrest is
an absolute jewel," he said of Tregea.
"What he's trying to accomplish for
Tresidder is for it to be an active, vital,
and alive spot for students to
congregate — the same as my goals.
"I quit because the new regulations
imposed on me by Acting Dean of
Students Bob Freelen would be
impossible to work under. I wouldn't
be able to accomplish my objective of
providing a good food service for
students," he explained.
No Confirmation
Schafer's explanation of the "new
regulations" put forth by Freelen
could not be confirmed by Freelen.
Schafer claimed that Freelen advised
Tregea that Food Services Manager
Myers "could do a better job of
running the Tresidder food service
than [Schafer] could."
Schafer stated, "With no advance
notice to me or anyone else, I was told
that Mr. Myers would move into my
office Tuesday morning [today] and
that from then on I would report to
him."
Schafer feels confident that
someone like Myers, whose
background rests totally within
University food services, would be
unable to handle a restaurant situation
like the Tresidder Food Service in a
manner appealing to customers.
From all outward appearances,

Tresidder has been doing better this
year than ever before. The food is
fresh and well prepared, tables and
premises are kept clean and tidy, and
the place seems to be constantly
crowded. Even Tresidder dinners have
become appetizing to many people.
During his short tenure at
Tresidder, Schafer supervised the
redecoration of the cafeteria area,
lowered food prices, and personally
helped serve customers during peak
hours.
At the time of his appointment,
Tregea expressed the belief that
Schafer's selection would improve the
entire Tresidder operation and
produce profits from the food service.
"The morale of the employees is just
tremendous," he said. "With a new
man, and the place more attractive,
they're all excited."
Internal Dissatisfaction
Unknown to many people whose
only connection with Tresidder is
gastronomic consumption, some
workers feel the internal functioning
of the food service has been suffering,
and TMU's financial problems have
not been alleviated.
According to a full-time employee
of the Union, "Mr. Schafter did clean
up the place beautifully, and made it

very attractive, but he surely murdered
the crew. He treated you like a tool,
not a human being. It has become too
much like a concentration camp, not
like a university."
A student who has worked there
four years agreed. "Schafer is a
fucking petty-bureaucrat. He acts too
much like an officer. He did a lot of
good things, but he doesn't know how
to relate to workers."
Some of the employees, however
were dismayed at the sudden
announcement that Schafer would not
be returning.
"Our boss has been fired and we
were not even consulted," one worker
told a student customer Friday night
shortly after the decision had been
made. "I don't see anything we can do
about it, but I think it's a shame.
Working for Schafer was certainly
better than it was before. The food is
better now and the atmosphere around
here has certainly improved," she said.
"I can't figure out what caused him
to leave," remarked another worker.
Employee Dispute?
According to this morning's issue of
Employees Organize, the newspaper of
the United Stanford Employees
(USE), Schafer's resignation was
triggered by a conflict with

dishwashers Paul Ortega and Willie
Smith. It stated that Ortega and Smith
left their jobs Friday morning after
arguing with their supervisor Jerry
Philpot, and later Tregea, about being
seen taking an unscheduled break
during a lull in the morning work load.
The paper reports that student
workers called Freelen in to settle the
dispute, that Ray Caldera from the
personnel office came over to enter
the discussion, and that Schafer left as
a result of the disagreement.
Freelen, however, claimed that the
first he heard that Schafer would not
return to his position was at 6:30 p.m.
Friday evening, when he was informed
of this by Tregea.
Caldera could not be reached for
comment.
As a result of Friday's conflict,
complaints by Cruz Salgado (a night
dishwasher at Tresidder who filed a
grievance, requesting more help in the
dishroom and at least one weekend
night off), and general complaints
about treatment of TMU employees
by the management, USE has drawn
up 16 demands.
The demands include allowing
workers the right to elect supervisors
from among existing employees, to

SHORT STAY—Lee Schafer came in September with large dreams and great
intentions for improving Tresidder Food Service. He left Friday after
management and personality difficulties forced his resignation.
take part in all decisions affecting their
work, to receive a higher minimum
wage, and to receive free meals, "just
like any other restaurant," according
to Employees Organize.
Problems Denied
Schafer denies having had much
problem with unrest from employees.
"There is a small element, perhaps a
half dozen, who are unhappy. But
they just want to screw around and
receive a pay check," he commented.
"The others realize that their main
purpose at the Union is to work for
the benefit of the students, pushing
their personal interests aside.
"A year ago the employees were
running the Union and everyone
complained about how bad the
operation was. I intended to provide a
first class food service, and for that the
staff needs to respond to the needs of
the public," he added.
Myers stated that he hopes he will
be able to be less strict in supervising
the behavior of employees than
Schafer found possible. "I will try very
hard to generate enough trust with the
employees that they will know things
need to be done. I won't operate with
a club. I think you can get more
results from people if you appeal to

their sensibilities," he explained. "But
I never spent a day in Tresidder, so it's
hard to say I'll be able to do any
better than Schafer did," he added.
"I believe in working with people,
not driving them, beating them down,
or condescending to them," he
concluded.
Myers said he intends to continue
many of the innovations Schafer
started, "but we need to consider the
relationship between the product sold
and the cost. Schafer lowered prices
and improved food choice and quality,
but if he underpriced things because
they were popular, this is bad," he
commented.
Until Myers gets the feel for his
new position he is unable to predict
what ways he will change the
operation. "I know the current
financial problems are very serious,
and we need to pinpoint the cause,"
he said. "I also know a change is
needed to alleviate the personnel
problems," he added.
Myers intends to continue working
with the dorm food service, although
his associate Maxine Anersson will
take over his major responsibilities
there. "But I'm not abandoning my
responsibility to the residence halls,"
he stated.
