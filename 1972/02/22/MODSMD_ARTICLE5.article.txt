# Students OK Child Care Fee
## 
### 
Students approved, by a 2211 to 1488 vote, the fee
assessment for the Child Care Center last week.
The proposal for a one-time $1 assessment for spring
quarter was approved in balloting Thursday and Friday. A
similar proposal was defeated last October by a vote of
1602 to 1429.
State Licensing Standards
The approximately $12,000 will be used to make
permanent improvements at the Children's Center of the
Stanford Community (CCSC) to bring the day care
facility up to state licensing standards. According to
budget outlines released before the referendum, none of
the money will be used for current operating for the
Center serving Stanford faculty, staff, and student
families.
CCSC board member Susan Newcomer said the
directors of the Center now plan to "attempt to get
licensed, to begin serious negotiations with the State to
find out what we have to do" to get licensed.
She feels that the turn around in the votes indicate that
"more people are becoming aware for the need for day
care for children."
Chris Hocker of the anti-referendum Stanford
Voluntarists said of the election, "We got the hell beat out

of us."
He claimed that the advocates of the Child Care Center
ran an emotional campaign.
"Essentially it is very difficult to vote against little
kids . . . Those in favor of the fee assessment succeeded in
creating an image of little kids, that that was the issue. In
a way it's surprising that 1500 people would vote against
little kids. I'm beginning to realize that Stanford students
vote with their guts instead of their heads," he said.
'Gut Emotional'
Newcomer admitted that the issue was a "gut
emotional" one "if you feel that the future of the world is
a gut emotional issue.
"There were a lot of things we didn't do that we would
have if we wanted to play a straight emotional game," she
said. "We didn't show pictures of starving children, for
instance."
She said that the pro-child care faction had learned a
great deal from the loss in October. Of Hocker's group she
observed: "We were very respectful of what they were
doing and the things they were saying. They couldn't play
on ignorance this time, and they had to do some wild
things, and in that sense they got even more out on a
limb."
