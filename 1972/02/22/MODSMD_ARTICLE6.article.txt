Reply to Ogletree
(Editor's Note: This letter is a
reply to a letter from Charles
Ogletree, published Friday.)
Dear Mr. Ogletree,
I am writing in answer to the
letter of February 17 by your
associates and yourself. In it you
express concern about Professor
Shockley's performance and
usefulness as a faculty member,
and you request "that the
Academic Council undertake an
examination of the role and
activities of William Shockley as a
professor at Stanford University."
The letter goes on to delineate
three items which deal both with
the basic academic relationship
between teacher and student and
with off-campus repercussions of
Professor Shockley's theories of
genetics. Let me comment
separately on these two aspects.
With respect to the
teacher-student interaction, it is
essentially true that traditionally a

faculty member has had almost
unlimited authority over his
students in teaching matters,
although students with grievances
have always had the option of
appeal to the department
chairman, dean or provost. More
recently, there has been an
alternative route, namely, appeal
to the University Ombudsman.
There may very well be some
desirability in strengthening
further the procedures for
consideration of student
grievances. In this connection I
received a letter from Provost
Miller just recently asking that
possible implementation of
improved mechanisms for
handling problems of
faculty-student relations in
teaching situations be brought up
for consideration by the Steering
Committee of the Senate of the
Academic Control. 1 presume that
a copy of Provost Miller's letter is
available upon request, and I have
indeed asked that the matter be

scheduled for the next meeting of
the Steering Committee. This
action is a viable parallel to your
requested examination by the
Academic Council.
The wider reverberations of
Professor Shockley's work in
genetics are not, in fact, clearly
translated into definable problems
which can be treated in terms of
campus regulations, policies or
procedures. Attempts to do so
may set a precedent which most
of the faculty, in fact most of the
campus community, would regard
as undesirable.

Fast Continues
The FAST continues, several of
the people who have fasted since
February 9 will continue to go
without food until the following
goals are achieved:
1. An open public meeting

between the Stanford community
and Dick Lyman,
2. A moratorium on the use of
our facilities for recruitment by
the military services and
corporations producing
anti-personnel weapons or
corporations holding over
$100,000,000 in military
contracts. The moratorium will
continue until binding referenda
are held by students, setting
policy on recruitment.
3. A moratorium on campus
judicial proceedings until a
judicial sysetm is established by a
binding vote of those individuals
under its jurisdiction.
In other words, in this period
of dissension we seek a
moratorium on the controversial
actions until they are
democratically resolved, and a
public meeting with the person
who makes the decisions here.
These aims seem fair and
reasonable to us, but our
negotiations with President
Lyman have come to a dead end.
After our second meeting, he told
us that further talks "would not
be productive" and refused to set
a date for another meeting. We
now expect, to our chagrin, a long
FAST.
We have found that faculty,
staff, and students find the goals
of the fast as reasonable as we do,
but Lyman indicated to us that he
interprets apathy or inaction as
support for his actions. So we
need the support of the
community even more now, to
encourage this one man to be
reasonable and to share "the
burden of decision-making" with
those of us who work and study

at and are affected by Stanford.
Specifically, we ask every
member of the Stanford
community to let Lyman know
his or her opinion of our goals, by
writing or phoning the President's
Office or by going there in person
and leaving a note. Only YOUR
support can sustain us.
We thank the many people
who joined us in the one-day fast
Monday noon to Tuesday noon,
and we encourage others to try
the same experiment. The support
of the Daily and the Council of
Presidents also boosted our spirits,
but only more widespread support
will change Lyman's mind.

Apology
We, the West Indians, who
organized the Grand Caribbean
Fete at the International Centre
on February 12, would like to
make public the fact that we were
completely unaware of the
intentions of the Caribbean New
Forces, a political group, to
distribute politically-oriented
literature at the Centre that night.
Furthermore it should be clearly
stated that we are not connected
in any way with this group and
consider their behavior
inopportune and in extremely
poor taste.
Despite this intrusion we trust
that the guests enjoyed themselves
in the manner that we had
intended.

have always had the option of
appeal to the department
chairman, dean or provost. More
recently, there has been an
alternative route, namely, appeal
to the University Ombudsman.
There may very well be some
desirability in strengthening
further the procedures for
consideration of student
grievances. In this connection I
received a letter from Provost
Miller just recently asking that
possible implementation of
improved mechanisms for
handling problems of
faculty-student relations in
teaching situations be brought up
for consideration by the Steering
Committee of the Senate of the
Academic Control. 1 presume that
a copy of Provost Miller's letter is
available upon request, and I have
indeed asked that the matter be

scheduled for the next meeting of
the Steering Committee. This
action is a viable parallel to your
requested examination by the
Academic Council.
The wider reverberations of
Professor Shockley's work in
genetics are not, in fact, clearly
translated into definable problems
which can be treated in terms of
campus regulations, policies or
procedures. Attempts to do so
may set a precedent which most
of the faculty, in fact most of the
campus community, would regard
as undesirable.

Fast Continues
The FAST continues, several of
the people who have fasted since
February 9 will continue to go
without food until the following
goals are achieved:
1. An open public meeting

between the Stanford community
and Dick Lyman,
2. A moratorium on the use of
our facilities for recruitment by
the military services and
corporations producing
anti-personnel weapons or
corporations holding over
$100,000,000 in military
contracts. The moratorium will
continue until binding referenda
are held by students, setting
policy on recruitment.
3. A moratorium on campus
judicial proceedings until a
judicial sysetm is established by a
binding vote of those individuals
under its jurisdiction.
In other words, in this period
of dissension we seek a
moratorium on the controversial
actions until they are
democratically resolved, and a
public meeting with the person
who makes the decisions here.
These aims seem fair and
reasonable to us, but our
negotiations with President
Lyman have come to a dead end.
After our second meeting, he told
us that further talks "would not
be productive" and refused to set
a date for another meeting. We
now expect, to our chagrin, a long
FAST.
We have found that faculty,
staff, and students find the goals
of the fast as reasonable as we do,
but Lyman indicated to us that he
interprets apathy or inaction as
support for his actions. So we
need the support of the
community even more now, to
encourage this one man to be
reasonable and to share "the
burden of decision-making" with
those of us who work and study

at and are affected by Stanford.
Specifically, we ask every
member of the Stanford
community to let Lyman know
his or her opinion of our goals, by
writing or phoning the President's
Office or by going there in person
and leaving a note. Only YOUR
support can sustain us.
We thank the many people
who joined us in the one-day fast
Monday noon to Tuesday noon,
and we encourage others to try
the same experiment. The support
of the Daily and the Council of
Presidents also boosted our spirits,
but only more widespread support
will change Lyman's mind.

Apology
We, the West Indians, who
organized the Grand Caribbean
Fete at the International Centre
on February 12, would like to
make public the fact that we were
completely unaware of the
intentions of the Caribbean New
Forces, a political group, to
distribute politically-oriented
literature at the Centre that night.
Furthermore it should be clearly
stated that we are not connected
in any way with this group and
consider their behavior
inopportune and in extremely
poor taste.
Despite this intrusion we trust
that the guests enjoyed themselves
in the manner that we had
intended.

Reply to Ogletree
(Editor's Note: This letter is a
reply to a letter from Charles
Ogletree, published Friday.)
Dear Mr. Ogletree,
I am writing in answer to the
letter of February 17 by your
associates and yourself. In it you
express concern about Professor
Shockley's performance and
usefulness as a faculty member,
and you request "that the
Academic Council undertake an
examination of the role and
activities of William Shockley as a
professor at Stanford University."
The letter goes on to delineate
three items which deal both with
the basic academic relationship
between teacher and student and
with off-campus repercussions of
Professor Shockley's theories of
genetics. Let me comment
separately on these two aspects.
With respect to the
teacher-student interaction, it is
essentially true that traditionally a

faculty member has had almost
unlimited authority over his
students in teaching matters,
although students with grievances
have always had the option of
appeal to the department
chairman, dean or provost. More
recently, there has been an
alternative route, namely, appeal
to the University Ombudsman.

which can be treated in terms of
campus regulations, policies or
procedures. Attempts to do so
may set a precedent which most
of the faculty, in fact most of the
campus community, would regard
as undesirable.

Fast Continues
The FAST continues, several of
the people who have fasted since
February 9 will continue to go
without food until the following
goals are achieved:
1. An open public meeting

between the Stanford community
and Dick Lyman,
2. A moratorium on the use of
our facilities for recruitment by
the military services and
corporations producing
anti-personnel weapons or
corporations holding over
$100,000,000 in military
contracts. The moratorium will
continue until binding referenda
are held by students, setting
policy on recruitment.
3. A moratorium on campus
judicial proceedings until a
judicial sysetm is established by a
binding vote of those individuals
under its jurisdiction.
In other words, in this period
of dissension we seek a
moratorium on the controversial
actions until they are
democratically resolved, and a
public meeting with the person
who makes the decisions here.
These aims seem fair and
reasonable to us, but our
negotiations with President
Lyman have come to a dead end.
After our second meeting, he told
us that further talks "would not
be productive" and refused to set
a date for another meeting. We
now expect, to our chagrin, a long
FAST.
We have found that faculty,
staff, and students find the goals
of the fast as reasonable as we do,
but Lyman indicated to us that he
interprets apathy or inaction as
support for his actions. So we
need the support of the
community even more now, to
encourage this one man to be
reasonable and to share "the
burden of decision-making" with
those of us who work and study

at and are affected by Stanford.
Specifically, we ask every
member of the Stanford
community to let Lyman know
his or her opinion of our goals, by
writing or phoning the President's
Office or by going there in person
and leaving a note. Only YOUR
support can sustain us.
We thank the many people
who joined us in the one-day fast
Monday noon to Tuesday noon,
and we encourage others to try
the same experiment. The support
of the Daily and the Council of
Presidents also boosted our spirits,
but only more widespread support
will change Lyman's mind.

Apology
We, the West Indians, who
organized the Grand Caribbean
Fete at the International Centre
on February 12, would like to
make public the fact that we were
completely unaware of the
intentions of the Caribbean New
Forces, a political group, to
distribute politically-oriented
literature at the Centre that night.
Furthermore it should be clearly
stated that we are not connected
in any way with this group and
consider their behavior
inopportune and in extremely
poor taste.
Despite this intrusion we trust
that the guests enjoyed themselves
in the manner that we had
intended.
