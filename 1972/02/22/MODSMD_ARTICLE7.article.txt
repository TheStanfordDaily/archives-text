Ulster
The March 1972 Ramparts has
an article describing the historical
origins of the troubles in Ulster
and the current Irish Republican
Army Provisionals' battle to kick
the British out. Russell Stetler
tells how the ancestors of the
Protestants were implanted in the
north of Ireland by Oliver
Cromwell, after he conquered the
island.
Cromwell's policy, according
to Stetler, was to take the lands of
the Irish peasantry and then to
create a feudal caste based on
these monopoly grants of land,
which went to Cromwell's
officers.
The roots of the present
conflict in Imperial Britian's
conquest and land theft are an
example of the truth of those
social theories which contend that
hegemonic power and true
exploitation are the result of the
initiation of force.
The February 14 issue of
Newsweek tells how the Catholics
have implemented Catholic power
in Catholic communities:

"Where policemen and civil
servants once maintained order,
an informal collection of street
councils, volunteer committees,
citizen's defense groups and
ex-servicemen's associations now
hold sway. ...
"In place of the Protestant
police, a volunteer 'Peace Corps'
has sprung up, which patrols
Bogside in civilian clothes and
unmarked cars.
"Since the community
cooperates readily with its
homegrown constabulary,
wrongdoers are generally tracked
down quickly.. .."
Calif. Marijuana Initiative
Circulators are collecting
signatures of registered voters for
a California ballot initiative
designed to reform the state's laws
on marijuana by decriminalizing
personal possession.
If enough signatures are
collected, the iniative measure will
be placed on the ballot, where
California voters can decide to
enact or reject it.
The measure has two parts:

"(1) No person in the State of
California 18 years of age or older
shall be imprisoned criminally, or
be denied any right or privilege,
by reason of such person's
planting, cultivating, harvesting,
drying, processing, otherwise
preparing, transporting, or
possessing marijuana for personal
use, or by reason of that use.
"(2) This provision shall in no
way be construed to repeal
existing legislation, or limit the
enactment of future legislation,
prohibiting persons under the
influence of marijuana from
engaging in conduct that
endangers others."
While this measure fails to
decriminalize commercial
production and sale of marijuana,
it would be a major step toward
total freedom to buy and ingest
psychedelic chemicals. The
"California Marijuana Initiative"
operation is being coordinated
from an office at 2221 Fibert
Street in San Francisco.
New Libertarian Party
The New York Times of
February 6 gave full and fair
coverage to the birth in Denver,
Colorado, of a new national
political party called the
Libertarian Party.
State-Level organizations
already exist for this party in
Colorado, Texas, California, Utah,
and Michigan. The party's leaders
hope to have 10,000 members by
Election Day in November and to
be a major third-party force in the
United States by 1980.
The political position "taken is
in many ways analogous to
positions taken by such historic
American political groupings as
the Anti-Federalists, the
Jeffersonians, the Jacksonians, the
Liberty Party, the pre-Civil War
Republican Party, and the Grover

Cleveland Democrats. The historic
political party which the
Libertarian Party resembles most
is the Loco-Foco or Equal Rights
Party (of radical New York State
Jacksonians).
As reported in the Times, the
group admires the principles of
"such men as Senators Barry
Goldwater, Arizona Republican;
Sam J. Ervin Jr., South Carolina
Democrat; and William Proxmire,
Wisconsin Democrat; and
Representative H.R. Gross, lowa
Republican.
"Others whose work they
admire are economists Murray
Roth bard and Alan Greenspan
and A.E. Fitzgerald, a former
Pentagon efficiency expert who
now heads the National Taxpayers
union."
Later in the story the Times
lists a number of the positions
taken by the temporary national
platform of the Libertarian Party:
—"Repeal of all criminal laws
in which there is no victim.
—"Full freedom of speech and
of the press, along with repeal of
the Federal Communications Act.
—"Opposition to preventive
detention and 'no-knock' laws and
to wiretapping, except in cases
where 'high standards of probable
cause' exist to believe that a crime
has been committed.
—"Immediate abolishment of
the draft and amnesty for those
who have avoided it.
—"Support for private
ownership of gold.
—"Repeal of the Interstate
Commerce Act and the National
Labor Relations Act as
impediments to a free market and
eventual elimination of the
Federal Reserve System.
—"End tax discrimination
against single persons.
—"End subsidies at home and
tariffs and quotas on foreign
imports.

—"End all foreign aid, abandon
'attempts to act as a policeman
for the world,' and withdraw from
the United Nations, but continue
to maintain nuclear deterrence.
—"No commitment to battle of
American troops without Senate
approval and an immediate
withdrawal from Indochina.
—"Recognition of the right of
secession by states and other
political units within the United
States." (These summaries of the
party's positions are those
supplied by the New York Times'
reporter.)
Neighborhood Government
Karl Hess, a fellow at the
Institute for Policy Studies in
Washington, had an opinion
column in the January 31 New
York Times entitled "Why
Neighborhoods Must Secede."
Hess provides a succinct
rationale for decentralized, local
control at the neighborhood level.
Hess pointed out that a survey of
the taxes taken from and the
benefits doled out to a poor
neighborhood in Washington, D.C.
showed clear evidence of
downtown imperialism and Big
Government exploitation of
neighborhoods. The survey was
remarkable in that it did not make
the frequent methodological error
of assigning as a benefit to the
poor neighborhood "its pro-rata
share of such unwanted
expenditures as the Vietnam war
or subsidies to big business and
big politicians."
The survey showed that "in
one of the poorest welfare
neighborhoods of Washington,
D.C.... the residents shell out at
least $40 million in taxes, licenses,
etc., to all levels of government.
They get back, in geographically
located services and payments,
about $30 million, thus losing $10
million to the rich, the powerful,
the people who are supposed to
be protecting them but who,
instead, are simply fleecing
them."

Neighborhood Government
Karl Hess, a fellow at the
Institute for Policy Studies in
Washington, had an opinion
column in the January 31 New
York Times entitled "Why
Neighborhoods Must Secede."
Hess provides a succinct
rationale for decentralized, local
control at the neighborhood level.
Hess pointed out that a survey of
the taxes taken from and the
benefits doled out to a poor
neighborhood in Washington, D.C.
showed clear evidence of
downtown imperialism and Big
Government exploitation of
neighborhoods. The survey was
remarkable in that it did not make
the frequent methodological error
of assigning as a benefit to the
poor neighborhood "its pro-rata
share of such unwanted
expenditures as the Vietnam war
or subsidies to big business and
big politicians."
The survey showed that "in
one of the poorest welfare
neighborhoods of Washington,
D.C.... the residents shell out at
least $40 million in taxes, licenses,
etc., to all levels of government.
They get back, in geographically
located services and payments,
about $30 million, thus losing $10
million to the rich, the powerful,
the people who are supposed to
be protecting them but who,
instead, are simply fleecing
them."

Ulster
The March 1972 Ramparts has
an article describing the historical
origins of the troubles in Ulster
and the current Irish Republican
Army Provisionals' battle to kick
the British out. Russell Stetler
tells how the ancestors of the
Protestants were implanted in the
north of Ireland by Oliver
Cromwell, after he conquered the
island.
Cromwell's policy, according
to Stetler, was to take the lands of
the Irish peasantry and then to
create a feudal caste based on
these monopoly grants of land,
which went to Cromwell's
officers.
The roots of the present
conflict in Imperial Britian's
conquest and land theft are an
example of the truth of those
social theories which contend that
hegemonic power and true
exploitation are the result of the
initiation of force.
The February 14 issue of
Newsweek tells how the Catholics
have implemented Catholic power
in Catholic communities:

"Where policemen and civil
servants once maintained order,
an informal collection of street
councils, volunteer committees,
citizen's defense groups and
ex-servicemen's associations now
hold sway. ...
"In place of the Protestant
police, a volunteer 'Peace Corps'
has sprung up, which patrols
Bogside in civilian clothes and
unmarked cars.
"Since the community
cooperates readily with its
homegrown constabulary,
wrongdoers are generally tracked
down quickly.. .."
Calif. Marijuana Initiative
Circulators are collecting
signatures of registered voters for
a California ballot initiative
designed to reform the state's laws
on marijuana by decriminalizing
personal possession.
If enough signatures are
collected, the iniative measure will
be placed on the ballot, where
California voters can decide to
enact or reject it.
The measure has two parts:

"(1) No person in the State of
California 18 years of age or older
shall be imprisoned criminally, or
be denied any right or privilege,
by reason of such person's
planting, cultivating, harvesting,
drying, processing, otherwise
preparing, transporting, or
possessing marijuana for personal
use, or by reason of that use.
"(2) This provision shall in no
way be construed to repeal
existing legislation, or limit the
enactment of future legislation,
prohibiting persons under the
influence of marijuana from
engaging in conduct that
endangers others."
While this measure fails to
decriminalize commercial
production and sale of marijuana,
it would be a major step toward
total freedom to buy and ingest
psychedelic chemicals. The
"California Marijuana Initiative"
operation is being coordinated
from an office at 2221 Fibert
Street in San Francisco.
New Libertarian Party
The New York Times of
February 6 gave full and fair
coverage to the birth in Denver,
Colorado, of a new national
political party called the
Libertarian Party.
State-Level organizations
already exist for this party in
Colorado, Texas, California, Utah,
and Michigan. The party's leaders
hope to have 10,000 members by
Election Day in November and to
be a major third-party force in the
United States by 1980.
The political position "taken is
in many ways analogous to
positions taken by such historic
American political groupings as
the Anti-Federalists, the
Jeffersonians, the Jacksonians, the
Liberty Party, the pre-Civil War
Republican Party, and the Grover

Cleveland Democrats. The historic
political party which the
Libertarian Party resembles most
is the Loco-Foco or Equal Rights
Party (of radical New York State
Jacksonians).
As reported in the Times, the
group admires the principles of
"such men as Senators Barry
Goldwater, Arizona Republican;
Sam J. Ervin Jr., South Carolina
Democrat; and William Proxmire,
Wisconsin Democrat; and
Representative H.R. Gross, lowa
Republican.
"Others whose work they
admire are economists Murray
Roth bard and Alan Greenspan
and A.E. Fitzgerald, a former
Pentagon efficiency expert who
now heads the National Taxpayers
union."
Later in the story the Times
lists a number of the positions
taken by the temporary national
platform of the Libertarian Party:
—"Repeal of all criminal laws
in which there is no victim.
—"Full freedom of speech and
of the press, along with repeal of
the Federal Communications Act.
—"Opposition to preventive
detention and 'no-knock' laws and
to wiretapping, except in cases
where 'high standards of probable
cause' exist to believe that a crime
has been committed.
—"Immediate abolishment of
the draft and amnesty for those
who have avoided it.
—"Support for private
ownership of gold.
—"Repeal of the Interstate
Commerce Act and the National
Labor Relations Act as
impediments to a free market and
eventual elimination of the
Federal Reserve System.
—"End tax discrimination
against single persons.
—"End subsidies at home and
tariffs and quotas on foreign
imports.

—"End all foreign aid, abandon
'attempts to act as a policeman
for the world,' and withdraw from
the United Nations, but continue
to maintain nuclear deterrence.
—"No commitment to battle of
American troops without Senate
approval and an immediate

Republican Party, and the Grover

Cleveland Democrats. The historic
political party which the
Libertarian Party resembles most
is the Loco-Foco or Equal Rights
Party (of radical New York State
Jacksonians).
As reported in the Times, the
group admires the principles of
"such men as Senators Barry
Goldwater, Arizona Republican;
Sam J. Ervin Jr., South Carolina
Democrat; and William Proxmire,
Wisconsin Democrat; and
Representative H.R. Gross, lowa
Republican.
"Others whose work they
admire are economists Murray
Roth bard and Alan Greenspan
and A.E. Fitzgerald, a former
Pentagon efficiency expert who
now heads the National Taxpayers
union."
Later in the story the Times
lists a number of the positions
taken by the temporary national
platform of the Libertarian Party:
—"Repeal of all criminal laws
in which there is no victim.
—"Full freedom of speech and
of the press, along with repeal of
the Federal Communications Act.
—"Opposition to preventive
detention and 'no-knock' laws and
to wiretapping, except in cases
where 'high standards of probable
cause' exist to believe that a crime
has been committed.
—"Immediate abolishment of
the draft and amnesty for those
who have avoided it.
—"Support for private
ownership of gold.
—"Repeal of the Interstate
Commerce Act and the National
Labor Relations Act as
impediments to a free market and
eventual elimination of the
Federal Reserve System.
—"End tax discrimination
against single persons.
—"End subsidies at home and
tariffs and quotas on foreign
imports.

—"End all foreign aid, abandon
'attempts to act as a policeman
for the world,' and withdraw from
the United Nations, but continue
to maintain nuclear deterrence.
—"No commitment to battle of
American troops without Senate
approval and an immediate
withdrawal from Indochina.
—"Recognition of the right of
secession by states and other
political units within the United
States." (These summaries of the
party's positions are those

Neighborhood Government
Karl Hess, a fellow at the
Institute for Policy Studies in
Washington, had an opinion
column in the January 31 New
York Times entitled "Why
Neighborhoods Must Secede."
Hess provides a succinct
rationale for decentralized, local
control at the neighborhood level.
Hess pointed out that a survey of
the taxes taken from and the
benefits doled out to a poor
neighborhood in Washington, D.C.
showed clear evidence of
downtown imperialism and Big
Government exploitation of
neighborhoods. The survey was
remarkable in that it did not make
the frequent methodological error
of assigning as a benefit to the
poor neighborhood "its pro-rata
share of such unwanted
expenditures as the Vietnam war
or subsidies to big business and
big politicians."
The survey showed that "in
one of the poorest welfare
neighborhoods of Washington,
D.C.... the residents shell out at
least $40 million in taxes, licenses,
etc., to all levels of government.
They get back, in geographically
located services and payments,
about $30 million, thus losing $10
million to the rich, the powerful,
the people who are supposed to
be protecting them but who,
instead, are simply fleecing
them."

Ulster
The March 1972 Ramparts has
an article describing the historical
origins of the troubles in Ulster
and the current Irish Republican
Army Provisionals' battle to kick
the British out. Russell Stetler
tells how the ancestors of the
Protestants were implanted in the
north of Ireland by Oliver
Cromwell, after he conquered the
island.
Cromwell's policy, according
to Stetler, was to take the lands of
the Irish peasantry and then to
create a feudal caste based on
these monopoly grants of land,
which went to Cromwell's
officers.
The roots of the present
conflict in Imperial Britian's
conquest and land theft are an
example of the truth of those
social theories which contend that
hegemonic power and true
exploitation are the result of the
initiation of force.
The February 14 issue of
Newsweek tells how the Catholics
have implemented Catholic power
in Catholic communities:

"Where policemen and civil
servants once maintained order,
an informal collection of street
councils, volunteer committees,
citizen's defense groups and
ex-servicemen's associations now
hold sway. ...
"In place of the Protestant
police, a volunteer 'Peace Corps'
has sprung up, which patrols
Bogside in civilian clothes and
unmarked cars.
"Since the community
cooperates readily with its
homegrown constabulary,
wrongdoers are generally tracked
down quickly.. .."
Calif. Marijuana Initiative
Circulators are collecting
signatures of registered voters for
a California ballot initiative
designed to reform the state's laws
on marijuana by decriminalizing
personal possession.
If enough signatures are
collected, the iniative measure will
be placed on the ballot, where
California voters can decide to
enact or reject it.
The measure has two parts:

"(1) No person in the State of
California 18 years of age or older
shall be imprisoned criminally, or
be denied any right or privilege,
by reason of such person's
planting, cultivating, harvesting,
drying, processing, otherwise
preparing, transporting, or
possessing marijuana for personal
use, or by reason of that use.
"(2) This provision shall in no
way be construed to repeal
existing legislation, or limit the
enactment of future legislation,
prohibiting persons under the
influence of marijuana from
engaging in conduct that
endangers others."
While this measure fails to
decriminalize commercial
production and sale of marijuana,
it would be a major step toward
total freedom to buy and ingest
psychedelic chemicals. The
"California Marijuana Initiative"
operation is being coordinated
from an office at 2221 Fibert
Street in San Francisco.
New Libertarian Party
The New York Times of
February 6 gave full and fair
coverage to the birth in Denver,
Colorado, of a new national
political party called the
Libertarian Party.
State-Level organizations
already exist for this party in
Colorado, Texas, California, Utah,
and Michigan. The party's leaders
hope to have 10,000 members by
Election Day in November and to
be a major third-party force in the
United States by 1980.
The political position "taken is
in many ways analogous to
positions taken by such historic
American political groupings as
the Anti-Federalists, the
Jeffersonians, the Jacksonians, the
Liberty Party, the pre-Civil War
Republican Party, and the Grover

Cleveland Democrats. The historic
