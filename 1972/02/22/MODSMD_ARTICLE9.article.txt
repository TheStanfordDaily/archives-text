# viable alternative
## Resist Leftists 
### 
bob barker

Stanford moderates and
conservatives have joined forces to
enter the battle against the radical
leftists that will determine the
future fate of their campus.
Angered by the unabated string of
insane acts of terrorism and
violence, as well as by the
insistence of a "self-proclaimed
enlightened" minority to impose
their will on all, they have decided
to initiate a series of forums and
rallies to air their views on a
whole series of controversial
subjects. They hope to present
students with a viable alternative
to the left-wing radicals.
Their overall theme will be "let
the individual decide for himself."
Their prime target will be the
leftist clique of "self-proclaimed
messiahs" who insist on "saving
us from sin" whether we want
them to be our Big Brothers or
not.
The new group, the Students
for Responsible Action (SRA), is
composed of students scattered
through science, engineering,
business, and medical
departments. A rally in "Defense
of the Department of Defense"
has been chosen to be their first
public undertaking. It will be held
Tuesday, February 22, at
12:15 in White Plaza. The major
points which will be pressed for at
the rally are:
1) that ROTC programs be
reinstated at Stanford with full
credit, not only to guarantee
students the free opportunity to
seek a military career, but also to
help preserve this valuable input

of civilian-oriented officers into
our armed services.
2) that disruptions of the
Stanford Placement Service come
to an immediate end, so that
students be allowed to have as
wide a choice as possible in
choosing future employers,
subject only to their own
consciences.
3) that, in the light of the
continuing technological threat
from abroad, defense-related
research be not only allowed, but
also encouraged, on the Stanford
campus.
4) that any students desiring to
further and publicize their
respective ideologies limit their
on-campus activities to peaceful
rallies and constructive dialogue;
and that they refrain from
repeating such past irrational acts
as blind vandalism, interference in
the rights of other students, and
gunning down their opponents
(c.f.-shootings of right-wing
students at riots of a previous
spring.)
As a further point, they wish
to comment on President Nixon's
trip to Red China by offering him
their good wishes for the success
of his idealistically motivated
journey, but urge him to, under
no circumstances, endanger the
position of our friends, the
nationalist Chinese.
Representatives from a Bay Area
organization of students from the
Republic of China will be present
to speak on this point.

2) that disruptions of the
Stanford Placement Service come
to an immediate end, so that
students be allowed to have as
wide a choice as possible in
choosing future employers,
subject only to their own
consciences.
3) that, in the light of the
continuing technological threat
from abroad, defense-related
research be not only allowed, but
also encouraged, on the Stanford
campus.
4) that any students desiring to
further and publicize their
respective ideologies limit their
on-campus activities to peaceful
rallies and constructive dialogue;
and that they refrain from
repeating such past irrational acts
as blind vandalism, interference in
the rights of other students, and
gunning down their opponents
(c.f.-shootings of right-wing
students at riots of a previous
spring.)
As a further point, they wish
to comment on President Nixon's
trip to Red China by offering him
their good wishes for the success
of his idealistically motivated
journey, but urge him to, under
no circumstances, endanger the
position of our friends, the
nationalist Chinese.
Representatives from a Bay Area
organization of students from the
Republic of China will be present
to speak on this point.

Stanford moderates and
conservatives have joined forces to
enter the battle against the radical
leftists that will determine the
future fate of their campus.
Angered by the unabated string of
insane acts of terrorism and
violence, as well as by the
insistence of a "self-proclaimed
enlightened" minority to impose
their will on all, they have decided
to initiate a series of forums and
rallies to air their views on a
whole series of controversial
subjects. They hope to present
students with a viable alternative
to the left-wing radicals.
Their overall theme will be "let
the individual decide for himself."
Their prime target will be the
leftist clique of "self-proclaimed
messiahs" who insist on "saving
us from sin" whether we want
them to be our Big Brothers or
not.
The new group, the Students
for Responsible Action (SRA), is
composed of students scattered
through science, engineering,
business, and medical
departments. A rally in "Defense
of the Department of Defense"
has been chosen to be their first
public undertaking. It will be held
Tuesday, February 22, at
12:15 in White Plaza. The major
points which will be pressed for at
the rally are:
1) that ROTC programs be
reinstated at Stanford with full
credit, not only to guarantee
students the free opportunity to
seek a military career, but also to
help preserve this valuable input

of civilian-oriented officers into
our armed services.
2) that disruptions of the
Stanford Placement Service come
to an immediate end, so that
students be allowed to have as
wide a choice as possible in
choosing future employers,
subject only to their own
consciences.
3) that, in the light of the
continuing technological threat
from abroad, defense-related
research be not only allowed, but
also encouraged, on the Stanford
campus.
4) that any students desiring to
further and publicize their
respective ideologies limit their
on-campus activities to peaceful
rallies and constructive dialogue;
and that they refrain from
repeating such past irrational acts
as blind vandalism, interference in
the rights of other students, and
gunning down their opponents
(c.f.-shootings of right-wing
