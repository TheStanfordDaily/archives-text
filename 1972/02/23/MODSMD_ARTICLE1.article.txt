# Teamsters, Venceremos Hold 'Educational Meeting'
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Representatives of the Teamsters
Union and Venceremos met for nearly
two hours last night in Palo Alto to
"exchange information."
The Teamsters are one of three
organizations competing in the March
7 elections where 1,500 Stanford
employees will choose a union for
collective bargaining purposes.
Venceremos is a revolutionary group
based in Redwood City that has been
active in campus politics.
The Daily learned of the meeting at
Teamster Headquarters late last night,
and contacted members of both
groups, who denied making any deals
and said that there was nothing secret
about the conference.
"It was a frank and cordial
exchange of information," said Bruce
Franklin, former Stanford English
professor and one of several
Venceremos members who attended

the meeting.
John Dolly, Linda Grouse, Enid
Hunkeler and Bob Griffin also
represented the revolutionary group.
Surprise
Franklin first expressed surprise
that the Daily knew of the meeting,
but insisted there was "no effort to
hide from anybody or anything like
that. That's ridiculous . . . It's very
important that you combat the
impression that anything was secret or
closed."
He also claimed that there was not
any political wheeling or dealing:
"Nobody had anything to bargain or
borrow."
Keith Stothers of the Stanford
Teamsters Organizing Committee
expressed fear that news of the
meeting would harm the Teamsters
chance in the March election.
"The workers here are a funny
bunch and if we got tied in with them
[ Venceremos 1 we'd lose, just like
that," Stothers said.
Quick Disclaimer
He, too, was quick to disclaim any
hint of anything but an "educational"
meeting. "When they left we didn't
know if they were pro-Teamster or
anti-Teamster, but we felt they had
put up the questions and we had
answered them to the best of our
ability," Stothers said.
The meeting started around 7 p.m.
last night in the Teamster
Headquarters at Rickey's Hyatt House.
It lasted three hours and the groups
sent out on two occasions for food.
Franklin said that Venceremos was
trying to evaluate the advantages of
each union, and that group members
had discussed the issues before with
representatives of United Stanford
Employees (USE) and the Teamsters.
He called the California School
Employees Association-Stanford
Employees Association, the third
union in the race, a "company stooge"
and said that Venceremos wasn't even

giving it consideration as an alternative
solution.
Local Or International
"The real question is whether to
choose an independent local union or
a strong international one," he said.
Venceremos was expected by many
to take the side of USE without much
debate, but it hasn't worked out that
way. The last issue of Pamoja
Venceremos, the official organization
newspaper, admitted that the two
groups had close ties dating far back
into the past, but declined to back any
group.
Franklin said last night Venceremos
may issue an "analysis" of the
campaign closer to election time, fie
refused to predict how many votes it
might sway.
"If the analysis makes sense to
people, then they'll see that it's
correct," he said.
No Reluctance
Franklin said that the Teamsters
showed no reluctance to take part in
last night's meeting, which was set up
by Enid Hunkeler and Stothers.
"They'll get help from wherever it's
available," he pointed out. "They also
know we have quite a few comrades at
Stanford."
Kevin Ryan, business agent of
Teamsters Local 856, did most of the
talking last night for the union, but he
was joined by Stothers, Bob Rosa, and
Steve Cardoza, all of the Teamster
Stanford Organizing Committee.
"It felt kind of strange at first,"
admitted Cardoza of talking to a group
that wants to overthrow the system.
"But they didn't really come up with
anything of that sort."
The Teamsters have planned an
open meeting tonight in Bishop at 8
p.m. featuring West Coast organizer
Rudy Tham.
Tham missed last night's meeting
because of an illness in his family.

exchange of information," said Bruce
Franklin, former Stanford English
professor and one of several
Venceremos members who attended

the meeting.
John Dolly, Linda Grouse, Enid
Hunkeler and Bob Griffin also
represented the revolutionary group.
Surprise
Franklin first expressed surprise
that the Daily knew of the meeting,
but insisted there was "no effort to
hide from anybody or anything like
that. That's ridiculous . . . It's very
important that you combat the
impression that anything was secret or
closed."
He also claimed that there was not
any political wheeling or dealing:
"Nobody had anything to bargain or
borrow."
Keith Stothers of the Stanford
Teamsters Organizing Committee
expressed fear that news of the
meeting would harm the Teamsters
chance in the March election.
"The workers here are a funny
bunch and if we got tied in with them
[ Venceremos 1 we'd lose, just like
that," Stothers said.
Quick Disclaimer
He, too, was quick to disclaim any
hint of anything but an "educational"
meeting. "When they left we didn't
know if they were pro-Teamster or
anti-Teamster, but we felt they had
put up the questions and we had
answered them to the best of our
ability," Stothers said.
The meeting started around 7 p.m.
last night in the Teamster
Headquarters at Rickey's Hyatt House.
It lasted three hours and the groups
sent out on two occasions for food.
Franklin said that Venceremos was
trying to evaluate the advantages of
each union, and that group members
had discussed the issues before with
representatives of United Stanford
Employees (USE) and the Teamsters.
He called the California School
Employees Association-Stanford
Employees Association, the third
union in the race, a "company stooge"
and said that Venceremos wasn't even

giving it consideration as an alternative
solution.
Local Or International
"The real question is whether to
choose an independent local union or
a strong international one," he said.
Venceremos was expected by many
to take the side of USE without much
debate, but it hasn't worked out that
way. The last issue of Pamoja
Venceremos, the official organization
newspaper, admitted that the two
groups had close ties dating far back
into the past, but declined to back any
group.
Franklin said last night Venceremos
may issue an "analysis" of the
campaign closer to election time, fie
refused to predict how many votes it
might sway.
"If the analysis makes sense to
people, then they'll see that it's
correct," he said.
No Reluctance
Franklin said that the Teamsters
showed no reluctance to take part in
last night's meeting, which was set up
by Enid Hunkeler and Stothers.
"They'll get help from wherever it's
available," he pointed out. "They also
know we have quite a few comrades at
Stanford."
Kevin Ryan, business agent of
Teamsters Local 856, did most of the
talking last night for the union, but he
was joined by Stothers, Bob Rosa, and
Steve Cardoza, all of the Teamster
Stanford Organizing Committee.
"It felt kind of strange at first,"
admitted Cardoza of talking to a group
that wants to overthrow the system.
"But they didn't really come up with
anything of that sort."
The Teamsters have planned an
open meeting tonight in Bishop at 8
p.m. featuring West Coast organizer
Rudy Tham.
Tham missed last night's meeting
because of an illness in his family.

Representatives of the Teamsters
Union and Venceremos met for nearly
two hours last night in Palo Alto to
"exchange information."
The Teamsters are one of three
organizations competing in the March

collective bargaining purposes.
Venceremos is a revolutionary group

active in campus politics.

and contacted members of both

and said that there was nothing secret
