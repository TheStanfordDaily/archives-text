## The 						Induction Picture For 1972-1973 
### 
« susan swarmgen

We would like to discuss here the vulnerability of
men who turn 19 in 1972 and who are subject to
processing toward induction in 1973. We have no
quick answers or pat assurances, but we can discuss
military manpower needs and Selective Service
procedures.
A man may be inducted in 1973 only if there are
calls issued by the Department of Defense and if
Selective Service interprets those calls as including a
man's lottery number. Induction orders could be
mailed in early December, with an early January
reporting date, to those men who are classified I-A,
1-0, or I-A-0, no longer on appeal and presumed
acceptable for induction by having passed or waived
their pre-induction physicals.
It is not at all clear that there will be any calls for
induction in the first six months of 1973. The
executive authority to induct men who've never
held a deferment expires on June 30, 1973. It is not
expected to be renewed, nor can it be without
Congressional debate and authorization. The
Selective Service will continue to register and
classify men, and lottery drawings will presumably
be held each year, but inductions would cease. (The
President retains his authority to order to active
duty national guard and reserve personnel.)
Calls
Whether or not there will be calls during 1973
will depend in part on the patter of calls during
1972. If, for instance, there are no calls during the
last quarter of 1972, as seems likely at this writing,
the new President will find it politically awkward to
reinstate calls in 1973. The goal of zero draft calls,
firmly and publicly entrenched by the Nixon
administration and Congress, will be in even greater
public focus in the first few months of 1973. And if
current evidence continues, there will be little

manpower data then to support the need for
inductions.
There is ample information which suggests that
no inductions are necessary in 1972 to meet current
military manpower needs.
A pattern of sharply decreasing draft calls has
become clear as manpower needs have diminished.
Inductions during 1971 were nearly half the number
of accomplished inductions during 1970. There
were no inductions during four months of 1971.
The Secretary of Defense has announced that there
will be no inductions for the first three months of
1972.
Further, Congress has directed the Army to
reduce its troop strength by 10%, from current
estimated strength of 1,007,000 men to 892,000
men, by July 1,1972.
The Army is well able, nonetheless, to maintain
its total strength authorization without any
inductions in 1972 if the current ratio of
enlistments and retirements continue. The latest
report we have indicates that last summer, well
before the enactment of the military pay raises,
some 14,000 men per month were volunterring,
while 20,000-30,000 men per month retire from
active duty, both the military pay raise, effective
October 1, 1971, and the authority to pay bonuses
to men in hard to fill specialities such as infantry
and armor, are expected to increase the number of
volunteers.
To effect some minimal compliance with
Congressional intent, and perhaps to balance an
expected increase in volunteers, up to 60,000
draftees and first term volunteers will be required to
accept early discharges (up to 6 months early)
between now and June 30. The only way these men
can fill out their full terms is to accept a second full
term enlistment in the regular Army.

(Even last stummer during Congressional debate
on extension of the draft, as the Secretary of
Defense warned of a serious military manpower
crisis if the draft were not renewed, the Army
instructed its recruiters not to accept re-enlistments
from prior service personnel in the civilian
community. Reenlistments from within the Army
were sufficient to maintain its force, the Army said.
This order was rescinded shortly after it received
public notice.)
No Inductions?
So then, to reach this mandatory reduction in
troop strength by July 1,1972, it would appear that
the Army could not request any inductions in the 6
month period from January to June 1972. If
inductions are requested, we could assume a
political rather than a strictly manpower base for
the decision, possibly a trade-off for zero calls in the
latter half of this election year.
Traditionally, draft calls have always been
reduced during an election year and specifically
during the few months prior to the election.
President Nixon has pledged himself to try to reach
zero draft calls by June 1973 (when his authority to
induct ends) and if he is able to announce zero calls
a year in advance, he stands in good political stead.
To achieve this announcement, he may be pressured
by the Pentagon to accept token calls of several
thousand men per month during the middle of this
year, say in April, May, and June.
Absent a need, it seems temperate to suggest that
we may see small induction calls during the middle
of the year, and zero calls for the remainder of the
year. There remains only a vague possibility of calls
during 1973.
No Projections
No manpower projections for 1973 have been
made by the Department of Defense nor hinted at
by Selective Service. A I-H cutoff number for
processing 1973 First Priority registrants should be
announced soon. This number may well be set on
the high side, to cover the highest conceivable
number that might be reached in 1973, and may
approximate nmber 150. However, the actual
number reached should be a good deal lower.
Local boards are still under a national directive
to examine men who have lottery numbers of 50 or
below and who may be liable for induction this
year: that is, men who turn 20 this year and seniors
who expect to lose their deferments in June. If men
with numbers above 50 are deemed likely to by
inducted this year, then a higher limit may be set
and more men ordered to take their preinduction
physicals. Physical exams may be ordered at any
time, regardless of classification, but only if the
local board has first specifically determined that a
man is likely to be inducted in the near future.
These preinduction physicals may be transferred
to the Armed Forces Examining Station in Oakland
by taking the order to the nearest local board (San
Jose for those men living in Santa Clara County, San
Mateo for those men living in San Mateo Count) and
applying for transfer based on current residence.
Transfers are almost always granted. They must be
applied for in person on or before the reporting date
of the original order.
Request
If a man feels that he may be found either

temporarily or permanently disqualified on
physical, moral, or mental grounds, and if he has
never taken a preinduction physical, he may write
to his local board and request one. The board must
schedule the examination within 60 days of the date
of his request. If he is found unacceptable under
Army medical standards, he may not be inducted. If
he is found acceptable, and his medical
documentation suggests that he should not be, or if
he feels that he should not be, he may request a one
time only final review of his acceptability by the
U.S. Army Recruiting Command. This request for
final review is initiated upon his written request to
the local board. Technically, this review, a part of
the Registrants Medical Reexamination and Review
(RMRR) procedure, need not stay the issuance of
an induction order to an otherwise fully available
man, but in practice it usually does.
If a man has already had a preinduction physical
and has been found acceptable, but has either
additional or new medical evidence to submit, he
may ask for a "papers only" review under the
RMRR procedure. His medical papers are then
returned to the Examining Station for reevaluation.
If he is found unacceptable he will be sent a new
DD 62, Statement of Acceptability, by the Army,
with his unacceptability confirmed. The local board
will then send either a 4-F for a permanently
unacceptable condition, or a I-A (holding) for a
condition which may warrant future reexamination.
Further, a man may not be inducted until he has
either exhaused all appeals or waived them by not
appealing. Regardless of whether an appeal is
effective, a registrant is entitled to full appearance
and appeal rights before both his local board and
the State Appeal Board, (and the Presidential
Appeal Board if the appeal board vote is not
unanimous) as long as he requests them within 15
days of the date of mailing of his notice of denial, 112
he does not submit timely notice of appeal, his
board may reopen his classification only under
special circumstances.
Exception
An exception to this discretionary reopening
authority of the board is when a man claims to be a
conscientious objector and submits a completed SSS
Form 150. Upon submission of this form, the board
must reopen a man's classification and afford him
full appeal rights, including the right to bring
witnesses to his personal appearance before the
board and to receive written reasons for a denial of
his claim. During any appeal process, a local board
may not issue an induction or work order.
In summary, then, a man may be liable for
induction in the first 6 months of 1973 only if he is
20 or older, if there are calls issued which
encompass his lottery number in his priority
selection group, and if he is fully available, not
under appeal and adjudged fully acceptable under
Army medical standards. An induction order once
received may be postponed for a student until the
end of his current quarter or semester, at which
time a new reporting date will be mailed to him. A
man may enlist prior to the date the local board
mails him an induction order, but after that date
only with the approval of the Director of Selective
Service and the Secretary of Defense.

of accomplished inductions during 1970. There
were no inductions during four months of 1971.
The Secretary of Defense has announced that there
will be no inductions for the first three months of
1972.
Further, Congress has directed the Army to
reduce its troop strength by 10%, from current
estimated strength of 1,007,000 men to 892,000
men, by July 1,1972.
The Army is well able, nonetheless, to maintain
its total strength authorization without any
inductions in 1972 if the current ratio of
enlistments and retirements continue. The latest
report we have indicates that last summer, well
before the enactment of the military pay raises,
some 14,000 men per month were volunterring,
while 20,000-30,000 men per month retire from
active duty, both the military pay raise, effective
October 1, 1971, and the authority to pay bonuses
to men in hard to fill specialities such as infantry
and armor, are expected to increase the number of
volunteers.
To effect some minimal compliance with
Congressional intent, and perhaps to balance an
expected increase in volunteers, up to 60,000
draftees and first term volunteers will be required to
accept early discharges (up to 6 months early)
between now and June 30. The only way these men
can fill out their full terms is to accept a second full
term enlistment in the regular Army.

(Even last stummer during Congressional debate
on extension of the draft, as the Secretary of
Defense warned of a serious military manpower
crisis if the draft were not renewed, the Army
instructed its recruiters not to accept re-enlistments
from prior service personnel in the civilian
community. Reenlistments from within the Army
were sufficient to maintain its force, the Army said.
This order was rescinded shortly after it received
public notice.)
No Inductions?
So then, to reach this mandatory reduction in
troop strength by July 1,1972, it would appear that
the Army could not request any inductions in the 6
month period from January to June 1972. If
inductions are requested, we could assume a
political rather than a strictly manpower base for
the decision, possibly a trade-off for zero calls in the
latter half of this election year.
Traditionally, draft calls have always been
reduced during an election year and specifically
during the few months prior to the election.
President Nixon has pledged himself to try to reach
zero draft calls by June 1973 (when his authority to
induct ends) and if he is able to announce zero calls
a year in advance, he stands in good political stead.
To achieve this announcement, he may be pressured
by the Pentagon to accept token calls of several
thousand men per month during the middle of this
year, say in April, May, and June.
Absent a need, it seems temperate to suggest that
we may see small induction calls during the middle
of the year, and zero calls for the remainder of the
year. There remains only a vague possibility of calls
during 1973.
No Projections
No manpower projections for 1973 have been
made by the Department of Defense nor hinted at
by Selective Service. A I-H cutoff number for
processing 1973 First Priority registrants should be
announced soon. This number may well be set on
the high side, to cover the highest conceivable
number that might be reached in 1973, and may
approximate nmber 150. However, the actual
number reached should be a good deal lower.
Local boards are still under a national directive
to examine men who have lottery numbers of 50 or
below and who may be liable for induction this
year: that is, men who turn 20 this year and seniors
who expect to lose their deferments in June. If men
with numbers above 50 are deemed likely to by
inducted this year, then a higher limit may be set
and more men ordered to take their preinduction
physicals. Physical exams may be ordered at any
time, regardless of classification, but only if the
local board has first specifically determined that a
man is likely to be inducted in the near future.
These preinduction physicals may be transferred
to the Armed Forces Examining Station in Oakland
by taking the order to the nearest local board (San
Jose for those men living in Santa Clara County, San
Mateo for those men living in San Mateo Count) and
applying for transfer based on current residence.
Transfers are almost always granted. They must be
applied for in person on or before the reporting date
of the original order.
Request
If a man feels that he may be found either

temporarily or permanently disqualified on
physical, moral, or mental grounds, and if he has
never taken a preinduction physical, he may write
to his local board and request one. The board must
schedule the examination within 60 days of the date
of his request. If he is found unacceptable under
Army medical standards, he may not be inducted. If
he is found acceptable, and his medical
documentation suggests that he should not be, or if
he feels that he should not be, he may request a one
time only final review of his acceptability by the
U.S. Army Recruiting Command. This request for
final review is initiated upon his written request to
the local board. Technically, this review, a part of
the Registrants Medical Reexamination and Review
(RMRR) procedure, need not stay the issuance of
an induction order to an otherwise fully available
man, but in practice it usually does.
If a man has already had a preinduction physical
and has been found acceptable, but has either
additional or new medical evidence to submit, he
may ask for a "papers only" review under the
RMRR procedure. His medical papers are then
returned to the Examining Station for reevaluation.
If he is found unacceptable he will be sent a new
DD 62, Statement of Acceptability, by the Army,
with his unacceptability confirmed. The local board
will then send either a 4-F for a permanently
unacceptable condition, or a I-A (holding) for a
condition which may warrant future reexamination.
Further, a man may not be inducted until he has
either exhaused all appeals or waived them by not
appealing. Regardless of whether an appeal is
effective, a registrant is entitled to full appearance
and appeal rights before both his local board and
the State Appeal Board, (and the Presidential
Appeal Board if the appeal board vote is not
unanimous) as long as he requests them within 15
days of the date of mailing of his notice of denial, 112
he does not submit timely notice of appeal, his
board may reopen his classification only under
special circumstances.
Exception
An exception to this discretionary reopening
authority of the board is when a man claims to be a
conscientious objector and submits a completed SSS
Form 150. Upon submission of this form, the board
must reopen a man's classification and afford him
full appeal rights, including the right to bring
witnesses to his personal appearance before the
board and to receive written reasons for a denial of
his claim. During any appeal process, a local board
may not issue an induction or work order.
In summary, then, a man may be liable for
induction in the first 6 months of 1973 only if he is
20 or older, if there are calls issued which
encompass his lottery number in his priority
selection group, and if he is fully available, not
under appeal and adjudged fully acceptable under
Army medical standards. An induction order once
received may be postponed for a student until the
end of his current quarter or semester, at which
time a new reporting date will be mailed to him. A
man may enlist prior to the date the local board
mails him an induction order, but after that date
only with the approval of the Director of Selective
Service and the Secretary of Defense.

We would like to discuss here the vulnerability of
men who turn 19 in 1972 and who are subject to
processing toward induction in 1973. We have no
quick answers or pat assurances, but we can discuss
military manpower needs and Selective Service
procedures.
A man may be inducted in 1973 only if there are
calls issued by the Department of Defense and if
Selective Service interprets those calls as including a
man's lottery number. Induction orders could be
mailed in early December, with an early January
reporting date, to those men who are classified I-A,
1-0, or I-A-0, no longer on appeal and presumed
acceptable for induction by having passed or waived
their pre-induction physicals.
It is not at all clear that there will be any calls for
induction in the first six months of 1973. The
executive authority to induct men who've never
held a deferment expires on June 30, 1973. It is not
expected to be renewed, nor can it be without
Congressional debate and authorization. The
Selective Service will continue to register and
classify men, and lottery drawings will presumably
be held each year, but inductions would cease. (The
President retains his authority to order to active
duty national guard and reserve personnel.)
Calls
Whether or not there will be calls during 1973
will depend in part on the patter of calls during
1972. If, for instance, there are no calls during the
last quarter of 1972, as seems likely at this writing,
the new President will find it politically awkward to
reinstate calls in 1973. The goal of zero draft calls,
firmly and publicly entrenched by the Nixon
administration and Congress, will be in even greater
public focus in the first few months of 1973. And if
current evidence continues, there will be little

manpower data then to support the need for
inductions.
There is ample information which suggests that
no inductions are necessary in 1972 to meet current
military manpower needs.
A pattern of sharply decreasing draft calls has
become clear as manpower needs have diminished.
Inductions during 1971 were nearly half the number
of accomplished inductions during 1970. There
were no inductions during four months of 1971.

inductions are requested, we could assume a
political rather than a strictly manpower base for
the decision, possibly a trade-off for zero calls in the
latter half of this election year.
Traditionally, draft calls have always been
reduced during an election year and specifically
during the few months prior to the election.
President Nixon has pledged himself to try to reach
zero draft calls by June 1973 (when his authority to
induct ends) and if he is able to announce zero calls
a year in advance, he stands in good political stead.
To achieve this announcement, he may be pressured
by the Pentagon to accept token calls of several
thousand men per month during the middle of this
year, say in April, May, and June.
Absent a need, it seems temperate to suggest that
we may see small induction calls during the middle
of the year, and zero calls for the remainder of the
year. There remains only a vague possibility of calls
during 1973.
No Projections
No manpower projections for 1973 have been
made by the Department of Defense nor hinted at
by Selective Service. A I-H cutoff number for
processing 1973 First Priority registrants should be
announced soon. This number may well be set on
the high side, to cover the highest conceivable
number that might be reached in 1973, and may
approximate nmber 150. However, the actual
number reached should be a good deal lower.
Local boards are still under a national directive
to examine men who have lottery numbers of 50 or
below and who may be liable for induction this
year: that is, men who turn 20 this year and seniors
who expect to lose their deferments in June. If men
with numbers above 50 are deemed likely to by
inducted this year, then a higher limit may be set
and more men ordered to take their preinduction
physicals. Physical exams may be ordered at any
time, regardless of classification, but only if the
local board has first specifically determined that a
man is likely to be inducted in the near future.
These preinduction physicals may be transferred
to the Armed Forces Examining Station in Oakland
by taking the order to the nearest local board (San
Jose for those men living in Santa Clara County, San
Mateo for those men living in San Mateo Count) and
applying for transfer based on current residence.
Transfers are almost always granted. They must be
applied for in person on or before the reporting date
of the original order.
Request
If a man feels that he may be found either

temporarily or permanently disqualified on
physical, moral, or mental grounds, and if he has
never taken a preinduction physical, he may write
to his local board and request one. The board must
schedule the examination within 60 days of the date
of his request. If he is found unacceptable under
Army medical standards, he may not be inducted. If
he is found acceptable, and his medical
documentation suggests that he should not be, or if
he feels that he should not be, he may request a one
time only final review of his acceptability by the
U.S. Army Recruiting Command. This request for
final review is initiated upon his written request to
the local board. Technically, this review, a part of
the Registrants Medical Reexamination and Review
(RMRR) procedure, need not stay the issuance of
an induction order to an otherwise fully available
man, but in practice it usually does.
If a man has already had a preinduction physical
and has been found acceptable, but has either
additional or new medical evidence to submit, he
may ask for a "papers only" review under the
RMRR procedure. His medical papers are then
returned to the Examining Station for reevaluation.
If he is found unacceptable he will be sent a new
DD 62, Statement of Acceptability, by the Army,
with his unacceptability confirmed. The local board
will then send either a 4-F for a permanently
unacceptable condition, or a I-A (holding) for a
condition which may warrant future reexamination.
Further, a man may not be inducted until he has
either exhaused all appeals or waived them by not
appealing. Regardless of whether an appeal is
effective, a registrant is entitled to full appearance
and appeal rights before both his local board and
the State Appeal Board, (and the Presidential
Appeal Board if the appeal board vote is not
unanimous) as long as he requests them within 15
days of the date of mailing of his notice of denial, 112
he does not submit timely notice of appeal, his
board may reopen his classification only under
special circumstances.
Exception
An exception to this discretionary reopening
authority of the board is when a man claims to be a
conscientious objector and submits a completed SSS
Form 150. Upon submission of this form, the board
must reopen a man's classification and afford him
full appeal rights, including the right to bring
witnesses to his personal appearance before the
board and to receive written reasons for a denial of
his claim. During any appeal process, a local board
may not issue an induction or work order.
In summary, then, a man may be liable for
induction in the first 6 months of 1973 only if he is
20 or older, if there are calls issued which
encompass his lottery number in his priority
selection group, and if he is fully available, not
under appeal and adjudged fully acceptable under
Army medical standards. An induction order once
received may be postponed for a student until the
end of his current quarter or semester, at which
time a new reporting date will be mailed to him. A
man may enlist prior to the date the local board
mails him an induction order, but after that date
only with the approval of the Director of Selective
Service and the Secretary of Defense.

We would like to discuss here the vulnerability of
men who turn 19 in 1972 and who are subject to
processing toward induction in 1973. We have no
quick answers or pat assurances, but we can discuss
military manpower needs and Selective Service
procedures.
A man may be inducted in 1973 only if there are
calls issued by the Department of Defense and if
Selective Service interprets those calls as including a
man's lottery number. Induction orders could be
mailed in early December, with an early January
reporting date, to those men who are classified I-A,
1-0, or I-A-0, no longer on appeal and presumed
acceptable for induction by having passed or waived
their pre-induction physicals.
It is not at all clear that there will be any calls for
induction in the first six months of 1973. The
executive authority to induct men who've never
held a deferment expires on June 30, 1973. It is not
expected to be renewed, nor can it be without
Congressional debate and authorization. The
Selective Service will continue to register and
classify men, and lottery drawings will presumably
be held each year, but inductions would cease. (The
President retains his authority to order to active
duty national guard and reserve personnel.)
Calls
Whether or not there will be calls during 1973
will depend in part on the patter of calls during
1972. If, for instance, there are no calls during the
last quarter of 1972, as seems likely at this writing,
the new President will find it politically awkward to
reinstate calls in 1973. The goal of zero draft calls,
firmly and publicly entrenched by the Nixon
administration and Congress, will be in even greater
public focus in the first few months of 1973. And if
current evidence continues, there will be little

manpower data then to support the need for
inductions.
There is ample information which suggests that
no inductions are necessary in 1972 to meet current
military manpower needs.
A pattern of sharply decreasing draft calls has
become clear as manpower needs have diminished.
Inductions during 1971 were nearly half the number
of accomplished inductions during 1970. There
were no inductions during four months of 1971.
The Secretary of Defense has announced that there
will be no inductions for the first three months of
1972.
Further, Congress has directed the Army to
reduce its troop strength by 10%, from current
estimated strength of 1,007,000 men to 892,000
men, by July 1,1972.
The Army is well able, nonetheless, to maintain
its total strength authorization without any
inductions in 1972 if the current ratio of
enlistments and retirements continue. The latest
report we have indicates that last summer, well
before the enactment of the military pay raises,
some 14,000 men per month were volunterring,
while 20,000-30,000 men per month retire from
active duty, both the military pay raise, effective
October 1, 1971, and the authority to pay bonuses
to men in hard to fill specialities such as infantry
and armor, are expected to increase the number of
volunteers.
To effect some minimal compliance with
Congressional intent, and perhaps to balance an
expected increase in volunteers, up to 60,000
draftees and first term volunteers will be required to
accept early discharges (up to 6 months early)
between now and June 30. The only way these men
can fill out their full terms is to accept a second full
term enlistment in the regular Army.

(Even last stummer during Congressional debate
on extension of the draft, as the Secretary of
Defense warned of a serious military manpower
crisis if the draft were not renewed, the Army
instructed its recruiters not to accept re-enlistments
from prior service personnel in the civilian
community. Reenlistments from within the Army
were sufficient to maintain its force, the Army said.
This order was rescinded shortly after it received
public notice.)
No Inductions?
So then, to reach this mandatory reduction in
troop strength by July 1,1972, it would appear that
the Army could not request any inductions in the 6
month period from January to June 1972. If
inductions are requested, we could assume a
political rather than a strictly manpower base for
the decision, possibly a trade-off for zero calls in the

Transfers are almost always granted. They must be
applied for in person on or before the reporting date
of the original order.
Request
If a man feels that he may be found either

temporarily or permanently disqualified on
physical, moral, or mental grounds, and if he has
never taken a preinduction physical, he may write
to his local board and request one. The board must
schedule the examination within 60 days of the date
of his request. If he is found unacceptable under
Army medical standards, he may not be inducted. If
he is found acceptable, and his medical
documentation suggests that he should not be, or if
he feels that he should not be, he may request a one
time only final review of his acceptability by the
U.S. Army Recruiting Command. This request for
final review is initiated upon his written request to
the local board. Technically, this review, a part of
the Registrants Medical Reexamination and Review
(RMRR) procedure, need not stay the issuance of
an induction order to an otherwise fully available
man, but in practice it usually does.
If a man has already had a preinduction physical
and has been found acceptable, but has either
additional or new medical evidence to submit, he
may ask for a "papers only" review under the
RMRR procedure. His medical papers are then
returned to the Examining Station for reevaluation.
If he is found unacceptable he will be sent a new
DD 62, Statement of Acceptability, by the Army,
with his unacceptability confirmed. The local board
will then send either a 4-F for a permanently
unacceptable condition, or a I-A (holding) for a
condition which may warrant future reexamination.
Further, a man may not be inducted until he has
either exhaused all appeals or waived them by not
appealing. Regardless of whether an appeal is
effective, a registrant is entitled to full appearance
and appeal rights before both his local board and
the State Appeal Board, (and the Presidential
Appeal Board if the appeal board vote is not
unanimous) as long as he requests them within 15
days of the date of mailing of his notice of denial, 112
he does not submit timely notice of appeal, his
board may reopen his classification only under
special circumstances.
Exception
An exception to this discretionary reopening
authority of the board is when a man claims to be a
conscientious objector and submits a completed SSS
Form 150. Upon submission of this form, the board
must reopen a man's classification and afford him
full appeal rights, including the right to bring
witnesses to his personal appearance before the
board and to receive written reasons for a denial of
his claim. During any appeal process, a local board
may not issue an induction or work order.
In summary, then, a man may be liable for
induction in the first 6 months of 1973 only if he is
20 or older, if there are calls issued which
encompass his lottery number in his priority
selection group, and if he is fully available, not
under appeal and adjudged fully acceptable under
Army medical standards. An induction order once
received may be postponed for a student until the
end of his current quarter or semester, at which
time a new reporting date will be mailed to him. A
man may enlist prior to the date the local board
mails him an induction order, but after that date
only with the approval of the Director of Selective
Service and the Secretary of Defense.

We would like to discuss here the vulnerability of
men who turn 19 in 1972 and who are subject to
processing toward induction in 1973. We have no
quick answers or pat assurances, but we can discuss
military manpower needs and Selective Service
procedures.
A man may be inducted in 1973 only if there are
calls issued by the Department of Defense and if
Selective Service interprets those calls as including a
man's lottery number. Induction orders could be
mailed in early December, with an early January
reporting date, to those men who are classified I-A,
1-0, or I-A-0, no longer on appeal and presumed
acceptable for induction by having passed or waived
their pre-induction physicals.
It is not at all clear that there will be any calls for
induction in the first six months of 1973. The
executive authority to induct men who've never
held a deferment expires on June 30, 1973. It is not
expected to be renewed, nor can it be without
Congressional debate and authorization. The
Selective Service will continue to register and
classify men, and lottery drawings will presumably
be held each year, but inductions would cease. (The
President retains his authority to order to active
duty national guard and reserve personnel.)
Calls
Whether or not there will be calls during 1973
will depend in part on the patter of calls during
1972. If, for instance, there are no calls during the
last quarter of 1972, as seems likely at this writing,
the new President will find it politically awkward to
reinstate calls in 1973. The goal of zero draft calls,
firmly and publicly entrenched by the Nixon
administration and Congress, will be in even greater
public focus in the first few months of 1973. And if
current evidence continues, there will be little

manpower data then to support the need for
inductions.
There is ample information which suggests that
no inductions are necessary in 1972 to meet current
military manpower needs.
A pattern of sharply decreasing draft calls has
become clear as manpower needs have diminished.
Inductions during 1971 were nearly half the number
of accomplished inductions during 1970. There
were no inductions during four months of 1971.
The Secretary of Defense has announced that there
will be no inductions for the first three months of
1972.
Further, Congress has directed the Army to
reduce its troop strength by 10%, from current
estimated strength of 1,007,000 men to 892,000
men, by July 1,1972.
The Army is well able, nonetheless, to maintain
its total strength authorization without any
inductions in 1972 if the current ratio of
enlistments and retirements continue. The latest
report we have indicates that last summer, well
before the enactment of the military pay raises,
some 14,000 men per month were volunterring,
while 20,000-30,000 men per month retire from
active duty, both the military pay raise, effective
October 1, 1971, and the authority to pay bonuses
to men in hard to fill specialities such as infantry
and armor, are expected to increase the number of
volunteers.
To effect some minimal compliance with
Congressional intent, and perhaps to balance an
expected increase in volunteers, up to 60,000
draftees and first term volunteers will be required to
accept early discharges (up to 6 months early)
between now and June 30. The only way these men
can fill out their full terms is to accept a second full
term enlistment in the regular Army.

(Even last stummer during Congressional debate
on extension of the draft, as the Secretary of
Defense warned of a serious military manpower
crisis if the draft were not renewed, the Army
instructed its recruiters not to accept re-enlistments
from prior service personnel in the civilian
community. Reenlistments from within the Army
were sufficient to maintain its force, the Army said.
This order was rescinded shortly after it received
public notice.)
No Inductions?
So then, to reach this mandatory reduction in
troop strength by July 1,1972, it would appear that
the Army could not request any inductions in the 6
month period from January to June 1972. If
inductions are requested, we could assume a
political rather than a strictly manpower base for
the decision, possibly a trade-off for zero calls in the
latter half of this election year.
Traditionally, draft calls have always been
reduced during an election year and specifically
during the few months prior to the election.
President Nixon has pledged himself to try to reach
zero draft calls by June 1973 (when his authority to
induct ends) and if he is able to announce zero calls
a year in advance, he stands in good political stead.
To achieve this announcement, he may be pressured
by the Pentagon to accept token calls of several
thousand men per month during the middle of this
year, say in April, May, and June.
Absent a need, it seems temperate to suggest that
we may see small induction calls during the middle
of the year, and zero calls for the remainder of the
year. There remains only a vague possibility of calls
during 1973.
No Projections
No manpower projections for 1973 have been
made by the Department of Defense nor hinted at
by Selective Service. A I-H cutoff number for
processing 1973 First Priority registrants should be
announced soon. This number may well be set on
the high side, to cover the highest conceivable
number that might be reached in 1973, and may
approximate nmber 150. However, the actual
number reached should be a good deal lower.
Local boards are still under a national directive
to examine men who have lottery numbers of 50 or
below and who may be liable for induction this
year: that is, men who turn 20 this year and seniors
who expect to lose their deferments in June. If men
with numbers above 50 are deemed likely to by
inducted this year, then a higher limit may be set
and more men ordered to take their preinduction
physicals. Physical exams may be ordered at any
time, regardless of classification, but only if the
local board has first specifically determined that a
man is likely to be inducted in the near future.
These preinduction physicals may be transferred
to the Armed Forces Examining Station in Oakland
by taking the order to the nearest local board (San
Jose for those men living in Santa Clara County, San
Mateo for those men living in San Mateo Count) and
applying for transfer based on current residence.
Transfers are almost always granted. They must be
applied for in person on or before the reporting date
of the original order.

temporarily or permanently disqualified on
physical, moral, or mental grounds, and if he has

An exception to this discretionary reopening
authority of the board is when a man claims to be a
conscientious objector and submits a completed SSS
Form 150. Upon submission of this form, the board
must reopen a man's classification and afford him
full appeal rights, including the right to bring
witnesses to his personal appearance before the
board and to receive written reasons for a denial of
his claim. During any appeal process, a local board
may not issue an induction or work order.
In summary, then, a man may be liable for
induction in the first 6 months of 1973 only if he is
20 or older, if there are calls issued which
encompass his lottery number in his priority
selection group, and if he is fully available, not
under appeal and adjudged fully acceptable under
Army medical standards. An induction order once
received may be postponed for a student until the
end of his current quarter or semester, at which
time a new reporting date will be mailed to him. A
man may enlist prior to the date the local board
mails him an induction order, but after that date
only with the approval of the Director of Selective
Service and the Secretary of Defense.
