Editor, THE DAILY:
Last Wednesday's verbal attack
on Professor Shockley as a person
is intolerable in a University
community. When students
demean someone who puts forth a
strange view, they damage their
own education and that of those
to come.
I happen to be a specialist in
mental testing and I have
published my criticisms of
Jensen's statements. If I did not
have better uses of my time and if
others had not done the job well,
I would publish rejoinders to
Shockley. But reality must be
respected. There is quite sufficient
evidence that the brain, as part of
the body, is affected by the genes.
It is merely balm for the ego to
say, "If I had had the breaks, I'd
be Einstein."
And on the other hand — no
evidence that I believe supports
the view that children whose
parents had little education are
biologically inferior to those
whose parents were economically
luckier or persevered longer in
school. As Lita Furby, one of our
recent graduate, says (in a review
of Eysenck's book which makes
much of race differences), once
you admit the biological truth
that in a given environment some
genes flourish and not others, you
have to acknowledge that there
are possible environments where
blacks will turn out superior to
whites, on the average.
That being said, we come back
to the fact that a University is an

arena for a contest of thoughts.
Stampedes and stompings have no
place here.
One cannot deny the link
between biology and intellect.
One cannot deny the link between
environment and intellect. One
can, however, reject and damn
members of a University
community who think that
holding up an unpopular view for
public examination should be
subject to penalty.
I have to add one remark on
the side of those who attack
Shockley. If it is true that he has
hurt the academic rights of any
student or faculty member,
formal charges are in order.

I received a letter from Menlo
Park the morning of my Faculty
Club hearing. It was signed by a
pseudonym and reads as follows:
"Kwonping ho (sic) — you
foreign scum, objecting to
American presence in Thailand —
(If they were not there you would
be overrun by your favorite
enemies — you know it — and you
would not be able to go abroad
and supposedly "study") but
daring to besmear and dirty your
host country.
"If you really had Thailand's
interest on your mind, you would
go home and tell your pimps
around the bases that they are the
ones who start the brothels,
because it is they who are

corrupted.
"You coolie of the third world,
how you do not choke on the
imperialist food is beyond me—
"Yes, cry my beloved America,
for letting such prostituted minds
like yours, to enter it."
I would be depressed by such
hate mail but someone told me
encouragingly, "Cheer up, hate
mail shows that you must be
doing something right."

Editor, THE DAILY:
In her letter to the Daily
published on February 17, Ann
Kimball asks why don't "those of
us who don't have school age
children . . . refuse to pay
property tax," and why don't
"those of us who are still -
young . . .withhold the portion of
our taxes which goes to social
security," if we are not using the
services?
Kimball's suggestion is an
eminently reasonable one, except
for the fact that the government
forces people to pay taxes. So you
can't pick and choose the services
you want or need.
Coincidentally, on the same
page that Kimball's letter was
published, there was an opinion
column by Marcy Kahn which
drew heavily upon the legal
philosophy of Lysander Spooner,
a Civil War-era constitutional
lawyer.
If Kimball would read the No
Treason pamphlets written by

Spooner and cited by Kahn in her
column, Kimball would learn how
like a highwayman or common
thief the governmental apparatus
really is, though Spooner points
out that a highwayman has more
to be said in his favor than a
government official does. At least
a highwayman lets his victim go
after he robs him; a government
official not only robs his victim,
but harasses his victim day in and
day out too.
With this analogy in mind, one
could aptly describe the recent fee
assessment election as a
highwayman robbing people in
order to pay the highwayman's
baby-sitter.
