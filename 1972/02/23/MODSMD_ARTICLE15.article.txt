# 'Aida' Opens New San Jose Theatre
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
The logic of it all was brutally
simple: for the grand opening of
the San Jose Community Theatre
one ought to stage a grand opera
which would require nearly the
entire musical community of San
Jose. This led ineluctably to the
choice of Verdi's " Aida," one of
the most densely populated and
spectacular operas of all.
It took a startling amount of
blind courage for the young San
Jose Opera Association to attempt
"Aida." If anything, this opera
cries to be overdone: skimping
either in production or voices
becomes immediately and
painfully apparent. I came
prepared to make concessions for
this seeming Mission Impossible
but happily did not have to make
any. Though "Aida" has been
done with more dramatic finesse
and musical refinement, this
production was thoroughly
enjoyable — indeed often moving
and effective.
Though the evening was long (a
late start and three intervals), it
passed quickly as the cast and
orchestra gained momentum. Act
111 can seem quite pallid and slow
coming as it does on the heels of
the Triumphal Scene (which,
incidentally, came to a conclusion
of catapulting brilliance), but here
its beauty and drama was fully
realized as the singers
simultaneously hit their stride.
Only a director more anxious to
stamp our archaicisms of stage
movement could have measurably
improved this "Aida."
Attractive Villainess
Grace Bumbry, the one
undoubtedly world-class singer in
the cast, gave a high-powered and
incisive Amneris ~ one of Verdi's
most attractive villainesses.
Bumbry is at the height of her
powers. Her mature, rich mezzo
never betrays the occupational
maladies of this register,
unwieldiness and hollowness. And
Bumbry knows how to maintain
dramatic interest through
vocalism, though I felt that in
terms of stage movement she was
not trying as hard as she might on
a more important operatic stage.
The Aida of Marisa Galvany was
uneven, but thrillinglv so. Her
voice has its peculiarities. There is
a break in her range which she has
difficulty traversing, and she is
either disinclined or unable to sing

mezzoforte. The result is slight
monotony in her vocal character.
Still and all, Galvany has
considerable power and — as is
often true with voices teetering on
the brink of uncontrol (like
Suliotis or Callas) — she produced
many exciting moments. Her
lower register is extremely fine.
The Rhadames of the evening
was tenor Chris Lachonas. Though
he left no fires burning in his
path, he sang creditably. Some
singers whose vocal resources have
fairly clear limits know how to
emote their way through
treacherous passages. Lachonas is
one, and he rose nicely to the
challanges of the last acts.
Huge bass Ezio Flagello, a
ringer imported from the N.Y.
Met, was the Incredible Hulk both
in voice and stature, which is
perfectly all right for the
ungrateful role of the High Priest.
Robert McFerrin, as the King
of Ethiopia and Aida's father,
made some striking impressions.
His gestures were disconcertingly
mannic — in fact, his best scene
visually found him manacled. (It
is a shame that stage action
doesn't allow directors to use
manacles more often.) But
McFerrin's voice is another matter
entirely: it is a powerful, arching,
appealing baritone within hailing
distance of Leonard Warren. Why
haven't I heard of McFerrin
before? He certainly equals or
betters many baritones on the
roster of the S.F. Opera.
Producer-Conductor James K.
Guthrie, from whose brow this
"Aida" seems to have sprung
full-fledged, led an orchestra that
was on generally fine behavior
barring some stridency in the
strings and blat-a-blat horn
attacks. The huge chorus lacked
ultimate homogeneity (and
possessed a few voices that should
have been supernumeraries), but
its force of blast, to use a Shavian
phrase, was admirably suited to
"Aida's" choral moments.
It remains only to mention the
added fillips which make "Aida" a
really grand bit of pageantry. The
scenery and costumes, borrowed
from the Seattle Opera, were
thoroughly adequate, if
sometimes over-ingenious. The
corps dc ballet performed the
usual pseudo-hieroglyphic sort of
choreography with considerable
verve. And the stage trumpets

were almost perfect. The animals
— tiger, elephant, camel — were
applauded gleefully by the
audience. If I were a singer,
however, 1 would refuse to be on
stage with an animal. They are
even worse than children as
scene-stealers. Poor Bumbry had
to suffer the indignity of
beginning her Act I scene amid
applause for a reluctantly exiting
cheetah.

The new building for the
Community Theatre (I could do
without this affected spelling, by
the way) deserves mention. It
came from the designers of the
Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation
— and it does have Wright's
distinctiveness. It is one of the
new through-designed affairs
where everything from drinking
fountains to waste receptacles is
coordinated. The theme in this
case is the circle. I fould myself
after a time wishing perversely for
something square — a toilet bowl
or anything. No such luck.
The exterior of the facility has
a very pleasing contour, the only
serious lapse in taste, I thought,
being the circular white lights
which ring the roof-line. They
have a breath of tawdriness about
them. Inside, the building's lines
lead the eyes about pleasantly, if
somewhat restlessly. The lobby is
certainly too small and some
bottle-necking will require further
study of the audience's traffic

patterns.
Seating (total for an orchestra
and grand tier is 2700) is
European style, meaning no aisles.
This results in rows of up to 80
seats. And while the seats are
more generously spaced, the
occasions for discourtesy and
interruption in seating are clearly
going to be more than desirable.
Acoustical Qualities
The jury is still out on the
acoustical qualities of the hall.
The sound from my seat a third of
the way from the stage presented
no problems, though there was
some mention of echo from the
area under the over-hang. The
sound perceived by the singers on
stage also remains to be surveyed.
Added to the Flint Center at
Cupertino, the Theatre makes the
Peninsula considerably less
top-heavy in facilities for major
cultural attractions. Any step in
this direction in this age of
fantastic building and production
expenses is encouraging, and San
Jose's citizens should by proud of
their new cultural center.
A final note: the programs for
the opera (which ran out after a
third of the audience was seated)
should never EVER fail to give a
synopsis of the opera nd
biographies of the singers. Perhaps
I underestimate the San Jose
audience, but J conceive there
were some who didn't know what
the hell was going on on stage.

Attractive Villainess
Grace Bumbry, the one
undoubtedly world-class singer in
the cast, gave a high-powered and
incisive Amneris ~ one of Verdi's
most attractive villainesses.
Bumbry is at the height of her
powers. Her mature, rich mezzo
never betrays the occupational
maladies of this register,
unwieldiness and hollowness. And
Bumbry knows how to maintain
dramatic interest through
vocalism, though I felt that in
terms of stage movement she was
not trying as hard as she might on
a more important operatic stage.
The Aida of Marisa Galvany was
uneven, but thrillinglv so. Her
voice has its peculiarities. There is
a break in her range which she has
difficulty traversing, and she is
either disinclined or unable to sing

mezzoforte. The result is slight
monotony in her vocal character.
Still and all, Galvany has
considerable power and — as is
often true with voices teetering on
the brink of uncontrol (like
Suliotis or Callas) — she produced
many exciting moments. Her
lower register is extremely fine.
The Rhadames of the evening
was tenor Chris Lachonas. Though
he left no fires burning in his
path, he sang creditably. Some
singers whose vocal resources have
fairly clear limits know how to
emote their way through
treacherous passages. Lachonas is
one, and he rose nicely to the
challanges of the last acts.
Huge bass Ezio Flagello, a
ringer imported from the N.Y.
Met, was the Incredible Hulk both
in voice and stature, which is
perfectly all right for the
ungrateful role of the High Priest.
Robert McFerrin, as the King
of Ethiopia and Aida's father,
made some striking impressions.
His gestures were disconcertingly
mannic — in fact, his best scene
visually found him manacled. (It
is a shame that stage action
doesn't allow directors to use
manacles more often.) But
McFerrin's voice is another matter
entirely: it is a powerful, arching,
appealing baritone within hailing
distance of Leonard Warren. Why
haven't I heard of McFerrin
before? He certainly equals or
betters many baritones on the
roster of the S.F. Opera.
Producer-Conductor James K.
Guthrie, from whose brow this
"Aida" seems to have sprung
full-fledged, led an orchestra that
was on generally fine behavior
barring some stridency in the
strings and blat-a-blat horn
attacks. The huge chorus lacked
ultimate homogeneity (and
possessed a few voices that should
have been supernumeraries), but
its force of blast, to use a Shavian
phrase, was admirably suited to
"Aida's" choral moments.
It remains only to mention the
added fillips which make "Aida" a
really grand bit of pageantry. The
scenery and costumes, borrowed
from the Seattle Opera, were
thoroughly adequate, if
sometimes over-ingenious. The
corps dc ballet performed the
usual pseudo-hieroglyphic sort of
choreography with considerable
verve. And the stage trumpets

were almost perfect. The animals
— tiger, elephant, camel — were
applauded gleefully by the
audience. If I were a singer,
however, 1 would refuse to be on
stage with an animal. They are
even worse than children as
scene-stealers. Poor Bumbry had
to suffer the indignity of
beginning her Act I scene amid
applause for a reluctantly exiting
cheetah.

The new building for the
Community Theatre (I could do
without this affected spelling, by
the way) deserves mention. It
came from the designers of the
Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation
— and it does have Wright's
distinctiveness. It is one of the
new through-designed affairs
where everything from drinking
fountains to waste receptacles is
coordinated. The theme in this
case is the circle. I fould myself
after a time wishing perversely for
something square — a toilet bowl
or anything. No such luck.
The exterior of the facility has
a very pleasing contour, the only
serious lapse in taste, I thought,
being the circular white lights
which ring the roof-line. They
have a breath of tawdriness about
them. Inside, the building's lines
lead the eyes about pleasantly, if
somewhat restlessly. The lobby is
certainly too small and some
bottle-necking will require further
study of the audience's traffic

patterns.
Seating (total for an orchestra
and grand tier is 2700) is
European style, meaning no aisles.
This results in rows of up to 80
seats. And while the seats are
more generously spaced, the
occasions for discourtesy and
interruption in seating are clearly
going to be more than desirable.
Acoustical Qualities
The jury is still out on the
acoustical qualities of the hall.
The sound from my seat a third of
the way from the stage presented
no problems, though there was
some mention of echo from the
area under the over-hang. The
sound perceived by the singers on
stage also remains to be surveyed.
Added to the Flint Center at
Cupertino, the Theatre makes the
Peninsula considerably less
top-heavy in facilities for major
cultural attractions. Any step in
this direction in this age of
fantastic building and production
expenses is encouraging, and San
Jose's citizens should by proud of
their new cultural center.
A final note: the programs for
the opera (which ran out after a
third of the audience was seated)
should never EVER fail to give a
synopsis of the opera nd
biographies of the singers. Perhaps
I underestimate the San Jose
audience, but J conceive there
were some who didn't know what
the hell was going on on stage.

OPENING NIGHT—Mezzo Soprano Grace Bumbry's brilliant
Amneris highlighted the production of "Aida" which opened the new
San Jose Community Theatre last Thursday night.
The logic of it all was brutally
simple: for the grand opening of
the San Jose Community Theatre
one ought to stage a grand opera
which would require nearly the
entire musical community of San
Jose. This led ineluctably to the
choice of Verdi's " Aida," one of
the most densely populated and
spectacular operas of all.
It took a startling amount of
blind courage for the young San
Jose Opera Association to attempt
"Aida." If anything, this opera
cries to be overdone: skimping
either in production or voices
becomes immediately and
painfully apparent. I came
prepared to make concessions for
this seeming Mission Impossible
but happily did not have to make
any. Though "Aida" has been
done with more dramatic finesse
and musical refinement, this
production was thoroughly
enjoyable — indeed often moving
and effective.
Though the evening was long (a
late start and three intervals), it
passed quickly as the cast and
orchestra gained momentum. Act
111 can seem quite pallid and slow
coming as it does on the heels of
the Triumphal Scene (which,
incidentally, came to a conclusion
of catapulting brilliance), but here
its beauty and drama was fully
realized as the singers
simultaneously hit their stride.
Only a director more anxious to
stamp our archaicisms of stage
movement could have measurably
improved this "Aida."

one, and he rose nicely to the
challanges of the last acts.
Huge bass Ezio Flagello, a
ringer imported from the N.Y.
Met, was the Incredible Hulk both
in voice and stature, which is
perfectly all right for the
ungrateful role of the High Priest.
Robert McFerrin, as the King
of Ethiopia and Aida's father,
made some striking impressions.
His gestures were disconcertingly
mannic — in fact, his best scene
visually found him manacled. (It
is a shame that stage action
doesn't allow directors to use
manacles more often.) But
McFerrin's voice is another matter
entirely: it is a powerful, arching,
appealing baritone within hailing
distance of Leonard Warren. Why
haven't I heard of McFerrin
before? He certainly equals or
betters many baritones on the
roster of the S.F. Opera.
Producer-Conductor James K.
Guthrie, from whose brow this
"Aida" seems to have sprung
full-fledged, led an orchestra that
was on generally fine behavior
barring some stridency in the
strings and blat-a-blat horn
attacks. The huge chorus lacked
ultimate homogeneity (and
possessed a few voices that should
have been supernumeraries), but
its force of blast, to use a Shavian
phrase, was admirably suited to
"Aida's" choral moments.
It remains only to mention the
added fillips which make "Aida" a
really grand bit of pageantry. The
scenery and costumes, borrowed
from the Seattle Opera, were
thoroughly adequate, if
sometimes over-ingenious. The
corps dc ballet performed the
usual pseudo-hieroglyphic sort of
choreography with considerable
verve. And the stage trumpets

were almost perfect. The animals
— tiger, elephant, camel — were
applauded gleefully by the
audience. If I were a singer,
however, 1 would refuse to be on
stage with an animal. They are
even worse than children as
scene-stealers. Poor Bumbry had
to suffer the indignity of
beginning her Act I scene amid
applause for a reluctantly exiting
cheetah.

The new building for the
Community Theatre (I could do
without this affected spelling, by
the way) deserves mention. It
came from the designers of the
Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation
— and it does have Wright's
distinctiveness. It is one of the
new through-designed affairs
where everything from drinking
fountains to waste receptacles is
coordinated. The theme in this
case is the circle. I fould myself
after a time wishing perversely for
something square — a toilet bowl
or anything. No such luck.
The exterior of the facility has
a very pleasing contour, the only
serious lapse in taste, I thought,
being the circular white lights
which ring the roof-line. They
have a breath of tawdriness about
them. Inside, the building's lines
lead the eyes about pleasantly, if
somewhat restlessly. The lobby is
certainly too small and some
bottle-necking will require further
study of the audience's traffic

patterns.
Seating (total for an orchestra
and grand tier is 2700) is
European style, meaning no aisles.
This results in rows of up to 80
seats. And while the seats are
more generously spaced, the
occasions for discourtesy and
interruption in seating are clearly
going to be more than desirable.
Acoustical Qualities
The jury is still out on the
acoustical qualities of the hall.
The sound from my seat a third of
the way from the stage presented
no problems, though there was
some mention of echo from the
area under the over-hang. The
sound perceived by the singers on
stage also remains to be surveyed.
Added to the Flint Center at
Cupertino, the Theatre makes the
Peninsula considerably less
top-heavy in facilities for major
cultural attractions. Any step in
this direction in this age of
fantastic building and production
expenses is encouraging, and San
Jose's citizens should by proud of
their new cultural center.
A final note: the programs for
the opera (which ran out after a
third of the audience was seated)
should never EVER fail to give a
synopsis of the opera nd
biographies of the singers. Perhaps
I underestimate the San Jose
audience, but J conceive there
were some who didn't know what
the hell was going on on stage.

OPENING NIGHT—Mezzo Soprano Grace Bumbry's brilliant
Amneris highlighted the production of "Aida" which opened the new
San Jose Community Theatre last Thursday night.
The logic of it all was brutally
simple: for the grand opening of
the San Jose Community Theatre
one ought to stage a grand opera
which would require nearly the
entire musical community of San
Jose. This led ineluctably to the
choice of Verdi's " Aida," one of
the most densely populated and
spectacular operas of all.
It took a startling amount of
blind courage for the young San
Jose Opera Association to attempt
"Aida." If anything, this opera
cries to be overdone: skimping
either in production or voices
becomes immediately and
painfully apparent. I came
prepared to make concessions for
this seeming Mission Impossible
but happily did not have to make
any. Though "Aida" has been
done with more dramatic finesse
and musical refinement, this
production was thoroughly
enjoyable — indeed often moving
and effective.
Though the evening was long (a
late start and three intervals), it
passed quickly as the cast and
orchestra gained momentum. Act
111 can seem quite pallid and slow
coming as it does on the heels of
the Triumphal Scene (which,
incidentally, came to a conclusion
of catapulting brilliance), but here
its beauty and drama was fully
realized as the singers
simultaneously hit their stride.
Only a director more anxious to
stamp our archaicisms of stage
movement could have measurably
improved this "Aida."
Attractive Villainess
Grace Bumbry, the one
undoubtedly world-class singer in
the cast, gave a high-powered and
incisive Amneris ~ one of Verdi's
most attractive villainesses.
Bumbry is at the height of her
powers. Her mature, rich mezzo
never betrays the occupational
maladies of this register,
unwieldiness and hollowness. And
Bumbry knows how to maintain
dramatic interest through
vocalism, though I felt that in
terms of stage movement she was
not trying as hard as she might on
a more important operatic stage.
The Aida of Marisa Galvany was
uneven, but thrillinglv so. Her
voice has its peculiarities. There is
a break in her range which she has
difficulty traversing, and she is
either disinclined or unable to sing

mezzoforte. The result is slight
monotony in her vocal character.
Still and all, Galvany has
considerable power and — as is
often true with voices teetering on
the brink of uncontrol (like
Suliotis or Callas) — she produced
many exciting moments. Her
lower register is extremely fine.
The Rhadames of the evening
was tenor Chris Lachonas. Though
he left no fires burning in his
path, he sang creditably. Some
singers whose vocal resources have
fairly clear limits know how to
emote their way through
treacherous passages. Lachonas is
one, and he rose nicely to the
challanges of the last acts.
Huge bass Ezio Flagello, a
ringer imported from the N.Y.
Met, was the Incredible Hulk both

It remains only to mention the
added fillips which make "Aida" a
really grand bit of pageantry. The
scenery and costumes, borrowed
from the Seattle Opera, were
thoroughly adequate, if
sometimes over-ingenious. The
corps dc ballet performed the
usual pseudo-hieroglyphic sort of
choreography with considerable
verve. And the stage trumpets

were almost perfect. The animals
— tiger, elephant, camel — were
applauded gleefully by the
audience. If I were a singer,
however, 1 would refuse to be on
stage with an animal. They are
even worse than children as
scene-stealers. Poor Bumbry had
to suffer the indignity of
beginning her Act I scene amid
applause for a reluctantly exiting
cheetah.

The new building for the
Community Theatre (I could do
without this affected spelling, by
the way) deserves mention. It
came from the designers of the
Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation
— and it does have Wright's
distinctiveness. It is one of the
new through-designed affairs
where everything from drinking
fountains to waste receptacles is
coordinated. The theme in this
case is the circle. I fould myself
after a time wishing perversely for
something square — a toilet bowl
or anything. No such luck.
The exterior of the facility has
a very pleasing contour, the only
serious lapse in taste, I thought,
being the circular white lights
which ring the roof-line. They
have a breath of tawdriness about
them. Inside, the building's lines
lead the eyes about pleasantly, if
somewhat restlessly. The lobby is
certainly too small and some
bottle-necking will require further
study of the audience's traffic

patterns.
Seating (total for an orchestra
and grand tier is 2700) is
European style, meaning no aisles.
This results in rows of up to 80
seats. And while the seats are
more generously spaced, the
occasions for discourtesy and
interruption in seating are clearly
going to be more than desirable.
Acoustical Qualities
The jury is still out on the
acoustical qualities of the hall.
The sound from my seat a third of
the way from the stage presented
no problems, though there was
some mention of echo from the
area under the over-hang. The
sound perceived by the singers on
stage also remains to be surveyed.
Added to the Flint Center at
Cupertino, the Theatre makes the
Peninsula considerably less
top-heavy in facilities for major
cultural attractions. Any step in
this direction in this age of
fantastic building and production
expenses is encouraging, and San
Jose's citizens should by proud of
their new cultural center.
A final note: the programs for
the opera (which ran out after a
third of the audience was seated)
should never EVER fail to give a
synopsis of the opera nd
biographies of the singers. Perhaps
I underestimate the San Jose
audience, but J conceive there
were some who didn't know what
the hell was going on on stage.
