# 'Whimsical' Ballets
## Slightly Disappointing ABT 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
Last Thursday evening, the
American Ballet Theater which
closed out their San Francisco
Run Sunday night, performed a
slightly disappointeing program of
two whimsical ballets, "Theater"
and "La Fille Mai Gardee."
"Theater," which was recently
choreographed by Eliot Feld,
features Feld as the lead dancer
who takes the audience on a
"journey" into the eccentricities
and follies of theater life. Feld, as
Pierrot, plays the role of an
impartial observor of the scene on
stage. Thus, we, the audience are
drawn inescapably into the action
of the dance.
Every character on stage is
involved in some sort of
dissemblance and disguise. All the
dancers seem to move like
puppets. The most expressive
moment of the dance occured
when a large group of women
dressed in blue rush out on stage,
with their faces covered by masks.
They reach out toward the
audience, as if imploring us to
release them from the burden of
wearning masks.
However, a welcome mood of
frivolity overrides the tragic
undertones of the dance. In fact,
Feld's otherwise bland
choreography proved very
exciting in the dancing of Vane
Vest, who played Brighella, a gaily
dressed scoundrel who performs
an amusing series of mimics of
Pierrot.
Lively Ensemble
The mood of the dance was
further lightened by the
emergence of red and pink balls,
suspended by fine lines from
above, which swung gracefully in
all directions. At this point, Feld's
dancing seemed to reflect the

swaying motion of the balls above
him. At the end of the dance, all
the performers gathered on stage
for a final lively ensemble.
"La Fille Mai Gardee,"
choreographed by Dauberval, was
first presented in France in 1789.
In 1940, it was transmitted to
Ballet Theater by Milhail Mordkin
and Bronislava Nijinsky. ABT has
adhered to the original Russian
choreography and musical
arrangement.
"La Fille Mai Gardee" revolves
around the efforts of two young
lovers, Lise and Colin, to come
together, despite the strong
opposition of Lise's mother,
Madame Simone.
The special attraction of this
dance was the almost ethereal

dancing of Natalie Makarova in
the role of Lise. Her movements
were lithe and quick, yet they
maintained an essential restraint.
Her liveliness was tempered by a
tranquil consistency.
Varied Choreography
The dance was greatly varied in
choregraphic styles. At times, the
villagers" performed a series of
cheerful folk dances. At other
times, Makarova and Ted Kivitt,
as Colin, performed more intense
solos and duets. Kivitt proved his
technical and artistic abilities in a
series of cabrioles, open pirouettes
and double changements.
The choreography allowed for
not only folk and classical
choreography, but aiso for the
frenzied excitement of gypsy

dancing. Lan Horvath, as the gypsy
leader, exuded an appropriate
aura of violence and mystery.
Michael Smuin in the role of a
child carrying a butterfly net,
performed a series of leaps which
brought loud bursts of applause
from the audience.
My basic criticism of the whole
evening is that these dances were
too predominantly "whimsical"
to be performed together in one
evening. The whimsical qualities
of the dances lost their force as
the evening progressed. The
dancers were not at fault. They
were brilliant. However, there was
a potential source for
self-involvement inside me still
left untapped as the final curtain
fell.

dancing. Lan Horvath, as the gypsy
leader, exuded an appropriate
aura of violence and mystery.
Michael Smuin in the role of a
child carrying a butterfly net,
performed a series of leaps which
brought loud bursts of applause
from the audience.
My basic criticism of the whole
evening is that these dances were
too predominantly "whimsical"
to be performed together in one
evening. The whimsical qualities
of the dances lost their force as
the evening progressed. The
dancers were not at fault. They
were brilliant. However, there was
a potential source for
self-involvement inside me still
left untapped as the final curtain
fell.
Last Thursday evening, the
American Ballet Theater which
closed out their San Francisco
Run Sunday night, performed a
slightly disappointeing program of
two whimsical ballets, "Theater"
and "La Fille Mai Gardee."
"Theater," which was recently
choreographed by Eliot Feld,
features Feld as the lead dancer
who takes the audience on a
"journey" into the eccentricities
and follies of theater life. Feld, as
Pierrot, plays the role of an
impartial observor of the scene on
stage. Thus, we, the audience are
drawn inescapably into the action
of the dance.
Every character on stage is
involved in some sort of
dissemblance and disguise. All the
dancers seem to move like
puppets. The most expressive
moment of the dance occured
when a large group of women
dressed in blue rush out on stage,
with their faces covered by masks.
They reach out toward the
audience, as if imploring us to
release them from the burden of
wearning masks.
However, a welcome mood of
frivolity overrides the tragic
undertones of the dance. In fact,
Feld's otherwise bland
choreography proved very
exciting in the dancing of Vane
Vest, who played Brighella, a gaily
dressed scoundrel who performs
an amusing series of mimics of
Pierrot.
Lively Ensemble
The mood of the dance was
further lightened by the
emergence of red and pink balls,
suspended by fine lines from
above, which swung gracefully in
all directions. At this point, Feld's
dancing seemed to reflect the

swaying motion of the balls above
him. At the end of the dance, all
the performers gathered on stage
for a final lively ensemble.
"La Fille Mai Gardee,"
choreographed by Dauberval, was
first presented in France in 1789.
In 1940, it was transmitted to
Ballet Theater by Milhail Mordkin
and Bronislava Nijinsky. ABT has
adhered to the original Russian
choreography and musical
arrangement.
"La Fille Mai Gardee" revolves
around the efforts of two young
lovers, Lise and Colin, to come
together, despite the strong
opposition of Lise's mother,
Madame Simone.
The special attraction of this
dance was the almost ethereal

dancing of Natalie Makarova in
the role of Lise. Her movements
were lithe and quick, yet they
maintained an essential restraint.
Her liveliness was tempered by a
tranquil consistency.
Varied Choreography
The dance was greatly varied in
choregraphic styles. At times, the
villagers" performed a series of
cheerful folk dances. At other
times, Makarova and Ted Kivitt,
as Colin, performed more intense
solos and duets. Kivitt proved his
technical and artistic abilities in a
series of cabrioles, open pirouettes
and double changements.
The choreography allowed for
not only folk and classical
choreography, but aiso for the
frenzied excitement of gypsy

dancing. Lan Horvath, as the gypsy
leader, exuded an appropriate
aura of violence and mystery.
