Harrisburg 7 Trial
HARRIS BURG, Pa. - The Rev.
Joseph Wenderoth was quoted by an
FBI agent at the federal conspiracy
trial of the so-called Harrisburg 7
yesterday as admitting he helped
vandalize three Philadelphia draft
centers.
Father Wenderoth and two other
Roman Catholic priests, including the
Rev. Philip Berrigan, are on trial with
four codefendants on charges of

conspiring to destroy draft records,
blow up heating tunnels in Washington
and kidnap presidential aide Henry A.
Kissinger.
In cross examination, the defense
pursued the theme that the
government tailored a case to fit
accusations voiced by FBI director J.
Edgar Hoover seven weeks before the
indictment of the seven defendants.
Ms. Bill Introduced
SACRAMENTO — California women

could use "Ms." rather than "Miss" or
"Mrs." when applying for jobs under a
bill introduced yesterday by
Assemblyman Bill Greene, D-Los
Angeles.
Greene said he introduced the bill
"on behalf of some women's liberation
people" and that it's aimed at cutting
job discrimination against married
women.
He said it would allow use of Ms.
on job application forms of the State
Department of Human Resources
Development, and would also make
Ms. an acceptable designation on all
other forms and documents printed or
used by the state.

1966.

McGovern Wants #1
SACRAMENTO — Sen. George
McGovern bid yesterday night to win
the No. 1 spot on the Democratic
presidential ballot in California's June
6 primary election.
The South Dakota senator's
campaign set up a series of 500
petition-signing parties "and
happenings of one sort or another" in
an effort to become the first qualified
Democratic candidate.
Supporters of Sen. Edmund Muskie
of Maine, the frontrunner in the public
opinion polls, were doing the same
sort of thing but said they were not in
a contest to win the top spot on the
ballot.
The first candidate to get his
nominating petition filed and verified
is the first candidate listed on the
ballot.
