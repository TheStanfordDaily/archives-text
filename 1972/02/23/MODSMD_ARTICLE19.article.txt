# Pentagon Reverses Navy On Officers' Studies Ban
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Pentagon
said yesterday that officer graduate
students requiring specialized courses
will be able to attend any university,
including Stanford, regardless of
whether the school has dropped
ROTC.
"If it is in the best interest of the
armed services, they will send
individuals to the most appropriate
graduate schools," the Pentagon said
in a brief statement.
Last week, the Navy, yielding to
what it said was pressure from the
House Armed Services Committee,
disclosed that it had put 15 major U.S.
campuses off-limits to new officer
graduate students. The Air Force and

Army took no public stand.
Representative F. Edward Hebert
(D-La.), chairman of the House
committee, threatened to introduce
legislation that would ban the services
from sending their military students to
schools that have closed down ROTC
if the services did not stop the practice
voluntarily.
The House committee, left a
loophole, however, saying in its report
on legislation involving ROTC that the
services could send the students to the
schools if the training was not
available elsewhere.
This ruling apparently does not
apply to most of the military students
here since the general programs they

are in here are also available at other
universities.
The Pentagon reported in
November that the military services
had 164 graduate students and 112
undergraduates in 10 of these
universities. Lauress Wise, associate
dean of the school of engineering,
estimates that about 100 military
students, almost all of them graduate
students, have attended Stanford
annually for the last several years,
making Stanford the main school
affected by the policy.
The Pentagon statement was issued
after a meeting of the Armed Forces
Policy Council, composed of the top
civilian and military officials of the
Department of Defense. Sources said
the announcement was a personal
statement of Defense Secretary Melvin
Laird.
The statement also noted that when
a new bill providing medical
scholarships for the military becomes
law "these scholarships will go to the
students, not to the school, and the
DoD will permit students to use these
scholarships wherever they are
accepted for medical school."
But later, Pentagon spokesman
Jerry W. Friedheim said that was
incorrect. He explained that the bill,
approved by the House and now
pending before the Senate, specifically
prohibits use of medical scholarships
at schools that have phased out ROTC.
This would include the 15 schools
that the Navy said its officers could no
longer take graduate work.
