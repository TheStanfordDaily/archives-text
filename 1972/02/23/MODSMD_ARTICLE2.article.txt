# YWCA Re-evaluating Funding
## Women's Center Dispute Flares 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
The campus YWCA is reconsidering
its support of the Women's Center
because some members believe radicals
are dominating the five-month-old
project.
The governing Board of the
Stanford "Y" has met four times this
month to evaluate its sponsorship of
the student-run center.
The Women's Center organizes
projects, classes, and information for
women from its office in the Old
Union Clubhouse.
"Y" Board members, most of
whom are middle-aged women from
the campus and surrounding
communities, said they were upset by
the radical language of some articles in
the Women's Center newsletter. The
mimeographed newsletter is sent to
about 400 women.
Although more than 200 women
are enrolled this quarter in 18 courses
sponsored by the Center, some Board
members believe the radical Women's
Union has come to dominate the
Center's active leadership.
"Our job at the Y will be to attract
a more balanced group of women to
work at the Center," Board member
Corine Nelson commented. "We don't
want to stifle the girls who are

working there now. We should just try
to bring in additional women with
more moderate points of view."
But YWCA President Ruth Halpern
emphasized that the organization has
not yet decided on any specific
changes.
"We're still trying very hard to
work with the Women's Center,"
Halpern commented. A fifth YWCA
meeting on the issue is scheduled for
tomorrow.
The YWCA is the Center's only
financial sponsor, providing office and
phone facilities and a salary for a
parttime student director of the
program.
Open Organization
In a collective statement issued
Friday, the Center's volunteer workers
said, "We like to think of ourselves as
an open organization. Hence we
welcome criticism from the women we
are trying to serve."
But they insisted, "The Women's
Center is and will continue to be
controlled by the women who work
here."
Individual workers denied that a
majority of the center's active
volunteers belong to the revolutionary
Women's Union.
Cora Lee Mack, the YWCA's

salaried director, said the current
problem is "whether the Center can be
maintained as a completely open place
for women, or whether it will have to
be restrained."
In a written statement, Mack added
her own opinion "that if we begin to
spell out controls for the Women's
Center, we will be putting an end to a
project which has been enthusiastically
accepted by most women and even
some men."
A number of YWCA Board
members said they believe the
problems can still be resolved without
the kind of "controls" rejected by the

Women's Center.
Board member Lois Hogle said the
YWCA could encourage more
moderate students to be active at the
center without interfering with its
operations.
Hogle also said public confusion
about the Center's relations to radicals
could be lessened by a recent
agreement that .articles in the
newsletter will be signed by the groups
or individuals involved.
"If they make strident statements,
if they want to sponsor things the Y
can't sponsor, we ask them to sponsor
them in their names," Hogle said.
Nelson agreed: "All I'm concerned
about is what they're doing with Y
funds and the Y name. The different
groups have to be given the freedom
within the Y center to do whatever
their own things are."
Hogle added, however, that the
Board has also been considering more
active involvement in the Center,
"really to help plan the program."
Project Methods Criticized
Hogle conceded that several
Catholics on the Board may be upset
over Women's Center support for
abortion programs. She said that she
personally supported the substance of
Women's Center projects, including a
questionnaire on job discrimination at
Stanford.
"But the main thing is the
method," Hogle suggested. "It's what
kind of slaps we take at the things we
disagree with."
She said references to
"anti-imperialist groups" and other
radical language used in the newsletter
is "unnecessary. It riles people when
they don't need to."
The YWCA's national guidelines
take strong positions on women's
rights and racism, Hogle pointed out.
"But we're extremely dedicated to the
nonviolent approach to everything."
Halpern said the Women's Center's
radical image has been offending the
YWCA's financial supporters,
including women who were "old
friends of the Y."
Fund Raising Hampered
"It makes it more difficult to raise
funds when we have people feeling we
are nothing else but a group of radical

students," Halpern argued. "This is
always hard for young people to see —
where the funds are coming from."
Hogle revealed that the radical
image has worried the Santa Clara
County United Fund, the YWCA's
prime supporter: "The United Fund is
our lifeline. We're at their mercy. A
couple of them [on the Fund's
Allocations Committee) said they
thought the Women's Center looks like
the Free University."
Despite the current controversy,
Mack said that the YWCA Board
realizes "that the YWCA has found a
very good purpose for being at
Stanford through the Center."
In their statement, the Women's
Center volunteers said the center has
received "positive feedback" from the
newsletter and "wide participation" in
its programs.
The workers said the Center's
purpose is to serve women's needs and
"to offer these women the
opportunity to liberate themselves."
The statement described Women's
Center projects, including a variety of
classes, support for child-care centers,
and questionnaires about women's job
conditions at Stanford.

can't sponsor, we ask them to sponsor
them in their names," Hogle said.
Nelson agreed: "All I'm concerned
about is what they're doing with Y
funds and the Y name. The different
groups have to be given the freedom
within the Y center to do whatever
their own things are."
Hogle added, however, that the
Board has also been considering more
active involvement in the Center,
"really to help plan the program."
Project Methods Criticized
Hogle conceded that several
Catholics on the Board may be upset
over Women's Center support for
abortion programs. She said that she
personally supported the substance of
Women's Center projects, including a
questionnaire on job discrimination at
Stanford.
"But the main thing is the
method," Hogle suggested. "It's what
kind of slaps we take at the things we
disagree with."
She said references to
"anti-imperialist groups" and other
radical language used in the newsletter
is "unnecessary. It riles people when
they don't need to."
The YWCA's national guidelines
take strong positions on women's
rights and racism, Hogle pointed out.
"But we're extremely dedicated to the
nonviolent approach to everything."
Halpern said the Women's Center's
radical image has been offending the
YWCA's financial supporters,
including women who were "old
friends of the Y."
Fund Raising Hampered
"It makes it more difficult to raise
funds when we have people feeling we
are nothing else but a group of radical

students," Halpern argued. "This is
always hard for young people to see —
where the funds are coming from."
Hogle revealed that the radical
image has worried the Santa Clara
County United Fund, the YWCA's
prime supporter: "The United Fund is
our lifeline. We're at their mercy. A
couple of them [on the Fund's
Allocations Committee) said they
thought the Women's Center looks like
the Free University."
Despite the current controversy,
Mack said that the YWCA Board
realizes "that the YWCA has found a
very good purpose for being at
Stanford through the Center."
In their statement, the Women's
Center volunteers said the center has
received "positive feedback" from the
newsletter and "wide participation" in
its programs.
The workers said the Center's
purpose is to serve women's needs and
"to offer these women the
opportunity to liberate themselves."
The statement described Women's
Center projects, including a variety of
classes, support for child-care centers,
and questionnaires about women's job
conditions at Stanford.
The campus YWCA is reconsidering
its support of the Women's Center
because some members believe radicals
are dominating the five-month-old
project.
The governing Board of the
Stanford "Y" has met four times this
month to evaluate its sponsorship of
the student-run center.
The Women's Center organizes
projects, classes, and information for
women from its office in the Old
Union Clubhouse.
"Y" Board members, most of
whom are middle-aged women from
the campus and surrounding
communities, said they were upset by
the radical language of some articles in
the Women's Center newsletter. The
mimeographed newsletter is sent to
about 400 women.
Although more than 200 women
are enrolled this quarter in 18 courses
sponsored by the Center, some Board
members believe the radical Women's
Union has come to dominate the
Center's active leadership.
"Our job at the Y will be to attract
a more balanced group of women to
work at the Center," Board member
Corine Nelson commented. "We don't
want to stifle the girls who are

working there now. We should just try
to bring in additional women with
more moderate points of view."
But YWCA President Ruth Halpern
emphasized that the organization has
not yet decided on any specific
changes.
"We're still trying very hard to
work with the Women's Center,"
Halpern commented. A fifth YWCA
meeting on the issue is scheduled for
tomorrow.
The YWCA is the Center's only
financial sponsor, providing office and
phone facilities and a salary for a
parttime student director of the
program.
Open Organization
In a collective statement issued
Friday, the Center's volunteer workers
said, "We like to think of ourselves as
an open organization. Hence we
welcome criticism from the women we
are trying to serve."
But they insisted, "The Women's
Center is and will continue to be
controlled by the women who work
here."
Individual workers denied that a
majority of the center's active
volunteers belong to the revolutionary
Women's Union.
Cora Lee Mack, the YWCA's

salaried director, said the current
problem is "whether the Center can be
maintained as a completely open place
for women, or whether it will have to
be restrained."
In a written statement, Mack added
her own opinion "that if we begin to
spell out controls for the Women's
Center, we will be putting an end to a
project which has been enthusiastically
accepted by most women and even
some men."
A number of YWCA Board
members said they believe the
problems can still be resolved without
the kind of "controls" rejected by the

Women's Center.
Board member Lois Hogle said the
YWCA could encourage more
moderate students to be active at the
center without interfering with its
operations.
Hogle also said public confusion
about the Center's relations to radicals
could be lessened by a recent
agreement that .articles in the
newsletter will be signed by the groups
or individuals involved.
"If they make strident statements,
if they want to sponsor things the Y
can't sponsor, we ask them to sponsor
them in their names," Hogle said.

the radical language of some articles in
the Women's Center newsletter. The
mimeographed newsletter is sent to
about 400 women.
Although more than 200 women
are enrolled this quarter in 18 courses
sponsored by the Center, some Board
members believe the radical Women's
Union has come to dominate the
Center's active leadership.
"Our job at the Y will be to attract
a more balanced group of women to
work at the Center," Board member
Corine Nelson commented. "We don't
want to stifle the girls who are

working there now. We should just try
to bring in additional women with
more moderate points of view."
But YWCA President Ruth Halpern
emphasized that the organization has
not yet decided on any specific
changes.
"We're still trying very hard to
work with the Women's Center,"
Halpern commented. A fifth YWCA
meeting on the issue is scheduled for
tomorrow.
The YWCA is the Center's only
financial sponsor, providing office and
phone facilities and a salary for a
parttime student director of the
program.
Open Organization
In a collective statement issued
Friday, the Center's volunteer workers
said, "We like to think of ourselves as
an open organization. Hence we
welcome criticism from the women we
are trying to serve."
But they insisted, "The Women's
Center is and will continue to be
controlled by the women who work
here."
Individual workers denied that a
majority of the center's active
volunteers belong to the revolutionary
Women's Union.
Cora Lee Mack, the YWCA's

salaried director, said the current
problem is "whether the Center can be
maintained as a completely open place
for women, or whether it will have to
be restrained."
In a written statement, Mack added
her own opinion "that if we begin to
spell out controls for the Women's
Center, we will be putting an end to a
project which has been enthusiastically
accepted by most women and even
some men."
A number of YWCA Board
members said they believe the
problems can still be resolved without
the kind of "controls" rejected by the

Women's Center.
Board member Lois Hogle said the
YWCA could encourage more
moderate students to be active at the
center without interfering with its
operations.
Hogle also said public confusion
about the Center's relations to radicals
could be lessened by a recent
agreement that .articles in the
newsletter will be signed by the groups
or individuals involved.
"If they make strident statements,
if they want to sponsor things the Y
can't sponsor, we ask them to sponsor
them in their names," Hogle said.
Nelson agreed: "All I'm concerned
about is what they're doing with Y
funds and the Y name. The different
groups have to be given the freedom
within the Y center to do whatever
their own things are."
Hogle added, however, that the
Board has also been considering more
active involvement in the Center,
"really to help plan the program."
Project Methods Criticized
Hogle conceded that several
Catholics on the Board may be upset
over Women's Center support for
abortion programs. She said that she
personally supported the substance of
Women's Center projects, including a
questionnaire on job discrimination at
Stanford.
"But the main thing is the
method," Hogle suggested. "It's what
kind of slaps we take at the things we
disagree with."
She said references to
"anti-imperialist groups" and other
radical language used in the newsletter
is "unnecessary. It riles people when
they don't need to."
The YWCA's national guidelines
take strong positions on women's
rights and racism, Hogle pointed out.
"But we're extremely dedicated to the
nonviolent approach to everything."
Halpern said the Women's Center's
radical image has been offending the
YWCA's financial supporters,
including women who were "old
friends of the Y."
Fund Raising Hampered
"It makes it more difficult to raise
funds when we have people feeling we
are nothing else but a group of radical

students," Halpern argued. "This is
always hard for young people to see —
where the funds are coming from."
Hogle revealed that the radical
image has worried the Santa Clara
County United Fund, the YWCA's
prime supporter: "The United Fund is
our lifeline. We're at their mercy. A
couple of them [on the Fund's
Allocations Committee) said they
thought the Women's Center looks like
the Free University."
Despite the current controversy,
Mack said that the YWCA Board
realizes "that the YWCA has found a
very good purpose for being at
Stanford through the Center."
In their statement, the Women's
Center volunteers said the center has
received "positive feedback" from the
newsletter and "wide participation" in
its programs.
The workers said the Center's
purpose is to serve women's needs and
"to offer these women the
opportunity to liberate themselves."
The statement described Women's
Center projects, including a variety of
classes, support for child-care centers,
and questionnaires about women's job
conditions at Stanford.
The campus YWCA is reconsidering
its support of the Women's Center
because some members believe radicals
are dominating the five-month-old
project.
The governing Board of the
Stanford "Y" has met four times this
month to evaluate its sponsorship of
the student-run center.
The Women's Center organizes
projects, classes, and information for
women from its office in the Old
Union Clubhouse.
"Y" Board members, most of
whom are middle-aged women from
the campus and surrounding
communities, said they were upset by
the radical language of some articles in
the Women's Center newsletter. The
mimeographed newsletter is sent to
about 400 women.
Although more than 200 women
are enrolled this quarter in 18 courses
