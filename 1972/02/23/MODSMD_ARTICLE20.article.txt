### 
Four recommendations for changes
in research policy were the center of
debate at yesterday's required annual
open meeting of the Academic Senate
Committee on Research.
Proposed by Carol Farlow,
co-author of the SWOPSI report on
DoD sponsored research at Stanford,
the first of the recommendations is a
Senate Committee policy statement
encouraging faculty members to
engage in research in areas of personal
interest.
The statement says that no stigma
is placed on a professor in terms of
promotion if he or she does not engage
in research, prefering to teach a full

load.
The elimination of salary off-sets
and a set limitation on the amount of
sponsorship per department from a
specific source were offered as
methods to reduce the number of
mission-oriented research contracts.
The final proposal dealt with
sponsoring graduate research with
funds obtained through a tax on
externally sponsored contracts.
Professor of computer sciences
John McCarthy was most vocal in his
dissatisfaction with the SWOPSI
proposals, though most faculty
members likewise expressed
disagreement with the ideas.
