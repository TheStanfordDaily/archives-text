# Ho Denies Charges During CJP Hearing
## 
### 
As the final defense witness in his
Campus Judicial Panel hearing,
defendant Kwonping Ho testified
yesterday that he never entered the
Faculty Club kitchen, did not have
food at any time while in the Club,
and did not say anything about going
into the kitchen.
Yesterday's testimony concluded
the hearing in which Ho is accused of
assaulting Faculty Club Executive
Chef Arturo Lionetti and entering the
kitchen "for the purpose of stealing
food" in violation of the Fundamental
Standard.
Ho said he entered the main dining
room and saw the double doors
between the dining room and the
hallway which runs past the kitchen.
He felt the doors led to the back door,
which he wanted to open for security
reasons.

Ho testified that as he advanced
toward the double doors, which were
open at that time, Lionetti appeared
and said, "You can't go through here!
There's nothing for you back here!"
Ho claimed that Lionetti then
moved back and started closing the
doors, while Ho moved up and began
pushing on the left door. Ho
remembers himself gesturing to other
people in the dining room and saying
"Come on over! Hurry up!"
Ho said he did not remember
anyone mentioning the kitchen or
food, and stated that he did not know
the hallway went past the kitchen at
all. Ho contended that he saw no one
enter the kitchen at any time.
Regarding the assault charge, Ho
stated, "I did not take any
independent physical action of my
own to come in contact with Mr.
Lionetti," although he conceded they
might have touched accidentally at
some point.
In other defense testimony
yesterday, junior Jeff Wright, a former
Faculty Club worker, said he had
talked with Lionetti on February 9
and testified that Lionetti had
shrugged off the entire incident,
denied that he had been assaulted, and
had passed off the whole affair as "no
problem."
The prosecution presented one
rebuttal witness, Gynecology and
Obstetrics Professor Emmett Lamb,
who had been at the Faculty Club as a
faculty observer.
Although he placed himself in the
same position in the kitchen as Law
Professor Jack Friedenthal, who
testified Friday that he saw Ho in the
kitchen, Lamb could not identify Ho
in the hearing room.
Both prosecution and defense make
their final summation tonight at 8:00
p.m. in Room 83 of the Graduate
School of Business.
