# 'On DoD' Rally Attracts 50 People, Few Speakers
## 
### 
A rally held to voice support for
the Department of Defense and open
recruiting at the Placement Center
attracted 50 people to White Plaza
yesterday afternoon.
The event's moderator set the tone
of the rally by urging people to "fight
for freedom rather than surrender to
peace," since it is "impossible to have
both freedom and peace
simultaneously."
Business grad student Noel Casey,
the next speaker at the rally, referred
to the effort of the United States to
maintain military superiority, claiming
"the university defense research
activities are essential to that effort."
Chris Hocker, chairman of the Free
Campus Movement (FCM), said that
"individuals have the right to decide

for themselves how they will be
employed... I don't see how a
worker making a light bulb for General
Electric is a war criminal."
Hocker concluded with the
exclamation, "Stanford University,
love it or leave it!"
Business student Vic Jaffe spoke
next, denouncing campus radicals for
"fascistic bullying" that "prevents
recruiters from coming on campus."
He called on the radicals to "guarantee
us the right to work for the
Department of Defense."
The final speaker at the rally,
former Congressman Bob Barry
(R-N.Y.), decried the growing missile
gap between the United States and the
U.S.S.R. He said that "the foremost
tool of foreign policy is power."
