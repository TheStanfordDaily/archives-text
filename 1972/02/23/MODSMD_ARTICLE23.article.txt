# Success Claimed As Fast Ends

### JON GRAY 
The remaining seven fasters who made three demands
on President Richard Lyman two weeks ago broke bread
together last night at a SWOPSI-sponsored symposium on
imperialism in Cubberly Auditorium.
The demands which Lyman firmly refused were for an
open meeting with President Lyman and moratoria on
recruiting by the military or companies holding more than
$100 million in defense contracts at the Placement Center
and on CJP hearings.
At a jubilant meeting in Columbae after the
symposium the ex-fasters announced they would be
present at the Placement Center Thursday morning to
protest the presence of Martin-Marietta Corporation —
second largest producer of anti-personnel weapons, the
protesters claim. They plan an 8:00 breakfast outside the
Center before the recruiters arrive.
"Was it worth it?" one reporter asked the fasters at a

press conference earlier yesterday on White Plaza.
"Yes," was the response. They pointed triumphantly
to petitions circulated around campus plus approximately
200 letters sent to Lyman supporting their demands.
A group of clergy from the Palo Alto area met with
Lyman yesterday to discuss the demands.
"We choose a fast because it is credible," read their
statement in part. "It makes clear that our motive is not
self-interest; it makes clear that we are very serious about
our goals." Lyman admitted he was moved by their
sincerity, because "what they were doing differed so
much from Venceremos and other radical groups."
But he refused to accede to the demands,stating that in
so doing he would betray hi& principles.
"He's shown how hlard-lined he is," said Dave
Josephson, toward what he termed "reasonable
demands." "I don't think anyone imagined it would take
this long," he continued.
