# Need For Continuing Reform Stressed Following SES Changes
## 
### BOB MICHELET (Last of three parts 
The sudden and widespread changes
brought about by The Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) raise
questions about the need for more
continuous mechanisms of educational
reform and innovation.
In the years 1954-56, the large-scale
Study of Undergraduate Education at
Stanford resulted in a book—The
Undergraduate in the University,
co-authored by Political Science
Professor Hubert Marshall—and a
number of changes in the structure of
educational programs.
One of the largest "improvements"
that came from this study was the
General Studies Program, a system of
courses and area requirements for
undergraduates. Within a decade,
however, SES found this system
totally unsatisfactory, and
recommended systems of its own. And
even now, SES-proposed programs are
being rethought.
Such a situation indicates the
potential fa' ts of large-scale studies

which can be taken up only at long
intervals, and points up the need for
means of ongoing reform.
Spirit Of Self-Examination
In its opening report, SES said its
"first and most important
recommendation" was that "the
University should seek to sustain a
spirit of self-examination and
self-renewal, which can be supported
by a variety of institutional devices."
One of the devices recommended
was an Academic Planning Office,
which would "assist faculty, student,
and administration efforts to obtain
the data upon which rational planning
must depend."
That goal was realized when an
Academic Planning Office (APO)
opened last year. Sally Main, an
Assistant to the Provost and a Staff
Associate of the APO, notes the Office
tries "to eliminate the need for such
convulsive efforts every ten years" as
SES.
Though the APO spends much of
its time examining current programs,
the orientation of its work is definitely

toward the future.
The APO exists, Main says, "so that
new programs don't go unexamined"
for a long time, but she notes that its
main thrust is "to help people identify
and collect the information they need
to make sensible decisions."
The APO is not the only "device"
concerned with future needs. The
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US) and the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid, both created out of SES
recommendations, have now passed
from the stage of SES implementation
into consideration of other problems.
C-US Studies Requirements
C-US chairman Edwin Good notes
the committee is reconsidering the
form — and even the need — for course
and area requirements. Though SES
reduced undergraduate requirements
considerably, Good notes there "are
some problems. . . with the way it is
stated," and that SES proposals
"virtually recommended, if not
required, miscellany."
The committee will soon discuss
more definite guidelines for granting
credit in programs such as SWOPSI
and SCIRE than have existed
previously.
Good says"I don't think we're
done with massive studies," adding
"sometimes reform is needed more
than at other times." He feels, though,
that "reform will tend to take place a
step at a time."
Professor Arthur Bienenstock,
chairman of the admissions and
financial aid committee, says that
mechanisms for ongoing reform are
"functioning at the moment," and
notes "one has comments from the
outside that are taken seriously" in
committee considerations.
He says the committee last
considered SES proposals in late 1970,
and has concerned itself since with
problems of enrollment of minority
and women students.
The Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies (O-DUS) is
another place where interest in future
innovation parallels a monitoring of
current programs.
Gibbs Eyes Future
Undergraduate Studies Dean James
Gibbs notes "the constant renewal of
the curriculum urged by SES seems to
be present," and, looking to the
future, says"I would like to see an
expansion of non-curricular academic
services for undergraduates to fill
significant gaps."
He cites two proposals that are now
receiving "finishing touches." One is
for "a modest but effective tutoring
program" with close ties to the
advising program and to departmental
instruction.
A second service is a Writing
Center, originally an SES idea, which
"would provide individual tutorial
sessions and also experiment with
small writing courses," according to
Gibbs. He adds that a plan for a

three-year bachelor's degree is being
considered, but notes that at present,
"a three-year degree is not appropriate
for all students."
But beyond the work on specific
programs, many see a need for a
"spirit" of reform, similar to the
enthusiasm that greeted the SES
reports when they first appeared.
"We hope," SES stated, "that from
our work will come a renewal of the
idealism and aspiration on which
universities are founded."
SES Viewed Favorably
Opinion on the value of SES seems
consistently favorable. Good calls it
"epochal," and "terribly influential in
the best possible way." Main called the
study "a catalyst" to reform and said
"the speed of implementation testifies
to the receptiveness of the University
community to the direction [SES]
headed us."
Law Professor Herbert Packer,
chairman of the three-year study, says
the implementation of SES
recommendations has left the
University in "much better shape now
to keep up the good work."
And though generous with priase
for the immediate benefits from SES,
most would no doubt agree with the
study's observation that "the study of
education at Stanford must become a
process rather than merely an event."

our work will come a renewal of the
idealism and aspiration on which
universities are founded."
SES Viewed Favorably
Opinion on the value of SES seems
consistently favorable. Good calls it
"epochal," and "terribly influential in
the best possible way." Main called the
study "a catalyst" to reform and said
"the speed of implementation testifies
to the receptiveness of the University
community to the direction [SES]
headed us."
Law Professor Herbert Packer,
chairman of the three-year study, says
the implementation of SES
recommendations has left the
University in "much better shape now
to keep up the good work."
And though generous with priase
for the immediate benefits from SES,
most would no doubt agree with the
study's observation that "the study of
education at Stanford must become a
process rather than merely an event."
The sudden and widespread changes
brought about by The Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) raise
questions about the need for more
continuous mechanisms of educational
reform and innovation.
In the years 1954-56, the large-scale
Study of Undergraduate Education at
Stanford resulted in a book—The
Undergraduate in the University,
co-authored by Political Science
Professor Hubert Marshall—and a
number of changes in the structure of
educational programs.
One of the largest "improvements"
that came from this study was the
General Studies Program, a system of
courses and area requirements for
undergraduates. Within a decade,
however, SES found this system
totally unsatisfactory, and
recommended systems of its own. And
even now, SES-proposed programs are
being rethought.
Such a situation indicates the
potential fa' ts of large-scale studies

which can be taken up only at long
intervals, and points up the need for
means of ongoing reform.
Spirit Of Self-Examination
In its opening report, SES said its
"first and most important
recommendation" was that "the
University should seek to sustain a
spirit of self-examination and
self-renewal, which can be supported
by a variety of institutional devices."
One of the devices recommended
was an Academic Planning Office,
which would "assist faculty, student,
and administration efforts to obtain
the data upon which rational planning
must depend."
That goal was realized when an
Academic Planning Office (APO)
opened last year. Sally Main, an
Assistant to the Provost and a Staff
Associate of the APO, notes the Office
tries "to eliminate the need for such
convulsive efforts every ten years" as
SES.
Though the APO spends much of
its time examining current programs,
the orientation of its work is definitely

toward the future.
The APO exists, Main says, "so that
new programs don't go unexamined"
for a long time, but she notes that its
main thrust is "to help people identify
and collect the information they need
to make sensible decisions."
The APO is not the only "device"
concerned with future needs. The
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US) and the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid, both created out of SES
recommendations, have now passed
from the stage of SES implementation
into consideration of other problems.
C-US Studies Requirements
C-US chairman Edwin Good notes
the committee is reconsidering the
form — and even the need — for course
and area requirements. Though SES
reduced undergraduate requirements
considerably, Good notes there "are
some problems. . . with the way it is
stated," and that SES proposals
"virtually recommended, if not
required, miscellany."
The committee will soon discuss
more definite guidelines for granting
credit in programs such as SWOPSI
and SCIRE than have existed
previously.
Good says"I don't think we're
done with massive studies," adding
"sometimes reform is needed more
than at other times." He feels, though,
that "reform will tend to take place a
step at a time."
Professor Arthur Bienenstock,
chairman of the admissions and
financial aid committee, says that
mechanisms for ongoing reform are
"functioning at the moment," and
notes "one has comments from the
outside that are taken seriously" in
committee considerations.
He says the committee last
considered SES proposals in late 1970,
and has concerned itself since with
problems of enrollment of minority
and women students.
The Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies (O-DUS) is
another place where interest in future
innovation parallels a monitoring of
current programs.
Gibbs Eyes Future
Undergraduate Studies Dean James
Gibbs notes "the constant renewal of
the curriculum urged by SES seems to
be present," and, looking to the
future, says"I would like to see an
expansion of non-curricular academic
services for undergraduates to fill
significant gaps."
He cites two proposals that are now
receiving "finishing touches." One is
for "a modest but effective tutoring
program" with close ties to the
advising program and to departmental
instruction.
A second service is a Writing
Center, originally an SES idea, which
"would provide individual tutorial
sessions and also experiment with
small writing courses," according to
Gibbs. He adds that a plan for a

three-year bachelor's degree is being
considered, but notes that at present,
"a three-year degree is not appropriate
for all students."
But beyond the work on specific
programs, many see a need for a
"spirit" of reform, similar to the
enthusiasm that greeted the SES
reports when they first appeared.

our work will come a renewal of the

services for undergraduates to fill
significant gaps."
He cites two proposals that are now
receiving "finishing touches." One is
for "a modest but effective tutoring
program" with close ties to the
advising program and to departmental
instruction.
A second service is a Writing
Center, originally an SES idea, which
"would provide individual tutorial
sessions and also experiment with
small writing courses," according to
Gibbs. He adds that a plan for a

three-year bachelor's degree is being
considered, but notes that at present,
"a three-year degree is not appropriate
for all students."
But beyond the work on specific
programs, many see a need for a
"spirit" of reform, similar to the
enthusiasm that greeted the SES
reports when they first appeared.
"We hope," SES stated, "that from
our work will come a renewal of the
idealism and aspiration on which
universities are founded."
SES Viewed Favorably
Opinion on the value of SES seems
consistently favorable. Good calls it
"epochal," and "terribly influential in
the best possible way." Main called the
study "a catalyst" to reform and said
"the speed of implementation testifies
to the receptiveness of the University
community to the direction [SES]
headed us."
Law Professor Herbert Packer,
chairman of the three-year study, says
the implementation of SES
recommendations has left the
University in "much better shape now
to keep up the good work."
And though generous with priase
for the immediate benefits from SES,
most would no doubt agree with the
study's observation that "the study of
education at Stanford must become a
process rather than merely an event."
The sudden and widespread changes
brought about by The Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) raise
questions about the need for more
continuous mechanisms of educational
reform and innovation.
In the years 1954-56, the large-scale
Study of Undergraduate Education at
Stanford resulted in a book—The
Undergraduate in the University,
co-authored by Political Science
Professor Hubert Marshall—and a
number of changes in the structure of
educational programs.
One of the largest "improvements"
that came from this study was the
General Studies Program, a system of
courses and area requirements for
undergraduates. Within a decade,
however, SES found this system
totally unsatisfactory, and
recommended systems of its own. And
even now, SES-proposed programs are
being rethought.
Such a situation indicates the
potential fa' ts of large-scale studies

which can be taken up only at long
intervals, and points up the need for
means of ongoing reform.
Spirit Of Self-Examination
In its opening report, SES said its
"first and most important
recommendation" was that "the
University should seek to sustain a
spirit of self-examination and
self-renewal, which can be supported
by a variety of institutional devices."
One of the devices recommended
was an Academic Planning Office,
which would "assist faculty, student,
and administration efforts to obtain
the data upon which rational planning
must depend."
That goal was realized when an
Academic Planning Office (APO)
opened last year. Sally Main, an
Assistant to the Provost and a Staff
Associate of the APO, notes the Office
tries "to eliminate the need for such
convulsive efforts every ten years" as
SES.
Though the APO spends much of
its time examining current programs,
the orientation of its work is definitely

toward the future.
The APO exists, Main says, "so that
new programs don't go unexamined"
for a long time, but she notes that its
main thrust is "to help people identify
and collect the information they need
to make sensible decisions."
The APO is not the only "device"
concerned with future needs. The
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US) and the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid, both created out of SES
recommendations, have now passed
from the stage of SES implementation
into consideration of other problems.
C-US Studies Requirements
C-US chairman Edwin Good notes
the committee is reconsidering the
form — and even the need — for course
and area requirements. Though SES
reduced undergraduate requirements
considerably, Good notes there "are
some problems. . . with the way it is
stated," and that SES proposals
"virtually recommended, if not
required, miscellany."
The committee will soon discuss
more definite guidelines for granting
credit in programs such as SWOPSI
and SCIRE than have existed
previously.
Good says"I don't think we're
done with massive studies," adding
"sometimes reform is needed more
than at other times." He feels, though,
that "reform will tend to take place a
step at a time."
Professor Arthur Bienenstock,
chairman of the admissions and
financial aid committee, says that
mechanisms for ongoing reform are
"functioning at the moment," and
notes "one has comments from the
outside that are taken seriously" in
committee considerations.
He says the committee last
considered SES proposals in late 1970,
and has concerned itself since with
problems of enrollment of minority
and women students.
The Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies (O-DUS) is
another place where interest in future
innovation parallels a monitoring of
current programs.
Gibbs Eyes Future
Undergraduate Studies Dean James
Gibbs notes "the constant renewal of
the curriculum urged by SES seems to
be present," and, looking to the
future, says"I would like to see an
expansion of non-curricular academic
services for undergraduates to fill
significant gaps."
He cites two proposals that are now
receiving "finishing touches." One is
for "a modest but effective tutoring
program" with close ties to the
