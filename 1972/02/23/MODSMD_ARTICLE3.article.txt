# Need For Continuing Reform Stressed Following SES Changes
## 
### BOB MICHELET (Last of three parts 
The sudden and widespread changes
brought about by The Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) raise
questions about the need for more
continuous mechanisms of educational
reform and innovation.
In the years 1954-56, the large-scale
Study of Undergraduate Education at
Stanford resulted in a book—The
Undergraduate in the University,
co-authored by Political Science
Professor Hubert Marshall—and a
number of changes in the structure of
educational programs.
One of the largest "improvements"
that came from this study was the
General Studies Program, a system of
courses and area requirements for
undergraduates. Within a decade,
however, SES found this system
totally unsatisfactory, and
recommended systems of its own. And
even now, SES-proposed programs are
being rethought.
Such a situation indicates the
potential fa' ts of large-scale studies

which can be taken up only at long
intervals, and points up the need for
means of ongoing reform.
Spirit Of Self-Examination
In its opening report, SES said its
"first and most important
recommendation" was that "the
University should seek to sustain a
spirit of self-examination and
self-renewal, which can be supported
by a variety of institutional devices."
One of the devices recommended
was an Academic Planning Office,
which would "assist faculty, student,
and administration efforts to obtain
the data upon which rational planning
must depend."
That goal was realized when an
Academic Planning Office (APO)
opened last year. Sally Main, an
Assistant to the Provost and a Staff
Associate of the APO, notes the Office
tries "to eliminate the need for such
convulsive efforts every ten years" as
SES.
Though the APO spends much of
its time examining current programs,
the orientation of its work is definitely

toward the future.
The APO exists, Main says, "so that
new programs don't go unexamined"
for a long time, but she notes that its
main thrust is "to help people identify
and collect the information they need
to make sensible decisions."
The APO is not the only "device"
concerned with future needs. The
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US) and the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid, both created out of SES
recommendations, have now passed
from the stage of SES implementation
into consideration of other problems.
C-US Studies Requirements
C-US chairman Edwin Good notes
the committee is reconsidering the
form — and even the need — for course
and area requirements. Though SES
reduced undergraduate requirements
considerably, Good notes there "are
some problems. . . with the way it is
stated," and that SES proposals
"virtually recommended, if not
required, miscellany."
The committee will soon discuss
more definite guidelines for granting
credit in programs such as SWOPSI
and SCIRE than have existed
previously.
Good says"I don't think we're
done with massive studies," adding
"sometimes reform is needed more
than at other times." He feels, though,
that "reform will tend to take place a
step at a time."
Professor Arthur Bienenstock,
chairman of the admissions and
financial aid committee, says that
mechanisms for ongoing reform are
