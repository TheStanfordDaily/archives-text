# U.S. Domination Assailed By Sweezy
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
"United States hegemony" over the
world "began to crumble in 1965 and
collapsed on August 15, 1971" with
the fall of the Bretton Woods
(gold-dollar exchange) Monetary
System.
These were the words of Paul
Sweezy as he spoke to an overflow
crowd in Cubberly Auditorium last
night. Sweezy, a close associate of the
late Paul Baran, led off the

SWOPSI-sponsored Symposium on
Imperialism.
Sweezy offered his analysis of
recent forms of imperialism and their
manifestations. He said that he
believed that "if it had not been for
the Vietnam War, United States
hegemony might have lasted quite
some time." Sweezy pointed out that
the imbalance of trade which caused
the Bretton Wood Monetary System to
collapse started because of the war.
"The period of U.S. hegemony
began at the end of World War II,"
Sweezy said, and was characterized by
peace among the "metropolitan
imperialist powers." He explained that
"a visible change in the nature of war"
occurred during the period, during
which wars of national liberation were
fought in "the periphery" (the Third
World).
Contradiction Cited
Sweezy said that the greatest
"contradiction" of imperialism is
occurring between the "metropolitan
powers" and"the periphery." He
stated that this contradiction "may
explode into a world-shaking crisis at
any moment."
Sweezy also explained a new and
great "contradiction" between
imperialism and "sub-imperialism."
Sweezy said this contradiction was
rooted in U.S. hegemony and the
Vietnam War.
He said that since the Vietnam War
had "undermined the strength of the
U.S. as an imperialist power, the U.S.
is in no position to intervene [in the
Third World] although it becomes
more and more necessary."
Therefore, Sweezy said, the United
States has built up a number of
"sub-imperialist" powers, including
Brazil, Iran, India and South Africa, to
"play loyal watchdog for U.S.
interests."
Sweezy explained, however, that
"non-correspondence between the
nationality of capital (the United
States) and the nationality of effective
state power" (the "sub-imperialists")
would lead to gravitation of capital to
the nationality with the power. On
this basis, Sweezy said, the hegemony
of the United States had been
destroyed.
Sweezy said that "the new stage of
imperialism entered into this year"
with the fall of Bretton Woods "may
be the last, and the urgency of making
it as short as possible is growing every
day." But he pointed out that the U.S.
ruling class is "very powerful, very

experienced and very rich" and that its
influence on prolonging the stage
should not be discounted.
Sweezy stated that President Nixon
had been "forced out" of Vietnam
even though "it is clear that the U.S. is
losing the war." He said it had become
apparent that American air power in
Vietnam "can devastate and destroy
but cannot occupy and control."
Sweezy discounted the theory that
there are "two great social systems,"
insisting instead there are three:
capitalism, socialism and "socialism in
the Soviet block." He said "social
imperialism is appropriately
descriptive" for the Soviet block
because of their foreign policy in
Czechoslovakia and the Middle East.
In response to audience questions,
Sweezy said "racism is basically a
creation of imperialism beginning with
the European conquest" of the areas
populated primarily by "colored"
races. He added "racism has naturally

played its role in justifying
exploitation of the rest of the world."
Sweezy said "the universities in this
country are essential aspects of the
power structure in terms of training
and provision of highly skilled
manpower and provision of research."
He suggested that those who agree
with him ''use the university for our
purposes as well as for their purposes."
The Symposium continues today
with a play and two panel discussions.
At noon in White Plaza the Political
Theater Group will perform the play
"Discourse ... on Vietnam." A panel
discussion on imperialism in Latin
America which is to include Education
Professor Martin Carnoy as moderator
will begin at 3:15 p.m. in the
Cummings Art Building auditorium.
Beginning at 7:30 p.m. a panel
discussion on "China, Japan and the
U.S.: Asia in the '70's" will be held in
Cubberly Auditorium. Participants will
include professors John Gurley and
Lyman Van Slyke.
