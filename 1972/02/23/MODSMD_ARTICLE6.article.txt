By title, "An American Final
Solution," and by text, the
Saturday Thoughts for October
15, 1971, characterized me as a
disciple of Hitler: his "Final
Solution" was Dachau. But I
believe that the column's tone
itself typifies the emotional lack
of intellectual objectivity and
integrity that made the evils of
Nazi Germany possible. This
belief is based on the analysis
resulting from the soul searching
that I have undergone in reaction
to criticisms, like those I respond
to here, that have resulted from
my publicly stated views that our
intellectuals are irresponsibly
failing to diagnose the role of
hereditary factors in human
behavioral problems. My
provocation to thought—a
"thinking exercise"—presented in
the form of a voluntary
sterilization bonus plan did indeed
so rattle the Saturday Thinker
that he has left ajar the doors of
these columns so that I shall try
to blow a breath of fresh thoughts
into a currently nearly sealed-off
area where stagnant dogmatism
festers and threatens humanity's
future.
I came gradually — it took
several years — to the moral

postulates that lead to my harsh
appraisals of our nation's
intellectual climate, exemplified
by the Saturday Thoughts. To
start with, I simply operated on
the instinctive basis that truth was
per se a good thing and should be
sought no matter what. This
position brought me promptly
into conflict with what should be
but is not our nation's scientific
conscience — the National
Academy of Sciences. My position
on the Academy's unwillingness
to state a quantitative position on
genes and intelligence or even to
encourage related research was
expressed in the Congressional
Record: "1 regard the Academy's
position as being the most serious
and obvious dereliction of
intellectual responsibility in the
history of science." My reactions
are similar toward the Saturday
Thoughts.
Truth, Concern, Death: These
are the labels for my three slowly
formulated, moral postulates.
They leave no choice but to
continue to demand diagnosis of
genetic factors in our nation's
growing human quality problems.
I believe that these principles are
most intimately interwoven with
the best to be found in humanity.
I believe that they are so
elemental that they apply with
equal force for a devout Christian
and for an atheist. »
A coincidence at my alma
mater, the California Institute of
Technology, brought the truth
postulate into focus for me and
led to my analysis of it. In late
October of 1966 I was one of the
first group to receive the Alumni
Distinguished Service Award. One
week earlier, at a meeting of the
National Academy of Sciences, I
had presented my first appeal for
research on the possibility of
dysgenics, the threat that the
voluntary sterilization bonus plan
is intended to answer. Another
award recipient, also an Academy
member, warned me not to
mention race in future research
proposals. I said that making
research subservient to popular
opinion was revolting to me.
Later, in the light of our
argument, I contemplated the
motto on the award medal: "The
truth shall make you free."
My contemplation led as an
article of faith to what I call the
truth postulate: "The truth shall
make you free " signifies that man
has the obligation to use his brain
for the welfare of humanity. He
cannot in good conscience avoid
the unnerving questions inherent
in my voluntary sterilization
bonus plan. If one believes that

man's brain was part of his
original creation in God's image,
then a divine intelligence must
have put it there to serve God's
will by thinking. On the other
hand, if man's brain was
developed by the superior
evolutionary fitness of those apes
with the more inventive brains
who devised weapons to eliminate
duller apes, then the urge to use
the brain is instinctive. But these
same cruel elimination
mechanisms of evolution can also
account for the humaneness that
civilized people express through
their concern for the feelings of
the battered child and of the
abandoned pet animal: those
tribes who took best care of their
wounded and their farm and
combat animals were also more fit
to survive than their less humane
competitors. The truth
postulate's demand to use the
brain for the welfare of all
creatures thus seems to me to lie
deep at the core of humanism.
Original
Either God's creation of man
in his own image or the greater
evolutionary fitness of the more
humane tribes can be taken as the
origin of the concern postulate:
the basis of a humane civilization
is a human being's concern for the
emotions experience by his fellow
creatures. Both Christians and
atheists are sensitive to this
concern—not everyone in either
case, but in both cases
overwhelming majorities in
civilized societies. A cat is
different. It cannot effectively
keep its hunting skills at high
efficiency if conflicted by concern
about the feelings of the injured
mouse it uses for practice. One
theorem that follows from the
concern postulate is Christ's
Golden Rule and another is
Schweitzer's reverence for life.
But the concern postulate
qualifies Schweitzer's reverence
for life significantly: for example,
nerveless bacteria killed by an
antibiotic and weeds destroyed in
agriculture warrant little reverence
for their forms of life, because
neither has emotions worthy of
concern. The concern postulate
also puts human abortion in
perspective: before a human
embryo has developed a nervous
system that can record memories
of emotions, its death is of less
concern than the suffering of a
trapped mouse recording in its
memory for minutes or hours the
agony of a broken back and
ruptured kidneys.
The death postulate interprets
what it's all about — the final
balance sheet of life — the

appraisal of contributions to the
concern and truth postulates.
Here is my version of the death
postulate: During the last rational
five minutes of ny life, should I
happen to have my intellectual
powers intact, I hope to consider
that by demanding objective
inquiry and open discussion of
human quality problems I have
used my capacities in keeping
with the objective, like that of
Nobel's will, of conferring greatest
benefit on humanity. This
terminal self-esteem is an
appropriate objective for an
atheist whose last rational five
minutes are the ultimate
termination of thought and being,
but it can equally well be the
highest religious objective of a
believer in a day of judgment that
determines the quality of an
afterlife.
On the basis of the three
postulates, 1 view with
consternation — even abhorrence
— the attitude of those wishful
thinkers — I call them inverted
liberals — who maintain that all
babies are born equal. To me, it
seems immoral not to view with
concern, and perhaps not to try to
prevent, the birth of humans
destined with high probability to
feel that a malevolent conspiracy
ruthlessly contrives their
frustration. I am thinking here of
those human beings forced by the
improvidence of their mothers,
and the obtuseness of society, to
emerge into the world endowed
with emotions, aspirations, and
capacity to remember, but so
disadvantaged by an unfair shake
from a badly loaded parental
genetic dice cup that they have
mental capacities frustrating!}-
inadequate for our complex
modern society. The Saturday
Thoughts of October 15, 1971,
contributed to social obtuseness
by extolling those of low I.Q. and
denigrating the brillance that gave
us bifocals, telephones, a piece of
the moon in our hands, "the Pill,"
and control of famine and
pestilence.
These postulates together with
various scientific facts led to the
voluntary sterilization bonus plan
as a thinking exercise. I shall not
attempt further here to refute the
Saturday Thoughts' derogation of
my motives. For more complete
statements of my reasoning and
position, I refer the reader to my
articles in The Humanist and in
the Phi Delta Kappan for January
1972.
