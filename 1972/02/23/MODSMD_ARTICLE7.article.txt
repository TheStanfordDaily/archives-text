Nonviolence
Editor, THE DAILY:
Mr. Lyman was quoted by
Wednesday's Daily as saying
"Nonviolent does not mean
non-coercive. .. .the line of
reasoning runs, if a protest is
non-violent, it is good, and
therefore I should yield to the
demands. Would you have me do
the bidding of anyone willing to
starve himself? What if his
demand was to restore ROTC to
campus?"
There are three basic points
about this which must be brought
to the attention of the Stanford
Community:
1) Mr. Lyman implied that a
fast in support of ROTC would be
a non-violent action. This is a
fundamental misunderstanding of
the term nonviolence.
Nonviolence is not and can never
be a property of a single, isolated
action. An action obviously
cannot be considered nonviolent
if its goal is the perpetration of
violence—clearly, the ROTC
example is such a case.
2) I hope it was not deliberate,

but Mr. Lyman appears to have
been slightly less than honest in
using this fallacious analogy.
Within the next few minutes of
the interview, he dealt with a
difficult question by saying
something to the effect of "Let's
not deal with hypothetical
situations, but stick to the real."
(Isn't it real that the business of
making charred bodies and
deformed babies is conducted in
part at our placement center, and
not that someone is fasting for
ROTC?)
3) Most importantly, Mr.
Lyman would not even have to
worry about such situations as he
raised if he were willing to share
his decision-making power with
the community. It is clear that the
fast is directed to Mr. Lyman
precisely because he has the final
say in the formulation and
execution of policy. To give
people control over their
community seems to be a
reasonable and human resolution
to this problem.

Arrested
Editor, THE DAILY:
This is the complete text of my
statement when I was arrested
Thursday mornings:
"I wish 1 did not have to be here
today; I would rather be in my
organic chemistry lab. But our
paid employee, Richard Lyman,
has failed in his responsibility to
see to it that organizations which
are deeply and directly involved in
war crimes in Southeast Asia do
not carry on their business at
Stanford by recruiting here. For
nine days I have been fasting,
asking Mr. Lyman to suspend this
recruiting. Since my father is an
Army colonel, new deputy
director of Army Missile Testing
and Evaluation at White Sands
Missile Range, New Mexico, I have
lived with the military and its
weapons all my life; I saw the
horror they inflict when I was a
patient in an Army hospital with
maimed Vietnam veterans.
"I welcome the recruiters from
the Navy, Litton Industries,
McDonnell-Douglas, and TRW,
Inc., here for free and open
discussion of their work. As a
small gesture that I feel no ill will
towards them as human beings, I
have helped bake them some
cookies. But I cannot allow them
to carry on their business, which
includes getting new people to
work on more advanced methods
of killing. It is quite clear to me
that this is not legitimate business,
and cannot be made legitimate by
President Lyman, President
Nixon, or anyone else. I cannot
accept anyone's authority to tell

me that I must allow this
recruiting to continue."
I couldn't leave my quiet
discussion with Jerry King, the
representative of the Data
Systems Division of Litton, to
allow interviews which might lead
to war crimes. According to
Litton recruitment brochures, in
combat, "as many routine
functions as possible must be
performed by machine. And that
is the role of Litton's Data
Systems Division whose related
airborne and ground-based
systems—designed for command
and control—are the most
advanced such systems in
existence . . . MODICON systems
(the general name for these
systems) can automatically detect,
acquire, and attack multiple
targets, assign weapons," and
control aircraft and missile attack.
By my completely insignificant
suffering—fasting and going to
jail —I hoped to remind the
comfortable members of this
overly theoretical community of
the human reality of suffering in
Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.
More and more, this suffering is
remotely controlled by machines
that can't see the blood
splattering, the flesh burning, the
bones cracking, the millions of
acres of devastated land, the
agony of millions of people forced
to flee their homes; by machines
that can't hear orphans crying.
We must end the hypocrisy of
intellectually deciding that the
killing is wrong while we as
individuals or as a community
continue to contribute to it.
