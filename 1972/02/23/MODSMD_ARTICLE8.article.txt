# another approach
## Protests Form Of Violence 
### 
nancy lowe

Non-violent protest is also a
kind of violence. Fasting is a
psychologically pressuring and
manipulative tactic. There is still
the use of force, though it is a
more subtle and refined force.
The needs of violence are in
non-violence. It contains its
supposed opposite. Gandhi was
not at all an unviolent man.
I am wondering if there isn't
another way to approach a
problem. A way in which there is
no conflict, not even
psychological conflict. A way in
which there are no seeds of
violence planted; no roles of
moral superiority and moral
inferiority, a way without the
provocative quality of
self-righteousness, a way that
doesn't instill guilt.
Recently I heard a story about
an incident that happened in a
school in England the first
autumn it opened, two and a half
years ago. It is a story involving
the students at the school, of

which a friend of mine was one,
who didn't want to see the
pheasants on the school property
shot by the local lord who had
centuries old hunting rights on the
property. Already in the early fall
letters had been written to the
lord asking him to refrain from
hunting but he reiterated his
rights and the letters got no
where.
Finally one Saturday the issue
came up at a meeting of
everybody at the small school.
The students like many young
people everywhere wanted to
protest the lord's hunting in some
dramatic and effective
way .. . they wanted to throw
their bodies before the pheasants,
or physically block the lord from
coming onto the school property
or picket his estate. The staff, like
many staffs thought any action
was futile and suggested the
matter be gracefully dropped.
Some people at the school chose
to ignore the situation altogether.
'An old man who lived at the
school asked if it wasn't
important that whatever be done
it not create further
conflict. . . nor division. What
was essential, he pointed out, was
not the method . . . but the simple

thing .. . the feeling that the
students had about not wanting to
have the birds killed.
The feeling, that simple feeling
without the further complication
of method and means was not
against anyone; it did not take
sides or assume positions. He
wondered if the students couldn't
approach the problem with just
that feeling and not complicate it
further and create division.
The next day the students
made an appointment and went to
see the lord. He greeted them and
met their presence in his house in
his usual lordly way. They in their
turn were rather awkward and
inarticulate. But, my friend who
was there said, the atmosphere in
the room slowly began to change.
She herself didn't know what had
happened, or exactly what was
said. It was as if the specific words
themselves didn't matter, but
there was a sense of affection and
good will as if the feeling found
expression somehow. And before
very long the lord said he would
not hunt on any of the school
property and he even asked to
visit and that was the first time he
had shown any interest in the
school.

Non-violent protest is also a
kind of violence. Fasting is a
psychologically pressuring and
manipulative tactic. There is still
the use of force, though it is a
more subtle and refined force.
The needs of violence are in
non-violence. It contains its
supposed opposite. Gandhi was
not at all an unviolent man.
I am wondering if there isn't
another way to approach a
problem. A way in which there is
no conflict, not even
psychological conflict. A way in
which there are no seeds of
violence planted; no roles of
moral superiority and moral
inferiority, a way without the
provocative quality of
self-righteousness, a way that
doesn't instill guilt.
Recently I heard a story about
an incident that happened in a
school in England the first
autumn it opened, two and a half
years ago. It is a story involving
the students at the school, of

which a friend of mine was one,
who didn't want to see the
pheasants on the school property
shot by the local lord who had
centuries old hunting rights on the
property. Already in the early fall
letters had been written to the
lord asking him to refrain from
hunting but he reiterated his
rights and the letters got no
where.
Finally one Saturday the issue
came up at a meeting of
everybody at the small school.
The students like many young
people everywhere wanted to
protest the lord's hunting in some
dramatic and effective
way .. . they wanted to throw
their bodies before the pheasants,
or physically block the lord from
coming onto the school property
or picket his estate. The staff, like
many staffs thought any action
was futile and suggested the
matter be gracefully dropped.
Some people at the school chose
to ignore the situation altogether.
'An old man who lived at the
school asked if it wasn't
important that whatever be done
it not create further
conflict. . . nor division. What
was essential, he pointed out, was
not the method . . . but the simple

thing .. . the feeling that the
students had about not wanting to
have the birds killed.
The feeling, that simple feeling
without the further complication
of method and means was not
against anyone; it did not take
sides or assume positions. He
wondered if the students couldn't
approach the problem with just
that feeling and not complicate it
further and create division.
The next day the students
made an appointment and went to
see the lord. He greeted them and
met their presence in his house in
his usual lordly way. They in their
turn were rather awkward and
inarticulate. But, my friend who
was there said, the atmosphere in
the room slowly began to change.
She herself didn't know what had
happened, or exactly what was
said. It was as if the specific words
themselves didn't matter, but
there was a sense of affection and
good will as if the feeling found
expression somehow. And before
very long the lord said he would
not hunt on any of the school
property and he even asked to
visit and that was the first time he
had shown any interest in the
school.
