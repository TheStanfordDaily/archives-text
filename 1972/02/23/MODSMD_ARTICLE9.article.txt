## Pool Inequalities Great 
###

The inequities between
physical education facilities for
men and those for women appear
tremendous. These inequities
extend to other types of services
provided by the P.E. departments
for the Stanford Community. I
refer here to the use of the
swimming pools during the
summer.
A recent bulletin circulated in
the University sets out the use of
the Encina Fools (men's pools) for
the summer. Men may use these
pools during the prime times of
12:00 noon to 4:00 p.m. without
charge; during the hours of 12:00
to 2:00 they may bring their sons.
For a cost of $5.00 for the
summer men, women and children
may use the pools from 10:00
a.m. to 12:00 noon, and again
from 5:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.
These are weekday hours;
weekend hours are different.
These regulations apply to
faculty, staff and students.
When I called the Women's
Physical Education Department to
find out what their summer
schedule would be, I discovered,
first of all, that they did not
know, becuase they were
uncertain about the availability of
life-guards.
Why the men's pools can be
assured of life-guards and the
women's pools cannot be so
assured, I can't fathom. Inquiring
around further, 1 found that
weekdays, the women's pool is
open to faculty and staff from
12:00 to 1:30 or 2:00 during the
summer; no students or children.
Weekends last year the pool was
open for 25c a swim, from 12-5.
Meanings
What this means for women
students: they are not allowed
two prime hours of swimming
time which male students are
allowed.
What this means for women
faculty and staff: they are not
allowed to swim as much as men
faculty and staff are allowed (two
hours less). Furthermore, the all
male situation apparently allows
the men certain freedom from

wearing swim-suits, which are
mandatory at the women's pool.
And finally, daughters are clearly
not as much in need of swimming
as sons are; while sons are
permitted in the prime time at the
men's pool, daughters are not
permitted in the prime time at the
women's pool.
There are a number of issues
this inequitable distribution of
swimming time raises: 1) why the
university has to have separate
male-female swimming facilities,
2) why the "swimming pool
resources" have to be inequitably
distributed, instead of freely
available, 3) why children are

inequitably treated. Do we really
believe that men and women must
be separated because of their sex
and bodies, which are revealed in
various degrees by the swimming
environment? Do we really believe
that men have an inalienable right
to more of the resources of the
university than women do? Do we
really believe that boys need more
exercise and companionship with
their parents than girls do? That
seems to be the message of the
swimming pools' rules (among
other things).
