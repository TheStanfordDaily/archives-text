# Davis Released On Bail, Leaves Palo Alto Jail
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Angela Davis walked out of her
Palo Alto jail cell last night, freed on
bail of $102,500 after 16 months'
imprisonment.
As about 100 supporters shreiked
in joy, Davis appeared for a moment
outside the door of the North County
jail. She smiled and gave a clenched
fist salute, then sped off in a waiting
car to an undisclosed location.
Davis was released at 7:10 p.m., less
than four hours after Superior Court
Judge Richard E. Arnason ruled in San
Jose that she could be released
"immediately" after posting a
$100,000 bail bond and $2,500 cash.
The black Communist faces
murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy
charges in a trial scheduled to begin
Monday in San Jose. The state charges
that Davis purchased four guns used in
the August 7, 1970 escape attempt at
the Marin County Courthouse, which
ended in four deaths.
In the order for bail, Amason ruled
that Davis could travel anywhere
within the Bay Area, that she could
not travel by airplane, and that she
would have to receive court permission
before leaving the Bay Area.
Arnason also ruled that Davis must
reside at a designated location in Santa
Clara County throughout the trial. The
location of the home where she will
stay was kept secret for security
reasons.
Davis must report weekly to a
probation officer, who met her during
today's hearing. She is prohibited from
having firearms, must seek court
permission to speak at meetings and
rallies, and is barred by earlier court

order from discussing the case.
'Battle Ahead'
Chief defense attorney Howard
Moore, Jr., said Davis was "very happy
to be out." He called the bail decision
a victory but said "a decisive battle is
still ahead" in the trial.
In a four-hour closed session in
Arnason's chambers yesterday, Davis
and her lawyers argued that her release
was required by last Friday's
California Supreme Court decision,
which eliminated capital punishment
in the state.
The defendant argued that a state
law which prohibited bail in "capital
cases" has been voided by elimination
of the death penalty.
Assistant Attorney General Albert
Harris, Jr., the prosecutor, said he
would not appeal Arnason's ruling for
bail. But he charged that Arnason's
decision was "contrary to law"
because the judge should have
postponed his ruling until the State
Supreme Court decides next month
whether to rehear its ruling on the
death penalty.
Moore commented that Arnason
rejected Harris' request because he felt
"no good would be served by a delay."
He said "everyone recognizes" that the
Supreme Court will not rescind its 6-1
decision on the death penalty.
Arnason cited the law prohibiting
bail in capital offenses when he denied
an earlier request for release last June.
The Marin County Probation
Department had recommended that
Davis was a good bail risk at that time,
when the trial was scheduled for San
Rafael.
Davis was released from the Palo

Alto jail after bail was obtained and
submitted to the court through a San
Jose bail bondsman.
Collateral Furnished
Moore revealed that collateral for
the bond was put up in the form of
property by the McAfee Family
Cooperative in Fresno.
More said Roger McAfee runs the
non-profit enterprise as an "alternative
to capitalism." He said McAfee
"thinks the stands [Davis] has taken
will further the cooperative movement
in this country."
A lengthy jury selection process
will begin Davis' trial Monday. Harris
announced yesterday that he plans to
call 103 prosecution witnesses. He
predicted the trial will take four
months.

Jose that she could be released
"immediately" after posting a
$100,000 bail bond and $2,500 cash.
The black Communist faces
murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy
charges in a trial scheduled to begin
Monday in San Jose. The state charges
that Davis purchased four guns used in
the August 7, 1970 escape attempt at
the Marin County Courthouse, which
ended in four deaths.
In the order for bail, Amason ruled
that Davis could travel anywhere
within the Bay Area, that she could
not travel by airplane, and that she
would have to receive court permission
before leaving the Bay Area.
Arnason also ruled that Davis must
reside at a designated location in Santa
Clara County throughout the trial. The
location of the home where she will
stay was kept secret for security
reasons.
Davis must report weekly to a
probation officer, who met her during
today's hearing. She is prohibited from
having firearms, must seek court
permission to speak at meetings and
rallies, and is barred by earlier court

order from discussing the case.
'Battle Ahead'
Chief defense attorney Howard
Moore, Jr., said Davis was "very happy
to be out." He called the bail decision
a victory but said "a decisive battle is
still ahead" in the trial.
In a four-hour closed session in
Arnason's chambers yesterday, Davis
and her lawyers argued that her release
was required by last Friday's
California Supreme Court decision,
which eliminated capital punishment
in the state.
The defendant argued that a state
law which prohibited bail in "capital
cases" has been voided by elimination
of the death penalty.
Assistant Attorney General Albert
Harris, Jr., the prosecutor, said he
would not appeal Arnason's ruling for
bail. But he charged that Arnason's
decision was "contrary to law"
because the judge should have
postponed his ruling until the State
Supreme Court decides next month
whether to rehear its ruling on the
death penalty.
Moore commented that Arnason
rejected Harris' request because he felt
"no good would be served by a delay."
He said "everyone recognizes" that the
Supreme Court will not rescind its 6-1
decision on the death penalty.
Arnason cited the law prohibiting
bail in capital offenses when he denied
an earlier request for release last June.
The Marin County Probation
Department had recommended that
Davis was a good bail risk at that time,
when the trial was scheduled for San
Rafael.
Davis was released from the Palo

Alto jail after bail was obtained and
submitted to the court through a San
Jose bail bondsman.
Collateral Furnished
Moore revealed that collateral for
the bond was put up in the form of
property by the McAfee Family
Cooperative in Fresno.
More said Roger McAfee runs the
non-profit enterprise as an "alternative
to capitalism." He said McAfee
"thinks the stands [Davis] has taken
will further the cooperative movement
in this country."
A lengthy jury selection process
will begin Davis' trial Monday. Harris
announced yesterday that he plans to
call 103 prosecution witnesses. He
predicted the trial will take four
months.

Angela Davis walked out of her
Palo Alto jail cell last night, freed on
bail of $102,500 after 16 months'
imprisonment.
As about 100 supporters shreiked
in joy, Davis appeared for a moment
outside the door of the North County
jail. She smiled and gave a clenched
fist salute, then sped off in a waiting
car to an undisclosed location.
Davis was released at 7:10 p.m., less
than four hours after Superior Court
Judge Richard E. Arnason ruled in San
Jose that she could be released
"immediately" after posting a
$100,000 bail bond and $2,500 cash.
