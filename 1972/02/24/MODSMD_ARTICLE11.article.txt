# Organic Gardening
## Store Sells Ecology, Education 
### ELLEN SWANBERG 
A new store recently opened on
El Camino — this one selling
education and ecology in the form
of organic gardening supplies.
"Common Ground", a
non-profit store just south of
campus on El Camino Real was
opened by Ecology Action, an
organization that has pushed
strongly for Palo Alto recycling
efforts, and now sells a variety of
items including: fertilizer, seeds,
tools, collapsible compost bins,
books, birdseed, recycled typing
paper and envelopes.
The store is an educational as
well as a business project,
according to John Jeavons,
Common Ground's "technical
advisor." "We want to show that
there is a demand, a need for this
sort of project. Our main goal is
to act as a catalyst in encouraging
the community to become aware
of environmental issues," he said.
Ecology Action took on a glass
and metals recycling project last
year and operated it
independently for several months.
Subsequent public attention
stimulated Palo Alto to assume
responsibility for the program.
This emphasis on generating
community attention and action
has become the underlying"
philosophy of Ecology Action.
Ecological Alternatives
"Our main function is to make
the community become aware of
the ecological alternatives, and to
develop the environmentally
sensitive attitude," Jeavons noted.
"Once this is done people will
sstart thinking in terms of
ecology. They'll see that organic
gardening is applied ecology, and
once they see that it can work in a
practical, economic and healthy
manner, they'll start asking the
right questions."

To Jeavons and his co-workers,
the right questions approach
ecology with personal
committment in mind. "People
have to ask themselves, 'what can
I do to start living in an
environmentally sound
atmosphere?'.
"The biggest difficulty with
that attitude now is that many
feel nothing can be done. We want
to offer proof that things can be
done. Once that barrier is broken,
there will be less need for our
service . . . this is antoher function
of the catalyst — it makes things
realizable."
Recycled Products
Following the catalyst role,
Jeavons envisions local stores and
nurseries carrying organic and
recycled products. "When they
start doing this, we won't need to
be in the business anymore," he
said. "There will still be organic
gardens and ecological products,
but our need fade, and we'll
move into other areas."
However, it is possible that
Ecology Action may maintain
Common Ground as a working
base. The group plans to expand
the store into a basic ecology
resource center.
After mid-April the income tax
firm which shares Common
Ground's building will move out.
With the additional room the
group plans to hold lectures,
workshops and seminars, and will
establish a small library of books
and magazines dealing with
ecology. Another proposed
project is the organization of an
ecology switchboard.
Business Students
Common Ground organizers
have been assisted by three
business students, David Dullom,
Paul Shapiro, and Steve Cooper.

They work through Stanford's
Business Development Association
(BDA), an organization which
primarily advises minority
business but includes Common
Ground because of the store's
non-profit and community-service
nature.
Also, because the store's
co-directors, Linda Schuck and
Betsy Jeavons are women, they
anticipated problems similar to
those encountered by minorities.
The advisors have set up
systems of accounting and
inventory, and are now working
on a more professional marketing
program for the store. They hope
to devlop Common Ground's
credibility within the corporate
community, encouraging
businesses to accept Common
Ground's products as
economically satisfactory.
Coupled with this is a more
general goal of fostering corporate
interest in ecology. Shapiro
believes this must be done by
establishing "a social
responsibility in the business
community."
Lack of Credibility
His difficulty so far has been
"Ecology Action's lack of
professionalism and supposed lack
of credibility," Shapiro said.
"Corporations react negatively
to the idea of giving money to
Community Chest and non-profit
organizations. They prefer to deal
with well-established
professionals. We're trying to
develop Common Ground's
credibility by selling its ideas to
those business which are
receptive."
Shapiro hopes the BDA's
involvement with the store will
"make ecology a cost
competitive" attraction to
businesses.

"Ecology Action has
historically dealt with the
community. We've added a new
path in their approach," explains
Shapiro. "We're attacking the
business community as well."
Jeavons admits he doesn't see
business interest a being so
important. "The educational
thrust of our project is the most
significant, and the money is
co-incidental," he said.
"We are realistic, though, and
we'd definitely like to see
supermarkets and stationery
stores stock recycled paper. More
important, we'd like to see paper
makers here produce recycled
products." The store's recycled
papers are now shipped from the
east coast.
Jeavons considers an ecology
resource center to be "especially
important." People can meet here
and begin doing things more
seriously. "We hope to teach
other people to practice ecology,
and to get businesses, even
universities to start doing it,"he
said. "But if we worry about
money, we probably won't make
any."
Common Ground hopes to
share ideas with people who have
gardening experience or expertise.
"We appreciate comments from
people in the area because, in a
sense, we're just learning too, said
Betsy Jeavons, co-manager of the
store.
"I'm sure there are a lot of
Stanford faculty and students
who have gardening experience,"
she added. "We'd love to have
them come and advise us."
Involvement Corps
Another group instrumental in
Common Ground's development
has been the Involvement Corps.
Besides functioning as additional
advisors, Involvement Corpsmen
have performed much of the
physical labor necessary in
activating the store,,
Besides Common Ground,
Ecology Action is negotiating
with two businesses to acquire a
four-acre plot of land as a
community garden.
Three of the acres would be
used for demonstration and
teaching purposes. Income from
the produce would pay the water
bills and help support the store.
The remaining interspersed acre
would be set asfde for anyone
wishing to cultivate it.
Again, the educational aspect
of such a project is stressed:
"People will see the gardening
success there, and they'll wonder
if it can't work in their back yards
as well," Jeavons explained.
Until now the store has been
surviving on leftover funds from
Ecology Action's original
recycling project. By March 1 this
allowance wilf be depleted, and
Ecology Action is anxiously
hoping to see the store pay for
itself.
The group is also using
donations and surplus funds from
its bicycle safety and repairs
classes but the now six-member,
full-time, paid store staff is
bracing itself for part-time, purely
volunteer work.
Ecology Action has applied for
a government grant but will not
be informed of any decision for
several weeks.

and magazines dealing with
ecology. Another proposed
project is the organization of an
ecology switchboard.
Business Students
Common Ground organizers
have been assisted by three
business students, David Dullom,
Paul Shapiro, and Steve Cooper.

They work through Stanford's
Business Development Association
(BDA), an organization which
primarily advises minority
business but includes Common
Ground because of the store's
non-profit and community-service
nature.
Also, because the store's
co-directors, Linda Schuck and
Betsy Jeavons are women, they
anticipated problems similar to
those encountered by minorities.
The advisors have set up
systems of accounting and
inventory, and are now working
on a more professional marketing
program for the store. They hope
to devlop Common Ground's
credibility within the corporate
community, encouraging
businesses to accept Common
Ground's products as
economically satisfactory.
Coupled with this is a more
general goal of fostering corporate
interest in ecology. Shapiro
believes this must be done by
establishing "a social
responsibility in the business
community."
Lack of Credibility
His difficulty so far has been
"Ecology Action's lack of
professionalism and supposed lack
of credibility," Shapiro said.
"Corporations react negatively
to the idea of giving money to
Community Chest and non-profit
organizations. They prefer to deal
with well-established
professionals. We're trying to
develop Common Ground's
credibility by selling its ideas to
those business which are
receptive."
Shapiro hopes the BDA's
involvement with the store will
"make ecology a cost
competitive" attraction to
businesses.

"Ecology Action has
historically dealt with the
community. We've added a new
path in their approach," explains
Shapiro. "We're attacking the
business community as well."
Jeavons admits he doesn't see
business interest a being so
important. "The educational
thrust of our project is the most
significant, and the money is
co-incidental," he said.
"We are realistic, though, and
we'd definitely like to see
supermarkets and stationery
stores stock recycled paper. More
important, we'd like to see paper
makers here produce recycled
products." The store's recycled
papers are now shipped from the
east coast.
Jeavons considers an ecology
resource center to be "especially
important." People can meet here
and begin doing things more
seriously. "We hope to teach
other people to practice ecology,
and to get businesses, even
universities to start doing it,"he
said. "But if we worry about
money, we probably won't make
any."
Common Ground hopes to
share ideas with people who have
gardening experience or expertise.
"We appreciate comments from
people in the area because, in a
sense, we're just learning too, said
Betsy Jeavons, co-manager of the
store.
"I'm sure there are a lot of
Stanford faculty and students
who have gardening experience,"
she added. "We'd love to have
them come and advise us."
Involvement Corps
Another group instrumental in
Common Ground's development
has been the Involvement Corps.
Besides functioning as additional
advisors, Involvement Corpsmen
have performed much of the
physical labor necessary in
activating the store,,
Besides Common Ground,
Ecology Action is negotiating
with two businesses to acquire a
four-acre plot of land as a
community garden.
Three of the acres would be
used for demonstration and
teaching purposes. Income from
the produce would pay the water
bills and help support the store.
The remaining interspersed acre
would be set asfde for anyone
wishing to cultivate it.
Again, the educational aspect
of such a project is stressed:
"People will see the gardening
success there, and they'll wonder
if it can't work in their back yards
as well," Jeavons explained.
Until now the store has been
surviving on leftover funds from
Ecology Action's original
recycling project. By March 1 this
allowance wilf be depleted, and
Ecology Action is anxiously
hoping to see the store pay for
itself.
The group is also using
donations and surplus funds from
its bicycle safety and repairs
classes but the now six-member,
full-time, paid store staff is
bracing itself for part-time, purely
volunteer work.
Ecology Action has applied for
a government grant but will not
be informed of any decision for
several weeks.
A new store recently opened on
El Camino — this one selling
education and ecology in the form
of organic gardening supplies.
"Common Ground", a
non-profit store just south of
campus on El Camino Real was
opened by Ecology Action, an
organization that has pushed
strongly for Palo Alto recycling
efforts, and now sells a variety of
items including: fertilizer, seeds,
tools, collapsible compost bins,
books, birdseed, recycled typing
paper and envelopes.
The store is an educational as
well as a business project,
according to John Jeavons,
Common Ground's "technical
advisor." "We want to show that
there is a demand, a need for this
sort of project. Our main goal is
to act as a catalyst in encouraging
the community to become aware
of environmental issues," he said.
Ecology Action took on a glass
and metals recycling project last
year and operated it
independently for several months.
Subsequent public attention
stimulated Palo Alto to assume
responsibility for the program.
This emphasis on generating
community attention and action
has become the underlying"
philosophy of Ecology Action.
Ecological Alternatives
"Our main function is to make
the community become aware of
the ecological alternatives, and to
develop the environmentally
sensitive attitude," Jeavons noted.
"Once this is done people will
sstart thinking in terms of
ecology. They'll see that organic
gardening is applied ecology, and
once they see that it can work in a
practical, economic and healthy
manner, they'll start asking the
right questions."

To Jeavons and his co-workers,
the right questions approach
ecology with personal
committment in mind. "People
have to ask themselves, 'what can
I do to start living in an
environmentally sound
atmosphere?'.
"The biggest difficulty with
that attitude now is that many
feel nothing can be done. We want
to offer proof that things can be
done. Once that barrier is broken,
there will be less need for our
service . . . this is antoher function
of the catalyst — it makes things
realizable."
Recycled Products
Following the catalyst role,
Jeavons envisions local stores and
nurseries carrying organic and
recycled products. "When they
start doing this, we won't need to
be in the business anymore," he
said. "There will still be organic
gardens and ecological products,
but our need fade, and we'll
move into other areas."
However, it is possible that
Ecology Action may maintain
Common Ground as a working
base. The group plans to expand
the store into a basic ecology
resource center.
After mid-April the income tax
firm which shares Common
Ground's building will move out.
With the additional room the
group plans to hold lectures,
workshops and seminars, and will
establish a small library of books
and magazines dealing with
ecology. Another proposed
project is the organization of an
ecology switchboard.

Betsy Jeavons, co-manager of the
store.
"I'm sure there are a lot of
Stanford faculty and students
who have gardening experience,"
she added. "We'd love to have
them come and advise us."
Involvement Corps
Another group instrumental in
Common Ground's development
has been the Involvement Corps.
Besides functioning as additional
advisors, Involvement Corpsmen
have performed much of the
physical labor necessary in
activating the store,,
Besides Common Ground,
Ecology Action is negotiating
with two businesses to acquire a
four-acre plot of land as a
community garden.
Three of the acres would be
used for demonstration and
teaching purposes. Income from
the produce would pay the water
bills and help support the store.
The remaining interspersed acre
would be set asfde for anyone
wishing to cultivate it.
Again, the educational aspect
of such a project is stressed:
"People will see the gardening
success there, and they'll wonder
if it can't work in their back yards
as well," Jeavons explained.
Until now the store has been
surviving on leftover funds from
Ecology Action's original
recycling project. By March 1 this
allowance wilf be depleted, and
Ecology Action is anxiously
hoping to see the store pay for
itself.
The group is also using
donations and surplus funds from
its bicycle safety and repairs
classes but the now six-member,
full-time, paid store staff is
bracing itself for part-time, purely
volunteer work.
Ecology Action has applied for
a government grant but will not
be informed of any decision for
several weeks.
A new store recently opened on
El Camino — this one selling
education and ecology in the form
of organic gardening supplies.
"Common Ground", a
non-profit store just south of
campus on El Camino Real was
opened by Ecology Action, an
organization that has pushed
strongly for Palo Alto recycling
efforts, and now sells a variety of
items including: fertilizer, seeds,
tools, collapsible compost bins,
books, birdseed, recycled typing
paper and envelopes.
The store is an educational as
well as a business project,
according to John Jeavons,
Common Ground's "technical
advisor." "We want to show that
there is a demand, a need for this
sort of project. Our main goal is
to act as a catalyst in encouraging
the community to become aware
of environmental issues," he said.
Ecology Action took on a glass
and metals recycling project last
year and operated it
independently for several months.
Subsequent public attention
stimulated Palo Alto to assume
responsibility for the program.
This emphasis on generating
community attention and action
has become the underlying"
philosophy of Ecology Action.
Ecological Alternatives
"Our main function is to make
the community become aware of
the ecological alternatives, and to
develop the environmentally
sensitive attitude," Jeavons noted.
"Once this is done people will
sstart thinking in terms of
ecology. They'll see that organic
gardening is applied ecology, and
once they see that it can work in a
practical, economic and healthy
manner, they'll start asking the
right questions."

To Jeavons and his co-workers,
the right questions approach
ecology with personal
committment in mind. "People
have to ask themselves, 'what can
I do to start living in an
environmentally sound
atmosphere?'.
"The biggest difficulty with
that attitude now is that many
feel nothing can be done. We want
to offer proof that things can be
done. Once that barrier is broken,
there will be less need for our
service . . . this is antoher function
of the catalyst — it makes things
realizable."
Recycled Products
Following the catalyst role,
Jeavons envisions local stores and
nurseries carrying organic and
recycled products. "When they
start doing this, we won't need to
be in the business anymore," he
said. "There will still be organic
gardens and ecological products,
but our need fade, and we'll
move into other areas."
However, it is possible that
Ecology Action may maintain
Common Ground as a working
base. The group plans to expand
the store into a basic ecology
resource center.
After mid-April the income tax
firm which shares Common
Ground's building will move out.
With the additional room the
group plans to hold lectures,
workshops and seminars, and will
establish a small library of books
and magazines dealing with
ecology. Another proposed
project is the organization of an
ecology switchboard.
Business Students
Common Ground organizers
have been assisted by three
business students, David Dullom,
Paul Shapiro, and Steve Cooper.

They work through Stanford's
Business Development Association
(BDA), an organization which
primarily advises minority
business but includes Common
Ground because of the store's
non-profit and community-service
nature.
Also, because the store's
co-directors, Linda Schuck and
Betsy Jeavons are women, they
anticipated problems similar to
those encountered by minorities.
The advisors have set up
systems of accounting and
inventory, and are now working
on a more professional marketing
program for the store. They hope
to devlop Common Ground's
credibility within the corporate
community, encouraging
businesses to accept Common
Ground's products as
economically satisfactory.
Coupled with this is a more
general goal of fostering corporate
interest in ecology. Shapiro
believes this must be done by
establishing "a social
responsibility in the business
community."
Lack of Credibility
His difficulty so far has been
"Ecology Action's lack of
professionalism and supposed lack
of credibility," Shapiro said.
"Corporations react negatively
to the idea of giving money to
Community Chest and non-profit
organizations. They prefer to deal
with well-established
professionals. We're trying to
develop Common Ground's
credibility by selling its ideas to
those business which are
receptive."
Shapiro hopes the BDA's
involvement with the store will
"make ecology a cost
competitive" attraction to
businesses.

"Ecology Action has
historically dealt with the
community. We've added a new
path in their approach," explains
Shapiro. "We're attacking the
business community as well."
Jeavons admits he doesn't see
business interest a being so
important. "The educational
thrust of our project is the most
significant, and the money is
co-incidental," he said.
"We are realistic, though, and
we'd definitely like to see
supermarkets and stationery
stores stock recycled paper. More
important, we'd like to see paper
makers here produce recycled
products." The store's recycled
papers are now shipped from the
east coast.
Jeavons considers an ecology
resource center to be "especially
important." People can meet here
and begin doing things more
seriously. "We hope to teach
other people to practice ecology,
and to get businesses, even
universities to start doing it,"he
said. "But if we worry about
money, we probably won't make
any."
Common Ground hopes to
share ideas with people who have
gardening experience or expertise.
"We appreciate comments from
people in the area because, in a
sense, we're just learning too, said
Betsy Jeavons, co-manager of the
store.
"I'm sure there are a lot of
