# Palo Alto Council Denies Day Care In Close Vote
## 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council
Tuesday night dealt a severe blow
to proponents of child care in the
area. At issue were plans to open a
new infant care center (for
children up to 2-1/2 years) in the
nursery facilities of the First
Presbyterian Church in Palo Alto.
By a 5 to 4 vote, the Council,
yielding to opposition from
neighborhood groups who
apposed the alleged political
nature of the center, refused to
grant a use permit for its
operation. Adjournment of the
meeting immediately after the
decision touched off an angry
outburst by parents who hoped to
use the center.
Children in arms, parents
accosted Palo Alto Mayor Kirk
Comstock whose nay vote decided
the issue. "Here Kirk," thrusting
her child at Comstock, she
shouted, "You take care of my
child while I go to work. I can't
afford to stay home." Another
mother burst out crying, and later
shouted, "My husband is just an
ambulance driver and I have a
health problem and I need to
work. Where should I go now?"
Opponents of the Center were
angered by an article in Pamoja
Venceremos, the Venceremos
weekly newspaper, by two

members of Child Care Now, the
group which planned to operate
the infant care center. Lynn Ober,
one of the authors appeared
before the Council to explain that
the views on child care expressed
in the article were hers and her
co-author's and did not represent
Child Care Now.
"We are only two members,"
she said. "We feel we have a right
to express our views. We should
have made it clearer in the article
that we did not speak for the
whole group," she said.
Attorney Don Davis,
representing the University Park
Association (UPA), a group of
residents in the area told the
Council that the politics of the
people running the center was not
the issue. "We are concerned with
what will happen to the
neighborhood." However, a letter
sent out by UPA, criticizing
Ober's article and the
accompanying picture, and
testimony of other opponents to
the center led a number of
Council members to state that
there is a basic political problem
with approving the center.
Councilman William Clarke,
noted that "Most people have
tried to keep the issue on
intrusion into the neighborhood
(in their testimony) but I felt in
every case that there was a
definite political undercurrent."
A petition opposing the center
signed by about 400 Palo Alto
residents, including about 250
who lived in the immediate area,
was presented by UPA, Referring
to this, Comstock justified his
decision to vote no, telling Child
Care Now that they had done a
poor political job and didn't know
how to get along with their
neighbors.
"Political activities" of the
First Presbyterian Church also
came under fire from several
opponents of the Center. The
Church, which sponsored a drug
crisis intervention center recently
allowed a sailor bound for Viet
Nam to take sanctuary on its
premises.
Mrs. Kari Stangenes told the
Council that she felt the Church
should be investigated by the

internal revenue service. It's
political activities are annoying its
neighbors. "This Prebyterian
Church has forgotten why it is
there and enjoys tax exempt
status," she said.
Earlier in the meeting, Len
Cornell, long-tine realtor in Palo
Alto, questioned the Council
about using political criteria for
denying a use permit. "Are we
going back to the old days of
weeding out from every
community effort those with
whom we can't agree politically?"
Councilman Clarke, also fearing
political criteria stated, "If we
give use permits on any other
basis than the number of cars,
etc., we are in trouble."
Comstock and Councilmen
John Beahrs, John Berwald,
Stanley Norton and Richard
Rosenbauni. Those voting in favor
were: William Clark, Sylvia
Seman, Alan Henderson and Enid
Pearson.
Seman tried unsuccessfully to
get a 90-day continuance while a
citizens' committee could study
child care problems and
recommend a program for the
center. â€¢
