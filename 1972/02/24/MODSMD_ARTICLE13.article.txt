## Emeritus Prof Succumbs 
### 
Henry B. McDaniel, 68,
emeritus professor of education
and psychology at Stanford, died
in Los Angeles last Sunday while
attending a conference on high
school guidance.
McDaniel, who retired in 1968,
had been on the Stanford faculty
since 1946. He was promoted to
full professor in 1949.
Death was attributed to a heart
attack. Services were private.
McDaniel was a longtime
spokesman for the great middle of
American high school students,
who, as he once put it in a speech,
"are neither brilliant nor potential
dropouts."
A former chief of the Bureau
of Guidance in the State
Department of Education, he had
long worked toward updated high

school guidance and counseling
techniques.
At the time of his death, he
was associated with Youth
Guidance Systems Inc. of Palo
Alto, which is now conducting a
pilot program in five California
high schools to help students
make their own career decisions
with computerized assistance.
He was also serving as a
consultant to the College
Entrance Examination Board.
McDaniel was educated at the
University of Arizona and

Teachers College, Columbia
University. He was a diplomate of
the American Board of
Psychology Examiners, a fellow of
the American Psychology
Association, a trustee of the
National Vocational Guidance
Association, and a member of the
board of directors of the
California Society for Secondary
Education. He was the author of
two recent studies: Guidance in
the Modern School and Readings
in Guidance.
