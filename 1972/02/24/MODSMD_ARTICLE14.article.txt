# 'Blithe Spirit'
## 'Comedy' Lacks Humor 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
In the very early moments of
"Blithe Spirit," the main
characters down a number of
martinis and in retrospect, I
should have prefaced my
playgoing with a drink or two or
three or four. . ..
Noel Coward's World War
11-vintage "comedy" dragged on
and on for over two and a half
hours at The Nitery Tuesday night
with very few truly funny
moments. The main idea behind
the work has some comic
potential, but the execution of
that idea and the overabundance
of clichaically unfunny lines of
purported "humor" make for a
long evening indeed.
"Blithe Spirit" won the 1942
New York Drama Critics Award
for Best Play of the Year and
although many dramatic works
are timeless in their value and
relevancy (ala "Edward II," the
last Stanford Drama Department
production) this work has lost a
lot in 30 years, it would seem. I
think the Drama Department
would have been better off leaving
it unrevived.
Basically the story line is about
a novelist whose deceased first
wife returns from the dead one
night and proceeds to wreak
havoc upon his second marriage.
Elvira is visible and audible only
to Mr. Condomine and the
problems this creates with the
new Mrs. Condomine are
predictable.
The "Other Side"
Elvira plots to kill Mr.
Condomine so he can join her on
the "Other Side." But the
booby-trapped car he was
supposed to expire in is driven
instead by the new Mrs.
Condomine, so it is her who joins
Elvira in the "second life."
While enduring "Blithe Spirit,"
I couldn't help but think of the
marvelous "Harvey," which

employs a fairly similar situation
and which is one of the funniest
comedies of all time. Thinking of
Jimmie Stewart and his immortal
rabbit companion made the poor
humor of "Blithe Spirit" even
more unmoving.
The few real humorous
moments in the play were
provided primarily by the
delightfully eccentric Madame
Arcati. Adrienne Moloney played
the wonderfully wacky medium
very well. She was particularly
adroit at handling the vocal
variety which makes Madame
Arcati a fairly funny nut.
Moloney handled
pronounciation, tone, and
phrasing very admirably. Her
performance was commendable,
but it is impossible for any single
performer to save this work.
Striking Resemblence
The rest of the cast didn't
noticeably. affect me in any
measurable qualitative terms.
Steven L. Weber as Charles
Condomine will probably be most
memorable to me because he
oftimes bears a striking
resemblance to Edgar Bergen's old
sidekick, Charlie McCarthy.
Leslie Rivers, as his wife Ruth,
bore a similar resemblance to
Carol Burnett. Having dispensed
with my facial comparison fetish,
I must admit that neither of them
impressed me as being terribly
good or terribly bad.
Weber has a very discernible
technique of overemphasizing his
"s"s, and this becomes quite
annoying after awhile. However,
he did seem appropriately
facetious and aloof most of the
time.
Rivers was good at times during
the verbal warfare with her
husband, but she had some
problems effectively carrying off
a couple of emotional changes
which became quite

melodramatic.
Trying Too Hard
I think the major problem I had
with most of the cast, except for
Moloney, was that all the actors
never progressed to the point of
becoming completely believeable
characters. I almost continually
felt that they were trying too hard
to "act properly" and fill the
physical and vocal requirements
of their roles, instead of relaxing
and flowing into their parts.
The technical end of this
production evoked a very
indifferent reaction. The lighting,
scene and costume design weren't
really bad. Then again, they
weren't noticeably good either.
Perhaps superior acting and
technical prowess could have
saved this dated English comedy. I
doubt it. After all, not even a fine
actor like Clint Eastwood could
save something like "Coogan's
Bluff." "Blithe Spirit" just
doesn't have what it takes.

Elvira plots to kill Mr.
Condomine so he can join her on
the "Other Side." But the
booby-trapped car he was
supposed to expire in is driven
instead by the new Mrs.
Condomine, so it is her who joins
Elvira in the "second life."
While enduring "Blithe Spirit,"
I couldn't help but think of the
marvelous "Harvey," which

employs a fairly similar situation
and which is one of the funniest
comedies of all time. Thinking of
Jimmie Stewart and his immortal
rabbit companion made the poor
humor of "Blithe Spirit" even
more unmoving.
The few real humorous
moments in the play were
provided primarily by the
delightfully eccentric Madame
Arcati. Adrienne Moloney played
the wonderfully wacky medium
very well. She was particularly
adroit at handling the vocal
variety which makes Madame
Arcati a fairly funny nut.
Moloney handled
pronounciation, tone, and
phrasing very admirably. Her
performance was commendable,
but it is impossible for any single
performer to save this work.
Striking Resemblence
The rest of the cast didn't
noticeably. affect me in any
measurable qualitative terms.
Steven L. Weber as Charles
Condomine will probably be most
memorable to me because he
oftimes bears a striking
resemblance to Edgar Bergen's old
sidekick, Charlie McCarthy.
Leslie Rivers, as his wife Ruth,
bore a similar resemblance to
Carol Burnett. Having dispensed
with my facial comparison fetish,
I must admit that neither of them
impressed me as being terribly
good or terribly bad.
Weber has a very discernible
technique of overemphasizing his
"s"s, and this becomes quite
annoying after awhile. However,
he did seem appropriately
facetious and aloof most of the
time.
Rivers was good at times during
the verbal warfare with her
husband, but she had some
problems effectively carrying off
a couple of emotional changes
which became quite

melodramatic.
Trying Too Hard
I think the major problem I had
with most of the cast, except for
Moloney, was that all the actors
never progressed to the point of
becoming completely believeable
characters. I almost continually
felt that they were trying too hard
to "act properly" and fill the
physical and vocal requirements
of their roles, instead of relaxing
and flowing into their parts.
The technical end of this
production evoked a very
indifferent reaction. The lighting,
scene and costume design weren't
really bad. Then again, they
weren't noticeably good either.
Perhaps superior acting and
technical prowess could have
saved this dated English comedy. I
doubt it. After all, not even a fine
actor like Clint Eastwood could
save something like "Coogan's
Bluff." "Blithe Spirit" just
doesn't have what it takes.

MADAME ARC ATl—The happy eccentric Medium of Noel Coward's "Blithe Spirit," played by Adrienne
Moloney, launches a seance at the Nitery. The play opened Tuesday.
In the very early moments of
"Blithe Spirit," the main
characters down a number of
martinis and in retrospect, I
should have prefaced my
playgoing with a drink or two or
three or four. . ..
Noel Coward's World War
11-vintage "comedy" dragged on
and on for over two and a half
hours at The Nitery Tuesday night
with very few truly funny
moments. The main idea behind
the work has some comic
potential, but the execution of
that idea and the overabundance
of clichaically unfunny lines of
purported "humor" make for a
long evening indeed.
"Blithe Spirit" won the 1942
New York Drama Critics Award
for Best Play of the Year and
although many dramatic works
are timeless in their value and
relevancy (ala "Edward II," the
last Stanford Drama Department
production) this work has lost a
lot in 30 years, it would seem. I
think the Drama Department
would have been better off leaving
it unrevived.
Basically the story line is about
a novelist whose deceased first
wife returns from the dead one
night and proceeds to wreak
havoc upon his second marriage.
Elvira is visible and audible only
to Mr. Condomine and the
problems this creates with the
new Mrs. Condomine are
predictable.
The "Other Side"
Elvira plots to kill Mr.
Condomine so he can join her on
the "Other Side." But the
booby-trapped car he was
