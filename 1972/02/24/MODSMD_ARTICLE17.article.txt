# Specialists Join SLAC On Internships
## 
### 
Eight unemployed scientists
and engineers will go to work
shortly at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC) under
a new one-year internship
program established by the
National Science Foundation
(NSF).
They will be among 420 such
specialists across the country who
will take jobs for one year under
NSF's new program of
"Presidential Internships in
Science and Engineering" at
"federally funded" research and
development centers. Eligibility
stipulates that each intern must
have a master's degree or better.
"The purpose of these
internships is to broaden the
interns' work experience and
thereby facilitate their transition
to future jobs needed by society,"
says the NSF announcement.
The foundation will pay half
each intern's salary up to $7,000.
The other half will come from the
federally-funded research
institution that employs him.
SLAC is funded by the U.S.
Atomic Energy Commission.

SLAC plans to employ four
physicists, two computer
programmers, and two engineers.
Applications are currently being
accepted by the SLAC
employment manager.
The NSF' announcement notes
that prospective interns

"temporarily engaged in work
outside of science and engineering
would be considered
unemployed." Preference will be
given to those in 14 areas of high
unemployment designated by the
Department of Labor, including
the San Jose region in which
SLAC is located.
