# Officer Worth Make Decision On Faculty Club Disruption
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
As the Campus Judicial Panel
hearings of Kwonping Ho closed,
Hearing Officer Leslie Minkus
announced he would "make no
recommendation" to the full CJP as to
Ho's guilt or innocence.
CJP rules state that the hearing
officer must make "a preliminary
recommendation as to whether or not
those facts constitute a violation of a
University regulation as charged."
Minkus claimed that one reason for
his decision was that even if "Mr. Ho
didn't assault anyone," the fact that
Ho was in the Faculty Club
unofficially could be construed as
violating the Fundamental Standard.
Ho is charged with assaulting
Faculty Club Executive Chef Arturo
Lionetti and forcibly entering the
kitchen "for the purpose of stealing
food" during the demonstration at the
Faculty Club on January 24.
Toward the end of last night's
hearings, the audience swelled to
about 50 people, many of whom
argued with Minkus for close to half
an hour. Minkus continually asserted
that he was going to "find the facts"
as he saw them. His findings will then

be presented to the full CJP at a later
date.
It was also learned last night that a
fifth student, sophomore Don Zweig,
has been charged with violation of the
Policy on Campus Disruption for the
November 4 "mill-in" at the
Placement Center. CJP hearings for
Don Lee, Steve Downey, Paul Loeb
and Pete Knutson were recently
concluded. CJP Chairman John Kaplan
is due to receive hearing officer Lillian
Altree's findings of fact in the earlier
case today.
Earlier last night, both the
prosecution and defense presented
their final arguments. Special Assistant
to the President John Schwartz, who
prosecuted the case, reiterated that his
three main witnesses testified that
they all saw Ho go into the kitchen
and all heard Ho encouraging others to
go into the kitchen.
In order to believe Ho, Schwartz
asserted, Minkus would have to find
that all three prosecution witnesses
were lying about both incidents.
Schwartz argued that if Minkus
believes that Ho entered the kitchen,
then he should also believe that Ho
stole food, since Ho's contradictory

testimony would be invalidated.
Defense counsel Jerry Peterson
claimed that all prosecution witnesses
would automatically assume that the
demonstrators wanted to enter the
kitchen and would not even consider
the possibility that the demonstrators
were looking for the back door.
As Peterson recounted that
Lionetti's and Faculty Club Manager
Forrest Tregea's versions of the alleged
assault were different, Minkus nodded
his head in recollection.
Peterson claimed that it would
hav been impossible for Ho to push
past Lionetti, steal break, move
through the crowded kitchen, and
arrive at the exit door within a period
of one minute, which was the time
estimated by KZSU news director Pete
Williams. Peterson also brought up
testimony which had identified
another Oriental, who may have been
mistaken for Ho, as having entered the
kitchen.
Co-counsel Zach Wasserman
claimed that in order to find that Ho
did in fact enter the kitchen, Minkus
"would have to disbelieve every
defense witness or ... have to believe
Kwonping Ho was Superman."
