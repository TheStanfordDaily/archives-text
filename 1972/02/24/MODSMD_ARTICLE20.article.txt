# Golfers Compete Saturday
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
It is now up to Tom Keelin,
Bruce Robertson, and Dave
Baskins to keep the San Francisco
City golf championship in
Stanford hands.
These three Indian hopefuls
survived first and second round
play last weekend and will return
to Harding Park Saturday for
third round matches.
Keelin will face 6'6" former
New 1 York Knicks basketball
player Mel Hutchins, Robertson
will play Ray Healy, and Baskins
will take on Ashley Smith, a 3 and
1 victor over Stanford's Conrad
Nilmeier last Sunday.
Defending champion Gary
Vanier was defeated by Mike
OToole in a first round match
last Saturday. In another opening

round upset, Baskins scored an
impressive 4 and 2 victory over
Sandy Galbraith, a former
Northern California Open
champion and runnprup in last
year's California Amateur.
"Dave is a tremendously
improved player," says Indian golf
coach Bud Finger. "He has played
some superb golf lately and is
certainly capable of winning the
City title. And of course Keelin
and Robertson have the ability to
win any tournament they enter."
Stanford has made its presence
felt throughout the tournament.
First Keelin and Robertson tied
for medalist honors in the 36 hole
qualifying with scores of 141.
And after Saturday's first round
matches, five of the 32 surviving
golfers were Stanford students

and three more were alumni.
Keelin had to work the hardest
to advance to the third round.
After hitting his second shot out
of bounds on the 18th hold
Sunday, the Stanford captain was
faced with a 45 foot putt to win
the match. He confidently stroked
the ball into the cup to earn a 1
up victory.
Since Keelin and Robertson are
in the upper bracket and Baskins
is in the lower half, an all
Stanford final is possible. But first
each Indian player must defeat
three more match play opponents.
The winners of tomorrow's
third round matches will advance
to the quarterfinals on Sunday. 36
hole semifinal and final matches
are scheduled for next weekend.
