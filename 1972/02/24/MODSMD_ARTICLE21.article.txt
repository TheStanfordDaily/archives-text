This Saturday night, the
Stanford gymnastics team
entertains the Berkeley
gymnastics team, which has won
Pacific-8 championships in the
sport since time immemorial.
Stanford finally has a gymnastics
team to rival the Bears, and they
are going all out to assure a
capacity crowd for Big Flip (or
Big Tumble, or whatever they call
Big Game in gymastics).
There are posters on the
campus kiosks, and an
advertisement in the Special
Notices section of the Daily
("Don't miss Stanford's unbeaten
Gymnastics Team") right above
an announcement about what to
do if you've got classroom
discussion problems. One gymnast
even told me that if 4,000 people
show up for this, coach Dan
Millman will do a triple flip on the
trampoline in a special exhibition

that he does every meet.
Now I've never seen a triple
flip on the trampoline, and since 1
get paid by the Daily, I greatly
appreciate the gymnastics team
spending some of their money on
an advertisement; so I've been
trying to help Millman and
everybody down at the Old
Pavilion to drum up some extra
business for this Saturday evening.
Tomorrow morning, a
specially-equipped jet fighter will
be taking off from Moffit Field:
as it circles the Stanford campus,
a special rings apparatus will be
lowered from the right wing, and
sophomore gymnast Howard
Bessen will attempt the first Iron
Cross ever made at 6,000 ft., 200
mph.
Also scheduled for tomorrow is
Steve Hug's side-horse routine
from the top of Hoover Tower —
his injured ankle permitting. Hug
will perform his "plummet
dismount" said to be worth at
least three points for "aesthetic
mastery."
Gymnast Shawn Skerrett will
be vaulting the claw in White
Plaza throughout this week, where
teammate Bob Anderson will

perform his free ex routine, rallies
and sound equipment permitting.
Placement Center pickets have
promised to serve as ushers and
Navy recruiters will terminate
interviews at 12 noon to judge the
performances. Hector Neff is
scheduled for a half-time
performance on the parallel bars
during today's session of
"Human Sexuality".
As for Millman, he will be
riding in the fourth tuba from the
right as the Stanford Band
marches across the campus Friday
afternoon; the tambourine players
have rigged up a special netting on
which Millman will perform a
special routine, if asked.
Saturday morning the entire
team will perform in a finale
scheduled for the Annenberg
Auditorium, Nathan Cummings
Art Building; Millman will lecture
on "Gymnastics As An Art
Form", slides will be shown,
refreshments will be served, and
the chalk box will be raffled off.
So far I've talked my sister into
flying up here for the meet, so
that means only 3998 tickets to
go. Sorry, Dan — 3999; I get in
free on my press pass.
