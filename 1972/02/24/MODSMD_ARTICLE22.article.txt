Berrigan Trial Continues
HARRISBURG, Pa. — A Roman Catholic nun testified
yesterday she served as a mail cover for Sister Elizabeth
McAllister during the summer of 1970 — when the
government says a conspiracy to kidnap presidential aide
Henry Kissinger was hatched.
Sister Judith Savard testified at the federal conspiracy
trial of Sister McAllister and six codefendants, including
the Rev. Philip Berrigan.
"I said, 'yes, I would," the bespectacled 32-year-old
witness continued. "She said I'd recognize the letters by
the Lewisburg postmark."
At the time, Berrigan was incarcerated in the federal
prison at Lewisburg, Pa. The government claims he
received mail there from Sister McAllister, including a
letter outlining the alleged kidnap plot, and seeking his
i pproval by return mail.
Sister Savard took the witness stand after four other
key government witnesses had taken the Fifth
Amendment.
Demos Set Debate
MANCHESTER, N.H. — Representatives of the five
Democrats in the New Hampshire presidential primary
agreed last night to a televised debate by the candidates
March 5, two days before the voting.
The agreement on a date, time and format for the
debate came after sVfe hours of discussion here.
The debate will be televised live on the state's
educational network. The candidates will speak for four
minutes each and then submit to questions from four
newsmen.
Democrats on the ballot in the primary, the nation's
first, are Sens. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine, George
McGovern of South Dakota and Vance Hartke of Indiana;
Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty, and Edward Coll, a
Hartford, Conn., social worker.
Pro-Death Penalty Campaign
SACRAMENTO — An initiative petition drive to reinstate
the death penalty for California was launched yesterday
by a prison guard group which said a "bloodbath" could
result in the prisons without capital punishment.
Meanwhile, State Senator H.L. Richardson
(R-Arcadia), said a drive to impeach the six justices who
voted to void the death penalty was "in the discussion
stage."
The goal of the campaigns is to overturn the State
Supreme Court decision of last week that held the death
penalty violates the California Constitution.
The petition drive was started by the California
Correctional Officers Association, a 3,000-member group
of state prison and youth institution guards and
employees.
A total of 520,806 signatures of registered voters is
needed to place the issue on the ballot for a vote of the
people as a proposed constitutional amendment.

Group publicist Ken Brown said the proposed
amendment would restore the death penalty in the form it
was in until the Supreme Court ruling, applying in seven
capital crimes. It also would eliminate the section of the
State Constitution which banned "cruel and unusual
punishment."
That was the chief point on which the court held the
death penalty was unconstitutional.
13 Enter California Primary
SACRAMENTO — Thirteen candidates filed notices
yesterday that they plan to enter California's June 6
presidential primary.
The list included nine Democrats, three Republicans,
and Dr. Benjamin Spock, the famed antiwar pediatrician,
being entered by the Peace and Freedom party.
In addition, leaders of California's American
Independent party served notice they plan to enter an
unpledged slate in the primary.
All candidates now have until March 24 to actually
make the ballot, by filing nominating petitions with the
required number of signatures: 14,694 for Democrats and
17,199 for Republicans.
Sen. George McGovern's presidential campaign suffered
a "morning-after" hangup earlier in trying to win the No.
1 spot on the Democratic primary ballot by submitting its
petitions first.
"About half our people just didn't hustle and deliver
the petitions yesterday morning," according to a
McGovern campaign spokesman in Los Angeles.
Indications were that McGovern would still get top
billing, but it may take several days to land the spot
officially.
The nine Democratic candidates are Sens. Edmund
Muskie of Maine, Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota,
Vance Hartke of Indiana, George McGovern of South
Dakota and Henry Jackson of Washington; former Sen.
Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota; Mayors John V. Lindsay
of New York and Sam Yorty of Los Angeles; and Rep.
Shirley Chisholm of New York.
The Republicans are Nixon, and Reps. John Ashbrook
of Ohio and Paul N. McCloskey of California.
Kurzweil Reinstated at SJS
SAN FRANCISCO — A federal judge ordered yesterday
that Jack Kurzweil, husband of Communist Party member
Bettina Aptheker, be reinstated to his engineering
teaching post at San Jose State College.
U.S. District Court Judge Alphonso J. Zirpoli filed a
terse permanent injunction here affirming an August
preliminary order halting Kurzweil's ouster.
"It is reasonable to conclude that Kurzweil was
punished for his political beliefs and was therefore denied
rights protected by the First Amendment," Zirpoli said.
In his August order, Zirpoli said there was no evidence
in state college proceedings that Kurzweil had injected
political beliefs in his teaching as an assistant professor of
electrical engineering.
