# Nixon-Chou Talks Spur Scholar Exchange Rumors

PEKING (AP) — President Nixon,
another long session with Premier
Chou En-lai behind him, stood atop
the Great Wall of China this morning
and said: "It's unbelievable."
There were indications at
yesterday's four-hour talks that Nixon
and Chou may have laid the
groundwork for exchanges of students,
scholars, newsmen, and cultural
groups.
Before the opening of the meeting
yesterday the second four-hour session
in as many days — Chou indicated
some American correspondents could
stay on for a longer look at China after
Nixon leaves next week.
Last night, the Nixons attended a
sports show at a Peking arena. They

saw gymnastics, badminton, and
ping-pong exhibitions. The crowd of
18,000 applauded the President as he
entered.
Yesterday the People's Daily,
Peking's official newspaper, gave the
President's visit extensive coverage,
and the entire edition was quickly sold
out.
The Nixons left for the Wall, 40
miles northwest of Peking, early this
morning, and afterward viewed the
tombs of the Chinese emperors
nearby.
Another gesture regarded as
friendly was the fact that yesterday's
meeting between Nixon and Chou was
held at the guest house where the
Nixon are staying. The two previous

sessions had been held in the Great
Hall of the People.
Again the atmosphere was friendly.
Nixon and Chou laughed and joked.
"How are you all?" Chou asked the
American correspondents.
"They're better than they deserve,"
the President interjected.
No word of what is under
discussion has come from behind the
closed doors. But it seemed certain
they were covering ideas for cultural
and scientific exchanges, a Nixon goal,
and perhaps had discussed Vietnam.
No one expects the Chinese to
agree to Nixon's peace plan for
Indochina. Chou made clear before the
President arrived in China that the
plan was unacceptable.
