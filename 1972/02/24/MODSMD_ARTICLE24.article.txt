# Lyman Gets Yurok Petition On Indian Mascot Question
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
President Lyman yesterday received
petitions bearing the signatures of 107
members of the Klamath River-Yurok
Indian Tribe urging that the Indian be
retained as Stanford's mascot. H.D.
"Timm" Williams, also known as
Prince Lightfoot, serves as
"attorney-in-fact" for the 3,400
member tribe.
The request came in response to a
petition signed by 55 native American
students which urged "that the use of
the Indian symbol be permanently
discontinued." Ombudsman Lois
Amsterdam has also recommended to
Lyman "that any and all Stanford
University use of the Indian symbol
should be immediately disavowed and
permanently stopped."

Specifically, the Yurok's petitions
read as follows: "We, as Indians, are
disturbed to learn that certain pressure
tactics are being exerted to cause the
traditional 'Indian' name to be
dis-identified with Stanford
University.
"The overwhelming majority of our
American Indians are proud of our
traditional identification with
Stanford University and the cherished
historical symbolism of the 'Stanford
Indian'.
"Therefore, we the undersigned, all
of Indian descent, do sincerely
petition, that: 'The Stanford Indian'
be preserved and maintained to
continue to express the pride we feel
as a race and the pride we feel to be

identified with Stanford University."
Attached with the petitions from
the Yuroks was a letter to Lyman from
Dorothy Haberman, the Secretary -
Treasurer for the Tribe. She said in her
letter that "1 have been besieged with
telephone calls and requests from
Indian people to prepare a 'petition'
for circulation among people of Indian
descent for the purpose of keeping the
'Stanford Indian' as a symbol.
Petitions started circulating Feb. 11.
Some are in and are attached to this
letter."
Haberman's letter continues that
"if the students were insulted or
incensed by the word 'Indian' that the
solution perhaps could be handled by
changing schools rather than changing
the Stanford symbol."
She also stated that "to abolish the
'Stanford Indian' without regard to
the past or the future is viewed by
many of us as a 'selfish act' designed
only to please themselves [Stanford's
native Americans] because
somewhere in their makeup they are
evidently ashamed of their beautiful
Indian blood to the point that the
word 'Indian' incenses them when it
reminds them of what they are."
Haberman concluded her letter
saying "we feel, as Indians, we are
being crucified by our very own and
will end with a prayer, 'Forgive them,
oh Lord, for they know not what they
do!"
