# Frat Rush Week Set
## 
### 
With a renewed focus on
integration into the University
community, Stanford's fourteen
fraternities begin their annual spring
rush this week with Open House night
scheduled for tonight.
"Fraternity emphasis used to be on
separateness," said Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC) rush chairman Denny
Colvin, "but the houses here realized
long ago that most Stanford people's
concerns were far more broadly based
than in 'traditional' fraternity
activities."

Two hundred seventy-five men
went through the rush last spring and
some 250 eventually pledged at one of
the fraternities.
The fraternities have made
arrangements with the University for a
meal exchange program whereby a
freshman (or upperclassman) can
exchange his meal card at his dorm
food service for a meal ticket good at
any fraternity for either lunch or
dinner. The fraternities can then use
the tickets for meals in the dorms.
Open houses for Group II will run
from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. tonight.
