# 70 Workers Meet In Bishop To Hear Teamsters' Platform
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
About 70 Stanford workers listened
to Teamster organizer Rudy Tham
explain his union's position on
everything from time clocks to office
tyrants last night at Bishop
Auditorium.
It was the first large-scale Teamster
meeting in the campaign to unionize
1600 University employees, and it
drew a crowd twice as large as a similar
rally two weeks ago sponsored by
another union, the California School
Employees Association-Stanford
Employees Association (CSEA-SEA).
That meeting featured shouting and
shoving matches between Teamsters,
members of CSEA-SEA, and members
of United Stanford Employees (USE)
but there were no such incidents last
night.
The generally well-behaved
audience — which included about half
a dozen members of Venceremos —
questioned Tham on a number of
subjects relating to the March 7
election.
The Teamsters held an
"informational meeting" with each
other on Tuesday night.
"Psychologically your employer,
Stanford University, fears our union,"
Tham told the workers, "because they
know that everything delivered to this
University is driven by a Teamster."
One employee asked Tham: "The

University has a lot of trucks. What's
to prevent them from piling someone in
the trucks and driving right in [across
a Teamster picket line ] ?"
"Who is going to drive the gas truck
that comes in here?" Tham retorted.
"I don't see how CSEA can come in
here for three and a half dollars,"
Tham replied to a question about
union dues. Teamster dues are $7.
"It's the same as going shopping for a
$50 suit or a $100 suit. The $100 suit
is going to wear longer," he said.

He also refused to take a stand
against the campus disruption policy
("We'll deal with it when it comes
up") or in favor of guaranteed
admissions to the University for
children of employees.
He repeated the Teamster position
that all contracts must include
provisions for a closed shop.
USE will meet in Tresidder 275
tonight to consider the issue of closed
shop - open shop. The meeting is open
to all Stanford workers.
