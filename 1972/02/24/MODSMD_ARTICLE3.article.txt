# At SWOPSI Symposium
## Banker Discusses Future Of Asia 
### BOB VINING JANE BUSSEY 
Disagreement between a senior vice
president of the Bank of America and
his fellow panelists highlighted last
night's session of the
SWOPSI-sponsored Symposium on
Imperialism.
Louis Mulkern, senior vice
president in the Bank of America's
Asia Division, joined Stanford
economist John Gurley, Stanford
Professor of History Lyman Van
Slyke, and three other panelists in a

discussion of "China, Japan, and the
U.S."
"If China is to modernize and play
the political role she is entitled to,"
declared Mulkern, "she must draw on
Western savings."
He termed this "the shortest, most
inexpensive way" of obtaining a
modernization concerned with
"development of power resources,
transportation, and communication."
Robert Gomperts, member of the
California Council of International
Trade and the Committee for a New
China Policy, said that China would
not accept a U.S. offer of aid. "On our
basis of rationality, the Chinese mode
of development seems irrational. But
by their basis of rationality, it is
rational," Gomperts stated.
Mulkern, agreeing with other
panelists, said "China will not go the
route of developing a consumer
economy like Western nations."
Gomperts also asserted that the
Chinese would not put any pressure on
the Vietnamese to settle the Vietnam
War.
Professor of Economics John

Gurley said that President Nixon is
seeking to establish a safer area in Asia
for activities of U.S. corporations.
Other panelists included James
Peck of the Bay Area Institute, and
Peter Bell, an economist at the City
University of New York.
Approximately 375 persons attended
the discussion held at Cubberly
Auditorium.
Earlier in the day, the Symposium
moved into the medium of theater to

place imperialism into the context of
the war in Vietnam. Some 250 persons
took advantage of the lunch hour and
the sun to attend "Discourse ... on
Vietnam," performed by the Political
Theater Group.
The play, with a 10-member cast,
was staged "in the open" under the
direction of David Cole, a graduate
student in drama. Using the fountain
as a backdrop, the performers
presented 30 minutes of dialogue and
action in the style of guerilla theater.
