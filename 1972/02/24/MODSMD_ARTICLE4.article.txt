# Augsberger Offers Challenge In Downtown Palo Alto Talk
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
Robert R. Augsburger, Stanford's
Vice President for Business and
Finance, addressed Downtown Palo
Alto, Inc., yesterday with a message of
"understanding, reconciliation, and
challenge" on campus-city relations.
He defended Stanford's land
development policies, particularly
those regarding low- and
moderate-income housing, and
suggested that Palo Alto has been
"quite remiss" in its lack of efforts to
alleviate the housing shortage.
"To those who fear that the

University has plans immediately to
develop all its lands," Augsburger said
that "such certainty is not the case."
"I can assure you that Stanford
does care about Palo Alto," he told
the businessmen's group. "Does Palo
Alto care about Stanford? With
enlightened leadership coming from
this group, I think you can take pride
in being next door" to Stanford.
Unique Combination
He said that Palo Alto and Stanford
"jointly have the ability to offer a
unique combination of urban,
suburban, and rural environments to

the people who live and work in this
area."
To this end, he outlined six
principles which he suggested ought to
govern planning to meet those
problems, including:
"We must allow people to make
money. Profit is a vital incentive."
"Redevelopment or new
development planning should provide
economic balance to the city and to
the landowner."
"We must provide options to
people so they can determine their
own style of life consistent with their
personal economic and social needs
and circumstances."
Addressing the housing question
"not from the point of view of the
social do-gooder but from that of the
businessman," Augsburger questioned
the "responsibility" of large-scale
low-income housing developments in
the Stanford foothills. "Does it make
sense," Augsburger asked, "to locate
housing in the foothills when schools
are closing in Palo Alto for lack of
students?"
"Or would it be more responsible
to use some of that property in a
productive manner to help create the
revenues needed to support housing in
areas where services already are

available?"
He cited Stanford's construction of
new faculty and student housing in
recent years as a move which "has
helped to ease the problem."
Palo Alto, possessed of a large tax
base due in part to industrial and
commercial development of Stanford
lands, "has been quite remiss" in
providing housing, he said.
Augsburger said that "if society
values open space, it must find
reasonable and equitable ways to
acquire or set it aside ... The people
in an area cannot, in all fairness,
expect the private landowner to hold
unproductive property indefinitely, to
pay taxes, and to absorb the costs for
them."

acquire or set it aside ... The people
in an area cannot, in all fairness,
expect the private landowner to hold
unproductive property indefinitely, to
pay taxes, and to absorb the costs for
them."
Robert R. Augsburger, Stanford's
Vice President for Business and
Finance, addressed Downtown Palo
Alto, Inc., yesterday with a message of
"understanding, reconciliation, and
challenge" on campus-city relations.
He defended Stanford's land
development policies, particularly
those regarding low- and
moderate-income housing, and
suggested that Palo Alto has been
"quite remiss" in its lack of efforts to
alleviate the housing shortage.
"To those who fear that the

University has plans immediately to
develop all its lands," Augsburger said
that "such certainty is not the case."
"I can assure you that Stanford
does care about Palo Alto," he told
the businessmen's group. "Does Palo
Alto care about Stanford? With
enlightened leadership coming from
this group, I think you can take pride
in being next door" to Stanford.
Unique Combination
He said that Palo Alto and Stanford
"jointly have the ability to offer a
unique combination of urban,
suburban, and rural environments to

the people who live and work in this
area."
To this end, he outlined six
principles which he suggested ought to
govern planning to meet those
problems, including:
"We must allow people to make
money. Profit is a vital incentive."
"Redevelopment or new
development planning should provide
economic balance to the city and to
the landowner."
"We must provide options to
people so they can determine their
own style of life consistent with their
personal economic and social needs
and circumstances."
Addressing the housing question
"not from the point of view of the
social do-gooder but from that of the
businessman," Augsburger questioned
the "responsibility" of large-scale
low-income housing developments in
the Stanford foothills. "Does it make
sense," Augsburger asked, "to locate
housing in the foothills when schools
are closing in Palo Alto for lack of
students?"
"Or would it be more responsible
to use some of that property in a
productive manner to help create the
revenues needed to support housing in
areas where services already are

available?"
He cited Stanford's construction of
new faculty and student housing in
recent years as a move which "has
helped to ease the problem."
Palo Alto, possessed of a large tax
base due in part to industrial and
commercial development of Stanford
lands, "has been quite remiss" in
providing housing, he said.
Augsburger said that "if society
values open space, it must find
reasonable and equitable ways to
acquire or set it aside ... The people
in an area cannot, in all fairness,
expect the private landowner to hold
unproductive property indefinitely, to
pay taxes, and to absorb the costs for
them."
