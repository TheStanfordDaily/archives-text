# Advance Registration Begins, Hall Pleased With New System
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
Class cards and registration packets may soon be
collectors' items rather than common sights.
Advance registration procedure has caused the
demise of these familiar items and Registrar Harvey
Hall is pleased with the results.
Yesterday, graduate students, juniors, and seniors
officially began advance registration at the Old
Union. "It's going just great," Hall commented, as
he scampered in and out of his office to check the
operation of the new system.
"Today, we're fairly busy and there's no big
build up of lines." Hall stated that advanced
registration has been implemented for one major
reason. "Our primary motivation is to make the
registration process more convenient for students.
This advance registration is only a step to
registration by mail."
Storage
Hall also explained other reasons for the
introduction of advance registration. "We have
eliminated the repetition of information by asking
for it only once and then storing it in a computer,"
he stated. "We have also eliminated the need for
80,000 computer class cards to be manufactured
each quarter."
The new advance registration procedure allows
free fee deferments until registration day. Most
students with scholarships must wait until
registration day to receive their money; however,

some grants are currently being issued to graduate
students.
According to Hall, there will always be a
registration day because students should not be
forced to conform to the new procedure, but
eventually "the number of students will be reduced
to the point where we can operate totally in our
own shop," namely the Old Union.
Due to the recent remodeling of the cashier's
office, complete registration can now be
accomplished in that building. There are now five
windows in the office, which enable students to pay
bills to the cashier, sign class lists and complete the
"final step" within a short period of time.
Hall predicted, "In the fall of 1973, we will be
down to a one-day registration and, if everything
goes right, by Winter and Spring, registration will
take place entirely in the Old Union."
Old Returners
One important procedural matter associated with
the new system applies to old returning students
who have not been in school during the previous
quarter; they cannot advance register.
Another result of advance registration will be the
mailing of report cards, which will no longer be
distributed with reg. packets. Hall stated, "Our
present plan is to send them to the residences of
students living on campus, where they can be
distributed, and mail them to students who don't
live on campus. At the end of Spring Quarter, we
will send all of them to the students' home

addresses." Confirmations of Registration,
confirming the fact that students have registered
and informing them of their classes, will be sent
separately.
Students will need to provide less information,
but will still be asked to write legibly and pay
particular attention when filling out department
codes on study lists. "If you're not careful,"
emphasized Hall, "you'll end up basket weaving
rather than taking English."
Reaction
Reaction to the new system was generally
favorable yesterday. Kathy Drew, who words at one
of the windows at the Old Union, stated, "This is
the first time I've worked here during registration so
I really can't compare it to past registration, but
there are no major problems with the system."
One junior commented, "Administrative changes
usually go to save money, but I think the people
behind this one have their hearts in the right place."
A senior said, "This is a good idea. It's a little
confusing but it won't be after everyone has done
it."
Hall expects more freshmen and sophomore
students to advance register, but he doesn't
anticipate any crucial problems. "We expect this
procedure to get progressively easier," he explained.
"After the first two or three times, it should be like
driving a car — just a matter of mechanics with a
minimal amount of thinking."

a member of the first group to participate in the new advance registration
program yesterday.
Class cards and registration packets may soon be
collectors' items rather than common sights.
Advance registration procedure has caused the
demise of these familiar items and Registrar Harvey
Hall is pleased with the results.
Yesterday, graduate students, juniors, and seniors
officially began advance registration at the Old
Union. "It's going just great," Hall commented, as
he scampered in and out of his office to check the
operation of the new system.
"Today, we're fairly busy and there's no big
build up of lines." Hall stated that advanced
registration has been implemented for one major
reason. "Our primary motivation is to make the
registration process more convenient for students.
This advance registration is only a step to
registration by mail."
Storage
Hall also explained other reasons for the
introduction of advance registration. "We have
eliminated the repetition of information by asking
for it only once and then storing it in a computer,"
he stated. "We have also eliminated the need for
80,000 computer class cards to be manufactured
each quarter."
The new advance registration procedure allows
free fee deferments until registration day. Most
students with scholarships must wait until
registration day to receive their money; however,

some grants are currently being issued to graduate
students.
According to Hall, there will always be a
registration day because students should not be
forced to conform to the new procedure, but
eventually "the number of students will be reduced
to the point where we can operate totally in our
own shop," namely the Old Union.
Due to the recent remodeling of the cashier's
office, complete registration can now be
accomplished in that building. There are now five
windows in the office, which enable students to pay
bills to the cashier, sign class lists and complete the
"final step" within a short period of time.
Hall predicted, "In the fall of 1973, we will be
down to a one-day registration and, if everything
goes right, by Winter and Spring, registration will
take place entirely in the Old Union."
Old Returners
One important procedural matter associated with
the new system applies to old returning students
who have not been in school during the previous
quarter; they cannot advance register.
Another result of advance registration will be the
mailing of report cards, which will no longer be
distributed with reg. packets. Hall stated, "Our
present plan is to send them to the residences of
students living on campus, where they can be
distributed, and mail them to students who don't
live on campus. At the end of Spring Quarter, we
will send all of them to the students' home

addresses." Confirmations of Registration,
confirming the fact that students have registered
and informing them of their classes, will be sent
separately.
Students will need to provide less information,
but will still be asked to write legibly and pay
particular attention when filling out department
codes on study lists. "If you're not careful,"
emphasized Hall, "you'll end up basket weaving
rather than taking English."
Reaction
Reaction to the new system was generally
favorable yesterday. Kathy Drew, who words at one
of the windows at the Old Union, stated, "This is
the first time I've worked here during registration so
I really can't compare it to past registration, but
there are no major problems with the system."
One junior commented, "Administrative changes
usually go to save money, but I think the people
behind this one have their hearts in the right place."
A senior said, "This is a good idea. It's a little
confusing but it won't be after everyone has done
it."
Hall expects more freshmen and sophomore
students to advance register, but he doesn't
anticipate any crucial problems. "We expect this
procedure to get progressively easier," he explained.
"After the first two or three times, it should be like
driving a car — just a matter of mechanics with a
minimal amount of thinking."
