## Important Induction Case Proceeding 
### 
Juan farinas defense committee

"I am being railroaded to
Federal prison for two years for
the sole 'crime' of opposing and
speaking out against the
imperialist war in Vietnam. The
government's case against me was
based not only on my opposition
to the war but also on the racist
and anti-immigrant prejudice
which it is now trying more and
more openly to stir up in order to
attack the entire working class."
This was the opening statement
of Juan Farinas at a press
conference held Dec. 4 at the
convention of the National Peace
Action Coalition. Farinas is a
young Cuban-born worker, and a
supporter of the Workers League.
On November 28, 1971, the
attorneys for Farinas submitted a
petition for a writ of certiorari in
the U.S. Supreme Court. If the
Court grants this petition, it will
review the judgment of the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit, which upheld the lower
court conviction of Farinas for
violation of the Selective Service
Act. A decision on whether it will
review the case is expected by late
winter or early spring.
This case represents the first
reported prosecution for failure to
obey the orders of Armed Forces
personnel in an induction center.
Farinas' Statement
The conclusion of Farinas'
statement to the press follows:
"In August of 1968 I reported
for induction into the Army and
attempted to exercise my right to
oppose the war inside the
induction center. I attempted to
distribute leaflets which
denounced the war as part of the
war against the working class all
over the world.
"In response to this the
government constructed the most
vicious charges. Because it knew

how flimsy and politically
motivated a simple charge of
refusal to obey the orders of the
Army personnel would look, it
added to that charge the charges
of hindering and interfering with
the Selective Service System and
refusal to report and submit for
induction. On any of these
charges I could have faced five
years in jail. The government
threw them all in together in an
effort to make its case appear to
have some substance.
"The prosecution's case was
shot through with contradictions.
"An Army intelligence agent,
refreshing his memory from a
typewritten report, claimed that I
had said I would refuse induction.
I challenged this in my own
testimony, in which I emphasized
that I had always stated I would
fight for my views inside the
army.
Directed Verdict
"At the trial the judge had
practically directed a verdict of
guilty by instructing the jury that
all that had to be proven was that
I had not obeyed certain orders in
the induction center. The
government was thus relieved of
the obligation of proving that
disruption had taken place.
"On September 28 of this year
the Court of Appeals upheld this
blatant political attack on my
rights. This was a clear example of
the double standards of
courtroom justice in the US.
Workers and opponents of the
capitalist system get one standard,
the ruling class and those who do
its bidding get another.
"The upholding of my
conviction followed the Attica
massacre by only a few weeks.
The government authorities have
unlimited license to kill both at
home and abroad while workers,
socialists, opponents of the war
have their rights squashed.
"The trials following the
notorious Mylai massacre are
another important example. In
that case, in which Lieutenant
Calley admitted slaughtering
defenseless women and children,
the President of the United States
himself released Calley from the
stockade after his conviction and
openly pressed for drastic
reduction of sentence on review.
"Yet I face two years in jail
simply for pointing our these mass
murders in Vietnam, long before
the government was forced to
admit that Mylai had taken place.

I called for a struggle against the
system which caused these
murders and is causing them right
now. In the eyes of Nixon and the
entire ruling class I, and not
Calley, am the criminal.
Real Issue Diversion
"Nixon and his government are
trying to whip up racism and
chauvinism to divert workers
away from the real issues. This is
behind the recent scare stories on
the 'illegal aliens' who are
allegedly taking jobs away from
unemployed American workers.
"This chauvinist and racist
scare against 'aliens' was brought
directly into my case by the
government prosecutor himself.
"At my sentencing in January,
1971, Truebner said, 'Briefly,
your Honor, we have here a
Cuban national who has been in
this country for approximately
ten years and as I understand it
has an application for citizenship
pending ... I think it is fair to say
that society has conferred these
benefits upon him, ... in the
expectation that he would be a
good citizen,... and yet when
the time came he spurned those
obligations. He literally bit the
hand that fed him."
"Truebner also recommended
that bail be denied because 'We
feel we have a Spanish-speaking
individual who could easily
disappear to any part of this
country.'
"And yet the prosecution had
the nerve to insist that this was
not a political case!
"I am here not only to raise
the issues of my conviction and
appeal, but to continue the fight
to turn the struggle against the
war in Indochina towards the only
force which can stop it â€” the
working class.
'This is all the more urgent in
the light of Nixon's August 15
announcements. The war on the
working class has been openly
declared, the labor movement,
fighting against Nixon's attacks,
must take up the fight against the
war, against political repression,
for a labor party to break with the
parties of the bosses.
"My case is among the more
recent in a long list of attacks on
the working class and socialist
movements. From the Palmer
Raids and the Sacco-Vanzetti
case, to the Smith Act frameup of
the American Trotskyists in
Minneapolis, to the Smith Act
trials of the Cold War, the killing

of George Jackson and the case of
Angela Davis today, capitalism has
struck out against its opponents.
"We can defeat these attacks
today! It is not simply history
repeating itself. But we can only
defeat them if we base ourselves
on the lessons of past struggles.
"I am proud to say that from
the beginning of my case I have
sought to fight in the traditions of
these past struggles, and against
any attempt to limit this fight and
to destroy its political content.
This prosecution, along with all
the others I have mentioned, is an
attack upon the entire working
class, and it must be fought as
such.
War Inside and Outside
"I stand by the statement I
made at my trial: There's a war
going on outside, and in this
courtroom as well. I take sides in
this war, with the auto workers,
the rail workers, the postal
workers, and all those fighting the
bosses.'
"No section of the working
class can win if it is isolated from
the struggles of the class as a
whole. None can win without a
political struggle against the
capitalist system. This is true for
the fight against#the war, the
struggle in the prisons and my
struggle to stay out of prison in
the first place. Through a political
struggle against this decaying
imperialist system we can beat
back all these attacks and put an
end to them for good."
The Juan Farinas Defense
Committee wants to emphasize in
particular the two year sentence
facing Farinas simply for trying to
distribute a leaflet. In spite of
Nixon's efforts to pack the
Supreme Court with extreme right
wingers we must mobilize the
greatest support possible,
especially from the unions and the
youth. We must make it as hard as
possible for the Supreme Court to
avoid the political and
constitutional issues raised by this
case.
The Defense Committee
therefore urges most strongly that
all supporters of Juan Farinas do
their utmost to spread the word
about this case as widely as
possible, to gain as much publicity
as possible for it, and to send
contributions to defray the costs
of the defense campaign.
