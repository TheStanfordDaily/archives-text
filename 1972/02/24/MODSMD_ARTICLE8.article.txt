## Franklin Issues Far From Narrow 
### 
konrad krauskopf

In a letter a few days ago, Dan
Brenner castigates members of the
Earth Sciences faculty for
expressing what he considers a
dangerous opinion on the case of
Professor Franklin early last
December. Much as I dislike
prolonging an argument that has
grown wearisome, I think Mr.
Brenner's letter deserves an
answer.
Mr. Brenner's quarrel is with an
expression of hope in the Earth
Sciences letter that the Advisory
Board would "look beyond the
details of specific actions and
consider the case in a broader
context." He interprets this as an
invitation to the Board "to toss
out the weeks of painstaking
testimony and argument... in
short, to dump due process and
expedite the decision." If the
Earth Sciences letter gave this
impression, it was carelessly
worded and apologies are in order.

Certainly no such meaning was
intended.
The hope was only that the
Board would not limit itself
entirely to the painstaking
testimony and argument, but
would put the case in the
historical context of the past
three or four years. Nothing was
expressed or intended about
tossing out the carefully
accumulated details with which
the Board was wrestling, and
certainly nothing about by-passing
due process. All the signers of the
Earth Sciences letter, I am sure,
share my profound admiration for
the extreme care with which the
Board set about its enormous but
very necessary task of sifting the
complicated evidence from six
weeks of hearings.
Perhaps Mr. Brenner would still
feel it wrong to suggest that the
Board should consider anything
beyond the actual words they

heard in the Physics lecture room
during those long six weeks. If he
does, I am sure he would be
joined by the authors of many
recently published letters. It is a
point on which reasonable men
can disagree, and I think it needs
further exploring.
Narrow Question
To maintain that the case rests
solely on the narrow question of
violation of civil law regarding
freedom of speech is to say, in
general, that a university can
enforce no rules of behavior more
restrictive than the laws of the
state. The Advisory Board, if I
read its opinion correctly, set out
to decide whether civil law had
indeed been violated. The extreme
difficulty of such a decision on
questions of free speech is evident
in many bitterly contested court
cases over the years, and the
Advisory Board faced the same
difficulties as have the civil courts.
Professor Franklin could be
counted on to have been
circumspect about straying over
the fuzzy line that in a civil action
would divide legal from illegal
behavior. The majority of the
Board decided that the line had
been crossed, but the difficulty of
the decision is manifest in the
divided vote and the emotional
recriminations that still rack the
campus.
But is this the whole sum and
substance of the case? It is
important, certainly. Free speech
is as close to an absolute right as
any we have, and the safeguards
provided by the Constitution and
by court decisions must be
maintained to protect this right.
But the Franklin case, it seems to
me, involved other issues as well.
The issues are embodied in the
Advisory Board's eloquent
discussion of the "web of
unwritten rules of Faculty
conduct" that are necessary in a
university community.
A university is an institution
that is part of society, but that is
set up for a special function; to
carry out this function it must
have rules of its own that go
beyond society's laws. Because a
university encourages divergent
opinion the rules must be
minimal, but without the
minimum the institution cannot
survive.
It cannot survive because it is
too weak. The traditional rules of
academic behavior are so
ingrained, so widely accepted,

that the university has never had
need of a defensive mechanism.
When an activist deliberately
flouts its rules and then claims
that he is accountable only to the
laws of the state, the university
has no recourse but to call on the
state for protection — and this it
does only with the greatest
reluctance, only when extensive
damage has already been done.
The university is in a position of
peculiar vulnerability, in that it
must welcome to its ranks those
who advocate its destruction, and
then must depend on outside
force when advocacy results in
action.
Destroy Stanford
That Professor Franklin seeks
to destroy Stanford I think is
abundantly clear from his
speeches and writings. He would
call it by another name,
"reorganization" rather than
"destruction" — but the
reorganization he contemplates is
so profound that to most of us it
would be equivalent to
destruction.
A democratic state also must
harbor those who would destroy
it, but the state has means of
protecting itself when words lead
to deeds. Suppose, for example,
that the events which the
Advisory Board examined had
taken place on a public street in
San Jose rather than on the
campus. Police would have been
on hand as soon as the crowd
grew noisy, and would certainly
have prevented the invasion of the
computer facility of a private
company.
Laws about trespassing,
disturbing the peace, or creating a
public nuisance would have kept
the crowd's and the speakers'
activities within reasonable
bounds. Free speech and
incitement might have become
issues, and would properly have
been handled within the strict
guidelines of the law, but more
probably any resulting court cases
would have centered on actions
rather than speech. My point is
just that outside communities
have a mechanism already set up
for controlling protest activities —
a mechanism that does not always
work, but that ideally permits
vociferous protest while
preventing damage to society.
No Such Mechanism
A university has no such
mechanism, and most of the time
we are glad that it does not. But

because of this lack the university
must expect to suffer considerable
damage whenever activity probes
the boundary between legal and
illegal behavior — physical
damage, psychological damage to
relations with alumni and the
surrounding community, damage in
danger to life and limb, damage in
loss of faculty and student time.
Occasional disturbance of this sort
is a normal part of university life,
and we should welcome it for
jolting us out of accustomed ruts.
But when the damage becomes
recurrent over a period of years,
when it will evidently continue
for an indefinite future, then the
university must look to its
survival. And its survival, it seems
to me, will depend on dealing
with transgressions against the
traditional code of academic
behavior as well as against the civil
law.
This is a difficult matter,
deciding whether unwritten rules
have been violated. On the one
hand, Professor Franklin and any
like him must have complete
freedom to advocate a basic
reorganization of the university,
and we should welcome such
advocacy as a stimulate to
re-ordering our own ideas about
the function of higher education.
On the other hand, acceptable
academic conduct can hardly
include attempts to bring about
the reorganization by force, or
incitement to such attempts.
Deciding between loud advocacy
and conduct injurious to the
academic community is not easy,
but it should not be impossible.
And I can think of nobody better
qualified to make such a decision
than an elected group of the
faculty like Stanford's Advisory
Board.
So it seems to me that the
Earth Sciences letter was trying
only to point out that "academic
due process" does not require that
a faculty hearing group pattern its
procedures strictly after a court of
law. One of its important
functions is certainly to weigh
evidence regarding violations of
law, but over and above this it
should use its collective
experience as long-time members
of an academic community to
consider also flagrant violations of
the traditional code of behavior
without which a university cannot
carry out its role in society.
