Righteous Impose Position
Editor, THE DAILY:
It isn't too often that the
opportunity presents itself to
compliment the Daily on a
reporting job. Friday's piece on
the Placement Center
demonstration by Chris Peck is a
good one and contains a bit of
rational dialogue which has the
ring of truth and relevance.
Student seeking to interview
potential employer: "Isn't it my
decision who I want to work for
and shouldn't I be allowed to
make that decision on my own?"
Demonstrator: "Of course, but we
think that you should make that
decision and discuss your plans far
away from this University
campus."
Unfortunately, that was all of
the exchange which was given so
that I can only wonder whether
Student ever was made to see the

light. He appeared to be guilty of
the tempting heresy that he has
certain rights on this campus that
are not subject to withdrawal by
the moral indignation of
Demonstrator.
In fact, tradition strongly
supports Demonstrator. Over the
years we have had laws requiring
us to go to church on Sunday and
forbidding us to acquire birth
control information, to
manufacture, transport or sell
alcoholic beverages, to kiss on
Sunday, to be a homosexual on
any day of the week, etc.
The morally righteous have a
long history of imposing their
position on others by obtaining
for that position the force of law
or regulation. It's a practice as
American as apple pie. It fair
boggles the mind what a sinful
nation this would be were it not
for such laws. So, I hope that
Student will come to see

Demonstrator in his true light,
girded in the bright armor of
moral certitude and righteousness,
a veritable J. Edgar Hoover. To
Demonstrator I say, "Bless you
for saving us all from sin;" to
Student, "Shut up. And be
saved."
T. J. Connolly,
Prof., Mech. Eng. Dept.
Editor, THE DAILY:
Professor Shockley's opinions
are foolish for some, abhorent for
others. Do they excuse the
screaming crowd? Burning a sad
old man in effigy is an ugly,
cowardly act — and self-defeating
if you honestly care about
constructive change.
"the best lack all conviction,
while the worst are full of
passionate intensity." (Yeats)
