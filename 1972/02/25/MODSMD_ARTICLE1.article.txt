# CJP Hearing Officer Suggests Guilty Verdict
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP)
hearing officer Lillian Altree yesterday
recommended that the four students
charged with "a violation of portions
of the Policy on Campus Disruption"
for the November 4 "mill-in" at the
Placement Center be found guilty by
the full CJP.
Earlier this week, CJP Chairman
John Kaplan told the Daily that the
full Panel will meet publicly next
Thursday evening to consider the case.
The four students are senior Don
Lee of Venceremos, sophomores Pete
Knutson and Paul Loeb, both of the
Young Crows, and sophomore Steve
Downey, also of Venceremos.
Each had been charged with
disrupting a TRW Corporation
interview with student Duane
Linsenbardt. Altree said that she made

her recommendations on "inference
from (25) findings" of fact also listed
in her 19 page decision.
GM Disruption
Lee was also cited for the
disruption on the same day of student
Terry McNelley's interview with
General Motors. On "inference" from
12 other findings of fact, Altree
recommended that Lee be found
guilty of that charge.
Altree, a Santa Clara University law
professor, said she did not feel it was
within her powers to rule on a defense
motion that questioned the legitimacy
of recruitment by war-related
industries at the Placement Center.
Legitimate Functions
The defense had argued that "only
disruptions of 'legitimate' functions
can be properly held to violate the
Policy on Campus Disruption."

Altreesaid in her report that "to
label such issues 'factual' is to grossly
oversimplify not merely the natures of
the questions themselves but also the
deliberate processes that must be
invoked if they are to be 'resolved' in a
meaningful way."
On those same grounds Altree made
no ruling on defense assertions that if
the four did, in fact, violate University
policy, they did so "in the reasonable
belief that:
"1) the interviews constituted
attempts by the interviewing
companies to solicit or incite students
to help design or produce more
effective means for murdering
Indochinese;
"2) no other means were available
to them for preventing such
solicitation on this campus;
"3) the means which they chose to
prevent the solicitation involved the
minimal degree of disruption
necessary, since they used neither
force nor violence nor threat of either
force or violence."
Under the Procedures of the CJP,
the defendants and counsel will have
the opportunity to make these same
motions again before the full panel
since they "may make a motivational
statement." Should the defendants
choose to make any such statement,
they will be subject to examination of
the Panel's members.
The defendants will also be allowed
to make "a plea in mitigation of
sentence" before the Panel. Should
they not appear at the Panel hearing or
leave during the course of that hearing,
the Panel will deliberate in their
absence.
