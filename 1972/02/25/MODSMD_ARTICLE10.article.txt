## Ballot Questioned 
###

Shortly after the announcement from the
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) that they
had reached a decision in the matter of labor
representation at Stanford University, I became
quite concerned as to how the results of the election
would affect me. My own opinion in this matter will
probably become apparent as this letter progresses;
however, my stand is unimportant in the overall
viewpoint of what I have to say regarding how the
NLRB has directed this election to be held.
In probing this matter I discovered how the
balloting was to be conducted. It is going to be held
according to the rules and direction of the NLRB,
which may be acceptable under certain conditions;
however, the situation at Stanford is considerably
more complicated than most union elections. The
usual procedure consists of one union wanting to
represent a group of employees. This situation does
not prevail at Stanford in that there are four unions
involved.
In the balloting the employee is directed to do
one of the following:
1. Vote yes by placing a mark under the name of
the union he wishes to have represent him.
2. Vote no.
In my opinion this type of ballot is only fair if there
is but one union wishing to represent the
employees. In our case, the person who wishes to
vote no is totally deprived of his choice in the
selection of a representative body, should the
majority of voters wish to be represented. This, to
me, is unfair to the class of people who would
rather not have a union but would want to have a
voice in the selection, should the majority want one.
My alternative plans would be one of the
following:
1. Have a two part election where the first part
would consist of a simple yes-no vote on
representation and the second part would be a
selection of unions if the yes votes were in the
majority, dropping the issue if the no votes were.
This would allow those in favor of a union to have
their say and those not in favor to have theirs. There
is no compromise necessary. Those wishing to vote
no would not be torn between sacrificing a no vote
for a union vote. Those wishing to be represented
would simply vote yes.
2. On a single ballot, present the yes-no option.

Those voting yes would select their favorite
contender; however, the no votes would be allowed
the option of marking the ballot under the union of
their choice and these votes would be counted
should a majority vote yes. This ballot may be
slightly more confusing to some people; however, it
would still contain the voice of the no voters in the
choice of union representation.
In an effort to follow the instructions on the
official notification of the election from the NLRB
regarding any complaints about the fairness of the
election, I attempted to contact Mr. Roy Hoffman
who is the Regional Director of Section 20 of the
NLRB, which includes Stanford, but was unable to
reach him. Instead, my inquiries were routed
through his assistant, Mrs. Allen, who was unable
and unwilling to assume any responsibility in
handling the matter. She directed me to "write a
letter of complaint which she would place in a file."
The only option left open to me now is to seek
help from fellow members of the Stanford
community, who see the inequities of this election,
in the form of support in seeking a court injunciton
to delay this election until a point is reached where
all persons can be fairly represented. As a
supplement to this, and maybe an effective
alternative, I strongly urge all Stanford employees
to write or telephone one or both of the following
gentlemen, voicing concern in this matter:
Mr. Roy O. Hoffman, Mr. Edward Miller
Regional Director, NLRB Chairman, NLRB
Region 20 1717 Pennsylvania
San Francisco, Calif. 94102 Ave., N.W.
Telephone: 556-5537 Washington, I).C.
They obviously will not recognize the complaint of
an individual.
There is so much red tape in the NLRB that my
cause will be completely lost in the proceedings
unless enough people make known their concern. It
will then be impossible for the NLRB to ignore the
complaint. Expediency in this matter is of the
utmost importance because of the quickly
approaching deadline. Every person involved in this
major decision at Stanford should agree
wholeheartedly with me that all should have a fair
and equal voice in these proceedings.
