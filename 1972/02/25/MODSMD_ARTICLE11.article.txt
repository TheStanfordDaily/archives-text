# Subjective Theatricality
## 
### DOUG ARTHUR 
Jean Genet subtitled his play
"The Blacks," which depicts the
revolution of blacks against white
colonial "civilization," clownerie
— a clown show. The prodigious
artistic integrity of the
UC-Berkeley production emanates
from its adherence, although
sometimes neglecting the
playwright's suggestions, the
Genet's subjective world of
theatricality.
A frame of mirrors outlined
the proscenium stage so that the
spectators could view themselves
while listening to the tunes of
"My Blue Heaven." As the white
curtain goes up, a Mozart minuet
begins to accompany elegantly
dressed black performers. The
action is separated from the
audience by a white scrim,
suggesting a mythical, dreamlike
atmosphere.
Suddenly the music reverts to
jazz, and the actors cut a livelier
step around a catafalque: already
the opposition between black and
white has been established by
music. Soon the white (black
actors wearing white costumes
and masks) parade in to the tune
of "When the Saints come
Marching In." The scrim rises and
white society — a Governor,
Queen, Judge, Missionary and
Valet — mounts the white steps to
a high white platform where they
will sit in judgement over the
performance of the killing of a
white women.
The blacks are effectively
contained by the set. Huge black
flats constructed of tree branches,
lumber and pastiche of canvas
surround the playing area.
Arched, white exits lead off stage
right and left. Suspended blocks
of glass reflect the action from
above. The black actors perform
beneath the white society, and
even the ground they walk on is
white.
Absence Of White
The same set identifies the
second locale in the midst of the
jungle with the addition of four
hanging African masks and a flood
of green light. The color whtie is
noticeably absent, except in the
"whites' " costumes and masks.
One recalls that African death
masks were painted white.
"The Blacks" delves into
psychological states of mind in
depicting race relations. Under the
guise of acting and pretense,
Genet's work does "worm its way
into our precious lives." This
drama is a parody of a ritual, in
which the bitterness and sarcasm
of the play are connoted by
clowning and derision. Were it not
for the multiple levels of
theatricality, the destruction of

the whites/liberation of blacks
would offer a deplorable
comment on racial relations.
Attired in a gold sportscoat, A 1
McVay Jr. played Archibald
Absalom Wellington, the master
of ceremonies. His speech and
gestures maintained a profound
animosity towards the audience.
He constantly emphasized the
ideals of performance, where deep
emotions are sublimated into
refined language. He orchestrated
Village's murder speech like a
conductor.
Interrupted Murder
The enactment of the murder
is often interrupted by the
comments and reactions of the
whites above. Likewise, the ritual
is frequently stopped by other
blacks on minor points of style
and form. The language resembles
a dramatic approach-avoidance
conflict: brutality of forceful,
lingual vehemence subsides into
the abstract world of imagistic
nebulousness. Sheer hatred bursts
in flashes of language, then
disappears.
Genet can be boring, so
director Robert Goldsby undercut
the speeches by musical
accompaniment. When Felicity
(Hope Goodwin) gives her
eloquent, but tedious 'To my
rescue Negroes" speech, bongo
drums accentuate the rhythms of
the language so that it becomes an
incantation. A xylophone also
livened the speeches at different
points.
The blacks often mimic or act
out the speeches of the whites.
Perhaps even more striking than
the spontaneous dancing and
gestures on the part of the blacks
was the range of acting
expression. In a barrage of
outrage, Camille-deborah Howard
as Snow exhausts herself in
accusing Village of wanting to be
white. She manage to sustain her
anger in contrast to some of the
other actors. As far as acting,
some of the scenes resembled a
line run through more than an
opening night.
Virtuoso Performance
Ed Mock gave a virtuoso
performance that made the Valet
the most consequential member
of the colonial ruling class. Mr.
Mock exemplified the decandence
of the whites by his outrageous
physical and moral degeneracy.
He slinks around the Queen's feet,
speaks in a high falsetto voice,
ogles the black men, and

manifests a number of
perversions, he's almost a
surrogate figure for Genet.
The whites followed in the
Valet's footsteps. At one point,
they all masturbate their
respective swords, scepters and
staffs. One was always conscious
that the actors are blacks playing
at being white. John Exeter's
Governor, for example, spoke
with a heavy Anglicized-African
accent that gave his scathing
appraisals of the blacks a touch of
irony.
The whites seem devoid of
elegance. They only respond
intermittently to the action below
them: when a strip show starts, as
they hear a Liszt melody, when
obscene references are made to
them. The Governor sits on his
sword, and the Queen plays with
the Valet. They sing "Bringing in
the Sheep" in preparation for the
redemption of the wronged white
woman.
Major Confrontation
The major confrontation in the
jungle pits the whites, led by the
Queen, against the blacks, who
rally behind Felicity. The Queen
invokes the white man's burden,
Dr. Livingstone, etc. but her
entire performance is a sham.
Felicity's elevated moral stature as
well as her words defeats the
white colonials. It is a contest of
beauty, elegance and style in
which the whites lose, and in
Genet's world, style equals power.
The whites are quickly
dispatched to hell. The spectators
learn that the action on stage is a
microcosm of the world beyond
the theatre where the blacks
around the world have been in
rebellion. The whites take off
their masks, and the all-black cast
discusses the performance. As
their task (diverting the audience's
attention from the real revolution
outside) has been successful, they
can finish the play.
Seeing the of white
colonial society carried onstage, I
remembered Genet's appraisal of
his theatre as a reflection. This
production faithfully translated
the rituals and ceremonies of the
play into stage terms thus
demonstrating the vigor of his
theatre. It was a reflection of a
reflection.
