# 'Mahogonny'
## A 						Vision Of Perfect Horror 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
Seek and ye shall be disappointed. Such is one of the many sullen
morals embedded in Spring Opera's version of Bertolt Brecht's and
Kurt Weill's opera "The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny"
(1930). However true it maybe, one thing is certain: the audience last
Friday night was NOT disappointed. This "Mahagonny" is
overwhelmingly, unhingingly successful socio-political theater.
Throughout, the production adheres with uncanny and unfailing
sympathy to the Brechtian theatrical conventions and to Weill's
parched, acerbic musical idion.
While last week's "Barber of Seville" left the audience
contemplating perfect joy and the "Orfeo" left it contemplating
perfect beauty, "Mahagonny" leaves its audience with a vision of
perfect horror. Brecht and Weill planned it that way; they are after all
more interested in meanacing than entertaining their audience. Their
characters have the nasty habit of staring into the darkness, pointing
accusing fingers at the customers, and seething unpleasant facts of life
at them.
Repulsion and outrage are the emotions they sought after. If it was
necessary to treat the audience as one would treat a dog that has
sinned against a carpet — smearing its collective nose in this shit-house
(Brecht's word) of a society — well, Brecht and Weill were not above
doing so.
Social Consciousness
I have puzzled over Brecht's success in the theatrical and (far more
improbably) operatic artforms, given his obsessive social
consciousness. After all, the radical's idee fixe, his utter inability to
achieve the perspective necessary for any sense of the ironic, and — his
most damming sin — nearly complete lack of a sense of humor ... all
this militates against successful theater. Hence the inflated emptiness
and boredom of our current radical prose and guerrilla theater. How,
then, did Brecht and Weill manage to dress up their harangues so
artfully and vitally?
To explain this paradox I find helpful something written by the
most Brechtian of American writers, H.L. Mencken. Menchken (like
Brecht, at his peak in the late 20's) attacked the brutal stupidities and
complacencies of Americans in an aptly brutal, vehement style.
Explaining why, in the face of what he saw around him, he
remained in American, Mencken wrote that one reason
grows out of my medieval but unashamed taste for the bizarre and
indelicate, my congenital weakness for comedy of the grosser
varieties. The United States, to my eye, is incomparably the
greatest show on earth.
How aptly this "greatest show on earth" vision of American keys into
"Mahagony" which — make no mistake —is an omnibus show
about the foibles of American society. This vision opens up, so to
speak, the theatrical possibilities which are inherent to Brecht's
beliefs.
Sardonic Humor
And the subject-matter for Mencken's sardonic humor? Nothing
could describe better the subject-matter of "Mahagonny" than
Mencken's itemization of what makes him laugh:
And here [in America], more than anywhere else that I know of
or have heard of, the daily panorama of human existence, of
private and communal folly — the unending procession of
governmental and throat-slittings, of theological buffooneries, or
aesthetic ribaldries, of legal swindles and harlotries, of
miscellaneous rogueries, villainies, imbecilities, grotesqueries, and
extragancies — is so inordinately gross and preposterous, so steadily
enriched with an almost fabulous daring and originality, that only
the man who was born with a petrified diaphragm can fail to laugh
himself to sleep every night.. ..
Mencken's laugh is very much like Brecht's: it tapers off into a kind of
deathrattle.
No playwright ever had a more perfect sense of the gross comedy
of social injustice and suffering than Brecht. And also like Menchken,
Brecht had a wonderful power to make use of a cliche while
annihilating it. Constantly in "Mahagonny" he turns mediocrity,
fatuous rhetoric, and false values fatally and viciously back upon
themselves. And Weill's music operates in the same way,twisting the
seamy, monotonous, plugged-in cliches of 20's jazz to his own
purposes.
The heroes of this production, producer William Francisco and
designer Robert Darling, knew exactly how to deal with the
commonplaces that "Mahagonny" feeds upon. Both showed a
staggering power to turn this thorough-going period piece into a stage
reality. As is customary with Darling's settings, "Mahagonny" gave
consistently interesting and effective stage pictures, and no small
number of specific coups de theatre as well. In addition, the costumes
— especially in the scenes of circus-like grotesquerie — were superbly
realized.
Francisco's stage direction kept the Brechtian incisors razor-sharp,
remained true to Brecht's famous audience-alienating effects, and
perhaps most importantly kept in control of "Mahagonny's" constant

ambivalence between cliche-grinding and more "serious" musical
developments.
Calculated Insipidity
Conductor Charles Schneider captured the calculated insipidity,
sleazy bumb-and-grind rhythms, and the tense but eerily bloodless
climactic moments which dot Weill's score. Placed behind the stage,
the orchestral menagerie (3 saxophones, banjo, cimbalom, bandoneon,
etc!) was the ultimate in honky-tonk gone berzerk.
The vocalism for "Mahagonny" ought to favor steeliness,
angularity and piercing emotionalism, and this cast displayed these
qualities abundantly. As Jim Mahoney (Brecht's Everyman who sees
the foibles of the City and is finally executed in the name of its
justice) Richard Kness made a striking impression. His tenor is perfect
for the part, bloodless, muscular and stentorian. His Act II aria, which
epitomizes the grim dilemmas and solitariness of the oppressed, was
the evening's vocal highlight.
Soprano Ariel Bvbee gave the character of .Jenny Hill (Mahoney's
harlot-cum-lover) just the right stridency and inner inertia. Together
with Kness, Bybee turned the anti-love duet into a supreme instance
of the desperate ennui which forces us into the arms of indifferent,
unfeeling lovers. ,
As the matronly swindler and henchwoman Patricia Newav
excelled; and Raymond Manton's oores oozed seediness in the role of
Fatty. Robert Mosley added a stylish and agile portrayal of Trinity
Moses.
I feared somewhat for the success of "Mahagonny" now that the
era it preys on is nearly out of memory's reach. But I am happy to say
that Brecht and Weill's methods are still with us, as "Carnal
Knowledge," "They Shoot Horses Don't They," "Cabaret," or "A
Clockwork Orange" would suggest.
And the patchwork of social and political conclusions which make
up "Mahagonny" (the structural chaos of the opera permits no single
message to develop) — well, they seem as pertinent as ever. The worst
crime in the City of Mahagonny is to be poor. Still true. You can't
hurt a dead man. Still true. Money buys justice. Still true. We are still
grimly reaping from the social evils that enraged Brecht.
This production epitomizes what Spring Opera can and should do.
And it hardens my opinion that Spring Opera Theater is the hottest
cultural commodity to hit San Francisco in years.
("Mohagonny" is sold out for its final two performances tomorrow
night and Sunday afternoon at the Curran Theater.)

morals embedded in Spring Opera's version of Bertolt Brecht's and
Kurt Weill's opera "The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny"
(1930). However true it maybe, one thing is certain: the audience last
Friday night was NOT disappointed. This "Mahagonny" is
overwhelmingly, unhingingly successful socio-political theater.
Throughout, the production adheres with uncanny and unfailing
sympathy to the Brechtian theatrical conventions and to Weill's
parched, acerbic musical idion.
While last week's "Barber of Seville" left the audience
contemplating perfect joy and the "Orfeo" left it contemplating
perfect beauty, "Mahagonny" leaves its audience with a vision of
perfect horror. Brecht and Weill planned it that way; they are after all
more interested in meanacing than entertaining their audience. Their
characters have the nasty habit of staring into the darkness, pointing
accusing fingers at the customers, and seething unpleasant facts of life
at them.
Repulsion and outrage are the emotions they sought after. If it was
necessary to treat the audience as one would treat a dog that has
sinned against a carpet — smearing its collective nose in this shit-house
(Brecht's word) of a society — well, Brecht and Weill were not above
doing so.
Social Consciousness
I have puzzled over Brecht's success in the theatrical and (far more
improbably) operatic artforms, given his obsessive social
consciousness. After all, the radical's idee fixe, his utter inability to
achieve the perspective necessary for any sense of the ironic, and — his
most damming sin — nearly complete lack of a sense of humor ... all
this militates against successful theater. Hence the inflated emptiness
and boredom of our current radical prose and guerrilla theater. How,
then, did Brecht and Weill manage to dress up their harangues so
artfully and vitally?
To explain this paradox I find helpful something written by the
most Brechtian of American writers, H.L. Mencken. Menchken (like
Brecht, at his peak in the late 20's) attacked the brutal stupidities and
complacencies of Americans in an aptly brutal, vehement style.
Explaining why, in the face of what he saw around him, he
remained in American, Mencken wrote that one reason
grows out of my medieval but unashamed taste for the bizarre and
indelicate, my congenital weakness for comedy of the grosser
varieties. The United States, to my eye, is incomparably the
greatest show on earth.
How aptly this "greatest show on earth" vision of American keys into
"Mahagony" which — make no mistake —is an omnibus show
about the foibles of American society. This vision opens up, so to
speak, the theatrical possibilities which are inherent to Brecht's
beliefs.
Sardonic Humor
And the subject-matter for Mencken's sardonic humor? Nothing
could describe better the subject-matter of "Mahagonny" than
Mencken's itemization of what makes him laugh:
And here [in America], more than anywhere else that I know of
or have heard of, the daily panorama of human existence, of
private and communal folly — the unending procession of
governmental and throat-slittings, of theological buffooneries, or
aesthetic ribaldries, of legal swindles and harlotries, of
miscellaneous rogueries, villainies, imbecilities, grotesqueries, and
extragancies — is so inordinately gross and preposterous, so steadily
enriched with an almost fabulous daring and originality, that only
the man who was born with a petrified diaphragm can fail to laugh
himself to sleep every night.. ..
Mencken's laugh is very much like Brecht's: it tapers off into a kind of
deathrattle.
No playwright ever had a more perfect sense of the gross comedy
of social injustice and suffering than Brecht. And also like Menchken,
Brecht had a wonderful power to make use of a cliche while
annihilating it. Constantly in "Mahagonny" he turns mediocrity,
fatuous rhetoric, and false values fatally and viciously back upon
themselves. And Weill's music operates in the same way,twisting the
seamy, monotonous, plugged-in cliches of 20's jazz to his own
purposes.
The heroes of this production, producer William Francisco and
designer Robert Darling, knew exactly how to deal with the
commonplaces that "Mahagonny" feeds upon. Both showed a
staggering power to turn this thorough-going period piece into a stage
reality. As is customary with Darling's settings, "Mahagonny" gave
consistently interesting and effective stage pictures, and no small
number of specific coups de theatre as well. In addition, the costumes
— especially in the scenes of circus-like grotesquerie — were superbly
realized.
Francisco's stage direction kept the Brechtian incisors razor-sharp,
remained true to Brecht's famous audience-alienating effects, and
perhaps most importantly kept in control of "Mahagonny's" constant

ambivalence between cliche-grinding and more "serious" musical
developments.
Calculated Insipidity
Conductor Charles Schneider captured the calculated insipidity,
sleazy bumb-and-grind rhythms, and the tense but eerily bloodless
climactic moments which dot Weill's score. Placed behind the stage,
the orchestral menagerie (3 saxophones, banjo, cimbalom, bandoneon,
etc!) was the ultimate in honky-tonk gone berzerk.
The vocalism for "Mahagonny" ought to favor steeliness,
angularity and piercing emotionalism, and this cast displayed these
qualities abundantly. As Jim Mahoney (Brecht's Everyman who sees
the foibles of the City and is finally executed in the name of its
justice) Richard Kness made a striking impression. His tenor is perfect
for the part, bloodless, muscular and stentorian. His Act II aria, which
epitomizes the grim dilemmas and solitariness of the oppressed, was
the evening's vocal highlight.
Soprano Ariel Bvbee gave the character of .Jenny Hill (Mahoney's
harlot-cum-lover) just the right stridency and inner inertia. Together
with Kness, Bybee turned the anti-love duet into a supreme instance
of the desperate ennui which forces us into the arms of indifferent,
unfeeling lovers. ,
As the matronly swindler and henchwoman Patricia Newav
excelled; and Raymond Manton's oores oozed seediness in the role of
Fatty. Robert Mosley added a stylish and agile portrayal of Trinity
Moses.
I feared somewhat for the success of "Mahagonny" now that the
era it preys on is nearly out of memory's reach. But I am happy to say
that Brecht and Weill's methods are still with us, as "Carnal
Knowledge," "They Shoot Horses Don't They," "Cabaret," or "A
Clockwork Orange" would suggest.
And the patchwork of social and political conclusions which make
up "Mahagonny" (the structural chaos of the opera permits no single
message to develop) — well, they seem as pertinent as ever. The worst
crime in the City of Mahagonny is to be poor. Still true. You can't
hurt a dead man. Still true. Money buys justice. Still true. We are still
grimly reaping from the social evils that enraged Brecht.
This production epitomizes what Spring Opera can and should do.
And it hardens my opinion that Spring Opera Theater is the hottest
cultural commodity to hit San Francisco in years.

night and Sunday afternoon at the Curran Theater.)

morals embedded in Spring Opera's version of Bertolt Brecht's and
Kurt Weill's opera "The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny"
(1930). However true it maybe, one thing is certain: the audience last
Friday night was NOT disappointed. This "Mahagonny" is
overwhelmingly, unhingingly successful socio-political theater.
Throughout, the production adheres with uncanny and unfailing
sympathy to the Brechtian theatrical conventions and to Weill's
parched, acerbic musical idion.
While last week's "Barber of Seville" left the audience
contemplating perfect joy and the "Orfeo" left it contemplating
perfect beauty, "Mahagonny" leaves its audience with a vision of
perfect horror. Brecht and Weill planned it that way; they are after all
more interested in meanacing than entertaining their audience. Their
characters have the nasty habit of staring into the darkness, pointing
accusing fingers at the customers, and seething unpleasant facts of life
at them.
Repulsion and outrage are the emotions they sought after. If it was
necessary to treat the audience as one would treat a dog that has
sinned against a carpet — smearing its collective nose in this shit-house
(Brecht's word) of a society — well, Brecht and Weill were not above
doing so.
Social Consciousness
I have puzzled over Brecht's success in the theatrical and (far more
improbably) operatic artforms, given his obsessive social
consciousness. After all, the radical's idee fixe, his utter inability to
achieve the perspective necessary for any sense of the ironic, and — his
most damming sin — nearly complete lack of a sense of humor ... all
this militates against successful theater. Hence the inflated emptiness
and boredom of our current radical prose and guerrilla theater. How,
then, did Brecht and Weill manage to dress up their harangues so
artfully and vitally?
To explain this paradox I find helpful something written by the
most Brechtian of American writers, H.L. Mencken. Menchken (like
Brecht, at his peak in the late 20's) attacked the brutal stupidities and
complacencies of Americans in an aptly brutal, vehement style.
Explaining why, in the face of what he saw around him, he
remained in American, Mencken wrote that one reason
grows out of my medieval but unashamed taste for the bizarre and
indelicate, my congenital weakness for comedy of the grosser
varieties. The United States, to my eye, is incomparably the
greatest show on earth.
How aptly this "greatest show on earth" vision of American keys into
"Mahagony" which — make no mistake —is an omnibus show
about the foibles of American society. This vision opens up, so to
speak, the theatrical possibilities which are inherent to Brecht's
beliefs.
Sardonic Humor
And the subject-matter for Mencken's sardonic humor? Nothing
could describe better the subject-matter of "Mahagonny" than
Mencken's itemization of what makes him laugh:
And here [in America], more than anywhere else that I know of
or have heard of, the daily panorama of human existence, of
private and communal folly — the unending procession of
governmental and throat-slittings, of theological buffooneries, or
aesthetic ribaldries, of legal swindles and harlotries, of
miscellaneous rogueries, villainies, imbecilities, grotesqueries, and
extragancies — is so inordinately gross and preposterous, so steadily
enriched with an almost fabulous daring and originality, that only
the man who was born with a petrified diaphragm can fail to laugh
himself to sleep every night.. ..
Mencken's laugh is very much like Brecht's: it tapers off into a kind of
deathrattle.
No playwright ever had a more perfect sense of the gross comedy
of social injustice and suffering than Brecht. And also like Menchken,
Brecht had a wonderful power to make use of a cliche while
annihilating it. Constantly in "Mahagonny" he turns mediocrity,
fatuous rhetoric, and false values fatally and viciously back upon
themselves. And Weill's music operates in the same way,twisting the
seamy, monotonous, plugged-in cliches of 20's jazz to his own
purposes.
The heroes of this production, producer William Francisco and
designer Robert Darling, knew exactly how to deal with the
commonplaces that "Mahagonny" feeds upon. Both showed a
staggering power to turn this thorough-going period piece into a stage
reality. As is customary with Darling's settings, "Mahagonny" gave
consistently interesting and effective stage pictures, and no small
number of specific coups de theatre as well. In addition, the costumes
— especially in the scenes of circus-like grotesquerie — were superbly
realized.
Francisco's stage direction kept the Brechtian incisors razor-sharp,
remained true to Brecht's famous audience-alienating effects, and
perhaps most importantly kept in control of "Mahagonny's" constant

ambivalence between cliche-grinding and more "serious" musical
developments.
Calculated Insipidity
Conductor Charles Schneider captured the calculated insipidity,
sleazy bumb-and-grind rhythms, and the tense but eerily bloodless
climactic moments which dot Weill's score. Placed behind the stage,
the orchestral menagerie (3 saxophones, banjo, cimbalom, bandoneon,
etc!) was the ultimate in honky-tonk gone berzerk.
The vocalism for "Mahagonny" ought to favor steeliness,
angularity and piercing emotionalism, and this cast displayed these
qualities abundantly. As Jim Mahoney (Brecht's Everyman who sees
the foibles of the City and is finally executed in the name of its
justice) Richard Kness made a striking impression. His tenor is perfect
for the part, bloodless, muscular and stentorian. His Act II aria, which
epitomizes the grim dilemmas and solitariness of the oppressed, was
the evening's vocal highlight.
Soprano Ariel Bvbee gave the character of .Jenny Hill (Mahoney's
harlot-cum-lover) just the right stridency and inner inertia. Together
with Kness, Bybee turned the anti-love duet into a supreme instance
of the desperate ennui which forces us into the arms of indifferent,
unfeeling lovers. ,
As the matronly swindler and henchwoman Patricia Newav
excelled; and Raymond Manton's oores oozed seediness in the role of
Fatty. Robert Mosley added a stylish and agile portrayal of Trinity
Moses.
I feared somewhat for the success of "Mahagonny" now that the
era it preys on is nearly out of memory's reach. But I am happy to say
that Brecht and Weill's methods are still with us, as "Carnal
Knowledge," "They Shoot Horses Don't They," "Cabaret," or "A
Clockwork Orange" would suggest.
And the patchwork of social and political conclusions which make
up "Mahagonny" (the structural chaos of the opera permits no single
message to develop) — well, they seem as pertinent as ever. The worst
crime in the City of Mahagonny is to be poor. Still true. You can't
hurt a dead man. Still true. Money buys justice. Still true. We are still
grimly reaping from the social evils that enraged Brecht.
This production epitomizes what Spring Opera can and should do.
And it hardens my opinion that Spring Opera Theater is the hottest
cultural commodity to hit San Francisco in years.

night and Sunday afternoon at the Curran Theater.)

morals embedded in Spring Opera's version of Bertolt Brecht's and
Kurt Weill's opera "The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny"
(1930). However true it maybe, one thing is certain: the audience last
Friday night was NOT disappointed. This "Mahagonny" is
overwhelmingly, unhingingly successful socio-political theater.
Throughout, the production adheres with uncanny and unfailing
sympathy to the Brechtian theatrical conventions and to Weill's
parched, acerbic musical idion.
While last week's "Barber of Seville" left the audience
contemplating perfect joy and the "Orfeo" left it contemplating
perfect beauty, "Mahagonny" leaves its audience with a vision of
perfect horror. Brecht and Weill planned it that way; they are after all
more interested in meanacing than entertaining their audience. Their
characters have the nasty habit of staring into the darkness, pointing
accusing fingers at the customers, and seething unpleasant facts of life
at them.
Repulsion and outrage are the emotions they sought after. If it was
necessary to treat the audience as one would treat a dog that has
sinned against a carpet — smearing its collective nose in this shit-house
(Brecht's word) of a society — well, Brecht and Weill were not above
doing so.
Social Consciousness
I have puzzled over Brecht's success in the theatrical and (far more
improbably) operatic artforms, given his obsessive social
consciousness. After all, the radical's idee fixe, his utter inability to
achieve the perspective necessary for any sense of the ironic, and — his
most damming sin — nearly complete lack of a sense of humor ... all
this militates against successful theater. Hence the inflated emptiness
and boredom of our current radical prose and guerrilla theater. How,
then, did Brecht and Weill manage to dress up their harangues so
artfully and vitally?
To explain this paradox I find helpful something written by the
most Brechtian of American writers, H.L. Mencken. Menchken (like
Brecht, at his peak in the late 20's) attacked the brutal stupidities and
complacencies of Americans in an aptly brutal, vehement style.
Explaining why, in the face of what he saw around him, he
remained in American, Mencken wrote that one reason
grows out of my medieval but unashamed taste for the bizarre and
indelicate, my congenital weakness for comedy of the grosser
varieties. The United States, to my eye, is incomparably the
greatest show on earth.
How aptly this "greatest show on earth" vision of American keys into
"Mahagony" which — make no mistake —is an omnibus show
about the foibles of American society. This vision opens up, so to
speak, the theatrical possibilities which are inherent to Brecht's
beliefs.
Sardonic Humor
And the subject-matter for Mencken's sardonic humor? Nothing
could describe better the subject-matter of "Mahagonny" than
Mencken's itemization of what makes him laugh:
And here [in America], more than anywhere else that I know of
or have heard of, the daily panorama of human existence, of
private and communal folly — the unending procession of
governmental and throat-slittings, of theological buffooneries, or
aesthetic ribaldries, of legal swindles and harlotries, of
miscellaneous rogueries, villainies, imbecilities, grotesqueries, and
extragancies — is so inordinately gross and preposterous, so steadily
enriched with an almost fabulous daring and originality, that only
the man who was born with a petrified diaphragm can fail to laugh
himself to sleep every night.. ..
Mencken's laugh is very much like Brecht's: it tapers off into a kind of
deathrattle.
No playwright ever had a more perfect sense of the gross comedy
of social injustice and suffering than Brecht. And also like Menchken,
Brecht had a wonderful power to make use of a cliche while
annihilating it. Constantly in "Mahagonny" he turns mediocrity,
fatuous rhetoric, and false values fatally and viciously back upon
themselves. And Weill's music operates in the same way,twisting the
seamy, monotonous, plugged-in cliches of 20's jazz to his own
purposes.
The heroes of this production, producer William Francisco and
designer Robert Darling, knew exactly how to deal with the
commonplaces that "Mahagonny" feeds upon. Both showed a
staggering power to turn this thorough-going period piece into a stage
reality. As is customary with Darling's settings, "Mahagonny" gave
consistently interesting and effective stage pictures, and no small
number of specific coups de theatre as well. In addition, the costumes
— especially in the scenes of circus-like grotesquerie — were superbly
realized.
Francisco's stage direction kept the Brechtian incisors razor-sharp,
remained true to Brecht's famous audience-alienating effects, and
perhaps most importantly kept in control of "Mahagonny's" constant

ambivalence between cliche-grinding and more "serious" musical
developments.
Calculated Insipidity
Conductor Charles Schneider captured the calculated insipidity,
sleazy bumb-and-grind rhythms, and the tense but eerily bloodless
climactic moments which dot Weill's score. Placed behind the stage,
the orchestral menagerie (3 saxophones, banjo, cimbalom, bandoneon,
etc!) was the ultimate in honky-tonk gone berzerk.
The vocalism for "Mahagonny" ought to favor steeliness,
angularity and piercing emotionalism, and this cast displayed these
qualities abundantly. As Jim Mahoney (Brecht's Everyman who sees
the foibles of the City and is finally executed in the name of its
justice) Richard Kness made a striking impression. His tenor is perfect
for the part, bloodless, muscular and stentorian. His Act II aria, which
epitomizes the grim dilemmas and solitariness of the oppressed, was
the evening's vocal highlight.
Soprano Ariel Bvbee gave the character of .Jenny Hill (Mahoney's
harlot-cum-lover) just the right stridency and inner inertia. Together
with Kness, Bybee turned the anti-love duet into a supreme instance
of the desperate ennui which forces us into the arms of indifferent,
unfeeling lovers. ,
As the matronly swindler and henchwoman Patricia Newav
excelled; and Raymond Manton's oores oozed seediness in the role of
Fatty. Robert Mosley added a stylish and agile portrayal of Trinity
Moses.
I feared somewhat for the success of "Mahagonny" now that the
era it preys on is nearly out of memory's reach. But I am happy to say
that Brecht and Weill's methods are still with us, as "Carnal
Knowledge," "They Shoot Horses Don't They," "Cabaret," or "A
Clockwork Orange" would suggest.
And the patchwork of social and political conclusions which make
up "Mahagonny" (the structural chaos of the opera permits no single
message to develop) — well, they seem as pertinent as ever. The worst
crime in the City of Mahagonny is to be poor. Still true. You can't
hurt a dead man. Still true. Money buys justice. Still true. We are still
grimly reaping from the social evils that enraged Brecht.
This production epitomizes what Spring Opera can and should do.
And it hardens my opinion that Spring Opera Theater is the hottest
cultural commodity to hit San Francisco in years.
("Mohagonny" is sold out for its final two performances tomorrow
night and Sunday afternoon at the Curran Theater.)
