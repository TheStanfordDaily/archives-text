"Dear Friends," The Fire sign
Theatre, Columbia KG 31099.
It had to happen. With Crosby,
Stills, Nash and Young, with the
Rolling Stones, with Elton John,
for Chrissakes, releasing live
albums, it was only a matter of
time before the idea was picked
up by those denizens of
avant-garde comedy, the Firesign
Theatre.
Actually, this is not really a
live album, but close enough. It's
a I wo-record set of material culled
from the group's syndicated
Sunday radio series, "Dear
Friends." And it's funny as hell.
The Firesign Theatre are
perhaps the first rock comedians,
in that they are totally unlike any
previous generation of comics.
Lenny Bruce, for all his innovative

abilities, was at heart still a
stand-up comic. The Firesign
Theatre represent a new force in
verbal comedy, and the strength
of their contribution is just
beginning to be measured by the
success of newer acts like Cheech
and Chong.
The Firesign's style is to bunch
so much material onto each cut
that it takes at least four listenings
to even scratch the surface.
Even on a Firesign album,
though, some cuts are funnier
than others. On "Dear Friends,"
Messrs. Austin, Bergman, Proctor,
and Ossman are at their best 011
'The Someday Funnies" (with
Mayor Dropyer LaGuardia);
"Minority Street," a television
kiddie show satire; "Deputy Dan
Has No Friends;" and a
gut-busting "Mark Time!" starring

that outer-space scourge of evil
with his friends Bob Bunny and
Dr. Technical in battle with Prince
Arcturus.
But a Firesign album almost by
definition is consistently hilarious.
For those who missed the
syncidated show on Berkeley's
KPFA, or for those who want to
relive past moments of hilarity, or
for those who just feel like
laughing a whole lot, "Dear
Friends" is a must.

One/' Mike Nesmitk and the
Second National Band, RCA

Eeek! It's really him! Take
away the scraggly beard and add
one of those stupid woollen hats
and it's just like old times! Mike
Nesmith of the dear, departed
Monkees is back!
Which is unfortunately how
this, as well as Nesmith's two
previous solo records, have been
received. When will the public get
it driven into its thick collective
head that the man is capable of
some pretty fine music?
The Monkees, of course, were
the first pre-packaged rock group
bestowed upon us by Don
Kirshner, later the perpetrator of
the Archies. But since the demise
of the TV show and the breakup
of that synthetic group, Nesmith
has returned to the kind of music
he does best: heavily
countrv-and-westem-flavored rock

with lots of steel guitar and a
funky piano for good measure.
With "Tantamount to Treason,"
he has his third good, if not
excellent, release.
Super-Thin Discs
"Mama Rocker," which opens
the record, is the strongest cut
and might even make a good
single. It's three minutes of
driving Elvis-cum-Creedence rock
'n' roll, with a fantastic piano
straight out of Jerry Lee Lewis.
The only thing wrong with it is a
poorly-mixed vocal track, and one
would wonder whether that's the
fault of Nesmith or of RCA's
super-thin flexible discs.
If Nesmith could only keep his
material down to under three
minutes he would be doing
himself a big favor, for his
compositions have a general
tendency to lose some of their
punch when drawn out. For
instance, "In the Afternoon," an
otherwise perfectly fine song, is at
six minutes about twice as long as
it should be, and borders at times
on being boring. Also, it is marred
by the presence of an over-loud
and simplistic bass line.
Other cuts worth listening to
on the album include "Talking to
the Wall," and "Bonaparte's
Retreat." But the whole album is
a relaxing experience, and with a
new engineer and a little tighter
material Nesmith can be even
better.
"Hey, hey we're the
Monkees. . indeed.

live album, but close enough. It's
a I wo-record set of material culled
from the group's syndicated
Sunday radio series, "Dear
Friends." And it's funny as hell.
The Firesign Theatre are
perhaps the first rock comedians,
in that they are totally unlike any
previous generation of comics.
Lenny Bruce, for all his innovative

abilities, was at heart still a
stand-up comic. The Firesign
Theatre represent a new force in
verbal comedy, and the strength
of their contribution is just
beginning to be measured by the
success of newer acts like Cheech
and Chong.
The Firesign's style is to bunch
so much material onto each cut
that it takes at least four listenings
to even scratch the surface.
Even on a Firesign album,
though, some cuts are funnier
than others. On "Dear Friends,"
Messrs. Austin, Bergman, Proctor,
and Ossman are at their best 011
'The Someday Funnies" (with
Mayor Dropyer LaGuardia);
"Minority Street," a television
kiddie show satire; "Deputy Dan
Has No Friends;" and a
gut-busting "Mark Time!" starring

that outer-space scourge of evil
with his friends Bob Bunny and
Dr. Technical in battle with Prince
Arcturus.
But a Firesign album almost by
definition is consistently hilarious.
For those who missed the
syncidated show on Berkeley's
KPFA, or for those who want to
relive past moments of hilarity, or
for those who just feel like
laughing a whole lot, "Dear
Friends" is a must.

Eeek! It's really him! Take
away the scraggly beard and add
one of those stupid woollen hats
and it's just like old times! Mike
Nesmith of the dear, departed
Monkees is back!
Which is unfortunately how
this, as well as Nesmith's two
previous solo records, have been
received. When will the public get
it driven into its thick collective
head that the man is capable of
some pretty fine music?
The Monkees, of course, were
the first pre-packaged rock group
bestowed upon us by Don
Kirshner, later the perpetrator of
the Archies. But since the demise
of the TV show and the breakup
of that synthetic group, Nesmith
has returned to the kind of music
he does best: heavily
countrv-and-westem-flavored rock

with lots of steel guitar and a
funky piano for good measure.
With "Tantamount to Treason,"
he has his third good, if not
excellent, release.
Super-Thin Discs
"Mama Rocker," which opens
the record, is the strongest cut
and might even make a good
single. It's three minutes of
driving Elvis-cum-Creedence rock
'n' roll, with a fantastic piano
straight out of Jerry Lee Lewis.
The only thing wrong with it is a
poorly-mixed vocal track, and one
would wonder whether that's the
fault of Nesmith or of RCA's
super-thin flexible discs.
If Nesmith could only keep his
material down to under three
minutes he would be doing
himself a big favor, for his
compositions have a general
tendency to lose some of their
punch when drawn out. For
instance, "In the Afternoon," an
otherwise perfectly fine song, is at
six minutes about twice as long as
it should be, and borders at times
on being boring. Also, it is marred
by the presence of an over-loud
and simplistic bass line.
Other cuts worth listening to
on the album include "Talking to
the Wall," and "Bonaparte's
Retreat." But the whole album is
a relaxing experience, and with a
new engineer and a little tighter
material Nesmith can be even
better.
