# Swimmers—The Hardest Workers?
## 
### Mike Chasson 
To achieve success in any sport it takes a certain amount of hard
work. Most athletes don't enjoy practice but accept it as something
that must be done.
The amount of practice it takes to achieve success in a particular
sport at Stanford varies from sport to sport. For example, in football
a player reports to campus in mid-August. He practices twice a day for
a total of about four hours. During this time before school begins
much of the hard work is done to get ready for the regular season.
Along with the conditioning, however, time is devoted to watching
films and going over plays.
Once school starts practice is once a day for approximately one
and one-half hours. Practice is five days a week with the middle days
fairly hard, and with the others not so difficult, so as to prepare for
games. In the spring the player has practice for about one month, with
practices five to six days a week. Practices are one to two hours a day,
with varying intensity.
When no practices are scheduled in the winter and the summer the
player is expected to do some work on his own involving weights and
running. Many players, however, do very little during these periods
leaving the conditioning for spring or late summer.
Hard Work In Summer
Thus, a football player at Stanford puts in approximately one and
one-half hours a day for a period of three months and four hours a
day for a period of a month. Most of the hard work is done before
school starts in the fall relieving much of thepressure that could exist
on finding study time.
In contrast to football there is swimming, where the amount of
time a swimmer must put in to achieve success is quite amazing. The
Stanford swimmer in most cases works on a year around program of
coached workouts. There are few swimmers who compete successfully
in conferences such as the Pacific-Eight who don't work out all year
around.
Fall Practice
In the fall, practices are once or twice a day depending on the
swimmer. A morning practice will last one and a half hours.
Approximately 4000-5000 yards will be completed. In the afternoon
practice will be of about the same length covering about 3000-4000
yards. Afternoon practices are relatively easy. Overall, in the fall a
swimmer can put in as much as 9000 yards a day if he is going to both
workouts, however, few swimmers go that much in the fall. This is the
equivalent of running about 20 miles a day.
Starting with Christmas vacation the hard work really begins. The
swimmer will workout twice a day covering 10,000-11,000 yards in a

period of about 3'/2-4 hours. Workouts are much harder than the fall
as the swimmer starts seriously getting ready for the meet season.
Once school starts again in the winter, practics are 6:30-8:00 in the
morning and 4:00-6:00 in the afternoon. Afternoon practices are six
days a week. The swimmers unable to make the 6:30 workout
practice at 10:00 or 11:00. The swimmer covers between 9,000 and
10,000 yards a day. These hard workouts continue until the end of
winter quarter when the work load drops in preparation for thr
NCAA's.
After NCAA's collegiate swimming is over, but most swimmers
continue swimming twice a day after a short break of a week or so.
The swimmer will workout with a local AAU club or on his own
campus. Practices take up as much time as in the winter quarter and
cover as many yards, but now the swimmer must travel up to as much
as 40 miles a day going to and from practice.
Summer Workouts
Once school lets out for the summer the swimmer works out at
least four hours a day covering about 14,000 yards a day. Practices in
most cases are six days a week. The summer work is the equivalent of
running about 175 miles a week. The swimmer's only long break
comes after the big summer AAU meets in late August. After these
meets the swimmer doesn't workout until the start of school in the
fall.
Unlike football where practices weren't considered serious until
high school and in some cases until college, many swimmers have been
following the yearly schedule just described since they were 13 or 14
years old. Many have worked out at least once a day since they were
seven or eight years old.
Few Scholarships
It is doubtful that a participant in any sport puts in more work
than a swimmer in his quest for success. Unlike sports such as football
the material rewards are not significant and in most cases
non-existent. Stanford offers about 2-3 scholarships a year for
swimming. Even swimming powers such as Indiana only offer about
5-6 scholarships a year. In football as many as 30 scholarships a year
can be awarded.
Sports such as football and basketball also offer a chance for the
most talented to go on to the pros, while the most talented in
swimming must be content with a successful amateur career. Even in
"amateur" sports such as track, participants are able to come up with
many extras for competing in a certain meet. It may even be said that
swimming is one of the few sports where the participants are amateurs
in every sense of the word.

ONE OF THE HARD WORKERS-Dave Shilling, one of the Stanford
swimmers, currently spends up to three and a half hours a day in the
pool. The work has payed off as he is the number three breastroker in
the country.
