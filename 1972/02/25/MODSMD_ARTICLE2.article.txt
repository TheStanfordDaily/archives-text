# USE Members Back Open Shop Proposal
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
United Stanford Employees voted
28-9 last night to set a policy of
voluntary membership in the union if
it is chosen by University workers to
represent them in collective
bargaining.
The "open shop" proposition was
the only one of 21 points submitted to
USE members last night for approval
as a campaign platform that attracted
any opposition.
Other demands included a five-day,
35-hour work week and a minimum
wage of $3.31 per hour.
Most of the debate on the open or
closed shop issue centered around how
strong a union could be without
unanimous support from the 1600
workers it will represent.
"If a contract is made, everyone
benefits in the unit," one worker
pointed out. "If the people in the
union are doing the work and paying
the dues, then they are the ones who
are paying for it, and they should
benefit. Those who aren't in the union
are riding on the backs of the people
who are in the union."
Keith Stothers, a member of the
Teamsters Stanford Organizing
Committee, warned the group, "If you
win this election and you don't have a
union shop, you don't have anything."
A union shop is one where all workers
must belong to the union.
But Jim Berk, president of USE,
issued a scathing denunciation of the
mandatory membership proposal.
"For three years we've tried to
build a strong union," Berk told the
meeting. "If people say that the
demand of a union shop is evidence of
a strong union, then they're talking
about the same thing I am. But if
they're saying that you build a strong
union by demanding a closed shop,
then that's the most opportunistic
thing I've ever heard of."
"Division between us and the
Teamsters over the open and closed
shop and resolving the ballot on that

issue is playing into the hands of the
opportunistic position of the
Teamsters that they're a strong
union," Berk continued.
Several other members of the group
speculated that workers at SLAC
would reject any union that advocates
a closed shop.
One of the other 21 points was the
elimination of the first three steps of
the present six-step salary scale, and
starting workers at the fourth step.
