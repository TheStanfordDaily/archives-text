# Baseball Team Wins A Pair
## 
### STAN WILSON 
Last Saturday Stanford's
varsity baseball team split a pair
of games with an excellent Santa
Clara team, dropping the first
game 8-2, and bouncing back to
win the second contest, 7-4.
Bob Dipietro was the loser in
the first game, but he threw
"pretty well," according to Coach
Ray Young. "On that day Santa
Clara was one of the best hitting
college teams I've ever
seen . . . they're one of the best
hitting teams in the nation right

now," he explained.
Stanford rebounded in the
second game, producing their best
offensive showing of the season
thus far. Rod Boone slammed his
first homer of the season off loser
Todd Brentlinger, and outfielder
Tom Williams followed with a
three-run double to insure the
victory. Williams, a senior from
Philadelphia, has been a pleasant
surprise this season for Coach
Young. The 6'l" 190 pounder is
hitting at a .500 clip, with several
key hits. Winning pitcher Dan

Shaw went the full nine innings
for the Indians, and pitched a
"strong game," according to
Young.
In the first game with Santa
Clara, Stanford lost more than the
game. All-Conference shortstop A 1
O'Brien broke both bones in his
leg, and in all probability will be
lost for the season. O'Brien was
the second leading hitter in the
conference last yeai. Kim
Hannaford was moved from third
to replace the injured O'Brien.
On Tuesday it was all pitching
and defense again for Stanford, as
they defeated St. Marys 1-0. Bob
Kammeyer, a 6'4" senior from
Richardson, Texas, had his best
game to date, throwing six
scoreless innings. Tom Changnon
pitched the last three, and the
Stanford pitching staff recorded
its fifth shutout in ten games,
with an outstanding combined
ERA of 1.75. Catcher Bob Reece
contributed 2 hits, as the Indians
upped their record to 7-3.
Stanford plays six games in the
next five days, beginning with
Santa Clara today at 2:30, away.
Nick Peterson is scheduled to
pitch. On Saturday the team
travels to Fresno State for a
doubleheader, against perhaps one
of the toughest teams Stanfrod
will face this year. Fresno State
has already beaten UCLA and
USC, both excellent teams. Dan
Shaw and Bob Di Pietro will ptich
for Stanford.
