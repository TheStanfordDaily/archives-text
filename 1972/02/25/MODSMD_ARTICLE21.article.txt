## Gymnasts Face Cal 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
One of the most interesting
athletic events on the Stanford
campus in years will take place
tomorrow night in Maples Pavilion
at 8 p.m.
Card gymnastic teams have lost
48 out of the 49 times they have
faced Berkeley squads which
consistently rank among the top
five in the nation. But tomorrow
night, however, Cal will perform
with the most talented group of
Stanford gymnasts ever assembled
and the meet should be very close.
The Bears are undefeated this
season and have not put all of
their best men on the floor yet
this year. For the Stanford meet,
Cal coach Hal Frey will have his
best gymnasts competing in the
face of the most serious challenge
his team has received this season.
Three seniors will form the
strength of the Cal squad. Minoru
Morisaki, a senior, is rated by
Stanford coach Dan Millman as
"one of the best all-around
gymnasts in the nation." Barney
Peters and Carl Satta are both
seniors and are highly regarded
all-around men. Peters took third
in the NCAA rings competition
last year.
Millman feels that Cal's
experience may be a factor in the
meet since his gymnasts are
young. "It is going to be a very
close meet that will be decided by
only a few points. Cal would have
to be classified as a slight favorite
and it would be a small upset if
we won."
Olympian Steve Hug will vie
with Morisaki for all-around
honors as will freshman Bob
Anderson. Ted Miyamoto, Hector
Neff and Howard Bessen will also
give Cal strong competition.
At 1:00 p.m. tomorrow, Cal
and Stanford will give unofficial
compulsory performances in
Maples. Compulsories are held in
big national meets and every
competitor has to perform the
same routine and be judged
accordingly.
Saturday night at 8:00 p.m. in
Maples, the two squads will
officially meet and every gymnast
will perform a routine of his
choosing.
Although the meet will be
close and the competitive aspect
exciting, the greatest attraction of
the event will be the sheer level of
artistry and accomplishment
displayed by some of the nation's

best gymasts.
Millman explains the function
of and the approach that should
be taken towards gymnastics.
"Gymnastics is as much of an
art as a sport. I don't use the word
"art" as a fancy label. I define art
as an activity which has as its
primary function, the creation or
synthesis of beauty. Generally,
but not always, an art is an
individual creative venture.
Whatever we call beauty, we
would have to agree that football,
for example, while perhaps
"beautiful" to many people,
doesn't have this as its primary
goal. Scoring and defeating the
opponent is the goal of football,
swimming, track, wrestling, and
most all sports. The game, the
excitement, the suspense, is the
thing in the above sports. People
probably wouldn't pay to watch
one man on the wrestling mat, or
a man run down field and kick a
football. Spectator interest
depends upon the competition —
and a "successful", that is,
winning, team."
"There are a group of other
sports that are primarily aesthetic,
performance arts .. . that are
slowly evolving away from
complete dependence on scores
and beating some other team.
Diving, figure skating, and
gymnastics are among these
activities. People enjoy watching
these activities whatever the score,
whoever "wins." In fact, the idea
of one gymnast competing against
another is a fanciful idea at best.
According to the rules of
gymnastics, each man performing
strives for a perfect score; 10.0.
(A performance with no flaws of
execution and meeting certain
difficulty requirements)."
'I know from experience that
people don't like to watch
basketball teams or football teams
that consistently lose. These
sports have much more to offer
the spectator than gymnastics in
terms of suspense and close
competition. However, they don't
have the advantage of inherently
aesthetic performance that
gymnastics has, and therefore
must rely on scores, winning,
losing and so forth. It's interesting
to note that at our last gymnastics
meet, no scores were announced.
No one cared! The reason is, they
had seen some exciting
performances — interesting for
their own sake."

"art" as a fancy label. I define art
as an activity which has as its
primary function, the creation or
synthesis of beauty. Generally,
but not always, an art is an
individual creative venture.
Whatever we call beauty, we
would have to agree that football,
for example, while perhaps
"beautiful" to many people,
doesn't have this as its primary
goal. Scoring and defeating the
opponent is the goal of football,
swimming, track, wrestling, and
most all sports. The game, the
excitement, the suspense, is the
thing in the above sports. People
probably wouldn't pay to watch
one man on the wrestling mat, or
a man run down field and kick a
football. Spectator interest
depends upon the competition —
and a "successful", that is,
winning, team."
"There are a group of other
sports that are primarily aesthetic,
performance arts .. . that are
slowly evolving away from
complete dependence on scores
and beating some other team.
Diving, figure skating, and
gymnastics are among these
activities. People enjoy watching
these activities whatever the score,
whoever "wins." In fact, the idea
of one gymnast competing against
another is a fanciful idea at best.
According to the rules of
gymnastics, each man performing
strives for a perfect score; 10.0.
(A performance with no flaws of
execution and meeting certain
difficulty requirements)."
'I know from experience that
people don't like to watch
basketball teams or football teams
that consistently lose. These
sports have much more to offer
the spectator than gymnastics in
terms of suspense and close
competition. However, they don't
have the advantage of inherently
aesthetic performance that
gymnastics has, and therefore
must rely on scores, winning,
losing and so forth. It's interesting
to note that at our last gymnastics
meet, no scores were announced.
No one cared! The reason is, they
had seen some exciting
performances — interesting for
their own sake."

A SAMPLE OF THE ACTION—The sidehorse is one of the many gymnastic events that one can see this
weekend in Maples Pavillion as the Stanford gymnastic team faces Cal in what promises to be an exciting
meet.

GETTING READY FOR CAL—The Stanford rugby team faces Cal in
an important rugby game Saturday afternoon at home. The varsity
game starts at 1:30 p.m. and the second team game at 3:00.
One of the most interesting
athletic events on the Stanford
campus in years will take place
tomorrow night in Maples Pavilion
at 8 p.m.
Card gymnastic teams have lost
48 out of the 49 times they have
faced Berkeley squads which
consistently rank among the top
five in the nation. But tomorrow
night, however, Cal will perform
with the most talented group of
Stanford gymnasts ever assembled
and the meet should be very close.
The Bears are undefeated this
season and have not put all of
their best men on the floor yet
this year. For the Stanford meet,
Cal coach Hal Frey will have his
best gymnasts competing in the
face of the most serious challenge
his team has received this season.
Three seniors will form the
strength of the Cal squad. Minoru
Morisaki, a senior, is rated by
Stanford coach Dan Millman as
"one of the best all-around
gymnasts in the nation." Barney
Peters and Carl Satta are both
seniors and are highly regarded
all-around men. Peters took third
in the NCAA rings competition
last year.
Millman feels that Cal's
experience may be a factor in the
meet since his gymnasts are
young. "It is going to be a very
close meet that will be decided by
only a few points. Cal would have
to be classified as a slight favorite
and it would be a small upset if
we won."
Olympian Steve Hug will vie
with Morisaki for all-around
honors as will freshman Bob
Anderson. Ted Miyamoto, Hector
Neff and Howard Bessen will also
give Cal strong competition.
At 1:00 p.m. tomorrow, Cal
and Stanford will give unofficial
compulsory performances in
Maples. Compulsories are held in
big national meets and every
competitor has to perform the
same routine and be judged
accordingly.
Saturday night at 8:00 p.m. in
Maples, the two squads will
officially meet and every gymnast
will perform a routine of his
choosing.
Although the meet will be
close and the competitive aspect
exciting, the greatest attraction of
the event will be the sheer level of
artistry and accomplishment
displayed by some of the nation's

best gymasts.
Millman explains the function
of and the approach that should
be taken towards gymnastics.
