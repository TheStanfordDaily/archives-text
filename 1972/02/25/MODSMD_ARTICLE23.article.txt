# Christiansen Picks Coaches
## 
### 
Head Stanford football coach
Jack Christiansen completed the
task of rebuilding the Indian's
depleted coaching staff
Wednesday with the appointment
of Norb Hecker and Bob Jones as
assistant coaches.
Hecker coached the Atlanta
Falcons of the National Football
League before being replaced by
fiery Norm Van Brocklin. New
Yrirk Giant's coach Alex Webster
hired Hecker as his head defensive
coach, a position which Hecker
has occupied for three years. "I'm
really thrilled to be getting into
college coaching," said Hecker, "I
have long admired Jack
Christiansen as both a player and
a coach, and I have really been
impressed with the style of
football played at Stanford in
recent years."
Jones comes to The Farm after
a highly successful 8 year tenure
as head coach at West Valley
College in Campbell. He
established a 49-20 willing record
while capturing two league
championships as his Vikings built
the reputation as one of the most
explosive offensive aggregations in

junior college football. Jones says,
"I have been thinking of getting
back into coaching at the major
college level, and I simply
couldn't let this opportunity pass
me by." A pattern of success has
been established at Stanford and
we're going to do everything
possible to see that it continues."
Christiansen stated that Hecker
would be the defensive
coordinator, while coaching the
defensive line, and that Jones
would do likewise for the offense.
Christiansen stated, "I have
known Norb for years as both a
player and a coach, and his
credentials are among the best in
football. I am especially pleased
to be able to lure Bob Jones to
our staff, because I have admired
him for a long time."
Hecker and Jones complete

Christiansen's staff for the coming
year. Presently newcomers Pete
Kettela and George Siefert have
taken charge of recruiting
responsibilities and are mapping
plans for spring practice.
Christiansen stated that the other
newcomer Ray Handley along
with the remaining members of
last years staff, Dave Currey and
Bill Moultrie know the Stanford
scene and are superbly qualified as
coaches.
With Christiansen and Hecker
both at Stanford, it is believed
that this marks the first time two
former National Football League
head coaches will be serving on
the same college staff. Ironically
enough, Hecker and his family are
in the process of purchasing Mike
White's home on the Stanford
campus.
