# Netters Win In Tourney
## 
### 
Stanford's tennis team despite
playing without its two top
players, Roscoe Tanner and Sandy
Mayer, appears headed for the
title in the Northern California
Intercollegiate Championships at
San Jose State.
At the end of Wednesday's
singles play, six Stanford entries,
Rick Fisher, Gery Groslimond,
Jim Delaney, Paul Sidone, Rick
Evens and Chip Fisher had
advanced along with just two
others not from Stanford.
Tanner is missing from the
tournementbecause he needed to
work on a term paper due Friday,
while Mayer went home to New
Jersey for a week's visit with his
family.
