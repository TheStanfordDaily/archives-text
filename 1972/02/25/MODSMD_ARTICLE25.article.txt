Nixon Aims For Full Recognition
PEKING — After four closed-door sessions with Chou
En-lai, President Nixon was described today at aiming at
eventual restoration of full diplomatic relations between
the United States and mainland China — whatever the
repercussions in Taiwan.
An informed American source said Nixon and Henry
A. Kissinger, the President's national security affairs
adviser, are talking with Chou about big-picture issues
involved in establishing what the premier has termed
"normal state relations."
While the top American and Chinese leaders
formulated broad policy, Secretary of State William P.
Rogers, his Chinese counterpart Chi Peng-fe and their
associates were working out nuts-and-bolts questions of
how to effect summit policies.
While no U.S. officials involved in the talks would
discuss matters of substance, there was good reason to
believe Nixon and Chou had embarked on setting up
cultural exchanges, limited tourism between the two
countries, a system for handling Chinese-American trade
and means for establishing regular contacts short of full
diplomatic relations involving an exchange of
ambassadors.
While no one would talk about the means likely to be
employed in continuing the dialogue between the two
nations on a diplomatic level, there would be precedent
for establishing consular relations without setting up
embassies. Britain, for example, has recognized mainland
China for 22 years — but it continues to have a consulate
on the Nationalist Chinese island of Taiwan.
US May Recognize Bangladesh
RAWALPINDI, Pakistan The United States has told
President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto it plans to recognize
Bangladesh, informed Pakistani and American sources said
yesterday.
The sources said Bhutto was assured Washington will
not announce its recognition before the end of February.
Given this promise, they added, Bhutto raised no
objection.
The announcement presumably would not come until
after President Nixon returns from his visit to China.
Communists Boycott Talks
PARIS — North Vietnam, with a wary eye on the Peking
summit meeting, led a Communist walkout from the
Vietnam peace talks yesterday and the future of the
conference remained in doubt.

The action was said to be a protest against recent U.S.
bombings and other "extremely serious acts of war"
against North Vietnam.
But it also appeared that North Vietnam and the Viet
Cong, who joined in the walkout, wanted to underline
their independence in dealing with the United States at a
time when rumors flew that Vietnam may have been one
of the subjects discussed by President Nixon and Chinese
leaders in Peking.
Soldier Killed In Belfast
BELFAST — Terrorist snipers gunned down a British
soldier in Belfast and fire bombers blasted targets across
Northern Ireland yesterday amid fears the province's
guerrillas would step up their campaigns of violence.
In Dublin, police arrested 10 more militants of the
outlawed Irish Republican Army — IRA — in Ireland's
new crackdown on the organization which is fighting to
end the partition of Ireland.
The 10 arrested Thursday were reported to be
members of the IRA's extremist provisional wing. Eight
others, belonging to the rival official faction, were seized
in predawn police raids Wednesday.
An outlaw bomb squad destroyed the 200-year-old
City Hall at Strabane, Northern Ireland yesterday. Other
raiders shattered a Londonderry store and a car rental
firm in Belfast.
The army said 28-year-o!d trooper John Sutton was
wounded by an outlaw's bullet while patrolling the
Andersontown quarter of Belfast.
Daniel Berrigan Released
DANBURY, Conn. — Daniel Berrigan, the pacifist priest,
released from prison yesterday after serving 18 months for
destroying draft records says he will press his crusade
against the Vietnam war.
"The war is still the first fact of life for the living," he
said. "There is no issue comparable to the death of the
innocent — not the economy, not good fellowship in
China, not cancer."
But the 51-year-old Jesuit said he would shun the
methods of protest that put him in jail.
Rejecting the use of violence if it meant doing physical
and psychological damage to human beings, he said: "I
would do immense physical and psychological damage to
draft records if this were the right tactical moment, but it
is not."
Berrigan, wearing a cross made by a fellow prisoner,
appeared graying but chipper despite various illnesses as
he emerged from the prison.
