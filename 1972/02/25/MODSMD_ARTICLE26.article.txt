# Greek Ex-Minister Criticizes U.S. Policy As Imperialistic
## 
### MARCIA FRIEDMAN EMMA PRICE 
The U.S. is using Greece as a
training center for global counter
insurgency operations, exiled
economics professor and Greek
ex-minister Andreas Papandreou
charged last night at the SWOPSI
Symposium on Imperialism.
Papandreou spoke on "Greece: A
Case of U.S. Imperialism," to a
capacity audience in Cubberly
Auditorium. The speech was
co-sponsored by the International
Association and the Graduate
Economics Society.
"During the 1960'5, the main motif
for American foreign expansionism
was counter revolution and counter
insurgency," Papandreou said.
"The cases are too numerous to
mention â€” Santo Domingo,
Guatemala, all over Latin America,
Africa, Southeast Asia and Europe,"
he continued. "In fact, this period has
been a blueprint for military takeover,
out of which Greece has become the
training center for these
counterinsurgencies."
His father, the late George
Papandreou, was Premier of Greece
when the government was overthrown
in 1967 by a military junta, which has
held the country under martial law
since.
Now In Exile
Papandreou was imprisoned for a
short time and then released and
exiled. He is now a professor of
economics at York University in
Toronto, but spoke last night "not as a
professor, but as the leader of the
Panhellenic Liberation Movement,"
the worldwide organization of Greeks
who want the government returned to
its original leadership before the coup.
Papandreou explained the
counterinsurgency tactics as a part of

the Vietnamization concept
introduced by President Nixon.
"Although Vietnamization came
later, it's the same thing; the fighting
continues but not with U.S. troops,"
he said. "It means really that you get
Greeks to take over Greece for vou."
'First Vietnam'
He said most Americans would
never think of Greece as a victim of
U.S. imperialism but would instantly
think of Vietnam, where "blood has
been spilled on a massive scale."
"Actually Greece was the first
Vietnam," he said. "It was here that
napalm was first tested. The Greek
mountains are bare because of this,
not because of goats, as mythology
tells us."
The crowd laughed and he
continued: "It gave the U.S. the
opportunity to establish the extreme
right in Greece and put together a
state."
He told of the complex
involvement of the CIA in
counterinsurgency operations and the
links between the CIA and leaders of
different coups, particularly that of
Greece.
Liberation Movement
"I am committed to the Panhellenic
Liberation Movement until freedom
comes to Greece,"he concluded.

"When it does we will build a socialist
society in which human rights are
respected and citizens have the right to
participate in key decisions."
Overseas Investments
An afternoon panel discussion
focused on the topic "U.S. Business
Abroad: Development or
Exploitation?"
Stanford Economics professor Alan
Manne declared, "I didn't come here
to bury U.S. business abroad or to
praise it. I want to talk about
alternatives."
"There are countries which can live
with foreign enterprises and not be
overwhelmed by them. Examples are
Brazil, Japan, and India. I think Chile
will soon be able to deal with U.S.
corporations on these terms," he
added.
Noted radical economist Paul
Sweezy said "in underdeveloped
countries, the economy generally is
doing fine, but the people aren't."
The symposium will close today
with two panel discussions: "Is
Foreign Aid An Alternative?" at 3:15
in Bishop Auditorium with a panel of
economists and a closing panel at 7:30
p.m., "Consequences of U.S.
Imperialism in People's Lives," which
will include Banning Garret former
editor of Ramparts
