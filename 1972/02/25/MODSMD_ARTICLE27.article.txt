# Recruiting Delayed At Placement Center
## 
### BOB BACON 
A Hewlett-Packard Corporation
recruiter was delayed from entering
the Placement Center yesterday
morning and Martin-Marietta
Corporation interviewers chose not to
come as anti-war protesters once again
blocked the Center's doors.
The Hewlett-Packard
representative, Michael Green,
returned to the Center after the
demonstrators had left and conducted
his interviews without incident.
He reported that as he approached
the building about 9:45 a.m., "a
couple of demonstrators essentially
said I couldn't come in." He said he
chose not to force the issue and left
voluntarily, returning about an hour
later. Four of his interviews were
rescheduled.
Martin-Marietta representatives
were informed of the planned protest
by Center Director Ralph Keller
Wednesday night, and elected not to
come.
Gary Skartvedt, who was scheduled
to conduct 28 interviews for
Martin-Marietta yesterday and today,
did visit the campus yesterday, but did

not come to the Placement Center and
apparently did not conduct any
interviews.
About 30 demonstrators gathered
outside the Center doors at 8 a.m.
They briefly questioned several
persons entering the building,
including recruiters and interviewees
of other firms. There were no
incidents, and the Hewlett-Packard
recruiter was apparently the only
person prevented from entering.
Recruiters for the Pacific Gas and
Electric Company and Standard Oil
were among those who entered the
building while the demonstrators were
outside. They were stopped briefly but
permitted to enter.
Keller told the Daily yesterday he
felt Skartvedt would not come to the
campus this morning for the remainder
of his scheduled interviews.
Arrangements to conduct the
Martin-Marietta interviews at another
place or time have not yet been made,
according to Keller. He said that the
Placement Center staff attmepted
yesterday morning to contact those
scheduled for interviews to inform
them of Skartvedt's absence.
