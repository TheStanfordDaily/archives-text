# Davis, Lawyers Hail Release
## 
### FRED MANN 
A smiling Angela Davis, free from
jail for the first time in 16 months,
told a crowded press conference
yesterday afternoon that her release
marks the end of the era when "the
legal apparatus can . . . keep political
prisoners in jail long months before
trial. . . trying to break their will to
fight."
She said her emergence "teaches us
to intensify efforts to free all political
prisoners."
Davis was released from Palo Alto's
North Country Jail Wednesday
evening, after presiding Judge Richard
E. Arnason ruled in San Jose that she
was eligible for bail, citing the recent
State Supreme Court ruling outlawing
the use of capital punishment.
The black Communist faces
murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy
charges in a trial scheduled to begin
Monday in San Jose. The state has
charged Davis with purchasing four
guns used in the August 7, 1970
escape attempt at the Marin County
Courthouse. Four people were killed
in the ensuing shoot-out.
Facing a barrage of microphones,
TV cameras, and cramped newsmen and
women in the San Jose storefront
headquarters of the National United
Committee to Free Angela Davis, she

made a brief statement thanking,
"those beautiful people who struggled
for my freedom," then answered
questions with her attorneys.
Bound by an earlier court order
prohibiting participants from
discussing the case, Davis stated only
that she was feeling "fine — better
than I have in 16 months." Howard
Moore, Jr., Margaret Burnham, and
Doris Brin Walker, her lawyers, sat at
her side, as did her sister, Fania
Jordan. "All the members of our
family are overjoyed with Angela's
freedom," said Jordan.
American Communist Party
National Secretary Gus Hall had
planned on attending the press
conference, but his plane from New
York was delayed.
Tight Security
During the conference, supporters
of Davis stood behind her, eyeing the
mass of reporters. "There are lots of
people in this room that we don't
know," stated Franklin Alexander,
National Co-Cordinator of the
movement to free Davis. "It would be
best if no one made any quick moves
— for security reasons."
Davis said last week's ruling on the
death penalty which ultimately set her
free would not have been made
without "the struggles surrounding the

prison movement. . . the massacre at
Attica .. . and the murder of George
Jackson."
When asked how Davis and her
supporters celebrated her release
Wednesday night, Alexander smiled
and said a party of close friends had
opened a few bottles of champagne.
"And we did indeed kiss and hug each
other all night long," she added.
'Interim Victory'
Moore called Davis' release "merely
an interim victory, but a significant
0ne.... I think because of this
victory, we will have a total and
complete one when the trial is
completed."
Terms of the bail order require
Davis to reside at a location in Santa
Clara County, but her address is being
kept secret for "security purposes."
Attorney Burnham asked the press to
"respect Miss Davis' privacy and
security," by not attempting to
discover her exact whereabouts.
Davis, smiling broadly throughout
the brief conference, laughed when
asked if her release after nearly a year
and one half now made her feel
differently toward the judicial system.
"Our struggle is not to get justice from
the court," answered Moore, "but to
bring justice to the court."

Moore, Jr., Margaret Burnham, and
Doris Brin Walker, her lawyers, sat at
her side, as did her sister, Fania
Jordan. "All the members of our
family are overjoyed with Angela's
freedom," said Jordan.
American Communist Party
National Secretary Gus Hall had
planned on attending the press
conference, but his plane from New
York was delayed.
Tight Security
During the conference, supporters
of Davis stood behind her, eyeing the
mass of reporters. "There are lots of
people in this room that we don't
know," stated Franklin Alexander,
National Co-Cordinator of the
movement to free Davis. "It would be
best if no one made any quick moves
— for security reasons."
Davis said last week's ruling on the
death penalty which ultimately set her
free would not have been made
without "the struggles surrounding the

prison movement. . . the massacre at
Attica .. . and the murder of George
Jackson."
When asked how Davis and her
supporters celebrated her release
Wednesday night, Alexander smiled
and said a party of close friends had
opened a few bottles of champagne.
"And we did indeed kiss and hug each
other all night long," she added.
'Interim Victory'
Moore called Davis' release "merely
an interim victory, but a significant
0ne.... I think because of this
victory, we will have a total and
complete one when the trial is
completed."
Terms of the bail order require
Davis to reside at a location in Santa
Clara County, but her address is being
kept secret for "security purposes."
Attorney Burnham asked the press to
"respect Miss Davis' privacy and
security," by not attempting to
discover her exact whereabouts.
Davis, smiling broadly throughout
the brief conference, laughed when
asked if her release after nearly a year
and one half now made her feel
differently toward the judicial system.
"Our struggle is not to get justice from
the court," answered Moore, "but to
bring justice to the court."
A smiling Angela Davis, free from
jail for the first time in 16 months,
told a crowded press conference
yesterday afternoon that her release
marks the end of the era when "the
legal apparatus can . . . keep political
prisoners in jail long months before
trial. . . trying to break their will to
fight."
She said her emergence "teaches us
to intensify efforts to free all political
prisoners."
Davis was released from Palo Alto's
North Country Jail Wednesday
evening, after presiding Judge Richard
E. Arnason ruled in San Jose that she
was eligible for bail, citing the recent
State Supreme Court ruling outlawing
the use of capital punishment.
The black Communist faces
murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy
charges in a trial scheduled to begin
Monday in San Jose. The state has
charged Davis with purchasing four
guns used in the August 7, 1970
escape attempt at the Marin County
Courthouse. Four people were killed
in the ensuing shoot-out.
Facing a barrage of microphones,
TV cameras, and cramped newsmen and
women in the San Jose storefront
headquarters of the National United
Committee to Free Angela Davis, she

made a brief statement thanking,
"those beautiful people who struggled
for my freedom," then answered
questions with her attorneys.
Bound by an earlier court order
prohibiting participants from
discussing the case, Davis stated only
that she was feeling "fine — better
than I have in 16 months." Howard
Moore, Jr., Margaret Burnham, and
Doris Brin Walker, her lawyers, sat at
her side, as did her sister, Fania
Jordan. "All the members of our
