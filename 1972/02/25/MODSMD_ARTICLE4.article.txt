# Want Fee Assessment
## Students Propose Law Firm 
### 
A group of Stanford law students
announced yesterday at a press
conference the formation of a public
interest law firm to handle cases
ranging from civil rights to consumer
protection.
The firm, Consumer Advocates at
Stanford, Inc., says it must first get its
financial support from the student
body by means of a fee-assessment in
order to open its doors. The
organization is only partly student

run, and will be legally independent of
the University.
At the same time the organization
could become a valuable addition to
the University by assisting in courses
which deal with public interest issues,
according to Edward Hayes, president
of the Stanford Law Association and
one of those at the press conference.
Other law students present at the
conference were Barbara Dray,
president of the Legal Aid Society,
and Robert Grant, a former
co-president of the ASSU, both of
them members of a founding board for
the organization.
Hayes said Stanford provided an
especially effective base for Citizens
Advocates because of "the
broad-based, concerned and active
constituency of a university."
Effective Tool
"Thorough investigation of
problems by students, faculty, and
researchers from many disciplines can
make a public interest law firm an
effective tool for the public interest,"
Hayes added.
The firm does not plan to provide
legal aid to Stanford students,
however, and its offices will not be on
campus.
A Board of Directors, a majority of
them students, will determine the
firm's activities. According to Hayes,
"Citizens Advocates" will engage in
study, negotiation, representation, and

litigation of problems affecting the
general public."
Seeks Justice
The purpose will be to seek "to
obtain justice for and protection of
the civil rights of the poor victims of
racial, ethnic, or sex discrimination,
consumers and other persons who are
in need of effective representation in
legal matters," Hayes added.
In order to begin its activities, the
organization is depending on a student
fee-assessment to provide a large
portion of its $75,000 first-year
budget. Outside money from private
foundations, alumni and friends, and
the legal community, will eventually
provide about half of its expenses,
they say.
A referendum in the general
student election this April will draw
$2 from each student fall and winter
quarters, $1 spring and summer, if it is
passed by a two-thirds majority.
Students who oppose a payment will
be able to obtain a refund on
registration day, the organizers say.
Financial Base Needed
They will seek the assessment for a
period of three years instead of the
customary one, "because of the
absolute necessity of insuring a
financial base prior to the
commencement of any activity."
They add that major litigation will
require at least three years for
completion.
