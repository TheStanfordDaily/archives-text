# Program Changes Draw More Listeners To KZSU Radio
## 
### PATTY FELS (First of Two Parts) 
Last summer, for the first time, a college radio
station showed up on an American Research Bureau
survey of most-listened-to stations in the Bay Area.
The station was KZSU and the survey revealed
almost 12,000 off-campus listeners.
Why? How has KZSU changed from "a lot of
people playing radio station" to "an important news
source on campus."
An important factor is that there is simply more
interesting news to cover. The Applied Electronics
Laboratory sit-in (1969), the ROTC and Cambodian
protests (1970) and the Franklin hearings,
Placement Center "mill-in" and CJP controversy
(1971-72) — all have played important roles in
upping listenership.
But other things have changed too. Last summer
KZSU stayed on the air 24 hours a day. Working
with only 12 people the station built a solid
off-campus audience, receiving a surprising amount
of listener response.
Another big boost came last January when the
station's antenna was moved from the top of
Memorial Auditorium up into the hills. Power
increased from 10 to 40 watts and the broadcasting
area became much larger. KZSU used to reach only
Stanford and parts of the surrounding communities;
now it can be picked up as far away as Berkeley.
And another big power increase may be coming
soon.
With the increased popularity and listenership
have come some not-so-pleasant results. In the
spring of 1970 the FCC complained about the
obscenities picked up during riot coverage while
members of the more radical movements objected

to having their plans broadcasted for possible use by
the police. This year, too, there were questions
whether KZSU should have been allowed to stay at
the Ellsberg speech and at a Cubberley strategy
meeting which followed the Old Union sit-in in
January.
Serious Look
The increased attention has forced KZSU to take
a serious look at what it is broadcasting and how well
it's doing it. As station manager John Broholm put
it, "We had to be self-conscious with that many
people listening."
The first questions regarded policy. Public affairs
director Bob Fuss says, "We consider our primary
news obligation to the campus and our primary
responsibility to examine campus issues." This
policy has affected many of KZSU's recent
programming decisions. Although the Franklin trial
was not of much interest to the off-campus
audience KZSU decided to broadcast it.
News analyst Bob Lundstrom compares KZSU's
position with that of Fred Friendly who retired
because CBS didn't carry the United Nations
Vietnam hearings of 1966. CBS felt that it would
lose listenership by discontinuing regular
programming. Friendly took the position that CBS
had an obligation as a news service to do more than
hold on to its audience.
What Radio Is For
"If we lost a few listeners with the Franklin case,
we lost them," reflected Pete Williams, news
director. "There's rock music on lots of other
stations. No other station was broadcasting the CJP
and Franklin. This is what radio is for."
KZSU broadcasts on both FM and AM bands.
The AM station can be picked up only inside the

dorms which means it has almost no legal
restrictions.
In contrast, the FM station has a larger range and
consequently is subject to a large number of FCC
regulations. The FCC is quite strict about them,
making it difficult to train new people on the FM
band. Therefore, KZSU starts new workers on AM.
Entirely independent
Perhaps the most educational aspect of the
station is that it is entirely independent. There is no
advisor and no close ties with the Communication
Department as at other universities.
Broholm contrasted KZSU with its closest
competitor — KUOP of the University of the Pacific
at Stockton. While KUOP is "fantastically
powerful," it is "strictly controlled by the
university," he said.
Although KZSU's license is owned by the
Trustees, there is little friction with the
administration. "We fried Lyman on Bruce Franklin
and Lyman has since fried us," says Broholm. Still,
the administration never threatens to take control
of the station.
Public Affairs
Another question — the role of newsmen at
radical meetings — has been a sore point with KZSU
reporters. Fuss points out, "public meetings are
public meetings. You can't decide right in the
middle that it's not public anymore."
Broholm says that a minority wanted KZSU
ousted after the Ellsberg speech. "A few people
tried to fool around with the sound system and with
people who were broadcasting in the choir loft," he
explains. "But we were voted by a majority of the
audience to be allowed to remain."

ON THE AlR—Student technicians at campus radio station KZSU monitor some
of the equipment in studios in the basement of Memorial Auditorium. Recent
rises in the size of KZSU's audience has brought a rethinking of, and innovations
in its programming.
News coverage and music still draw the largest
percentage of listeners, but station officials hope the
new audience will begin to listen to public affairs
programs.
"It's a cyclical relation," says Williams. "As the
news staff gets better, people start listening to other
things. And as they get better, more people listen to
news."
The number of special programs is rapidly
increasing. This quarter there will be original radio
plays, music specials and possibly a talk show.
There are also several new public affairs
programs. One of them, "Campus Close-up," is an
interview or panel discussion with an important
Stanford personality. Guests have included
Professors John Kaplan, William Shockley and
David Harris.
"Campus Conference," a weekly program,

alternates interviews with President Lyman and
other administrators. Still in the planning stages is a
"Campus Conference" with students and faculty
members.
Too Many Lectures
Public affairs tries to avoid broadcasting too
many lectures. "Public affairs used to think that
their only job was to hang a microphone around
some professor's neck," said Williams.
The music library has also improved. At one time
broadcasters played only their own records; now the
station receives 10 albums a day from record
distributors.
Although advertising is illegal on FM radio,
KZSU has recently adopted a policy allowing
advertisers to "underwrite" shows. At the end of an
hour of music the disc jockeys announce that it was
sponsored by a certain advertiser.

Last year KZSU received a $7,500 grant from
Humanities and Sciences to build a new studio. One
studio is located on the second floor of Memorial
Auditorium, making it very inconvenient to move
equipment. The new studio will be on the ground
floor with the rest of the station. The students are
doing all the construction work and expect to have
it completed by this spring.
Naturally, a lot of problems remain. With the
expanded record library also came many more
"rip-offs." Recruiting more news personnel has been
especially difficult this year since the Franklin
activity occupied most of the experienced staffers'
time.
Still, if the frantic activity of the news staff has
meant fewer new trainees, it has meant more new
listeners. And without the audience, there would be
no need for the newscasters.

administration. "We fried Lyman on Bruce Franklin
and Lyman has since fried us," says Broholm. Still,
the administration never threatens to take control
of the station.
Public Affairs
Another question — the role of newsmen at
radical meetings — has been a sore point with KZSU
reporters. Fuss points out, "public meetings are
public meetings. You can't decide right in the
middle that it's not public anymore."
Broholm says that a minority wanted KZSU
ousted after the Ellsberg speech. "A few people
tried to fool around with the sound system and with
people who were broadcasting in the choir loft," he
explains. "But we were voted by a majority of the
audience to be allowed to remain."

ON THE AlR—Student technicians at campus radio station KZSU monitor some
of the equipment in studios in the basement of Memorial Auditorium. Recent
rises in the size of KZSU's audience has brought a rethinking of, and innovations
in its programming.
News coverage and music still draw the largest
percentage of listeners, but station officials hope the
new audience will begin to listen to public affairs
programs.
"It's a cyclical relation," says Williams. "As the
news staff gets better, people start listening to other
things. And as they get better, more people listen to
news."
The number of special programs is rapidly
increasing. This quarter there will be original radio
plays, music specials and possibly a talk show.
There are also several new public affairs
programs. One of them, "Campus Close-up," is an
interview or panel discussion with an important
Stanford personality. Guests have included
Professors John Kaplan, William Shockley and
David Harris.
"Campus Conference," a weekly program,

alternates interviews with President Lyman and
other administrators. Still in the planning stages is a
"Campus Conference" with students and faculty
members.
Too Many Lectures
Public affairs tries to avoid broadcasting too
many lectures. "Public affairs used to think that
their only job was to hang a microphone around
some professor's neck," said Williams.
The music library has also improved. At one time
broadcasters played only their own records; now the
station receives 10 albums a day from record
distributors.
Although advertising is illegal on FM radio,
KZSU has recently adopted a policy allowing
advertisers to "underwrite" shows. At the end of an
hour of music the disc jockeys announce that it was
sponsored by a certain advertiser.

Last year KZSU received a $7,500 grant from
Humanities and Sciences to build a new studio. One
studio is located on the second floor of Memorial
Auditorium, making it very inconvenient to move
equipment. The new studio will be on the ground
floor with the rest of the station. The students are
doing all the construction work and expect to have
it completed by this spring.
Naturally, a lot of problems remain. With the
expanded record library also came many more
"rip-offs." Recruiting more news personnel has been
especially difficult this year since the Franklin
activity occupied most of the experienced staffers'
time.
Still, if the frantic activity of the news staff has
meant fewer new trainees, it has meant more new
listeners. And without the audience, there would be
no need for the newscasters.
Last summer, for the first time, a college radio
station showed up on an American Research Bureau
survey of most-listened-to stations in the Bay Area.
The station was KZSU and the survey revealed
almost 12,000 off-campus listeners.
Why? How has KZSU changed from "a lot of
people playing radio station" to "an important news
source on campus."
An important factor is that there is simply more
interesting news to cover. The Applied Electronics
Laboratory sit-in (1969), the ROTC and Cambodian
protests (1970) and the Franklin hearings,
Placement Center "mill-in" and CJP controversy
(1971-72) — all have played important roles in
upping listenership.
But other things have changed too. Last summer
KZSU stayed on the air 24 hours a day. Working
with only 12 people the station built a solid
off-campus audience, receiving a surprising amount
of listener response.
Another big boost came last January when the
station's antenna was moved from the top of
Memorial Auditorium up into the hills. Power
increased from 10 to 40 watts and the broadcasting
area became much larger. KZSU used to reach only
Stanford and parts of the surrounding communities;
now it can be picked up as far away as Berkeley.
And another big power increase may be coming
soon.
With the increased popularity and listenership
have come some not-so-pleasant results. In the
spring of 1970 the FCC complained about the
obscenities picked up during riot coverage while
members of the more radical movements objected

to having their plans broadcasted for possible use by
the police. This year, too, there were questions
whether KZSU should have been allowed to stay at
the Ellsberg speech and at a Cubberley strategy
meeting which followed the Old Union sit-in in
January.
Serious Look
The increased attention has forced KZSU to take
a serious look at what it is broadcasting and how well
it's doing it. As station manager John Broholm put
it, "We had to be self-conscious with that many
people listening."
The first questions regarded policy. Public affairs
director Bob Fuss says, "We consider our primary
news obligation to the campus and our primary
responsibility to examine campus issues." This
policy has affected many of KZSU's recent
programming decisions. Although the Franklin trial
was not of much interest to the off-campus
audience KZSU decided to broadcast it.
News analyst Bob Lundstrom compares KZSU's
position with that of Fred Friendly who retired
because CBS didn't carry the United Nations
Vietnam hearings of 1966. CBS felt that it would
lose listenership by discontinuing regular
programming. Friendly took the position that CBS
had an obligation as a news service to do more than
hold on to its audience.
What Radio Is For
"If we lost a few listeners with the Franklin case,
we lost them," reflected Pete Williams, news
director. "There's rock music on lots of other
stations. No other station was broadcasting the CJP
and Franklin. This is what radio is for."
KZSU broadcasts on both FM and AM bands.
The AM station can be picked up only inside the

dorms which means it has almost no legal
restrictions.
In contrast, the FM station has a larger range and
consequently is subject to a large number of FCC
regulations. The FCC is quite strict about them,
making it difficult to train new people on the FM
band. Therefore, KZSU starts new workers on AM.
Entirely independent
Perhaps the most educational aspect of the
station is that it is entirely independent. There is no
advisor and no close ties with the Communication
Department as at other universities.
Broholm contrasted KZSU with its closest
competitor — KUOP of the University of the Pacific
at Stockton. While KUOP is "fantastically
powerful," it is "strictly controlled by the
university," he said.
Although KZSU's license is owned by the
Trustees, there is little friction with the
administration. "We fried Lyman on Bruce Franklin
and Lyman has since fried us," says Broholm. Still,
the administration never threatens to take control
of the station.

KZSU stayed on the air 24 hours a day. Working
with only 12 people the station built a solid
off-campus audience, receiving a surprising amount
of listener response.
Another big boost came last January when the
station's antenna was moved from the top of
Memorial Auditorium up into the hills. Power
increased from 10 to 40 watts and the broadcasting
area became much larger. KZSU used to reach only
Stanford and parts of the surrounding communities;
now it can be picked up as far away as Berkeley.
And another big power increase may be coming
soon.
With the increased popularity and listenership
have come some not-so-pleasant results. In the
spring of 1970 the FCC complained about the
obscenities picked up during riot coverage while
members of the more radical movements objected

to having their plans broadcasted for possible use by
the police. This year, too, there were questions
whether KZSU should have been allowed to stay at
the Ellsberg speech and at a Cubberley strategy
meeting which followed the Old Union sit-in in
January.
Serious Look
The increased attention has forced KZSU to take
a serious look at what it is broadcasting and how well
it's doing it. As station manager John Broholm put
it, "We had to be self-conscious with that many
people listening."
The first questions regarded policy. Public affairs
director Bob Fuss says, "We consider our primary
news obligation to the campus and our primary
responsibility to examine campus issues." This
policy has affected many of KZSU's recent
programming decisions. Although the Franklin trial
was not of much interest to the off-campus
audience KZSU decided to broadcast it.
News analyst Bob Lundstrom compares KZSU's
position with that of Fred Friendly who retired
because CBS didn't carry the United Nations
Vietnam hearings of 1966. CBS felt that it would
lose listenership by discontinuing regular
programming. Friendly took the position that CBS
had an obligation as a news service to do more than
hold on to its audience.
What Radio Is For
"If we lost a few listeners with the Franklin case,
we lost them," reflected Pete Williams, news
director. "There's rock music on lots of other
stations. No other station was broadcasting the CJP
and Franklin. This is what radio is for."
KZSU broadcasts on both FM and AM bands.
The AM station can be picked up only inside the

dorms which means it has almost no legal
restrictions.
In contrast, the FM station has a larger range and
consequently is subject to a large number of FCC
regulations. The FCC is quite strict about them,
making it difficult to train new people on the FM
band. Therefore, KZSU starts new workers on AM.
Entirely independent
Perhaps the most educational aspect of the
station is that it is entirely independent. There is no
advisor and no close ties with the Communication
Department as at other universities.
Broholm contrasted KZSU with its closest
competitor — KUOP of the University of the Pacific
at Stockton. While KUOP is "fantastically
powerful," it is "strictly controlled by the
university," he said.
Although KZSU's license is owned by the
Trustees, there is little friction with the
administration. "We fried Lyman on Bruce Franklin
and Lyman has since fried us," says Broholm. Still,
the administration never threatens to take control
of the station.
Public Affairs
Another question — the role of newsmen at
radical meetings — has been a sore point with KZSU
reporters. Fuss points out, "public meetings are
public meetings. You can't decide right in the
middle that it's not public anymore."
Broholm says that a minority wanted KZSU
ousted after the Ellsberg speech. "A few people
tried to fool around with the sound system and with
people who were broadcasting in the choir loft," he
explains. "But we were voted by a majority of the
audience to be allowed to remain."

ON THE AlR—Student technicians at campus radio station KZSU monitor some
of the equipment in studios in the basement of Memorial Auditorium. Recent
rises in the size of KZSU's audience has brought a rethinking of, and innovations
in its programming.
News coverage and music still draw the largest
percentage of listeners, but station officials hope the
new audience will begin to listen to public affairs
programs.
"It's a cyclical relation," says Williams. "As the
news staff gets better, people start listening to other
things. And as they get better, more people listen to
news."
The number of special programs is rapidly
increasing. This quarter there will be original radio
plays, music specials and possibly a talk show.
There are also several new public affairs
programs. One of them, "Campus Close-up," is an
interview or panel discussion with an important
Stanford personality. Guests have included
Professors John Kaplan, William Shockley and
David Harris.
"Campus Conference," a weekly program,

alternates interviews with President Lyman and
other administrators. Still in the planning stages is a
"Campus Conference" with students and faculty
members.
Too Many Lectures
Public affairs tries to avoid broadcasting too
many lectures. "Public affairs used to think that
their only job was to hang a microphone around
some professor's neck," said Williams.
The music library has also improved. At one time
broadcasters played only their own records; now the
station receives 10 albums a day from record
distributors.
Although advertising is illegal on FM radio,
KZSU has recently adopted a policy allowing
advertisers to "underwrite" shows. At the end of an
hour of music the disc jockeys announce that it was
sponsored by a certain advertiser.

Last year KZSU received a $7,500 grant from
Humanities and Sciences to build a new studio. One
studio is located on the second floor of Memorial
Auditorium, making it very inconvenient to move
equipment. The new studio will be on the ground
floor with the rest of the station. The students are
doing all the construction work and expect to have
it completed by this spring.
Naturally, a lot of problems remain. With the
expanded record library also came many more
"rip-offs." Recruiting more news personnel has been
especially difficult this year since the Franklin
activity occupied most of the experienced staffers'
time.
Still, if the frantic activity of the news staff has
meant fewer new trainees, it has meant more new
listeners. And without the audience, there would be
no need for the newscasters.
Last summer, for the first time, a college radio
station showed up on an American Research Bureau
survey of most-listened-to stations in the Bay Area.
The station was KZSU and the survey revealed
almost 12,000 off-campus listeners.
Why? How has KZSU changed from "a lot of
people playing radio station" to "an important news
source on campus."
An important factor is that there is simply more
interesting news to cover. The Applied Electronics
Laboratory sit-in (1969), the ROTC and Cambodian
protests (1970) and the Franklin hearings,
Placement Center "mill-in" and CJP controversy
(1971-72) — all have played important roles in
upping listenership.
