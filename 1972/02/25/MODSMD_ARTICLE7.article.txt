## Experts Reject Shockley Theory

Ordinarily, it would bo a
mistake to help to advertise a
wrong "thinking exercise" and
scientific theory. In the present
circumstances, and also
considering that other members of
the Genetics Department are
repeatedly asked for information
on the subject raised by Dr. W.
Shockley in a paid advertisement
(appearing in the Daily of
February 2), I feel compelled to
give to your readers some
annotated references to papers
that may be useful in developing a
more balanced point of view.
Professor Walter Bodmer (once
at Stanford, now Professor of
Genetics at Oxford) and 1 have
written an article on "Intelligence
and Race" in Scientific American
(October 1970, pp. 19-29). In an
exchange of letters that followed

the publication of that article
(Scientific American, January
1971, pp. 6-9) that may be
entertaining and instructive to
read, the validity of one approach
suggested by Shockley and by
others (the correlation between
degree of racial admixture and
mean IQ) has already been
criticized. Very recently T.E.
Reed (whose data were used by
Shockley) has further challenged
the validity of Shockley's analysis
(Proc. Nat. Acad. Sciences, 68:
3168, Dec. 1971).
As for the area of "tabooed
research" mentioned by Dr.
Shockley, racial differences in
brain anatomy: in the article
"Brain-size, grey matter and race
— fact or fiction", Phillip. V.
Tobias (American Journal of
Physical Anthropology 32: 3-26,

1970) critically analyzes existing
data and concludes that none of
the claims put forward to date on
the racial differences in brain-size
or structure are valid.
Dr. Shockley seems
uninterested in the facts showing
that in behavior the environment
is extremely important. Because
of cultural and social inheritance,
the effects of the environment are
almost inextricably confounded
with those of the genetic
background, and it is this which
makes genetic studies of human
behavior difficult and full of
traps. The reader may find useful
the recent book by Rosenthal,
Genetic Theory and Abnormal
Behavior (McGraw-Hill, 1970).
This book emphasizes the study
of the role of genetics in mental
disease and antisocial behavior, but
keeps a balanced view and shows
that the evidence in favor of the
importance of environmental
effects is usually overwhelming.
It may be useful to mention a
few facts relevant to IQ: twins
average about 5 IQ points and
triplets 8-1/2 (+2) IQ points less
than non-twins. These and similar
observations are hard to explain
on the basis of genetics. In a
recent discussion with Dr.
Shockley, he asked me to send a
reference on this topic, which I

have done. As he has not
acknowledged receiving it, I will
give it again here both for him and
for the readers of the Daily: "An
investigation of the difference in
measured intelligence between
twins and single births," R.G.
Record, T. McKeown and J.H.
Edwards, Annals of Human
Genetics 34: 11-20, 1970. A later
article by T. McKeown and R.G.
Record ("Early environmental
influences on the development of
intelligence", 1971, British
Medical Bulletin, 27: 48-52)
summarizes the situation as
follows: "The respective
contributions of hereditary and
environmental influences to
variation in measured intelligence
are still unknown."
An old, but presumably still
valid, study on the effect of
adoption on IQ shows that
children of mothers whose IQ is
low (85), when adopted into
normal families, developed IQ's of
about 106, that is above the
general mean (Skodak and Skeels,
1949, "A final follow up study of
100 adopted children", Journal of
Genetic Psychology, 75: 85-125).
It should be noted that factors
such as the effect of adoption on
the average IQ simply do not
enter into measures of heritability
as carried out by standard

»/
correlation coefficients, which are
insensitive to changes in averages.
On the invalidity of the
conclusions by Jensen on which
Dr. Shockley implicitly relies, as
well as of "Jensenism", it is
instructive to read "Race and
Intelligence" by J. Lederberg in
the Stanford Daily, October 21,
1969, and"The meaning of Dr.
Jensen's study of IQ disparity"
(Washington Post, March 29,
1969) also by J. Lederberg.
Finally, among the most recent
contributions, I would like to cite
two recent articles in Science by
S. Scarr-Salapatek ("Race, Social
Class, and IQ", Science 174:
1285-1295, December 1971;
"Unknowns in the IQ equation,
Book Reviews", Science 174:
1223-1228, December 1971),
which expose some of the errors,
both scientific and social of the
Jensen approach; and an article by
N.L. Gage in the Phi Delta
Kappan (January 1972: 308-312)
which is a good example of
studying environmental effects on
separated identical twins.
These are some of the facts and
literature that bear on this issue
which never seem to be
considered by Dr. Shockley. They
do not fit his theory.
