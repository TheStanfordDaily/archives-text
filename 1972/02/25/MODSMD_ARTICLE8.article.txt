## Vietnamese Father Encourages Son 
### 
concerned asian scholars

From a North Vietnamese father
to his son:
Tonight, in the light of the
cresecent moon, I am deeply
moved when thinking of my
youth. I had a miserable life.
Every morning I went to fetch
firewood with which to make
charcoal. I worked as a tenant
farmer when Vietnam was under
French and Japanese domination.
I was very miserable under their
yoke, and taxes were very high.
My son! How miserable the
people were! We all thought that
our lives were doomed forever.
One day, we were delighted to
hear from the neighboring hamlets
that the Party had come into
existence to lead the people in the
struggle against the French and
Japanese. Without hesitation, I
left the jungle and joined the
Party to save our people and
country. I fought hard to preserve
a legacy for the future generation.
For many years my life was
full of misery. Now, under the
guidance of the Party, I have no
fear of deep rivers, large oceans,
'hick forests with inclement
-u..e.
For the nine years of the
Resistance, I remained loyal to
our fatherland and concentrated
my efforts to struggle against the
French. You were then a mere
child. Now, my hair is all white
and it is the time for you to serve
our country under the red flag. Be
brave, and depart, on your way to
the South. Resume my fight and
dedicate your youth to our
country. I want to see you pass
over the Truong Son Cordillera
and advance bravely to the
battlefield.
When our country is finally
reunified, we will sing together
the song of peace. In the past, I

have already contributed my share
when fighting the French
aggressors. Now, in your struggle
against the U.S., you also are
going miles away from home.
Tonight, in the light of the
crescent moon, I write a few
words to you before you go.
(This letter, dated December
1969, was captured by U.S. forces
in South Vietnam.)
. .. and from an American son to
his father:
Visions of my father's war
Drift through my troubled
mind.
Was it evening then and
did he sit weaning thoughts of

death
from some tropical December
night?
Or did you, my father, imagine
a woman,
her restless, breathless voice
calling you up from your
dreams?
Did her soft hands, her
haunting eyes
find their way into the
flickering candle light?
Was it of glory you thought
while lifeless men touched
bloodied fingers
to their cold, blue lips?
Did your head and heart swell
with the cry of Victory

over so many now forgotten,
twisted dead?
And what of your father's war,
and your father's father?
Was his war like mine
savage, senseless and long?
Did their women sing a
mourning song?
Why then do men forget?
Or is it that they choose
not to remember?
The dead remember nothing.

savage, senseless and long?
Did their women sing a
mourning song?
Why then do men forget?
Or is it that they choose
not to remember?
The dead remember nothing.

From a North Vietnamese father
to his son:
Tonight, in the light of the
cresecent moon, I am deeply
moved when thinking of my
youth. I had a miserable life.
Every morning I went to fetch
firewood with which to make
charcoal. I worked as a tenant
farmer when Vietnam was under
French and Japanese domination.
I was very miserable under their
yoke, and taxes were very high.
My son! How miserable the
people were! We all thought that
our lives were doomed forever.
One day, we were delighted to
hear from the neighboring hamlets
that the Party had come into
existence to lead the people in the
struggle against the French and
Japanese. Without hesitation, I
left the jungle and joined the
Party to save our people and
country. I fought hard to preserve
a legacy for the future generation.
For many years my life was
full of misery. Now, under the
guidance of the Party, I have no
fear of deep rivers, large oceans,
'hick forests with inclement
-u..e.
For the nine years of the
Resistance, I remained loyal to
our fatherland and concentrated
my efforts to struggle against the
French. You were then a mere
child. Now, my hair is all white
and it is the time for you to serve
our country under the red flag. Be
brave, and depart, on your way to
the South. Resume my fight and
dedicate your youth to our
country. I want to see you pass
over the Truong Son Cordillera
and advance bravely to the
battlefield.
When our country is finally
reunified, we will sing together
the song of peace. In the past, I

have already contributed my share
when fighting the French
aggressors. Now, in your struggle
against the U.S., you also are
going miles away from home.
Tonight, in the light of the
crescent moon, I write a few
words to you before you go.
(This letter, dated December
1969, was captured by U.S. forces
in South Vietnam.)
. .. and from an American son to
his father:
Visions of my father's war
Drift through my troubled
mind.
Was it evening then and
did he sit weaning thoughts of

death
from some tropical December
night?
Or did you, my father, imagine
a woman,
her restless, breathless voice
calling you up from your
dreams?
Did her soft hands, her
haunting eyes
find their way into the
flickering candle light?
Was it of glory you thought
while lifeless men touched
bloodied fingers
to their cold, blue lips?
Did your head and heart swell
with the cry of Victory

over so many now forgotten,
twisted dead?
And what of your father's war,
and your father's father?
Was his war like mine
savage, senseless and long?
Did their women sing a
mourning song?
Why then do men forget?
Or is it that they choose
not to remember?
The dead remember nothing.
