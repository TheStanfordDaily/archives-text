Editor, THE DAILY:
Recently a group of foreign
physicians and medical workers in
Vietnam angrily blasted the
United States government because
the monthly civilian war casualties
of between 3,000 and 4,000 are
receiving inadequate medical
treatment because the U.S. has
reduced medical assistance to
Vietnam. In a letter to both
President Nixon and the American
Medical Association Dr. John
Champlin, head of this group,
stated that the hospitals in
Vietnam are more overcrowded
this year than last.
Among the hospitals that have
been receiving some aid funds and
now are receiving much less is the
Children's Hospital in Saigon
created in 1968 to treat the
thousands of injured and maimed
children of Vietnam. The work of

this hospital will be shown on
NBC-TV's chronology the evening
of February 25th. This film made
by Pierre Gaisseau, the French
filmmaker whose 'The Sky
Above—the Mud Below" won the
1961 Oscar for documentaries,
was shown in Canada January
10th, but it is just now that any
U.S. TV network has shown the
courage to present it.
If after viewing this film any of
you would care to help the work
of this Children's Hospital, please
either contact me directly or give
a check to one of the women who
will be collecting in White Plaza,
Monday, February 28th or send
the check directly to The
Children's Medical Relief
International, 228 E. 48th St.,
New York, N.Y. 10017. As Tom
Miller, the executive director of
CMRI and a Stanford University
Law School Graduate of 1965,
says"It just has to be harder to
bomb them if you know them as
people!"

Wednesday's article covering

the so-called "pro-DoD" rally
failed to mention what was
probably the most important
speech at that rally, one given by
a student from Nationalist China.
At a time when the media is
beseiging us with stories and
commentaries about President
Nixon's visit to Peking — a visit
that is certainly useful in its
intent, although not necessarily in
its result — it might be worthwhile
to recall the nature of the
government on Mainland China.
This was the purpose of the
speech by the Nationalist Chinese
Also, for what it's worth, the
caption beneath the photograph
of me was extremely misleading.
It implied that I favor, without
reservation, the presence of the
Department of Defense at
Stanford. I do not. DoD
represents a strong tie between
the University and the federal
government which I would like to
see weakened. I was asked to
speak at the rally on behalf of
open recruiting at the Placement
Center, and I confined my talk to
that subject. Chris Hocker
