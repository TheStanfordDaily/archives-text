# KZSU Joins College Network

"He's only a sophomore?"
That has to be the most frequently asked
question about Pete Williams. Most people figure
he's a senior or at least a junior. Of course, that's
understandable since Williams is KZSU news
director — the highest position on the news staff.
Williams joined the staff in the fall of 1970 and
worked on a Friday evening news program which
station manager John Broholm described as "by far
the best put-together show we had that quarter." In
late fall Williams became assistant news director for
winter quarter.
"We'd just sit around in amazement watching
Pete," said Broholm. "He ran things extremely well.
By spring quarter it was just a foregone conclusion
that he would become news director."
What has Williams done this year? "Technically
he's tightened things up just incredibly," said
Broholm. But his biggest contribution is the
creation of the Pacific Coast Radio Network
(PCRN). Broholm calls it "Pete's brainchild."
College Radio Network
The PCRN is a network of five college radio
stations — KLA from UCLA, KSCB from the
University of California at Santa Barbara, KDVS
from the University of California at Davis, KALX
from Berkeley and KZSU. Several other stations
make occasional contributions.
The network's function is to increase news
communication among the five campuses. Three
times a week the four UC campuses get on the free
UC tieline. Then Berkeley calls Stanford. Each

station plays selected taped stories over the line and
the others record simultaneously.
The stories are chosen on the basis of their
general interest to all the campuses. Sometimes one
campus is the sole reporter for a specific news story,
such as the Angela Davis trial, which KZSU is
covering for the others.
"Normally a Stanford story that goes out to the
network is extremely different from the typical
KZSU broadcast," said Williams. "We can't just
throw initials like CJP around. We usually have to
do more backgrounding."
Two Stories
Although the other stations often have no
stories, KZSU usually has two; the Angela Davis
story and another lead. "We always try to send
something," Williams explained. "We figure that for
this thing to work people have to feed something."
In the case of fast-breaking news the reporter will
go on the line live but generally the stories are
pre-recorded.
Although the idea of a college network had been
in the minds of newscasters for the last four years, it
had always "fallen flatly on its face," according to
Williams. To cover the student strike during the
Cambodian invasion of 1970 a nationwide ham
operated network was set up between the East and
West Coasts, but it died after the strike was over.
Trying to keep it together, the West Coast
colleges held a conference at Stanford last spring.
They decided that the network should exchange
only news stories, unlike the Ivy League Network,
which exchanges sports broadcasts. The initial idea
was to feed all stories to a "flagship station" at

Sacramento which would edit the best stories and
release a regular broadcast.
Editorial Control
The other stations opposed the idea. "We didn't
want editorial control at another station," Williams
explained. "We wanted to use their stories on their
own merits. Also we knew that Sacramento would
be wasting a lot of time on the format." Under the
present system "no one single person can mess
things up," he added.
Another conference was held at Berkeley this fall
and plans for the network were completed.
Some of the network stories are used on the
regular KZSU newscast now, and soon there will be
a round-up devoted exclusively to network news.
Williams minimizes his part in the creation of the
network. "I've been behind it all the way but 1
wouldn't want to take credit for it,"he said.
Broholm explained that although the initial idea
existed long ago that it was Williams who "pushed
for it and really made it work."
Other Changes
Under Williams the news department has
undergone other changes. Rather than a few long
newscasts there are many 15-minute ones
throughout the day. The pressure to keep them to a
specific length is gone. "On a slow day we're not
going to try to crank out 15 minutes of news,"
Williams said.
The staff has also created the "news editorial."
Unlike a general KZSU editorial, the news editorial
is "more or less a product of the news department,"
according to Williams. KZSU News is working to
