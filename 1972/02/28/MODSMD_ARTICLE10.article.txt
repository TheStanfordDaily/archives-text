Fallacious Reasoning
Editor, THE DAILY:
One of the major difficulties in
constructing an acceptable reply
to Mr. Paul Robert's recent letter,
and to the advertisement recently
lodged in the Daily by Professor
Shockley's organization, is that
one has to resort to science.
Obviously this line of attack has
far less appeal to the polemicist
who would have his evocative
phrases gobbled up by the
untrained and uncritical.
One of the major pitfalls in
Shockley's reasoning can be stated
quite concisely. I refer to the fact
that published heritability
estimates for quantitative
characters (such as IQ) are
calculated either within Caucasian
or within Black populations. The
environmental component
contributing to, say, IQ has not
been shown to be the same in the
two populations. Therefore it is
fallacious reasoning to extrapolate
from the estimates obtained
within the separate populations to
inference between the
populations.
There are numerous courses, at
various levels of statistical
sophistication, presently given on
this campus which expand on the
above and other points. I
recommend that Mr. Roberts

commence with Biology 1.

I am writing in response to
your article in the Feb. 22 Daily
about Lee Schafer (Mr.
Good-Guy) and his resignation
from the staff at Tresidder.
Not only did Mr. Schafer treat
the workers like tools, but
actually despised the ones whose
color is not white.
I was talking with a cashier the
other day and she over-heard
Schafer talking to another
supervisor. Schafer was heard to
say in reference to Cruz Salgado
also mentioned in the article.)
that he should be "tarred and
feathered and sent back to
Mexico."
Cruz is undoubtedly one of the
"few" who are, according to
Schafer "unhappy .. . they just
want to screw around and receive
a paycheck." I have known Cruz
for over a year now and he is one
of the hardest workers around. No
one can be expected to do
everything one way and Cruz gets
his work done well whether it's
the exact way that Schafer would

approve of.
If the above comment is true
of what racist Schafer feels about
black and brown people then all
six or so of the black or brown
people at Tresidder have won a
real victory in his resignation.
Good-bye Mr. Good-guy and
good riddance!

A member of Junipero House
has recently been tried under the
interim campus judicial
proceedings.
This incident has provoked the
members of the Junipero House
Council to examine the structure
of the present judicial
proceedings. We have
unanimously agreed that the
system runs contrary to the
principles of American justice by
violating the tradition of an
independent judiciary.
Not only does the President
appoint the prosecutor, but the
President also appoints the
Chairman of the Campus Judicial
Panel who holds the tie-breaking
vote, and the findings of the

Campus Judicial Panel are merely
recommendations to the
President, who retains the power
to make the final decision.
We strongly believe that the
Committee of Fifteen should
fulfill its duty and in the very near
future recommend a more
equitable and permanent campus
judicial system.
In the meantime, we oppose
the trial of a member of our
community under the existing
judicial system.

One of the major difficulties in
constructing an acceptable reply
to Mr. Paul Robert's recent letter,
and to the advertisement recently
lodged in the Daily by Professor
Shockley's organization, is that
one has to resort to science.
Obviously this line of attack has
far less appeal to the polemicist
who would have his evocative
phrases gobbled up by the
untrained and uncritical.
One of the major pitfalls in
Shockley's reasoning can be stated
quite concisely. I refer to the fact
that published heritability
estimates for quantitative
characters (such as IQ) are
calculated either within Caucasian
or within Black populations. The
environmental component
contributing to, say, IQ has not
been shown to be the same in the
two populations. Therefore it is
fallacious reasoning to extrapolate
from the estimates obtained
within the separate populations to
inference between the
populations.
There are numerous courses, at
various levels of statistical
sophistication, presently given on
this campus which expand on the
above and other points. I
recommend that Mr. Roberts

commence with Biology 1.

I am writing in response to
your article in the Feb. 22 Daily
about Lee Schafer (Mr.
Good-Guy) and his resignation
from the staff at Tresidder.
Not only did Mr. Schafer treat
the workers like tools, but
actually despised the ones whose
color is not white.
I was talking with a cashier the
other day and she over-heard
Schafer talking to another
supervisor. Schafer was heard to
say in reference to Cruz Salgado
also mentioned in the article.)
that he should be "tarred and
feathered and sent back to
Mexico."
Cruz is undoubtedly one of the
"few" who are, according to
Schafer "unhappy .. . they just
want to screw around and receive
a paycheck." I have known Cruz
for over a year now and he is one
of the hardest workers around. No
one can be expected to do
everything one way and Cruz gets
his work done well whether it's
the exact way that Schafer would

approve of.
If the above comment is true
of what racist Schafer feels about
black and brown people then all
six or so of the black or brown
people at Tresidder have won a
real victory in his resignation.
Good-bye Mr. Good-guy and
good riddance!

A member of Junipero House
has recently been tried under the
interim campus judicial
proceedings.
This incident has provoked the
members of the Junipero House
Council to examine the structure
of the present judicial
proceedings. We have
unanimously agreed that the
system runs contrary to the
principles of American justice by
violating the tradition of an
independent judiciary.
Not only does the President
appoint the prosecutor, but the
President also appoints the
Chairman of the Campus Judicial
Panel who holds the tie-breaking
vote, and the findings of the

Campus Judicial Panel are merely
recommendations to the
President, who retains the power
to make the final decision.
We strongly believe that the
Committee of Fifteen should
fulfill its duty and in the very near
future recommend a more
equitable and permanent campus
judicial system.
In the meantime, we oppose
the trial of a member of our
community under the existing
judicial system.
