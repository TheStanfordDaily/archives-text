## Law Firm Can Provide Voice 
### 
citizen advocates

A growing number of students
feel it is no longer possible for
them to play a positive role within
our society. While racism,
poverty, sexism and pollution
continue to plague our country,
more students seem to have
resigned themselves to the role of
hapless consumers of programs
and policies over which they have
no control. We believe this current
student acquiescence is
premature. Avenues still exist
through which students can
become an effective force for
change.
We are soliciting the student
body for support of a public
interest law firm, Citizens
Advocates at Stanford, Inc.
Citizens Advocates will be a

tax-exempt, non-profit law firm
with no direct legal association
with the University, but funded
primarily through a refundable fee
assessment. The firm would
engage in study, negotiation,
representation and litigation of
problems affecting the general
public. Its work would include aid
to the poor, civil rights litigation
and activities furthering neglected
interests common to all groups.
Increased Demands
Public interest law firms have
been established in a number of
larger cities in recent years as a
response to several developments.
The growth of organized and
politically sensitive groups have
placed increased demands on our
society and its legal systems. At
the same time recent court
decisions expanding substantive
and procedural legal guarantees
have made the courts a hopeful
place on which to focus energies
for change. Professor Anthony
Amsterdam of the Law School,
for example, recently was
instrumental in persuading the
California Supreme -Court to
abolish capital punishment as
cruel and unusual punishment,
encouraging our belief that when
hope of influencing the legislature
dies we can look to the courts as
protectors of the Constitution and
its guarantees.
We believe that the student
body should make this type of
advocacy possible here. A
university with its naturally
broad, concerned, and active
constituency offers a public
interest firm a strong and effective
base for support. Investigation of

problems by students, faculty and
researchers from many disciplines
can significantly feed the work of
a public interest firm. In turn,
student and faculty research
channeled through the firm can be
used to effect real change. For
example, the presence of a public
interest firm would assure that the
work of a SWOPSI course does
not die a pile of statistics
unknown to any beyond those
who collected them. Through
participation in the firm's
activities, students may gain
practical research skills as well as
affect the decision-making
processes of government and
society.
The firm might undertake ahy
of the following work:
1. Civil Liberties. Students are
generally familiar with problems
of race and sex discrimination in
employment practices. A public
interest law firm recently won a
case invalidating the written test
for fireman jobs in San Francisco
because such tests discriminate
against racial minorities.
2. Poverty Law. Recent federal
regulations limit food stamp
eligibility to single family units.
These new regulations disqualify
many persons of limited income
who share accommodations
because they are poor. A public
interest law firm could determine
if such regulations are subject to
legal attack.
3. Environmental Litigation.
The San Mateo coast line is
experiencing great pressure from
developers at this time. Additional
legal action is likely to be
necessary to protect and preserve

the ecological balance of this
valuable recreation area. The
proposed "Kaiser Plan" to collect
all Bay Area sewage at Redwood
City and pump it over the
mountains to the sea has many
critics. A study of this plan may
reveal the necessity for litigation
â€” an ideal opportunity for joint
action through SWOPSI and the
public interest law firm.
4. Consumer Protection. The
California Public Utilities
Commission oversees the activities
of all state-granted monopolies in
the public utilities area. A recent
California Supreme Court decision
invalidated a rate increase for
Pacific Telephone on the grounds
that the company misrepresented
the facts. This suggests a need to
probe the procedures and
decision-making criteria of the
Commission and to seek
appropriate relief for the public
where the facts justify such
action.
These are examples of the type
of work which needs to be done.
But we want to emphasize the
fact that the Board of Directors of
Citizens Advocates will determine
the nature of the litigation the
firm undertakes. This Board will
be composed of a majority of
students. Since the student
members on the Board will be
elected by the student body,
students will have a direct
influence over the work of the
firm.

Stanford Imw students. A second

the proposal will appear torn mor
