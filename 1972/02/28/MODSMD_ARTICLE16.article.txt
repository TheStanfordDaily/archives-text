# Experimental Course Set

### 
A new experiment course,
"Modern Western History Thru
The Film," History 35, designed
by Associate Professor Mark
Mancall, History Department, will
be offered this Spring Quarter.
While the scope of the course will
be similar to the traditional survey
of modern western civilization
(nineteenth and twentieth
centuries), the method of
presentation will be through films,
both feature and documentary,
rather than classroom lecture.
Each film will be studied for its
significance as an historical
statement as well as examined for
useful information about the
period. A syllabus of required and
recommended readings will
complement the films. The
enrollment will be limited to 100
freshmen and sophomore

students.
The course will meet a total of
three times each week. Films will
be shown on Monday and
Wednesday evenings, beginning at
7:30, in room 214, History
Department. Each student will be
required to attend a section
meeting. Sections will meet at
2:15 Thursday afternoons for one
hour and a half, unless special
section arrangements are made.
Four units of credit are offered
for the course. The course may be
taken for a grade or for pass/no
credit. Two short papers or one
long one will be required. The
first class meeting, an
introductory discussion and the
first film, will be held on
Registration Day evening,
Monday, March 28, 7:30,
room 214.
