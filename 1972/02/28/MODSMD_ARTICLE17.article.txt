# Hug Top Man
## Gymnasts Edged 
### DOUG WILSON 
Stanford's freshman- and sophomore-dominated gymnastics team
demonstrated before an estimated 3,000 spectators Saturday evening
why coach Dan Millman considers his squad one of the nation's
potential powers, as the Indian gymnasts were narrowly defeated by
UC-Berkeley, currently one of the strongest teams in the country.
The Bears managed to edge the Indians by a margin of 1.05 points,
winning the meet 158.15-157.05; none of the Cal seniors competing
for all-around honors, however, could best the point total of
Stanford's super-sophomore, Steve Hug, who accumulated a total of
53.8 points.
Hug, teammates Bob Anderson and Howard Bessen, and Minoru
Morisaki and Carl Satta of Berkeley dazzled the record crowd (for
gymnastics) at Maples with outstanding performances in vaulting, on
the rings, parallel and high bars, and in floor exercise. No performer
broke the nine-point barrier in the side horse.
Millman Pulls Stunt
Millman, who opened the meet with a trampoline exhibition
highlighted by a triple flip, expressed his pleasure at the high quality
of the performances by both teams. "We improved 5 points over our
last team score," he said, "and we should be able to show our
potential for even better scores at the Pac-8 Championships next
month. Berkeley, of course, has an excellent team, and we always
enjoy competing against them."
The enjoyment was probably heightened by the neck-and-neck
score, settled in Berkeley's favor only at the end of the high bar event,
as Morisaki, Charles Glass and Barney Peters each scored 9.0. The high
bar, however, was a matter of one fine performer topping another, as
Steve Hug earned the event high of 9.4 points. He had been
immediately preceeded by Anderson, who has become a crowd
favorite; the Stanford freshman left the performing arena to the wild
applause of the spectators, and a score of 9.25.
Hug Provides High Point
Hug's nearly-flawless parallel bar performance, perhaps tlie high
point of his evening's work, earned him a 9.5 victory over Barney
Peters of Berkeley; the Cal senior was second, with 9.0 points.
Morisaki managed to outpoint Anderson in the event by
five-hundredths of a point, for an 8.95 third place.
Brad Moses of Berkeley was the only gymnast to crack the 9-plus
mark in vaulting, defeating Stanford's Shawn Skerrett, 9.1-8.9. Hug
placed third in the event, with an 8.8 point total.
Sophomore Howard Bessen led Stanford rings competitors with a
9.2 performance, a tenth of a point behind Peters, and two tenths
behind winner Carl Satta of Berkeley, whose routine earned him the
second-highest point accumulation of the evening.
Mark Adams, a Cal senior, won the side horse with 8.95 points, to
Hug's 8.6 total; the latter was considered amazing in light of the fact
that the Stanford gymnast was penalized one full point for losing his
grip on the horse, making necessary a second start. Hector Neff of
Stanford was third with 7.75 points.
Morisaki Wins Floor Ex
Morisaki's fantastically lithe floor exercise routine resulted in his
9.35 victory over Bob Anderson (9.1) and teammate Brad Moses
(9.05).
Of his top performers, Millman commented: "Hug is not yet in top
shape, but he showed, in spots, flairs of his Olympic talents; I believe
he will demonstrate in the nationals why he is this country's top
gymnast. Anderson will be a national phenomenon very soon; as a
freshman, he is just fantastic. Bessen is probably the top rings
competitor in the Pacific-8, counting compulsories and optionals. I
believe he will be the one to beat in the Pacific-8 championships."
