Francisco City Golf
Championships after the
completion of two more rounds
of medal play at Harding Park last

Saturday as the Stanford
freshman fashioned a par on the
20th hole to move into the
quarter-finals.

Fresno State star Johnson two
and one by shooting even par for
18 holes. This marks the second

Palacio who consistently plays
well in the City Championship
and was California's amateur

on the 20th hole. Baskins was
eliminated from the tournament
yesterday, however, by Mark
Lyle, a San Jose State redshirt
from Napa who shot a brilliant
two under par to win his match
on Saturday. Lye produced
another unbeatable two under par
round to beat the steady Baskins
