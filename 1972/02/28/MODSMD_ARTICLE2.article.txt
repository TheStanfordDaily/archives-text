# Jury Selection Set
## Davis Trial To Begin 
### BOB BACON 
SAN JOSE —Trial begins here this
morning in the case of the people of
the State of California vs. Angela
Davis.
The state, once her employer,
charges the revolutionary with murder,
kidnapping, and conspiracy. The
charges arise out of a gun battle which
took place more than a year and a half
ago.
Jury selection is expected to begin
today, but additional defense motions
may postpone the much-delayed case
still further. The first 150 prospective
jurors will assemble at the heavily
guarded Santa Clara County
Criminal-Legal Building in the Civic
Center this morning in anticipation of
the beginning of the selection process.
The amount of pre-trial publicity
indicates that jury selection itself will
be a lengthy process. In pretrial
hearings, Davis' lawyers asserted that
an impartial jury could not be chosen
in Santa Clara County.
Estimates of the trial's length run
from four to nine months.
If convicted, the former UCLA
philosophy instructor could be
sentenced to life in prison. She faced
the death penalty until a February 18
California Supreme Court decision
abolished it.
Gun Battle
The state alleges that Davis, 28,
supplied the guns used by three
prisoners in an abortive escape attempt
and kidnapping in a Marin County
courtroom on August 7, 1970. Four
persons — a judge, two of the convicts,
and an accomplice — died in the
resulting gun battle.
According to the prosecution, the
shootout was an attempt to kidnap the
judge, Harold Haley, an attorney, and
three jurors, and to hold them hostage
for the release of the three Soledad
Brothers, accused of killing a guard at
Soledad Prison in January 1970.
On August 7, Jonathan Jackson,
17, brother of George Jackson one of

the "Soledad Brothers," allegedly
brought four guns into the San Rafael
courtroom where the three prisoners —
James McClain, William Christmas, and
Ruchell Magee — were appearing
before Haley.
Haley, an attorney, and three jurors
were allegedly taken at gunpoint by
Jackson and the three into a truck in
the courthouse parking lot. Gunfire
broke out between the kidnappers and
police, resulting in four deaths —
Haley, McClain, Christmas, and the
younger Jackson. A juror, the
attorney, and Magee were wounded.
Davis is not charged with being
present at the shootout. She was first
linked to the case by the registrations
of the four guns involved, which
indicated that she had purchased them
in Los Angeles — two of them shortly
before the crime.

Her attorneys claim that she is
being prosecuted in the Haley killings
because she is an outspoken black
Communist. They assert she is
innocent and the charges are
"trumped-up" and part of a "political
frameup" masterminded by Governor
Ronald Reagan.

guarded Santa Clara County
Criminal-Legal Building in the Civic
Center this morning in anticipation of
the beginning of the selection process.
The amount of pre-trial publicity
indicates that jury selection itself will
be a lengthy process. In pretrial
hearings, Davis' lawyers asserted that
an impartial jury could not be chosen
in Santa Clara County.
Estimates of the trial's length run
from four to nine months.
If convicted, the former UCLA
philosophy instructor could be
sentenced to life in prison. She faced
the death penalty until a February 18
California Supreme Court decision
abolished it.
Gun Battle
The state alleges that Davis, 28,
supplied the guns used by three
prisoners in an abortive escape attempt
and kidnapping in a Marin County
courtroom on August 7, 1970. Four
persons — a judge, two of the convicts,
and an accomplice — died in the
resulting gun battle.
According to the prosecution, the
shootout was an attempt to kidnap the
judge, Harold Haley, an attorney, and
three jurors, and to hold them hostage
for the release of the three Soledad
Brothers, accused of killing a guard at
Soledad Prison in January 1970.
On August 7, Jonathan Jackson,
17, brother of George Jackson one of

the "Soledad Brothers," allegedly
brought four guns into the San Rafael
courtroom where the three prisoners —
James McClain, William Christmas, and
Ruchell Magee — were appearing
before Haley.
Haley, an attorney, and three jurors
were allegedly taken at gunpoint by
Jackson and the three into a truck in
the courthouse parking lot. Gunfire
broke out between the kidnappers and
police, resulting in four deaths —
Haley, McClain, Christmas, and the
younger Jackson. A juror, the
attorney, and Magee were wounded.
Davis is not charged with being
present at the shootout. She was first
linked to the case by the registrations
of the four guns involved, which
indicated that she had purchased them
in Los Angeles — two of them shortly
before the crime.

Her attorneys claim that she is
being prosecuted in the Haley killings
because she is an outspoken black
Communist. They assert she is
innocent and the charges are
"trumped-up" and part of a "political
frameup" masterminded by Governor
Ronald Reagan.

ANGELA—The jury selection process in ihe inurder-kidnap-conspiracy trial of
Angela Davis begins today in the Santa Clara County Criminal Legal Building in
San Jose. Davis was released last week on $102,500 bail after the California
Supreme Court ruled the death penalty unconstitutional in a case argued by
Stanford law professor Anthony Amsterdam.
SAN JOSE —Trial begins here this
morning in the case of the people of
the State of California vs. Angela
Davis.
The state, once her employer,
charges the revolutionary with murder,
kidnapping, and conspiracy. The
charges arise out of a gun battle which
took place more than a year and a half
ago.
Jury selection is expected to begin
today, but additional defense motions
may postpone the much-delayed case
still further. The first 150 prospective
jurors will assemble at the heavily
guarded Santa Clara County
Criminal-Legal Building in the Civic
Center this morning in anticipation of
the beginning of the selection process.
