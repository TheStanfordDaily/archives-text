# Card Basketball Team Falls To Washington
## 
### 
The Card basketball team's
attempt to move past Washington
into fourth place in the Pac-8
failed Saturday night when the
Huskies rolled to a 90-78 win over
the Indians in Seattle.
Washington's 6'10" center
Steve Hawes kept his team in the
game during the first half when

the Huskies committed 16
turnovers. Hawes scored 17 points
and pulled down an equal number
of rebounds in the first half on his
way to a game high total of 32
points.
Charles Dudley also hit for 27
points to help submerge the
hustling Indians.

The Huskies led by 10 points
at halftime and could not pull
away from Howie Dallmar's cagers
for the rest of the game. Mike
Mann and Claude Terry kept the
Cards in the contest as they
recorded point totals of 26 and 24
points, respectively.
Bob Buell was the only other
Stanford player able to reach
double figures as he netted 11.
With the win, the Huskies
avenged an overtime loss to the
Cards earlier this season at Maples
Pavilion, 85-80. The loss gives the
Indians a 5-6 conference record
that they will take into tonight's
contest with Washington State at
Pullman. Stanford easily defeated

the Cougars 76-54 this year at
Maples and hopes to even its Pac-8
record with another win over
WSU.
The Stanford freshmen edged
the University of Pacific freshmen
71-68 at Stockton Saturday night.
The frosh were down 36-26 at
half and shot only 28 percent
from the floor for the entire
game.
Twin 19 point outputs by Rich
Kelley and Mike Simons helped
pull the game out. Kelley also
snared 21 rebounds. Scott Trobbe
hit for 11 points and 12 rebounds
and Mel Arterberry scored 10.
The loss put the UOP froshs'
record at 18-4 for the season.

TOO LATE—A Cal defender gets to Kip Oxman (46) too late to
prevent the Indian rugby standout from kicking the ball out of
bounds to keep a Stanford drive going. Cal downed the Indians 22-9
in the first game of the battle for the Scrum Axe. The Stanford 2nds,
however, crushed the Bear 2nds 35-9. The Card 3rds lost to Santa
Rosa, 10-0.
