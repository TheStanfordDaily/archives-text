Nixon On Way Home
SHANGHAI — His visit to China over, President Nixon
flew homeward today with the vision of a new era in
relations for the billion humans who populate China and
the United States.
The President spoke of his eight days on Chinese soil as
"the week that changed the world."
Before embarking on his BV2 hour flight to Anchorage,
Alaska, the President said goodbye to Premier Chou
En-lai. The two leaders joined in a 1,750-word
communique high-lighting their countries' differences but
agreeing on an overall pledge to work toward peace and to
foreswear any attempted domination of Asia by either
Washington or Peking.
Both sides affirmed there can be only one China, and
Nixon promised that the United States will move toward
withdrawing all its forces from Taiwan.
There was no agreement on Indochina, but the
President foresaw the withdrawal of all American forces
"in the absence of a negotiated settlement."
The communique, more detailed than many people had
expected, had in effect three sections. Part of it told of
the things both sides could agree upon, such as more
cultural exchanges and trade. Separately, the United
States gave its stand on some issues, and China gave its
viewpoint.
Heavy Toll In Flooding
MAN, W.Va. — Flash flooding in southern West Virginia
killed at least 57 persons and left an estimated 4,000
persons homeless, Gov. Arch A. Moore, Jr., said yesterday
after touring the region.

Moore said 80 percent of the homes in a dozen coal
mining communities along Buffalo Creek in Logan County
were destroyed when a rupture in an earthen dam sent a
wall of water cascading through the narrow valley
Saturday morning.
Moore said he would ask the West Virginia Legislature
for $1 million today "to start relief work" for flood
victims.
The flash flooding, according to local officials, came
only about 90 minutes after authorities had been assured
that "everything's okay" at the dam.
State police said the list of persons whose whereabouts
were unknown had grown to more than 400, but
authorities could not tell how many of these were persons
who had survived the flood but had become separated
from their families.

HARRISBURG, Pa. — The government's chief witness at
the Harrisburg 7 conspiracy trial comes out of hiding this
week to testify how he kept the FBI informed about an
alleged antiwar plot to kidnap presidential adviser Henry
Kissinger.
Boyd Douglas, Jr. disappeared 13'/2 months ago,
immediately after he was paroled from prison, and went
secretly before a federal grand jury that later indicted the
Rev. Philip Berrigan and his six codefendants on
conspiracy charges centered around their opposition to
the Vietnam war.
Government lawyers said of Douglas: "He's the key, no
question about that. He knows what happened and how."

authorities could not tell how many of these were persons
who had survived the flood but had become separated
from their families.
Informer To Testify
HARRISBURG, Pa. — The government's chief witness at
the Harrisburg 7 conspiracy trial comes out of hiding this
week to testify how he kept the FBI informed about an
alleged antiwar plot to kidnap presidential adviser Henry
Kissinger.
Boyd Douglas, Jr. disappeared 13'/2 months ago,
immediately after he was paroled from prison, and went
secretly before a federal grand jury that later indicted the
Rev. Philip Berrigan and his six codefendants on
conspiracy charges centered around their opposition to
the Vietnam war.
Government lawyers said of Douglas: "He's the key, no
question about that. He knows what happened and how."
Nixon On Way Home
SHANGHAI — His visit to China over, President Nixon
flew homeward today with the vision of a new era in
relations for the billion humans who populate China and
the United States.
The President spoke of his eight days on Chinese soil as
"the week that changed the world."
Before embarking on his BV2 hour flight to Anchorage,
Alaska, the President said goodbye to Premier Chou
En-lai. The two leaders joined in a 1,750-word
communique high-lighting their countries' differences but
agreeing on an overall pledge to work toward peace and to
foreswear any attempted domination of Asia by either
Washington or Peking.
Both sides affirmed there can be only one China, and
Nixon promised that the United States will move toward
withdrawing all its forces from Taiwan.
There was no agreement on Indochina, but the
President foresaw the withdrawal of all American forces
"in the absence of a negotiated settlement."
The communique, more detailed than many people had
expected, had in effect three sections. Part of it told of
the things both sides could agree upon, such as more
cultural exchanges and trade. Separately, the United
States gave its stand on some issues, and China gave its
viewpoint.
Heavy Toll In Flooding
MAN, W.Va. — Flash flooding in southern West Virginia
killed at least 57 persons and left an estimated 4,000
persons homeless, Gov. Arch A. Moore, Jr., said yesterday
after touring the region.

Moore said 80 percent of the homes in a dozen coal
mining communities along Buffalo Creek in Logan County
were destroyed when a rupture in an earthen dam sent a
wall of water cascading through the narrow valley
Saturday morning.
Moore said he would ask the West Virginia Legislature
for $1 million today "to start relief work" for flood
victims.
The flash flooding, according to local officials, came
only about 90 minutes after authorities had been assured
that "everything's okay" at the dam.
State police said the list of persons whose whereabouts
were unknown had grown to more than 400, but
authorities could not tell how many of these were persons
who had survived the flood but had become separated
from their families.
