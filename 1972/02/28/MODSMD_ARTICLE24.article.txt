# Witnesses Identify Disrupters

### KEVIN SMITH 
Prosecution witnesses testified
Saturday that demonstrators who
entered Eleetrical Engineering
Professor William Shockley's quantum
mechanics class confronted him with a
demand to debate his controversial
genetic theories. However, none of the
witnesses was able to identify Gerry

Foote, one of the defendants, as
having been inside the classroom.
Don Lee, Kwonping Ho, and Alice
Furumoto, who were placed in the
classroom by witnesses are charged
along with Foote for taking part in the
January 18 disruption of that class.
Students in Shockley's class said a
group of about 15 people entered and

went quietly to the back of the
classroom while a black man read a
statement condemning Shockley's
racism and demanding he debate with
black psychology professor Cedric
Clark.
In related prosecution testimony,
class members were not sure whether
Shockley ever asked the demonstrators
to leave the class. Michael Mruzik of
engineering said he did not recall
Shockley asking the visitors to leave,
but said he did object to the presence
of people who were not in the class.
An auditor of the class, Applied
Physics student Joe McMenamin, also
did not recall Shockley telling the
demonstrators to leave, but two other
students, James. A. davis and T.J.
Rodgers, testified that Shockley asked
all people not there attending his class
to leave.
Rodgers identified Ho and
Furumoto as among the
demonstrators. Lee and Foote were
not in the hearing room at that time.
Rodgers asserted that Furumoto was
"somewhat more vocal than other
people," but said she was not heckling.
McMenamin identified Ho, but
stated he didn't notice Ho until after
the struggle with Barbee over the
pictures. Davis identified Furumoto,
but could not positively identify Ho.
Stanford Police photographer Nick
Bruno, who arrived as the
demonstration was dispersing, testified
he saw Foote and Ho outside the
classroom. Bruno added he saw Lee
come out of the classroom, but said he
did not see Lee or anyone else
disrupting anything when he arrived.
Following Bruno's testimony, the
defense made a motion to strike his
identifications because they were not
informed that Bruno would identify
Ho and Lee. The defense and the
prosecution have an agreement that
the prosecution tells the defense what
its witnesses will say so that the
defense can be better prepared.
In denying the motion, hearing
officer Henry Ramsey said the defense
would be able to recall Bruno later if
they felt hindered by the lack of
information.
The defense also objected to Davis'
testimony on the same grounds, to
which Ramsey replied "The discovery
procedure that exists at Stanford is the
most liberal discovery procedure in the
world." He again said he would let
them recall the witness, if necessary.
