# Woman Law Professor Chosen
## 
### 
Barbara A. Bowman, director of the
Public Defender Service for the
District of Columbia, has been
appointed an associate professor of
law at Stanford effective July 1, 1972.
She will be the first full-time
woman member of the Stanford Law
School faculty.
According to Marc Franklin, head
of the Law School Selections
Committee, "Other schools were also
interested in her. They have women
professors already. Columbia, Yale,
and Penn all have good women
already."
"We weren't especially looking for
a woman, though," he stated. "I
wasn't aware of any pressure because
of the HEW investigation or the
Affirmative Action program."
"We just look for the best people

we can get," he added. "Obviously it
doesn't hurt if she's a woman."
Professor Bowman received a B.A.
from the University of Pennsylvania
where she was Phi Beta Kappa,
valedictorian of the College for
Women, president of the Debate
Council and a Woodrow Wilson
Scholar.
While at Yale Law School (LLB
1963) she was on the Yale Law
Journal, a member of Order of the
Coif and won the Harlan Fiske Stone
Prize.
After serving as law clerk to Hon.
Henry W. Edgerton of the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the District of
Columbia, she spent two years in
litigation practice with Edward
Bennett Williams in Washington, D.C.
She then worked for two years as a
staff attorney with the Legal Aid
Agency for the District, the
predecessor to the Public Defender
Service.
In addition to trying cases, she
directed the Service's staff of 44
attorneys and a supporting staff of 16
social workers and 14 investigators, as
well as conducting the staff training
program.
She has also been an adjunct
professor and visiting lecturer at
Georgetown University Law Center
and Yale Law School, and is currently
preparing a book for a course
concerning women and the law.
Bowman serves on the Criminal
Justice Coordinating Board for the
District of Columbia, on the Executive
Board of the National Legal Aid and
Defender Association, and the Judicial
Council Committee on the Operation
of the Bail Reform Act of the District
of Columbia.
She is the coauthor of "Defense of
a Homicide Case" in Criminal Defense
Techniques, 1969, and prepared Legal
Representation during the Mayday
Disorders: A Special Report of the
Public Defender Service for the
District of Columbia, 1971.
