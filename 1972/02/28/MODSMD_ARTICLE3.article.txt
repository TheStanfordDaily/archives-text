# War Recruitment Ban Request Explained In COSS Findings
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
The Committee on Student Services
(COSS), in an 18-page report released
yesterday, explained its
recommendation that President
Richard Lyman ban the Armed Forces
from recruiting at Stanford's "formal
placement facilities."
The Committee has also suggested
that placement facilities give further
information to students "through the
maintenance of an open file on each
recruiting company."
COSS also recommended that "all
companies recruiting ... be required
to fill out a questionnaire which asks
questions relating to student concerns
about company practices."
COSS also proposes that "no policy
review and recommending body in
addition to (COSS) be established for
the Career Planning and Placement

Center."
The fifth recommendation of COSS
is that "a referendum of the student
body establish the policy of whether
military recruiters and recruiters from
companies falling within specific
legislative guidelines relating to their
production of weapons of war should
be barred" from recruiting.
Student Ballot
Further, the Committee suggests
"some method by which all registered
students receive a ballot, as well as a
summary of all the arguments which
this Committee found most important
on both sides of the issue."
COSS defeated a proposal "that, on
principle, some companies producing
weapons of war should be barred from
using the formal placement facilities of
Stanford" by a 5-4 vote.
Voting with the majority in
defeating the proposal were: senior
Tim Clark, the chairman; senior Chris
Winkle; Assistant Psychiatry and
Pediatrics Professor Stanley Fischman;
Assistant Art Professor Suzanne Lewis;
and Assistant Dean for the Graduate
Division Thomas Rhue.
The minority consisted of
sophomore Neil Bernstein; sophomore
Fernando Sanchez; sophomore Spike
Van Petten; and Associate English
Professor Ronald Rebholz.
Student Referendum
Clark added his vote to the
immediately preceding four in calling
for the student referendum on
recruitment by a 5-4 vote. Fischman
was the only Committee member who

dissented with the majority which
recommended banning military
recruiters from the campus. The other
recommendations were approved
unanimously.
The Committee issued majority and
minority reports on each of the three
proposals which were not unanimously
decided upon.
The majority report in favor of
banning military recruiting stated that
"a student's access to military
positions or training programs in the
armed forces would in no way be
curtailed by a policy banning military
recruiters from using the formal
placement facilities because the
military services maintain recruitment
facilities in close proximity to the
campus."
No Proper Place
The majority continued that "the
military has no proper place within the
fabric of the University as an
independent private and domestic
institution.
"The degree of coercive
involvement with the DoD
(Department of Defense) insofar as
military recruiting is concerned may
be observed in the fact that military
recruiting on campus is demanded by
the DoD as a condition for the
awarding of its research contracts to
the University."
The majority was referring to the
NASA Authorization Act of 1971 and
the Armed Forces Appropriation
Authorization Act of 1971.
Last fiscal year, Stanford received

$15,852,351 in "research contracts
and grants" from DoD and NASA.
Fischman's minority report on
military recruitment stated that "the
very act of judging, especially on a
moral basis, who may not have access
to the University and its facilities is
potentially a very dangerous act which
seems antithetical to the very nature
of a University."
In justifying its recommendation to
hold a student referendum on
recruiting, the majority report said
that "the Career Planning and
Placement Center exists because it
provides a service which benefits
students.
"Other persons or groups benefit as
well, but these benefits are secondary
and do not in themselves justify the
existence of a Placement Center.
Students should set policy for a
student service."
Less Informed
The minority report on the
referendum states that "generally, the
public is less well informed on an issue
than its representatives. In this case we
could not expect the student body to
review the issues as completely as
COSS has and could not, therefore,
make as well educated a judgment."
The minority report in favor of the
recruitment ban said that "aiding a
process that culminates in the illegal
and immoral killing of people is itself
immoral." The report described the
recruitment ban as "a gesture that may
be imitated bv other universities."
