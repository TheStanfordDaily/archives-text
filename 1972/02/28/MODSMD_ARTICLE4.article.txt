# Study Of Imperialism Legitimized

### BOB LITTERMAN News Analysis 
Stanford's Symposium on
Imperialism, the first such gathering of
scholars on this subject in recent years,
may indicate that the study of
imperialism is finally come ir.t.o its
own.

The Symposium lasted four days,
included eleven sessions, drew 31
distinguished scholars, and was
attended by over 3000 people.
There were many criticisms (see the
statement by Judy Strasser on page
two of today's Daily), but most
impressions were favorable.
Three graduate students organized
the event, formally sponsored by the
SWOPSI department, and had worked
on it since last May. Money came from
a variety of sources.
The purpose of the symposium was
to "try to explain imperialism to
people who are concerned about
Vietnam and priorities at home; and
who have heard about imperialism, but
didn't know what it meant," said Bill
Behn, one of the organizers. "We
wanted to present imperialism as a
serious option. Tapes are available for
those who missed any of the sessions."
Perhaps the most important result
of the conference was to legitimize the
study of imperialism. For many years
discussion of this topic at Stanford has
centered in White Plaza rallies and
been closely identified with radical,
often less reputable, segments of the
anti-war movement.
As another of the organizers, a
Greek student who wished to remain
anonymous, says, "When people see
known radicals from their own
university they tend not to listen to
what's being said. When we bring in
radicals from outside it tends to

legitimize their criticisms â€” even when
they say the same things."
The study of imperialism really
isn't anything new, according to
Economics professor John Gurley.
Forty years ago imperialism was
studied in many American universities,
he says. The difference then was that
it was the imperialism of European
powers that was being studied.
Since the U.S. became the major
imperialist power however, according
to Gurley, its study in American
universities has been very limited.
The subject matter of imperialism is
generally subsumed in the economics
department under what is termed
economic development. "The
economic development view says the
rich are helping the poor," Gurley
says, "while the imperialist view says
the rich are helping themselves, and in
the process the poor may be helped, or
they may not be. The first view almost
entirely sees capitalism as a national
system, while imperialism sees
capitalism as an international system."
One of the problems Behn sees with
the study of imperialism at Stanford
today is an unwillingness on the part
of the economics department to
seriously confront the issues it raises.
"I was very disappointed with the
response the symposium got from the
economics department," says Behn.
"Of the scholars who came to
Stanford ten to twelve were
economists. but officially the

department showed no interest. In no
way did the department make it easier
for economics students to attend the
afternoon sessions of the program."
Gurley feels that the economics
department has confronted the issues
to some extent, but he would like to
have another radical economist around
who shares some of his views. He has
tried to get a radical black economist
from Wisconsin hired by the
department, but feels the appointment
is doubtful at this point.
"Probably several members in the
department would not like to have
another radical or marxist on the
faculty. Several others probably
would, but the fact that you are split
means that the answer comes out to be
no."
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Clibbs feels that "obviously
there are many students who want to
see imperialism studied from a radical
point of view. Anyone who said
imperialism didn't exist would be
unrealistic," he said, but "it must be
studied from an intellectual point of
view."
He says imperialism is being studied
here in several departments already,
especially in SWOPSI courses and
undergraduate specials. Increasing
stress in such areas as women,
Chicanos, Asian Americans, Native
Americans, and urban studies would
be more important than imperialism,
he savs.
