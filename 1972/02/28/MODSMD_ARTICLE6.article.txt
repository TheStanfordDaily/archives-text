Student Control
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the continuing discussion of
the Stanford placement center
one seemingly obvious analysis
has been overlooked. The center is
often cited as a service to students
a convenience to facilitate
students learning of job
opportunities from various
prospective employers.
If this is so, presumably
students should decide in what
way and to what extent this
service should exist. If students
themselves by some reasonable
mechanism (a referendum, a
committee?) decide to limit who
they want to be recruited by, the
community may deplore their
lack of tolerance, but certainly no
one can question their right to
control a self-serving organization.
If the placement center appears
not merely a student service, but
also a service to employers in
recruiting needed talent, then
something is wrong. GM, IBM,
and other large companies
maintain their own schools to
train people in the specific skills
they require. We need not invoke
all the pious mouthings of pursuit
of knowledge and truth at the
university to see that Stanford
should not insist on providing an
employment service for industry
at the expense of expelling its
students.
Finally if the placement center
provides a service to faculty,
administration, or staff, it can not
be the overt one of providing job
opportunities. These people

already have jobs. President
Lyman has suggested that banning
military recruiters would lose
millions of dollars (and jobs) for
the university. Perhaps
maintaining the good will of
industry by welcoming their
recruiters is also considered an
important means of support for
the university.
Let us rethink what vital
service to the university the
placement center provides that
might justify disciplinary action
against those who interfere with
its normal functioning. If the
center is strictly a service to
students, then students should
control it. If the center is a vital
element of the university's fund
raising and government/industry
relations effort, then let's drop the
rhetoric of academic freedom,
protection of minority rights, and
student services, and confront the
real issues.

(The following is a letter to
Professor David M. Mason,
President of the Stanford Faculty
Club)
Dear Professor Mason,
We consider that the Stanford
Faculty Club owes a formal and
public apology to Mr. Roy Boggs,
a Black member of the Harvard
Club and a Stanford employee,
who, in his opinion and that of a
number of witnesses, was treated
offensively by the Club's head

chef, Mr. Arturo Lionetti, on the
occasion of the Harvard Club
dinner Wednesday evening,
February 9, 1972.
On that evening a number of
Harvard Club members and their
guests had not put on name tag,
but Mr. Lionetti (who apparently
does not confine his attentions to
the kitchen, but also seems to
deem it his duty to serve as a
"bouncer") approached only Mr.
Boggs, the only Black in the
room, to ask him if he had any
business there. Two of Mr. Bogg's
guests subsequently asked the
Harvard Club President to
apologize for the incident, first
making the request privately and
later in public, but no apology
was offered. In addition, when
Mr. Boggs later attempted to ask a
question after one of the
scheduled after-dinner speeches,
he was booed and shouted at in an
ugly and boorish manner. We
think that apologies from both
the Harvard Club and the
Stanford Faculty Club represent a
minimum exercise of politeness
following this shameful incident.
Apology is not enough,
however. We demand that the
Faculty Club initiate without
delay a thorough investigation of
this and other incidents in which
Mr. Lionetti has allegedly used
language that seems offensive to
members of minority groups and
nationals of Third World
countries. The Faculty Political
Action Group is prepared to offer
its good offices to assist in the
conduct of the investigation.

Action groupsâ€”Raymond Giraud
