## Shockley's Confidence Ill-Founded 
### 
Emerson brown

Professor Shockley finds
himself at the center of several
different controversies at the
present time, all of which are very
much in need of calm analysis. I
should like to restrict my
attention, however, to his recent
paid advertisement in the Daily,
sponsored by a group called
"FREED."
As a footnote to Professor
Ehrlich's thorough refutation of
the "fundamental flaw" in
Professor Shockley's scientific
position on genetics and race, I
would like to point out one of the
flaws in his position concerning
the potential destructive power of
his ideas. Readers of the FREED
advertisement will recall that
Professor Shockley is confident
that his theories about the
intellectual inferiority of blacks

will not lead to any genocidal
horrors. His confidence is based
on the First Amendment to the
United States Constitution. Lest I
be accused of making all this up, I
shall quote Professor Shockley at
some length:
"The real lesson of Nazi
history was anticipated 140 years
before Hitler when the Bill of
Rights incorporated into our
Constitution the First
Amendment guaranteeing
freedom of speech and of the
press. Only the most
anti-Teutonic racist can believe
the German people to be such an
evil breed that they would have
tolerated the concentration camps
and gas chambers if a working
First Amendment had permitted
exposure and discussion of
Hitler's final solution — the
extermination of the Jews.
. . . The First Amendment makes
it safe for us in the U.S. to try to
find humane eugenic measures."
Clinches
Leaving aside any possible
quibbling about whether the
United States does, in fact, have a
free press, I will accept for the
sake of argument — especially
since it clinches mine — Professor
Shockley's belief that the U.S. has
been blessed with a free press and
with free speech since, apparently,
the moment the Bill of Rights was
ratified. Professor Shockley's
confidence that our free press will
protect blacks in the future seems
curious in light of the obvious fact
that it has been far from totally
successful in protecting blacks —
and others — in the past.
Surely even Professor Shockley
would admit that a few rather
unpleasant acts of racism have
occurred in this country since the
ratification of the First

Amendment. Such things come to
mind as the forced detention of
the Japanese Americans in World
War II (those concentration camps
that the Germans would not have
tolerated had a free press
disclosed their existence), the
lynching of countless blacks over
the years in the South, and,
indeed, the whole institution of
slavery. Slavery existed, one might
even say thrived, for nearly a
hundred years after the
ratification of the First
Amendment.
Now I don't see how Professor
Shockley can have it both ways.
Either these manifestations of
racism are not serious enough to
worry about or the press in the
United States is not a guarantee
against the dreadful results of
racial prejudice. Or does Professor
Shockley consider slavery, forced
detention, and lynching to be
insignificant? One almost suspects
that he does, that, indeed, the
only damage he is capable of
concerning himself with is some
horror of the magnitude of
Hitler's "final solution."
Mask
Professor Shockley's
confidence in the power of the
First Amendment to prevent
racial atrocities seems to me to be
an effort to mask an incredible
insensitivity to other — more
subtle — kinds of damage that the
circulation of impressive sounding
charges of racial inferiority can
inflict. This damage is of at least
two kinds — both difficult to
measure, yet both impossible to
ignore.
There are in this country a
great many people who
consciously or unconsciously
believe — with Professor Shockley
— that blacks are inferior. For

such people, reading the racist
notions of a Nobel laureate or
seeing him on television armed
with impressive looking charts and
tables and quietly and
dispassionately "proving" the
genetic inferiority of blacks can
scarcely fail to subtly reinforce
and strengthen existing prejudices.
Who can calculate the increase
in prejudice, discrimination, and
violence that can result?
An even more subtle kind of
damage can result within blacks
themselves. Anyone who has
taught people who live in an
environment that encourages
them to think of themselves as
inferior knows how terribly
damaging feelings of weakness and
inadequacy can be, even in
students of exceptional ability.
There is a great surge of black
pride these days, and I don't see
how any decent person of any
race can fail to welcome it. But
when a student is alone in his
room, late at night, trying
desperately to work out a difficult
math problem or analyze a
complex and demanding work of
literature, then those dreadful,
debilitating, destructive thoughts
that "maybe Shockley is right"
can surge up and block that added
push of effort that could see the
student through. Even the most
academically successful among us
realizes the insidious, corrupting
power of self-doubt. Think what
it must be to have your whole
society conspiring to reinforce
such doubts. Think what
Professor Shockley is doing to
contribute to that conspiracy.
Press Agent
The free press, far from
preventing this kind of damage,
can actually be the agent of its
perpetration. It is the free press,

after all, that aided Professor
Shockley by printing his
advertisement.
1 am anxious not to be
misunderstood here. I am not
claiming that Professor Shockley
should be prevented from
publishing his theories. I am
certainly not claiming that he
should be prevented from
teaching engineering. 1 am
attempting only to discredit him
as a thinker worth listening to by
showing just one of the
weaknesses in his argument.
Perhaps Professor Shockley
will take the time to respond to
this refutation of his claim that
"The First Amendment makes it
safe for us in the U.S. to try to
find humane eugenic measures."
Will he argue that our free press
has, in spite of what 1 say, been
successful in preventing racial
atrocities in the United States?
Will he claim that nothing much
worth worrying about has
occurred in the U.S. and that the
only crime he is concerned with is
genocide of the scope carried out
by the Nazis? Or will he, on this
point at least, admit that he is
wrong?
I very much hope so. For even
if he is emotionally or
intellectually incapable of
straightening out the flaw in his
scientific thinking that Professor
Ehrlich has so patiently and
carefully described, he may at
least be responsible enough to
face the fact that apreading
notions of racial inferiority could
once again — as it has so often in
the past — lead to prejudice,
discrimination, and yes, even
genocide.
