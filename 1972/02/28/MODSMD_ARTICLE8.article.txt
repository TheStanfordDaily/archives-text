## Chauvinism A Result Of Imperialism 
### 
women 9 8 center

(Editor's Note: This is the text of
a statement read at the final
session of the Symposium on
Imperialism Friday night.)
We are here tonight because
the organizers of this conference
did not invite a token woman to
discuss the consequences of U.S.
imperialism. Yet we know that
we, as women, are oppressed by
American imperialism.
Many criticisms have been
levelled against the organizers of
this symposium. We, ourselves,
have complained of male
chauvinism. As Judy Carnoy said
yesterday, she was one of only
three women speakers. There have
been no women moderators. Few
women have even asked questions
during the sessions.
This sym p osium has

emphasized expertise. Many of us
in the audience — not just women
— are intimidated by the
mystification of knowledge. We
feel we cannot ask questions
unless we've studied at least two
years of economics. We are not
trained to speak the jargon; we
can't understand simple concepts
when they masquerade behind
economic terms.
Oppressed
Women, who are traditionally
excluded from intellectual
pursuits, feel particularly
oppressed by discussions which
value theoretical discourse over
practical experience in the
struggle against imperialism.
But we do not direct this
criticism at the symposium's
organizers. We know that the
elitism and chauvinism of the
American left — of our brothers —
is a result of American
imperialism. It is caused by a
political and economic system
which requires that the
educational institutions train
students in Imperial theory and
practice.
What does this mean? It means
that universities like Stanford can
barely suffer the presence of
academic Marxists on the faculty.
It means that Marxists who
attempt to put their theories into
practice are persecuted, killed,
drummed out of the university.
Radical intellectuals who want

to keep their university jobs are
forced into dog-eat-dog
competition and intellectual
elitism. Of necessity, they
communicate better with other
radical intellectuals than with
activists or simply discontented
students.
Imperial demands on the
educational system further require
that anti-imperialism be neither
taught nor practiced on campus.
The people who organized this
symposium understand this very
well. They worked hard for a
symposium on imperialism, and
they were allowed to organize a
symposium — with these strings:
—that it be only four days long
—that no student get credit for
attending
—that the imperialist point of
view be represented
Despite these strings, the
symposium has generated
enormous interest and has, we
think, been successful.
Inadequate
But because of these strings,
because of the nature of the
imperialist university, the
symposium has also been
hopelessly, helplessly inadequate.
It has tried to do too much, and
done too little.
It has brought together Marxist
theorists — forced to spend most
of their time in intellectual
isolation — so that they could
discuss and criticize each other's

work and extend Marxist theory.
The symposium has also tried
to answer the elementary
questions of those of us who
think we are anti-imperialist, and
try to act against imperialism, but
aren't sure what the monster
really is.
The symposium has not yet
dealt with the needs of women
and people of color in this
country who bear the scars of
oppression, but cannot yet
identify the oppressor.
And — perhaps the most
serious of all the failings — the
symposium has not even asked
how imperialism oppresses white
American men.
We know that our liberation
depends on our understanding the
source of our oppression — and
we want even you white male
academic Marxists to know that
the same thing applies to you.
You will not be liberated until
you understand your oppression,
and act on it.
Need More
But as we said, we know that
this symposium could not more
than begin to raise a few
important questions. We need
more than a four day symposium
on imperialism. We need — and we
demand — an Anti-Imperialist
University. A People's University,
which will support Marxist
theorists and Marxist activists.
The organizers of this
symposium have taken a small
step. But the time has come — as
Nixon now likes to put it — for a
long march. For the next step, we
propose the creation of an
interdisciplinary Marxist Study
Center — a center funded by
Stanford University, giving
courses for credit, with radical
faculty, and open to everyone.

session of the Symposium on
Imperialism Friday night.)
We are here tonight because
the organizers of this conference
did not invite a token woman to
discuss the consequences of U.S.
imperialism. Yet we know that
we, as women, are oppressed by
American imperialism.
Many criticisms have been
levelled against the organizers of
this symposium. We, ourselves,
have complained of male
chauvinism. As Judy Carnoy said
yesterday, she was one of only
three women speakers. There have
been no women moderators. Few
women have even asked questions
during the sessions.
This sym p osium has

emphasized expertise. Many of us
in the audience — not just women
— are intimidated by the
mystification of knowledge. We
feel we cannot ask questions
unless we've studied at least two
years of economics. We are not
trained to speak the jargon; we
can't understand simple concepts
when they masquerade behind
economic terms.
Oppressed
Women, who are traditionally
excluded from intellectual
pursuits, feel particularly
oppressed by discussions which
value theoretical discourse over
practical experience in the
struggle against imperialism.
But we do not direct this
criticism at the symposium's
organizers. We know that the
elitism and chauvinism of the
American left — of our brothers —
is a result of American
imperialism. It is caused by a
political and economic system
which requires that the
educational institutions train
students in Imperial theory and
practice.
What does this mean? It means
that universities like Stanford can
barely suffer the presence of
academic Marxists on the faculty.
It means that Marxists who
attempt to put their theories into
practice are persecuted, killed,
drummed out of the university.
Radical intellectuals who want

to keep their university jobs are
forced into dog-eat-dog
competition and intellectual
elitism. Of necessity, they
communicate better with other
radical intellectuals than with
activists or simply discontented
students.
Imperial demands on the
educational system further require
that anti-imperialism be neither
taught nor practiced on campus.
The people who organized this
symposium understand this very
well. They worked hard for a
symposium on imperialism, and
they were allowed to organize a
symposium — with these strings:
—that it be only four days long
—that no student get credit for
attending
—that the imperialist point of
view be represented
Despite these strings, the
symposium has generated
enormous interest and has, we
think, been successful.
Inadequate
But because of these strings,
because of the nature of the
imperialist university, the
symposium has also been
hopelessly, helplessly inadequate.
It has tried to do too much, and
done too little.
It has brought together Marxist
theorists — forced to spend most
of their time in intellectual
isolation — so that they could
discuss and criticize each other's

work and extend Marxist theory.
The symposium has also tried
to answer the elementary
questions of those of us who
think we are anti-imperialist, and
try to act against imperialism, but
aren't sure what the monster
really is.
The symposium has not yet
dealt with the needs of women
and people of color in this
country who bear the scars of
oppression, but cannot yet
identify the oppressor.
And — perhaps the most
serious of all the failings — the
symposium has not even asked
how imperialism oppresses white
American men.
We know that our liberation
depends on our understanding the
source of our oppression — and
we want even you white male
academic Marxists to know that
the same thing applies to you.
You will not be liberated until
you understand your oppression,
and act on it.
Need More
But as we said, we know that
this symposium could not more
than begin to raise a few
important questions. We need
more than a four day symposium
on imperialism. We need — and we
demand — an Anti-Imperialist
University. A People's University,
which will support Marxist
theorists and Marxist activists.
The organizers of this
symposium have taken a small
step. But the time has come — as
Nixon now likes to put it — for a
long march. For the next step, we
propose the creation of an
interdisciplinary Marxist Study
Center — a center funded by
Stanford University, giving
courses for credit, with radical
faculty, and open to everyone.
