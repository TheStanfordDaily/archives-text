# useless rational dialogue
## Council Ignores Demands

Tuesday, the Daily printed Faculty Senate
Chairman Daniel Bershader's reply to a
moderately-worded request from the chairmen of
six groups of black students and faculty at Stanford.
Bershader's letter was an unusually honest
admission that those in authority at this university
have no interest in "rational dialogue" and refuse to
even listen to the reasons why they should change
certain of their policies. They leave us only the
alternatives which they spend so much of their time
condemning.
The request was for an Academic Council
examination of William Shockley's role as a
Stanford professor. The response separated the two
aspects of the problem: (1) the man's ability to
function as a teacher, and (2) the off-campus
repercussions of Shockley's trumpeting his theories
on race.
On the first problem, Bershader indicated that a
study of mechanisms for processing student
grievances involving student-faculty relations is
already being initiated. This response is less than
satisfactory, in my opinion, but it at least falls
within the university's traditional willingness to deal
with what it perceives as misbehavior with
on-campus ramifications. (A recent example is the
firing of Bruce Franklin because he was thought to
have said words which "justified" and "incited"
sit-ins and window breaking on this campus.)
The response to the second problem was also
typical: in two sentences Bershader told the reasons
why the question of misbehavior with off-campus
ramifications will never even be considered, much
less dealt with. Shockley's words here "justify" and
"incite" oppression and attempts to end a race and
a culture, in this country and elsewhere. Similarly,
recruiters' words in the Placement Center draw the
best talent for improving the machines with which
this country murders Indochinese. Some research on
campus, while giving "spinoffs" of basic knowledge
in the social and physical sciences, is being
purchased by the military to help it manipulate and
kill people more efficiently.
SRM members and others have persuasive reasons
for believing that the University can appropriately
deal with acts on its premises which destroy lives off
its premises. Richard Lyman, Daniel Bershader,
John Kaplan, and many others, have persuasive
reasons for believing that it cannot. And here we get
to the crux of the problem.
The people who believe that the university must

remain "neutral" (providing only a high salary,
excellent facilities, and considerable prestige), with
regard to those who cause no disruption within its
confines, happen to run the institution.
This means that change through "legitimate"
channels, aceeding to the power of those in charge,
can come only through changing the minds of those
people. (As Lyman reminds us occasionally, the
university is not run as a democracy.) The
near-impossibility of changing their minds tinges the
appeal to work through legitimate channels with a
Catch-22 aspect, but the problem runs deeper than
that.
What Bershader has told us - more forthrightly
than people usually do - is that these matters are
beyond the permissible scope of serious discussion.
In other words, there will be no change to change
anyone's minds. Instead of being input for a study
of the problem, Bershader's two-sentence comment
on the matter gives us the reasons why there will be
no study.
(The difference between this approach and
Lyman's willingness to sit down with the Columbae
fasters is only a difference in political
sophistication. When those with a monopoly on
"legitimate" power "listen" — but with a closed
mind, and explain a position — but decline to
negotiate about it, there is no real difference
between that and Bershader's refusal to waste time
on an inquiry when he can say now what the only
acceptdole answer is.)
Those who run the university can stop preaching
to the rest of us about using legitimate channels for
change, as they block whatever channels may exist.
They can stop making a joke out of the phrase
"rational dialogue," when they have shown us that
no one will listen. And, above all, they can stop
being surprised when we realize that they have left
us with no alternative but to use our own power.
This power is "illegitimate" according to the
rules which presently govern this community; it
means disrupting what they want to do just as they
prevent us from using this campus in many of the
ways we want to; and it involves "coercion" slightly
more apparent, but no more real, than that which
they apply. By refusing to even consider changing
crucial policies which they favor, they are
"justifying" disruptive acts on this campus far
better than Bruce Franklin ever did.
