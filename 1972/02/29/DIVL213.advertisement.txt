Tired of writing papers that nobody reads but your philosophy T.A.?
Fed up with student organizations that never have anything to show for their work? Or yours?
Want to learn from something besides books?
Then you need a change. Try the Stanford Daily. Taken two or three times a week in measured doses, it's
guaranteed to cure boredom.
Join the Daily when we start publishing again next quarter. Visit us if you have questions. A meeting for
interested students is scheduled Tuesday, March 7 at 4 p.m.
