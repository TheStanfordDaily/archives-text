# University Affects Palo Alto Life
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
Like it or not, few Palo Altans can
escape the influence Stanford
University exerts on their community.
The economics, politics, and social
atmosphere of the city of Palo Alto
are so entwined with the University
that one city official admits, "not
many people draw a clear distinction
between where Palo Alto ends and
Stanford begins."
Besides the University itself,
Stanford's development of a shopping
center, industrial park, and medical
center give Palo Alto a reputation as
being a progressive, wealthy and
innovative community. Few Palo Alto
leaders fail to realize the advantages of
being a college cousin.
"Economically," Palo Alto
Chamber of Commerce executive Dick
Kluzek says, "Stanford is the biggest
influence in the Palo Alto area. It
employs over 6,000 people, provides a
drawing card for dozens of
conventions in the area and is the
biggest taxpayer in Santa Clara
county."
Elaborate complexes like the
Cabana Hyatt House and Rickey's
depend almost exclusively on Stanford

conventions, Kluzek speculated, and
predicted that "a helluva lot of Palo
Alto merchants would go down
without Stanford students and
personnel."
Although merchants and
community leaders see economic
advantages to Palo Alto being in close
proximity to Stanford, many in the
community express anxiety and
disgust over what Chamber
Vice-President Kluzek describes as "a
feeling that Stanford is an ultra-liberal
university."
Political Influence
One businessman on University
Avenue angrily said, "I think Bruce
Franklin is a jackass and all the
radicals that flock around him make it
hard for decent citizens to get a
political word in edgewise."
Kluzek stops short of condemning
the political influence Stanford has in
the community. "Stanford certainly
creates exciting politics in this town,
but I think in many ways it's a healthy
thing."
Projects such as the development of
a Palo Alto Holiday Inn and an
extension of the Willow Expressway
through Stanford land were cited by

the Chamber as examples of
"frustration over the attitudes of
certain Stanford faculty and
students."
One city father felt that "Stanford
is blocking the needed development of
the Palo Alto area just because people
there would like to see Palo Alto like
it was 30 years ago."
Many Palo Altans actually have
very limited contact with students,
and what contact they do have often
comes when a group of students moves
off-campus into the city. One way or
another, the community adopts its
ideas about students from these social
encounters.
Tensions Cited
In the past, tensions between
students and Palo Alto resident o , have
been acute. A year ago, a controversy
developed over numerous communes
that had sprung up inside Palo Alto's
city limits. At the height of the
controversy, the City council received
more than 300 complaints by citizens
over violations of the building codes.
This year, however, the number of
complaints about too many people
living together in Palo Alto residential
districts has declined considerably.
John Bottema, City Building
Inspector, attributes the reduction to
the fact that there are fewer
communes operating in Palo Alto and
there is "a better communication
between students and other residents."
The most common hassles between
students and Palo Altans these days
arise from loud stereos, cars parked in
neighbor's driveways, and dogs.
One Stanford senior, Jim Frederick,
recalls an incident last fall when he
and three friends first moved
off-campus. "The first week my dog
ran next door and dug up our
neighbor's flowers. The guy was a
gardener, and when he saw what had
happened he came next door and
shouted for a few minutes and
threatened to shoot my dog.
'Occasional Growl'
"That's the last thing we've said to
each other since, except for an
occasional growl across the fence. He
also is always peeking out his windows
at us and walking in front of the house
looking for something."
Just as often, however, a
neighborhood takes in students as part
of the family of Palo Alto. Penny
Mitchell, another senior living in Palo
Alto, says her neighbors have picnics
and parties together. Still another
group of students living on Webster
Street in Palo Alto helped sponsor a

block party with their neighbors this
quarter.
Lieutenant Leo Peart, Palo Alto
Police department watchman in charge
of investigating complaints by city
residents, says ''many of the
complaining people indicate that the
people who are disturbing them are
Stanford students."
Usually the investigation of the
disturbance shows that the people
involved are just as often non-students,
says Peart, "but the community sort
of automatically judges most
student-age people in Palo Alto to be
Stanford people."
Speaking of his personal feelings
towards working in Palo Alto, Peart
said he enjoys the life, but "it is
upsetting to me where there are
demonstrations on campus that 1 have
to police.
"When the violence at Stanford
spills out into the community and
onto the police force as it did during
the Hospital demonstrations I think
that most of the police force is angry,"
Peart concluded.
One other large group of people
living in Palo Alto besides students are
old people. To many of these citizens,
Stanford represents much of what
they aren't happy with in Palo Alto.
Disorder Claimed
At the Senior Citizens Drop-In
Center at the Episcopal Church in Palo
Alto, a group of older residents agreed
"there is a lot of disorder at Stanford
and in the community now, and Palo
Alto is getting awfully messy."
One elderly woman complained she
no longer felt safe walking alone at
night in the city and suggested that
somehow "the militants on campus
and the dope addicts make it unsafe
for us."
Another woman, whose two sons
attended Stanford in the 1930'5,
disagreed with the gloomy description
of Stanford's influence in Palo Alto.
"The town isn't any less friendly now
than it was 30 years ago. The students
here give this town life, and the
contacts that 1 occasionally have with
Stanford are very enjoyable."
No matter what the age group or
economic status one enjoys in Palo
Alto, Stanford somehow affects the
attitudes and outlook of most Palo
Altans. As Chamber of Commerce man
Kluzek sums up the role Stanford
plays in Palo Alto, "The fact is, the
University has made Palo Alto what it
is today. The reason we're an
economically stable, progressive town
is because of Stanford's influence and
I think most people realize that."

and running in front of bicycles at Stanford. Dogs that sabotage gardens are one
thing that strain relations between off-campus students and Palo Alto residents.

onto the police force as it did during
the Hospital demonstrations I think
that most of the police force is angry,"
Peart concluded.
One other large group of people
living in Palo Alto besides students are
old people. To many of these citizens,
Stanford represents much of what
they aren't happy with in Palo Alto.
Disorder Claimed
At the Senior Citizens Drop-In
Center at the Episcopal Church in Palo
Alto, a group of older residents agreed
"there is a lot of disorder at Stanford
and in the community now, and Palo
Alto is getting awfully messy."
One elderly woman complained she
no longer felt safe walking alone at
night in the city and suggested that
somehow "the militants on campus
and the dope addicts make it unsafe
for us."
Another woman, whose two sons
attended Stanford in the 1930'5,
disagreed with the gloomy description
of Stanford's influence in Palo Alto.
"The town isn't any less friendly now
than it was 30 years ago. The students
here give this town life, and the
contacts that 1 occasionally have with
Stanford are very enjoyable."
No matter what the age group or
economic status one enjoys in Palo
Alto, Stanford somehow affects the
attitudes and outlook of most Palo
Altans. As Chamber of Commerce man
Kluzek sums up the role Stanford
plays in Palo Alto, "The fact is, the
University has made Palo Alto what it
is today. The reason we're an
economically stable, progressive town
is because of Stanford's influence and
I think most people realize that."

BOBBSEY TWINS VISIT THE BEACH—These two dogs are on a gala vacation
at the seashore, taking a break from a hard life of digging up gardens in Palo Alto
and running in front of bicycles at Stanford. Dogs that sabotage gardens are one
thing that strain relations between off-campus students and Palo Alto residents.
Like it or not, few Palo Altans can
escape the influence Stanford
University exerts on their community.
The economics, politics, and social
atmosphere of the city of Palo Alto
are so entwined with the University
that one city official admits, "not
many people draw a clear distinction
between where Palo Alto ends and
Stanford begins."
Besides the University itself,
Stanford's development of a shopping
center, industrial park, and medical
center give Palo Alto a reputation as
being a progressive, wealthy and
innovative community. Few Palo Alto
leaders fail to realize the advantages of
being a college cousin.
"Economically," Palo Alto
Chamber of Commerce executive Dick
Kluzek says, "Stanford is the biggest
influence in the Palo Alto area. It
employs over 6,000 people, provides a
drawing card for dozens of
conventions in the area and is the
biggest taxpayer in Santa Clara
county."
Elaborate complexes like the
Cabana Hyatt House and Rickey's
depend almost exclusively on Stanford

conventions, Kluzek speculated, and
predicted that "a helluva lot of Palo
Alto merchants would go down
without Stanford students and
personnel."
Although merchants and
community leaders see economic
advantages to Palo Alto being in close
proximity to Stanford, many in the
community express anxiety and
disgust over what Chamber
Vice-President Kluzek describes as "a
feeling that Stanford is an ultra-liberal
university."
Political Influence
One businessman on University
Avenue angrily said, "I think Bruce
Franklin is a jackass and all the
radicals that flock around him make it
hard for decent citizens to get a
political word in edgewise."
Kluzek stops short of condemning
the political influence Stanford has in
the community. "Stanford certainly
creates exciting politics in this town,
but I think in many ways it's a healthy
thing."
Projects such as the development of
a Palo Alto Holiday Inn and an
extension of the Willow Expressway
through Stanford land were cited by

the Chamber as examples of
"frustration over the attitudes of
certain Stanford faculty and
students."
One city father felt that "Stanford
is blocking the needed development of
the Palo Alto area just because people
there would like to see Palo Alto like
it was 30 years ago."
Many Palo Altans actually have
very limited contact with students,
and what contact they do have often
comes when a group of students moves
off-campus into the city. One way or
another, the community adopts its
ideas about students from these social
encounters.
Tensions Cited
In the past, tensions between
students and Palo Alto resident o , have
been acute. A year ago, a controversy
developed over numerous communes
that had sprung up inside Palo Alto's
city limits. At the height of the
controversy, the City council received
more than 300 complaints by citizens
over violations of the building codes.
This year, however, the number of
complaints about too many people
living together in Palo Alto residential
districts has declined considerably.
John Bottema, City Building
Inspector, attributes the reduction to
the fact that there are fewer
communes operating in Palo Alto and
there is "a better communication
between students and other residents."
The most common hassles between
students and Palo Altans these days
arise from loud stereos, cars parked in
neighbor's driveways, and dogs.
One Stanford senior, Jim Frederick,
recalls an incident last fall when he
and three friends first moved
off-campus. "The first week my dog
ran next door and dug up our
neighbor's flowers. The guy was a
gardener, and when he saw what had
happened he came next door and
shouted for a few minutes and
threatened to shoot my dog.
'Occasional Growl'
"That's the last thing we've said to
each other since, except for an
occasional growl across the fence. He
also is always peeking out his windows
at us and walking in front of the house
looking for something."
Just as often, however, a
neighborhood takes in students as part
of the family of Palo Alto. Penny
Mitchell, another senior living in Palo
Alto, says her neighbors have picnics
and parties together. Still another
group of students living on Webster
Street in Palo Alto helped sponsor a

block party with their neighbors this
quarter.
Lieutenant Leo Peart, Palo Alto
Police department watchman in charge
of investigating complaints by city
residents, says ''many of the
complaining people indicate that the
people who are disturbing them are
Stanford students."
Usually the investigation of the
disturbance shows that the people
involved are just as often non-students,
says Peart, "but the community sort
of automatically judges most
student-age people in Palo Alto to be
Stanford people."
Speaking of his personal feelings
towards working in Palo Alto, Peart
said he enjoys the life, but "it is
upsetting to me where there are
demonstrations on campus that 1 have
to police.
"When the violence at Stanford
spills out into the community and
onto the police force as it did during
the Hospital demonstrations I think

there is "a better communication
between students and other residents."
The most common hassles between
students and Palo Altans these days
arise from loud stereos, cars parked in
neighbor's driveways, and dogs.
One Stanford senior, Jim Frederick,
recalls an incident last fall when he
and three friends first moved
off-campus. "The first week my dog
ran next door and dug up our
neighbor's flowers. The guy was a
gardener, and when he saw what had
happened he came next door and
shouted for a few minutes and
threatened to shoot my dog.
'Occasional Growl'
"That's the last thing we've said to
each other since, except for an
occasional growl across the fence. He
also is always peeking out his windows
at us and walking in front of the house
looking for something."
Just as often, however, a
neighborhood takes in students as part
of the family of Palo Alto. Penny
Mitchell, another senior living in Palo
Alto, says her neighbors have picnics
and parties together. Still another
group of students living on Webster
Street in Palo Alto helped sponsor a

block party with their neighbors this
quarter.
Lieutenant Leo Peart, Palo Alto
Police department watchman in charge
of investigating complaints by city
residents, says ''many of the
complaining people indicate that the
people who are disturbing them are
Stanford students."
Usually the investigation of the
disturbance shows that the people
involved are just as often non-students,
says Peart, "but the community sort
of automatically judges most
student-age people in Palo Alto to be
Stanford people."
Speaking of his personal feelings
towards working in Palo Alto, Peart
said he enjoys the life, but "it is
upsetting to me where there are
demonstrations on campus that 1 have
to police.
"When the violence at Stanford
spills out into the community and
onto the police force as it did during
the Hospital demonstrations I think
that most of the police force is angry,"
Peart concluded.
One other large group of people
living in Palo Alto besides students are
old people. To many of these citizens,
Stanford represents much of what
they aren't happy with in Palo Alto.
Disorder Claimed
At the Senior Citizens Drop-In
Center at the Episcopal Church in Palo
Alto, a group of older residents agreed
"there is a lot of disorder at Stanford
and in the community now, and Palo
Alto is getting awfully messy."
One elderly woman complained she
no longer felt safe walking alone at
night in the city and suggested that
somehow "the militants on campus
and the dope addicts make it unsafe
for us."
Another woman, whose two sons
attended Stanford in the 1930'5,
disagreed with the gloomy description
of Stanford's influence in Palo Alto.
"The town isn't any less friendly now
than it was 30 years ago. The students
here give this town life, and the
contacts that 1 occasionally have with
Stanford are very enjoyable."
No matter what the age group or
economic status one enjoys in Palo
Alto, Stanford somehow affects the
attitudes and outlook of most Palo
Altans. As Chamber of Commerce man
Kluzek sums up the role Stanford
plays in Palo Alto, "The fact is, the
University has made Palo Alto what it
is today. The reason we're an
economically stable, progressive town
is because of Stanford's influence and
I think most people realize that."

BOBBSEY TWINS VISIT THE BEACH—These two dogs are on a gala vacation
at the seashore, taking a break from a hard life of digging up gardens in Palo Alto
and running in front of bicycles at Stanford. Dogs that sabotage gardens are one
thing that strain relations between off-campus students and Palo Alto residents.
Like it or not, few Palo Altans can
escape the influence Stanford
University exerts on their community.
The economics, politics, and social
atmosphere of the city of Palo Alto
are so entwined with the University
that one city official admits, "not
many people draw a clear distinction
between where Palo Alto ends and
Stanford begins."
Besides the University itself,
Stanford's development of a shopping
center, industrial park, and medical
center give Palo Alto a reputation as
being a progressive, wealthy and
innovative community. Few Palo Alto
leaders fail to realize the advantages of
being a college cousin.
"Economically," Palo Alto
Chamber of Commerce executive Dick
Kluzek says, "Stanford is the biggest
influence in the Palo Alto area. It
employs over 6,000 people, provides a
drawing card for dozens of
conventions in the area and is the
biggest taxpayer in Santa Clara
county."
Elaborate complexes like the
Cabana Hyatt House and Rickey's
depend almost exclusively on Stanford

conventions, Kluzek speculated, and
predicted that "a helluva lot of Palo
Alto merchants would go down
without Stanford students and
personnel."
Although merchants and
community leaders see economic
advantages to Palo Alto being in close
proximity to Stanford, many in the
community express anxiety and
disgust over what Chamber
Vice-President Kluzek describes as "a
feeling that Stanford is an ultra-liberal
university."
Political Influence
One businessman on University
Avenue angrily said, "I think Bruce
Franklin is a jackass and all the
radicals that flock around him make it
hard for decent citizens to get a
political word in edgewise."
Kluzek stops short of condemning
the political influence Stanford has in
the community. "Stanford certainly
creates exciting politics in this town,
but I think in many ways it's a healthy
thing."
Projects such as the development of
a Palo Alto Holiday Inn and an
extension of the Willow Expressway
through Stanford land were cited by

the Chamber as examples of
"frustration over the attitudes of
certain Stanford faculty and
students."
One city father felt that "Stanford
is blocking the needed development of
the Palo Alto area just because people
there would like to see Palo Alto like
it was 30 years ago."
Many Palo Altans actually have
very limited contact with students,
and what contact they do have often
comes when a group of students moves
off-campus into the city. One way or
another, the community adopts its
ideas about students from these social
encounters.
Tensions Cited
In the past, tensions between
students and Palo Alto resident o , have
been acute. A year ago, a controversy
developed over numerous communes
that had sprung up inside Palo Alto's
city limits. At the height of the
controversy, the City council received
more than 300 complaints by citizens
over violations of the building codes.
This year, however, the number of
complaints about too many people
living together in Palo Alto residential
districts has declined considerably.
John Bottema, City Building
Inspector, attributes the reduction to
the fact that there are fewer
communes operating in Palo Alto and
there is "a better communication
between students and other residents."
