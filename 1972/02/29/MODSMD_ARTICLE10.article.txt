## Mad Bomber Packard Returns 
### 
On Tuesday night, February
29, David Packard will receive two
awards. The Palo Alto Chamber of
Commerce will attempt to give
him its "Distinguished Citizen of
the Year" award. The anti-war
movement from all over the Bay
Area will gather at 5:30 p.m. at
the corner of Vista and El Camino
and then march to Rickey's Hyatt
House to give Packard the Mad
Bomber of the Year Award.
David Packard is a man of
extraordinary wealth and power.
His personal fortune is more than
$300 million, making him one of
the richest men in the United
States. He is an influential
member of the class of
corporation executives, bankers

and government officials who
manage and control the U.S.
empire.
In the past two decades,
Packard has been instrumental in
transforming the Midpeninsula
into a staging ground for United
States intervention in Asia. His
huge fortune has come mainly
from the technological warfare
with which U.S. imperialism has
scarred a large part of the world in
defense of American trade and
investment. His corporation's
(Hewlett-Packard) service to the
U.S. military reached its peak
during the Vietnam War. Over 10
percent of the Defense
Department's research and
development contracts are now

performed in the area between
San Francisco and San Jose. The
hub of the Midpeninsula's
military-industrial complex is
Stanford University, with its labs
and scientists.
Packard's involvement with
Stanford is long-standing. He got
his start in the Stanford
Electronics Labs, served for many
years as a Stanford Trustee, and
recently gave 2.6 million dollars
to help the University wage a
campaign of repression against the
anti-war movement.
Packard was rewarded for his
lifelong service to the American
military when Nixon appointed
him Deputy Secretary of Defense
in 1969. In this capacity he

helped preside over Nixon's
escalation of the Indochina War
into Laos and Cambodia and
escalation of the air war over
Vietnam.
Last April Packard spoke to
the Western Electronics
Manufacturers Association. The
speech was first moved from the
Palo Alto Hills Country Club to
Rickey's Hyatt House, and then
up to San Francisco — all for
security reasons. Packard was
furious that the manufacturers
were not willing to make a stand
for him in Palo Alto. He lectured
to them about how the people are
their deadly enemies!
That is why this dinner is so
important. Packard wants to

don ztceig

prove that he can control us. The
power of his class depends on it.
But we defy that power and
the repression Packard must use
to defend it. We feel deep
solidarity with the peoples of
Southeast Asia who are defeating
imperialism even as the U.S.
military bombs and bombs and
bombs.
Tonight the people of the
Midpeninsula will continue their
resistance to the violence of
corporate power that David
Packard embodies.
JOIN THE PEOPLE'S
CONTINUING OFFENSIVE
AGAINST U.S. IMPERIALISM.

extraordinary wealth and power.
His personal fortune is more than
$300 million, making him one of
the richest men in the United
States. He is an influential
member of the class of
corporation executives, bankers

and government officials who
manage and control the U.S.
empire.
In the past two decades,
Packard has been instrumental in
transforming the Midpeninsula
into a staging ground for United
States intervention in Asia. His
huge fortune has come mainly
from the technological warfare
with which U.S. imperialism has
scarred a large part of the world in
defense of American trade and
investment. His corporation's
(Hewlett-Packard) service to the
U.S. military reached its peak
during the Vietnam War. Over 10
percent of the Defense
Department's research and
development contracts are now

performed in the area between
San Francisco and San Jose. The
hub of the Midpeninsula's
military-industrial complex is
Stanford University, with its labs
and scientists.
Packard's involvement with
Stanford is long-standing. He got
his start in the Stanford
Electronics Labs, served for many
years as a Stanford Trustee, and
recently gave 2.6 million dollars
to help the University wage a
campaign of repression against the
anti-war movement.
Packard was rewarded for his
lifelong service to the American
military when Nixon appointed
him Deputy Secretary of Defense
in 1969. In this capacity he

helped preside over Nixon's
escalation of the Indochina War
into Laos and Cambodia and
escalation of the air war over
Vietnam.
Last April Packard spoke to
the Western Electronics
Manufacturers Association. The
speech was first moved from the
Palo Alto Hills Country Club to
Rickey's Hyatt House, and then
up to San Francisco — all for
security reasons. Packard was
furious that the manufacturers
were not willing to make a stand
for him in Palo Alto. He lectured
to them about how the people are
their deadly enemies!
That is why this dinner is so
important. Packard wants to

don ztceig

prove that he can control us. The
power of his class depends on it.
But we defy that power and
the repression Packard must use
to defend it. We feel deep
solidarity with the peoples of
Southeast Asia who are defeating
imperialism even as the U.S.
military bombs and bombs and
bombs.
Tonight the people of the
Midpeninsula will continue their
resistance to the violence of
corporate power that David
Packard embodies.
JOIN THE PEOPLE'S
CONTINUING OFFENSIVE
AGAINST U.S. IMPERIALISM.

On Tuesday night, February
29, David Packard will receive two
awards. The Palo Alto Chamber of
Commerce will attempt to give
him its "Distinguished Citizen of
the Year" award. The anti-war
movement from all over the Bay
Area will gather at 5:30 p.m. at
the corner of Vista and El Camino
and then march to Rickey's Hyatt
House to give Packard the Mad
Bomber of the Year Award.
