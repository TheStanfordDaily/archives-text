# China Recognition Predicted
## 
### 
Diplomatic relations between
the U.S. and China probably will
begin by the end of the year,
especially if President Nixon is
re-elected, History Professor
Lyman Van Slyke said in Los
Angeles Sunday.
Speaking at an alumni
conference, Van Slyke said

"Taiwan may be the only issue
standing in the way of diplomatic
relations. By implication, then,
Vietnam would not stand in the
way" although the two countries
do remain "far apart" on this
issue.
The U.S., he noted, "does not
challenge" the view that there is
"one China," which includes
Taiwan.
He quoted details of the joint
communique and said "1 take this
to mean a series of phased steps
leading to normal diplomatic
relations."
Van Slyke said the "most
important" facet of Nixon's
discussions with the Chinese
leaders was "the opportunity to
reassess the way we see China and
behave toward her." Our views
"long have been distorted"

because of a "mistaken
application of past history,"
which he blamed on a "cold war
analysis" and a comparison "with
Hitler's Germany."
This attitude, he said, was "the
genesis of our involvement in
Vietnam."
In the other direction, the
Chinese also "see the world
through lenses, and their lenses
are very different from ours." Van
Slyke said it was vital that
Americans "try to gain insight and
empathy" into China's views.
