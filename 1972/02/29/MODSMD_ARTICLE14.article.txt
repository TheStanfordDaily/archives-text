# What Happened To His Purse?
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
I could tell it was going to be a
pretty weird play as soon as I
realized I was the only guy in the
audience without a purse.
I had never read Shakespeare's
"The Tempest" or seen it
performed so I really didn't know
what it was about. But, after
seeing the New Age Ashram
Theater's rendition of it in San
Francisco Friday night, I still
don't, although it might be about
all these people wrecked on an
island. I was pretty wrecked
myself.
One of the main problems with
the performance was that because
of diction you could only
understand about half the lines.
This really didn't help the play's
message a whole lot. But the
costumes were great.

One guy wore a sequined
bathing cap, make-up, silver
sequined eye shadow, and a long
Japanese gown. And he was in the
audience.
In one sense the play was a real
moving performance. I had gone
to see it the week before and
found out it had been moved.
And been delayed a week. It was
supposed to open in a recycled
warehouse, the Project Artaud
Theater, which the fire marshal
had been kind enough to
condemn the night of the
performance. Thus it was moved
to the Boarding House Theater
where it opened a week late.
The Boarding House Theater
was really nice. It was the
nightclub next door that turned
out to be the real downer. During
the typical Shakespearean ending

when everybody winds up in the
same spot and discovers that
everyone is everybody else's
cousins, brothers, sons, daughters,
fathers and what have you,
suddenly the twangs of a bass
guitar came echoing through the
walls. There was also another
unfortunate occurrence when the
guy who played the King of
Naples fell down and broke part
of the stage.
The play did have some high
moments outside the minds of the
audience though. A Stanford
alum, TR Sanchez, was an
excellent Ferdinand. Soren
Meierhenry was good as Ariel as
was Constance Cushman as
Miranda.
But apparently even the cast
wasn't really pleased with the

production. One actor said that
Prospero had improvised about 90
percent of his lines which couldn't
have helped the performance.
But the play should improve. It
continues this week Wednesday
through Sunday, I think. Having
gone to Project Artaud myself the
week before, it might be a good
idea to call up and find out if the
play will be happening when and
where you think.
One other interesting fact
about the play was the flyers
being distributed in the lobby.
They advertised a future
production at the Boarding House
Theater of "Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf?" The interesting
part is that the two female leads,
Martha and Honey, are being
played by men. Well, that's show
biz.

what it was about. But, after
seeing the New Age Ashram
Theater's rendition of it in San
Francisco Friday night, I still
don't, although it might be about
all these people wrecked on an
island. I was pretty wrecked
myself.
One of the main problems with
the performance was that because
of diction you could only
understand about half the lines.
This really didn't help the play's
message a whole lot. But the
costumes were great.

One guy wore a sequined
bathing cap, make-up, silver
sequined eye shadow, and a long
Japanese gown. And he was in the
audience.
In one sense the play was a real
moving performance. I had gone
to see it the week before and
found out it had been moved.
And been delayed a week. It was
supposed to open in a recycled
warehouse, the Project Artaud
Theater, which the fire marshal
had been kind enough to
condemn the night of the
performance. Thus it was moved
to the Boarding House Theater
where it opened a week late.
The Boarding House Theater
was really nice. It was the
nightclub next door that turned
out to be the real downer. During
the typical Shakespearean ending

when everybody winds up in the
same spot and discovers that
everyone is everybody else's
cousins, brothers, sons, daughters,
fathers and what have you,
suddenly the twangs of a bass
guitar came echoing through the
walls. There was also another
unfortunate occurrence when the
guy who played the King of
Naples fell down and broke part
of the stage.
The play did have some high
moments outside the minds of the
audience though. A Stanford
alum, TR Sanchez, was an
excellent Ferdinand. Soren
Meierhenry was good as Ariel as
was Constance Cushman as
Miranda.
But apparently even the cast
wasn't really pleased with the

production. One actor said that
Prospero had improvised about 90
percent of his lines which couldn't
have helped the performance.
But the play should improve. It
continues this week Wednesday
through Sunday, I think. Having
gone to Project Artaud myself the
week before, it might be a good
idea to call up and find out if the
play will be happening when and
where you think.
One other interesting fact
about the play was the flyers
being distributed in the lobby.
They advertised a future
production at the Boarding House
Theater of "Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf?" The interesting
part is that the two female leads,
Martha and Honey, are being
played by men. Well, that's show
biz.
I could tell it was going to be a
pretty weird play as soon as I
realized I was the only guy in the
audience without a purse.
I had never read Shakespeare's
"The Tempest" or seen it
performed so I really didn't know
what it was about. But, after
seeing the New Age Ashram

don't, although it might be about
