Nixon Returns From China
ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Heading home after a
week in China, President Nixon said yesterday that
because of the journey "the chance for peace for
this generation of people is the best since the end of
World War 11.
"This makes me realize the big responsibility to
bring the world peace — to build a world where we
can all live in peace. That was thy purpose of our
trip."
Awaiting him in the capital that he left Feb. 17
was a red-carpet welcoming ceremony and a flurry
of criticism from conservatives upset by his pledge
that U.S. troops ultimately will be withdrawn from
Taiwan.
But there also was plenty of congressional
endorsement of his mission, including particularly
warm praise from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., a longtime critic of the administration.
In a communique issued Sunday in Shanghai,
Nixon promised to withdraw all U.S. troops from
Taiwan and agreed with the Chinese to develop
bilateral trade, exchange programs and contacts
between the two governments short of formal
diplomatic relations.
It was the portion of the communique relating to
Taiwan that caused most consternation among
conservatives.
Administration officials defended it as a logical
application of the Nixon Doctrine that allies should
be chiefly responsible for their own defense. And
they argued that the broad results justify the
concession, at any rate.
New ARVN Attack
SAIGON — The South Vietnamese army launched
another operation inside Cambodia and reported
nine battles with the enemy in that country and in
South Vietnam. Units of the U.S. Ist Air Cavalry
Division reported two clashes with enemy soldiers
yesterday only 30 miles northeast of this capital.
The Saigon command said the fighting between
its forces and Communist command troops has
killed or wounded nearly 200 soldiers on both sides.
The nine battles, the command said, took place
Sunday from Eastern Cambodia to the South China
Sea coast.
Along with the ground action, the air war also
picked up. The U.S. Command reported that North
Vietnamese batteries fired three surface-to-air
missiles at an Air Force F4 fighter-bomber and a
857 tactical bomber Sunday night in southern Laos.
The planes were flying missions against the Ho Chi

Minh trail, the command said. The planes did not
fire back, a spokesman added, because the missile
launch site was not spotted. The planes were not
hit.
Israelis Withdraw From Lebanon
MIDDLE EAST — Israeli forces withdrew from
southeastern Lebanon yesterday after four days of
attacks on Arab guerrilla havens near the border.
Israel claimed about 50 guerrillas had been slain and
nearly 100 wounded. Guerrillas acknowledged losses
of 20 dead and 36 wounded.
Leaflets distributed to villagers in the fighting
area warned of further Israeli assaults unless
Lebanon clamps down on guerrilla activity.
The attacks were in retaliation for guerrilla raids
last week that killed an Israeli couple and three
soldiers.
Tarn 4 No Amnesty'
WASHINGTON — Selective Service Director Curtis
W. Tarr told senators yesterday that granting
amnesty to Vietnam War draft resisters would be
unfair and set a dangerous precedent.
He said it could jeopardize the safety of the
nation in future conflicts, set a dangerous precedent
of selective acceptance of laws and be unfair to men
willing to enter the armed forces when drafted.
However, he said, some Americans who fled the
country and were not under indictment might have
since become eligible for conscientious objector
status because of Supreme Court decisions.
Tarr said he would instruct draft boards to give
these men a chance to reopen their draft status, but
Selective Service officials said the number is not
likely to be large.
Tarr replied later that he believes "that when the
authority to induct expires, the country can embark
on a careful examination of the full problem of
amnesty."
Younger Appeals Ruling
LOS ANGELES — California Atty. Gen. Evelle
Younger said yesterday his office will officially
launch its fight to reinstate the death penalty
Friday, but that resulting decisions won't affect
death row prisoners because their sentences have
been irreversibly commuted to life.
"No future action will affect anyone now under
sentence of life," said Younger. "They can never
again be given a more severe sentence than life."

The State Supreme Court's decision that the
death penalty is unconstitutional spared more than
100 men and women from the gas chamber.
Younger also said he feels that any person now
on trial — including Angela Davis — could not be
subject to the death penalty if the court's decision is
reversed.
Bill To Censure Judges
SACRAMENTO — A resolution to censure the six
state Supreme Court Justices who ruled the death
penalty is unconstitutional was introduced
yesterday by a conservative state legislator who
called the ruling "an insult to every red-blooded
citizen in California."
The proposal by Assemblyman Floyd Wakefield,
R-South Gate, would not seek the ouster of the
judges, but Wakefield offered to help any group that
wants to start a recall movement.
"The latest decision handed down by the
Supreme Court is an insult to every red-blooded
citizen in California to every law enforcement
official and to the victims, the widows and orphans
who have suffered because the hardened criminal
chose the path to 'Death Row' rather than the path
to law and order," Wakefield said.
"It has become apparent that our courts believe
in justice for the criminal while our law-abiding
citizen suffers the results," he said. "For those who
reason that the death penalty is not a deterrent to
crime, they just don't know the facts," he added.
Berrigan Implicated
HARRISBURG, Pa. — Star government witness
Boyd Douglas Jr. testified yesterday that the Rev.
Philip Berrigan solicited him to smuggle letters out
of the federal penitentiary where both were convicts
in the spring of 1970.
Douglas was a fellow convict when Berrigan
entered the Lewisburg penitentiary- May 1, 1970, to
begin a six-year term for destroying draft records.
Douglas had easy exit and entry to the prison as
a study-release convict at nearby Bucknell
University.
The government claims Douglas was acting as a
mail courier for Berrigan, when he turned FBI
informant.
The defense has sought to depict Douglas as "an
agent provacateur" in the purported conspiracy,
helping the FBI weave a false web about the
defendants.

The Saigon command said the fighting between
its forces and Communist command troops has
killed or wounded nearly 200 soldiers on both sides.
The nine battles, the command said, took place
Sunday from Eastern Cambodia to the South China
Sea coast.
Along with the ground action, the air war also
picked up. The U.S. Command reported that North
Vietnamese batteries fired three surface-to-air
missiles at an Air Force F4 fighter-bomber and a
857 tactical bomber Sunday night in southern Laos.
The planes were flying missions against the Ho Chi

Minh trail, the command said. The planes did not
fire back, a spokesman added, because the missile
launch site was not spotted. The planes were not
hit.
Israelis Withdraw From Lebanon
MIDDLE EAST — Israeli forces withdrew from
southeastern Lebanon yesterday after four days of
attacks on Arab guerrilla havens near the border.
Israel claimed about 50 guerrillas had been slain and
nearly 100 wounded. Guerrillas acknowledged losses
of 20 dead and 36 wounded.
Leaflets distributed to villagers in the fighting
area warned of further Israeli assaults unless
Lebanon clamps down on guerrilla activity.
The attacks were in retaliation for guerrilla raids
last week that killed an Israeli couple and three
soldiers.
Tarn 4 No Amnesty'
WASHINGTON — Selective Service Director Curtis
W. Tarr told senators yesterday that granting
amnesty to Vietnam War draft resisters would be
unfair and set a dangerous precedent.
He said it could jeopardize the safety of the
nation in future conflicts, set a dangerous precedent
of selective acceptance of laws and be unfair to men
willing to enter the armed forces when drafted.
However, he said, some Americans who fled the
country and were not under indictment might have
since become eligible for conscientious objector
status because of Supreme Court decisions.
Tarr said he would instruct draft boards to give
these men a chance to reopen their draft status, but
Selective Service officials said the number is not
likely to be large.
Tarr replied later that he believes "that when the
authority to induct expires, the country can embark
on a careful examination of the full problem of
amnesty."
Younger Appeals Ruling
LOS ANGELES — California Atty. Gen. Evelle
Younger said yesterday his office will officially
launch its fight to reinstate the death penalty
Friday, but that resulting decisions won't affect
death row prisoners because their sentences have
been irreversibly commuted to life.
"No future action will affect anyone now under
sentence of life," said Younger. "They can never
again be given a more severe sentence than life."

The State Supreme Court's decision that the
death penalty is unconstitutional spared more than
100 men and women from the gas chamber.
Younger also said he feels that any person now
on trial — including Angela Davis — could not be
subject to the death penalty if the court's decision is
reversed.
Bill To Censure Judges
SACRAMENTO — A resolution to censure the six
state Supreme Court Justices who ruled the death
penalty is unconstitutional was introduced
yesterday by a conservative state legislator who
called the ruling "an insult to every red-blooded
citizen in California."
The proposal by Assemblyman Floyd Wakefield,
R-South Gate, would not seek the ouster of the
judges, but Wakefield offered to help any group that
wants to start a recall movement.
"The latest decision handed down by the
Supreme Court is an insult to every red-blooded
citizen in California to every law enforcement
official and to the victims, the widows and orphans
who have suffered because the hardened criminal
chose the path to 'Death Row' rather than the path
to law and order," Wakefield said.
"It has become apparent that our courts believe
in justice for the criminal while our law-abiding
citizen suffers the results," he said. "For those who
reason that the death penalty is not a deterrent to
crime, they just don't know the facts," he added.
Berrigan Implicated
HARRISBURG, Pa. — Star government witness
Boyd Douglas Jr. testified yesterday that the Rev.
Philip Berrigan solicited him to smuggle letters out
of the federal penitentiary where both were convicts
in the spring of 1970.
Douglas was a fellow convict when Berrigan
entered the Lewisburg penitentiary- May 1, 1970, to
begin a six-year term for destroying draft records.
Douglas had easy exit and entry to the prison as
a study-release convict at nearby Bucknell
University.
The government claims Douglas was acting as a
mail courier for Berrigan, when he turned FBI
informant.
The defense has sought to depict Douglas as "an
agent provacateur" in the purported conspiracy,
helping the FBI weave a false web about the
defendants.
Nixon Returns From China
ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Heading home after a
week in China, President Nixon said yesterday that
because of the journey "the chance for peace for
this generation of people is the best since the end of
World War 11.
"This makes me realize the big responsibility to
bring the world peace — to build a world where we
can all live in peace. That was thy purpose of our
trip."
Awaiting him in the capital that he left Feb. 17
was a red-carpet welcoming ceremony and a flurry
of criticism from conservatives upset by his pledge
that U.S. troops ultimately will be withdrawn from
Taiwan.
But there also was plenty of congressional
endorsement of his mission, including particularly
warm praise from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., a longtime critic of the administration.
In a communique issued Sunday in Shanghai,
Nixon promised to withdraw all U.S. troops from
Taiwan and agreed with the Chinese to develop
bilateral trade, exchange programs and contacts
between the two governments short of formal
diplomatic relations.
It was the portion of the communique relating to
Taiwan that caused most consternation among
conservatives.
Administration officials defended it as a logical
application of the Nixon Doctrine that allies should
be chiefly responsible for their own defense. And
they argued that the broad results justify the
concession, at any rate.

However, he said, some Americans who fled the
country and were not under indictment might have
since become eligible for conscientious objector
status because of Supreme Court decisions.
Tarr said he would instruct draft boards to give
these men a chance to reopen their draft status, but
Selective Service officials said the number is not
likely to be large.
Tarr replied later that he believes "that when the
authority to induct expires, the country can embark
on a careful examination of the full problem of
amnesty."
Younger Appeals Ruling
LOS ANGELES — California Atty. Gen. Evelle
Younger said yesterday his office will officially
launch its fight to reinstate the death penalty
Friday, but that resulting decisions won't affect
death row prisoners because their sentences have
been irreversibly commuted to life.
"No future action will affect anyone now under
sentence of life," said Younger. "They can never
again be given a more severe sentence than life."

The State Supreme Court's decision that the
death penalty is unconstitutional spared more than
100 men and women from the gas chamber.
Younger also said he feels that any person now
on trial — including Angela Davis — could not be
subject to the death penalty if the court's decision is
reversed.
Bill To Censure Judges
SACRAMENTO — A resolution to censure the six
state Supreme Court Justices who ruled the death
penalty is unconstitutional was introduced
yesterday by a conservative state legislator who
called the ruling "an insult to every red-blooded
citizen in California."
The proposal by Assemblyman Floyd Wakefield,
R-South Gate, would not seek the ouster of the
judges, but Wakefield offered to help any group that
wants to start a recall movement.
"The latest decision handed down by the
Supreme Court is an insult to every red-blooded
citizen in California to every law enforcement
official and to the victims, the widows and orphans
who have suffered because the hardened criminal
chose the path to 'Death Row' rather than the path
to law and order," Wakefield said.
"It has become apparent that our courts believe
in justice for the criminal while our law-abiding
citizen suffers the results," he said. "For those who
reason that the death penalty is not a deterrent to
crime, they just don't know the facts," he added.
Berrigan Implicated
HARRISBURG, Pa. — Star government witness
Boyd Douglas Jr. testified yesterday that the Rev.
Philip Berrigan solicited him to smuggle letters out
of the federal penitentiary where both were convicts
in the spring of 1970.
Douglas was a fellow convict when Berrigan
entered the Lewisburg penitentiary- May 1, 1970, to
begin a six-year term for destroying draft records.
Douglas had easy exit and entry to the prison as
a study-release convict at nearby Bucknell
University.
The government claims Douglas was acting as a
mail courier for Berrigan, when he turned FBI
informant.
The defense has sought to depict Douglas as "an
agent provacateur" in the purported conspiracy,
helping the FBI weave a false web about the
defendants.
Nixon Returns From China
ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Heading home after a
week in China, President Nixon said yesterday that
because of the journey "the chance for peace for
this generation of people is the best since the end of
World War 11.
"This makes me realize the big responsibility to
bring the world peace — to build a world where we
can all live in peace. That was thy purpose of our
trip."
Awaiting him in the capital that he left Feb. 17
was a red-carpet welcoming ceremony and a flurry
of criticism from conservatives upset by his pledge
that U.S. troops ultimately will be withdrawn from
Taiwan.
But there also was plenty of congressional
endorsement of his mission, including particularly
warm praise from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., a longtime critic of the administration.
In a communique issued Sunday in Shanghai,
Nixon promised to withdraw all U.S. troops from
Taiwan and agreed with the Chinese to develop
bilateral trade, exchange programs and contacts
between the two governments short of formal
diplomatic relations.
It was the portion of the communique relating to
Taiwan that caused most consternation among
conservatives.
Administration officials defended it as a logical
application of the Nixon Doctrine that allies should
be chiefly responsible for their own defense. And
they argued that the broad results justify the
concession, at any rate.
New ARVN Attack
SAIGON — The South Vietnamese army launched
another operation inside Cambodia and reported
nine battles with the enemy in that country and in
South Vietnam. Units of the U.S. Ist Air Cavalry
Division reported two clashes with enemy soldiers
yesterday only 30 miles northeast of this capital.
The Saigon command said the fighting between
its forces and Communist command troops has
killed or wounded nearly 200 soldiers on both sides.
The nine battles, the command said, took place
Sunday from Eastern Cambodia to the South China
Sea coast.
Along with the ground action, the air war also
picked up. The U.S. Command reported that North
Vietnamese batteries fired three surface-to-air
missiles at an Air Force F4 fighter-bomber and a
857 tactical bomber Sunday night in southern Laos.
The planes were flying missions against the Ho Chi

Minh trail, the command said. The planes did not
fire back, a spokesman added, because the missile
launch site was not spotted. The planes were not
hit.
Israelis Withdraw From Lebanon
MIDDLE EAST — Israeli forces withdrew from
southeastern Lebanon yesterday after four days of
attacks on Arab guerrilla havens near the border.
Israel claimed about 50 guerrillas had been slain and
nearly 100 wounded. Guerrillas acknowledged losses
of 20 dead and 36 wounded.
Leaflets distributed to villagers in the fighting
area warned of further Israeli assaults unless
Lebanon clamps down on guerrilla activity.
The attacks were in retaliation for guerrilla raids
last week that killed an Israeli couple and three
soldiers.
Tarn 4 No Amnesty'
WASHINGTON — Selective Service Director Curtis
W. Tarr told senators yesterday that granting
amnesty to Vietnam War draft resisters would be
unfair and set a dangerous precedent.
He said it could jeopardize the safety of the
nation in future conflicts, set a dangerous precedent
of selective acceptance of laws and be unfair to men
willing to enter the armed forces when drafted.
However, he said, some Americans who fled the
country and were not under indictment might have
since become eligible for conscientious objector
status because of Supreme Court decisions.
Tarr said he would instruct draft boards to give
these men a chance to reopen their draft status, but
Selective Service officials said the number is not
likely to be large.
Tarr replied later that he believes "that when the
authority to induct expires, the country can embark
on a careful examination of the full problem of
amnesty."
