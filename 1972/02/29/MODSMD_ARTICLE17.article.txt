# Keller Starts Writing Drive To Keep Open Recruiting
## 
### 
Ralph Keller, director of Stanford's Placement Center,
has been organizing a letter writing campaign to defend
the facility's open recruiting policy,during the past few
weeks.
In a letter dated February 23, 1972, Keller wrote to
current registrants of the center asking them to give an
expression of support to President Richard Lyman
"immediately" for his stand on open recruiting.
Keller added that a previous writing campaign to Tim
Clark, chairman of the Committee on Student Services,
supporting the center's activities, "had a favorable effect
upon the recommendations the Committee made to
President Lyman."
Clark was not available to comment on the letter's
effect, but a student member of the committee guessed
that about 50 letters, indicating satisfaction and support
for the Placement Center's activities were sent to COSS.
COSS recently released the full text of a report which
asked a ban on Armed Forces recruiting at the "formal
placement facilities" here but turned down a proposal
barring companies which produce weapons of war.
Plea For Help
The letter began with the underlined statement "We
desperately need your help!" and continued with a
statement by Lyman, "We may have to face up to the
choice between open recruiting and none," made at the
most recent Academic Senate meeting.
If the student using the center supports open
recruiting, Keller added, he should give Lyman an
"expression of support."
The issue of open recruiting is so important in Keller's
opinion, that without the support that comes to us

indirectly through recruiting, "there is no way in which
the Placement Center can survive in the form known to
you and me."
"The recent disruptions at the Center have literally
kept us from operating," Keller added.
Keller commented yesterday that the letter, "was a
deliberate effort on our part for those students who favor
open recruiting to make their views known."
In a note attached to the letter, Edmond Mantani
assistant director of the center, asked those registered for
teaching positions to "let your conscience be your guide,"
on whether to write to Lyman.
Personal Decision
Mantani stated that "As intelligent mature individuals 1
am certain that you feel you are capable of deciding for
whom you work. It is inconceivable to me that you would
tolerate being dictated to by a small group of students."
At the end of Keller's letter, he thanked users of the
center for their previous support, and stated that "I would
consider it a personal favor if you would send me a copy
of your letter to President Lyman."
An additional appendix to the COSS report, by law
student Micheal Goldstein, released yesterday, asked that
if "economic coercion is the only reason why the
recruiter's presence will be tolerated, the fact of that
coercion . . . should be made known publicly as the basis
for Placement Center policies."
The memorandum to COSS then explored a federal law
which reportedly would make Stanford lose $16 million
in Defense Department and NASA contracts and
concluded that Lyman or the ASSU Council of Presidents
should work to change the law.

whom you work. It is inconceivable to me that you would
tolerate being dictated to by a small group of students."
At the end of Keller's letter, he thanked users of the
center for their previous support, and stated that "I would
consider it a personal favor if you would send me a copy
of your letter to President Lyman."
An additional appendix to the COSS report, by law
student Micheal Goldstein, released yesterday, asked that
if "economic coercion is the only reason why the
recruiter's presence will be tolerated, the fact of that
coercion . . . should be made known publicly as the basis
for Placement Center policies."
The memorandum to COSS then explored a federal law
which reportedly would make Stanford lose $16 million
in Defense Department and NASA contracts and
concluded that Lyman or the ASSU Council of Presidents
should work to change the law.


FREE AT LAST—Black revolutionary Angela Davis walks to a press conference
Friday in San .lose after she had been released on $102,500 bail after 16 months
imprisonment. Davis' murder-kidnap-conspiracy trial for an August 1970
shoot-out outside the Marin County Civic Center began Monday in the Santa
Clara County Civic Center in San Jose. Jury selection for the trial will continue
today and the trial is expected to last anywhere from four to nine months.
Ralph Keller, director of Stanford's Placement Center,
has been organizing a letter writing campaign to defend
the facility's open recruiting policy,during the past few
weeks.
In a letter dated February 23, 1972, Keller wrote to
current registrants of the center asking them to give an
expression of support to President Richard Lyman
"immediately" for his stand on open recruiting.
Keller added that a previous writing campaign to Tim
Clark, chairman of the Committee on Student Services,
supporting the center's activities, "had a favorable effect
upon the recommendations the Committee made to
President Lyman."
Clark was not available to comment on the letter's
effect, but a student member of the committee guessed
that about 50 letters, indicating satisfaction and support
for the Placement Center's activities were sent to COSS.
COSS recently released the full text of a report which
asked a ban on Armed Forces recruiting at the "formal
placement facilities" here but turned down a proposal
barring companies which produce weapons of war.
Plea For Help
The letter began with the underlined statement "We
desperately need your help!" and continued with a
statement by Lyman, "We may have to face up to the
choice between open recruiting and none," made at the
most recent Academic Senate meeting.
If the student using the center supports open
recruiting, Keller added, he should give Lyman an
"expression of support."
The issue of open recruiting is so important in Keller's
opinion, that without the support that comes to us

indirectly through recruiting, "there is no way in which
the Placement Center can survive in the form known to
you and me."
"The recent disruptions at the Center have literally
kept us from operating," Keller added.
Keller commented yesterday that the letter, "was a
deliberate effort on our part for those students who favor
open recruiting to make their views known."
In a note attached to the letter, Edmond Mantani
assistant director of the center, asked those registered for
teaching positions to "let your conscience be your guide,"
on whether to write to Lyman.
Personal Decision
Mantani stated that "As intelligent mature individuals 1
am certain that you feel you are capable of deciding for
whom you work. It is inconceivable to me that you would
tolerate being dictated to by a small group of students."
