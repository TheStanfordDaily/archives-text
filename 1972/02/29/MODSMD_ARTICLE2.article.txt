# Misinformation Everywhere
## Workers Confused On Union Issue 
### GLENN GARVIN 
"They tell me the union don't let
me retire when I'm 62, I don't get my
money if they have a union," the old
man said as he looked up from raking
leaves.
"I hear they don't give welfare to
you if the union comes," he
continued, struggling to find the words
in a language he hardly spoke. "Is it
true? What you think?"
The old man is Guillermo De
Souza. De Souza is a 61-year old
groundskeeper at Stanford, and his
baseless fears are typical of some of
the rumors that are circulating as the
time grows near for University workers
to choose a union to represent them.

De Souza's hands, knotted with
age, have arthritis. He can't work at all
during the cold season, and he want:,
to retire after his next birthday. Bui
someone, somewhere, told him that he
would lose retirement pay and would
be ineligible for welfare if Stanford
unionizes.
No Truth
Executives from all three unions
competing in the March 7 employee
elections said there was no truth to
that at all.
But Guillermo De Souza will
probably vote against unions next
month.
A Daily survey of employees
eligible to vote showed that a good
many workers will vote with similar
misinformation or noninformation. A
lot of them understand only the
simplest of the issues involved in the

election; many will vote for name
identification alone.
Andrew Kudlasik, a proofreader at
the Stanford Press, says he's backing
United Stanford Employees (USE) by
default — because he hasn't heard
much about the other two unions.
No Publicity
"USE is the only union you hear
about doing anything for particular
people," Kudlasik said thoughtfully.
"That's not to say the other two don't
do anything ... I just don't hear about
it. It's probably just a matter of
publicity."
Another proofreader claimed that
Press employees shouldn't really be in
a group with other Stanford workers.
"We're such a tiny organization,
separated from large groups of
employees," the proofreader pointed
out. "We do a kind of work that isn't
found anywhere else here. We have
nothing to do with the autopsy room,
or the dishwashers, or the steam plant,
or the laborers. The greatest work we
do is lift a pencil from time to time.
"I think we're sufficiently
competent to handle our own relations
with the University. But I don't think
everyone else on the staff is," she
concluded.
Kudlasik didn't agree, though: "We
all have the same employer, don't
we?"
It took the Daily the better part of
the afternoon to get around and talk
to employees, and the same problem
faces the unions in communicating
with employees. The workers who will
be voting are split into little groups of

five or six, scattered all over the
campus, and a lot of them haven't
even seen a union representative, much
less talked to one at length. The
University has been trying to keep the
problem minimal by devoting a great
deal of space in the Staff News to the
election; Employees Organize, the
USE newspaper, is the only other
publication that reaches a high
percentage of workers.
Newspaper
The USE newspaper has kept that
union in the race, while the Teamsters

have been able to count on the fact
that most workers have heard of them.
California School Employees
Association-Stanford Employees
Association (CSEA-SEA) seems to
have suffered the most from a lack of
publicity. Not a single worker the
Daily talked to indicated he would
vote for CSEA-SEA.
USE suffers no such lack of
exposure, but the militant political
position that workers associate the
union with has hurt, as well as the
Teamsters' charge that USE has no
muscle to enforce a strike.
The Teamsters, on the other hand,
seemed to be the most popular.
Narcia Ramos, a food service
worker at Roble, for instance, speaks
no English. She showed no signs of
comprehension when Daily reporters
mentioned USE and CSEA-SEA, but
the word "Teamsters" brought a smile
of recognition and a promise that she
would vote for the Teamsters.
But, speaking through an

interpreter, the only reason she could
give was "it is to my convenience."
She indicated no union representatives
had been out to speak to her.
The Teamsters have built their
campaign around the issue of strength,
claiming that their union is the only
one strong enough to effectively deal
with the University.
Winning Votes
That argument has a certain appeal,
and it is winning the Teamsters some
votes.
