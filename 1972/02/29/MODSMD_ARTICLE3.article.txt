# Protest Set For Packard Dinner
## 
### 
A demonstration intended to present David Packard
with a "Mad Bomber of the Year Award" is planned
tonight at Rickey's Hyatt House in Palo Alto.
Packard, a former Trustee and former Deputy Defense
Department Secretary, will appear at a dinner of the Palo
Aito Chamber of Commerce to receive its "Distinguished
Citizen of the Year" award.
The demonstration is expected to draw members of the
anti-war movement from throughout the Bay Area. A
march is planned for 5:30 p.m. from a vacant lot at the
corner of Vista and El Camino, near Rickey's.
A speech by Packard last year to a group of electronics
manufacturers was moved from Rickey's to San Francisco
after threatened by demonstrations.
Packard Criticized
A letter from Don Zweig of the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement (SRM) in today's Daily calls
Packard "an influential member of the class of
corporation executives, bankers and government officials
who manage and control the U.S. empire."
Tonight's dinner is important, Zweig claims, because
"Packard wants to prove that he can control us. The

power of his class depends on it."
"We defy that power," the letter says, adding "tonight
the people of the Midpeninsula will continue their
resistance to the violence of corporate power that David
Packard embodies."
Palo Alto Police have been preparing for the
demonstration, but an open letter yesterday by Chief
James Zurcher stressed the possibilities for a quiet
demonstration, calling for cooperation from protesters.
Traffic Plans
If the crowd is large enough, special traffic
arrangements will be made, possibly including blocking
one lane of El Camino for the demonstrators' use.
At a SRM meeting last night, about 50 persons
discussed the planned protest, and other SRM activities
this week. Leaders said car pools for the Packard march
will leave Tresidder parking lot about 5:00 p.m.
Plans were also discussed for an appearance at an
upcoming Academic Senate meeting. The group discussed
topics they wanted raised at the meeting, among them
questions about Placement Center and research policy,
and Prof. William Shockley's conduct as a professor. No
disruption of the meeting is planned.
