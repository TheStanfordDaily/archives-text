# Long Delayed Davis Trial Opens As Jury Selection Starts Slowly
## 
### FRED MANN Commentary 
The Angela Davis trial began
yesterday. From the looks of things, it
may never end.
In a quiet, slow-moving opening to
what may prove to be the longest trial
in state history, Judge Richard E.
Arnason presided over the beginning
of the jury selection process. By
adjournment of the afternoon session,
seven prospective jurors had been
questioned about their availability to
serve in the trial (expected to last close
to six months), and their prejudices
caused by pre-trial publicity accorded
Davis. Three people were excused, and
four were held temporarily for more
questioning, but none chosen.
Davis faces murder-kidnap
conspiracy charges stemming from her
alleged connection with the August 7,
1970, Marin Civic Center shoot-out in
which four persons died.
The day started early for the press,
spectators, and Santa Clara Sheriff's
Deputies who wandered about on
different sides of the numerous
newly-installed security fences at the
San Jose Civic Center complex. In the
basement press headquarters,
broadcasting networks and large
metropolitan newspapers picked up
guaranteed seat assignments, while
smaller publications and most radio
personnel struggled to gain a place
inside the main courtroom.
Both press and spectators were
shuffled through check points, marked
off lists, frisked head to toe, and
metallically detected with the latest
electronic equipment. Passing all tests,
70 people entered the surprisingly
small Criminal Courtroom Number 1,
finding it free of bullet-proof glass,
heavily armed guards, and any of the
trial's participants.
After a reading by a deputy
outlining proper decorum in the
courtroom, prosecutors Albert Harris,
state assistant attorney general, and
Clifford Thompson, deputy attorney
general, entered the chambers
solemnly. Moments later, Davis and
her attorneys took their seats with a
similar quiet and restraint. There were
no clenched fists, only smiles by the
defendant aimed at her family sitting
in the audience, and grabs at a small
box of Kleenex to fight a head cold.
'The People' vs. Angela
Case No. 52613, The People of the
State of California vs. Angela Y. Davis
began after some 16 months and 40
minutes of delay, at 10:10 a.m. After
"The People" moved to strike a
paragraph from their indictment

against Davis because, as they later
explained, "We're not going to prove
it" — a motion denied by Arnason —
the long process of choosing a jury
began.
Names of seven women and five
men were selected from a small
wooden drum on the desk of the court
clerk. Half of those picked were under
30 years old, four under 21. All were
white. (It was reported that in the
entire jury pool of 116 persons, only
one was black.)
The first 12 chosen included two
grandmothers, one grandfather, four
college students (one being Brynne
Motiska, a Stanford sophomore), one
secretary, and the daughter of a
recently retired captain in the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Office.
"Our purpose is to select a fair and
impartial jury," said the judge, as the
clerk began to read aloud the Grand
Jury indictment against the black
revolutionary. Jurors listened intently
and studied the striking defendant.
She followed along as he read, popped
a green Lifesaver, and watched her
family while all heard her being
accused of purchasing the guns used in
the shoot-out. Arnason stared at the
ceiling.
"That charges have been made
against the defendant is no evidence
whatsoever that she is guilty,"
reiterated the judge. The reading had
seemed impressive, but the jury tried
to show agreement with him.
"Everything relating to human affairs
is open to some doubt," he went on.
"What we are concerned with is
'reasonable doubt.' The people must
prove, through the [Assistant]

Attorney General, her guilt beyond all
reasonable doubt" for conviction.
Long List
Harris ran down the list of 104
prospective witnesses that the
prosecution intends to call, including
among them employees of gun shops,
gas stations, Howard Johnson's motels
and Georgia Jackson, mother of
Soledad Brother George Jackson and
Jonathan Jackson, one of those who
died in the August 7 incident.
The jury candidates knew none of
the names read (thereby pasing the
first test of eligibility), and received
another admonition from Arnason
before breaking for lunch. "Ours is a
government of laws, not of men," he
mused. "As jurors, you must take the
law as it is, not as you think it should
be. I am the judge of law — you are
the judges of fact."
Returning from the hour and one
half break proved to be more difficult
than it had been in the morning for
the press, as a reporter's accidental
lean against an emergency exit door
set off buzzers and bells that only
intensified when responding deputies
attempted to locate the villian. After
some difficult run-ins with the metal
detector, a repeat performance of the
courtroom etiquette soliloquy, and the
return of the accused with a new
package of Kleenex, the jury voir dire
began.
Both sides are allowed 20
pre-emptory challenges during the
course of the jury selection, but none
were used yesterday.
Two of the students were excused
quickly because they said the time
involved would cause scholastic and
financial hardships. A secretary for the
Insurance Corporation of America said
she also could not afford to serve and
lose the income from her job. She
agreed, however, to ask her employer if
she could continue to draw salary
while she "performed her civic duty."
A fourth prospective juror claimed
that time would not be a problem. "It
wouldn't interfere with anything
except my bowling," she said.
Publicity in the newspapers did not
affect her view of Davis she claimed.
"My bowling keeps me pretty busy,"
she added. "I only glance through it
[the paper| to see who's bowling or
wrestling." Steadfastly maintaining
that she has never discussed the case
with anyone and has no preconceived
notions about Davis, she concluded,
"She's alright — she's as good as any of
us until she's found guilty."
She was held over for further
questioning today.
Ideological Conflict
Most of the questions directed at
others concerned Davis' image as a
member of the Communist Party. One
woman disqualified herself after
admitting she felt the University of
California Regents were correct in
firing Davis because "it is improper for
Communists to teach in the public
schools."
"I suppose 1 couldn't give her a fair
trial," she concluded.
The final prospective juror of the
afternoon questioned, a middle-aged
employee of IBM, answered defense
attorney Leo Branton's questions for
over an hour, at first admitting that his
distaste for Communists would
preclude him from judging Davis
impartially, then seemingly reversing
himself. "I will judge only on the facts
of this case, not Communist Party
beliefs," he said.
Asked if he believed a Communist
would "lie and cheat, under oath if
necessary, to overthrow the
government of the United Stater.," the
man answered yes. "Anyone who
takes radical action, whether
Communist or not, would tend to lie,"
he remarked. Later he stated, "Just
because a person is a Communist
doesn't mean he is dishonest."
Branton asked for the juror's

disqualification for prejudice, and
Arnason, noting the lateness of the
hour, took the request under
advisement. He will rule on it this
morning.
Leaving the security area, Davis
was, as always, swarmed by newsmen
and TV cameras. Her counsel Howard
Moore Jr., usually the most prominent
of her attorneys, had said nothing all
day. After washing down two aspirin
during the last portion of yesterday's
proceedings, and quietly leaving the
courtroom, he too was caught by
reporters.
"We said all along that she couldn't
get a fair trial in this county by a jury
of her peers," he sighed. "If this jury
panel is indicative of what's to come,
I'd sav we were correct."

was, as always, swarmed by newsmen
and TV cameras. Her counsel Howard
Moore Jr., usually the most prominent
of her attorneys, had said nothing all
day. After washing down two aspirin
during the last portion of yesterday's
proceedings, and quietly leaving the
courtroom, he too was caught by
reporters.
"We said all along that she couldn't
get a fair trial in this county by a jury
of her peers," he sighed. "If this jury
panel is indicative of what's to come,
I'd sav we were correct."
The Angela Davis trial began
yesterday. From the looks of things, it
may never end.
In a quiet, slow-moving opening to
what may prove to be the longest trial
in state history, Judge Richard E.
Arnason presided over the beginning
of the jury selection process. By
adjournment of the afternoon session,
seven prospective jurors had been
questioned about their availability to
serve in the trial (expected to last close
to six months), and their prejudices
caused by pre-trial publicity accorded
Davis. Three people were excused, and
four were held temporarily for more
questioning, but none chosen.
Davis faces murder-kidnap
conspiracy charges stemming from her
alleged connection with the August 7,
1970, Marin Civic Center shoot-out in
which four persons died.
The day started early for the press,
spectators, and Santa Clara Sheriff's
Deputies who wandered about on
different sides of the numerous
newly-installed security fences at the
San Jose Civic Center complex. In the
basement press headquarters,
broadcasting networks and large
metropolitan newspapers picked up
guaranteed seat assignments, while
smaller publications and most radio
personnel struggled to gain a place
inside the main courtroom.
Both press and spectators were
shuffled through check points, marked
off lists, frisked head to toe, and
metallically detected with the latest
electronic equipment. Passing all tests,
70 people entered the surprisingly
small Criminal Courtroom Number 1,
finding it free of bullet-proof glass,
heavily armed guards, and any of the
trial's participants.
After a reading by a deputy
outlining proper decorum in the
courtroom, prosecutors Albert Harris,
state assistant attorney general, and
Clifford Thompson, deputy attorney
general, entered the chambers
solemnly. Moments later, Davis and
her attorneys took their seats with a
similar quiet and restraint. There were
no clenched fists, only smiles by the
defendant aimed at her family sitting
in the audience, and grabs at a small
box of Kleenex to fight a head cold.
'The People' vs. Angela
Case No. 52613, The People of the
State of California vs. Angela Y. Davis
began after some 16 months and 40
minutes of delay, at 10:10 a.m. After
"The People" moved to strike a
paragraph from their indictment

against Davis because, as they later
explained, "We're not going to prove
it" — a motion denied by Arnason —
the long process of choosing a jury
began.
Names of seven women and five
men were selected from a small
wooden drum on the desk of the court
clerk. Half of those picked were under
30 years old, four under 21. All were
white. (It was reported that in the
entire jury pool of 116 persons, only
one was black.)
The first 12 chosen included two
grandmothers, one grandfather, four
college students (one being Brynne
Motiska, a Stanford sophomore), one
secretary, and the daughter of a
recently retired captain in the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Office.
"Our purpose is to select a fair and
impartial jury," said the judge, as the
clerk began to read aloud the Grand
Jury indictment against the black
revolutionary. Jurors listened intently
and studied the striking defendant.
She followed along as he read, popped
a green Lifesaver, and watched her
family while all heard her being
accused of purchasing the guns used in
the shoot-out. Arnason stared at the
ceiling.
"That charges have been made
against the defendant is no evidence
whatsoever that she is guilty,"
reiterated the judge. The reading had
seemed impressive, but the jury tried
to show agreement with him.
"Everything relating to human affairs
is open to some doubt," he went on.
"What we are concerned with is
'reasonable doubt.' The people must
prove, through the [Assistant]

Attorney General, her guilt beyond all
reasonable doubt" for conviction.
Long List
Harris ran down the list of 104
prospective witnesses that the
prosecution intends to call, including
among them employees of gun shops,
gas stations, Howard Johnson's motels
and Georgia Jackson, mother of
Soledad Brother George Jackson and
Jonathan Jackson, one of those who
died in the August 7 incident.
The jury candidates knew none of
the names read (thereby pasing the
first test of eligibility), and received
another admonition from Arnason
before breaking for lunch. "Ours is a
government of laws, not of men," he
mused. "As jurors, you must take the
law as it is, not as you think it should
be. I am the judge of law — you are
the judges of fact."
Returning from the hour and one
half break proved to be more difficult
than it had been in the morning for
the press, as a reporter's accidental
lean against an emergency exit door
set off buzzers and bells that only
intensified when responding deputies
attempted to locate the villian. After
some difficult run-ins with the metal
detector, a repeat performance of the
courtroom etiquette soliloquy, and the
return of the accused with a new
package of Kleenex, the jury voir dire
began.
Both sides are allowed 20
pre-emptory challenges during the
course of the jury selection, but none
were used yesterday.
Two of the students were excused
quickly because they said the time
involved would cause scholastic and
financial hardships. A secretary for the
Insurance Corporation of America said
she also could not afford to serve and
lose the income from her job. She
agreed, however, to ask her employer if
she could continue to draw salary
while she "performed her civic duty."
A fourth prospective juror claimed
that time would not be a problem. "It
wouldn't interfere with anything
except my bowling," she said.
Publicity in the newspapers did not
affect her view of Davis she claimed.
"My bowling keeps me pretty busy,"
she added. "I only glance through it
[the paper| to see who's bowling or
wrestling." Steadfastly maintaining
that she has never discussed the case
with anyone and has no preconceived
notions about Davis, she concluded,
"She's alright — she's as good as any of
us until she's found guilty."
She was held over for further
questioning today.
Ideological Conflict
Most of the questions directed at
others concerned Davis' image as a
member of the Communist Party. One
woman disqualified herself after
admitting she felt the University of
California Regents were correct in
firing Davis because "it is improper for
Communists to teach in the public
schools."
"I suppose 1 couldn't give her a fair
trial," she concluded.
The final prospective juror of the
afternoon questioned, a middle-aged
employee of IBM, answered defense
attorney Leo Branton's questions for
over an hour, at first admitting that his
distaste for Communists would
preclude him from judging Davis
impartially, then seemingly reversing
himself. "I will judge only on the facts
of this case, not Communist Party
beliefs," he said.
Asked if he believed a Communist
would "lie and cheat, under oath if
necessary, to overthrow the
government of the United Stater.," the
man answered yes. "Anyone who
takes radical action, whether
Communist or not, would tend to lie,"
he remarked. Later he stated, "Just
because a person is a Communist
doesn't mean he is dishonest."
Branton asked for the juror's

disqualification for prejudice, and
Arnason, noting the lateness of the
hour, took the request under
advisement. He will rule on it this
morning.
Leaving the security area, Davis
was, as always, swarmed by newsmen

government of the United Stater.," the
man answered yes. "Anyone who
takes radical action, whether
Communist or not, would tend to lie,"
he remarked. Later he stated, "Just
because a person is a Communist
doesn't mean he is dishonest."
Branton asked for the juror's

disqualification for prejudice, and
Arnason, noting the lateness of the
hour, took the request under
advisement. He will rule on it this
morning.
Leaving the security area, Davis
was, as always, swarmed by newsmen
and TV cameras. Her counsel Howard
Moore Jr., usually the most prominent
of her attorneys, had said nothing all
day. After washing down two aspirin
during the last portion of yesterday's
proceedings, and quietly leaving the
courtroom, he too was caught by
reporters.
"We said all along that she couldn't
get a fair trial in this county by a jury
of her peers," he sighed. "If this jury
panel is indicative of what's to come,
I'd sav we were correct."
The Angela Davis trial began
yesterday. From the looks of things, it
may never end.
In a quiet, slow-moving opening to
what may prove to be the longest trial
in state history, Judge Richard E.
Arnason presided over the beginning
of the jury selection process. By
adjournment of the afternoon session,
seven prospective jurors had been
questioned about their availability to
serve in the trial (expected to last close
to six months), and their prejudices
caused by pre-trial publicity accorded
Davis. Three people were excused, and
four were held temporarily for more
questioning, but none chosen.
Davis faces murder-kidnap
conspiracy charges stemming from her
alleged connection with the August 7,
1970, Marin Civic Center shoot-out in
which four persons died.
The day started early for the press,
spectators, and Santa Clara Sheriff's
Deputies who wandered about on
different sides of the numerous
newly-installed security fences at the
San Jose Civic Center complex. In the
basement press headquarters,
broadcasting networks and large
metropolitan newspapers picked up
guaranteed seat assignments, while
smaller publications and most radio
personnel struggled to gain a place
inside the main courtroom.
Both press and spectators were
shuffled through check points, marked
off lists, frisked head to toe, and
metallically detected with the latest
electronic equipment. Passing all tests,
70 people entered the surprisingly
small Criminal Courtroom Number 1,
finding it free of bullet-proof glass,
heavily armed guards, and any of the
trial's participants.
After a reading by a deputy
outlining proper decorum in the
courtroom, prosecutors Albert Harris,
state assistant attorney general, and
Clifford Thompson, deputy attorney
general, entered the chambers
solemnly. Moments later, Davis and
her attorneys took their seats with a
similar quiet and restraint. There were
no clenched fists, only smiles by the
defendant aimed at her family sitting
in the audience, and grabs at a small
box of Kleenex to fight a head cold.
'The People' vs. Angela
Case No. 52613, The People of the
State of California vs. Angela Y. Davis
began after some 16 months and 40
minutes of delay, at 10:10 a.m. After
"The People" moved to strike a
paragraph from their indictment

against Davis because, as they later
explained, "We're not going to prove
it" — a motion denied by Arnason —
the long process of choosing a jury
began.
Names of seven women and five
men were selected from a small
wooden drum on the desk of the court
clerk. Half of those picked were under
30 years old, four under 21. All were
white. (It was reported that in the
entire jury pool of 116 persons, only
one was black.)
The first 12 chosen included two
grandmothers, one grandfather, four
college students (one being Brynne
Motiska, a Stanford sophomore), one
secretary, and the daughter of a
recently retired captain in the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Office.
"Our purpose is to select a fair and
impartial jury," said the judge, as the
clerk began to read aloud the Grand
Jury indictment against the black
revolutionary. Jurors listened intently
and studied the striking defendant.
She followed along as he read, popped
a green Lifesaver, and watched her
family while all heard her being
accused of purchasing the guns used in
the shoot-out. Arnason stared at the
ceiling.
"That charges have been made
against the defendant is no evidence
whatsoever that she is guilty,"
reiterated the judge. The reading had
seemed impressive, but the jury tried
to show agreement with him.
"Everything relating to human affairs
is open to some doubt," he went on.
"What we are concerned with is
'reasonable doubt.' The people must
prove, through the [Assistant]

Attorney General, her guilt beyond all
reasonable doubt" for conviction.
Long List
Harris ran down the list of 104
prospective witnesses that the
prosecution intends to call, including
among them employees of gun shops,
gas stations, Howard Johnson's motels
and Georgia Jackson, mother of
Soledad Brother George Jackson and
Jonathan Jackson, one of those who
died in the August 7 incident.
The jury candidates knew none of
the names read (thereby pasing the
first test of eligibility), and received
another admonition from Arnason
before breaking for lunch. "Ours is a
government of laws, not of men," he
mused. "As jurors, you must take the
law as it is, not as you think it should
be. I am the judge of law — you are
the judges of fact."
Returning from the hour and one
half break proved to be more difficult
than it had been in the morning for
the press, as a reporter's accidental
lean against an emergency exit door
set off buzzers and bells that only
intensified when responding deputies
attempted to locate the villian. After
some difficult run-ins with the metal
detector, a repeat performance of the
courtroom etiquette soliloquy, and the
return of the accused with a new
package of Kleenex, the jury voir dire
began.
Both sides are allowed 20
pre-emptory challenges during the
course of the jury selection, but none
were used yesterday.
Two of the students were excused
quickly because they said the time
involved would cause scholastic and
financial hardships. A secretary for the
Insurance Corporation of America said
she also could not afford to serve and
lose the income from her job. She
agreed, however, to ask her employer if
she could continue to draw salary
while she "performed her civic duty."
A fourth prospective juror claimed
that time would not be a problem. "It
wouldn't interfere with anything
except my bowling," she said.
Publicity in the newspapers did not
affect her view of Davis she claimed.
"My bowling keeps me pretty busy,"
she added. "I only glance through it
[the paper| to see who's bowling or
wrestling." Steadfastly maintaining
that she has never discussed the case
with anyone and has no preconceived
notions about Davis, she concluded,
"She's alright — she's as good as any of
us until she's found guilty."
She was held over for further
questioning today.
Ideological Conflict
Most of the questions directed at
others concerned Davis' image as a
member of the Communist Party. One
woman disqualified herself after
admitting she felt the University of
California Regents were correct in
firing Davis because "it is improper for
Communists to teach in the public
schools."
"I suppose 1 couldn't give her a fair
trial," she concluded.
The final prospective juror of the
afternoon questioned, a middle-aged
employee of IBM, answered defense
attorney Leo Branton's questions for
over an hour, at first admitting that his
distaste for Communists would
preclude him from judging Davis
impartially, then seemingly reversing
himself. "I will judge only on the facts
of this case, not Communist Party
beliefs," he said.
Asked if he believed a Communist
would "lie and cheat, under oath if
necessary, to overthrow the
government of the United Stater.," the
man answered yes. "Anyone who
takes radical action, whether
Communist or not, would tend to lie,"
he remarked. Later he stated, "Just

trial," she concluded.
The final prospective juror of the
afternoon questioned, a middle-aged
employee of IBM, answered defense
attorney Leo Branton's questions for
over an hour, at first admitting that his
distaste for Communists would
preclude him from judging Davis
impartially, then seemingly reversing
himself. "I will judge only on the facts
of this case, not Communist Party
beliefs," he said.
Asked if he believed a Communist
would "lie and cheat, under oath if
necessary, to overthrow the
government of the United Stater.," the
man answered yes. "Anyone who
takes radical action, whether
Communist or not, would tend to lie,"
he remarked. Later he stated, "Just
because a person is a Communist
doesn't mean he is dishonest."
Branton asked for the juror's

disqualification for prejudice, and
Arnason, noting the lateness of the
hour, took the request under
advisement. He will rule on it this
morning.
Leaving the security area, Davis
was, as always, swarmed by newsmen
and TV cameras. Her counsel Howard
Moore Jr., usually the most prominent
of her attorneys, had said nothing all
day. After washing down two aspirin
during the last portion of yesterday's
proceedings, and quietly leaving the
courtroom, he too was caught by
reporters.
"We said all along that she couldn't
get a fair trial in this county by a jury
of her peers," he sighed. "If this jury
panel is indicative of what's to come,
I'd sav we were correct."
The Angela Davis trial began
yesterday. From the looks of things, it
may never end.
In a quiet, slow-moving opening to
what may prove to be the longest trial
in state history, Judge Richard E.
Arnason presided over the beginning
of the jury selection process. By
adjournment of the afternoon session,
seven prospective jurors had been
questioned about their availability to
serve in the trial (expected to last close
to six months), and their prejudices
caused by pre-trial publicity accorded
Davis. Three people were excused, and
four were held temporarily for more
questioning, but none chosen.
Davis faces murder-kidnap
conspiracy charges stemming from her
alleged connection with the August 7,
1970, Marin Civic Center shoot-out in
which four persons died.
The day started early for the press,
spectators, and Santa Clara Sheriff's
Deputies who wandered about on
different sides of the numerous
newly-installed security fences at the
San Jose Civic Center complex. In the
basement press headquarters,
broadcasting networks and large
metropolitan newspapers picked up
guaranteed seat assignments, while
smaller publications and most radio
personnel struggled to gain a place
inside the main courtroom.
Both press and spectators were
shuffled through check points, marked
off lists, frisked head to toe, and
metallically detected with the latest
electronic equipment. Passing all tests,
70 people entered the surprisingly
small Criminal Courtroom Number 1,
finding it free of bullet-proof glass,
heavily armed guards, and any of the
trial's participants.
After a reading by a deputy
outlining proper decorum in the
courtroom, prosecutors Albert Harris,
state assistant attorney general, and
Clifford Thompson, deputy attorney
general, entered the chambers
solemnly. Moments later, Davis and
her attorneys took their seats with a
similar quiet and restraint. There were
no clenched fists, only smiles by the
defendant aimed at her family sitting
in the audience, and grabs at a small
box of Kleenex to fight a head cold.
'The People' vs. Angela
Case No. 52613, The People of the
State of California vs. Angela Y. Davis
began after some 16 months and 40
minutes of delay, at 10:10 a.m. After
"The People" moved to strike a
paragraph from their indictment

against Davis because, as they later
explained, "We're not going to prove
it" — a motion denied by Arnason —
the long process of choosing a jury
began.
Names of seven women and five
men were selected from a small
wooden drum on the desk of the court
clerk. Half of those picked were under
30 years old, four under 21. All were
white. (It was reported that in the
entire jury pool of 116 persons, only
one was black.)
The first 12 chosen included two
grandmothers, one grandfather, four
college students (one being Brynne
Motiska, a Stanford sophomore), one
secretary, and the daughter of a
recently retired captain in the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Office.
"Our purpose is to select a fair and
impartial jury," said the judge, as the
clerk began to read aloud the Grand
Jury indictment against the black
revolutionary. Jurors listened intently
and studied the striking defendant.
She followed along as he read, popped
a green Lifesaver, and watched her
family while all heard her being
accused of purchasing the guns used in
the shoot-out. Arnason stared at the
ceiling.
"That charges have been made
against the defendant is no evidence
whatsoever that she is guilty,"
reiterated the judge. The reading had
seemed impressive, but the jury tried
to show agreement with him.
"Everything relating to human affairs
is open to some doubt," he went on.
"What we are concerned with is
'reasonable doubt.' The people must
prove, through the [Assistant]

Attorney General, her guilt beyond all
reasonable doubt" for conviction.
Long List
Harris ran down the list of 104
prospective witnesses that the
prosecution intends to call, including
among them employees of gun shops,
gas stations, Howard Johnson's motels
and Georgia Jackson, mother of
Soledad Brother George Jackson and
Jonathan Jackson, one of those who
died in the August 7 incident.
The jury candidates knew none of
the names read (thereby pasing the
first test of eligibility), and received
another admonition from Arnason
before breaking for lunch. "Ours is a
government of laws, not of men," he
mused. "As jurors, you must take the
law as it is, not as you think it should
be. I am the judge of law — you are
the judges of fact."
Returning from the hour and one
half break proved to be more difficult
than it had been in the morning for
the press, as a reporter's accidental
lean against an emergency exit door
set off buzzers and bells that only
intensified when responding deputies
attempted to locate the villian. After
some difficult run-ins with the metal
detector, a repeat performance of the
courtroom etiquette soliloquy, and the
return of the accused with a new
package of Kleenex, the jury voir dire
began.
Both sides are allowed 20
pre-emptory challenges during the
course of the jury selection, but none
were used yesterday.
Two of the students were excused
quickly because they said the time
involved would cause scholastic and
financial hardships. A secretary for the
Insurance Corporation of America said
she also could not afford to serve and
lose the income from her job. She
agreed, however, to ask her employer if
she could continue to draw salary
while she "performed her civic duty."
A fourth prospective juror claimed
that time would not be a problem. "It
wouldn't interfere with anything
except my bowling," she said.
Publicity in the newspapers did not
affect her view of Davis she claimed.
"My bowling keeps me pretty busy,"
she added. "I only glance through it
[the paper| to see who's bowling or
wrestling." Steadfastly maintaining
that she has never discussed the case
with anyone and has no preconceived
notions about Davis, she concluded,
"She's alright — she's as good as any of
us until she's found guilty."
She was held over for further
questioning today.
Ideological Conflict
Most of the questions directed at
others concerned Davis' image as a
member of the Communist Party. One
woman disqualified herself after
admitting she felt the University of
California Regents were correct in
firing Davis because "it is improper for
Communists to teach in the public
schools."
"I suppose 1 couldn't give her a fair
trial," she concluded.
The final prospective juror of the
afternoon questioned, a middle-aged
employee of IBM, answered defense
attorney Leo Branton's questions for
over an hour, at first admitting that his
distaste for Communists would
preclude him from judging Davis
impartially, then seemingly reversing
himself. "I will judge only on the facts

Asked if he believed a Communist
would "lie and cheat, under oath if
necessary, to overthrow the

man answered yes. "Anyone who
takes radical action, whether
Communist or not, would tend to lie,"
he remarked. Later he stated, "Just
because a person is a Communist
doesn't mean he is dishonest."
Branton asked for the juror's

disqualification for prejudice, and
Arnason, noting the lateness of the
hour, took the request under
advisement. He will rule on it this
morning.
