## Free Ralph Ginzburg! 
### 
Two weeks ago, Ralph Ginzburg went to jail and
began to serve a three-year prison term for
obscenity.
In the wake of the Pentagon Papers controversy,
people in the United States have quite properly
developed a heightened sensitivity to the perils
which freedom of the press still faces. We at the
Stanford Daily have had our own personal
experience with inroads upon the freedom of the
press. <•
Following a police search-of the Daily office last
spring, the Daily filed suit to obtain a court order
forbidding such searches in the future. We did this
because such searches severely inhibit our
news-gathering ability and our freedom to operate.
Just before Ralph Ginzburg turned himself in on
February 17, he took a piece of parchment from
inside his jacket and said:
"This is the Bill of Rights of the United States
Constitution. It says Congress shall make no law
abridging freedom of speech or the press. I am
entering prison under a three-year sentence for
publishing something I believe in. Every day I
remain in prison this Bill of Rights is a meaningless
piece of paper."
He then crumpled the copy of the Bill of Rights
and threw it in a wastebasket.
In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that it
was a punishable crime for Ginzburg to have
emphatically notified potential buyers of magazines

and books which he published that these magazines
and books treated the subject of human sexuality.
This crime the Court called "pandering." As a New
York Times news story on Ginzburg has pointed
out: "The pandering standard had not been applied
before and has not been applied since."
The Supreme Court's action upheld an earlier
Federal District Court conviction of Ginzburg for
violating an 1872 statute by sending obscene
material through the mails.
It would seem that with this case the government
is trying to legislate taste, which presents a direct
threat to freedom of the press, and inhibits the
of people to read what they wish, and of publishers
to publish what they wish.
Aside from our philosophical objections to
Ginzburg's conviction, there is an element of
hypocrisy in the case which rankles us further. What
Ginzburg was convicted of doing ten years ago, is
done with impunity today.
We consider Ginzburg's imprisonment to be
unjust, and we hope no one ever again is victimized
in the way Ginzburg has been.
Furthermore, we consider it a vital necessity that
freedom of the press be observed in practice in the
United States. The Ginzburg and Pentagon Papers
cases, the Nixon administration's warnings to
broadcasters, and the police search of the Daily
office were all instances of government infringement
of the press's rightful domain.

He then crumpled the copy of the Bill of Rights
and threw it in a wastebasket.
In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that it
was a punishable crime for Ginzburg to have
emphatically notified potential buyers of magazines

and books which he published that these magazines
and books treated the subject of human sexuality.
This crime the Court called "pandering." As a New
York Times news story on Ginzburg has pointed
out: "The pandering standard had not been applied
before and has not been applied since."
The Supreme Court's action upheld an earlier
Federal District Court conviction of Ginzburg for
violating an 1872 statute by sending obscene
material through the mails.
It would seem that with this case the government
is trying to legislate taste, which presents a direct
threat to freedom of the press, and inhibits the
of people to read what they wish, and of publishers
to publish what they wish.
Aside from our philosophical objections to
Ginzburg's conviction, there is an element of
hypocrisy in the case which rankles us further. What
Ginzburg was convicted of doing ten years ago, is
done with impunity today.
We consider Ginzburg's imprisonment to be
unjust, and we hope no one ever again is victimized
in the way Ginzburg has been.
Furthermore, we consider it a vital necessity that
freedom of the press be observed in practice in the
United States. The Ginzburg and Pentagon Papers
cases, the Nixon administration's warnings to
broadcasters, and the police search of the Daily
office were all instances of government infringement
of the press's rightful domain.
