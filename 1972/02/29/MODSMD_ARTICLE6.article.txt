## French Follow China Summit 
### 
TOURS, France, Feb. 22 — It must be hard for most Europeans to
believe that President Nixon is, indeed, in the People's Republic of
China.
For once, French newspapers seem to reflect national sentiments:
one paper has called the Nixon expedition the "voyage of the
century" and the "most important summit meeting since World War
II." Not bad for the leaders of two countries that don't even recognize
each other.
Le Monde, in many respects the French equivalent of the New
York Times, devoted the first five pages of today's editions to the
President's trip and the world-wide reactions it is generating.
Frenchmen — stunned, amazed, joyful and even amused, depending
on what's being shown — gather around television sets in shop
windows to look at and listen to the latest videotapes from Peking.
Right now, it seems, the whole world is listening to the
pronouncements of Nixon and Kissinger and Mao and Chou.
And, right now, as Nixon and Mao hold "serious and frank"
discussions in Peking's Great Hall of the People, American bombs
continue to rain over many parts of Indochina.
In his nationally-distributed column, humorist Art Buchwald
penned a few lines of 'poetry' that Nixon "could spring" on Mao
Tse-tung:
"There are no clouds in the sky,
"The wind is but a whisper in the trees,
"Lakes sparkle as birds sing,
"It's a good day to bomb Cambodia. "
The Paris peace talks? Forget them, at least for the time being. At
the insistence of the U.S. and South Vietnamese delegations, they've
been suspended since the meeting of the Paris World Assembly for the

Ed kohn

Peace and Independence of the Indochinese Peoples — an offshoot of
the Stockholm Conference on Vietnam — two weekends ago.
'Extra-Curricular' Talks
Private negotiations? Who knows? Henry Kissinger may make
another of his famous jet-set stops on the way back from Peking — or
he may hold some 'extra-curricular' talks while he's in China. But
that's speculation, pure and simple.
Yet there is hope. Not much, to be sure. But even if President
Nixon "accomplishes" nothing during his week in China, his presence
there will force changes in many currently-held political perceptions.
In the person of Richard M. Nixon, a staunch anti-communist for
more than two and a half decades, we — the United States of America
- have finally admitted that the People's Republic of China exists,
that it, too, has problems, and that it is a force that must be
recognized. And, equally important, the U.S. has acknowledged that it
cannot successfully defy the flow of Asian history at will.
These conclusions contrast sharply with our policies in Southeast
Asia. The President and his advisers apparently cling to the belief that
the U.S. can fight history and impose its views — and governments —
on the Indochinese peoples.
Nixon's policies in Vietnam — "peace plan" or no "peace plan" are
clear: fight a highly-mechanized war and maintain Nguyen Van Thieu
as President of South Vietnam at all costs. The U.S. government
doesn't want to threaten Thieu's security — which is precisely why its
"peace" proposals are consistently rejected.
Moral Grounds
Nixon and his palace guard are trying to force Americans to
support Thieu on "moral" grounds; that's why one White House
official recently came within a millimeter of accusing presidential
candidate Muskie of treason.
But our obligations in Indochina — if indeed there are any valid
ones — should be to the Indochinese peoples, and not to one
particular government. So the real question is this: why should we be
striving so hard to Keep Thieu in office?
Eventually, the United States is going to have to "eat crow": give
in and admit that North Vietnam and the various guerilla forces — and
not the U.S. Army and Air Force — are the controlling factors in
Southeast Asia.
Who remembers why we got into Indochina in the first place? One
government explanation: as part of the "domino theory," we had an
obligation to "contain China" whenever and wherever we could.
The Mao-Nixon talks clearly show that these ideas have been
abandoned. And Nixon's mechanized war does, in fact, take notice of
his "doctrine" that the U.S. can no longer settle the private affairs of
other countries.
Who knows? If we had not so strongly supported Thieu in the
rigged South Vietnamese elections last summer, we might have been
able to get out of Vietnam by now. But he's our man, and we stood
by him; and now we're mired even deeper in the quicksand.
All Or Nothing
Sooner or later, the U.S. will be faced with an all-or-nothing choice
in Indochina: either we will continue to support Thieu or a
Thieu-type regime — and continue killing and wounding Asians and
Americans and fighting history; or we can cut loose from Saigon and
let it sink or swim on its own power — power we've given it — and pull
out of this repulsive war.
President Nixon and the U.S. government have learned that they
cannot control Asian history forever. In his State of the World
message, read with great interest in Europe, he clearly stated that the
reunification of China is a Chinese problem and not an American one.
Perhaps someday he'll come to the same conclusions about the
Indochinese War. There's always hope.
But until then, the bombs will continue to fall, people will
continue to be killed needlessly, and we — the United States — will
continue to do what we can to destroy the whole of Southeast Asia.
