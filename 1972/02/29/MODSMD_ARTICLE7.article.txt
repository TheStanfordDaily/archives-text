## Students Asked To Fund Law Firm 
### 
( Yesterday the purposes of the
formation of a public interest law
firm, Citizens Advocates at
Stanford, Inc., were discussed.
While members of the university
community would have close ties
to the corporation, the University
as an institution will have no
control over or liability for the
actions of the firm. Citizens
Advocates is a non-profit
corporation with no direct legal
association with Stanford.
Today's article deals with the
organization of the corporation
and the proposed method of fee
collection.)
Funding for Citizens Advocates
would come from four major
sources: the University
community, alumni and friends,
the general legal community and
private foundations. It is hoped
that the main contribution will
come from a refundable quarterly
fee levied on Stanford students.
Approval will be sought through a
referendum at the general student
election Spring Quarter. It is
proposed to have a refundable fee,

paid along with tuition and other
fees, of $2.00 fall and spring
quarters, and $1.00 winter and
summer quarters. All persons who
for personal, political or financial
reasons oppose payment would be
able to obtain a refund.
Students will be asked to
approve this procedure by a
two-thirds vote for a minimum
three year period, instead of the
normal one year period, because
of the absolute necessity of
ensuring some minimal financial
base prior to the commencement
of activity. Any major litigation
undertaken by the firm is likely to
require a minimum of three years
to complete. Moreover, some
financial security must be given in
order to attract high quality staff
who would, in any case, be
accepting salaries substantially
below those paid by private law
firms and most government
agencies. Most importantly, the
three year minimum time period
will be necessary to demonstrate
commitment and sincerity on the
part of the university community

necessary to attract the additional
financing from outside sources.
Refundable Fee
We feel that the assessment
should not be mandatory but
rather provide a mechanism by
which those students who do not
wish to contribute can claim a
refund of their money. The
following is the outline we
propose to assure refunds to those
students desiring them, while at
the same time reducing
administrative complications and
expenses to a minimum:
1. Students would be notified
in advance of this optional fee as
well as compulsory ones, by letter
sent with registration materials
each quarter.
2. On registration days each
quarter, sufficient personnel
would be on hand to accept
refund claims. (Students at
foreign campuses would have
thirty days subsequent to
registration to request a refund.)
3. Refund checks would be
mailed directly to the students so
requesting.
It should be noted that
although students are being asked
to commit a substantial sum of
money, this would account for
only slightly more than half of the
proposed minimum annual
working budget. Additional
support will be required, and will
be sought from the other sources

described before. Plans call for the
firm to be self-supporting in three
years, however, by means of
attorney's fees obtained from
consumer and other class action
litigation, contingent upon
Internal Revenue Service
approval.
Non-Profit Corporation
Citizens Advocates is
established as a non-profit
corporation and tax-exempt status
is being applied for. As such the
use of its funds will be subject to
review by the IRS and the
California Attorney General.
Annual reports on the operations
of the firm will be made available
in accordance with the provisions
of the corporate charter and state
law.
All students who contribute
the quarterly fee will be Associate
Members of the corporation. As
such they will have the right to
attend meetings of the Board of
Directors, to attend the annual
membership meeting of the
corporation and to submit
resolutions to the Board. In
addition, all students will have the
right to select student members of
the Board in annual elections each
Spring.
Students will comprise a
majority of the eleven-member
Board of Directors: four elected
by the student body as a whole,
two law students chosen by the
law school student body. Only
Associate Members will be eligible
to serve on the Board, although all
students will be eligible to vote.
The remaining five members of
the Board will be selected by the
preceding year's Board: one law
school faculty member, one
general university faculty
member, and three representatives
active in community
organizations, two of them being
attorneys.
The Firm
Citizens Advocates at Stanford,
Inc. will be staffed by two
attorneys and one or two staff
assistants and secretaries. The
staff will be supplemented by
volunteer law students as well as
undergraduates and graduates

; citizen advocates, inc.

from other disciplines who could
provide extensive and expert
research and investigation
assistance. Much of this effort
might be channelled through
courses offered by the various
departments as well as SWOPSI
and SCIRE courses and
extra-curricular activities.
Some of the most successful
efforts on behalf of the public
interest have come from
organizations which derive their
support from the broad-based,
concerned and active constituency
of a university. Thorough
investigation of current problems
by students, faculty and
researchers from many disciplines
working in classes and on their
own time can make Citizens
Advocates an effective instrument
for social change.

( Yesterday the purposes of the
formation of a public interest law
firm, Citizens Advocates at
Stanford, Inc., were discussed.
While members of the university
community would have close ties
to the corporation, the University
as an institution will have no
control over or liability for the
actions of the firm. Citizens
Advocates is a non-profit
corporation with no direct legal
association with Stanford.
Today's article deals with the
organization of the corporation
and the proposed method of fee
collection.)
Funding for Citizens Advocates
would come from four major
sources: the University
community, alumni and friends,
the general legal community and
private foundations. It is hoped
that the main contribution will
come from a refundable quarterly
fee levied on Stanford students.
Approval will be sought through a
referendum at the general student
election Spring Quarter. It is
proposed to have a refundable fee,

paid along with tuition and other
fees, of $2.00 fall and spring
quarters, and $1.00 winter and
summer quarters. All persons who
for personal, political or financial
reasons oppose payment would be
able to obtain a refund.
Students will be asked to
approve this procedure by a
two-thirds vote for a minimum
three year period, instead of the
normal one year period, because
of the absolute necessity of
ensuring some minimal financial
base prior to the commencement
of activity. Any major litigation
undertaken by the firm is likely to
require a minimum of three years
to complete. Moreover, some
financial security must be given in
order to attract high quality staff
who would, in any case, be
accepting salaries substantially
below those paid by private law
firms and most government
agencies. Most importantly, the
three year minimum time period
will be necessary to demonstrate
commitment and sincerity on the
part of the university community

necessary to attract the additional
financing from outside sources.
Refundable Fee
We feel that the assessment
should not be mandatory but
rather provide a mechanism by
which those students who do not
wish to contribute can claim a
refund of their money. The
following is the outline we
propose to assure refunds to those
students desiring them, while at
the same time reducing
administrative complications and
expenses to a minimum:
1. Students would be notified
in advance of this optional fee as
well as compulsory ones, by letter
sent with registration materials
each quarter.
2. On registration days each
quarter, sufficient personnel
would be on hand to accept
refund claims. (Students at
foreign campuses would have
thirty days subsequent to
registration to request a refund.)
3. Refund checks would be
mailed directly to the students so
requesting.
It should be noted that
although students are being asked
to commit a substantial sum of
money, this would account for
only slightly more than half of the
proposed minimum annual
working budget. Additional
support will be required, and will
be sought from the other sources

described before. Plans call for the
firm to be self-supporting in three
years, however, by means of
attorney's fees obtained from
consumer and other class action
litigation, contingent upon
Internal Revenue Service
approval.
Non-Profit Corporation
Citizens Advocates is
established as a non-profit
corporation and tax-exempt status
is being applied for. As such the
use of its funds will be subject to
review by the IRS and the
California Attorney General.
Annual reports on the operations
of the firm will be made available
in accordance with the provisions
of the corporate charter and state
law.
All students who contribute
the quarterly fee will be Associate
Members of the corporation. As
such they will have the right to
attend meetings of the Board of
Directors, to attend the annual
membership meeting of the
corporation and to submit
resolutions to the Board. In
addition, all students will have the
right to select student members of
the Board in annual elections each
Spring.
Students will comprise a
majority of the eleven-member
Board of Directors: four elected
by the student body as a whole,
two law students chosen by the
law school student body. Only
Associate Members will be eligible
to serve on the Board, although all
students will be eligible to vote.
The remaining five members of
the Board will be selected by the
preceding year's Board: one law
school faculty member, one
general university faculty
member, and three representatives
active in community
organizations, two of them being
attorneys.
The Firm
Citizens Advocates at Stanford,
Inc. will be staffed by two
attorneys and one or two staff
assistants and secretaries. The
staff will be supplemented by
volunteer law students as well as
undergraduates and graduates

; citizen advocates, inc.

from other disciplines who could
provide extensive and expert
research and investigation
assistance. Much of this effort
might be channelled through
courses offered by the various
departments as well as SWOPSI
and SCIRE courses and
extra-curricular activities.
Some of the most successful
efforts on behalf of the public
interest have come from
organizations which derive their
support from the broad-based,
concerned and active constituency
of a university. Thorough
investigation of current problems
by students, faculty and
researchers from many disciplines
working in classes and on their
own time can make Citizens
Advocates an effective instrument
for social change.

( Yesterday the purposes of the
formation of a public interest law
firm, Citizens Advocates at
Stanford, Inc., were discussed.
While members of the university
community would have close ties
to the corporation, the University
as an institution will have no
control over or liability for the
actions of the firm. Citizens
Advocates is a non-profit
corporation with no direct legal
association with Stanford.
Today's article deals with the
organization of the corporation
and the proposed method of fee
collection.)
Funding for Citizens Advocates
would come from four major
sources: the University
community, alumni and friends,
the general legal community and
private foundations. It is hoped
that the main contribution will
come from a refundable quarterly
fee levied on Stanford students.
Approval will be sought through a
referendum at the general student
election Spring Quarter. It is
proposed to have a refundable fee,

paid along with tuition and other
fees, of $2.00 fall and spring
quarters, and $1.00 winter and
summer quarters. All persons who
for personal, political or financial
reasons oppose payment would be
able to obtain a refund.
Students will be asked to
approve this procedure by a
two-thirds vote for a minimum
three year period, instead of the
normal one year period, because
of the absolute necessity of
ensuring some minimal financial
base prior to the commencement
of activity. Any major litigation
undertaken by the firm is likely to
require a minimum of three years
to complete. Moreover, some
financial security must be given in
order to attract high quality staff
who would, in any case, be
accepting salaries substantially
below those paid by private law
firms and most government
agencies. Most importantly, the
three year minimum time period
will be necessary to demonstrate
commitment and sincerity on the
part of the university community

necessary to attract the additional
financing from outside sources.
Refundable Fee
We feel that the assessment
should not be mandatory but
rather provide a mechanism by
which those students who do not
wish to contribute can claim a
refund of their money. The
following is the outline we
propose to assure refunds to those
students desiring them, while at
the same time reducing
administrative complications and
expenses to a minimum:
1. Students would be notified
in advance of this optional fee as
well as compulsory ones, by letter
sent with registration materials
each quarter.
2. On registration days each
quarter, sufficient personnel
would be on hand to accept
refund claims. (Students at
foreign campuses would have
thirty days subsequent to
registration to request a refund.)
3. Refund checks would be
mailed directly to the students so
requesting.
It should be noted that
although students are being asked
to commit a substantial sum of
money, this would account for
only slightly more than half of the
proposed minimum annual
working budget. Additional
support will be required, and will
be sought from the other sources

described before. Plans call for the
firm to be self-supporting in three
years, however, by means of
attorney's fees obtained from
consumer and other class action
litigation, contingent upon
Internal Revenue Service
approval.
Non-Profit Corporation
Citizens Advocates is
established as a non-profit
corporation and tax-exempt status
is being applied for. As such the
use of its funds will be subject to
review by the IRS and the
California Attorney General.
Annual reports on the operations
of the firm will be made available
in accordance with the provisions
of the corporate charter and state
law.
All students who contribute
the quarterly fee will be Associate
Members of the corporation. As
such they will have the right to
attend meetings of the Board of
Directors, to attend the annual
membership meeting of the
corporation and to submit
resolutions to the Board. In
addition, all students will have the
right to select student members of
the Board in annual elections each
Spring.
Students will comprise a
majority of the eleven-member
Board of Directors: four elected
by the student body as a whole,
two law students chosen by the
law school student body. Only
Associate Members will be eligible
to serve on the Board, although all
students will be eligible to vote.
The remaining five members of
the Board will be selected by the
preceding year's Board: one law
school faculty member, one
general university faculty
member, and three representatives
active in community
organizations, two of them being
attorneys.
The Firm
Citizens Advocates at Stanford,
Inc. will be staffed by two
attorneys and one or two staff
assistants and secretaries. The
staff will be supplemented by
volunteer law students as well as
undergraduates and graduates

; citizen advocates, inc.

from other disciplines who could
provide extensive and expert
research and investigation
assistance. Much of this effort
might be channelled through
courses offered by the various
departments as well as SWOPSI
and SCIRE courses and
extra-curricular activities.
Some of the most successful
efforts on behalf of the public
interest have come from
organizations which derive their
support from the broad-based,
concerned and active constituency
of a university. Thorough
investigation of current problems
by students, faculty and
researchers from many disciplines
working in classes and on their
own time can make Citizens
Advocates an effective instrument
for social change.
