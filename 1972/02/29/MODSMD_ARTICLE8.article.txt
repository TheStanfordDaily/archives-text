# And Some Letters

Editor, THF DAILY
I received the following letter
from Menlo Park (under a
psuedonym) in response to a
column I wrote in the Feb. 14
Daily. I thought it might be of
interest to members of the
Stanford Community who feel
there is no need to respond to Dr.
Shockley because no one supports
his views:
"When will you realize that
black is black is black no matter
what methods they use, they are
neither equal, nor up to being
students at Stanford — Go back to
Africa and yes, do not hinder
people who qualify to enter the
university."

Papandreou
Editor, THE DAILY:
Andreas Papandreou, the Daily
reports, told a recent SWOPSI
symposium that the Greek
mountains are bare because U.S.

napalm bombs were first tested
there during the communist
uprising in 1947-49. This is a lie.
I was born in Greece in 1929. I
can say that Greece has been bare
of vegetation as far as I can
remember, largely because of
goats and poor ecological
practices.
In 1949, I served in the Royal
Hellenic Air Force, and I can say
emphatically that no napalm was
ever used on Greek soil.
By contrast, where was
Papandreou when many young
Greek men were being killed
fighting for their country? He was
abroad, a son of privilege.
Through his father's political
connections, Andreas along with
the sons of many Greek
politicians and rich shipowners,
were conveniently allowed to
leave the country to escape
military service.
In his speech, Papandreou
compared the Greek guerrilla war
with Vietnam. He is wrong.

Unlike South Vietnam, the
elected Greek government in 1946
had overwhelming popular
support. In the elections,
conducted under United Nations
supervision, the Greek
communists got less than 12
percent of the vote. Another
major difference is that not a
single American soldier ever
fought in Greece. The defeat of
the communists clearly reflected
the desire of the Greek people to
remain free.
Papandreou blames the
takeover by the present Greek
military junta on the CIA.
Actually, many Greeks believe it
was he and his policies that led to
the chaotic years in the mid
1960's and paved the way for the
unfortunate military coup.
A characteristic of Papandreou,
the archhypocrite, and his
followers is to blame their
mistakes on others — mainly the
United States. He is peddling his
stuff to the hate-America types,
who are eagerly mainlining it,
advertising it without question.
I hope the SWOPSI symposium
participants will recognize the
other side of Papandreou which is
not as well known to the
American public.

of vegetation as far as I can
remember, largely because of
goats and poor ecological
practices.
In 1949, I served in the Royal
Hellenic Air Force, and I can say
emphatically that no napalm was
ever used on Greek soil.
By contrast, where was
Papandreou when many young
Greek men were being killed
fighting for their country? He was
abroad, a son of privilege.
Through his father's political
connections, Andreas along with
the sons of many Greek
politicians and rich shipowners,
were conveniently allowed to
leave the country to escape
military service.
In his speech, Papandreou
compared the Greek guerrilla war
with Vietnam. He is wrong.

Unlike South Vietnam, the
elected Greek government in 1946
had overwhelming popular
support. In the elections,
conducted under United Nations
supervision, the Greek
communists got less than 12
percent of the vote. Another
major difference is that not a
single American soldier ever
fought in Greece. The defeat of
the communists clearly reflected
the desire of the Greek people to
remain free.
Papandreou blames the
takeover by the present Greek
military junta on the CIA.
Actually, many Greeks believe it
was he and his policies that led to
the chaotic years in the mid
1960's and paved the way for the
unfortunate military coup.
A characteristic of Papandreou,
the archhypocrite, and his
followers is to blame their
mistakes on others — mainly the
United States. He is peddling his
stuff to the hate-America types,
who are eagerly mainlining it,
advertising it without question.
I hope the SWOPSI symposium
participants will recognize the
other side of Papandreou which is
not as well known to the
American public.

I received the following letter
from Menlo Park (under a
psuedonym) in response to a
column I wrote in the Feb. 14
Daily. I thought it might be of
interest to members of the
Stanford Community who feel
there is no need to respond to Dr.
Shockley because no one supports
his views:
"When will you realize that
black is black is black no matter
what methods they use, they are
neither equal, nor up to being
students at Stanford — Go back to
Africa and yes, do not hinder
people who qualify to enter the
university."

Editor, THE DAILY:
Andreas Papandreou, the Daily
reports, told a recent SWOPSI
symposium that the Greek
mountains are bare because U.S.

napalm bombs were first tested
there during the communist
uprising in 1947-49. This is a lie.
I was born in Greece in 1929. I
can say that Greece has been bare
of vegetation as far as I can
remember, largely because of
goats and poor ecological
practices.
