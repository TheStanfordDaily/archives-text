## Unions Urged To Clarify Positions 
### 
With only a week remaining in
the campaign to determine a
bargaining agent for 1600
Stanford workers, what are the
prospects for a clear union
victory? What are workers looking
for in a union? And what do they
see in the given alternatives?
After the sparse turnout for
the meeting of the CSEA two
weeks ago, the relatively strong
attendance at the meetings for the
Teamsters and USE made it clear
that workers see these two
organizations as the main
contenders. Yet each meeting
attracted different strata of
workers.
Workers from Plant Services,
Food Services and SLAC
predominated at the Teamsters
meeting, with Black and Brown
workers represented but only a
few women present. Rudy Tham,
Teamster executive secretary,
explained the need for a union
and outlined the Teamster
program. "Stanford claims to be a
non-profit institution," he said,
"but it really isn't. They make the
money and you get the crumbs."
As the elected bargaining agent,
he claimed, "we promise you
money, and that's really what it's
all about. You'll get better wages,
with maintenance of standards,
health, dental and pension plans
paid completely by Stanford,
you'll get grievances resolved
fairly. If you want a social club or
political club, go somewhere
else."
Besides an impressive list of
benefits and wage increases "over
and above any increases you
received while this election was
pending," a union-shop Teamster
contract would include job
descriptions, work rules, shift
differentials and joD bidding
procedures.
At the USE meeting the
following evening, workers mainly
from the medical center, SLAC,
Mail and Food Services showed
up. USE's program presently
provides for an open shop
(voluntary union membership),
revamped job classifications, a
reduced work week, and an
increase in the minimum wage to
$502 per month. In addition, USE
proposes comprehensive medical,
dental and retirement plans, new
grievance procedures, a policy of
no lay-offs, educational
opportunities and child care
facilities for Stanford workers,
and the "elimination of historical
restrictions based on race and/or
sex."
Concern
From talking to workers in the
bargaining unit in different areas
around campus, and from hearing
the discussion and questions asked
at the three union meetings that
have taken place, it's easy to see
that most workers in the unit are
starting out with a concern —
naturally — for basic,
bread-and-butter issues. They
want higher wages, job security,
medical and dental benefits for
themselves and their families, a
better retirement plan. They see
that a union means shop stewards
and a better grievance procedure,
a more equitable job classification
system, and an end to unpaid
overtime.

But their concern is not limited
just to wages, hours and working
conditions. Everybody sees that
Stanford has vast resources which
could provide job training and
educational opportunities for
workers — though some shy away
from this as a "political" issue.
Facilities for low-cost child care
for women who work at Stanford
is another such "political" issue —
although for the many women
who need it, it is very much a
matter of economic survival.
Looking at the unions
themselves, workers take similarly
distinct points of view, according
to their economic situation.
Workers who need to secure basic
bread-and-butter demands know
that, when you're fighting a
corporation as big as Stanford
University, two things are
necessary to win: money and
muscle. To them, this means the
Teamsters.
For more skilled technical and
craft workers, however, and many
women, money implies corruption
and muscle means bureaucratic
power. They realize that with a
bureaucratic union their more
"political" demands would not be
listened to and their "craft" status
would have little influence. They
say that workers at Stanford
would be dominated by an
outside union, that a union shop
rule, for example, that required
workers to join the union after a
trial period would allow the union
to control all the workers in the
unit. Their solution is to make the
union membership voluntary.
They say that workers could avoid
having a bureaucratic, do-nothing
union just by not joining it. And
they assert that if and when
problems and grievances did come
up that had to be resolved, people
would just naturally join together
to do this. This seems to be the
position of many pro-USE
workers.
Workers taking this point of
view usually assume the relative
weakness of workers in the
bargaining unit, as if all the
muscle came from the outside
affiliated local or from the top
officials down. They fail to see
that workers in the bargaining
unit control the most essential
trades and services at Stanford,
and that local autonomy within
the union has to be won through
strength and unity just as much as
any union contract with Stanford.

It is a mistake to think that
making union membership
voluntary will make the union
itself democratic. Most workers
know that anybody in the unit
who is not with us can be used
against us. So why should some
workers believe that they can get
the benefits of a union contract
without participating in the
defeats, as well as the victories, of
the union struggle? Any changes
that have to be made, whether at
Stanford, or in union governance,
will have to be made by workers
acting together.
On the other hand, workers
would be making the opposite
mistake to think that by voting
Teamsters, we can sit back and
have all our fighting done for us,
that things will get taken care of
as long as we pay our dues. The
bargaining unit is just barely the
size where it can stand on its own
feet. Workers in the unit, once
organized, will have to lead the
fight to organize all the workers at
Stanford, just as they will have to
struggle within the Teamsters to
insure democratic control and
local autonomy.
Potential
To sum up, a Stan ford-based
union like USE clearly has the
best potential for being highly
democratic and sensitive to the
needs of its members beyond
merely wages, hours, and working

venceremos

conditions. This is its strength. A
union limited to Stanford, is,
however, also a weakness. USE
will need great strength and unity
just to secure basic
bread-and-butter demands, let
alone more "political" ones.
Voluntary membership and
semi-professional leadership
cannot do this. USE can only
avoid being a sell-out or racist
union if its leadership represents
the most oppressed workers at
Stanford — namely Black and
Brown workers.
An international union like the
Teamsters, on the other hand,
must realize that a strong
bargaining position does not just
come from professional leadership
and huge bank accounts, but also
from a united and autonomous
local, that is, democratic control.
"Political" demands for
educational opportunities, child
care facilities, and low-cost
housing cannot always be bought
off with better wages and fringe
benefits. And while the Teamsters
may be satisfied with only
organizing the most essential
services at Stanford, the remaining
unorganized 5,000 workers at
Stanford will not be.
We call upon both USE and the
Teamsters to clarify your
positions publicly.

opportunities and child care
facilities for Stanford workers,
and the "elimination of historical
restrictions based on race and/or
sex."
Concern
From talking to workers in the
bargaining unit in different areas
around campus, and from hearing
the discussion and questions asked
at the three union meetings that
have taken place, it's easy to see
that most workers in the unit are
starting out with a concern —
naturally — for basic,
bread-and-butter issues. They
want higher wages, job security,
medical and dental benefits for
themselves and their families, a
better retirement plan. They see
that a union means shop stewards
and a better grievance procedure,
a more equitable job classification
system, and an end to unpaid
overtime.

But their concern is not limited
just to wages, hours and working
conditions. Everybody sees that
Stanford has vast resources which
could provide job training and
educational opportunities for
workers — though some shy away
from this as a "political" issue.
Facilities for low-cost child care
for women who work at Stanford
is another such "political" issue —
although for the many women
who need it, it is very much a
matter of economic survival.
Looking at the unions
themselves, workers take similarly
distinct points of view, according
to their economic situation.
Workers who need to secure basic
bread-and-butter demands know
that, when you're fighting a
corporation as big as Stanford
University, two things are
necessary to win: money and
muscle. To them, this means the
Teamsters.
For more skilled technical and
craft workers, however, and many
women, money implies corruption
and muscle means bureaucratic
power. They realize that with a
bureaucratic union their more
"political" demands would not be
listened to and their "craft" status
would have little influence. They
say that workers at Stanford
would be dominated by an
outside union, that a union shop
rule, for example, that required
workers to join the union after a
trial period would allow the union
to control all the workers in the
unit. Their solution is to make the
union membership voluntary.
They say that workers could avoid
having a bureaucratic, do-nothing
union just by not joining it. And
they assert that if and when
problems and grievances did come
up that had to be resolved, people
would just naturally join together
to do this. This seems to be the
position of many pro-USE
workers.
Workers taking this point of
view usually assume the relative
weakness of workers in the
bargaining unit, as if all the
muscle came from the outside
affiliated local or from the top
officials down. They fail to see
that workers in the bargaining
unit control the most essential
trades and services at Stanford,
and that local autonomy within
the union has to be won through
strength and unity just as much as
any union contract with Stanford.

It is a mistake to think that
making union membership
voluntary will make the union
itself democratic. Most workers
know that anybody in the unit
who is not with us can be used
against us. So why should some
workers believe that they can get
the benefits of a union contract
without participating in the
defeats, as well as the victories, of
the union struggle? Any changes
that have to be made, whether at
Stanford, or in union governance,
will have to be made by workers
acting together.
On the other hand, workers
would be making the opposite
mistake to think that by voting
Teamsters, we can sit back and
have all our fighting done for us,
that things will get taken care of
as long as we pay our dues. The
bargaining unit is just barely the
size where it can stand on its own
feet. Workers in the unit, once
organized, will have to lead the
fight to organize all the workers at
Stanford, just as they will have to
struggle within the Teamsters to
insure democratic control and
local autonomy.
Potential
To sum up, a Stan ford-based
union like USE clearly has the
best potential for being highly
democratic and sensitive to the
needs of its members beyond
merely wages, hours, and working

venceremos

conditions. This is its strength. A
union limited to Stanford, is,
however, also a weakness. USE
will need great strength and unity
just to secure basic
bread-and-butter demands, let
alone more "political" ones.
Voluntary membership and
semi-professional leadership
cannot do this. USE can only
avoid being a sell-out or racist
union if its leadership represents
the most oppressed workers at
Stanford — namely Black and
Brown workers.
An international union like the
Teamsters, on the other hand,
must realize that a strong
bargaining position does not just
come from professional leadership
and huge bank accounts, but also
from a united and autonomous
local, that is, democratic control.
"Political" demands for
educational opportunities, child
care facilities, and low-cost
housing cannot always be bought
off with better wages and fringe
benefits. And while the Teamsters
may be satisfied with only
organizing the most essential
services at Stanford, the remaining
unorganized 5,000 workers at
Stanford will not be.
We call upon both USE and the
Teamsters to clarify your
positions publicly.

I'm Richard Nixon . . . I'm running for re-election ... I'm Richard Nixon
With only a week remaining in
the campaign to determine a
bargaining agent for 1600
Stanford workers, what are the
prospects for a clear union
victory? What are workers looking
for in a union? And what do they
see in the given alternatives?
After the sparse turnout for
the meeting of the CSEA two
weeks ago, the relatively strong
attendance at the meetings for the
Teamsters and USE made it clear
that workers see these two
organizations as the main
contenders. Yet each meeting
attracted different strata of
workers.
Workers from Plant Services,
Food Services and SLAC
predominated at the Teamsters
meeting, with Black and Brown
workers represented but only a
few women present. Rudy Tham,
Teamster executive secretary,
explained the need for a union
and outlined the Teamster
program. "Stanford claims to be a
non-profit institution," he said,
"but it really isn't. They make the
money and you get the crumbs."
As the elected bargaining agent,
he claimed, "we promise you
money, and that's really what it's
all about. You'll get better wages,
with maintenance of standards,
health, dental and pension plans
paid completely by Stanford,
you'll get grievances resolved
fairly. If you want a social club or
political club, go somewhere
else."
Besides an impressive list of
benefits and wage increases "over
and above any increases you
received while this election was
pending," a union-shop Teamster
contract would include job
descriptions, work rules, shift
differentials and joD bidding
procedures.
At the USE meeting the
following evening, workers mainly
from the medical center, SLAC,
Mail and Food Services showed
up. USE's program presently
provides for an open shop
(voluntary union membership),
revamped job classifications, a
reduced work week, and an
increase in the minimum wage to
$502 per month. In addition, USE
proposes comprehensive medical,
dental and retirement plans, new
grievance procedures, a policy of
no lay-offs, educational
opportunities and child care
facilities for Stanford workers,
and the "elimination of historical
restrictions based on race and/or
sex."

unit. Their solution is to make the
union membership voluntary.
They say that workers could avoid
having a bureaucratic, do-nothing
union just by not joining it. And
they assert that if and when
problems and grievances did come
up that had to be resolved, people
would just naturally join together
to do this. This seems to be the
position of many pro-USE
workers.
Workers taking this point of
view usually assume the relative
weakness of workers in the
bargaining unit, as if all the
muscle came from the outside
affiliated local or from the top
officials down. They fail to see
that workers in the bargaining
unit control the most essential
trades and services at Stanford,
and that local autonomy within
the union has to be won through
strength and unity just as much as
any union contract with Stanford.

It is a mistake to think that
making union membership
voluntary will make the union
itself democratic. Most workers
know that anybody in the unit
who is not with us can be used
against us. So why should some
workers believe that they can get
the benefits of a union contract
without participating in the
defeats, as well as the victories, of
the union struggle? Any changes
that have to be made, whether at
Stanford, or in union governance,
will have to be made by workers
acting together.
On the other hand, workers
would be making the opposite
mistake to think that by voting
Teamsters, we can sit back and
have all our fighting done for us,
that things will get taken care of
as long as we pay our dues. The
bargaining unit is just barely the
size where it can stand on its own
feet. Workers in the unit, once
organized, will have to lead the
fight to organize all the workers at
Stanford, just as they will have to
struggle within the Teamsters to
insure democratic control and
local autonomy.
Potential
To sum up, a Stan ford-based
union like USE clearly has the
best potential for being highly
democratic and sensitive to the
needs of its members beyond
merely wages, hours, and working

venceremos

conditions. This is its strength. A
union limited to Stanford, is,
however, also a weakness. USE
will need great strength and unity
just to secure basic
bread-and-butter demands, let
alone more "political" ones.
Voluntary membership and
semi-professional leadership
cannot do this. USE can only
avoid being a sell-out or racist
union if its leadership represents
the most oppressed workers at
Stanford — namely Black and
Brown workers.
An international union like the
Teamsters, on the other hand,
must realize that a strong
bargaining position does not just
come from professional leadership
and huge bank accounts, but also
from a united and autonomous
local, that is, democratic control.
"Political" demands for
educational opportunities, child
care facilities, and low-cost
housing cannot always be bought
off with better wages and fringe
benefits. And while the Teamsters
may be satisfied with only
organizing the most essential
services at Stanford, the remaining
unorganized 5,000 workers at
Stanford will not be.
We call upon both USE and the
Teamsters to clarify your
positions publicly.

I'm Richard Nixon . . . I'm running for re-election ... I'm Richard Nixon
With only a week remaining in
the campaign to determine a
bargaining agent for 1600
Stanford workers, what are the
prospects for a clear union
victory? What are workers looking
for in a union? And what do they
see in the given alternatives?
After the sparse turnout for
the meeting of the CSEA two
weeks ago, the relatively strong
attendance at the meetings for the
Teamsters and USE made it clear
that workers see these two
organizations as the main
contenders. Yet each meeting
attracted different strata of
workers.
Workers from Plant Services,
Food Services and SLAC
predominated at the Teamsters
meeting, with Black and Brown
workers represented but only a
few women present. Rudy Tham,
Teamster executive secretary,
explained the need for a union
and outlined the Teamster
program. "Stanford claims to be a
non-profit institution," he said,
"but it really isn't. They make the
money and you get the crumbs."
As the elected bargaining agent,
he claimed, "we promise you
money, and that's really what it's
all about. You'll get better wages,
with maintenance of standards,
health, dental and pension plans
paid completely by Stanford,
you'll get grievances resolved
fairly. If you want a social club or
political club, go somewhere
else."
Besides an impressive list of
benefits and wage increases "over
and above any increases you
received while this election was
pending," a union-shop Teamster
contract would include job
descriptions, work rules, shift
differentials and joD bidding
procedures.
At the USE meeting the
following evening, workers mainly
from the medical center, SLAC,
Mail and Food Services showed
up. USE's program presently
provides for an open shop
(voluntary union membership),
revamped job classifications, a
reduced work week, and an
increase in the minimum wage to
$502 per month. In addition, USE
proposes comprehensive medical,
dental and retirement plans, new
grievance procedures, a policy of
no lay-offs, educational
opportunities and child care
facilities for Stanford workers,
and the "elimination of historical
restrictions based on race and/or
sex."
Concern
From talking to workers in the
bargaining unit in different areas
around campus, and from hearing
the discussion and questions asked
at the three union meetings that
have taken place, it's easy to see
that most workers in the unit are
starting out with a concern —
naturally — for basic,
bread-and-butter issues. They
want higher wages, job security,
medical and dental benefits for
themselves and their families, a
better retirement plan. They see
that a union means shop stewards
and a better grievance procedure,
a more equitable job classification
system, and an end to unpaid
overtime.

But their concern is not limited
just to wages, hours and working
conditions. Everybody sees that
Stanford has vast resources which
could provide job training and
educational opportunities for
workers — though some shy away
from this as a "political" issue.
Facilities for low-cost child care
for women who work at Stanford
is another such "political" issue —
although for the many women
who need it, it is very much a
matter of economic survival.
Looking at the unions
themselves, workers take similarly
distinct points of view, according
to their economic situation.
Workers who need to secure basic
bread-and-butter demands know
that, when you're fighting a
corporation as big as Stanford
University, two things are
necessary to win: money and
muscle. To them, this means the
Teamsters.
For more skilled technical and
craft workers, however, and many
women, money implies corruption
and muscle means bureaucratic
power. They realize that with a
bureaucratic union their more
"political" demands would not be
listened to and their "craft" status
would have little influence. They
say that workers at Stanford
would be dominated by an
outside union, that a union shop
rule, for example, that required
workers to join the union after a
trial period would allow the union
to control all the workers in the
unit. Their solution is to make the
union membership voluntary.

conditions. This is its strength. A
union limited to Stanford, is,
however, also a weakness. USE
will need great strength and unity
just to secure basic
bread-and-butter demands, let
alone more "political" ones.
Voluntary membership and
semi-professional leadership
cannot do this. USE can only
avoid being a sell-out or racist
union if its leadership represents
the most oppressed workers at
Stanford — namely Black and
Brown workers.
An international union like the
Teamsters, on the other hand,
must realize that a strong
bargaining position does not just
come from professional leadership
and huge bank accounts, but also
from a united and autonomous
local, that is, democratic control.
"Political" demands for
educational opportunities, child
care facilities, and low-cost
housing cannot always be bought
off with better wages and fringe
benefits. And while the Teamsters
may be satisfied with only
organizing the most essential
services at Stanford, the remaining
unorganized 5,000 workers at
Stanford will not be.
We call upon both USE and the
Teamsters to clarify your
positions publicly.
