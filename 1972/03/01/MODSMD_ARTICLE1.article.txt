# Defense Challenges Authority Of CJP
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Defense counsel for two students
being prosecuted before the Campus
Judicial Panel (CJP) presented motions
before the full panel last night
challenging the jurisdiction of the CJP.
The four-hour hearing was held in
Cubberley Auditorium. The panel will
meet again in private to consider the
motions.
Law students Zack Wasserman and
Wally Hunkeler were technically
representing the two whose cases
before the CJP are private by their
request. CJP Chairman John Kaplan
explained that the motion most
closely resembled what would be a
class action suit in a court of law.
The case for the Administration
was argued by Lois Brest, Legal
Counsel in the General Secretary's
Office. The defense counsel said that
President Lyman, by establishing the
CJP, had "violated the intent and
spirit of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter of 1968 and the letter of the
ASSU Constitution of 1969."
Violation Charged
They also argued the CJP violates
an amendment made by Jane Stanford
to the University Trusts in 1902 which
requires the Trustees "to provide for
just and equitable rules of discipline."
The defense said Lyman's "unilateral"
establishment of the CJP was neither
just nor equitable.
In addition, it was argued by the
defense counsel that the "intent of the
Charter is that any deviation (from
that Charter) be as small as possible"
and that the abolition of the Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC) in behalf of the

CJP was not "as small as possible."
Brest, responding to the defense
motion, said "the CJP has no power to
adjudicate the question whether Dr.
Lyman's action in establishing the
present disciplinary procedures was a
legitimate exercise of Ihe authority of
the President."
(Note: Due to the late hour at
which the CJP hearing concluded, it
was not possible to write a complete
story in time for today's deadline. An
additional story on details of the
hearing will appear in tomorrow's
paper.)
