Tidbits From Trial Costs
Several interesting tidbits fall
out of the Franklin trial expenses
which were nominally detailed in
last Friday's Daily. One is that the
University considered the salary
of a reporter for the University
News Service, reporting the trial
events, to be a direct cost of the
trial. It seems to me that it's
relatively unusual for the costs of
a propagandist to be included in
the costs of judicial proceedings,
at least, in the United States.
I don't object to Stanford
hiring a reporter to present the
University's interpretation of
reality; it serves as a balance for
the equally biased reporting of the
trial, given in the Daily. I do
object, however, to Stanford's
falsely inflating the cost figures
for the trial by including in those
figures, the cost of its publicity
activities.
What's even more interesting,
however, is the average faculty
salary figures which derive from
"unextrapolating" Asst. Provost
Grundmann's estimate of $69,800
costs for faculty time of the seven

Advisory Board members. Board
Chairman Kennedy estimated that
the members spent 80 percent of
October and 70 percent of
November and December on the
case. That's 11/60ths of a year,
implying that the combined
yearly salaries of the seven
professors is about $380,784,00,
or an average salary of about
$54,389.
