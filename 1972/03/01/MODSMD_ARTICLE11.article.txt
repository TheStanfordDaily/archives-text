## A Toast To Free China
### 
We were caught by surprise when on July 16, 1971, Washington
and Peiping simultaneously announced President Nixon's acceptance
of an invitation by Chou En-lai to visit mainland China. We were even
more astonished by a report from the Houston Tribune on Aug. 12,
1971 that Henry Kissinger, with Nixon's full approval, had told Chou
En-lai that the United States would do nothing to prevent Red China
from taking the Republic of China's offshore islands of Quemoy and
Matsu.
Certainly President Chiang Kai-shek now realized that he is
considered expendable by Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger. Once
before, in the years 1944 through 1949, Chiang and his people were
betrayed by our Government. Now they are threatened with an even
more perfidious and drastically final betrayal by this same friend. It
will be an eternal regret and disgrace to us, the American people, if we
allow our most faithful ally, the Republic of China, to be sold out by
our Government.
Geographically, Taiwan, or Formosa, as it is called by western
people, is exactly the size of Massachusetts and Connecticut
combined, with a population of almost sixteen million people. Ever
since those incredibly dark days of the years 1949 and 1950 when the
Government of the Republic of China fled to Taiwan, the people of
the Republic of China, under the strong leadership of President
Chiang, have firmly determined to rebuild their country from the
ruins of civil war. Through the American aid that was initiated when
the Korean War broke out, Chiang and the Free Chinese set out to
show what a free people, under a democratic system, could
accomplish for themselves.
Product
Twenty years ago the gross national product of the Republic of
China was about one billion dollars. Today it is approximately five
billion dollars. There has been a steady, cumulative, compounded
average increase for the last decade of ten percent per year. This is in
spite of the fact that all economic assistance from the United States
was permanently discontinued in 1965.
Not until 1960 did Taiwan become an exporting country of any
significance. But with its extremely hard-working, industrious people,
its total two-way trade had grown to three billion fifty million dollars
in 1970, showing a trade balance in its favor of forty million dollars
and an increase over the preceding year of 735 million dollars.
Although the figures for 1971 are not yet available, the forecast for
that year is four billion dollars and the estimate for 1973 is six billion
dollars.
Exports formerly were made up principally of agricultural
products. Sugar and rice accounted for as much as 78 percent of total
exports in 1952. With the growth of industry, the relative importance
of agricultural exports has waned. Exports of sugar and rice, in 1969
was only about 5 percent of total exports. Today, main exports are
textiles, plywood, paper manufactures, rubber products, chemicals,
petroleum products, basic metals, machinery, transport equipment,
glass, cement, and especially electronics. Exports went to 107
countries and 13 territories in 1969.
Lump Of Sugar
The Lump Of Sugar being held out to entice the American public
to swallow Mr. Nixon's "new" China policy, is the promise of trade to
boom our flagging economy. But this is no more than wishful
thinking. The enormous Communist Empire on the mainland, with its
seven hundred million slaves, had a two-way trade only slightly more
than that of Taiwan in 1970. The per capita foreign trade of Taiwan
in 1970 was $213 per year, compared with $5.60 per year for Red
China.
The progress on the social side of life in Taiwan has also been
very impressive. Take primary and junior high schools education for
example. Primary education is free and compulsory for each child
from the age of six. In the 1950-51 school year, there were only 1,231
primary schools while in 1970-71, there were 2,319 primary schools,
with a total enrollment of 2,445,405 pupils. This was 97.7 percent of
(he population of that age bracket. In 1968, free education was also
extended to junior high schools. The junior high school enrollment
percent of primary graduates was 74.7 in 1969.
We could fill many pages with further examples of the progress
made in other fields by the people of the Republic of China. There are
too manv to be mentioned in this article. In brief, the 16 million free

Chinese people of Taiwan today are striking out with great
determination, tremendous energy and enthusiasm and are continuing
to make great strides in economic progress, technological
development, scientific research, social stability, etc.
Subversion
While their free Chinese brothers are industrious in economic
development, the Chinese Reds have been very active in fomenting
subversion in the United States. As FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover
recently observed: "During the past year ... we have experienced a
definite increase in our Chinese investigations due to the stepped-up
intelligence activities on the part of the Communist Chinese aimed at
procuring highly coveted technical data both overtly and covertly, and
the efforts of Chinese Communists to introduce undercover
intelligence agents into this country."
Director Hoover also spoke of Chinese support of the Black
Panthers, the Progressive Labor Party, and other revolutionary groups.
Mr. Hoover noted that the admission of Red China to the U.N. will
enormously increase its ability to carry on subversive and espionage
activities in our country. But, in accordance with the nationally
syndicated columnist Paul Scott, this makes little difference to
President Nixon. As Scott noted: "Persons in and out of government
who encourage opposition to the President's Red China visit are
viewed by the President as being enemies of peace."
Few Americans are aware that we are still at war with the Red
Chinese in Korea. Can it be that Americans have forgotten that the
Communists are the aggressors in Vietnam and that Red China is a
Chief supplier of our Enemy there?
Let Down
Viewed in the foregoing analysis, we, the American people, simply
cannot afford to let these faithful friends in the Republic of China
down. Their continuing successes reveal the bare truth of the merits of
western democracy and free enterprise. Furthermore, the continued
existence of the Republic of China in the Pacific, is still vital to the
national security of the United States. The long-standing mutual
defense arrangement with the Republic of China is not only for the
security of that country, but strengthens our own position and that of
other friends in that area as well. Now that the seeds of doubt have
been planted among the Asian nations due to President Nixon's
drastic change of attitude toward Communist China, the United States
must, in its own interest, try in every respect to restore the badly
shaken morale of our friend, the Republic of China, and our other
friends in Asia.
