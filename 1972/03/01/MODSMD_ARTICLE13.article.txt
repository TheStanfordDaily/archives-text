department, died yesterday
morning at the age of 95.
Manning, who retired in 194 2,
was born and raised in Oregon and
graduated from Willamette

Stanford and, while working as a
teaching assistant, acquired his

1904.
According to his son Laurence,
professor of electrical enginesring,
Manning possessed a prodigious
memory which enabled him to
recognize his former students
after 40 years had elapsed.

Manning's greatest interest was
teaching mathematics to
undergraduate students.
Manning was ambidextrous and
would write equations on the
chalkboard by starting with the
equal sign and simultaneously
writing in both directions.
Following his retirement,
Manning memorized volumes of
Greek literature and began
learning to play the cello. At 86,
he joined the Sierra Club and
