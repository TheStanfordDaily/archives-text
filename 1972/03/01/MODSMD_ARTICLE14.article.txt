## Panofsky Urges More Funding 
### 
While the U.S. still leads the
world in some aspects of high
energy particle research and has
kept up in the rest, the
government must continue
"vigorous support" of particle
accelerator and storage ring
development to maintain a
front-line position, the director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) told the Joint
Congressional Committee on
Atomic Energy in Washington
yesterday.
"We must recognize that other
parts of the world are now
increasing their investments in
high energy physics at a very
substantial rate," Professor
Wolfgang K.H. Panofsky said,
"and therefore we should be
reconciled to the fact that a
somewhat larger fraction of
significant discoveries will
originate from abroad than was
the case in the past.
"Our numerical share of
research contributions may

decrease to some extent; yet we
should insist that the quality of
our facilities, the proficiency of
our teams of engineers and
supporting technicians, and
therefore the basic opportunities
for new and vital discoveries,
should be as good or better than
what the rest of the world has to
offer.
"It is for this reason that I
recommend, in spite of over-all
fiscal pressures, that research and
development on new accelerator
technology should continue
vigorously and that advanced
facilities be constructed as new
technology conservatively
permits," Panofsky said.
Mediocrity Can't Compete
"A program which exploits
only mediocre facilities, even
though vigorously supported, can
never compete with research
which uses facilities that permit
exploration of new frontiers," he
stated.
The SLAC director testified at
the committee's special
authorization hearing for high
energy physics. The two-mile-long
SLAC accelerator was built and is
operated by Stanford under
contract with the Atomic Energy
Commission which the committee
controls.
Panofsky urged full support of
development for both particle
accelerators and storage rings
"because it is my conviction that
so far we do not know which of
these basic tools of the high

energy physicist will ultimately
become more important in the
long range.
"I believe there is consensus in
this country, in Western Europe,
and in the Soviet Union that
accelerators using the established
proton sychrotron (circular
accelerator) principle and using
conventional magnets . . . should
not be replicated at higher energy
â€” this would be too expensive and
better methods are in view."
Conclusions
He gave three qualifying
conclusions that he believes most
scientists now accept regarding
super-high-energy accelerators: 1)
that any new energy boost for
proton accelerators should be
based on new technology; 2) that
if any further upward step in
proton energy is taken it should
be "very large"; and 3) that any
accelerator intended to make a
very large upward step in energy
should be an international
undertaking.
"The situation in accelerators
shows a fairly well balanced
picture between the U.S. and
Western Europe with leadership in
energy see-sawing between the
continents," he said in summary.
"I am happy to say, however, that
in terms of actual attainment of
truly important and exciting
results in physics there is little
question that most of the results
continue to orginate in the U.S.
"The situation (in storage
rings] is quite different and

reflects the lower state of
development of the basic
technology involved. Currently
under construction are devices in
Germany, France, the USSR, and
the U.S. It is hoped that during
this and coming years the
attainable 'luminosity' (reaction
rate] of storage rings will increase
by something like a factor of
1,000 relative to the past.
"I therefore consider it to be
of crucial importance to the
whole future of storage ring
developments to learn whether or
not the ambitious goals set for the
SPEAR storage rings at SLAC, to
become operational this summer,
can in fact be met.
"Until it has been
demonstrated that unforeseen
difficulties will not prevent
attainment of the high luminosity
close to those projected for
SPEAR, any discussion of the
performance of future storage
rings, be they for electrons or
protons, has to be considered
tentative.
"The high energy physics
program since its inception after
the war has dedicated
approximately one-fourth of its
total resources toward the
creation of new facilities,"
Panofsky concluded.
But the noted Stanford
physicist also indicated there
would come an end to the need
for high energy facilities
development, though it is still not
in sight.
