# Brown, Leland, Moulton Sympathetic To Placement Center Disruptions
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
It has been one year since four
Stanford professors and
administrators peacefully blocked
the entrance to a San Mateo draft
board. It has been two weeks
since the same tactic was tried at
Stanford when 65 demonstrators
barred a Navy recruiter from the
Placement Center.
The four professors and
administrators did not take part in
that demonstration. Some
observers have asked why not and
also have wondered how the four,
as perhaps typical of the "liberal
professor," feel about the
blockade.
Three of the four say they
agree with the Placement Center
action and admit that at some
point they might participate. Only

former Faculty Senate Chairman
and Sociology professor Sanford
Dornbusch did not express
support, saying he did not wish to
comment on the question at this
time.
Professor of Religion Robert
McAffee Brown said, "This was
the kind of thing we did in San
Mateo and I still believe this is a
creative way to bring about
change." Brown emphasized that
an important part of this type of
action is being willing to accept
the penalty for it. Although no
one was arrested at the San Mateo
demonstrations, Brown later
served five days for a similar
action on Good Friday at a draft
board in Berkeley.
'Last Resort'
As for participating himself,

Brown did not rule it out but
characterized this type of action
as a "last resort" to be used when
all other channels had failed.
Brown said he felt he had not
thoroughly exhausted talking to
other administrators and faculty
about resolving the Placement
Center dilemma.
But Brown praised the tactic as
one which was "dramatic" and
"darn well keeps people like me
off-balance and uneasy that
maybe I'm not doing enough."
Associate Dean of Students Bill
Leland said he was "entirely in
support" of the Placement Center
demonstration.
"I feel the main issue there is
people in the community saying
what kind of activities they think
they should have in their

community, and I think that's
something all members of the
community should have a voice in
determining."
People Powerless
Leland feels that many
members of the community are
"virtually powerless in
determining the policies of the
University in areas such as
recruiting" and that the
demonstration is "people taking
over their own lives in a very
honorable and respectful way."
Leland, like Brown, also served
five days last year for the same
Berkeley demonstration.
As for whether Leland himself
would participate, he said he'd
"certainly consider it" but that
the question "was a complex
one.
"I feel I'm trying to act out my
values in a way that is consistent
with their position and I just
haven't chosen to act them out in
that way yet," Leland said.
Robert Moulton, Associate
Director of Administrative
Services at SLAC, tersely
commented about the Placement
Center demonstration: "In a
word, I approve of it."
Would Moulton block the
doors? "Well, that's the first time
I've been asked. I'd certainly
consider it."
