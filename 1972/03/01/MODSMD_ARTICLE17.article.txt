# I Solisti-Excellent
## 
### DAVID WILLIAMS 
Of all the major ensembles that
regularly perform eighteenth
century music, perhaps Soloisti di
Zagreb is the most consistently
excellent. I find myself
occasionally put off by I Musici's
brilliance, and sometimes the
approach of the Concentus Musici
results in a kind of pedantry.
One could hardly say such
things about the Soloisti, who has
become, even without the
leadership of Antonio Janigro, a
group of players unmatched for
smoothness of style and directness
of expression. Friday's concert
was noteworthy not only for the
quality of the playing, but as well
the actual quantity of the music
(six compositions and three
encores), and finally the variety of
styles encompassed by the
program.
The Soloisti began with the
magnificent D major Concerto
Grosso, opus 6 No. 4 of
Archangelo Corelli. It is
unfortunately very easy to impair
the sense of absolute
effortlessness in these twelve
concerted works, but from the
first moments of the opening
adagio introduction, it was
obvious that the soloisti were not
going to do the great 17th century
Italian composer that sort of
injustice. Instead the group
revealed much of Corelli's
inventiveness and profundity that
seemed new at least to this lover
of Corelli.
The magnificent Allegro, one
truly Roman in feeling and scale,
the adagio, a kind of walk in deep
woods reflecting upon the ruins of
time, the great fourth movement,
filled with pathos and excitement,
and the finale with the great
fanfare were all played with style,
clarity and intelligence.
This was the first time I had
heard the Vivaldi Concerto in C
for Piccolo and orchestra, and
while it seemed a minor work,
lacking in harmonic, though
certainly not melodic interest in
the tutti sections, it was at least a
good concerto with many fine
passages of first rate idiomatic
writing. Muradori's playing
was crisp, and nicely articulated,
and put everyone in good humor
to hear one of J.S. Bach's most
Vivaldiesque creations, the
Concerto in D minor for two
violins and orchestra. The tone

adopted by Messrs. Ninic and
Deltic was both clear and clean,
avoiding these heavy overtones
that so deeply afflicts so much of
the current style of playing Bach's
music.
Elegance
The elegance of Bach's design
was as much a part of the musical
experience as was the profundity
of the harmonics .and the
completeness of Bach's absorption
of Vivaldi's style. It was most
likely in the middle adagio that I
Soloisti were best, interpreting the
most popular of Bach's slow
concerto movements with
tenderness, avoiding all the
pitfalls, and singing sweetly.
I Soloisti opened the second
part of the program with A
Simple Symphony by Benjamin
Britten, opus 4, a thoroughly
delightful work, another work
quite new to this reviewer, and
one easily worth repeated
listenings. It is a conventional
enough composition in the usual
four movements suggesting the
harmonies of Brahms, but most
particularly those of Purcell.
The Soloisti were in complete
control, performing the work with
vivacity and charm. The Keleman
composition: Surprise (or:
Concertante Improvizations) was
a short piece ten minutes in
duration that was in no way
inferior to the rest of the
program, from any point of view.
Brisk And Brief
The Divertimento in D major,
K. 136 was easily identifiable as
early Mozart only because of its
brevity, its three movements
forming a composition about half
the length of most of the major
divertimenti. The brisk allegro was
played well enough to discern the
subtle balances achieved between
music written expressly for a
social occasion and the
outpourings of a young man
intent upon the study of harmony
and composition.
The Andante, a graceful
march-like reverie, and concluding
very Mozartian presto were all
played with real tact and even
brilliance. In all it was a fine
Friday night. The three encores
formed a last delicious desert, for
which the audience had paid in
part by a demonstration of
spirited and spontaneous
applause.

SINGING IN THE ROUND-Tony Sandler and Ralph Young will be
singing their way into the hearts of Circle Star Theatre patrons this
week in San Carlos. The singing team will perform tonight through
Friday night at 8:30 p.m., Saturday at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m. and
Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Ticket prices range from $3.75-$7.50.
Of all the major ensembles that
regularly perform eighteenth
century music, perhaps Soloisti di
Zagreb is the most consistently
excellent. I find myself
occasionally put off by I Musici's
brilliance, and sometimes the
approach of the Concentus Musici
results in a kind of pedantry.
One could hardly say such
things about the Soloisti, who has
become, even without the
leadership of Antonio Janigro, a
group of players unmatched for
smoothness of style and directness
of expression. Friday's concert
was noteworthy not only for the
quality of the playing, but as well
the actual quantity of the music
(six compositions and three
encores), and finally the variety of
styles encompassed by the
program.
The Soloisti began with the
magnificent D major Concerto
Grosso, opus 6 No. 4 of
Archangelo Corelli. It is
unfortunately very easy to impair
the sense of absolute
effortlessness in these twelve
concerted works, but from the
first moments of the opening
adagio introduction, it was
obvious that the soloisti were not
going to do the great 17th century
Italian composer that sort of
injustice. Instead the group
revealed much of Corelli's
inventiveness and profundity that
seemed new at least to this lover
of Corelli.
The magnificent Allegro, one
truly Roman in feeling and scale,
the adagio, a kind of walk in deep
woods reflecting upon the ruins of
time, the great fourth movement,
filled with pathos and excitement,
and the finale with the great
fanfare were all played with style,
clarity and intelligence.
This was the first time I had
heard the Vivaldi Concerto in C
for Piccolo and orchestra, and
while it seemed a minor work,
lacking in harmonic, though
certainly not melodic interest in
the tutti sections, it was at least a
good concerto with many fine
passages of first rate idiomatic
writing. Muradori's playing
was crisp, and nicely articulated,
and put everyone in good humor
to hear one of J.S. Bach's most
Vivaldiesque creations, the
Concerto in D minor for two
violins and orchestra. The tone

adopted by Messrs. Ninic and
Deltic was both clear and clean,
avoiding these heavy overtones
that so deeply afflicts so much of
the current style of playing Bach's
music.
Elegance
The elegance of Bach's design
was as much a part of the musical
experience as was the profundity
of the harmonics .and the
completeness of Bach's absorption
of Vivaldi's style. It was most
likely in the middle adagio that I
Soloisti were best, interpreting the
most popular of Bach's slow
concerto movements with
tenderness, avoiding all the
pitfalls, and singing sweetly.
I Soloisti opened the second
part of the program with A
Simple Symphony by Benjamin
Britten, opus 4, a thoroughly
delightful work, another work
quite new to this reviewer, and
one easily worth repeated
listenings. It is a conventional
enough composition in the usual
four movements suggesting the
harmonies of Brahms, but most
particularly those of Purcell.
The Soloisti were in complete
control, performing the work with
vivacity and charm. The Keleman
composition: Surprise (or:
Concertante Improvizations) was
a short piece ten minutes in
duration that was in no way
inferior to the rest of the
program, from any point of view.
Brisk And Brief
The Divertimento in D major,
K. 136 was easily identifiable as
early Mozart only because of its
brevity, its three movements
forming a composition about half
the length of most of the major
divertimenti. The brisk allegro was
played well enough to discern the
subtle balances achieved between
music written expressly for a
social occasion and the
outpourings of a young man
intent upon the study of harmony
and composition.
The Andante, a graceful
march-like reverie, and concluding
very Mozartian presto were all
played with real tact and even
brilliance. In all it was a fine
Friday night. The three encores
formed a last delicious desert, for
which the audience had paid in
part by a demonstration of
spirited and spontaneous
applause.
