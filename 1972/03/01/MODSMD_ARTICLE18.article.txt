# Bay Area Debut Of Dvorak Opera
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
What may very likely be the
musical highlight of the year at
Stanford opens its four-day run
tonight in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium: the Bay Area
premiere of Antonin Dvorak's
fairy-tale opera "Rusalka." How
Eastern European composers like
Smetana, Tchaikovsky, and
Rimski-Korsakov loved to cast
their opera-plots in the world of
princes, witches and enchantment
— and Vorak's "Rusalka" is firmly
in this tradition of fairy lore.
The tradition is rarely
represented in America — so this
"Rusalka" may indeed give a
nearly unique glimpse into an
unknown operatic realm. The
opera is based on a Czech version
of the Undine legend which seems
to crop up so frequently in drama,
ballet and opera. Undine is a
soulless water nymph who desires
a human soul because she has
fallen in love with a human
prince. Undermined by the plots
of a witch, the water-king, an evil
foreign princess, and the fickle
prince, Undine ultimately fails.
Real Delight
The real delight of the opera,
however, will be Dvorak's lush
and evocative music. Like his
compatriot Smetana, Dvorak was
a composer with remarkable
affinity to natural beauties.
Indeed, his music in "Rusalka"
seems a striking and pleasant
combination of Wagner's rich
orchestration, Smetana's verdant
evocation of the rhythms of
nature, and of Dvorak's own
Slavonic dances.
Stanford's resident conductor
San dor Salgo will lead the
orchestra; and John
Olon-Scrymgeour, from the

Drama Department, is the stage
director. His experience with
Giraudoux' play "Ondine" last
year will doubtless be put to good
use here.
If the Stanford Opera Theater's
past record is any indication
(three Mozartean delights, a
startlingly fine "Falstaff," and a
triumphant Offenbachian spree
last spring) — this curent operatic
adventure should be worth taking
part in.
Performances will run tonight
through Saturday, March 1
through 4, at 8 p.m. Tickets
($3.50, $2.50, $1.50) are on sale
at Tresidder box office and at
Ticketron agencies.

San dor Salgo will lead the
orchestra; and John
Olon-Scrymgeour, from the

Drama Department, is the stage
director. His experience with
Giraudoux' play "Ondine" last
year will doubtless be put to good
use here.
If the Stanford Opera Theater's
past record is any indication
(three Mozartean delights, a
startlingly fine "Falstaff," and a
triumphant Offenbachian spree
last spring) — this curent operatic
adventure should be worth taking
part in.
Performances will run tonight
through Saturday, March 1
through 4, at 8 p.m. Tickets
($3.50, $2.50, $1.50) are on sale
at Tresidder box office and at
Ticketron agencies.

STANFORD OPERA THEATER-The Stanford Opera Theater will
present the Bay Area premiere of Anton in Dvorak s fairy-tale opera
"Rusalka" tonight at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. "Rusalka"
will be presented nightly at 8 p.m. through Saturday. Tickets are
priced at $1.50, $2.50 and $3.50.
What may very likely be the
musical highlight of the year at
Stanford opens its four-day run
tonight in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium: the Bay Area
premiere of Antonin Dvorak's
fairy-tale opera "Rusalka." How
Eastern European composers like
Smetana, Tchaikovsky, and
Rimski-Korsakov loved to cast
their opera-plots in the world of
princes, witches and enchantment
— and Vorak's "Rusalka" is firmly
in this tradition of fairy lore.
The tradition is rarely
represented in America — so this
"Rusalka" may indeed give a
nearly unique glimpse into an
unknown operatic realm. The
opera is based on a Czech version
of the Undine legend which seems
to crop up so frequently in drama,
ballet and opera. Undine is a
soulless water nymph who desires
a human soul because she has
fallen in love with a human
prince. Undermined by the plots
of a witch, the water-king, an evil
foreign princess, and the fickle
prince, Undine ultimately fails.
Real Delight
The real delight of the opera,
however, will be Dvorak's lush
and evocative music. Like his
compatriot Smetana, Dvorak was
a composer with remarkable
affinity to natural beauties.
Indeed, his music in "Rusalka"
seems a striking and pleasant
combination of Wagner's rich
orchestration, Smetana's verdant
evocation of the rhythms of
nature, and of Dvorak's own
Slavonic dances.
