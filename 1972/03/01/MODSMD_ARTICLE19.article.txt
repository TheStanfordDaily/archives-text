(Leonard Bernstein's Mass: A
Theatre Piece for Singers, Players
and Dancers. Conducted by
Leonard Bernstein. Columbia M 2
31008.)
It is only after much careful
listening, reading of the text, and
Mr. Bernstein's own remarks
about his latest and most
complete success that one feels
willing to criticize his "Mass." In
the first place, this is surely a
work that is better for having
been seen, and I envy those who
saw it in Washington this winter
and those still luckier who will see
it in New York in the spring. In
the second, even the composer is
somewhat reluctant to judge the
Mass in any final way.
I can say however that it fully
deserves all the acclaim it has
received, for merely listening to it
reveals it in all respects a brilliant
composition and a major work,
and so deeply moving that it
seems a miracle to have been born
in what we all seem to agree is the
post-Christian era.
My earliest objections were
that it seemed unduly sentimental
and nostalgic in its attempt to
recreate musically the spirit of
"Camelot," as a kind of lost Eden,
but now it strikes me that that
very nostalgia, which is surely one
of its dominant characteristics,
goes far deeper.
Lenny's Nostalgia
Lenny's (and I have deep
respect and admiration for this
good man) nostalgia is then for
the lost world of the first century
A.D., and his religion in this work
closely resembles the Christianity
of the catacombs, before St. Paul
brought it above ground, stripped
it of its communistic implications,
dressed in Greek and served it to
Rome's governors, now insanely
corrupt.
The imagery of the catacombs,
of being in hiding, is surely less
beautiful than the Coptic version
of this symbolism, but I do not
think there are many among us
who have not at least sensed the
profundity of such imagery in the
age of Johnson and Nixon. These
early Christian attitudes are
perhaps best demonstrated in part
VII, the Epistie, ironically enough
the favorite literary form of St.
Paul, "The Word of the Lord,"
and IX, "Gospel Sermon: 'God
Said'."
There is more here than mere
nostalgia, and the mass is not
doctrinal, but richly theatrical,
and its form is a much expanded
version of the ordinary of the
Roman mass, and cannot be
described as revolutionary or even

very innovative. Britten's
additions to the Requium service
had no precedent that 1 can recall,
but Bernstein did have the
precedent of medieval masses, like
the Mauchaut Messe de Notre
Dame, where the various sections
of the ordinary are integrated and
set with the other less familiar
parts of the mass, i.e. the Introit,
the Gradual, Alleluia, Offretory,
Communion and Ite Missa Est.
Modern 'Wrestling'
The thing is that Bernstein
adds so much additional material
to his setting, until the ordinary
appears as the mere seed of the
idea, scattered like the remains of
Osiris through an elaborate
journey in the underworld of
American dissatisfaction with
what is happening now. Balanced
against the ethical constructs of
the early church, is a very modern
"wrestling" with God, particularly
in the "Non Credo," where the
celebrant asks the really crucial
question, "Will I become a god
again?" To which the group
replies "possibly yes, possibly
no . .Moreover in the Dona
Nobis Pacem, the celebrant
demands peace in a way that
deliberately recalls the martial
conclusions of Viennese classical
masses.
Though the design might be
described as a superimposition of
ballet upon Oratorio, the addition
of extracts and allusions to the
psalms add still more ancient
resonances to the sense of living
underground (an image perfectly
crafted for the new age of the
persecution of the priesthood of
Socrates. Let us pray for
Stanford, UCLA, Ronald Reagan,
Richard Nixon and the CIA (those
slave-trading Cabots and
hand-hungry Lodges) — "Sancte
Socrates Ora pro nobis."
Throughout the mass, the
phrase "Lauda, Laude" is
employed like a leit motif,
keeping fresh in our minds the
ritualistic quality of the Mass's
opening pages, before the religious
content of our traditions has been
analyzed, synthesized and
criticized. Moreover it is the
quality of praise, an expression of
the love of life, if not all things
human, that holds together a wide
variety of American and European
musical traditions.
While Imama Ameer Baraka
has said in "Black Music" that
most attempts to blend
Afro-American and European
music have utterly failed, here,
one hastens to add, the brilliant
use of Rock music, particularly in
the confiteor, provides an

aesthetic-cultural bridge between
American styles of Europe origin
and a fairly up to date
Afro-American rhythm and blues
style, sung by black artists in the
Mowtown manner with a dash of
kosher salt.
True Melting Pot
It is true that in the blues
"movements" Bernstein's style
suggests that of "Hair," but purity
of style ceases to be an issue in a
true melting pot. Bernstein's
"style" then becomes difficult to
describe succinctly; it is surely a
blend, indeed a rich one, and
while 1 do not remember the "Age
of Anxiety" or "Jeremiah"
symphonies very well, I heard
constant echoes of "West Side
Story" and "Candide."
The issue of the drama and the
Mass is of crucial importance, not
that the mass in the hands of
Bach, Haydn or Beethoven is not
a dramatic work — how could it
be otherwise with two
resurrection sequences, but
Bernstein makes of the mass a
distinctly secular spectacle. Thus
the dances, costumes and stages of
the modem world supply that
sense of the spectacular that
Renaissance and Baroque
churches lent to the church music
of Palestrina and Monteverdi.
Bernstein's mass, like the
sacred dramas of Handel was
designed for the stage. As for the
wisdom of Bernstein's stylistic
decisions, I can only assert that I
find them acceptable not to say
fascinating, but it is here that we
will have to admit that it is up to
"after ages" to grasp "ultimate
relevances," and while that verdict
might be "more gimickry," I
suspect our decendents will agree
with us that the artist was a genius
of some discrimination.
In short there is much that is
new here and more than is truly
exciting, and nothing is banal or
conventional — though the style is
of obvious New York origin and
extremely polished. There will no
doubt be more recordings of this
work, but there seems to be every
reason to buy this one. The
composer, often a great conductor
(as anyone who knows his now
classic "Missa Solemnis," among a
dozen others, will tell you), seems
to get the utmost out of the small
orchestra, the various singers and
choirs. Moreover Alan Titus who
sings the celebrant gives a richly
intelligent performance,
particularly in section xvi:
Fraction: Things get broken. This
may not be a work for all time
but it is surely a work for ours.

Modern 'Wrestling'
The thing is that Bernstein
adds so much additional material
to his setting, until the ordinary
appears as the mere seed of the
idea, scattered like the remains of
Osiris through an elaborate
journey in the underworld of
American dissatisfaction with
what is happening now. Balanced
against the ethical constructs of
the early church, is a very modern
"wrestling" with God, particularly
in the "Non Credo," where the
celebrant asks the really crucial
question, "Will I become a god
again?" To which the group
replies "possibly yes, possibly
no . .Moreover in the Dona
Nobis Pacem, the celebrant
demands peace in a way that
deliberately recalls the martial
conclusions of Viennese classical
masses.
Though the design might be
described as a superimposition of
ballet upon Oratorio, the addition
of extracts and allusions to the
psalms add still more ancient
resonances to the sense of living
underground (an image perfectly
crafted for the new age of the
persecution of the priesthood of
Socrates. Let us pray for
Stanford, UCLA, Ronald Reagan,
Richard Nixon and the CIA (those
slave-trading Cabots and
hand-hungry Lodges) — "Sancte
Socrates Ora pro nobis."
Throughout the mass, the
phrase "Lauda, Laude" is
employed like a leit motif,
keeping fresh in our minds the
ritualistic quality of the Mass's
opening pages, before the religious
content of our traditions has been
analyzed, synthesized and
criticized. Moreover it is the
quality of praise, an expression of
the love of life, if not all things
human, that holds together a wide
variety of American and European
musical traditions.
While Imama Ameer Baraka
has said in "Black Music" that
most attempts to blend
Afro-American and European
music have utterly failed, here,
one hastens to add, the brilliant
use of Rock music, particularly in
the confiteor, provides an

aesthetic-cultural bridge between
American styles of Europe origin
and a fairly up to date
Afro-American rhythm and blues
style, sung by black artists in the
Mowtown manner with a dash of
kosher salt.
True Melting Pot
It is true that in the blues
"movements" Bernstein's style
suggests that of "Hair," but purity
of style ceases to be an issue in a
true melting pot. Bernstein's
"style" then becomes difficult to
describe succinctly; it is surely a
blend, indeed a rich one, and
while 1 do not remember the "Age
of Anxiety" or "Jeremiah"
symphonies very well, I heard
constant echoes of "West Side
Story" and "Candide."
The issue of the drama and the
Mass is of crucial importance, not
that the mass in the hands of
Bach, Haydn or Beethoven is not
a dramatic work — how could it
be otherwise with two
resurrection sequences, but
Bernstein makes of the mass a
distinctly secular spectacle. Thus
the dances, costumes and stages of
the modem world supply that
sense of the spectacular that
Renaissance and Baroque
churches lent to the church music
of Palestrina and Monteverdi.
Bernstein's mass, like the
sacred dramas of Handel was
designed for the stage. As for the
wisdom of Bernstein's stylistic
decisions, I can only assert that I
find them acceptable not to say
fascinating, but it is here that we
will have to admit that it is up to
"after ages" to grasp "ultimate
relevances," and while that verdict
might be "more gimickry," I
suspect our decendents will agree
with us that the artist was a genius
of some discrimination.
In short there is much that is
new here and more than is truly
exciting, and nothing is banal or
conventional — though the style is
of obvious New York origin and
extremely polished. There will no
doubt be more recordings of this
work, but there seems to be every
reason to buy this one. The
composer, often a great conductor
(as anyone who knows his now
classic "Missa Solemnis," among a
dozen others, will tell you), seems
to get the utmost out of the small
orchestra, the various singers and
choirs. Moreover Alan Titus who
sings the celebrant gives a richly
intelligent performance,
particularly in section xvi:
Fraction: Things get broken. This
may not be a work for all time
but it is surely a work for ours.

Theatre Piece for Singers, Players
and Dancers. Conducted by
Leonard Bernstein. Columbia M 2

It is only after much careful
listening, reading of the text, and
Mr. Bernstein's own remarks
about his latest and most
complete success that one feels
willing to criticize his "Mass." In
the first place, this is surely a
work that is better for having
been seen, and I envy those who
saw it in Washington this winter
and those still luckier who will see
it in New York in the spring. In
the second, even the composer is
somewhat reluctant to judge the
Mass in any final way.
I can say however that it fully
deserves all the acclaim it has
received, for merely listening to it
reveals it in all respects a brilliant
composition and a major work,
and so deeply moving that it
seems a miracle to have been born
in what we all seem to agree is the
post-Christian era.
My earliest objections were
that it seemed unduly sentimental
and nostalgic in its attempt to
recreate musically the spirit of
"Camelot," as a kind of lost Eden,
but now it strikes me that that
very nostalgia, which is surely one
of its dominant characteristics,
goes far deeper.
Lenny's Nostalgia
Lenny's (and I have deep
respect and admiration for this
good man) nostalgia is then for
the lost world of the first century
A.D., and his religion in this work
closely resembles the Christianity
of the catacombs, before St. Paul
brought it above ground, stripped
it of its communistic implications,
dressed in Greek and served it to
Rome's governors, now insanely
corrupt.
The imagery of the catacombs,
of being in hiding, is surely less
beautiful than the Coptic version
of this symbolism, but I do not
think there are many among us
who have not at least sensed the
profundity of such imagery in the
age of Johnson and Nixon. These
early Christian attitudes are
perhaps best demonstrated in part
VII, the Epistie, ironically enough
the favorite literary form of St.
Paul, "The Word of the Lord,"
and IX, "Gospel Sermon: 'God
Said'."
There is more here than mere
nostalgia, and the mass is not
doctrinal, but richly theatrical,
and its form is a much expanded
version of the ordinary of the
Roman mass, and cannot be
described as revolutionary or even

very innovative. Britten's
additions to the Requium service
had no precedent that 1 can recall,
but Bernstein did have the
precedent of medieval masses, like
the Mauchaut Messe de Notre
Dame, where the various sections
of the ordinary are integrated and
set with the other less familiar
parts of the mass, i.e. the Introit,
the Gradual, Alleluia, Offretory,
Communion and Ite Missa Est.

resurrection sequences, but
Bernstein makes of the mass a
distinctly secular spectacle. Thus
the dances, costumes and stages of
the modem world supply that
sense of the spectacular that
Renaissance and Baroque
churches lent to the church music
of Palestrina and Monteverdi.
Bernstein's mass, like the
sacred dramas of Handel was
designed for the stage. As for the
wisdom of Bernstein's stylistic
decisions, I can only assert that I
find them acceptable not to say
fascinating, but it is here that we
will have to admit that it is up to
"after ages" to grasp "ultimate
relevances," and while that verdict
might be "more gimickry," I
suspect our decendents will agree
with us that the artist was a genius
of some discrimination.
In short there is much that is
new here and more than is truly
exciting, and nothing is banal or
conventional — though the style is
of obvious New York origin and
extremely polished. There will no
doubt be more recordings of this
work, but there seems to be every
reason to buy this one. The
composer, often a great conductor
(as anyone who knows his now
classic "Missa Solemnis," among a
dozen others, will tell you), seems
to get the utmost out of the small
orchestra, the various singers and
choirs. Moreover Alan Titus who
sings the celebrant gives a richly
intelligent performance,
particularly in section xvi:
Fraction: Things get broken. This
may not be a work for all time
but it is surely a work for ours.

It is only after much careful
listening, reading of the text, and
Mr. Bernstein's own remarks
about his latest and most
complete success that one feels
willing to criticize his "Mass." In
the first place, this is surely a
work that is better for having
been seen, and I envy those who
saw it in Washington this winter
and those still luckier who will see
it in New York in the spring. In
the second, even the composer is
somewhat reluctant to judge the
Mass in any final way.
I can say however that it fully
deserves all the acclaim it has
received, for merely listening to it
reveals it in all respects a brilliant
composition and a major work,
and so deeply moving that it
seems a miracle to have been born
in what we all seem to agree is the
post-Christian era.
My earliest objections were
that it seemed unduly sentimental
and nostalgic in its attempt to
recreate musically the spirit of
"Camelot," as a kind of lost Eden,
but now it strikes me that that
very nostalgia, which is surely one
of its dominant characteristics,
goes far deeper.
Lenny's Nostalgia
Lenny's (and I have deep
respect and admiration for this
good man) nostalgia is then for
the lost world of the first century
A.D., and his religion in this work
closely resembles the Christianity
of the catacombs, before St. Paul
brought it above ground, stripped
it of its communistic implications,
dressed in Greek and served it to
Rome's governors, now insanely
corrupt.
The imagery of the catacombs,
of being in hiding, is surely less
beautiful than the Coptic version
of this symbolism, but I do not
think there are many among us
who have not at least sensed the
profundity of such imagery in the
age of Johnson and Nixon. These
early Christian attitudes are
perhaps best demonstrated in part
VII, the Epistie, ironically enough
the favorite literary form of St.
Paul, "The Word of the Lord,"
and IX, "Gospel Sermon: 'God
Said'."
There is more here than mere
nostalgia, and the mass is not
doctrinal, but richly theatrical,
and its form is a much expanded
version of the ordinary of the
Roman mass, and cannot be
described as revolutionary or even

very innovative. Britten's
additions to the Requium service
had no precedent that 1 can recall,
but Bernstein did have the
precedent of medieval masses, like
the Mauchaut Messe de Notre
Dame, where the various sections
of the ordinary are integrated and
set with the other less familiar
parts of the mass, i.e. the Introit,
the Gradual, Alleluia, Offretory,
Communion and Ite Missa Est.
Modern 'Wrestling'
The thing is that Bernstein
adds so much additional material
to his setting, until the ordinary
appears as the mere seed of the
idea, scattered like the remains of
Osiris through an elaborate
journey in the underworld of
American dissatisfaction with
what is happening now. Balanced
against the ethical constructs of
the early church, is a very modern
"wrestling" with God, particularly
in the "Non Credo," where the
celebrant asks the really crucial
question, "Will I become a god
again?" To which the group
replies "possibly yes, possibly
no . .Moreover in the Dona
Nobis Pacem, the celebrant
demands peace in a way that
deliberately recalls the martial
conclusions of Viennese classical
masses.
Though the design might be
described as a superimposition of
ballet upon Oratorio, the addition
of extracts and allusions to the
psalms add still more ancient
resonances to the sense of living
underground (an image perfectly
crafted for the new age of the
persecution of the priesthood of
Socrates. Let us pray for
Stanford, UCLA, Ronald Reagan,
Richard Nixon and the CIA (those
slave-trading Cabots and
hand-hungry Lodges) — "Sancte
Socrates Ora pro nobis."
Throughout the mass, the
phrase "Lauda, Laude" is
employed like a leit motif,
keeping fresh in our minds the
ritualistic quality of the Mass's
opening pages, before the religious
content of our traditions has been
analyzed, synthesized and
criticized. Moreover it is the
quality of praise, an expression of
the love of life, if not all things
human, that holds together a wide
variety of American and European
musical traditions.
While Imama Ameer Baraka
has said in "Black Music" that
most attempts to blend
Afro-American and European
music have utterly failed, here,
one hastens to add, the brilliant
use of Rock music, particularly in
the confiteor, provides an

aesthetic-cultural bridge between
American styles of Europe origin
and a fairly up to date
Afro-American rhythm and blues
style, sung by black artists in the
Mowtown manner with a dash of
kosher salt.
True Melting Pot
It is true that in the blues
"movements" Bernstein's style
suggests that of "Hair," but purity
of style ceases to be an issue in a
true melting pot. Bernstein's
"style" then becomes difficult to
describe succinctly; it is surely a
blend, indeed a rich one, and
while 1 do not remember the "Age
of Anxiety" or "Jeremiah"
symphonies very well, I heard
constant echoes of "West Side
Story" and "Candide."
The issue of the drama and the
Mass is of crucial importance, not
that the mass in the hands of
Bach, Haydn or Beethoven is not
a dramatic work — how could it
be otherwise with two
resurrection sequences, but
Bernstein makes of the mass a
distinctly secular spectacle. Thus
the dances, costumes and stages of
the modem world supply that
