# Track Season Opens
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
The Stanford track team that opens its season
against Fresno State this Saturday will be quite
different from last year's squad.
The loss of veteran talent will be felt keenly:
Chuck Francis and Rick Tipton in the short sprints;
Jim Kauffman and Rufus Shaw in the 440; Randy
White in the intermediate hurdles; Don Kardong and
Duncan Macdonald in the distance events; Steve
Davis in the shot and discus; Casey Carrigan in the
pole vault; and Allen Meredith in the triple jump.
Athletes like these will be hard to replace.
Despite such losses, Coach Payton Jordan is
optimistic toward this year's season. "We have a lot
of young and inexperienced people, but the
potential is very promising." The team has been
working hard since early fall quarter. "I'm sorry to
lose good veterans," Jordan said, "but I'm so happy
with these youngsters. They've worked so well and
looked so good that I have to be optimistic."
Impressive Newcomers
Some of the newcomers bring impressive
statistics along with them. Freshman Jim Howard
was the nation's leading prep discus thrower last
year, and has thrown the college disc over 170 feet.
Skip Grodahl, also a freshman, cleared 6'9" in the
high jump last year. Transfer Mel Ho has both a
24'4" long jump and a 49'9" triple jump to his
credit. Sophomore Bob Barmeyer passed up his
freshman season last year, but elected to come out
for the team this year. He has done a 9.7 100 and a
21.3 220.
The rest of the team consists of a few veteran
performers backed up by a lot of freshmen and
sophomores. The Indians will advance into the
spring coming off an intensive pre-season
conditioning program and one of the most
rewarding cross country campaigns in years. "If
hard work means anything," says Jordan, "this team
will come up with victories . . . Unfortunately, there
are some events where we will come up very short,
and this will put tremendous pressure on many of
our athletes to pick up the slack in other areas."
Strong Quartermilers
The heart of any track team is its sprinters.
Though a little short of depth in the 100 and 220,
the Tribe has possibly its strongest group of
quarter-milers in years. "If they can do what they're
supposed to do, we have the potential to be a
stronger and better balanced team than last year,"
Jordan stated. There are seven quarter-milers who
have run the distance in under 50 seconds, led by
team captain John Anderson, who has been clocked
at 47.8.
The 100 and 220 should be dominated by
sophomore Ken Curl who ran a 9.3 and 21.2 in the
events in high school. Ken has lost 30 pounds since
last year, and Coach Jordan believes, "Curl has the
ingredients to be one of the great sprinters in the
country, when he is in the right condition." He will
be backed up by Barmeyer.
Moving on to the 880, Dave Whiteing should be
the strongest in this event with a 1971 best of

1:54.0. Arvid Kretz is currently the team's leader in
both the mile and two mile. Last spring he ran a
4:07.0 and an 8:49.4. Other top distance men
include Brian Mittelstaedt and Les McFadden in the
mile, and Mark McConnell and Kurt Schoenrock in
the two mile.
Long In Hurdles
Top among hurdlers should be Tom Long with a
14.2 in the highs and 52.3 in the intermediates last
spring. Backing him up will be John Anderson and
Dave Bagshaw in the highs, and Mark Haight in both
the highs and intermediates.
In the javelin, sophomores Steve Hopkins and
Rick Larson should both be consistently over 200
feet. Howard will lead the discus throwers with
support from Jim Royer and Pete Dreissigacker.
Tom Anderson will go for the 26 foot mark in the
long jump and will also compete in the high jump.
50'0" triple jumper Rod Utley sat out most of last
year with injuries, but is ready to go again this
season.
Two of the weaker events are the shot put and
pole vault. Ralph Bakkensen will be trying to better
his 52'2'/2" mark in the shot, and injury -ridden Tom
Lindsay should be consistently over 15 feet in the
vault when he is well.
Intersquad Meet
The team held its intersquad meet last
Wednesday. Using the results from that meet, Coach
Jordan and his assistants, Marshall Clark, Bud
Spencer, and Bill Moultrie, will decide who
competes against Fresno Saturday.
Highlights of the intersquad meet included a
9:06.4 two mile by Kretz, a 202'9" personal best
for Larson behind Hopkins' winning 204'9" in the
javelin, Rod Utley's 48'7 1 /2" triple jump, and mile
relay splits of 48.1, 48.5, and 48.6, by John
Anderson, John Kessel, and Dave Bagshaw.
Freshmen and sophomores won nine out of fifteen
individual events.
The Tribe takes on Occidental and Redlands over
spring break. Then it has to deal with USC, UCLA,
and Cal, three of the strongest teams in the country.
"If we come through our first few meets well," said
Jordan, "we could pull a few surprises."

NO CONTEST- All-American Rod Boone easily beats out the USF third baseman's throw to first for a
single during the Indians doubleheader sweep of the Dons on February 12th. The Stanford varsity will
meet Fresno State this afternoon in a doubleheader at Sunken Diamond beginning at noon. Fresno State
split a doubleheader last weekend with the Indians, losing the first game 4-2 and taking the second 2-0.

PASS IT ON—Sophomore Ken Curl passes the baton to Captain John Anderson in the 440 yard relay
against Oregon State last spring. Both should compete for the Indians in the 440 relay again this year.
Individually, Anderson is the team's leading quarter-miler, and Curl won the 100 yard dash in the
intersquad meet held last Wednesday.
