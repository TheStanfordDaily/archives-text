# Pitchers Impressive In Wins
## 
### MIKE HERMAN 
The clutch hitting of catcher
Bob Reese and the continued fine
performance of the Indian
pitching Staff combined to help
Stanford to a successful weekend
of baseball which included an
exciting extra-inning victory over
the University of Santa Clara, 6-5
on Friday and a hardfought
doubleheader split against Fresno
State College, 4-2 and 0-2 on
Saturday.
All three contests proved to be
stern early-season tests for the
Indians, as they continued to
prepare for the opening of the
Pacific Eight season.
On Friday afternoon, Stanford
became involved in one of the
most thrilling games played so far
in the season. Against Santa Clara,
the Cards entered the top of the
ninth inning trailing by a run, 3-2.
On the first pitch, Reese slashed a
wicked drive which bounced over
the fence for a ground rule
double. One out later, first
baseman Mark Lucich, the
sophomore from Eureka, stroked
a single, driving in Reese from
second with the tying run.
In the bottom of the ninth,
pitcher Mike Higgins allowed the
potential winning run to reach
second base, but induced Gene
Delyon, the Bronco's top hitter at

.607, to strike out, ending the
threat and sending the game into
extra innings.
In the top of the tenth, the
Indians broke the game wide
open, by exploding for three runs.
Second baseman Dave Edson
drove home the go ahead run with
a single, setting the stage for a
two-run home run by Reese.
With the game apparently iced,
the Indians immediately began to
make problems for themselves, as
the Broncos came right back with
a walk and three singles,
producing two runs. With runners
on first and second and two outs,
Bruce Bochte, possibly the best
clutch hitter on the Santa Clara
team, stepped to bat. A wild pitch
moved the runners to second and
third, under which circumstances
Bochte was walked intentionally.
Gene Delyon, who had, an inning
earlier, missed an opportunity to
win the game, came to the plate.
Pitching carefully, Higgins again
foiled the Bronco's star by making
him hit back to the box to end
the rally.
The first game of Saturday's
doubleheader against Eresno State
resulted in the much expected
classic pitching due! between
State's fireballing strike out ace,
Dick Ruphden and Dave Shaw,
the Indians' outstanding

righthander. Fresno scored first,
collecting two runs in the second
inning. However, the Indians came
right back, picking up all four of
their runs in one inning.
Dave Edson and centerfielder
Tom Williams, currently the team
leader with a .425 average, opened
with singles, followed by a walk
to All-American Rod Boone. Mark
Lucich then drove in one run with
a single, which was followed by
two strike outs. With the bases
loaded, Bob Reese again
responded in the clutch with a
double, driving in all three
runners.
The second game was also
low-scoring, not so much because
of the pitching, but more because
of the Indians' inability to
generate any offense. Bob Di
Pietro started for the Indians and
pitched well, but lacked support.
State's Dan Grimm held the
suddenly impotent Cards to just
five hits, recording a well-pitched
shutout.
The Indians, now 9-4 of the
season, must play six games in the
next five days, including a
rematch today at Santa Clara and
a game here tomorrow against the
University of San Francisco at
2:30 p.m. at the Sunken
Diamond.

loaded, Bob Reese again
responded in the clutch with a
double, driving in all three
runners.
The second game was also
low-scoring, not so much because
of the pitching, but more because
of the Indians' inability to
generate any offense. Bob Di
Pietro started for the Indians and
pitched well, but lacked support.
State's Dan Grimm held the
suddenly impotent Cards to just
five hits, recording a well-pitched
shutout.
The Indians, now 9-4 of the
season, must play six games in the
next five days, including a
rematch today at Santa Clara and
a game here tomorrow against the
University of San Francisco at
2:30 p.m. at the Sunken
Diamond.
The clutch hitting of catcher
Bob Reese and the continued fine
performance of the Indian
pitching Staff combined to help
Stanford to a successful weekend
of baseball which included an
exciting extra-inning victory over
the University of Santa Clara, 6-5
on Friday and a hardfought
doubleheader split against Fresno
State College, 4-2 and 0-2 on
Saturday.
All three contests proved to be
stern early-season tests for the
Indians, as they continued to
prepare for the opening of the
Pacific Eight season.
On Friday afternoon, Stanford
became involved in one of the
most thrilling games played so far
in the season. Against Santa Clara,
the Cards entered the top of the
ninth inning trailing by a run, 3-2.
On the first pitch, Reese slashed a
wicked drive which bounced over
the fence for a ground rule
double. One out later, first
baseman Mark Lucich, the
sophomore from Eureka, stroked
a single, driving in Reese from
second with the tying run.
In the bottom of the ninth,
pitcher Mike Higgins allowed the
potential winning run to reach
second base, but induced Gene
Delyon, the Bronco's top hitter at

.607, to strike out, ending the
threat and sending the game into
extra innings.
In the top of the tenth, the
Indians broke the game wide
open, by exploding for three runs.
Second baseman Dave Edson
drove home the go ahead run with
a single, setting the stage for a
two-run home run by Reese.
With the game apparently iced,
the Indians immediately began to
make problems for themselves, as
the Broncos came right back with
a walk and three singles,
producing two runs. With runners
on first and second and two outs,
Bruce Bochte, possibly the best
clutch hitter on the Santa Clara
team, stepped to bat. A wild pitch
moved the runners to second and
third, under which circumstances
Bochte was walked intentionally.
Gene Delyon, who had, an inning
earlier, missed an opportunity to
win the game, came to the plate.
Pitching carefully, Higgins again
foiled the Bronco's star by making
him hit back to the box to end
the rally.
The first game of Saturday's
doubleheader against Eresno State
resulted in the much expected
classic pitching due! between
State's fireballing strike out ace,
Dick Ruphden and Dave Shaw,
the Indians' outstanding

righthander. Fresno scored first,
collecting two runs in the second
inning. However, the Indians came
right back, picking up all four of
their runs in one inning.
Dave Edson and centerfielder
Tom Williams, currently the team
leader with a .425 average, opened
with singles, followed by a walk
to All-American Rod Boone. Mark
Lucich then drove in one run with
a single, which was followed by
two strike outs. With the bases
loaded, Bob Reese again
responded in the clutch with a
double, driving in all three
runners.
