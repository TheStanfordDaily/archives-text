# Abby: She Columns As She Sees 'em
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
DEAR READERS: Communications
Professor Bill Rivers had a problem
yesterday. And he couldn't even write
Dear Abby about it. She was causing
it.
His problem was where to stick the
crowd of 250 that had shown up for
class to hear Pauline Esther Phillips,
better known as advice columnist
Abigail Van Buren.
But she didn't give Bill or the class
any advice. So here's some of mine. If
you ever get the chance to hear her,
do.
She recalled the letter that made
her "the fastest rising columnist" after
she'd been doing the thing only 20
days. "A girl wrote: 'Dear Abby: I
don't drink a lot. But recently, on my
21st birthday my boyfriend and I
went out to celebrate. We had three
martinis before dinner, champagne
with dinner, and three brandies after
dinner. Did I do anything wrong'?' "
Abby's answer: "Probably."
How did Abby get started?
"My husband and I moved out to

San Francisco in 1946," says Abby,
who was just Pauline then. She was 28
and had been married seven years.
Chronicle Start
"The Chronicle was running an
advice column from Denver," she says.
So Abby went to the Chron and said
she could do a better one The editor
asked her experience. A journalism
major at Sioux City, lowa. "He was
visibly underwhelmed," says Abby.
But the editor did give her a batch
of columns from the Denver advisor
and told Abby to write her own
answers and bring them back in a
week. Abby was back in a couple of
hours.
"Don't call us, we'll call you," the
editor said. By the time Abby got
home he had called twice and before
she could return the call he rang again.
As Abby says,"The sample was
ample."
In three months she was in 300
newspapers. She is now in 1000
newspapers, on every continent, seen
by 55 million readers. She gets
problems from Bangkok and the Fiji

Islands and has to get a host of
interpreters for the letters written in
every language from Japanese to
Danish.
One girl said, "I knew this one guy
who sent you thousands of phony
letters trying to get one in but he
never did."
"I think I know the guy," replied
Abby.
Phony Letters
"The phony ones are always
overdone," she claims. "They say
things like 'Please print this.' The real
ones always say things like 'please
change the facts a little because this is
a small town and people will recognize
me." Now you know for your next
thousand, fella.
Abby claimed she sends everybody
a personal letter. That's pretty
amazing when you figure she has one
staff member who just opens her mail
all day. She says she has about six staff
members who also help her.
Someone asked why she didn't use
her influence to "run for office or run
a revolution or something." She said
she didn't want to impose her politics
on her readers.
But she did break that rule
recently. She had received a lot of mail
requesting she ask her readers to write
Hanoi to release the POW's. On
February 12 she wrote her readers if
they wanted the POW's home they
shouldn't write Hanoi but to President
Nixon to end the "senseless war."
Much Feedback
She said that as expected, she's
received a lot of mail. And for Dear
Abby, a lot of mail ain't a few
postcards. One time she asked her
readers for some help on a question
and received over 887,000 replies.
She read some of the mail.
"Dear Abby: Thank you for your
help to Peiping, Moscow, Hanoi, and
Jane Fonda."
Or, "Dear Abby: Apparently the
only thing you read in the papers is
your own column."
Abby's sister is another advice
columnist, Ann Landers. They are
identical twins. And how! They were
married in the same ceremony and
both started their column the same
month.
What does she think of her sister?
"She's the wittiest person I know.
She's just great. After all, we are
identical." Abby recalls the time Ann
was going to give a speech in Dallas
and Abby wished her luck, saying, "I

hope you lay them in the aisles." Ann
replied, "I've lost my speech. I may
have to."
Money To Charity
I'll bet you're wondering how much
Abby rakes in. Not a cent. All her
earnings go to charities. In fact, there
is even some Abigail Van Buren
research at Stanford.
On acne. On the face of it, that
seems like a pretty superfacial
problem, but Abby says the emotional
scars of acne are often as bad as
physical injury.
Abby was also questioned about
her milk ad. She said she was "a little
ashamed of it and I probably wouldn't
do it again," although she noted the
$25,000 she milked from it went to a
hospital.
CONFIDENTIAL TO WHOEVER IS
STILL READING: Abby doesn't do
many speaking engagements so why
did she come to Stanford? "That Bill
Rivers can really communicate," she
says."I get this letter that says, 'Dear
Abby: I've got a problem. We don't
have dough enough to afford you, but
would you come and see the kids in
our neighborhood?"
"After that," she says,"I decided
I'd come even if I had to pay the car
fare. And I did."

her influence to "run for office or run

Hanoi to release the POW's. On

shouldn't write Hanoi but to President
Nixon to end the "senseless war."

She read some of the mail.

Abby's sister is another advice

She's just great. After all, we are

is even some Abigail Van Buren
research at Stanford.

Abby was also questioned about

do it again," although she noted the
$25,000 she milked from it went to a

DEAR ABBY—Pauline Esther Phillips (alias Abigail Van Buren), known to
millions of heart-broken Americans for her "Dear Abby" column, speaks
yesterday to Communications Department class.
DEAR READERS: Communications
Professor Bill Rivers had a problem
yesterday. And he couldn't even write
Dear Abby about it. She was causing
it.
His problem was where to stick the
crowd of 250 that had shown up for
class to hear Pauline Esther Phillips,
better known as advice columnist
Abigail Van Buren.
But she didn't give Bill or the class
any advice. So here's some of mine. If
you ever get the chance to hear her,
do.
She recalled the letter that made
her "the fastest rising columnist" after
she'd been doing the thing only 20
days. "A girl wrote: 'Dear Abby: I
don't drink a lot. But recently, on my
21st birthday my boyfriend and I
went out to celebrate. We had three
martinis before dinner, champagne
with dinner, and three brandies after
dinner. Did I do anything wrong'?' "
Abby's answer: "Probably."
How did Abby get started?
"My husband and I moved out to

San Francisco in 1946," says Abby,
who was just Pauline then. She was 28
and had been married seven years.
Chronicle Start
"The Chronicle was running an
advice column from Denver," she says.
So Abby went to the Chron and said
she could do a better one The editor
asked her experience. A journalism
major at Sioux City, lowa. "He was
visibly underwhelmed," says Abby.
But the editor did give her a batch
of columns from the Denver advisor
and told Abby to write her own
answers and bring them back in a
week. Abby was back in a couple of
hours.
"Don't call us, we'll call you," the
editor said. By the time Abby got
home he had called twice and before
she could return the call he rang again.
As Abby says,"The sample was
ample."
In three months she was in 300
newspapers. She is now in 1000
newspapers, on every continent, seen
by 55 million readers. She gets
problems from Bangkok and the Fiji

Islands and has to get a host of
interpreters for the letters written in
every language from Japanese to
Danish.
One girl said, "I knew this one guy
who sent you thousands of phony
letters trying to get one in but he
never did."
"I think I know the guy," replied
Abby.
Phony Letters
"The phony ones are always
overdone," she claims. "They say
things like 'Please print this.' The real
ones always say things like 'please
change the facts a little because this is
a small town and people will recognize
me." Now you know for your next
thousand, fella.
Abby claimed she sends everybody

DEAR ABBY—Pauline Esther Phillips (alias Abigail Van Buren), known to
millions of heart-broken Americans for her "Dear Abby" column, speaks
yesterday to Communications Department class.
DEAR READERS: Communications
Professor Bill Rivers had a problem
yesterday. And he couldn't even write
Dear Abby about it. She was causing
it.
His problem was where to stick the
crowd of 250 that had shown up for
class to hear Pauline Esther Phillips,
better known as advice columnist
Abigail Van Buren.
But she didn't give Bill or the class
any advice. So here's some of mine. If
you ever get the chance to hear her,
do.
She recalled the letter that made
her "the fastest rising columnist" after
she'd been doing the thing only 20
days. "A girl wrote: 'Dear Abby: I
don't drink a lot. But recently, on my
21st birthday my boyfriend and I
went out to celebrate. We had three
martinis before dinner, champagne
with dinner, and three brandies after
dinner. Did I do anything wrong'?' "
Abby's answer: "Probably."
How did Abby get started?
"My husband and I moved out to

San Francisco in 1946," says Abby,
who was just Pauline then. She was 28
and had been married seven years.
Chronicle Start
"The Chronicle was running an
advice column from Denver," she says.
So Abby went to the Chron and said
she could do a better one The editor
asked her experience. A journalism
major at Sioux City, lowa. "He was
visibly underwhelmed," says Abby.
But the editor did give her a batch
of columns from the Denver advisor
and told Abby to write her own
answers and bring them back in a
week. Abby was back in a couple of
hours.
"Don't call us, we'll call you," the
editor said. By the time Abby got
home he had called twice and before
she could return the call he rang again.
As Abby says,"The sample was
ample."
In three months she was in 300
newspapers. She is now in 1000
newspapers, on every continent, seen
by 55 million readers. She gets
problems from Bangkok and the Fiji

Islands and has to get a host of
interpreters for the letters written in
every language from Japanese to
Danish.
One girl said, "I knew this one guy
who sent you thousands of phony
letters trying to get one in but he
never did."
"I think I know the guy," replied
Abby.
Phony Letters
"The phony ones are always
overdone," she claims. "They say
things like 'Please print this.' The real
ones always say things like 'please
change the facts a little because this is
a small town and people will recognize
me." Now you know for your next
thousand, fella.
Abby claimed she sends everybody
a personal letter. That's pretty
amazing when you figure she has one
staff member who just opens her mail
all day. She says she has about six staff
members who also help her.
Someone asked why she didn't use
her influence to "run for office or run
a revolution or something." She said
she didn't want to impose her politics
on her readers.
But she did break that rule
recently. She had received a lot of mail
requesting she ask her readers to write
Hanoi to release the POW's. On
February 12 she wrote her readers if
they wanted the POW's home they
shouldn't write Hanoi but to President
Nixon to end the "senseless war."
Much Feedback
She said that as expected, she's
received a lot of mail. And for Dear
Abby, a lot of mail ain't a few
postcards. One time she asked her
readers for some help on a question
and received over 887,000 replies.
She read some of the mail.
"Dear Abby: Thank you for your
help to Peiping, Moscow, Hanoi, and
Jane Fonda."
Or, "Dear Abby: Apparently the
only thing you read in the papers is
your own column."
Abby's sister is another advice
columnist, Ann Landers. They are
identical twins. And how! They were
married in the same ceremony and
both started their column the same
month.
What does she think of her sister?
"She's the wittiest person I know.
She's just great. After all, we are
identical." Abby recalls the time Ann
was going to give a speech in Dallas
and Abby wished her luck, saying, "I

hope you lay them in the aisles." Ann
replied, "I've lost my speech. I may
have to."
Money To Charity
I'll bet you're wondering how much
Abby rakes in. Not a cent. All her
earnings go to charities. In fact, there
is even some Abigail Van Buren
research at Stanford.
On acne. On the face of it, that
seems like a pretty superfacial
problem, but Abby says the emotional
scars of acne are often as bad as
physical injury.
Abby was also questioned about
her milk ad. She said she was "a little
ashamed of it and I probably wouldn't
do it again," although she noted the
$25,000 she milked from it went to a
hospital.
CONFIDENTIAL TO WHOEVER IS
STILL READING: Abby doesn't do
many speaking engagements so why
did she come to Stanford? "That Bill
Rivers can really communicate," she
says."I get this letter that says, 'Dear
Abby: I've got a problem. We don't
have dough enough to afford you, but
would you come and see the kids in
our neighborhood?"
"After that," she says,"I decided
I'd come even if I had to pay the car
fare. And I did."
