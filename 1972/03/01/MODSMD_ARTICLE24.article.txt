Prospective Davis Jurors Seated
SAN JOSE — An attractive mother of three who said she
first heard of Angela Davis a few days ago is among the 12
prospective jurors seated for questioning in the black
militant's murder-kidnap trial.
At the end of the second day of jury selection, 12 jury
panel members had been dismissed — including five
college students. Seven men and five women — one a
black — were left in the jury box as the defense and
prosecution probed the background and views of
veniremen and women.
Ruth A. Ruth, a secretary, disclosed under defense
questioning that she had never heard of the
well-publicized Angela Davis trial until last week.
Ruth said she doesn't take any newspapers, never
watches television news and was going through a divorce
at the time of the 1970 Marin County Civic Center
shootout in which the state alleges Davis was involved.
A judge, two convicts and an accomplice were killed in
the incident.
The college students were dismissed after most
indicated the expected length of the trial would interfere
with their education. Both sides have estimated it could
last four to six months.
Questioning by the prosecution yesterday centered
mainly on whether prospective jurors believed Davis'
political philosophy — she is an avowed Communist — was
involved in the trial.
USSR Attacks Nixon China Trip
MOSCOW -- The Soviet Union issued yesterday its first
sharp attack on President Nixon's trip to Peking, accusing
China of "entering a dangerous plot with the ruling circles
of the USA."
An article in the Soviet trade union newspaper "Trud"
dismissed Nixon's journey to China as a publicity stunt to
capture votes in this election year.
'Trud" was the first of the controlled Soviet press to
deviate from a cautious handling of the Nixon trip.

The thrust of the article was to portray Nixon and his
Chinese hosts as conspiring to decide the fate of the North
Vietnamese. The article said Nixon was counting on
Peking for support of his Vietnam policy in return for
certain concessions.
"The whole world condemns the crimes of the
American military' in Indochina but is watching intently
the activities of the Peking ruling circles," "Trud"
asserted.
"They are avoiding anything which would look like a
criticism of the USA. The leaders of China broke all
records during Nixon's visit to ingratiate themselves to the
United States. They tried to create a favorable impression
of themselves in the eyes of those who guide the foreign
policy of the largest imperialist power.
"This they have achieved. But they have also achieved
something else: The entire progressive world, along with
the condemnation of the activities of American
imperialism against the peace and freedom of peoples, also
condemns the Maoists for having entered a dangerous plot
with the ruling circles of the USA."
Irish Militiaman Killed
BELFAST — Hooded gunmen invaded a Northern Ireland
militiaman's home last night and shot him dead in front of
his family, police reported. The shooting followed a day
of bombings in two of Ulster's major cities.
Police said the part-time soldier's 11-year-old daughter
was wounded in the assassination raid.
Explosions in Belfast and Londonderry earlier
destroyed shops, homes and a garage but caused no
casualties. The guerrillas gave the occupants time to get
closer before setting their bomb fuses.
The Ulster defense regiment soldier was shot dead in
his house at Lurgan, County Armagh.
Police said two armed men appeared out of the night
and hammered on the house door. They forced their way
inside and opened fire, cutting down the militiaman.
The soldier was the 252 nd person to die since the fall
of 1969 in Northern Ireland's civil strife. Forty-six people
have been killed over the past two months.
