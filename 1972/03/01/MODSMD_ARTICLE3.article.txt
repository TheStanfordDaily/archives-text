# Diverse Groups Criticize Shockley's Theories

By RICH .JAROSLOVSKY
(First of two parts)
On a faculty that has produced Paul
Baran, E.A. Ross, Paul Ehrlich, and
Bruce Franklin, Dr. William Shockley
is at the moment perhaps the most
controversial member.
He is the Alexander M. Poniatoff
professor of electrical engineering at
Stanford, winner of the 1956 Nobel
Prize for his work in the invention of
the transistor, and currently the
foremost proponent, with Berkeley's
Arthur Jensen, of a theory which
hypothesizes that blacks are
genetically inferior to whites on the
basis of intelligence.
Geneticists have attacked his
theories, groups ranging from 100
members of the American Physical
Society to Stanford's Third World
Liberation Front have denounced his
statements, and his engineering class
has been disrupted by protesters twice
this year. But still he persists, despite
what he terms "a general series of
attacks when I get into this taboo
subject."
What first prompted his interest in
the field of eugenics (the study of
beneficial genetic traits)? Shockley
cites a number of motivations,
including his wartime experiences in
India, requests that he as a Nobel
laureate sign statements on population
control, and his interest in the case of
a mentally deficient black San

Francisco teen-ager, one of 17
children, who hurled acid into the face
of a delicatessen owner several years
ago.
Dysgenics
These led him into the study of
eugenics and its related field, dysgenics
(the increase of harmful traits through
the disproportionate reproduction of
the genetically disadvantaged). "The
more I got into it the more I found
there was an intellectual vacuum," he
says.
Shockley's extensive files of his
involvement in the field go back to
early 1964, when he served on a panel
discussion of "Sex, Science, and
Survival." A University news release
on the discussion, he notes, "was very
predictive of what 1 got into . . . this
was before the hassle."
He quotes himself from the release:
"The very things which are now giving
us our higher standard of living may
have an anti-evolutionary
effect . . . Today our high standard of
living may result simply in the
predominance of people who can
reproduce the most offspring. If this
criterion alone is selected for
determining the future characteristics
of the species, it is extremely likely
that this would have a very adverse
effect."
News Service Coverage
He parenthetically adds that "the
Stanford News Service has, so far as I

know, not issued a press release in
respect to anything I've had to do in
this area since 1968." He notes that
"prior to this time there was a rather
vigorous exchange of letters to the
editor between Bob Beyers {head of
the University News Service] and
myself in the Palo Alto Times."
Beyers, for his part, denies
Shockley's allegations, and points out
that his office just recently released a
story concerning Shockley's article on
eugenics in the January, 1972 issue of
Phi Delta Kappan magazine. He says,
however, that there was a period of
about two years in which no stories
were released.
He admits Shockley has "sent over
quite a few speeches" that have not
been used in press releases, but says
"there have been some difficulties in
getting stories cleared with him."
Shockley's hypothesis on race and
innate intellectual ability has been a
target for many experts in genetics,
even those whose research he utilizes.
For example, Shockley bases an
important part of his theory on hir.
own interpretation of a study
conducted by T.E. Reed on the extent
of white ancestry in the Oakland
Negro population.
Based on Reed's research, Shockley
hypothesized that average IQ's for
low-intelligence blacks increased one
point for every one percent of

Caucasian ancestry.
Theory Not Understood
Shockley says his analysis is "not
understood by the professional
geneticists so far as I know," including
Reed himself, who just published a
paper in the proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences
disputing Shockley's findings.
Comments Shockley, "I believe his
conclusions are in error... I wrote to
him about this; he's never replied with
any details. He now won't accept a
telephone call from me."
He says, however, the fact that
Reed answered his findings at all
"bears directly on Professor Ehriich's
| Dr. Paul Ehrlich, Stanford population
biologist] unwarranted assertion that
Shockley is confused about
undergraduate genetics." Ehrlich had
said in a Daily column that Shockley's
claims are "just 180 degrees off base."
Apple-of-God's-Eye
Shockley attributes much of the
criticism he receives to what he terms
the "Apple-of-God's-Eye Obsession."
"Why do men [of j . . . integrity and
good intentions and scientific ability
take attitudes which prevent doing
research in areas which I think may
add a significant diagnosis to our
profound national sicknesses?" he
asks.
"How can they do this? Are they in
the pay of an inimical enemy power?
But knowing these men as well as I do
in some cases, and having as much
respect for them as I do, I think
they've just got a mental block."
He says his Apple-of-God's-Eye
theory explains this mental block and
"accounts for the fact that I would

regard these people as being honest
and well-intentioned, but unwilling to
accept.. . that nature's laws could be
set up this way.
"Sometimes you hear pieces
coming back. There was a student in
picking up some stuff from our office
yesterday, and I happened to hear
him. He said, 'Well, I'm emotionally
completely opposed to all these ideas,
but I think I'll look at them.' There's
the thing in a nutshell. He's at least
going far enough to look at them.
"So far as taking a competent look,
a serious look on the part of any other
professor at Stanford in this area, I
don't think I can name one."
Debate?
Does this mean he would be willing
to debate his theories with other
faculty members? Shockley says he
feels "Paul Ehrlich has rather set up a
situation in which it is incumbent
upon me to say that I think my
competence in the field of
undergraduate genetics, or graduate, or
research, as the case may be, in
connection with the proposal I have
made for determining the spread of
the racial mix ... is a subject which
some member of the genetics faculty
should debate with me."
Shockley sees the lack of
investigation into his theories as "a
dereliction of intellectual integrity on
the part of science" that is "far more
harmful to mankind than what went
on in the Galileo situation, because
how would anybody do anything
different depending on whether the
sun went around the earth or
vice-versa?"
(Next: student disruptions and
"misinterpretations.")

respect for them as I do, I think
they've just got a mental block."
He says his Apple-of-God's-Eye

"accounts for the fact that I would

regard these people as being honest

the thing in a nutshell. He's at least
going far enough to look at them.

Debate?
Does this mean he would be willing

feels "Paul Ehrlich has rather set up a

research, as the case may be, in

made for determining the spread of
the racial mix ... is a subject which
some member of the genetics faculty
should debate with me."
Shockley sees the lack of
investigation into his theories as "a
dereliction of intellectual integrity on
the part of science" that is "far more
harmful to mankind than what went

By RICH .JAROSLOVSKY
(First of two parts)
On a faculty that has produced Paul
Baran, E.A. Ross, Paul Ehrlich, and
Bruce Franklin, Dr. William Shockley
is at the moment perhaps the most
controversial member.
He is the Alexander M. Poniatoff
professor of electrical engineering at
Stanford, winner of the 1956 Nobel
Prize for his work in the invention of
the transistor, and currently the
foremost proponent, with Berkeley's
Arthur Jensen, of a theory which
hypothesizes that blacks are
genetically inferior to whites on the
basis of intelligence.
Geneticists have attacked his
theories, groups ranging from 100
members of the American Physical
Society to Stanford's Third World
Liberation Front have denounced his
statements, and his engineering class
has been disrupted by protesters twice
this year. But still he persists, despite
what he terms "a general series of
attacks when I get into this taboo
subject."
What first prompted his interest in
the field of eugenics (the study of
beneficial genetic traits)? Shockley
cites a number of motivations,
including his wartime experiences in
India, requests that he as a Nobel
laureate sign statements on population
control, and his interest in the case of
a mentally deficient black San

Francisco teen-ager, one of 17
children, who hurled acid into the face
of a delicatessen owner several years
ago.
Dysgenics
These led him into the study of
eugenics and its related field, dysgenics
(the increase of harmful traits through
the disproportionate reproduction of
the genetically disadvantaged). "The
more I got into it the more I found
there was an intellectual vacuum," he
says.
Shockley's extensive files of his
involvement in the field go back to
early 1964, when he served on a panel
discussion of "Sex, Science, and
Survival." A University news release
on the discussion, he notes, "was very
predictive of what 1 got into . . . this
was before the hassle."
He quotes himself from the release:
"The very things which are now giving
us our higher standard of living may
have an anti-evolutionary
effect . . . Today our high standard of
living may result simply in the
predominance of people who can
reproduce the most offspring. If this
criterion alone is selected for
determining the future characteristics
of the species, it is extremely likely
that this would have a very adverse
effect."
News Service Coverage
He parenthetically adds that "the
Stanford News Service has, so far as I

know, not issued a press release in
respect to anything I've had to do in
this area since 1968." He notes that
"prior to this time there was a rather
vigorous exchange of letters to the
editor between Bob Beyers {head of
the University News Service] and
myself in the Palo Alto Times."
Beyers, for his part, denies
Shockley's allegations, and points out
that his office just recently released a

investigation into his theories as "a

By RICH .JAROSLOVSKY
(First of two parts)
On a faculty that has produced Paul
Baran, E.A. Ross, Paul Ehrlich, and
Bruce Franklin, Dr. William Shockley
is at the moment perhaps the most
controversial member.
He is the Alexander M. Poniatoff
professor of electrical engineering at
Stanford, winner of the 1956 Nobel
Prize for his work in the invention of
the transistor, and currently the
foremost proponent, with Berkeley's
Arthur Jensen, of a theory which
hypothesizes that blacks are
genetically inferior to whites on the
basis of intelligence.
Geneticists have attacked his
theories, groups ranging from 100
members of the American Physical
Society to Stanford's Third World
Liberation Front have denounced his
statements, and his engineering class
has been disrupted by protesters twice
this year. But still he persists, despite
what he terms "a general series of
attacks when I get into this taboo
subject."
What first prompted his interest in
the field of eugenics (the study of
beneficial genetic traits)? Shockley
cites a number of motivations,
including his wartime experiences in
India, requests that he as a Nobel
laureate sign statements on population
control, and his interest in the case of
a mentally deficient black San

Francisco teen-ager, one of 17
children, who hurled acid into the face
of a delicatessen owner several years
ago.
Dysgenics
These led him into the study of
eugenics and its related field, dysgenics
(the increase of harmful traits through
the disproportionate reproduction of
the genetically disadvantaged). "The
more I got into it the more I found
there was an intellectual vacuum," he
says.
Shockley's extensive files of his
involvement in the field go back to
early 1964, when he served on a panel
discussion of "Sex, Science, and
Survival." A University news release
on the discussion, he notes, "was very
predictive of what 1 got into . . . this
was before the hassle."
He quotes himself from the release:
"The very things which are now giving
us our higher standard of living may
have an anti-evolutionary
effect . . . Today our high standard of
living may result simply in the
predominance of people who can
reproduce the most offspring. If this
criterion alone is selected for
determining the future characteristics
of the species, it is extremely likely
that this would have a very adverse
effect."
News Service Coverage
He parenthetically adds that "the
Stanford News Service has, so far as I

know, not issued a press release in
respect to anything I've had to do in
this area since 1968." He notes that
"prior to this time there was a rather
vigorous exchange of letters to the
editor between Bob Beyers {head of
the University News Service] and
myself in the Palo Alto Times."
Beyers, for his part, denies
Shockley's allegations, and points out
that his office just recently released a
story concerning Shockley's article on
eugenics in the January, 1972 issue of
Phi Delta Kappan magazine. He says,
however, that there was a period of
about two years in which no stories
were released.
He admits Shockley has "sent over
quite a few speeches" that have not
been used in press releases, but says
"there have been some difficulties in
getting stories cleared with him."
Shockley's hypothesis on race and
innate intellectual ability has been a
target for many experts in genetics,
even those whose research he utilizes.
For example, Shockley bases an
important part of his theory on hir.
own interpretation of a study
conducted by T.E. Reed on the extent
of white ancestry in the Oakland
Negro population.
Based on Reed's research, Shockley
hypothesized that average IQ's for
low-intelligence blacks increased one
point for every one percent of

Caucasian ancestry.
Theory Not Understood
Shockley says his analysis is "not
understood by the professional
geneticists so far as I know," including
Reed himself, who just published a
paper in the proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences
disputing Shockley's findings.
Comments Shockley, "I believe his
conclusions are in error... I wrote to
him about this; he's never replied with
any details. He now won't accept a
telephone call from me."
He says, however, the fact that
Reed answered his findings at all
"bears directly on Professor Ehriich's
| Dr. Paul Ehrlich, Stanford population
biologist] unwarranted assertion that
Shockley is confused about
undergraduate genetics." Ehrlich had
said in a Daily column that Shockley's
claims are "just 180 degrees off base."
Apple-of-God's-Eye
Shockley attributes much of the
criticism he receives to what he terms
the "Apple-of-God's-Eye Obsession."
"Why do men [of j . . . integrity and
good intentions and scientific ability
take attitudes which prevent doing
research in areas which I think may
add a significant diagnosis to our
profound national sicknesses?" he
asks.
"How can they do this? Are they in
the pay of an inimical enemy power?
But knowing these men as well as I do
in some cases, and having as much
respect for them as I do, I think
they've just got a mental block."
He says his Apple-of-God's-Eye
theory explains this mental block and
"accounts for the fact that I would

regard these people as being honest
and well-intentioned, but unwilling to
accept.. . that nature's laws could be
set up this way.
"Sometimes you hear pieces
coming back. There was a student in
picking up some stuff from our office

completely opposed to all these ideas,
but I think I'll look at them.' There's
