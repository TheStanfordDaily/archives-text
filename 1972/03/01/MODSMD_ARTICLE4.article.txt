# Packard Accepts Honor Amid Angry Protests
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN PHIL REVZIN 
Former Deputy Secretary of
Defense David Packard received the
Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce's
Distinguished Citizen Award last night
at a dinner marked by disruptions
both outside and within the banquet
hall.
About 375 people, chanting and
carrying red flags, demonstrated
outside Rickey's Hyatt House against
Packard and tried unsuccessfully to
present him with a "Mad Bomber of
the Year" award.
Inside, representatives of two peace
groups attempted to read statements
condemning Packard, but were quickly

hustled out.
Packard's speech concentrated on
"anti-American propagandists and hate
mongers."
"If there are mad bombers in this
country, they are probably in front of
Rickey's tonight," he said. He went on
to congratulate the "good men and
women of the Stanford community
for not remaining silent. The
purveyors of evil ideas have been
exposed at the University."
Anti-Military Campaign
Packard also defended the
American military. "The fate of the
ROTC and the recruiting officers on
many of our most prestigious
university campuses, including
Stanford, is one unfortunate result of
this anti-military campaign," he said.
More than 400 people, mostly local
businessmen, attended the $10 a plate,
prime rib dinner honoring Packard.
Representing Stanford and sitting with
Packard at the small head table were
President Richard Lyman and his wife.
The Lymans applauded
occasionally during Packard's speech,
but appeared bored throughout the
speeches and dinner, and rarely spoke
with the Packards. Asked if he was
enjoying the dinner, Lyman replied he
always has mixed feelings about such
occasions.
He had "no comment" on
Packard's speech, but noted "I don't
think that attendance here tonight
constitutes an endorsement of the war
or the country's foreign policy."
Hoot Gibson of the Stanford
Research Institute, who made
introductions throughout the evening,
said "Dave had some remote
connection with Stanford. Dick
Lyman and some others of us had a
session and it was decided that none
other than Fred Terman should speak
on behalf of Stanford."
Former Provost
Terman, a former Provost, noted
"in the early days I was the teacher,
but some 15 or 20 years after I had
him as a student, Dave turned up as
chairman of the board of trustees, and
I still only worked here."
Three awards were presented to
Packard during the evening, and his
accomplishments were listed by several
speakers. The distinguished citizen
award has been presented ten times
since it originated in 1945. It has been
awarded to Herbert Hoover, Wallace
Sterling, and Terman, among others.
The award is based on
qualifications including that the
"Candidate should have been a
resident of Palo Alto-Stan ford, should
have accomplished an unusually
outstanding and meritorious
service . . . and this activity should be
non-commercial in nature and should
represent personal self-sacrifice
without thought of reward."
The recipient is chosen by the
Board of Directors of the Palo Alto
Chamber of Commerce.
Two Disruptions
Two minor disruptions of the
proceedings occurred during the
dinner. In the first, Doug Mattern,
representing the Citizens for Peace in
Southeast Asia, stood up in front of

the lectern and began reading a
statement which began, "by
participating in this award, you are in
effect endorsing events for which
David Packard, as second in command
of the Pentagon, shares heavy
responsibility."
Before he could go any further,
however, plain-clothed police hustled
Mattern and four other demonstrators
out. As he was being forced out he
called on others to leave in protest.
Packard stood up and approached
Mattern as he was speaking, and while
he was being led away, Packard told
him "Let me shake your hand."
The second interruption occurred
after Packard's speech when Cosette
Dudley, a representative of the Peace
Union, stood in front and began
reading a statement recognizing
Packard as "a man who has
distinguished himself in the service of
death."
Cosette received the same
treatment as Dudley in being hustled
out by police. None of these protesters
was arrested.
Palo Alto Police Chief James
Zurcher admitted to having knowledge
in advance that the disruptions would
take place and said he had made plans
to "ask the protestors to leave."
Packard, after the dinner said, "I
think the people who would disrupt
the dinner have a right to express their
views and I think maybe we could
have let them say a little bit more, as
long as somebody does not disrupt the
meeting. Free speech is a very
important liberty in our country, and
anyone has the opportunity to say
what they think, even to call me a mad
bomber if they want to do so."
Protestors March
The 375 protestors who met
outside marched about a block down
El Camino Real to Rickey's at about
6:00 p.m.
The group, chanting "We want
Packard," was met at the entranc ewav
by about 30 riot-equipped Palo Alto
police. The group moved to the south
side of the building, where they briefly
spoke to Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Lieutenant Don Tamm, and Palo Alto
police chief James Zurcher. Jim Shoch
asked Zurcher if a delegation from the
group could go inside to present
Packard their "Mad Bomber of the
Year Award," a rusty, three-foot high
bomb, on a small wagon.
Zurcher told the crowd that
Packard had agreed to meet with a
delegation, "at some time," but did
not specify when.
After about ten minutes, the group
formed a picket line in front of
Rickey's, at times partially blocking
some El Camino traffic, and slowing
car entry into the parking lot.
At about 7:00 p.m. a sprinkler was
activated on the south entrance of the
restaurant, and water poured onto the
sidewalk for several minutes. No
damage was reported.
At about 7:30, 12 officers moved
into El Camino Real to help cars enter
the parking lot. Half an hour later, a
scuffle broke out between an onlooker
and a Cubberley High School
newspaper photographer who
attempted to take the onlooker's
picture.
Two Arrests Made
David Eddelson, 19, was arrested
for assault and battery for the
incident. The juvenile photographer
was arrested for disturbing the peace.
Shortly thereafter, a line of police
moved to the street and the crowd
dispersed across El Camino. Several
rocks were thrown at the police line.
The group marched north on El
Camino, back toward campus, and
decided to break up into small groups
to "take care of business," at
Hewlett-Packard and the Stanford
Electronics labs.
In addition to Palo Alto and Santa
Clara police, officers from Campbell,
San Jose, Mountain View, and the
California Highway Patrol were also
present.
Later last night, fires were set in
dumpsters behind the Law School and
between Sequoia Hall and Hansen
Laboratories. A utility pole at
Mayfield and Junipero Serra was also
set afire.
Windows were broken at the
Faculty Club, Encina Hall, and Hoover
Tower.
A Molotov cocktail was thrown at a
Hewlett-Packard building in Palo Alto,
scorching a planter, but no damage
was reported.
A threat was phoned into KZSU
about 10:00, saying that a bomb
would go off at Hewlett-Packard. No
bomb was found.
