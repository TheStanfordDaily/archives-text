## It's Getting Late 
### 
When the Daily asked groundskeeper Guillermo
De Sou/.a what he thought of the upcoming
elections in which University workers may choose
one of three unions or no union at all, he replied:
"They tell me the union don't let me retire when
I'm 62.1 don't get my money if they have a union."
In some ways, De Souza's comment (which is
completely inaccurate) is quite representative of the
way the six-week campaign for worker votes has
gone; in other ways it is rather atypical.
Fortunately — for everyone involved — the
outright lie hasn't developed into an important
campaign weapon, nor has character assassination.
Except for one shoving incident, there has been no
violence, little mudslinging, and generally we must
congratulate all sides for keeping the election on an
adult level.
But while the unions have made the campaign
pleasant, they have not made it very effective.
Guillermo De Souza has never spoken to a union
representative, and he has a great deal of company
among his fellow workers. Most of them have no
direct contact with the unions, and have to rely on
second-hand information or past impressions.
A significant number of Stanford employees
speak poor English or no English at all, making it
twice as hard to get any reliable information on the
election. Both the Teamsters and the United
Stanford Employees (USE) have several
Spanish-speaking organizers, but it seems that there
haven't been enough. Again, to give credit where
credit is due, USE is the only union to print most of
its campaign material in both Spanish and English.
Still, the workers need to get more than just the
USE line on the election — and a great many of
them haven't been able to.
These many obstacles to communication have
fostered an environment ideal for breeding

half-truths, misinformation, and outright lies, and
that is what we have, in most instances. A majority
of workers will go to the polls uninformed or
misinformed on March 7.
Unfortunately, the unions have, to a certain
extent, taken advantage of this fact. While all three
unions have held open meetings where employees
could ask questions about specific benefits, the
issues the three groups have chosen to make the
most of are really among the least important. The
question of which union could carry out a more
effective strike, for instance, is something that
should be considered, but it is not the whole
question, as the Teamsters have tried to make it.
The best union is one that can accomplish its goals
without the strike. The strike is a last resort, not an
everyday bargaining tool.
Similarly, all three unions have claimed that at
least one competitor is not a valid union. That
proposition is simply untrue as the NLRB proved by
placing these unions on the ballot.
The height of this absurdity came when
CSEA-SEA refused to debate the other two unions.
Executive Mike Fineo told the Daily his union
wouldn't debate because it didn't want to "dignify"
the positions of the other two organizations.
CSEA-SEA, by refusing to debate, did the workers a
great wrong.
It is late in the campaign now; probably, it is too
late to salvage much of what it lost. But we urge the
unions, in the last week of the campaign, to make a
concerted effort to reach all workers, regardless of
what language they speak. We urge them to take
advantage of a standing offer of air time from KZSU
and hold a debate. We urge them to make specific
benefits the issue, rather than relative strength. To
do anything less is a crime against the very workers
the unions purport to represent.

congratulate all sides for keeping the election on an
adult level.
But while the unions have made the campaign
pleasant, they have not made it very effective.
Guillermo De Souza has never spoken to a union
representative, and he has a great deal of company
among his fellow workers. Most of them have no
direct contact with the unions, and have to rely on
second-hand information or past impressions.
A significant number of Stanford employees
speak poor English or no English at all, making it
twice as hard to get any reliable information on the
election. Both the Teamsters and the United
Stanford Employees (USE) have several
Spanish-speaking organizers, but it seems that there
haven't been enough. Again, to give credit where
credit is due, USE is the only union to print most of
its campaign material in both Spanish and English.
Still, the workers need to get more than just the
USE line on the election — and a great many of
them haven't been able to.
These many obstacles to communication have
fostered an environment ideal for breeding

half-truths, misinformation, and outright lies, and
that is what we have, in most instances. A majority
of workers will go to the polls uninformed or
misinformed on March 7.
Unfortunately, the unions have, to a certain
extent, taken advantage of this fact. While all three
unions have held open meetings where employees
could ask questions about specific benefits, the
issues the three groups have chosen to make the
most of are really among the least important. The
question of which union could carry out a more
effective strike, for instance, is something that
should be considered, but it is not the whole
question, as the Teamsters have tried to make it.
The best union is one that can accomplish its goals
without the strike. The strike is a last resort, not an
everyday bargaining tool.
Similarly, all three unions have claimed that at
least one competitor is not a valid union. That
proposition is simply untrue as the NLRB proved by
placing these unions on the ballot.
The height of this absurdity came when
CSEA-SEA refused to debate the other two unions.
Executive Mike Fineo told the Daily his union
wouldn't debate because it didn't want to "dignify"
the positions of the other two organizations.
CSEA-SEA, by refusing to debate, did the workers a
great wrong.
It is late in the campaign now; probably, it is too
late to salvage much of what it lost. But we urge the
unions, in the last week of the campaign, to make a
concerted effort to reach all workers, regardless of
what language they speak. We urge them to take
advantage of a standing offer of air time from KZSU
and hold a debate. We urge them to make specific
benefits the issue, rather than relative strength. To
do anything less is a crime against the very workers
the unions purport to represent.
When the Daily asked groundskeeper Guillermo
De Sou/.a what he thought of the upcoming
elections in which University workers may choose
one of three unions or no union at all, he replied:
"They tell me the union don't let me retire when
I'm 62.1 don't get my money if they have a union."
In some ways, De Souza's comment (which is
completely inaccurate) is quite representative of the
way the six-week campaign for worker votes has
gone; in other ways it is rather atypical.
Fortunately — for everyone involved — the
outright lie hasn't developed into an important
campaign weapon, nor has character assassination.
Except for one shoving incident, there has been no
violence, little mudslinging, and generally we must
congratulate all sides for keeping the election on an
adult level.
