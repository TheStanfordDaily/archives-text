## What Is Trial By Jury? 
### 
When we take stock of the institutionalized arbitrary behavior
which is rampant in the courtrooms of this country today we are
discouraged by the actions we see being taken in the name of justice.
We think it pertinent to ask ourselves some basic questions about the
trial by jury: what were the condtions of the relationship between the
people and the government which necessitated its existence originally?
What kinds of relationships between the jurors, judges, plaintiffs,
defendants, and population at large are generated by the trial by jury?
If we can pose answers to these questions, we should be better able to
determine what the characteristics of a trial by jury are and what they
are not. We have reason to believe that some of the most crucial
elements of the relationship are absent from the courtroom
proceedings in this country today — and that, therefore, trial by jury
does not exist in our juridicial practice.
Long before the Magna Carta, a system of rendering decisions in
disputes was operant in ancient Britain. It was called trial per pais,
according to Lysander Spooner, an American Civil War jurist who
made a substantial study of the American and British legal systems.
The trial per pais was the original "check and balance," as it called the
citizens of the countryside to either overrule or support the
governmental laws. The members of the jury were randomly selected
from among the citizenry, and made decisions relative to the case
based on their own conscience. They were the sole judges, and the
administration of justice was their responsibility, to be done according
to each man's personal idea of justice. This practice kept the king
from becoming a despot, as the "country" had the final say as to
whether his laws were just.
People's Role
William Blackstone, the eighteenth century English jurist who is,
even today, considered the dean of legal exegesis in the Anglo-Saxon
world, saw the people, through their participation in the jury, as the
ultimate guardians of individual liberty. As long as the government
could not, even for one day, enforce its own laws without appealing
to a tribunal which fairly represented the people for its consent, the
government could not be absolute and would have to remain
responsible to the people for every action it should take. Thus

Spooner says that to ensure the legal preservation of liberty there
must be a "legal right to resist the oppression of the government."
This requires the existence of a legal tribunal, "wholly independent
of, and above the government, to judge between the government and
those who resist its oppressions. . . ." (Trial by Jury, 1852) Trial by a
legitimate jury (that is, one whose members have been selected from
among the entire populace) would also protect the rights of the
various political minorities in the country, as juries should be able to
rule on legislation, which has been conceived by the representatives of
the majority of the people.
Some will no doubt be outraged at the idea that twelve ignorant
men and women should render judgment of the law while the judge,
learned in matters of law sits on his hands. Yet it seems obvious that a
judgment by twleve men would be more impartial than a judgment by
one man, no matter how learned. Moreover, in the trial by jury we are
not necessarily dispensing entirely with our justices. We are merely
eliminating the possibility that a judge might find it in his own best
interest, as a member of the governmental family, to decide in favor
of an existing law, or that he might find it more lucrative to decide in
favor of one particular party to a suit. We are still retaining our
justices for purposes of explaining the law to the jury and advising
them on issues with which they are unfamiliar. The judges now
become referees, rather than loci of decision-making power.
Perhaps some individuals are unconvinced that in order to insure
justice in such a social formation as ours, in which the government
ostensibly represents the people, it is necessary to make the
government subservient to the jury. But haven't we enough evidence
by now that no change in the power which the government reserves
for itself (in order to govern us most efficiently) may come at all
through our participation in discussions or suffrage? The potential
power of the president or the legislator or the governor to prescribe
limitations on our behavior remains the same, irrespective of whom
the majority assigns to the particular job. It is vital to the preservation
of our liberty that we have recourse to a process capable of reversing
the decisions of the government.
Examine Roles
We now have some idea of how the need for trial by jury arose, and
what its function, theoretically and historically, has been. It remains
for us to examine the roles of the various participants in the operation
and the ways in which they affect one another.
In order to guarantee that a person will receive a fair hearing, it is
mandatory that jurors potentially represent all the social and political
persuasions found among the populace. Limiting juror selection to
persons registered to vote is as unjust as is requiring that one own
property. Even anti-government elements of the society have a right
to representation, as a defendant (or plaintiff) might himself be of
such persuasion, or, in the particular case in question, might oppose a
governmental statute as being unjust.
In the same way, jury members are not inextricably bound to the
civil law; the government may not require them to uphold existing
law. Spooner sees the jurisdiction of juries in every case as four-fold.
The members of the jury must determine whether the law is being
correctly expounded to them by the court; if the statute which the
defendant is accused of having transgressed is really a law; what the
laws of evidence are (so to prevent the government from arbitrarily
determining what information may be allowed and what may not);
and whether the law is just. We concur in his assessment that there is
no trial by jury where the jurors are under oath to try the case within
the context of positive law. This is the difference between trial by
jury and trial by government.
Crucial
It is crucial that a jury be thus empowered. What other defense is
guaranteed an individual who has acted in violation of an existing law
because he or she finds it intolerably oppressive?
We are reminded of the case of John Peter Zenger, an eighteenth
century colonial journalist, who was prosecuted by the government of
the colony of New York for publishing articles in his newspaper which
were critical of Governor Cosby's Administration. The charge was
seditious libel.
Zenger's counsel saw two issues to the case: freedom of the press,
and freedom to criticize the government. One of the reasons for
Zenger's subsequent acquittal was that his charges against the
government had basis in fact: he had published "true libel."
More instrumental in the rendering of the decision, however, was
the fact that the jury judged this case according to their own
consciences, not according to the directions of the Chief Justice, Mr.
De Lancey.
Counsellor Hamilton first acknowledged that Zenger had been the
party responsible for the allegedly seditious articles. He next argued
that because his client's criticism had been truthful, he ought to be
acquitted. DeLancey ruled against him on points of law. Hamilton
then appeal to the jury, over DeLancey's head. It sided with him, and
his argument, first supported by public opinion, was eventually
supported in positive law itself.

such persuasion, or, in the particular case in question, might oppose a
governmental statute as being unjust.
In the same way, jury members are not inextricably bound to the
civil law; the government may not require them to uphold existing
law. Spooner sees the jurisdiction of juries in every case as four-fold.
The members of the jury must determine whether the law is being
correctly expounded to them by the court; if the statute which the
defendant is accused of having transgressed is really a law; what the
laws of evidence are (so to prevent the government from arbitrarily
determining what information may be allowed and what may not);
and whether the law is just. We concur in his assessment that there is
no trial by jury where the jurors are under oath to try the case within
the context of positive law. This is the difference between trial by
jury and trial by government.
Crucial
It is crucial that a jury be thus empowered. What other defense is
guaranteed an individual who has acted in violation of an existing law
because he or she finds it intolerably oppressive?
We are reminded of the case of John Peter Zenger, an eighteenth
century colonial journalist, who was prosecuted by the government of
the colony of New York for publishing articles in his newspaper which
were critical of Governor Cosby's Administration. The charge was
seditious libel.
Zenger's counsel saw two issues to the case: freedom of the press,
and freedom to criticize the government. One of the reasons for
Zenger's subsequent acquittal was that his charges against the
government had basis in fact: he had published "true libel."
More instrumental in the rendering of the decision, however, was
the fact that the jury judged this case according to their own
consciences, not according to the directions of the Chief Justice, Mr.
De Lancey.
Counsellor Hamilton first acknowledged that Zenger had been the
party responsible for the allegedly seditious articles. He next argued
that because his client's criticism had been truthful, he ought to be
acquitted. DeLancey ruled against him on points of law. Hamilton
then appeal to the jury, over DeLancey's head. It sided with him, and
his argument, first supported by public opinion, was eventually
supported in positive law itself.

When we take stock of the institutionalized arbitrary behavior
which is rampant in the courtrooms of this country today we are
discouraged by the actions we see being taken in the name of justice.
We think it pertinent to ask ourselves some basic questions about the
trial by jury: what were the condtions of the relationship between the
people and the government which necessitated its existence originally?
What kinds of relationships between the jurors, judges, plaintiffs,
defendants, and population at large are generated by the trial by jury?
If we can pose answers to these questions, we should be better able to
determine what the characteristics of a trial by jury are and what they
are not. We have reason to believe that some of the most crucial
elements of the relationship are absent from the courtroom
proceedings in this country today — and that, therefore, trial by jury
does not exist in our juridicial practice.
Long before the Magna Carta, a system of rendering decisions in
disputes was operant in ancient Britain. It was called trial per pais,
according to Lysander Spooner, an American Civil War jurist who
made a substantial study of the American and British legal systems.
The trial per pais was the original "check and balance," as it called the
citizens of the countryside to either overrule or support the
governmental laws. The members of the jury were randomly selected
from among the citizenry, and made decisions relative to the case
based on their own conscience. They were the sole judges, and the
administration of justice was their responsibility, to be done according
to each man's personal idea of justice. This practice kept the king
from becoming a despot, as the "country" had the final say as to
whether his laws were just.
People's Role
William Blackstone, the eighteenth century English jurist who is,
even today, considered the dean of legal exegesis in the Anglo-Saxon
world, saw the people, through their participation in the jury, as the
ultimate guardians of individual liberty. As long as the government
could not, even for one day, enforce its own laws without appealing
to a tribunal which fairly represented the people for its consent, the
government could not be absolute and would have to remain
responsible to the people for every action it should take. Thus

marcy kahn

Spooner says that to ensure the legal preservation of liberty there
must be a "legal right to resist the oppression of the government."
This requires the existence of a legal tribunal, "wholly independent
of, and above the government, to judge between the government and
those who resist its oppressions. . . ." (Trial by Jury, 1852) Trial by a
legitimate jury (that is, one whose members have been selected from
among the entire populace) would also protect the rights of the
various political minorities in the country, as juries should be able to
rule on legislation, which has been conceived by the representatives of
the majority of the people.
Some will no doubt be outraged at the idea that twelve ignorant
men and women should render judgment of the law while the judge,
learned in matters of law sits on his hands. Yet it seems obvious that a
judgment by twleve men would be more impartial than a judgment by
one man, no matter how learned. Moreover, in the trial by jury we are
not necessarily dispensing entirely with our justices. We are merely
eliminating the possibility that a judge might find it in his own best
interest, as a member of the governmental family, to decide in favor
of an existing law, or that he might find it more lucrative to decide in
favor of one particular party to a suit. We are still retaining our
justices for purposes of explaining the law to the jury and advising
them on issues with which they are unfamiliar. The judges now
become referees, rather than loci of decision-making power.
Perhaps some individuals are unconvinced that in order to insure
justice in such a social formation as ours, in which the government
ostensibly represents the people, it is necessary to make the
government subservient to the jury. But haven't we enough evidence
by now that no change in the power which the government reserves
for itself (in order to govern us most efficiently) may come at all
through our participation in discussions or suffrage? The potential
power of the president or the legislator or the governor to prescribe
limitations on our behavior remains the same, irrespective of whom
the majority assigns to the particular job. It is vital to the preservation
of our liberty that we have recourse to a process capable of reversing
the decisions of the government.
Examine Roles
We now have some idea of how the need for trial by jury arose, and
what its function, theoretically and historically, has been. It remains
for us to examine the roles of the various participants in the operation
and the ways in which they affect one another.
In order to guarantee that a person will receive a fair hearing, it is
mandatory that jurors potentially represent all the social and political
persuasions found among the populace. Limiting juror selection to
persons registered to vote is as unjust as is requiring that one own
property. Even anti-government elements of the society have a right
to representation, as a defendant (or plaintiff) might himself be of
such persuasion, or, in the particular case in question, might oppose a
governmental statute as being unjust.

various political minorities in the country, as juries should be able to
rule on legislation, which has been conceived by the representatives of
the majority of the people.
Some will no doubt be outraged at the idea that twelve ignorant
men and women should render judgment of the law while the judge,
learned in matters of law sits on his hands. Yet it seems obvious that a
judgment by twleve men would be more impartial than a judgment by
one man, no matter how learned. Moreover, in the trial by jury we are
not necessarily dispensing entirely with our justices. We are merely
eliminating the possibility that a judge might find it in his own best
interest, as a member of the governmental family, to decide in favor
of an existing law, or that he might find it more lucrative to decide in
favor of one particular party to a suit. We are still retaining our
justices for purposes of explaining the law to the jury and advising
them on issues with which they are unfamiliar. The judges now
become referees, rather than loci of decision-making power.
Perhaps some individuals are unconvinced that in order to insure
justice in such a social formation as ours, in which the government
ostensibly represents the people, it is necessary to make the
government subservient to the jury. But haven't we enough evidence
by now that no change in the power which the government reserves
for itself (in order to govern us most efficiently) may come at all
through our participation in discussions or suffrage? The potential
power of the president or the legislator or the governor to prescribe
limitations on our behavior remains the same, irrespective of whom
the majority assigns to the particular job. It is vital to the preservation
of our liberty that we have recourse to a process capable of reversing
the decisions of the government.
Examine Roles
We now have some idea of how the need for trial by jury arose, and
what its function, theoretically and historically, has been. It remains
for us to examine the roles of the various participants in the operation
and the ways in which they affect one another.
In order to guarantee that a person will receive a fair hearing, it is
mandatory that jurors potentially represent all the social and political
persuasions found among the populace. Limiting juror selection to
persons registered to vote is as unjust as is requiring that one own
property. Even anti-government elements of the society have a right
to representation, as a defendant (or plaintiff) might himself be of
such persuasion, or, in the particular case in question, might oppose a
governmental statute as being unjust.
In the same way, jury members are not inextricably bound to the
civil law; the government may not require them to uphold existing
law. Spooner sees the jurisdiction of juries in every case as four-fold.
The members of the jury must determine whether the law is being
correctly expounded to them by the court; if the statute which the
defendant is accused of having transgressed is really a law; what the
laws of evidence are (so to prevent the government from arbitrarily
determining what information may be allowed and what may not);
and whether the law is just. We concur in his assessment that there is
no trial by jury where the jurors are under oath to try the case within
the context of positive law. This is the difference between trial by
jury and trial by government.
Crucial
It is crucial that a jury be thus empowered. What other defense is
guaranteed an individual who has acted in violation of an existing law
because he or she finds it intolerably oppressive?
We are reminded of the case of John Peter Zenger, an eighteenth
century colonial journalist, who was prosecuted by the government of
the colony of New York for publishing articles in his newspaper which
were critical of Governor Cosby's Administration. The charge was
seditious libel.
Zenger's counsel saw two issues to the case: freedom of the press,
and freedom to criticize the government. One of the reasons for
Zenger's subsequent acquittal was that his charges against the
government had basis in fact: he had published "true libel."
More instrumental in the rendering of the decision, however, was
the fact that the jury judged this case according to their own
consciences, not according to the directions of the Chief Justice, Mr.
De Lancey.
Counsellor Hamilton first acknowledged that Zenger had been the
party responsible for the allegedly seditious articles. He next argued
that because his client's criticism had been truthful, he ought to be
acquitted. DeLancey ruled against him on points of law. Hamilton
then appeal to the jury, over DeLancey's head. It sided with him, and
his argument, first supported by public opinion, was eventually
supported in positive law itself.

When we take stock of the institutionalized arbitrary behavior
which is rampant in the courtrooms of this country today we are
discouraged by the actions we see being taken in the name of justice.
We think it pertinent to ask ourselves some basic questions about the
trial by jury: what were the condtions of the relationship between the
people and the government which necessitated its existence originally?
What kinds of relationships between the jurors, judges, plaintiffs,
defendants, and population at large are generated by the trial by jury?
If we can pose answers to these questions, we should be better able to
determine what the characteristics of a trial by jury are and what they
are not. We have reason to believe that some of the most crucial
elements of the relationship are absent from the courtroom
proceedings in this country today — and that, therefore, trial by jury
does not exist in our juridicial practice.
Long before the Magna Carta, a system of rendering decisions in
disputes was operant in ancient Britain. It was called trial per pais,
according to Lysander Spooner, an American Civil War jurist who
made a substantial study of the American and British legal systems.
The trial per pais was the original "check and balance," as it called the
citizens of the countryside to either overrule or support the
governmental laws. The members of the jury were randomly selected
from among the citizenry, and made decisions relative to the case
based on their own conscience. They were the sole judges, and the
administration of justice was their responsibility, to be done according
to each man's personal idea of justice. This practice kept the king
from becoming a despot, as the "country" had the final say as to
whether his laws were just.
People's Role
William Blackstone, the eighteenth century English jurist who is,
even today, considered the dean of legal exegesis in the Anglo-Saxon
world, saw the people, through their participation in the jury, as the
ultimate guardians of individual liberty. As long as the government
could not, even for one day, enforce its own laws without appealing
to a tribunal which fairly represented the people for its consent, the
government could not be absolute and would have to remain
responsible to the people for every action it should take. Thus

Spooner says that to ensure the legal preservation of liberty there
must be a "legal right to resist the oppression of the government."
This requires the existence of a legal tribunal, "wholly independent
of, and above the government, to judge between the government and
those who resist its oppressions. . . ." (Trial by Jury, 1852) Trial by a
legitimate jury (that is, one whose members have been selected from
