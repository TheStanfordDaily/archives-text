Editor, THE DAILY:
When the Daily published on
February 22 my THREE MORAL
POSTULATES:' TRUTH -
CONCERN - DEATH, no
mention was made of relevant
facts of the history of its prior
non-publication by the Daily.
Furthermore, the Daily's
heading replaced my word
"truth" by the word "life" — a
substitution reflecting the
consensus in academia nowadays
that "truth", together with
"liberty" and "honor", is trivial
compared to "life". Indeed, it was
on this aspect that I focussed my
remarks when interviewed
immediately after the disruption
of my class in Solid State theory
on January 18 by Miss Theresa
Ramirez, who introduced herself
as managing editor of the Daily
and the reporter assigned to the
story. She told me that notice of
an incident, of unspecified
character, had been received by
the Daily many hours in advance.
In responding to reporter
Ramirez' questions about the
disruption of my class I said:
"I think this is a symptom of a
lack of intellectual integrity and
objectivity at the highest
intellectual levels of the nation. I
think college students now have a
right to be disillusioned by the
lip-service given to the power of
thought and the failure of our
intellectual leaders to honor the
spirit of scientific inquiry in the
human-quality problems of our
nation, specifically those of urban
decay and the tragic disadvantages
of our black minority.
"I come to the conclusion that
the moral responsibilities of
intellectuals are not being lived up
to. I have endeavored to put these
moral obligations to think in
written form in a Letter-to-the-
Editor in Presbyterian Life in
response to an attack in their
columns comparing me to Hitler.
"I believe that this response of
mine is the best statement that I
can make at the present time and
it is submitted herewith for
publication in the Daily."
Only after several telephone
calls to the Daily failed to
provoke publication of my
interview with Daily reporter
Ramirez, did I decide to present
my position by publishing as an
advertisement the quotations
from my KAPPAN article. By
omitting these facts when
publishing my THREE MORAL
POSTULATES, the Daily has

once again failed to publish
relevant truth.
The Daily omitted the last
sentence from my paragraph on
the DEATH POSTULATE: "What
better goal for an agnostic?" This
sentence conveys my belief that
the POSTULATES apply broadly
enough to include, for example,
Unitarians.
W. Shockley
Professor of Electrical Engineering
Editor, THE DAILY:
We are writing on behalf of the
"Sumposium", the group of
students who organized the
Imperialism conference that was
held here last week. In Bob
Litterman's news commentary,
"Study of Imperialism
Legitimized", published in the
Monday, Feb. 28, issue of the
Daily, it was erroneous that only
three graduate students organized
it. In fact, a large number of men
and women organized the event
and worked on a variety of tasks
since last May.
We would like to thank all of
those people who generously
volunteered their time and effort
for this educational program,
accomplished with a very small
budget, as well as the SWOPSI
staff for their very helpful
encouragement and support.
Bill Behn
The Symposium
Editor, THE DAILY:
The woman's Physical
Education Department at
Stanford, has in, my opinion,
placed its priorities exactly where
they should be; that is in providng
ample opportunity for all women
students to learn and practice
tennis, golf, swimming and other
sports in a nonthreatening
environment. I would be very
saddened to see a change in the
direction proposed by the articles
in last weeks Daily, especially if
the change were made at the
expense of the less than star
atheletes who are currently
engaged in physical education
courses for pleasure.
Anne Morton
Grad student,
Psych studies in Education
Editor, THE DAILY:
Once again President Lyman
has told the Faculty Senate that
negotiating for a job with a war
recruiter should be a matter of

personal choice, and once again,
apparently, no one demurred.
If putting together
fragmentation bombs for Martin
Marietta, or dropping them for
the Navy air force, should be left
up to individual preference on this
campus, let us consider the
following situation: Two members
of the Stanford community are
strolling past the home of a
colleague, late at night. They see a
figure crouched under a bedroom
window, pouring gasoline into a
bottle and inserting a wick. At
this point, should one observer
say to the other, "Well, that
fellow seems to be making an
unfortunate moral choice —
someone really ought to persuade
him to do otherwise?"
Most of us would urge more
immediate action. It's true that
the observers might not be able to
stop the culprit from making and
throwing his fire bomb, but surely
they ought to try. In any case
they should not offer to hold the
flashlight for him while he goes
about his business. ("Now we can
all get down to business again,"
said the representative of
McDonnell-Douglas after the
Placement Center was cleared last
Thursday.)
Banning war recruiters from
the Placement Center will not end
the making and dropping of
bombs, but it is surely a step in
that direction. And at the very
least, by imposing such a ban
Stanford would no longer be in
the position of holding the
flashlight while killers go about
their business.
Rachelle Marshall
Editor, THE DAILY:
I've been disappointed that the
Daily has given so little coverage
to the Nixon visit to China. Some
people cynically see the trip as a
propaganda ploy for both nations,
but below the show, something
very good is going on.
Historically Americans have
sympathized with the Chinese
people, and this friendship-at-a
distance was encouraged by our
support for them against the
Japanese in World War 11. So
where has all this hate and
suspicion come from in the past
twenty years? Much of it is
obviously ideological, but the fear
that led to our illusions of
"yellow peril" wasn't simply
anti-communist hate or innate
racism. What we call the "bamboo

curtain" has been a wall of silence
and myth.
The media in the last few days
have shown China to America and
in many ways have smashed our
myths. Despite any lingering
disagreements over Taiwan and
Vietnam, Nixon and Mao actually
shook hands, and, empty as this
symbol may seem, it will hit our
country with a great impact. The
fear that pushed us clumsily into
Vietnam was the very fear that
Nixon has been verbally dispelling
this week. When the American
President works at eliminating this
fear, he is getting at the real root
of our battle in Vietnam, and this
should give us a better sign of
peace than any massive troop
disengagement. We can always
bring back the groops, but the
mystical fear of the Chinese is
dead.
We can talk loosely of
destroying or "nuking" a race we
do not know as if they were ants,
but once we see them as we saw
Chou En Lai on television — in
the flesh, a very real, astute
human being — we ought to
swallow our racism with
embarrassment.
If the Chinese people
themselves can learn from this
small expedition what Americans
are learning, the communication

will be complete. The possibilities
of friendship with China only
make you wonder how long our
war in Vietnam would last if
Nixon were to visit Hanoi on the
evening news in living color.

POSTULATES:' TRUTH -

mention was made of relevant
facts of the history of its prior
non-publication by the Daily.
Furthermore, the Daily's
heading replaced my word
"truth" by the word "life" — a
substitution reflecting the
consensus in academia nowadays
that "truth", together with
"liberty" and "honor", is trivial
compared to "life". Indeed, it was
on this aspect that I focussed my
remarks when interviewed
immediately after the disruption
of my class in Solid State theory
on January 18 by Miss Theresa
Ramirez, who introduced herself
as managing editor of the Daily
and the reporter assigned to the
story. She told me that notice of
an incident, of unspecified
character, had been received by
the Daily many hours in advance.
In responding to reporter
Ramirez' questions about the
disruption of my class I said:
"I think this is a symptom of a
lack of intellectual integrity and

personal choice, and once again,
apparently, no one demurred.
If putting together
fragmentation bombs for Martin
Marietta, or dropping them for
the Navy air force, should be left
up to individual preference on this
campus, let us consider the
following situation: Two members
of the Stanford community are
strolling past the home of a
colleague, late at night. They see a
figure crouched under a bedroom
window, pouring gasoline into a
bottle and inserting a wick. At
this point, should one observer
say to the other, "Well, that
fellow seems to be making an
unfortunate moral choice —
someone really ought to persuade
him to do otherwise?"
Most of us would urge more
immediate action. It's true that
the observers might not be able to
stop the culprit from making and
throwing his fire bomb, but surely
they ought to try. In any case
they should not offer to hold the
flashlight for him while he goes

Rachelle Marshall

I've been disappointed that the
Daily has given so little coverage
to the Nixon visit to China. Some
people cynically see the trip as a
propaganda ploy for both nations,
but below the show, something
very good is going on.
Historically Americans have
sympathized with the Chinese
people, and this friendship-at-a
distance was encouraged by our
support for them against the
Japanese in World War 11. So
where has all this hate and
suspicion come from in the past
twenty years? Much of it is
obviously ideological, but the fear
that led to our illusions of
"yellow peril" wasn't simply
anti-communist hate or innate
racism. What we call the "bamboo

curtain" has been a wall of silence
and myth.
The media in the last few days
have shown China to America and
in many ways have smashed our
myths. Despite any lingering
disagreements over Taiwan and
Vietnam, Nixon and Mao actually
shook hands, and, empty as this
symbol may seem, it will hit our
country with a great impact. The
fear that pushed us clumsily into
Vietnam was the very fear that
Nixon has been verbally dispelling
this week. When the American
President works at eliminating this
fear, he is getting at the real root
of our battle in Vietnam, and this
should give us a better sign of
peace than any massive troop
disengagement. We can always
bring back the groops, but the
mystical fear of the Chinese is
dead.
We can talk loosely of

I've been disappointed that the
Daily has given so little coverage
to the Nixon visit to China. Some
people cynically see the trip as a
propaganda ploy for both nations,
but below the show, something
very good is going on.
Historically Americans have
sympathized with the Chinese
people, and this friendship-at-a
distance was encouraged by our
support for them against the
Japanese in World War 11. So
where has all this hate and
suspicion come from in the past
twenty years? Much of it is
obviously ideological, but the fear
that led to our illusions of
"yellow peril" wasn't simply
anti-communist hate or innate
racism. What we call the "bamboo

curtain" has been a wall of silence
and myth.
The media in the last few days
have shown China to America and
in many ways have smashed our
myths. Despite any lingering
disagreements over Taiwan and
Vietnam, Nixon and Mao actually
shook hands, and, empty as this
symbol may seem, it will hit our
country with a great impact. The
fear that pushed us clumsily into
Vietnam was the very fear that
Nixon has been verbally dispelling
this week. When the American
President works at eliminating this
fear, he is getting at the real root
of our battle in Vietnam, and this
should give us a better sign of
peace than any massive troop
disengagement. We can always
bring back the groops, but the
mystical fear of the Chinese is
dead.
We can talk loosely of
destroying or "nuking" a race we
do not know as if they were ants,
but once we see them as we saw
Chou En Lai on television — in
the flesh, a very real, astute
human being — we ought to
swallow our racism with
embarrassment.
If the Chinese people
themselves can learn from this
small expedition what Americans
are learning, the communication

will be complete. The possibilities
of friendship with China only
make you wonder how long our
war in Vietnam would last if
Nixon were to visit Hanoi on the

Furthermore, the Daily's
heading replaced my word
"truth" by the word "life" — a
substitution reflecting the

that "truth", together with
"liberty" and "honor", is trivial

Once again President Lyman
has told the Faculty Senate that
negotiating for a job with a war
recruiter should be a matter of

personal choice, and once again,
apparently, no one demurred.
If putting together
fragmentation bombs for Martin
Marietta, or dropping them for
the Navy air force, should be left
up to individual preference on this
campus, let us consider the
following situation: Two members
of the Stanford community are
strolling past the home of a
colleague, late at night. They see a
figure crouched under a bedroom
window, pouring gasoline into a
bottle and inserting a wick. At
this point, should one observer
say to the other, "Well, that
fellow seems to be making an
unfortunate moral choice —
someone really ought to persuade
him to do otherwise?"
Most of us would urge more
immediate action. It's true that
the observers might not be able to
stop the culprit from making and
throwing his fire bomb, but surely
they ought to try. In any case
they should not offer to hold the
flashlight for him while he goes
about his business. ("Now we can
all get down to business again,"
said the representative of

Banning war recruiters from

Once again President Lyman
has told the Faculty Senate that
negotiating for a job with a war
recruiter should be a matter of

personal choice, and once again,
apparently, no one demurred.
If putting together
fragmentation bombs for Martin
Marietta, or dropping them for
the Navy air force, should be left
up to individual preference on this
campus, let us consider the
following situation: Two members
of the Stanford community are
strolling past the home of a
colleague, late at night. They see a
figure crouched under a bedroom
window, pouring gasoline into a
bottle and inserting a wick. At
this point, should one observer
say to the other, "Well, that
fellow seems to be making an
unfortunate moral choice —
someone really ought to persuade
him to do otherwise?"
Most of us would urge more
immediate action. It's true that
the observers might not be able to
stop the culprit from making and
throwing his fire bomb, but surely
they ought to try. In any case
they should not offer to hold the
flashlight for him while he goes
about his business. ("Now we can
all get down to business again,"
said the representative of
McDonnell-Douglas after the
Placement Center was cleared last
Thursday.)
Banning war recruiters from
the Placement Center will not end
the making and dropping of
bombs, but it is surely a step in
that direction. And at the very
least, by imposing such a ban
Stanford would no longer be in
the position of holding the
flashlight while killers go about
their business.

I've been disappointed that the
Daily has given so little coverage
to the Nixon visit to China. Some
people cynically see the trip as a
propaganda ploy for both nations,
but below the show, something
very good is going on.
Historically Americans have
sympathized with the Chinese
people, and this friendship-at-a
distance was encouraged by our
support for them against the
Japanese in World War 11. So
where has all this hate and
suspicion come from in the past
twenty years? Much of it is
obviously ideological, but the fear
that led to our illusions of
"yellow peril" wasn't simply
anti-communist hate or innate
racism. What we call the "bamboo

curtain" has been a wall of silence
and myth.
The media in the last few days
have shown China to America and
in many ways have smashed our
myths. Despite any lingering
disagreements over Taiwan and
Vietnam, Nixon and Mao actually
shook hands, and, empty as this
symbol may seem, it will hit our
country with a great impact. The
fear that pushed us clumsily into
Vietnam was the very fear that
Nixon has been verbally dispelling
this week. When the American
President works at eliminating this
fear, he is getting at the real root
of our battle in Vietnam, and this
should give us a better sign of
peace than any massive troop
disengagement. We can always
bring back the groops, but the
mystical fear of the Chinese is
dead.
We can talk loosely of
destroying or "nuking" a race we
do not know as if they were ants,
but once we see them as we saw
Chou En Lai on television — in
the flesh, a very real, astute
human being — we ought to
swallow our racism with
embarrassment.
If the Chinese people
themselves can learn from this
small expedition what Americans
are learning, the communication

will be complete. The possibilities
of friendship with China only
make you wonder how long our
war in Vietnam would last if
Nixon were to visit Hanoi on the
evening news in living color.

Editor, THE DAILY:
When the Daily published on
February 22 my THREE MORAL
POSTULATES:' TRUTH -
CONCERN - DEATH, no
mention was made of relevant
facts of the history of its prior
non-publication by the Daily.
Furthermore, the Daily's
heading replaced my word
"truth" by the word "life" — a
substitution reflecting the
consensus in academia nowadays
that "truth", together with
"liberty" and "honor", is trivial
compared to "life". Indeed, it was
on this aspect that I focussed my
remarks when interviewed
immediately after the disruption
of my class in Solid State theory
on January 18 by Miss Theresa
Ramirez, who introduced herself
as managing editor of the Daily
and the reporter assigned to the
story. She told me that notice of
an incident, of unspecified
character, had been received by
the Daily many hours in advance.
In responding to reporter
Ramirez' questions about the
disruption of my class I said:
"I think this is a symptom of a
lack of intellectual integrity and
objectivity at the highest
intellectual levels of the nation. I
think college students now have a
right to be disillusioned by the
lip-service given to the power of
thought and the failure of our
intellectual leaders to honor the
spirit of scientific inquiry in the
human-quality problems of our
nation, specifically those of urban
decay and the tragic disadvantages
of our black minority.
"I come to the conclusion that
the moral responsibilities of
intellectuals are not being lived up
to. I have endeavored to put these
moral obligations to think in
written form in a Letter-to-the-
Editor in Presbyterian Life in
response to an attack in their
columns comparing me to Hitler.
"I believe that this response of
mine is the best statement that I
can make at the present time and
it is submitted herewith for
publication in the Daily."
Only after several telephone
calls to the Daily failed to
provoke publication of my
interview with Daily reporter
Ramirez, did I decide to present
my position by publishing as an
advertisement the quotations
from my KAPPAN article. By
omitting these facts when
publishing my THREE MORAL
POSTULATES, the Daily has

once again failed to publish
relevant truth.
The Daily omitted the last
sentence from my paragraph on
the DEATH POSTULATE: "What
better goal for an agnostic?" This
sentence conveys my belief that
the POSTULATES apply broadly
enough to include, for example,
Unitarians.
W. Shockley
Professor of Electrical Engineering
Editor, THE DAILY:
We are writing on behalf of the
"Sumposium", the group of
students who organized the
Imperialism conference that was
held here last week. In Bob
Litterman's news commentary,
"Study of Imperialism
Legitimized", published in the
Monday, Feb. 28, issue of the
Daily, it was erroneous that only
three graduate students organized
it. In fact, a large number of men
and women organized the event
and worked on a variety of tasks
since last May.
We would like to thank all of
those people who generously
volunteered their time and effort
for this educational program,
accomplished with a very small
budget, as well as the SWOPSI
staff for their very helpful
encouragement and support.
Bill Behn
The Symposium
Editor, THE DAILY:
The woman's Physical
Education Department at
Stanford, has in, my opinion,
placed its priorities exactly where
they should be; that is in providng
ample opportunity for all women
students to learn and practice
tennis, golf, swimming and other
sports in a nonthreatening
environment. I would be very
saddened to see a change in the
direction proposed by the articles
in last weeks Daily, especially if
the change were made at the
expense of the less than star
atheletes who are currently
engaged in physical education
courses for pleasure.
