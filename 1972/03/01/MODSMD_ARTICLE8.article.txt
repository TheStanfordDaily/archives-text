## Fasting—Violent Or Non-Violent? 
### 
The article by Nancy Lowe
(Feb. 23) raised some interesting
questions about violent and
non-violent potest. Ms. Lowe
does not seem to re r that
violence has many ,T iriations in
type and dtgree, and that not all
of these forms may be treated in
the same manner.
First, one must ask if fasting
(or other types of protest, such as
sit-ins, etc.) is violent in the
conventional sense. The answer is
obviously no; there is no physical
damage done to anyone or
anything. Sit-ins by themselves do
not damage a building, nor do
many demonstrations.
According to Webster's New
World Dictionary violence is
"physical force used so as to
injure, damage or destroy". In no
wav does a fast satisfy this

definition. A sit-in is not violent
in this sense either because even
though some degree of force is
used, no-one is injured and
nothing is damaged or destroyed.
(Of course, not all sit-ins are
non-violent, but when violence
does occur, it is due to the
irresponsibility of those dealing
with the protesters and/or some
of the protestors themselves.)
Other Definitions
There are, however, two other
definitions of violence given by
the dictionary, a) the "unjust or
callous use of force or power, as
in violating another's rights,
sensibilities, etc.," and "great
force or strength of feeling,
conduct, or expression." While
reading these two definitions, one
must keep in mind that the three
definitions together refer to
different types of violence. Seen
in this light, violence cannot be
thought of in terms of black and
white.
The fast cannot justifiably be
called callous or unjust since the
protesters' purpose amply

indicates their feeling towards
humanity and their hopes for
justice. And as for the last
definition, the only applicable
one, is such a "great force ... of
feeling" really so abhorrent? Is it
revolting that some people might
object with such strength of
feeling to the destructive function
of the military? That someone
might not see it fit to allow
recruitment by industries which
actively participate in finding the
most efficient ways of injuring,
damaging, and destroying with
physical force thousands upon
thousands of human beings?
Such feelings and actions most
assuredly do create a
psychological pressure, but isn't it
possible that such a conflict is
justifiable? Pressure of this kind is
always — not sometimes, but
always — present whenever there
are two opposing viewpoints. In
his story, Ms. Lowe neglects the
fact that there was a very subtle,
yet very real, psychological
pressure being applied purely by
the presence of the students.

After all, there had never been a
direct confrontation between the
parties before, had there?
Moral Superiority
The sense of moral superiority
existed also; the students felt that
they were morally right to protect
the birds. It was this feeling that
led them to visit the lord.
And finally, Ms. Lowe's form
of non-violent protest would not
work without that simple, but
strong, feeling of "not wanting to
have the birds killed." This also
comes under the third definition
of violence.
One must agree that the fast
was psychologically pressuring
and manipulative. But can this
type of violence be fairly
associated with firebombing,
napalming, and the murder of
human beings in Vietnam?
Ms. Lowe's ideal is a very
pleasant one indeed, but it is
unfortunately very far out of step
with reality.
