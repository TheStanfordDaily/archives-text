# diminishes freedom
## A 						Reply To Bob Barker 
### 
Bob Barker of the Students for
Responsible Action had a letter in
the February 22 Stanford Daily
outlining the program of this new
conservative group.
Barker claims that the
underlying theme of the new
group's program is "let the
individual decide for himself."
This is indeed a worthy goal and
one which we have often
proclaimed as our own.
But we don't think it is really
the goal of Barker and his friends,
for their program, if it were
implemented, would diminish
individual freedom.
Danger
The danger lies in the fact that
one way to interpret the phrase
"let the individual decide for
himself' is "let every murderer
freely murder if that is his desire."
In fact one does not have the right
to enslave other people or to kill
innocents.
If Barker's concern is truly for
people's rights being interferred
with, we implore him to join
those who in self-defense are
standing up around the world to
the regular and systematic
invasions of rights and destruction
of property being practiced every
day by the U.S. Department of
Defense.
Barker also suggests that
people have as wide a choice as

possible subject only to their own
consciences. "Freedom of
conscience" is, however, a
doctrine fraught with peril. The
doctrine that "I have the right to
do what my conscience tells me to
do, simply because my conscience
tells me to do it" is a totally
subjective one. As John Courney
Murray and Robert A. Graham
have noted, this "freedom of
conscience" theory says that "in
the end, it is my conscience, and
not the objective truth, that
determines what is right or wrong,
true or false."
Criminals
It is demonstrably true that the
Department of Defense does not
go around respecting other
people's rights. The Department
of Defense and its corporate
appurtenances are a gang of
criminals, to the degree that they
have aggressed against innocent
human beings.
If Barker would examine the
facts, he would see that
eliminating ROTC and closing the
Placement Center to the
military-industrial complex serves
to secure the individual freedom
of Indochinese and Americans.
Individual liberty, Mr. Barker,
provides no authority to kill,
maim, and burn peasants or to
enslave draftees.
Barker writes also about
technologically sophisticated
weaponry. First, there are two
sorts of weapons â€” those which
can be pinpointed at aggressors,
thus sparing the innocent; and
weapons designed for mass
murder of the innocent. All
weapons which cannot be used in
a way which discriminates
between the aggressors and the
innocent (e.g., nuclear weapons)
should be banned.
Gang
Secondly, the U.S. Department
of Defense is, as we have said, a
criminal gang, which should be
punished, not given more weapons
of destruction.
Finally, Barker writes of "our
friends, the Nationalist Chinese."
The government of Chiang
Kai-shek may be a friend (or even
a client) of the U.S. government,
but it is no friend of freedom.
Civil liberties are conspicuously
absent on Taiwan, just as they are
on the mainland. Chiang and his
exile government in Taipei has

refused to allow self-determina
tion by the Formosan people,
something that the Peking
government would also deny
them.
The only conclusion that one
can draw from examining the
programmatic goals of the

radical libertarians

Students for Responsible Action
is that they are engaged in a reflex
defense of U.S. government
policy, not a defense of "letting
the individual decide for himself."
