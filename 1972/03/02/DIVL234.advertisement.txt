. . . the Stanford Daily will hold a meeting for students interested in joining the staff spring quarter.
Nobody really knows if they'd like Daily work until they try it. It is fun. It does pay. It is good
experience. It does give you a chance to help make Stanford a better university.
But is it for you? There's only one way to find out.
Meeting for new staffers Tuesday at 4 p.m. in the Daily office, Storke Publications Building, Lomita
Drive. Leave your name and phone number if you can't make it. We're at 321-2300, ext. 4632.
