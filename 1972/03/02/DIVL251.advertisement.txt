SEA has ignored the blasts from each side and stands on its past record. We of SEA are Stanford
staff from SLAC and the campus who believe we should get a better deal from Stanford. Since our
formation, over 3 years ago, Stanford has feared that we will bond together into a union. They
have tried to appease us with the up grading of benefits. Since there is still a long way to go they
have given you their answer — minimal wage raises, retirement programs so eroded by the cost of
living that most are far less than the Social Security benefits, and on and on, but you know this.
SEA will represent us all with DIGNITY, HONESTY, and INTELLEGENCE, WITHOUT any
political ties shoved down your throat which means that you as an individual can be proud of SEA
and secure in proper representation. No strong arm tactics or threats could possibly change
anyones mind at the bargaining table either.
We staff of Stanford and members of SEA have worked to the betterment of us all and will hope
to be your representative at the bargaining table.
