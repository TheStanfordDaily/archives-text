AND YOU'RE OUT!
So pick up a copy of the National Lampoon's
March "Escape" issue and find asylum in our
special Split-to-the-Coast section, Time

National Lampoon is the only humor magazine
that melts in your head, not in your mouth. On
sale at your local newsstand. (Look for the
Nazi on the wrapper.)
