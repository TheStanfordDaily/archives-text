# Hearing Officier Finds Ho Innocent Of Assault
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP)
hearing officer Leslie Minkus Tuesday
recommended on the basis of the facts
he had heard that Kwonping Ho be
found innocent on charges of assault
and entering the Faculty Club kitchen
on January 24 with the intent to steal
food.
Nevertheless, Minkus, in his report
released yesterday, said, "In my
judgment, the charge of assault and
the charge of what presumably would
be considered burglary in the criminal
law are really irrelevant to the primary
issue in this case.
"The conduct which I believe the
Administration should consider in
determining impropriety is the
'occupation' of the Faculty Club."
The charges against Ho resulted from
the Stanford Rehabilitation Movement
(SRM) invasion of the Club.
The University had charged Ho
with assaulting the Club's executive
chef, Arturo Lionetti, in his attempts
to get past Lionetti and into the Club
kitchen. It also asserted that Ho
intended to steal food when he
"forced his way into the kitchen."
Not Established
Minkus began his findings of fact as
follows: "1) I find that the
Administration has not established
beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr.
Ho assaulted Mr. Lionetti.
"2) I find that the Administration
has not established beyond a
reasonable doubt that Mr. Ho entered
the Faculty Club for the purpose of
stealing food."
Other findings of fact by Minkus
included: "I find that the
Administration has not established
beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr.
Ho stole a loaf of bread.

"I find that the Administration has
not established beyond a reasonable
doubt that Mr. Ho stole a piece of
bread."
Minkus said he was "unable to
make a recommendation as to whether
the conduct found to have occurred
constitutes a violation of the
Fundamental Standard."
"My first reason for making no
recommendation is because I feel that
any judgment as to whether the
conduct as found constitutes a
violation of the Fundamental Standard
should be made by members of the
University community and not by
outsiders."
Sum and Substance
Minkus concluded his report: "The
sum and substance of the case against
Mr. Ho seems to me to be that he
engaged in, and perhaps led, a
demonstration in a facility in which,
put colloquially, he had no business.
"That conduct may or may not be
appropriate; it may or may not violate
the Fundamental Standard. But it is the
only conduct, under the facts as
found, which I feel is appropriate
for the Campus Judicial Panel to
consider in determining whether the
Fundamental Standard was violated."
Law student Zack Wasserman, who
served on Ho's defense counsel said
yesterday that "the report is about
what we expected. I do think his
recommendations mistake the crux of
the case. I think the crux is whether
the defendant violated the
Fundamental Standard as charged."
Of Minkus, Ho himself, said "I was
gratified that he found that the bulk
of the facts were as we had said." He
added that "I really question the
legality of that under the CJP rules. I
must be judged under the rules."

Ho also said that "what Minkus said
1 did was what 350 other people did."
He told the Daily last night that CJP
Chairman John Kaplan's secretary had
told him that the full CJP would meet
to consider the case early next quarter.
Special Assistant to the President John
Schwartz, who had prosecuted Ho for
the University, refused to make any
comment on the case until after the
full panel had met.
The full CJP will meet at 8 p.m.
today in Geology 320 to consider the
case against the four students charged
with violation of the Policy on
Campus Disruption for the November
4 "mill-in" at the Placement Center.
The four are senior Don Lee and
sophomore Steve Downey, both of
Venceremos, and sophomores Pete
Knutson and Paul Loeb, both of the
Young Crows. Hearing officer Lillian
Altree recommended last Thursday
that the CJP find the four guilty as
charged.

make a recommendation as to whether
the conduct found to have occurred
constitutes a violation of the
Fundamental Standard."
"My first reason for making no
recommendation is because I feel that
any judgment as to whether the
conduct as found constitutes a
violation of the Fundamental Standard
should be made by members of the
University community and not by
outsiders."
Sum and Substance
Minkus concluded his report: "The
sum and substance of the case against
Mr. Ho seems to me to be that he
engaged in, and perhaps led, a
demonstration in a facility in which,
put colloquially, he had no business.
"That conduct may or may not be
appropriate; it may or may not violate
the Fundamental Standard. But it is the
only conduct, under the facts as
found, which I feel is appropriate
for the Campus Judicial Panel to
consider in determining whether the
Fundamental Standard was violated."
Law student Zack Wasserman, who
served on Ho's defense counsel said
yesterday that "the report is about
what we expected. I do think his
recommendations mistake the crux of
the case. I think the crux is whether
the defendant violated the
Fundamental Standard as charged."
Of Minkus, Ho himself, said "I was
gratified that he found that the bulk
of the facts were as we had said." He
added that "I really question the
legality of that under the CJP rules. I
must be judged under the rules."

Ho also said that "what Minkus said
1 did was what 350 other people did."
He told the Daily last night that CJP
Chairman John Kaplan's secretary had
told him that the full CJP would meet
to consider the case early next quarter.
Special Assistant to the President John
Schwartz, who had prosecuted Ho for
the University, refused to make any
comment on the case until after the
full panel had met.
The full CJP will meet at 8 p.m.
today in Geology 320 to consider the
case against the four students charged
with violation of the Policy on
Campus Disruption for the November
4 "mill-in" at the Placement Center.
The four are senior Don Lee and
sophomore Steve Downey, both of
Venceremos, and sophomores Pete
Knutson and Paul Loeb, both of the
Young Crows. Hearing officer Lillian
Altree recommended last Thursday
that the CJP find the four guilty as
charged.

STERLING SILVER, ANYONE?-Kwonping Ho offers plastic dining utensils to lunchers at the Faculty Club last
January in exchange for the $2,000 worth of silverware and china taken earlier in the week. Ho's Campus Judicial Panel
hearing officer Tuesday recommended that Ho be found not guilty of charges relating to the original incident.
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP)
hearing officer Leslie Minkus Tuesday
recommended on the basis of the facts
he had heard that Kwonping Ho be
found innocent on charges of assault
and entering the Faculty Club kitchen
on January 24 with the intent to steal
food.
Nevertheless, Minkus, in his report
released yesterday, said, "In my
judgment, the charge of assault and
the charge of what presumably would
be considered burglary in the criminal
law are really irrelevant to the primary
issue in this case.
"The conduct which I believe the
Administration should consider in
determining impropriety is the
'occupation' of the Faculty Club."
The charges against Ho resulted from
the Stanford Rehabilitation Movement
(SRM) invasion of the Club.
The University had charged Ho
with assaulting the Club's executive
chef, Arturo Lionetti, in his attempts
to get past Lionetti and into the Club
kitchen. It also asserted that Ho
intended to steal food when he
"forced his way into the kitchen."
Not Established
Minkus began his findings of fact as
follows: "1) I find that the
Administration has not established
beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr.
Ho assaulted Mr. Lionetti.
"2) I find that the Administration
has not established beyond a
reasonable doubt that Mr. Ho entered
the Faculty Club for the purpose of
stealing food."
Other findings of fact by Minkus
included: "I find that the
Administration has not established
beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr.
Ho stole a loaf of bread.

"I find that the Administration has
not established beyond a reasonable
doubt that Mr. Ho stole a piece of
bread."
Minkus said he was "unable to
make a recommendation as to whether
the conduct found to have occurred
constitutes a violation of the
Fundamental Standard."
"My first reason for making no
recommendation is because I feel that
any judgment as to whether the
conduct as found constitutes a
violation of the Fundamental Standard
