# Emeritus University
## Smith Finds Key To Unlock Time 
### JEFFREY M. PERL 
Jeffery J. Smith leans
precariously forward, grey-haired
and bright-eyed, and says, "I'm an
oddball." He speaks with the
conviction of a man who knows
he is the only sane person in the
room.
Smith, a philosophy professor
and associate director of
humanities programs, simply
refuses to act like a 64-year-old
scholar is "supposed" to.
Seeing a parallel between age
and youth, Smith says he would
like to "get them together." He
believes in many student
championed crusades, including
the anti-war movement, and signs
his letters "Peace" rather than
"Yours truly."
He notes that "the old and the
young have a lot of freedom,"
while those in between have to
earn money, battle Internal
Revenue forms, and lead cub
scout hikes.
In professorial fashion, Smith
explains youthful exploits with a
theory — a concept he dubs "total
person." Men must explore and be
everything they are, he declares.
Be Other Ages
Smith advises the old, whom
he says "actually experience the
full range of life," not to be "just
old." He wants to see his peers
"be all the other ages they've

been,too."
After retiring at the end of this
academic year, Smith will devote
his time to Emeritus University,
an idea of his which has received
international attention.
He conceives of the new
University as a place where
scholars and students of
retirement age could gather to
share experiences and broaden
their education.
Smith hopes to raise $3 million
to establish a small campus, but
till then the project is
headquartered in his Portola
Valley home.
Smith will teach a seminar
titled "The Arts and the Art of
Living" in Atherton, beginning
this month. At the same time, Dr.
Henry L. Shepherd will present
"Man On Earth: A Study of
Social Geography" in San
Francisco.
"Enrollment will be limited,"
Smith explains, "but because we
want Emeritus University to serve
the whole community, booklets
will become available covering
each course, so that anyone
anywhere can take the course by
himself or with a group of
like-minded students."
Emeritus U. eventually will
have a faculty of 30, drawn from
the ranks of scholars who have
reached retirement age but neither

want to retire nor quit teaching.
No Grades, Degrees
Emphasis will be on the liberal
arts, individual research and
creativity, Smith says. No grades
or degrees will be offered and
both faculty and student terms
will be limited to three years.
Tuition based on ability to pay
will be charged. Scholarships and
stipends will be available as funds
permit.
John W. Dodds, emeritus
professor of English, Willis W.
Harman, professor of
engineering-economic systems and
director of educational policy
research, Stanford Research
Institute, and Philosophy
professor John L. Mothershead,
will serve on the Emeritus Board
of Trustees.
For Smith, teaching has

distinct classroom and
extra-curricular functions. Within
the context of a course, the
teacher's role is to answer
questions. "I have an answer to
every question," Smith boasts. "It
is usually 'I don't know."
Most Important
Outside class, the teacher's
responsibility and rewards spring
from "completely changing the
whole course of students' lives,
awakening them to life." Smith
says when he started teaching at
USC, Columbia and Stanford he
would succeed in redirecting
about one life per year but now it
happens "about once a week."

Is this increase attributable to
heightened consciousness or
openness in college students?
"No," Smith answers ingenuously.
"I'm just better at it."
Smith accomplishes this feat
by asking questions as old as
philosophy, and attempting to
elicit the deepest responses he
can. "What is the most important
thing in the world to you? What
ought you to be doing right
now?" he probes in
eyeball-to-eyeball fashion. Most
students are willing to reply
because Smith also submits
himself to their questioning.
The most important thing to
him? "My kinship with everything
that is . .. my intimate relation
with everything in existence and
with the whole of existence," he
intones in an unworldly voice.
Birthday Party
A negative reaction to a
conversion attempt, a refusal to
be open with Smith, makes him
perceptibly uncomfortable.
A graduate student in
philosophy says of Smith, "There
is a sense in which his
proselytizing for spontaneity is a
contradiction in terms. It's like
saying, 'Be spontaneous, goddamn
it.' When he fails, he gets like a
kid whose birthday party has been
interrupted, and throws a
tantrum."
Smith's fondness for
person-to-person confrontation
may show the effect of spending
seven of his 12 years of graduate
work at Oxford, known for its
system of individual tutoring. He
also admires the absence of a "line
between study and play" at
Oxford, and says "education is a
total thing there," in line with his
own "total person" concept.
Smith divided the other five
college years following graduation
(at age 20) from USC between his
alma mater and Berkeley. His
studies resulted in a formidable
collection of degrees and an
enduring interest in religion,
esthetics, architecture (he
designed his family's ultra-modern
house), anthropology and
parapsychology.
Telepathic Dreams
"Everybody has a sneaking
desire to live in some kind of
transcendent way," Smith
contends. "And there are things
going on that quite transcend the
simple mechanism of 19th
century science."
Smith finds astrology,
numerology, tarot decks and the
like "stimulating but not

convincing," while he is satisfied
that psychic phenomena are
objective facts. He encourages
those with psychic ability to
develop it.
"I was jolted into the field by
telepathic dreams" shared with a
friend, Smith states, admitting
that now "parapsychology affects
my whole outlook."
Dreaming aside, Smith is noted
for his "amazing intuition" about
people, and thus often is named as
a character judge to committees
awarding prestigious fellowships.
His fascination with the
supernatural leads Smith to look
for symbols ("Jungian, not
medieval") in all things, and may
also be one cause of his
"attraction to martyrs." Among
the people Smith most admires
are Jesus, Gandhi and Joan of
Arc, because they "lived life to
the fullest, and that is apt to
involve death or ignominy."
Role of Reason
Dr. Smith's transcendental
inclinations and academic
non-conformity (he has published
little scholarly matter despite the
fact he is a full professor at a
major university) leave some of
his colleagues a bit dubious. In the
Philosophy Department
particularly, Smith's occultist
enthusiasms and lack of discipline
are regarded as signs of
anti-intellectualism.
Because of his unorthodox
behavior and attitudes, some view
Smith as an academic version of
Elwood P. Dowd, drifting through
life in conversation with a six-foot
tall, invisible rabbit named
Harvey. Others, including some
students and department
secretaries, agree his eccentricities
simply make him, as one put it,
"loads of fun to be with."
Many Visitors
Nor is Smith without ardent
disciples. His outer-office is often
jammed with suitors, and visits
with Smith are punctuated by
frequent telephone calls. His lure
is obvious: intriguing innocence
and irresistible inscrutability.
At the entrance to Dr. Smith's
world, tacked on his office door,
is a large, simple poster, seemingly
drawn by a child's hand, with an
abstract pattern of pastel flowers.
"The flowers, the gorgeous,
mystic, multi-colored flowers are
not the flowers of life, but people,
yes people are the true flowers of
life. And it has been a most
precious pleasure to have
temporarily strolled in your
garden."

EMERITUS- Professor Jeffery Smith who will devote his time to
Emeritus University, an academic community for retired people,
following his own retirement at the end of this school year. Smith, a
self-described •'oddball," says men should strive to explore and be
everything they are.


PROFESSOR JEFFERY SMITH
Jeffery J. Smith leans
precariously forward, grey-haired
and bright-eyed, and says, "I'm an
oddball." He speaks with the
conviction of a man who knows
he is the only sane person in the
room.
Smith, a philosophy professor
and associate director of
humanities programs, simply
refuses to act like a 64-year-old
scholar is "supposed" to.
Seeing a parallel between age
and youth, Smith says he would
like to "get them together." He
believes in many student
championed crusades, including
the anti-war movement, and signs
his letters "Peace" rather than
"Yours truly."
He notes that "the old and the
young have a lot of freedom,"
while those in between have to
earn money, battle Internal
Revenue forms, and lead cub
scout hikes.
In professorial fashion, Smith
explains youthful exploits with a
theory — a concept he dubs "total
person." Men must explore and be
everything they are, he declares.
Be Other Ages
Smith advises the old, whom
he says "actually experience the
full range of life," not to be "just
old." He wants to see his peers
"be all the other ages they've

been,too."
After retiring at the end of this
academic year, Smith will devote
his time to Emeritus University,
an idea of his which has received
international attention.
He conceives of the new
University as a place where
scholars and students of
retirement age could gather to
share experiences and broaden
their education.
Smith hopes to raise $3 million
to establish a small campus, but
till then the project is
headquartered in his Portola
Valley home.
Smith will teach a seminar
titled "The Arts and the Art of
Living" in Atherton, beginning
this month. At the same time, Dr.
Henry L. Shepherd will present
"Man On Earth: A Study of
Social Geography" in San
Francisco.
"Enrollment will be limited,"
Smith explains, "but because we
want Emeritus University to serve
the whole community, booklets
will become available covering
each course, so that anyone
anywhere can take the course by
himself or with a group of
like-minded students."
Emeritus U. eventually will
have a faculty of 30, drawn from
the ranks of scholars who have
reached retirement age but neither

want to retire nor quit teaching.
No Grades, Degrees
Emphasis will be on the liberal
arts, individual research and
creativity, Smith says. No grades
or degrees will be offered and
both faculty and student terms
will be limited to three years.
Tuition based on ability to pay
will be charged. Scholarships and
stipends will be available as funds
permit.
John W. Dodds, emeritus
professor of English, Willis W.
Harman, professor of
engineering-economic systems and
director of educational policy
research, Stanford Research
Institute, and Philosophy
professor John L. Mothershead,
will serve on the Emeritus Board
of Trustees.
For Smith, teaching has

distinct classroom and
extra-curricular functions. Within
the context of a course, the
teacher's role is to answer
questions. "I have an answer to
every question," Smith boasts. "It
is usually 'I don't know."
Most Important
Outside class, the teacher's
responsibility and rewards spring
from "completely changing the
whole course of students' lives,
awakening them to life." Smith
says when he started teaching at
USC, Columbia and Stanford he
would succeed in redirecting
about one life per year but now it
happens "about once a week."

Is this increase attributable to
heightened consciousness or
openness in college students?
"No," Smith answers ingenuously.
"I'm just better at it."
Smith accomplishes this feat
by asking questions as old as
philosophy, and attempting to
elicit the deepest responses he
can. "What is the most important
thing in the world to you? What
ought you to be doing right
now?" he probes in
eyeball-to-eyeball fashion. Most
students are willing to reply
because Smith also submits
himself to their questioning.
The most important thing to
him? "My kinship with everything
that is . .. my intimate relation
with everything in existence and
with the whole of existence," he
intones in an unworldly voice.
Birthday Party
A negative reaction to a
conversion attempt, a refusal to
be open with Smith, makes him
perceptibly uncomfortable.
A graduate student in
philosophy says of Smith, "There
is a sense in which his
proselytizing for spontaneity is a
contradiction in terms. It's like
saying, 'Be spontaneous, goddamn
it.' When he fails, he gets like a
kid whose birthday party has been
interrupted, and throws a
tantrum."
Smith's fondness for
person-to-person confrontation
may show the effect of spending
seven of his 12 years of graduate
work at Oxford, known for its
system of individual tutoring. He
also admires the absence of a "line
between study and play" at
Oxford, and says "education is a
total thing there," in line with his
own "total person" concept.
Smith divided the other five
college years following graduation
(at age 20) from USC between his
alma mater and Berkeley. His
studies resulted in a formidable
collection of degrees and an
enduring interest in religion,
esthetics, architecture (he
designed his family's ultra-modern
house), anthropology and
parapsychology.
Telepathic Dreams
"Everybody has a sneaking
desire to live in some kind of
transcendent way," Smith
contends. "And there are things
going on that quite transcend the
simple mechanism of 19th
century science."
Smith finds astrology,
numerology, tarot decks and the
like "stimulating but not

convincing," while he is satisfied
that psychic phenomena are
objective facts. He encourages
those with psychic ability to
develop it.
"I was jolted into the field by
telepathic dreams" shared with a
friend, Smith states, admitting
that now "parapsychology affects
my whole outlook."
Dreaming aside, Smith is noted
for his "amazing intuition" about
people, and thus often is named as
a character judge to committees
awarding prestigious fellowships.
His fascination with the
supernatural leads Smith to look
for symbols ("Jungian, not
medieval") in all things, and may
also be one cause of his
"attraction to martyrs." Among
the people Smith most admires
are Jesus, Gandhi and Joan of
Arc, because they "lived life to
the fullest, and that is apt to
involve death or ignominy."

Dr. Smith's transcendental

EMERITUS- Professor Jeffery Smith who will devote his time to
Emeritus University, an academic community for retired people,
following his own retirement at the end of this school year. Smith, a
self-described •'oddball," says men should strive to explore and be
everything they are.


PROFESSOR JEFFERY SMITH
Jeffery J. Smith leans
precariously forward, grey-haired
and bright-eyed, and says, "I'm an
oddball." He speaks with the
conviction of a man who knows
he is the only sane person in the
room.
Smith, a philosophy professor
and associate director of
humanities programs, simply
refuses to act like a 64-year-old
scholar is "supposed" to.
Seeing a parallel between age
and youth, Smith says he would
like to "get them together." He
believes in many student
championed crusades, including
the anti-war movement, and signs
his letters "Peace" rather than
"Yours truly."
He notes that "the old and the
young have a lot of freedom,"
while those in between have to
earn money, battle Internal
Revenue forms, and lead cub
scout hikes.
In professorial fashion, Smith
explains youthful exploits with a
theory — a concept he dubs "total
person." Men must explore and be
everything they are, he declares.
Be Other Ages
Smith advises the old, whom
he says "actually experience the
full range of life," not to be "just
old." He wants to see his peers
"be all the other ages they've

been,too."
After retiring at the end of this
academic year, Smith will devote
his time to Emeritus University,
an idea of his which has received
international attention.
He conceives of the new
University as a place where
scholars and students of
retirement age could gather to
share experiences and broaden
their education.
Smith hopes to raise $3 million
to establish a small campus, but
till then the project is
headquartered in his Portola
Valley home.
Smith will teach a seminar
titled "The Arts and the Art of
Living" in Atherton, beginning
this month. At the same time, Dr.
Henry L. Shepherd will present
"Man On Earth: A Study of
Social Geography" in San
Francisco.
"Enrollment will be limited,"
Smith explains, "but because we
want Emeritus University to serve
the whole community, booklets
will become available covering
each course, so that anyone
anywhere can take the course by
himself or with a group of
like-minded students."
Emeritus U. eventually will
have a faculty of 30, drawn from
the ranks of scholars who have
reached retirement age but neither

want to retire nor quit teaching.
No Grades, Degrees
Emphasis will be on the liberal
arts, individual research and
creativity, Smith says. No grades
or degrees will be offered and
both faculty and student terms
will be limited to three years.
Tuition based on ability to pay
will be charged. Scholarships and
stipends will be available as funds
permit.
John W. Dodds, emeritus
professor of English, Willis W.
Harman, professor of
engineering-economic systems and
director of educational policy
research, Stanford Research
Institute, and Philosophy
professor John L. Mothershead,
will serve on the Emeritus Board
of Trustees.
For Smith, teaching has

distinct classroom and
extra-curricular functions. Within
the context of a course, the
teacher's role is to answer
questions. "I have an answer to
every question," Smith boasts. "It
is usually 'I don't know."
Most Important
Outside class, the teacher's
responsibility and rewards spring
from "completely changing the
whole course of students' lives,
awakening them to life." Smith
says when he started teaching at
USC, Columbia and Stanford he
would succeed in redirecting
about one life per year but now it
happens "about once a week."

Is this increase attributable to
heightened consciousness or
openness in college students?
"No," Smith answers ingenuously.
"I'm just better at it."
Smith accomplishes this feat
by asking questions as old as
philosophy, and attempting to
elicit the deepest responses he
can. "What is the most important
thing in the world to you? What
ought you to be doing right
now?" he probes in
eyeball-to-eyeball fashion. Most
students are willing to reply
because Smith also submits
himself to their questioning.
The most important thing to
him? "My kinship with everything
that is . .. my intimate relation
with everything in existence and
with the whole of existence," he
intones in an unworldly voice.
Birthday Party
A negative reaction to a
conversion attempt, a refusal to
be open with Smith, makes him
perceptibly uncomfortable.
A graduate student in
philosophy says of Smith, "There
is a sense in which his
proselytizing for spontaneity is a
contradiction in terms. It's like
saying, 'Be spontaneous, goddamn
it.' When he fails, he gets like a
kid whose birthday party has been
interrupted, and throws a
tantrum."
Smith's fondness for
person-to-person confrontation
may show the effect of spending
seven of his 12 years of graduate
work at Oxford, known for its
system of individual tutoring. He
also admires the absence of a "line
between study and play" at
Oxford, and says "education is a
total thing there," in line with his
own "total person" concept.
Smith divided the other five
college years following graduation
(at age 20) from USC between his
alma mater and Berkeley. His
studies resulted in a formidable
collection of degrees and an
enduring interest in religion,
esthetics, architecture (he
designed his family's ultra-modern
house), anthropology and
parapsychology.
Telepathic Dreams
"Everybody has a sneaking
desire to live in some kind of

Smith finds astrology,

"I was jolted into the field by
telepathic dreams" shared with a
friend, Smith states, admitting
that now "parapsychology affects

Dreaming aside, Smith is noted
for his "amazing intuition" about
people, and thus often is named as
a character judge to committees
awarding prestigious fellowships.
His fascination with the

also be one cause of his
"attraction to martyrs." Among

questions. "I have an answer to
every question," Smith boasts. "It
is usually 'I don't know."
Most Important
Outside class, the teacher's
responsibility and rewards spring
from "completely changing the
whole course of students' lives,
awakening them to life." Smith
says when he started teaching at
USC, Columbia and Stanford he
would succeed in redirecting
about one life per year but now it
happens "about once a week."

Is this increase attributable to
heightened consciousness or
openness in college students?
"No," Smith answers ingenuously.
"I'm just better at it."
Smith accomplishes this feat
by asking questions as old as
philosophy, and attempting to
elicit the deepest responses he
can. "What is the most important
thing in the world to you? What
ought you to be doing right
now?" he probes in
eyeball-to-eyeball fashion. Most
students are willing to reply
because Smith also submits
himself to their questioning.
The most important thing to
him? "My kinship with everything
that is . .. my intimate relation
with everything in existence and
with the whole of existence," he
intones in an unworldly voice.
Birthday Party
A negative reaction to a
conversion attempt, a refusal to
be open with Smith, makes him
perceptibly uncomfortable.
A graduate student in
philosophy says of Smith, "There
is a sense in which his
proselytizing for spontaneity is a
contradiction in terms. It's like
saying, 'Be spontaneous, goddamn
it.' When he fails, he gets like a
kid whose birthday party has been
interrupted, and throws a
tantrum."
Smith's fondness for
person-to-person confrontation
may show the effect of spending
seven of his 12 years of graduate
work at Oxford, known for its
system of individual tutoring. He
also admires the absence of a "line
between study and play" at
Oxford, and says "education is a
total thing there," in line with his
own "total person" concept.
Smith divided the other five
college years following graduation
(at age 20) from USC between his
alma mater and Berkeley. His
studies resulted in a formidable
collection of degrees and an
enduring interest in religion,
esthetics, architecture (he
designed his family's ultra-modern
house), anthropology and
parapsychology.
Telepathic Dreams
"Everybody has a sneaking
desire to live in some kind of
transcendent way," Smith
contends. "And there are things
going on that quite transcend the
simple mechanism of 19th
century science."
Smith finds astrology,
numerology, tarot decks and the
like "stimulating but not

convincing," while he is satisfied
that psychic phenomena are
objective facts. He encourages
those with psychic ability to
develop it.
"I was jolted into the field by
telepathic dreams" shared with a
friend, Smith states, admitting
that now "parapsychology affects
my whole outlook."
Dreaming aside, Smith is noted
for his "amazing intuition" about
people, and thus often is named as
a character judge to committees
awarding prestigious fellowships.
His fascination with the
supernatural leads Smith to look
for symbols ("Jungian, not
medieval") in all things, and may
also be one cause of his
"attraction to martyrs." Among
the people Smith most admires
are Jesus, Gandhi and Joan of
Arc, because they "lived life to
the fullest, and that is apt to
involve death or ignominy."
Role of Reason
Dr. Smith's transcendental
inclinations and academic
non-conformity (he has published
little scholarly matter despite the
fact he is a full professor at a
major university) leave some of
his colleagues a bit dubious. In the
Philosophy Department
particularly, Smith's occultist
enthusiasms and lack of discipline
are regarded as signs of
anti-intellectualism.
Because of his unorthodox
behavior and attitudes, some view
Smith as an academic version of
Elwood P. Dowd, drifting through
life in conversation with a six-foot
tall, invisible rabbit named
Harvey. Others, including some
students and department
secretaries, agree his eccentricities
simply make him, as one put it,
"loads of fun to be with."
Many Visitors
Nor is Smith without ardent
disciples. His outer-office is often
jammed with suitors, and visits
with Smith are punctuated by
frequent telephone calls. His lure
is obvious: intriguing innocence
and irresistible inscrutability.
At the entrance to Dr. Smith's
world, tacked on his office door,
is a large, simple poster, seemingly
drawn by a child's hand, with an
abstract pattern of pastel flowers.
"The flowers, the gorgeous,
mystic, multi-colored flowers are
not the flowers of life, but people,
yes people are the true flowers of
life. And it has been a most
precious pleasure to have
temporarily strolled in your
garden."

EMERITUS- Professor Jeffery Smith who will devote his time to
Emeritus University, an academic community for retired people,
following his own retirement at the end of this school year. Smith, a
self-described •'oddball," says men should strive to explore and be
everything they are.


PROFESSOR JEFFERY SMITH
Jeffery J. Smith leans
precariously forward, grey-haired
and bright-eyed, and says, "I'm an
oddball." He speaks with the
conviction of a man who knows
he is the only sane person in the
room.
Smith, a philosophy professor
and associate director of
humanities programs, simply
refuses to act like a 64-year-old
scholar is "supposed" to.
Seeing a parallel between age
and youth, Smith says he would
like to "get them together." He
believes in many student
championed crusades, including
the anti-war movement, and signs
his letters "Peace" rather than
"Yours truly."
He notes that "the old and the
young have a lot of freedom,"
while those in between have to
earn money, battle Internal
Revenue forms, and lead cub
scout hikes.
In professorial fashion, Smith
explains youthful exploits with a
theory — a concept he dubs "total
person." Men must explore and be
everything they are, he declares.
Be Other Ages
Smith advises the old, whom
he says "actually experience the
full range of life," not to be "just
old." He wants to see his peers
"be all the other ages they've

been,too."
After retiring at the end of this
academic year, Smith will devote
his time to Emeritus University,
an idea of his which has received
international attention.
He conceives of the new
University as a place where
scholars and students of
retirement age could gather to
share experiences and broaden
their education.
Smith hopes to raise $3 million
to establish a small campus, but
till then the project is
headquartered in his Portola
Valley home.
Smith will teach a seminar
titled "The Arts and the Art of
Living" in Atherton, beginning
this month. At the same time, Dr.
Henry L. Shepherd will present
"Man On Earth: A Study of
Social Geography" in San
Francisco.
"Enrollment will be limited,"
Smith explains, "but because we
want Emeritus University to serve
the whole community, booklets
will become available covering
each course, so that anyone
anywhere can take the course by
himself or with a group of
like-minded students."
Emeritus U. eventually will
have a faculty of 30, drawn from
the ranks of scholars who have
reached retirement age but neither

want to retire nor quit teaching.
No Grades, Degrees
Emphasis will be on the liberal
arts, individual research and
creativity, Smith says. No grades
or degrees will be offered and
both faculty and student terms
will be limited to three years.
Tuition based on ability to pay
will be charged. Scholarships and
stipends will be available as funds
permit.
John W. Dodds, emeritus
professor of English, Willis W.
Harman, professor of
engineering-economic systems and
director of educational policy
research, Stanford Research
Institute, and Philosophy
professor John L. Mothershead,
will serve on the Emeritus Board
of Trustees.
For Smith, teaching has

distinct classroom and
extra-curricular functions. Within
the context of a course, the
teacher's role is to answer
questions. "I have an answer to
every question," Smith boasts. "It
is usually 'I don't know."
Most Important
Outside class, the teacher's
responsibility and rewards spring
