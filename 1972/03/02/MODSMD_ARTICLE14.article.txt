# CJP Authority Doubted By Defense
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Opposing viewpoints on
whether the Campus Judicial
Panel (CJP) violates the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968 and the ASSU Constitution
of 1969 were heard Tuesday night
by the full Panel in Cubberley
Auditorium.
Arguing against the legitimacy
of the Panel were law students
Zack Wasserman, Wally Hunkeler
and Mick Goldstein. Iris Brest,
Legal Counsel in the General
Secretary's Office, argued in
behalf of the University
Administration.
Convening at 8:00 p.m.
Tuesday, the full Panel sat to hear
arguments on the motions of
Wasserman, who was technically
representing two unnamed
students whose CJP hearings are

private by their request. The
hearing lasted until midnight.
Kaplan told the Daily that the
CJP had met Wednesday and
would meet this week to consider
the arguments it had heard.
The defense brief argued
President Lyman's establishing of
the CJP violated the Legislative
and Judicial Charter (LJC) of
1968 (Article 111 A 1) which they
said provides "that amendments
to the LJC can only come through
joint approval of the LASSU,
Academic Council and President."
The brief also argued that the
ASSU Constitution of 1969, to
which "the Board of Trustees
granted [its] approval was
violated in the establishment of
the CJP. The Constitution reads
that "the Association shall
recognize the authority of the

University judicial bodies over
members of the Association only
if those judicial bodies shall have
been approved by two thirds of
those members of the Association
voting in a general election."
Summing up, the defense
argued that "the President's
exercise of his 'emergency power'
to create the new CJP was
without authority according to
the University Trusts and the LJC.
First, the Article IV provision in
the LJC granting residual
authority to the President can
only grant such powers as are 'just
and equitable.' And, these powers
are defined by Articles I, II and
111 of the LJC. These three articles
show a preference for action by
students, faculty and
administration jointly."
In opposition, the University
brief argued that "the present
judicial procedures were
established by a proper exercise of
the President's authority" because
a severe emergency existed with
the Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC).
The brief continued "it is
inconceivable that the Board of
Trustees would ever place the
University in the absurd position
that it would be in if defendants'
arguments were upheld: that is.
that regardless of the situation on

campus, regardless of how dire the
state of the University might be,
no disciplinary procedure could
be established unless and until
there were a two-thirds vote of
the student body approving it."
The University also argued that
"the [ASSU] Constitution binds
only the ASSU and its
constituents, the student body,
and neither is nor purports to be a
contract between the students and
the Trustees. To view the matter
otherwise requires a belief that
the Trustees confided all
authority for student discipline to
the student body without so
much as consulting the President
or the faculty."
The Administration continued
by saying that "there is no reason
to suppose that the Board felt it
was necessary to have such a
tri-partite agreement [on judicial
proceedings] to assure just and
equitable rules of
students.
Additionally, the
Administration argued that "the
defendants conclude that the
residual powers of the President in
Article IV of the LJC are limited
to 'just and equitable powers.'
There is simply no basis for this
assertion. Article IV explicitly
states that the Charter does not
limit the President's authority."

111 of the LJC. These three articles
show a preference for action by
students, faculty and
administration jointly."
In opposition, the University
brief argued that "the present
judicial procedures were
established by a proper exercise of
the President's authority" because
a severe emergency existed with
the Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC).
The brief continued "it is
inconceivable that the Board of
Trustees would ever place the
University in the absurd position
that it would be in if defendants'
arguments were upheld: that is.
that regardless of the situation on

campus, regardless of how dire the
state of the University might be,
no disciplinary procedure could
be established unless and until
there were a two-thirds vote of
the student body approving it."
The University also argued that
"the [ASSU] Constitution binds
only the ASSU and its
constituents, the student body,
and neither is nor purports to be a
contract between the students and
the Trustees. To view the matter
otherwise requires a belief that
the Trustees confided all
authority for student discipline to
the student body without so
much as consulting the President
or the faculty."
The Administration continued
by saying that "there is no reason
to suppose that the Board felt it
was necessary to have such a
tri-partite agreement [on judicial
proceedings] to assure just and
equitable rules of
students.
Additionally, the
Administration argued that "the
defendants conclude that the
residual powers of the President in
Article IV of the LJC are limited
to 'just and equitable powers.'
There is simply no basis for this
assertion. Article IV explicitly
states that the Charter does not
limit the President's authority."
Opposing viewpoints on
whether the Campus Judicial
Panel (CJP) violates the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968 and the ASSU Constitution
of 1969 were heard Tuesday night
by the full Panel in Cubberley
Auditorium.
Arguing against the legitimacy
of the Panel were law students
Zack Wasserman, Wally Hunkeler
and Mick Goldstein. Iris Brest,
Legal Counsel in the General
Secretary's Office, argued in
behalf of the University
Administration.
Convening at 8:00 p.m.
Tuesday, the full Panel sat to hear
arguments on the motions of
Wasserman, who was technically
representing two unnamed
students whose CJP hearings are

private by their request. The
hearing lasted until midnight.
Kaplan told the Daily that the
CJP had met Wednesday and
would meet this week to consider
the arguments it had heard.
The defense brief argued
President Lyman's establishing of
the CJP violated the Legislative
and Judicial Charter (LJC) of
1968 (Article 111 A 1) which they
said provides "that amendments
to the LJC can only come through
joint approval of the LASSU,
Academic Council and President."
The brief also argued that the
ASSU Constitution of 1969, to
which "the Board of Trustees
granted [its] approval was
violated in the establishment of
the CJP. The Constitution reads
that "the Association shall
recognize the authority of the

University judicial bodies over
members of the Association only
if those judicial bodies shall have
been approved by two thirds of
those members of the Association
voting in a general election."
Summing up, the defense
argued that "the President's
exercise of his 'emergency power'
to create the new CJP was
without authority according to
the University Trusts and the LJC.
First, the Article IV provision in
the LJC granting residual
authority to the President can
only grant such powers as are 'just
and equitable.' And, these powers
are defined by Articles I, II and
111 of the LJC. These three articles
show a preference for action by
students, faculty and
administration jointly."
