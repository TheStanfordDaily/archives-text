## 
### 
Marcio Moreira Alves, Brazilian
journalist and former
Congressman, ousted by the
military' in 1968, will be at
Stanford today. Under the
sponsorship of the Faculty
Political Action Group and the
Third World Liberation Front, he
will be talking about "The Social
Costs of Brazilian Economic
Development" at the
International Center at 4:30.
Mr. Alves' speech before the
Brazilian Congress in September
1968 precipitated the closing of
Congress and the issuing of
Institutional Act Number 5,
known as "the coup within the
coup" which suspended civil
rights, dissolved Congress and
concentrated unlimited powers in
the hands of the President.
After eight years of military
rule Brazil has shown a
spectacular increase in GNP —
more than 10 percent a year over
the last three years. At the same
time there has been an ever
growing concentration of wealth
and power, accompanied by the
use of political repression to
silence opponents of the regime.
Mr. Alves will analyze the effects
of this kind of regime on the
Brazilian people's lives.
Since he was expelled from the
country, Mr. Alves has lived in
exile in Chile and now lives in
France where he works for the

Catholic newspaper "La Croix."
He is the author of the soon to be
published book "A Grain of
Mustard Seed, the Awakening of
the Brazilian Revolution," which
has just been awarded the Casa de
Las Americas prize in Havana for
outstanding literary work in Latin
America.
