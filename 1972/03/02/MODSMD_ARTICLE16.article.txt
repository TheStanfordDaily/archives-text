# Delmer Daves On Film: Past, Present & Future
## 
### 
Delmer Daves is a retired
actor-writer-producer director
who made 62 films for five major
studios from 1930 until his
retirement in 1965. At one time,
Daves headed his own production
company, Diamond D, and served
as governor of the Motion Picture
Academy of Arts and Sciences. He
was also a member of the
Producers' Directors' und Writers'
Guilds of America, sometimes of
all three at once.
Daves, a Stanford alumnus, was
on campus last week to open an
exhibition and free film festival of
his works. Two of his films have
already been screened in
Annenberg Auditorium and two
more movies are scheduled for the
rest of the festival: "Cowboy"
(1957) starring Glenn Ford will be
shown tonight at 8 p.m. and
"3:10 to Yuma," (1957) also
starring Glenn Ford, will be
shown next Tuesday at 8 p.m.
Admission is free.
A collection of Daves' which
includes eighty-three boxes of
notes, correspondence and
manuscripts which went into the
making of 75 finished scripts and
plays — of which 62 were made
into movies for Warner Brothers,
20th Century-Fox, Paramount,
MGM, Columbia Pictures and
united Artists — is currently on
display in the Bender Room of
the Main Library. The exhibit will
remain open through April 14.
Last Friday, Daily Entertainment
Editor Don To lief son interviewed
Daves.

As you undoubtedly know, a

group of American Indians
students here recently petitioned
the University to discontinue its
use of the word Indians as a
symbol for its athletic teams.
Since you worked with Native
Americans in a number of films,
how do you feel about their
request?
I have worked so much with
Indians. What is lacking here is the
great humor 1 found among the
Apaches 1 worked with in a
number of films. In "Broken
Arrow," 500 Apache Indians were
the upper strata in the film with
the pioneers on the lower strata. I
have great respect for Indians and
I tried to show this in my films. I
think our Indians are getting too
uptight because Indians have the
greatest sense of humor I've seen.
One of the crucial judgements of
today is the dimunition of sense
of humor. I don't know why,
since laughter will sometimes
solve the problem.
Actually the Indians symbol at
Stanford is an honor. Not a single
Indian can say it was adopted to
ridicule the Indians. I lived with
Indians and I know the people. If
it were up to those Apaches,
they'd say 'We're proud you chose
us as a symbol.' What about the
Greeks and the use of the
nickname Trojans? We're making
Indians into heroes by using them
as a symbol for our athletic teams.
I wish there would be a return
to amelioration of the anger.

That's what's wrong today. We
can't ameliorate the angers. If
we're purely angry, we can't see
the other side of the coin. That's
our whole conflict today.
Understanding is the thesis of my
life. I understand what they feel.
There has been enough 'loathe the
poor Indian' attitude in our
society. Frankly though, I don't
see it in the way we do it here. It's
a symbol of victory we're using,
that's the point. It's wrong to
think of it in terms of subjugation
or denigration.
Up until I did "Broken Arrow"
with Jimmy Stewart, films had
been made from the white man's
point of view that the Indian is a
savage. I tried to make a film that
would make you proud of the
Indians. That would show the
honor the white man didn't have.
I won a United Nations citation
for "Broken Arrow" which said in
essence 'For recognizing a simple
truth that yes there were bad
Indians, but there were also good
ones. And that yes there were
good white men, but there were
also bad white men."
After "Broken Arrow" a big
change came about in films'
attitude toward Indians. The
problem of today is that
everybody labels people. I go
every year of my life and visit a
different culture. We're afraid of
the different. Fear of the strange
and different is the key to our
problems today. The motto of
everybody on earth should be
'There is a better way.'
How effective do you think
films can be in changing people's
attitudes?
A film can open a window. All
I ask of my films is that one
window in a man's psyche be
opened, letting a little light in.
Speaking of the effect of films,
a recent editorial in the Palo Alto
Times cited violence in a number
of recent films, "Clockwork
Orange," "Straw Dogs," and
"Dirty Harry" and pointed out
that crimes similar to ones in
those films were committed
shortly after they were released in
the Bay Area. Do you feel a film
which depicts violence acts can
drive someone to commit a similar
act?
That's like saying that if you
see an auto accident, you'll put a
log across the road to cause
another one. That's shit. If a guy
is a psychotic, he can be driven to
commit an act by any number of
different stimuli.
What do you think of some of
these recently released films
which have been criticized for
their preponderance of violence?
In many recent films we see a
preponderance of hate. When it is
a johnny-one-note kind of hate,
it's just as bad as love films that
were ho-ho-ho. "Clockwork
Orange" is the "Mondo Cane" of
1972. How many thousand times
do you have to say I hate and I
kill to get a point over. The
repetitive sickness of that just
oversold itself in "Clockwork."
With the first killing in the first
five minutes we got the point that

man is cruel. Do we have to tell
stories in one note? Can the
Indians only see one side of the
Indian symbol question. This is an
age of blinders.
The motto in all of my
notebooks is Serenity — To Love
and Be Loved. I work on a love
principle rather than a hate
principle. It's the better way. To
love and be loved. Be loved — you
have to earn it. You can't have
love unless you've earned it. Long
term violence brings out boredom.
I got bored with the repetitive
violence of "Clockwork."
There is also constant violence
on TV and in westerns. I think
Sam Peckinpah is saddle-sore. I
think this is a compulsion on his
part. It serves a better artistic
purpose to do the violence in one
smashing scene. I believe we've
got a lot of Marquis de Sades
walking the street in film today.
What I've said about "Clockwork"
goes for "Straw Dogs" also.
Now "The French
Connection" was a superb film.
There was violence in it, but that's
the violence of today. Violence
was inherent. This is violence as it
is. Why is there a necessity to go
to such great lengths in depicting
violence? "The French
Connection" handles it best. It
wasn't violence for violence's
sake. I'm not an anti-violence film
man. I go along with it, if it has a
purpose.
Now "Clockwork Orange" did
have some superb aspects. I
approved of putting the spotlight
on the inhumanity and innate
cruelty of a prison. In a prison
they herd human beings like
cattle. That aspect of "Clockwork
Orange" I was all for. I don't
approve of constant cruelty,
however. Also, Malcolm
McDowell is a superlative actor.
And Stanley Kubrick does a
superlative job of direction. I
really have a dichotomy in my
feelings, since I've had the subject
matter up to here. But I believe
Kubrick is our best director of the
younger generation.
What recent films other than
"The French Connection" have
you really liked?
"The Last Picture Show." I'm
a documentarian at heart, and
that's what I liked about "The
Last Picture Show." I always tried
to use the documentary style in
my westerns and war films. I
really believed "The Last Picture
Show."
Recently 1 interviewed Ellen
Burstyn who won the Best
Supporting Actress awards of the
New York Film Critics and the
National Film Critics for her role
in "The Last Picture Show." She
is currently a nominee for the
Academy Award in that category
and when asked about the Oscars,
she said they were "bullshit."
How do you feel about the
Academy Awards?
Her reaction is a defense
mechanism. I've been on the
Academy Award board for 8
years. I wrote, produced and
directed the 25th Anniversary

Academy Awards show in the
Shrine Auditorium. That was the
last time it was done there with
10,000 people in the audience and
a three-hour show. I was the last
one able to write, produce and
direct the whole show, which is
what everyone should be doing
each year. We didn't have to get
TV money back then.
This is nonsense about the
commercial influence on the
Academy. We are turned off by
advertising. The more a person
advertises their film, the worse we
think the film is. Burstyn's just
preparing an alibi, in case she
loses. That's a normal, human
attitude.
With the advent of cable
television, do you forsee an end to
the wide use of theaters for
screening movies?
No. Naturally seeing a movie in
a theater adds a lot. Going to the
theater is an escape, rather than
turning on the TV. But I do
treasure the idea of cable TV for
its special purposes such as its
video-taping abilities. But if we
turn into troglodytes, the more we
shut ourselves in, the less
understanding we'll have. Turning
a house into a cave will be
retrogressive.
Many people today keep
talking about the "death of
Hollywood." Is Hollywood dying?
To a degree it is. Economics
have dictated the turn away from
big Hollywood productions to
small budget, on-location
shooting. The Union situation is
grievous. The transportation
boom has made shooting a lot
easier. But shooting abroad
incorporates a whole new set of
problems. In England, Americans
can only make up less than 5
percent of the film crew. There's a
problem with the vertical union in
England. Then there are the
censors, in countries like Spain
and Mexico. Out of 30 films I
directed, I only did one on a set.
The other 29 were done on
location. I believe in on-location
shooting as part of the
documentary approach.
One of the traditions of the
"old Hollywood" was big-name
actors and actresses whose very
appearance in a film would almost
always guarantee box office
success. Who do you see as the
really big actors and actresses of
the present era in film?
The miracle man is Gene
Hackman. He is a very big star
right now. He's not that
good-looking, he's just a fine
actor. I think Dustin Hoffman is
turning into a stuntist, but he's a
fine actor. Elliott Gould Eliott
Goulded himself out of stardom
since he was such an iconoclast. I
think this is a man's age in film.
But don't you feel there are
some rising female stars such as
Liza Minelli who was featured in
cover stories in both Time and
Newsweek in recent weeks?
Liza captures you on the
nightclub circuit. She has the kind
of face that projects ail the way to
the back row of a night club. Her
father Vincent has her kind of
face. She has very little of her
mother's facial qualities. She has a
likeness to Leslie Caron. I really
miss Caron. She was a star that
was passed by. Getting back to
Liza, her face is so strong in

nightclubs, but it can be less than
that when you put a big lens on
her in a film.
Moving to directors for a
moment, how would you respond
to the criticism of Peter
Bogdonavich that he used a
compilation of other directors'
styles in "The Last Picture
show?"
I don't see how we could avoid
seeing a fine movie and saying,
'I'd like to try that' and 'I could
do that.' It's like a writer reading
something. In "Midnight
Cowboy" I recognized three
directors behind it, but the
unification was strictly John
Schlesinger's. I don't see how
you'd separate yourself from what
you see. I've learned from every
fine director I've ever seen.
Do you feel the trend in
moviemaking is towards or away
from hyphenates such as yourself
who do more than one thing on a
film such as directing,
screenwriting and producing all at
the same time?
It's coming in more. John
Huston, George Seaton and I were
the only hyphenates in 1943.
Directing yourself though is
impossible. The camera's eye is
objective and subjective. The
camera eye has to see what the
lens is capturing. As a director,
my instinct is to be a part of the
work rather than just an

autonomous director. A director
must nurse his crew, he must do a
million things.
Predictions are always risky,
but what trends do you see
happening in the film world in the
near future?
Hollywood is staggering. It
can't shake off the monster
approach which I've always been
opposed to, happily. In the past I
had more freedom as a contract
director though than I would now
making an independent film with
outside financing. The unity of
units in Hollywood has been
destroyed. I feel desperately the
loss of continuity of staff. I used
to work with the same cameraman
on 6 or 7 films. That unity is
missing. There's no longer the
cohesion of community spirit in
studios. We have lost the film
commune.

FILM FESTIVAL—A free film festival of the works of Delmer Daves
continues tonight at the Annenberg Auditorium of the Cummings Art
Building with a screening of "Cowboy" at 8 p.m. "3:10 to Yuma"
will be screened in Annenberg next Tuesday at 8 p.m. An exhibition
of notes, correspondences and manuscripts of Daves is currently on
display at the Bender Room of the Main Library where it will remain

JOHNNY ONE NOTE—Veteran filmmaker Delmer Daves feels that
Stanley Kubrick's highly controversial new film is the "Mondo Cane"
of 1972 ... How many thousand times do you have to say I hate and
I kill to get a point over. The repetitive sickness of that just oversold
itself in "Clockwork." But Daves admitted that " 'Clockwork Orange'
does have some superb aspects. I approved of putting the spotlight on
the inhumanity and innate cruelty of a prison .. . And Malcolm
McDowell is a superlative actor. And Stanley Kubrick does a
superlative job of direction. But when it's a johnny-one-note kind of
hate, it's just as bad as love films that were he-he-he."
