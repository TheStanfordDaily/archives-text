# 'Dealing:...' Lacks Lyricism
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
''Dealing: or the
Berkeley-to-Boston Forty-Brick
Lost Bag Blues" attempts to whip
up a palatable whole using bits of
recipes for such disparate genres
as the gangster film, the
youth-sex-drug syndrome and the
odd-ball, mis-matched romance.
Presumably because of its careless
but confident combination of
elements, the film has already
been compared to the
uncatagorizable "Shoot the Piano
Player" and "Pierrot le Fou,"
works remarkable not only for
their perverse (and acknowledged
and knowing) blending of genres
but for their deliriously personal
lyricism.
What "Dealing" lacks more
than anything is warmth and a
partiality towards any characters
or way of life as opposed to
another. As in "The
Revolutionary," director Paul
Williams seems curiously detached
from the dramatic immediacy of
his story and the personal
concerns of his characters,
concerns, incidentally, which
begin as part-time interests
(radical politics and dope
peddling, respectively) and are
escalated, mostly through
circumstance, into full-time
occupations with potentially fatal
consequences.
Plot Device
The plot device of being drawn
into an activity and being in above
your head before you know what
is happening could respectably be
fleshed out to thematic
proportions, conceivably to
suggest how people may
unknowingly stumble upon true
commitments or how one
becomes a professional without
ever intending to.
Although his visual style is
emphatically cool and detached
(remarkably so considering the
assumed blistering relevance of his
subjects), the directorial distance
more often seems the result (and
cause) of emotional ambivilance
than fashionable, pre-planned
existentialism and mutes the
action rather than clarifies it.
"Dealing" is based on a novel
(serialized in Playboy last year)
written by the maniacally prolific
Michael Crighton under the
pseudonym of Michael Douglas.
The Berkeley dope scene is
handled with greater care and at
greater length in the novel, as the
(trtni lingers in the Bay Area after
the illegal transaction only long
enough to present the spectacle of
caskets direct from Vietnam being
unloaded from a freight train, to
reaffirm the West Coast's
supposed monopoly on
high-spirited, sexually together
females and to pay homage to the
mythic status San Francisco
International achieved as the
locale of "Bullitt" 's climatic
shootout.
A New Life
"Dealing" 's own shootout is
an invention not to be found in
the novel which puts police pigs
against (foreign) criminal pigs in
which, if 1 recall, six pigs of all
kinds are dispatched, all this while
the cross-country dope peddling
couple hide undetected out of the
line of fire. When the shooting
stops, the couple merely hops
aboard a motorcycle in order, as
the promotional material so
escitingly puts it, to begin a new
life.
The abrupt, off-handed staging
of the finale represents a
completion of a degenerating
full-circle in the shootout
tradition. As his films from"The
Roaring Twenties" to "High
Sierra" to "Colorado Territory"
to "White Heat" all ended in a
blaze of unrestrained gunfire,
Raoul Walsh could reasonably be
invoked to stand for the American

action melodrama at its purest,
involving no pretentions and
intending to do no more than
create excitement.
In the hands of Truffaut and
Godard (raised on the likes of
Walsh), climatic violence in the
American manner seemed at the
same time an affectionate
homage, dramatically gratuitous
and discordant and beguilingly
innocent. Though the French
gangsters and their deaths had
their roots in America, they
looked fresh and revitalized (if
occasionally hokey and
anachronistic) transplanted in
Paris.
Inept Gunmen
Paul Williams undoubtedly
admires Truffaut far more than
Walsh and in that the baddies in
"Dealing" resemble more than
anything the inept, scampering
gunmen of "Shoot the Piano
Player," the impact of the
menacing henchman upon
returning to his natural homeland
is slight after having been diluted
in his passage through several
decades and divergent critical and
cultural traditions. To think that
Truffaut himself expressed regret
at his own handling of the
snow-bound gunfight in "Shoot
the Piano Player" diminishes
Williams' status even further,
though the current instance is not
as disturbing as watching Bunuel
ape "Breathless" in "Belle de
Jour."
The most amusing side of
"Dealing" is its evocation of at
least one style of student life at
Harvard. The film's principal
dealer is an effete, Oscar Wilde-ish
dandy who dresses to the teeth,
sports fashionably long but neatly
groomed hair and whose musical
tastes run more towards Chopin
and Cole Porter than Ravi
Shankar or the Rolling Stones.
No Tolerance
He's a business man before
anything else, has no tolerance for
the nastiness and despondancy of
the users to whom he caters and
won't allow the personal hangups
of his employees to stand in the
way of the efficiency of his
operation. As well, cocaine or

anything else harder than grass is
out. It should be acknowledged
that such types thrive everywhere,
with Stanford far from being an
exception, though I must admit
that the further one travels from
Cambridge, the harder it is to find
men so bloody tasteful and
refined.
As a footnote, "Dealing" is yet
another film in which it is possible
to drive from San Francisco to
Berkeley using the upper level of

the Bay Bridge. Mike Nichols has
long since admitted his
transgression in "The Graduate,"
where he opted over realism for
the sake of the scenic splendors of
a helicopter shot. Nonetheless, I
think this apparently permanent
poetic license is becoming a bit
tiresome, as it's the sort of trivial
lapse which causes everyone in the
audience to lean towards his
neighbor to point out the faux
pas.

though the current instance is not
as disturbing as watching Bunuel
ape "Breathless" in "Belle de
Jour."
The most amusing side of
"Dealing" is its evocation of at
least one style of student life at
Harvard. The film's principal
dealer is an effete, Oscar Wilde-ish
dandy who dresses to the teeth,
sports fashionably long but neatly
groomed hair and whose musical
tastes run more towards Chopin
and Cole Porter than Ravi
Shankar or the Rolling Stones.
No Tolerance
He's a business man before
anything else, has no tolerance for
the nastiness and despondancy of
the users to whom he caters and
won't allow the personal hangups
of his employees to stand in the
way of the efficiency of his
operation. As well, cocaine or

anything else harder than grass is
out. It should be acknowledged
that such types thrive everywhere,
with Stanford far from being an
exception, though I must admit
that the further one travels from
Cambridge, the harder it is to find
men so bloody tasteful and
refined.
As a footnote, "Dealing" is yet
another film in which it is possible
to drive from San Francisco to
Berkeley using the upper level of

the Bay Bridge. Mike Nichols has
long since admitted his
transgression in "The Graduate,"
where he opted over realism for
the sake of the scenic splendors of
a helicopter shot. Nonetheless, I
think this apparently permanent
poetic license is becoming a bit
tiresome, as it's the sort of trivial
lapse which causes everyone in the
audience to lean towards his
neighbor to point out the faux
pas.

''Dealing: or the
Berkeley-to-Boston Forty-Brick
Lost Bag Blues" attempts to whip
up a palatable whole using bits of
recipes for such disparate genres
as the gangster film, the
youth-sex-drug syndrome and the
odd-ball, mis-matched romance.
Presumably because of its careless
but confident combination of
elements, the film has already
been compared to the
uncatagorizable "Shoot the Piano
Player" and "Pierrot le Fou,"
works remarkable not only for
their perverse (and acknowledged
and knowing) blending of genres
but for their deliriously personal
lyricism.
What "Dealing" lacks more
than anything is warmth and a
partiality towards any characters
or way of life as opposed to
another. As in "The
Revolutionary," director Paul
Williams seems curiously detached
from the dramatic immediacy of
his story and the personal
concerns of his characters,
concerns, incidentally, which
begin as part-time interests
(radical politics and dope
peddling, respectively) and are
escalated, mostly through
circumstance, into full-time
occupations with potentially fatal
consequences.
Plot Device
The plot device of being drawn
into an activity and being in above
your head before you know what
is happening could respectably be
fleshed out to thematic
proportions, conceivably to
suggest how people may
unknowingly stumble upon true
commitments or how one
becomes a professional without
ever intending to.
Although his visual style is
emphatically cool and detached
(remarkably so considering the
assumed blistering relevance of his
subjects), the directorial distance
more often seems the result (and
cause) of emotional ambivilance
than fashionable, pre-planned
existentialism and mutes the
action rather than clarifies it.
"Dealing" is based on a novel
(serialized in Playboy last year)
written by the maniacally prolific
Michael Crighton under the
pseudonym of Michael Douglas.
The Berkeley dope scene is
handled with greater care and at
greater length in the novel, as the
(trtni lingers in the Bay Area after
the illegal transaction only long
enough to present the spectacle of
caskets direct from Vietnam being
unloaded from a freight train, to
reaffirm the West Coast's
supposed monopoly on
high-spirited, sexually together
females and to pay homage to the
mythic status San Francisco
International achieved as the
locale of "Bullitt" 's climatic
shootout.
A New Life
"Dealing" 's own shootout is
an invention not to be found in
the novel which puts police pigs
against (foreign) criminal pigs in
which, if 1 recall, six pigs of all
kinds are dispatched, all this while
the cross-country dope peddling
couple hide undetected out of the
line of fire. When the shooting
stops, the couple merely hops
aboard a motorcycle in order, as
the promotional material so
escitingly puts it, to begin a new
life.
The abrupt, off-handed staging
of the finale represents a
completion of a degenerating
full-circle in the shootout
tradition. As his films from"The
Roaring Twenties" to "High
Sierra" to "Colorado Territory"
to "White Heat" all ended in a
blaze of unrestrained gunfire,
Raoul Walsh could reasonably be
invoked to stand for the American

action melodrama at its purest,
involving no pretentions and
intending to do no more than
create excitement.
In the hands of Truffaut and
Godard (raised on the likes of
Walsh), climatic violence in the
American manner seemed at the
same time an affectionate
homage, dramatically gratuitous
and discordant and beguilingly
innocent. Though the French
gangsters and their deaths had
their roots in America, they
looked fresh and revitalized (if
occasionally hokey and
anachronistic) transplanted in
Paris.
Inept Gunmen
Paul Williams undoubtedly
admires Truffaut far more than
Walsh and in that the baddies in
"Dealing" resemble more than
anything the inept, scampering
gunmen of "Shoot the Piano
Player," the impact of the
menacing henchman upon
returning to his natural homeland
is slight after having been diluted
in his passage through several
decades and divergent critical and
cultural traditions. To think that
Truffaut himself expressed regret
at his own handling of the
snow-bound gunfight in "Shoot
the Piano Player" diminishes
Williams' status even further,
though the current instance is not
as disturbing as watching Bunuel
ape "Breathless" in "Belle de
Jour."

Michael Crighton under the
pseudonym of Michael Douglas.
The Berkeley dope scene is
handled with greater care and at
greater length in the novel, as the
(trtni lingers in the Bay Area after
the illegal transaction only long
enough to present the spectacle of
caskets direct from Vietnam being
unloaded from a freight train, to
reaffirm the West Coast's
supposed monopoly on
high-spirited, sexually together
females and to pay homage to the
mythic status San Francisco
International achieved as the
locale of "Bullitt" 's climatic
shootout.
A New Life
"Dealing" 's own shootout is
an invention not to be found in
the novel which puts police pigs
against (foreign) criminal pigs in
which, if 1 recall, six pigs of all
kinds are dispatched, all this while
the cross-country dope peddling
couple hide undetected out of the
line of fire. When the shooting
stops, the couple merely hops
aboard a motorcycle in order, as
the promotional material so
escitingly puts it, to begin a new
life.
The abrupt, off-handed staging
of the finale represents a
completion of a degenerating
full-circle in the shootout
tradition. As his films from"The
Roaring Twenties" to "High
Sierra" to "Colorado Territory"
to "White Heat" all ended in a
blaze of unrestrained gunfire,
Raoul Walsh could reasonably be
invoked to stand for the American

action melodrama at its purest,
involving no pretentions and
intending to do no more than
create excitement.
In the hands of Truffaut and
Godard (raised on the likes of
Walsh), climatic violence in the
American manner seemed at the
same time an affectionate
homage, dramatically gratuitous
and discordant and beguilingly
innocent. Though the French
gangsters and their deaths had
their roots in America, they
looked fresh and revitalized (if
occasionally hokey and
anachronistic) transplanted in
Paris.
Inept Gunmen
Paul Williams undoubtedly
admires Truffaut far more than
Walsh and in that the baddies in
"Dealing" resemble more than
anything the inept, scampering
gunmen of "Shoot the Piano
Player," the impact of the
menacing henchman upon
returning to his natural homeland
is slight after having been diluted
in his passage through several
decades and divergent critical and
cultural traditions. To think that
Truffaut himself expressed regret
at his own handling of the
snow-bound gunfight in "Shoot
the Piano Player" diminishes
Williams' status even further,
though the current instance is not
as disturbing as watching Bunuel
ape "Breathless" in "Belle de
Jour."
The most amusing side of
"Dealing" is its evocation of at
least one style of student life at
Harvard. The film's principal
dealer is an effete, Oscar Wilde-ish
dandy who dresses to the teeth,
sports fashionably long but neatly
groomed hair and whose musical
tastes run more towards Chopin
and Cole Porter than Ravi
Shankar or the Rolling Stones.
No Tolerance
He's a business man before
anything else, has no tolerance for
the nastiness and despondancy of
the users to whom he caters and
won't allow the personal hangups
of his employees to stand in the
way of the efficiency of his
operation. As well, cocaine or

anything else harder than grass is
out. It should be acknowledged
that such types thrive everywhere,
with Stanford far from being an
exception, though I must admit
that the further one travels from
Cambridge, the harder it is to find
men so bloody tasteful and
refined.
As a footnote, "Dealing" is yet
another film in which it is possible
to drive from San Francisco to
Berkeley using the upper level of

the Bay Bridge. Mike Nichols has
long since admitted his
transgression in "The Graduate,"
where he opted over realism for
the sake of the scenic splendors of
a helicopter shot. Nonetheless, I
think this apparently permanent
poetic license is becoming a bit
tiresome, as it's the sort of trivial
lapse which causes everyone in the
audience to lean towards his
neighbor to point out the faux
pas.

''Dealing: or the
Berkeley-to-Boston Forty-Brick
Lost Bag Blues" attempts to whip
up a palatable whole using bits of
recipes for such disparate genres
as the gangster film, the
youth-sex-drug syndrome and the
odd-ball, mis-matched romance.
Presumably because of its careless
but confident combination of
elements, the film has already
been compared to the
uncatagorizable "Shoot the Piano
Player" and "Pierrot le Fou,"
works remarkable not only for
their perverse (and acknowledged
and knowing) blending of genres
but for their deliriously personal
lyricism.
What "Dealing" lacks more
than anything is warmth and a
partiality towards any characters
or way of life as opposed to
another. As in "The
Revolutionary," director Paul
Williams seems curiously detached
from the dramatic immediacy of
his story and the personal
concerns of his characters,
concerns, incidentally, which
begin as part-time interests
(radical politics and dope
peddling, respectively) and are
escalated, mostly through
circumstance, into full-time
occupations with potentially fatal
consequences.
Plot Device
The plot device of being drawn
into an activity and being in above
your head before you know what
is happening could respectably be
fleshed out to thematic
proportions, conceivably to
suggest how people may
unknowingly stumble upon true
commitments or how one
becomes a professional without
ever intending to.
Although his visual style is
emphatically cool and detached
(remarkably so considering the
assumed blistering relevance of his
subjects), the directorial distance
more often seems the result (and
cause) of emotional ambivilance
than fashionable, pre-planned
existentialism and mutes the
action rather than clarifies it.
