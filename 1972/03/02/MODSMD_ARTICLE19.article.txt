Education, Busing Bill Passes
WASHINGTON — The Senate turned down by one vote a
last-minute effort to revive the stringent Griffin antibusing
amendment yesterday and then passed 88 to 6 the
$23-billion higher education-school desegregation bill.
The major section of the bill authorizes large additional
sums and new formulas for aid to college students, both
grants and loans, and also to all institutions of higher
education.
The controversial proposal of Republican Whip Robert
P. Griffin of Michigan to strip federal courts of power to
order busing in school desegregation cases was brought up
again by Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas, the Republican
national chairman, just before the passage vote.
This time it was beaten 48 to 47. It was rejected 50 to
47 Tuesday.
Senate passage of the mammoth education bill, which
covers many subjects besides busing, sent it to conference
with the House.
The congressional stand on busing finally will be
decided in that conference since the House did include
three stiff antibusing amendments when it passed the
legislation last November..
The Senate did put into the bill a compromise
amendment offered by Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield
of Montana and Republican Leader Hugh Scott of
Pennsylvania in an attempt to head off more stringent
curbs.
It contains mild restrictions on busing but it does not
challenge the power of the federal courts to issue busing
orders.
Laird: Will Draft 50,000'
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird
has announced a 50,000-man 1972 draft goal that would
be the lowest since before the Korean War.
He said he still hopes to be down to no draft at all a
year from June.
"Our goal is still an all-volunteer force by June 30,
1973," Laird told newsmen yesterday. "We can meet that
goal if the acceptability of military service, to high school
people and on college campuses, is enhanced."
At the same time Laird said he may have to ask
Congress for authority to draft men into the military
reserves and National Guard as a last resort but said first
he will propose some kind of incentives to Congress in
April in an effort to draw enough men to meet their
manpower needs.
But while Laird announced the goal Pentagon officials
indicated it is an open question whether they can enlist
enough volunteers to keep the draft that low.
Deserter Statistics Noted
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon, objecting to any general
grant of amnesty for Vietnam war resisters, said yesterday
that more than 50,000 men have deserted the armed
forces or violated draft laws in the Vietnam era.
Currently there are an estimated 30,000 deserters, a
Pentagon official said at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee
hearing.
The assistant secretary of defense for personnel, Maj.
Gen. Lee Benade, said that the figure includes 2,232 men
who have deserted to such foreign countries as Sweden,
Canada and Mexico.

"Of those who have deserted to other countries less
than 4.1 percent were motivated by anti-Vietnam or
political protest," Benade said.
As of Feb. 14, he said, there were 4,201 fugitives who
had been indicted or named in criminal complaints for
alleged violations of the Selective Service laws.
He said that at the end of January there were 5,901
defendants against whom indictments were pending and
12,333 other pending cases referred to the Justice
Department by the Selective Service system for
prosecution.
McCloskey Attacks Kliendienst
CONCORD, N.H. — Republican presidential hopeful Rep.
Paul N. McCloskey (R-Calif.) yesterday called for the
Senate Judiciary Committee to reopen hearings on the
nomination of Richard Kleindienst as attorney general to
learn about an alleged $400,000 pledge to help finance
the Republican National Convention.
The committee will hear Kleindienst under oath today
but has said it is not reopening his nomination hearing.
McCloskey, who is challenging President Nixon's
renomination, told newsmen here yesterday that former
Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell should be called along with
Kleindienst to "appear before Congress under oath."
Meantime, the Judiciary Committee said in Washington
that Deputy Atty. Gen. Kleindienst would testify under
oath today as it examines reports by columnist Jack
Anderson that the Justice Department dropped antitrust
action against International Telephone & Telegraph Co.,
after an ITT subsidiary pledged $400,000 for the GOP
convention next August in San Diego.
Kleindienst, whose nomination to succeed Mitchell has
already been unanimously approved by the committee,
requested the unusual hearing, Chairman James O.
Eastland (D-Miss.), told a newsman yesterday.
Mitchell and ITT have denied Anderson's allegations.
Chair-man Richard L. Herman of the GOP
Arrangements Committee planning for the August
convention in San Diego said the party would not accept
"such a disproportionate share of the expenses from one
source" as $400,000.
Berrigan Informer Produces Letters
HARRISBURG, Pa. — The Rev. Philip Berrigan's initial
piiority as a militant anti-war leader was the blowing up
of heating tunnels in Washington, according to an
FBI-intercepted letter read yesterday at his trial.
The letter was turned over to the FBI by informer
Boyd Douglas, star government witness at the federal
conspiracy trial of Berrigan and six codefendants.
"Since resources appear available for the subterranean
project in the District this should have priority for the
winter of 1970-1971," Berrigan is quoted in one of more
than a dozen letters read into the trial report by Asst.
Gen. William Lynch.
However, less than two months later, the government
claims, a purported plan to kidnap presidential aide Henry
A. Kissinger threatened to push the tunnel bombing
scheme into the background.
"Why not coordinate it with the one against Capitol
utilities?" Berrigan was quoted as writing in an Aug. 22,
1970 letter that is part of the indictment against him and
the others.

Gen. Lee Benade, said that the figure includes 2,232 men
who have deserted to such foreign countries as Sweden,
Canada and Mexico.

"Of those who have deserted to other countries less
than 4.1 percent were motivated by anti-Vietnam or
political protest," Benade said.
As of Feb. 14, he said, there were 4,201 fugitives who
had been indicted or named in criminal complaints for
alleged violations of the Selective Service laws.
He said that at the end of January there were 5,901
defendants against whom indictments were pending and
12,333 other pending cases referred to the Justice
Department by the Selective Service system for
prosecution.
McCloskey Attacks Kliendienst
CONCORD, N.H. — Republican presidential hopeful Rep.
Paul N. McCloskey (R-Calif.) yesterday called for the
Senate Judiciary Committee to reopen hearings on the
nomination of Richard Kleindienst as attorney general to
learn about an alleged $400,000 pledge to help finance
the Republican National Convention.
The committee will hear Kleindienst under oath today
but has said it is not reopening his nomination hearing.
McCloskey, who is challenging President Nixon's
renomination, told newsmen here yesterday that former
Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell should be called along with
Kleindienst to "appear before Congress under oath."
Meantime, the Judiciary Committee said in Washington
that Deputy Atty. Gen. Kleindienst would testify under
oath today as it examines reports by columnist Jack
Anderson that the Justice Department dropped antitrust
action against International Telephone & Telegraph Co.,
after an ITT subsidiary pledged $400,000 for the GOP
convention next August in San Diego.
Kleindienst, whose nomination to succeed Mitchell has
already been unanimously approved by the committee,
requested the unusual hearing, Chairman James O.
Eastland (D-Miss.), told a newsman yesterday.
Mitchell and ITT have denied Anderson's allegations.
Chair-man Richard L. Herman of the GOP
Arrangements Committee planning for the August
convention in San Diego said the party would not accept
"such a disproportionate share of the expenses from one
source" as $400,000.
Berrigan Informer Produces Letters
HARRISBURG, Pa. — The Rev. Philip Berrigan's initial
piiority as a militant anti-war leader was the blowing up
of heating tunnels in Washington, according to an
FBI-intercepted letter read yesterday at his trial.
The letter was turned over to the FBI by informer
Boyd Douglas, star government witness at the federal
conspiracy trial of Berrigan and six codefendants.
"Since resources appear available for the subterranean
project in the District this should have priority for the
winter of 1970-1971," Berrigan is quoted in one of more
than a dozen letters read into the trial report by Asst.
Gen. William Lynch.
However, less than two months later, the government
claims, a purported plan to kidnap presidential aide Henry
A. Kissinger threatened to push the tunnel bombing
scheme into the background.
"Why not coordinate it with the one against Capitol
utilities?" Berrigan was quoted as writing in an Aug. 22,
1970 letter that is part of the indictment against him and
the others.
Education, Busing Bill Passes
WASHINGTON — The Senate turned down by one vote a
last-minute effort to revive the stringent Griffin antibusing
amendment yesterday and then passed 88 to 6 the
$23-billion higher education-school desegregation bill.
The major section of the bill authorizes large additional
sums and new formulas for aid to college students, both
grants and loans, and also to all institutions of higher
education.
The controversial proposal of Republican Whip Robert
P. Griffin of Michigan to strip federal courts of power to
order busing in school desegregation cases was brought up
again by Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas, the Republican
national chairman, just before the passage vote.
This time it was beaten 48 to 47. It was rejected 50 to
47 Tuesday.
Senate passage of the mammoth education bill, which
covers many subjects besides busing, sent it to conference
with the House.
The congressional stand on busing finally will be
decided in that conference since the House did include
three stiff antibusing amendments when it passed the
legislation last November..
The Senate did put into the bill a compromise
amendment offered by Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield
of Montana and Republican Leader Hugh Scott of
Pennsylvania in an attempt to head off more stringent
curbs.
It contains mild restrictions on busing but it does not
challenge the power of the federal courts to issue busing
orders.
Laird: Will Draft 50,000'
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird
has announced a 50,000-man 1972 draft goal that would
be the lowest since before the Korean War.
He said he still hopes to be down to no draft at all a
year from June.
"Our goal is still an all-volunteer force by June 30,
1973," Laird told newsmen yesterday. "We can meet that
goal if the acceptability of military service, to high school
people and on college campuses, is enhanced."
At the same time Laird said he may have to ask
Congress for authority to draft men into the military
reserves and National Guard as a last resort but said first
he will propose some kind of incentives to Congress in
April in an effort to draw enough men to meet their
manpower needs.
But while Laird announced the goal Pentagon officials
indicated it is an open question whether they can enlist
enough volunteers to keep the draft that low.
Deserter Statistics Noted
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon, objecting to any general
grant of amnesty for Vietnam war resisters, said yesterday
that more than 50,000 men have deserted the armed
forces or violated draft laws in the Vietnam era.
Currently there are an estimated 30,000 deserters, a
Pentagon official said at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee
hearing.
The assistant secretary of defense for personnel, Maj.

than a dozen letters read into the trial report by Asst.
Gen. William Lynch.
However, less than two months later, the government
claims, a purported plan to kidnap presidential aide Henry
A. Kissinger threatened to push the tunnel bombing
scheme into the background.
"Why not coordinate it with the one against Capitol
utilities?" Berrigan was quoted as writing in an Aug. 22,
1970 letter that is part of the indictment against him and
the others.
Education, Busing Bill Passes
WASHINGTON — The Senate turned down by one vote a
last-minute effort to revive the stringent Griffin antibusing
amendment yesterday and then passed 88 to 6 the
$23-billion higher education-school desegregation bill.
The major section of the bill authorizes large additional
sums and new formulas for aid to college students, both
grants and loans, and also to all institutions of higher
education.
The controversial proposal of Republican Whip Robert
P. Griffin of Michigan to strip federal courts of power to
order busing in school desegregation cases was brought up
again by Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas, the Republican
national chairman, just before the passage vote.
This time it was beaten 48 to 47. It was rejected 50 to
47 Tuesday.
Senate passage of the mammoth education bill, which
covers many subjects besides busing, sent it to conference
with the House.
The congressional stand on busing finally will be
decided in that conference since the House did include
three stiff antibusing amendments when it passed the
legislation last November..
The Senate did put into the bill a compromise
amendment offered by Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield
of Montana and Republican Leader Hugh Scott of
Pennsylvania in an attempt to head off more stringent
curbs.
It contains mild restrictions on busing but it does not
challenge the power of the federal courts to issue busing
orders.
Laird: Will Draft 50,000'
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird
has announced a 50,000-man 1972 draft goal that would
be the lowest since before the Korean War.
He said he still hopes to be down to no draft at all a
year from June.
"Our goal is still an all-volunteer force by June 30,
1973," Laird told newsmen yesterday. "We can meet that
goal if the acceptability of military service, to high school
people and on college campuses, is enhanced."
At the same time Laird said he may have to ask
Congress for authority to draft men into the military
reserves and National Guard as a last resort but said first
he will propose some kind of incentives to Congress in
April in an effort to draw enough men to meet their
manpower needs.
But while Laird announced the goal Pentagon officials
indicated it is an open question whether they can enlist
enough volunteers to keep the draft that low.
Deserter Statistics Noted
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon, objecting to any general
grant of amnesty for Vietnam war resisters, said yesterday
that more than 50,000 men have deserted the armed
forces or violated draft laws in the Vietnam era.
Currently there are an estimated 30,000 deserters, a
Pentagon official said at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee
hearing.
The assistant secretary of defense for personnel, Maj.
Gen. Lee Benade, said that the figure includes 2,232 men
who have deserted to such foreign countries as Sweden,
Canada and Mexico.

"Of those who have deserted to other countries less
than 4.1 percent were motivated by anti-Vietnam or
political protest," Benade said.
As of Feb. 14, he said, there were 4,201 fugitives who
had been indicted or named in criminal complaints for
alleged violations of the Selective Service laws.
He said that at the end of January there were 5,901
defendants against whom indictments were pending and
12,333 other pending cases referred to the Justice
Department by the Selective Service system for
prosecution.
McCloskey Attacks Kliendienst
CONCORD, N.H. — Republican presidential hopeful Rep.
Paul N. McCloskey (R-Calif.) yesterday called for the
Senate Judiciary Committee to reopen hearings on the
nomination of Richard Kleindienst as attorney general to
learn about an alleged $400,000 pledge to help finance
the Republican National Convention.
The committee will hear Kleindienst under oath today
but has said it is not reopening his nomination hearing.
McCloskey, who is challenging President Nixon's
renomination, told newsmen here yesterday that former
Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell should be called along with
Kleindienst to "appear before Congress under oath."
Meantime, the Judiciary Committee said in Washington
that Deputy Atty. Gen. Kleindienst would testify under
oath today as it examines reports by columnist Jack
Anderson that the Justice Department dropped antitrust
action against International Telephone & Telegraph Co.,
after an ITT subsidiary pledged $400,000 for the GOP
convention next August in San Diego.
Kleindienst, whose nomination to succeed Mitchell has
already been unanimously approved by the committee,
requested the unusual hearing, Chairman James O.
Eastland (D-Miss.), told a newsman yesterday.
Mitchell and ITT have denied Anderson's allegations.
Chair-man Richard L. Herman of the GOP
Arrangements Committee planning for the August
convention in San Diego said the party would not accept
"such a disproportionate share of the expenses from one
source" as $400,000.
Berrigan Informer Produces Letters
HARRISBURG, Pa. — The Rev. Philip Berrigan's initial
piiority as a militant anti-war leader was the blowing up
of heating tunnels in Washington, according to an
FBI-intercepted letter read yesterday at his trial.
The letter was turned over to the FBI by informer
Boyd Douglas, star government witness at the federal
conspiracy trial of Berrigan and six codefendants.
"Since resources appear available for the subterranean
project in the District this should have priority for the
winter of 1970-1971," Berrigan is quoted in one of more
than a dozen letters read into the trial report by Asst.
Gen. William Lynch.
However, less than two months later, the government
