# In CJP Case
## Shockley, Hearing Officer Feud 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Hearing officer Henry Ramsey
threatened to drop charges against
four defendants if Electrical
Engineering Professor William
Shockley refused to answer his
questions during the Campus Judicial
Panel hearings yesterday. Shockley
later returned to testify.
Shockley was one of a number of
prosecution witnesses recalled by
Ramsey for further questioning during
the hearings in which four students are
charged with participating in a January
18 disruption of Shockley's quantum
mechanics class. The four defendants
are Don Lee, Kwonping Ho, Gerry
Foote, and Alice Furumoto.
Ramsey told Shockley he would
"make a finding that there is no
evidence of disruption" because he
would "throw out all of the testimony

Ramsey then called a recess so that
Shockley could decide whether he

events, mused, "If it were a court of

law, you'd just throw him in jail until
he's ready to testify."
The dispute began when Shockley
continually objected to the relevance
of Ramsey's questions concerning the
discussion of Shockley's genetic
theories during the protest.
Ramsey told him, "You are a
witness and your role as a witness is to
answer questions which are put to you
and not to rule as to whether they are
relevant or not. That is my function as
a hearing officer."
When testimony resumed, Shockley
responded to a defense question of
whether he had been willing to rebut
statements made by the protesters by
saying, "I was more than willing: I
took action." He stated that when he
saw the class could not continue, he
thought he should "clear up the
