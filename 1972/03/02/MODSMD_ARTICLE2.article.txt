# In CJP Case
## Shockley, Hearing Officer Feud 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Hearing officer Henry Ramsey
threatened to drop charges against
four defendants if Electrical
Engineering Professor William
Shockley refused to answer his
questions during the Campus Judicial
Panel hearings yesterday. Shockley
later returned to testify.
Shockley was one of a number of
prosecution witnesses recalled by
Ramsey for further questioning during
the hearings in which four students are
charged with participating in a January
18 disruption of Shockley's quantum
mechanics class. The four defendants
are Don Lee, Kwonping Ho, Gerry
Foote, and Alice Furumoto.
Ramsey told Shockley he would
"make a finding that there is no
evidence of disruption" because he
would "throw out all of the testimony

submitted by the University," when
Shockley refused to answer a question
about what the protesters were saying
to him during the incident.
Ramsey then called a recess so that
Shockley could decide whether he
would "cooperate" or not, before
angrily storming out of the room.
After a recess of more than half an
hour, Shockley returned to continue
his testimony.
'Too Harsh'
During the recess, Ramsey admitted
that his statement on dismissing all
prosecution testimony might have
been too harsh, since it was possible
the charge concerns not only a
grievance against Shockley but against
"the students and the University as
well."
Ramsey, perturbed at the turn of
events, mused, "If it were a court of

law, you'd just throw him in jail until
he's ready to testify."
The dispute began when Shockley
continually objected to the relevance
of Ramsey's questions concerning the
discussion of Shockley's genetic
theories during the protest.
Ramsey told him, "You are a
witness and your role as a witness is to
answer questions which are put to you
and not to rule as to whether they are
relevant or not. That is my function as
a hearing officer."
When testimony resumed, Shockley
responded to a defense question of
whether he had been willing to rebut
statements made by the protesters by
saying, "I was more than willing: I
took action." He stated that when he
saw the class could not continue, he
thought he should "clear up the
According to a report from Provost
William Miller, Shockley has recently
been granted $35,000 from individuals
and private foundations to extend his
research into the question of
hereditary vs. environmental aspects of
intelligence. Shockley is himself the

founder and president of an
organization involved in eugenics
study, the Foundation for Research
and Education on Eugenics and
Dysgenics (FREED).
Shockley is also one of FREED's
three directors, the others being John B.
deC. M. Saunders, former dean of the

University of California Medical
Center, and mental health researcher
A.E. Bennett.
Misinterpretations
Through it all, what does Shockley
see as the three major
misinterpretations of his work?
"First, there's the one that says,
'You think that all blacks are inferior
to all whites.' Another one is that,
'You're a clear-cut Aryan supremecist,'
although I find statistically in some
areas the American Orientals are
coming out ahead of the population as
a whole; certainly the Jews do.
"The other one is, 'You're
advocating genocide.' What I'm
advocating is thinking about humane
approaches that may have eugenic
implications.
"Far more action items are
attributed to me than I propose," he
says."I propose action in thinking."

Shockley refused to answer a question
about what the protesters were saying
to him during the incident.
Ramsey then called a recess so that
Shockley could decide whether he
would "cooperate" or not, before
angrily storming out of the room.
After a recess of more than half an
hour, Shockley returned to continue
his testimony.
'Too Harsh'
During the recess, Ramsey admitted
that his statement on dismissing all
prosecution testimony might have
been too harsh, since it was possible
the charge concerns not only a
grievance against Shockley but against
"the students and the University as
well."
Ramsey, perturbed at the turn of
events, mused, "If it were a court of

law, you'd just throw him in jail until
he's ready to testify."
The dispute began when Shockley
continually objected to the relevance
of Ramsey's questions concerning the
discussion of Shockley's genetic
theories during the protest.
Ramsey told him, "You are a
witness and your role as a witness is to
answer questions which are put to you
and not to rule as to whether they are
relevant or not. That is my function as
a hearing officer."
When testimony resumed, Shockley
responded to a defense question of
whether he had been willing to rebut
statements made by the protesters by
saying, "I was more than willing: I
took action." He stated that when he
saw the class could not continue, he
thought he should "clear up the
According to a report from Provost
William Miller, Shockley has recently
been granted $35,000 from individuals
and private foundations to extend his
research into the question of
hereditary vs. environmental aspects of
intelligence. Shockley is himself the

founder and president of an
organization involved in eugenics
study, the Foundation for Research
and Education on Eugenics and
Dysgenics (FREED).
Shockley is also one of FREED's
three directors, the others being John B.
deC. M. Saunders, former dean of the

University of California Medical
Center, and mental health researcher
A.E. Bennett.
Misinterpretations
Through it all, what does Shockley
see as the three major
misinterpretations of his work?
"First, there's the one that says,
'You think that all blacks are inferior
to all whites.' Another one is that,
'You're a clear-cut Aryan supremecist,'
although I find statistically in some
areas the American Orientals are
coming out ahead of the population as
a whole; certainly the Jews do.
"The other one is, 'You're
advocating genocide.' What I'm
advocating is thinking about humane
approaches that may have eugenic
implications.
"Far more action items are
attributed to me than I propose," he
says."I propose action in thinking."
Hearing officer Henry Ramsey
threatened to drop charges against
four defendants if Electrical
Engineering Professor William
Shockley refused to answer his
questions during the Campus Judicial
Panel hearings yesterday. Shockley
later returned to testify.
Shockley was one of a number of
prosecution witnesses recalled by
Ramsey for further questioning during
the hearings in which four students are
charged with participating in a January
18 disruption of Shockley's quantum
mechanics class. The four defendants
are Don Lee, Kwonping Ho, Gerry
Foote, and Alice Furumoto.
