# Angela Davis Trial
## Attorneys Ask Juror Pay 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Angela Davis' attorneys asked the
court in San Jose yesterday to "find
ways to compensate working people,
so working people could serve on the
jury" of her four-to-six month trial.
The prosecutor, Assistant State
Attorney General Albert Harris Jr.,
agreed with the proposal of chief
defense attorney Howard Moore Jr.
Harris said he would "very much like
to see such a situation" if funds were
available and the plan is legal. But no
action was taken on the
unprecedented plan.
"We don't want to end up with a
bunch of wealthy people here and no
working people," defense attorney
Leo Branton argued during the third
day of a wearying jury selection
process which may take a month or
more.
Hardships
Yesterday, three persons cited
financial hardships as the main reason
they could not serve on the jury and
two others included lost wages among
other problems. Others cited medical
and personal problems.

In all, fourteen prospective jurors
were excused yesterday, bringing the
total of rejected jurors to more than
30 out of the first random pool of 120
registered voters summoned to the
trial.
Two jurors were excused after
conceding under questioning that they
were prejudiced against Davis by
pre-trial publicity concerning the black
Communist and her trial on charges of
murder, kidnapping and conspiracy.
By the end of yesterday's session,
nine jurors had passed the first round
of questioning. But a number of those
will probably be replaced during
further questioning in the weeks
ahead.
Threat
Robert C. McCarty, an income tax
accountant with Southern Pacific
Railroad, said that Communists are "a
threat to our society, to our way of
life."
But he was allowed to stay on the
list of possible jurors after insisting, "I
could give Miss Davis a fair trial. I
really believe that."
The judge also retained Maty

Borelli, a grey-haired housewife who
said she had no definite opinions
against Communists because she did
not know enough about them to
define the word.
Harris noted that there were a
number of empty press and spectator
seats in the courtroom during the
morning session. The grueling
sameness of the jury questioning
seemed to be one reason for extra
space in the 67-seat courtroom.
In the afternoon, Moore noted that
the courtroom was nearly full. He
objected that seats were left empty
because spectators were only allowed
to enter 30 minutes before the 9:30
a.m. and 1:30 p.m. sessions.
The prospective witnesses
reportedly chatted and played cards in
a room above the courtroom as they
waited to be brought down for
individual questioning.
Several student-aged men and
women reportedly remain among the
prospective jurors still to be
questioned. Five college students have
been excused already after citing
medical or academic problems.

In all, fourteen prospective jurors
were excused yesterday, bringing the
total of rejected jurors to more than
30 out of the first random pool of 120
registered voters summoned to the
trial.
Two jurors were excused after
conceding under questioning that they
were prejudiced against Davis by
pre-trial publicity concerning the black
Communist and her trial on charges of
murder, kidnapping and conspiracy.
By the end of yesterday's session,
nine jurors had passed the first round
of questioning. But a number of those
will probably be replaced during
further questioning in the weeks
ahead.
Threat
Robert C. McCarty, an income tax
accountant with Southern Pacific
Railroad, said that Communists are "a
threat to our society, to our way of
life."
But he was allowed to stay on the
list of possible jurors after insisting, "I
could give Miss Davis a fair trial. I
really believe that."
The judge also retained Maty

Borelli, a grey-haired housewife who
said she had no definite opinions
against Communists because she did
not know enough about them to
define the word.
Harris noted that there were a
number of empty press and spectator
seats in the courtroom during the
morning session. The grueling
sameness of the jury questioning
seemed to be one reason for extra
space in the 67-seat courtroom.
In the afternoon, Moore noted that
the courtroom was nearly full. He
objected that seats were left empty
because spectators were only allowed
to enter 30 minutes before the 9:30
a.m. and 1:30 p.m. sessions.
The prospective witnesses
reportedly chatted and played cards in
a room above the courtroom as they
waited to be brought down for
individual questioning.
Several student-aged men and
women reportedly remain among the
prospective jurors still to be
questioned. Five college students have
been excused already after citing
medical or academic problems.
Angela Davis' attorneys asked the
court in San Jose yesterday to "find
ways to compensate working people,
so working people could serve on the
jury" of her four-to-six month trial.
The prosecutor, Assistant State
Attorney General Albert Harris Jr.,
agreed with the proposal of chief
defense attorney Howard Moore Jr.
Harris said he would "very much like
to see such a situation" if funds were
available and the plan is legal. But no
action was taken on the
unprecedented plan.
"We don't want to end up with a
bunch of wealthy people here and no
working people," defense attorney
Leo Branton argued during the third
day of a wearying jury selection
process which may take a month or
more.
Hardships
Yesterday, three persons cited
financial hardships as the main reason
they could not serve on the jury and
two others included lost wages among
other problems. Others cited medical
and personal problems.
