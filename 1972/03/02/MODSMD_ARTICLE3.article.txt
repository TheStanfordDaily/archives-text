# Overseas Requirements Dropped, Low Enrollment Leads To Change
## 
### DAN BRENNER SCOTT THACHER 
Virtually all course requirements
for students at Stanford's five overseas
campuses will be dropped, according
to a policy recently adopted by the
Committee on Foreign Study.
The policy, which yill go into
effect with students going overseas
next quarter, ends the fairly restrictive
course requirements at the foreign

campuses, including the requirement
of six units in language courses each
quarter.
Instead, the only remaining
requirement will be a first-quarter
conversation course in the native
language for those persons who do not
demonstrate a minimum proficiency.
In addition, a student will be able
to take from five to nine units in
independent studies under the
direction of a professor from the home
campus.
These academic requirement
changes reflect an attempt to revitalize
the Overseas Campus Program, which
has been experiencing a dip in
enrollment at some campuses. ''The
sagging attendance was a spur to
looking at the program as a whole,"
Corbin Smith, assistant director of the
Overseas Campuses, notes.
While enrollment increased the
pressure to re-examine the program,
Smith adds that the change of
requirements "was not done to draw
more persons into the program."
The impact of the changes will not
be felt immediately.
The future may see students at the
French campus enrolling at the nearby
University of Tours; special programs
at the music academy in Vienna; or
study at artists' studios in Florence.
Smith isn't sure that all these programs
will be working within six months,
however. He adds that, "It is not a lot
to say that you have freedom to
choose if there's not a lot to choose
from."
The independent studies option

hopefully will go beyond the
traditional "directed reading"
offerings. For example, next quarter
two students from the Business School
will conduct a project on international
business while attending the Austrian
campus.
While two Stanford professors now
accompany each group overseas, the
number could decrease for future
groups if there is not heavy interest in
their courses. However, Smith notes,
"I don't think there will be a
wholesale rush to do independent
projects."
A declining interest in the Overseas
program, reflected in sagging
enrollment, has been an obvious
source of pressure for the change. The
Vienna campus has been hardest hit by
low enrollment. In 1967-68, 160
students, the maximum, went to the
Austrian campus, but within the last
three years the figure has dwindled to
123. And only 35 students are going
for the next session in Germany this
summer; enrollment has usually been

about 75 per session. On the other
hand, Smith reports that there is a
waiting list for those wishing to attend
the next winter session in Germany.
The Overseas Campus Program was
for a long time ahead of the University
in such innovations as co-ed housing,
smaller classes, and emphasis on
learning outside the classroom. But as
the University began to change,
especially when General Studies
requirements were greatly eased three
years ago, the program was slow to
reflect this flexibility.
Richard Breeden, chairman of
subcommittee for France of the
Foreign Studies committee, feels that
a full-time staff member should be
responsible for working on future
goals and programs for the overseas
program.
"All the top administrators are
swamped with paper work," Breeden
says. "Everyone in the office is too
busy worrying about what's going to
happen tomorrow to worry about
what's going to happen next year."
