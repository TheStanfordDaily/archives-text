# Shockley Plait: Thought Exercise Or Genocide?
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY (Second of two parts 
Of all the plans advocated by
genetic theorist and Nobel
Prize-winning physicist Dr. William
Shockley, probably none is more
controversial than his so-called
"voluntary sterilization program."
This would grant to a person
voluntarily undergoing sterilization
$1000 for each point the person's IQ
fell below 100. Thus, a person with an
IQ of 70 undergoing sterilization
would be given a trust fund of
$30,000.
At a rally last month, the Third
World Coalition Against Shockley (a
loosely-constructed group comprising
several Stanford minority
organizations) attacked his plan as "a
practical political weapon to use
against every black person in this
country and throughout the world."
"We know what he means: white
racism in practice," said the Coalition
in a statement tacked to President
Lyman's office door. The resolution
described the plan as a program to
"pay black people not to reproduce,
so as to limit and control the
population of those 'predictably unfit'
to live in this society."
Thinking Exercise
Shockley, however, terms the idea
"a thinking exercise," and says that he
"would advocate practically nothing
for action, but I would advocate
discussion." He concedes that "I don't
find much wrong with this voluntary
sterilization bonus plan," but he
admits that there may be flaws in the
plan that would come to light in a
discussion.

"The point is that the subject is so
emotionally loaded now that the
discussion tends not to be objective
and exploratory." He cites a recent
article in Presbyterian Life magazine,
called "An American Final Solution,"
as "not in my opinion a rational
attack."
The article said of Shockley, "We
could simply point to his incredible
arrogance as a man of intelligence. But
we must report that Shockley is a
self-revealed and unashamed racist."
The article includes Shockley's
contention that the greater the
percentage of Caucasian genes in a
black person, the higher the person's
IQ will be, and adds that "he does not
comment on whether black genes give
you rhythm, make you good at
singing, dancing, and sports, or make
you happy-go-lucky."
Shockley also deems the two recent
disruptions of his engineering class
irrational, emphasizing, however, that
his views of the protesters' motivations
are "completely irrelevant" to the
facts involved in the disciplinary
hearings currently being conducted by
the Campus Judicial Panel.
Not Balanced
"I think the students who are most
disruptive here may not have the best
minds in terms of balance, objectivity,
and analysis. I think they're probably
well above population average. I
wouldn't know where to put them in
respect to the average intellectual
capacity among Stanford students, but
I would suspect it's not really at the
top," he says.
"But I think they have more
initiative, and they may very well have

more feelings and more social concern,
and I think if they look at the
situation as it is now, they're entirely
sound in coming to the conclusion
that the American system as they can
see it is lacking in integrity and
objectivity and maybe conscience."
He blames this situation on "the
faculty and the National Academy of
Sciences" for their lack of
"intellectual integrity."
Shockley feels, however, that the
disruptions and the failure of the NAS
to approve a resolution calling for
more research in the area may be
causing a backlash of sympathy.
"I've noticed, especially since this
rally (the Third World Coalition rally
of February 16, when Shockley was
burned in effigy) that more students
will smile at me or speak to me."
Shockley sees other actions,
perhaps not as covert as classroom
disruptions, as being nevertheless
infringements on his academic
freedom.
SWOPSI Course
He attacks as "deplorable" the
"negative reaction" to a course
proposal on genetics and intelligence
he submitted to the Stanford
Workshop on Political and Social
Issues (SWOPSI) governing board.
He submitted the course at the
suggestion of SWOPSI director Dan
Lewis. However, the board, which
normally approves classes by
consensus, was unable to reach an
agreement on the proposal after three
meetings, for what Shockley terms
"reasons not concerned with the
search for truth, but with side issues."
' Lewis admits that the possibility

such a class might be disrupted was
discussed, but denies that it was an
overriding factor in the considerations.
He said that among the board's
concerns was the fact that the
proposal had no "student-input," and
appealed for student feedback on the
idea.
"Whether he [Shockley 112 has a right
to teach at Stanford is a different issue
from whether SWOPSI should offer
the course," said Lewis, adding that
Shockley can resubmit his proposal for
Autumn quarter.
Grad Inquiry
A graduate special on genetics and
intelligence proposed by Shockley last
summer is currently being evaluated
by a committee appointed last month
by Graduate Dean Lincoln Moses, with
a decision due in about two weeks.
Shockley has requested time to
present oral arguments to the
committee, saying in a letter to Dean
Moses that his proposal has been dealt
with in "what. . . amounts to star
chamber proceedings." He said that if
this was true, it would be "a
blemish ... on the proud history of
Stanford."
The evaluating committee, chaired
by Biology professor Colin
Pittendrigh, is the first such board to
be established under new procedures
adopted by Moses. It will examine the
course proposal against several criteria,
including whether the material to be
covered is of "sufficient intellectual
merit," and whether the instructor is
"competent to teach the proposed
course," according to Moses' list of
guidelines.

DISRUPTED—Dr. William Shockley's class in electrical engineering has been
disrupted twice this year, once by demonstrators clad in white sheets who
proclaimed themselves the Stanford chapter of the Ku Klux Klan.
