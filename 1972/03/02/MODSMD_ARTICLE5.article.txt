Debate
(Editor's note: This letter u>as
sent to French and Italian
Department Chairman, Raymond
Giraud.)
Dear Professor Giraud:
This letter is written in
response to our recent telephone
conversation concerning the
possibilities of my debating with
Professor William Shockley of the
Engineering Department. As I
indicated to you, some of the
conditions which Professor
Shockley has established for such
a debate are totally unacceptable
to me; these include (a) his
insistence on being the judge of
the academic qualifications of his
debaters and (b) his insistence
that a kind of "trial" debate be
held behind closed doors, prior to
any public debate.
If Professor Shockley would be
willing to participate in an open
and public debate with myself and
two colleagues of my choosing (I
will, of course, permit him the
same privilege), I would be happy
to have the Faculty Political
Action Group — perhaps in
conjunction with Stanford's Black
Student Union — sponsor such an
event.
As I indicated to you, my own
research has not been concerned
with questions of racial
differences in intelligence, since I
have never had any reason to
question the intellectual capacities
of Black Americans. Because of
this, I would prefer that the
debate be held sometime early
during the Spring Quarter so as to
permit me and my colleagues to
thoroughly read the research
related to this "problem."

Fee Assessment
Editor, THE DAILY:
Since every other worthy
group is seeking financial support
via student fee assessments, I
decided to get my request in
before the market became
saturated.
My proposed business venture
is called Hamburger Stand of
Stanford, Inc., and will be located
in Hoboken, New Jersey. Of
course it will be only partly
student run, and I will disavow
any association with Stanford
University — even though there is
broad-based concern and active
interest in hamburgers here in
Palo Alto.
The hamburger stand will
refuse to provide food for
Stanford students. In fact, it will
only servo selected minorities such
as the French Foreign Legion and
members of the D.B. Cooper Fan
Club.
As you may have guessed, I do
not hold sufficient capital to
begin this venture. Therefore, I
request that student fee
assessments be used to finance my
noble semi-profitable intentions.
Funding requirements are minimal

— I only desire $50 per student,
each academic quarter from now
until 1997.
Note that I am seeking this
assessment for a period of 25
years instead of the customary
one. This is necessary to ensure
that I have gleaned the maximum
amount of money out of the
students before they realize they
have been duped.
One would normally expect a
small business loan or government
grant be used to finance a public
service like a hamburger stand.
But here, the students are so
gullible . . . excuse me, I mean
hungry for social concern, an
exhorbitant fee assessment is the
only way to fly.

Editor, THE DAILY:
We would like to reply to
Spyros Andreopoulos' letter to
the Daily, Tues. Feb. 29, who
showed to be ignorant of Greek
history and obviously blatant liar.
We thus invite him to look up
some elementary material in
newspaper accounts of the Greek
Civil War events — most notably
the N.Y. Times of that period —
and books, most of which his
beloved Junta has skillfully
outlawed. We are asking him to
publicly apologize for his
ignorance and the harm he caused
to the memory of the Greek
people's struggle for dignity and
sovereignty.
He refers to "elections,
conducted under U.N.
supervision, (in which) the Greek
communists got less than 12% of
the vote". The facts are as
follows: Elections were planned
for March 1946. The growing
terrorism made electoral
campaigning difficult if not
impossible for anyone but the
Right. Not only the Communists
but the Centrists, too, denied the
electoral farce. Many cabinet
members resigned and demanded
postponement until normality
could be obtained. But the British
imperialists denied it. The
Communists and a large section of
the (Centrist) Republicans
decided to abstain. Two days after
the nomination deadline a
considerable fraction of the Left
decided to reconsider and asked
for the deadline to be extended.
The British imperialists denied the
request. (Who ran the counry?).
The Populist Party, a right-wing
pro-monarchy formation, won an
absolute majority by getting
600,000 votes with 1,100,000
voting out of 2,200,000 of the
electoral roll. If, then, one takes
into account the large number of
NLF (EAM) supporters who were
not registered, the extended
multiple voting practiced by the
Rightists and the climate of open
terror, the so-called white terror,
the discrepancy between
Parliament and public opinion is
best manifest. We do not condone
the attrocities nor the CP leaders'

decision to resort to Civil War.
But this man's misrepresentation
of history is at least outrageous.
In his forthcoming public
apology, he should inform the
Stanford Community about how
the Rightists used those
abstention lists since 1947.
Yes, American soldiers did not
fight in Greece during the Civil
War period. But, where did the
money and the "advice" come
from?
Greek mountains are not bare
because of napalm only. Napalm,
in its infant form, was indeed
tested in Greece for the first time.
For the magnitude of the
destruction of forests he could
consult special publications of the
United Nations as well as the
Greek Army Chiefs of Staff.
Dr. Papandreou was forced to
leave Greece for political and
ideological reasons during the
barbaric Metaxas dictatorship.
Before the end of the war he
volunteered and served for two
years in the U.S. Navy.
Finally, we think it is
unfortunate that an information
officer of the Medical School of
Stanford University can dare
publish such blatant lies. The holy
memory of the victims of the
internal strife deserve better
treatment. Well, what would one
possibly expect from a petty
reactionary greek-american?
