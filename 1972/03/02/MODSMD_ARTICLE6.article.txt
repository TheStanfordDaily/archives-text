# selective prosecutions
## CJP Discipline Or Justice? 
### 
Jofe braunstein

I have been told that there are still some
members of the community who expect that
justice can be achieved from the new Campus
Judicial Panel (CJP). Now that the CJP is
hearing arguments on the jurisdiction and
fairness of the system, I shall present the
evidence on one issue — selective prosecution.
Forgetting about details such as who
conducts the hearings or who decides the
punishment, let us look at who gets charged in
the first place — anti-war demonstrators,
"left-wing" students, and then compare this
with who doesn't get charged.
Take the case of Ray White, usually
present at anti-war demonstrations, graduate
student (advisor, Paul Ehrlich) in the biology
department (Chairman, Donald Kennedy).
White has on numerous occasions testified
about demonstrators and identified alleged
demonstrators for the administration. He has
been seen behind police lines at several
demonstrations.
Last quarter the Daily used one-half of one
front page to report the testimony of White at
the Franklin hearing. His testimony attracted
attention not because of what it revealed of
Franklin's activities, but rather because of the
information it provided about the actions of
White and his Free Campus Movement.
In April, 1970, an anonymous note was
placed in the mailbox of a graduate student
who had spoken at a rally a few days earlier
advocating massive non-violent action to
remove ROTC from Stanford. The
handwritten note said "Perhaps you should
know (as an open advocate of terrorism) that
I (or we) possess knowledge of your home
address" and was signed "Local latent
rednecks — P.S. cool it."
During that summer the recipient of the

note and I obtained the first evidence that
Ray White was the author. We arranged for a
preliminary comparison of the writing and
printing on the note with an affidavit signed
by White and his handwring on the form
registering the Free Campus Movement with
the Dean of Students.
The comparison was done by a criminology
student at the University of California who
had studied handwriting. The match was so
certain that on the basis of this preliminary
report several individuals approached faculty
members in White's department after they
supported White who was allegedly on the
receiving end of similar threats. Nothing was
done — no hearing, not even anyone willing to
look at the evidence.
Following the Hospital sit-in of last year,
several leaflets attacking the participants and
other radicals and containing false
information about them appeared on kiosks
on campus. The writing and typing on these
leaflets was so familiar to the few of us that
had looked into the case of the threatening
note, that we were surprised at the stupidity
or the arrogance of the author. Again, an
effort was made to go through proper
university channels — we gave the Dean's
office copies of the leaflets and told them that
we could show who the author was. The only
response was a letter to me from Bill Stone
saying that there were no adequate rules to
cover the problem and asking if I had any
proposals.
Finally, all the evidence, this time verified
by the foremost expert in document analysis
in the State of California was brought out at
the Franklin hearings when White was called
by the Administration to help "prove" its
case. The original note and two leaflets, the

samples of White's handwriting, and the
signed document analysis were examined and
admitted into evidence. The University
lawyers did not contest their validity.
White flatly denied sending the note and
refused to answer questions about the leaflets.
But although the University has brought
five anti-war demonstrators to trial this month
for violation of the Fundamental Standard,
Ray White goes unchallenged.
Is it possible that the evidence did not
present a sufficient case to warrant White's
being tried by the CJP at least for perjury? Or
is it more likely that no one with the power to
bring charges is interested in trying White?
Is it in fact, that White's "world view" is
the same as that of the Administration: a view
that finds that threats, malicious statements,
and lies are an integral part of the University
while demonstrations in an effort to enforce a
student referendum barring recruitment by
war profiteers are antithetical to the nature of
the institution? Apparently it is not a
violation of the Fundamental Standard to
send anonymous threatening notes to a fellow
student and to circulate inflamatory unsigned
leaflets giving false information. Apparently,
it is also not a violation of the Fundamental
Standard to lie — that is, to commit perjury —
in testimony at a University conducted
hearing.
It is clear that the Administration now
considers the CJP to be a mechanism for
"discipline" not "justice" and will only bring
such cases to it that threaten the ties of
Stanford to the military and corporations and
the administration's divine authority over our
lives.

is it more likely that no one with the power to
bring charges is interested in trying White?
Is it in fact, that White's "world view" is
the same as that of the Administration: a view
that finds that threats, malicious statements,
and lies are an integral part of the University
while demonstrations in an effort to enforce a
student referendum barring recruitment by
war profiteers are antithetical to the nature of
the institution? Apparently it is not a
violation of the Fundamental Standard to
send anonymous threatening notes to a fellow
student and to circulate inflamatory unsigned
leaflets giving false information. Apparently,
it is also not a violation of the Fundamental
Standard to lie — that is, to commit perjury —
in testimony at a University conducted
hearing.
It is clear that the Administration now
considers the CJP to be a mechanism for
"discipline" not "justice" and will only bring
such cases to it that threaten the ties of
Stanford to the military and corporations and
the administration's divine authority over our
lives.

I have been told that there are still some
members of the community who expect that
justice can be achieved from the new Campus
Judicial Panel (CJP). Now that the CJP is
hearing arguments on the jurisdiction and
fairness of the system, I shall present the
evidence on one issue — selective prosecution.
Forgetting about details such as who
conducts the hearings or who decides the
punishment, let us look at who gets charged in
the first place — anti-war demonstrators,
"left-wing" students, and then compare this
with who doesn't get charged.
Take the case of Ray White, usually
present at anti-war demonstrations, graduate
student (advisor, Paul Ehrlich) in the biology
department (Chairman, Donald Kennedy).
White has on numerous occasions testified
about demonstrators and identified alleged
demonstrators for the administration. He has
been seen behind police lines at several
demonstrations.
Last quarter the Daily used one-half of one
front page to report the testimony of White at
the Franklin hearing. His testimony attracted
attention not because of what it revealed of
Franklin's activities, but rather because of the
information it provided about the actions of
White and his Free Campus Movement.
In April, 1970, an anonymous note was
placed in the mailbox of a graduate student
who had spoken at a rally a few days earlier
advocating massive non-violent action to
remove ROTC from Stanford. The
handwritten note said "Perhaps you should
know (as an open advocate of terrorism) that
I (or we) possess knowledge of your home
address" and was signed "Local latent
rednecks — P.S. cool it."
During that summer the recipient of the

note and I obtained the first evidence that
Ray White was the author. We arranged for a
preliminary comparison of the writing and
printing on the note with an affidavit signed
by White and his handwring on the form
registering the Free Campus Movement with
the Dean of Students.
The comparison was done by a criminology
student at the University of California who
had studied handwriting. The match was so
certain that on the basis of this preliminary
report several individuals approached faculty
members in White's department after they
supported White who was allegedly on the
receiving end of similar threats. Nothing was
done — no hearing, not even anyone willing to
look at the evidence.
Following the Hospital sit-in of last year,
several leaflets attacking the participants and
other radicals and containing false
information about them appeared on kiosks
on campus. The writing and typing on these
leaflets was so familiar to the few of us that
had looked into the case of the threatening
note, that we were surprised at the stupidity
or the arrogance of the author. Again, an
effort was made to go through proper
university channels — we gave the Dean's
office copies of the leaflets and told them that
we could show who the author was. The only
response was a letter to me from Bill Stone
saying that there were no adequate rules to
cover the problem and asking if I had any
proposals.
Finally, all the evidence, this time verified
by the foremost expert in document analysis
in the State of California was brought out at
the Franklin hearings when White was called
by the Administration to help "prove" its
case. The original note and two leaflets, the

samples of White's handwriting, and the
signed document analysis were examined and
admitted into evidence. The University
lawyers did not contest their validity.
White flatly denied sending the note and
refused to answer questions about the leaflets.
But although the University has brought
five anti-war demonstrators to trial this month
for violation of the Fundamental Standard,
Ray White goes unchallenged.
Is it possible that the evidence did not
present a sufficient case to warrant White's
being tried by the CJP at least for perjury? Or
is it more likely that no one with the power to
bring charges is interested in trying White?
Is it in fact, that White's "world view" is
