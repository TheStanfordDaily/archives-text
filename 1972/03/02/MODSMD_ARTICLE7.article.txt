## NLRB Ballot Arrangemement Fair 
###

In a column in the Daily on
Friday, February 25, Jack
Gilderoy, Jr. criticized the format
of the election established by the
NLRB for the 1600 person unit.
In Mr. Gilderoy's view the ballot
devised by the NLRB is unfair
because an individual who wishes
to vote no is prevented from
expressing a preference for one of
the bargaining representatives in
the event a majority should desire
representation.
I agree with Mr. Gilderoy that
a ballot could be devised which
would do a better job of
permitting employees to express
all their preferences for each
contingency. I raised the question
with the NLRB myself, on behalf
of the Uniersity, several weeks ago
but was no more successful than
Mr. Gilderoy apparently has been.
Although I agree that it would
be possible to make the ballot
procedure better, I don't think
the present arrangement precludes
a fair election. To demonstrate
the point I think it is useful to
consider with several examples the
kinds of situations in which the
voters might be prejudiced by
being denied the opportunity to

state their second choice.
First, let's consider the
situation in which the first ballot
gives a final result so that there is
no run-off election. In order for
the first ballot to be final, one of
two results must occur: either one
union must win more than half
the valid votes cast or the
no-union choice must receive at
least half the valid votes cast. To
demonstrate, assume for the sake
of simplicity that there are 100
eligible voters in a unit, all of
whom vote on election day with
no challenge ballots. A final result
would be reached in either of the
following cases:
(a) Example No. 1:
Union A 51 votes
Union B 30 votes
Union C 4 votes
Union D 5 votes
None (no union) 10 votes
Total 100 votes
(b) Example No. 2:
None (no-union) 50 votes
Union A 15 votes
Union B 15 votes
Union C 15 votes
Union D 5 votes
Total 100 votes

In either of the above
examples, the results will express
the will of the majority so long as
each voter voted for his first
choice. Even if Mr. Gilderoy's
suggested ballot procedure were
followed and voters were given an
opportunity to state their second
choice in addition to their first
choice, the results would not be
changed. In Example No. 1 the
first choice of the majority of the
valid votes cast is for Union A.
Therefore, Union A wins and
would still win regardless of the
second choice of those who voted
differently. Similarly, in Example
No. 2 the None or No-Union
choice prevails because a union
cannot possibly get a majority if
the first choice of at least half of
the voters if for no-union. Thus in
neither case can the second choice
of the voters make any difference
even if it is counted. There is
consequently nothing unfair
about the NLRB balloting
procedure if the first ballot is
decisive.
Next, let's consider the
situation in which the results of
the first ballot are not decisive so
that a run-off election is
necessary. A run-off is necessary if
no union receives a majority of
the valid votes cast and less than
half of the valid votes cast are for
no union. In such an event, NLRB
rules require a run-off election
between the two choices receiving
the highest number of valid votes.
To demonstrate again assuming a
unit of 100 eligible voters all of
whom cast valid ballots with no
challenges, a run-off election

would be necessary with either of
the following examples:
(a) Example No. 3:
Union A 30 votes
Union B 29 votes
None (no-union) 28 votes
Union C 10 votes
Union D 3 votes
Total 100 votes
A run-off election would be
held with the only choices on the
run-off ballot being Union A and
Union B.
(b) Example No. 4:
None (no-union) 30 votes
Union A 29 votes
Union B 28 votes
Union C 10 votes
Union D 3 votes
Total 100 votes
A run-off election would be
held with the only choices on the
ballot being Union A and None
(No-Union).
Second Choice
In either Example 3 or
Example 4, Mr. Gilderoy's
suggested method of permitting
voters to express their second
choice could make a difference in
deciding what choices were on the
run-off ballot. In Example 3 it is
possible that the ten employees
who voted for Union C would
have preferred No-Union if they
could not have Union C. If they
were permitted to express this
second choice then the run-off
could include the No-Union
option rather than a choice
between two unions only.
Similarly in Example 4 it is
possible that the ten employees
who voted for Union C would
have preferred Union B as a
second choice in preference to

both No-Union and Union A.
The problem which Mr.
Gilderoy raises presents possible
inequities only with a run-off
situation. The difficulty stems
from the NLRB rule which
requires a run-off between the top
two choices only and does not
consider employees second
choices in deciding which two
choices should be on the second
ballot. Mr. Gilderoy has expressed
his concern for the NLRB's
seeming inflexibility in refusing to
change its rule for the upcoming
elections at Stanford. I have
discovered that, unfortuantely,
the NLRB cannot change the
run-off procedure, even though it
should because the procedure is
written into the National Labor
Relations Act itself. Section
9(C)(3) of the National Labor
Relations Act provides in part as
follows:
"In any election where none of
the choices on the ballot receives
a majority, a run-off shall be
conducted, the ballot providing
for a selection between the two
choices receiving the largest and
second largest number of valid
votes cast in the election."
Congress
Only Congress can change this
provision and I doubt it could do
it before the election. I also doubt
that a court would enjoin the
NLRB from holding the elections
in a way which conforms with the
statute.
Certainly we all hope the
elections will accurately express
the will of the majority of all
voters in each unit. Because of the
point raised by Mr. Gilderoy there
admittedly is a slight chance the
results will not express the will of
the majority if there is a run-off. I
think what all voters should
resolve to do, however, is to
encourage every eligible person to
vote on March 7.
There is a very substantial
danger that the election results
will not express the will of the
majority if all eligible employees
do not vote. The election will be
decided by the majority of the
valid votes cast. There's probably
not much chance of changing the
law in time to solve the problem
raised by Mr. Gilderoy. If
everyone votes, we can avoid
having the crucial issue of
collective bargaining
representation decided by less
than a majority of people in each
unit.
Vote March 7.
