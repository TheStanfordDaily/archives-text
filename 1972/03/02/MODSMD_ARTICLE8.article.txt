## Thailand: Roots Of Polarization 
### 
concerned asian scholars

The importance of Thailand
looms increasingly large within
the context of American
perspectives for Southeast Asian
development. The military and
political situations in Indochina
are hopeless for the U.S. and the
regimes depending on American
support; Thailand now draws at
least $195 million in U.S. private
investment compared with $25
million in 1960; she has received
$2 billion in U.S. public
assistance, at least 75% of which
goes for military purposes; finally,
U.S. air bases in Thai territory
continue to be vital to American
interests in the region. As the
Americans are forced to withdraw
from Indochina, ("withdraw"
possibly implying only
repatriation of troops with
continued utilization of air
power), the U.S. will attempt to
make a political and economic
stand in Thailand and Indonesia,
the geographical position of
Thailand rendering her role both
more vulnerable and vital.
In order to roughly assess the
probable causes and consequences
of the November 17, 1971 coup,
it is useful to first describe in very
general terms the major social
forces presently active in
Thailand:
1. Military: Military leadership
began playing a vital role in Thai
politics at the time of the 1932
revolution which proclaimed a
constitutional monarchy. By
1947, civilian opposition was
essentially swept away and since
then military officers have
completely dominated the
political life of Thailand, giving
the country a consistent pro-U.S.
foreign policy, encouraging
foreign investment, and receiving
large amounts of U.S. aid. The
strength of the military is derived
from its cohesive organization,
foreign military aid, and the lack
of any social group willing or able
to challenge it. (No bourgeois
class with any political potential
has arisen, major commercial
functions down to the lowest
market level being dominated by
Chinese with little interest in or
legal right to political activity).
Structure
2. Bureaucracy: Part of
Thailand's remarkable political
stability on local and provincial
levels has been due to the
existence of a solid bureaucratic
structure. Since World War II the
bureaucracy has been greatly
enlarged numerically, providing
avenues of mobility for local elites
but at the same time growing
more and more inefficient. The
structure has traditionally been
conservative and static, the chief
career goals of its members being
assignment in Bangkok.
Bureaucratic attitudes toward the
peasantry up until a few years ago
can be characterized as benign
neglect, but such a tradition has
lately begun to cause problems
with the onrush of government
sponsored and U.S. financed
development programs, in part
created by American & Thai
realization of the importance of
village control, necessitating
increased official presence in the
villages. Except for the years
between 1932 and 1947, the
bureaucracy has presented little
threat to military dominance, the
two groups tending to be
mutually supportive politically
and economically in their desire
for a continuation of the status
quo.
3. Peasantry: Farmers make up
over 75% of Thailand's population
and have been traditionally docile
in terms of politics. The one or
two peasant uprisings recorded
before the late 1950's took palce
in a limited area as a result of
government efforts to extend
state sponsored religious influence
and organization. Low population
(now increasing at a high rate),
the absence of landed nobility,
good climate, and generally rich
natural resources usually provided
the Thai peasant with sufficient
land to grow rice and perhaps a
dry season crop sufficient to feed
himself and sell a portion to the
local Chinese middleman for
eventual export. One qualification
to this statement is the growth of
absentee landlordism in the rich

central plain where, since the late
1800's, irrigation and rice export
made land a profitable
investment, while peasants began
loosing their land due to their
inability to deal with the credit
and money economy following
the influx of cheap foreign goods.
Such an influx was a consequence
of a series of unequal treaties
imposed on Thailand in the
1860's and 1870's by the
imperialist powers, (including the
U.S.), and erased in the late
1930'5. It is also necessary to
mention the ethnic minorities —
Lao's in the northeast, hill tribes
in the north, and Malay in the
South — all three minority victims
of poor administration.
4. Members of Parliament: This
is a difficult group to describe due
to its heterogeneity and ability to
be absorbed into the bureaucracy
when the parliament is dissolved
and the military clamps down on
national and provincial
opposition. It is relatively weak in
the sense that most MP's have no
real power base, (i.e. land,
industry, outside the official
bureaucratic structure. In spite of
its somewhat unstable nature, this
group has grown in importance
due to its increasing intrusion into
areas of traditional military and
bureaucratic perrogative.
Coup
The coup in question took
place on Nov. 17 when 4 tanks
and around 50 soldiers
surrounded the Parliament
building. The Parliament itself was
dissolved along with political
parties and the 1968 constitution.
The government radio announced
a return to stability under the
"Revolutionary Party,"
headquartered in the site of the
military's Supreme
Command — Forward
Headquarters. The national
leadership itself has not changed,
with the 5 principal cabinet
members (all military men),
comprising the post-coup
leadership group. What then were
the causes of the coup? In broad
terms they include factional
conflict within the military
dominated cabinet, military and
bureaucratic resentment at an
increasingly bothersome
parliament, and a general
atmosphere of instability brought
on by growing insurgent activity,
economic decline, and the
forementioned opposition of the
MP's.
Factional conflict was
probably the immediate cause of
the coup. Junior and middle level
military supporters of General
Praphat Charusatian, anxious to
strengthen themselves and their
leader for the time when Field
Marshall Thanom Kittikachorn
steps down from his leadership
post, probably initiated the action
with Praphat's approval. Field
Marshall Thanom was allegedly
able to control events in time and
give where he had to, but the
present situation clearly
represents an increase in power
for Praphat, who added the
Defense Ministry to his position as
Minister of Interior and further
consolidated his control of the
Army. There was thus movement
within the leadership even if the
group itself did not change. And
the very unity which the group
did display, enabling Field
Marshall Thenom to mediate, was
due to a common suspicion of
parliamentary activity by the

military elite and most of the
bureaucracy. The MP's had
become increasingly vocal and
effective in their oppositon, not
so much on general development
or foreign policy alternatives, but
on specific projects or budget
allocations.
In fact, opposition from the
government's own party, based on
members' resentment at not
receiving increased development
funds allocated only to
government supporters), would
have helped defeat the
government's budget had not the
coup dissolved the parliament
before a vote could take place. It
must also be stated that many
bureaucratic non-military Thais,
including peasants, were upset by
what was perceived to be
parliamentary irresponsibility.
The King, a weak but
symbolically useful figure,
contributed to such perception by
his support of the military's
actions. The last factor, a general
atmosphere of instability in the
country, undoubtedly contributed
in a real way to the military's
belief that power had to be
exercised with no constraints, and
thus to the 'unity which aided
Praphat in his advancement.
Instability Useful
Moreover, the invocation of
this instability did serve as useful
and effective justification for the
present leadership's action. The
growth of the insurgencies based
in the ethnic minority areas of the
South, North, and Northeast is an
important factor. Such growth has
not only been in numbers, but
more vitally in the form of
extension of insurgent activities to
zones of ethnic Thais and in the
establishment of insurgent
organizations on the village level
in 1 Northern and 2 Northeastern
provinces. This is, of course,
aggravated by deteriorating
situations on the Burmese, Lao,
and Cambodian borders.
Finally, economic decline has
begun to create serious problems.
An undiversified Thai economy
can no longer export its rice
surpluses due to self sufficiency of
former importers, but more
importantly because of increasing
U.S. farm exports to traditionally
Thai markets. Thai foreign
reserves have been reduced by
almost $230 million in the last 3
years, and peasant incomes are
beginning to be affected.
Predictably, the Thai leadership
has tried to create suspicion of
Chinese businessmen based on the
economic situation, although pure
jingoism and use of the fifth
column threat also play a role.
In terms of the coup's
consequences, there should be
some sort of further power
consolidation by General Praphat
within a year. Although there will
probably be no major split within
the military, the military and
bureaucracy should become
increasingly isolated from other
political forces which their actions
help to create. A number of MP's
will probably be forced to the left
while the insurgencies may very
well attract increasing numers of
villagers, both by the insurgents'
own efforts and by the heavy
handed suppression of U.S.
trained and armed Thai forces
who have had combat experience
in Vietnam and Laos. Any
improvement of the economic
situation must come from a
reduction of U.S. rice exports or a

diversification of Thaiagricultures,
neither of which is likely given the
basis of U.S. policy and the
inefficiency of the Thai
bureaucracy. Continued foreign
investment in Thai primary
commodities will certainly not
alleviate the difficulties. The Thai
military is thus in one sense
weakened by The U.S., and in
another sense strengthened.
One scenario possibly
envisaged by U.S. planners would
be following: As rice exports
continued to decline and rural
areas become less safe, many
villagers will decide to leave their
farms and go into Bangkok where
manual labor jobs, created by
foreign investment, await them.
The Thai government will thus
reduce its presence in rural areas
and shift its bureaucratic stength
to the management of industry
and worker control. Continued
government presence would, of

course, have to be maintained in
rural areas where things like tin,
rubber, oil, etc. are found, but
this could be dealt with by the
construction of cities in those
zones. Meanwhile, those villagers
choosing to ally with the
insurgents could be handled by air
power.
Work done by U. S.
government-sponsored social
scientists already contains the
seeds of such a strategy. One
thing is highly probable:
increasing isolation of the
military-bureaucratic structures
within Thailand will be
accompanied by further
dependence on the U.S. and the
international organizations which
it controls. The situation is
vicious, tragic, and all the more
ironic for a country so proud of
never having been colonized.

consequences, there should be
some sort of further power
consolidation by General Praphat
within a year. Although there will
probably be no major split within
the military, the military and
bureaucracy should become
increasingly isolated from other
political forces which their actions
help to create. A number of MP's
will probably be forced to the left
while the insurgencies may very
well attract increasing numers of
villagers, both by the insurgents'
own efforts and by the heavy
handed suppression of U.S.
trained and armed Thai forces
who have had combat experience
in Vietnam and Laos. Any
improvement of the economic
situation must come from a
reduction of U.S. rice exports or a

diversification of Thaiagricultures,
neither of which is likely given the
basis of U.S. policy and the
inefficiency of the Thai
bureaucracy. Continued foreign
investment in Thai primary
commodities will certainly not
alleviate the difficulties. The Thai
military is thus in one sense
weakened by The U.S., and in
another sense strengthened.
One scenario possibly
envisaged by U.S. planners would
be following: As rice exports
continued to decline and rural
areas become less safe, many
villagers will decide to leave their
farms and go into Bangkok where
manual labor jobs, created by
foreign investment, await them.
The Thai government will thus
reduce its presence in rural areas
and shift its bureaucratic stength
to the management of industry
and worker control. Continued
government presence would, of

course, have to be maintained in
rural areas where things like tin,
rubber, oil, etc. are found, but
this could be dealt with by the
construction of cities in those
zones. Meanwhile, those villagers
choosing to ally with the
insurgents could be handled by air
power.
Work done by U. S.
government-sponsored social
scientists already contains the
seeds of such a strategy. One
thing is highly probable:
increasing isolation of the
military-bureaucratic structures
within Thailand will be
accompanied by further
dependence on the U.S. and the
international organizations which
it controls. The situation is
vicious, tragic, and all the more
ironic for a country so proud of
never having been colonized.

The importance of Thailand
looms increasingly large within
the context of American
perspectives for Southeast Asian
development. The military and
political situations in Indochina
are hopeless for the U.S. and the
regimes depending on American
support; Thailand now draws at
least $195 million in U.S. private
investment compared with $25
million in 1960; she has received
$2 billion in U.S. public
assistance, at least 75% of which
goes for military purposes; finally,
U.S. air bases in Thai territory
continue to be vital to American
interests in the region. As the
Americans are forced to withdraw
from Indochina, ("withdraw"
possibly implying only
repatriation of troops with
continued utilization of air
power), the U.S. will attempt to
make a political and economic
stand in Thailand and Indonesia,
the geographical position of
Thailand rendering her role both
more vulnerable and vital.
In order to roughly assess the
probable causes and consequences
of the November 17, 1971 coup,
it is useful to first describe in very
general terms the major social
forces presently active in
Thailand:
1. Military: Military leadership
began playing a vital role in Thai
politics at the time of the 1932
revolution which proclaimed a
constitutional monarchy. By
1947, civilian opposition was
essentially swept away and since
then military officers have
completely dominated the
political life of Thailand, giving
the country a consistent pro-U.S.
foreign policy, encouraging
foreign investment, and receiving
large amounts of U.S. aid. The
strength of the military is derived
from its cohesive organization,
foreign military aid, and the lack
of any social group willing or able
to challenge it. (No bourgeois
class with any political potential
has arisen, major commercial
functions down to the lowest
market level being dominated by
Chinese with little interest in or
legal right to political activity).
Structure
2. Bureaucracy: Part of
Thailand's remarkable political
stability on local and provincial
levels has been due to the
existence of a solid bureaucratic
structure. Since World War II the
bureaucracy has been greatly
enlarged numerically, providing
avenues of mobility for local elites
but at the same time growing
more and more inefficient. The
structure has traditionally been
conservative and static, the chief
career goals of its members being
assignment in Bangkok.
Bureaucratic attitudes toward the
peasantry up until a few years ago
can be characterized as benign
neglect, but such a tradition has
lately begun to cause problems
with the onrush of government
sponsored and U.S. financed
development programs, in part
created by American & Thai
realization of the importance of
village control, necessitating
increased official presence in the
villages. Except for the years
between 1932 and 1947, the
bureaucracy has presented little
threat to military dominance, the
two groups tending to be
mutually supportive politically
and economically in their desire
for a continuation of the status
quo.
3. Peasantry: Farmers make up
over 75% of Thailand's population
and have been traditionally docile
in terms of politics. The one or
two peasant uprisings recorded
before the late 1950's took palce
in a limited area as a result of
government efforts to extend
state sponsored religious influence
and organization. Low population
(now increasing at a high rate),
the absence of landed nobility,
good climate, and generally rich
natural resources usually provided
the Thai peasant with sufficient
land to grow rice and perhaps a
dry season crop sufficient to feed
himself and sell a portion to the
local Chinese middleman for
eventual export. One qualification
to this statement is the growth of
absentee landlordism in the rich

central plain where, since the late
1800's, irrigation and rice export
made land a profitable
investment, while peasants began
loosing their land due to their
inability to deal with the credit
and money economy following
the influx of cheap foreign goods.
Such an influx was a consequence
of a series of unequal treaties
imposed on Thailand in the
1860's and 1870's by the
imperialist powers, (including the
U.S.), and erased in the late
1930'5. It is also necessary to
mention the ethnic minorities —
Lao's in the northeast, hill tribes
in the north, and Malay in the
South — all three minority victims
of poor administration.
4. Members of Parliament: This
is a difficult group to describe due
to its heterogeneity and ability to
be absorbed into the bureaucracy
when the parliament is dissolved
and the military clamps down on
national and provincial
opposition. It is relatively weak in
the sense that most MP's have no
real power base, (i.e. land,
industry, outside the official
bureaucratic structure. In spite of
its somewhat unstable nature, this
group has grown in importance
due to its increasing intrusion into
areas of traditional military and
bureaucratic perrogative.
Coup
The coup in question took
place on Nov. 17 when 4 tanks
and around 50 soldiers
surrounded the Parliament
building. The Parliament itself was
dissolved along with political
parties and the 1968 constitution.
The government radio announced
a return to stability under the
"Revolutionary Party,"
headquartered in the site of the
military's Supreme
Command — Forward
Headquarters. The national
leadership itself has not changed,
with the 5 principal cabinet
members (all military men),
comprising the post-coup
leadership group. What then were
the causes of the coup? In broad
terms they include factional
conflict within the military
dominated cabinet, military and
bureaucratic resentment at an
increasingly bothersome
parliament, and a general
atmosphere of instability brought
on by growing insurgent activity,
economic decline, and the
forementioned opposition of the
MP's.
Factional conflict was
probably the immediate cause of
the coup. Junior and middle level
military supporters of General
Praphat Charusatian, anxious to
strengthen themselves and their
leader for the time when Field
Marshall Thanom Kittikachorn
steps down from his leadership
post, probably initiated the action
with Praphat's approval. Field
Marshall Thanom was allegedly
able to control events in time and
give where he had to, but the
present situation clearly
represents an increase in power
for Praphat, who added the
Defense Ministry to his position as
Minister of Interior and further
consolidated his control of the
Army. There was thus movement
within the leadership even if the
group itself did not change. And
the very unity which the group
did display, enabling Field
Marshall Thenom to mediate, was
due to a common suspicion of
parliamentary activity by the

military elite and most of the
bureaucracy. The MP's had
become increasingly vocal and
effective in their oppositon, not
so much on general development
or foreign policy alternatives, but
on specific projects or budget
allocations.
In fact, opposition from the
government's own party, based on
members' resentment at not
receiving increased development
funds allocated only to
government supporters), would
have helped defeat the
government's budget had not the
coup dissolved the parliament
before a vote could take place. It
must also be stated that many
bureaucratic non-military Thais,
including peasants, were upset by
what was perceived to be
parliamentary irresponsibility.
The King, a weak but
symbolically useful figure,
contributed to such perception by
his support of the military's
actions. The last factor, a general
atmosphere of instability in the
country, undoubtedly contributed
in a real way to the military's
belief that power had to be
exercised with no constraints, and
thus to the 'unity which aided
Praphat in his advancement.
Instability Useful
Moreover, the invocation of
this instability did serve as useful
and effective justification for the
present leadership's action. The
growth of the insurgencies based
in the ethnic minority areas of the
South, North, and Northeast is an
important factor. Such growth has
not only been in numbers, but
more vitally in the form of
extension of insurgent activities to
zones of ethnic Thais and in the
establishment of insurgent
organizations on the village level
in 1 Northern and 2 Northeastern
provinces. This is, of course,
aggravated by deteriorating
situations on the Burmese, Lao,
and Cambodian borders.
Finally, economic decline has
begun to create serious problems.
An undiversified Thai economy
can no longer export its rice
surpluses due to self sufficiency of
former importers, but more
importantly because of increasing
U.S. farm exports to traditionally
Thai markets. Thai foreign
reserves have been reduced by
almost $230 million in the last 3
years, and peasant incomes are
beginning to be affected.
Predictably, the Thai leadership
has tried to create suspicion of
Chinese businessmen based on the
economic situation, although pure
jingoism and use of the fifth
column threat also play a role.
In terms of the coup's
consequences, there should be
some sort of further power
consolidation by General Praphat
within a year. Although there will
probably be no major split within
the military, the military and
bureaucracy should become
increasingly isolated from other
political forces which their actions
help to create. A number of MP's
will probably be forced to the left
while the insurgencies may very
well attract increasing numers of

handed suppression of U.S.

parliamentary activity by the

military elite and most of the
bureaucracy. The MP's had
become increasingly vocal and
effective in their oppositon, not
so much on general development
or foreign policy alternatives, but
on specific projects or budget
allocations.
In fact, opposition from the
government's own party, based on
members' resentment at not
receiving increased development
funds allocated only to
government supporters), would
have helped defeat the
government's budget had not the
coup dissolved the parliament
before a vote could take place. It
must also be stated that many
bureaucratic non-military Thais,
including peasants, were upset by
what was perceived to be
parliamentary irresponsibility.
The King, a weak but
symbolically useful figure,
contributed to such perception by
his support of the military's
actions. The last factor, a general
atmosphere of instability in the
country, undoubtedly contributed
in a real way to the military's
belief that power had to be
exercised with no constraints, and
thus to the 'unity which aided
Praphat in his advancement.
Instability Useful
Moreover, the invocation of
this instability did serve as useful
and effective justification for the
present leadership's action. The
growth of the insurgencies based
in the ethnic minority areas of the
South, North, and Northeast is an
important factor. Such growth has
not only been in numbers, but
more vitally in the form of
extension of insurgent activities to
zones of ethnic Thais and in the
establishment of insurgent
organizations on the village level
in 1 Northern and 2 Northeastern
provinces. This is, of course,
aggravated by deteriorating
situations on the Burmese, Lao,
and Cambodian borders.
Finally, economic decline has
begun to create serious problems.
An undiversified Thai economy
can no longer export its rice
surpluses due to self sufficiency of
former importers, but more
importantly because of increasing
U.S. farm exports to traditionally
Thai markets. Thai foreign
reserves have been reduced by
almost $230 million in the last 3
years, and peasant incomes are
beginning to be affected.
Predictably, the Thai leadership
has tried to create suspicion of
Chinese businessmen based on the
economic situation, although pure
jingoism and use of the fifth
column threat also play a role.
In terms of the coup's
consequences, there should be
some sort of further power
consolidation by General Praphat
within a year. Although there will
probably be no major split within
the military, the military and
bureaucracy should become
increasingly isolated from other
political forces which their actions
help to create. A number of MP's
will probably be forced to the left
while the insurgencies may very
well attract increasing numers of
villagers, both by the insurgents'
own efforts and by the heavy
handed suppression of U.S.
trained and armed Thai forces
who have had combat experience
in Vietnam and Laos. Any
improvement of the economic
situation must come from a
reduction of U.S. rice exports or a

diversification of Thaiagricultures,
neither of which is likely given the
basis of U.S. policy and the
inefficiency of the Thai
bureaucracy. Continued foreign
investment in Thai primary
commodities will certainly not
alleviate the difficulties. The Thai
military is thus in one sense
weakened by The U.S., and in
another sense strengthened.
One scenario possibly
envisaged by U.S. planners would
be following: As rice exports
continued to decline and rural
areas become less safe, many
villagers will decide to leave their
farms and go into Bangkok where
manual labor jobs, created by
foreign investment, await them.
The Thai government will thus
reduce its presence in rural areas
and shift its bureaucratic stength
to the management of industry
and worker control. Continued
government presence would, of

course, have to be maintained in
rural areas where things like tin,
rubber, oil, etc. are found, but
this could be dealt with by the
construction of cities in those
zones. Meanwhile, those villagers
choosing to ally with the
insurgents could be handled by air
power.
Work done by U. S.
government-sponsored social
scientists already contains the
seeds of such a strategy. One
thing is highly probable:
increasing isolation of the
military-bureaucratic structures
within Thailand will be
accompanied by further
dependence on the U.S. and the
international organizations which
it controls. The situation is
vicious, tragic, and all the more
ironic for a country so proud of
never having been colonized.

The importance of Thailand
looms increasingly large within
the context of American
perspectives for Southeast Asian
development. The military and
political situations in Indochina
are hopeless for the U.S. and the
regimes depending on American
support; Thailand now draws at
least $195 million in U.S. private
investment compared with $25
million in 1960; she has received
$2 billion in U.S. public
assistance, at least 75% of which
goes for military purposes; finally,
U.S. air bases in Thai territory
continue to be vital to American
interests in the region. As the
Americans are forced to withdraw
from Indochina, ("withdraw"
possibly implying only
repatriation of troops with
continued utilization of air
power), the U.S. will attempt to
make a political and economic
stand in Thailand and Indonesia,
the geographical position of
Thailand rendering her role both
more vulnerable and vital.
In order to roughly assess the
probable causes and consequences
of the November 17, 1971 coup,
it is useful to first describe in very
general terms the major social
forces presently active in
Thailand:
1. Military: Military leadership
began playing a vital role in Thai
politics at the time of the 1932
revolution which proclaimed a
constitutional monarchy. By
1947, civilian opposition was
essentially swept away and since
then military officers have
completely dominated the
political life of Thailand, giving
the country a consistent pro-U.S.
foreign policy, encouraging
foreign investment, and receiving
large amounts of U.S. aid. The
strength of the military is derived
from its cohesive organization,
foreign military aid, and the lack
of any social group willing or able
to challenge it. (No bourgeois
class with any political potential
has arisen, major commercial
functions down to the lowest
market level being dominated by
Chinese with little interest in or
legal right to political activity).
Structure
2. Bureaucracy: Part of
Thailand's remarkable political
stability on local and provincial
levels has been due to the
existence of a solid bureaucratic
structure. Since World War II the
bureaucracy has been greatly
enlarged numerically, providing
avenues of mobility for local elites
but at the same time growing
more and more inefficient. The
structure has traditionally been
conservative and static, the chief
career goals of its members being
assignment in Bangkok.
Bureaucratic attitudes toward the
peasantry up until a few years ago
can be characterized as benign
neglect, but such a tradition has
lately begun to cause problems
with the onrush of government
sponsored and U.S. financed
development programs, in part
created by American & Thai
realization of the importance of
village control, necessitating
increased official presence in the
villages. Except for the years
between 1932 and 1947, the
bureaucracy has presented little
threat to military dominance, the
two groups tending to be
mutually supportive politically
and economically in their desire
for a continuation of the status
quo.
3. Peasantry: Farmers make up
over 75% of Thailand's population
and have been traditionally docile
in terms of politics. The one or
two peasant uprisings recorded
before the late 1950's took palce
in a limited area as a result of
government efforts to extend
state sponsored religious influence
and organization. Low population
(now increasing at a high rate),
the absence of landed nobility,
good climate, and generally rich
natural resources usually provided
the Thai peasant with sufficient
land to grow rice and perhaps a
dry season crop sufficient to feed
himself and sell a portion to the
local Chinese middleman for
eventual export. One qualification
to this statement is the growth of
absentee landlordism in the rich

central plain where, since the late
1800's, irrigation and rice export
made land a profitable
investment, while peasants began
loosing their land due to their
inability to deal with the credit
and money economy following
the influx of cheap foreign goods.
Such an influx was a consequence
of a series of unequal treaties
imposed on Thailand in the
1860's and 1870's by the
imperialist powers, (including the
U.S.), and erased in the late
1930'5. It is also necessary to
mention the ethnic minorities —
Lao's in the northeast, hill tribes
in the north, and Malay in the
South — all three minority victims
of poor administration.
4. Members of Parliament: This
is a difficult group to describe due
to its heterogeneity and ability to
be absorbed into the bureaucracy
when the parliament is dissolved
and the military clamps down on
national and provincial
opposition. It is relatively weak in
the sense that most MP's have no
real power base, (i.e. land,
industry, outside the official
bureaucratic structure. In spite of
its somewhat unstable nature, this
group has grown in importance
due to its increasing intrusion into
areas of traditional military and
bureaucratic perrogative.
Coup
The coup in question took
place on Nov. 17 when 4 tanks
and around 50 soldiers
surrounded the Parliament
building. The Parliament itself was
dissolved along with political
parties and the 1968 constitution.
The government radio announced
a return to stability under the
"Revolutionary Party,"
headquartered in the site of the
military's Supreme
Command — Forward
Headquarters. The national
leadership itself has not changed,
with the 5 principal cabinet
members (all military men),
comprising the post-coup
leadership group. What then were
the causes of the coup? In broad
terms they include factional
conflict within the military
dominated cabinet, military and
bureaucratic resentment at an
increasingly bothersome
parliament, and a general
atmosphere of instability brought
on by growing insurgent activity,
economic decline, and the
forementioned opposition of the
MP's.
Factional conflict was
probably the immediate cause of
the coup. Junior and middle level
military supporters of General
Praphat Charusatian, anxious to
strengthen themselves and their
leader for the time when Field
Marshall Thanom Kittikachorn
steps down from his leadership
post, probably initiated the action
with Praphat's approval. Field
Marshall Thanom was allegedly
able to control events in time and
give where he had to, but the
present situation clearly
represents an increase in power
for Praphat, who added the
Defense Ministry to his position as
Minister of Interior and further
consolidated his control of the
Army. There was thus movement
within the leadership even if the
group itself did not change. And
the very unity which the group
did display, enabling Field
Marshall Thenom to mediate, was
due to a common suspicion of
parliamentary activity by the

military elite and most of the
bureaucracy. The MP's had
become increasingly vocal and
effective in their oppositon, not
so much on general development
or foreign policy alternatives, but
on specific projects or budget
allocations.

South — all three minority victims
of poor administration.
4. Members of Parliament: This
is a difficult group to describe due
to its heterogeneity and ability to
be absorbed into the bureaucracy
when the parliament is dissolved
and the military clamps down on
national and provincial
opposition. It is relatively weak in
the sense that most MP's have no
real power base, (i.e. land,
industry, outside the official
bureaucratic structure. In spite of
its somewhat unstable nature, this
group has grown in importance
due to its increasing intrusion into
areas of traditional military and
bureaucratic perrogative.
Coup
The coup in question took
place on Nov. 17 when 4 tanks
and around 50 soldiers
surrounded the Parliament
building. The Parliament itself was
dissolved along with political
parties and the 1968 constitution.
The government radio announced
a return to stability under the
"Revolutionary Party,"
headquartered in the site of the
military's Supreme
Command — Forward
Headquarters. The national
leadership itself has not changed,
with the 5 principal cabinet
members (all military men),
comprising the post-coup
leadership group. What then were
the causes of the coup? In broad
terms they include factional
conflict within the military
dominated cabinet, military and
bureaucratic resentment at an
increasingly bothersome
parliament, and a general
atmosphere of instability brought
on by growing insurgent activity,
economic decline, and the
forementioned opposition of the
MP's.
Factional conflict was
probably the immediate cause of
the coup. Junior and middle level
military supporters of General
Praphat Charusatian, anxious to
strengthen themselves and their
leader for the time when Field
Marshall Thanom Kittikachorn
steps down from his leadership
post, probably initiated the action
with Praphat's approval. Field
Marshall Thanom was allegedly
able to control events in time and
give where he had to, but the
present situation clearly
represents an increase in power
for Praphat, who added the
Defense Ministry to his position as
Minister of Interior and further
consolidated his control of the
Army. There was thus movement
within the leadership even if the
group itself did not change. And
the very unity which the group
did display, enabling Field
Marshall Thenom to mediate, was
due to a common suspicion of
parliamentary activity by the

military elite and most of the
bureaucracy. The MP's had
become increasingly vocal and
effective in their oppositon, not
so much on general development
or foreign policy alternatives, but
on specific projects or budget
allocations.
In fact, opposition from the
government's own party, based on
members' resentment at not
receiving increased development
funds allocated only to
government supporters), would
have helped defeat the
government's budget had not the
coup dissolved the parliament
before a vote could take place. It
must also be stated that many
bureaucratic non-military Thais,
including peasants, were upset by
what was perceived to be
parliamentary irresponsibility.
The King, a weak but
symbolically useful figure,
contributed to such perception by
his support of the military's
actions. The last factor, a general
atmosphere of instability in the
country, undoubtedly contributed
in a real way to the military's
belief that power had to be
exercised with no constraints, and
thus to the 'unity which aided
Praphat in his advancement.
Instability Useful
Moreover, the invocation of
this instability did serve as useful
and effective justification for the
present leadership's action. The
growth of the insurgencies based
in the ethnic minority areas of the
South, North, and Northeast is an
important factor. Such growth has
not only been in numbers, but
more vitally in the form of
extension of insurgent activities to
zones of ethnic Thais and in the
establishment of insurgent
organizations on the village level
in 1 Northern and 2 Northeastern
provinces. This is, of course,
aggravated by deteriorating
situations on the Burmese, Lao,
and Cambodian borders.
Finally, economic decline has
begun to create serious problems.
An undiversified Thai economy
can no longer export its rice
surpluses due to self sufficiency of
former importers, but more
importantly because of increasing
U.S. farm exports to traditionally
Thai markets. Thai foreign
reserves have been reduced by
almost $230 million in the last 3
years, and peasant incomes are
beginning to be affected.
Predictably, the Thai leadership
has tried to create suspicion of
Chinese businessmen based on the
economic situation, although pure
jingoism and use of the fifth
column threat also play a role.
In terms of the coup's
consequences, there should be
some sort of further power
consolidation by General Praphat
within a year. Although there will
probably be no major split within
the military, the military and
bureaucracy should become
increasingly isolated from other
political forces which their actions
help to create. A number of MP's
will probably be forced to the left
while the insurgencies may very
well attract increasing numers of
villagers, both by the insurgents'
own efforts and by the heavy
handed suppression of U.S.
trained and armed Thai forces
who have had combat experience
in Vietnam and Laos. Any
improvement of the economic
situation must come from a
reduction of U.S. rice exports or a

diversification of Thaiagricultures,
neither of which is likely given the
basis of U.S. policy and the
inefficiency of the Thai
bureaucracy. Continued foreign
investment in Thai primary
commodities will certainly not
alleviate the difficulties. The Thai
military is thus in one sense
weakened by The U.S., and in
another sense strengthened.
One scenario possibly
envisaged by U.S. planners would
be following: As rice exports
continued to decline and rural
areas become less safe, many
villagers will decide to leave their
farms and go into Bangkok where
manual labor jobs, created by
foreign investment, await them.
The Thai government will thus
reduce its presence in rural areas
and shift its bureaucratic stength
to the management of industry
and worker control. Continued
government presence would, of

course, have to be maintained in
rural areas where things like tin,
rubber, oil, etc. are found, but
this could be dealt with by the
construction of cities in those
zones. Meanwhile, those villagers
choosing to ally with the
insurgents could be handled by air
power.
Work done by U. S.
government-sponsored social
scientists already contains the
seeds of such a strategy. One
thing is highly probable:
increasing isolation of the
military-bureaucratic structures
within Thailand will be
accompanied by further
dependence on the U.S. and the
international organizations which
it controls. The situation is
vicious, tragic, and all the more
ironic for a country so proud of
never having been colonized.

The importance of Thailand
looms increasingly large within
the context of American
perspectives for Southeast Asian
development. The military and
political situations in Indochina
are hopeless for the U.S. and the
regimes depending on American
support; Thailand now draws at
least $195 million in U.S. private
investment compared with $25
million in 1960; she has received
$2 billion in U.S. public
assistance, at least 75% of which
goes for military purposes; finally,
U.S. air bases in Thai territory
continue to be vital to American
interests in the region. As the
Americans are forced to withdraw
from Indochina, ("withdraw"
possibly implying only
repatriation of troops with
continued utilization of air
power), the U.S. will attempt to
make a political and economic
stand in Thailand and Indonesia,
the geographical position of
Thailand rendering her role both
more vulnerable and vital.
In order to roughly assess the
probable causes and consequences
of the November 17, 1971 coup,
it is useful to first describe in very
general terms the major social
forces presently active in
Thailand:
1. Military: Military leadership
began playing a vital role in Thai
politics at the time of the 1932
revolution which proclaimed a
constitutional monarchy. By
1947, civilian opposition was
essentially swept away and since
then military officers have
completely dominated the
political life of Thailand, giving
the country a consistent pro-U.S.
foreign policy, encouraging
foreign investment, and receiving
large amounts of U.S. aid. The
strength of the military is derived
from its cohesive organization,
foreign military aid, and the lack
of any social group willing or able
to challenge it. (No bourgeois
class with any political potential
has arisen, major commercial
functions down to the lowest
market level being dominated by
Chinese with little interest in or
legal right to political activity).
Structure
2. Bureaucracy: Part of
Thailand's remarkable political
stability on local and provincial
levels has been due to the
existence of a solid bureaucratic
structure. Since World War II the
bureaucracy has been greatly
enlarged numerically, providing
avenues of mobility for local elites
but at the same time growing
more and more inefficient. The
structure has traditionally been
conservative and static, the chief
career goals of its members being
assignment in Bangkok.
Bureaucratic attitudes toward the
peasantry up until a few years ago
can be characterized as benign
neglect, but such a tradition has
lately begun to cause problems
with the onrush of government
sponsored and U.S. financed
development programs, in part
created by American & Thai
realization of the importance of
village control, necessitating
increased official presence in the
villages. Except for the years
between 1932 and 1947, the
bureaucracy has presented little
threat to military dominance, the
two groups tending to be
mutually supportive politically
and economically in their desire
for a continuation of the status
quo.
3. Peasantry: Farmers make up
over 75% of Thailand's population
and have been traditionally docile
in terms of politics. The one or
two peasant uprisings recorded
before the late 1950's took palce
in a limited area as a result of
government efforts to extend
state sponsored religious influence
and organization. Low population
(now increasing at a high rate),
the absence of landed nobility,
good climate, and generally rich
natural resources usually provided
the Thai peasant with sufficient
land to grow rice and perhaps a
dry season crop sufficient to feed
himself and sell a portion to the
local Chinese middleman for
eventual export. One qualification
to this statement is the growth of
absentee landlordism in the rich

central plain where, since the late
1800's, irrigation and rice export
made land a profitable
investment, while peasants began
loosing their land due to their
inability to deal with the credit
and money economy following
the influx of cheap foreign goods.
Such an influx was a consequence
of a series of unequal treaties
imposed on Thailand in the
1860's and 1870's by the
imperialist powers, (including the
U.S.), and erased in the late
1930'5. It is also necessary to
mention the ethnic minorities —
Lao's in the northeast, hill tribes
in the north, and Malay in the
South — all three minority victims
of poor administration.

existence of a solid bureaucratic
structure. Since World War II the
bureaucracy has been greatly
enlarged numerically, providing
avenues of mobility for local elites
but at the same time growing
more and more inefficient. The
structure has traditionally been
conservative and static, the chief
career goals of its members being
assignment in Bangkok.
Bureaucratic attitudes toward the
peasantry up until a few years ago
can be characterized as benign
neglect, but such a tradition has
lately begun to cause problems
with the onrush of government
sponsored and U.S. financed
development programs, in part
created by American & Thai
realization of the importance of
village control, necessitating
increased official presence in the
villages. Except for the years
between 1932 and 1947, the
bureaucracy has presented little
threat to military dominance, the
two groups tending to be
mutually supportive politically
and economically in their desire
for a continuation of the status
quo.
3. Peasantry: Farmers make up
over 75% of Thailand's population
and have been traditionally docile
in terms of politics. The one or
two peasant uprisings recorded
before the late 1950's took palce
in a limited area as a result of
government efforts to extend
state sponsored religious influence
and organization. Low population
(now increasing at a high rate),
the absence of landed nobility,
good climate, and generally rich
natural resources usually provided
the Thai peasant with sufficient
land to grow rice and perhaps a
dry season crop sufficient to feed
himself and sell a portion to the
local Chinese middleman for
eventual export. One qualification
to this statement is the growth of
absentee landlordism in the rich

central plain where, since the late
1800's, irrigation and rice export
made land a profitable
investment, while peasants began
loosing their land due to their
inability to deal with the credit
and money economy following
the influx of cheap foreign goods.
Such an influx was a consequence
of a series of unequal treaties
imposed on Thailand in the
1860's and 1870's by the
imperialist powers, (including the
U.S.), and erased in the late
1930'5. It is also necessary to
mention the ethnic minorities —
Lao's in the northeast, hill tribes
in the north, and Malay in the
South — all three minority victims
of poor administration.
4. Members of Parliament: This
is a difficult group to describe due
to its heterogeneity and ability to
be absorbed into the bureaucracy
when the parliament is dissolved
and the military clamps down on
national and provincial
opposition. It is relatively weak in
the sense that most MP's have no
real power base, (i.e. land,
industry, outside the official
bureaucratic structure. In spite of
its somewhat unstable nature, this
group has grown in importance
due to its increasing intrusion into
areas of traditional military and
bureaucratic perrogative.
Coup
The coup in question took
place on Nov. 17 when 4 tanks
and around 50 soldiers
surrounded the Parliament
building. The Parliament itself was
dissolved along with political
parties and the 1968 constitution.
The government radio announced
a return to stability under the
"Revolutionary Party,"
headquartered in the site of the
military's Supreme
Command — Forward
Headquarters. The national
leadership itself has not changed,
with the 5 principal cabinet
members (all military men),
comprising the post-coup
leadership group. What then were
the causes of the coup? In broad
terms they include factional
conflict within the military
dominated cabinet, military and
bureaucratic resentment at an
increasingly bothersome
parliament, and a general
atmosphere of instability brought
on by growing insurgent activity,
economic decline, and the
forementioned opposition of the
MP's.
Factional conflict was
probably the immediate cause of
the coup. Junior and middle level
military supporters of General
Praphat Charusatian, anxious to
strengthen themselves and their
leader for the time when Field
Marshall Thanom Kittikachorn
steps down from his leadership
post, probably initiated the action
with Praphat's approval. Field
Marshall Thanom was allegedly
able to control events in time and
give where he had to, but the
present situation clearly
represents an increase in power
for Praphat, who added the
Defense Ministry to his position as
Minister of Interior and further
consolidated his control of the
Army. There was thus movement
within the leadership even if the
group itself did not change. And
the very unity which the group
did display, enabling Field
Marshall Thenom to mediate, was
due to a common suspicion of
parliamentary activity by the

military elite and most of the
bureaucracy. The MP's had
become increasingly vocal and
effective in their oppositon, not
so much on general development
or foreign policy alternatives, but
on specific projects or budget
allocations.
In fact, opposition from the
government's own party, based on
members' resentment at not
receiving increased development
funds allocated only to
government supporters), would
have helped defeat the
government's budget had not the
coup dissolved the parliament
before a vote could take place. It
must also be stated that many
bureaucratic non-military Thais,
including peasants, were upset by
what was perceived to be
parliamentary irresponsibility.
The King, a weak but
symbolically useful figure,
contributed to such perception by
his support of the military's
actions. The last factor, a general
atmosphere of instability in the
country, undoubtedly contributed
in a real way to the military's
belief that power had to be
exercised with no constraints, and
thus to the 'unity which aided
Praphat in his advancement.
Instability Useful
Moreover, the invocation of
this instability did serve as useful
and effective justification for the
present leadership's action. The
growth of the insurgencies based
in the ethnic minority areas of the
South, North, and Northeast is an
important factor. Such growth has
not only been in numbers, but
more vitally in the form of
extension of insurgent activities to
zones of ethnic Thais and in the
establishment of insurgent
organizations on the village level
in 1 Northern and 2 Northeastern
provinces. This is, of course,
aggravated by deteriorating
situations on the Burmese, Lao,
and Cambodian borders.
Finally, economic decline has
begun to create serious problems.
An undiversified Thai economy
can no longer export its rice
surpluses due to self sufficiency of
former importers, but more
importantly because of increasing
U.S. farm exports to traditionally
Thai markets. Thai foreign
reserves have been reduced by
almost $230 million in the last 3
years, and peasant incomes are
beginning to be affected.
Predictably, the Thai leadership
has tried to create suspicion of
Chinese businessmen based on the
economic situation, although pure
jingoism and use of the fifth
column threat also play a role.
In terms of the coup's
consequences, there should be
some sort of further power
consolidation by General Praphat
within a year. Although there will
probably be no major split within
the military, the military and
bureaucracy should become
increasingly isolated from other
political forces which their actions
help to create. A number of MP's
will probably be forced to the left
while the insurgencies may very
well attract increasing numers of
villagers, both by the insurgents'
own efforts and by the heavy
handed suppression of U.S.
trained and armed Thai forces
who have had combat experience
in Vietnam and Laos. Any
improvement of the economic
situation must come from a
reduction of U.S. rice exports or a

diversification of Thaiagricultures,
neither of which is likely given the
basis of U.S. policy and the
inefficiency of the Thai
bureaucracy. Continued foreign
investment in Thai primary
commodities will certainly not
alleviate the difficulties. The Thai
military is thus in one sense
weakened by The U.S., and in
another sense strengthened.
One scenario possibly
envisaged by U.S. planners would
be following: As rice exports
continued to decline and rural
areas become less safe, many
villagers will decide to leave their
farms and go into Bangkok where
manual labor jobs, created by
foreign investment, await them.
The Thai government will thus
reduce its presence in rural areas
and shift its bureaucratic stength
to the management of industry
and worker control. Continued
government presence would, of

course, have to be maintained in
rural areas where things like tin,
rubber, oil, etc. are found, but
this could be dealt with by the
construction of cities in those
zones. Meanwhile, those villagers
choosing to ally with the
insurgents could be handled by air
power.
Work done by U. S.
government-sponsored social
scientists already contains the
seeds of such a strategy. One
thing is highly probable:
increasing isolation of the
military-bureaucratic structures
within Thailand will be
accompanied by further
dependence on the U.S. and the
international organizations which
it controls. The situation is
vicious, tragic, and all the more
ironic for a country so proud of
never having been colonized.

The importance of Thailand
looms increasingly large within
the context of American
perspectives for Southeast Asian
development. The military and
political situations in Indochina
are hopeless for the U.S. and the
regimes depending on American
support; Thailand now draws at
least $195 million in U.S. private
investment compared with $25
million in 1960; she has received
$2 billion in U.S. public
assistance, at least 75% of which
goes for military purposes; finally,
U.S. air bases in Thai territory
continue to be vital to American
interests in the region. As the
Americans are forced to withdraw
from Indochina, ("withdraw"
possibly implying only
repatriation of troops with
continued utilization of air
power), the U.S. will attempt to
make a political and economic
stand in Thailand and Indonesia,
the geographical position of
Thailand rendering her role both
more vulnerable and vital.
In order to roughly assess the
probable causes and consequences
of the November 17, 1971 coup,
it is useful to first describe in very
general terms the major social
forces presently active in
Thailand:
1. Military: Military leadership
began playing a vital role in Thai
politics at the time of the 1932
revolution which proclaimed a
constitutional monarchy. By
1947, civilian opposition was
essentially swept away and since
then military officers have
completely dominated the
political life of Thailand, giving
the country a consistent pro-U.S.
foreign policy, encouraging
foreign investment, and receiving
large amounts of U.S. aid. The
strength of the military is derived
from its cohesive organization,
foreign military aid, and the lack
of any social group willing or able
to challenge it. (No bourgeois
class with any political potential
has arisen, major commercial
functions down to the lowest
market level being dominated by
Chinese with little interest in or
legal right to political activity).
Structure
2. Bureaucracy: Part of
Thailand's remarkable political
stability on local and provincial
levels has been due to the
existence of a solid bureaucratic
structure. Since World War II the
bureaucracy has been greatly
enlarged numerically, providing
avenues of mobility for local elites
but at the same time growing
more and more inefficient. The
structure has traditionally been
conservative and static, the chief
career goals of its members being
assignment in Bangkok.
