## A 						Legal Right To Revolution? 
### 
>marcy kahn

Governments do not guarantee the right of revolution. A
revolution is permissable, and may be undertaken with impunity, only
in such cases as it proves successful. Governments do not rush to
defend the rights of unsuccessful revolutionaries. Neither should we
expect them to. A government may (or may not) permit dissent and
criticism, but no government can suggest its own destruction.
We become more aware of this as we view the Angela Davis case.
While she considers the actions being taken against her as "political,"
the government regards her trial as a purely criminal case. The
government's self-image is homeostatic and does not allow for any
basic changes in structure. That it will always maintain essentially the
same authority and power to influence men's lives as it now has it sees
almost as a given.
The revolutionary seeks to change relationships in the structure
and thereby cause the end of government as it has been known prior
to the revolution.
Grab Hold
No government can tolerate this. As long as there is state power to
be had, someone will grab hold of it, and he will fight to retain
control of that power as long as he possibly can. Therefore any "legal
right to revolution" is fraudulent. Furthermore, unless the jury may
intervene between government and revolutionary, challengers of the
status quo are without recourse to defense.
Presently the government forbids the individual from protecting his
rights except through the employment of a governmental court. The
individual is, therefore, dependent upon this government monopoly
for the administration of justice. Unless the government provides the
individual with a means to have his case heard and rectify injustices
done against him, promptly, and free of expense to him, can the
citizen be morally obliged to leave this job to the government? If the
answer is yes, we are left with an alarmingly familiar situation in
which only persons with great amounts of time and money may
expect protection by the government.
We believe that "justice and right" may not be "sold." ( Magna
Carta, 1215). We cannot resist allowing Lysender Spooner to speak
for us again: "The idea that any poor man would voluntarily pay
taxes to build up a government, which will neither protect his rights
(except at a cost which he cannot meet), nor suffer himself to proect
them by such means as may be in his power, is absurd." (Trail By
Jury, 1852, p. 175.)
Flaws
We are painfully — and thankfully — aware that the trial by jury as

we have presented it is not without flaws. We have not determined
what kind of jury selection process is most just. Should jurors be
chosen randomly from the population at large as Mr. Spooner
suggests? Should they all be of the same political persuasion,
economic background, or mode of sexual behavior as the defendant?
Could justice better be realized through a bicameral jury, in which one
branch of the jury is composed of one representative of each faction
in the country while the other offers proportional representation of
the various viewpoints according to their respective acceptance among
the populace? We have no answers to these questions as yet.
We are convinced, nevertheless, that it is imperative that courtroom
proceedings be taken out of the hands of the government and
returned to the people; that the jury, not an employee of the
government, judge the applicability of particular evidence to the case,
interpret the law as it applies to the case, and rule on the justice of the
law.
We hope that the reader will find some of our ideas worthy of
further consideration in any serious effort to relieve the injustice
perpetuated by the present system of trial by government.

for the administration of justice. Unless the government provides the
individual with a means to have his case heard and rectify injustices
done against him, promptly, and free of expense to him, can the
citizen be morally obliged to leave this job to the government? If the
answer is yes, we are left with an alarmingly familiar situation in
which only persons with great amounts of time and money may
expect protection by the government.
We believe that "justice and right" may not be "sold." ( Magna
Carta, 1215). We cannot resist allowing Lysender Spooner to speak
for us again: "The idea that any poor man would voluntarily pay
taxes to build up a government, which will neither protect his rights
(except at a cost which he cannot meet), nor suffer himself to proect
them by such means as may be in his power, is absurd." (Trail By
Jury, 1852, p. 175.)
Flaws
We are painfully — and thankfully — aware that the trial by jury as

we have presented it is not without flaws. We have not determined
what kind of jury selection process is most just. Should jurors be
chosen randomly from the population at large as Mr. Spooner
suggests? Should they all be of the same political persuasion,
economic background, or mode of sexual behavior as the defendant?
Could justice better be realized through a bicameral jury, in which one
branch of the jury is composed of one representative of each faction
in the country while the other offers proportional representation of
the various viewpoints according to their respective acceptance among
the populace? We have no answers to these questions as yet.
We are convinced, nevertheless, that it is imperative that courtroom
proceedings be taken out of the hands of the government and
returned to the people; that the jury, not an employee of the
government, judge the applicability of particular evidence to the case,
interpret the law as it applies to the case, and rule on the justice of the
law.
We hope that the reader will find some of our ideas worthy of
further consideration in any serious effort to relieve the injustice
perpetuated by the present system of trial by government.

Governments do not guarantee the right of revolution. A
revolution is permissable, and may be undertaken with impunity, only
in such cases as it proves successful. Governments do not rush to
defend the rights of unsuccessful revolutionaries. Neither should we
expect them to. A government may (or may not) permit dissent and
criticism, but no government can suggest its own destruction.
We become more aware of this as we view the Angela Davis case.
While she considers the actions being taken against her as "political,"
the government regards her trial as a purely criminal case. The
government's self-image is homeostatic and does not allow for any
basic changes in structure. That it will always maintain essentially the
same authority and power to influence men's lives as it now has it sees
almost as a given.
The revolutionary seeks to change relationships in the structure
and thereby cause the end of government as it has been known prior
to the revolution.
Grab Hold
No government can tolerate this. As long as there is state power to
be had, someone will grab hold of it, and he will fight to retain
control of that power as long as he possibly can. Therefore any "legal
right to revolution" is fraudulent. Furthermore, unless the jury may
intervene between government and revolutionary, challengers of the
status quo are without recourse to defense.
Presently the government forbids the individual from protecting his
rights except through the employment of a governmental court. The
individual is, therefore, dependent upon this government monopoly
for the administration of justice. Unless the government provides the
individual with a means to have his case heard and rectify injustices
done against him, promptly, and free of expense to him, can the
citizen be morally obliged to leave this job to the government? If the
answer is yes, we are left with an alarmingly familiar situation in
