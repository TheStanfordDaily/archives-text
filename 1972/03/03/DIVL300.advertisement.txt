WOULD YOU DELIEVE TEAC'S
VERY DEST CASSETTE
RECORDER/AmPLIF lER
FOR b99.95!
We don't! But it's really true. What we'll sell you if you
act immediately is Teac's best cassette transport, ready to be
connected to your music system and ready to make and
playback cassett' albums. When so connected, its one of the
finest you'll ever use. When this machine first
came out as a deck, it sold for $199.95 which should clue
you in to how good it is. The machine we're offering is
identical, except you get even more since it has a built-in 10
RMS watt stereo amplifier and can therefore drive a pair of
speakers all by itself. $99.95 includes Teac's warranty only
and is so low a price we're sure you'll be around before too
long. You'd better be!
ALSO AVAILABLE WITH TEAC A 25
STEREO SPEAKERS FOR 5139.95
