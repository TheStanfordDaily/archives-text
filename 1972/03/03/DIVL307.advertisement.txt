The NLRB elections are now only a
few days away. By now those of you who
are eligible to vote have had the opportunity
to review the advantages and disadvantages
of union representation as well as the merits
of the particular organizations seeking to
represent you for purposes of collective
bargaining. I hope that you have benefited
from the exchange of information and ideas
concerning election issues.
In the last moments before election
day, I wish only to renew one request which
I made a month ago. Regardless of how you
vote on March 7, please be sure to vote. The
polls will be open for extended periods
during regular working hours and you are
free to vote on your regular working time.
Your supervisors will excuse you for as long
a period as you need. Those of you who are
not sure if you are eligible should
nonetheless vote if you have a preference.
The NLRB will ultimately resolve such
eligibility questions if they should affect the
outcome.
What I most wish to see in the
elections is a 100% turnout. This is
important because the outcome will be
decided by the majority of the valid votes
cast. It is important that you fully
understand the election process. Whatever
your choice, whether it be for a particular
union or for no union, you should vote to
express that choice. If you do not, the
election results may reflect the will of a
minority rather than a majority. This would
be highly unfortunate whatever the result
turned out to be.
In closing I want to reiterate to all
those who may be eligible: the choice in
each election is yours to make, not mine.
Vote your own preference but be sure to
vote on March 7.
