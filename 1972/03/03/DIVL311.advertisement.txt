*
WHY VOTE?
The issue of union representation is

If you have a preference and do not vote,
the election results will not reflect your
view.
Eligibility
Even if you are not sure about your
eligibility to vote, it is still a good idea to
vote if you have a preference. It may be that
your right to vote is challenged at the polls;
but in such case, you can vote on a
challenged ballot. Then if the NLRB should
determine that your job classification is
included in one of the bargaining units, your
vote will be counted and the election results
will reflect your preference on the question
of collective bargaining at Stanford. If you
do not vote, your preference in determining
this important question will not be counted.
No one should be embarrassed about
the possibility of having his or her vote
challenged. This is a standard NLRB
procedure designed to be sure that everyone
has an opportunity to vote.
