# Union Election Tuesday
## 
### 
Over 1600 Stanford employees will
be eligible to vote in Tuesday's
National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) election that will determine
what union, if any, will represent
many of Stanford's maintenance
workers.
Most of those eligible to vote will
express their preference for
representation by the California
School Employees Association-
Stanford Employees Association
(CSEA - SEA), United Stanford
Employees (USE), the Teamsters
Local 856, or no union. The Workers
Action Caucus will also be on the
ballot although that union is now
defunct.
If none of the alternatives receive a
majority of the votes cast the two
alternatives with the highest vote
totals will compete in a subsequent
election.
Police and fire units will vote
separately to decide whether or not
they desire to be represented .by the
Stanford Police Officers Association
and the International Association of
Fire Fighters, respectively.
Voting Encouraged
University Vice-President Robert R.
Augsburger has reminded deans,
department heads, and supervisors that
"employees are permitted and
encouraged to vote on regular working
time."
Those eligible to vote in the large
bargaining unit of about 1600
employees (at the main campus or the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center)
include: maintenance workers, lab
support personnel, custodians, food
service workers, audio-visual operators,
and University Press employees not

currently members of a union. The
1600 member group includes hundreds
of workers at SLAC.
In a full page advertisement in
today's Daily, outlining those eligible
to vote and the time and place of
voting, University President Richard
Lyman has again urged all those
eligible to vote in the elections.
Emphasizing that the outcome of
the election will be decided by the
majority of valid votes cast, Lyman
said: "Whatever your choice, whether
it be for a particular union or for no
union, you should vote to express that
choice. If you do not, the election
results may reflect the will of a
minority rather than a majority. This
would be highly unfortunate, whatever
the result turned out to be."
Polling Places
Polling places open from 6:30 to
10:30 a.m. and from 3 to 7 p.m.
include the SLAC Auditorium Foyer,
Maples Pavilion Room 14, and
Geology Room 321 at the Northwest
corner of the Quad. Medical Ceiaei
Room Mll4 will be open for voting
between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.
Identification of voters will be
required by poll watchers.
According to the NLRB, results of
the election will be available from the
NLRB San Francisco office
Wednesday afternoon, March 8, and
published in a special dead week
edition of the Daily on Thursday.
Those University employees who
are eligible to vote should have been
notified that they are eligible. The
NLRB allows those who think they
should be eligible to vote but have not
been notified to cast "challenge
ballots" which will be considered only

if the results of the election might be
swayed by the challenge ballots.
The election campaign has been
characterized by a lack of knowledge
by many employees eligible to work
and often by outright misinformation.
Union representatives and no union
spokesmen have been hampered by
difficulty in reaching employees who
are spread in small numbers
throughout the University.
The Daily learned that a similar
NLRH election at Occidental College
in Los Angeles in December resulted in
a runoff election scheduled for March
14. In that election about 170 physical
plant, food service, and housekeeping
employees were eligible to vote for no
union, the CSEA, or local 399 of the
AFL-CIO (a hospital employees
union). With 156 employees voting, 76
voted for no union, 56 for CSEA and
24 for the local 399 — forcing a
run-off between CSEA and the no
union possibility. The no union
proposition failed by 3 votes of getting
a majority on the first ballot.

MOBILIZATION-Teamsters move onto the campus to organize support for themselves in next Tuesday's NLRB
election. The vote will decide whether or not to unionize and if so, who will represent 1600 Stanford employees. Other
unions vying for support on the ballot are United Stanford Employees and California School Employees Association.
