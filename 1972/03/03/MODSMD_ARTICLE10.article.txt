Editor, THE DAILY:
Anne Morton's letter (March 1)
expressing agreement with the
current priorities of WPE
(Women's Physical Education
Dept.) reflects some of the
learned attitudes among women
that continue to contribute to
their own low priority in society.
The fear of the "threatening
environment" which could result
from an increase in competitive
sports for women is, I'm sure,
common among "less than star
atheletes." But the issue is why
there are so many women with
nebulous fears such as this, so
many women unsure of their
physical abilities, and so few
women interested in and capable
of competition in any number of
areas. Is this a great virtue women
have over men — that they are
cooperative and non-competitive?
Or is it the result of social training
that actively discourages
competition among women
(except, of course, competition
for male attention.)
Instruction in sports is logically
a prelude, not an alternative to
more extensive competitive
participation. That the budget
forces a choice between these, a
choice no one would think of
making in men's sports,
demonstrates the strong social
influences behind the current
situation in WPE, and its
similarity to numerous situations
elsewhere.
If women are to develop a
physical as well as mental sense of
themselves, to learn to interact
meaningfully with other women,
and to unlearn their fears and
inadequacies, it would seem that
serious competitive sports have
much to offer them. Certainly as
much as most current methods of
consciousness-raising.

We protest the firing of

Professor H. Bruce Franklin.
While there is variation among us
in our individual views, we agree
on the following:
We can see no way in which
the evidence presented to the
Advisory Board can justify the
firing of Prof. Franklin. Neither
were the University rules clearly
enough defined in the area of the
Franklin case, nor was the
evidence as supportive of the
University's position as should be
required for such a drastic action.
This leads us to suspect that
the Advisory Board and the
Administration were strongly
influenced by other factors. Prof.
Franklin's active opposition to
Stanford's role in supporting U.S.
policies in Southeast Asia and
elsewhere has threatened the
University in many ways. There
has been the possibility of
significant loss of funds from
government sources and angered
alumni. Also, his program poses a
serious challenge to the University
as presently constituted. And
more generally, he presents an
active threat to the societal
framework in which the
University operates.
We urge that the University
code of behavior for faculty
members be precisely defined. In
particular, we believe the code
should be consistent with the
protections granted by the laws
and the Constitution of this
country. Furthermore, the code
should pertain solely to the
performance of academic duties.
Finally, the responsibility for the
enforcement of these guidelines
should reside in a broader
spectrum of those who would be
affected by such decisions.
In line with these views, we
believe Prof. Franklin should be
re-hired.

particular, we believe the code
should be consistent with the
protections granted by the laws
and the Constitution of this
country. Furthermore, the code
should pertain solely to the
performance of academic duties.
Finally, the responsibility for the
enforcement of these guidelines
should reside in a broader
spectrum of those who would be
affected by such decisions.
In line with these views, we
believe Prof. Franklin should be
re-hired.

Anne Morton's letter (March 1)
expressing agreement with the
current priorities of WPE
(Women's Physical Education
Dept.) reflects some of the
learned attitudes among women
that continue to contribute to
their own low priority in society.
The fear of the "threatening
environment" which could result
from an increase in competitive
sports for women is, I'm sure,
common among "less than star
atheletes." But the issue is why
there are so many women with
nebulous fears such as this, so
many women unsure of their
physical abilities, and so few
women interested in and capable
of competition in any number of
areas. Is this a great virtue women
have over men — that they are
cooperative and non-competitive?
Or is it the result of social training
that actively discourages
competition among women
(except, of course, competition
for male attention.)
Instruction in sports is logically
a prelude, not an alternative to
more extensive competitive
participation. That the budget
forces a choice between these, a
choice no one would think of
making in men's sports,
demonstrates the strong social
influences behind the current
situation in WPE, and its
similarity to numerous situations
elsewhere.
If women are to develop a
physical as well as mental sense of
themselves, to learn to interact
meaningfully with other women,
and to unlearn their fears and
inadequacies, it would seem that
serious competitive sports have
much to offer them. Certainly as
much as most current methods of
consciousness-raising.

We protest the firing of

Professor H. Bruce Franklin.
While there is variation among us
in our individual views, we agree
on the following:
We can see no way in which
the evidence presented to the
Advisory Board can justify the
firing of Prof. Franklin. Neither
were the University rules clearly
enough defined in the area of the
Franklin case, nor was the
evidence as supportive of the
University's position as should be
required for such a drastic action.
This leads us to suspect that
the Advisory Board and the
Administration were strongly
influenced by other factors. Prof.
Franklin's active opposition to
Stanford's role in supporting U.S.
policies in Southeast Asia and
elsewhere has threatened the
University in many ways. There
has been the possibility of
significant loss of funds from
government sources and angered
alumni. Also, his program poses a
serious challenge to the University
as presently constituted. And
more generally, he presents an
active threat to the societal
framework in which the
University operates.
We urge that the University
code of behavior for faculty
members be precisely defined. In
particular, we believe the code
should be consistent with the
protections granted by the laws
and the Constitution of this
country. Furthermore, the code
should pertain solely to the
performance of academic duties.
Finally, the responsibility for the
enforcement of these guidelines
should reside in a broader
spectrum of those who would be
affected by such decisions.
