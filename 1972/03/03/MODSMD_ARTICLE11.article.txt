## CJP Disqualifications Denial 
### 
John kaplan

(This is an opinion of the Campus
Judicial Panel.)
Motions to disqualify various
members of the Campus Judicial
Panel have been made before me.
Under Rule 9 of the Campus
Judicial Panel procedures, I am
considering these motions. It is
appropriate, however, that, rather
than doing this with a simple yes
or no, I should set down in an
opinion the general rules I am
applying first so that the
University community can
examine the processes of decision,
and second, should this body
continue, (we have not yet
resolved the basic jurisdictional
question argued before us
Tuesday evening) so that future
defendants may have some
indication of the standards to be
applied.
Needless to say, it is a difficult
matter on such short notice to
articulate standards for
disqualification with a view to
every possible contingency that
may come up. I do hope,
however, that in the context of
the questions presented today, the
general reasoning of my rulings
will prove cogent.
First, the defendants have
submitted sixteen interrogatories
for the whole panel. I have
distributed these interrogatories
to the rest of the Panel and will
forward their answers as well as
my own to the attorneys for the
defendants. It is quite clear
however, that I will not have all
the answers to defendant's
questionnaire in time to either
hear argument or make an
intelligent decision before the
argument on this case Thursday
night. I will therefore set down
the argument for a mutually
agreeable place and time as soon
as possible after the hearing and
before the Panel meets to
deliberate on this case.
Voir Dire
It may be argued that these
motions should be argued to the
Panel as a whole — complete with
"voir dire" as practiced before the
SJC. First of all, the rules make
clear this is not the case. Indeed,
the major reason for the decision
to invest the chairman with the
authority to rule on
disqualifications was to prevent
what many considered was the
scandal of "voir dire" last year,
when absolutely unanswerable
questions were posed of the Panel
and it was somehow implied that
because these could not or would
not be answered the way
defendants desired, that some bias
was shown against the defendants.
The questionnaire continues
this type of questioning. Question
12 for instance asks:
"What do you believe is a
greater danger to human
freedom and principles of
human dignity — the activities
of the defendants or the
continuation of the killing in
Asia?"
Answering this question for

myself, I have absolutely no
trouble saying the defendants in
and of themselves are an
insignificant threat, at least
compared with a war in Asia that
I consider a disaster on far too
many reasons to count. On the
other hand, the jurisdction of the
Campus Judicial Panel is not such
that if it acquits the defendants it
will stop the war in Asia. If the
standard is whether or not a given
action on this campus is or is not
as bad as Vietnam, we have
abandoned all the values that are
inherent in a University.
In deciding the motions for
disqualification it seems to me
essential to distinguish among
three kinds of predispositions
which the defendants seem to
lump together. The first is a bias
against them personally through
contact, acquaintanceship or
something, aside from the hearing
officer's report, of course, that we
have heard about them. They have
made motions to disqualify three
members of the Panel for this
type of bias. In one case, it seems
quite clear that such a bias does
exist and I am prepared — indeed
I have already discussed it with
the Panel member — to disqualify
him from sitting on the case o£
two former residents of his dorm
with whom he had had many
acrimonious and unpleasant
situations. The charges of bias
brought against two other
members of the panel are far less
specific and more conclusionary. I
have not fully discussed the
matter with the Panel members,
but in view of the failure to
specify more than that the Panel
member has had a heated
discussion with the defendant, I
will look no further than a flat
denial of personal ill will, if one is
forthcoming, to deny these
motions.
Law Questions
The next and very different
kind of bias charged is over
questions of law which may come
before the Panel. The motion
strongly implies that if, prior to a
hearing, a judge entertains a view
on the law, contrary to that
advocated by the party
challenging him, that judge is
biased and should be disqualified.
A little thought reveals that this
cannot be the case even in the

case of very strong views. If it
were, presumably Justice Douglas
could sit on no freedom of speech
case, because his views in favor of
freedom of speech are so well
know that it is hard to argue that
he can give any case the fresh
consideration which the
prosecution would generally
desire. Similarly, of course, on a
bw and order issue one would
have no trouble disqualifying
several other members of the
United States Supreme Court if
the defendants' definition of bias
prevailed. That, however, is not
what we mean by bias. Any
lawyer appointed to the bench
comes with opinions on many
legal issues and typically retains
many of these opinions for his
lifetime. Moreover, men have
often been known to change their
opinions; all one can ask is that a
judge listen to argument on any
issue and decide it which ever way
he honestly feels is proper. The
defendants in short cannot
disqualify someone fixed in his
opinion on issues of law any more
than the prosecution could
disqualify an avid believer in any
principles that might cost the
prosecution its case.
The final kind of bias alleged is
a bias against people who do
certain things — what might be
called a sentencing bias. The
theory here is that if one thinks
before going into a hearing that
certain kinds of offenses are more
serious than other kinds, he must
disqualify himself from those
cases he considers the most
serious or deserving of any
particular penalty. In some sense
this is a variant of the previous
argument. Everyone who attempts
to judge does so with a set of
values and feelings. Often these
can be changed by argument but
where they cannot, a defendant
cannot, without alleging some
kind of personal ill will against
himself, ask that the views on
sentencing of any member of the
Panel be a reason for
disqualification. If both sides were
given similar rights to challenge on
this ground (and there is certainly
no hint either in the law or in
fairness why this should not be
the case) then very few judges
would be around to decide cases.
Finally, I mast move on to a

motion to disqualify me
personally. Their motion is to
disqualify:
"Mr. Kaplan for his strong
views on the necessity of
maintaining complete order on
the campus (as defined by the
administration); for his strong
and unrealistic views on the
possibilities of working
through change through
persuading the administration,
severely predisposing him
against an affirmative defense
of justification; for his view of
the Movement of which
defendants are a part as being
composed of dangerous
"thugs" who will destroy the
campus unless they are
seriously intimidated; for his
own predisposition to mete
out harsh punishments in this
case; and for his exposure to
strong peer-group pressure to
mete out harsh punishments in
this case."
First Category
First of all, none of the charges
fall into the first category. No one
has alleged I bear the defendants
any personal ill will. Indeed, I had
not heard of them when they
were charged and have had only
minimal contact with them since
and that not unpleasant. Even on
the other two categories of bias,
their allegations are hardly more
than conclusions. Indeed I regard
their characterizations of my
views as grossly distorted and
their implication that I would
yield to peer pressure to their
disadvantage as unworthy.
Finally, in the defendants'
motions, a sizeable number of
remarks are attributed to me
personally. Some of them are true
and I stand by them; others I may
very well have said in antoher
context or during some period of
emotional excitement (and there
have been quite a few of these
lately), but if I did I don't feel
that way now; and some of them
are just flatly untrue. In this
category is the assertion that I
stated that two CJP Panel
members had told me they wished
to expel the placement office
disrupters. I said no such thing
and no member of the CJP said
such a thing to me. (I should have
denied this story when I first saw
it in a Daily column, but I didn't

think anyone would believe it.)
I suppose the ultimate test of
whether I am fair in this case will
be what I do. Personally, I think 1
will be fair; 1 think indeed I have
been fair up to now and that I am
being fair now.
Feeling that way, I, of course,
must deny the defendants
motions to disqualify me. With
respect to any motions based on
the answers to defendants'
interrogatories, I will set them
down for argument in the very
near future.
