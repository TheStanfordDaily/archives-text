# Headline Correction
## 
### 
The Daily wishes to
apologize for a very misleading
headline in Wednesday's paper.
It stated "Brown, Leland,
Moulton Sympathetic to
Placement Center
Disruptions."
However, as the article
hopefully made clear, the three
had only expressed support for
one specific demonstration in
which 65 persons peacefully
and quietly blockaded the door
from a Navy recruiter.
The professors were not
asked about other
demonstrations there in which
people have gone inside and
disrupted interviews. The Daily
wishes to apologize to the
three for any implication in the
headline that they supported
these demonstrations since the
reporter had not even asked
their views on these other
actions.
