# Dirty Job, Low Pay, Little Choice

They are poorly educated and
unskilled. Many belong to
minority groups. Most are women.
Few are young. Although
Stanford custodians do dirty jobs
for low pay, they have little
choice.
"I guess I'm satisfied," a
woman who has worked here 14
years said. "I live close and 1 have
no complaints. I get sick leave and
vacation pay. I never worked
anywhere else. I'm not young and
I wasn't young when I started. I
don't have any education or
qualifications for anything else. I
was lucky to get this job when I
did."
For many custodians this was a
first job. Now they see no reason
for looking elsewhere.
One woman who has been here
II years explained, "I'll probably
work here until I retire. I'm a
little tired of it, but I don't know
where I'd go or what I'd get. At
my age it's hard to find anything
else. There's not much other
opportunity . I wouldn't want to
work in a hospital, and I'm not
trained for too many jobs."
Supervisors
A supervisor is in charge of the
maids and janitors in each large
dorm complex. This position, the
highest of three basic job levels, is
currently filled by four men and
four women, all white.
Eight men work on the
Custodian II level, earning from
$484-618 a month depending on
length of service. They "perform
duties requiring considerable
effort and use of industrial
custodial equipment," according
to the job description.
The 40 women who do lighter
physical work under the
Custodian I category draw wages
which run from $400 to $508 a
month.
The maids and janitors work
from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. with a

half hour lunch and two 15
minute breaks during the day. All
University residences with
standard room and board fees
provide regular custodial services,
including cleaning of windows,
hallways, bathrooms and lounges.
Room cleaning was ended
several years ago, but the
custodians thoroughly clean
student rooms during vacatons,
particularly in June.
Miss Student Contact
Most of the women regret that
their contact with students greatly
diminished when the room
cleaning duties were discontinued.
Most agreed that their
relationships with students end
after a cheerful "hello" in the
hallway.
"The students have classes to
go to and we have our work.
There's no time to stand and
talk," explained a Wilbur maid.
"We are instructed to be nice
with the students, but not to get
to know them too well,"
commented another maid. "I
guess they're afraid we'll do
special favors for people if we get
too friendly," she added.
Many custodians contacted by
the Daily were reluctant to
express their opinions, especially
during work hours. They seemed
afraid that their superiors might
disapprove and surprised that
anyone would care about their
jobs or their lives.
However, they are affected by
many current issues: low-cost
housing, child care, a union, and
racial and sex-linked
discrimination.
Housing Problems
Many regretted that they have

to live so faraway from Stanford.
"I need to drive 12 miles each
way every day, because I found
housing around here so
expensive," complained one maid.
Another, who commutes from
Sunnyvale, found homes there at
least $3,000 cheaper than in Palo
Alto. "They told us a couple of
years ago that the University
would build houses for workers. I
filled out two applications and I

"I was excited when I heard
about it, as living close would save
me time as well as money. I get
tired of driving through all the
traffic every day," she added.
Like other University
employees, most custodians had
young children when they began
working. Many women were able

to rush home alter work to be
with their children not long after
they got home from school.
Those with children of varied
ages, like Toyon maid, June
Monel, left their older children to
care for the younger ones.
"I think child care for the staff
is badly needed, but I'm in no
position to say if the University
will do anything," said Ray
Caldera, who is responsible for

Most custodians contacted had
little to say about the potential of
an employee union here. Many
thought they had been given all
the benefits they could ask for
and were not sure what purpose a
union would serve.
One women was more
optimistic than most. "With a

union things will get better," she
said, "People will be forced to do
something."
Two years ago, when student
rooms were cleaned by the maids,
the residence staff was 20 percent
larger, according to Residence
Manager Alan Cummings.
"All those people who wanted
to continue working here have
been relocated," he said. "Many
went to work at the hospital, and
a few went to the library and
Tresidder. Some quit, but we had
no layoffs."
He added, 'The employees
were all given positions with
equivalent salaries, and in some
cases they improved themselves."
Sex Discrimination Recognized
Caldera commented that he
only recently became aware of the
rigid sex differentiation in the two
non-supervisory positions.
"I guess it stemmed from the
old thing of the need to protect a
woman's femininity by
protecting her from hard work,"
he observed.
"We're trying to alleviate this
now. I think a woman should be
given the opportunity to be
promoted to a higher position if
she feels qualified to perform the
job," he added.
Most women, however, have
not considered trying to change
positions. One Wilbur maid
explained, "The janitors lift heavy
things, and we're not supposed to
lift over 25 pounds. Maybe some
women could lift more if they
tried, but not me."
Many of the custodians have
been here a long time, according
to Cummings. "Shizuko
Nishimura, who works in Lagunita

Court, has been here 33 years — a
lot longer than my office has," he
said.
"Things have changed,
including the start of co-ed
housing, and our employees have
been willing to adapt themselves
to the changes. They're willing to
try their best," he went on.
"A lot of our workers came
when people didn't have very
much and they couldn't
understand why students would
intentionally break things. They
thought the students must be
awfully rich or something. Over
the years they came to understand
better.
"Some got uptight when we
first went co-ed, especially in
places like Lagunita. But now
they like it. The guys treat them
like mothers.
Marguerite Kissel, who started
working in Lagunita in 1942
before she moved to Roble in
1948 to become supervisor,
agreed with Cummings.
Coe«i Change Accepted
"Going co-ed was quite a
change I'll guarantee you. I wasn't
fond of the idea, but I got used to
it. You have to learn to accept
changes, I think," she
commented.
Edith Sue Yancy worked in
Roble two years before it was
opened to men. She admitted, "I
think the change to co-ed is pretty
nice. I can't complain. There are
unnecessary damages that we
didn't have before, but I think it's
pretty nice for girls and boys to
be together."
Caldera feels optimistic. "As
the women's rights thing moves
forward, women who have been

hesitant up to this point will begin
to step forward," he predicted.
"We are going to make every
effort to promote from within."
A big problem, according to
Cummings, is the small turnover
of employees, especially the men.
"It is hard to promote people
when there are almost no
openings. That is why there are no
people from minority groups in
supervisory positions," he noted.
"We are now trying to train
our janitors in maintenance skills
such as plumbing, carpentry-, and
electricity. Hopefully we will be
able to promote some to the level
of maintenance men and thereby
have openings in their positions,"
he said.
"So far we haven't considered
training women for maintenance,
because it requires moving heavy
furniture and appliances," he
continued.
She remembered the days
when "girls were glad to get
flowers and valentines and boys
would come and wait for their
dates downstairs," but she added,.
"I think they're happy here
together."
Monel, who worked in all-male
Toyon about nine years, was at
first a little leary of adding
women. "The change seemed a
little strange to me," she
commented.
She now likes Toyon coed.
"This way I get to talk to both
boys and girls — like being in my
own home," she said.
Supervisor Joe Stewart began
in freshman male Stanford Village
in 1953 and switched to Wilbur
when it opened in 1955. "I was
kind of skeptical at first of
women living in Wilbur, and it
amazed me that things became
more peaceful," he said. "The
men used to throw water, break
furniture, and all kinds of things,
and now there's a lot less
trouble."

particularly in June.
Miss Student Contact
Most of the women regret that
their contact with students greatly
diminished when the room
cleaning duties were discontinued.
Most agreed that their
relationships with students end
after a cheerful "hello" in the
hallway.
"The students have classes to
go to and we have our work.
There's no time to stand and
talk," explained a Wilbur maid.
"We are instructed to be nice
with the students, but not to get
to know them too well,"
commented another maid. "I
guess they're afraid we'll do
special favors for people if we get
too friendly," she added.
Many custodians contacted by
the Daily were reluctant to
express their opinions, especially
during work hours. They seemed
afraid that their superiors might
disapprove and surprised that
anyone would care about their
jobs or their lives.
However, they are affected by
many current issues: low-cost
housing, child care, a union, and
racial and sex-linked
discrimination.
Housing Problems
Many regretted that they have

to live so faraway from Stanford.
"I need to drive 12 miles each
way every day, because I found
housing around here so
expensive," complained one maid.
Another, who commutes from
Sunnyvale, found homes there at
least $3,000 cheaper than in Palo
Alto. "They told us a couple of
years ago that the University
would build houses for workers. I
filled out two applications and I

"I was excited when I heard
about it, as living close would save
me time as well as money. I get
tired of driving through all the
traffic every day," she added.
Like other University
employees, most custodians had
young children when they began
working. Many women were able

to rush home alter work to be
with their children not long after
they got home from school.
Those with children of varied
ages, like Toyon maid, June
Monel, left their older children to
care for the younger ones.
"I think child care for the staff
is badly needed, but I'm in no
position to say if the University
will do anything," said Ray
Caldera, who is responsible for

Most custodians contacted had
little to say about the potential of
an employee union here. Many
thought they had been given all
the benefits they could ask for
and were not sure what purpose a
union would serve.
One women was more
optimistic than most. "With a

union things will get better," she
said, "People will be forced to do
something."
Two years ago, when student
rooms were cleaned by the maids,
the residence staff was 20 percent
larger, according to Residence
Manager Alan Cummings.
"All those people who wanted
to continue working here have
been relocated," he said. "Many
went to work at the hospital, and
a few went to the library and
Tresidder. Some quit, but we had
no layoffs."
He added, 'The employees
were all given positions with
equivalent salaries, and in some
cases they improved themselves."
Sex Discrimination Recognized
Caldera commented that he
only recently became aware of the
rigid sex differentiation in the two
non-supervisory positions.
"I guess it stemmed from the
old thing of the need to protect a
woman's femininity by
protecting her from hard work,"
he observed.
"We're trying to alleviate this
now. I think a woman should be
given the opportunity to be
promoted to a higher position if
she feels qualified to perform the
job," he added.
Most women, however, have
not considered trying to change
positions. One Wilbur maid
explained, "The janitors lift heavy
things, and we're not supposed to
lift over 25 pounds. Maybe some
women could lift more if they
tried, but not me."
Many of the custodians have
been here a long time, according
to Cummings. "Shizuko
Nishimura, who works in Lagunita

Court, has been here 33 years — a
lot longer than my office has," he
said.
"Things have changed,
including the start of co-ed
housing, and our employees have
been willing to adapt themselves
to the changes. They're willing to
try their best," he went on.
"A lot of our workers came
when people didn't have very
much and they couldn't
understand why students would
intentionally break things. They
thought the students must be
awfully rich or something. Over
the years they came to understand
better.
"Some got uptight when we
first went co-ed, especially in
places like Lagunita. But now
they like it. The guys treat them
like mothers.
Marguerite Kissel, who started
working in Lagunita in 1942
before she moved to Roble in
1948 to become supervisor,
agreed with Cummings.
Coe«i Change Accepted
"Going co-ed was quite a
change I'll guarantee you. I wasn't
fond of the idea, but I got used to
it. You have to learn to accept
changes, I think," she
commented.
Edith Sue Yancy worked in
Roble two years before it was
opened to men. She admitted, "I
think the change to co-ed is pretty
nice. I can't complain. There are
unnecessary damages that we
didn't have before, but I think it's
pretty nice for girls and boys to
be together."
Caldera feels optimistic. "As
the women's rights thing moves
forward, women who have been

hesitant up to this point will begin
to step forward," he predicted.
"We are going to make every
effort to promote from within."
A big problem, according to
Cummings, is the small turnover
of employees, especially the men.
"It is hard to promote people
when there are almost no
openings. That is why there are no
people from minority groups in
supervisory positions," he noted.
"We are now trying to train
our janitors in maintenance skills
such as plumbing, carpentry-, and
electricity. Hopefully we will be
able to promote some to the level
of maintenance men and thereby
have openings in their positions,"
he said.
"So far we haven't considered
training women for maintenance,
because it requires moving heavy
furniture and appliances," he
continued.
She remembered the days
when "girls were glad to get
flowers and valentines and boys
would come and wait for their
dates downstairs," but she added,.
"I think they're happy here
together."
Monel, who worked in all-male
Toyon about nine years, was at
first a little leary of adding
women. "The change seemed a
little strange to me," she
commented.
She now likes Toyon coed.
"This way I get to talk to both
boys and girls — like being in my
own home," she said.
Supervisor Joe Stewart began
in freshman male Stanford Village
in 1953 and switched to Wilbur
when it opened in 1955. "I was
kind of skeptical at first of
women living in Wilbur, and it
amazed me that things became
more peaceful," he said. "The
men used to throw water, break
furniture, and all kinds of things,
and now there's a lot less
trouble."

said. Union Considerations
By KATHY WEINBERGER
They are poorly educated and
unskilled. Many belong to
minority groups. Most are women.
Few are young. Although
Stanford custodians do dirty jobs
for low pay, they have little
choice.
"I guess I'm satisfied," a
woman who has worked here 14
years said. "I live close and 1 have
no complaints. I get sick leave and
vacation pay. I never worked
anywhere else. I'm not young and
I wasn't young when I started. I
don't have any education or
qualifications for anything else. I
was lucky to get this job when I
did."
For many custodians this was a
first job. Now they see no reason
for looking elsewhere.
One woman who has been here
II years explained, "I'll probably
work here until I retire. I'm a
little tired of it, but I don't know
where I'd go or what I'd get. At
my age it's hard to find anything
else. There's not much other
opportunity . I wouldn't want to
work in a hospital, and I'm not
trained for too many jobs."
Supervisors
A supervisor is in charge of the
maids and janitors in each large
dorm complex. This position, the
highest of three basic job levels, is
currently filled by four men and
four women, all white.
Eight men work on the
Custodian II level, earning from
$484-618 a month depending on
length of service. They "perform
duties requiring considerable
effort and use of industrial
custodial equipment," according
to the job description.
The 40 women who do lighter
physical work under the
Custodian I category draw wages
which run from $400 to $508 a
month.
The maids and janitors work
from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. with a

half hour lunch and two 15
minute breaks during the day. All
University residences with
standard room and board fees
provide regular custodial services,
including cleaning of windows,
hallways, bathrooms and lounges.
Room cleaning was ended
several years ago, but the
custodians thoroughly clean
student rooms during vacatons,

an employee union here. Many
thought they had been given all
the benefits they could ask for
and were not sure what purpose a
union would serve.
One women was more
optimistic than most. "With a

union things will get better," she
said, "People will be forced to do
something."
Two years ago, when student
rooms were cleaned by the maids,
the residence staff was 20 percent
larger, according to Residence
Manager Alan Cummings.
"All those people who wanted
to continue working here have
been relocated," he said. "Many
went to work at the hospital, and
a few went to the library and
Tresidder. Some quit, but we had
no layoffs."
He added, 'The employees
were all given positions with
equivalent salaries, and in some
cases they improved themselves."
Sex Discrimination Recognized
Caldera commented that he
only recently became aware of the
rigid sex differentiation in the two
non-supervisory positions.
"I guess it stemmed from the
old thing of the need to protect a
woman's femininity by
protecting her from hard work,"
he observed.
"We're trying to alleviate this
now. I think a woman should be
given the opportunity to be
promoted to a higher position if
she feels qualified to perform the
job," he added.
Most women, however, have
not considered trying to change
positions. One Wilbur maid
explained, "The janitors lift heavy
things, and we're not supposed to
lift over 25 pounds. Maybe some
women could lift more if they
tried, but not me."
Many of the custodians have
been here a long time, according
to Cummings. "Shizuko
Nishimura, who works in Lagunita

Court, has been here 33 years — a
lot longer than my office has," he
said.
"Things have changed,
including the start of co-ed
housing, and our employees have
been willing to adapt themselves
to the changes. They're willing to
try their best," he went on.
"A lot of our workers came
when people didn't have very
much and they couldn't
understand why students would
intentionally break things. They
thought the students must be
awfully rich or something. Over
the years they came to understand
better.
"Some got uptight when we
first went co-ed, especially in
places like Lagunita. But now
they like it. The guys treat them
like mothers.
Marguerite Kissel, who started
working in Lagunita in 1942
before she moved to Roble in
1948 to become supervisor,
agreed with Cummings.
Coe«i Change Accepted
"Going co-ed was quite a
change I'll guarantee you. I wasn't
fond of the idea, but I got used to
it. You have to learn to accept
changes, I think," she
commented.
Edith Sue Yancy worked in
Roble two years before it was
opened to men. She admitted, "I
think the change to co-ed is pretty
nice. I can't complain. There are
unnecessary damages that we
didn't have before, but I think it's
pretty nice for girls and boys to
be together."
Caldera feels optimistic. "As
the women's rights thing moves
forward, women who have been

hesitant up to this point will begin
to step forward," he predicted.
"We are going to make every
effort to promote from within."
A big problem, according to
Cummings, is the small turnover
of employees, especially the men.
"It is hard to promote people
when there are almost no
openings. That is why there are no
people from minority groups in
supervisory positions," he noted.
"We are now trying to train
our janitors in maintenance skills
such as plumbing, carpentry-, and
electricity. Hopefully we will be
able to promote some to the level
of maintenance men and thereby
have openings in their positions,"
he said.
"So far we haven't considered
training women for maintenance,
because it requires moving heavy
furniture and appliances," he
continued.
She remembered the days
when "girls were glad to get
flowers and valentines and boys
would come and wait for their
dates downstairs," but she added,.
"I think they're happy here
together."
Monel, who worked in all-male
Toyon about nine years, was at
first a little leary of adding
women. "The change seemed a
little strange to me," she
commented.
She now likes Toyon coed.
"This way I get to talk to both
boys and girls — like being in my
own home," she said.
Supervisor Joe Stewart began
in freshman male Stanford Village
in 1953 and switched to Wilbur
when it opened in 1955. "I was
kind of skeptical at first of
women living in Wilbur, and it
amazed me that things became
more peaceful," he said. "The
men used to throw water, break
furniture, and all kinds of things,
and now there's a lot less
trouble."

said. Union Considerations
By KATHY WEINBERGER
They are poorly educated and
unskilled. Many belong to
minority groups. Most are women.
Few are young. Although
Stanford custodians do dirty jobs
for low pay, they have little
choice.
"I guess I'm satisfied," a
woman who has worked here 14
years said. "I live close and 1 have
no complaints. I get sick leave and
vacation pay. I never worked
anywhere else. I'm not young and
I wasn't young when I started. I
don't have any education or
qualifications for anything else. I
was lucky to get this job when I
did."
For many custodians this was a
first job. Now they see no reason
for looking elsewhere.
One woman who has been here
II years explained, "I'll probably
work here until I retire. I'm a
little tired of it, but I don't know
where I'd go or what I'd get. At
my age it's hard to find anything
else. There's not much other
opportunity . I wouldn't want to
work in a hospital, and I'm not
trained for too many jobs."
Supervisors
A supervisor is in charge of the
maids and janitors in each large
dorm complex. This position, the
highest of three basic job levels, is
currently filled by four men and
four women, all white.
Eight men work on the
Custodian II level, earning from
$484-618 a month depending on
length of service. They "perform
duties requiring considerable
effort and use of industrial
custodial equipment," according
to the job description.
The 40 women who do lighter
physical work under the
Custodian I category draw wages
which run from $400 to $508 a
month.
The maids and janitors work
from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. with a

half hour lunch and two 15
minute breaks during the day. All
University residences with
standard room and board fees
provide regular custodial services,
including cleaning of windows,
hallways, bathrooms and lounges.
Room cleaning was ended
several years ago, but the
custodians thoroughly clean
student rooms during vacatons,
particularly in June.
Miss Student Contact
Most of the women regret that
their contact with students greatly
diminished when the room
cleaning duties were discontinued.
Most agreed that their
relationships with students end
after a cheerful "hello" in the
hallway.
"The students have classes to
go to and we have our work.
There's no time to stand and
talk," explained a Wilbur maid.
"We are instructed to be nice
with the students, but not to get
to know them too well,"
commented another maid. "I
guess they're afraid we'll do
special favors for people if we get
too friendly," she added.
Many custodians contacted by
the Daily were reluctant to
express their opinions, especially
during work hours. They seemed
afraid that their superiors might
disapprove and surprised that
anyone would care about their
jobs or their lives.
However, they are affected by
many current issues: low-cost
housing, child care, a union, and
racial and sex-linked
discrimination.
Housing Problems
Many regretted that they have

to live so faraway from Stanford.
"I need to drive 12 miles each
way every day, because I found
housing around here so
expensive," complained one maid.
Another, who commutes from
Sunnyvale, found homes there at
least $3,000 cheaper than in Palo
Alto. "They told us a couple of
years ago that the University
would build houses for workers. I
filled out two applications and I

"I was excited when I heard
about it, as living close would save
me time as well as money. I get
tired of driving through all the
traffic every day," she added.
Like other University
employees, most custodians had
young children when they began
working. Many women were able

to rush home alter work to be
with their children not long after
they got home from school.
Those with children of varied
ages, like Toyon maid, June
Monel, left their older children to
care for the younger ones.
"I think child care for the staff
is badly needed, but I'm in no
position to say if the University
will do anything," said Ray
Caldera, who is responsible for

Most custodians contacted had

an employee union here. Many
thought they had been given all

the years they came to understand
better.
"Some got uptight when we
first went co-ed, especially in
places like Lagunita. But now
they like it. The guys treat them
like mothers.
Marguerite Kissel, who started
working in Lagunita in 1942
before she moved to Roble in
1948 to become supervisor,
agreed with Cummings.

"Going co-ed was quite a
change I'll guarantee you. I wasn't
fond of the idea, but I got used to
it. You have to learn to accept
changes, I think," she
commented.
Edith Sue Yancy worked in
Roble two years before it was
opened to men. She admitted, "I
think the change to co-ed is pretty
nice. I can't complain. There are
unnecessary damages that we
didn't have before, but I think it's
pretty nice for girls and boys to
be together."
Caldera feels optimistic. "As
the women's rights thing moves
forward, women who have been

hesitant up to this point will begin
to step forward," he predicted.
"We are going to make every
effort to promote from within."
A big problem, according to
Cummings, is the small turnover
of employees, especially the men.
"It is hard to promote people
when there are almost no
openings. That is why there are no
people from minority groups in
supervisory positions," he noted.
"We are now trying to train
our janitors in maintenance skills
such as plumbing, carpentry-, and
electricity. Hopefully we will be
able to promote some to the level
of maintenance men and thereby
have openings in their positions,"
he said.
"So far we haven't considered
training women for maintenance,
because it requires moving heavy
furniture and appliances," he
continued.
She remembered the days
when "girls were glad to get
flowers and valentines and boys
would come and wait for their
dates downstairs," but she added,.
"I think they're happy here
together."
Monel, who worked in all-male
Toyon about nine years, was at
first a little leary of adding
women. "The change seemed a
little strange to me," she
commented.
She now likes Toyon coed.
"This way I get to talk to both
boys and girls — like being in my
own home," she said.

said. Union Considerations
By KATHY WEINBERGER
They are poorly educated and
unskilled. Many belong to
minority groups. Most are women.
Few are young. Although
Stanford custodians do dirty jobs
for low pay, they have little
choice.
"I guess I'm satisfied," a
woman who has worked here 14
years said. "I live close and 1 have
no complaints. I get sick leave and
vacation pay. I never worked
anywhere else. I'm not young and
I wasn't young when I started. I
don't have any education or
qualifications for anything else. I
was lucky to get this job when I
did."
For many custodians this was a
first job. Now they see no reason
for looking elsewhere.
One woman who has been here
II years explained, "I'll probably
work here until I retire. I'm a
little tired of it, but I don't know
where I'd go or what I'd get. At
my age it's hard to find anything
else. There's not much other
opportunity . I wouldn't want to
work in a hospital, and I'm not
trained for too many jobs."
Supervisors
A supervisor is in charge of the
maids and janitors in each large
dorm complex. This position, the
highest of three basic job levels, is
currently filled by four men and
four women, all white.
Eight men work on the
Custodian II level, earning from
$484-618 a month depending on
length of service. They "perform
duties requiring considerable
effort and use of industrial
custodial equipment," according
to the job description.
The 40 women who do lighter
physical work under the
Custodian I category draw wages
which run from $400 to $508 a
month.
The maids and janitors work
from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. with a

half hour lunch and two 15
minute breaks during the day. All
University residences with
standard room and board fees
provide regular custodial services,
including cleaning of windows,
hallways, bathrooms and lounges.
Room cleaning was ended
several years ago, but the
custodians thoroughly clean
student rooms during vacatons,
particularly in June.
Miss Student Contact
Most of the women regret that
their contact with students greatly
diminished when the room
cleaning duties were discontinued.
Most agreed that their
relationships with students end
after a cheerful "hello" in the
hallway.
"The students have classes to
go to and we have our work.
There's no time to stand and
talk," explained a Wilbur maid.
"We are instructed to be nice
with the students, but not to get
to know them too well,"
commented another maid. "I
guess they're afraid we'll do
special favors for people if we get
too friendly," she added.
Many custodians contacted by
the Daily were reluctant to
express their opinions, especially
during work hours. They seemed
afraid that their superiors might
disapprove and surprised that
anyone would care about their
jobs or their lives.
However, they are affected by
many current issues: low-cost
housing, child care, a union, and
racial and sex-linked
discrimination.
Housing Problems
Many regretted that they have

to live so faraway from Stanford.
"I need to drive 12 miles each
way every day, because I found
housing around here so
expensive," complained one maid.
Another, who commutes from
Sunnyvale, found homes there at
least $3,000 cheaper than in Palo
Alto. "They told us a couple of
years ago that the University
would build houses for workers. I
filled out two applications and I

"I was excited when I heard
about it, as living close would save
me time as well as money. I get
tired of driving through all the
traffic every day," she added.
Like other University
employees, most custodians had
young children when they began
working. Many women were able

to rush home alter work to be
with their children not long after
they got home from school.
Those with children of varied
ages, like Toyon maid, June
Monel, left their older children to
care for the younger ones.
"I think child care for the staff
is badly needed, but I'm in no
position to say if the University
will do anything," said Ray
Caldera, who is responsible for

Most custodians contacted had
little to say about the potential of
an employee union here. Many
thought they had been given all
the benefits they could ask for
and were not sure what purpose a
union would serve.
One women was more
optimistic than most. "With a

union things will get better," she
said, "People will be forced to do
something."
Two years ago, when student
rooms were cleaned by the maids,
the residence staff was 20 percent
larger, according to Residence
Manager Alan Cummings.
"All those people who wanted
to continue working here have
been relocated," he said. "Many
went to work at the hospital, and
a few went to the library and
Tresidder. Some quit, but we had
no layoffs."
He added, 'The employees
were all given positions with
equivalent salaries, and in some
cases they improved themselves."
Sex Discrimination Recognized
Caldera commented that he
only recently became aware of the
rigid sex differentiation in the two
non-supervisory positions.
"I guess it stemmed from the
old thing of the need to protect a
woman's femininity by
protecting her from hard work,"
he observed.
"We're trying to alleviate this
now. I think a woman should be
given the opportunity to be
promoted to a higher position if
she feels qualified to perform the
job," he added.
Most women, however, have
not considered trying to change
positions. One Wilbur maid
explained, "The janitors lift heavy
things, and we're not supposed to
lift over 25 pounds. Maybe some
women could lift more if they
tried, but not me."
Many of the custodians have
been here a long time, according
to Cummings. "Shizuko
Nishimura, who works in Lagunita

Court, has been here 33 years — a
lot longer than my office has," he
said.
"Things have changed,
including the start of co-ed
housing, and our employees have
been willing to adapt themselves
to the changes. They're willing to
try their best," he went on.
"A lot of our workers came
when people didn't have very
much and they couldn't
understand why students would
intentionally break things. They
thought the students must be
awfully rich or something. Over
the years they came to understand
better.
"Some got uptight when we
first went co-ed, especially in
places like Lagunita. But now
they like it. The guys treat them
