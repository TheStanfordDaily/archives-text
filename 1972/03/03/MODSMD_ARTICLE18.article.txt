# 'Beebee Fenstermaker'
## Night Of Nostalgia 
### DAN BRENNER 
"The Last Picture Show," the
nostalgic statement for the
penultimate generation, the
be-bopping duckbills of the fifties,
has rendered nostalgia a dramatic
legitmacy. So a period piece of
the early sixties, like William
Snyder's "The Days and Nights of
Beebee Fenstermaker" as
currently performed by the
Drama Department in the Little
Theater comes off as an expected
and appropriate excursion into the
societal netherland of the beat,
hep world that was once America.
And it comes off well, indeed,
considering the goulash of themes
that Snyder has put into his
theatrical recipe.
For instance, Robbi Levitow's
performance as the title charcter,
was an admirable , and by the
play's end, a victorious attempt to
tie together in one personality bits
of Tammy, That Girl, and a
first-rate spit broad. By the third
of three acts, when she celebrates
her mid-twentyish birthday in the
loneliness of a New York fiat, she
has managed to work out the
inconsistencies of her character
that drained her noticeably in the
first act.
She is not Beebee
Fenstermaker by nature and has
to work hard at playing this
unreal admixture. More at ease
when she threw cathartic temper
tantrums at other characters,
Levitow was unable to carry a
drawl that had somehow crept
into the script.
In fact the most offensive part
of an otherwise perceptive
performance is the use of an
annoying drawl by Beebee, who is
on stage most of the evening.
Walnut of Fear
The play is all about one
Beebee Fenstermaker, a
smalltowner who goes to New
York straight from a bachelors'
degree in hopes of writing a
autobiographical novel in three
months, which sounds hackneyed,
but isn't. The play unfolds as
Beebee, trapped in the walnut of
fear over failing to meet her self
and family imposed expectations,
learns to live with herself as she is
and isn't. By the end of the first

act, which ran a wee bit too long,
she is still saying things like "I
mean you have to stand out in
some way."
But she never does; Nor does
her family, who appear in cleverly
staged flashbacks. They are both
trapped by their own rhetoric,
their own blind faith that
someday, someway oh boy are
they going to make it. The three
sisters back home, all of whom are
admirably portrayed, with a gold
star next to the performance of
Carolyn Gillespie, sit and either
complain about how things are
and drool over the past or else
spew ragged cliches that seem
hollow as the changes of the
sixties — and of the change of
time generally — make the past
golden, the present empty, and
the future speculative at best.
They mope around a card table,
the syrupy atmosphere sponging
whatever is still in their
self-alienated beings. They are
stung by the change in time and
make their cardroom little more
than an infirmary in which one
can lick wounds with others.
Superficial Changes
Not so in New York: there life
for Beebee is changing, in a
superficial sense anyway. Schlitz
replaces Coca Cola, a hot pink slip
replaces her artists's smock, a
clumsy TV set replaces her
typewriter, while the unfinished
novel is gathering dust in a
deserted drawer. Although she has
degenerated, she has not grown
much. Caught in her insecurity
she alienates the only friends she
makes because unlike her, they
have given up on the great
American dream.
There's Nettie Joe, adroitly
handled by Cris Rose, whose
resignation to just being a
secretary and liking it infuriates
Beebee. But Beebee needs her
around as an upstairs neighbor
because she uses her as an object
upon which to project Beebee's
own failings. She doesn't respect
her, doesn't feel for her, but is
terrified when she learns that
Nettie Joe is getting married and
going to California. She even
considers Nettie's naive offer to
live with her when she goes to Los

Angeles.
Ed Busby, an M.A. who is
temporarily on welfare
indefinitely, is Beebee's
pseudo-boyfriend who mooches
off her secretary's income in
return "for being the leader."
Indeed that is what Beebee needs,
for in the four years since moving
to New York, she has become
nothing more than a secretary but
she still craves her dream of
success and importance which
Busby's leadership offers. Busby is
sloth and an intellectual slob, but
he knows, if only slight, who he
is.
He walks out after Beebee
blasts him for not playing out the
dream she had set up for him.
Busby is played by Roger Kosel
who feels for his role, especially in
his last scene, but whose hair
needs a little cropping in order to
jive with the detail playwright
Snyder has given to stage lines
about Hershey Bars, Lysol, and
phonograph records.
Unsympathetic Look-Back
All told, 'The Days and Nights
of Beebee Fenstermaker" is an
unsympathetic looking-back at
the Eisenhower-Kennedy years, a
psychological piece with some
transcendental tendencies, and a
social commentary on the
hollowness of men. The play is
resolved in the character of Bob
Smith (refreshingly played by
John Caldwell) who symbolizes
the unacceptable compromise that
Beebee has to make with her
undistinguished existence in the
New York secretary pool, which is
a far cry from being a smashing
novelist that she — and her family
— had thought she would be six
years before, when she came out
of school and into the world.
The play is good theater,
memorable at moments thanks to
the staging, the theme music, and
the sets. It is an apt production
for Stanford, at a time when
dreams are as common as
pancakes on a franchised griddle
and can sometimes fall just as flat.
("The Days and Nights of Beebee
Fenstermaker" plays tonight and
tomorrow night and again March
