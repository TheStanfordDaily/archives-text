# Salgo Excels In 'Rusalka'
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
Antonin Dvorak's water
nymph Rusalka rode the crest of a
lustrous and scintillating
orchestral performance in
Dinkelspiel Wednesday night.
Conductor Sandor Salgo drained
the Dvorak score to the very dregs
— indeed, he even made the dregs
seem palatable. But wonderful
though the music sounded,
however, under-tow from other
aspects of the production
hindered "Rusalka's" potential
for enchantment.
Dvorak called his opera a "lyric
fairy tale in three acts." To the
average American audience this
means (a) childishness, (b)
nonsensicality, and (c)
pointlessness. As usual, the
American audience strikes out.
This is to be expected. After all,
the television and cinema have
become our visual artificers; our
own visualizing powers have
become vestigial and are
presumably withering.
We no longer have the
imaginative strength to create
modern fairy tales or understand
the psychic realities of old ones.
Our witches are political (Angela
Davis, Mrs. Mitchell take your
pick). Our knights in shining
armor sell detergent. Our "soul"
— which is of such concern to
Rusalka — now helps a race define
the cultural barrier around itself.
Fall of Fairy Tales
The decline and fall of the
fairy tale is said, for the fact is
that fairly tales usually make an
uncommon amount of sense; their
archetypal grasp of humane and
psychic realities can be unerring,
scary. Some fairy tales are not for
adults, because their implications
are scarcely bearable. Far from
being vain meanderings, they
usually are desperately
preoccupied with the mean
realities of life. Any
anthropologist or medieval scholar
would agree. In fact, it is
interesting to note that the two
greatest modern tellers of fairy
tales, J.R.R. Tolkien (Lord of the
Ring) and Jorge Louis Borges, are
scholars steeped in medieval
literature.
And no one who values his life
would assert in the presence of a

Lord of the Ring-devotee that it is
infantile nonsense. Even the work
of Mark Twain, who
single-handedly Americanized (or
at least banished forever) the fairy
tale, has its subterranean caverns
containing psychic monsters and
witches. Modern critics have
amply shown that Huckleberry
Finn is no enchanting river idyll,
but a tissue of human distresses in
allegorical form.
My point is that the Ondine
legend which "Rusalka" tells is
not mere froo-fraw: it concerns a
perceived goal (here, love for a
human prince) for the enjoyment
of which a being will utterly
relinquish its intrinsic, inner
essence. Any relation to the Faut
legend is not coincidental. Indeed,
Rusalka is a kind of primeval
Faust, with the added overtones
of earth mother and the eternal
feminine about her.
I wish stage director John
Olon-Scrymgeour had given more
sense of this underlying
archetypal quality of the story. As
it was he was barely able to
acheive even the task of making
the stylized fairy-posing
consistently interesting. There
were some flaccid moments and
instances of failure to coordiante
the visual point with the musical
point. These lapses are surely best
ascribed to a cast generally stiff in
stage movement.
A Musical Crazy-Quilt
The real artistic energy of this
production was harnessed in the
orchestra pit. Dvorak's score is the
oddest damn thing. Imagine great
chunks of Wagnerian
through-composed music (1
spotted three leitmotifs that
verged on the plagiaristic!),
Tchaikovskyan march music
striaght out of Swan Lake,
Slavonic peasant dance segments
of hurdy-guardy simplicity, plus
an occasional dash of Brahmsian
lugubriousness, and all
orchestrated with an ear to the
unusual or unexpected sound a la
Berlioz. And these elements are
not mixed into an amalgamated

style by Dvorak so much as placed
end to end. The result,
stylistically, is a musical
crazy-quilt.
Thus, "Rusalka" is one of
those awesome challenges to the
good taste of a conductor and his
command of style. Sandor Salgo's
response was a msterly tour de
force. Taking each musical fashion
in its own right — downshifting
and accelerating where apt —
Salgo gave the opera a special
aesthetic integrity which
(ultimately) it has arathertenuous
claim to. Oscar Wilde was right
when he said, "It is style that
makes us believe in a thing —
nothing but style." And Salgo
made the musical melange of
"Rusalka" very believeable
indeed. And where — as at
Stanford — resources are limited
on most every way, the only sure
path to victory is a motivating
grasp of style.
But this is nothing new. It is no
secret that the past successes of
the Stanford Opera Theater were
all traceable to Salgo's
coordinating musical sensibilities.
These, combined with his
congeniality to most every
musical period and his
adventurous spirit, make him the
ideal of collegiate conductors. His
orchestra played exceptionally
well, especially in the exposed
woodwind and brass sections. I
should not that it is becoming a
nearly unique pleasure to hear
such a large, well-rehearsed
orchestra in such an intimate hall
these days—the sound was
exhilirating.
Vocal Ups and Downs
Vocally, the cast had its ups
and downs. As the Water King
Marc Clemens turned in the most
consistent and full-bodied
performance. His voice excited
confidence, interest and has a very
appealing timbre. Steve Covington
as the Prince exhibited a colorless
but well-focused mini-
Heldentenor — though he tired
toward the end. He will be a
shambles after singing four

straight nights!
The RusaJka of CJail Wilson
gave the impression of a good
natural voice in need of more
command of (he tricks and
techniques of sustained singing.
Still, she is> capable of nice
phrasing and produced some
beautiful moments. Visually, she
let Rusalka's purity and innocent ■
lapse into insipidity. Judith
Mahlberg, as the witch Jezibaba,
seemed ill cast, her voice lying too
high. There is nothing better than
a throaty contralto or mezzo witch
and I missed this.
The remaining voices and
chorus seemed generally to be
young, green and somewhat
breathy, without the technique l'>
allow the cutting edge of I heir
voices to emerge.
The worst comes last: the
settings failed. J hesitate to send
the designer to the gallows,
however, since he was probably
told, "Design whatever you
want... as long as it doesn't cost
more than $11.32." I realize the
Theater has been working on a
(ragged, frayed) shoestring all
along, but this particular opera
simply demanded more than was
forthcoming. The audience
needed all the imaginative
assistance it could get, but was
given a preposterously stark stape
that was all-too-well lighted. And
if ever an opera begged for scrim
treatment, this is the one.
Skimpitis, a terrible disease.
Also irking on a long-range
level was the simple fact that the
facilities for producing decent
opera (or drama for that matter)
in a medium-size hall do not exist
at Stanford. Most institutions of
higher learning — and not a few
high schools — put Stanford t<»
shame. Given its pretensions, the
University community should be
mortified bv this situation.

are scarcely bearable. Far from
being vain meanderings, they
usually are desperately
preoccupied with the mean
realities of life. Any
anthropologist or medieval scholar
would agree. In fact, it is
interesting to note that the two
greatest modern tellers of fairy
tales, J.R.R. Tolkien (Lord of the
Ring) and Jorge Louis Borges, are
scholars steeped in medieval
literature.
And no one who values his life
would assert in the presence of a

Lord of the Ring-devotee that it is
infantile nonsense. Even the work
of Mark Twain, who
single-handedly Americanized (or
at least banished forever) the fairy
tale, has its subterranean caverns
containing psychic monsters and
witches. Modern critics have
amply shown that Huckleberry
Finn is no enchanting river idyll,
but a tissue of human distresses in
allegorical form.
My point is that the Ondine
legend which "Rusalka" tells is
not mere froo-fraw: it concerns a
perceived goal (here, love for a
human prince) for the enjoyment
of which a being will utterly
relinquish its intrinsic, inner
essence. Any relation to the Faut
legend is not coincidental. Indeed,
Rusalka is a kind of primeval
Faust, with the added overtones
of earth mother and the eternal
feminine about her.
I wish stage director John
Olon-Scrymgeour had given more
sense of this underlying
archetypal quality of the story. As
it was he was barely able to
acheive even the task of making
the stylized fairy-posing
consistently interesting. There
were some flaccid moments and
instances of failure to coordiante
the visual point with the musical
point. These lapses are surely best
ascribed to a cast generally stiff in
stage movement.
A Musical Crazy-Quilt
The real artistic energy of this
production was harnessed in the
orchestra pit. Dvorak's score is the
oddest damn thing. Imagine great
chunks of Wagnerian
through-composed music (1
spotted three leitmotifs that
verged on the plagiaristic!),
Tchaikovskyan march music
striaght out of Swan Lake,
Slavonic peasant dance segments
of hurdy-guardy simplicity, plus
an occasional dash of Brahmsian
lugubriousness, and all
orchestrated with an ear to the
unusual or unexpected sound a la
Berlioz. And these elements are
not mixed into an amalgamated

style by Dvorak so much as placed
end to end. The result,
stylistically, is a musical
crazy-quilt.
Thus, "Rusalka" is one of
those awesome challenges to the
good taste of a conductor and his
command of style. Sandor Salgo's
response was a msterly tour de
force. Taking each musical fashion
in its own right — downshifting
and accelerating where apt —
Salgo gave the opera a special
aesthetic integrity which
(ultimately) it has arathertenuous
claim to. Oscar Wilde was right
when he said, "It is style that
makes us believe in a thing —
nothing but style." And Salgo
made the musical melange of
"Rusalka" very believeable
indeed. And where — as at
Stanford — resources are limited
on most every way, the only sure
path to victory is a motivating
grasp of style.
But this is nothing new. It is no
secret that the past successes of
the Stanford Opera Theater were
all traceable to Salgo's
coordinating musical sensibilities.
These, combined with his
congeniality to most every
musical period and his
adventurous spirit, make him the
ideal of collegiate conductors. His
orchestra played exceptionally
well, especially in the exposed
woodwind and brass sections. I
should not that it is becoming a
nearly unique pleasure to hear
such a large, well-rehearsed
orchestra in such an intimate hall
these days—the sound was
exhilirating.
Vocal Ups and Downs
Vocally, the cast had its ups
and downs. As the Water King
Marc Clemens turned in the most
consistent and full-bodied
performance. His voice excited
confidence, interest and has a very
appealing timbre. Steve Covington
as the Prince exhibited a colorless
but well-focused mini-
Heldentenor — though he tired
toward the end. He will be a
shambles after singing four

straight nights!
The RusaJka of CJail Wilson
gave the impression of a good
natural voice in need of more
command of (he tricks and
techniques of sustained singing.
Still, she is> capable of nice
phrasing and produced some
beautiful moments. Visually, she

lapse into insipidity. Judith
Mahlberg, as the witch Jezibaba,
seemed ill cast, her voice lying too
high. There is nothing better than
a throaty contralto or mezzo witch
and I missed this.
The remaining voices and
chorus seemed generally to be
young, green and somewhat
breathy, without the technique l'>
allow the cutting edge of I heir
voices to emerge.
The worst comes last: the
settings failed. J hesitate to send
the designer to the gallows,
however, since he was probably
told, "Design whatever you
want... as long as it doesn't cost
more than $11.32." I realize the
Theater has been working on a
(ragged, frayed) shoestring all
along, but this particular opera
simply demanded more than was
forthcoming. The audience
needed all the imaginative
assistance it could get, but was
given a preposterously stark stape
that was all-too-well lighted. And
if ever an opera begged for scrim
treatment, this is the one.
Skimpitis, a terrible disease.
Also irking on a long-range
level was the simple fact that the
facilities for producing decent
opera (or drama for that matter)
in a medium-size hall do not exist
at Stanford. Most institutions of
higher learning — and not a few
high schools — put Stanford t<»
shame. Given its pretensions, the
University community should be

Dvorak called his opera a "lyric

consistently interesting. There
were some flaccid moments and

the visual point with the musical
point. These lapses are surely best
ascribed to a cast generally stiff in
stage movement.
A Musical Crazy-Quilt
The real artistic energy of this
production was harnessed in the
orchestra pit. Dvorak's score is the
oddest damn thing. Imagine great
chunks of Wagnerian
through-composed music (1
spotted three leitmotifs that
verged on the plagiaristic!),
Tchaikovskyan march music
striaght out of Swan Lake,
Slavonic peasant dance segments
of hurdy-guardy simplicity, plus
an occasional dash of Brahmsian
lugubriousness, and all
orchestrated with an ear to the
unusual or unexpected sound a la
Berlioz. And these elements are
not mixed into an amalgamated

style by Dvorak so much as placed
end to end. The result,
stylistically, is a musical
crazy-quilt.
Thus, "Rusalka" is one of
those awesome challenges to the
good taste of a conductor and his
command of style. Sandor Salgo's
response was a msterly tour de
force. Taking each musical fashion
in its own right — downshifting
and accelerating where apt —
Salgo gave the opera a special
aesthetic integrity which
(ultimately) it has arathertenuous
claim to. Oscar Wilde was right
when he said, "It is style that
makes us believe in a thing —
nothing but style." And Salgo
made the musical melange of
"Rusalka" very believeable
indeed. And where — as at
Stanford — resources are limited
on most every way, the only sure
path to victory is a motivating
grasp of style.
But this is nothing new. It is no
secret that the past successes of
the Stanford Opera Theater were
all traceable to Salgo's
coordinating musical sensibilities.
These, combined with his
congeniality to most every
musical period and his
adventurous spirit, make him the
ideal of collegiate conductors. His
orchestra played exceptionally
well, especially in the exposed
woodwind and brass sections. I
should not that it is becoming a
nearly unique pleasure to hear
such a large, well-rehearsed
orchestra in such an intimate hall
these days—the sound was
exhilirating.
Vocal Ups and Downs
Vocally, the cast had its ups
and downs. As the Water King
Marc Clemens turned in the most
consistent and full-bodied
performance. His voice excited
confidence, interest and has a very
appealing timbre. Steve Covington
as the Prince exhibited a colorless
but well-focused mini-
Heldentenor — though he tired
toward the end. He will be a
shambles after singing four

straight nights!
The RusaJka of CJail Wilson
gave the impression of a good
natural voice in need of more
command of (he tricks and
techniques of sustained singing.
Still, she is> capable of nice
phrasing and produced some
beautiful moments. Visually, she
let Rusalka's purity and innocent ■
lapse into insipidity. Judith
Mahlberg, as the witch Jezibaba,
seemed ill cast, her voice lying too
high. There is nothing better than
a throaty contralto or mezzo witch
and I missed this.
The remaining voices and
chorus seemed generally to be
young, green and somewhat
breathy, without the technique l'>
allow the cutting edge of I heir
voices to emerge.
The worst comes last: the
settings failed. J hesitate to send
the designer to the gallows,
however, since he was probably
told, "Design whatever you
want... as long as it doesn't cost
more than $11.32." I realize the
Theater has been working on a
(ragged, frayed) shoestring all
along, but this particular opera
simply demanded more than was
forthcoming. The audience
needed all the imaginative
assistance it could get, but was
given a preposterously stark stape
that was all-too-well lighted. And
if ever an opera begged for scrim
treatment, this is the one.
Skimpitis, a terrible disease.
Also irking on a long-range
level was the simple fact that the
facilities for producing decent
opera (or drama for that matter)
in a medium-size hall do not exist
at Stanford. Most institutions of
higher learning — and not a few
high schools — put Stanford t<»
shame. Given its pretensions, the
University community should be

Antonin Dvorak's water
nymph Rusalka rode the crest of a
lustrous and scintillating
orchestral performance in
Dinkelspiel Wednesday night.
Conductor Sandor Salgo drained
the Dvorak score to the very dregs
— indeed, he even made the dregs
seem palatable. But wonderful
though the music sounded,
however, under-tow from other
aspects of the production
hindered "Rusalka's" potential
for enchantment.
Dvorak called his opera a "lyric
fairy tale in three acts." To the
average American audience this
means (a) childishness, (b)
nonsensicality, and (c)
pointlessness. As usual, the
American audience strikes out.
This is to be expected. After all,
the television and cinema have
become our visual artificers; our
own visualizing powers have
become vestigial and are
presumably withering.
We no longer have the
imaginative strength to create
modern fairy tales or understand
the psychic realities of old ones.
Our witches are political (Angela
Davis, Mrs. Mitchell take your
pick). Our knights in shining
armor sell detergent. Our "soul"
— which is of such concern to
Rusalka — now helps a race define
the cultural barrier around itself.
Fall of Fairy Tales
The decline and fall of the
fairy tale is said, for the fact is
that fairly tales usually make an
uncommon amount of sense; their
archetypal grasp of humane and
psychic realities can be unerring,
scary. Some fairy tales are not for
adults, because their implications
are scarcely bearable. Far from
being vain meanderings, they
usually are desperately
preoccupied with the mean
realities of life. Any
anthropologist or medieval scholar
would agree. In fact, it is
interesting to note that the two
greatest modern tellers of fairy
tales, J.R.R. Tolkien (Lord of the
Ring) and Jorge Louis Borges, are
scholars steeped in medieval
literature.
And no one who values his life
would assert in the presence of a

Lord of the Ring-devotee that it is
infantile nonsense. Even the work
of Mark Twain, who
single-handedly Americanized (or
at least banished forever) the fairy
tale, has its subterranean caverns
containing psychic monsters and
witches. Modern critics have
amply shown that Huckleberry
Finn is no enchanting river idyll,
but a tissue of human distresses in
allegorical form.
My point is that the Ondine
legend which "Rusalka" tells is
not mere froo-fraw: it concerns a
perceived goal (here, love for a
human prince) for the enjoyment
of which a being will utterly
relinquish its intrinsic, inner
essence. Any relation to the Faut
legend is not coincidental. Indeed,
Rusalka is a kind of primeval
Faust, with the added overtones
of earth mother and the eternal
feminine about her.
I wish stage director John
Olon-Scrymgeour had given more
sense of this underlying
archetypal quality of the story. As
it was he was barely able to
acheive even the task of making
the stylized fairy-posing
consistently interesting. There
were some flaccid moments and
instances of failure to coordiante
the visual point with the musical

"Rusalka" very believeable
indeed. And where — as at
Stanford — resources are limited
on most every way, the only sure
path to victory is a motivating
grasp of style.
But this is nothing new. It is no
secret that the past successes of
the Stanford Opera Theater were
all traceable to Salgo's
coordinating musical sensibilities.
These, combined with his
congeniality to most every
musical period and his
adventurous spirit, make him the
ideal of collegiate conductors. His
orchestra played exceptionally
well, especially in the exposed
woodwind and brass sections. I
should not that it is becoming a
nearly unique pleasure to hear
such a large, well-rehearsed
orchestra in such an intimate hall
these days—the sound was
exhilirating.
Vocal Ups and Downs
Vocally, the cast had its ups
and downs. As the Water King
Marc Clemens turned in the most
consistent and full-bodied
performance. His voice excited
confidence, interest and has a very
appealing timbre. Steve Covington
as the Prince exhibited a colorless
but well-focused mini-
Heldentenor — though he tired
toward the end. He will be a
shambles after singing four

straight nights!
The RusaJka of CJail Wilson
gave the impression of a good
natural voice in need of more
command of (he tricks and
techniques of sustained singing.
Still, she is> capable of nice
phrasing and produced some
beautiful moments. Visually, she
let Rusalka's purity and innocent ■
lapse into insipidity. Judith
Mahlberg, as the witch Jezibaba,
seemed ill cast, her voice lying too
high. There is nothing better than
a throaty contralto or mezzo witch
and I missed this.
The remaining voices and
chorus seemed generally to be
young, green and somewhat
breathy, without the technique l'>
allow the cutting edge of I heir
voices to emerge.
The worst comes last: the
settings failed. J hesitate to send
the designer to the gallows,
however, since he was probably
told, "Design whatever you
want... as long as it doesn't cost
more than $11.32." I realize the
Theater has been working on a
(ragged, frayed) shoestring all
along, but this particular opera
simply demanded more than was
forthcoming. The audience
needed all the imaginative
assistance it could get, but was
given a preposterously stark stape
that was all-too-well lighted. And
if ever an opera begged for scrim
treatment, this is the one.
Skimpitis, a terrible disease.
Also irking on a long-range
level was the simple fact that the
facilities for producing decent
opera (or drama for that matter)
in a medium-size hall do not exist
at Stanford. Most institutions of
higher learning — and not a few
high schools — put Stanford t<»
shame. Given its pretensions, the
University community should be
mortified bv this situation.
