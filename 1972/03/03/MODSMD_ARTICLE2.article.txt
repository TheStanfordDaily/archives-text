# To Head Student Affairs
## Lyons Named New Dean 
### BOB MICHELET 
James W. Lyons, dean of students
at Haverford (Pa.) College, has been
appointed Stanford's new dean of
student affairs.
Lyons, 39, will succeed Robert
Freelen, acting dean of students since
the September, 1970 resignation of
Peter Bulkeley.
President Lyman, in announcing
the appointment yesterday, said he
was "very pleased to be able to name
an individual of Jim Lyon's experience
and ability."
An eight-person search committee
selected Lyons over two other finalists
â€” Freelen and San Diego State dean of
students Willie Smith. The University
received more than 100 applications
for the job.
During his eight years at Haverford,
a small liberal arts men's college,
Lyons presided over what he called an
"85-90 percent change in the entire
residence system."
In a telephone interview with the
Daily last night, Lyons Jso noted
"very substantial changto in the
diversity of the student body," while
he was there.
In addition to growing from 450 to

700, the Haverford student body
became "much more diverse," Lyons
said, in terms of racial, geographic and
economic factors.
Before moving to Haverford in
1963, he was assistant director of
Indiana Memorial Union. He also held
administrative and counseling
positions in the Indiana residence
system.
Good Impression
Dr. James McClenahan, chairman of
the search committee, said the group
had a "very good impression" of
Lyons, and cited his "strong character
and genuine sympathy with students."
Chuck Peterson, a graduate business
student and committee member, said
he was "favorably impressed" by
Lyons, especially by his suggestions on
ways to manage the office.
Peterson said he was looking for a
person "sensitive to fundamental
rights and wrongs," and that he rated
Lyons highly on this.
Tina Swent, another of the four
student members of the search
committee, was "quite favorable" to
Lyons, and said she looked for a
person who could "take responsibility
and initiative and relate to students."
Duties Uncertain
The committee was originally asked
to find a "director of student
services," but it felt that title was
inappropriate. The name "dean of
students," was also rejected for what
was felt were its unfavorable
connotations.
McClenahan, said the committee
wanted to keep the duties of the office
"flexible" and "somewhat defined by
the capabilities of the person."
Some have argued for
vice-presidential status for such a job,
but the specific duties and scope of
Lyons' position will be worked out
between he and Lyman.
Change Urged
Lyons stressed "the importance of
any institution of higher education
finding ways to change and be more
responsive to student needs."

An important question facing
universities, he said, is "can we learn
to respect powerful and important
differences." This clearly involves
racial minorities, he said, but also
includes political and social groups.
"It is terribly important," he
added, "for the institution to listen
carefully and learn," and pointed to its
"obligation to learn as much as we can
about handling diversity."
Challenges Cited
He said he was attracted to
Stanford because the job offered
"professional opportunities and
challenges too tempting to resist."
He noted a tendency at small
colleges, marked by a "sense of social
mission," to create a "utopian
experience."
"There are no hiding places on the
small campus," he told the search
committee. A teacher or administrator
"must establish relationships marked
by openness, candor, honesty, and
trust if he is to become and remain
effective."
The challenge at Stanford he said, is
"to what extent can some of these
same ideas be effected in a large
university."
Lyons is a former chairman of the
American Friends Service Committee
National Youth Projects Committee,
and is presently a member of the
National Action Committee on Drug
Abuse Education.
He received his bachelor's degree
from Alleghany College, and masters
and Ph.D. degrees in education from
Indiana.
Lyons said he hopes to visit the
campus at least once before moving
this summer, but no plans have been
made yet.
Freelen will remain as acting dean
until Lyons' arrival. Lyman praised
Freelen "for undertaking a difficult
assignment for an indefinite period,
and for discharging the responsibilities
of the office with conscience, good
judgement and strong loyalty to the
University."

among 24 who tried out Wednesday. The old dollies went to their dorms last night putting feathers in the hair of the
chosen girls while they were eating dinner. Then everyone went for ice cream. The new dollies are from left to right:
