# Swimmers Travel To Pac-8
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
The Stanford swimming team
is in Portland this weekend for the
Pacific-Eight Championships. The
meet is a three day affair running
Thursday through Saturday.
Leading Stanford will be Brian
Job, defending Pacific-Eight
champion in the 100 and 200
breastroke. Coach Jim Gaughran
believes at this meet there will be
"an interesting situation for the
breastrokers as seven of the top
10 breastrokers in the country
swim in the Pacific-Eight."
Among those Job will be facing is
Rick Colella of Washington
currently the second ranked
breastroker in the country. Colella
beat Job last summer at the AAU
National Championships in the
100 and 200 breastroke. Captain
Dave Shilling the country's third
ranked breastroker will give both
Job and Colella a battle in the 200
breast. Job's stiffest competition
in the 100 breast besides Colella
will come from Tom Bruce of
UCLA, the American record

holder in this event.
Terry Sutton, currently the
fourth ranked 1000 freestyler in
the country, should do well in
both the 500 and 1650 freestyles.
In the 1650, Sutton will be facing
Tom Mcßreen of USC and Steve
Geuter of UCLA, both were
NCAA finalists last year.
Gaughran states, "Sutton is a
known quantity now as a result of
the USC meet and this will be his
first real test under those
circumstances."
Freshman, Randy Whitchurch,
has a shot at winning the 200
backstroke and should make the
finals in the 100. Other swimmers
given a good chance to score
points are Martin Pedley, Steve
Carey, and Ken Hammer in the 50
and 100 free; Freshman Jack
Deppe in the 200 back, John
Stalker in the 100 and 200 fly,
and Dean Anderson in the 100
and 200 free; Rick Longinnotti in
the 100 and 200 fly and Tim
Broderick in the 200 and 500
free.

Gaughran in discussing the
team's preparation for this meet
states, "The team is not very well
rested for this meet, but the
pressure of hard workouts is off."
Coming off a relatively easy week
the team is more rested for this
meet then for the LA trip. The
swimmers are not, however,
nearly as rested as they will be for
the NCAA Championships later
this month.
A big question mark for this
meet is the performance of the
freshmen. Some of the freshmen
have not yet performed to the
level they achieved in high school.
Gaughran believes this is because
they come from a variety of
different swimming programs and
that it takes time for the freshmen
to gain confidence in themselves
and the Stanford program.
Gaughran, as a result, is
"operating in the dark" as to how
well they will perform this
weekend. If the freshmen are able
to do well Stanford will be in
good shape for the NCAA's.

(JSC is considered a shoo-in for
the team title based on their
tremendous depth. UCLA, the
defending champion, has an
outside chance of beating USC,
but will need outstanding
performances from its entire
squad to be able to pull off an
upset. Stanford will be battling
Washington for the third spot. If
Stanfords sprinters do well the
Indians should have no problem in
beating the Huskies. All four
teams are figured to finish in the
top six at the NCAA
Championships.
The Pacific-Eight meet is the
last meet in which a swimmer can
make times to qualify for the
NCAA Championships. Presently
only Brain Job, Dave Shilling,
Martin Pedley, Randy
Whitchurch, and Terry Sutton
have NCAA cut-off times. Many
members of the squad are close to
these times and if they wish to
swim in the NCAA meet they will
have to do well this weekend.

the country, should do well in
both the 500 and 1650 freestyles.
In the 1650, Sutton will be facing
Tom Mcßreen of USC and Steve
Geuter of UCLA, both were
NCAA finalists last year.
Gaughran states, "Sutton is a
known quantity now as a result of
the USC meet and this will be his
first real test under those
circumstances."
Freshman, Randy Whitchurch,
has a shot at winning the 200
backstroke and should make the
finals in the 100. Other swimmers
given a good chance to score
points are Martin Pedley, Steve
Carey, and Ken Hammer in the 50
and 100 free; Freshman Jack
Deppe in the 200 back, John
Stalker in the 100 and 200 fly,
and Dean Anderson in the 100
and 200 free; Rick Longinnotti in
the 100 and 200 fly and Tim
Broderick in the 200 and 500
free.

Gaughran in discussing the
team's preparation for this meet
states, "The team is not very well
rested for this meet, but the
pressure of hard workouts is off."
Coming off a relatively easy week
the team is more rested for this
meet then for the LA trip. The
swimmers are not, however,
nearly as rested as they will be for
the NCAA Championships later
this month.
A big question mark for this
meet is the performance of the
freshmen. Some of the freshmen
have not yet performed to the
level they achieved in high school.
Gaughran believes this is because
they come from a variety of
different swimming programs and
that it takes time for the freshmen
to gain confidence in themselves
and the Stanford program.
Gaughran, as a result, is
"operating in the dark" as to how
well they will perform this
weekend. If the freshmen are able
to do well Stanford will be in
good shape for the NCAA's.

(JSC is considered a shoo-in for
the team title based on their
tremendous depth. UCLA, the
defending champion, has an
outside chance of beating USC,
but will need outstanding
performances from its entire
squad to be able to pull off an
upset. Stanford will be battling
Washington for the third spot. If
Stanfords sprinters do well the
Indians should have no problem in
beating the Huskies. All four
teams are figured to finish in the
top six at the NCAA
Championships.
The Pacific-Eight meet is the
last meet in which a swimmer can
make times to qualify for the
NCAA Championships. Presently
only Brain Job, Dave Shilling,
Martin Pedley, Randy
Whitchurch, and Terry Sutton
have NCAA cut-off times. Many
members of the squad are close to
these times and if they wish to
swim in the NCAA meet they will
have to do well this weekend.

A BATTLE FOR THE BALL—Stanford's rugby team travels to Berkeley this weekend for a game that will
determine the Big Scrum Axe. Cal took a 13-point lead in the two-game series by defeating Stanford, 22-9
last Saturday. This exciting game will begin at 1:30.
The Stanford swimming team
is in Portland this weekend for the
Pacific-Eight Championships. The
meet is a three day affair running
Thursday through Saturday.
Leading Stanford will be Brian
Job, defending Pacific-Eight
champion in the 100 and 200
breastroke. Coach Jim Gaughran
believes at this meet there will be
"an interesting situation for the
breastrokers as seven of the top
10 breastrokers in the country
swim in the Pacific-Eight."
Among those Job will be facing is
Rick Colella of Washington
currently the second ranked
breastroker in the country. Colella
beat Job last summer at the AAU
National Championships in the
100 and 200 breastroke. Captain
Dave Shilling the country's third
ranked breastroker will give both
Job and Colella a battle in the 200
breast. Job's stiffest competition
in the 100 breast besides Colella
will come from Tom Bruce of
UCLA, the American record

holder in this event.
Terry Sutton, currently the
fourth ranked 1000 freestyler in
the country, should do well in
both the 500 and 1650 freestyles.
