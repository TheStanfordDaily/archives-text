# Baseball Team Wins A Pair
## 
### MIKE HERMAN 
When the Stanford varsity baseball team finally
walked off the Sunken field yesterday, after its
game with the University of San Francisco had been
called on account of darkness, the very small crowd
of hearty fans who had withstood all the hardships
of an eleven inning, three hour and fifteen minute
game could only shake their heads in amazement of
what they had just witnessed.
As the climax of a three-day, midweek series of
games, which saw the Indians defeat San Jose State,
8-2, and romp over Santa Clara, 7-1, yesterday's
game stood out as the most sensational of the trio, a
contest in which freak plays were commonplace,
while the teams competed to determine which could
make the most unusual series of plays.
The game started routinely enough, as a pitching
duel developed between USF's Bob Nolan and the
Indians' Nick Peterson.
In the fourth inning, Rod Boone
smashed a homerun that disappeared over the 375
sign in left-center field. The score remained 1-0 until
the eighth inning, when Stanford scored what
appeared to be an insurance run on a walk to
Peterson, a force out charged to thirdbaseman

Mickey Aguirre, a walk to Williams and a long
double off the wall by Boone.
Yet in the top of the
ninth, the Dons broke loose and combined a ground
rule double, a single to center and a double to right
into two runs to tie. Stanford was not able to score
in its half of the ninth, sending the game into
extra-innings.
USF went down in order in the top half of the
tenth, but the Cards refused to follow suit. Aguirre
led off with a single, followed by a similar hit by
Williams. Up stepped Ail-American Rod Boone,
with a runner in scoring position and no one out. He
responded by smashing a ball toward second base,
where shortstop Bill Downing made a sensational
stop, tagged out Aguirre as he left second base, in
the same motion, he touched the sliding Williams
with his glove hand, and finally, flipped the ball to
first to beat a bewildered Boone, who soon realized
that he had indeed hit into a triple play.
With two outs in the eleventh inning, Downing,
who had just saved the game, belted a homerun off
the tiring Peterson, A walk to
firstbaseman Tim Wilson, a single by catcher Bob
Reese and a two-base error produced the tying run.
