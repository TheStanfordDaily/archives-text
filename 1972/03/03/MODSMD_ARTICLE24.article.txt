# Robertson Nears SF Golf Title
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford freshman Bruce
Robertson is only two victories
away from adding the San
Francisco City Championship to
his long list of golfing
accomplishments.
Robertson, the tournament's
co-medalist with Stanford captain
Tom Keelin, will face 56 year old
veteran Mat Palacio tomorrow
morning in a 36 hole semifinal
match at Harding Park. The
winner of the Robertson-Palacio

match will face either Mark Lye
or John Cranston in Sunday's 36
hole final.
Last weekend Robertson
defeated Ray Healy on the second
sudden death hole in Saturday's
third round and ousted Dan
Johnson 2 and 1 in the
quarterfinals on Sunday.
Although he was continually
struggling during Saturday's
round, Robertson regained his
form on Sunday with an even par
performance.

Meanwhile, Lye was playing the
best golf of the tournament in the
opposite bracket. The San Jose
State redshirt was two under par
in both of his matches, including a
5 and 4 quarterfinal victory over
Stanford's Dave Baskins.
It seems likely that Robertson
and Lye will meet in Sunday's
finals. If Robertson is on his
game, he should outlast the much
shorter hitting Palacio and Lye is
picked to defeat Cranston.
Both Robertson and Lye are
capable of extremely hot rounds.
Robertson shot a three under par
69 at Harding during the
qualifying rounds and Lye was 4
under par for his two matches last
weekend. Robertson also has a
five under par 66 to his credit on
the Stanford course.
Although he admits that "I'm
not really playing very well,"
Robertson hopes to add the City
title to his other impressive
honors. He has already won the
Northern California Juniors, the
Northern California Tournament
of Champions, was medalist in the
Trans-Mississippi Amateur, second
to the medalist in the U.S. Junior,
and reached the semifinals last
year in both the City tournament
and the California Amateur.
