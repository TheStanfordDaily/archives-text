# Indians Hope For Upset
## Cagers Face USC 
### Bill Claster 
Stanford's basketball team closes out a relatively successful season
with games this Friday and Saturday night with USC and UCLA.
Needless to say, the Indians will have a difficult time improving either
their league record of 5-7 or their overall mark of 10-13.
The Indians will meet a very different USC team from the one that
they lost 65-63 to earlier this season. The Trojans have since lost
Ail-American guard Paul Westphal and have gone into a one-guard
offense. 6'2" Dan Anderson controls the USC tempo, and tries to set
up 6'6" Marc Palmer, 6'10" Mike Westra, 6'B" Ron Riley and 6'6"
Joe Mackey for inside shots. USC looks for the mismatch and tries to
exploit it. They are 8-3 in Pacific-8 play, and to say the least, are
disheartened by the unfortunate injuries that have hampered them
throughout the season.
If the Tribe is unable to get past the Trojans and falls as expected
to UCLA, they will end the season with precisely the same amount of
losses that the Bruins have incurred over the last nine years. The
number one ranked Uclans are 23-0 on the season, and many feel that
this may be the greatest team in the history of college basketball.
Led by the premier center in college today, 6'10" Bill Walton, the
Bruins are strong at all positions. 6'5" Larry Farmer and 6'6" Keith
Wilkes are solid forwards, who like all of Coach John Wooden's
players, play equally well at both ends of the court. Guard Henry
Bibby is a superb outside shooter, and he teams well with sophomore
Greg Lee in triggering the UCLA fast break.
UCLA is currently riding the crest of a 38 game winning streak and
is in good position to challenge USF's record of 60 in a row. Bibby is
the only senior among the top nine players, and UCLA will only be
stronger next season.
This weekend's games will mark the end of Claude Terry's brilliant
career at Stanford. Having become the top scorer in Indian history,
Terry's next accomplishments will come in the pros. These games will
also be the final appearances for Bob Nicholson, Darrel Fregia and
Gary: Cain.
For the Indians to beat USC, they must shoot a high percentage
and prevent the Trojans from getting second and third shots. Nothing
short of a miracle will be required for Stanford to beat the Uclans. If
the Tribe can even stay as close as the five points that they lost to the
Bruins by last year, it will be a moral victory.
