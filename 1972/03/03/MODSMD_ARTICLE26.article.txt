# UCLA Perpetuates Dynasty
## 
### BILL CLASTER 
The UCLA Bruins have remained on top of
the college basketball world for eight of the
last night years. No other team in any major
inter-collegiate sport has ever even appraoched
their incredible success. Furthermore, unlike
pro dynasties such s the New York Yankees or
Boston Celtics, the cast of the champion
Bruins has annually undergone change. UCLA
has been able to win with big teams, small
teams, fast teams and slow teams.
UCLA's unparalleled success is the result of
excellent coaching and some extraordinary
timing. When the UCLA teams of 1964 and
1969 put together back to back national
championships, it was only unusual in that
this feat was accomplished without the
benefit of any starters over 6'6". San
Francisco, Cincinnati and Kentucky had each
previously won two titles in succession.
Lew Alcindor
However, unlike the other repeating
champions, the Bruins won their titles at a
time when the greatest high school player in
history was a senior. Lew Alcindor was duly
impressed by UCLA's program, its coach and
its sparkling new pavilion. He, along with
three other high school ail-Americans cast
their lots with UCLA, and the dynasty was
started.
Alcindor and his mates eased to three
national championships, although when he
was a freshman, the Bruin team of 1966
"slumped" to an 18-8 mark. Lew performed
superbly for UCLA, but hardly hard to carry
the whole load. He was surrounded by pro
stars of today such as Lucius Allen, John
Vallely, Sidney Wicks, Curtis Rowe and Steve
Patterson.
What had occured at UCLA was the
transformation of normal college basketball
program into a virtually unstoppable machine.

The better UCLA did, the more top flight
players wanted to go there. For the first time
in college basketball history, there was one
best team. For a high school senior, nothing
could seem more prestigious than a starting
role on the UCLA basketball team. Coach
John Wooden was in the unique position of
being able to get almost any player that he
wanted.
This unprecedented influx of high school
stars to the Westwood campus led to a certain
amount of disappointment. The Bruin teams
of 1969, 1970 and 1971 all included at least
five players who rarely saw action, yet were
unquestionably talented enough to play
almost anywhere else.
Stockpile of Talent
This stockpiling of talent is reflected very
well in this year's team. UCLA's second-string
center, Swen Nater, is probably one of the top
ten centers in the nation. Bill Walton has
called him "the toughest man I've had to face
all year." Larry Hollyfield, a 6'5" forward
played in 92 consecutive winning games in
high school and junior college, yet cannot
crack the starting line-up. Currently Hollyfield
is the second leading shooter in the Pacific-8.
Two men who didn't make this year's
team, 6'3" Marv Vitatoe and 6'6" Jay
Helman, were high school ail-Americans who
starred on the Frosh team of 1969-70, and
red-shirted on last year's squad. These are two
outstanding players who will probably never
get a chance to play. They most likely regret
not following the path of their frosh
teammate, Scott Jones, who transfered to
Utah and is now one of the leading scorers
there.
Talented Frosh
The talent deluge has not ended. In
addition to this year's three starting
sophomores, the Bruin Frosh team includes a

super 6'3" guard and a very strong 6'B"
forward.
Nevertheless, other teams have had lots of
talent and have not won. UCLA's coaching
system seems to have made the difference.
John Wooden's teams cannot be characterized
in any one particular way. They can run, they
can pass, they can even stall. But no matter
what they do, they do it with confidence. The
UCLA players do not panic.
They are drilled in fundamentals and play
in a mechanical yet exciting fashion. They use
the backboard whenever possible, they foul
very infrequently and they balance the court
both offensively and defensively. Most
importantly though, UCLA players are clutch.
They have pulled out numerous games in the
last seconds, and have won 28 consecutive
NCAA playoff games.
Sound Personnel
Wooden's insistence on fundamentally
sound personnel, though not always popular
with some of his players, has proven to be
incredibly successful. UCLA's record over the
last nine years is 242-15, and they have won
seven of the last eight national championships.
The Bruins have won 100 out of 102 games
played in Pauley Pavilion (USC has beaten
them twice). The arena itself provides a
tremendous advantage to UCLA. Not only is
it always packed with 12,000 rabid fans, but
seven national championship banners hanging
from the ceiling only add to the opposition's
pre-game anxiety. This home court advantage
even extends to the extremely tight nets,
which according to Wooden, give UCLA a
four to six point advantage per game.
Coach Wooden always says,"I never ask a
team of mine to win, only to do their best."
With his personnel, the best can only spell
victory.
