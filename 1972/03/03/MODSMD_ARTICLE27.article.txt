# Steve Shupe 'Crashes The Boards' For Stanford
## 
### STAN WILSON 
Meet Steve Shupe — Stanford
Engineering student and impartial
judge for the 1972 Stanford dollie
tryouts. But every Friday and
Saturday night, just as the sun is
going down, Steve can be seen
ducking into a phone booth or
locker room, and donning his red
and white uniform,
mild-mannered Steve the Student
becomes mild-mannered Steve the
Basketball Player. Steve has
played excellent basketball all
year, but Stanford may need a
superman performance from him
for this weekend's battles with
USC and UCLA.
The 6'6", slender sophomore
from Honolulu, Hawaii, is
currently the number one
rebounder for the Stanford
varsity, and seventh in the
Pacific-Eight Conference. Seventh,
in a tough, physical league with
such stars as Ron Rily of USC,
Washington's Steve Hawes, Cal's
Ansley Truitt, and Bill Walton of
UCLA. They all have two
advantages over Steve. All are
several inches taller, and all have

an avid following from the press.
But headlines or no, none of them
have Steve's determination.
Steve was the second leading
rebounder and third leading scorer
on a 1971 frosh team that
compiled a 15-3 record. His
strengths are rebounding, and a
very physical style of defensive
play. Steve constantly
draws the difficult assignment of
fronting and containing the
opposition's big man, and time
and time again he has done an
outstanding job.
One of those big men is
UCLA's super-sophomore, Bill
Walton, "There's no question
that he's the best I've played
against," said Steve. "He has a
good touch, excellent guickness,
and sweet moves. He does
everything well."
Steve and the rest of the team
have expressed confidence in this
weekends series at Maples
Pavilion, against SC and UCLA.
"We've been anticipating USC
since that last time we played
them," says Steve. That last time
Stanford and USC met was in Los

Angeles, when the Trojans eked
out a two point victory on a
questionable last-second field goal
by star Paul Westphal. "We're
almost over-confident about SC,"
continued Steve.
Steve expressed guarded
optimism about the UCLA game
on Saturday night. "I really think
we can beat them. The key word
is patience." Stanford must "crash
the boards" and make a "good
shot selection" in order to beat
the defending national champions.
Surprisingly, Steve will have
even more competition for his
standing job next year. With a
healthy Dave Frost, and the
addition of seven-foot freshman
Rich Kelly, there will be too
much talent for two few
positions. "We have great hopes
for Kelly," Steve commented.
But because of his
characteristic hard work and
determination, there will
undobtedly be a starting job for
Steve next year. His offensive
consistency must improve, and he
realizes this. "I don't have the real
good shot," says Steve. "I know

I've got to get in the middle of
things. My attributes go with
rebounding."
But despite the
accomplishments, Steve still isn't
satisfied. "We wanted to give
Claude (Terry) a really good

season.. . . We've been trying to
think of a disguise to get him back
next year," he quipped.
This Saturday will be an
important day in Stanford
basketball. Claude Terry, holder
of virtually every Stanford scoring

record, will play his final game in
a Stanford uniform. The team will
thank him for his services with a
win over number one ranked
UCLA, if Steve Shupe has
anything to say about the
outcome. And he probably will.

Steve and the rest of the team
have expressed confidence in this
weekends series at Maples
Pavilion, against SC and UCLA.
"We've been anticipating USC
since that last time we played
them," says Steve. That last time
Stanford and USC met was in Los

Angeles, when the Trojans eked
out a two point victory on a
questionable last-second field goal
by star Paul Westphal. "We're
almost over-confident about SC,"
continued Steve.
Steve expressed guarded
optimism about the UCLA game
on Saturday night. "I really think
we can beat them. The key word
is patience." Stanford must "crash
the boards" and make a "good
shot selection" in order to beat
the defending national champions.
Surprisingly, Steve will have
even more competition for his
standing job next year. With a
healthy Dave Frost, and the
addition of seven-foot freshman
Rich Kelly, there will be too
much talent for two few
positions. "We have great hopes
for Kelly," Steve commented.
But because of his
characteristic hard work and
determination, there will
undobtedly be a starting job for
Steve next year. His offensive
consistency must improve, and he
realizes this. "I don't have the real
good shot," says Steve. "I know

I've got to get in the middle of
things. My attributes go with
rebounding."
But despite the
accomplishments, Steve still isn't
satisfied. "We wanted to give
Claude (Terry) a really good

season.. . . We've been trying to
think of a disguise to get him back
next year," he quipped.
This Saturday will be an
important day in Stanford
basketball. Claude Terry, holder
of virtually every Stanford scoring

record, will play his final game in
a Stanford uniform. The team will
thank him for his services with a
win over number one ranked
UCLA, if Steve Shupe has
anything to say about the
outcome. And he probably will.
Meet Steve Shupe — Stanford
Engineering student and impartial
judge for the 1972 Stanford dollie
tryouts. But every Friday and
Saturday night, just as the sun is
going down, Steve can be seen
ducking into a phone booth or
locker room, and donning his red
and white uniform,
mild-mannered Steve the Student
becomes mild-mannered Steve the
Basketball Player. Steve has
played excellent basketball all
year, but Stanford may need a
superman performance from him
for this weekend's battles with
USC and UCLA.
The 6'6", slender sophomore
from Honolulu, Hawaii, is
currently the number one
rebounder for the Stanford
varsity, and seventh in the
Pacific-Eight Conference. Seventh,
in a tough, physical league with
such stars as Ron Rily of USC,
Washington's Steve Hawes, Cal's
Ansley Truitt, and Bill Walton of
UCLA. They all have two
advantages over Steve. All are
several inches taller, and all have

an avid following from the press.
But headlines or no, none of them
have Steve's determination.
Steve was the second leading
rebounder and third leading scorer
on a 1971 frosh team that
compiled a 15-3 record. His
strengths are rebounding, and a
very physical style of defensive
play. Steve constantly
draws the difficult assignment of
fronting and containing the
opposition's big man, and time
and time again he has done an
outstanding job.
One of those big men is
UCLA's super-sophomore, Bill
Walton, "There's no question
that he's the best I've played
against," said Steve. "He has a
good touch, excellent guickness,
and sweet moves. He does
everything well."
