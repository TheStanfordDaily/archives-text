# Senate Abolishes Mascot
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
The ASSU Senate last night voted
18-4 to "officially repeal the
resolution of November 1930" in
which the ASSU Executive Committee
endorsed the use of the Indian as
Stanford's mascot. Last night's
resolution "thereby eliminates its use
as the association's official mascot."
After repealing the resolution, the
Senate passed, 17-2, legislation
supporting the Council of Presidents in
establishing a committee to implement
the decision on the mascot and to
decide upon a new one.
The committee will include one
representative each from the Athletic
Department, the Buck Club, the
Alumni Association, the Senate itself
and the Native Americans Student
Association. Four other students will

be appointed by the Council of
Presidents. Linda Wright was selected
by the Senate last night to serve as
their representative.
The resolutions were introduced by
ASSU Co-President Doug McHenry
after consultations with Assistant to
the President William Stone, President
Lyman's adviser on the mascot
question. Stone said the Senate's
action was "probably appropriate"
since "there are other people whose
accord would be needed" to eliminate
the Indian as the mascot.
Letters Cited
Stone also said Lyman had received
"about 150 letters" on the mascot
question in addition to the petition
signed by 107 members of the
Klamath River-Yurok Indian Tribe
which requested retention of the

mascot. He added the Administration
was "keeping in close touch with
Dartmouth" where he said the mascot
question was "amazingly similar."
Appearing at the Senate meeting to
answer questions were Native
American students Sarah Sneed and
Steve Begay, both freshmen, and
Gwendolyn Shunatona, Assistant Dean
of Students for Native Americans.
'No Justice' Possible
Sneed described using the mascot in
connection with Stanford's athletic
teams as "like taking something from
another world and incorporating it
into your fun." Speaking of Stanford's
use of the mascot, Sneed said "there's
no way that you can do it justice."
The resolution said, "As sole and
final constitutional authority other
than the membership of the
association [the ASSU], we find no
other acceptable alternative than to
respect the rights of our constituency
no matter how small a minority, in
regards to their objection on a
question of our making."
In expressing his support for
abolishing the mascot, President
Lyman told a Southern California
alumni conference in Los Angeles last
Sunday, "the facts are that the
American Indian on the reservation
has the highest alcoholism rate, the
highest death rate, the highest rate of
impact of many kinds of diseases, the
lowest income and the lowest
education level of any ethnic minority
in the country.
"These facts are simply not known
to the Americans who are happy to
think about the Indian as a kind of
heroic figure from the past."
