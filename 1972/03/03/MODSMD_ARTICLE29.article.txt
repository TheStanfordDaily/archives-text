# Gibbs, Moses To Handle Faculty-Student Problems
## 
### PATTY FELS 
A new method of handling
student-faculty grievances was
presented to the Faculty Senate
yesterday. Grievances which cannot be
resolved by the department chairmen
will now be referred to Lincoln Moses
and James Gibbs, the Deans of
Graduate and Undergraduate Studies.
In his provost's report, William
Miller called the issue of grievances
"largely a faculty responsibility." He
emphasized that the new procedure is
only supplementary and that students
will still generally follow the original
method of appealing first to the
department head and then to the
school dean.
The grievance will be referred to
the deans in the cases that (a) the
other routes have not proved
satisfactory, (b) the chairman or
school dean wishes to pass the matter
on and (c) the student wants to have a
private discussion before consulting
the department chairman.
Miller advised the deans to consult
other sources before making a decision
on the grievances referred to them.
The decisions and any resultant action
will be explained in a written report
made available to him, the department
chairmen and the parties involved. He
will take action against faculty
members while the deans will "initiate
proceedings in the appropriate offices"
against students.
He added that an alteration in the
rules governing student-faculty
relationships may become necessary
should a certain issue arise frequently.
The problem will then be referred to
an Academic Council committee. "I
am sure that any one of these
committees will be willing to

undertake the consideration in rules or
practices that are required to make
sure that we have an equitable
student-faculty relationship," Miller
said.
When questioned regarding the
grounds for grievances, Miller listed a
dispute over grading, a question on the
candidacy for a Ph.D. or an argument
concerning eligibility for a particular
program.
Miller said that he hopes this
procedure will "result in a satisfactory
resolution of all but the most unusual
cases." Problems which cannot be
solved can be appealed to the provost
and ultimately to the president.
In his report, President Richard
Lyman praised the Campus Judicial
Panel for its speed in handling last
week's proceedings. "We've had 11
different hearings on 5 different cases
in the last 14 days," he said. He feels
that the CJP is more capable than the
defunct Student Judicial Council
because the SJC was so
"controversial." However, he added,
"This doesn't mean the CJP is
perfect."
Answering questions on his report
on the undergraduate program, Gibbs
discussed methods of teacher
evaluation. "Chairmen in some
departments are very reluctant to use
the evaluation forms," he said.
Lyman said that the evaluation
system was in much better shape than
it was five years ago. However, his
assertion was refuted by Donald
Kennedy who labelled the
recommendation letters from students
"worthless" since they can so easily be
selected to produce favorable
impressions.

school dean.
The grievance will be referred to
the deans in the cases that (a) the
other routes have not proved
satisfactory, (b) the chairman or
school dean wishes to pass the matter
on and (c) the student wants to have a
private discussion before consulting
the department chairman.
Miller advised the deans to consult
other sources before making a decision
on the grievances referred to them.
The decisions and any resultant action
will be explained in a written report
made available to him, the department
chairmen and the parties involved. He
will take action against faculty
members while the deans will "initiate
proceedings in the appropriate offices"
against students.
He added that an alteration in the
rules governing student-faculty
relationships may become necessary
should a certain issue arise frequently.
The problem will then be referred to
an Academic Council committee. "I
am sure that any one of these
committees will be willing to

undertake the consideration in rules or
practices that are required to make
sure that we have an equitable
student-faculty relationship," Miller
said.
When questioned regarding the
grounds for grievances, Miller listed a
dispute over grading, a question on the
candidacy for a Ph.D. or an argument
concerning eligibility for a particular
program.
Miller said that he hopes this
procedure will "result in a satisfactory
resolution of all but the most unusual
cases." Problems which cannot be
solved can be appealed to the provost
and ultimately to the president.
In his report, President Richard
Lyman praised the Campus Judicial
Panel for its speed in handling last
week's proceedings. "We've had 11
different hearings on 5 different cases
in the last 14 days," he said. He feels
that the CJP is more capable than the
defunct Student Judicial Council
because the SJC was so
"controversial." However, he added,
"This doesn't mean the CJP is
perfect."
Answering questions on his report
on the undergraduate program, Gibbs
discussed methods of teacher
evaluation. "Chairmen in some
departments are very reluctant to use
the evaluation forms," he said.
Lyman said that the evaluation
system was in much better shape than
it was five years ago. However, his
assertion was refuted by Donald
Kennedy who labelled the
recommendation letters from students
"worthless" since they can so easily be
selected to produce favorable
impressions.
A new method of handling
student-faculty grievances was
presented to the Faculty Senate
yesterday. Grievances which cannot be
resolved by the department chairmen
will now be referred to Lincoln Moses
and James Gibbs, the Deans of
Graduate and Undergraduate Studies.
In his provost's report, William
Miller called the issue of grievances
"largely a faculty responsibility." He
emphasized that the new procedure is
only supplementary and that students
will still generally follow the original
method of appealing first to the
department head and then to the
school dean.
The grievance will be referred to
the deans in the cases that (a) the
other routes have not proved
satisfactory, (b) the chairman or
school dean wishes to pass the matter
on and (c) the student wants to have a
private discussion before consulting
the department chairman.
