# Tresidder Debt May Double In '72
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
The operating deficit of Tresidder
Memorial Union will surpass a quarter
of a million dollars in 1971-72, almost
twice what it was last year, according
to confidential figures released by
ASSU Senator Scott Burke.
The figures were included in a
report made to the ASSU Council of
Presidents by Burke, and were taken
from a University management study
of the operation not scheduled for
release until the end of March.
Gordon Starr of the University
Comptroller's office, who conducted
the audit, refused to confirm Burke's
estimation of the operating deficit, but
admitted that the Union is, technically
speaking bankrupt.
"Bankruptcy for a company is
where the reserves fall below $0 —
where if all assets were liquidated for
full value there would not be enough
cash to pay off all creditors," said
Starr. He confirmed Burke's statement
that the Union's reserve position had
fallen to a deficit of $159,000 as of
last December 31.
$276,000 Deficit
Burke stated in his report that the
operating deficit of Tresidder will
reach $276,000 by the end of this
fiscal year, up from $146,000 last
year. He drew his information from
preliminary reports submitted by Starr
at a recent meeting of the Committee
on Tresidder Union (CTU).
Although Starr refused to confirm
Burke's report on the operating
deficit, he did confirm other figures in
the ASSU report, including the fact
that the Union operation is currently
in debt to the University as a whole to
the tune of $400,000. Tresidder is
owned by the University, which Iws
been paying off debts it has incurred.
In his report, Burke affixes the
blame for the Union's poor financial
state directly on Union Director
Forrest Tregea and Business Manager
Philip Duffy. Burke says that

improvements at Tresidder must be
implemented by "extremely capable
administrators at the level of director
and business manager," and charges
that Tregea and Duffy "have been
unable to shoulder this burden."
Complete Reform
He called for "complete reform of
the Union" and "replacement of the
present management" by turning
operation of Tresidder over to the
students.
Burke said last night that he
submitted his report at the request of
ASSU Council of Presidents member
Ann Kimball. He charged that "the
Tresidder management wanted to keep
the figures secret," and stated that
"the reason there have been no
changes at TMU is that the University
has been able to push the situation
under the rug."
Tregea yesterday afternoon said, "I
don't think that's true," when cited
Burke's assertion concerning the
Union's operating deficit. He stated,
however, that he could not be sure
that the figures were incorrect unless
he had more information.
Burke authored a highly critical
Senate report on the operation of
Tresidder last year, which led to a
University Internal Audit Office
investigation of Tresidder this summer.
That report, written by Notre Dame
graduate student Carl Hitchner,
included many recommendations for
improving the operation, and stopped
just short of openly criticizing Tregea's
management.
Firings Rumored
Meanwhile, Acting Dean of
Students Robert Freelen denied
reports last night that Duffy would be
fired from his post sometime next
week.
"As far as I know, it's not true,"
said Freelen. "I wouldn't just reach
down into someone else's organization
and fire someone.

"I don't know who's been saying
these things, but they're lying to you,"
he continued. "There are a few people
who are just anxious to put pressure
on the Tresidder management. Given
the kind of problems we have now,
these rumors can only be detrimental to
the situation."
Freelen similarly denied rumors
that Tregea himself would be
dismissed within two months.
Food service director Lee Schaefer
was fired by Tregea from his job just
two weeks ago because of what Tregea
termed a conflict of management

philosophies. It is known that Tregea
was unhappy over Schaefer's failure to
put the cafeteria-food service on better
financial footing.
Tregea has been a center of
controversy since he directed the
University of California at Berkeley
student union several years ago. In
April of 1968, the ASUC Senate came
within one vote of mustering the
two-thirds approval necessary to fire
him.
Two weeks later, he announced his
resignation from UC to accept the
Stanford position.

financial footing.
Tregea has been a center of
controversy since he directed the
University of California at Berkeley
student union several years ago. In
April of 1968, the ASUC Senate came
within one vote of mustering the
two-thirds approval necessary to fire
him.
Two weeks later, he announced his
resignation from UC to accept the
Stanford position.
The operating deficit of Tresidder
Memorial Union will surpass a quarter
of a million dollars in 1971-72, almost
twice what it was last year, according
to confidential figures released by
ASSU Senator Scott Burke.
The figures were included in a
report made to the ASSU Council of
Presidents by Burke, and were taken
from a University management study
of the operation not scheduled for
release until the end of March.
Gordon Starr of the University
Comptroller's office, who conducted
the audit, refused to confirm Burke's
estimation of the operating deficit, but
admitted that the Union is, technically
speaking bankrupt.
"Bankruptcy for a company is
where the reserves fall below $0 —
where if all assets were liquidated for
full value there would not be enough
cash to pay off all creditors," said
Starr. He confirmed Burke's statement
that the Union's reserve position had
fallen to a deficit of $159,000 as of
last December 31.
$276,000 Deficit
Burke stated in his report that the
operating deficit of Tresidder will
reach $276,000 by the end of this
fiscal year, up from $146,000 last
year. He drew his information from
preliminary reports submitted by Starr
at a recent meeting of the Committee
on Tresidder Union (CTU).
Although Starr refused to confirm
Burke's report on the operating
deficit, he did confirm other figures in
the ASSU report, including the fact
that the Union operation is currently
in debt to the University as a whole to
the tune of $400,000. Tresidder is
owned by the University, which Iws
been paying off debts it has incurred.
In his report, Burke affixes the
blame for the Union's poor financial
state directly on Union Director
Forrest Tregea and Business Manager
Philip Duffy. Burke says that

improvements at Tresidder must be
implemented by "extremely capable
administrators at the level of director
and business manager," and charges
that Tregea and Duffy "have been
unable to shoulder this burden."
Complete Reform
He called for "complete reform of
the Union" and "replacement of the
present management" by turning
operation of Tresidder over to the
students.
Burke said last night that he
submitted his report at the request of
ASSU Council of Presidents member
Ann Kimball. He charged that "the
Tresidder management wanted to keep
the figures secret," and stated that
"the reason there have been no
changes at TMU is that the University
has been able to push the situation
under the rug."
Tregea yesterday afternoon said, "I
don't think that's true," when cited
Burke's assertion concerning the
Union's operating deficit. He stated,
however, that he could not be sure
that the figures were incorrect unless
he had more information.
Burke authored a highly critical
Senate report on the operation of
Tresidder last year, which led to a
University Internal Audit Office
investigation of Tresidder this summer.
That report, written by Notre Dame
graduate student Carl Hitchner,
included many recommendations for
improving the operation, and stopped
just short of openly criticizing Tregea's
management.
Firings Rumored
Meanwhile, Acting Dean of
Students Robert Freelen denied
reports last night that Duffy would be
fired from his post sometime next
week.
"As far as I know, it's not true,"
said Freelen. "I wouldn't just reach
down into someone else's organization
and fire someone.

"I don't know who's been saying
these things, but they're lying to you,"
he continued. "There are a few people
who are just anxious to put pressure
on the Tresidder management. Given
the kind of problems we have now,
these rumors can only be detrimental to
the situation."
Freelen similarly denied rumors
that Tregea himself would be
dismissed within two months.
Food service director Lee Schaefer
was fired by Tregea from his job just
two weeks ago because of what Tregea
termed a conflict of management

philosophies. It is known that Tregea
was unhappy over Schaefer's failure to
put the cafeteria-food service on better
financial footing.
