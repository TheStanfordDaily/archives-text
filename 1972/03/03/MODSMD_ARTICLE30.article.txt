# Davis Jury Selection

### 
SAN JOSE (AP) — A woman member
of the tentative jury in the
murder-kidnap-conspiracy trial of
black communist Angela Davis told
the court Thursday she felt blacks had
not been aggressive enough in fighting
for equality.
The comments of Ruth A. Ruth, a
blond mother of three, came in
response to questioning by chief
defense attorney Howard Moore, Jr.
about her attitudes towards blacks and
communists.
Ruth was the first tentative juror to
be questioned in the second round of
jury selection that still could result in
the dismissal of tentative jury
members if challenged by defense or
prosecution attorneys.
The four men and eight women,
including a black housewife, survived
the first round of jury selection in the
first four days of Davis' trial.
In the first round they were
questioned individually, and by

agreement questions covered only two
areas: the possible effects of pre-trial
publicity and possible personal
hardship during a long trial.
In the second phase, they're being
questioned as a group, in each others
presence, and there are no agreed upon
restrictions on the area to be covered
by questions.
The 28 year old former UCLA
philosophy instructor is accused of
buying and furnishing the guns used in
the August 7, 1970 shootout at the
Marin County Civic Center, in which a
judge and three other persons were
killed.
Ruth, who stated in the first round
of jury selection that she had never
heard of Davis before last week, told
Moore she didn't think she was
prejudiced against blacks but added
she didn't feel they had been
aggressive enough in fighting for
equality.
