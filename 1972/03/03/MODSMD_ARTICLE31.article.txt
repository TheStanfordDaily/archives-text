# Placement Center Hearings End
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
The Campus Judicial Panel hearings
began and concluded last night when
the four defendants announced at the
beginning of the session that they were
boycotting the hearings.
The defendants, Don Lee, Steve
Downey, Pete Knutson, and Paul
Loeb, have been found by hearing
officer Lillian Altree to have

disrupted an interview conducted by a
representative of TRW corporation
during the November 4 "mill-in" last
year. In addition, Lee was found to
have disrupted a General Motors
interview on the same date.
The hearings, scheduled last night
before the full panel, were to
determine whether a violation of the
Policy on Campus Disruptions had in
fact occurred. In place of verbal
testimony, the panel will make a ruling
on the basis of briefs submitted by the
prosecution and the defense.
The "Statement of Motivation"
submitted by the defense asserts "it is
our belief that we can no longer
continue to participate in proceedings
which we feel have no legitimacy as
our very participation legitimizes the
whole process."
However CJP Chairman John
Kaplan claimed that "the defendants
have in fact participated" by filing
long and short briefs along with a
motivational statement. Kaplan
queried, "What more would they have
done?"
As Kaplan read their "Statement"
inside the hearing room, the four
defendants were addressing a crowd of
about 30 people gathered outside.
Knutson claimed that it was
"obvious that the verdict has been
decided since the start of this trial.
They only held the trial to determine
the crime."
The defendants' final brief
contended it was not shown by the

University that the TRW and GM
recruiting interviews were legitimate
"university functions," and "there was
no evidence to counter" the argument
that the defendants were justified in
their alleged actions.
The defendants stated that "any
coercion inflicted by our continued
presence at the interview is more than
overshadowed by the far greater
coercion of daily bombings of human
beings in Indochina."
The defense brief also argued that,
in order to ignore the claim that the
defendants were justified, the
University would have to "assert that
its right to keep totally unruffled
decorum on campus somehow places it
above international law."
Kaplan, seeing it somewhat
differently, said, "It's a question of
vigilante justice: whether you have the
right to take things into your own
hands .. . Sometimes you do, and
sometimes you don't."
Kaplan did say however, "I don't
think there is going to be an expulsion
in this case."
In the absence of the defendants,
Kaplan made a technical ruling
allowing their claim of justification to
stand despite the fact that, according
to Kaplan, the defendants "must show
they acted according to that
justification by appearing to testify."
The panel will decide when to make
its final ruling after it receives a
written brief from the prosecution
today.
