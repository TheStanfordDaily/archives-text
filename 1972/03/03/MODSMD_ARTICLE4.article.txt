# Defense Motion Against Kaplan Rejected
## 
### 
In a statement released yesterday,
Campus Judicial Panel chairman John
Kaplan denied defense motions to
disqualify him for bias in the case of
the so-called "Placement Center 4."
However, Kaplan apparently will
disqualify Panel member Terrance
Pape because of his person**!
acquaintance with two of the
defendants, Steve Downey and Paul
Loeb.
The seven-man defense team
submitted motions to disqualify
Kaplan, Pape, philosophy professor
David Nivison, and Materials Science
professor Robert White earlier this
week, accompanied by ten affidavits
and three newspaper clippings.
Defense counsel argued that Kaplan
should disqualify himself because of
"his strong views on the necessity of
maintaining complete order on the
campus ... his strong and unrealistic
views of the possibilities of working
through change through persuading
the administration . . . his view of the
Movement of which defendants are a
part as being composed of dangerous
'thugs' who will destroy the
campus ... his own predisposition to
mete out harsh punishments in this

case ... his exposure to strong
peer-group pressure to mete out harsh
punishments in this case."
An affidavit supporting the motion
to disqualify Kaplan by defendant
Don Lee alleges that the CJP
chairman, in a telephone conversation
"during the week preceding the
Placement Center hearings" told Lee
"that two of the faculty members on
the CJP wanted immediate expulsions
for disrupters" and that "at least forty
faculty members had called
him . . . demanding stern punishment
for disruptors."
Kaplan said that, while he feels
badly about judging defendants before
the CJP, he would "feel even worse
about turning the campus over to
thugs," two other affidavits allege.
In his response, Kaplan separated
the bias alleged by the defendants into
three categories — bias through
personal contact or acquaintance, bias
in matters r f law, and bias in
sentencing behavior — and maintained
that "no one has alleged I bear the
defendants any personal ill will," and
that in the other two categories
defense allegations "are hardly more
than conclusions," and that the

defense characterization of Kaplan's
views was "grossly distorted."
Kaplan denied that any CJP
members had told him they wished to
expel the placement disrupters, and
said he may have made other
statements "during a period of
emotional excitement," but does "not
feel that way now."
Kaplan said that he would deny
defense motions to disqualify Nivison
and White unless the two failed to
issue a "flat denial of personal ill will."
Counsel argued that Nivison should
disqualify himself because he is Loeb's
advisor, and that Nivison and White
should disqualify themselves because
they signed a statement, printed in the
Daily, supporting open recruiting at
the Placement Center.
The defense team also submitted a
list of 16 interrogatories to Kaplan,
which were to be put individually to
each CJP member to determine
"prejudice, if any."
The interrogatories probed CJP
members' contacts with administrators
concerning the case. any
prejudgements they may have made,
and other overt forms of bias.
The questions also inquired into

members' attitudes toward the
Vietnam war, student demonstrators,
Venoeremos, Placement Center policy,
and similar issues.
Kaplan promised to forward
members' answers to counsel for the
defense, and to set the interrogatories
for argument after yesterday's brief
hearing, but before the CJP meets to
delibc-ate on the case.

"that two of the faculty members on
the CJP wanted immediate expulsions
for disrupters" and that "at least forty
faculty members had called
him . . . demanding stern punishment
for disruptors."
Kaplan said that, while he feels
badly about judging defendants before
the CJP, he would "feel even worse
about turning the campus over to
thugs," two other affidavits allege.
In his response, Kaplan separated
the bias alleged by the defendants into
three categories — bias through
personal contact or acquaintance, bias
in matters r f law, and bias in
sentencing behavior — and maintained
that "no one has alleged I bear the
defendants any personal ill will," and
that in the other two categories
defense allegations "are hardly more
than conclusions," and that the

defense characterization of Kaplan's
views was "grossly distorted."
Kaplan denied that any CJP
members had told him they wished to
expel the placement disrupters, and
said he may have made other
statements "during a period of
emotional excitement," but does "not
feel that way now."
Kaplan said that he would deny
defense motions to disqualify Nivison
and White unless the two failed to
issue a "flat denial of personal ill will."
Counsel argued that Nivison should
disqualify himself because he is Loeb's
advisor, and that Nivison and White
should disqualify themselves because
they signed a statement, printed in the
Daily, supporting open recruiting at
the Placement Center.
The defense team also submitted a
list of 16 interrogatories to Kaplan,
which were to be put individually to
each CJP member to determine
"prejudice, if any."
The interrogatories probed CJP
members' contacts with administrators
concerning the case. any
prejudgements they may have made,
and other overt forms of bias.
The questions also inquired into

members' attitudes toward the
Vietnam war, student demonstrators,
Venoeremos, Placement Center policy,
and similar issues.
Kaplan promised to forward
members' answers to counsel for the
defense, and to set the interrogatories
for argument after yesterday's brief
hearing, but before the CJP meets to
delibc-ate on the case.
In a statement released yesterday,
Campus Judicial Panel chairman John
Kaplan denied defense motions to
disqualify him for bias in the case of
the so-called "Placement Center 4."
However, Kaplan apparently will
disqualify Panel member Terrance
Pape because of his person**!
acquaintance with two of the
defendants, Steve Downey and Paul
Loeb.
The seven-man defense team
submitted motions to disqualify
Kaplan, Pape, philosophy professor
David Nivison, and Materials Science
professor Robert White earlier this
week, accompanied by ten affidavits
and three newspaper clippings.
Defense counsel argued that Kaplan
should disqualify himself because of
"his strong views on the necessity of
maintaining complete order on the
campus ... his strong and unrealistic
views of the possibilities of working
through change through persuading
the administration . . . his view of the
Movement of which defendants are a
part as being composed of dangerous
'thugs' who will destroy the
campus ... his own predisposition to
mete out harsh punishments in this

case ... his exposure to strong
peer-group pressure to mete out harsh
punishments in this case."
An affidavit supporting the motion
to disqualify Kaplan by defendant
Don Lee alleges that the CJP
chairman, in a telephone conversation
"during the week preceding the
Placement Center hearings" told Lee
"that two of the faculty members on
the CJP wanted immediate expulsions
for disrupters" and that "at least forty
faculty members had called
him . . . demanding stern punishment
for disruptors."
