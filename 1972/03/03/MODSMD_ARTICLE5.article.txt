## NLRB Election 
### 
When 1600 Stanford employees vote next
Tuesday to determine whether there should be
collective bargaining here, it will be a first for
Stanford University, the Palo Alto locality's largest
employer.
It is time such a major group of workers had an
autonomous organization, independent of the
University, to represent their interests. Of the four
options on the upcoming ballot, "no union" seems
the least sensible. This does not imply that labor
relations at Stanford resemble a David and Goliath
situation â€” a large group of employees, performing
menial jobs under extremely oppressive conditions,
who badly need a powerful union to lead the fight
against its bosses.
Individual workers here are split into small
enough groups so their complaints are not buried
before reaching their superiors even if they are
eventually ignored. The fact remains that to deal
with overall pay raises throughout the working staff,
as well as pension plans, medical coverage, grievance
procedures, and overall working conditions,
employees here cannot count on the good will of
the University to receive them.
While working for these improvements is
obviously the main role of a union, supporters of
the "no union" option contend that Stanford
supplies these benefits to their satisfaction already.
But when the University faces economic pressure to
lay off its employees without a union, there is no
alternate power which is legally sanctioned to
protect them.
However one weighs the reasons in voting for a
union next Tuesday, it is clear the capabilities of
each are very different. It would be illusory to base
a vote on the glowing promise each one makes.
A good union should not simply stand on its
ability to bring wider benefits to its members, but
should be sensitive to the diversified group of
workers it represents. The Teamsters, the United
Stanford Employees (USE), and the California
School Employees Association (CSEA - SEA), all
have their weak and strong points.
CSEA-SEA and USE arc the two unions with the
greatest experience at Stanford. If bargaining with
the University reaches a stalemate, USE says it can
find alternate tactics for applying pressure, beyond
a strike which might not get outside sanction.
It points to a partially successful boycott of
Tresidder and establishment of an alternate food

service last spring to retaliate for the layoff of 12
workers there as an example.
USE admits that it is highly political in nature,
and this could possibly weaken their bargaining
power. It is aiming for benefits beyond the
traditional "bread and butter" ones: educational
benefits which the University could offer, as well as
a University-run child care center.
CSEA-SEA, which unlike USE is part of a
statewide organization, is a less militant group. .It
has never called a strike in their history, although
it says it would under extreme circumstances.
Although this position lacks bravado, if one feels
that a university is different from a traditional
employer, CSEA-SEA certainly has the best feeling
for this problem. Unlike General Motors or U.S.
Steel, Stanford has no prices it can easily raise to
compensate for higher wages. Although their
opponents claim it is a "company" union, in the
long run CSEA-SEA may be able to get more from
Stanford University for the employees.
The Teamsters stand out for their brute strength
to put the University in a stranglehold. They have
advertised an extensive list of benefits in the Daily.
With their experience in negotiating, besides the
national organization which backs them up, the
Union may get them. If the University can survive
the shock, the Teamsters may be the best
organization to get the largest pay increases for
Stanford employees.
Taking a narrow view of Stanford labor affairs, a
tough union can do nothing better than be tough,
and it is very questionable whether the Teamsters
will be very sensitive to Stanford's particular
problems.
The dissimilarity among the three unions is so
great that it is crucial for such an important change
of power at the University not to be made casually.
As we said in an editorial last Tuesday, the
employees who will vote four days from now have
had very little exposure to the three unions'
positions.
We think the University ought to have given
these 1600 people time off to near the unions'
views. If at all possible in the few days remaining
before the election, we feel time should be given
during regular working hours for representatives
from each of the four options on the ballot to
present their views: no union, the Teamsters, USE,
and the CSEA-SEA.
