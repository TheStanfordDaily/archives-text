Editor, THE DAILY:
On February 28, Today in the
Daily' asked rhetorically, "Who
was it that said, The fault, dear
Brutus, is not in our stars but in
ourselves'?"
William Shakespeare said it
first, of course. But more
importantly, Edward R. Murrow
said it in 1954. He was talking
about political extremists and
why they flourish, and his
comments are particularly
apropos to Bruce Franklin, the
subject of Today in the Daily.'
'The actions of the junior
senator from Wisconsin," Murrow
told his listeners, "have caused

alarm and dismay amongst our
allies abroad and given
considerable comfort to our
enemies, and whose fault is that?
Not really his. He didn't create
this situation of fear; he merely
exploited it, and rather
successfully. Cassius was right:
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in
our stars but in ourselves."
He referred, of course, to
Senator Joseph McCarthy, a man
with whom Bruce Franklin shares
more than an obsession with
Communism. Murrow's words
explain the rise not only of
McCarthy but of Franklin. Bruce
Franklin flourishes because the
rest of as haven't done enough to
make the democratic ideal reality.

Bruce Franklin and his fellow
hatemongers of the left and the
right should spur the rest of us to
bring reality closer to ideal before
they have a chance to move
reality further away from the
ideal.
It's rare and refreshing to see
such a philosophical note in
'Today in the Daily.' Keep up the
good work!
