## Tresidder Staff Needs Total Reform 
###

(The following is a report to the
ASSU Council of Presidents on
Tresidder Union.)
In response to a request from
Ann Kimball, I agreed to prepare
for the ASSU Council of
Presidents a report on the present
conditions at Tresidder Memorial
Union. Since our efforts to make
the Union responsive to the needs
of the Stanford community began
nine months ago, many reports
have been written, many articles
in the press published, and many
words spoken on the subject by
those in any way connected with
it. While we were successful in
bringing some beneficial changes
to Tresidder, the overall situation
there remains much the same in
many ways as before we began
our campaign for reform.
The reason for this lack of
fundamental renewal was first
pinpointed publicly in the ASSU
Senate Investigation Committee's
"Report on Tresidder Union" of
August, 1971 — the management
of Tresidder is incapable of
providing leadership or of bringing
any but the most superficial
changes to the Union. The
management is the problem, and
just as a cancer cannot cure itself,
so too the cure for Tresidder's
illness is not to allow the root
cause of the problem to continue
to fester, but to address it
squarely and honestly, and
eliminate it. An examination of
events surrounding Tresidder in
the past and the revealing of
present conditions will further
support this contention.
The fact that problems existed
in Tresidder's management first
became widely noted in the
community when in February
1971, 12 workers were laid off
with the stated goal of reducing
costs in order to "allow the Union
to break even for the remainder of
the year" according to Mason
Yearian, former chairman of the
Tresidder Committee. This tactic
backfired completely, and
brought about an organized
boycott of the Union by those
sympathizing with the plight of
the fired workers. Sales of the
Union plummetted by as much as
nearly 40 per cent during the
months of the boycott. Deficits in
the operation continued to mount
to ever higher levels.
Investigation
At this point, in response to
many complaints regarding the
Union, the ASSU began an
investigation of Tresidder. Public
hearings were held, at which any
members of the community with
ideas concerning the Union were
invited to testify. For nearly two
months after the close of these
hearings, I conducted an
investigation of Tresidder,
culmintating in the ASSU report
already referred to. The theme of
the report was that the Union was
suffering from the disease of inept
management, and that in order for
it to run efficiently, a new

organization and new
management would be required.
The response to these challenges
was immediae but superficial.
Union director Forrest Tregea was
forced to request a full-fledged
investigation by the University's
Internal Audit Office, and a new
food service director was
obtained.
As the university conducted its
own investigation, the newly
appointed student minority on
the Tresidder Union Committee —
Chuck Peterson, Borut Bekleva,
James Baer and I — attempted to
force changes in the operations at
Tresidder. Because we were a
minority, we were unable to
conduct more than a harassment
and holding operation, but
occasionally prodded Union
management to take action on
such matters as the campus bank
and the food service.
The release of the university's
own report on Tresidder greatly
stunned those connected with the
Union, for it merely echoed the
biting criticisms made in the
ASSU report. The demands for
the disbanding of the Tresidder
Committee and placing
management under the direct
command of a high level
university official, and for other
changes in the manner of
operations were reiterated. While
it did not call directly for the
firing of director Tregea and
business manager Phillip Duffy, it
did state that "the problem of the
Union being stagnant in its
operation will have to be solved
within the Union by establishing
more forward looking
management objectives and by
effectively implementing these
goals and objectives,.' and that
this will "necessitate a reversal of
philosophy for some individuals.
Those who cannot or will not
adapt to these conditions should
be removed from the
organization." In essence, the
university was called upon to give
Tregea and Duffy one more
chance to prove themselves
capable of managing the Union.
Failure
The real difference between
the University's report and that of
the ASSU was that we contended
that management's unbroken
record of failure and ineptitude
indicated without reasonable
doubt that they would not be
capable of performing the
necessary reforms; the
University's report indicated a

belief that with the disbanding of
the Tresidder Committee and the
designation of a full-time
administrative officer outside the
Union to whom the director
would be responsible, it might be
possible for Tregea and Duffy to
rescue TMU. An examination of
Tresidder's present position
indicates that our contention was
correct — present management has
been completely unsuccessful in
improving the financial position
of the Union, and in all areas but
the food service, operations have
not improved in any appreciable
manner.
Insofar as any actions upon
recommendations in the
University's report are concerned,
only a few of the changes have
been implemented. Most of these
occurred at the food service and
must be credited to Lee Schafer,
former directer of that operation.
Charles H. Peterson, the
extremely knowledgeable and
insightful chairman of the
Tresidder Committee, states:
"Those changes which have been
brought at Tresidder are very
superficial, such as minor
mechanical aspects of the
operation. The fundamental
change required at the Union —
the improvement of the
relationships of the people
involved, and the lack of coherent
management direction — has not
occurred." He adds that "most of
the improvements which have
occurred at Tresidder were due to
Lee Schafer. The other operations
are about as ill-managed and
inefficient as ever." The
I recommendations for change at
the retail store and the games
area, remain largely unacted upon.
The present management
arrangement cannot achieve the
reform of Tresidder. Merely to
make Tregea responsible to the
Dean of Students is insufficient,
for as Freelen freely admits, his
other duties preclude his taking
charge of the implementation of
necessary changes at the Union.
This means that the responsibility
for implementation devolves upon
the shoulders of the upper
management of Tresidder —
Tregea and Duffy. Such reform
demands the full-time attention of
extremely capable administrators
at the level of director and
business manager of TMU. Tregea
and Duffy have been unable to
shoulder this burden, as evidenced
by the sky-rocketing deficit of the
Union, and the extreme employee

dissatisfaction which forced the
firing of Schafer.
Deteriorating
The financial position of
Tresidder has continued to
deteriorate since the publication
of the University's report. The
most recent audit of TMU by the
university reports that the
operating deficit of the Union will
nearly double this year, increasing
from $146,000 to $276,000. For
the most recent time period, at
the food service sales rose
from $213,000 to $229,000,
while cost of sales increased from
$89,000 to $104,000, labor from
$110,000 to $142,000, and other
expenses from $15,000 to
$26,000. Revenue from other
operations has either declined, as
in the case of the games area, or
remained approximately the same
as last year, as in the case of the
store. The reserve position of the
Union has deteriorated
tremendously in the past six
months, moving from a deficit of
$34,000 in August 1971, to a
deficit of $159,000 in December
1971.
This five fold increase in the
deficit of reserves has been
financed through the stop-gap
measure of university payables,
sums owed by Tresidder to the
university, but not paid. In
addition, investments of the
Union have been sold off. At
present, the Union owes
the university a staggering
$400,000 for goods and services
rendered to it. TMU is five
months behind in its bill
payments, i.e. in March it will
begin to pay last October's bills.
The increase in University
payables amounts to $33,000 per
month, and as each month goes
by, Tresidder falls an additional .4
months behind in its bills. In
essence, the Union is on the brink
of bankruptcy.
To conclude this report, I will
suggest that in order to deal with
this crisis situation, the ASSU
press for the complete reform of
the Union by calling for the
replacement of present
management and the conversion
of TMU into a facility governed
above all by a will to serve the
swiftly changing needs of the
Stanford community. This can
best be accomplished by the
creation of a student union,
managed and controlled by
students, run for the benefit of
the entire community.

own report on Tresidder greatly
stunned those connected with the
Union, for it merely echoed the
biting criticisms made in the
ASSU report. The demands for
the disbanding of the Tresidder
Committee and placing
management under the direct
command of a high level
university official, and for other
changes in the manner of
operations were reiterated. While
it did not call directly for the
firing of director Tregea and
business manager Phillip Duffy, it
did state that "the problem of the
Union being stagnant in its
operation will have to be solved
within the Union by establishing
more forward looking
management objectives and by
effectively implementing these
goals and objectives,.' and that
this will "necessitate a reversal of
philosophy for some individuals.
Those who cannot or will not
adapt to these conditions should
be removed from the
organization." In essence, the
university was called upon to give
Tregea and Duffy one more
chance to prove themselves
capable of managing the Union.
Failure
The real difference between
the University's report and that of
the ASSU was that we contended
that management's unbroken
record of failure and ineptitude
indicated without reasonable
doubt that they would not be
capable of performing the
necessary reforms; the
University's report indicated a

belief that with the disbanding of
the Tresidder Committee and the
designation of a full-time
administrative officer outside the
Union to whom the director
would be responsible, it might be
possible for Tregea and Duffy to
rescue TMU. An examination of
Tresidder's present position
indicates that our contention was
correct — present management has
been completely unsuccessful in
improving the financial position
of the Union, and in all areas but
the food service, operations have
not improved in any appreciable
manner.
Insofar as any actions upon
recommendations in the
University's report are concerned,
only a few of the changes have
been implemented. Most of these
occurred at the food service and
must be credited to Lee Schafer,
former directer of that operation.
Charles H. Peterson, the
extremely knowledgeable and
insightful chairman of the
Tresidder Committee, states:
"Those changes which have been
brought at Tresidder are very
superficial, such as minor
mechanical aspects of the
operation. The fundamental
change required at the Union —
the improvement of the
relationships of the people
involved, and the lack of coherent
management direction — has not
occurred." He adds that "most of
the improvements which have
occurred at Tresidder were due to
Lee Schafer. The other operations
are about as ill-managed and
inefficient as ever." The
I recommendations for change at
the retail store and the games
area, remain largely unacted upon.
The present management
arrangement cannot achieve the
reform of Tresidder. Merely to
make Tregea responsible to the
Dean of Students is insufficient,
for as Freelen freely admits, his
other duties preclude his taking
charge of the implementation of
necessary changes at the Union.
This means that the responsibility
for implementation devolves upon
the shoulders of the upper
management of Tresidder —
Tregea and Duffy. Such reform
demands the full-time attention of
extremely capable administrators
at the level of director and
business manager of TMU. Tregea
and Duffy have been unable to
shoulder this burden, as evidenced
by the sky-rocketing deficit of the
Union, and the extreme employee

dissatisfaction which forced the
firing of Schafer.
Deteriorating
The financial position of
Tresidder has continued to
deteriorate since the publication
of the University's report. The
most recent audit of TMU by the
university reports that the
operating deficit of the Union will
nearly double this year, increasing
from $146,000 to $276,000. For
the most recent time period, at
the food service sales rose
from $213,000 to $229,000,
while cost of sales increased from
$89,000 to $104,000, labor from
$110,000 to $142,000, and other
expenses from $15,000 to
$26,000. Revenue from other
operations has either declined, as
in the case of the games area, or
remained approximately the same
as last year, as in the case of the
store. The reserve position of the
Union has deteriorated
tremendously in the past six
months, moving from a deficit of
$34,000 in August 1971, to a
deficit of $159,000 in December
1971.
This five fold increase in the
deficit of reserves has been
financed through the stop-gap
measure of university payables,
sums owed by Tresidder to the
university, but not paid. In
addition, investments of the
Union have been sold off. At
present, the Union owes
the university a staggering
$400,000 for goods and services
rendered to it. TMU is five
months behind in its bill
payments, i.e. in March it will
begin to pay last October's bills.
The increase in University
payables amounts to $33,000 per
month, and as each month goes
by, Tresidder falls an additional .4
months behind in its bills. In
essence, the Union is on the brink
of bankruptcy.
To conclude this report, I will
suggest that in order to deal with
this crisis situation, the ASSU
press for the complete reform of
the Union by calling for the
replacement of present
management and the conversion
of TMU into a facility governed
above all by a will to serve the
swiftly changing needs of the
Stanford community. This can
best be accomplished by the
creation of a student union,
managed and controlled by
students, run for the benefit of
the entire community.

(The following is a report to the
ASSU Council of Presidents on
Tresidder Union.)
In response to a request from
Ann Kimball, I agreed to prepare
for the ASSU Council of
Presidents a report on the present
conditions at Tresidder Memorial
Union. Since our efforts to make
the Union responsive to the needs
of the Stanford community began
nine months ago, many reports
have been written, many articles
in the press published, and many
words spoken on the subject by
those in any way connected with
it. While we were successful in
bringing some beneficial changes
to Tresidder, the overall situation
there remains much the same in
many ways as before we began
our campaign for reform.
The reason for this lack of
fundamental renewal was first
pinpointed publicly in the ASSU
Senate Investigation Committee's
"Report on Tresidder Union" of
August, 1971 — the management
of Tresidder is incapable of
providing leadership or of bringing
any but the most superficial
changes to the Union. The
management is the problem, and
just as a cancer cannot cure itself,
so too the cure for Tresidder's
illness is not to allow the root
cause of the problem to continue
to fester, but to address it
squarely and honestly, and
eliminate it. An examination of
events surrounding Tresidder in
the past and the revealing of
present conditions will further
support this contention.
The fact that problems existed
in Tresidder's management first
became widely noted in the
community when in February
1971, 12 workers were laid off
with the stated goal of reducing
costs in order to "allow the Union
to break even for the remainder of
the year" according to Mason
Yearian, former chairman of the
Tresidder Committee. This tactic
backfired completely, and
brought about an organized
boycott of the Union by those
sympathizing with the plight of
the fired workers. Sales of the
Union plummetted by as much as
nearly 40 per cent during the
months of the boycott. Deficits in
the operation continued to mount
to ever higher levels.
Investigation
At this point, in response to
many complaints regarding the
Union, the ASSU began an
investigation of Tresidder. Public
hearings were held, at which any
members of the community with
ideas concerning the Union were
invited to testify. For nearly two
months after the close of these
hearings, I conducted an
investigation of Tresidder,
culmintating in the ASSU report
already referred to. The theme of
the report was that the Union was
suffering from the disease of inept
management, and that in order for
it to run efficiently, a new

organization and new
management would be required.
The response to these challenges
was immediae but superficial.
Union director Forrest Tregea was
forced to request a full-fledged
investigation by the University's
Internal Audit Office, and a new
food service director was
obtained.
As the university conducted its
own investigation, the newly
appointed student minority on
the Tresidder Union Committee —
Chuck Peterson, Borut Bekleva,
James Baer and I — attempted to
force changes in the operations at
Tresidder. Because we were a
minority, we were unable to
conduct more than a harassment
and holding operation, but
occasionally prodded Union
management to take action on
such matters as the campus bank
and the food service.
The release of the university's
own report on Tresidder greatly
stunned those connected with the
Union, for it merely echoed the
biting criticisms made in the
ASSU report. The demands for
the disbanding of the Tresidder

The financial position of
Tresidder has continued to
deteriorate since the publication
of the University's report. The
most recent audit of TMU by the
university reports that the
operating deficit of the Union will
nearly double this year, increasing
from $146,000 to $276,000. For
the most recent time period, at
the food service sales rose
from $213,000 to $229,000,
while cost of sales increased from
$89,000 to $104,000, labor from
$110,000 to $142,000, and other
expenses from $15,000 to
$26,000. Revenue from other
operations has either declined, as
in the case of the games area, or
remained approximately the same
as last year, as in the case of the
store. The reserve position of the
Union has deteriorated
tremendously in the past six
months, moving from a deficit of
$34,000 in August 1971, to a
deficit of $159,000 in December
1971.
This five fold increase in the
deficit of reserves has been
financed through the stop-gap
measure of university payables,
sums owed by Tresidder to the
university, but not paid. In
addition, investments of the
Union have been sold off. At
present, the Union owes
the university a staggering
$400,000 for goods and services
rendered to it. TMU is five
months behind in its bill
payments, i.e. in March it will
begin to pay last October's bills.
The increase in University
payables amounts to $33,000 per
month, and as each month goes
by, Tresidder falls an additional .4
months behind in its bills. In
essence, the Union is on the brink
of bankruptcy.
To conclude this report, I will
suggest that in order to deal with
this crisis situation, the ASSU
press for the complete reform of
the Union by calling for the
replacement of present
management and the conversion
of TMU into a facility governed
above all by a will to serve the
swiftly changing needs of the
Stanford community. This can
best be accomplished by the
creation of a student union,
managed and controlled by
students, run for the benefit of
the entire community.

(The following is a report to the
ASSU Council of Presidents on
Tresidder Union.)
In response to a request from
Ann Kimball, I agreed to prepare
for the ASSU Council of
Presidents a report on the present
conditions at Tresidder Memorial
Union. Since our efforts to make
the Union responsive to the needs
of the Stanford community began
nine months ago, many reports
have been written, many articles
in the press published, and many
words spoken on the subject by
those in any way connected with
it. While we were successful in
bringing some beneficial changes
to Tresidder, the overall situation
there remains much the same in
many ways as before we began
our campaign for reform.
The reason for this lack of
fundamental renewal was first
pinpointed publicly in the ASSU
Senate Investigation Committee's
"Report on Tresidder Union" of
August, 1971 — the management
of Tresidder is incapable of
providing leadership or of bringing
any but the most superficial
changes to the Union. The
management is the problem, and
just as a cancer cannot cure itself,
so too the cure for Tresidder's
illness is not to allow the root
cause of the problem to continue
to fester, but to address it
squarely and honestly, and
eliminate it. An examination of
events surrounding Tresidder in
the past and the revealing of
present conditions will further
support this contention.
The fact that problems existed
in Tresidder's management first
became widely noted in the
community when in February
1971, 12 workers were laid off
with the stated goal of reducing
costs in order to "allow the Union
to break even for the remainder of
the year" according to Mason
Yearian, former chairman of the
Tresidder Committee. This tactic
backfired completely, and
brought about an organized
boycott of the Union by those
sympathizing with the plight of
the fired workers. Sales of the
Union plummetted by as much as
nearly 40 per cent during the
months of the boycott. Deficits in
the operation continued to mount
to ever higher levels.
Investigation
At this point, in response to
many complaints regarding the
Union, the ASSU began an
investigation of Tresidder. Public
hearings were held, at which any
members of the community with
ideas concerning the Union were
invited to testify. For nearly two
months after the close of these
hearings, I conducted an
investigation of Tresidder,
culmintating in the ASSU report
already referred to. The theme of
the report was that the Union was
suffering from the disease of inept
management, and that in order for
it to run efficiently, a new

organization and new
management would be required.
The response to these challenges
was immediae but superficial.
Union director Forrest Tregea was
forced to request a full-fledged
investigation by the University's
Internal Audit Office, and a new
food service director was
obtained.
As the university conducted its
own investigation, the newly
appointed student minority on
the Tresidder Union Committee —
Chuck Peterson, Borut Bekleva,
James Baer and I — attempted to
force changes in the operations at
Tresidder. Because we were a
minority, we were unable to
conduct more than a harassment
and holding operation, but
occasionally prodded Union
management to take action on
such matters as the campus bank
and the food service.
The release of the university's
own report on Tresidder greatly
stunned those connected with the
Union, for it merely echoed the
biting criticisms made in the
ASSU report. The demands for
the disbanding of the Tresidder
Committee and placing
management under the direct
command of a high level
university official, and for other
changes in the manner of
operations were reiterated. While
it did not call directly for the
firing of director Tregea and
business manager Phillip Duffy, it
did state that "the problem of the
Union being stagnant in its
operation will have to be solved
within the Union by establishing
more forward looking
management objectives and by
effectively implementing these
goals and objectives,.' and that
this will "necessitate a reversal of
philosophy for some individuals.
Those who cannot or will not
adapt to these conditions should
be removed from the
organization." In essence, the
university was called upon to give
Tregea and Duffy one more
chance to prove themselves
capable of managing the Union.
Failure
The real difference between
the University's report and that of
the ASSU was that we contended
that management's unbroken
record of failure and ineptitude
indicated without reasonable
doubt that they would not be
capable of performing the
necessary reforms; the
University's report indicated a

belief that with the disbanding of
the Tresidder Committee and the
designation of a full-time
administrative officer outside the
Union to whom the director
would be responsible, it might be
possible for Tregea and Duffy to
rescue TMU. An examination of
Tresidder's present position
indicates that our contention was
correct — present management has
been completely unsuccessful in
improving the financial position
of the Union, and in all areas but
the food service, operations have
not improved in any appreciable
manner.
Insofar as any actions upon
recommendations in the
University's report are concerned,
only a few of the changes have
been implemented. Most of these
occurred at the food service and
must be credited to Lee Schafer,
former directer of that operation.
Charles H. Peterson, the
extremely knowledgeable and
insightful chairman of the
Tresidder Committee, states:
"Those changes which have been
brought at Tresidder are very
superficial, such as minor
mechanical aspects of the
operation. The fundamental
change required at the Union —
the improvement of the
relationships of the people
involved, and the lack of coherent
management direction — has not
occurred." He adds that "most of
the improvements which have
occurred at Tresidder were due to
Lee Schafer. The other operations
are about as ill-managed and
inefficient as ever." The
I recommendations for change at
the retail store and the games
area, remain largely unacted upon.
The present management
arrangement cannot achieve the
reform of Tresidder. Merely to
make Tregea responsible to the
Dean of Students is insufficient,
for as Freelen freely admits, his
other duties preclude his taking
charge of the implementation of
necessary changes at the Union.
This means that the responsibility
for implementation devolves upon
the shoulders of the upper
management of Tresidder —
Tregea and Duffy. Such reform
demands the full-time attention of
extremely capable administrators
at the level of director and
business manager of TMU. Tregea
and Duffy have been unable to
shoulder this burden, as evidenced
by the sky-rocketing deficit of the
Union, and the extreme employee

dissatisfaction which forced the
firing of Schafer.
Deteriorating
The financial position of
Tresidder has continued to
deteriorate since the publication
of the University's report. The
most recent audit of TMU by the
university reports that the
operating deficit of the Union will

from $146,000 to $276,000. For

while cost of sales increased from
$89,000 to $104,000, labor from
$110,000 to $142,000, and other
expenses from $15,000 to
$26,000. Revenue from other
operations has either declined, as
in the case of the games area, or
remained approximately the same
as last year, as in the case of the

Union has deteriorated
tremendously in the past six

$34,000 in August 1971, to a
deficit of $159,000 in December
1971.
This five fold increase in the
deficit of reserves has been
financed through the stop-gap

changes to the Union. The
management is the problem, and
just as a cancer cannot cure itself,
so too the cure for Tresidder's
illness is not to allow the root
cause of the problem to continue
to fester, but to address it
squarely and honestly, and
eliminate it. An examination of
events surrounding Tresidder in
the past and the revealing of
present conditions will further
support this contention.
The fact that problems existed
in Tresidder's management first
became widely noted in the
community when in February
1971, 12 workers were laid off
with the stated goal of reducing
costs in order to "allow the Union
to break even for the remainder of
the year" according to Mason
Yearian, former chairman of the
Tresidder Committee. This tactic
backfired completely, and
brought about an organized
boycott of the Union by those
sympathizing with the plight of
the fired workers. Sales of the
Union plummetted by as much as
nearly 40 per cent during the
months of the boycott. Deficits in
the operation continued to mount
to ever higher levels.
Investigation
At this point, in response to
many complaints regarding the
Union, the ASSU began an
investigation of Tresidder. Public
hearings were held, at which any
members of the community with
ideas concerning the Union were
invited to testify. For nearly two
months after the close of these
hearings, I conducted an
investigation of Tresidder,
culmintating in the ASSU report
already referred to. The theme of
the report was that the Union was
suffering from the disease of inept
management, and that in order for
it to run efficiently, a new

organization and new
management would be required.
The response to these challenges
was immediae but superficial.
Union director Forrest Tregea was
forced to request a full-fledged
investigation by the University's
Internal Audit Office, and a new
food service director was
obtained.
As the university conducted its
own investigation, the newly
appointed student minority on
the Tresidder Union Committee —
Chuck Peterson, Borut Bekleva,
James Baer and I — attempted to
force changes in the operations at
Tresidder. Because we were a
minority, we were unable to
conduct more than a harassment
and holding operation, but
occasionally prodded Union
management to take action on
such matters as the campus bank
and the food service.
The release of the university's
own report on Tresidder greatly
stunned those connected with the
Union, for it merely echoed the
biting criticisms made in the
ASSU report. The demands for
the disbanding of the Tresidder
Committee and placing
management under the direct
command of a high level
university official, and for other
changes in the manner of
operations were reiterated. While
it did not call directly for the
firing of director Tregea and
business manager Phillip Duffy, it
did state that "the problem of the
Union being stagnant in its
operation will have to be solved
within the Union by establishing
more forward looking
management objectives and by
effectively implementing these
goals and objectives,.' and that
this will "necessitate a reversal of
philosophy for some individuals.
Those who cannot or will not
adapt to these conditions should
be removed from the
organization." In essence, the
university was called upon to give
Tregea and Duffy one more
chance to prove themselves
capable of managing the Union.
Failure
The real difference between
the University's report and that of
the ASSU was that we contended
that management's unbroken
record of failure and ineptitude
indicated without reasonable
doubt that they would not be
capable of performing the
necessary reforms; the
University's report indicated a

belief that with the disbanding of
the Tresidder Committee and the
designation of a full-time
administrative officer outside the
Union to whom the director
would be responsible, it might be
possible for Tregea and Duffy to
rescue TMU. An examination of
Tresidder's present position
indicates that our contention was
correct — present management has
been completely unsuccessful in
improving the financial position
of the Union, and in all areas but
the food service, operations have
not improved in any appreciable
manner.
Insofar as any actions upon
recommendations in the
University's report are concerned,
only a few of the changes have
been implemented. Most of these
occurred at the food service and
must be credited to Lee Schafer,
former directer of that operation.
Charles H. Peterson, the
extremely knowledgeable and
insightful chairman of the
Tresidder Committee, states:
"Those changes which have been
brought at Tresidder are very
superficial, such as minor
mechanical aspects of the
operation. The fundamental
change required at the Union —
the improvement of the
relationships of the people
involved, and the lack of coherent
management direction — has not
occurred." He adds that "most of
the improvements which have
occurred at Tresidder were due to
Lee Schafer. The other operations
are about as ill-managed and
inefficient as ever." The
I recommendations for change at
the retail store and the games
area, remain largely unacted upon.
The present management
arrangement cannot achieve the
reform of Tresidder. Merely to
make Tregea responsible to the
Dean of Students is insufficient,
for as Freelen freely admits, his
other duties preclude his taking
charge of the implementation of
necessary changes at the Union.
This means that the responsibility
for implementation devolves upon
the shoulders of the upper
management of Tresidder —
Tregea and Duffy. Such reform
demands the full-time attention of
extremely capable administrators
at the level of director and
business manager of TMU. Tregea
and Duffy have been unable to
shoulder this burden, as evidenced
by the sky-rocketing deficit of the
Union, and the extreme employee

dissatisfaction which forced the
firing of Schafer.
Deteriorating
The financial position of
Tresidder has continued to
deteriorate since the publication
of the University's report. The
most recent audit of TMU by the
university reports that the
operating deficit of the Union will
nearly double this year, increasing
from $146,000 to $276,000. For
the most recent time period, at
the food service sales rose
from $213,000 to $229,000,
while cost of sales increased from
$89,000 to $104,000, labor from
$110,000 to $142,000, and other
expenses from $15,000 to
$26,000. Revenue from other
operations has either declined, as
in the case of the games area, or
remained approximately the same
as last year, as in the case of the
store. The reserve position of the
Union has deteriorated
tremendously in the past six
months, moving from a deficit of
$34,000 in August 1971, to a
deficit of $159,000 in December
1971.
This five fold increase in the
deficit of reserves has been
financed through the stop-gap
measure of university payables,
sums owed by Tresidder to the
university, but not paid. In
addition, investments of the
Union have been sold off. At
present, the Union owes
the university a staggering
$400,000 for goods and services
rendered to it. TMU is five
months behind in its bill
payments, i.e. in March it will
begin to pay last October's bills.
The increase in University
payables amounts to $33,000 per
month, and as each month goes
by, Tresidder falls an additional .4
months behind in its bills. In
essence, the Union is on the brink
of bankruptcy.
To conclude this report, I will
suggest that in order to deal with
this crisis situation, the ASSU
press for the complete reform of
the Union by calling for the
replacement of present
management and the conversion
of TMU into a facility governed
above all by a will to serve the
swiftly changing needs of the
Stanford community. This can
best be accomplished by the
creation of a student union,
managed and controlled by
students, run for the benefit of
the entire community.

(The following is a report to the
ASSU Council of Presidents on
Tresidder Union.)
In response to a request from
Ann Kimball, I agreed to prepare
for the ASSU Council of
Presidents a report on the present
conditions at Tresidder Memorial
Union. Since our efforts to make
the Union responsive to the needs
of the Stanford community began
nine months ago, many reports
have been written, many articles
in the press published, and many
words spoken on the subject by
those in any way connected with
it. While we were successful in
bringing some beneficial changes
to Tresidder, the overall situation
there remains much the same in
many ways as before we began
our campaign for reform.
The reason for this lack of
fundamental renewal was first
pinpointed publicly in the ASSU
Senate Investigation Committee's
"Report on Tresidder Union" of
August, 1971 — the management
of Tresidder is incapable of
providing leadership or of bringing
any but the most superficial
