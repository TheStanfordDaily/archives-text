Editor, THE DAILY:
As a graduating student I
suddenly find myself faced with
the prospect of paying $1 to
finance capital expenditures for a
nursery with a management whose
competence has been questioned.
Furthermore the benefits of this
nursery are expected to accrue to
a small minority of those who are
forced to pay. I fully recognize
the right of federal, state, and
local governments (whose

composition I can affect by my
votes) to tax citizens to provide
benefits our society considers
necessary but are not furnished by
the market system. In the case of
the nursery not only is it
questionable that the market does
not provide adequate services, but
also we have a case of a university
collecting and enforcing the tax.
Just how far do the
University's rights extend when it
comes to collecting taxes imposed

by a few students on the entire
student body? Would the
administration collect from
students if the vote were to
provide school books for all
children eight years old whose
parents attend Stanford?
I hate to see the administration
suffer any more grief â€” the
radicals have diverted entirely too
much administrative effort away
from education already. But I still
hope some members of the
student community with
knowledge of the law will
challenge the University's right to
enforce taxes for purposes
unrelated to an education.
