# 'Paper Dolly'
## Dance Tryouts Stern Test 
### PATTY FELS Commentary 
The sad part about the whole thing
is that it was such a good idea.
When the feature editor called me
and said, "Would you like to do a
story, sort of an expose, on what it's
like to try out for the Pom Pon
Dollies?," that was my first thought.
What a good idea! Sort of a George
Plimpton-type endeavor. Someone
with absolutely no dancing talent (I
mean none. I haven't been to a dance
since eighth grade.) goes to all the
Dolly workshops and then tries out.
And then there's a long story in the
Daily about what a farce the Dollies
are, how out-of-step they are at a
school like Stanford.
Something like that. It should have
been a great story. Maybe they just got
the wrong reporter. Because the idea
wasn't to go for two sessions and then
quit. And, I sadly confess, that's
exactly what I did.
I'm not sure what happened, but by
the end of the second session I was
firmly convinced that Dolly tryouts
simply weren't 'my thing." And I
never wanted to go back. Never.
Blow to Ego
Half of it I guess, was the terrific
blow to my ego. During high school I
always sort of sneered at the pom line
girls, confident that I could dance just
as well, if I had the time. But of course
I was more interested in things like
being yearbook editor, getting good
grades, etc.
All the pom pon girls would come
into the yearbook office to order
pictures of themselves and they would
giggle over the pictures and burble,
"Oh, it must be so fun to work on the
yearbook" and leave. And I always felt
distinctly superior. I never really
thought that what they were doing
involved the least bit of talent.
But it does. God, it does. I know
now.
There are thousands of things to
remember while you're dancing.
Things like: Keep your hands in fists
at all times, follow your hands with
your eyes, make sure your arms are
straight from the shoulder, point your
toes when you turn, etc. etc. etc. And,
above all, you mustn't forget to KEEP
SMILING.
Patient Teachers
But the worst part for me was
remembering the routine. The former
Dollies are very patient teachers but
there comes a point when even they
ask increduously, "You mean you still
don't know it?" I don't deny that
after they've done the dance about 15
times even the most incredible dolt
should catch on. But I didn't.
And learning it is even harder when
there are people watching you. The
first day I was manfully struggling
with the third or fourth bars of "Come
Join the- Band" when, horror of
horrors, varsity basketball practice

ended. The boys all came and stood
around our little group and, while I
couldn't actually hear it, I could just
imagine what they were saying:
'Look at that klutz on the end —
the one with the fat legs. She's really
bad!"
They were absolutely correct. I was
bad. And by the end of the second
session I was almost in tears. That time
four other girls and I were in a dorm
lounge and under the careful scrutiny
of four guys who were sitting there —
laughing, talking and, worst of all,
watching us. I couldn't take it. After
an hour I murmured something about
a doctor's appointment and made a
graceful exit. I knew I'd never be able
to go back.
Enormous Eyes
Just looking at the girls the first
day, I should have anticipated the
outcome of my great story. Tall, thin,
and very pretty — enormous eyes and
thighs about as large around as my
wrists. And, of course, all extremely
coordinated.
They'd watch the routine once or
twice, work on it alone for five
minutes and say, "Do it once more,
Linda, and I think I'll have it." And I
would stand there, desperately trying
to recall how the third move went.
And when they did the entire routine
the only correction was, "You forgot
to point your toe near the end."

The procedure went like this —
Moves are divided into groups of four.
For example, on one you put your
arms over your head, on two you
touch them to your mouth, on three
you touch your toes, etc. The Dolly
would show us two or three groups of
four and we'd follow her.
After that we'd all work on it
privately for a while until we knew it
perfectly (or some of us did). Then
she'd show us more groups of four.
To Music
A bad part came when we'd have to
perform individually. But the worst,
the absolute worst, was doing the
routine to music.
Consider the situation: You hear
the introduction and you know that in
a second you'll have to start dancing
and all of a sudden the whole routine
leaves your mind — totally. You glance
around, hoping beyond hope, that
maybe everyone else has forgotten it,
or that the tape will break, or
something. But nothing can save you.
The music goes right on and everyone
else starts dancing and you stand
there, not even panicking anymore.
"Maybe I can learn it after I get
back to the dorm, maybe it's only the
pressure here that's making me forget
it," you tell yourself weakly.
Not all of the session is devoted to
learning the routines. The Dollies also
spend their time advising on how to
try out. Every girl has to perform two
learned routines and one original
dance in front of a board including
administrators, the former Dollies,
members of the band, representatives
of the teams, and even a member of
the ASSU Council of Presidents.
Neat and Cute
Candidates are judged in four
categories — skill, personality, looks
and originality (of their own routines).
"Personality" essentially means how
"neat and cute you look and how
much you smile."
The Dollies admit frankly that a lot
of the judging is based on looks alone.
"Be sure to wear something short
when you try out, culottes or a short
skirt, but something which will really
show your legs," my teacher advised,
"and tie your hair back so they can see
your face."
Dollies practice all spring and come
to Stanford a month early to get
ready. During that month they live
with five families on the same block.
One of the girls described her
relationship with the family as a
"beautiful experience" and said that
the closeness that the five Dollies
develop is the best part of the whole
thing.
Help!
It did sound fun. I could see why
some girls would be attracted to being
a Dolly. But the whole tryout bit
scared me — learning the impossibly
intricate required routines, making up
a dance of my own, trying to keep the
three of them straight, ard then doing
them over and over in front of a

super-critical board who would be
grading me in four areas on a scale
from one to five. Help!
Perhaps the hardest part while I was
going to the tryouts was keeping a
straight face when people from my
dorm did double takes — "You're
trying out for the Dollies?" And, of
course, there was always the facetious
question from my friends — "What if
you make it?" — followed by gales of
laughter.
So I quit, firmly convinced that it
takes more to be a Dolly than I've got.
It takes a lot more coordination, a
cuter figure and a hell of a lot of
nerve.
