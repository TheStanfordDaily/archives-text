Unfortunate
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the March 2, 1972 issue of
the Daily there appeared a letter
(in response to an earlier letter by
Mr. Spyros Andreopoulos
attacking Andreas Papandreou)
which erroneously included my
name as its writer. The letter was
written by the Bay Area Friends
of P.A.K. (Panhellenic Liberation
Movement). My name was to
appear in a note in case
documentation was needed about
the information presented in the
letter. While I agree with the
position of the Bay Area Friends
of P.A.K. and disagree with the
position of Mr. Andreopoulos, I
think it unfortunate that both
letters resorted to name-calling,
the second following the tone of
the first. A more restrained stating
of positions would have been
more effective and more fair to
the persons involved. What is of
foremost importance is to
honestly attempt to make the
very complex Greek situation
understood, and to make the

present plight of Greece known in
the U.S.

(Editor's Note: Mr. Andreopoulos
wishes to respond to the P.A.K.
letter in the following manner.)
The point, however, that needs
an answer is his charge that I
support the Greek military junta.
In no way have I expressed such
sympathy for or endorsed the
junta in my letter. In fact, I
stressed that this was an
unfortuante event which, in part,
reflected failure of the Greek
political system to maintain a
stable government. I wrote that
Papandreou himself had
contributed to that instability, and
argued it was unfair to blame all

of the Greek political problems on
the United States. I support and
share fully Dr. Maskaleris'
aspirations to see democracy
restored in Greece. But I do not
think Papandreou commands
sufficient respect among Greeks
to lead such effort.
