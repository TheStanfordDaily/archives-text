## Lottery And The New Loophole 
### 
It is important that men
currently classified 1-A or 1-A-O
and assigned to Subgroup A of
Extended Priority understand
how they may take advantage of a
current Selective Service directive
which will allow them to be
placed in Second Priority on
March 27, 1972. Men in Second
Priority are virtually immune
from induction.
Selective Service has already
announced that all men in
Subgroup B of the EPSG and who
are classified 1-A or 1-A-O will not
be drafted. These men in
Subgroup B will be placed in
Second Priority on April 1, 1972
and be classified 1-H, regardless of
whether or not they are on appeal
or otherwise involved in
procedural delays at that time.
This was confirmed in a press
release of February 8, 1972 in
which National Headquarters
Selective Service confirmed that
there would be no inductions

from Subgroup B.
Two groups of Subgroup A are
affected by a new directive,
"Temporary Instruction 632-1,"
issued by Curtis Tarr on February
2, 1972.
First, Tarr instructed local
boards to cancel induction orders
of "all registrants in a postponed
status whose original
postponement expires prior to
April 1, 1972. In those instances
where a postponement expired
prior to December 31, 1971, and
no subsequent action has been
taken, the induction order shall be
cancelled."
Postponed
This directive includes men
whose original 1971 induction
dates were postponed "to the first
call in 1972" or "until further
notice." It also includes men
whose initial postponements are
due to expire on a specific date
(such as the end of Winter
Quarter) prior to April 1, 1972. It
appears not to include men whose
postponements expire on a
specific date after April 1.
Second, the new loophole
offered by this Temporary
Instruction allows men in
Subgroup A who are currently
involved in any procedural delay,
such as a pending request for
appearance or appeal, to drop
their request for appearance or

appeal, in writing and before
March 26, 1972, and thus be
eligible to be placed in Second
Priority on March 27, 1972.
The Temporary Instruction is
based on a new SSS regulation
that places a man in Second
Priority if he remains for 270
consecutive days in the Extended
Priority Group, fully available,
without being inducted. For men
whose inductions will now be
cancelled or who drop their
requests for appearance or appeal,
the assumption will be that they
were fully available for call on
July 1, 1971. Thus, their 270 day
period ends on March 26, 1972,
and they will, on March 27, 1972,
be placed in Second Priority.
Selective Service is granting this
time period of availability because
of its own inability to act during
the last 8 months.
Time Available
Temporary Instruction No.
632-1 reads in part "(t)hese
registrants' (Subgroup A) credit
for time fully available for
induction (270 days) shall begin
from July 1, 1971 ... and will be
completed on March 26, 1972.
Consequently, all Subgroup A
registrants shall be assigned to the
Second Priority Selection Group
as of March 27, 1972, except

Susan swaringen

those whose inductions have been
postponed to a date after March
31, 1972 or who continue on that
date to be involved in a
procedural delay."
To take advantage of this new
loophole, a man must write to his
local board before March 26,
1972 and request to have any
previously demanded "procedural
delays" cancelled. He should state
that his request is solely for the
purpose of gaining the advantage
of Temporary Instruction 632-1
which allows him to be placed in
Second Priority on March 27,
1972 if he is not on that date
involved in any procedural delay.
He should further state that if for
any reason he cannot take
advantage of this Instruction, then
he wishes his local board to
disregard his letter and inform
him in writing of that fact and of
the reasons why he does not so
qualify. He should sign the letter
and include his address and
Selective Service number. The
letter should be sent by certified
mail, return receipt requested, as
soon as possible. At the very
outside, the letter should be
received by the local board not
later than March 20,1972.

whose inductions will now be
cancelled or who drop their
requests for appearance or appeal,
the assumption will be that they

July 1, 1971. Thus, their 270 day
period ends on March 26, 1972,
and they will, on March 27, 1972,
be placed in Second Priority.
Selective Service is granting this
time period of availability because
of its own inability to act during
the last 8 months.

632-1 reads in part "(t)hese
registrants' (Subgroup A) credit
for time fully available for
induction (270 days) shall begin

completed on March 26, 1972.
Consequently, all Subgroup A

Susan swaringen

those whose inductions have been

To take advantage of this new
loophole, a man must write to his
local board before March 26,
1972 and request to have any
previously demanded "procedural
delays" cancelled. He should state
that his request is solely for the
purpose of gaining the advantage
of Temporary Instruction 632-1
which allows him to be placed in
Second Priority on March 27,
1972 if he is not on that date
involved in any procedural delay.
He should further state that if for
any reason he cannot take
advantage of this Instruction, then
he wishes his local board to
disregard his letter and inform
him in writing of that fact and of
the reasons why he does not so
qualify. He should sign the letter
and include his address and
Selective Service number. The
letter should be sent by certified
mail, return receipt requested, as
soon as possible. At the very

received by the local board not
later than March 20,1972.

It is important that men
currently classified 1-A or 1-A-O
and assigned to Subgroup A of
Extended Priority understand
how they may take advantage of a
current Selective Service directive
which will allow them to be
placed in Second Priority on
March 27, 1972. Men in Second
Priority are virtually immune
from induction.
Selective Service has already
announced that all men in
Subgroup B of the EPSG and who
are classified 1-A or 1-A-O will not
be drafted. These men in
Subgroup B will be placed in
Second Priority on April 1, 1972
and be classified 1-H, regardless of
whether or not they are on appeal
or otherwise involved in
procedural delays at that time.
This was confirmed in a press
release of February 8, 1972 in
which National Headquarters
Selective Service confirmed that
there would be no inductions

from Subgroup B.
Two groups of Subgroup A are
affected by a new directive,
"Temporary Instruction 632-1,"
issued by Curtis Tarr on February
2, 1972.
First, Tarr instructed local
boards to cancel induction orders
of "all registrants in a postponed
status whose original
postponement expires prior to
April 1, 1972. In those instances
where a postponement expired
prior to December 31, 1971, and
no subsequent action has been
taken, the induction order shall be
cancelled."
Postponed
This directive includes men
whose original 1971 induction
dates were postponed "to the first
call in 1972" or "until further
notice." It also includes men
whose initial postponements are
due to expire on a specific date
(such as the end of Winter
Quarter) prior to April 1, 1972. It
appears not to include men whose
postponements expire on a
specific date after April 1.
Second, the new loophole
offered by this Temporary
Instruction allows men in
Subgroup A who are currently
involved in any procedural delay,
such as a pending request for
appearance or appeal, to drop
their request for appearance or

appeal, in writing and before
March 26, 1972, and thus be
eligible to be placed in Second
Priority on March 27, 1972.
The Temporary Instruction is
based on a new SSS regulation
that places a man in Second
Priority if he remains for 270
consecutive days in the Extended
Priority Group, fully available,
without being inducted. For men
whose inductions will now be
cancelled or who drop their
requests for appearance or appeal,
the assumption will be that they
were fully available for call on
