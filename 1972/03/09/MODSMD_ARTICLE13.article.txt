## 
### 
Following is the text of the Committee on
Services to Students report to Stanford President
Richard W. Lyman concerning recruitment policies at
the Career Planning and Placement Center.
Headed by Timothy C. Clark, a senior history major,
the committee includes Neil S. Bernstein, sophomore
undeclared major; Stanley E. Fischman, assistant profes
sor of psychiatry and pediatrics; Robert E. Freelen,
acting dean of students, ex officio without vote;
Suzanne E. Lewis, assistant professor of art history;
Ronald A. Rebholz, associate professor of English;
Thomas A. Rliue, assistant dean of graduate studies;
Fernando Sanchez, sophomore economics major; Peter
R. Van Petten, sophomore undeclared major; and
Christian F. Winkle IV, senior political science major.
1. RECOMMENDATIONS
In these recommendations, the phrase "formal place
ment facilities" includes the Career Planning and Place
ment Center, the Law School Placement Office, the
Placement Center at the Graduate School of Business,
and any similar facilities which may be established in the
future. It does not include White Plaza or the offices of
individual professors.
I. That more information be made available on com
panies recruiting at the formal placement facilities of
Stanford University through the maintenance of an open
file on each recruiting company. This file should contain
all information submitted by individuals or organiza
tions, including, of course, the company itself. Informa
tion submitted should be signed and have an address of
the person or organization submitting the information.
Copies of materials in this file should be submitted to
the companies which recruit so there will be a chance for
rebuttal and so recruiters may be prepared to answer
questions which interviewees may ask. The opportunity
for rebuttal of statements or allegations should be ex
tended to everyone, and all such rebuttals should also be
included in the file.
There are also a number of general studies or publica
tions on what companies are doing work in specific areas
which have come to the attention of the Committee.
These concern such topics as production of weaponry,
number, value, and nature of contracts with the Depart
ment of Defense, performance in areas of ecological
concern, and others. The Committee recommends that
these and other such publications which may appear in
the future be included in the materials available at the
Placement Center. The following is a partial list which
the Committee recommends:
Council on Economic Priorities Newsletter
Defense Marketing Service (DMS) Intelligence
Report
American Friends Service Committee publications
National Action Research on Military-Industrial
Complex (NARMIC) publications
(Approved unanimously)
2. That all companies recruiting at the formal place
ment facilities of Stanford University be required to fill
out a questionnaire which asks questions relating to
student concerns about company practices. Companies
should be required to complete this questionnaire as a
condition for its recruiting. The questionnaire should be
revised annually. (Approved unanimously)
3. That no policy review and recommending body in
addition to the Committee on Services to Students be
established for the Career Planning and Placement
Center. (Approved unanimously)
4. That military recruiters be barred from using the
formal placement facilities of Stanford University.
(Approved 8-1; Bernstein. Clark, Lewis, Rebholz, Rliue,
Sanchez, Van Petten and Winkle voted yes, Fischman
voted no.)
5. That a referendum of the student body establish
the policy of whether military recruiters and recruiters
from companies falling within specific legislative guide
lines relating to their production of weapons of war
should be barred from the formal placement facilities of
Stanford University.
The Committee recommends that this referendum be
conducted differently from an ASSU referendum. We
suggest some method by which all registered students
receive a ballot, as well as a summary of the arguments
which this Committee found most important on both
sides of the issue. We suggest that either mailing ballots
to all registered students or distributing ballots through
the registration procedures would be appropriate. Be
cause opinions change, we further recommend that the
referendum be repeated in two years. (Approved 5-4;
Bernstein, Clark, Rebholz, Sanchez and Van Petten
voted yes; Fischman, Lewis, Rliue, and Winkle voted
no.)
The following proposed recommendation was de
feated 5-4:
That, on principle, some companies producing
weapons of war should be barred from using the formal
placement facilities of Stanford University. (Defeated
4-5; Bernstein, Rebholz, Sanchez, and Van Petten voted
yes; Clark, Fischman, Lewis, Rhue, and Winkle voted
110.)
11. LIMITATION OF SCOPE
The Committee has limited the scope of its recom
mendations to the formal placement facilities of Stan
ford and specifically excluded White Plaza and individual
professors' offices for a number of reasons:
1. The arranging of interviews and providing of office
space for those interviews amounts to a direct University
subsidy of a private business transaction between re
cruiter and interviewee. Thus, the University may make
a decision on whether it wishes to continue subsidizing
certain of these business transactions.
2. To include White Plaza in any exclusionary policy
would be to infringe on White Plaza's de facto status as a
place where a wide range of activities takes place in an
unregulated fashion.
3. To include an individual professor's office within
any exclusionary policy would require the regulation of
essentially private conversations between a professor and
a representative from a recruiting organization. One can
imagine that a professor might invite a former student
who is working for a particular organization to talk with
the professor while other students were present and
participating in the conversation. A policy which
included conversations in professors' offices would in

volve difficulties both in enforcement and in definition
of precisely what constituted a recruiting interview.
4. In general, the problems of enforcement are
greatly reduced by limiting any exclusionary policy to
those facilities which are established specifically for
recruitment.
5. Nothing in these recommendations should be
construed as limiting access to campus by anyone for
purposes other than recruitment. Members of excluded
organizations should be allowed and encouraged to come
to Stanford to discuss the activities and policies of their
organization, even though barred from recruiting in the
formal placement facilities.
111. DISCUSSIONS OF
UNANIMOUS RECOMMENDATIONS
1. More information and open file.
This recommendation is aimed at correcting the pre
sent situation where generally the only information
available to a student who is interested in a particular
company is the public relations brochures put out by the
company itself. Dr. Keller emphasized to the Committee
the inadequacy of the information available to students,
and urged that a Career Information Service be funded
and established.
A number of suggestions were made to the Commit
tee on how to make this information available, and we
recommend that an open file on each company be
maintained for a number of reasons:
A. Financial: It was suggested that the University
sponsor an extensive examination of companies
recruiting at Stanford, a task which would require much
effort and expense. Maintaining an open file on each
company would require only someone to establish the
files and then file whatever information is submitted, as
well as making the contents of the file available to the
company periodically. It seems that initially this could
be accomplished by one work-study student who would
have responsibility for doing these relatively simple
tasks. The Committee urges that the funding for one
additional work-study position at the Placement Center
for this purpose be made available.
B. Legal: It has been suggested that having the Uni
versity publish a report on a company's activities would
make it liable for erroneous information contained in
the report. Our hope is that a policy of accepting
whatever signed information is submitted will avoid any
sanction of these materials by the University and hence
avoid the legal difficulties.
C. Censorship: Accepting all information submitted
would remove the danger that some information would
be censored for being inappropriate, insignificant, in
accurate, or whatever. Allowing the opportunity for
rebuttal should reduce the possibility of misinformation
being perpetuated.
Some set of procedures or guidelines will have to be
developed by the Placement Center staff as to how such
an open file system will be handled. Procedures should
include a comple'e review of the files every two or three
years. The Commit tee requests that whatever procedures
are decided upon be submitted to COSS for approval
before they are put into operation.
The Committee supports giving the Placement Center
whatever additional funding or space is necessary to
carry out this policy.
2. Mandatory questionnaire
The questionnaire is a means to get information
which may be valuable to students and which can be
gotten most easily from the company itself. We believe
the questionnaire should be mandatory; otherwise it is a
meaningless or half-hearted gesture.
It is not our intent that questions be so numerous or
detailed that the questionnaire would serve as a de facto
exclusionary device.
If this recommendation is accepted, the Committee
will send a letter to Dr. Keller suggesting questions
which we feel should be included on such a question
naire. Generally, we would include questions about De
partment of Defense contracts (dollar amounts, percent
of total and general categories of materials or
services supplied), classified contracts (number and
dollar amount), affirmative action programs for minor
ities and women, overseas operations, degree of involve
ment in community programs, plans for preserving the
environment, and whether the company is presently or
has been recently involved in criminal court actions
involving company actions.
The questionnaire should be returned to the Place
ment Center several weeks prior to the scheduled re
cruiting interviews so that interviewees can look at the
answers before their interviews. Because student inte
rests and concerns change over time, we recommend that
the questionnaire be revised annually. Again, the Com
mittee requests that the questionnaire be submitted to
COSS for approval before it is used.
3. No further advisory board
The Committee believes establishing a policy review
board for the Career Planning and Placement Center is
unnecessary. Most of the Center's activities are routine
administrative tasks or individual counseling, and there is
general agreement that these are performed in a compe
tent and friendly fashion. Dr. Keller stated that while he
would welcome such a board if the Committee felt it
necessary, he believed that the Placement Center had
adequate student input already. The Placement Center
seems to be quite responsive to student needs, and we
believe that this Committee is a sufficient body to
review policies at the Placement Center. A further body
would be an unnecessary pyramiding of the bureaucracy.
IV. MAJORITY STATEMENT ON MILITARY
RECRUITMENT
The decision to favor the exclusion of all military
recruiters from the formal placement facilities of Stan
ford University was reached by the Committee with a
vote of 8 to I. This was the only area of restrictive
recruitment upon which a substantial majority of Com
mittee members could agree, primarily because it was
the single case where individual students would not be
denied an essential service. A student's access to military
positions or training programs in the armed forces would
in no way be curtailed by a policy banning military
recruiters from using the form 1 Maccment facilities at
Stanford because the military i : ces maintain recruit
ment facilities in close proximity to the campus.

Furthermore, competition for jobs in the armed services
does not operate at levels comparable or equal to that
for jobs in the civilian labor market. Thus, the policy we
recommend would neither limit services available to stu
dents in any significant way nor would any students be
denied important opportunities in seekingjobs.
For those on the Committee who favored maintaining
a policy of open recruitment for companies with DOD
contracts, the decision to ban the military was based on
a fundamental belief that the University should divorce
itself from military functions, whether it be DOD con
tracts, ROTC training or military recruiting. The military
has no proper place within the fabric of the University as
an independent private and domestic institution. The
degree of coercive involvement with the DOD insofar as
military recruiting is concerned may be observed in the
fact that military recruiting on campus is demanded by
the DOD as a condition for the awarding of its research
contracts to the University. Again, private companies do
not and indeed should not create similar erosions of the
University's right to function as a free and independent
institution.
Neil S. Bernstein Thomas A. Rhue
Timothy C. Clark Fernando Sanchez
Suzanne E. Lewis Peter Van Petten
Ronald A. Rebholz Christian F. Winkle IV
Bernstein, Rebholz, Sanchez, and Van Petten add to
the reasons above the following argument for barring
military recruiters from formal placement facilities:
Recruitment of talented and trained people by the
armed forces is the first act in a clearly definable process
that results in the unwarranted and hence immoral
killing of people in Indochina. Stanford University, by
lending its placement facilities and the prestige of its
name to military recruiters, aids that process. It should
stop doing so, primarily because aiding the agents of an
immoral act is itself immoral and theref ore incompatible
with the nature of the university. Furthermore, barring
military recruiters from formal placement facilities will
be a political gesture that announces the opposition of
Stanford students to the war and invites imitation by
students at other universities.
The arguments that should be weighed against this
line of reasoning are analogous to those raised against
barring certain companies from formal placement facili
ties. Those arguments are discussed in the minority re
port on barring companies and should be considered
there.
V. MINORITY STATEMENT ON MILITARY
RECRUITMENT
As I have mentioned frequently in our meetings, 1
feel I understand and sympathize with the thoughts and
feelings that lie behind the advocacy of abolition of
certain organizations from utilizing the University Place
ment Services. However, the very act of judging, espe
cially on a moral basis, who may and may not have
access to the University and its facilities is potentially a
very dangerous act which seems antithetical to the very
nature of a University. Morality, in particular, changes
from generation to generation; witness the current
approaches to some of the very accepted and cherished
values of generations of students who graduated but a
few short years ago.
I fully realize that this University (and most other
"great universities") fall somewhat short of this ideal,
but I do not believe that past inadequacies and mistakes
should justify the cessation of efforts directed toward
the ideal. The forces of repression are ever around us,
both within the University community and without.
Indeed, if the University were to go along with the
barring of military recruiters from the Stanford campus
because of the precedent that it has set regarding exclu
sion of certain corporations (Goldman-Sachs) and
barring our basketball team from playing B/igham
Young University, we would, at once, continue to estab
lish precedents that will in the long run be inimical to
the concept of the University as a sanctuary of reason
and discourse.
Yes, it is true that the military's role on the campus is
out of proportion. This is true on many levels of the
University and, in my opinion, has had a definite, delete
rious effect. However, to deal with that issue will take a
considerable amount of soul-searching, hard work, and
reevaluation of the University within our society rather
than an impulsive, finger-waving symbolic gesture
directed at a very minor symptom. Indeed, it is my
opinion that even if this act were effective, the cost to
our personal integrity and freedom, in the long run, will
be excessive.

VI MAJORITY STATEMENT ON REFERENDUM
It is in some ways unfortunate that the question of
whether a referendum is a valid method of decision
making is intertwined here with the specific issue of the
recruitment policy at the Placement Center. However,
the question of what a referendum means never comes
up except in the context of a specific referendum on a
subject of controversy. The arguments used against stu
dent referenda arc generally similar no matter what the
issue, and'reduce themselves to three propositions:
1. The referenda which have been conducted are
flawed in a variety of ways.
2. Students are only one constituency of the Uni
versity; student referenda should therefore be only
one input into a decision.
3. A referendum is always an unsatisfactory way
to make a decision, and this is especially true in a
University.
A. Flaws in past referenda
We recognize the problems which there have been
with past ASSU referenda, and for this reason our re
commendation specifies some differences between this
referendum and an ASSU referendum. The objections to
past referenda generally refer to vague wording of propo
sitions, insufficient publicity, little public discussion of
the issues, the fact that only in retrospect is a referen
dum regarded as anything but advisory, and actual irre
gularities in voting. We believe that the referendum we
have recommended meets these objections.
Appendix C contains the wording which we propose
for the referendum. It would be appropriate for the
elected representatives of the student body, the Student

Space paid for by University Relations
Senate, to approve the final wording of the propositions.
(If some restrictions are adopted, potential recruiters
would be required to submit a statement that they
qualify under the regulations before being allowed to
recruit at Stanford. Any person could submit evidence
that a potential recruiter does not qualify, with disputes
to be resolved by the Committee on Services to Students
after an investigation.)
There has certainly been ample publicity and discus
sions of recruitment policies at the Placement Center.
However, in an attempt to provide each voter with the
arguments made on both sides of the issue, we urge that
a statement from each side accompany the ballot which
each student receives. Members of this Committee are
willine to submit these arguments to be included with
the ballots. Of course, there would undoubtedly be
further discussion of the issue in the Daily and probably
from organized groups on both sides of the issue.
Clearly there will be no ambiguity about the role of
the referendum in decision making if our recommenda
tion that it be binding is accepted. Voting irregularities
should be reduced by mailing each individual student a
ballot and a stamped envelope for its return. Using
numbered ballots should guarantee ballots would not be
duplicated.
The recommendation includes a provision that the
referendum be repeated in two years. We subscribe to
the belief that recruitment policy should reflect commu
nity sentiment, and clearly that sentiment is subject to
change over time. Others assert that recruitment policy
should be based on some kind of principle which is
immune to variation over time. A principle exists only as
long as it is supported by some kind of consensus;
obviously the consensus which existed at one time in
regard to recruitment policy no longer exists. Until it
becomes clear that a consensus on principle once again
exists, we see no alternative but to review the policy
periodically. Such review necessarily makes the issue
both recurring and political. However, falling back on a
principle which is no longer supported by a consensus is
unlikely either to put the issue to rest nor to reduce the
political controversy surrounding it.
B. Students only one constituency
The Career Planning and Placement Center exists be
cause it provides a service which benefits students. Other
persons or groups benefit as well, but these benefits are
secondary and do not in themselves justify the existence
of a Placement Center. In simplest terms, our argument
is that students should set policy for a student service.
Certainly there are other affected constituencies, but
their interests are not primary and their rational con
cerns can as well be considered by the student body as a
whole as by an official University committee or a Uni
versity administrator.
Certainly it is not always appropriate for a student
referendum to establish University policy, even on
matters pertaining strictly to student services. When
there are policies which affect the Constitutional rights
of an individual or other rights which have been speci
fically guaranteed, these should not be subject to refer
enda. However, there is no question of rights involved in
recruitment policy, at least in the ordinary definition of
that word.
It may be that the real reason there is so much
resistance to allowing students to make decisions about
policy for the Placement Center is that it simply is
politically unfeasible. It may be that certain elements of
the Stanford community which have some power object
to having students making such decisions. If such is the
case, if faculty, Trustees, perhaps some administrators,
are using their power to prevent the establishment of a
mechanism by which students set policy for a student
service, then this obstacle to change should be publicly
discussed as the real reason why a referendum is
opposed.
C. Referendum an unsatisfactory mechanism
We regard the referendum as an improved il imperfect
tool for making the decision on recruitment policy at
the Placement Center. Wc are forced back to our basic
assertion on control of the Placement Center: students
should establish policy for this student service. Of the
available ways for students to democratically decide
policy, at this time the referendum seems the most
desirable. The other alternative which comes to mind is
some sort of representative system, like the Student
Senate. However, the issues concerning Placement
Center policy are basically questions of values, and the
most direct way to ascertain the values of the student
community is by referendum.
Those opposed to referenda as a decision-making
device generally believe that there are other adequate
channels for student input into the decision-making
process. The fact that students comprise a majority of
this Committee is sometimes cited as evidence of student
input into decision-making. This argument ignores the
very fundamental difference between giving advice and
making decisions. Persons without power are rarely
satisfied with merely giving advice, and persons with
power usually regard the giving of advice as sufficient
input for those without power. Yet if we imagine a
situation where students had the power to make this
decision, it seems highly predictable that other constitu
encies would object that they were only giving advice.
There would be fear that the decision would go the
"wrong way" and that interests of the Administration,
for instance, were not adequately considered in the final
decision. The question is not one of adequate channels
for student input, but of the ultimate decision-making
power.
A companion argument of lelcrcndum opponents is
that those who will be held accountable for a decision
should have the power to make the decision. However, if
the power to make a decision is transferred to a different
constituency, the students in this instance, then the
former possessor of that power (the Administration)
should no longer be held accountable for the decision.
Certainly the effects of whatever decision students might
make on Placement Center recruitment policy would
change the situation which administrators must work
with, but these effects would be similar toother factors
which change the environment in which administrators
must operate at present.
It is true that the President would probably be held
accountable for the decision to give the power to stu
