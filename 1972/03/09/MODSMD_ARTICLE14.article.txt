# President Lyman's Response to Report
## 
### 
Following is the text of a March 7 letter from Presi
dent Lyman to: Members of the Committee on Services
to Students:
I have received the report on recruitment policy of
the Committee on Services to Students and I want to
thank the members of COSS for their willingness to
grapple with the difficult issues raised by policy in that
area. 1
The fact that the Committee was, itself, closely
divided on several of its key recommendations is evi
dence both of the difficulty of the issues and the extent
to which they divide the University. It is also evidence, if
more were needed, that these issues cannot be settled on
the basis of a set of propositions that are so self-evi
dently true that all opposition will dissolve before them.
There are very real differences here, both of principle
and of predictions about practical consequences. I hope
that the steps taken to clarify and in some respects to
modify recruitment policy can in some measure narrow
those differences, or at the very least, make them less
inflammatory. My reactions to the COSS recommenda
tions follow.
1. The proposals having to do with obtaining more
information about companies recruiting at the Place
ment Center and making that information more easily
accessible to students are important steps in the right
direction. That direction, as 1 have said many times, is to
make students aware of the ethical and moral basis of
their choices and of the likely practical consequences; to
provide them information and analysis bearing on those
choices; and then to permit them to choose. I believe
that this approach is more compatible with the spirit of
the University than is the exclusion of those of whom
we disapprove. I am asking the Dean of Students and the
Director of Placement to develop workable mechanisms
toward that end, using the COSS recommendations as
their point of departure, and to discuss their conclusions
with COSS before putting them into effect.
2. COSS has recommended that military recruiters be
barred from using the formal placement facilities of the
University. In response to my question, the Committee
indicated that this recommendation is intended to apply
to recruitment to civilian positions in the Department of

Defense as well as to the uniformed services.
It is our present interpretation of the law which gov
erns research support by NASA and DOD that to accept
the COSS recommendation would mean the loss to Stan
ford of more than $16 million annual research support
on which about 1,000 faculty, staff, and students cur
rently depend. To take such a step with knowledge of
those consequences would be utterly irresponsible.
COSS has suggested first that the law is in some
respects ambiguous and second that it should, in any
case, be challenged in the Congress and in the courts.
With respect to the former, I fully agree that we should
be as certain as it is possible to be about the application
of the law to various alternative arrangements. I am,
therefore, taking steps to get as authoritative an interpre
tation as it is possible to have.
In contrast, the possibility of a successful challenge to
the law is at best remote. However unwise they may be,
the restrictions with which we are faced seem clearly
within the authority of the Congress to impose. Thus, a
successful challenge through the courts is unlikely.
COSS's own legal advice reached the same conclusion.
I have no doubt that, eventually, the law, itself, will
be changed. The best judgment I can find, though, is
that it is' not likely to be changed soon. We should, and
will, be making efforts toward that end, but to suggest,
as COSS appears to, that the restrictions "should be
challenged regardless of the likelihood of success," and
that the challenge should be accompanied or preceded
by the elimination of military recruiting, is neither
realistic nor useful advice.
3. Since a decision that could cost the University
more than $16 million a year would have profound
consequences for the academic programs of the institu
tion, I am asking the Steering Committee of the faculty
Senate whether the Senate wishes to consider and give
advice on military recruiting and on the borader issue of
selective recruiting, generally. 1 am also asking the
Provost to seek advice from the Deans of Schools on the
effects and the desirability of changes in recruitment
policy as seen from their vantage point.
4. I have said that student opinion about placement
activities is an important element in decisions about the

nature, extent and, indeed, the very existence of those
activities. There is more than one valid way to gauge that
opinion. One obvious and important measure is the
extent to which the service is actually used. That in
formation is available and must be considered.
COSS has suggested a referendum as another way.
Under the proper circumstances a referendum that
supplied broader and more reliable information about
student opinion that did earlier votes would be useful.
We should not, however, underestimate the difficulty of
devising a useful voting process. To cite but one exam
ple, COSS suggests the following question: "Should at
least some companies which engage in research or pro
duction for the military services be denied the use of the
formal placement facilities for recruiting purposes?"
Another way of asking that same question might be,
"Should Stanford students, as individuals, be able to
choose freely those companies with which they wish to
have employment interviews on campus?"
If, as I suspect, those two questions would produce
different results, one is led to caution about the value of
a process that solicits opinion about complicated issues
by asking seemingly simple questions. For this reason, as
well as for others 1 have already stated, 1 could not treat
the- result of any referendum on these issues as binding
on policy.
In closing, I should perhaps make explicit what has
been implicit in everything I have said so far. The issue
of recruitment policy, unlike some other questions of
educational policy and students or faculty affairs, is one
which the President of the University has an inescapable
responsibility to decide finally. There is no entity or set
of entities on the campus to which I could delegate my
own responsibilities for the consequences of a bad deci
sion.
In reaching decisions on recruiting policy I want to
have the best possible information on the likely effects
of alternative course and on the views of members of the
University community. The course of action I have out
lined here is designed to provide that information as a
necessary condition for decisions taken in the best inte
rests of the University.
