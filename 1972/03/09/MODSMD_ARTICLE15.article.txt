# Student-Faculty Grievance Matters
## 
### 
hollowing is the text of a March 2 letter from Provost
William F. Miller to Graduate Studies Dean Lincoln
Moses and Undergraduate Studies Dean James L. Gibbs
Jr. concerning student-faculty grievances on academic
matters.
The traditional course of action for a student who
believes that he or she has been treated improperly with
respect to any academic matter has been to appeal to the
chairman of the department concerned. As I suggested in
the attached letter ol February 17, 1972, to the Steering
Committee ol the Academic Senate, this procedure may
sometimes prove inadequate. After consulting with
members of the Steering Committee, I am promulgating
the following supplementary procedure.
You are hereby charged with investigating and
resolving grievances between students and faculty mem
bers on issues pertaining to academic matters. The Dean
of Graduate Studies will be responsible for grievances
arising in the graduate and professional schools. The
Dean of Undergraduate Studies will be responsible for
grievances arising in undergraduate academic matters.
A student who has a grievance should go first to the
relevant department chairman and then to the relevant
school dean; one would hope that most cases will still be
resolved in this way. Your offices should, however, be
available (a) where this route has been pursued and has
not resulted in a resolution satisfactory to the parties;
(b) where the department chairman or school dean
wishes to refer the matter to you; and (c) where the
student desires to discuss the grievance prior to dis
cussing it with the department chairman.
In the event that the grievance conies to you as a
result ol either (a) or (b) above, you should conduct
whatever independent investigation of the disputed
issres that you deem necessary. In some instances you

may find it helpful to draw on the expertise and inde
pendent judgment of faculty at Stanford or elsewhere.
After investigating the matter, you should prepare
written findings and recommendations which you are
authorized to implement. Your findings, recommenda
tions, and any action taken should be transmitted to me,
to department chairmen, and (except where necessary to
preserve confidentiality) to the parties involved. If you
conclude that a faculty member has engaged in conduct
that warrants disciplinary action, please report this to
me so that 1 may initiate appropriate proceedings. Simi
larly, if a student has engaged in conduct that warrants
disciplinary action, you will initiate proceedings in the
appropriate offices.
Should the parties involved not find your resolution
of a grievance satisfactory, they may, of course, appeal
to me and, ultimately, to the President. I have every
confidence, however, that the procedure outlined above,
providing opportunity for review from outside the de
partment in which a grievance arises, will result in a
satisfactory resolution of all but the most unusual cases.
Additionally, ! should like for you to report to me by
the end of the Fall Quarter, 1972-73, as to the experi
ence you have had with this procedure in order that 1
'may report to the Senate of the Academic Council. The
Steering Committee and I did not find it possible to
anticipate what substantive issues may arise with suffi
cient frequency as to require an alteration in the rules or
practices affecting student-faculty relationships. If sub
stantive issues do arise that require an alteration of our
accepted rules or practices, I suggest that you raise these
issues with the appropriate committees of the Academic
Council. We have Council committees with jurisdiction
covering every aspect of academic responsibility
appraisal and achievement, graduate studies, undergradu

ate studies, etc. I am sure that any one of these commit
tees will be willing to undertake the consideration of
changes in rules or practices that are required to make
sure that we have an equitable student-faculty relation
ship.
I want to emphasize that this matter of student
faculty relationships in academic matters is largely a
faculty responsibility. The procedure above may, itself,
help to resolve a number of grievances that may arise,
but also it is a device to bring back to the faculty,
through the various committees, substantive issues that
must be acted upon by the faculty.
