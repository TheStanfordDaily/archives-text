# Unanimous Opinion On CJP Legality
## 
### 
This is a somewhat unusual proceeding and regretably
we have relatively little precedent to guide us in our
decision. Nonetheless the issue presented here - the
basic legality of the Campus Judicial Panel - is an
important one which must be decided.
Our Jurisdiction to Decide This Case
The University Administration has argued that we do
not have jurisdiction to decide our own legality since
this question of law can be decided in the first instance
only by the President of the University and, in the
second instance, by the civil courts, should a student
bring suit there alleging that his legal rights were
violated. On the other hand, as members of the CJP, we
are responsible for our own actions, and if we have been
asked by the President to participate in any illegal
enterprise, we have a very simple duty not to do so.
Moreover, if we were to participate in disciplining a
student who claims that we are without authority to
discipline him, that student could, under our rule 18,
bring a charge before us that he had been improperly
disciplined. In hearing such a charge we would in effect
be obliged to make a judgment on our own legitimacy,
(i.e., we would have to rule whether we are in fact "the
judicial system in effect," in the language of section IB
of our Procedures.) And if we could under our rules have
an obligation to make such a judgment, clearly we must
have the authority to make this judgment, if we have
any authority at all.
It is true that the problem of the remedy for an
illegally constituted CJP is a subtle one. If we were to
hand down an opinion seeking to bind our successors to
the illegality of the CJP, we would be exercising a
jurisdiction which we have disclaimed. It is possible that
the proper course of action to remedy an illegally
constituted CJP would simply be our resignations. In
any event, we need not decide this difficult question
because we have examined at great length the arguments
of the defendants and conclude that the CJP is legally
constituted under University "law".
The Basis of the CJP
We will begin with the theory under which the CJP is
constituted; then we will move on to discuss our reasons
for rejecting each of the several grounds under which the
defendants would have us hold this body illegal.
The CJP purports to be set up under the President's
"Residual Authority" contained in Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968, a charter which
was approved by the three major constituencies of the
University, the Student Body, the Faculty, and the
Administration. Article IV provides:
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority
and power of the President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing student conduct
at Stanford University, except in extraordinary
circumstances the SCLC and SJC shall have
primary responsibility for promulgating such
regulations and adjudicating violations thereof.
In short, Article IV binds the President to use the SJC
except in "extraordinary circumstances." In
extraordinary circumstances, however, the President
gnay "enforce regulations governing student conduct"
It is the President's theory that extraordinary
circumstances existed when the Student Senate, over a
period of some eight months, at first failed, and then
refused, to appoint the student members to the SJC
selection committee which would select the student
participants to bring the SJC into existence for that
year. We need not go into the rights and wrongs of the
Student Senate action. It has been defended before us as
merely a technique of exerting pressure upon the
President to do things that were morally or legally
correct. Regardless of its justification, it certainly
amounted to "extraordinary circumstances" within the
meaning of Article IV and hence gave the President the
power to set up a different judicial system.
This is not to say that the President was free to set up
a system that was intrinsically irrational or unfair. Aside
from any legal impediments to his power — which we
will discuss later - the fact is that within the University
community there are political checks upon the
President's power. In part, the students and, perhaps to a
greater extent, the faculty do exert influence in this type
of decision. Otherwise, it would be hard to see why any
chief executive officer would, if completely
unconstrained, set up a system as elaborate as the CJP
simply to do what he thought was correct. In any event,
we need not deal with that issue because the defendants
do not claim here that there is anything about the rules
or procedures of the CJP that is inherently irrational or
unfair. Their complaints are somewhat different.
The ASSU Constitution
The first major attack upon the legality of the
Campus Judicial Panel is that Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter, on which the CJP is
based,was limitedby Article IV of the ASSU constitution
passed and approved by the trustees and the president
subsequent to the Charter, in 1969. The ASSU
constitution, Article IV, Section 1, provides that
"The association (i.e. the student body] shall
recognize the authority of university judicial
bodies over members of the association only if
those judicial bodies shall have been approved
by two-thirds of those members of the
association voting in a general election."
It is the contention of the defendants that these words
which were accepted by the Trustees and President,
constitute a limitation on the President's power under
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter. We
disagree.
To be sure the words of the ASSU constitution on
their face support the defendants' position. When one
looks at the question somewhat more closely, however,
one finds insurmountable problems in accepting the
defendants reasoning.
First, it is clear that the President and Trustees did
not think they had given up any of the President's
residual power under Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter. Indeed, the residual authority of the
President has been vigorously defended by the Trustees
and President essentially since the very beginning of the
University and Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter was simply a recognition of this. To argue that
the Trustees and the President of the University had
agreed to place restrictions on this power without any
Qualifications for emereencies. extraordinary

circumstances or the like, qualifications appearing in
every other limitation of the Presidential power, is to ask
us to believe more than we can. This is especially true
since the consequence of accepting this argument is
that no judicial body at all could be established to
replace the defunct SJC unless it could muster a
two-thirds vote of the students. This might well leave the
University permanently without any means of enforcing
discipline on the campus - a result that no constituency
of the University has supported.
Secondly, the ASSU constitution, as a whole, was
obviously not intended to affect student rights with
respect to those of any other constituency of the
University. A constitution is an allocation of power
within a constituency, and here the constituency was the
student body. The provision requiring a two-thirds vote
of the student body simply determines how the student
body can exercise what power it holds under other
university arrangements; it does not increase the power
of the student body by giving it (indeed, one student
more than one third of those voting) any additional
power which, as a constituency, the students did not
have before Article IV of the ASSU constitution. The
ASSU constitution has the effect of making clear what
was not clear earlier — that is if the student constituency
were asked to approve any judicial body, a simple
majority vote would not be sufficient. The CJP is
founded on an entirely different provision of University
law, the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968 and no
allocation of power and competence within any one
constituency can change this.
This is especially clear in this case since one of the
major constituencies of the University, the Faculty, is
completely ignored by the defense's reading of Article
IV of the ASSU constitution. The Faculty was a party to
the Legislative and Judicial Charter, and had a
continuing interest in that Charter. It had voted for the
President's Article IV power and cannot now be told
that, without any notice to it, an agreement between the
students and the President had changed the rules it had
adopted.
The Academic Senate had already adhered to this
view in acknowledging the legitimacy of the Campus
Judicial Panel. In its resolution of February 17, 1972,
(published in Campus Reports February 23, page 2,
Senate Report (No. 9) the Academic Senate requested
"the prompt prosecution [of certain cases] through
appropriate judicial mechanisms including the Campus
Judicial Panel." The legislative history of this resolution
makes its meaning clear. It was pointed out that the
wording prejudged the legitimacy of the CJP, which had
not yet been authoritatively decided. Despite this, the
resolution carried by a vote of 36 to 1, with three
abstentions. Indeed had the President and the student
body purported to limit Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, they might be in breach of
contract with the faculty.
The conclusion that the ASSU constitution was never
intended as a restriction upon the residual authority of
the President is buttressed by the actions of the Student
Senate itself. It is conceded that the Student Senate, in
refusing to make its appointments to the selection
committee for the SJC, had contemplated that the
President would set up another judicial body. Despite
this so far as we can tell, there was no hint of any
argument by anyone at the time that the ASSU
constitution (as distinguished from all sorts of principles
of fairness or political rights) would prevent the
President from doing this. We must note that the ASSU
constitution was adopted in 1969 within the memory of
many of those presently in the Student Senate. Their
silence on this issue, at a time when it would have been
most relevant, speaks volumes on the intent of the ASSU
Framers.
The Legislative and Judicial Charter
The next argument of the defendants is that the CJP
is illegally constituted because of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter itself. It is the theory of the defendants
that Section I(DX2X C ) of that Charter requires the
President "to go first to the SCLC to get his proposals
through". Section 1(D)(2)(c) provides as follows:
Interim regulations promulgated under Section
1(2) shall expire 90 days after publication
unless within that period the SCLC has taken
steps to promulgate a regulation in the same
area under the procedure specified in Section
D(l), in which case the interim regulation may
remain in effect until the conclusion of the
Section D(l) procedure.
It seems to us the subsection simply does not say what
the defendants contend. Moreover, even if it did, we
would still have the flat statement in Article IV that
"nothing in these articles shall be deemed to contravene
or limit the authority or power of the President.. .." in
extraordinary circumstances. The reading desired by the
defendants is certainly a limitation on the Presidential
authority sought to be imposed by another Article in the
same Charter. Nothing could more clearly contravene
the words of Article IV.
Furthermore, defendants misconstrue the purpose of
Section 1(D)(2)(c) and the SCLC. Article IV draws a
distinction between the promulgation and the
enforcement of regulations concerning student conduct.
Promulgation of regulations is obviously the province of
the SCLC. Since enforcement was the province of the
old SJC the President, in replacing the SJC, has used his
enforcement power, not his legislative power. The job of
the SCLC is to draft regulations such as the disruption
policy or the policy on possession of dangerous
weapons. It is the Committee of Fifteen that has
jurisdiction over setting up new institutions on the
campus, and the Committee of Fifteen has been working
for some while to draft a judicial system that can have
the approval of all Stanford constituencies. Hopefully
they will succeed, but if they do not, the President's
power under Article IV remains and is certainly in no
way limited by Section l(D)2(c).
The Founding Grant
The next argument of defendants is based on a 1902
amendment to the University trusts made by Mrs. Jane
Stanford. The amendment relied on by the defendants
states
"It shall be the duty of the Board of Trustees
to make general laws providing for the
government of the University and to provide
for just and equitable rules of discipline."
It is the argument of the defendants that the Campus

Spacc paid for by University Relations

Judicial Panel does not provide a "just and equitable"
system of discipline. This argument is not founded on
the procedures of the CJP, or upon the denial of any
particular right to defendants before the CJP. This
argument reasons that because the Legislative and
Judicial Charter was "created by the joint approval of
the student referendum, the Academic Council and the
President . . . , it was then seen as necessary to have such
a tripartite agreement to assure just and equitable rules
of discipline." In other words defendants argue that, the
rules of the CJP itself must not only be just and
equitable but the method of arriving at them must be
just and equitable as well. Defendants argue further that
the only just and equitable method of arriving at rules is
by having the rules approved by the University's three
main constituencies.
There are many problems, however, with this
reasoning. First, the trust amendment refers to the rules
themselves, not the method of arriving at them, and
there is no argument that the rules of the CJP do not fall
within the general terms of "just and equitable."
Second, even if we were to interpret the trust
amendment as providing that the rules must be arrived at
is a just and equitable manner, there was certainly no
hint in 1902 when the amendment was made that this
meant participation by students. Admittedly there are
many good reasons for why students should have
decision-making authority in many areas of University
life. The concept, however, that student power be
exercised in a particular manner, a tripartite agreement,
rather than through the appearance of randomly selected
students on the Campus Judicial Panel — does not
follow.
Next, we must remember that the students did
approve the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968
including Article IV which recognized the power of the
President to do just what he has done here.
Finally, if further student power must be found in
the establishment of the CJP, there was inherent in the
SJC a student power to destroy that institution. The use
of that power is why we are where we are today.
The Effect of Extraordinary Circumstances
The final argument that defendants make is the one
that has given us the most difficulty. Essentially, it
asserts that the President's residual authority in
extraordinary circumstances can only be used to meet
those circumstances. The defendants argue that the
President's residual authority could only be used to set
up an institution as much like the defunct SJC as
possible. In other words, if the refusal of the Student
Senate had caused the lack of student members, the
President could only appoint student members to the
selection committee; perhaps, alternatively, to appoint
the students directly to the SJC itself; or, conceivably,
to have randomly selected students chosen for one or
the other position. This argument has a considerable
appeal since it is much easier to modify existing
institutions than to set up wholly new ones. This
argument, however, involves serious problems. First,
nowhere in the Legislative and Judicial Charter, or any
other document which binds the President, is such a
restriction placed on his Article IV power.
Moreover, the number and possible means by which
the President could create systems arguably "as much as
possible like the SJC" is so large that it is difficult to lay
down standards by which his choice might be judged
especially inasmuch as this decision could be made only
after the fact by the judicial pody - presumably after
considerable effort, energy and time had gone into
litigation before it.
Nevertheless, we hold that the Presidents' Article IV
power could only have been used in a reasonable
response to the extraordinary circumstances which faced
him. This, however, does not help the defendants
because the crisis which the President faced when he set
up the CJP, though triggered by the failure of the
Student Senate to make its appointments, was
considerable broader than the mere lack of student
members on the SJC selection committee.
The Situation in Mid-November
In mid-November of this academic year, when the
Student Senate for the first time announced that it
would refuse to appoint its members to the slection
committee for the SJC, the President was clearly
confronted by an "extraordinary circumstance" within
the meaning of Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter. The SJC then was dead, and the President quite
rightly regarded it as a matter of some importance to set
up a substitute body. Unfortunately, the Student Senate
had not only refused to appoint its members to the
selection committee, it and its predecessor had
previously failed to appoint them for approximately
eight months from the time the appointment would have
been made in the normal course of Business. During this
eight month period, the President had personally and
through intermediaries urged again and again that the
student members of the SJC selection committee be
appointed. By the time he was finally refused, (and the
situation was in doubt until the very last evening) a
substantial backlog of cases had built up for the new
SJC. The argument can be made that what the President
should have done was to appoint the student members in
April so that the new SJC could have been formed on
time. We arc convinced, however, that had he dones so,
he would have incurred every bit as much, if not more
criticism on the campus for being precipious than he
now has for having delayed too long. The President
studiously and carefully maintained the view that he
would do nothing whatever to jeopardize the SJC,
although the backlog continued to build up until the time
of the final Senate refusal, it had reached sixteen cases -
twice as many as the SJC had been able to adjudicate in
the entire previous year. We, nonetheless, cannot say
that the President's attitude and actions were wrong in
any respect.
In any event, when the time came for the President
finally to act. he was confronted with the situation far
worse than the sudden disappearance of the SJC. We
cannot ignore the obvious fact that the SJC, even under
the best conditions, could not keep up with its calendar
of cases, and certainly had the President ignored the
Student Senate action and constituted the SJC himself,
the conditions would not have been at their best, so far
as the cooperation of at least some of the student body
was concerned. Indeed, it is likely that even had the
Student Senate appointed its members, the SJC would
shortly have fallen because of its inability to handle its
caseload. It is far more likely that, with the backlog of
cases that had accumulated and the additional doubts as
to its legitimacy among the student body, the

reconstituted SJC would have failed even more quickly.
The very idea of a nine member body both deciding
questions of fact and their own rules of evidence in open
hearing raises so many problems of time and of
complexity that it is frankly quite surprising that the
SJC lasted as long as it did. We are convinced that the
President could consider this in setting up a new body,
the need for whose existence was very clearly not of his
making and in a situation which certainly constituted
"extraordinary circumstances" within the meaning of
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter.
The Structure of the CJP
This decision has two facets. First we consider the
structure of the CJP and second, the rights it affords to
defendants. So far as the structure of the CJP is
concerned, the major difference from the old SJC is the
CJP's use of hearing examiners to find the facts. First of
all, it should be pointed ut that there is nothing
intrinsically unfair to a student defendant in the use of a
hearing examiner as compared to the SJC's deciding the
facts of the case. It is true that where a hearing examiner
sits, no students help determine the facts. On the other
hand, however, faculty members do not sit to determine
the facts either — as they did on the SJC where they had
a majority.
Not only that, but the CJP defendant has a right to
move to disqualify the hearing examiner, a procedure
that was more than merely impracticable when dealing
with the whole SJC' In fact, in one case under the CJP
the chairman informed the defendant that he was.
Jr
prepared to disqualify the hearing examiner who knew a
prosecution witness — but the defense in that case\
refrained from making a motion to disqualify the£
examiner — as has every other defendant. Finally, as far
as we can tell at present, the percentage of acquittals
before the hearing examiners is at least as great, if not
greater, than before the SJC.
The use of hearing examiners is a standard
administrative practice, often handling issues as
important to the litigants as those adjudicated by the
SJC and now the CJP. It is not in equity that the CJP
hearing examiner system differs from that of the old SJC
structure but rather in the saving of time caused by
having one person rather than nine hear the facts of a
case and the additional fairness in having a dispassionate
attorney unconnected with campus issues decide the
facts. In the recent proceeding against Prof. Franklin
before The Advisory Board, criticism was directed
against the method of fact finding on the ground that
the Board was "to close" to the campus and was
personally knowledgeable about the issues. The hearing
examiner system is an effort to meet this problem. The
hearing examiners, though appointed by the President,
are in fact selected by a committee of law professors
appointed by the Dean of the Law School and having no
other connection with campus discipline.
Aside from the use of hearing officers, the remainder
of the structure of the CJP is strikingly similar to that of
the SJC. Where the SJC consisted of four students, four
faculty and a chairman from the law faculty, the CJP
consists of three students, three faculty and a chairman
also from the law faculty. We cannot see any decrease in
fairness because of this and we have already noticed in
our own operations that the difficulty of scheduling
meetings rises exponentially with increasing numbers on
the judicial body.
It is true also that the CJP results are technically in
the form of a recommendation to the President.
However this was equally true of the SJC. (Indeed this
was one of the major complaints of the Student Senate
in destroying the SJC). Not only is this required clearly
by University (and perhaps the outside civil) law, but
whatever political constraints actually separated during
the existence of the SJC which prevented the President
on any occasion from increasing a penalty which the SJC
had found, presumably act equally in the case of the
CJP.
The final complaint as to the structure of the CJP is
that certain decisions are made by the CJP without
hearing witnesses in person but rather only upon the
report of the hearing officer, the motivational
statements of the defendant, argument of counsel, and
written statements as to the relatively few factual
matters that can be in dispute before the CJP itself (as
distinguished of course, from the hearing officer). In
part this restriction on oral testimony as to facts before
the CJP was intended to prevent the prosecutor from
raising objections to the defense use of affidavits,
character reference letters, and the like. The restriction
also, however, recognizes that any taking of oral
testimony (aside from the motivational statement of the
defendant himself — which is guaranteed both by the
rules of the CJP and SJC) involves fact-finding by a
multiple member body and leads to the enormous
problems of time consumption and confusion of issues
that plagued the SJC. The fact is that if any serious
factual issues are disputed, the CJP has jurisdiction to
remand a case to the hearing officer for further fact
finding. The major issues that the CJP itself hears, such
as justification, severity of sentence and fairness, raise
difficult questions of law but do not raise serious factual
dispute.
The Rights of CJP Defendants
Apart from the reasonable explanations of the
structural differences between the CJP and the old SJC,
it should be noted that the legal rights of the student
defendant are virtually the same before both bodies.
Defendants go i lto considerable effort in their brief in
an attempt to show that, in fact, students have fewer
rights under the CJP than they had under the old SJC.
Most of their complaints, however, center on point s they
consider to be unclear and their main argument is that
the CJP may violate these rights. Our decision today
makes it quite clear that we expect in all matters
involving the civil liberties of students to respect
essentially the same rights as they had undr the SJC as
well as under "the Bill of Rights" of the ASSU
constitution (Article IV, Section 2).
So far as the latter document is concerned there are
only two rights in the ASSU constitution which seem in
any way to be unmet by the CJP procedures. The first is
the right of the student "to be assured that, unless the
defendant asks for an an open hearing, any matters of
facts which would tend to identify the person or persons
involved in the case would be kept confidential". The
CJP gives the Chairman the discretion to open such a
hearing without a student's consent. The present
Chairman lias stated that except in some kind of
extraordinary circumstance, which he cannot
contemplate and which presumably the ASSU
constitution could not contemplate either, he will not
exercise his discretion to open a hearing. We feel that
this resolves that problem and we trust that the
Chairman's successors will feel bound by this pledge.
The only other right guaranteed in the ASSU
constitution with which the CJP might seem to have
power to interfere is the right "to have an open
hearing." "An open hearing" surely means a hearing that
is not "closed," in the sense in which a defendant might
ask for a closed hearing to maintain confidentiality (see
LJC Article II F6, which makes this meaning explicit).
An open hearing, therefore, is a hearing which is not
secret: one whose proceedings can in some reasonable
way be observed or inspected by everyone. A normal,
and sufficient, condition for openness is the admission
of the media KZSU, Daily reporters, etc.
An "open hearing" in the colloquial sense of a
hearing any member of the community may attend is
not a right of the defendant. On the contrary, it is at
most a courtesy the CJP arguably owes the community,
unless extending that courtesy is found to be
incompatible with maintaining the minimum of order
and freedom from intimidation that are requisite for any
fair judicial proceeding. We are confident that this is
what both the SJC rule and the ASSU constitution
meant. The CJP "Procedures" (Section 6) do not speak
of an "open hearing" but of a hearing being, or not

being, "open to the public," and so do not even address
the question of an "open hearing" in the legally
important sense. This sense clearly must be covered. We
pledge that any defendant who desires an "open
hearing." ie.. a non-secret hearing, shall have one.
There are numerous other arguments that the defense
makes as to rights which are denied them under the CJP
proceeding. Defendants attorney, for instance, state:
"The subpoena power of the university
prosecutor is also apparently increased as
evidenced by the conduct in the Rafael Robles
hearing where a student was threatened with
disciplinary action for refusal to testify. . . ."
II indeed this were so, it would be a very serious matter.
In lact, so lar as we can determine, the event simply did
not happen. The student was never threatened with
disciplinary action for failure to testify. Indeed, he was
told that il lie was not willing to testify the case would
be dismissed before he was ever called (apparently he
was an essential witness to the prosecution's case.) In
tact, he did testily though he was obviously ambivalent
about doing so. (In any event, the hearing officer found
for the defense on that issue.)
In short, we find the civil rights of Stanford students
are in practice not abridged under the CJP rules and
procedures as here interpreted. The CJP dispite its
ditterent structure atfords at least equal rights as those
allorded by the SJC and meets all of the rights granted

Space pr id for by University Relations

to students in Article IV Seciton 2 of the ASSU
constitution.
Conclusion
The CJP is of course a body brought into existence
by extraordinary circumstances. We, more than almost
all other members of the community, would like it
replaced by a product of the Committee of Fifteen
which can be approved by all three University
Constituencies. Until this happens and regretably it
may be a long wait until consensus takes hold on the
campus - we unanimously hold that the CJP is a legal
and legitimate institution.

SEPARATE OPINION OF MARK EVANS AND JOHN
KAPLAN
We two formally have no vote in this case. One of us
is an alternate member, appointed to the Panel to sit in
case of unavailability or disqualification of one of the
student members; the other is the chairman, who has no
vote except in case of a lie. Nonetheless, in this separate
opinion, we wish to state our concurrence with the
unanimous opinion of those voting, and to make it clear
that we will act accordingly should our votes be required
on this issue.
This is a somewhat unusual proceeding and regretably
we have relatively little precedent to guide us in our
decision. Nonetheless the issue presented here - the
basic legality of the Campus Judicial Panel - is an
important one which must be decided.
Our Jurisdiction to Decide This Case
The University Administration has argued that we do
not have jurisdiction to decide our own legality since
this question of law can be decided in the first instance
only by the President of the University and, in the
second instance, by the civil courts, should a student
bring suit there alleging that his legal rights were
violated. On the other hand, as members of the CJP, we
are responsible for our own actions, and if we have been
asked by the President to participate in any illegal
enterprise, we have a very simple duty not to do so.
Moreover, if we were to participate in disciplining a
student who claims that we are without authority to
discipline him, that student could, under our rule 18,
bring a charge before us that he had been improperly
disciplined. In hearing such a charge we would in effect
be obliged to make a judgment on our own legitimacy,
(i.e., we would have to rule whether we are in fact "the
judicial system in effect," in the language of section IB
of our Procedures.) And if we could under our rules have
an obligation to make such a judgment, clearly we must
have the authority to make this judgment, if we have
any authority at all.
It is true that the problem of the remedy for an
illegally constituted CJP is a subtle one. If we were to
hand down an opinion seeking to bind our successors to
the illegality of the CJP, we would be exercising a
jurisdiction which we have disclaimed. It is possible that
the proper course of action to remedy an illegally
constituted CJP would simply be our resignations. In
any event, we need not decide this difficult question
because we have examined at great length the arguments
of the defendants and conclude that the CJP is legally
constituted under University "law".
The Basis of the CJP
We will begin with the theory under which the CJP is
constituted; then we will move on to discuss our reasons
for rejecting each of the several grounds under which the
defendants would have us hold this body illegal.
The CJP purports to be set up under the President's
"Residual Authority" contained in Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968, a charter which
was approved by the three major constituencies of the
University, the Student Body, the Faculty, and the
Administration. Article IV provides:
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority
and power of the President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing student conduct
at Stanford University, except in extraordinary
circumstances the SCLC and SJC shall have
primary responsibility for promulgating such
regulations and adjudicating violations thereof.
In short, Article IV binds the President to use the SJC
except in "extraordinary circumstances." In
extraordinary circumstances, however, the President
gnay "enforce regulations governing student conduct"
It is the President's theory that extraordinary
circumstances existed when the Student Senate, over a
period of some eight months, at first failed, and then
refused, to appoint the student members to the SJC
selection committee which would select the student
participants to bring the SJC into existence for that
year. We need not go into the rights and wrongs of the
Student Senate action. It has been defended before us as
merely a technique of exerting pressure upon the
President to do things that were morally or legally
correct. Regardless of its justification, it certainly
amounted to "extraordinary circumstances" within the
meaning of Article IV and hence gave the President the
power to set up a different judicial system.
This is not to say that the President was free to set up
a system that was intrinsically irrational or unfair. Aside
from any legal impediments to his power — which we
will discuss later - the fact is that within the University
community there are political checks upon the
President's power. In part, the students and, perhaps to a
greater extent, the faculty do exert influence in this type
of decision. Otherwise, it would be hard to see why any
chief executive officer would, if completely
unconstrained, set up a system as elaborate as the CJP
simply to do what he thought was correct. In any event,
we need not deal with that issue because the defendants
do not claim here that there is anything about the rules
or procedures of the CJP that is inherently irrational or
unfair. Their complaints are somewhat different.
The ASSU Constitution
The first major attack upon the legality of the
Campus Judicial Panel is that Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter, on which the CJP is
based,was limitedby Article IV of the ASSU constitution
passed and approved by the trustees and the president
subsequent to the Charter, in 1969. The ASSU
constitution, Article IV, Section 1, provides that
"The association (i.e. the student body] shall
recognize the authority of university judicial
bodies over members of the association only if
those judicial bodies shall have been approved
by two-thirds of those members of the
association voting in a general election."
It is the contention of the defendants that these words
which were accepted by the Trustees and President,
constitute a limitation on the President's power under
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter. We
disagree.
To be sure the words of the ASSU constitution on
their face support the defendants' position. When one
looks at the question somewhat more closely, however,
one finds insurmountable problems in accepting the
defendants reasoning.
First, it is clear that the President and Trustees did
not think they had given up any of the President's
residual power under Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter. Indeed, the residual authority of the
President has been vigorously defended by the Trustees
and President essentially since the very beginning of the
University and Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter was simply a recognition of this. To argue that
the Trustees and the President of the University had
agreed to place restrictions on this power without any
Qualifications for emereencies. extraordinary

circumstances or the like, qualifications appearing in
every other limitation of the Presidential power, is to ask
us to believe more than we can. This is especially true
since the consequence of accepting this argument is
that no judicial body at all could be established to
replace the defunct SJC unless it could muster a
two-thirds vote of the students. This might well leave the
University permanently without any means of enforcing
discipline on the campus - a result that no constituency
of the University has supported.
Secondly, the ASSU constitution, as a whole, was
obviously not intended to affect student rights with
respect to those of any other constituency of the
University. A constitution is an allocation of power
within a constituency, and here the constituency was the
student body. The provision requiring a two-thirds vote
of the student body simply determines how the student
body can exercise what power it holds under other
university arrangements; it does not increase the power
of the student body by giving it (indeed, one student
more than one third of those voting) any additional
power which, as a constituency, the students did not
have before Article IV of the ASSU constitution. The
ASSU constitution has the effect of making clear what
was not clear earlier — that is if the student constituency
were asked to approve any judicial body, a simple
majority vote would not be sufficient. The CJP is
founded on an entirely different provision of University
law, the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968 and no
allocation of power and competence within any one
constituency can change this.
This is especially clear in this case since one of the
major constituencies of the University, the Faculty, is
completely ignored by the defense's reading of Article
IV of the ASSU constitution. The Faculty was a party to
the Legislative and Judicial Charter, and had a
continuing interest in that Charter. It had voted for the
President's Article IV power and cannot now be told
that, without any notice to it, an agreement between the
students and the President had changed the rules it had
adopted.
The Academic Senate had already adhered to this
view in acknowledging the legitimacy of the Campus
Judicial Panel. In its resolution of February 17, 1972,
(published in Campus Reports February 23, page 2,
Senate Report (No. 9) the Academic Senate requested
"the prompt prosecution [of certain cases] through
appropriate judicial mechanisms including the Campus
Judicial Panel." The legislative history of this resolution
makes its meaning clear. It was pointed out that the
wording prejudged the legitimacy of the CJP, which had
not yet been authoritatively decided. Despite this, the
resolution carried by a vote of 36 to 1, with three
abstentions. Indeed had the President and the student
body purported to limit Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, they might be in breach of
contract with the faculty.
The conclusion that the ASSU constitution was never
intended as a restriction upon the residual authority of
the President is buttressed by the actions of the Student
Senate itself. It is conceded that the Student Senate, in
refusing to make its appointments to the selection
committee for the SJC, had contemplated that the
President would set up another judicial body. Despite
this so far as we can tell, there was no hint of any
argument by anyone at the time that the ASSU
constitution (as distinguished from all sorts of principles
of fairness or political rights) would prevent the
President from doing this. We must note that the ASSU
constitution was adopted in 1969 within the memory of
many of those presently in the Student Senate. Their
silence on this issue, at a time when it would have been
most relevant, speaks volumes on the intent of the ASSU
Framers.
The Legislative and Judicial Charter
The next argument of the defendants is that the CJP
is illegally constituted because of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter itself. It is the theory of the defendants
that Section I(DX2X C ) of that Charter requires the
President "to go first to the SCLC to get his proposals
through". Section 1(D)(2)(c) provides as follows:
Interim regulations promulgated under Section
1(2) shall expire 90 days after publication
unless within that period the SCLC has taken
steps to promulgate a regulation in the same
area under the procedure specified in Section
D(l), in which case the interim regulation may
remain in effect until the conclusion of the
Section D(l) procedure.
It seems to us the subsection simply does not say what
the defendants contend. Moreover, even if it did, we
would still have the flat statement in Article IV that
"nothing in these articles shall be deemed to contravene
or limit the authority or power of the President.. .." in
extraordinary circumstances. The reading desired by the
defendants is certainly a limitation on the Presidential
authority sought to be imposed by another Article in the
same Charter. Nothing could more clearly contravene
the words of Article IV.
Furthermore, defendants misconstrue the purpose of
Section 1(D)(2)(c) and the SCLC. Article IV draws a
distinction between the promulgation and the
enforcement of regulations concerning student conduct.
Promulgation of regulations is obviously the province of
the SCLC. Since enforcement was the province of the
old SJC the President, in replacing the SJC, has used his
enforcement power, not his legislative power. The job of
the SCLC is to draft regulations such as the disruption
policy or the policy on possession of dangerous
weapons. It is the Committee of Fifteen that has
jurisdiction over setting up new institutions on the
campus, and the Committee of Fifteen has been working
for some while to draft a judicial system that can have
the approval of all Stanford constituencies. Hopefully
they will succeed, but if they do not, the President's
power under Article IV remains and is certainly in no
way limited by Section l(D)2(c).
The Founding Grant
The next argument of defendants is based on a 1902
amendment to the University trusts made by Mrs. Jane
Stanford. The amendment relied on by the defendants
states
"It shall be the duty of the Board of Trustees
to make general laws providing for the
government of the University and to provide
for just and equitable rules of discipline."
It is the argument of the defendants that the Campus

Spacc paid for by University Relations

Judicial Panel does not provide a "just and equitable"
system of discipline. This argument is not founded on
the procedures of the CJP, or upon the denial of any
particular right to defendants before the CJP. This
argument reasons that because the Legislative and
Judicial Charter was "created by the joint approval of
the student referendum, the Academic Council and the
President . . . , it was then seen as necessary to have such
a tripartite agreement to assure just and equitable rules
of discipline." In other words defendants argue that, the
rules of the CJP itself must not only be just and
equitable but the method of arriving at them must be
just and equitable as well. Defendants argue further that
the only just and equitable method of arriving at rules is
by having the rules approved by the University's three
main constituencies.
There are many problems, however, with this
reasoning. First, the trust amendment refers to the rules
themselves, not the method of arriving at them, and
there is no argument that the rules of the CJP do not fall
within the general terms of "just and equitable."
Second, even if we were to interpret the trust
amendment as providing that the rules must be arrived at
is a just and equitable manner, there was certainly no
hint in 1902 when the amendment was made that this
meant participation by students. Admittedly there are
many good reasons for why students should have
decision-making authority in many areas of University
life. The concept, however, that student power be
exercised in a particular manner, a tripartite agreement,
rather than through the appearance of randomly selected
students on the Campus Judicial Panel — does not
follow.
Next, we must remember that the students did
approve the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968
including Article IV which recognized the power of the
President to do just what he has done here.
Finally, if further student power must be found in
the establishment of the CJP, there was inherent in the
SJC a student power to destroy that institution. The use
of that power is why we are where we are today.
The Effect of Extraordinary Circumstances
The final argument that defendants make is the one
that has given us the most difficulty. Essentially, it
asserts that the President's residual authority in
extraordinary circumstances can only be used to meet
those circumstances. The defendants argue that the
President's residual authority could only be used to set
up an institution as much like the defunct SJC as
possible. In other words, if the refusal of the Student
Senate had caused the lack of student members, the
President could only appoint student members to the
selection committee; perhaps, alternatively, to appoint
the students directly to the SJC itself; or, conceivably,
to have randomly selected students chosen for one or
the other position. This argument has a considerable
appeal since it is much easier to modify existing
institutions than to set up wholly new ones. This
argument, however, involves serious problems. First,
nowhere in the Legislative and Judicial Charter, or any
other document which binds the President, is such a
restriction placed on his Article IV power.
Moreover, the number and possible means by which
the President could create systems arguably "as much as
possible like the SJC" is so large that it is difficult to lay
down standards by which his choice might be judged
especially inasmuch as this decision could be made only
after the fact by the judicial pody - presumably after
considerable effort, energy and time had gone into
litigation before it.
Nevertheless, we hold that the Presidents' Article IV
power could only have been used in a reasonable
response to the extraordinary circumstances which faced
him. This, however, does not help the defendants
because the crisis which the President faced when he set
up the CJP, though triggered by the failure of the
Student Senate to make its appointments, was
considerable broader than the mere lack of student
members on the SJC selection committee.
The Situation in Mid-November
In mid-November of this academic year, when the
Student Senate for the first time announced that it
would refuse to appoint its members to the slection
committee for the SJC, the President was clearly
confronted by an "extraordinary circumstance" within
the meaning of Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter. The SJC then was dead, and the President quite
rightly regarded it as a matter of some importance to set
up a substitute body. Unfortunately, the Student Senate
had not only refused to appoint its members to the
selection committee, it and its predecessor had
previously failed to appoint them for approximately
eight months from the time the appointment would have
been made in the normal course of Business. During this
eight month period, the President had personally and
through intermediaries urged again and again that the
student members of the SJC selection committee be
appointed. By the time he was finally refused, (and the
situation was in doubt until the very last evening) a
substantial backlog of cases had built up for the new
SJC. The argument can be made that what the President
should have done was to appoint the student members in
April so that the new SJC could have been formed on
time. We arc convinced, however, that had he dones so,
he would have incurred every bit as much, if not more
criticism on the campus for being precipious than he
now has for having delayed too long. The President
studiously and carefully maintained the view that he
would do nothing whatever to jeopardize the SJC,
although the backlog continued to build up until the time
of the final Senate refusal, it had reached sixteen cases -
twice as many as the SJC had been able to adjudicate in
the entire previous year. We, nonetheless, cannot say
that the President's attitude and actions were wrong in
any respect.
In any event, when the time came for the President
finally to act. he was confronted with the situation far
worse than the sudden disappearance of the SJC. We
cannot ignore the obvious fact that the SJC, even under
the best conditions, could not keep up with its calendar
of cases, and certainly had the President ignored the
Student Senate action and constituted the SJC himself,
the conditions would not have been at their best, so far
as the cooperation of at least some of the student body
was concerned. Indeed, it is likely that even had the
Student Senate appointed its members, the SJC would
shortly have fallen because of its inability to handle its
caseload. It is far more likely that, with the backlog of
cases that had accumulated and the additional doubts as
to its legitimacy among the student body, the

reconstituted SJC would have failed even more quickly.
The very idea of a nine member body both deciding
questions of fact and their own rules of evidence in open
hearing raises so many problems of time and of
complexity that it is frankly quite surprising that the
SJC lasted as long as it did. We are convinced that the
President could consider this in setting up a new body,
the need for whose existence was very clearly not of his
making and in a situation which certainly constituted
"extraordinary circumstances" within the meaning of
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter.
The Structure of the CJP
This decision has two facets. First we consider the
structure of the CJP and second, the rights it affords to
defendants. So far as the structure of the CJP is
concerned, the major difference from the old SJC is the
CJP's use of hearing examiners to find the facts. First of
all, it should be pointed ut that there is nothing
intrinsically unfair to a student defendant in the use of a
hearing examiner as compared to the SJC's deciding the
facts of the case. It is true that where a hearing examiner
sits, no students help determine the facts. On the other
hand, however, faculty members do not sit to determine
the facts either — as they did on the SJC where they had
a majority.
Not only that, but the CJP defendant has a right to
move to disqualify the hearing examiner, a procedure
that was more than merely impracticable when dealing
with the whole SJC' In fact, in one case under the CJP
the chairman informed the defendant that he was.
Jr
prepared to disqualify the hearing examiner who knew a
prosecution witness — but the defense in that case\
refrained from making a motion to disqualify the£
examiner — as has every other defendant. Finally, as far
as we can tell at present, the percentage of acquittals
before the hearing examiners is at least as great, if not
greater, than before the SJC.
The use of hearing examiners is a standard
administrative practice, often handling issues as
important to the litigants as those adjudicated by the
SJC and now the CJP. It is not in equity that the CJP
hearing examiner system differs from that of the old SJC
structure but rather in the saving of time caused by
having one person rather than nine hear the facts of a
case and the additional fairness in having a dispassionate
attorney unconnected with campus issues decide the
facts. In the recent proceeding against Prof. Franklin
before The Advisory Board, criticism was directed
against the method of fact finding on the ground that
the Board was "to close" to the campus and was
personally knowledgeable about the issues. The hearing
examiner system is an effort to meet this problem. The
hearing examiners, though appointed by the President,
are in fact selected by a committee of law professors
appointed by the Dean of the Law School and having no
other connection with campus discipline.
Aside from the use of hearing officers, the remainder
of the structure of the CJP is strikingly similar to that of
the SJC. Where the SJC consisted of four students, four
faculty and a chairman from the law faculty, the CJP
consists of three students, three faculty and a chairman
also from the law faculty. We cannot see any decrease in
fairness because of this and we have already noticed in
our own operations that the difficulty of scheduling
meetings rises exponentially with increasing numbers on
the judicial body.
It is true also that the CJP results are technically in
the form of a recommendation to the President.
However this was equally true of the SJC. (Indeed this
was one of the major complaints of the Student Senate
in destroying the SJC). Not only is this required clearly
by University (and perhaps the outside civil) law, but
whatever political constraints actually separated during
the existence of the SJC which prevented the President
on any occasion from increasing a penalty which the SJC
had found, presumably act equally in the case of the
CJP.
The final complaint as to the structure of the CJP is
that certain decisions are made by the CJP without
hearing witnesses in person but rather only upon the
report of the hearing officer, the motivational
statements of the defendant, argument of counsel, and
written statements as to the relatively few factual
matters that can be in dispute before the CJP itself (as
distinguished of course, from the hearing officer). In
part this restriction on oral testimony as to facts before
the CJP was intended to prevent the prosecutor from
raising objections to the defense use of affidavits,
character reference letters, and the like. The restriction
also, however, recognizes that any taking of oral
testimony (aside from the motivational statement of the
defendant himself — which is guaranteed both by the
rules of the CJP and SJC) involves fact-finding by a
multiple member body and leads to the enormous
problems of time consumption and confusion of issues
that plagued the SJC. The fact is that if any serious
factual issues are disputed, the CJP has jurisdiction to
remand a case to the hearing officer for further fact
finding. The major issues that the CJP itself hears, such
as justification, severity of sentence and fairness, raise
difficult questions of law but do not raise serious factual
dispute.
The Rights of CJP Defendants
Apart from the reasonable explanations of the
structural differences between the CJP and the old SJC,
it should be noted that the legal rights of the student
defendant are virtually the same before both bodies.
Defendants go i lto considerable effort in their brief in
an attempt to show that, in fact, students have fewer
rights under the CJP than they had under the old SJC.
Most of their complaints, however, center on point s they
consider to be unclear and their main argument is that
the CJP may violate these rights. Our decision today
makes it quite clear that we expect in all matters
involving the civil liberties of students to respect
essentially the same rights as they had undr the SJC as
well as under "the Bill of Rights" of the ASSU
constitution (Article IV, Section 2).
So far as the latter document is concerned there are
only two rights in the ASSU constitution which seem in
any way to be unmet by the CJP procedures. The first is
the right of the student "to be assured that, unless the
defendant asks for an an open hearing, any matters of
facts which would tend to identify the person or persons
involved in the case would be kept confidential". The
CJP gives the Chairman the discretion to open such a
hearing without a student's consent. The present
Chairman lias stated that except in some kind of
extraordinary circumstance, which he cannot
contemplate and which presumably the ASSU
constitution could not contemplate either, he will not
exercise his discretion to open a hearing. We feel that
this resolves that problem and we trust that the
Chairman's successors will feel bound by this pledge.
The only other right guaranteed in the ASSU
constitution with which the CJP might seem to have
power to interfere is the right "to have an open
hearing." "An open hearing" surely means a hearing that
is not "closed," in the sense in which a defendant might
ask for a closed hearing to maintain confidentiality (see
LJC Article II F6, which makes this meaning explicit).
An open hearing, therefore, is a hearing which is not
secret: one whose proceedings can in some reasonable
way be observed or inspected by everyone. A normal,
and sufficient, condition for openness is the admission
of the media KZSU, Daily reporters, etc.
An "open hearing" in the colloquial sense of a
hearing any member of the community may attend is
not a right of the defendant. On the contrary, it is at
most a courtesy the CJP arguably owes the community,
unless extending that courtesy is found to be
incompatible with maintaining the minimum of order
and freedom from intimidation that are requisite for any
fair judicial proceeding. We are confident that this is
what both the SJC rule and the ASSU constitution
meant. The CJP "Procedures" (Section 6) do not speak
of an "open hearing" but of a hearing being, or not

being, "open to the public," and so do not even address
the question of an "open hearing" in the legally
important sense. This sense clearly must be covered. We
pledge that any defendant who desires an "open
hearing." ie.. a non-secret hearing, shall have one.
There are numerous other arguments that the defense
makes as to rights which are denied them under the CJP
proceeding. Defendants attorney, for instance, state:
"The subpoena power of the university
prosecutor is also apparently increased as
evidenced by the conduct in the Rafael Robles
hearing where a student was threatened with
disciplinary action for refusal to testify. . . ."
II indeed this were so, it would be a very serious matter.
In lact, so lar as we can determine, the event simply did
not happen. The student was never threatened with
disciplinary action for failure to testify. Indeed, he was
told that il lie was not willing to testify the case would
be dismissed before he was ever called (apparently he
was an essential witness to the prosecution's case.) In
tact, he did testily though he was obviously ambivalent
about doing so. (In any event, the hearing officer found
for the defense on that issue.)
In short, we find the civil rights of Stanford students
are in practice not abridged under the CJP rules and
procedures as here interpreted. The CJP dispite its
ditterent structure atfords at least equal rights as those
allorded by the SJC and meets all of the rights granted

Space pr id for by University Relations

to students in Article IV Seciton 2 of the ASSU
constitution.
Conclusion
The CJP is of course a body brought into existence
by extraordinary circumstances. We, more than almost
all other members of the community, would like it
replaced by a product of the Committee of Fifteen
which can be approved by all three University
Constituencies. Until this happens and regretably it
may be a long wait until consensus takes hold on the
campus - we unanimously hold that the CJP is a legal
and legitimate institution.

SEPARATE OPINION OF MARK EVANS AND JOHN
KAPLAN
We two formally have no vote in this case. One of us
is an alternate member, appointed to the Panel to sit in
case of unavailability or disqualification of one of the
student members; the other is the chairman, who has no
vote except in case of a lie. Nonetheless, in this separate
opinion, we wish to state our concurrence with the
unanimous opinion of those voting, and to make it clear
that we will act accordingly should our votes be required
on this issue.
This is a somewhat unusual proceeding and regretably
we have relatively little precedent to guide us in our
decision. Nonetheless the issue presented here - the
basic legality of the Campus Judicial Panel - is an
important one which must be decided.
Our Jurisdiction to Decide This Case
The University Administration has argued that we do
not have jurisdiction to decide our own legality since
this question of law can be decided in the first instance
only by the President of the University and, in the
second instance, by the civil courts, should a student
bring suit there alleging that his legal rights were
violated. On the other hand, as members of the CJP, we
are responsible for our own actions, and if we have been
asked by the President to participate in any illegal
enterprise, we have a very simple duty not to do so.
Moreover, if we were to participate in disciplining a
student who claims that we are without authority to
discipline him, that student could, under our rule 18,
bring a charge before us that he had been improperly
disciplined. In hearing such a charge we would in effect
be obliged to make a judgment on our own legitimacy,
(i.e., we would have to rule whether we are in fact "the
judicial system in effect," in the language of section IB
of our Procedures.) And if we could under our rules have
an obligation to make such a judgment, clearly we must
have the authority to make this judgment, if we have
any authority at all.
It is true that the problem of the remedy for an
illegally constituted CJP is a subtle one. If we were to
hand down an opinion seeking to bind our successors to
the illegality of the CJP, we would be exercising a
jurisdiction which we have disclaimed. It is possible that
the proper course of action to remedy an illegally
constituted CJP would simply be our resignations. In
any event, we need not decide this difficult question
because we have examined at great length the arguments
of the defendants and conclude that the CJP is legally
constituted under University "law".
The Basis of the CJP
We will begin with the theory under which the CJP is
constituted; then we will move on to discuss our reasons
for rejecting each of the several grounds under which the
defendants would have us hold this body illegal.
The CJP purports to be set up under the President's
"Residual Authority" contained in Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968, a charter which
was approved by the three major constituencies of the
University, the Student Body, the Faculty, and the
Administration. Article IV provides:
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority
and power of the President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing student conduct
at Stanford University, except in extraordinary
circumstances the SCLC and SJC shall have
primary responsibility for promulgating such
regulations and adjudicating violations thereof.
In short, Article IV binds the President to use the SJC
except in "extraordinary circumstances." In
extraordinary circumstances, however, the President
gnay "enforce regulations governing student conduct"
It is the President's theory that extraordinary
circumstances existed when the Student Senate, over a
period of some eight months, at first failed, and then
refused, to appoint the student members to the SJC
selection committee which would select the student
participants to bring the SJC into existence for that
year. We need not go into the rights and wrongs of the
Student Senate action. It has been defended before us as
merely a technique of exerting pressure upon the
President to do things that were morally or legally
correct. Regardless of its justification, it certainly
amounted to "extraordinary circumstances" within the
meaning of Article IV and hence gave the President the
power to set up a different judicial system.
This is not to say that the President was free to set up
a system that was intrinsically irrational or unfair. Aside
from any legal impediments to his power — which we
will discuss later - the fact is that within the University
community there are political checks upon the
President's power. In part, the students and, perhaps to a
greater extent, the faculty do exert influence in this type
of decision. Otherwise, it would be hard to see why any
chief executive officer would, if completely
unconstrained, set up a system as elaborate as the CJP
simply to do what he thought was correct. In any event,
we need not deal with that issue because the defendants
do not claim here that there is anything about the rules
or procedures of the CJP that is inherently irrational or
unfair. Their complaints are somewhat different.
The ASSU Constitution
The first major attack upon the legality of the
Campus Judicial Panel is that Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter, on which the CJP is
based,was limitedby Article IV of the ASSU constitution
passed and approved by the trustees and the president
subsequent to the Charter, in 1969. The ASSU
constitution, Article IV, Section 1, provides that
"The association (i.e. the student body] shall
recognize the authority of university judicial
bodies over members of the association only if
those judicial bodies shall have been approved
by two-thirds of those members of the
association voting in a general election."
It is the contention of the defendants that these words
which were accepted by the Trustees and President,
constitute a limitation on the President's power under
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter. We
disagree.
To be sure the words of the ASSU constitution on
their face support the defendants' position. When one
looks at the question somewhat more closely, however,
one finds insurmountable problems in accepting the
defendants reasoning.
First, it is clear that the President and Trustees did
not think they had given up any of the President's
residual power under Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter. Indeed, the residual authority of the
President has been vigorously defended by the Trustees
and President essentially since the very beginning of the
University and Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter was simply a recognition of this. To argue that
the Trustees and the President of the University had
agreed to place restrictions on this power without any
Qualifications for emereencies. extraordinary

circumstances or the like, qualifications appearing in
every other limitation of the Presidential power, is to ask
us to believe more than we can. This is especially true
since the consequence of accepting this argument is
that no judicial body at all could be established to
replace the defunct SJC unless it could muster a
two-thirds vote of the students. This might well leave the
University permanently without any means of enforcing
discipline on the campus - a result that no constituency
of the University has supported.
Secondly, the ASSU constitution, as a whole, was
obviously not intended to affect student rights with
respect to those of any other constituency of the
University. A constitution is an allocation of power
within a constituency, and here the constituency was the
student body. The provision requiring a two-thirds vote
of the student body simply determines how the student
body can exercise what power it holds under other
university arrangements; it does not increase the power
of the student body by giving it (indeed, one student
more than one third of those voting) any additional
power which, as a constituency, the students did not
have before Article IV of the ASSU constitution. The
ASSU constitution has the effect of making clear what
was not clear earlier — that is if the student constituency
were asked to approve any judicial body, a simple
majority vote would not be sufficient. The CJP is
founded on an entirely different provision of University
law, the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968 and no
allocation of power and competence within any one
constituency can change this.
This is especially clear in this case since one of the
major constituencies of the University, the Faculty, is
completely ignored by the defense's reading of Article
IV of the ASSU constitution. The Faculty was a party to
the Legislative and Judicial Charter, and had a
continuing interest in that Charter. It had voted for the
President's Article IV power and cannot now be told
that, without any notice to it, an agreement between the
students and the President had changed the rules it had
adopted.
The Academic Senate had already adhered to this
view in acknowledging the legitimacy of the Campus
Judicial Panel. In its resolution of February 17, 1972,
(published in Campus Reports February 23, page 2,
Senate Report (No. 9) the Academic Senate requested
"the prompt prosecution [of certain cases] through
appropriate judicial mechanisms including the Campus
Judicial Panel." The legislative history of this resolution
makes its meaning clear. It was pointed out that the
wording prejudged the legitimacy of the CJP, which had
not yet been authoritatively decided. Despite this, the
resolution carried by a vote of 36 to 1, with three
abstentions. Indeed had the President and the student
body purported to limit Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, they might be in breach of
contract with the faculty.
The conclusion that the ASSU constitution was never
intended as a restriction upon the residual authority of
the President is buttressed by the actions of the Student
Senate itself. It is conceded that the Student Senate, in
refusing to make its appointments to the selection
committee for the SJC, had contemplated that the
President would set up another judicial body. Despite
this so far as we can tell, there was no hint of any
argument by anyone at the time that the ASSU
constitution (as distinguished from all sorts of principles
of fairness or political rights) would prevent the
President from doing this. We must note that the ASSU
constitution was adopted in 1969 within the memory of
many of those presently in the Student Senate. Their
silence on this issue, at a time when it would have been
most relevant, speaks volumes on the intent of the ASSU
Framers.
The Legislative and Judicial Charter
The next argument of the defendants is that the CJP
is illegally constituted because of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter itself. It is the theory of the defendants
that Section I(DX2X C ) of that Charter requires the
President "to go first to the SCLC to get his proposals
through". Section 1(D)(2)(c) provides as follows:
Interim regulations promulgated under Section
1(2) shall expire 90 days after publication
unless within that period the SCLC has taken
steps to promulgate a regulation in the same
area under the procedure specified in Section
D(l), in which case the interim regulation may
remain in effect until the conclusion of the
Section D(l) procedure.
It seems to us the subsection simply does not say what
the defendants contend. Moreover, even if it did, we
would still have the flat statement in Article IV that
"nothing in these articles shall be deemed to contravene
or limit the authority or power of the President.. .." in
extraordinary circumstances. The reading desired by the
defendants is certainly a limitation on the Presidential
authority sought to be imposed by another Article in the
same Charter. Nothing could more clearly contravene
the words of Article IV.
Furthermore, defendants misconstrue the purpose of
Section 1(D)(2)(c) and the SCLC. Article IV draws a
distinction between the promulgation and the
enforcement of regulations concerning student conduct.
Promulgation of regulations is obviously the province of
the SCLC. Since enforcement was the province of the
old SJC the President, in replacing the SJC, has used his
enforcement power, not his legislative power. The job of
the SCLC is to draft regulations such as the disruption
policy or the policy on possession of dangerous
weapons. It is the Committee of Fifteen that has
jurisdiction over setting up new institutions on the
campus, and the Committee of Fifteen has been working
for some while to draft a judicial system that can have
the approval of all Stanford constituencies. Hopefully
they will succeed, but if they do not, the President's
power under Article IV remains and is certainly in no
way limited by Section l(D)2(c).
The Founding Grant
The next argument of defendants is based on a 1902
amendment to the University trusts made by Mrs. Jane
Stanford. The amendment relied on by the defendants
states
"It shall be the duty of the Board of Trustees
to make general laws providing for the
government of the University and to provide
for just and equitable rules of discipline."
It is the argument of the defendants that the Campus

Spacc paid for by University Relations

Judicial Panel does not provide a "just and equitable"
system of discipline. This argument is not founded on
the procedures of the CJP, or upon the denial of any
particular right to defendants before the CJP. This
argument reasons that because the Legislative and
Judicial Charter was "created by the joint approval of
the student referendum, the Academic Council and the
President . . . , it was then seen as necessary to have such
a tripartite agreement to assure just and equitable rules
of discipline." In other words defendants argue that, the
rules of the CJP itself must not only be just and
equitable but the method of arriving at them must be
just and equitable as well. Defendants argue further that
the only just and equitable method of arriving at rules is
by having the rules approved by the University's three
main constituencies.
There are many problems, however, with this
reasoning. First, the trust amendment refers to the rules
themselves, not the method of arriving at them, and
there is no argument that the rules of the CJP do not fall
within the general terms of "just and equitable."
Second, even if we were to interpret the trust
amendment as providing that the rules must be arrived at
is a just and equitable manner, there was certainly no
hint in 1902 when the amendment was made that this
meant participation by students. Admittedly there are
many good reasons for why students should have
decision-making authority in many areas of University
life. The concept, however, that student power be
exercised in a particular manner, a tripartite agreement,
rather than through the appearance of randomly selected
students on the Campus Judicial Panel — does not
follow.
Next, we must remember that the students did
approve the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968
including Article IV which recognized the power of the
President to do just what he has done here.
Finally, if further student power must be found in
the establishment of the CJP, there was inherent in the
SJC a student power to destroy that institution. The use
of that power is why we are where we are today.
The Effect of Extraordinary Circumstances
The final argument that defendants make is the one
that has given us the most difficulty. Essentially, it
asserts that the President's residual authority in
extraordinary circumstances can only be used to meet
those circumstances. The defendants argue that the
President's residual authority could only be used to set
up an institution as much like the defunct SJC as
possible. In other words, if the refusal of the Student
Senate had caused the lack of student members, the
President could only appoint student members to the
selection committee; perhaps, alternatively, to appoint
the students directly to the SJC itself; or, conceivably,
to have randomly selected students chosen for one or
the other position. This argument has a considerable
appeal since it is much easier to modify existing
institutions than to set up wholly new ones. This
argument, however, involves serious problems. First,
nowhere in the Legislative and Judicial Charter, or any
other document which binds the President, is such a
restriction placed on his Article IV power.
Moreover, the number and possible means by which
the President could create systems arguably "as much as
possible like the SJC" is so large that it is difficult to lay
down standards by which his choice might be judged
especially inasmuch as this decision could be made only
after the fact by the judicial pody - presumably after
considerable effort, energy and time had gone into
litigation before it.
Nevertheless, we hold that the Presidents' Article IV
power could only have been used in a reasonable
response to the extraordinary circumstances which faced
him. This, however, does not help the defendants
because the crisis which the President faced when he set
up the CJP, though triggered by the failure of the
Student Senate to make its appointments, was
considerable broader than the mere lack of student
members on the SJC selection committee.
The Situation in Mid-November
In mid-November of this academic year, when the
Student Senate for the first time announced that it
would refuse to appoint its members to the slection
committee for the SJC, the President was clearly
confronted by an "extraordinary circumstance" within
the meaning of Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter. The SJC then was dead, and the President quite
rightly regarded it as a matter of some importance to set
up a substitute body. Unfortunately, the Student Senate
had not only refused to appoint its members to the
selection committee, it and its predecessor had
previously failed to appoint them for approximately
eight months from the time the appointment would have
been made in the normal course of Business. During this
eight month period, the President had personally and
through intermediaries urged again and again that the
student members of the SJC selection committee be
appointed. By the time he was finally refused, (and the
situation was in doubt until the very last evening) a
substantial backlog of cases had built up for the new
SJC. The argument can be made that what the President
should have done was to appoint the student members in
April so that the new SJC could have been formed on
time. We arc convinced, however, that had he dones so,
he would have incurred every bit as much, if not more
criticism on the campus for being precipious than he
now has for having delayed too long. The President
studiously and carefully maintained the view that he
would do nothing whatever to jeopardize the SJC,
although the backlog continued to build up until the time
of the final Senate refusal, it had reached sixteen cases -
twice as many as the SJC had been able to adjudicate in
the entire previous year. We, nonetheless, cannot say
that the President's attitude and actions were wrong in
any respect.
In any event, when the time came for the President
finally to act. he was confronted with the situation far
worse than the sudden disappearance of the SJC. We
cannot ignore the obvious fact that the SJC, even under
the best conditions, could not keep up with its calendar
of cases, and certainly had the President ignored the
Student Senate action and constituted the SJC himself,
the conditions would not have been at their best, so far
as the cooperation of at least some of the student body
was concerned. Indeed, it is likely that even had the
Student Senate appointed its members, the SJC would
shortly have fallen because of its inability to handle its
caseload. It is far more likely that, with the backlog of
cases that had accumulated and the additional doubts as
to its legitimacy among the student body, the

reconstituted SJC would have failed even more quickly.
The very idea of a nine member body both deciding
questions of fact and their own rules of evidence in open
hearing raises so many problems of time and of
complexity that it is frankly quite surprising that the
SJC lasted as long as it did. We are convinced that the
President could consider this in setting up a new body,
the need for whose existence was very clearly not of his
making and in a situation which certainly constituted
"extraordinary circumstances" within the meaning of
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter.
The Structure of the CJP
This decision has two facets. First we consider the
structure of the CJP and second, the rights it affords to
defendants. So far as the structure of the CJP is
concerned, the major difference from the old SJC is the
CJP's use of hearing examiners to find the facts. First of
all, it should be pointed ut that there is nothing
intrinsically unfair to a student defendant in the use of a
hearing examiner as compared to the SJC's deciding the
facts of the case. It is true that where a hearing examiner
sits, no students help determine the facts. On the other
hand, however, faculty members do not sit to determine
the facts either — as they did on the SJC where they had
a majority.
Not only that, but the CJP defendant has a right to
move to disqualify the hearing examiner, a procedure
that was more than merely impracticable when dealing
with the whole SJC' In fact, in one case under the CJP
the chairman informed the defendant that he was.
Jr
prepared to disqualify the hearing examiner who knew a
prosecution witness — but the defense in that case\
refrained from making a motion to disqualify the£
examiner — as has every other defendant. Finally, as far
as we can tell at present, the percentage of acquittals
before the hearing examiners is at least as great, if not
greater, than before the SJC.
The use of hearing examiners is a standard
administrative practice, often handling issues as
important to the litigants as those adjudicated by the
SJC and now the CJP. It is not in equity that the CJP
hearing examiner system differs from that of the old SJC
structure but rather in the saving of time caused by
having one person rather than nine hear the facts of a
case and the additional fairness in having a dispassionate
attorney unconnected with campus issues decide the
facts. In the recent proceeding against Prof. Franklin
before The Advisory Board, criticism was directed
against the method of fact finding on the ground that
the Board was "to close" to the campus and was
personally knowledgeable about the issues. The hearing
examiner system is an effort to meet this problem. The
hearing examiners, though appointed by the President,
are in fact selected by a committee of law professors
appointed by the Dean of the Law School and having no
other connection with campus discipline.
Aside from the use of hearing officers, the remainder
of the structure of the CJP is strikingly similar to that of
the SJC. Where the SJC consisted of four students, four
faculty and a chairman from the law faculty, the CJP
consists of three students, three faculty and a chairman
also from the law faculty. We cannot see any decrease in
fairness because of this and we have already noticed in
our own operations that the difficulty of scheduling
meetings rises exponentially with increasing numbers on
the judicial body.
It is true also that the CJP results are technically in
the form of a recommendation to the President.
However this was equally true of the SJC. (Indeed this
was one of the major complaints of the Student Senate
in destroying the SJC). Not only is this required clearly
by University (and perhaps the outside civil) law, but
whatever political constraints actually separated during
the existence of the SJC which prevented the President
on any occasion from increasing a penalty which the SJC
had found, presumably act equally in the case of the
CJP.
The final complaint as to the structure of the CJP is
that certain decisions are made by the CJP without
hearing witnesses in person but rather only upon the
report of the hearing officer, the motivational
statements of the defendant, argument of counsel, and
written statements as to the relatively few factual
matters that can be in dispute before the CJP itself (as
distinguished of course, from the hearing officer). In
part this restriction on oral testimony as to facts before
the CJP was intended to prevent the prosecutor from
raising objections to the defense use of affidavits,
character reference letters, and the like. The restriction
also, however, recognizes that any taking of oral
testimony (aside from the motivational statement of the
defendant himself — which is guaranteed both by the
rules of the CJP and SJC) involves fact-finding by a
multiple member body and leads to the enormous
problems of time consumption and confusion of issues
that plagued the SJC. The fact is that if any serious
factual issues are disputed, the CJP has jurisdiction to
remand a case to the hearing officer for further fact
finding. The major issues that the CJP itself hears, such
as justification, severity of sentence and fairness, raise
difficult questions of law but do not raise serious factual
dispute.
The Rights of CJP Defendants
Apart from the reasonable explanations of the
structural differences between the CJP and the old SJC,
it should be noted that the legal rights of the student
defendant are virtually the same before both bodies.
Defendants go i lto considerable effort in their brief in
an attempt to show that, in fact, students have fewer
rights under the CJP than they had under the old SJC.
Most of their complaints, however, center on point s they
consider to be unclear and their main argument is that
the CJP may violate these rights. Our decision today
makes it quite clear that we expect in all matters
involving the civil liberties of students to respect
essentially the same rights as they had undr the SJC as
well as under "the Bill of Rights" of the ASSU
constitution (Article IV, Section 2).
So far as the latter document is concerned there are
only two rights in the ASSU constitution which seem in
any way to be unmet by the CJP procedures. The first is
the right of the student "to be assured that, unless the
defendant asks for an an open hearing, any matters of
facts which would tend to identify the person or persons
involved in the case would be kept confidential". The
CJP gives the Chairman the discretion to open such a
hearing without a student's consent. The present
Chairman lias stated that except in some kind of
extraordinary circumstance, which he cannot
contemplate and which presumably the ASSU
constitution could not contemplate either, he will not
exercise his discretion to open a hearing. We feel that
this resolves that problem and we trust that the
Chairman's successors will feel bound by this pledge.
The only other right guaranteed in the ASSU
constitution with which the CJP might seem to have
power to interfere is the right "to have an open
hearing." "An open hearing" surely means a hearing that
is not "closed," in the sense in which a defendant might
ask for a closed hearing to maintain confidentiality (see
LJC Article II F6, which makes this meaning explicit).
An open hearing, therefore, is a hearing which is not
secret: one whose proceedings can in some reasonable
way be observed or inspected by everyone. A normal,
and sufficient, condition for openness is the admission
of the media KZSU, Daily reporters, etc.
An "open hearing" in the colloquial sense of a
hearing any member of the community may attend is
not a right of the defendant. On the contrary, it is at
most a courtesy the CJP arguably owes the community,
unless extending that courtesy is found to be
incompatible with maintaining the minimum of order
and freedom from intimidation that are requisite for any
fair judicial proceeding. We are confident that this is
what both the SJC rule and the ASSU constitution
meant. The CJP "Procedures" (Section 6) do not speak
of an "open hearing" but of a hearing being, or not

being, "open to the public," and so do not even address
the question of an "open hearing" in the legally
important sense. This sense clearly must be covered. We
pledge that any defendant who desires an "open
hearing." ie.. a non-secret hearing, shall have one.
There are numerous other arguments that the defense
makes as to rights which are denied them under the CJP
proceeding. Defendants attorney, for instance, state:
"The subpoena power of the university
prosecutor is also apparently increased as
evidenced by the conduct in the Rafael Robles
hearing where a student was threatened with
disciplinary action for refusal to testify. . . ."
II indeed this were so, it would be a very serious matter.
In lact, so lar as we can determine, the event simply did
not happen. The student was never threatened with
disciplinary action for failure to testify. Indeed, he was
told that il lie was not willing to testify the case would
be dismissed before he was ever called (apparently he
was an essential witness to the prosecution's case.) In
tact, he did testily though he was obviously ambivalent
about doing so. (In any event, the hearing officer found
for the defense on that issue.)
In short, we find the civil rights of Stanford students
are in practice not abridged under the CJP rules and
procedures as here interpreted. The CJP dispite its
ditterent structure atfords at least equal rights as those
allorded by the SJC and meets all of the rights granted

Space pr id for by University Relations

to students in Article IV Seciton 2 of the ASSU
constitution.
Conclusion
The CJP is of course a body brought into existence
by extraordinary circumstances. We, more than almost
all other members of the community, would like it
replaced by a product of the Committee of Fifteen
which can be approved by all three University
Constituencies. Until this happens and regretably it
may be a long wait until consensus takes hold on the
campus - we unanimously hold that the CJP is a legal
and legitimate institution.

SEPARATE OPINION OF MARK EVANS AND JOHN
KAPLAN
We two formally have no vote in this case. One of us
is an alternate member, appointed to the Panel to sit in
case of unavailability or disqualification of one of the
student members; the other is the chairman, who has no
vote except in case of a lie. Nonetheless, in this separate
opinion, we wish to state our concurrence with the
unanimous opinion of those voting, and to make it clear
that we will act accordingly should our votes be required
on this issue.
This is a somewhat unusual proceeding and regretably
we have relatively little precedent to guide us in our
decision. Nonetheless the issue presented here - the
basic legality of the Campus Judicial Panel - is an
important one which must be decided.
Our Jurisdiction to Decide This Case
The University Administration has argued that we do
not have jurisdiction to decide our own legality since
this question of law can be decided in the first instance
only by the President of the University and, in the
second instance, by the civil courts, should a student
bring suit there alleging that his legal rights were
violated. On the other hand, as members of the CJP, we
are responsible for our own actions, and if we have been
asked by the President to participate in any illegal
enterprise, we have a very simple duty not to do so.
Moreover, if we were to participate in disciplining a
student who claims that we are without authority to
discipline him, that student could, under our rule 18,
bring a charge before us that he had been improperly
disciplined. In hearing such a charge we would in effect
be obliged to make a judgment on our own legitimacy,
(i.e., we would have to rule whether we are in fact "the
judicial system in effect," in the language of section IB
of our Procedures.) And if we could under our rules have
an obligation to make such a judgment, clearly we must
have the authority to make this judgment, if we have
any authority at all.
It is true that the problem of the remedy for an
illegally constituted CJP is a subtle one. If we were to
hand down an opinion seeking to bind our successors to
the illegality of the CJP, we would be exercising a
jurisdiction which we have disclaimed. It is possible that
the proper course of action to remedy an illegally
constituted CJP would simply be our resignations. In
any event, we need not decide this difficult question
because we have examined at great length the arguments
of the defendants and conclude that the CJP is legally
constituted under University "law".
The Basis of the CJP
We will begin with the theory under which the CJP is
constituted; then we will move on to discuss our reasons
for rejecting each of the several grounds under which the
defendants would have us hold this body illegal.
The CJP purports to be set up under the President's
"Residual Authority" contained in Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968, a charter which
was approved by the three major constituencies of the
University, the Student Body, the Faculty, and the
Administration. Article IV provides:
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority
and power of the President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing student conduct
at Stanford University, except in extraordinary
circumstances the SCLC and SJC shall have
primary responsibility for promulgating such
regulations and adjudicating violations thereof.
In short, Article IV binds the President to use the SJC
except in "extraordinary circumstances." In
extraordinary circumstances, however, the President
gnay "enforce regulations governing student conduct"
It is the President's theory that extraordinary
circumstances existed when the Student Senate, over a
period of some eight months, at first failed, and then
refused, to appoint the student members to the SJC
selection committee which would select the student
participants to bring the SJC into existence for that
year. We need not go into the rights and wrongs of the
Student Senate action. It has been defended before us as
merely a technique of exerting pressure upon the
President to do things that were morally or legally
correct. Regardless of its justification, it certainly
amounted to "extraordinary circumstances" within the
meaning of Article IV and hence gave the President the
power to set up a different judicial system.
This is not to say that the President was free to set up
a system that was intrinsically irrational or unfair. Aside
from any legal impediments to his power — which we
will discuss later - the fact is that within the University
community there are political checks upon the
President's power. In part, the students and, perhaps to a
greater extent, the faculty do exert influence in this type
of decision. Otherwise, it would be hard to see why any
chief executive officer would, if completely
unconstrained, set up a system as elaborate as the CJP
simply to do what he thought was correct. In any event,
we need not deal with that issue because the defendants
do not claim here that there is anything about the rules
or procedures of the CJP that is inherently irrational or
unfair. Their complaints are somewhat different.
The ASSU Constitution
The first major attack upon the legality of the
Campus Judicial Panel is that Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter, on which the CJP is
based,was limitedby Article IV of the ASSU constitution
passed and approved by the trustees and the president
subsequent to the Charter, in 1969. The ASSU
constitution, Article IV, Section 1, provides that
"The association (i.e. the student body] shall
recognize the authority of university judicial
bodies over members of the association only if
those judicial bodies shall have been approved
by two-thirds of those members of the
association voting in a general election."
It is the contention of the defendants that these words
which were accepted by the Trustees and President,
constitute a limitation on the President's power under
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter. We
disagree.
To be sure the words of the ASSU constitution on
their face support the defendants' position. When one
looks at the question somewhat more closely, however,
one finds insurmountable problems in accepting the
defendants reasoning.
First, it is clear that the President and Trustees did
not think they had given up any of the President's
residual power under Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter. Indeed, the residual authority of the
President has been vigorously defended by the Trustees
and President essentially since the very beginning of the
University and Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter was simply a recognition of this. To argue that
the Trustees and the President of the University had
agreed to place restrictions on this power without any
Qualifications for emereencies. extraordinary

circumstances or the like, qualifications appearing in
every other limitation of the Presidential power, is to ask
us to believe more than we can. This is especially true
since the consequence of accepting this argument is
that no judicial body at all could be established to
replace the defunct SJC unless it could muster a
two-thirds vote of the students. This might well leave the
University permanently without any means of enforcing
discipline on the campus - a result that no constituency
of the University has supported.
Secondly, the ASSU constitution, as a whole, was
obviously not intended to affect student rights with
respect to those of any other constituency of the
University. A constitution is an allocation of power
within a constituency, and here the constituency was the
student body. The provision requiring a two-thirds vote
of the student body simply determines how the student
body can exercise what power it holds under other
university arrangements; it does not increase the power
of the student body by giving it (indeed, one student
more than one third of those voting) any additional
power which, as a constituency, the students did not
have before Article IV of the ASSU constitution. The
ASSU constitution has the effect of making clear what
was not clear earlier — that is if the student constituency
were asked to approve any judicial body, a simple
majority vote would not be sufficient. The CJP is
founded on an entirely different provision of University
law, the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968 and no
allocation of power and competence within any one
constituency can change this.
This is especially clear in this case since one of the
major constituencies of the University, the Faculty, is
completely ignored by the defense's reading of Article
IV of the ASSU constitution. The Faculty was a party to
the Legislative and Judicial Charter, and had a
continuing interest in that Charter. It had voted for the
President's Article IV power and cannot now be told
that, without any notice to it, an agreement between the
students and the President had changed the rules it had
adopted.
The Academic Senate had already adhered to this
view in acknowledging the legitimacy of the Campus
Judicial Panel. In its resolution of February 17, 1972,
(published in Campus Reports February 23, page 2,
Senate Report (No. 9) the Academic Senate requested
"the prompt prosecution [of certain cases] through
appropriate judicial mechanisms including the Campus
Judicial Panel." The legislative history of this resolution
makes its meaning clear. It was pointed out that the
wording prejudged the legitimacy of the CJP, which had
not yet been authoritatively decided. Despite this, the
resolution carried by a vote of 36 to 1, with three
abstentions. Indeed had the President and the student
body purported to limit Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, they might be in breach of
contract with the faculty.
The conclusion that the ASSU constitution was never
intended as a restriction upon the residual authority of
the President is buttressed by the actions of the Student
Senate itself. It is conceded that the Student Senate, in
refusing to make its appointments to the selection
committee for the SJC, had contemplated that the
President would set up another judicial body. Despite
this so far as we can tell, there was no hint of any
argument by anyone at the time that the ASSU
constitution (as distinguished from all sorts of principles
of fairness or political rights) would prevent the
President from doing this. We must note that the ASSU
constitution was adopted in 1969 within the memory of
many of those presently in the Student Senate. Their
silence on this issue, at a time when it would have been
most relevant, speaks volumes on the intent of the ASSU
Framers.
The Legislative and Judicial Charter
The next argument of the defendants is that the CJP
is illegally constituted because of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter itself. It is the theory of the defendants
that Section I(DX2X C ) of that Charter requires the
President "to go first to the SCLC to get his proposals
through". Section 1(D)(2)(c) provides as follows:
Interim regulations promulgated under Section
1(2) shall expire 90 days after publication
unless within that period the SCLC has taken
steps to promulgate a regulation in the same
area under the procedure specified in Section
D(l), in which case the interim regulation may
remain in effect until the conclusion of the
Section D(l) procedure.
It seems to us the subsection simply does not say what
the defendants contend. Moreover, even if it did, we
would still have the flat statement in Article IV that
"nothing in these articles shall be deemed to contravene
or limit the authority or power of the President.. .." in
extraordinary circumstances. The reading desired by the
defendants is certainly a limitation on the Presidential
authority sought to be imposed by another Article in the
same Charter. Nothing could more clearly contravene
the words of Article IV.
Furthermore, defendants misconstrue the purpose of
Section 1(D)(2)(c) and the SCLC. Article IV draws a
distinction between the promulgation and the
enforcement of regulations concerning student conduct.
Promulgation of regulations is obviously the province of
the SCLC. Since enforcement was the province of the
old SJC the President, in replacing the SJC, has used his
enforcement power, not his legislative power. The job of
the SCLC is to draft regulations such as the disruption
policy or the policy on possession of dangerous
weapons. It is the Committee of Fifteen that has
jurisdiction over setting up new institutions on the
campus, and the Committee of Fifteen has been working
for some while to draft a judicial system that can have
the approval of all Stanford constituencies. Hopefully
they will succeed, but if they do not, the President's
power under Article IV remains and is certainly in no
way limited by Section l(D)2(c).
The Founding Grant
The next argument of defendants is based on a 1902
amendment to the University trusts made by Mrs. Jane
Stanford. The amendment relied on by the defendants
states
"It shall be the duty of the Board of Trustees
to make general laws providing for the
government of the University and to provide
for just and equitable rules of discipline."
It is the argument of the defendants that the Campus

Spacc paid for by University Relations

Judicial Panel does not provide a "just and equitable"
system of discipline. This argument is not founded on
the procedures of the CJP, or upon the denial of any
particular right to defendants before the CJP. This
argument reasons that because the Legislative and
Judicial Charter was "created by the joint approval of
the student referendum, the Academic Council and the
President . . . , it was then seen as necessary to have such
a tripartite agreement to assure just and equitable rules
of discipline." In other words defendants argue that, the
rules of the CJP itself must not only be just and
equitable but the method of arriving at them must be
just and equitable as well. Defendants argue further that
the only just and equitable method of arriving at rules is
by having the rules approved by the University's three
main constituencies.
There are many problems, however, with this
reasoning. First, the trust amendment refers to the rules
themselves, not the method of arriving at them, and
there is no argument that the rules of the CJP do not fall
within the general terms of "just and equitable."
Second, even if we were to interpret the trust
amendment as providing that the rules must be arrived at
is a just and equitable manner, there was certainly no
hint in 1902 when the amendment was made that this
meant participation by students. Admittedly there are
many good reasons for why students should have
decision-making authority in many areas of University
life. The concept, however, that student power be
exercised in a particular manner, a tripartite agreement,
rather than through the appearance of randomly selected
students on the Campus Judicial Panel — does not
follow.
Next, we must remember that the students did
approve the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968
including Article IV which recognized the power of the
President to do just what he has done here.
Finally, if further student power must be found in
the establishment of the CJP, there was inherent in the
SJC a student power to destroy that institution. The use
of that power is why we are where we are today.
The Effect of Extraordinary Circumstances
The final argument that defendants make is the one
that has given us the most difficulty. Essentially, it
asserts that the President's residual authority in
extraordinary circumstances can only be used to meet
those circumstances. The defendants argue that the
President's residual authority could only be used to set
up an institution as much like the defunct SJC as
possible. In other words, if the refusal of the Student
Senate had caused the lack of student members, the
President could only appoint student members to the
selection committee; perhaps, alternatively, to appoint
the students directly to the SJC itself; or, conceivably,
to have randomly selected students chosen for one or
the other position. This argument has a considerable
appeal since it is much easier to modify existing
institutions than to set up wholly new ones. This
argument, however, involves serious problems. First,
nowhere in the Legislative and Judicial Charter, or any
other document which binds the President, is such a
restriction placed on his Article IV power.
Moreover, the number and possible means by which
the President could create systems arguably "as much as
possible like the SJC" is so large that it is difficult to lay
down standards by which his choice might be judged
especially inasmuch as this decision could be made only
after the fact by the judicial pody - presumably after
considerable effort, energy and time had gone into
litigation before it.
Nevertheless, we hold that the Presidents' Article IV
power could only have been used in a reasonable
response to the extraordinary circumstances which faced
him. This, however, does not help the defendants
because the crisis which the President faced when he set
up the CJP, though triggered by the failure of the
Student Senate to make its appointments, was
considerable broader than the mere lack of student
members on the SJC selection committee.
The Situation in Mid-November
In mid-November of this academic year, when the
Student Senate for the first time announced that it
would refuse to appoint its members to the slection
committee for the SJC, the President was clearly
confronted by an "extraordinary circumstance" within
the meaning of Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter. The SJC then was dead, and the President quite
rightly regarded it as a matter of some importance to set
up a substitute body. Unfortunately, the Student Senate
had not only refused to appoint its members to the
selection committee, it and its predecessor had
previously failed to appoint them for approximately
eight months from the time the appointment would have
been made in the normal course of Business. During this
eight month period, the President had personally and
through intermediaries urged again and again that the
student members of the SJC selection committee be
appointed. By the time he was finally refused, (and the
situation was in doubt until the very last evening) a
substantial backlog of cases had built up for the new
SJC. The argument can be made that what the President
should have done was to appoint the student members in
April so that the new SJC could have been formed on
time. We arc convinced, however, that had he dones so,
he would have incurred every bit as much, if not more
criticism on the campus for being precipious than he
now has for having delayed too long. The President
studiously and carefully maintained the view that he
would do nothing whatever to jeopardize the SJC,
although the backlog continued to build up until the time
of the final Senate refusal, it had reached sixteen cases -
twice as many as the SJC had been able to adjudicate in
the entire previous year. We, nonetheless, cannot say
that the President's attitude and actions were wrong in
any respect.
In any event, when the time came for the President
finally to act. he was confronted with the situation far
worse than the sudden disappearance of the SJC. We
cannot ignore the obvious fact that the SJC, even under
the best conditions, could not keep up with its calendar
of cases, and certainly had the President ignored the
Student Senate action and constituted the SJC himself,
the conditions would not have been at their best, so far
as the cooperation of at least some of the student body
was concerned. Indeed, it is likely that even had the
Student Senate appointed its members, the SJC would
shortly have fallen because of its inability to handle its
caseload. It is far more likely that, with the backlog of
cases that had accumulated and the additional doubts as
to its legitimacy among the student body, the

reconstituted SJC would have failed even more quickly.
The very idea of a nine member body both deciding
questions of fact and their own rules of evidence in open
hearing raises so many problems of time and of
complexity that it is frankly quite surprising that the
SJC lasted as long as it did. We are convinced that the
President could consider this in setting up a new body,
the need for whose existence was very clearly not of his
making and in a situation which certainly constituted
"extraordinary circumstances" within the meaning of
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter.
The Structure of the CJP
This decision has two facets. First we consider the
structure of the CJP and second, the rights it affords to
defendants. So far as the structure of the CJP is
concerned, the major difference from the old SJC is the
CJP's use of hearing examiners to find the facts. First of
all, it should be pointed ut that there is nothing
intrinsically unfair to a student defendant in the use of a
hearing examiner as compared to the SJC's deciding the
facts of the case. It is true that where a hearing examiner
sits, no students help determine the facts. On the other
hand, however, faculty members do not sit to determine
the facts either — as they did on the SJC where they had
a majority.
Not only that, but the CJP defendant has a right to
move to disqualify the hearing examiner, a procedure
that was more than merely impracticable when dealing
with the whole SJC' In fact, in one case under the CJP
the chairman informed the defendant that he was.
Jr
prepared to disqualify the hearing examiner who knew a
prosecution witness — but the defense in that case\
refrained from making a motion to disqualify the£
examiner — as has every other defendant. Finally, as far
as we can tell at present, the percentage of acquittals
before the hearing examiners is at least as great, if not
greater, than before the SJC.
The use of hearing examiners is a standard
administrative practice, often handling issues as
important to the litigants as those adjudicated by the
SJC and now the CJP. It is not in equity that the CJP
hearing examiner system differs from that of the old SJC
structure but rather in the saving of time caused by
having one person rather than nine hear the facts of a
case and the additional fairness in having a dispassionate
attorney unconnected with campus issues decide the
facts. In the recent proceeding against Prof. Franklin
before The Advisory Board, criticism was directed
against the method of fact finding on the ground that
the Board was "to close" to the campus and was
personally knowledgeable about the issues. The hearing
examiner system is an effort to meet this problem. The
hearing examiners, though appointed by the President,
are in fact selected by a committee of law professors
appointed by the Dean of the Law School and having no
other connection with campus discipline.
Aside from the use of hearing officers, the remainder
of the structure of the CJP is strikingly similar to that of
the SJC. Where the SJC consisted of four students, four
faculty and a chairman from the law faculty, the CJP
consists of three students, three faculty and a chairman
also from the law faculty. We cannot see any decrease in
fairness because of this and we have already noticed in
our own operations that the difficulty of scheduling
meetings rises exponentially with increasing numbers on
the judicial body.
It is true also that the CJP results are technically in
the form of a recommendation to the President.
However this was equally true of the SJC. (Indeed this
was one of the major complaints of the Student Senate
in destroying the SJC). Not only is this required clearly
by University (and perhaps the outside civil) law, but
whatever political constraints actually separated during
the existence of the SJC which prevented the President
on any occasion from increasing a penalty which the SJC
had found, presumably act equally in the case of the
CJP.
The final complaint as to the structure of the CJP is
that certain decisions are made by the CJP without
hearing witnesses in person but rather only upon the
report of the hearing officer, the motivational
statements of the defendant, argument of counsel, and
written statements as to the relatively few factual
matters that can be in dispute before the CJP itself (as
distinguished of course, from the hearing officer). In
part this restriction on oral testimony as to facts before
the CJP was intended to prevent the prosecutor from
raising objections to the defense use of affidavits,
character reference letters, and the like. The restriction
also, however, recognizes that any taking of oral
testimony (aside from the motivational statement of the
defendant himself — which is guaranteed both by the
rules of the CJP and SJC) involves fact-finding by a
multiple member body and leads to the enormous
problems of time consumption and confusion of issues
that plagued the SJC. The fact is that if any serious
factual issues are disputed, the CJP has jurisdiction to
remand a case to the hearing officer for further fact
finding. The major issues that the CJP itself hears, such
as justification, severity of sentence and fairness, raise
difficult questions of law but do not raise serious factual
dispute.
The Rights of CJP Defendants
Apart from the reasonable explanations of the
structural differences between the CJP and the old SJC,
it should be noted that the legal rights of the student
defendant are virtually the same before both bodies.
Defendants go i lto considerable effort in their brief in
an attempt to show that, in fact, students have fewer
rights under the CJP than they had under the old SJC.
Most of their complaints, however, center on point s they
consider to be unclear and their main argument is that
the CJP may violate these rights. Our decision today
makes it quite clear that we expect in all matters
involving the civil liberties of students to respect
essentially the same rights as they had undr the SJC as
well as under "the Bill of Rights" of the ASSU
constitution (Article IV, Section 2).
So far as the latter document is concerned there are
only two rights in the ASSU constitution which seem in
any way to be unmet by the CJP procedures. The first is
the right of the student "to be assured that, unless the
defendant asks for an an open hearing, any matters of
facts which would tend to identify the person or persons
involved in the case would be kept confidential". The
CJP gives the Chairman the discretion to open such a
hearing without a student's consent. The present
Chairman lias stated that except in some kind of
extraordinary circumstance, which he cannot
contemplate and which presumably the ASSU
constitution could not contemplate either, he will not
exercise his discretion to open a hearing. We feel that
this resolves that problem and we trust that the
Chairman's successors will feel bound by this pledge.
The only other right guaranteed in the ASSU
constitution with which the CJP might seem to have
power to interfere is the right "to have an open
hearing." "An open hearing" surely means a hearing that
is not "closed," in the sense in which a defendant might
ask for a closed hearing to maintain confidentiality (see
LJC Article II F6, which makes this meaning explicit).
An open hearing, therefore, is a hearing which is not
secret: one whose proceedings can in some reasonable
way be observed or inspected by everyone. A normal,
and sufficient, condition for openness is the admission
of the media KZSU, Daily reporters, etc.
An "open hearing" in the colloquial sense of a
hearing any member of the community may attend is
not a right of the defendant. On the contrary, it is at
most a courtesy the CJP arguably owes the community,
unless extending that courtesy is found to be
incompatible with maintaining the minimum of order
and freedom from intimidation that are requisite for any
fair judicial proceeding. We are confident that this is
what both the SJC rule and the ASSU constitution
meant. The CJP "Procedures" (Section 6) do not speak
of an "open hearing" but of a hearing being, or not

being, "open to the public," and so do not even address
the question of an "open hearing" in the legally
important sense. This sense clearly must be covered. We
pledge that any defendant who desires an "open
hearing." ie.. a non-secret hearing, shall have one.
There are numerous other arguments that the defense
makes as to rights which are denied them under the CJP
proceeding. Defendants attorney, for instance, state:
"The subpoena power of the university
prosecutor is also apparently increased as
evidenced by the conduct in the Rafael Robles
hearing where a student was threatened with
disciplinary action for refusal to testify. . . ."
II indeed this were so, it would be a very serious matter.
In lact, so lar as we can determine, the event simply did
not happen. The student was never threatened with
disciplinary action for failure to testify. Indeed, he was
told that il lie was not willing to testify the case would
be dismissed before he was ever called (apparently he
was an essential witness to the prosecution's case.) In
tact, he did testily though he was obviously ambivalent
about doing so. (In any event, the hearing officer found
for the defense on that issue.)
In short, we find the civil rights of Stanford students
are in practice not abridged under the CJP rules and
procedures as here interpreted. The CJP dispite its
ditterent structure atfords at least equal rights as those
allorded by the SJC and meets all of the rights granted

Space pr id for by University Relations

to students in Article IV Seciton 2 of the ASSU
constitution.
Conclusion
The CJP is of course a body brought into existence
by extraordinary circumstances. We, more than almost
all other members of the community, would like it
replaced by a product of the Committee of Fifteen
which can be approved by all three University
Constituencies. Until this happens and regretably it
may be a long wait until consensus takes hold on the
campus - we unanimously hold that the CJP is a legal
and legitimate institution.

SEPARATE OPINION OF MARK EVANS AND JOHN
KAPLAN
We two formally have no vote in this case. One of us
is an alternate member, appointed to the Panel to sit in
case of unavailability or disqualification of one of the
student members; the other is the chairman, who has no
vote except in case of a lie. Nonetheless, in this separate
opinion, we wish to state our concurrence with the
unanimous opinion of those voting, and to make it clear
that we will act accordingly should our votes be required
on this issue.
This is a somewhat unusual proceeding and regretably
we have relatively little precedent to guide us in our
decision. Nonetheless the issue presented here - the
basic legality of the Campus Judicial Panel - is an
important one which must be decided.
Our Jurisdiction to Decide This Case
The University Administration has argued that we do
not have jurisdiction to decide our own legality since
this question of law can be decided in the first instance
only by the President of the University and, in the
second instance, by the civil courts, should a student
bring suit there alleging that his legal rights were
violated. On the other hand, as members of the CJP, we
are responsible for our own actions, and if we have been
asked by the President to participate in any illegal
enterprise, we have a very simple duty not to do so.
Moreover, if we were to participate in disciplining a
student who claims that we are without authority to
discipline him, that student could, under our rule 18,
bring a charge before us that he had been improperly
disciplined. In hearing such a charge we would in effect
be obliged to make a judgment on our own legitimacy,
(i.e., we would have to rule whether we are in fact "the
judicial system in effect," in the language of section IB
of our Procedures.) And if we could under our rules have
an obligation to make such a judgment, clearly we must
have the authority to make this judgment, if we have
any authority at all.
It is true that the problem of the remedy for an
illegally constituted CJP is a subtle one. If we were to
hand down an opinion seeking to bind our successors to
the illegality of the CJP, we would be exercising a
jurisdiction which we have disclaimed. It is possible that
the proper course of action to remedy an illegally
constituted CJP would simply be our resignations. In
any event, we need not decide this difficult question
because we have examined at great length the arguments
of the defendants and conclude that the CJP is legally
constituted under University "law".
The Basis of the CJP
We will begin with the theory under which the CJP is
constituted; then we will move on to discuss our reasons
for rejecting each of the several grounds under which the
defendants would have us hold this body illegal.
The CJP purports to be set up under the President's
"Residual Authority" contained in Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968, a charter which
was approved by the three major constituencies of the
University, the Student Body, the Faculty, and the
Administration. Article IV provides:
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority
and power of the President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing student conduct
at Stanford University, except in extraordinary
circumstances the SCLC and SJC shall have
primary responsibility for promulgating such
regulations and adjudicating violations thereof.
In short, Article IV binds the President to use the SJC
except in "extraordinary circumstances." In
extraordinary circumstances, however, the President
gnay "enforce regulations governing student conduct"
It is the President's theory that extraordinary
circumstances existed when the Student Senate, over a
period of some eight months, at first failed, and then
refused, to appoint the student members to the SJC
selection committee which would select the student
participants to bring the SJC into existence for that
year. We need not go into the rights and wrongs of the
Student Senate action. It has been defended before us as
merely a technique of exerting pressure upon the
President to do things that were morally or legally
correct. Regardless of its justification, it certainly
amounted to "extraordinary circumstances" within the
meaning of Article IV and hence gave the President the
power to set up a different judicial system.
This is not to say that the President was free to set up
a system that was intrinsically irrational or unfair. Aside
from any legal impediments to his power — which we
will discuss later - the fact is that within the University
community there are political checks upon the
President's power. In part, the students and, perhaps to a
greater extent, the faculty do exert influence in this type
of decision. Otherwise, it would be hard to see why any
chief executive officer would, if completely
unconstrained, set up a system as elaborate as the CJP
simply to do what he thought was correct. In any event,
we need not deal with that issue because the defendants
do not claim here that there is anything about the rules
or procedures of the CJP that is inherently irrational or
unfair. Their complaints are somewhat different.
The ASSU Constitution
The first major attack upon the legality of the
Campus Judicial Panel is that Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter, on which the CJP is
based,was limitedby Article IV of the ASSU constitution
passed and approved by the trustees and the president
subsequent to the Charter, in 1969. The ASSU
constitution, Article IV, Section 1, provides that
"The association (i.e. the student body] shall
recognize the authority of university judicial
bodies over members of the association only if
those judicial bodies shall have been approved
by two-thirds of those members of the
association voting in a general election."
It is the contention of the defendants that these words
which were accepted by the Trustees and President,
constitute a limitation on the President's power under
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter. We
disagree.
To be sure the words of the ASSU constitution on
their face support the defendants' position. When one
looks at the question somewhat more closely, however,
one finds insurmountable problems in accepting the
defendants reasoning.
First, it is clear that the President and Trustees did
not think they had given up any of the President's
residual power under Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter. Indeed, the residual authority of the
President has been vigorously defended by the Trustees
and President essentially since the very beginning of the
University and Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter was simply a recognition of this. To argue that
the Trustees and the President of the University had
agreed to place restrictions on this power without any
Qualifications for emereencies. extraordinary

circumstances or the like, qualifications appearing in
every other limitation of the Presidential power, is to ask
us to believe more than we can. This is especially true
since the consequence of accepting this argument is
that no judicial body at all could be established to
replace the defunct SJC unless it could muster a
two-thirds vote of the students. This might well leave the
University permanently without any means of enforcing
discipline on the campus - a result that no constituency
of the University has supported.
Secondly, the ASSU constitution, as a whole, was
obviously not intended to affect student rights with
respect to those of any other constituency of the
University. A constitution is an allocation of power
within a constituency, and here the constituency was the
student body. The provision requiring a two-thirds vote
of the student body simply determines how the student
body can exercise what power it holds under other
university arrangements; it does not increase the power
of the student body by giving it (indeed, one student
more than one third of those voting) any additional
power which, as a constituency, the students did not
have before Article IV of the ASSU constitution. The
ASSU constitution has the effect of making clear what
was not clear earlier — that is if the student constituency
were asked to approve any judicial body, a simple
majority vote would not be sufficient. The CJP is
founded on an entirely different provision of University
law, the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968 and no
allocation of power and competence within any one
constituency can change this.
This is especially clear in this case since one of the
major constituencies of the University, the Faculty, is
completely ignored by the defense's reading of Article
IV of the ASSU constitution. The Faculty was a party to
the Legislative and Judicial Charter, and had a
continuing interest in that Charter. It had voted for the
President's Article IV power and cannot now be told
that, without any notice to it, an agreement between the
students and the President had changed the rules it had
adopted.
The Academic Senate had already adhered to this
view in acknowledging the legitimacy of the Campus
Judicial Panel. In its resolution of February 17, 1972,
(published in Campus Reports February 23, page 2,
Senate Report (No. 9) the Academic Senate requested
"the prompt prosecution [of certain cases] through
appropriate judicial mechanisms including the Campus
Judicial Panel." The legislative history of this resolution
makes its meaning clear. It was pointed out that the
wording prejudged the legitimacy of the CJP, which had
not yet been authoritatively decided. Despite this, the
resolution carried by a vote of 36 to 1, with three
abstentions. Indeed had the President and the student
body purported to limit Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, they might be in breach of
contract with the faculty.
The conclusion that the ASSU constitution was never
intended as a restriction upon the residual authority of
the President is buttressed by the actions of the Student
Senate itself. It is conceded that the Student Senate, in
refusing to make its appointments to the selection
committee for the SJC, had contemplated that the
President would set up another judicial body. Despite
this so far as we can tell, there was no hint of any
argument by anyone at the time that the ASSU
constitution (as distinguished from all sorts of principles
of fairness or political rights) would prevent the
President from doing this. We must note that the ASSU
constitution was adopted in 1969 within the memory of
many of those presently in the Student Senate. Their
silence on this issue, at a time when it would have been
most relevant, speaks volumes on the intent of the ASSU
Framers.
The Legislative and Judicial Charter
The next argument of the defendants is that the CJP
is illegally constituted because of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter itself. It is the theory of the defendants
that Section I(DX2X C ) of that Charter requires the
President "to go first to the SCLC to get his proposals
through". Section 1(D)(2)(c) provides as follows:
Interim regulations promulgated under Section
1(2) shall expire 90 days after publication
unless within that period the SCLC has taken
steps to promulgate a regulation in the same
area under the procedure specified in Section
D(l), in which case the interim regulation may
remain in effect until the conclusion of the
Section D(l) procedure.
It seems to us the subsection simply does not say what
the defendants contend. Moreover, even if it did, we
would still have the flat statement in Article IV that
"nothing in these articles shall be deemed to contravene
or limit the authority or power of the President.. .." in
extraordinary circumstances. The reading desired by the
defendants is certainly a limitation on the Presidential
authority sought to be imposed by another Article in the
same Charter. Nothing could more clearly contravene
the words of Article IV.
Furthermore, defendants misconstrue the purpose of
Section 1(D)(2)(c) and the SCLC. Article IV draws a
distinction between the promulgation and the
enforcement of regulations concerning student conduct.
Promulgation of regulations is obviously the province of
the SCLC. Since enforcement was the province of the
old SJC the President, in replacing the SJC, has used his
enforcement power, not his legislative power. The job of
the SCLC is to draft regulations such as the disruption
policy or the policy on possession of dangerous
weapons. It is the Committee of Fifteen that has
jurisdiction over setting up new institutions on the
campus, and the Committee of Fifteen has been working
for some while to draft a judicial system that can have
the approval of all Stanford constituencies. Hopefully
they will succeed, but if they do not, the President's
power under Article IV remains and is certainly in no
way limited by Section l(D)2(c).
The Founding Grant
The next argument of defendants is based on a 1902
amendment to the University trusts made by Mrs. Jane
Stanford. The amendment relied on by the defendants
states
"It shall be the duty of the Board of Trustees
to make general laws providing for the
government of the University and to provide
for just and equitable rules of discipline."
It is the argument of the defendants that the Campus

Spacc paid for by University Relations

Judicial Panel does not provide a "just and equitable"
system of discipline. This argument is not founded on
the procedures of the CJP, or upon the denial of any
particular right to defendants before the CJP. This
argument reasons that because the Legislative and
Judicial Charter was "created by the joint approval of
the student referendum, the Academic Council and the
President . . . , it was then seen as necessary to have such
a tripartite agreement to assure just and equitable rules
of discipline." In other words defendants argue that, the
rules of the CJP itself must not only be just and
equitable but the method of arriving at them must be
just and equitable as well. Defendants argue further that
the only just and equitable method of arriving at rules is
by having the rules approved by the University's three
main constituencies.
There are many problems, however, with this
reasoning. First, the trust amendment refers to the rules
themselves, not the method of arriving at them, and
there is no argument that the rules of the CJP do not fall
within the general terms of "just and equitable."
Second, even if we were to interpret the trust
amendment as providing that the rules must be arrived at
is a just and equitable manner, there was certainly no
hint in 1902 when the amendment was made that this
meant participation by students. Admittedly there are
many good reasons for why students should have
decision-making authority in many areas of University
life. The concept, however, that student power be
exercised in a particular manner, a tripartite agreement,
rather than through the appearance of randomly selected
students on the Campus Judicial Panel — does not
follow.
Next, we must remember that the students did
approve the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968
including Article IV which recognized the power of the
President to do just what he has done here.
Finally, if further student power must be found in
the establishment of the CJP, there was inherent in the
SJC a student power to destroy that institution. The use
of that power is why we are where we are today.
The Effect of Extraordinary Circumstances
The final argument that defendants make is the one
that has given us the most difficulty. Essentially, it
asserts that the President's residual authority in
extraordinary circumstances can only be used to meet
those circumstances. The defendants argue that the
President's residual authority could only be used to set
up an institution as much like the defunct SJC as
possible. In other words, if the refusal of the Student
Senate had caused the lack of student members, the
President could only appoint student members to the
selection committee; perhaps, alternatively, to appoint
the students directly to the SJC itself; or, conceivably,
to have randomly selected students chosen for one or
the other position. This argument has a considerable
appeal since it is much easier to modify existing
institutions than to set up wholly new ones. This
argument, however, involves serious problems. First,
nowhere in the Legislative and Judicial Charter, or any
other document which binds the President, is such a
restriction placed on his Article IV power.
Moreover, the number and possible means by which
the President could create systems arguably "as much as
possible like the SJC" is so large that it is difficult to lay
down standards by which his choice might be judged
especially inasmuch as this decision could be made only
after the fact by the judicial pody - presumably after
considerable effort, energy and time had gone into
litigation before it.
Nevertheless, we hold that the Presidents' Article IV
power could only have been used in a reasonable
response to the extraordinary circumstances which faced
him. This, however, does not help the defendants
because the crisis which the President faced when he set
up the CJP, though triggered by the failure of the
Student Senate to make its appointments, was
considerable broader than the mere lack of student
members on the SJC selection committee.
The Situation in Mid-November
In mid-November of this academic year, when the
Student Senate for the first time announced that it
would refuse to appoint its members to the slection
committee for the SJC, the President was clearly
confronted by an "extraordinary circumstance" within
the meaning of Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter. The SJC then was dead, and the President quite
rightly regarded it as a matter of some importance to set
up a substitute body. Unfortunately, the Student Senate
had not only refused to appoint its members to the
selection committee, it and its predecessor had
previously failed to appoint them for approximately
eight months from the time the appointment would have
been made in the normal course of Business. During this
eight month period, the President had personally and
through intermediaries urged again and again that the
student members of the SJC selection committee be
appointed. By the time he was finally refused, (and the
situation was in doubt until the very last evening) a
substantial backlog of cases had built up for the new
SJC. The argument can be made that what the President
should have done was to appoint the student members in
April so that the new SJC could have been formed on
time. We arc convinced, however, that had he dones so,
he would have incurred every bit as much, if not more
criticism on the campus for being precipious than he
now has for having delayed too long. The President
studiously and carefully maintained the view that he
would do nothing whatever to jeopardize the SJC,
although the backlog continued to build up until the time
of the final Senate refusal, it had reached sixteen cases -
twice as many as the SJC had been able to adjudicate in
the entire previous year. We, nonetheless, cannot say
that the President's attitude and actions were wrong in
any respect.
In any event, when the time came for the President
finally to act. he was confronted with the situation far
worse than the sudden disappearance of the SJC. We
cannot ignore the obvious fact that the SJC, even under
the best conditions, could not keep up with its calendar
of cases, and certainly had the President ignored the
Student Senate action and constituted the SJC himself,
the conditions would not have been at their best, so far
as the cooperation of at least some of the student body
was concerned. Indeed, it is likely that even had the
Student Senate appointed its members, the SJC would
shortly have fallen because of its inability to handle its
caseload. It is far more likely that, with the backlog of
cases that had accumulated and the additional doubts as
to its legitimacy among the student body, the

reconstituted SJC would have failed even more quickly.
The very idea of a nine member body both deciding
questions of fact and their own rules of evidence in open
hearing raises so many problems of time and of
complexity that it is frankly quite surprising that the
SJC lasted as long as it did. We are convinced that the
President could consider this in setting up a new body,
the need for whose existence was very clearly not of his
making and in a situation which certainly constituted
"extraordinary circumstances" within the meaning of
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter.
The Structure of the CJP
This decision has two facets. First we consider the
structure of the CJP and second, the rights it affords to
defendants. So far as the structure of the CJP is
concerned, the major difference from the old SJC is the
CJP's use of hearing examiners to find the facts. First of
all, it should be pointed ut that there is nothing
intrinsically unfair to a student defendant in the use of a
hearing examiner as compared to the SJC's deciding the
facts of the case. It is true that where a hearing examiner
sits, no students help determine the facts. On the other
hand, however, faculty members do not sit to determine
the facts either — as they did on the SJC where they had
a majority.
Not only that, but the CJP defendant has a right to
move to disqualify the hearing examiner, a procedure
that was more than merely impracticable when dealing
with the whole SJC' In fact, in one case under the CJP
the chairman informed the defendant that he was.
Jr
prepared to disqualify the hearing examiner who knew a
prosecution witness — but the defense in that case\
refrained from making a motion to disqualify the£
examiner — as has every other defendant. Finally, as far
as we can tell at present, the percentage of acquittals
before the hearing examiners is at least as great, if not
greater, than before the SJC.
The use of hearing examiners is a standard
administrative practice, often handling issues as
important to the litigants as those adjudicated by the
SJC and now the CJP. It is not in equity that the CJP
hearing examiner system differs from that of the old SJC
structure but rather in the saving of time caused by
having one person rather than nine hear the facts of a
case and the additional fairness in having a dispassionate
attorney unconnected with campus issues decide the
facts. In the recent proceeding against Prof. Franklin
before The Advisory Board, criticism was directed
against the method of fact finding on the ground that
the Board was "to close" to the campus and was
personally knowledgeable about the issues. The hearing
examiner system is an effort to meet this problem. The
hearing examiners, though appointed by the President,
are in fact selected by a committee of law professors
appointed by the Dean of the Law School and having no
other connection with campus discipline.
Aside from the use of hearing officers, the remainder
of the structure of the CJP is strikingly similar to that of
the SJC. Where the SJC consisted of four students, four
faculty and a chairman from the law faculty, the CJP
consists of three students, three faculty and a chairman
also from the law faculty. We cannot see any decrease in
fairness because of this and we have already noticed in
our own operations that the difficulty of scheduling
meetings rises exponentially with increasing numbers on
the judicial body.
It is true also that the CJP results are technically in
the form of a recommendation to the President.
However this was equally true of the SJC. (Indeed this
was one of the major complaints of the Student Senate
in destroying the SJC). Not only is this required clearly
by University (and perhaps the outside civil) law, but
whatever political constraints actually separated during
the existence of the SJC which prevented the President
on any occasion from increasing a penalty which the SJC
had found, presumably act equally in the case of the
CJP.
The final complaint as to the structure of the CJP is
that certain decisions are made by the CJP without
hearing witnesses in person but rather only upon the
report of the hearing officer, the motivational
statements of the defendant, argument of counsel, and
written statements as to the relatively few factual
matters that can be in dispute before the CJP itself (as
distinguished of course, from the hearing officer). In
part this restriction on oral testimony as to facts before
the CJP was intended to prevent the prosecutor from
raising objections to the defense use of affidavits,
character reference letters, and the like. The restriction
also, however, recognizes that any taking of oral
testimony (aside from the motivational statement of the
defendant himself — which is guaranteed both by the
rules of the CJP and SJC) involves fact-finding by a
multiple member body and leads to the enormous
problems of time consumption and confusion of issues
that plagued the SJC. The fact is that if any serious
factual issues are disputed, the CJP has jurisdiction to
remand a case to the hearing officer for further fact
finding. The major issues that the CJP itself hears, such
as justification, severity of sentence and fairness, raise
difficult questions of law but do not raise serious factual
dispute.
The Rights of CJP Defendants
Apart from the reasonable explanations of the
structural differences between the CJP and the old SJC,
it should be noted that the legal rights of the student
defendant are virtually the same before both bodies.
Defendants go i lto considerable effort in their brief in
an attempt to show that, in fact, students have fewer
rights under the CJP than they had under the old SJC.
Most of their complaints, however, center on point s they
consider to be unclear and their main argument is that
the CJP may violate these rights. Our decision today
makes it quite clear that we expect in all matters
involving the civil liberties of students to respect
essentially the same rights as they had undr the SJC as
well as under "the Bill of Rights" of the ASSU
constitution (Article IV, Section 2).
So far as the latter document is concerned there are
only two rights in the ASSU constitution which seem in
any way to be unmet by the CJP procedures. The first is
the right of the student "to be assured that, unless the
defendant asks for an an open hearing, any matters of
facts which would tend to identify the person or persons
involved in the case would be kept confidential". The
CJP gives the Chairman the discretion to open such a
hearing without a student's consent. The present
Chairman lias stated that except in some kind of
extraordinary circumstance, which he cannot
contemplate and which presumably the ASSU
constitution could not contemplate either, he will not
exercise his discretion to open a hearing. We feel that
this resolves that problem and we trust that the
Chairman's successors will feel bound by this pledge.
The only other right guaranteed in the ASSU
constitution with which the CJP might seem to have
power to interfere is the right "to have an open
hearing." "An open hearing" surely means a hearing that
is not "closed," in the sense in which a defendant might
ask for a closed hearing to maintain confidentiality (see
LJC Article II F6, which makes this meaning explicit).
An open hearing, therefore, is a hearing which is not
secret: one whose proceedings can in some reasonable
way be observed or inspected by everyone. A normal,
and sufficient, condition for openness is the admission
of the media KZSU, Daily reporters, etc.
An "open hearing" in the colloquial sense of a
hearing any member of the community may attend is
not a right of the defendant. On the contrary, it is at
most a courtesy the CJP arguably owes the community,
unless extending that courtesy is found to be
incompatible with maintaining the minimum of order
and freedom from intimidation that are requisite for any
fair judicial proceeding. We are confident that this is
what both the SJC rule and the ASSU constitution
meant. The CJP "Procedures" (Section 6) do not speak
of an "open hearing" but of a hearing being, or not

being, "open to the public," and so do not even address
the question of an "open hearing" in the legally
important sense. This sense clearly must be covered. We
pledge that any defendant who desires an "open
hearing." ie.. a non-secret hearing, shall have one.
There are numerous other arguments that the defense
makes as to rights which are denied them under the CJP
proceeding. Defendants attorney, for instance, state:
"The subpoena power of the university
prosecutor is also apparently increased as
evidenced by the conduct in the Rafael Robles
hearing where a student was threatened with
disciplinary action for refusal to testify. . . ."
II indeed this were so, it would be a very serious matter.
In lact, so lar as we can determine, the event simply did
not happen. The student was never threatened with
disciplinary action for failure to testify. Indeed, he was
told that il lie was not willing to testify the case would
be dismissed before he was ever called (apparently he
was an essential witness to the prosecution's case.) In
tact, he did testily though he was obviously ambivalent
about doing so. (In any event, the hearing officer found
for the defense on that issue.)
In short, we find the civil rights of Stanford students
are in practice not abridged under the CJP rules and
procedures as here interpreted. The CJP dispite its
ditterent structure atfords at least equal rights as those
allorded by the SJC and meets all of the rights granted

Space pr id for by University Relations

to students in Article IV Seciton 2 of the ASSU
constitution.
Conclusion
The CJP is of course a body brought into existence
by extraordinary circumstances. We, more than almost
all other members of the community, would like it
replaced by a product of the Committee of Fifteen
which can be approved by all three University
Constituencies. Until this happens and regretably it
may be a long wait until consensus takes hold on the
campus - we unanimously hold that the CJP is a legal
and legitimate institution.

SEPARATE OPINION OF MARK EVANS AND JOHN
KAPLAN
We two formally have no vote in this case. One of us
is an alternate member, appointed to the Panel to sit in
case of unavailability or disqualification of one of the
student members; the other is the chairman, who has no
vote except in case of a lie. Nonetheless, in this separate
opinion, we wish to state our concurrence with the
unanimous opinion of those voting, and to make it clear
that we will act accordingly should our votes be required
on this issue.
This is a somewhat unusual proceeding and regretably
we have relatively little precedent to guide us in our
decision. Nonetheless the issue presented here - the
basic legality of the Campus Judicial Panel - is an
important one which must be decided.
Our Jurisdiction to Decide This Case
The University Administration has argued that we do
not have jurisdiction to decide our own legality since
this question of law can be decided in the first instance
only by the President of the University and, in the
second instance, by the civil courts, should a student
bring suit there alleging that his legal rights were
violated. On the other hand, as members of the CJP, we
are responsible for our own actions, and if we have been
asked by the President to participate in any illegal
enterprise, we have a very simple duty not to do so.
Moreover, if we were to participate in disciplining a
student who claims that we are without authority to
discipline him, that student could, under our rule 18,
bring a charge before us that he had been improperly
disciplined. In hearing such a charge we would in effect
be obliged to make a judgment on our own legitimacy,
(i.e., we would have to rule whether we are in fact "the
judicial system in effect," in the language of section IB
of our Procedures.) And if we could under our rules have
an obligation to make such a judgment, clearly we must
have the authority to make this judgment, if we have
any authority at all.
It is true that the problem of the remedy for an
illegally constituted CJP is a subtle one. If we were to
hand down an opinion seeking to bind our successors to
the illegality of the CJP, we would be exercising a
jurisdiction which we have disclaimed. It is possible that
the proper course of action to remedy an illegally
constituted CJP would simply be our resignations. In
any event, we need not decide this difficult question
because we have examined at great length the arguments
of the defendants and conclude that the CJP is legally
constituted under University "law".
The Basis of the CJP
We will begin with the theory under which the CJP is
constituted; then we will move on to discuss our reasons
for rejecting each of the several grounds under which the
defendants would have us hold this body illegal.
The CJP purports to be set up under the President's
"Residual Authority" contained in Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968, a charter which
was approved by the three major constituencies of the
University, the Student Body, the Faculty, and the
Administration. Article IV provides:
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority
and power of the President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing student conduct
at Stanford University, except in extraordinary
circumstances the SCLC and SJC shall have
primary responsibility for promulgating such
regulations and adjudicating violations thereof.
In short, Article IV binds the President to use the SJC
except in "extraordinary circumstances." In
extraordinary circumstances, however, the President
gnay "enforce regulations governing student conduct"
It is the President's theory that extraordinary
circumstances existed when the Student Senate, over a
period of some eight months, at first failed, and then
refused, to appoint the student members to the SJC
selection committee which would select the student
participants to bring the SJC into existence for that
year. We need not go into the rights and wrongs of the
Student Senate action. It has been defended before us as
merely a technique of exerting pressure upon the
President to do things that were morally or legally
correct. Regardless of its justification, it certainly
amounted to "extraordinary circumstances" within the
meaning of Article IV and hence gave the President the
power to set up a different judicial system.
This is not to say that the President was free to set up
a system that was intrinsically irrational or unfair. Aside
from any legal impediments to his power — which we
will discuss later - the fact is that within the University
community there are political checks upon the
President's power. In part, the students and, perhaps to a
greater extent, the faculty do exert influence in this type
of decision. Otherwise, it would be hard to see why any
chief executive officer would, if completely
unconstrained, set up a system as elaborate as the CJP
simply to do what he thought was correct. In any event,
we need not deal with that issue because the defendants
do not claim here that there is anything about the rules
or procedures of the CJP that is inherently irrational or
unfair. Their complaints are somewhat different.
The ASSU Constitution
The first major attack upon the legality of the
Campus Judicial Panel is that Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter, on which the CJP is
based,was limitedby Article IV of the ASSU constitution
passed and approved by the trustees and the president
subsequent to the Charter, in 1969. The ASSU
constitution, Article IV, Section 1, provides that
"The association (i.e. the student body] shall
recognize the authority of university judicial
bodies over members of the association only if
those judicial bodies shall have been approved
by two-thirds of those members of the
association voting in a general election."
It is the contention of the defendants that these words
which were accepted by the Trustees and President,
constitute a limitation on the President's power under
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter. We
disagree.
To be sure the words of the ASSU constitution on
their face support the defendants' position. When one
looks at the question somewhat more closely, however,
one finds insurmountable problems in accepting the
defendants reasoning.
First, it is clear that the President and Trustees did
not think they had given up any of the President's
residual power under Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter. Indeed, the residual authority of the
President has been vigorously defended by the Trustees
and President essentially since the very beginning of the
University and Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter was simply a recognition of this. To argue that
the Trustees and the President of the University had
agreed to place restrictions on this power without any
Qualifications for emereencies. extraordinary

circumstances or the like, qualifications appearing in
every other limitation of the Presidential power, is to ask
us to believe more than we can. This is especially true
since the consequence of accepting this argument is
that no judicial body at all could be established to
replace the defunct SJC unless it could muster a
two-thirds vote of the students. This might well leave the
University permanently without any means of enforcing
discipline on the campus - a result that no constituency
of the University has supported.
Secondly, the ASSU constitution, as a whole, was
obviously not intended to affect student rights with
respect to those of any other constituency of the
University. A constitution is an allocation of power
within a constituency, and here the constituency was the
student body. The provision requiring a two-thirds vote
of the student body simply determines how the student
body can exercise what power it holds under other
university arrangements; it does not increase the power
of the student body by giving it (indeed, one student
more than one third of those voting) any additional
power which, as a constituency, the students did not
have before Article IV of the ASSU constitution. The
ASSU constitution has the effect of making clear what
was not clear earlier — that is if the student constituency
were asked to approve any judicial body, a simple
majority vote would not be sufficient. The CJP is
founded on an entirely different provision of University
law, the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968 and no
allocation of power and competence within any one
constituency can change this.
This is especially clear in this case since one of the
major constituencies of the University, the Faculty, is
completely ignored by the defense's reading of Article
IV of the ASSU constitution. The Faculty was a party to
the Legislative and Judicial Charter, and had a
continuing interest in that Charter. It had voted for the
President's Article IV power and cannot now be told
that, without any notice to it, an agreement between the
students and the President had changed the rules it had
adopted.
The Academic Senate had already adhered to this
view in acknowledging the legitimacy of the Campus
Judicial Panel. In its resolution of February 17, 1972,
(published in Campus Reports February 23, page 2,
Senate Report (No. 9) the Academic Senate requested
"the prompt prosecution [of certain cases] through
appropriate judicial mechanisms including the Campus
Judicial Panel." The legislative history of this resolution
makes its meaning clear. It was pointed out that the
wording prejudged the legitimacy of the CJP, which had
not yet been authoritatively decided. Despite this, the
resolution carried by a vote of 36 to 1, with three
abstentions. Indeed had the President and the student
body purported to limit Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, they might be in breach of
contract with the faculty.
The conclusion that the ASSU constitution was never
intended as a restriction upon the residual authority of
the President is buttressed by the actions of the Student
Senate itself. It is conceded that the Student Senate, in
refusing to make its appointments to the selection
committee for the SJC, had contemplated that the
President would set up another judicial body. Despite
this so far as we can tell, there was no hint of any
argument by anyone at the time that the ASSU
constitution (as distinguished from all sorts of principles
of fairness or political rights) would prevent the
President from doing this. We must note that the ASSU
constitution was adopted in 1969 within the memory of
many of those presently in the Student Senate. Their
silence on this issue, at a time when it would have been
most relevant, speaks volumes on the intent of the ASSU
Framers.
The Legislative and Judicial Charter
The next argument of the defendants is that the CJP
is illegally constituted because of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter itself. It is the theory of the defendants
that Section I(DX2X C ) of that Charter requires the
President "to go first to the SCLC to get his proposals
through". Section 1(D)(2)(c) provides as follows:
Interim regulations promulgated under Section
1(2) shall expire 90 days after publication
unless within that period the SCLC has taken
steps to promulgate a regulation in the same
area under the procedure specified in Section
D(l), in which case the interim regulation may
remain in effect until the conclusion of the
Section D(l) procedure.
It seems to us the subsection simply does not say what
the defendants contend. Moreover, even if it did, we
would still have the flat statement in Article IV that
"nothing in these articles shall be deemed to contravene
or limit the authority or power of the President.. .." in
extraordinary circumstances. The reading desired by the
defendants is certainly a limitation on the Presidential
authority sought to be imposed by another Article in the
same Charter. Nothing could more clearly contravene
the words of Article IV.
Furthermore, defendants misconstrue the purpose of
Section 1(D)(2)(c) and the SCLC. Article IV draws a
distinction between the promulgation and the
enforcement of regulations concerning student conduct.
Promulgation of regulations is obviously the province of
the SCLC. Since enforcement was the province of the
old SJC the President, in replacing the SJC, has used his
enforcement power, not his legislative power. The job of
the SCLC is to draft regulations such as the disruption
policy or the policy on possession of dangerous
weapons. It is the Committee of Fifteen that has
jurisdiction over setting up new institutions on the
campus, and the Committee of Fifteen has been working
for some while to draft a judicial system that can have
the approval of all Stanford constituencies. Hopefully
they will succeed, but if they do not, the President's
power under Article IV remains and is certainly in no
way limited by Section l(D)2(c).
The Founding Grant
The next argument of defendants is based on a 1902
amendment to the University trusts made by Mrs. Jane
Stanford. The amendment relied on by the defendants
states
"It shall be the duty of the Board of Trustees
to make general laws providing for the
government of the University and to provide
for just and equitable rules of discipline."
It is the argument of the defendants that the Campus

Spacc paid for by University Relations

Judicial Panel does not provide a "just and equitable"
system of discipline. This argument is not founded on
the procedures of the CJP, or upon the denial of any
particular right to defendants before the CJP. This
argument reasons that because the Legislative and
Judicial Charter was "created by the joint approval of
the student referendum, the Academic Council and the
President . . . , it was then seen as necessary to have such
a tripartite agreement to assure just and equitable rules
of discipline." In other words defendants argue that, the
rules of the CJP itself must not only be just and
equitable but the method of arriving at them must be
just and equitable as well. Defendants argue further that
the only just and equitable method of arriving at rules is
by having the rules approved by the University's three
main constituencies.
There are many problems, however, with this
reasoning. First, the trust amendment refers to the rules
themselves, not the method of arriving at them, and
there is no argument that the rules of the CJP do not fall
within the general terms of "just and equitable."
Second, even if we were to interpret the trust
amendment as providing that the rules must be arrived at
is a just and equitable manner, there was certainly no
hint in 1902 when the amendment was made that this
meant participation by students. Admittedly there are
many good reasons for why students should have
decision-making authority in many areas of University
life. The concept, however, that student power be
exercised in a particular manner, a tripartite agreement,
rather than through the appearance of randomly selected
students on the Campus Judicial Panel — does not
follow.
Next, we must remember that the students did
approve the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968
including Article IV which recognized the power of the
President to do just what he has done here.
Finally, if further student power must be found in
the establishment of the CJP, there was inherent in the
SJC a student power to destroy that institution. The use
of that power is why we are where we are today.
The Effect of Extraordinary Circumstances
The final argument that defendants make is the one
that has given us the most difficulty. Essentially, it
asserts that the President's residual authority in
extraordinary circumstances can only be used to meet
those circumstances. The defendants argue that the
President's residual authority could only be used to set
up an institution as much like the defunct SJC as
possible. In other words, if the refusal of the Student
Senate had caused the lack of student members, the
President could only appoint student members to the
selection committee; perhaps, alternatively, to appoint
the students directly to the SJC itself; or, conceivably,
to have randomly selected students chosen for one or
the other position. This argument has a considerable
appeal since it is much easier to modify existing
institutions than to set up wholly new ones. This
argument, however, involves serious problems. First,
nowhere in the Legislative and Judicial Charter, or any
other document which binds the President, is such a
restriction placed on his Article IV power.
Moreover, the number and possible means by which
the President could create systems arguably "as much as
possible like the SJC" is so large that it is difficult to lay
down standards by which his choice might be judged
especially inasmuch as this decision could be made only
after the fact by the judicial pody - presumably after
considerable effort, energy and time had gone into
litigation before it.
Nevertheless, we hold that the Presidents' Article IV
power could only have been used in a reasonable
response to the extraordinary circumstances which faced
him. This, however, does not help the defendants
because the crisis which the President faced when he set
up the CJP, though triggered by the failure of the
Student Senate to make its appointments, was
considerable broader than the mere lack of student
members on the SJC selection committee.
The Situation in Mid-November
In mid-November of this academic year, when the
Student Senate for the first time announced that it
would refuse to appoint its members to the slection
committee for the SJC, the President was clearly
confronted by an "extraordinary circumstance" within
the meaning of Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter. The SJC then was dead, and the President quite
rightly regarded it as a matter of some importance to set
up a substitute body. Unfortunately, the Student Senate
had not only refused to appoint its members to the
selection committee, it and its predecessor had
previously failed to appoint them for approximately
eight months from the time the appointment would have
been made in the normal course of Business. During this
eight month period, the President had personally and
through intermediaries urged again and again that the
student members of the SJC selection committee be
appointed. By the time he was finally refused, (and the
situation was in doubt until the very last evening) a
substantial backlog of cases had built up for the new
SJC. The argument can be made that what the President
should have done was to appoint the student members in
April so that the new SJC could have been formed on
time. We arc convinced, however, that had he dones so,
he would have incurred every bit as much, if not more
criticism on the campus for being precipious than he
now has for having delayed too long. The President
studiously and carefully maintained the view that he
would do nothing whatever to jeopardize the SJC,
although the backlog continued to build up until the time
of the final Senate refusal, it had reached sixteen cases -
twice as many as the SJC had been able to adjudicate in
the entire previous year. We, nonetheless, cannot say
that the President's attitude and actions were wrong in
any respect.
In any event, when the time came for the President
finally to act. he was confronted with the situation far
worse than the sudden disappearance of the SJC. We
cannot ignore the obvious fact that the SJC, even under
the best conditions, could not keep up with its calendar
of cases, and certainly had the President ignored the
Student Senate action and constituted the SJC himself,
the conditions would not have been at their best, so far
as the cooperation of at least some of the student body
was concerned. Indeed, it is likely that even had the
Student Senate appointed its members, the SJC would
shortly have fallen because of its inability to handle its
caseload. It is far more likely that, with the backlog of
cases that had accumulated and the additional doubts as
to its legitimacy among the student body, the

reconstituted SJC would have failed even more quickly.
The very idea of a nine member body both deciding
questions of fact and their own rules of evidence in open
hearing raises so many problems of time and of
complexity that it is frankly quite surprising that the
SJC lasted as long as it did. We are convinced that the
President could consider this in setting up a new body,
the need for whose existence was very clearly not of his
making and in a situation which certainly constituted
"extraordinary circumstances" within the meaning of
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter.
The Structure of the CJP
This decision has two facets. First we consider the
structure of the CJP and second, the rights it affords to
defendants. So far as the structure of the CJP is
concerned, the major difference from the old SJC is the
CJP's use of hearing examiners to find the facts. First of
all, it should be pointed ut that there is nothing
intrinsically unfair to a student defendant in the use of a
hearing examiner as compared to the SJC's deciding the
facts of the case. It is true that where a hearing examiner
sits, no students help determine the facts. On the other
hand, however, faculty members do not sit to determine
the facts either — as they did on the SJC where they had
a majority.
Not only that, but the CJP defendant has a right to
move to disqualify the hearing examiner, a procedure
that was more than merely impracticable when dealing
with the whole SJC' In fact, in one case under the CJP
the chairman informed the defendant that he was.
Jr
prepared to disqualify the hearing examiner who knew a
prosecution witness — but the defense in that case\
refrained from making a motion to disqualify the£
examiner — as has every other defendant. Finally, as far
as we can tell at present, the percentage of acquittals
before the hearing examiners is at least as great, if not
greater, than before the SJC.
The use of hearing examiners is a standard
administrative practice, often handling issues as
important to the litigants as those adjudicated by the
SJC and now the CJP. It is not in equity that the CJP
hearing examiner system differs from that of the old SJC
structure but rather in the saving of time caused by
having one person rather than nine hear the facts of a
case and the additional fairness in having a dispassionate
attorney unconnected with campus issues decide the
facts. In the recent proceeding against Prof. Franklin
before The Advisory Board, criticism was directed
against the method of fact finding on the ground that
the Board was "to close" to the campus and was
personally knowledgeable about the issues. The hearing
examiner system is an effort to meet this problem. The
hearing examiners, though appointed by the President,
are in fact selected by a committee of law professors
appointed by the Dean of the Law School and having no
other connection with campus discipline.
Aside from the use of hearing officers, the remainder
of the structure of the CJP is strikingly similar to that of
the SJC. Where the SJC consisted of four students, four
faculty and a chairman from the law faculty, the CJP
consists of three students, three faculty and a chairman
also from the law faculty. We cannot see any decrease in
fairness because of this and we have already noticed in
our own operations that the difficulty of scheduling
meetings rises exponentially with increasing numbers on
the judicial body.
It is true also that the CJP results are technically in
the form of a recommendation to the President.
However this was equally true of the SJC. (Indeed this
was one of the major complaints of the Student Senate
in destroying the SJC). Not only is this required clearly
by University (and perhaps the outside civil) law, but
whatever political constraints actually separated during
the existence of the SJC which prevented the President
on any occasion from increasing a penalty which the SJC
had found, presumably act equally in the case of the
CJP.
The final complaint as to the structure of the CJP is
that certain decisions are made by the CJP without
hearing witnesses in person but rather only upon the
report of the hearing officer, the motivational
statements of the defendant, argument of counsel, and
written statements as to the relatively few factual
matters that can be in dispute before the CJP itself (as
distinguished of course, from the hearing officer). In
part this restriction on oral testimony as to facts before
the CJP was intended to prevent the prosecutor from
raising objections to the defense use of affidavits,
character reference letters, and the like. The restriction
also, however, recognizes that any taking of oral
testimony (aside from the motivational statement of the
defendant himself — which is guaranteed both by the
rules of the CJP and SJC) involves fact-finding by a
multiple member body and leads to the enormous
problems of time consumption and confusion of issues
that plagued the SJC. The fact is that if any serious
factual issues are disputed, the CJP has jurisdiction to
remand a case to the hearing officer for further fact
finding. The major issues that the CJP itself hears, such
as justification, severity of sentence and fairness, raise
difficult questions of law but do not raise serious factual
dispute.
The Rights of CJP Defendants
Apart from the reasonable explanations of the
structural differences between the CJP and the old SJC,
it should be noted that the legal rights of the student
defendant are virtually the same before both bodies.
Defendants go i lto considerable effort in their brief in
an attempt to show that, in fact, students have fewer
rights under the CJP than they had under the old SJC.
Most of their complaints, however, center on point s they
consider to be unclear and their main argument is that
the CJP may violate these rights. Our decision today
makes it quite clear that we expect in all matters
involving the civil liberties of students to respect
essentially the same rights as they had undr the SJC as
well as under "the Bill of Rights" of the ASSU
constitution (Article IV, Section 2).
So far as the latter document is concerned there are
only two rights in the ASSU constitution which seem in
any way to be unmet by the CJP procedures. The first is
the right of the student "to be assured that, unless the
defendant asks for an an open hearing, any matters of
facts which would tend to identify the person or persons
involved in the case would be kept confidential". The
CJP gives the Chairman the discretion to open such a
hearing without a student's consent. The present
Chairman lias stated that except in some kind of
extraordinary circumstance, which he cannot
contemplate and which presumably the ASSU
constitution could not contemplate either, he will not
exercise his discretion to open a hearing. We feel that
this resolves that problem and we trust that the
Chairman's successors will feel bound by this pledge.
The only other right guaranteed in the ASSU
constitution with which the CJP might seem to have
power to interfere is the right "to have an open
hearing." "An open hearing" surely means a hearing that
is not "closed," in the sense in which a defendant might
ask for a closed hearing to maintain confidentiality (see
LJC Article II F6, which makes this meaning explicit).
An open hearing, therefore, is a hearing which is not
secret: one whose proceedings can in some reasonable
way be observed or inspected by everyone. A normal,
and sufficient, condition for openness is the admission
of the media KZSU, Daily reporters, etc.
An "open hearing" in the colloquial sense of a
hearing any member of the community may attend is
not a right of the defendant. On the contrary, it is at
most a courtesy the CJP arguably owes the community,
unless extending that courtesy is found to be
incompatible with maintaining the minimum of order
and freedom from intimidation that are requisite for any
fair judicial proceeding. We are confident that this is
what both the SJC rule and the ASSU constitution
meant. The CJP "Procedures" (Section 6) do not speak
of an "open hearing" but of a hearing being, or not

being, "open to the public," and so do not even address
the question of an "open hearing" in the legally
important sense. This sense clearly must be covered. We
pledge that any defendant who desires an "open
hearing." ie.. a non-secret hearing, shall have one.
There are numerous other arguments that the defense
makes as to rights which are denied them under the CJP
proceeding. Defendants attorney, for instance, state:
"The subpoena power of the university
prosecutor is also apparently increased as
evidenced by the conduct in the Rafael Robles
hearing where a student was threatened with
disciplinary action for refusal to testify. . . ."
II indeed this were so, it would be a very serious matter.
In lact, so lar as we can determine, the event simply did
not happen. The student was never threatened with
disciplinary action for failure to testify. Indeed, he was
told that il lie was not willing to testify the case would
be dismissed before he was ever called (apparently he
was an essential witness to the prosecution's case.) In
tact, he did testily though he was obviously ambivalent
about doing so. (In any event, the hearing officer found
for the defense on that issue.)
In short, we find the civil rights of Stanford students
are in practice not abridged under the CJP rules and
procedures as here interpreted. The CJP dispite its
ditterent structure atfords at least equal rights as those
allorded by the SJC and meets all of the rights granted

Space pr id for by University Relations

to students in Article IV Seciton 2 of the ASSU
constitution.
Conclusion
The CJP is of course a body brought into existence
by extraordinary circumstances. We, more than almost
all other members of the community, would like it
replaced by a product of the Committee of Fifteen
which can be approved by all three University
Constituencies. Until this happens and regretably it
may be a long wait until consensus takes hold on the
campus - we unanimously hold that the CJP is a legal
and legitimate institution.

SEPARATE OPINION OF MARK EVANS AND JOHN
KAPLAN
We two formally have no vote in this case. One of us
is an alternate member, appointed to the Panel to sit in
case of unavailability or disqualification of one of the
student members; the other is the chairman, who has no
vote except in case of a lie. Nonetheless, in this separate
opinion, we wish to state our concurrence with the
unanimous opinion of those voting, and to make it clear
that we will act accordingly should our votes be required
on this issue.
This is a somewhat unusual proceeding and regretably
we have relatively little precedent to guide us in our
decision. Nonetheless the issue presented here - the
basic legality of the Campus Judicial Panel - is an
important one which must be decided.
Our Jurisdiction to Decide This Case
The University Administration has argued that we do
not have jurisdiction to decide our own legality since
this question of law can be decided in the first instance
only by the President of the University and, in the
second instance, by the civil courts, should a student
bring suit there alleging that his legal rights were
violated. On the other hand, as members of the CJP, we
are responsible for our own actions, and if we have been
asked by the President to participate in any illegal
enterprise, we have a very simple duty not to do so.
Moreover, if we were to participate in disciplining a
student who claims that we are without authority to
discipline him, that student could, under our rule 18,
bring a charge before us that he had been improperly
disciplined. In hearing such a charge we would in effect
be obliged to make a judgment on our own legitimacy,
(i.e., we would have to rule whether we are in fact "the
judicial system in effect," in the language of section IB
of our Procedures.) And if we could under our rules have
an obligation to make such a judgment, clearly we must
have the authority to make this judgment, if we have
any authority at all.
It is true that the problem of the remedy for an
illegally constituted CJP is a subtle one. If we were to
hand down an opinion seeking to bind our successors to
the illegality of the CJP, we would be exercising a
jurisdiction which we have disclaimed. It is possible that
the proper course of action to remedy an illegally
constituted CJP would simply be our resignations. In
any event, we need not decide this difficult question
because we have examined at great length the arguments
of the defendants and conclude that the CJP is legally
constituted under University "law".
The Basis of the CJP
We will begin with the theory under which the CJP is
constituted; then we will move on to discuss our reasons
for rejecting each of the several grounds under which the
defendants would have us hold this body illegal.
The CJP purports to be set up under the President's
"Residual Authority" contained in Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968, a charter which
was approved by the three major constituencies of the
University, the Student Body, the Faculty, and the
Administration. Article IV provides:
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority
and power of the President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing student conduct
at Stanford University, except in extraordinary
circumstances the SCLC and SJC shall have
primary responsibility for promulgating such
regulations and adjudicating violations thereof.
In short, Article IV binds the President to use the SJC
except in "extraordinary circumstances." In
extraordinary circumstances, however, the President
gnay "enforce regulations governing student conduct"
It is the President's theory that extraordinary
circumstances existed when the Student Senate, over a
period of some eight months, at first failed, and then
refused, to appoint the student members to the SJC
selection committee which would select the student
participants to bring the SJC into existence for that
year. We need not go into the rights and wrongs of the
Student Senate action. It has been defended before us as
merely a technique of exerting pressure upon the
President to do things that were morally or legally
correct. Regardless of its justification, it certainly
amounted to "extraordinary circumstances" within the
meaning of Article IV and hence gave the President the
power to set up a different judicial system.
This is not to say that the President was free to set up
a system that was intrinsically irrational or unfair. Aside
from any legal impediments to his power — which we
will discuss later - the fact is that within the University
community there are political checks upon the
President's power. In part, the students and, perhaps to a
greater extent, the faculty do exert influence in this type
of decision. Otherwise, it would be hard to see why any
chief executive officer would, if completely
unconstrained, set up a system as elaborate as the CJP
simply to do what he thought was correct. In any event,
we need not deal with that issue because the defendants
do not claim here that there is anything about the rules
or procedures of the CJP that is inherently irrational or
unfair. Their complaints are somewhat different.
The ASSU Constitution
The first major attack upon the legality of the
Campus Judicial Panel is that Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter, on which the CJP is
based,was limitedby Article IV of the ASSU constitution
passed and approved by the trustees and the president
subsequent to the Charter, in 1969. The ASSU
constitution, Article IV, Section 1, provides that
"The association (i.e. the student body] shall
recognize the authority of university judicial
bodies over members of the association only if
those judicial bodies shall have been approved
by two-thirds of those members of the
association voting in a general election."
It is the contention of the defendants that these words
which were accepted by the Trustees and President,
constitute a limitation on the President's power under
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter. We
disagree.
To be sure the words of the ASSU constitution on
their face support the defendants' position. When one
looks at the question somewhat more closely, however,
one finds insurmountable problems in accepting the
defendants reasoning.
First, it is clear that the President and Trustees did
not think they had given up any of the President's
residual power under Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter. Indeed, the residual authority of the
President has been vigorously defended by the Trustees
and President essentially since the very beginning of the
University and Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter was simply a recognition of this. To argue that
the Trustees and the President of the University had
agreed to place restrictions on this power without any
Qualifications for emereencies. extraordinary

circumstances or the like, qualifications appearing in
every other limitation of the Presidential power, is to ask
us to believe more than we can. This is especially true
since the consequence of accepting this argument is
that no judicial body at all could be established to
replace the defunct SJC unless it could muster a
two-thirds vote of the students. This might well leave the
University permanently without any means of enforcing
discipline on the campus - a result that no constituency
of the University has supported.
Secondly, the ASSU constitution, as a whole, was
obviously not intended to affect student rights with
respect to those of any other constituency of the
University. A constitution is an allocation of power
within a constituency, and here the constituency was the
student body. The provision requiring a two-thirds vote
of the student body simply determines how the student
body can exercise what power it holds under other
university arrangements; it does not increase the power
of the student body by giving it (indeed, one student
more than one third of those voting) any additional
power which, as a constituency, the students did not
have before Article IV of the ASSU constitution. The
ASSU constitution has the effect of making clear what
was not clear earlier — that is if the student constituency
were asked to approve any judicial body, a simple
majority vote would not be sufficient. The CJP is
founded on an entirely different provision of University
law, the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968 and no
allocation of power and competence within any one
constituency can change this.
This is especially clear in this case since one of the
major constituencies of the University, the Faculty, is
completely ignored by the defense's reading of Article
IV of the ASSU constitution. The Faculty was a party to
the Legislative and Judicial Charter, and had a
continuing interest in that Charter. It had voted for the
President's Article IV power and cannot now be told
that, without any notice to it, an agreement between the
students and the President had changed the rules it had
adopted.
The Academic Senate had already adhered to this
view in acknowledging the legitimacy of the Campus
Judicial Panel. In its resolution of February 17, 1972,
(published in Campus Reports February 23, page 2,
Senate Report (No. 9) the Academic Senate requested
"the prompt prosecution [of certain cases] through
appropriate judicial mechanisms including the Campus
Judicial Panel." The legislative history of this resolution
makes its meaning clear. It was pointed out that the
wording prejudged the legitimacy of the CJP, which had
not yet been authoritatively decided. Despite this, the
resolution carried by a vote of 36 to 1, with three
abstentions. Indeed had the President and the student
body purported to limit Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, they might be in breach of
contract with the faculty.
The conclusion that the ASSU constitution was never
intended as a restriction upon the residual authority of
the President is buttressed by the actions of the Student
Senate itself. It is conceded that the Student Senate, in
refusing to make its appointments to the selection
committee for the SJC, had contemplated that the
President would set up another judicial body. Despite
this so far as we can tell, there was no hint of any
argument by anyone at the time that the ASSU
constitution (as distinguished from all sorts of principles
of fairness or political rights) would prevent the
President from doing this. We must note that the ASSU
constitution was adopted in 1969 within the memory of
many of those presently in the Student Senate. Their
silence on this issue, at a time when it would have been
most relevant, speaks volumes on the intent of the ASSU
Framers.
The Legislative and Judicial Charter
The next argument of the defendants is that the CJP
is illegally constituted because of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter itself. It is the theory of the defendants
that Section I(DX2X C ) of that Charter requires the
President "to go first to the SCLC to get his proposals
through". Section 1(D)(2)(c) provides as follows:
Interim regulations promulgated under Section
1(2) shall expire 90 days after publication
unless within that period the SCLC has taken
steps to promulgate a regulation in the same
area under the procedure specified in Section
D(l), in which case the interim regulation may
remain in effect until the conclusion of the
Section D(l) procedure.
It seems to us the subsection simply does not say what
the defendants contend. Moreover, even if it did, we
would still have the flat statement in Article IV that
"nothing in these articles shall be deemed to contravene
or limit the authority or power of the President.. .." in
extraordinary circumstances. The reading desired by the
defendants is certainly a limitation on the Presidential
authority sought to be imposed by another Article in the
same Charter. Nothing could more clearly contravene
the words of Article IV.
Furthermore, defendants misconstrue the purpose of
Section 1(D)(2)(c) and the SCLC. Article IV draws a
distinction between the promulgation and the
enforcement of regulations concerning student conduct.
Promulgation of regulations is obviously the province of
the SCLC. Since enforcement was the province of the
old SJC the President, in replacing the SJC, has used his
enforcement power, not his legislative power. The job of
the SCLC is to draft regulations such as the disruption
policy or the policy on possession of dangerous
weapons. It is the Committee of Fifteen that has
jurisdiction over setting up new institutions on the
campus, and the Committee of Fifteen has been working
for some while to draft a judicial system that can have
the approval of all Stanford constituencies. Hopefully
they will succeed, but if they do not, the President's
power under Article IV remains and is certainly in no
way limited by Section l(D)2(c).
The Founding Grant
The next argument of defendants is based on a 1902
amendment to the University trusts made by Mrs. Jane
Stanford. The amendment relied on by the defendants
states
"It shall be the duty of the Board of Trustees
to make general laws providing for the
government of the University and to provide
for just and equitable rules of discipline."
It is the argument of the defendants that the Campus

Spacc paid for by University Relations

Judicial Panel does not provide a "just and equitable"
system of discipline. This argument is not founded on
the procedures of the CJP, or upon the denial of any
particular right to defendants before the CJP. This
argument reasons that because the Legislative and
Judicial Charter was "created by the joint approval of
the student referendum, the Academic Council and the
President . . . , it was then seen as necessary to have such
a tripartite agreement to assure just and equitable rules
of discipline." In other words defendants argue that, the
rules of the CJP itself must not only be just and
equitable but the method of arriving at them must be
just and equitable as well. Defendants argue further that
the only just and equitable method of arriving at rules is
by having the rules approved by the University's three
main constituencies.
There are many problems, however, with this
reasoning. First, the trust amendment refers to the rules
themselves, not the method of arriving at them, and
there is no argument that the rules of the CJP do not fall
within the general terms of "just and equitable."
Second, even if we were to interpret the trust
amendment as providing that the rules must be arrived at
is a just and equitable manner, there was certainly no
hint in 1902 when the amendment was made that this
meant participation by students. Admittedly there are
many good reasons for why students should have
decision-making authority in many areas of University
life. The concept, however, that student power be
exercised in a particular manner, a tripartite agreement,
rather than through the appearance of randomly selected
students on the Campus Judicial Panel — does not
follow.
Next, we must remember that the students did
approve the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968
including Article IV which recognized the power of the
President to do just what he has done here.
Finally, if further student power must be found in
the establishment of the CJP, there was inherent in the
SJC a student power to destroy that institution. The use
of that power is why we are where we are today.
The Effect of Extraordinary Circumstances
The final argument that defendants make is the one
that has given us the most difficulty. Essentially, it
asserts that the President's residual authority in
extraordinary circumstances can only be used to meet
those circumstances. The defendants argue that the
President's residual authority could only be used to set
up an institution as much like the defunct SJC as
possible. In other words, if the refusal of the Student
Senate had caused the lack of student members, the
President could only appoint student members to the
selection committee; perhaps, alternatively, to appoint
the students directly to the SJC itself; or, conceivably,
to have randomly selected students chosen for one or
the other position. This argument has a considerable
appeal since it is much easier to modify existing
institutions than to set up wholly new ones. This
argument, however, involves serious problems. First,
nowhere in the Legislative and Judicial Charter, or any
other document which binds the President, is such a
restriction placed on his Article IV power.
Moreover, the number and possible means by which
the President could create systems arguably "as much as
possible like the SJC" is so large that it is difficult to lay
down standards by which his choice might be judged
especially inasmuch as this decision could be made only
after the fact by the judicial pody - presumably after
considerable effort, energy and time had gone into
litigation before it.
Nevertheless, we hold that the Presidents' Article IV
power could only have been used in a reasonable
response to the extraordinary circumstances which faced
him. This, however, does not help the defendants
because the crisis which the President faced when he set
up the CJP, though triggered by the failure of the
Student Senate to make its appointments, was
considerable broader than the mere lack of student
members on the SJC selection committee.
The Situation in Mid-November
In mid-November of this academic year, when the
Student Senate for the first time announced that it
would refuse to appoint its members to the slection
committee for the SJC, the President was clearly
confronted by an "extraordinary circumstance" within
the meaning of Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter. The SJC then was dead, and the President quite
rightly regarded it as a matter of some importance to set
up a substitute body. Unfortunately, the Student Senate
had not only refused to appoint its members to the
selection committee, it and its predecessor had
previously failed to appoint them for approximately
eight months from the time the appointment would have
been made in the normal course of Business. During this
eight month period, the President had personally and
through intermediaries urged again and again that the
student members of the SJC selection committee be
appointed. By the time he was finally refused, (and the
situation was in doubt until the very last evening) a
substantial backlog of cases had built up for the new
SJC. The argument can be made that what the President
should have done was to appoint the student members in
April so that the new SJC could have been formed on
time. We arc convinced, however, that had he dones so,
he would have incurred every bit as much, if not more
criticism on the campus for being precipious than he
now has for having delayed too long. The President
studiously and carefully maintained the view that he
would do nothing whatever to jeopardize the SJC,
although the backlog continued to build up until the time
of the final Senate refusal, it had reached sixteen cases -
twice as many as the SJC had been able to adjudicate in
the entire previous year. We, nonetheless, cannot say
that the President's attitude and actions were wrong in
any respect.
In any event, when the time came for the President
finally to act. he was confronted with the situation far
worse than the sudden disappearance of the SJC. We
cannot ignore the obvious fact that the SJC, even under
the best conditions, could not keep up with its calendar
of cases, and certainly had the President ignored the
Student Senate action and constituted the SJC himself,
the conditions would not have been at their best, so far
as the cooperation of at least some of the student body
was concerned. Indeed, it is likely that even had the
Student Senate appointed its members, the SJC would
shortly have fallen because of its inability to handle its
caseload. It is far more likely that, with the backlog of
cases that had accumulated and the additional doubts as
to its legitimacy among the student body, the

reconstituted SJC would have failed even more quickly.
The very idea of a nine member body both deciding
questions of fact and their own rules of evidence in open
hearing raises so many problems of time and of
complexity that it is frankly quite surprising that the
SJC lasted as long as it did. We are convinced that the
President could consider this in setting up a new body,
the need for whose existence was very clearly not of his
making and in a situation which certainly constituted
"extraordinary circumstances" within the meaning of
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter.
The Structure of the CJP
This decision has two facets. First we consider the
structure of the CJP and second, the rights it affords to
defendants. So far as the structure of the CJP is
concerned, the major difference from the old SJC is the
CJP's use of hearing examiners to find the facts. First of
all, it should be pointed ut that there is nothing
intrinsically unfair to a student defendant in the use of a
hearing examiner as compared to the SJC's deciding the
facts of the case. It is true that where a hearing examiner
sits, no students help determine the facts. On the other
hand, however, faculty members do not sit to determine
the facts either — as they did on the SJC where they had
a majority.
Not only that, but the CJP defendant has a right to
move to disqualify the hearing examiner, a procedure
that was more than merely impracticable when dealing
with the whole SJC' In fact, in one case under the CJP
the chairman informed the defendant that he was.
Jr
prepared to disqualify the hearing examiner who knew a
prosecution witness — but the defense in that case\
refrained from making a motion to disqualify the£
examiner — as has every other defendant. Finally, as far
as we can tell at present, the percentage of acquittals
before the hearing examiners is at least as great, if not
greater, than before the SJC.
The use of hearing examiners is a standard
administrative practice, often handling issues as
important to the litigants as those adjudicated by the
SJC and now the CJP. It is not in equity that the CJP
hearing examiner system differs from that of the old SJC
structure but rather in the saving of time caused by
having one person rather than nine hear the facts of a
case and the additional fairness in having a dispassionate
attorney unconnected with campus issues decide the
facts. In the recent proceeding against Prof. Franklin
before The Advisory Board, criticism was directed
against the method of fact finding on the ground that
the Board was "to close" to the campus and was
personally knowledgeable about the issues. The hearing
examiner system is an effort to meet this problem. The
hearing examiners, though appointed by the President,
are in fact selected by a committee of law professors
appointed by the Dean of the Law School and having no
other connection with campus discipline.
Aside from the use of hearing officers, the remainder
of the structure of the CJP is strikingly similar to that of
the SJC. Where the SJC consisted of four students, four
faculty and a chairman from the law faculty, the CJP
consists of three students, three faculty and a chairman
also from the law faculty. We cannot see any decrease in
fairness because of this and we have already noticed in
our own operations that the difficulty of scheduling
meetings rises exponentially with increasing numbers on
the judicial body.
It is true also that the CJP results are technically in
the form of a recommendation to the President.
However this was equally true of the SJC. (Indeed this
was one of the major complaints of the Student Senate
in destroying the SJC). Not only is this required clearly
by University (and perhaps the outside civil) law, but
whatever political constraints actually separated during
the existence of the SJC which prevented the President
on any occasion from increasing a penalty which the SJC
had found, presumably act equally in the case of the
CJP.
The final complaint as to the structure of the CJP is
that certain decisions are made by the CJP without
hearing witnesses in person but rather only upon the
report of the hearing officer, the motivational
statements of the defendant, argument of counsel, and
written statements as to the relatively few factual
matters that can be in dispute before the CJP itself (as
distinguished of course, from the hearing officer). In
part this restriction on oral testimony as to facts before
the CJP was intended to prevent the prosecutor from
raising objections to the defense use of affidavits,
character reference letters, and the like. The restriction
also, however, recognizes that any taking of oral
testimony (aside from the motivational statement of the
defendant himself — which is guaranteed both by the
rules of the CJP and SJC) involves fact-finding by a
multiple member body and leads to the enormous
problems of time consumption and confusion of issues
that plagued the SJC. The fact is that if any serious
factual issues are disputed, the CJP has jurisdiction to
remand a case to the hearing officer for further fact
finding. The major issues that the CJP itself hears, such
as justification, severity of sentence and fairness, raise
difficult questions of law but do not raise serious factual
dispute.
The Rights of CJP Defendants
Apart from the reasonable explanations of the
structural differences between the CJP and the old SJC,
it should be noted that the legal rights of the student
defendant are virtually the same before both bodies.
Defendants go i lto considerable effort in their brief in
an attempt to show that, in fact, students have fewer
rights under the CJP than they had under the old SJC.
Most of their complaints, however, center on point s they
consider to be unclear and their main argument is that
the CJP may violate these rights. Our decision today
makes it quite clear that we expect in all matters
involving the civil liberties of students to respect
essentially the same rights as they had undr the SJC as
well as under "the Bill of Rights" of the ASSU
constitution (Article IV, Section 2).
So far as the latter document is concerned there are
only two rights in the ASSU constitution which seem in
any way to be unmet by the CJP procedures. The first is
the right of the student "to be assured that, unless the
defendant asks for an an open hearing, any matters of
facts which would tend to identify the person or persons
involved in the case would be kept confidential". The
CJP gives the Chairman the discretion to open such a
hearing without a student's consent. The present
Chairman lias stated that except in some kind of
extraordinary circumstance, which he cannot
contemplate and which presumably the ASSU
constitution could not contemplate either, he will not
exercise his discretion to open a hearing. We feel that
this resolves that problem and we trust that the
Chairman's successors will feel bound by this pledge.
The only other right guaranteed in the ASSU
constitution with which the CJP might seem to have
power to interfere is the right "to have an open
hearing." "An open hearing" surely means a hearing that
is not "closed," in the sense in which a defendant might
ask for a closed hearing to maintain confidentiality (see
LJC Article II F6, which makes this meaning explicit).
An open hearing, therefore, is a hearing which is not
secret: one whose proceedings can in some reasonable
way be observed or inspected by everyone. A normal,
and sufficient, condition for openness is the admission
of the media KZSU, Daily reporters, etc.
An "open hearing" in the colloquial sense of a
hearing any member of the community may attend is
not a right of the defendant. On the contrary, it is at
most a courtesy the CJP arguably owes the community,
unless extending that courtesy is found to be
incompatible with maintaining the minimum of order
and freedom from intimidation that are requisite for any
fair judicial proceeding. We are confident that this is
what both the SJC rule and the ASSU constitution
meant. The CJP "Procedures" (Section 6) do not speak
of an "open hearing" but of a hearing being, or not

being, "open to the public," and so do not even address
the question of an "open hearing" in the legally
important sense. This sense clearly must be covered. We
pledge that any defendant who desires an "open
hearing." ie.. a non-secret hearing, shall have one.
There are numerous other arguments that the defense
makes as to rights which are denied them under the CJP
proceeding. Defendants attorney, for instance, state:
"The subpoena power of the university
prosecutor is also apparently increased as
evidenced by the conduct in the Rafael Robles
hearing where a student was threatened with
disciplinary action for refusal to testify. . . ."
II indeed this were so, it would be a very serious matter.
In lact, so lar as we can determine, the event simply did
not happen. The student was never threatened with
disciplinary action for failure to testify. Indeed, he was
told that il lie was not willing to testify the case would
be dismissed before he was ever called (apparently he
was an essential witness to the prosecution's case.) In
tact, he did testily though he was obviously ambivalent
about doing so. (In any event, the hearing officer found
for the defense on that issue.)
In short, we find the civil rights of Stanford students
are in practice not abridged under the CJP rules and
procedures as here interpreted. The CJP dispite its
ditterent structure atfords at least equal rights as those
allorded by the SJC and meets all of the rights granted

Space pr id for by University Relations

to students in Article IV Seciton 2 of the ASSU
constitution.
Conclusion
The CJP is of course a body brought into existence
by extraordinary circumstances. We, more than almost
all other members of the community, would like it
replaced by a product of the Committee of Fifteen
which can be approved by all three University
Constituencies. Until this happens and regretably it
may be a long wait until consensus takes hold on the
campus - we unanimously hold that the CJP is a legal
and legitimate institution.

SEPARATE OPINION OF MARK EVANS AND JOHN
KAPLAN
We two formally have no vote in this case. One of us
is an alternate member, appointed to the Panel to sit in
case of unavailability or disqualification of one of the
student members; the other is the chairman, who has no
vote except in case of a lie. Nonetheless, in this separate
opinion, we wish to state our concurrence with the
unanimous opinion of those voting, and to make it clear
that we will act accordingly should our votes be required
on this issue.
This is a somewhat unusual proceeding and regretably
we have relatively little precedent to guide us in our
decision. Nonetheless the issue presented here - the
basic legality of the Campus Judicial Panel - is an
important one which must be decided.
Our Jurisdiction to Decide This Case
The University Administration has argued that we do
not have jurisdiction to decide our own legality since
this question of law can be decided in the first instance
only by the President of the University and, in the
second instance, by the civil courts, should a student
bring suit there alleging that his legal rights were
violated. On the other hand, as members of the CJP, we
are responsible for our own actions, and if we have been
asked by the President to participate in any illegal
enterprise, we have a very simple duty not to do so.
Moreover, if we were to participate in disciplining a
student who claims that we are without authority to
discipline him, that student could, under our rule 18,
bring a charge before us that he had been improperly
disciplined. In hearing such a charge we would in effect
be obliged to make a judgment on our own legitimacy,
(i.e., we would have to rule whether we are in fact "the
judicial system in effect," in the language of section IB
of our Procedures.) And if we could under our rules have
an obligation to make such a judgment, clearly we must
have the authority to make this judgment, if we have
any authority at all.
It is true that the problem of the remedy for an
illegally constituted CJP is a subtle one. If we were to
hand down an opinion seeking to bind our successors to
the illegality of the CJP, we would be exercising a
jurisdiction which we have disclaimed. It is possible that
the proper course of action to remedy an illegally
constituted CJP would simply be our resignations. In
any event, we need not decide this difficult question
because we have examined at great length the arguments
of the defendants and conclude that the CJP is legally
constituted under University "law".
The Basis of the CJP
We will begin with the theory under which the CJP is
constituted; then we will move on to discuss our reasons
for rejecting each of the several grounds under which the
defendants would have us hold this body illegal.
The CJP purports to be set up under the President's
"Residual Authority" contained in Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968, a charter which
was approved by the three major constituencies of the
University, the Student Body, the Faculty, and the
Administration. Article IV provides:
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority
and power of the President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing student conduct
at Stanford University, except in extraordinary
circumstances the SCLC and SJC shall have
primary responsibility for promulgating such
regulations and adjudicating violations thereof.
In short, Article IV binds the President to use the SJC
except in "extraordinary circumstances." In
extraordinary circumstances, however, the President
gnay "enforce regulations governing student conduct"
It is the President's theory that extraordinary
circumstances existed when the Student Senate, over a
period of some eight months, at first failed, and then
refused, to appoint the student members to the SJC
selection committee which would select the student
participants to bring the SJC into existence for that
year. We need not go into the rights and wrongs of the
Student Senate action. It has been defended before us as
merely a technique of exerting pressure upon the
President to do things that were morally or legally
correct. Regardless of its justification, it certainly
amounted to "extraordinary circumstances" within the
meaning of Article IV and hence gave the President the
power to set up a different judicial system.
This is not to say that the President was free to set up
a system that was intrinsically irrational or unfair. Aside
from any legal impediments to his power — which we
will discuss later - the fact is that within the University
community there are political checks upon the
President's power. In part, the students and, perhaps to a
greater extent, the faculty do exert influence in this type
of decision. Otherwise, it would be hard to see why any
chief executive officer would, if completely
unconstrained, set up a system as elaborate as the CJP
simply to do what he thought was correct. In any event,
we need not deal with that issue because the defendants
do not claim here that there is anything about the rules
or procedures of the CJP that is inherently irrational or
unfair. Their complaints are somewhat different.
The ASSU Constitution
The first major attack upon the legality of the
Campus Judicial Panel is that Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter, on which the CJP is
based,was limitedby Article IV of the ASSU constitution
passed and approved by the trustees and the president
subsequent to the Charter, in 1969. The ASSU
constitution, Article IV, Section 1, provides that
"The association (i.e. the student body] shall
recognize the authority of university judicial
bodies over members of the association only if
those judicial bodies shall have been approved
by two-thirds of those members of the
association voting in a general election."
It is the contention of the defendants that these words
which were accepted by the Trustees and President,
constitute a limitation on the President's power under
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter. We
disagree.
To be sure the words of the ASSU constitution on
their face support the defendants' position. When one
looks at the question somewhat more closely, however,
one finds insurmountable problems in accepting the
defendants reasoning.
First, it is clear that the President and Trustees did
not think they had given up any of the President's
residual power under Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter. Indeed, the residual authority of the
President has been vigorously defended by the Trustees
and President essentially since the very beginning of the
University and Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter was simply a recognition of this. To argue that
the Trustees and the President of the University had
agreed to place restrictions on this power without any
Qualifications for emereencies. extraordinary

circumstances or the like, qualifications appearing in
every other limitation of the Presidential power, is to ask
us to believe more than we can. This is especially true
since the consequence of accepting this argument is
that no judicial body at all could be established to
replace the defunct SJC unless it could muster a
two-thirds vote of the students. This might well leave the
University permanently without any means of enforcing
discipline on the campus - a result that no constituency
of the University has supported.
Secondly, the ASSU constitution, as a whole, was
obviously not intended to affect student rights with
respect to those of any other constituency of the
University. A constitution is an allocation of power
within a constituency, and here the constituency was the
student body. The provision requiring a two-thirds vote
of the student body simply determines how the student
body can exercise what power it holds under other
university arrangements; it does not increase the power
of the student body by giving it (indeed, one student
more than one third of those voting) any additional
power which, as a constituency, the students did not
have before Article IV of the ASSU constitution. The
ASSU constitution has the effect of making clear what
was not clear earlier — that is if the student constituency
were asked to approve any judicial body, a simple
majority vote would not be sufficient. The CJP is
founded on an entirely different provision of University
law, the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968 and no
allocation of power and competence within any one
constituency can change this.
This is especially clear in this case since one of the
major constituencies of the University, the Faculty, is
completely ignored by the defense's reading of Article
IV of the ASSU constitution. The Faculty was a party to
the Legislative and Judicial Charter, and had a
continuing interest in that Charter. It had voted for the
President's Article IV power and cannot now be told
that, without any notice to it, an agreement between the
students and the President had changed the rules it had
adopted.
The Academic Senate had already adhered to this
view in acknowledging the legitimacy of the Campus
Judicial Panel. In its resolution of February 17, 1972,
(published in Campus Reports February 23, page 2,
Senate Report (No. 9) the Academic Senate requested
"the prompt prosecution [of certain cases] through
appropriate judicial mechanisms including the Campus
Judicial Panel." The legislative history of this resolution
makes its meaning clear. It was pointed out that the
wording prejudged the legitimacy of the CJP, which had
not yet been authoritatively decided. Despite this, the
resolution carried by a vote of 36 to 1, with three
abstentions. Indeed had the President and the student
body purported to limit Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, they might be in breach of
contract with the faculty.
The conclusion that the ASSU constitution was never
intended as a restriction upon the residual authority of
the President is buttressed by the actions of the Student
Senate itself. It is conceded that the Student Senate, in
refusing to make its appointments to the selection
committee for the SJC, had contemplated that the
President would set up another judicial body. Despite
this so far as we can tell, there was no hint of any
argument by anyone at the time that the ASSU
constitution (as distinguished from all sorts of principles
of fairness or political rights) would prevent the
President from doing this. We must note that the ASSU
constitution was adopted in 1969 within the memory of
many of those presently in the Student Senate. Their
silence on this issue, at a time when it would have been
most relevant, speaks volumes on the intent of the ASSU
Framers.
The Legislative and Judicial Charter
The next argument of the defendants is that the CJP
is illegally constituted because of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter itself. It is the theory of the defendants
that Section I(DX2X C ) of that Charter requires the
President "to go first to the SCLC to get his proposals
through". Section 1(D)(2)(c) provides as follows:
Interim regulations promulgated under Section
1(2) shall expire 90 days after publication
unless within that period the SCLC has taken
steps to promulgate a regulation in the same
area under the procedure specified in Section
D(l), in which case the interim regulation may
remain in effect until the conclusion of the
Section D(l) procedure.
It seems to us the subsection simply does not say what
the defendants contend. Moreover, even if it did, we
would still have the flat statement in Article IV that
"nothing in these articles shall be deemed to contravene
or limit the authority or power of the President.. .." in
extraordinary circumstances. The reading desired by the
defendants is certainly a limitation on the Presidential
authority sought to be imposed by another Article in the
same Charter. Nothing could more clearly contravene
the words of Article IV.
Furthermore, defendants misconstrue the purpose of
Section 1(D)(2)(c) and the SCLC. Article IV draws a
distinction between the promulgation and the
enforcement of regulations concerning student conduct.
Promulgation of regulations is obviously the province of
the SCLC. Since enforcement was the province of the
old SJC the President, in replacing the SJC, has used his
enforcement power, not his legislative power. The job of
the SCLC is to draft regulations such as the disruption
policy or the policy on possession of dangerous
weapons. It is the Committee of Fifteen that has
jurisdiction over setting up new institutions on the
campus, and the Committee of Fifteen has been working
for some while to draft a judicial system that can have
the approval of all Stanford constituencies. Hopefully
they will succeed, but if they do not, the President's
power under Article IV remains and is certainly in no
way limited by Section l(D)2(c).
The Founding Grant
The next argument of defendants is based on a 1902
amendment to the University trusts made by Mrs. Jane
Stanford. The amendment relied on by the defendants
states
"It shall be the duty of the Board of Trustees
to make general laws providing for the
government of the University and to provide
for just and equitable rules of discipline."
It is the argument of the defendants that the Campus

Spacc paid for by University Relations

Judicial Panel does not provide a "just and equitable"
system of discipline. This argument is not founded on
the procedures of the CJP, or upon the denial of any
particular right to defendants before the CJP. This
argument reasons that because the Legislative and
Judicial Charter was "created by the joint approval of
the student referendum, the Academic Council and the
President . . . , it was then seen as necessary to have such
a tripartite agreement to assure just and equitable rules
of discipline." In other words defendants argue that, the
rules of the CJP itself must not only be just and
equitable but the method of arriving at them must be
just and equitable as well. Defendants argue further that
the only just and equitable method of arriving at rules is
by having the rules approved by the University's three
main constituencies.
There are many problems, however, with this
reasoning. First, the trust amendment refers to the rules
themselves, not the method of arriving at them, and
there is no argument that the rules of the CJP do not fall
within the general terms of "just and equitable."
Second, even if we were to interpret the trust
amendment as providing that the rules must be arrived at
is a just and equitable manner, there was certainly no
hint in 1902 when the amendment was made that this
meant participation by students. Admittedly there are
many good reasons for why students should have
decision-making authority in many areas of University
life. The concept, however, that student power be
exercised in a particular manner, a tripartite agreement,
rather than through the appearance of randomly selected
students on the Campus Judicial Panel — does not
follow.
Next, we must remember that the students did
approve the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968
including Article IV which recognized the power of the
President to do just what he has done here.
Finally, if further student power must be found in
the establishment of the CJP, there was inherent in the
SJC a student power to destroy that institution. The use
of that power is why we are where we are today.
The Effect of Extraordinary Circumstances
The final argument that defendants make is the one
that has given us the most difficulty. Essentially, it
asserts that the President's residual authority in
extraordinary circumstances can only be used to meet
those circumstances. The defendants argue that the
President's residual authority could only be used to set
up an institution as much like the defunct SJC as
possible. In other words, if the refusal of the Student
Senate had caused the lack of student members, the
President could only appoint student members to the
selection committee; perhaps, alternatively, to appoint
the students directly to the SJC itself; or, conceivably,
to have randomly selected students chosen for one or
the other position. This argument has a considerable
appeal since it is much easier to modify existing
institutions than to set up wholly new ones. This
argument, however, involves serious problems. First,
nowhere in the Legislative and Judicial Charter, or any
other document which binds the President, is such a
restriction placed on his Article IV power.
Moreover, the number and possible means by which
the President could create systems arguably "as much as
possible like the SJC" is so large that it is difficult to lay
down standards by which his choice might be judged
especially inasmuch as this decision could be made only
after the fact by the judicial pody - presumably after
considerable effort, energy and time had gone into
litigation before it.
Nevertheless, we hold that the Presidents' Article IV
power could only have been used in a reasonable
response to the extraordinary circumstances which faced
him. This, however, does not help the defendants
because the crisis which the President faced when he set
up the CJP, though triggered by the failure of the
Student Senate to make its appointments, was
considerable broader than the mere lack of student
members on the SJC selection committee.
The Situation in Mid-November
In mid-November of this academic year, when the
Student Senate for the first time announced that it
would refuse to appoint its members to the slection
committee for the SJC, the President was clearly
confronted by an "extraordinary circumstance" within
the meaning of Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter. The SJC then was dead, and the President quite
rightly regarded it as a matter of some importance to set
up a substitute body. Unfortunately, the Student Senate
had not only refused to appoint its members to the
selection committee, it and its predecessor had
previously failed to appoint them for approximately
eight months from the time the appointment would have
been made in the normal course of Business. During this
eight month period, the President had personally and
through intermediaries urged again and again that the
student members of the SJC selection committee be
appointed. By the time he was finally refused, (and the
situation was in doubt until the very last evening) a
substantial backlog of cases had built up for the new
SJC. The argument can be made that what the President
should have done was to appoint the student members in
April so that the new SJC could have been formed on
time. We arc convinced, however, that had he dones so,
he would have incurred every bit as much, if not more
criticism on the campus for being precipious than he
now has for having delayed too long. The President
studiously and carefully maintained the view that he
would do nothing whatever to jeopardize the SJC,
although the backlog continued to build up until the time
of the final Senate refusal, it had reached sixteen cases -
twice as many as the SJC had been able to adjudicate in
the entire previous year. We, nonetheless, cannot say
that the President's attitude and actions were wrong in
any respect.
In any event, when the time came for the President
finally to act. he was confronted with the situation far
worse than the sudden disappearance of the SJC. We
cannot ignore the obvious fact that the SJC, even under
the best conditions, could not keep up with its calendar
of cases, and certainly had the President ignored the
Student Senate action and constituted the SJC himself,
the conditions would not have been at their best, so far
as the cooperation of at least some of the student body
was concerned. Indeed, it is likely that even had the
Student Senate appointed its members, the SJC would
shortly have fallen because of its inability to handle its
caseload. It is far more likely that, with the backlog of
cases that had accumulated and the additional doubts as
to its legitimacy among the student body, the

reconstituted SJC would have failed even more quickly.
The very idea of a nine member body both deciding
questions of fact and their own rules of evidence in open
hearing raises so many problems of time and of
complexity that it is frankly quite surprising that the
SJC lasted as long as it did. We are convinced that the
President could consider this in setting up a new body,
the need for whose existence was very clearly not of his
making and in a situation which certainly constituted
"extraordinary circumstances" within the meaning of
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter.
The Structure of the CJP
This decision has two facets. First we consider the
structure of the CJP and second, the rights it affords to
defendants. So far as the structure of the CJP is
concerned, the major difference from the old SJC is the
CJP's use of hearing examiners to find the facts. First of
all, it should be pointed ut that there is nothing
intrinsically unfair to a student defendant in the use of a
hearing examiner as compared to the SJC's deciding the
facts of the case. It is true that where a hearing examiner
sits, no students help determine the facts. On the other
hand, however, faculty members do not sit to determine
the facts either — as they did on the SJC where they had
a majority.
Not only that, but the CJP defendant has a right to
move to disqualify the hearing examiner, a procedure
that was more than merely impracticable when dealing
with the whole SJC' In fact, in one case under the CJP
the chairman informed the defendant that he was.
Jr
prepared to disqualify the hearing examiner who knew a
prosecution witness — but the defense in that case\
refrained from making a motion to disqualify the£
examiner — as has every other defendant. Finally, as far
as we can tell at present, the percentage of acquittals
before the hearing examiners is at least as great, if not
greater, than before the SJC.
The use of hearing examiners is a standard
administrative practice, often handling issues as
important to the litigants as those adjudicated by the
SJC and now the CJP. It is not in equity that the CJP
hearing examiner system differs from that of the old SJC
structure but rather in the saving of time caused by
having one person rather than nine hear the facts of a
case and the additional fairness in having a dispassionate
attorney unconnected with campus issues decide the
facts. In the recent proceeding against Prof. Franklin
before The Advisory Board, criticism was directed
against the method of fact finding on the ground that
the Board was "to close" to the campus and was
personally knowledgeable about the issues. The hearing
examiner system is an effort to meet this problem. The
hearing examiners, though appointed by the President,
are in fact selected by a committee of law professors
appointed by the Dean of the Law School and having no
other connection with campus discipline.
Aside from the use of hearing officers, the remainder
of the structure of the CJP is strikingly similar to that of
the SJC. Where the SJC consisted of four students, four
faculty and a chairman from the law faculty, the CJP
consists of three students, three faculty and a chairman
also from the law faculty. We cannot see any decrease in
fairness because of this and we have already noticed in
our own operations that the difficulty of scheduling
meetings rises exponentially with increasing numbers on
the judicial body.
It is true also that the CJP results are technically in
the form of a recommendation to the President.
However this was equally true of the SJC. (Indeed this
was one of the major complaints of the Student Senate
in destroying the SJC). Not only is this required clearly
by University (and perhaps the outside civil) law, but
whatever political constraints actually separated during
the existence of the SJC which prevented the President
on any occasion from increasing a penalty which the SJC
had found, presumably act equally in the case of the
CJP.
The final complaint as to the structure of the CJP is
that certain decisions are made by the CJP without
hearing witnesses in person but rather only upon the
report of the hearing officer, the motivational
statements of the defendant, argument of counsel, and
written statements as to the relatively few factual
matters that can be in dispute before the CJP itself (as
distinguished of course, from the hearing officer). In
part this restriction on oral testimony as to facts before
the CJP was intended to prevent the prosecutor from
raising objections to the defense use of affidavits,
character reference letters, and the like. The restriction
also, however, recognizes that any taking of oral
testimony (aside from the motivational statement of the
defendant himself — which is guaranteed both by the
rules of the CJP and SJC) involves fact-finding by a
multiple member body and leads to the enormous
problems of time consumption and confusion of issues
that plagued the SJC. The fact is that if any serious
factual issues are disputed, the CJP has jurisdiction to
remand a case to the hearing officer for further fact
finding. The major issues that the CJP itself hears, such
as justification, severity of sentence and fairness, raise
difficult questions of law but do not raise serious factual
dispute.
The Rights of CJP Defendants
Apart from the reasonable explanations of the
structural differences between the CJP and the old SJC,
it should be noted that the legal rights of the student
defendant are virtually the same before both bodies.
Defendants go i lto considerable effort in their brief in
an attempt to show that, in fact, students have fewer
rights under the CJP than they had under the old SJC.
Most of their complaints, however, center on point s they
consider to be unclear and their main argument is that
the CJP may violate these rights. Our decision today
makes it quite clear that we expect in all matters
involving the civil liberties of students to respect
essentially the same rights as they had undr the SJC as
well as under "the Bill of Rights" of the ASSU
constitution (Article IV, Section 2).
So far as the latter document is concerned there are
only two rights in the ASSU constitution which seem in
any way to be unmet by the CJP procedures. The first is
the right of the student "to be assured that, unless the
defendant asks for an an open hearing, any matters of
facts which would tend to identify the person or persons
involved in the case would be kept confidential". The
CJP gives the Chairman the discretion to open such a
hearing without a student's consent. The present
Chairman lias stated that except in some kind of
extraordinary circumstance, which he cannot
contemplate and which presumably the ASSU
constitution could not contemplate either, he will not
exercise his discretion to open a hearing. We feel that
this resolves that problem and we trust that the
Chairman's successors will feel bound by this pledge.
The only other right guaranteed in the ASSU
constitution with which the CJP might seem to have
power to interfere is the right "to have an open
hearing." "An open hearing" surely means a hearing that
is not "closed," in the sense in which a defendant might
ask for a closed hearing to maintain confidentiality (see
LJC Article II F6, which makes this meaning explicit).
An open hearing, therefore, is a hearing which is not
secret: one whose proceedings can in some reasonable
way be observed or inspected by everyone. A normal,
and sufficient, condition for openness is the admission
of the media KZSU, Daily reporters, etc.
An "open hearing" in the colloquial sense of a
hearing any member of the community may attend is
not a right of the defendant. On the contrary, it is at
most a courtesy the CJP arguably owes the community,
unless extending that courtesy is found to be
incompatible with maintaining the minimum of order
and freedom from intimidation that are requisite for any
fair judicial proceeding. We are confident that this is
what both the SJC rule and the ASSU constitution
meant. The CJP "Procedures" (Section 6) do not speak
of an "open hearing" but of a hearing being, or not

being, "open to the public," and so do not even address
the question of an "open hearing" in the legally
important sense. This sense clearly must be covered. We
pledge that any defendant who desires an "open
hearing." ie.. a non-secret hearing, shall have one.
There are numerous other arguments that the defense
makes as to rights which are denied them under the CJP
proceeding. Defendants attorney, for instance, state:
"The subpoena power of the university
prosecutor is also apparently increased as
evidenced by the conduct in the Rafael Robles
hearing where a student was threatened with
disciplinary action for refusal to testify. . . ."
II indeed this were so, it would be a very serious matter.
In lact, so lar as we can determine, the event simply did
not happen. The student was never threatened with
disciplinary action for failure to testify. Indeed, he was
told that il lie was not willing to testify the case would
be dismissed before he was ever called (apparently he
was an essential witness to the prosecution's case.) In
tact, he did testily though he was obviously ambivalent
about doing so. (In any event, the hearing officer found
for the defense on that issue.)
In short, we find the civil rights of Stanford students
are in practice not abridged under the CJP rules and
procedures as here interpreted. The CJP dispite its
ditterent structure atfords at least equal rights as those
allorded by the SJC and meets all of the rights granted

Space pr id for by University Relations

to students in Article IV Seciton 2 of the ASSU
constitution.
Conclusion
The CJP is of course a body brought into existence
by extraordinary circumstances. We, more than almost
all other members of the community, would like it
replaced by a product of the Committee of Fifteen
which can be approved by all three University
Constituencies. Until this happens and regretably it
may be a long wait until consensus takes hold on the
campus - we unanimously hold that the CJP is a legal
and legitimate institution.

SEPARATE OPINION OF MARK EVANS AND JOHN
KAPLAN
We two formally have no vote in this case. One of us
is an alternate member, appointed to the Panel to sit in
case of unavailability or disqualification of one of the
student members; the other is the chairman, who has no
vote except in case of a lie. Nonetheless, in this separate
opinion, we wish to state our concurrence with the
unanimous opinion of those voting, and to make it clear
that we will act accordingly should our votes be required
on this issue.
This is a somewhat unusual proceeding and regretably
we have relatively little precedent to guide us in our
decision. Nonetheless the issue presented here - the
basic legality of the Campus Judicial Panel - is an
important one which must be decided.
Our Jurisdiction to Decide This Case
The University Administration has argued that we do
not have jurisdiction to decide our own legality since
this question of law can be decided in the first instance
only by the President of the University and, in the
second instance, by the civil courts, should a student
bring suit there alleging that his legal rights were
violated. On the other hand, as members of the CJP, we
are responsible for our own actions, and if we have been
asked by the President to participate in any illegal
enterprise, we have a very simple duty not to do so.
Moreover, if we were to participate in disciplining a
student who claims that we are without authority to
discipline him, that student could, under our rule 18,
bring a charge before us that he had been improperly
disciplined. In hearing such a charge we would in effect
be obliged to make a judgment on our own legitimacy,
(i.e., we would have to rule whether we are in fact "the
judicial system in effect," in the language of section IB
of our Procedures.) And if we could under our rules have
an obligation to make such a judgment, clearly we must
have the authority to make this judgment, if we have
any authority at all.
It is true that the problem of the remedy for an
illegally constituted CJP is a subtle one. If we were to
hand down an opinion seeking to bind our successors to
the illegality of the CJP, we would be exercising a
jurisdiction which we have disclaimed. It is possible that
the proper course of action to remedy an illegally
constituted CJP would simply be our resignations. In
any event, we need not decide this difficult question
because we have examined at great length the arguments
of the defendants and conclude that the CJP is legally
constituted under University "law".
The Basis of the CJP
We will begin with the theory under which the CJP is
constituted; then we will move on to discuss our reasons
for rejecting each of the several grounds under which the
defendants would have us hold this body illegal.
The CJP purports to be set up under the President's
"Residual Authority" contained in Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968, a charter which
was approved by the three major constituencies of the
University, the Student Body, the Faculty, and the
Administration. Article IV provides:
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority
and power of the President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing student conduct
at Stanford University, except in extraordinary
circumstances the SCLC and SJC shall have
primary responsibility for promulgating such
regulations and adjudicating violations thereof.
In short, Article IV binds the President to use the SJC
except in "extraordinary circumstances." In
extraordinary circumstances, however, the President
gnay "enforce regulations governing student conduct"
It is the President's theory that extraordinary
circumstances existed when the Student Senate, over a
period of some eight months, at first failed, and then
refused, to appoint the student members to the SJC
selection committee which would select the student
participants to bring the SJC into existence for that
year. We need not go into the rights and wrongs of the
Student Senate action. It has been defended before us as
merely a technique of exerting pressure upon the
President to do things that were morally or legally
correct. Regardless of its justification, it certainly
amounted to "extraordinary circumstances" within the
meaning of Article IV and hence gave the President the
power to set up a different judicial system.
This is not to say that the President was free to set up
a system that was intrinsically irrational or unfair. Aside
from any legal impediments to his power — which we
will discuss later - the fact is that within the University
community there are political checks upon the
President's power. In part, the students and, perhaps to a
greater extent, the faculty do exert influence in this type
of decision. Otherwise, it would be hard to see why any
chief executive officer would, if completely
unconstrained, set up a system as elaborate as the CJP
simply to do what he thought was correct. In any event,
we need not deal with that issue because the defendants
do not claim here that there is anything about the rules
or procedures of the CJP that is inherently irrational or
unfair. Their complaints are somewhat different.
The ASSU Constitution
The first major attack upon the legality of the
Campus Judicial Panel is that Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter, on which the CJP is
based,was limitedby Article IV of the ASSU constitution
passed and approved by the trustees and the president
subsequent to the Charter, in 1969. The ASSU
constitution, Article IV, Section 1, provides that
"The association (i.e. the student body] shall
recognize the authority of university judicial
bodies over members of the association only if
those judicial bodies shall have been approved
by two-thirds of those members of the
association voting in a general election."
It is the contention of the defendants that these words
which were accepted by the Trustees and President,
constitute a limitation on the President's power under
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter. We
disagree.
To be sure the words of the ASSU constitution on
their face support the defendants' position. When one
looks at the question somewhat more closely, however,
one finds insurmountable problems in accepting the
defendants reasoning.
First, it is clear that the President and Trustees did
not think they had given up any of the President's
residual power under Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter. Indeed, the residual authority of the
President has been vigorously defended by the Trustees
and President essentially since the very beginning of the
University and Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter was simply a recognition of this. To argue that
the Trustees and the President of the University had
agreed to place restrictions on this power without any
Qualifications for emereencies. extraordinary

circumstances or the like, qualifications appearing in
every other limitation of the Presidential power, is to ask
us to believe more than we can. This is especially true
since the consequence of accepting this argument is
that no judicial body at all could be established to
replace the defunct SJC unless it could muster a
two-thirds vote of the students. This might well leave the
University permanently without any means of enforcing
discipline on the campus - a result that no constituency
of the University has supported.
Secondly, the ASSU constitution, as a whole, was
obviously not intended to affect student rights with
respect to those of any other constituency of the
University. A constitution is an allocation of power
within a constituency, and here the constituency was the
student body. The provision requiring a two-thirds vote
of the student body simply determines how the student
body can exercise what power it holds under other
university arrangements; it does not increase the power
of the student body by giving it (indeed, one student
more than one third of those voting) any additional
power which, as a constituency, the students did not
have before Article IV of the ASSU constitution. The
ASSU constitution has the effect of making clear what
was not clear earlier — that is if the student constituency
were asked to approve any judicial body, a simple
majority vote would not be sufficient. The CJP is
founded on an entirely different provision of University
law, the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968 and no
allocation of power and competence within any one
constituency can change this.
This is especially clear in this case since one of the
major constituencies of the University, the Faculty, is
completely ignored by the defense's reading of Article
IV of the ASSU constitution. The Faculty was a party to
the Legislative and Judicial Charter, and had a
continuing interest in that Charter. It had voted for the
President's Article IV power and cannot now be told
that, without any notice to it, an agreement between the
students and the President had changed the rules it had
adopted.
The Academic Senate had already adhered to this
view in acknowledging the legitimacy of the Campus
Judicial Panel. In its resolution of February 17, 1972,
(published in Campus Reports February 23, page 2,
Senate Report (No. 9) the Academic Senate requested
"the prompt prosecution [of certain cases] through
appropriate judicial mechanisms including the Campus
Judicial Panel." The legislative history of this resolution
makes its meaning clear. It was pointed out that the
wording prejudged the legitimacy of the CJP, which had
not yet been authoritatively decided. Despite this, the
resolution carried by a vote of 36 to 1, with three
abstentions. Indeed had the President and the student
body purported to limit Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, they might be in breach of
contract with the faculty.
The conclusion that the ASSU constitution was never
intended as a restriction upon the residual authority of
the President is buttressed by the actions of the Student
Senate itself. It is conceded that the Student Senate, in
refusing to make its appointments to the selection
committee for the SJC, had contemplated that the
President would set up another judicial body. Despite
this so far as we can tell, there was no hint of any
argument by anyone at the time that the ASSU
constitution (as distinguished from all sorts of principles
of fairness or political rights) would prevent the
President from doing this. We must note that the ASSU
constitution was adopted in 1969 within the memory of
many of those presently in the Student Senate. Their
silence on this issue, at a time when it would have been
most relevant, speaks volumes on the intent of the ASSU
Framers.
The Legislative and Judicial Charter
The next argument of the defendants is that the CJP
is illegally constituted because of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter itself. It is the theory of the defendants
that Section I(DX2X C ) of that Charter requires the
President "to go first to the SCLC to get his proposals
through". Section 1(D)(2)(c) provides as follows:
Interim regulations promulgated under Section
1(2) shall expire 90 days after publication
unless within that period the SCLC has taken
steps to promulgate a regulation in the same
area under the procedure specified in Section
D(l), in which case the interim regulation may
remain in effect until the conclusion of the
Section D(l) procedure.
It seems to us the subsection simply does not say what
the defendants contend. Moreover, even if it did, we
would still have the flat statement in Article IV that
"nothing in these articles shall be deemed to contravene
or limit the authority or power of the President.. .." in
extraordinary circumstances. The reading desired by the
defendants is certainly a limitation on the Presidential
authority sought to be imposed by another Article in the
same Charter. Nothing could more clearly contravene
the words of Article IV.
Furthermore, defendants misconstrue the purpose of
Section 1(D)(2)(c) and the SCLC. Article IV draws a
distinction between the promulgation and the
enforcement of regulations concerning student conduct.
Promulgation of regulations is obviously the province of
the SCLC. Since enforcement was the province of the
old SJC the President, in replacing the SJC, has used his
enforcement power, not his legislative power. The job of
the SCLC is to draft regulations such as the disruption
policy or the policy on possession of dangerous
weapons. It is the Committee of Fifteen that has
jurisdiction over setting up new institutions on the
campus, and the Committee of Fifteen has been working
for some while to draft a judicial system that can have
the approval of all Stanford constituencies. Hopefully
they will succeed, but if they do not, the President's
power under Article IV remains and is certainly in no
way limited by Section l(D)2(c).
The Founding Grant
The next argument of defendants is based on a 1902
amendment to the University trusts made by Mrs. Jane
Stanford. The amendment relied on by the defendants
states
"It shall be the duty of the Board of Trustees
to make general laws providing for the
government of the University and to provide
for just and equitable rules of discipline."
It is the argument of the defendants that the Campus

Spacc paid for by University Relations

Judicial Panel does not provide a "just and equitable"
system of discipline. This argument is not founded on
the procedures of the CJP, or upon the denial of any
particular right to defendants before the CJP. This
argument reasons that because the Legislative and
Judicial Charter was "created by the joint approval of
the student referendum, the Academic Council and the
President . . . , it was then seen as necessary to have such
a tripartite agreement to assure just and equitable rules
of discipline." In other words defendants argue that, the
rules of the CJP itself must not only be just and
equitable but the method of arriving at them must be
just and equitable as well. Defendants argue further that
the only just and equitable method of arriving at rules is
by having the rules approved by the University's three
main constituencies.
There are many problems, however, with this
reasoning. First, the trust amendment refers to the rules
themselves, not the method of arriving at them, and
there is no argument that the rules of the CJP do not fall
within the general terms of "just and equitable."
Second, even if we were to interpret the trust
amendment as providing that the rules must be arrived at
is a just and equitable manner, there was certainly no
hint in 1902 when the amendment was made that this
meant participation by students. Admittedly there are
many good reasons for why students should have
decision-making authority in many areas of University
life. The concept, however, that student power be
exercised in a particular manner, a tripartite agreement,
rather than through the appearance of randomly selected
students on the Campus Judicial Panel — does not
follow.
Next, we must remember that the students did
approve the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968
including Article IV which recognized the power of the
President to do just what he has done here.
Finally, if further student power must be found in
the establishment of the CJP, there was inherent in the
SJC a student power to destroy that institution. The use
of that power is why we are where we are today.
The Effect of Extraordinary Circumstances
The final argument that defendants make is the one
that has given us the most difficulty. Essentially, it
asserts that the President's residual authority in
extraordinary circumstances can only be used to meet
those circumstances. The defendants argue that the
President's residual authority could only be used to set
up an institution as much like the defunct SJC as
possible. In other words, if the refusal of the Student
Senate had caused the lack of student members, the
President could only appoint student members to the
selection committee; perhaps, alternatively, to appoint
the students directly to the SJC itself; or, conceivably,
to have randomly selected students chosen for one or
the other position. This argument has a considerable
appeal since it is much easier to modify existing
institutions than to set up wholly new ones. This
argument, however, involves serious problems. First,
nowhere in the Legislative and Judicial Charter, or any
other document which binds the President, is such a
restriction placed on his Article IV power.
Moreover, the number and possible means by which
the President could create systems arguably "as much as
possible like the SJC" is so large that it is difficult to lay
down standards by which his choice might be judged
especially inasmuch as this decision could be made only
after the fact by the judicial pody - presumably after
considerable effort, energy and time had gone into
litigation before it.
Nevertheless, we hold that the Presidents' Article IV
power could only have been used in a reasonable
response to the extraordinary circumstances which faced
him. This, however, does not help the defendants
because the crisis which the President faced when he set
up the CJP, though triggered by the failure of the
Student Senate to make its appointments, was
considerable broader than the mere lack of student
members on the SJC selection committee.
The Situation in Mid-November
In mid-November of this academic year, when the
Student Senate for the first time announced that it
would refuse to appoint its members to the slection
committee for the SJC, the President was clearly
confronted by an "extraordinary circumstance" within
the meaning of Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter. The SJC then was dead, and the President quite
rightly regarded it as a matter of some importance to set
up a substitute body. Unfortunately, the Student Senate
had not only refused to appoint its members to the
selection committee, it and its predecessor had
previously failed to appoint them for approximately
eight months from the time the appointment would have
been made in the normal course of Business. During this
eight month period, the President had personally and
through intermediaries urged again and again that the
student members of the SJC selection committee be
appointed. By the time he was finally refused, (and the
situation was in doubt until the very last evening) a
substantial backlog of cases had built up for the new
SJC. The argument can be made that what the President
should have done was to appoint the student members in
April so that the new SJC could have been formed on
time. We arc convinced, however, that had he dones so,
he would have incurred every bit as much, if not more
criticism on the campus for being precipious than he
now has for having delayed too long. The President
studiously and carefully maintained the view that he
would do nothing whatever to jeopardize the SJC,
although the backlog continued to build up until the time
of the final Senate refusal, it had reached sixteen cases -
twice as many as the SJC had been able to adjudicate in
the entire previous year. We, nonetheless, cannot say
that the President's attitude and actions were wrong in
any respect.
In any event, when the time came for the President
finally to act. he was confronted with the situation far
worse than the sudden disappearance of the SJC. We
cannot ignore the obvious fact that the SJC, even under
the best conditions, could not keep up with its calendar
of cases, and certainly had the President ignored the
Student Senate action and constituted the SJC himself,
the conditions would not have been at their best, so far
as the cooperation of at least some of the student body
was concerned. Indeed, it is likely that even had the
Student Senate appointed its members, the SJC would
shortly have fallen because of its inability to handle its
caseload. It is far more likely that, with the backlog of
cases that had accumulated and the additional doubts as
to its legitimacy among the student body, the

reconstituted SJC would have failed even more quickly.
The very idea of a nine member body both deciding
questions of fact and their own rules of evidence in open
hearing raises so many problems of time and of
complexity that it is frankly quite surprising that the
SJC lasted as long as it did. We are convinced that the
President could consider this in setting up a new body,
the need for whose existence was very clearly not of his
making and in a situation which certainly constituted
"extraordinary circumstances" within the meaning of
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter.
The Structure of the CJP
This decision has two facets. First we consider the
structure of the CJP and second, the rights it affords to
defendants. So far as the structure of the CJP is
concerned, the major difference from the old SJC is the
CJP's use of hearing examiners to find the facts. First of
all, it should be pointed ut that there is nothing
intrinsically unfair to a student defendant in the use of a
hearing examiner as compared to the SJC's deciding the
facts of the case. It is true that where a hearing examiner
sits, no students help determine the facts. On the other
hand, however, faculty members do not sit to determine
the facts either — as they did on the SJC where they had
a majority.
Not only that, but the CJP defendant has a right to
move to disqualify the hearing examiner, a procedure
that was more than merely impracticable when dealing
with the whole SJC' In fact, in one case under the CJP
the chairman informed the defendant that he was.
Jr
prepared to disqualify the hearing examiner who knew a
prosecution witness — but the defense in that case\
refrained from making a motion to disqualify the£
examiner — as has every other defendant. Finally, as far
as we can tell at present, the percentage of acquittals
before the hearing examiners is at least as great, if not
greater, than before the SJC.
The use of hearing examiners is a standard
administrative practice, often handling issues as
important to the litigants as those adjudicated by the
SJC and now the CJP. It is not in equity that the CJP
hearing examiner system differs from that of the old SJC
structure but rather in the saving of time caused by
having one person rather than nine hear the facts of a
case and the additional fairness in having a dispassionate
attorney unconnected with campus issues decide the
facts. In the recent proceeding against Prof. Franklin
before The Advisory Board, criticism was directed
against the method of fact finding on the ground that
the Board was "to close" to the campus and was
personally knowledgeable about the issues. The hearing
examiner system is an effort to meet this problem. The
hearing examiners, though appointed by the President,
are in fact selected by a committee of law professors
appointed by the Dean of the Law School and having no
other connection with campus discipline.
Aside from the use of hearing officers, the remainder
of the structure of the CJP is strikingly similar to that of
the SJC. Where the SJC consisted of four students, four
faculty and a chairman from the law faculty, the CJP
consists of three students, three faculty and a chairman
also from the law faculty. We cannot see any decrease in
fairness because of this and we have already noticed in
our own operations that the difficulty of scheduling
meetings rises exponentially with increasing numbers on
the judicial body.
It is true also that the CJP results are technically in
the form of a recommendation to the President.
However this was equally true of the SJC. (Indeed this
was one of the major complaints of the Student Senate
in destroying the SJC). Not only is this required clearly
by University (and perhaps the outside civil) law, but
whatever political constraints actually separated during
the existence of the SJC which prevented the President
on any occasion from increasing a penalty which the SJC
had found, presumably act equally in the case of the
CJP.
The final complaint as to the structure of the CJP is
that certain decisions are made by the CJP without
hearing witnesses in person but rather only upon the
report of the hearing officer, the motivational
statements of the defendant, argument of counsel, and
written statements as to the relatively few factual
matters that can be in dispute before the CJP itself (as
distinguished of course, from the hearing officer). In
part this restriction on oral testimony as to facts before
the CJP was intended to prevent the prosecutor from
raising objections to the defense use of affidavits,
character reference letters, and the like. The restriction
also, however, recognizes that any taking of oral
testimony (aside from the motivational statement of the
defendant himself — which is guaranteed both by the
rules of the CJP and SJC) involves fact-finding by a
multiple member body and leads to the enormous
problems of time consumption and confusion of issues
that plagued the SJC. The fact is that if any serious
factual issues are disputed, the CJP has jurisdiction to
remand a case to the hearing officer for further fact
finding. The major issues that the CJP itself hears, such
as justification, severity of sentence and fairness, raise
difficult questions of law but do not raise serious factual
dispute.
The Rights of CJP Defendants
Apart from the reasonable explanations of the
structural differences between the CJP and the old SJC,
it should be noted that the legal rights of the student
defendant are virtually the same before both bodies.
Defendants go i lto considerable effort in their brief in
an attempt to show that, in fact, students have fewer
rights under the CJP than they had under the old SJC.
Most of their complaints, however, center on point s they
consider to be unclear and their main argument is that
the CJP may violate these rights. Our decision today
makes it quite clear that we expect in all matters
involving the civil liberties of students to respect
essentially the same rights as they had undr the SJC as
well as under "the Bill of Rights" of the ASSU
constitution (Article IV, Section 2).
So far as the latter document is concerned there are
only two rights in the ASSU constitution which seem in
any way to be unmet by the CJP procedures. The first is
the right of the student "to be assured that, unless the
defendant asks for an an open hearing, any matters of
facts which would tend to identify the person or persons
involved in the case would be kept confidential". The
CJP gives the Chairman the discretion to open such a
hearing without a student's consent. The present
Chairman lias stated that except in some kind of
extraordinary circumstance, which he cannot
contemplate and which presumably the ASSU
constitution could not contemplate either, he will not
exercise his discretion to open a hearing. We feel that
this resolves that problem and we trust that the
Chairman's successors will feel bound by this pledge.
The only other right guaranteed in the ASSU
constitution with which the CJP might seem to have
power to interfere is the right "to have an open
hearing." "An open hearing" surely means a hearing that
is not "closed," in the sense in which a defendant might
ask for a closed hearing to maintain confidentiality (see
LJC Article II F6, which makes this meaning explicit).
An open hearing, therefore, is a hearing which is not
secret: one whose proceedings can in some reasonable
way be observed or inspected by everyone. A normal,
and sufficient, condition for openness is the admission
of the media KZSU, Daily reporters, etc.
An "open hearing" in the colloquial sense of a
hearing any member of the community may attend is
not a right of the defendant. On the contrary, it is at
most a courtesy the CJP arguably owes the community,
unless extending that courtesy is found to be
incompatible with maintaining the minimum of order
and freedom from intimidation that are requisite for any
fair judicial proceeding. We are confident that this is
what both the SJC rule and the ASSU constitution
meant. The CJP "Procedures" (Section 6) do not speak
of an "open hearing" but of a hearing being, or not

being, "open to the public," and so do not even address
the question of an "open hearing" in the legally
important sense. This sense clearly must be covered. We
pledge that any defendant who desires an "open
hearing." ie.. a non-secret hearing, shall have one.
There are numerous other arguments that the defense
makes as to rights which are denied them under the CJP
proceeding. Defendants attorney, for instance, state:
"The subpoena power of the university
prosecutor is also apparently increased as
evidenced by the conduct in the Rafael Robles
hearing where a student was threatened with
disciplinary action for refusal to testify. . . ."
II indeed this were so, it would be a very serious matter.
In lact, so lar as we can determine, the event simply did
not happen. The student was never threatened with
disciplinary action for failure to testify. Indeed, he was
told that il lie was not willing to testify the case would
be dismissed before he was ever called (apparently he
was an essential witness to the prosecution's case.) In
tact, he did testily though he was obviously ambivalent
about doing so. (In any event, the hearing officer found
for the defense on that issue.)
In short, we find the civil rights of Stanford students
are in practice not abridged under the CJP rules and
procedures as here interpreted. The CJP dispite its
ditterent structure atfords at least equal rights as those
allorded by the SJC and meets all of the rights granted

Space pr id for by University Relations

to students in Article IV Seciton 2 of the ASSU
constitution.
Conclusion
The CJP is of course a body brought into existence
by extraordinary circumstances. We, more than almost
all other members of the community, would like it
replaced by a product of the Committee of Fifteen
which can be approved by all three University
Constituencies. Until this happens and regretably it
may be a long wait until consensus takes hold on the
campus - we unanimously hold that the CJP is a legal
and legitimate institution.

SEPARATE OPINION OF MARK EVANS AND JOHN
KAPLAN
We two formally have no vote in this case. One of us
is an alternate member, appointed to the Panel to sit in
case of unavailability or disqualification of one of the
student members; the other is the chairman, who has no
vote except in case of a lie. Nonetheless, in this separate
opinion, we wish to state our concurrence with the
unanimous opinion of those voting, and to make it clear
that we will act accordingly should our votes be required
on this issue.
This is a somewhat unusual proceeding and regretably
we have relatively little precedent to guide us in our
decision. Nonetheless the issue presented here - the
basic legality of the Campus Judicial Panel - is an
important one which must be decided.
Our Jurisdiction to Decide This Case
The University Administration has argued that we do
not have jurisdiction to decide our own legality since
this question of law can be decided in the first instance
only by the President of the University and, in the
second instance, by the civil courts, should a student
bring suit there alleging that his legal rights were
violated. On the other hand, as members of the CJP, we
are responsible for our own actions, and if we have been
asked by the President to participate in any illegal
enterprise, we have a very simple duty not to do so.
Moreover, if we were to participate in disciplining a
student who claims that we are without authority to
discipline him, that student could, under our rule 18,
bring a charge before us that he had been improperly
disciplined. In hearing such a charge we would in effect
be obliged to make a judgment on our own legitimacy,
(i.e., we would have to rule whether we are in fact "the
judicial system in effect," in the language of section IB
of our Procedures.) And if we could under our rules have
an obligation to make such a judgment, clearly we must
have the authority to make this judgment, if we have
any authority at all.
It is true that the problem of the remedy for an
illegally constituted CJP is a subtle one. If we were to
hand down an opinion seeking to bind our successors to
the illegality of the CJP, we would be exercising a
jurisdiction which we have disclaimed. It is possible that
the proper course of action to remedy an illegally
constituted CJP would simply be our resignations. In
any event, we need not decide this difficult question
because we have examined at great length the arguments
of the defendants and conclude that the CJP is legally
constituted under University "law".
The Basis of the CJP
We will begin with the theory under which the CJP is
constituted; then we will move on to discuss our reasons
for rejecting each of the several grounds under which the
defendants would have us hold this body illegal.
The CJP purports to be set up under the President's
"Residual Authority" contained in Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968, a charter which
was approved by the three major constituencies of the
University, the Student Body, the Faculty, and the
Administration. Article IV provides:
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority
and power of the President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing student conduct
at Stanford University, except in extraordinary
circumstances the SCLC and SJC shall have
primary responsibility for promulgating such
regulations and adjudicating violations thereof.
In short, Article IV binds the President to use the SJC
except in "extraordinary circumstances." In
extraordinary circumstances, however, the President
gnay "enforce regulations governing student conduct"
It is the President's theory that extraordinary
circumstances existed when the Student Senate, over a
period of some eight months, at first failed, and then
refused, to appoint the student members to the SJC
selection committee which would select the student
participants to bring the SJC into existence for that
year. We need not go into the rights and wrongs of the
Student Senate action. It has been defended before us as
merely a technique of exerting pressure upon the
President to do things that were morally or legally
correct. Regardless of its justification, it certainly
amounted to "extraordinary circumstances" within the
meaning of Article IV and hence gave the President the
power to set up a different judicial system.
This is not to say that the President was free to set up
a system that was intrinsically irrational or unfair. Aside
from any legal impediments to his power — which we
will discuss later - the fact is that within the University
community there are political checks upon the
President's power. In part, the students and, perhaps to a
greater extent, the faculty do exert influence in this type
of decision. Otherwise, it would be hard to see why any
chief executive officer would, if completely
unconstrained, set up a system as elaborate as the CJP
simply to do what he thought was correct. In any event,
we need not deal with that issue because the defendants
do not claim here that there is anything about the rules
or procedures of the CJP that is inherently irrational or
unfair. Their complaints are somewhat different.
The ASSU Constitution
The first major attack upon the legality of the
Campus Judicial Panel is that Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter, on which the CJP is
based,was limitedby Article IV of the ASSU constitution
passed and approved by the trustees and the president
subsequent to the Charter, in 1969. The ASSU
constitution, Article IV, Section 1, provides that
"The association (i.e. the student body] shall
recognize the authority of university judicial
bodies over members of the association only if
those judicial bodies shall have been approved
by two-thirds of those members of the
association voting in a general election."
It is the contention of the defendants that these words
which were accepted by the Trustees and President,
constitute a limitation on the President's power under
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter. We
disagree.
To be sure the words of the ASSU constitution on
their face support the defendants' position. When one
looks at the question somewhat more closely, however,
one finds insurmountable problems in accepting the
defendants reasoning.
First, it is clear that the President and Trustees did
not think they had given up any of the President's
residual power under Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter. Indeed, the residual authority of the
President has been vigorously defended by the Trustees
and President essentially since the very beginning of the
University and Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter was simply a recognition of this. To argue that
the Trustees and the President of the University had
agreed to place restrictions on this power without any
Qualifications for emereencies. extraordinary

circumstances or the like, qualifications appearing in
every other limitation of the Presidential power, is to ask
us to believe more than we can. This is especially true
since the consequence of accepting this argument is
that no judicial body at all could be established to
replace the defunct SJC unless it could muster a
two-thirds vote of the students. This might well leave the
University permanently without any means of enforcing
discipline on the campus - a result that no constituency
of the University has supported.
Secondly, the ASSU constitution, as a whole, was
obviously not intended to affect student rights with
respect to those of any other constituency of the
University. A constitution is an allocation of power
within a constituency, and here the constituency was the
student body. The provision requiring a two-thirds vote
of the student body simply determines how the student
body can exercise what power it holds under other
university arrangements; it does not increase the power
of the student body by giving it (indeed, one student
more than one third of those voting) any additional
power which, as a constituency, the students did not
have before Article IV of the ASSU constitution. The
ASSU constitution has the effect of making clear what
was not clear earlier — that is if the student constituency
were asked to approve any judicial body, a simple
majority vote would not be sufficient. The CJP is
founded on an entirely different provision of University
law, the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968 and no
allocation of power and competence within any one
constituency can change this.
This is especially clear in this case since one of the
major constituencies of the University, the Faculty, is
completely ignored by the defense's reading of Article
IV of the ASSU constitution. The Faculty was a party to
the Legislative and Judicial Charter, and had a
continuing interest in that Charter. It had voted for the
President's Article IV power and cannot now be told
that, without any notice to it, an agreement between the
students and the President had changed the rules it had
adopted.
The Academic Senate had already adhered to this
view in acknowledging the legitimacy of the Campus
Judicial Panel. In its resolution of February 17, 1972,
(published in Campus Reports February 23, page 2,
Senate Report (No. 9) the Academic Senate requested
"the prompt prosecution [of certain cases] through
appropriate judicial mechanisms including the Campus
Judicial Panel." The legislative history of this resolution
makes its meaning clear. It was pointed out that the
wording prejudged the legitimacy of the CJP, which had
not yet been authoritatively decided. Despite this, the
resolution carried by a vote of 36 to 1, with three
abstentions. Indeed had the President and the student
body purported to limit Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, they might be in breach of
contract with the faculty.
The conclusion that the ASSU constitution was never
intended as a restriction upon the residual authority of
the President is buttressed by the actions of the Student
Senate itself. It is conceded that the Student Senate, in
refusing to make its appointments to the selection
committee for the SJC, had contemplated that the
President would set up another judicial body. Despite
this so far as we can tell, there was no hint of any
argument by anyone at the time that the ASSU
constitution (as distinguished from all sorts of principles
of fairness or political rights) would prevent the
President from doing this. We must note that the ASSU
constitution was adopted in 1969 within the memory of
many of those presently in the Student Senate. Their
silence on this issue, at a time when it would have been
most relevant, speaks volumes on the intent of the ASSU
Framers.
The Legislative and Judicial Charter
The next argument of the defendants is that the CJP
is illegally constituted because of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter itself. It is the theory of the defendants
that Section I(DX2X C ) of that Charter requires the
President "to go first to the SCLC to get his proposals
through". Section 1(D)(2)(c) provides as follows:
Interim regulations promulgated under Section
1(2) shall expire 90 days after publication
unless within that period the SCLC has taken
steps to promulgate a regulation in the same
area under the procedure specified in Section
D(l), in which case the interim regulation may
remain in effect until the conclusion of the
Section D(l) procedure.
It seems to us the subsection simply does not say what
the defendants contend. Moreover, even if it did, we
would still have the flat statement in Article IV that
"nothing in these articles shall be deemed to contravene
or limit the authority or power of the President.. .." in
extraordinary circumstances. The reading desired by the
defendants is certainly a limitation on the Presidential
authority sought to be imposed by another Article in the
same Charter. Nothing could more clearly contravene
the words of Article IV.
Furthermore, defendants misconstrue the purpose of
Section 1(D)(2)(c) and the SCLC. Article IV draws a
distinction between the promulgation and the
enforcement of regulations concerning student conduct.
Promulgation of regulations is obviously the province of
the SCLC. Since enforcement was the province of the
old SJC the President, in replacing the SJC, has used his
enforcement power, not his legislative power. The job of
the SCLC is to draft regulations such as the disruption
policy or the policy on possession of dangerous
weapons. It is the Committee of Fifteen that has
jurisdiction over setting up new institutions on the
campus, and the Committee of Fifteen has been working
for some while to draft a judicial system that can have
the approval of all Stanford constituencies. Hopefully
they will succeed, but if they do not, the President's
power under Article IV remains and is certainly in no
way limited by Section l(D)2(c).
The Founding Grant
The next argument of defendants is based on a 1902
amendment to the University trusts made by Mrs. Jane
Stanford. The amendment relied on by the defendants
states
"It shall be the duty of the Board of Trustees
to make general laws providing for the
government of the University and to provide
for just and equitable rules of discipline."
It is the argument of the defendants that the Campus

Spacc paid for by University Relations

Judicial Panel does not provide a "just and equitable"
system of discipline. This argument is not founded on
the procedures of the CJP, or upon the denial of any
particular right to defendants before the CJP. This
argument reasons that because the Legislative and
Judicial Charter was "created by the joint approval of
the student referendum, the Academic Council and the
President . . . , it was then seen as necessary to have such
a tripartite agreement to assure just and equitable rules
of discipline." In other words defendants argue that, the
rules of the CJP itself must not only be just and
equitable but the method of arriving at them must be
just and equitable as well. Defendants argue further that
the only just and equitable method of arriving at rules is
by having the rules approved by the University's three
main constituencies.
There are many problems, however, with this
reasoning. First, the trust amendment refers to the rules
themselves, not the method of arriving at them, and
there is no argument that the rules of the CJP do not fall
within the general terms of "just and equitable."
Second, even if we were to interpret the trust
amendment as providing that the rules must be arrived at
is a just and equitable manner, there was certainly no
hint in 1902 when the amendment was made that this
meant participation by students. Admittedly there are
many good reasons for why students should have
decision-making authority in many areas of University
life. The concept, however, that student power be
exercised in a particular manner, a tripartite agreement,
rather than through the appearance of randomly selected
students on the Campus Judicial Panel — does not
follow.
Next, we must remember that the students did
approve the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968
including Article IV which recognized the power of the
President to do just what he has done here.
Finally, if further student power must be found in
the establishment of the CJP, there was inherent in the
SJC a student power to destroy that institution. The use
of that power is why we are where we are today.
The Effect of Extraordinary Circumstances
The final argument that defendants make is the one
that has given us the most difficulty. Essentially, it
asserts that the President's residual authority in
extraordinary circumstances can only be used to meet
those circumstances. The defendants argue that the
President's residual authority could only be used to set
up an institution as much like the defunct SJC as
possible. In other words, if the refusal of the Student
Senate had caused the lack of student members, the
President could only appoint student members to the
selection committee; perhaps, alternatively, to appoint
the students directly to the SJC itself; or, conceivably,
to have randomly selected students chosen for one or
the other position. This argument has a considerable
appeal since it is much easier to modify existing
institutions than to set up wholly new ones. This
argument, however, involves serious problems. First,
nowhere in the Legislative and Judicial Charter, or any
other document which binds the President, is such a
restriction placed on his Article IV power.
Moreover, the number and possible means by which
the President could create systems arguably "as much as
possible like the SJC" is so large that it is difficult to lay
down standards by which his choice might be judged
especially inasmuch as this decision could be made only
after the fact by the judicial pody - presumably after
considerable effort, energy and time had gone into
litigation before it.
Nevertheless, we hold that the Presidents' Article IV
power could only have been used in a reasonable
response to the extraordinary circumstances which faced
him. This, however, does not help the defendants
because the crisis which the President faced when he set
up the CJP, though triggered by the failure of the
Student Senate to make its appointments, was
considerable broader than the mere lack of student
members on the SJC selection committee.
The Situation in Mid-November
In mid-November of this academic year, when the
Student Senate for the first time announced that it
would refuse to appoint its members to the slection
committee for the SJC, the President was clearly
confronted by an "extraordinary circumstance" within
the meaning of Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter. The SJC then was dead, and the President quite
rightly regarded it as a matter of some importance to set
up a substitute body. Unfortunately, the Student Senate
had not only refused to appoint its members to the
selection committee, it and its predecessor had
previously failed to appoint them for approximately
eight months from the time the appointment would have
been made in the normal course of Business. During this
eight month period, the President had personally and
through intermediaries urged again and again that the
student members of the SJC selection committee be
appointed. By the time he was finally refused, (and the
situation was in doubt until the very last evening) a
substantial backlog of cases had built up for the new
SJC. The argument can be made that what the President
should have done was to appoint the student members in
April so that the new SJC could have been formed on
time. We arc convinced, however, that had he dones so,
he would have incurred every bit as much, if not more
criticism on the campus for being precipious than he
now has for having delayed too long. The President
studiously and carefully maintained the view that he
would do nothing whatever to jeopardize the SJC,
although the backlog continued to build up until the time
of the final Senate refusal, it had reached sixteen cases -
twice as many as the SJC had been able to adjudicate in
the entire previous year. We, nonetheless, cannot say
that the President's attitude and actions were wrong in
any respect.
In any event, when the time came for the President
finally to act. he was confronted with the situation far
worse than the sudden disappearance of the SJC. We
cannot ignore the obvious fact that the SJC, even under
the best conditions, could not keep up with its calendar
of cases, and certainly had the President ignored the
Student Senate action and constituted the SJC himself,
the conditions would not have been at their best, so far
as the cooperation of at least some of the student body
was concerned. Indeed, it is likely that even had the
Student Senate appointed its members, the SJC would
shortly have fallen because of its inability to handle its
caseload. It is far more likely that, with the backlog of
cases that had accumulated and the additional doubts as
to its legitimacy among the student body, the

reconstituted SJC would have failed even more quickly.
The very idea of a nine member body both deciding
questions of fact and their own rules of evidence in open
hearing raises so many problems of time and of
complexity that it is frankly quite surprising that the
SJC lasted as long as it did. We are convinced that the
President could consider this in setting up a new body,
the need for whose existence was very clearly not of his
making and in a situation which certainly constituted
"extraordinary circumstances" within the meaning of
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter.
The Structure of the CJP
This decision has two facets. First we consider the
structure of the CJP and second, the rights it affords to
defendants. So far as the structure of the CJP is
concerned, the major difference from the old SJC is the
CJP's use of hearing examiners to find the facts. First of
all, it should be pointed ut that there is nothing
intrinsically unfair to a student defendant in the use of a
hearing examiner as compared to the SJC's deciding the
facts of the case. It is true that where a hearing examiner
sits, no students help determine the facts. On the other
hand, however, faculty members do not sit to determine
the facts either — as they did on the SJC where they had
a majority.
Not only that, but the CJP defendant has a right to
move to disqualify the hearing examiner, a procedure
that was more than merely impracticable when dealing
with the whole SJC' In fact, in one case under the CJP
the chairman informed the defendant that he was.
Jr
prepared to disqualify the hearing examiner who knew a
prosecution witness — but the defense in that case\
refrained from making a motion to disqualify the£
examiner — as has every other defendant. Finally, as far
as we can tell at present, the percentage of acquittals
before the hearing examiners is at least as great, if not
greater, than before the SJC.
The use of hearing examiners is a standard
administrative practice, often handling issues as
important to the litigants as those adjudicated by the
SJC and now the CJP. It is not in equity that the CJP
hearing examiner system differs from that of the old SJC
structure but rather in the saving of time caused by
having one person rather than nine hear the facts of a
case and the additional fairness in having a dispassionate
attorney unconnected with campus issues decide the
facts. In the recent proceeding against Prof. Franklin
before The Advisory Board, criticism was directed
against the method of fact finding on the ground that
the Board was "to close" to the campus and was
personally knowledgeable about the issues. The hearing
examiner system is an effort to meet this problem. The
hearing examiners, though appointed by the President,
are in fact selected by a committee of law professors
appointed by the Dean of the Law School and having no
other connection with campus discipline.
Aside from the use of hearing officers, the remainder
of the structure of the CJP is strikingly similar to that of
the SJC. Where the SJC consisted of four students, four
faculty and a chairman from the law faculty, the CJP
consists of three students, three faculty and a chairman
also from the law faculty. We cannot see any decrease in
fairness because of this and we have already noticed in
our own operations that the difficulty of scheduling
meetings rises exponentially with increasing numbers on
the judicial body.
It is true also that the CJP results are technically in
the form of a recommendation to the President.
However this was equally true of the SJC. (Indeed this
was one of the major complaints of the Student Senate
in destroying the SJC). Not only is this required clearly
by University (and perhaps the outside civil) law, but
whatever political constraints actually separated during
the existence of the SJC which prevented the President
on any occasion from increasing a penalty which the SJC
had found, presumably act equally in the case of the
CJP.
The final complaint as to the structure of the CJP is
that certain decisions are made by the CJP without
hearing witnesses in person but rather only upon the
report of the hearing officer, the motivational
statements of the defendant, argument of counsel, and
written statements as to the relatively few factual
matters that can be in dispute before the CJP itself (as
distinguished of course, from the hearing officer). In
part this restriction on oral testimony as to facts before
the CJP was intended to prevent the prosecutor from
raising objections to the defense use of affidavits,
character reference letters, and the like. The restriction
also, however, recognizes that any taking of oral
testimony (aside from the motivational statement of the
defendant himself — which is guaranteed both by the
rules of the CJP and SJC) involves fact-finding by a
multiple member body and leads to the enormous
problems of time consumption and confusion of issues
that plagued the SJC. The fact is that if any serious
factual issues are disputed, the CJP has jurisdiction to
remand a case to the hearing officer for further fact
finding. The major issues that the CJP itself hears, such
as justification, severity of sentence and fairness, raise
difficult questions of law but do not raise serious factual
dispute.
The Rights of CJP Defendants
Apart from the reasonable explanations of the
structural differences between the CJP and the old SJC,
it should be noted that the legal rights of the student
defendant are virtually the same before both bodies.
Defendants go i lto considerable effort in their brief in
an attempt to show that, in fact, students have fewer
rights under the CJP than they had under the old SJC.
Most of their complaints, however, center on point s they
consider to be unclear and their main argument is that
the CJP may violate these rights. Our decision today
makes it quite clear that we expect in all matters
involving the civil liberties of students to respect
essentially the same rights as they had undr the SJC as
well as under "the Bill of Rights" of the ASSU
constitution (Article IV, Section 2).
So far as the latter document is concerned there are
only two rights in the ASSU constitution which seem in
any way to be unmet by the CJP procedures. The first is
the right of the student "to be assured that, unless the
defendant asks for an an open hearing, any matters of
facts which would tend to identify the person or persons
involved in the case would be kept confidential". The
CJP gives the Chairman the discretion to open such a
hearing without a student's consent. The present
Chairman lias stated that except in some kind of
extraordinary circumstance, which he cannot
contemplate and which presumably the ASSU
constitution could not contemplate either, he will not
exercise his discretion to open a hearing. We feel that
this resolves that problem and we trust that the
Chairman's successors will feel bound by this pledge.
The only other right guaranteed in the ASSU
constitution with which the CJP might seem to have
power to interfere is the right "to have an open
hearing." "An open hearing" surely means a hearing that
is not "closed," in the sense in which a defendant might
ask for a closed hearing to maintain confidentiality (see
LJC Article II F6, which makes this meaning explicit).
An open hearing, therefore, is a hearing which is not
secret: one whose proceedings can in some reasonable
way be observed or inspected by everyone. A normal,
and sufficient, condition for openness is the admission
of the media KZSU, Daily reporters, etc.
An "open hearing" in the colloquial sense of a
hearing any member of the community may attend is
not a right of the defendant. On the contrary, it is at
most a courtesy the CJP arguably owes the community,
unless extending that courtesy is found to be
incompatible with maintaining the minimum of order
and freedom from intimidation that are requisite for any
fair judicial proceeding. We are confident that this is
what both the SJC rule and the ASSU constitution
meant. The CJP "Procedures" (Section 6) do not speak
of an "open hearing" but of a hearing being, or not

being, "open to the public," and so do not even address
the question of an "open hearing" in the legally
important sense. This sense clearly must be covered. We
pledge that any defendant who desires an "open
hearing." ie.. a non-secret hearing, shall have one.
There are numerous other arguments that the defense
makes as to rights which are denied them under the CJP
proceeding. Defendants attorney, for instance, state:
"The subpoena power of the university
prosecutor is also apparently increased as
evidenced by the conduct in the Rafael Robles
hearing where a student was threatened with
disciplinary action for refusal to testify. . . ."
II indeed this were so, it would be a very serious matter.
In lact, so lar as we can determine, the event simply did
not happen. The student was never threatened with
disciplinary action for failure to testify. Indeed, he was
told that il lie was not willing to testify the case would
be dismissed before he was ever called (apparently he
was an essential witness to the prosecution's case.) In
tact, he did testily though he was obviously ambivalent
about doing so. (In any event, the hearing officer found
for the defense on that issue.)
In short, we find the civil rights of Stanford students
are in practice not abridged under the CJP rules and
procedures as here interpreted. The CJP dispite its
ditterent structure atfords at least equal rights as those
allorded by the SJC and meets all of the rights granted

Space pr id for by University Relations

to students in Article IV Seciton 2 of the ASSU
constitution.
Conclusion
The CJP is of course a body brought into existence
by extraordinary circumstances. We, more than almost
all other members of the community, would like it
replaced by a product of the Committee of Fifteen
which can be approved by all three University
Constituencies. Until this happens and regretably it
may be a long wait until consensus takes hold on the
campus - we unanimously hold that the CJP is a legal
and legitimate institution.

SEPARATE OPINION OF MARK EVANS AND JOHN
KAPLAN
We two formally have no vote in this case. One of us
is an alternate member, appointed to the Panel to sit in
case of unavailability or disqualification of one of the
student members; the other is the chairman, who has no
vote except in case of a lie. Nonetheless, in this separate
opinion, we wish to state our concurrence with the
unanimous opinion of those voting, and to make it clear
that we will act accordingly should our votes be required
on this issue.
This is a somewhat unusual proceeding and regretably
we have relatively little precedent to guide us in our
decision. Nonetheless the issue presented here - the
basic legality of the Campus Judicial Panel - is an
important one which must be decided.
Our Jurisdiction to Decide This Case
The University Administration has argued that we do
not have jurisdiction to decide our own legality since
this question of law can be decided in the first instance
only by the President of the University and, in the
second instance, by the civil courts, should a student
bring suit there alleging that his legal rights were
violated. On the other hand, as members of the CJP, we
are responsible for our own actions, and if we have been
asked by the President to participate in any illegal
enterprise, we have a very simple duty not to do so.
Moreover, if we were to participate in disciplining a
student who claims that we are without authority to
discipline him, that student could, under our rule 18,
bring a charge before us that he had been improperly
disciplined. In hearing such a charge we would in effect
be obliged to make a judgment on our own legitimacy,
(i.e., we would have to rule whether we are in fact "the
judicial system in effect," in the language of section IB
of our Procedures.) And if we could under our rules have
an obligation to make such a judgment, clearly we must
have the authority to make this judgment, if we have
any authority at all.
It is true that the problem of the remedy for an
illegally constituted CJP is a subtle one. If we were to
hand down an opinion seeking to bind our successors to
the illegality of the CJP, we would be exercising a
jurisdiction which we have disclaimed. It is possible that
the proper course of action to remedy an illegally
constituted CJP would simply be our resignations. In
any event, we need not decide this difficult question
because we have examined at great length the arguments
of the defendants and conclude that the CJP is legally
constituted under University "law".
The Basis of the CJP
We will begin with the theory under which the CJP is
constituted; then we will move on to discuss our reasons
for rejecting each of the several grounds under which the
defendants would have us hold this body illegal.
The CJP purports to be set up under the President's
"Residual Authority" contained in Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968, a charter which
was approved by the three major constituencies of the
University, the Student Body, the Faculty, and the
Administration. Article IV provides:
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority
and power of the President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing student conduct
at Stanford University, except in extraordinary
circumstances the SCLC and SJC shall have
primary responsibility for promulgating such
regulations and adjudicating violations thereof.
In short, Article IV binds the President to use the SJC
except in "extraordinary circumstances." In
extraordinary circumstances, however, the President
gnay "enforce regulations governing student conduct"
It is the President's theory that extraordinary
circumstances existed when the Student Senate, over a
period of some eight months, at first failed, and then
refused, to appoint the student members to the SJC
selection committee which would select the student
participants to bring the SJC into existence for that
year. We need not go into the rights and wrongs of the
Student Senate action. It has been defended before us as
merely a technique of exerting pressure upon the
President to do things that were morally or legally
correct. Regardless of its justification, it certainly
amounted to "extraordinary circumstances" within the
meaning of Article IV and hence gave the President the
power to set up a different judicial system.
This is not to say that the President was free to set up
a system that was intrinsically irrational or unfair. Aside
from any legal impediments to his power — which we
will discuss later - the fact is that within the University
community there are political checks upon the
President's power. In part, the students and, perhaps to a
greater extent, the faculty do exert influence in this type
of decision. Otherwise, it would be hard to see why any
chief executive officer would, if completely
unconstrained, set up a system as elaborate as the CJP
simply to do what he thought was correct. In any event,
we need not deal with that issue because the defendants
do not claim here that there is anything about the rules
or procedures of the CJP that is inherently irrational or
unfair. Their complaints are somewhat different.
The ASSU Constitution
The first major attack upon the legality of the
Campus Judicial Panel is that Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter, on which the CJP is
based,was limitedby Article IV of the ASSU constitution
passed and approved by the trustees and the president
subsequent to the Charter, in 1969. The ASSU
constitution, Article IV, Section 1, provides that
"The association (i.e. the student body] shall
recognize the authority of university judicial
bodies over members of the association only if
those judicial bodies shall have been approved
by two-thirds of those members of the
association voting in a general election."
It is the contention of the defendants that these words
which were accepted by the Trustees and President,
constitute a limitation on the President's power under
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter. We
disagree.
To be sure the words of the ASSU constitution on
their face support the defendants' position. When one
looks at the question somewhat more closely, however,
one finds insurmountable problems in accepting the
defendants reasoning.
First, it is clear that the President and Trustees did
not think they had given up any of the President's
residual power under Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter. Indeed, the residual authority of the
President has been vigorously defended by the Trustees
and President essentially since the very beginning of the
University and Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter was simply a recognition of this. To argue that
the Trustees and the President of the University had
agreed to place restrictions on this power without any
Qualifications for emereencies. extraordinary

circumstances or the like, qualifications appearing in
every other limitation of the Presidential power, is to ask
us to believe more than we can. This is especially true
since the consequence of accepting this argument is
that no judicial body at all could be established to
replace the defunct SJC unless it could muster a
two-thirds vote of the students. This might well leave the
University permanently without any means of enforcing
discipline on the campus - a result that no constituency
of the University has supported.
Secondly, the ASSU constitution, as a whole, was
obviously not intended to affect student rights with
respect to those of any other constituency of the
University. A constitution is an allocation of power
within a constituency, and here the constituency was the
student body. The provision requiring a two-thirds vote
of the student body simply determines how the student
body can exercise what power it holds under other
university arrangements; it does not increase the power
of the student body by giving it (indeed, one student
more than one third of those voting) any additional
power which, as a constituency, the students did not
have before Article IV of the ASSU constitution. The
ASSU constitution has the effect of making clear what
was not clear earlier — that is if the student constituency
were asked to approve any judicial body, a simple
majority vote would not be sufficient. The CJP is
founded on an entirely different provision of University
law, the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968 and no
allocation of power and competence within any one
constituency can change this.
This is especially clear in this case since one of the
major constituencies of the University, the Faculty, is
completely ignored by the defense's reading of Article
IV of the ASSU constitution. The Faculty was a party to
the Legislative and Judicial Charter, and had a
continuing interest in that Charter. It had voted for the
President's Article IV power and cannot now be told
that, without any notice to it, an agreement between the
students and the President had changed the rules it had
adopted.
The Academic Senate had already adhered to this
view in acknowledging the legitimacy of the Campus
Judicial Panel. In its resolution of February 17, 1972,
(published in Campus Reports February 23, page 2,
Senate Report (No. 9) the Academic Senate requested
"the prompt prosecution [of certain cases] through
appropriate judicial mechanisms including the Campus
Judicial Panel." The legislative history of this resolution
makes its meaning clear. It was pointed out that the
wording prejudged the legitimacy of the CJP, which had
not yet been authoritatively decided. Despite this, the
resolution carried by a vote of 36 to 1, with three
abstentions. Indeed had the President and the student
body purported to limit Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, they might be in breach of
contract with the faculty.
The conclusion that the ASSU constitution was never
intended as a restriction upon the residual authority of
the President is buttressed by the actions of the Student
Senate itself. It is conceded that the Student Senate, in
refusing to make its appointments to the selection
committee for the SJC, had contemplated that the
President would set up another judicial body. Despite
this so far as we can tell, there was no hint of any
argument by anyone at the time that the ASSU
constitution (as distinguished from all sorts of principles
of fairness or political rights) would prevent the
President from doing this. We must note that the ASSU
constitution was adopted in 1969 within the memory of
many of those presently in the Student Senate. Their
silence on this issue, at a time when it would have been
most relevant, speaks volumes on the intent of the ASSU
Framers.
The Legislative and Judicial Charter
The next argument of the defendants is that the CJP
is illegally constituted because of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter itself. It is the theory of the defendants
that Section I(DX2X C ) of that Charter requires the
President "to go first to the SCLC to get his proposals
through". Section 1(D)(2)(c) provides as follows:
Interim regulations promulgated under Section
1(2) shall expire 90 days after publication
unless within that period the SCLC has taken
steps to promulgate a regulation in the same
area under the procedure specified in Section
D(l), in which case the interim regulation may
remain in effect until the conclusion of the
Section D(l) procedure.
It seems to us the subsection simply does not say what
the defendants contend. Moreover, even if it did, we
would still have the flat statement in Article IV that
"nothing in these articles shall be deemed to contravene
or limit the authority or power of the President.. .." in
extraordinary circumstances. The reading desired by the
defendants is certainly a limitation on the Presidential
authority sought to be imposed by another Article in the
same Charter. Nothing could more clearly contravene
the words of Article IV.
Furthermore, defendants misconstrue the purpose of
Section 1(D)(2)(c) and the SCLC. Article IV draws a
distinction between the promulgation and the
enforcement of regulations concerning student conduct.
Promulgation of regulations is obviously the province of
the SCLC. Since enforcement was the province of the
old SJC the President, in replacing the SJC, has used his
enforcement power, not his legislative power. The job of
the SCLC is to draft regulations such as the disruption
policy or the policy on possession of dangerous
weapons. It is the Committee of Fifteen that has
jurisdiction over setting up new institutions on the
campus, and the Committee of Fifteen has been working
for some while to draft a judicial system that can have
the approval of all Stanford constituencies. Hopefully
they will succeed, but if they do not, the President's
power under Article IV remains and is certainly in no
way limited by Section l(D)2(c).
The Founding Grant
The next argument of defendants is based on a 1902
amendment to the University trusts made by Mrs. Jane
Stanford. The amendment relied on by the defendants
states
"It shall be the duty of the Board of Trustees
to make general laws providing for the
government of the University and to provide
for just and equitable rules of discipline."
It is the argument of the defendants that the Campus

Spacc paid for by University Relations

Judicial Panel does not provide a "just and equitable"
system of discipline. This argument is not founded on
the procedures of the CJP, or upon the denial of any
particular right to defendants before the CJP. This
argument reasons that because the Legislative and
Judicial Charter was "created by the joint approval of
the student referendum, the Academic Council and the
President . . . , it was then seen as necessary to have such
a tripartite agreement to assure just and equitable rules
of discipline." In other words defendants argue that, the
rules of the CJP itself must not only be just and
equitable but the method of arriving at them must be
just and equitable as well. Defendants argue further that
the only just and equitable method of arriving at rules is
by having the rules approved by the University's three
main constituencies.
There are many problems, however, with this
reasoning. First, the trust amendment refers to the rules
themselves, not the method of arriving at them, and
there is no argument that the rules of the CJP do not fall
within the general terms of "just and equitable."
Second, even if we were to interpret the trust
amendment as providing that the rules must be arrived at
is a just and equitable manner, there was certainly no
hint in 1902 when the amendment was made that this
meant participation by students. Admittedly there are
many good reasons for why students should have
decision-making authority in many areas of University
life. The concept, however, that student power be
exercised in a particular manner, a tripartite agreement,
rather than through the appearance of randomly selected
students on the Campus Judicial Panel — does not
follow.
Next, we must remember that the students did
approve the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968
including Article IV which recognized the power of the
President to do just what he has done here.
Finally, if further student power must be found in
the establishment of the CJP, there was inherent in the
SJC a student power to destroy that institution. The use
of that power is why we are where we are today.
The Effect of Extraordinary Circumstances
The final argument that defendants make is the one
that has given us the most difficulty. Essentially, it
asserts that the President's residual authority in
extraordinary circumstances can only be used to meet
those circumstances. The defendants argue that the
President's residual authority could only be used to set
up an institution as much like the defunct SJC as
possible. In other words, if the refusal of the Student
Senate had caused the lack of student members, the
President could only appoint student members to the
selection committee; perhaps, alternatively, to appoint
the students directly to the SJC itself; or, conceivably,
to have randomly selected students chosen for one or
the other position. This argument has a considerable
appeal since it is much easier to modify existing
institutions than to set up wholly new ones. This
argument, however, involves serious problems. First,
nowhere in the Legislative and Judicial Charter, or any
other document which binds the President, is such a
restriction placed on his Article IV power.
Moreover, the number and possible means by which
the President could create systems arguably "as much as
possible like the SJC" is so large that it is difficult to lay
down standards by which his choice might be judged
especially inasmuch as this decision could be made only
after the fact by the judicial pody - presumably after
considerable effort, energy and time had gone into
litigation before it.
Nevertheless, we hold that the Presidents' Article IV
power could only have been used in a reasonable
response to the extraordinary circumstances which faced
him. This, however, does not help the defendants
because the crisis which the President faced when he set
up the CJP, though triggered by the failure of the
Student Senate to make its appointments, was
considerable broader than the mere lack of student
members on the SJC selection committee.
The Situation in Mid-November
In mid-November of this academic year, when the
Student Senate for the first time announced that it
would refuse to appoint its members to the slection
committee for the SJC, the President was clearly
confronted by an "extraordinary circumstance" within
the meaning of Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter. The SJC then was dead, and the President quite
rightly regarded it as a matter of some importance to set
up a substitute body. Unfortunately, the Student Senate
had not only refused to appoint its members to the
selection committee, it and its predecessor had
previously failed to appoint them for approximately
eight months from the time the appointment would have
been made in the normal course of Business. During this
eight month period, the President had personally and
through intermediaries urged again and again that the
student members of the SJC selection committee be
appointed. By the time he was finally refused, (and the
situation was in doubt until the very last evening) a
substantial backlog of cases had built up for the new
SJC. The argument can be made that what the President
should have done was to appoint the student members in
April so that the new SJC could have been formed on
time. We arc convinced, however, that had he dones so,
he would have incurred every bit as much, if not more
criticism on the campus for being precipious than he
now has for having delayed too long. The President
studiously and carefully maintained the view that he
would do nothing whatever to jeopardize the SJC,
although the backlog continued to build up until the time
of the final Senate refusal, it had reached sixteen cases -
twice as many as the SJC had been able to adjudicate in
the entire previous year. We, nonetheless, cannot say
that the President's attitude and actions were wrong in
any respect.
In any event, when the time came for the President
finally to act. he was confronted with the situation far
worse than the sudden disappearance of the SJC. We
cannot ignore the obvious fact that the SJC, even under
the best conditions, could not keep up with its calendar
of cases, and certainly had the President ignored the
Student Senate action and constituted the SJC himself,
the conditions would not have been at their best, so far
as the cooperation of at least some of the student body
was concerned. Indeed, it is likely that even had the
Student Senate appointed its members, the SJC would
shortly have fallen because of its inability to handle its
caseload. It is far more likely that, with the backlog of
cases that had accumulated and the additional doubts as
to its legitimacy among the student body, the

reconstituted SJC would have failed even more quickly.
The very idea of a nine member body both deciding
questions of fact and their own rules of evidence in open
hearing raises so many problems of time and of
complexity that it is frankly quite surprising that the
SJC lasted as long as it did. We are convinced that the
President could consider this in setting up a new body,
the need for whose existence was very clearly not of his
making and in a situation which certainly constituted
"extraordinary circumstances" within the meaning of
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter.
The Structure of the CJP
This decision has two facets. First we consider the
structure of the CJP and second, the rights it affords to
defendants. So far as the structure of the CJP is
concerned, the major difference from the old SJC is the
CJP's use of hearing examiners to find the facts. First of
all, it should be pointed ut that there is nothing
intrinsically unfair to a student defendant in the use of a
hearing examiner as compared to the SJC's deciding the
facts of the case. It is true that where a hearing examiner
sits, no students help determine the facts. On the other
hand, however, faculty members do not sit to determine
the facts either — as they did on the SJC where they had
a majority.
Not only that, but the CJP defendant has a right to
move to disqualify the hearing examiner, a procedure
that was more than merely impracticable when dealing
with the whole SJC' In fact, in one case under the CJP
the chairman informed the defendant that he was.
Jr
prepared to disqualify the hearing examiner who knew a
prosecution witness — but the defense in that case\
refrained from making a motion to disqualify the£
examiner — as has every other defendant. Finally, as far
as we can tell at present, the percentage of acquittals
before the hearing examiners is at least as great, if not
greater, than before the SJC.
The use of hearing examiners is a standard
administrative practice, often handling issues as
important to the litigants as those adjudicated by the
SJC and now the CJP. It is not in equity that the CJP
hearing examiner system differs from that of the old SJC
structure but rather in the saving of time caused by
having one person rather than nine hear the facts of a
case and the additional fairness in having a dispassionate
attorney unconnected with campus issues decide the
facts. In the recent proceeding against Prof. Franklin
before The Advisory Board, criticism was directed
against the method of fact finding on the ground that
the Board was "to close" to the campus and was
personally knowledgeable about the issues. The hearing
examiner system is an effort to meet this problem. The
hearing examiners, though appointed by the President,
are in fact selected by a committee of law professors
appointed by the Dean of the Law School and having no
other connection with campus discipline.
Aside from the use of hearing officers, the remainder
of the structure of the CJP is strikingly similar to that of
the SJC. Where the SJC consisted of four students, four
faculty and a chairman from the law faculty, the CJP
consists of three students, three faculty and a chairman
also from the law faculty. We cannot see any decrease in
fairness because of this and we have already noticed in
our own operations that the difficulty of scheduling
meetings rises exponentially with increasing numbers on
the judicial body.
It is true also that the CJP results are technically in
the form of a recommendation to the President.
However this was equally true of the SJC. (Indeed this
was one of the major complaints of the Student Senate
in destroying the SJC). Not only is this required clearly
by University (and perhaps the outside civil) law, but
whatever political constraints actually separated during
the existence of the SJC which prevented the President
on any occasion from increasing a penalty which the SJC
had found, presumably act equally in the case of the
CJP.
The final complaint as to the structure of the CJP is
that certain decisions are made by the CJP without
hearing witnesses in person but rather only upon the
report of the hearing officer, the motivational
statements of the defendant, argument of counsel, and
written statements as to the relatively few factual
matters that can be in dispute before the CJP itself (as
distinguished of course, from the hearing officer). In
part this restriction on oral testimony as to facts before
the CJP was intended to prevent the prosecutor from
raising objections to the defense use of affidavits,
character reference letters, and the like. The restriction
also, however, recognizes that any taking of oral
testimony (aside from the motivational statement of the
defendant himself — which is guaranteed both by the
rules of the CJP and SJC) involves fact-finding by a
multiple member body and leads to the enormous
problems of time consumption and confusion of issues
that plagued the SJC. The fact is that if any serious
factual issues are disputed, the CJP has jurisdiction to
remand a case to the hearing officer for further fact
finding. The major issues that the CJP itself hears, such
as justification, severity of sentence and fairness, raise
difficult questions of law but do not raise serious factual
dispute.
The Rights of CJP Defendants
Apart from the reasonable explanations of the
structural differences between the CJP and the old SJC,
it should be noted that the legal rights of the student
defendant are virtually the same before both bodies.
Defendants go i lto considerable effort in their brief in
an attempt to show that, in fact, students have fewer
rights under the CJP than they had under the old SJC.
Most of their complaints, however, center on point s they
consider to be unclear and their main argument is that
the CJP may violate these rights. Our decision today
makes it quite clear that we expect in all matters
involving the civil liberties of students to respect
essentially the same rights as they had undr the SJC as
well as under "the Bill of Rights" of the ASSU
constitution (Article IV, Section 2).
So far as the latter document is concerned there are
only two rights in the ASSU constitution which seem in
any way to be unmet by the CJP procedures. The first is
the right of the student "to be assured that, unless the
defendant asks for an an open hearing, any matters of
facts which would tend to identify the person or persons
involved in the case would be kept confidential". The
CJP gives the Chairman the discretion to open such a
hearing without a student's consent. The present
Chairman lias stated that except in some kind of
extraordinary circumstance, which he cannot
contemplate and which presumably the ASSU
constitution could not contemplate either, he will not
exercise his discretion to open a hearing. We feel that
this resolves that problem and we trust that the
Chairman's successors will feel bound by this pledge.
The only other right guaranteed in the ASSU
constitution with which the CJP might seem to have
power to interfere is the right "to have an open
hearing." "An open hearing" surely means a hearing that
is not "closed," in the sense in which a defendant might
ask for a closed hearing to maintain confidentiality (see
LJC Article II F6, which makes this meaning explicit).
An open hearing, therefore, is a hearing which is not
secret: one whose proceedings can in some reasonable
way be observed or inspected by everyone. A normal,
and sufficient, condition for openness is the admission
of the media KZSU, Daily reporters, etc.
An "open hearing" in the colloquial sense of a
hearing any member of the community may attend is
not a right of the defendant. On the contrary, it is at
most a courtesy the CJP arguably owes the community,
unless extending that courtesy is found to be
incompatible with maintaining the minimum of order
and freedom from intimidation that are requisite for any
fair judicial proceeding. We are confident that this is
what both the SJC rule and the ASSU constitution
meant. The CJP "Procedures" (Section 6) do not speak
of an "open hearing" but of a hearing being, or not

being, "open to the public," and so do not even address
the question of an "open hearing" in the legally
important sense. This sense clearly must be covered. We
pledge that any defendant who desires an "open
hearing." ie.. a non-secret hearing, shall have one.
There are numerous other arguments that the defense
makes as to rights which are denied them under the CJP
proceeding. Defendants attorney, for instance, state:
"The subpoena power of the university
prosecutor is also apparently increased as
evidenced by the conduct in the Rafael Robles
hearing where a student was threatened with
disciplinary action for refusal to testify. . . ."
II indeed this were so, it would be a very serious matter.
In lact, so lar as we can determine, the event simply did
not happen. The student was never threatened with
disciplinary action for failure to testify. Indeed, he was
told that il lie was not willing to testify the case would
be dismissed before he was ever called (apparently he
was an essential witness to the prosecution's case.) In
tact, he did testily though he was obviously ambivalent
about doing so. (In any event, the hearing officer found
for the defense on that issue.)
In short, we find the civil rights of Stanford students
are in practice not abridged under the CJP rules and
procedures as here interpreted. The CJP dispite its
ditterent structure atfords at least equal rights as those
allorded by the SJC and meets all of the rights granted

Space pr id for by University Relations

to students in Article IV Seciton 2 of the ASSU
constitution.
Conclusion
The CJP is of course a body brought into existence
by extraordinary circumstances. We, more than almost
all other members of the community, would like it
replaced by a product of the Committee of Fifteen
which can be approved by all three University
Constituencies. Until this happens and regretably it
may be a long wait until consensus takes hold on the
campus - we unanimously hold that the CJP is a legal
and legitimate institution.

SEPARATE OPINION OF MARK EVANS AND JOHN
KAPLAN
We two formally have no vote in this case. One of us
is an alternate member, appointed to the Panel to sit in
case of unavailability or disqualification of one of the
student members; the other is the chairman, who has no
vote except in case of a lie. Nonetheless, in this separate
opinion, we wish to state our concurrence with the
unanimous opinion of those voting, and to make it clear
that we will act accordingly should our votes be required
on this issue.
This is a somewhat unusual proceeding and regretably
we have relatively little precedent to guide us in our
decision. Nonetheless the issue presented here - the
basic legality of the Campus Judicial Panel - is an
important one which must be decided.
Our Jurisdiction to Decide This Case
The University Administration has argued that we do
not have jurisdiction to decide our own legality since
this question of law can be decided in the first instance
only by the President of the University and, in the
second instance, by the civil courts, should a student
bring suit there alleging that his legal rights were
violated. On the other hand, as members of the CJP, we
are responsible for our own actions, and if we have been
asked by the President to participate in any illegal
enterprise, we have a very simple duty not to do so.
Moreover, if we were to participate in disciplining a
student who claims that we are without authority to
discipline him, that student could, under our rule 18,
bring a charge before us that he had been improperly
disciplined. In hearing such a charge we would in effect
be obliged to make a judgment on our own legitimacy,
(i.e., we would have to rule whether we are in fact "the
judicial system in effect," in the language of section IB
of our Procedures.) And if we could under our rules have
an obligation to make such a judgment, clearly we must
have the authority to make this judgment, if we have
any authority at all.
It is true that the problem of the remedy for an
illegally constituted CJP is a subtle one. If we were to
hand down an opinion seeking to bind our successors to
the illegality of the CJP, we would be exercising a
jurisdiction which we have disclaimed. It is possible that
the proper course of action to remedy an illegally
constituted CJP would simply be our resignations. In
any event, we need not decide this difficult question
because we have examined at great length the arguments
of the defendants and conclude that the CJP is legally
constituted under University "law".
The Basis of the CJP
We will begin with the theory under which the CJP is
constituted; then we will move on to discuss our reasons
for rejecting each of the several grounds under which the
defendants would have us hold this body illegal.
The CJP purports to be set up under the President's
"Residual Authority" contained in Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968, a charter which
was approved by the three major constituencies of the
University, the Student Body, the Faculty, and the
Administration. Article IV provides:
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority
and power of the President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing student conduct
at Stanford University, except in extraordinary
circumstances the SCLC and SJC shall have
primary responsibility for promulgating such
regulations and adjudicating violations thereof.
In short, Article IV binds the President to use the SJC
except in "extraordinary circumstances." In
extraordinary circumstances, however, the President
gnay "enforce regulations governing student conduct"
It is the President's theory that extraordinary
circumstances existed when the Student Senate, over a
period of some eight months, at first failed, and then
refused, to appoint the student members to the SJC
selection committee which would select the student
participants to bring the SJC into existence for that
year. We need not go into the rights and wrongs of the
Student Senate action. It has been defended before us as
merely a technique of exerting pressure upon the
President to do things that were morally or legally
correct. Regardless of its justification, it certainly
amounted to "extraordinary circumstances" within the
meaning of Article IV and hence gave the President the
power to set up a different judicial system.
This is not to say that the President was free to set up
a system that was intrinsically irrational or unfair. Aside
from any legal impediments to his power — which we
will discuss later - the fact is that within the University
community there are political checks upon the
President's power. In part, the students and, perhaps to a
greater extent, the faculty do exert influence in this type
of decision. Otherwise, it would be hard to see why any
chief executive officer would, if completely
unconstrained, set up a system as elaborate as the CJP
simply to do what he thought was correct. In any event,
we need not deal with that issue because the defendants
do not claim here that there is anything about the rules
or procedures of the CJP that is inherently irrational or
unfair. Their complaints are somewhat different.
The ASSU Constitution
The first major attack upon the legality of the
Campus Judicial Panel is that Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter, on which the CJP is
based,was limitedby Article IV of the ASSU constitution
passed and approved by the trustees and the president
subsequent to the Charter, in 1969. The ASSU
constitution, Article IV, Section 1, provides that
"The association (i.e. the student body] shall
recognize the authority of university judicial
bodies over members of the association only if
those judicial bodies shall have been approved
by two-thirds of those members of the
association voting in a general election."
It is the contention of the defendants that these words
which were accepted by the Trustees and President,
constitute a limitation on the President's power under
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter. We
disagree.
To be sure the words of the ASSU constitution on
their face support the defendants' position. When one
looks at the question somewhat more closely, however,
one finds insurmountable problems in accepting the
defendants reasoning.
First, it is clear that the President and Trustees did
not think they had given up any of the President's
residual power under Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter. Indeed, the residual authority of the
President has been vigorously defended by the Trustees
and President essentially since the very beginning of the
University and Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter was simply a recognition of this. To argue that
the Trustees and the President of the University had
agreed to place restrictions on this power without any
Qualifications for emereencies. extraordinary

circumstances or the like, qualifications appearing in
every other limitation of the Presidential power, is to ask
us to believe more than we can. This is especially true
since the consequence of accepting this argument is
that no judicial body at all could be established to
replace the defunct SJC unless it could muster a
two-thirds vote of the students. This might well leave the
University permanently without any means of enforcing
discipline on the campus - a result that no constituency
of the University has supported.
Secondly, the ASSU constitution, as a whole, was
obviously not intended to affect student rights with
respect to those of any other constituency of the
University. A constitution is an allocation of power
within a constituency, and here the constituency was the
student body. The provision requiring a two-thirds vote
of the student body simply determines how the student
body can exercise what power it holds under other
university arrangements; it does not increase the power
of the student body by giving it (indeed, one student
more than one third of those voting) any additional
power which, as a constituency, the students did not
have before Article IV of the ASSU constitution. The
ASSU constitution has the effect of making clear what
was not clear earlier — that is if the student constituency
were asked to approve any judicial body, a simple
majority vote would not be sufficient. The CJP is
founded on an entirely different provision of University
law, the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968 and no
allocation of power and competence within any one
constituency can change this.
This is especially clear in this case since one of the
major constituencies of the University, the Faculty, is
completely ignored by the defense's reading of Article
IV of the ASSU constitution. The Faculty was a party to
the Legislative and Judicial Charter, and had a
continuing interest in that Charter. It had voted for the
President's Article IV power and cannot now be told
that, without any notice to it, an agreement between the
students and the President had changed the rules it had
adopted.
The Academic Senate had already adhered to this
view in acknowledging the legitimacy of the Campus
Judicial Panel. In its resolution of February 17, 1972,
(published in Campus Reports February 23, page 2,
Senate Report (No. 9) the Academic Senate requested
"the prompt prosecution [of certain cases] through
appropriate judicial mechanisms including the Campus
Judicial Panel." The legislative history of this resolution
makes its meaning clear. It was pointed out that the
wording prejudged the legitimacy of the CJP, which had
not yet been authoritatively decided. Despite this, the
resolution carried by a vote of 36 to 1, with three
abstentions. Indeed had the President and the student
body purported to limit Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, they might be in breach of
contract with the faculty.
The conclusion that the ASSU constitution was never
intended as a restriction upon the residual authority of
the President is buttressed by the actions of the Student
Senate itself. It is conceded that the Student Senate, in
refusing to make its appointments to the selection
committee for the SJC, had contemplated that the
President would set up another judicial body. Despite
this so far as we can tell, there was no hint of any
argument by anyone at the time that the ASSU
constitution (as distinguished from all sorts of principles
of fairness or political rights) would prevent the
President from doing this. We must note that the ASSU
constitution was adopted in 1969 within the memory of
many of those presently in the Student Senate. Their
silence on this issue, at a time when it would have been
most relevant, speaks volumes on the intent of the ASSU
Framers.
The Legislative and Judicial Charter
The next argument of the defendants is that the CJP
is illegally constituted because of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter itself. It is the theory of the defendants
that Section I(DX2X C ) of that Charter requires the
President "to go first to the SCLC to get his proposals
through". Section 1(D)(2)(c) provides as follows:
Interim regulations promulgated under Section
1(2) shall expire 90 days after publication
unless within that period the SCLC has taken
steps to promulgate a regulation in the same
area under the procedure specified in Section
D(l), in which case the interim regulation may
remain in effect until the conclusion of the
Section D(l) procedure.
It seems to us the subsection simply does not say what
the defendants contend. Moreover, even if it did, we
would still have the flat statement in Article IV that
"nothing in these articles shall be deemed to contravene
or limit the authority or power of the President.. .." in
extraordinary circumstances. The reading desired by the
defendants is certainly a limitation on the Presidential
authority sought to be imposed by another Article in the
same Charter. Nothing could more clearly contravene
the words of Article IV.
Furthermore, defendants misconstrue the purpose of
Section 1(D)(2)(c) and the SCLC. Article IV draws a
distinction between the promulgation and the
enforcement of regulations concerning student conduct.
Promulgation of regulations is obviously the province of
the SCLC. Since enforcement was the province of the
old SJC the President, in replacing the SJC, has used his
enforcement power, not his legislative power. The job of
the SCLC is to draft regulations such as the disruption
policy or the policy on possession of dangerous
weapons. It is the Committee of Fifteen that has
jurisdiction over setting up new institutions on the
campus, and the Committee of Fifteen has been working
for some while to draft a judicial system that can have
the approval of all Stanford constituencies. Hopefully
they will succeed, but if they do not, the President's
power under Article IV remains and is certainly in no
way limited by Section l(D)2(c).
The Founding Grant
The next argument of defendants is based on a 1902
amendment to the University trusts made by Mrs. Jane
Stanford. The amendment relied on by the defendants
states
"It shall be the duty of the Board of Trustees
to make general laws providing for the
government of the University and to provide
for just and equitable rules of discipline."
It is the argument of the defendants that the Campus

Spacc paid for by University Relations

Judicial Panel does not provide a "just and equitable"
system of discipline. This argument is not founded on
the procedures of the CJP, or upon the denial of any
particular right to defendants before the CJP. This
argument reasons that because the Legislative and
Judicial Charter was "created by the joint approval of
the student referendum, the Academic Council and the
President . . . , it was then seen as necessary to have such
a tripartite agreement to assure just and equitable rules
of discipline." In other words defendants argue that, the
rules of the CJP itself must not only be just and
equitable but the method of arriving at them must be
just and equitable as well. Defendants argue further that
the only just and equitable method of arriving at rules is
by having the rules approved by the University's three
main constituencies.
There are many problems, however, with this
reasoning. First, the trust amendment refers to the rules
themselves, not the method of arriving at them, and
there is no argument that the rules of the CJP do not fall
within the general terms of "just and equitable."
Second, even if we were to interpret the trust
amendment as providing that the rules must be arrived at
is a just and equitable manner, there was certainly no
hint in 1902 when the amendment was made that this
meant participation by students. Admittedly there are
many good reasons for why students should have
decision-making authority in many areas of University
life. The concept, however, that student power be
exercised in a particular manner, a tripartite agreement,
rather than through the appearance of randomly selected
students on the Campus Judicial Panel — does not
follow.
Next, we must remember that the students did
approve the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968
including Article IV which recognized the power of the
President to do just what he has done here.
Finally, if further student power must be found in
the establishment of the CJP, there was inherent in the
SJC a student power to destroy that institution. The use
of that power is why we are where we are today.
The Effect of Extraordinary Circumstances
The final argument that defendants make is the one
that has given us the most difficulty. Essentially, it
asserts that the President's residual authority in
extraordinary circumstances can only be used to meet
those circumstances. The defendants argue that the
President's residual authority could only be used to set
up an institution as much like the defunct SJC as
possible. In other words, if the refusal of the Student
Senate had caused the lack of student members, the
President could only appoint student members to the
selection committee; perhaps, alternatively, to appoint
the students directly to the SJC itself; or, conceivably,
to have randomly selected students chosen for one or
the other position. This argument has a considerable
appeal since it is much easier to modify existing
institutions than to set up wholly new ones. This
argument, however, involves serious problems. First,
nowhere in the Legislative and Judicial Charter, or any
other document which binds the President, is such a
restriction placed on his Article IV power.
Moreover, the number and possible means by which
the President could create systems arguably "as much as
possible like the SJC" is so large that it is difficult to lay
down standards by which his choice might be judged
especially inasmuch as this decision could be made only
after the fact by the judicial pody - presumably after
considerable effort, energy and time had gone into
litigation before it.
Nevertheless, we hold that the Presidents' Article IV
power could only have been used in a reasonable
response to the extraordinary circumstances which faced
him. This, however, does not help the defendants
because the crisis which the President faced when he set
up the CJP, though triggered by the failure of the
Student Senate to make its appointments, was
considerable broader than the mere lack of student
members on the SJC selection committee.
The Situation in Mid-November
In mid-November of this academic year, when the
Student Senate for the first time announced that it
would refuse to appoint its members to the slection
committee for the SJC, the President was clearly
confronted by an "extraordinary circumstance" within
the meaning of Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter. The SJC then was dead, and the President quite
rightly regarded it as a matter of some importance to set
up a substitute body. Unfortunately, the Student Senate
had not only refused to appoint its members to the
selection committee, it and its predecessor had
previously failed to appoint them for approximately
eight months from the time the appointment would have
been made in the normal course of Business. During this
eight month period, the President had personally and
through intermediaries urged again and again that the
student members of the SJC selection committee be
appointed. By the time he was finally refused, (and the
situation was in doubt until the very last evening) a
substantial backlog of cases had built up for the new
SJC. The argument can be made that what the President
should have done was to appoint the student members in
April so that the new SJC could have been formed on
time. We arc convinced, however, that had he dones so,
he would have incurred every bit as much, if not more
criticism on the campus for being precipious than he
now has for having delayed too long. The President
studiously and carefully maintained the view that he
would do nothing whatever to jeopardize the SJC,
although the backlog continued to build up until the time
of the final Senate refusal, it had reached sixteen cases -
twice as many as the SJC had been able to adjudicate in
the entire previous year. We, nonetheless, cannot say
that the President's attitude and actions were wrong in
any respect.
In any event, when the time came for the President
finally to act. he was confronted with the situation far
worse than the sudden disappearance of the SJC. We
cannot ignore the obvious fact that the SJC, even under
the best conditions, could not keep up with its calendar
of cases, and certainly had the President ignored the
Student Senate action and constituted the SJC himself,
the conditions would not have been at their best, so far
as the cooperation of at least some of the student body
was concerned. Indeed, it is likely that even had the
Student Senate appointed its members, the SJC would
shortly have fallen because of its inability to handle its
caseload. It is far more likely that, with the backlog of
cases that had accumulated and the additional doubts as
to its legitimacy among the student body, the

reconstituted SJC would have failed even more quickly.
The very idea of a nine member body both deciding
questions of fact and their own rules of evidence in open
hearing raises so many problems of time and of
complexity that it is frankly quite surprising that the
SJC lasted as long as it did. We are convinced that the
President could consider this in setting up a new body,
the need for whose existence was very clearly not of his
making and in a situation which certainly constituted
"extraordinary circumstances" within the meaning of
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter.
The Structure of the CJP
This decision has two facets. First we consider the
structure of the CJP and second, the rights it affords to
defendants. So far as the structure of the CJP is
concerned, the major difference from the old SJC is the
CJP's use of hearing examiners to find the facts. First of
all, it should be pointed ut that there is nothing
intrinsically unfair to a student defendant in the use of a
hearing examiner as compared to the SJC's deciding the
facts of the case. It is true that where a hearing examiner
sits, no students help determine the facts. On the other
hand, however, faculty members do not sit to determine
the facts either — as they did on the SJC where they had
a majority.
Not only that, but the CJP defendant has a right to
move to disqualify the hearing examiner, a procedure
that was more than merely impracticable when dealing
with the whole SJC' In fact, in one case under the CJP
the chairman informed the defendant that he was.
Jr
prepared to disqualify the hearing examiner who knew a
prosecution witness — but the defense in that case\
refrained from making a motion to disqualify the£
examiner — as has every other defendant. Finally, as far
as we can tell at present, the percentage of acquittals
before the hearing examiners is at least as great, if not
greater, than before the SJC.
The use of hearing examiners is a standard
administrative practice, often handling issues as
important to the litigants as those adjudicated by the
SJC and now the CJP. It is not in equity that the CJP
hearing examiner system differs from that of the old SJC
structure but rather in the saving of time caused by
having one person rather than nine hear the facts of a
case and the additional fairness in having a dispassionate
attorney unconnected with campus issues decide the
facts. In the recent proceeding against Prof. Franklin
before The Advisory Board, criticism was directed
against the method of fact finding on the ground that
the Board was "to close" to the campus and was
personally knowledgeable about the issues. The hearing
examiner system is an effort to meet this problem. The
hearing examiners, though appointed by the President,
are in fact selected by a committee of law professors
appointed by the Dean of the Law School and having no
other connection with campus discipline.
Aside from the use of hearing officers, the remainder
of the structure of the CJP is strikingly similar to that of
the SJC. Where the SJC consisted of four students, four
faculty and a chairman from the law faculty, the CJP
consists of three students, three faculty and a chairman
also from the law faculty. We cannot see any decrease in
fairness because of this and we have already noticed in
our own operations that the difficulty of scheduling
meetings rises exponentially with increasing numbers on
the judicial body.
It is true also that the CJP results are technically in
the form of a recommendation to the President.
However this was equally true of the SJC. (Indeed this
was one of the major complaints of the Student Senate
in destroying the SJC). Not only is this required clearly
by University (and perhaps the outside civil) law, but
whatever political constraints actually separated during
the existence of the SJC which prevented the President
on any occasion from increasing a penalty which the SJC
had found, presumably act equally in the case of the
CJP.
The final complaint as to the structure of the CJP is
that certain decisions are made by the CJP without
hearing witnesses in person but rather only upon the
report of the hearing officer, the motivational
statements of the defendant, argument of counsel, and
written statements as to the relatively few factual
matters that can be in dispute before the CJP itself (as
distinguished of course, from the hearing officer). In
part this restriction on oral testimony as to facts before
the CJP was intended to prevent the prosecutor from
raising objections to the defense use of affidavits,
character reference letters, and the like. The restriction
also, however, recognizes that any taking of oral
testimony (aside from the motivational statement of the
defendant himself — which is guaranteed both by the
rules of the CJP and SJC) involves fact-finding by a
multiple member body and leads to the enormous
problems of time consumption and confusion of issues
that plagued the SJC. The fact is that if any serious
factual issues are disputed, the CJP has jurisdiction to
remand a case to the hearing officer for further fact
finding. The major issues that the CJP itself hears, such
as justification, severity of sentence and fairness, raise
difficult questions of law but do not raise serious factual
dispute.
The Rights of CJP Defendants
Apart from the reasonable explanations of the
structural differences between the CJP and the old SJC,
it should be noted that the legal rights of the student
defendant are virtually the same before both bodies.
Defendants go i lto considerable effort in their brief in
an attempt to show that, in fact, students have fewer
rights under the CJP than they had under the old SJC.
Most of their complaints, however, center on point s they
consider to be unclear and their main argument is that
the CJP may violate these rights. Our decision today
makes it quite clear that we expect in all matters
involving the civil liberties of students to respect
essentially the same rights as they had undr the SJC as
well as under "the Bill of Rights" of the ASSU
constitution (Article IV, Section 2).
So far as the latter document is concerned there are
only two rights in the ASSU constitution which seem in
any way to be unmet by the CJP procedures. The first is
the right of the student "to be assured that, unless the
defendant asks for an an open hearing, any matters of
facts which would tend to identify the person or persons
involved in the case would be kept confidential". The
CJP gives the Chairman the discretion to open such a
hearing without a student's consent. The present
Chairman lias stated that except in some kind of
extraordinary circumstance, which he cannot
contemplate and which presumably the ASSU
constitution could not contemplate either, he will not
exercise his discretion to open a hearing. We feel that
this resolves that problem and we trust that the
Chairman's successors will feel bound by this pledge.
The only other right guaranteed in the ASSU
constitution with which the CJP might seem to have
power to interfere is the right "to have an open
hearing." "An open hearing" surely means a hearing that
is not "closed," in the sense in which a defendant might
ask for a closed hearing to maintain confidentiality (see
LJC Article II F6, which makes this meaning explicit).
An open hearing, therefore, is a hearing which is not
secret: one whose proceedings can in some reasonable
way be observed or inspected by everyone. A normal,
and sufficient, condition for openness is the admission
of the media KZSU, Daily reporters, etc.
An "open hearing" in the colloquial sense of a
hearing any member of the community may attend is
not a right of the defendant. On the contrary, it is at
most a courtesy the CJP arguably owes the community,
unless extending that courtesy is found to be
incompatible with maintaining the minimum of order
and freedom from intimidation that are requisite for any
fair judicial proceeding. We are confident that this is
what both the SJC rule and the ASSU constitution
meant. The CJP "Procedures" (Section 6) do not speak
of an "open hearing" but of a hearing being, or not

being, "open to the public," and so do not even address
the question of an "open hearing" in the legally
important sense. This sense clearly must be covered. We
pledge that any defendant who desires an "open
hearing." ie.. a non-secret hearing, shall have one.
There are numerous other arguments that the defense
makes as to rights which are denied them under the CJP
proceeding. Defendants attorney, for instance, state:
"The subpoena power of the university
prosecutor is also apparently increased as
evidenced by the conduct in the Rafael Robles
hearing where a student was threatened with
disciplinary action for refusal to testify. . . ."
II indeed this were so, it would be a very serious matter.
In lact, so lar as we can determine, the event simply did
not happen. The student was never threatened with
disciplinary action for failure to testify. Indeed, he was
told that il lie was not willing to testify the case would
be dismissed before he was ever called (apparently he
was an essential witness to the prosecution's case.) In
tact, he did testily though he was obviously ambivalent
about doing so. (In any event, the hearing officer found
for the defense on that issue.)
In short, we find the civil rights of Stanford students
are in practice not abridged under the CJP rules and
procedures as here interpreted. The CJP dispite its
ditterent structure atfords at least equal rights as those
allorded by the SJC and meets all of the rights granted

Space pr id for by University Relations

to students in Article IV Seciton 2 of the ASSU
constitution.
Conclusion
The CJP is of course a body brought into existence
by extraordinary circumstances. We, more than almost
all other members of the community, would like it
replaced by a product of the Committee of Fifteen
which can be approved by all three University
Constituencies. Until this happens and regretably it
may be a long wait until consensus takes hold on the
campus - we unanimously hold that the CJP is a legal
and legitimate institution.

SEPARATE OPINION OF MARK EVANS AND JOHN
KAPLAN
We two formally have no vote in this case. One of us
is an alternate member, appointed to the Panel to sit in
case of unavailability or disqualification of one of the
student members; the other is the chairman, who has no
vote except in case of a lie. Nonetheless, in this separate
opinion, we wish to state our concurrence with the
unanimous opinion of those voting, and to make it clear
that we will act accordingly should our votes be required
on this issue.
This is a somewhat unusual proceeding and regretably
we have relatively little precedent to guide us in our
decision. Nonetheless the issue presented here - the
basic legality of the Campus Judicial Panel - is an
important one which must be decided.
Our Jurisdiction to Decide This Case
The University Administration has argued that we do
not have jurisdiction to decide our own legality since
this question of law can be decided in the first instance
only by the President of the University and, in the
second instance, by the civil courts, should a student
bring suit there alleging that his legal rights were
violated. On the other hand, as members of the CJP, we
are responsible for our own actions, and if we have been
asked by the President to participate in any illegal
enterprise, we have a very simple duty not to do so.
Moreover, if we were to participate in disciplining a
student who claims that we are without authority to
discipline him, that student could, under our rule 18,
bring a charge before us that he had been improperly
disciplined. In hearing such a charge we would in effect
be obliged to make a judgment on our own legitimacy,
(i.e., we would have to rule whether we are in fact "the
judicial system in effect," in the language of section IB
of our Procedures.) And if we could under our rules have
an obligation to make such a judgment, clearly we must
have the authority to make this judgment, if we have
any authority at all.
It is true that the problem of the remedy for an
illegally constituted CJP is a subtle one. If we were to
hand down an opinion seeking to bind our successors to
the illegality of the CJP, we would be exercising a
jurisdiction which we have disclaimed. It is possible that
the proper course of action to remedy an illegally
constituted CJP would simply be our resignations. In
any event, we need not decide this difficult question
because we have examined at great length the arguments
of the defendants and conclude that the CJP is legally
constituted under University "law".
The Basis of the CJP
We will begin with the theory under which the CJP is
constituted; then we will move on to discuss our reasons
for rejecting each of the several grounds under which the
defendants would have us hold this body illegal.
The CJP purports to be set up under the President's
"Residual Authority" contained in Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968, a charter which
was approved by the three major constituencies of the
University, the Student Body, the Faculty, and the
Administration. Article IV provides:
Although nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the authority
and power of the President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing student conduct
at Stanford University, except in extraordinary
circumstances the SCLC and SJC shall have
primary responsibility for promulgating such
regulations and adjudicating violations thereof.
In short, Article IV binds the President to use the SJC
except in "extraordinary circumstances." In
extraordinary circumstances, however, the President
gnay "enforce regulations governing student conduct"
It is the President's theory that extraordinary
circumstances existed when the Student Senate, over a
period of some eight months, at first failed, and then
refused, to appoint the student members to the SJC
selection committee which would select the student
participants to bring the SJC into existence for that
year. We need not go into the rights and wrongs of the
Student Senate action. It has been defended before us as
merely a technique of exerting pressure upon the
President to do things that were morally or legally
correct. Regardless of its justification, it certainly
amounted to "extraordinary circumstances" within the
meaning of Article IV and hence gave the President the
power to set up a different judicial system.
This is not to say that the President was free to set up
a system that was intrinsically irrational or unfair. Aside
from any legal impediments to his power — which we
will discuss later - the fact is that within the University
community there are political checks upon the
President's power. In part, the students and, perhaps to a
greater extent, the faculty do exert influence in this type
of decision. Otherwise, it would be hard to see why any
chief executive officer would, if completely
unconstrained, set up a system as elaborate as the CJP
simply to do what he thought was correct. In any event,
we need not deal with that issue because the defendants
do not claim here that there is anything about the rules
or procedures of the CJP that is inherently irrational or
unfair. Their complaints are somewhat different.
The ASSU Constitution
The first major attack upon the legality of the
Campus Judicial Panel is that Article IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter, on which the CJP is
based,was limitedby Article IV of the ASSU constitution
passed and approved by the trustees and the president
subsequent to the Charter, in 1969. The ASSU
constitution, Article IV, Section 1, provides that
"The association (i.e. the student body] shall
recognize the authority of university judicial
bodies over members of the association only if
those judicial bodies shall have been approved
by two-thirds of those members of the
association voting in a general election."
It is the contention of the defendants that these words
which were accepted by the Trustees and President,
constitute a limitation on the President's power under
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter. We
disagree.
To be sure the words of the ASSU constitution on
their face support the defendants' position. When one
looks at the question somewhat more closely, however,
one finds insurmountable problems in accepting the
defendants reasoning.
First, it is clear that the President and Trustees did
not think they had given up any of the President's
residual power under Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter. Indeed, the residual authority of the
President has been vigorously defended by the Trustees
and President essentially since the very beginning of the
University and Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter was simply a recognition of this. To argue that
the Trustees and the President of the University had
agreed to place restrictions on this power without any
Qualifications for emereencies. extraordinary

circumstances or the like, qualifications appearing in
every other limitation of the Presidential power, is to ask
us to believe more than we can. This is especially true
since the consequence of accepting this argument is
that no judicial body at all could be established to
replace the defunct SJC unless it could muster a
two-thirds vote of the students. This might well leave the
University permanently without any means of enforcing
discipline on the campus - a result that no constituency
of the University has supported.
Secondly, the ASSU constitution, as a whole, was
obviously not intended to affect student rights with
respect to those of any other constituency of the
University. A constitution is an allocation of power
within a constituency, and here the constituency was the
student body. The provision requiring a two-thirds vote
of the student body simply determines how the student
body can exercise what power it holds under other
university arrangements; it does not increase the power
of the student body by giving it (indeed, one student
more than one third of those voting) any additional
power which, as a constituency, the students did not
have before Article IV of the ASSU constitution. The
ASSU constitution has the effect of making clear what
was not clear earlier — that is if the student constituency
were asked to approve any judicial body, a simple
majority vote would not be sufficient. The CJP is
founded on an entirely different provision of University
law, the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968 and no
allocation of power and competence within any one
constituency can change this.
This is especially clear in this case since one of the
major constituencies of the University, the Faculty, is
completely ignored by the defense's reading of Article
IV of the ASSU constitution. The Faculty was a party to
the Legislative and Judicial Charter, and had a
continuing interest in that Charter. It had voted for the
President's Article IV power and cannot now be told
that, without any notice to it, an agreement between the
students and the President had changed the rules it had
adopted.
The Academic Senate had already adhered to this
view in acknowledging the legitimacy of the Campus
Judicial Panel. In its resolution of February 17, 1972,
(published in Campus Reports February 23, page 2,
Senate Report (No. 9) the Academic Senate requested
"the prompt prosecution [of certain cases] through
appropriate judicial mechanisms including the Campus
Judicial Panel." The legislative history of this resolution
makes its meaning clear. It was pointed out that the
wording prejudged the legitimacy of the CJP, which had
not yet been authoritatively decided. Despite this, the
resolution carried by a vote of 36 to 1, with three
abstentions. Indeed had the President and the student
body purported to limit Article IV of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, they might be in breach of
contract with the faculty.
The conclusion that the ASSU constitution was never
intended as a restriction upon the residual authority of
the President is buttressed by the actions of the Student
Senate itself. It is conceded that the Student Senate, in
refusing to make its appointments to the selection
committee for the SJC, had contemplated that the
President would set up another judicial body. Despite
this so far as we can tell, there was no hint of any
argument by anyone at the time that the ASSU
constitution (as distinguished from all sorts of principles
of fairness or political rights) would prevent the
President from doing this. We must note that the ASSU
constitution was adopted in 1969 within the memory of
many of those presently in the Student Senate. Their
silence on this issue, at a time when it would have been
most relevant, speaks volumes on the intent of the ASSU
Framers.
The Legislative and Judicial Charter
The next argument of the defendants is that the CJP
is illegally constituted because of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter itself. It is the theory of the defendants
that Section I(DX2X C ) of that Charter requires the
President "to go first to the SCLC to get his proposals
through". Section 1(D)(2)(c) provides as follows:
Interim regulations promulgated under Section
1(2) shall expire 90 days after publication
unless within that period the SCLC has taken
steps to promulgate a regulation in the same
area under the procedure specified in Section
D(l), in which case the interim regulation may
remain in effect until the conclusion of the
Section D(l) procedure.
It seems to us the subsection simply does not say what
the defendants contend. Moreover, even if it did, we
would still have the flat statement in Article IV that
"nothing in these articles shall be deemed to contravene
or limit the authority or power of the President.. .." in
extraordinary circumstances. The reading desired by the
defendants is certainly a limitation on the Presidential
authority sought to be imposed by another Article in the
same Charter. Nothing could more clearly contravene
the words of Article IV.
Furthermore, defendants misconstrue the purpose of
Section 1(D)(2)(c) and the SCLC. Article IV draws a
distinction between the promulgation and the
enforcement of regulations concerning student conduct.
Promulgation of regulations is obviously the province of
the SCLC. Since enforcement was the province of the
old SJC the President, in replacing the SJC, has used his
enforcement power, not his legislative power. The job of
the SCLC is to draft regulations such as the disruption
policy or the policy on possession of dangerous
weapons. It is the Committee of Fifteen that has
jurisdiction over setting up new institutions on the
campus, and the Committee of Fifteen has been working
for some while to draft a judicial system that can have
the approval of all Stanford constituencies. Hopefully
they will succeed, but if they do not, the President's
power under Article IV remains and is certainly in no
way limited by Section l(D)2(c).
The Founding Grant
The next argument of defendants is based on a 1902
amendment to the University trusts made by Mrs. Jane
Stanford. The amendment relied on by the defendants
states
"It shall be the duty of the Board of Trustees
to make general laws providing for the
government of the University and to provide
for just and equitable rules of discipline."
It is the argument of the defendants that the Campus

Spacc paid for by University Relations

Judicial Panel does not provide a "just and equitable"
system of discipline. This argument is not founded on
the procedures of the CJP, or upon the denial of any
particular right to defendants before the CJP. This
argument reasons that because the Legislative and
Judicial Charter was "created by the joint approval of
the student referendum, the Academic Council and the
President . . . , it was then seen as necessary to have such
a tripartite agreement to assure just and equitable rules
of discipline." In other words defendants argue that, the
rules of the CJP itself must not only be just and
equitable but the method of arriving at them must be
just and equitable as well. Defendants argue further that
the only just and equitable method of arriving at rules is
by having the rules approved by the University's three
main constituencies.
There are many problems, however, with this
reasoning. First, the trust amendment refers to the rules
themselves, not the method of arriving at them, and
there is no argument that the rules of the CJP do not fall
within the general terms of "just and equitable."
Second, even if we were to interpret the trust
amendment as providing that the rules must be arrived at
is a just and equitable manner, there was certainly no
hint in 1902 when the amendment was made that this
meant participation by students. Admittedly there are
many good reasons for why students should have
decision-making authority in many areas of University
life. The concept, however, that student power be
exercised in a particular manner, a tripartite agreement,
rather than through the appearance of randomly selected
students on the Campus Judicial Panel — does not
follow.
Next, we must remember that the students did
approve the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968
including Article IV which recognized the power of the
President to do just what he has done here.
Finally, if further student power must be found in
the establishment of the CJP, there was inherent in the
SJC a student power to destroy that institution. The use
of that power is why we are where we are today.
The Effect of Extraordinary Circumstances
The final argument that defendants make is the one
that has given us the most difficulty. Essentially, it
asserts that the President's residual authority in
extraordinary circumstances can only be used to meet
those circumstances. The defendants argue that the
President's residual authority could only be used to set
up an institution as much like the defunct SJC as
possible. In other words, if the refusal of the Student
Senate had caused the lack of student members, the
President could only appoint student members to the
selection committee; perhaps, alternatively, to appoint
the students directly to the SJC itself; or, conceivably,
to have randomly selected students chosen for one or
the other position. This argument has a considerable
appeal since it is much easier to modify existing
institutions than to set up wholly new ones. This
argument, however, involves serious problems. First,
nowhere in the Legislative and Judicial Charter, or any
other document which binds the President, is such a
restriction placed on his Article IV power.
Moreover, the number and possible means by which
the President could create systems arguably "as much as
possible like the SJC" is so large that it is difficult to lay
down standards by which his choice might be judged
especially inasmuch as this decision could be made only
after the fact by the judicial pody - presumably after
considerable effort, energy and time had gone into
litigation before it.
Nevertheless, we hold that the Presidents' Article IV
power could only have been used in a reasonable
response to the extraordinary circumstances which faced
him. This, however, does not help the defendants
because the crisis which the President faced when he set
up the CJP, though triggered by the failure of the
Student Senate to make its appointments, was
considerable broader than the mere lack of student
members on the SJC selection committee.
The Situation in Mid-November
In mid-November of this academic year, when the
Student Senate for the first time announced that it
would refuse to appoint its members to the slection
committee for the SJC, the President was clearly
confronted by an "extraordinary circumstance" within
the meaning of Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter. The SJC then was dead, and the President quite
rightly regarded it as a matter of some importance to set
up a substitute body. Unfortunately, the Student Senate
had not only refused to appoint its members to the
selection committee, it and its predecessor had
previously failed to appoint them for approximately
eight months from the time the appointment would have
been made in the normal course of Business. During this
eight month period, the President had personally and
through intermediaries urged again and again that the
student members of the SJC selection committee be
appointed. By the time he was finally refused, (and the
situation was in doubt until the very last evening) a
substantial backlog of cases had built up for the new
SJC. The argument can be made that what the President
should have done was to appoint the student members in
April so that the new SJC could have been formed on
time. We arc convinced, however, that had he dones so,
he would have incurred every bit as much, if not more
criticism on the campus for being precipious than he
now has for having delayed too long. The President
studiously and carefully maintained the view that he
would do nothing whatever to jeopardize the SJC,
although the backlog continued to build up until the time
of the final Senate refusal, it had reached sixteen cases -
twice as many as the SJC had been able to adjudicate in
the entire previous year. We, nonetheless, cannot say
that the President's attitude and actions were wrong in
any respect.
In any event, when the time came for the President
finally to act. he was confronted with the situation far
worse than the sudden disappearance of the SJC. We
cannot ignore the obvious fact that the SJC, even under
the best conditions, could not keep up with its calendar
of cases, and certainly had the President ignored the
Student Senate action and constituted the SJC himself,
the conditions would not have been at their best, so far
as the cooperation of at least some of the student body
was concerned. Indeed, it is likely that even had the
Student Senate appointed its members, the SJC would
shortly have fallen because of its inability to handle its
caseload. It is far more likely that, with the backlog of
cases that had accumulated and the additional doubts as
to its legitimacy among the student body, the

reconstituted SJC would have failed even more quickly.
The very idea of a nine member body both deciding
questions of fact and their own rules of evidence in open
hearing raises so many problems of time and of
complexity that it is frankly quite surprising that the
SJC lasted as long as it did. We are convinced that the
President could consider this in setting up a new body,
the need for whose existence was very clearly not of his
making and in a situation which certainly constituted
"extraordinary circumstances" within the meaning of
Article IV of the Legislative and Judicial Charter.
The Structure of the CJP
This decision has two facets. First we consider the
structure of the CJP and second, the rights it affords to
defendants. So far as the structure of the CJP is
concerned, the major difference from the old SJC is the
CJP's use of hearing examiners to find the facts. First of
all, it should be pointed ut that there is nothing
intrinsically unfair to a student defendant in the use of a
hearing examiner as compared to the SJC's deciding the
facts of the case. It is true that where a hearing examiner
sits, no students help determine the facts. On the other
hand, however, faculty members do not sit to determine
the facts either — as they did on the SJC where they had
a majority.
Not only that, but the CJP defendant has a right to
move to disqualify the hearing examiner, a procedure
that was more than merely impracticable when dealing
with the whole SJC' In fact, in one case under the CJP
the chairman informed the defendant that he was.
Jr
prepared to disqualify the hearing examiner who knew a
prosecution witness — but the defense in that case\
refrained from making a motion to disqualify the£
examiner — as has every other defendant. Finally, as far
as we can tell at present, the percentage of acquittals
before the hearing examiners is at least as great, if not
greater, than before the SJC.
The use of hearing examiners is a standard
administrative practice, often handling issues as
important to the litigants as those adjudicated by the
SJC and now the CJP. It is not in equity that the CJP
hearing examiner system differs from that of the old SJC
structure but rather in the saving of time caused by
having one person rather than nine hear the facts of a
case and the additional fairness in having a dispassionate
attorney unconnected with campus issues decide the
facts. In the recent proceeding against Prof. Franklin
before The Advisory Board, criticism was directed
against the method of fact finding on the ground that
the Board was "to close" to the campus and was
personally knowledgeable about the issues. The hearing
examiner system is an effort to meet this problem. The
hearing examiners, though appointed by the President,
are in fact selected by a committee of law professors
appointed by the Dean of the Law School and having no
other connection with campus discipline.
Aside from the use of hearing officers, the remainder
of the structure of the CJP is strikingly similar to that of
the SJC. Where the SJC consisted of four students, four
faculty and a chairman from the law faculty, the CJP
consists of three students, three faculty and a chairman
also from the law faculty. We cannot see any decrease in
fairness because of this and we have already noticed in
our own operations that the difficulty of scheduling
meetings rises exponentially with increasing numbers on
the judicial body.
It is true also that the CJP results are technically in
the form of a recommendation to the President.
However this was equally true of the SJC. (Indeed this
was one of the major complaints of the Student Senate
in destroying the SJC). Not only is this required clearly
by University (and perhaps the outside civil) law, but
whatever political constraints actually separated during
the existence of the SJC which prevented the President
on any occasion from increasing a penalty which the SJC
had found, presumably act equally in the case of the
CJP.
The final complaint as to the structure of the CJP is
that certain decisions are made by the CJP without
hearing witnesses in person but rather only upon the
report of the hearing officer, the motivational
statements of the defendant, argument of counsel, and
written statements as to the relatively few factual
matters that can be in dispute before the CJP itself (as
distinguished of course, from the hearing officer). In
part this restriction on oral testimony as to facts before
the CJP was intended to prevent the prosecutor from
raising objections to the defense use of affidavits,
character reference letters, and the like. The restriction
also, however, recognizes that any taking of oral
testimony (aside from the motivational statement of the
defendant himself — which is guaranteed both by the
rules of the CJP and SJC) involves fact-finding by a
multiple member body and leads to the enormous
problems of time consumption and confusion of issues
that plagued the SJC. The fact is that if any serious
factual issues are disputed, the CJP has jurisdiction to
remand a case to the hearing officer for further fact
finding. The major issues that the CJP itself hears, such
as justification, severity of sentence and fairness, raise
difficult questions of law but do not raise serious factual
dispute.
The Rights of CJP Defendants
Apart from the reasonable explanations of the
structural differences between the CJP and the old SJC,
it should be noted that the legal rights of the student
defendant are virtually the same before both bodies.
Defendants go i lto considerable effort in their brief in
an attempt to show that, in fact, students have fewer
rights under the CJP than they had under the old SJC.
Most of their complaints, however, center on point s they
consider to be unclear and their main argument is that
the CJP may violate these rights. Our decision today
makes it quite clear that we expect in all matters
involving the civil liberties of students to respect
essentially the same rights as they had undr the SJC as
well as under "the Bill of Rights" of the ASSU
constitution (Article IV, Section 2).
So far as the latter document is concerned there are
only two rights in the ASSU constitution which seem in
any way to be unmet by the CJP procedures. The first is
the right of the student "to be assured that, unless the
defendant asks for an an open hearing, any matters of
facts which would tend to identify the person or persons
involved in the case would be kept confidential". The
CJP gives the Chairman the discretion to open such a
hearing without a student's consent. The present
Chairman lias stated that except in some kind of
extraordinary circumstance, which he cannot
contemplate and which presumably the ASSU
constitution could not contemplate either, he will not
exercise his discretion to open a hearing. We feel that
this resolves that problem and we trust that the
Chairman's successors will feel bound by this pledge.
The only other right guaranteed in the ASSU
constitution with which the CJP might seem to have
power to interfere is the right "to have an open
hearing." "An open hearing" surely means a hearing that
is not "closed," in the sense in which a defendant might
ask for a closed hearing to maintain confidentiality (see
LJC Article II F6, which makes this meaning explicit).
An open hearing, therefore, is a hearing which is not
secret: one whose proceedings can in some reasonable
way be observed or inspected by everyone. A normal,
and sufficient, condition for openness is the admission
of the media KZSU, Daily reporters, etc.
An "open hearing" in the colloquial sense of a
hearing any member of the community may attend is
not a right of the defendant. On the contrary, it is at
most a courtesy the CJP arguably owes the community,
unless extending that courtesy is found to be
incompatible with maintaining the minimum of order
and freedom from intimidation that are requisite for any
fair judicial proceeding. We are confident that this is
what both the SJC rule and the ASSU constitution
meant. The CJP "Procedures" (Section 6) do not speak
of an "open hearing" but of a hearing being, or not

being, "open to the public," and so do not even address
the question of an "open hearing" in the legally
important sense. This sense clearly must be covered. We
pledge that any defendant who desires an "open
hearing." ie.. a non-secret hearing, shall have one.
There are numerous other arguments that the defense
makes as to rights which are denied them under the CJP
proceeding. Defendants attorney, for instance, state:
"The subpoena power of the university
prosecutor is also apparently increased as
evidenced by the conduct in the Rafael Robles
hearing where a student was threatened with
disciplinary action for refusal to testify. . . ."
II indeed this were so, it would be a very serious matter.
In lact, so lar as we can determine, the event simply did
not happen. The student was never threatened with
disciplinary action for failure to testify. Indeed, he was
told that il lie was not willing to testify the case would
be dismissed before he was ever called (apparently he
was an essential witness to the prosecution's case.) In
tact, he did testily though he was obviously ambivalent
about doing so. (In any event, the hearing officer found
for the defense on that issue.)
In short, we find the civil rights of Stanford students
are in practice not abridged under the CJP rules and
procedures as here interpreted. The CJP dispite its
ditterent structure atfords at least equal rights as those
allorded by the SJC and meets all of the rights granted

to students in Article IV Seciton 2 of the ASSU
constitution.
Conclusion
The CJP is of course a body brought into existence
by extraordinary circumstances. We, more than almost
all other members of the community, would like it
replaced by a product of the Committee of Fifteen
which can be approved by all three University
Constituencies. Until this happens and regretably it
may be a long wait until consensus takes hold on the
campus - we unanimously hold that the CJP is a legal
and legitimate institution.

SEPARATE OPINION OF MARK EVANS AND JOHN
KAPLAN
We two formally have no vote in this case. One of us
is an alternate member, appointed to the Panel to sit in
case of unavailability or disqualification of one of the
student members; the other is the chairman, who has no
vote except in case of a lie. Nonetheless, in this separate
opinion, we wish to state our concurrence with the
unanimous opinion of those voting, and to make it clear
that we will act accordingly should our votes be required
on this issue.
