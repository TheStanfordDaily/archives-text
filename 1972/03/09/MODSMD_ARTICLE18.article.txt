# Course Review Published
## 
### 
Stanford undergraduates will
have a chance to read student
opinions of the most popular
spring quarter courses next week,
in "The Guerilla," a publication
of the ASSU.
For example, comments on
Social Psychology taught by
Philip Zimbardo, rate the class as
good, but were somewhat
ambivalent about his
showmanship.
The publication reports
comments elicited in a telephone
poll of a sample of students who
took 14 of the most
heavily-attended courses in spring
quarter of last year.
According to ASSU Council of
Presidents member Ann Kimball,
one of the booklet's five editors,
plans are to publish "The
Guerrilla" quarterly and to
increase the number of courses
covered.
Kimball pointed out that
"We're filling a gap. The official
Student Evaluation of Teachers
program is just for the faculty.
The results are confidential and

participation by professors is
voluntary.
"We hope that at some future
time the faculty will decide to
publish the results of the Student
of Evaluation of Teachers. In the
meantime, our review is necessary
for the students," she added.
Courses included are Biology 1,
23, and 24; Economics 1; English
143B; Political Science 10;
Chemistry 3; History 176; Human
Biology 1; Physics 29, 53;
Psychology 60, 121; and
Anthropology 1. The professors
who taught the courses last year
are not always the same this year,
however.
Editors of the booklet in
addition to Kimball are Bill Ridge,
Kerry Stoebner, Seth Katz, and
Gary Rector.
