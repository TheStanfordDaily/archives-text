# New Dean's Duties Unclear

### RALPH KOSTANT 
James Lyons will become the new
Dean of Student Affairs, but his duties
have not yet been clearly defined,
according to President Richard
Lyman.
"We have not succeeded in
redefining the office of Dean of
Student Affairs," Lyman said during a
KZSU Campus Conference broadcast
Tuesday evening.
"It was probably a mistake to
attempt to redefine the role of the
Dean of Students before searching for
a candidate. We should have began an
immediate search for a candidate, and
defined the job when we found him,"
Lyman said.
Lyons will fill a vacancy that has
existed since August, 1970, when
Peter Bulkeley resigned as Dean of
Students to return to academic duties
in the Department of Mechanical
Engineering.
Robert Freelen was appointed
Acting Dean of Students at that time,
but no effort was initiated to select a
permanent Dean. Lyman, who had
only recently assumed the duties of
acting president, wrote in a
memorandum of August 28, 1970,
"Rather than setting about
immediately to create a search
committee to recommend candidates

for this vacancy, I have decided to
undertake a study of the role of the
Deanship in light of the changes within
the University in recent years."
Little Consensus
"There appears to be little
consensus as to what the Dean's
responsibilities should be," the
memorandum continued, "except that
nearly everyone recognizes the
inappropriateness of models that were
unquestioned not so many years ago,
before the erosion of the doctrine in
loco parentis had begun. Obviously we
need to know what sort of job we're
asking a man or woman to do before
any invitations go out.. ."
Now, more than a year later, the
obvious course of action has
apparently also proven to be an
unworkable one. There still appears to
be little consensus as to what the
Dean's responsibilities - or even his
title - should be.
The names "director of student
services" and "dean of students" were
both rejected before the search
committee settled on dean of student
affairs as the title of the post, and on
James W. Lyons as the man to hold it.
When asked at Tuesday's
conference if the appointment of the
new dean meant the office had been
defined, Lyman commented "I think
you're mixing up what a man says he
is going to do with what he succeeds in
doing."
"We will have to define the job
according to the nature, temperament,
experience and abilities of the man
who is going to hold it," Lyman
concluded.
Lyons was Dean of Students at
Haverford (Pa.) College, a small liberal
arts men's college, before accepting his
new appointment.
Judicial Role
Under Freelen, the Dean's Office
continued to manage the student
residence system. Resident Advisors in
the dorms are officially employees of
the Dean of Students Office.

The Dean of Students has also
played a role of late in student judicial
processes. Cases in which issues of fact
are not contested may be arbitrated by
the Dean of Students instead of being
heard by the Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP).
Students have selected this option
in increasing numbers. In 'fact, the
backlog of cases cited by Lyman as a
reason for using his emergency powers
to create the CJP has all but
disappeared.
"This development was
unpredictable, unpredicted and
unforeseen," Lyman remarked
Tuesday.
