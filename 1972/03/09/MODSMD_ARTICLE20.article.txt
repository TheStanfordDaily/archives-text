# Muskie Win Unimpressive

News Analysis
Edmund Muskie's victory in
New Hampshire Tuesday was
more pyrrhic than real.
Considering that Muskie has been
the front-runner in the
Democratic Presidential race for a
year and a half and that he hails
from neighboring Maine, a 48
percent showing in New
Hampshire was far from
impressive.
On the other hand, George
McGovem's 37 percent far
exceeded the expectations of
pollsters, political analysts,
Muskie, and even McGovern
himself.
But Muskie need not despair
since as almost every political
analyst in the country has
probably said by now, it's a long
way to Miami Beach. Before the
Democratic National Convention
meets in July, there are going to
be 23 more primaries.
Meanwhile, Peninsula
Congressman Paul McCloskey was
left in political limbo after
receiving 20 percent of the
Republican vote. He expressed an
interest in continuing his
challenge to President Nixon, but
also stated his intention to seek

re-election to Congress from the
17th District, which includes
Stanford and Palo Alto.
McCloskey has stated
previously that if he received less
than 20 percent, he would drop
out of the Presidential race and
run for re-election to Congress
instead. Yesterday morning he
cited lack of funds as a barrier to
continuing his liberal challenge of
Nixon.
He said he was definitely out
of the California Presidential
primary.
Following are unofficial
returns from the New Hampshire
primary. Ninety-seven percent of
the precincts have reported.
For the Democrats: Edmund
Muskie, 40,425 (48%); George
McGovern, 31,812 (37%); Samuel
Yorty, 5,244 (6%); Wilbur Mills
(w-i), 3,508 (4%); Vance Hartke,
2,326 (3%); Edward Kennedy
(w-i), 794 (1%); Hubert
Humphrey (w-i), 292; Edward
Coll, 256; Henry Jackson (w-i),
87; Eugene McCarthy (w-i), 39
(w-i denotes write-in votes).
For the Republicans: Richard
Nixon, 77,398 (69%); Paul
McCloskey, 22,675 (20%); John
Ashbrook, 10,740 (10%); Pat
Paulsen, 1,146 (1%).
