# Overseas Plans Explained
## 
### DAN BRENNER 
Last month's elimination of
program requirements at overseas
campuses may effect academic
plans for those who are interested
in going overseas.
While the change eliminated
the required class load formula of
one language course, one culture
course, and one course led by a
Stanford professor, the
pre-departure requirement of two
quarters of foreign language or its
equivilent proficiency remains.
But at the Vienna campus, the
pre-departure requirement has
been relaxed for those students
who have a special interest in
subjects which make study in
Austria especially attractive or
whose program would make it
difficult to finish two quarters
before departure.
The program's general
tendency not to drop
pre-requisites is based on remarks
made by returning students. Corb
Smith, assistant director of the
Overseas Office, reports that he
hasn't spoken with a single
student who suggests lowering the
number of courses needed; in fact,
they have suggested more
language training to make the
months abroad more worthwhile.
Yet, as Professor Ralph Hester,
chairman of the Committee on
Foregin Study, recognizes, there is
a dilemma for many students.

While they believe foreign study is
beneficial, they object to having
to take many courses outside their
major when the courses abroad
already will take up many elective
possibilities.
Previously overseas study
meant at least six units of
langujige training, three units of
indigenous culture, and four units
of a course led by a Stanford
professor.
Now undergraduate or
graduate students can use an
overseas center in order to
coordinate the facilities of the
foreign country with their
scholastic interests through
"Advanced Independent & Study
Projects," sponsored by a faculty
member at the home campus or in
residence overseas projects might
comprise as many as nine units
per quarter.
