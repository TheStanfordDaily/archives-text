# Defense Motion Denied
## 
### KEVIN SMITH JAMES LOBSENZ 
Hearing Officer Henry Ramsey
denied a defense motion
yesterday to dismiss all charges
against four students accused of
disrupting Professor William
Shockley's quantum mechanics
class on Jan. 18 as Campus
Judicial Panel hearings on the
charges continued yesterday.
Ramsey did rule, however, the
defense could separate the case of
any defendant from the other
defendants, and submit the case at
any time. The defendants are Don
Lee, Alice Furumoto, Kwonping
Ho, and Gerry Foote.
In seeking dismissal of the
charges, the defense claimed the
prosecution had failed to prove
beyonu "reasonable doubt" that
the defendants were in Shockley's

classroom or that if they were,
their activity was more than
minimal. They added the
prosecution had not show that the
disruption, if there was one, was
unjustified.
The prosecution said dismissal
was wrong because of a CJP rule
which gives the hearing officer
authority to request any
additional information that might
aid him.
In addition, the prosecution
said it would only be appropriate
for a Hearing Officer to make
interim findings in a case when
the "evidence against a defendant
is . . . miniscule."
In refusing to dismiss the case,
Ramsey said that a "Hearing
Officer's job is to find out what
happened" from whatever
evidence and sources available. He

refused to make a "binding
finding of fact" because evidence
presented in defense testimony
might contradict his interim
finding.
In hearings last Friday, Ramsey
stated that there was "no problem
on his mind" that the defendants,
with the possible exception of
Foote, were present in Shockley's
classroom, and that their objective
had been to demand that
Shockley debate his theory of
racial genetic inferiority with
another faculty member.
He also stated he believed that
the demonstrators remained in the
room "largely due to Shockley's
desire to defend his views."
The defense will begin its case
when the hearings reconvene at
9:00 a.m. on Monday, March 27
in Room 83 of the Graduate
School of Business.
