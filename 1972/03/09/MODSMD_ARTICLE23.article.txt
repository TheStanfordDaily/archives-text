Shockley's Car Sprayed
Vandals spray painted "racist
pig" on Prof. William Shockley's
car while he was having dinner
and speaking by invitation at
Grove House on the Stanford
campus last Monday.
About an hour after the talk
started, Shockley said he was
"thinking pretty seriously about
walking out," because questioning
had gone beyond the area he had
agreed to discuss â€” published
studies of white identical twins,
reared separately.
He engaged in a brief exchange
with Prof. Leonard Herzenberg, of
the Genetics Department, who
said Shockley regarded his
colleagues in genetics as
"incompetent". Herzenberg added
that Shockley had withdrawn an
offer to debate with him.
The initial audience numbered
about 70, including several
supporters of Venceremos.
At one point, Shockley
suggested the audience felt "It
would be entertaining to get
Shockley here and throw darts at
him." One listener replied,
"You've thrown quite a few darts
at us."
Half an hour later, Shockley
was smiling as several students

used playing cards to demonstrate
the statistical basis of the identical
twins study. "You're creeping up
on it,"he commented, where
"you'd only strike at a straight
lecture presentation.
Woman Assaulted
Karen Schellenberg, 22, the
wife of a Stanford student, was
knocked unconscious by an
unknown assailant Tuesday
afternoon as she was entering her
residence at 53-A Escondido on
the Stanford campus.
Shellenberg was bringing a
lawn chair back from a neighbor's
home when she apprached her
back door and saw a "stocky"
man who had a baseball bat raised
above his head, according to

reports of the Santa Clara County
Sheriff.
She recalled being awakened
later by her husband, Donald
Schellenberg, who found her
unconscious on the floor. The bat
was found in the residence.
Manager Succumbs
Geneva Connor, 59, manager
of food service at Florence Moore
Hall, Stanford, died Sunday,
March 5, at Stanford Medical
Center after five weeks' illness.
Connor had been associated
with Stanford food service
operations for 24 years, after
coming here in 1948 from the
University of Chicago.
She had managed virtually
every dining hall on the campus
