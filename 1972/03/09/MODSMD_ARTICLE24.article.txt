# Bazile Ruling Due
## 
### 
Three Stanford administrators
testified Tuesday in defense of
Leo Bazile, a former chairman of
the Black Students Union here,
saying they saw him do nothing
illegal at the MedicaJ Center sit-in
of April 9, last year.
Municipal Court Judge Sidney
Feinberg has the case under
submission; he is expected to rule
on it later this week.
Bazile has pleaded not guilty to
charges of unlawful assembly,
failing to disperse, disturbing the
peace, and resisting an officer.
The officials, Lyle Nelson,
Harry Press of the
Communication Dept. and Hobert
Rosenweig, vice provost of the
University, joined two Stanford
students who said last week that

Bazile was doing nothing more
than many other spectators at the
sit-in.
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Sgt. James Hart has claimed that
Bazile tried to walk through a
police line, harassed officers and
refused to back off when ordered
to do so. Bazile contends he was
trying to pass the police line as a
reporter for The Real News and as
a producer of a talk show on
KZSU.
Bazile's attorney, Assistant
Law School dean Thelton
Henderson, said in his final
remarks that his client's arrest was
an overreaction by police in a
tense situation because of "what
Officer Hart saw him to
represent."
