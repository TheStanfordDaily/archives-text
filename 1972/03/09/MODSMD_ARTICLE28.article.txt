# SF Golf Championship
## Robertson Second 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Bruce Robertson only trailed
once in his match with John
Cranston for the San Francisco
City golf championship last
Sunday at Harding Park. But it
was on the second sudden death
hole that Robertson fell behind
Cranston, spoiling the chance for
a Stanford golfer to win the City
title for the second straight year.
Robertson, who reached the
finals with a 2 and 1 victory over
veteran Mat Palacio on Saturday,
held a 3 up lead over Cranston
with just eight holes to play in the
scheduled 36 hole final.
But an erratic driver hurt the
Stanford freshman on three of the
remaining holes and the match
was forced into sudden death. "1
lost 13 and 14 in both the
morning and afternoon rounds,"
explained Robertson. "Those
holes turned the match around."
Missed Opportunity
Still, Robertson had a chance
to win the match with a five foot
birdie putt on the first extra hole.
But the ball sweved to the right at
the last instant and Robertson had
to settle for a par. Stanford golf
coach Bud Finger thought the ball
hit a spike mark just before it
reached the hole.
"I thought I hit a good putt,"
said Robertson. "I was ready to
pick the ball out of the hole when
it suddenly slid to the right."
On the second extra hole
Cranston made a seven foot birdie
putt to win the match. He was
four over par for the 38 holes and

Robertson was six over regulation
figures. The 35 year old Cranston
became the oldest City champion
in the last seven years.
Robertson's runnerup trophy
marked his second straight
standout performance in the City
tournament. Last year he reached
the semifinals before losing to
Stanford's Gary Vanier, the
tournament's eventual winner and
Robertson's future teammate.
Medalist Jinx
Since Robertson tied for
medalist honors in the qualifying
rounds four weeks ago, he had the
chance to become one of the few
golfers to win both the qualifying
medal and the tournament itself.
The feat was last accomplished in
1963 by George Archer, now one
of the leading money winners on
the PGA tour. Since then the
"medalist jinx" has plagued eight
consecutive City medalists.
During spring break Robertson
will continue his heavy golfing
schedule with his first major
intercollegiate events. Stanford
will play in the Fresno State
Classic on March 24 and 25 and in
the Western Intercollegiates
Pasatiempo from March 27-29.
Both tournaments are 54 holes
and will test Stanford's strength
against several national powers.
Robertson, of course, will be
counted on heavily in both
tournaments. As a freshman, he
has already shown the potential to
be one of the finest golfers in
Stanford history.

specialities. Last year Pedley
placed third in the 100 free and
sixth in the 50 free at the NCAA
Championships. Last weekend at
the Pacific-8 Championships he
anchored Stanford's 400 free
relay in 46.2.
