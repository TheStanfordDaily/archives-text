# Cards Place Third
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
The Stanford swimming team in its finest
performance of theseason placed third behind USC
and UCLA in the Pacific-Eight swimming
championships at Lake Oswego, Oregon last
weekeend.
Almost every Stanford swimmer achieved a
season or lifetime best in at least one of the events
he swam. This was marked contrast to the
performances recorded last month in Los Angeles
against the Trojans and Bruins. Stanford was almost
able to redeem its dual meet loss to UCLA by
finishing only nine points behind the Bruins, 295 to
286. USC was an easy winner as they scored 549
points.
The story of the Indians' success was due largely
to the sprinters, who until this meet had been
somewhat of a disappointment as they had been
unable to score much needed dual meet points. In
spite of the pool, that was labled by numerous
swimmers as the slowest in the country, the
swimmers turned in some excellent performances.
Ken Hammer showed he had regained his 1968
form by placing fourth in the 50 free and third in
the 100 free, recording 21.92 and 47.86
respectively. Freshman Dean Anderson did an
outstanding job in placing third in the 50 in 21.86
and sixth in the 100 in 48.42. Junior Steve Carey
rebounded from a poor sophomore season by
placing sixth in the 50 and 11th in the 100 going
22.31 and 48.28.
Relay Team Second
The 400 free relay of Hammer, Anderson, Carey,
and Martin Pedley placed second behind USC.
Pedley who had not performed well in the 50 and
100 events earlier in the meet finally came around
as he anchored the relay in 46.2. Overall the
sprinters accounted for a big chunk of Stanford's
286 points.
Brian Job successfully defended his 100 and 200
breast titles. He set a new Pac-8 record in the 100 of
57.94 and won the 200 in a season best 2.05.78.
Stanford's other winner was freshman Randy
Whitchurch who won the 200 back in a lifetime best
1.55.98, while narrowly missing winning the 100
back in a season best 54.2.
Other Stanford swimmers who did well included:
Captain Dave Shilling who placed sth in the 100
and 200 breast; Terry Sutton placing fifth in the
500 free in a lifetime best of 4.44.74 and sixth in

the 1650 in a lifetime best of 16.33.3; Jack Deppe
who palced third in the 200 back in a season best of
1.59.0, and Rick Longinotti who placed fourth in
the 100 tly and eighth in the 200 fly, with his 200
time of 1.57.23 being a lifetime best.
Coach Jim Gaughran, not suprisingly, was quite
pleased with the results. In summing up the meet he
states, "Everyone is rounding into good shape now,
everybody is really starting to put it together. The
sprinters wen 1 particularly fast as they did some
amazing things." For Gaughran the drop in times at
the meet indicated that all the hard work that had
been done was paying off. He indicated that the big
improvements had generated a new excitement on
the team that he believes will carry over into the
NCAA Championships at West Point, March 23-25.
Extra Time Trial
To cap off the excellent results of the Pac-8 meet
Gaughran ran a time trial on Monday for those
swimmers who still hadn't made NCAA cut-off
times. The results were quite good and served as
further proof that the pool last weekend was indeed
slow. In the 50 free Dean Anderson did 21.3 and
Ken Hammer and Martin Pedley did 21.7. Either of
these times would have won the Pac-8 50 free. In
the 100 fly Rick Longinotti and Jock Stalker both
did 51.7, lifetime bests for both swimmers. In the
200 fly Longinotti did a lifetime best of 1.56.5. All
these times equaled or bettered NCAA cut-off
times.
Gaughran is now looking forward to the NCAA's
with great expectations. He figures Stanford will
battle for the third place spot with UCLA and
Tennessee, as Indiana and USC have been conceded
the first two places. Gaughran believes Brain Job is
in the best shape he has ever been in during a
collegiate season and looks forward to his winning
both the 100 and 200 breast. With the sprinters
performing so well Gaughran has high hopes in the
400 free relay where Stanford will battle USC and
Tennessee for first place.
Stanford also has a good chance to defend the
400 medley relay title if both Randy Whitchurch
and Rick Longinotti continue to improve. Other
potential finalists include Whitchurch in the 200
back, Martin Pedley, Dean Anderson and Ken
Hammer in the 50 and 100 free, Dave Shilling in the
100 and 200 breast, and Terry Sutten in the 500
and 1650 free Styles.

and UCLA in the Pacific-Eight swimming
championships at Lake Oswego, Oregon last
weekeend.
Almost every Stanford swimmer achieved a
season or lifetime best in at least one of the events
he swam. This was marked contrast to the
performances recorded last month in Los Angeles
against the Trojans and Bruins. Stanford was almost
able to redeem its dual meet loss to UCLA by
finishing only nine points behind the Bruins, 295 to
286. USC was an easy winner as they scored 549
points.
The story of the Indians' success was due largely
to the sprinters, who until this meet had been
somewhat of a disappointment as they had been
unable to score much needed dual meet points. In
spite of the pool, that was labled by numerous
swimmers as the slowest in the country, the
swimmers turned in some excellent performances.
Ken Hammer showed he had regained his 1968
form by placing fourth in the 50 free and third in
the 100 free, recording 21.92 and 47.86
respectively. Freshman Dean Anderson did an
outstanding job in placing third in the 50 in 21.86
and sixth in the 100 in 48.42. Junior Steve Carey
rebounded from a poor sophomore season by
placing sixth in the 50 and 11th in the 100 going
22.31 and 48.28.
Relay Team Second
The 400 free relay of Hammer, Anderson, Carey,
and Martin Pedley placed second behind USC.
Pedley who had not performed well in the 50 and
100 events earlier in the meet finally came around
as he anchored the relay in 46.2. Overall the
sprinters accounted for a big chunk of Stanford's
286 points.
Brian Job successfully defended his 100 and 200
breast titles. He set a new Pac-8 record in the 100 of
57.94 and won the 200 in a season best 2.05.78.
Stanford's other winner was freshman Randy
Whitchurch who won the 200 back in a lifetime best
1.55.98, while narrowly missing winning the 100
back in a season best 54.2.
Other Stanford swimmers who did well included:
Captain Dave Shilling who placed sth in the 100
and 200 breast; Terry Sutton placing fifth in the
500 free in a lifetime best of 4.44.74 and sixth in

the 1650 in a lifetime best of 16.33.3; Jack Deppe
who palced third in the 200 back in a season best of
1.59.0, and Rick Longinotti who placed fourth in
the 100 tly and eighth in the 200 fly, with his 200
time of 1.57.23 being a lifetime best.
Coach Jim Gaughran, not suprisingly, was quite
pleased with the results. In summing up the meet he
states, "Everyone is rounding into good shape now,
everybody is really starting to put it together. The
sprinters wen 1 particularly fast as they did some
amazing things." For Gaughran the drop in times at
the meet indicated that all the hard work that had
been done was paying off. He indicated that the big
improvements had generated a new excitement on
the team that he believes will carry over into the
NCAA Championships at West Point, March 23-25.
Extra Time Trial
To cap off the excellent results of the Pac-8 meet
Gaughran ran a time trial on Monday for those
swimmers who still hadn't made NCAA cut-off
times. The results were quite good and served as
further proof that the pool last weekend was indeed
slow. In the 50 free Dean Anderson did 21.3 and
Ken Hammer and Martin Pedley did 21.7. Either of
these times would have won the Pac-8 50 free. In
the 100 fly Rick Longinotti and Jock Stalker both
did 51.7, lifetime bests for both swimmers. In the
200 fly Longinotti did a lifetime best of 1.56.5. All
these times equaled or bettered NCAA cut-off
times.
Gaughran is now looking forward to the NCAA's
with great expectations. He figures Stanford will
battle for the third place spot with UCLA and
Tennessee, as Indiana and USC have been conceded
the first two places. Gaughran believes Brain Job is
in the best shape he has ever been in during a
collegiate season and looks forward to his winning
both the 100 and 200 breast. With the sprinters
performing so well Gaughran has high hopes in the
400 free relay where Stanford will battle USC and
Tennessee for first place.
Stanford also has a good chance to defend the
400 medley relay title if both Randy Whitchurch
and Rick Longinotti continue to improve. Other
potential finalists include Whitchurch in the 200
back, Martin Pedley, Dean Anderson and Ken
Hammer in the 50 and 100 free, Dave Shilling in the
100 and 200 breast, and Terry Sutten in the 500
and 1650 free Styles.

weekeend.
Almost every Stanford swimmer achieved a
season or lifetime best in at least one of the events
he swam. This was marked contrast to the
performances recorded last month in Los Angeles
against the Trojans and Bruins. Stanford was almost
able to redeem its dual meet loss to UCLA by
finishing only nine points behind the Bruins, 295 to
286. USC was an easy winner as they scored 549
points.
The story of the Indians' success was due largely
to the sprinters, who until this meet had been
somewhat of a disappointment as they had been
unable to score much needed dual meet points. In
spite of the pool, that was labled by numerous
swimmers as the slowest in the country, the
swimmers turned in some excellent performances.
Ken Hammer showed he had regained his 1968
form by placing fourth in the 50 free and third in
the 100 free, recording 21.92 and 47.86
respectively. Freshman Dean Anderson did an
outstanding job in placing third in the 50 in 21.86
and sixth in the 100 in 48.42. Junior Steve Carey
rebounded from a poor sophomore season by
placing sixth in the 50 and 11th in the 100 going
22.31 and 48.28.
Relay Team Second
The 400 free relay of Hammer, Anderson, Carey,
and Martin Pedley placed second behind USC.
Pedley who had not performed well in the 50 and
100 events earlier in the meet finally came around
as he anchored the relay in 46.2. Overall the
sprinters accounted for a big chunk of Stanford's
286 points.
Brian Job successfully defended his 100 and 200
breast titles. He set a new Pac-8 record in the 100 of
57.94 and won the 200 in a season best 2.05.78.
Stanford's other winner was freshman Randy
Whitchurch who won the 200 back in a lifetime best
1.55.98, while narrowly missing winning the 100
back in a season best 54.2.
Other Stanford swimmers who did well included:
Captain Dave Shilling who placed sth in the 100
and 200 breast; Terry Sutton placing fifth in the
500 free in a lifetime best of 4.44.74 and sixth in

the 1650 in a lifetime best of 16.33.3; Jack Deppe
who palced third in the 200 back in a season best of
1.59.0, and Rick Longinotti who placed fourth in
the 100 tly and eighth in the 200 fly, with his 200
time of 1.57.23 being a lifetime best.
Coach Jim Gaughran, not suprisingly, was quite
pleased with the results. In summing up the meet he
states, "Everyone is rounding into good shape now,
everybody is really starting to put it together. The
sprinters wen 1 particularly fast as they did some
amazing things." For Gaughran the drop in times at
the meet indicated that all the hard work that had
been done was paying off. He indicated that the big
improvements had generated a new excitement on
the team that he believes will carry over into the
NCAA Championships at West Point, March 23-25.
Extra Time Trial
To cap off the excellent results of the Pac-8 meet
Gaughran ran a time trial on Monday for those
swimmers who still hadn't made NCAA cut-off
times. The results were quite good and served as
further proof that the pool last weekend was indeed
slow. In the 50 free Dean Anderson did 21.3 and
Ken Hammer and Martin Pedley did 21.7. Either of
these times would have won the Pac-8 50 free. In
the 100 fly Rick Longinotti and Jock Stalker both
did 51.7, lifetime bests for both swimmers. In the
200 fly Longinotti did a lifetime best of 1.56.5. All
these times equaled or bettered NCAA cut-off
times.
Gaughran is now looking forward to the NCAA's
with great expectations. He figures Stanford will
battle for the third place spot with UCLA and
Tennessee, as Indiana and USC have been conceded
the first two places. Gaughran believes Brain Job is
in the best shape he has ever been in during a
collegiate season and looks forward to his winning
both the 100 and 200 breast. With the sprinters
performing so well Gaughran has high hopes in the
400 free relay where Stanford will battle USC and
Tennessee for first place.
Stanford also has a good chance to defend the
400 medley relay title if both Randy Whitchurch
and Rick Longinotti continue to improve. Other
potential finalists include Whitchurch in the 200
back, Martin Pedley, Dean Anderson and Ken
Hammer in the 50 and 100 free, Dave Shilling in the
100 and 200 breast, and Terry Sutten in the 500
and 1650 free Styles.
