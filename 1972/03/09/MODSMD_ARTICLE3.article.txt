# Teamsters, 'No Union' Apparent Vote Winners
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
A runoff election between
Teamsters local 856 and a "no union"
possibility appears to be the principal
result of Tuesday's NLRB (National
Labor Relations Board) election here.
Of 1303 valid votes counted, 483
were cast for "no union," 354 for the
Teamsters, 268 for the United
Stanford Employees (USE), 197 for
the Stanford Employees Association
(CSEA-SEA), and one vote for
Workers Action Caucus.
But the outcome of 180 challenge
ballots is likely to leave the final
decision on a runoff up in the air for
months.
In the smaller "A" and "B" units,
police and firemen have
overwhelmingly voted for union
representation. Thirty-nine votes were
cast for representation by the
International Association of Fire
Fighters with none opposed and no
challenge ballots. There were 27 votes
for representation by the Stanford
Police Officers Association, two votes
against, and three challenge ballots.
In the large unit of 1600, composed
of a variety of "maintenance"
workers, there will be a runoff election
between the two top vote getters since
no choice received a majority of votes.
At this time those two are "no union"
and the Teamsters. Although it is
possible for the challenge votes to
place another union in a runoff, even
USE representative Jan Sutter termed
that "not likely" although he said it
would be "conceivable."
Eligibility Question
The runoff election will be held
approximately one month after the
challenge ballots are resolved. NLRB
spokesman Alan Berkowitz said the
eligibility of the challenge ballots
would be determined either by an
administrative investigation or by a
hearing.
Challenge ballots were cast by
employees who felt for some reason
that they should be included in the
bargaining unit but have not been.
"We'll probably hold a hearing to
determine eligibility," he said. While
many of the challenge votes are in
large categories, the NLRB might have
to discuss each one individually.
Bradford Wells, a field examiner for
the NLRB, said that estimates of the
time involved for resolving the
challenges is from five months to a
year with six or seven months being
talked of most.
Keith Stothers, a member of the
Teamsters local organizing committee,
said Teamsters' attorneys estimate that
the challenge ballots will take only a
month to resolve.

The Teamsters were talking like
victors last night and already planning
for a run-off election. "You can
expect to see the Teamsters on the
campus with everything they've got,"
Stothers said. "We expect support
from both CSEA and USE," he
continued.
Prediction 'Exact'
Stothers said the election went
"exactly as people in our group
predicted it would go." He praised the
high turnout and concluded predicting
a victory for the Teamsters.
Forrest Futtere, vice-president of
CSEA-SEA, last night indicated that
his union would support the Teamsters
or any union in a runoff election. "I
would hope that we [Stanford
employees] will get union
representation on campus, even if it
means the Teamsters," he said. He
indicated that CSEA-SEA is probably
finished as a union at Stanford. He
said "we have not officially conceeded
although realistically" the union
doesn't have a chance with the
challenge ballots.
Money Shortage
Sutter claimed that with "another
$1000 we [USE] would have swept
this campaign." He said the Teamsters
were "victorious" largely because of
the input of money they had in the
election. He indicated that if the
Treamsters do go to the runoff
election, USE could be very influential
if they decide to support the

Teamsters. "We control the campus.
We know the people first hand.
They're [the Teamsters] going
nowhere without USE."
Rudy Thamm, secretary of
Teamsters local 856, last night
lambasted USE for their election
tactics. He claimed USE "is trying to
stall the election by 180 challenge
ballots. Their organization is just
trying to disrupt something that just
isn't there — to create confusion and
by stalling they are depriving someone
from getting pay increases." He
reiterated claims made throughout the
election that USE really is not "a trade
union as such." He termed USE
"destructive instead of being
constructive."
Support Predicted
While attacking USE, Thamm
predicted that it and CSEA-SEA
would support the Teamsters and"the
combined efforts of the three
organizations will defeat the
University." He said CSEA had already
pledged their support to the
Teamsters.
According to Sutter, over 400
challenge ballots were filed with the
NLRB, but reduced by agreement
among the parties to 180. Of this
group about 50 are computer
operators of some kind and over 80
employees at SLAC.
The election turnout was termed
very high by all unions involved.
