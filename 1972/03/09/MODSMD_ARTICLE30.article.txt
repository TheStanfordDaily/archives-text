### GEORGE DOBBINS 
The Theta Delts won the IM
basketball championship last
weekend. In the A Division finals,
they beat the Kappa Alphas 43 to
40, with Brad Lind scoring 11
points and Jim Marshall and Craig
Cross scoring 9 each.
For the KA's, Stan Bauken
scored 14 points and Doug Warner
9. The TD's assumed the lead
from the opening tip off but the
KA's kept within reach. At half
time, the score was the TD's 21
and KA's, 17.
During the second half, the
KA's initiated a full court press,
but guard Chris Martin helped the
Theta Delts overcome it. The tight

defense of the KA's gained them
nine fouls during the period while
the Theta Delts had eight. The
Theta Delts were taller, with an
average height of 6'7" on the
front line, and controlled the
boards.
In the semi-finals, the Theta
Delts defeated Cedro 42 to 36
with Lind, Cross and Dan
Broderick leading the attack.
Cedro put up a good battle, as
Kurt Peterson scored 13 and
Robert Rondeau had 11.
The game was close until the
last minute when Broderick was
fouled and placed in a 1 and 1
situation. He made both shots,
but missed a technical foul,

resulting from the verbosity of
the Cedro bench. After the foul
shots, the TD's went on to score
and won by six points.
The KA's met Nickel Bag, the
tournament's defending
champion, in the semi-finals.
Warner and Bauken were the
leading scorers with 19 and 14,
respectively. Jay Hoff and Mark
Hanson were high scorers for
Nickel Bag but their efforts were
not rewarded as the KA's won 48
to 46.
The B Division Championship
was won by the Delts who beat
the KA's by one point, 31 to 30.
The KA's made a basket at the
last minute, which would have put

them ahead, but the officials ruled
that it was made after the buzzer
sounded.
Pete Lazetich had 12 and Max
Goldstein 10 for the Delts; Randy-
Raines had 8 and Scott Stillinger
7 for the KA's. In the semi-finals,
the KA's beat the Theta Delts 27
to 25 and the Delts beat the
Stony Creek Freaks 44 to 33.

ended with Comp Sci winning the
inals over Biz 11, 3 to 2. In the
semi-finals, Biz II shut out
Education, scoring 2 goals and
Comp Sci shut out the Alpha
Delts, 1-0.
