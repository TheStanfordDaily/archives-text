# Cards Drop Two
## 
### BILL CLASTER 
Stanford's basketball team ended another so-so season last
weekend with a pair of losses to UCLA and USC.
The Friday night loss to the Trojans was a real disappointment to
the Cards, as they really thought they could upset their injury-ridden
opponents.
USC iumped out to a quick 8-0 lead, but Stanford fought back
to make it 10-8 Then with 15 minutes to play in the half, Claude
Terry was poked in the eye on a rebound attempt and was forced to
the sidelines.
Terry stayed out the remainder of the half, as the Trojans built up
a 38-30 halftime lead. The margin had reached 16 at 38-22, but Bob
Buell scored the last six points of the half and combined with Dave
Frost to cut the lead to eight.
USC came out firing in the second half and quickly built their lead
up to 55-38. At this point Terry returned to the game still hampered
by double vision in his right eye. Claude did not really play that well
(he shot 6 for 20 from the field) % but his return seemed to inspire the
Cards.
Cards Close Gap
Stanford gradually chopped away at the Trojan lead until they cut
it to three points with ten minutes to play. That was as close as they
could get however, as two lay-ups by SC's Brian Heublein clinched
the game for the Southerners, 71-65.
A great deal of credit for triggering Stanford's ill-fated comeback
must go to senior guard Gary Cain. Cain was all over the court and
forced numerous Trojan turnovers. Although only s'B", he picked off
5 rebounds and generally displayed a remarkable amount of hustle.
Dave Frost led the Stanford scoring with 14, and Mike Mann and
Terry each added 12. Forward Joe Mackey led USC with 20 points,
18 of which came in a sizzling first half performance. The Cards shot
44% from the field to the Trojans' 33%, but got off 14 less shots than
their taller foes.
On Saturday night Stanford was neither surprised or disappointed
by their performance. As expected, UCLA's mighty Bruins simply
outran and outjumped the Cards to rack up a routine 102-73 triumph.
The Uclans did not actually play that well, as they committed
numerous turnovers and did not shoot as high a percentage as usual.
Still, their press and their rebounding were nothing short of awesome.
Comfortable Lead
The Bruins jumped to a comfortable 22-9 lead as the Stanford zone
conceded the Bruins the outside shot. This strategy proved to be
disastrous, but probably not any more so than if the Cards had given
them the inside shot.
Sharp play by Gary Cain and a hot streak by Claude Terry kept
Stanford close at 43-31 with a minute to play in the first half.
However, the Bruins ran off a quick two baskets to take a 16 point
halftime lead and remove any trace of doubt about the final outcome.
Stanford was led by sophomore forward Dave Frost who pumped
in a season high of 25 points. Terry ended his brilliant career with a
22 point showing and a record total of 1566 for three seasons. He
received standing ovations both when he was introduced and when he
left the game with 3:13 to play.
For the Bruins, Greg Lee topped the scorers with 16. The
sophomore guard was the beneficiary of the Stanford zone which
concentrated on stopping Bill Walton underneath. Lee's passing on
fast breaks was especially impressive, as he and teammate Henry
Bibby led the running Uclans to their 40th consecutive victory.
Walton Hindered
Center Bill Walton was held to 15, but was the dominating force
under both backboards. Also impressive for the Bruins were reserves
Larry Hollyfield and Swen Nater. Hollyfield dazzled the crowd with
an amazing display of moves, while Nater came in and scored ten
points in just a few minutes of action.
Stanford finished the year with a 10-15 record, a definite
improvement over the marks of the past two years. Again the Cards
were hampered by a lack of rebounding. Next year this problem
should be solved with the addition of 7'o" freshman Rich Kelley.
However, with the loss of Claude Terry, the Cards will have to come
up with some top flight guards if they are to continue their
improvement.
