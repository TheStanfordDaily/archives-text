## A 						Guide To Decisionmaking 
### Charlie Hoffman 
For years, students have been
bitterly protesting the decision
making process on campus. There
have been many complaints about
the arbitrary rulings that have
come crashing down from the
President's Office, the SJC, and
now the CJP.
A large number of students
have not come into contact with
or examined closely the decision
making bodies that run the
University and consequently have
not had any complaints. The
arbitrariness of the campus
powers has come clear to whole
new range of students, however,
with the handling of the issue of
the American Indian as the
University's symbol.
President Lyman and
Ombudsman Lois Amsterdam
supported the petition of 55
Native Americans on campus to
remove the Indian as the school's
symbol, sparking a wave of
protest from students, alumni,
and Native Americans throughout
California.
The highest Indian
representatives in the state
governments of California and
Nevada have expressed strong
sentiments for retaining the
Indian as Stanford's symbol and
their people have signed petitions
supporting them.
The Indian symbol issue has
attracted enough attention to
prompt eighth grade students in

Fort Dick, California to write to
the ASSU Presidents,. One
student, Cheryl Plumlee wrote, "I
am writing this so you will know
that I want you to keep the
Stanford Indian because he has
donated his free time without
being paid. This is his dream. You
should not tear it down. He
represents all Indian tribes. Please
keep him in."
The issue of Stanford's symbol
has attracted national attention
and has drawn the reactions of
many members of the University
community. Presidential Assistant
William Stone stated that because
of the importance of the issue,
great care would be taken before
any action was taken.
