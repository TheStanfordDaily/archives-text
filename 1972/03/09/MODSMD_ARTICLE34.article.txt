The Stanford wrestling team
finished in last place in the
Pacific-Eight wrestling
championships last weekend at
Seattle.
Stanford was only able to score
one point in the meet as the
Indians top two wrestlers Ken
Krebs and Chris Horpel were
unable to win. Stanford's lone
point was scored by Bob
Sweetman in the consulations of
the 126 lb. division. Sweetman's
performance is quite amazing as
he is blind.

Yet, the Student Senate has
already done away with the
symbol after no study of the
controversy, and although a
Presidential commission is being
set up, Lyman stated Tuesday
that, "Realistically speaking, it's
just about inconceivable that the
committee is going to recommend
the reinstatement of the Indian
symbol."
This issue should by no means
be settled in such a perfunctory
manner. There are strong feelings
and valid points on both sides and
a President who has made up his
mind before any serious study has
been undertaken is doing his
community a great disservice.
