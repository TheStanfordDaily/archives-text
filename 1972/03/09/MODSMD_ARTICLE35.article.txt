Stanford's Lacrosse team

with a 7-6 come from behind
victory last Saturday over the
Naval Postgraduate Academy.
The NPGA took a 5-2 halftime

with one goal in the third period
and three in the final frame while
holding their opponents to one
goal in earning their first victory.
Butch Hazlett was the
offensive star for the Indians,
scoring five goals. Shelly Gordon
also contributed a score.
This Sunday at 1 p.m., the
Cards will face the Golden Gate
