# Dolly Still Seeks Hospital Job
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Revolutionary John Dolly may be
about to face the bewildering prospect
of a layoff from a job he does not
have.
Even though he has been returned
to the University payroll, no one has
found work for Dolly in the two
months since a grievance panel
rejected the Administration's attempts
to fire the Venceremos activist for his
role in last April's Hospital sit-in.
The grievance committee found late
last November that Dolly's role in the
sit-in was "minimal indeed" and
recommended his immediate rehiring.
But ever since, the question has been
exactly what job Dolly would return
to.
Before his dismissal, Dolly was an
assistant in a genetics laboratory at the
Medical School. But his old job has
since been filled by a new employee.
Layoff Seen
Genetics Department Chairman
Joshua Lederberg said if Dolly is not
offered a new job in the University "in
the next few days, I'll simply have to
tell him he's being laid off until we
find him a job." Dolly would then lose
his salary.
Even though he was cleared of the
sit-in charges, Dolly believes that
department officials at the Medical
Center have rejected him for new jobs
because of his political views.
"This is a bureaucratic version of a
political firing," Dolly charged.
Solution Attempted
In an apparent effort to solve the
dispute over Dolly's work assignment,
Medical School Dean Clayton Rich last
week sent Lederberg a letter flatly
announcing, "1 am returning him to
his former position as a part-time
employee of Dr. (Leonard) Herzenberg
in your department."
But Lederberg said he may now be
forced to fire Dolly because returning
him to Herzenberg's laboratory
"would be counterproductive for the
operation of the laboratory and the
people who have come in since."
Herzenberg, who employs another
Venceremos member in his laboratory,
is active in the anti-war movement and
opposed Dolly's dismissal. But the
geneticist insisted he could not take
Dolly back "because there are no
available jobs in this laboratory."
Job Filled
Herzenberg said that at the time of
Dolly's firing he warned University
officials that Dolly's old position
would be filled with a replacement
"who we could not just shuffle out"
later on.
Yesterday, Herzenberg charged that
Rich's order to return Dolly to the
Herzenberg lab was "inappropriate and
illegal" because Herzenberg's research
is sponsored with outside funds under

Herzenberg's responsibility.
Rich was out of town yesterday
and could not be reached for
comment. But Associate Dean Robert
G. Lindee predicted that Rich will
"take a second look" at his order
when he learns that Herzenberg
definitely will not accept his mandate.
Lindee said that Rich ordered
Dolly's return to Herzenberg's
laboratory because he thought "that
ample time had gone by" in efforts to
find a new job for Dolly.
Lederberg said, "There has been a
diligent effort to find [Dolly] a new
job within the Medical Center."
But Dolly charged he has been
rejected for at least five openings by
Medical Center officials who oppose
his radical politics.
"They don't want someone who
might organize people in their
department," Dolly insisted.
Genetics Department Business

Manager Donald Stuedeman agreed
that administrators were rejecting
Dolly because they "don't want to get
involved."
Stuedeman also said he "gathered
the impression" that the Medical
Center's placement office has "done
very little" to find Dolly a job since
his arrest at a campus protest, Feb. 7.
But a spokesman for that office
said it has been actively working to
find a job for Dolly and denied that
his arrest had affected the effort.
Dolly admitted he has failed to
keep in touch with the larger
personnel office which places workers
throughout the University. He said he
would ask that office to reactivate his
application there.
If he is laid off, Dolly said he would
consider a court suit, charging the
university with "political
discrimination" in its employment
practices.

the impression" that the Medical
Center's placement office has "done
very little" to find Dolly a job since
his arrest at a campus protest, Feb. 7.
But a spokesman for that office
said it has been actively working to
find a job for Dolly and denied that
his arrest had affected the effort.
Dolly admitted he has failed to
keep in touch with the larger
personnel office which places workers
throughout the University. He said he
would ask that office to reactivate his
application there.
If he is laid off, Dolly said he would
consider a court suit, charging the
university with "political
discrimination" in its employment
practices.
Revolutionary John Dolly may be
about to face the bewildering prospect
of a layoff from a job he does not
have.
Even though he has been returned
to the University payroll, no one has
found work for Dolly in the two
months since a grievance panel
rejected the Administration's attempts
to fire the Venceremos activist for his
role in last April's Hospital sit-in.
The grievance committee found late
last November that Dolly's role in the
sit-in was "minimal indeed" and
recommended his immediate rehiring.
But ever since, the question has been
exactly what job Dolly would return
to.
Before his dismissal, Dolly was an
assistant in a genetics laboratory at the
Medical School. But his old job has
since been filled by a new employee.
Layoff Seen
Genetics Department Chairman
Joshua Lederberg said if Dolly is not
offered a new job in the University "in
the next few days, I'll simply have to
tell him he's being laid off until we
find him a job." Dolly would then lose
his salary.
Even though he was cleared of the
sit-in charges, Dolly believes that
department officials at the Medical
Center have rejected him for new jobs
because of his political views.
"This is a bureaucratic version of a
political firing," Dolly charged.
Solution Attempted
In an apparent effort to solve the
dispute over Dolly's work assignment,
Medical School Dean Clayton Rich last
week sent Lederberg a letter flatly
announcing, "1 am returning him to
his former position as a part-time
employee of Dr. (Leonard) Herzenberg
in your department."
But Lederberg said he may now be
forced to fire Dolly because returning
him to Herzenberg's laboratory
"would be counterproductive for the
operation of the laboratory and the
people who have come in since."
Herzenberg, who employs another
Venceremos member in his laboratory,
is active in the anti-war movement and
opposed Dolly's dismissal. But the
geneticist insisted he could not take
Dolly back "because there are no
available jobs in this laboratory."
Job Filled
Herzenberg said that at the time of
Dolly's firing he warned University
officials that Dolly's old position
would be filled with a replacement
"who we could not just shuffle out"
later on.
Yesterday, Herzenberg charged that
Rich's order to return Dolly to the
Herzenberg lab was "inappropriate and
illegal" because Herzenberg's research
is sponsored with outside funds under

Herzenberg's responsibility.
Rich was out of town yesterday
and could not be reached for
comment. But Associate Dean Robert
G. Lindee predicted that Rich will
"take a second look" at his order
when he learns that Herzenberg
definitely will not accept his mandate.
Lindee said that Rich ordered
Dolly's return to Herzenberg's
laboratory because he thought "that
ample time had gone by" in efforts to
find a new job for Dolly.
Lederberg said, "There has been a
diligent effort to find [Dolly] a new
job within the Medical Center."
But Dolly charged he has been
rejected for at least five openings by
Medical Center officials who oppose
his radical politics.
"They don't want someone who
might organize people in their
department," Dolly insisted.

Manager Donald Stuedeman agreed
that administrators were rejecting
Dolly because they "don't want to get
