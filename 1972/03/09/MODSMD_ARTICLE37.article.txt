# Lyman Eyes COSS Report
## 
### 
President Richard Lyman yesterday
reiterated his conviction that the issue of
recruitment policy is the "inescapable
responsibility" for the President of Stanford to
decide, considering the "profound effects" a
decision to ban military recruiting could have
on the University.
Lyman called the proposal of the Committee
on Student Services (COSS) to ban military
recruiting "utterly irresponsible" if taken
without regard to the financial loss to the
University. Lyman's frequently stated opinion
is in favor of open recruiting.
In a reply to the COSS report released last
week, he added he was asking the advice of the
deans of Stanford's seven schools, as well as the
Steering Committee of the faculty Senate, for
advice on banning military recruiting, given the
$16 million annual loss of DoD and NASA
contracts that probably would result.
Lyman felt the rider on military

appropriations which would withdraw the
funds "eventually will be changed." However,
COSS recommended that Stanford challenge
these measures in court as well. Considering the
small chance of a favorable result, Lyman will
not follow the recommendation to make a
challenge "regardless of the likelihood of
success."
Seeking student advice on recruiting through
a referendum would be "useful," Lyman said,
but he did not feel it could deal adequately
with the complexities of the issue. Also, no
referendum could be "binding on policy," he
added.
Recommendation OK'd
Lyman approved of the recommendation to
provide more information on companies which
recruit at the Placement Center. The Dean of
Students and the Placement Center director
have been asked to develop workable measures
for putting this into effect.
