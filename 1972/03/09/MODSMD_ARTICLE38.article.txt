Bomb Rips TWA Jet
LAS VEGAS, Nev. — A bomb ripped a hole in an
unoccupied Trans World Airlines jetliner here yesterday,
the second bomb in two days attributed by authorities to
a $2-million extortion scheme against the airline.
The bombing triggered an intensified search of TWA's
238 planes at airports all over the world. At some airports
all passengers boarding all planes were searched, as was
baggage and freight.
The bomb aboard the Boeing 707 exploded at 3:55
a.m., about seven hours after the plan arrived nonstop
from New York. The blast blew a large hole in the front
fuselage, throwing debris about 100 feet at McCarran
International Airport. It was parked about 300 yards from
the main terminal.
Tuesday, a plastic explosive device was sniffed out by
dogs in a cockpit of a TWA jetliner called back to
Kennedy International Airport in New York from a flight
to Los Angeles.
An anonymous caller had warned of the bomb and
directed officials to an airport locker where they found a
note saying that four TWA planes would be blown up at
six-hour intervals unless $2-million ransom was paid.
The succeeding deadlines passed without incident. The
bombing in Las Vegas came an hour before one of the
six-hour periods.
The FBI, TWA and local authorities have refused to say
if they would negotiate with the extortionist or whether
any money has been paid.
Muskie Leads Delegate Count
MANCHESTER, N.H. — Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine
pulled ahead in his fight to gain a majority of New
Hampshire's Democratic National Convention delegates as
the votes were counted yesterday.
It was Phase 2 of the Tuesday presidential primary
(story on page ten).
With 91 percent of the state's precincts reporting,
Muskie held a 15-5 lead over Senator George McGovern in
the balloting for delegates.
The close race for the delegates was even more
surprising than McGovern's preferential primary showing,
as Muskie managers had expected a sweep of the 20
convention slots. New Hampshire will cast 18 nominating

votes at the national convention in Miami Beach, Fla.
Each delegate elected in the Tuesday balloting will get
9-10s of a vote.
Nixon Mum On Busing
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's stand on school
busing will remain a secret until after the Florida primary
next Tuesday.
The White House announced Tuesday that Nixon will
study the busing situation during a weekend stay at Camp
David, Md., but will withhold his decision on the issue
until after the Florida voting.
In addition to expressing their preference in the
presidential race, Florida voters will also vote on a
referendum calling for a constitutional amendment to ban
busing.
Nixon has expressed his opposition to widespread
busing of children to achieve racial integration, but hasn't
selected from the various proposed solutions to the
problem.
White House press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said
Nixon doesn't want to influence the Florida primary vote,
nor does he want it to influence his decision.
ITT Hearings Continue
WASHINGTON — Former Asst. Atty. Gen. Richard L.
McLaren expressed outrage yesterday at the way a Senate
committee is looking into the out-of-court settlement of
an antitrust suit against International Telephone &
Telegraph Corp.
McLaren, now a federal judge in Chicago, said
Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee are out of
bounds in probing the settlement and its relationship with
a financial commitment from the conglomerate to the
Republican National Convention in San Diego.
McLaren and Acting Atty. Gen. Richard G. Kleindienst
repeatedly have denied there was any connection between
the convention pledge and a decision against taking the
ITT case to the Supreme Court. McLaren headed the
Justice Department's antitrust division at the time of the
settlement.
The committee, which once voted to approve the
Kleindienst nomination to the top Justice post, called a
new hearing at Kleindienst's request when, columnist Jack
Anderson published a memo written by Mrs. Dita Beard, a
Washington lobbyist for ITT.
Berrigan Informer Examined
HARRISBURG, Pa. — Boyd F. Douglas Jr. admitted
under cross-examination yesterday that he voluntarily
began a dossier for the FBI after his first meeting with the
Rev. Philip Berrigan. He said he envisioned himself as a
future government agent.
"You were collecting information for the FBI then and
without their knowledge or consent?" Douglas was asked
at the federal antiwar conspiracy trial of Berrigan and six
codefendants.
"That is correct," Douglas responded in the concise
tones that have marked his eight days on the witness
stand.
In a second day of cross-examination, the defense
continued to stress the theme that Douglas was an FBI
plant inside the penitentiary to entrap Berrigan and his
fellow antiwar activists.
The seven defendants are charged with conspiring to
kidnap presidential adviser Henry A. Kissinger, to blow up
heating tunnels in Washington and to vandalize draft
boards in several states.

Berrigan Informer Examined
HARRISBURG, Pa. — Boyd F. Douglas Jr. admitted
under cross-examination yesterday that he voluntarily
began a dossier for the FBI after his first meeting with the
Rev. Philip Berrigan. He said he envisioned himself as a
future government agent.
"You were collecting information for the FBI then and
without their knowledge or consent?" Douglas was asked
at the federal antiwar conspiracy trial of Berrigan and six
codefendants.
"That is correct," Douglas responded in the concise
tones that have marked his eight days on the witness
stand.
In a second day of cross-examination, the defense
continued to stress the theme that Douglas was an FBI
plant inside the penitentiary to entrap Berrigan and his
fellow antiwar activists.
The seven defendants are charged with conspiring to
kidnap presidential adviser Henry A. Kissinger, to blow up
heating tunnels in Washington and to vandalize draft
boards in several states.
Bomb Rips TWA Jet
LAS VEGAS, Nev. — A bomb ripped a hole in an
unoccupied Trans World Airlines jetliner here yesterday,
the second bomb in two days attributed by authorities to
a $2-million extortion scheme against the airline.
The bombing triggered an intensified search of TWA's
238 planes at airports all over the world. At some airports
all passengers boarding all planes were searched, as was
baggage and freight.
The bomb aboard the Boeing 707 exploded at 3:55
a.m., about seven hours after the plan arrived nonstop
from New York. The blast blew a large hole in the front
fuselage, throwing debris about 100 feet at McCarran
International Airport. It was parked about 300 yards from
the main terminal.
Tuesday, a plastic explosive device was sniffed out by
dogs in a cockpit of a TWA jetliner called back to
Kennedy International Airport in New York from a flight
to Los Angeles.
An anonymous caller had warned of the bomb and
directed officials to an airport locker where they found a
note saying that four TWA planes would be blown up at
six-hour intervals unless $2-million ransom was paid.
The succeeding deadlines passed without incident. The
bombing in Las Vegas came an hour before one of the
six-hour periods.
The FBI, TWA and local authorities have refused to say
if they would negotiate with the extortionist or whether
any money has been paid.
Muskie Leads Delegate Count
MANCHESTER, N.H. — Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine
pulled ahead in his fight to gain a majority of New
Hampshire's Democratic National Convention delegates as
the votes were counted yesterday.
It was Phase 2 of the Tuesday presidential primary
(story on page ten).
With 91 percent of the state's precincts reporting,
Muskie held a 15-5 lead over Senator George McGovern in
the balloting for delegates.
The close race for the delegates was even more
surprising than McGovern's preferential primary showing,
as Muskie managers had expected a sweep of the 20
convention slots. New Hampshire will cast 18 nominating

votes at the national convention in Miami Beach, Fla.
Each delegate elected in the Tuesday balloting will get
9-10s of a vote.
Nixon Mum On Busing
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's stand on school
busing will remain a secret until after the Florida primary
next Tuesday.
The White House announced Tuesday that Nixon will
study the busing situation during a weekend stay at Camp
David, Md., but will withhold his decision on the issue
until after the Florida voting.
In addition to expressing their preference in the
presidential race, Florida voters will also vote on a
referendum calling for a constitutional amendment to ban
busing.
Nixon has expressed his opposition to widespread
busing of children to achieve racial integration, but hasn't
selected from the various proposed solutions to the
problem.
White House press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said
Nixon doesn't want to influence the Florida primary vote,
nor does he want it to influence his decision.
ITT Hearings Continue
WASHINGTON — Former Asst. Atty. Gen. Richard L.
McLaren expressed outrage yesterday at the way a Senate
committee is looking into the out-of-court settlement of
an antitrust suit against International Telephone &
Telegraph Corp.
McLaren, now a federal judge in Chicago, said
Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee are out of
bounds in probing the settlement and its relationship with
a financial commitment from the conglomerate to the
Republican National Convention in San Diego.
McLaren and Acting Atty. Gen. Richard G. Kleindienst
repeatedly have denied there was any connection between
the convention pledge and a decision against taking the
ITT case to the Supreme Court. McLaren headed the
Justice Department's antitrust division at the time of the
settlement.
