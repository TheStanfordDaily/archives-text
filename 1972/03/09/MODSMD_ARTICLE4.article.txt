# 40 Interrupt Session Of Academic Council
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Approximately 40 members of the
Stanford Rehabilitation Movement
(SRM) interrupted the Winter Quarter
meeting of the Academic Council in
the Physics Tank Friday during
President Lyman's report to the
Council.
Six of the 40 read a statement to
the meeting after consent was given by
a majority of the Council. Lyman said
there would be "little to be gained
from supressing the statement." About
30 Council members walked out of the
meeting to the jeers of the protesters
after the vote was taken.
The SRM statement demanded the
Council reconsider the dismissal of
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin and exercise
its power to reinstate him.
Inquiry Demanded
The statement also demanded that
the Council investigate charges that
Prof. William Shockley "is actively
urging and inciting genocide and that
he allows his racism to carry over into
the classroom."
The statement also demanded that
the Council oppose war recruitment at
the Placement Center and the further
functioning of the Campus Judicial
Panel. Three of those who read the
statement are currently defendants
before the CJP.
The 40 protesters had entered the
meeting after Secretary to the
University Frederic Glover, standing at
the door of the building, had
repeatedly warned the meeting was
"limited to Academic Council and
staff."
Questions
After the protesters had finished

their statement, Lyman opened the
floor to questions. Electrical
Engineering Professor Shockley said
"with regard to interference with
internal functions, I consider the
disruption of my classes less severe
than the interference with my giving
courses" in genetics and racial
intelligence. Shockley was referring to
his attempts to get academic credit for
a SWOPSI course and a graduate
special on his theories.
After the question period, the
Council discussed and then defeated,
94-62, a motion by SLAC Professor
Pierre Noyes for the Faculty Senate to
clarify its position on sponsored
research policy, particularly when
external restraints may affect internal
campus matters, such as recruiting. He
was referring to the $16 million in
DoD and NASA contracts which
Stanford might lose by a ban on
military recruiting.
Franklin Matter
In his statement to the Council,
President Lyman dealt extensively
with the firing of Franklin. In
discussing some of the "reactionary"
mail he had received praising
Franklin's firing, Lyman said most of
it had "come from people having no
connection with Stanford."
Believing the decision to fire
Franklin had been misunderstood,
Lyman said "anyone who is genuinely
concerned for the preservation of
academic freedom ought to give
recognition to the fact" that those
involved in the decision sincerely
believed they were dealing with a
dangerous element within the
University.

a majority of the Council. Lyman said
there would be "little to be gained
from supressing the statement." About
30 Council members walked out of the
meeting to the jeers of the protesters
after the vote was taken.
The SRM statement demanded the
Council reconsider the dismissal of
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin and exercise
its power to reinstate him.
Inquiry Demanded
The statement also demanded that
the Council investigate charges that
Prof. William Shockley "is actively
urging and inciting genocide and that
he allows his racism to carry over into
the classroom."
The statement also demanded that
the Council oppose war recruitment at
the Placement Center and the further
functioning of the Campus Judicial
Panel. Three of those who read the
statement are currently defendants
before the CJP.
The 40 protesters had entered the
meeting after Secretary to the
University Frederic Glover, standing at
the door of the building, had
repeatedly warned the meeting was
"limited to Academic Council and
staff."
Questions
After the protesters had finished

their statement, Lyman opened the
floor to questions. Electrical
Engineering Professor Shockley said
"with regard to interference with
internal functions, I consider the
disruption of my classes less severe
than the interference with my giving
courses" in genetics and racial
intelligence. Shockley was referring to
his attempts to get academic credit for
a SWOPSI course and a graduate
special on his theories.
After the question period, the
Council discussed and then defeated,
94-62, a motion by SLAC Professor
Pierre Noyes for the Faculty Senate to
clarify its position on sponsored
research policy, particularly when
external restraints may affect internal
campus matters, such as recruiting. He
was referring to the $16 million in
DoD and NASA contracts which
Stanford might lose by a ban on
military recruiting.
Franklin Matter
In his statement to the Council,
President Lyman dealt extensively
with the firing of Franklin. In
discussing some of the "reactionary"
mail he had received praising
Franklin's firing, Lyman said most of
it had "come from people having no
connection with Stanford."
Believing the decision to fire
Franklin had been misunderstood,
Lyman said "anyone who is genuinely
concerned for the preservation of
academic freedom ought to give
recognition to the fact" that those
involved in the decision sincerely
believed they were dealing with a
dangerous element within the
University.

Approximately 40 members of the
Stanford Rehabilitation Movement
(SRM) interrupted the Winter Quarter
meeting of the Academic Council in
the Physics Tank Friday during
President Lyman's report to the
Council.
Six of the 40 read a statement to
the meeting after consent was given by
a majority of the Council. Lyman said
there would be "little to be gained
from supressing the statement." About
30 Council members walked out of the
meeting to the jeers of the protesters
after the vote was taken.
