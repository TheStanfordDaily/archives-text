## A 						Debate Challenge 
### 
The First Amendment of our
constitution gives me the privilege
of challenging to debate
Professors Cavalli -Sforza,
Cronbach, and Ehrlich who have
in these columns attacked my
competence to make suggestions
in their fields of expertise. This
privilege is itself my chief answer
to Professor Brown's denigration
of my faith in the First
Amendment. As for his other
comments, 1 suggest that readers
compare my writings with his
misinterpretations of them. His
position typifies in my opinion
what I have called the "Speer
syndrome."
My faith in the power of
reason and the basic wisdom of
our citizens make me regard the
First Amendment as the "rope"
and our nation's communications
media as the "pulleys" in a system
for exerting a force on the
"rudder of public opinion" so as

to iurn the "ship of civilization"
away from the dysgenic "storm"
that I fear is rising over the
horizon of the future. Through
this column I am attempting to
exert a tug on this rope.
My focus on genetics in
psychology is concentrated on a
narrow, but very significant, and
woefully misrepresented topic —
geneticity of IQ. In this area of his
expertise, I challenge Professor
Crombach to make good in public
debate his assertion (Daily, 23
Feb 72): "If I did not have better
use for my time and if others had
not done the job so well, I would
publish rejoinders to Shockley." I
state the challenge in the form of
a resolution based on the
"more-than-twice" statement of
my KAPPAN article — a
resolution presented and tabled,
as usual, at the 1971 Autumn
Meeting of the National Academy
of Sciences:

"Whereas, estimates of the
level of significance by Academy
member Shockley lead to the
conclusion that, if environmental
influences on IQ variance were as
large as 30%, then there is only
one chance in 2,000 that the
listing by A.R. Jensen of the IQs
for 122 pairs of separately reared,
white identical twins [compiled
from four independent studies
from England, Denmark and the
U.S.A.] would have [fooled us by
pure chance effects so that we
would be erroneously] led to an
observed value of less than 15%
and
"Whereas, the report of the
Davis committee [of the National
Academy of Sciences in keeping
with Professors Crombach,
Cavalli-Sforza, and Ehrlich] does
not assert that in any case genes
dominate the important behavior
trait of IQ; therefore,
"It is resolved that the Council
[of the N.A.S.] be requested to
arrange for a review of the
significance level calculations and
to issue an appropriate statement
to resolve the related
en vironment-heredity
uncertainty."
It is to this "cornerstone"
assertion, that is the subject of my
second round in the
Shockley-Gage Debate in
KAPPAN, that I challenge
Professor Cronbach to make a
rejoinder in keeping with the
academic objective of creating and
disseminating knowledge. I do not
claim more for this assertion than
that it is important to the
foundation of the logical structure
of knowledge about the behavior
genetics of humans. For this
reason I have urged its evaluation
in contributed papers at N.A.S.
meetings and elsewhere for the
last five years. A poll by one of
my student assistants last year
indicated that my "cornerstone"
assertion was vigorously rejected
by the psychology community.
What is wrong with my one
chance in 2,000 estimate of
significance level, Professor
Crombach?
Unsearch Dogmatism
Professors Cavalli-Sforza and
Ehrlich join Professor Cronbach in
what I have diagnosted in
KAPPAN as "unsearch
dogmatism" in rejecting what my
resolution asserts. In addition,
they denigrate my research
suggestions and preliminary
findings in population genetics
research. Professor Ehrlich writes:
"Shockley is simply attempting
unsuccessfully to come to grips
with undergraduate genetics."
Professor Cavalli-Sforza cites
against me a paper of Professor

T.E. Reed of Toronto, the
inventor of the phrase "Caucasian
gene" for Duffy's gene, who
described my estimate of the
variance of the Caucasian ancestry
of the Oakland Negro population
as "an obscure method". It was
far less obscure than the
announcement of Hooke's law in
an anagram by its creator. 1
spelled out explicitly the fact that
assortative mating was involved
and that, like Hooke's Law,
phenotype frequencies were
substantially linear in M (M is the
fraction of Caucasian ancestry)
for Duffy's gene, but that
quadratic terms dominate for the
Gm system. Since presenting my
paper, the research of George R.
Price on "Extension of the
Hardy-Weinberg Law to
assortative mating" [Ann. Hum.
Gen. (1971, 34, 455] has come to
my attention. Price's publication
is a more complete presentation
of his work than mine is of my
theory, but he did not find, as I
did in Reed's data, an actual
application such as my paper
described: "Hardy-Weinberg Law
Generalized to Estimate Hybrid
Variance for Negro Populations
and Reduce Racial Aspects of the
Environment-Heredity
Uncertainty." [Proc. N.A.S.
(1971), 68, 1390 A]
It seems to me that Professors
Ehrlich and Cavalli-Sforza might
have grasped the scientific novelty
of my suggestion had they not
concentrated on attempts to
discredit my analytic capacities (a
look in Who's Who at my
operations research experience
might have suggested that I am
not a one-discipline researcher.)
The aim of treating and
disseminating knowledge might
have been better served by a
lesearch approach on their part.
But perhaps I am in error. If so,
Professor Ehrlich or Professor
Cavalli-Sforza should be able to
explain in open debate the blocks
on the research path that I have
proposed.
Adequate Test
The geneticity of IQ and the
determination of hybrid variance
are two debate topics that are
adequate to test the conclusion,
based on my research on
methodology to reduce the
environment-heredity uncertainty,
that distinguished Stanford full
professors do indeed encourage
research taboos. Obviously, these
two debate topics treat only a
fraction of the human quality
problems involved. However,
extending the area of debate at
this point of discussion even to
the degree suggested by a list of
references like that cited by

William shockley

Professor Cavalli-Sforza seems to
me like considering all possible
proposals for perpetual motion
machines before reaching an
accord on the first and second
laws of thermodynamics.
Furthermore, a debate on these
two topics can be kept
sufficiently simple without
sacrifice of exactness so that the
non-specialist but logical listener
would be able to evaluate for
himself whether my opponents or
I have the stronger case in the
limited but significant area
involved.
A debate of the sort that I
proposed would contribute to
overcoming the distrust in the
integrity of the American system
on the part of idealistic college
youth. I stressed this
disillusionment with the American
system in my interview with a
Daily reporter as discussed in my
letter of March 1 in these columns
and had the same idea in mind
when I stated at the Academic
Council Meeting on March 3 that
the atmosphere at Stanford
warranted [in the minds of the
students] disruption of classes
taught by me. Indeed, if
disruption of an Academic
Council Meeting is accepted as an
appropriate way of obtaining a
forum, what is inappropriate
about disrupting a Shockley class
examination on quantum physics
of solids? If the chairman of the
Academic Council is prepared to
encourage the members of the
Council to listen to charges that I
am "actively urging and inciting
genocide where there is a clear
and present danger that it will
occur", why does he not offer, in
response to my appeal, to help me
obtain suitable circumstances for
a debate on the logical aspects of
the relevant issues?"
Debate Needed
I believe that a debate
sponsored by Stanford University
— if there is nobody to do so, one
is surely needed - directed to
search for truth on the two
subjects that I have proposed
would furnish a much needed
example of what higher education
is all about — the use of the mind
to determine relative truths. This
important idea was in mind when,
in response to the disruptors*
demands at the Council Meeting,
as reported in the Palo Alto Times
of March 4, I issued the debate
challenge that I have spelled out
in detail in this Opinion Position.
I hope that my three fellow
professors will respond so that
arrangements can be made.

paper, the research of George R.
Price on "Extension of the
Hardy-Weinberg Law to
assortative mating" [Ann. Hum.
Gen. (1971, 34, 455] has come to
my attention. Price's publication
is a more complete presentation
of his work than mine is of my
theory, but he did not find, as I
did in Reed's data, an actual
application such as my paper
described: "Hardy-Weinberg Law
Generalized to Estimate Hybrid
Variance for Negro Populations
and Reduce Racial Aspects of the
Environment-Heredity
Uncertainty." [Proc. N.A.S.
(1971), 68, 1390 A]
It seems to me that Professors
Ehrlich and Cavalli-Sforza might
have grasped the scientific novelty
of my suggestion had they not
concentrated on attempts to
discredit my analytic capacities (a
look in Who's Who at my
operations research experience
might have suggested that I am
not a one-discipline researcher.)
The aim of treating and
disseminating knowledge might
have been better served by a
lesearch approach on their part.
But perhaps I am in error. If so,
Professor Ehrlich or Professor
Cavalli-Sforza should be able to
explain in open debate the blocks
on the research path that I have
proposed.
Adequate Test
The geneticity of IQ and the
determination of hybrid variance
are two debate topics that are
adequate to test the conclusion,
based on my research on
methodology to reduce the
environment-heredity uncertainty,
that distinguished Stanford full
professors do indeed encourage
research taboos. Obviously, these
two debate topics treat only a
fraction of the human quality
problems involved. However,
extending the area of debate at
this point of discussion even to
the degree suggested by a list of
references like that cited by

William shockley

Professor Cavalli-Sforza seems to
me like considering all possible
proposals for perpetual motion
machines before reaching an
accord on the first and second
laws of thermodynamics.
Furthermore, a debate on these
two topics can be kept
sufficiently simple without
sacrifice of exactness so that the
non-specialist but logical listener
would be able to evaluate for
himself whether my opponents or
I have the stronger case in the
limited but significant area
involved.
A debate of the sort that I
proposed would contribute to
overcoming the distrust in the
integrity of the American system
on the part of idealistic college
youth. I stressed this
disillusionment with the American
system in my interview with a
Daily reporter as discussed in my
letter of March 1 in these columns
and had the same idea in mind
when I stated at the Academic
Council Meeting on March 3 that
the atmosphere at Stanford
warranted [in the minds of the
students] disruption of classes
taught by me. Indeed, if
disruption of an Academic
Council Meeting is accepted as an
appropriate way of obtaining a
forum, what is inappropriate
about disrupting a Shockley class
examination on quantum physics
of solids? If the chairman of the
Academic Council is prepared to
encourage the members of the
Council to listen to charges that I
am "actively urging and inciting
genocide where there is a clear
and present danger that it will
occur", why does he not offer, in
response to my appeal, to help me
obtain suitable circumstances for
a debate on the logical aspects of
the relevant issues?"
Debate Needed
I believe that a debate
sponsored by Stanford University
— if there is nobody to do so, one
is surely needed - directed to
search for truth on the two
subjects that I have proposed
would furnish a much needed
example of what higher education
is all about — the use of the mind
to determine relative truths. This
important idea was in mind when,
in response to the disruptors*
demands at the Council Meeting,
as reported in the Palo Alto Times
of March 4, I issued the debate
challenge that I have spelled out
in detail in this Opinion Position.
I hope that my three fellow
professors will respond so that
arrangements can be made.

The Largest Recall in Automotive History
The First Amendment of our
constitution gives me the privilege
of challenging to debate
Professors Cavalli -Sforza,
Cronbach, and Ehrlich who have
in these columns attacked my
competence to make suggestions
in their fields of expertise. This
privilege is itself my chief answer
to Professor Brown's denigration
of my faith in the First
Amendment. As for his other
comments, 1 suggest that readers
compare my writings with his
misinterpretations of them. His
position typifies in my opinion
what I have called the "Speer
syndrome."
My faith in the power of
reason and the basic wisdom of
our citizens make me regard the
First Amendment as the "rope"
and our nation's communications
media as the "pulleys" in a system
for exerting a force on the
"rudder of public opinion" so as

to iurn the "ship of civilization"
away from the dysgenic "storm"
that I fear is rising over the
horizon of the future. Through
this column I am attempting to
exert a tug on this rope.
My focus on genetics in
psychology is concentrated on a
narrow, but very significant, and
woefully misrepresented topic —
geneticity of IQ. In this area of his
expertise, I challenge Professor
Crombach to make good in public
debate his assertion (Daily, 23
Feb 72): "If I did not have better
use for my time and if others had
not done the job so well, I would
publish rejoinders to Shockley." I
state the challenge in the form of
a resolution based on the
"more-than-twice" statement of
my KAPPAN article — a
resolution presented and tabled,
as usual, at the 1971 Autumn
Meeting of the National Academy
of Sciences:

"Whereas, estimates of the
level of significance by Academy
member Shockley lead to the
conclusion that, if environmental
influences on IQ variance were as
large as 30%, then there is only
one chance in 2,000 that the
listing by A.R. Jensen of the IQs
for 122 pairs of separately reared,
white identical twins [compiled
from four independent studies
from England, Denmark and the
U.S.A.] would have [fooled us by
pure chance effects so that we
would be erroneously] led to an
observed value of less than 15%
and
"Whereas, the report of the
Davis committee [of the National
Academy of Sciences in keeping
with Professors Crombach,
Cavalli-Sforza, and Ehrlich] does
not assert that in any case genes
dominate the important behavior
trait of IQ; therefore,
"It is resolved that the Council
[of the N.A.S.] be requested to
arrange for a review of the
significance level calculations and
to issue an appropriate statement
to resolve the related
en vironment-heredity
uncertainty."
It is to this "cornerstone"
assertion, that is the subject of my
second round in the
Shockley-Gage Debate in
KAPPAN, that I challenge
Professor Cronbach to make a
rejoinder in keeping with the
academic objective of creating and
disseminating knowledge. I do not
claim more for this assertion than
that it is important to the
foundation of the logical structure
of knowledge about the behavior
genetics of humans. For this
reason I have urged its evaluation
in contributed papers at N.A.S.
meetings and elsewhere for the
last five years. A poll by one of
my student assistants last year
indicated that my "cornerstone"
assertion was vigorously rejected
by the psychology community.
What is wrong with my one
chance in 2,000 estimate of
significance level, Professor
Crombach?
Unsearch Dogmatism
Professors Cavalli-Sforza and
Ehrlich join Professor Cronbach in
what I have diagnosted in
KAPPAN as "unsearch
dogmatism" in rejecting what my
resolution asserts. In addition,
they denigrate my research
suggestions and preliminary
findings in population genetics
research. Professor Ehrlich writes:
"Shockley is simply attempting
unsuccessfully to come to grips
with undergraduate genetics."
Professor Cavalli-Sforza cites
against me a paper of Professor

T.E. Reed of Toronto, the
inventor of the phrase "Caucasian
gene" for Duffy's gene, who
described my estimate of the
variance of the Caucasian ancestry
of the Oakland Negro population
as "an obscure method". It was
far less obscure than the
announcement of Hooke's law in
an anagram by its creator. 1
spelled out explicitly the fact that
assortative mating was involved
and that, like Hooke's Law,
phenotype frequencies were
substantially linear in M (M is the
fraction of Caucasian ancestry)
for Duffy's gene, but that
quadratic terms dominate for the
Gm system. Since presenting my
paper, the research of George R.
Price on "Extension of the
Hardy-Weinberg Law to
assortative mating" [Ann. Hum.
Gen. (1971, 34, 455] has come to
my attention. Price's publication
is a more complete presentation

First Amendment as the "rope"
and our nation's communications
media as the "pulleys" in a system
for exerting a force on the
"rudder of public opinion" so as

to iurn the "ship of civilization"
away from the dysgenic "storm"
that I fear is rising over the
horizon of the future. Through
this column I am attempting to
exert a tug on this rope.
My focus on genetics in
psychology is concentrated on a
narrow, but very significant, and
woefully misrepresented topic —
geneticity of IQ. In this area of his
expertise, I challenge Professor
Crombach to make good in public
debate his assertion (Daily, 23
Feb 72): "If I did not have better
use for my time and if others had
not done the job so well, I would
publish rejoinders to Shockley." I
state the challenge in the form of
a resolution based on the
"more-than-twice" statement of
my KAPPAN article — a
resolution presented and tabled,
as usual, at the 1971 Autumn
Meeting of the National Academy
of Sciences:

"Whereas, estimates of the
level of significance by Academy
member Shockley lead to the
conclusion that, if environmental
influences on IQ variance were as
large as 30%, then there is only
one chance in 2,000 that the
listing by A.R. Jensen of the IQs
for 122 pairs of separately reared,
white identical twins [compiled
from four independent studies
from England, Denmark and the
U.S.A.] would have [fooled us by
pure chance effects so that we
would be erroneously] led to an
observed value of less than 15%
and
"Whereas, the report of the
Davis committee [of the National
Academy of Sciences in keeping
with Professors Crombach,
Cavalli-Sforza, and Ehrlich] does
not assert that in any case genes
dominate the important behavior
trait of IQ; therefore,
"It is resolved that the Council
[of the N.A.S.] be requested to
arrange for a review of the
significance level calculations and
to issue an appropriate statement
to resolve the related
en vironment-heredity
uncertainty."
It is to this "cornerstone"
assertion, that is the subject of my
second round in the
Shockley-Gage Debate in
KAPPAN, that I challenge
Professor Cronbach to make a
rejoinder in keeping with the
academic objective of creating and
disseminating knowledge. I do not
claim more for this assertion than
that it is important to the
foundation of the logical structure
of knowledge about the behavior
genetics of humans. For this
reason I have urged its evaluation
in contributed papers at N.A.S.
meetings and elsewhere for the
last five years. A poll by one of
my student assistants last year
indicated that my "cornerstone"
assertion was vigorously rejected
by the psychology community.
What is wrong with my one
chance in 2,000 estimate of
significance level, Professor
Crombach?
Unsearch Dogmatism
Professors Cavalli-Sforza and
Ehrlich join Professor Cronbach in
what I have diagnosted in
KAPPAN as "unsearch
dogmatism" in rejecting what my
resolution asserts. In addition,
they denigrate my research
suggestions and preliminary
findings in population genetics
research. Professor Ehrlich writes:
"Shockley is simply attempting
unsuccessfully to come to grips
with undergraduate genetics."
Professor Cavalli-Sforza cites
against me a paper of Professor

T.E. Reed of Toronto, the
inventor of the phrase "Caucasian
gene" for Duffy's gene, who
described my estimate of the
variance of the Caucasian ancestry
of the Oakland Negro population
as "an obscure method". It was
far less obscure than the
announcement of Hooke's law in
an anagram by its creator. 1
spelled out explicitly the fact that
assortative mating was involved
and that, like Hooke's Law,
phenotype frequencies were
substantially linear in M (M is the
fraction of Caucasian ancestry)
for Duffy's gene, but that
quadratic terms dominate for the
Gm system. Since presenting my
paper, the research of George R.
Price on "Extension of the
Hardy-Weinberg Law to
assortative mating" [Ann. Hum.
Gen. (1971, 34, 455] has come to
my attention. Price's publication
is a more complete presentation
of his work than mine is of my
theory, but he did not find, as I
did in Reed's data, an actual
application such as my paper
described: "Hardy-Weinberg Law
Generalized to Estimate Hybrid
Variance for Negro Populations
and Reduce Racial Aspects of the
Environment-Heredity
Uncertainty." [Proc. N.A.S.
(1971), 68, 1390 A]
It seems to me that Professors
Ehrlich and Cavalli-Sforza might
have grasped the scientific novelty
of my suggestion had they not
concentrated on attempts to
discredit my analytic capacities (a
look in Who's Who at my
operations research experience
might have suggested that I am
not a one-discipline researcher.)
The aim of treating and
disseminating knowledge might
have been better served by a
lesearch approach on their part.
But perhaps I am in error. If so,
Professor Ehrlich or Professor
Cavalli-Sforza should be able to
explain in open debate the blocks
on the research path that I have
proposed.
Adequate Test
The geneticity of IQ and the
determination of hybrid variance
are two debate topics that are
adequate to test the conclusion,
based on my research on
methodology to reduce the
environment-heredity uncertainty,
that distinguished Stanford full
professors do indeed encourage
research taboos. Obviously, these
two debate topics treat only a
fraction of the human quality
problems involved. However,
extending the area of debate at
this point of discussion even to
the degree suggested by a list of
references like that cited by

William shockley

Professor Cavalli-Sforza seems to
me like considering all possible
proposals for perpetual motion
machines before reaching an
accord on the first and second
laws of thermodynamics.
Furthermore, a debate on these
two topics can be kept
sufficiently simple without
sacrifice of exactness so that the
non-specialist but logical listener
would be able to evaluate for
himself whether my opponents or
I have the stronger case in the
limited but significant area
involved.
A debate of the sort that I
proposed would contribute to
overcoming the distrust in the
integrity of the American system
on the part of idealistic college
youth. I stressed this
disillusionment with the American
system in my interview with a
Daily reporter as discussed in my
letter of March 1 in these columns
and had the same idea in mind
when I stated at the Academic
Council Meeting on March 3 that
the atmosphere at Stanford
warranted [in the minds of the
students] disruption of classes
taught by me. Indeed, if
disruption of an Academic
Council Meeting is accepted as an
appropriate way of obtaining a
forum, what is inappropriate
about disrupting a Shockley class
examination on quantum physics
of solids? If the chairman of the
Academic Council is prepared to
encourage the members of the
Council to listen to charges that I
am "actively urging and inciting
genocide where there is a clear
and present danger that it will
occur", why does he not offer, in
response to my appeal, to help me
obtain suitable circumstances for
a debate on the logical aspects of
the relevant issues?"
Debate Needed
I believe that a debate
sponsored by Stanford University
— if there is nobody to do so, one
is surely needed - directed to
search for truth on the two
subjects that I have proposed
would furnish a much needed
example of what higher education
is all about — the use of the mind
to determine relative truths. This
important idea was in mind when,
in response to the disruptors*
demands at the Council Meeting,
as reported in the Palo Alto Times
of March 4, I issued the debate
challenge that I have spelled out
in detail in this Opinion Position.
I hope that my three fellow
professors will respond so that
arrangements can be made.

The Largest Recall in Automotive History
The First Amendment of our

(1971), 68, 1390 A]
It seems to me that Professors
Ehrlich and Cavalli-Sforza might
have grasped the scientific novelty
of my suggestion had they not
concentrated on attempts to
discredit my analytic capacities (a
look in Who's Who at my
operations research experience
might have suggested that I am
not a one-discipline researcher.)
The aim of treating and
disseminating knowledge might
have been better served by a
lesearch approach on their part.
But perhaps I am in error. If so,
Professor Ehrlich or Professor
Cavalli-Sforza should be able to
explain in open debate the blocks
on the research path that I have
proposed.
Adequate Test
The geneticity of IQ and the
determination of hybrid variance
are two debate topics that are
adequate to test the conclusion,
based on my research on
methodology to reduce the
environment-heredity uncertainty,
that distinguished Stanford full
professors do indeed encourage
research taboos. Obviously, these
two debate topics treat only a
fraction of the human quality
problems involved. However,
extending the area of debate at
this point of discussion even to
the degree suggested by a list of
references like that cited by

William shockley

Professor Cavalli-Sforza seems to
me like considering all possible
proposals for perpetual motion
machines before reaching an
accord on the first and second
laws of thermodynamics.
Furthermore, a debate on these
two topics can be kept
sufficiently simple without
sacrifice of exactness so that the
non-specialist but logical listener
would be able to evaluate for
himself whether my opponents or
I have the stronger case in the
limited but significant area
involved.
A debate of the sort that I
proposed would contribute to
overcoming the distrust in the
integrity of the American system
on the part of idealistic college
youth. I stressed this
disillusionment with the American
system in my interview with a
Daily reporter as discussed in my
letter of March 1 in these columns
and had the same idea in mind
when I stated at the Academic
Council Meeting on March 3 that
the atmosphere at Stanford
warranted [in the minds of the
students] disruption of classes
taught by me. Indeed, if
disruption of an Academic
Council Meeting is accepted as an
appropriate way of obtaining a
forum, what is inappropriate
about disrupting a Shockley class
examination on quantum physics
of solids? If the chairman of the
Academic Council is prepared to
encourage the members of the
Council to listen to charges that I
am "actively urging and inciting
genocide where there is a clear
and present danger that it will
occur", why does he not offer, in
response to my appeal, to help me
obtain suitable circumstances for
a debate on the logical aspects of
the relevant issues?"
Debate Needed
I believe that a debate
sponsored by Stanford University
— if there is nobody to do so, one
is surely needed - directed to
search for truth on the two
subjects that I have proposed
would furnish a much needed
example of what higher education
is all about — the use of the mind
to determine relative truths. This
important idea was in mind when,
in response to the disruptors*
demands at the Council Meeting,
as reported in the Palo Alto Times
of March 4, I issued the debate
challenge that I have spelled out
in detail in this Opinion Position.
I hope that my three fellow
professors will respond so that
arrangements can be made.

The Largest Recall in Automotive History
The First Amendment of our
constitution gives me the privilege
of challenging to debate
Professors Cavalli -Sforza,
Cronbach, and Ehrlich who have
in these columns attacked my
competence to make suggestions
in their fields of expertise. This
privilege is itself my chief answer
to Professor Brown's denigration
of my faith in the First
Amendment. As for his other
comments, 1 suggest that readers
compare my writings with his
misinterpretations of them. His
position typifies in my opinion
what I have called the "Speer
syndrome."
My faith in the power of
reason and the basic wisdom of
our citizens make me regard the
First Amendment as the "rope"
and our nation's communications
media as the "pulleys" in a system
for exerting a force on the
"rudder of public opinion" so as

to iurn the "ship of civilization"
away from the dysgenic "storm"
that I fear is rising over the
horizon of the future. Through
this column I am attempting to
exert a tug on this rope.
My focus on genetics in
psychology is concentrated on a
narrow, but very significant, and
woefully misrepresented topic —
geneticity of IQ. In this area of his
expertise, I challenge Professor
Crombach to make good in public
debate his assertion (Daily, 23
Feb 72): "If I did not have better
use for my time and if others had
not done the job so well, I would
publish rejoinders to Shockley." I
state the challenge in the form of
a resolution based on the
"more-than-twice" statement of
my KAPPAN article — a
resolution presented and tabled,
as usual, at the 1971 Autumn
Meeting of the National Academy
of Sciences:

"Whereas, estimates of the
level of significance by Academy
member Shockley lead to the
conclusion that, if environmental
influences on IQ variance were as
large as 30%, then there is only
one chance in 2,000 that the
listing by A.R. Jensen of the IQs
for 122 pairs of separately reared,
white identical twins [compiled
from four independent studies
from England, Denmark and the
U.S.A.] would have [fooled us by
pure chance effects so that we
would be erroneously] led to an
observed value of less than 15%
and
"Whereas, the report of the
Davis committee [of the National
Academy of Sciences in keeping
with Professors Crombach,
Cavalli-Sforza, and Ehrlich] does
not assert that in any case genes
dominate the important behavior
trait of IQ; therefore,
"It is resolved that the Council
[of the N.A.S.] be requested to
arrange for a review of the
significance level calculations and
to issue an appropriate statement
to resolve the related
en vironment-heredity
uncertainty."
It is to this "cornerstone"
assertion, that is the subject of my
second round in the
Shockley-Gage Debate in
KAPPAN, that I challenge
Professor Cronbach to make a
rejoinder in keeping with the
academic objective of creating and
disseminating knowledge. I do not
claim more for this assertion than
that it is important to the
foundation of the logical structure
of knowledge about the behavior
genetics of humans. For this
reason I have urged its evaluation
in contributed papers at N.A.S.
meetings and elsewhere for the
last five years. A poll by one of
my student assistants last year
indicated that my "cornerstone"
assertion was vigorously rejected
by the psychology community.
What is wrong with my one
chance in 2,000 estimate of
significance level, Professor
Crombach?
Unsearch Dogmatism
Professors Cavalli-Sforza and
Ehrlich join Professor Cronbach in
what I have diagnosted in
KAPPAN as "unsearch
dogmatism" in rejecting what my
resolution asserts. In addition,
they denigrate my research
suggestions and preliminary
findings in population genetics
research. Professor Ehrlich writes:
"Shockley is simply attempting
unsuccessfully to come to grips
with undergraduate genetics."
Professor Cavalli-Sforza cites
against me a paper of Professor

T.E. Reed of Toronto, the
inventor of the phrase "Caucasian
gene" for Duffy's gene, who
described my estimate of the
variance of the Caucasian ancestry
of the Oakland Negro population
as "an obscure method". It was
far less obscure than the
announcement of Hooke's law in
an anagram by its creator. 1
spelled out explicitly the fact that
assortative mating was involved
and that, like Hooke's Law,
phenotype frequencies were
substantially linear in M (M is the
fraction of Caucasian ancestry)
for Duffy's gene, but that
quadratic terms dominate for the
Gm system. Since presenting my
paper, the research of George R.
Price on "Extension of the
Hardy-Weinberg Law to
assortative mating" [Ann. Hum.
Gen. (1971, 34, 455] has come to
my attention. Price's publication
is a more complete presentation
of his work than mine is of my
theory, but he did not find, as I
did in Reed's data, an actual
application such as my paper
described: "Hardy-Weinberg Law
Generalized to Estimate Hybrid
Variance for Negro Populations
and Reduce Racial Aspects of the
Environment-Heredity
Uncertainty." [Proc. N.A.S.
(1971), 68, 1390 A]
It seems to me that Professors
Ehrlich and Cavalli-Sforza might
have grasped the scientific novelty
of my suggestion had they not
concentrated on attempts to
discredit my analytic capacities (a
look in Who's Who at my
operations research experience
might have suggested that I am
