## Shockley Product Of Liberalism 
### 
William Sliockley's racist
program has its roots in earlier
history than Hitler's atrocities. His
beliefs are products of our liberal
heritage. Less obvious but similar
manifestations of this liberal logic
abound about us.
Shockley postulates that the
goal of society is the continula
progress of technology; the
"telephone, the 'pill', bifocals,
and a piece of the moon in our
hand" are testimony to a
heretofore successful culture. By
"using the brain for the welfare of
all creatures" in this way,
Shockley holds, man is fulfilling
either God or evolution's will; his
happiness is thereby insured.
Shockley believes that all means
are legitimate if they are "true" to
this technological end. The result
is a passion for progress that
precludes empathy for the human
being; life increasingly becomes a
mathmatical formula, while
people are dealt with only as
elements of its objective structure.
Facist implications are
apparent. Those not capable
(genetically, he maintains) of
adding to the progress of society
are hindrances to it; they should
be eliminated. The
dehumanization of people that
results from their objectification
makes such extermination easy.
Those deleterious to "our future"
are like other parts of our
environment that we so freely
manipulate and discard.
The deceptive genetic

arguments Shockley develops for
specifying those people incapable
of fulfilling man's destiny have
been dealt with by qualified
geneticists. What is necessary,
here, is to understand that his
ideas and their logic are not
isolated products of one man's
warped mind. They are themes
common to our everyday lives, if
only less apparent, and their
results adversely affect more than
a minority of us all.
Most dramatically, billions of
tons of bomb shrapnel in S.E.
Asia testify to a similar
consciousness; the
historically-inevitable American
destiny has justified mass murder.
Millions of "uneducated" bodies
("Gooks") incidental to our
technological mission lie buried;
as corpses they are evidence of
how some human beings, less
"civilized", are less "important"
than others; they seem less
human, somehow, because they
are so quiet, undemonstrative,
unaggressive on their small rice
plots. They can be, somehow,
discarded, as we dislodge and
discard parts of a mountain
standing in the path of a proposed
highway, because they can only
slow our realization of
"evolution's technological will."
We are naive, however, if we
believe that this technocratic
mentality is reserved for our Asian
relations only. It has, like a slow
cancer, pervaded our own social,
psychological lives as well.
Tragically, however, we have,
in our haste, overlooked an
important part of life. We are
forgetting the art of feeling,
enjoying, and communicating as

we press forever onward. To one
another we become, like the rest
of our enviornment, manipulablc
quantum.
Kitty Genovese was repeatedly
attacked and assaulted on a
well-lit New York City street
several years ago while hundreds
of people passively watched from
their comfortable apartment
windows. The observers were
saying to this victimized women,
in their silence: "The desire to
order our lives more efficiently
and productively precludes
allowing us to concern ourselves
with you or other people. We
don't have time to empathize or
we'll be left behind. History
moves quickly and will, without
reflection, bury your insignificant
body beneath splendored
industrial products."
During WW II a journalist
wrote: "There is a dream which
keeps coming back to me at
almost regular intervals; it is dark,
and I am being murdered in some
kind of thicket or brushwood;
there is a busy road at no more
than ten yards distance; I scream
for help but nobody hears me, the
crowd walks part, laughing and
chattering. . . . Now and then we
succeed in reaching your ear for a
minute. I know it happens by a
certain dumb wonder in your
faces, a faint glassy stare entering
your eye; and I tell myself: now
you have got them, now hold
them, so that they will remain
awake. But it only lasts a minute.
You shake yourself like puppies
who have got their fur wet; than
the transparent screen descends
again, and you walk on, protected
by the dream barrier which stifles
all sound." Arthur Koestler, one
of those who tried in vain to
awaken the British and American
people to the horrors of Hitlerism

in Germany, wrote this testimony
in 1944.
Shockley believes that his
sterilization program will insure
greater happiness for millions who
will otherwise be born into
poverty; for happiness to
Shockley is telephones and pieces
of the moon.
If we believe that the destiny
of man lies in a Utopian
technological society, where an
elite few reap its synthetic
rewards, than we should march
with Shockley in advocating
sterilization or genocide.
If we believe otherwise, then
lets act accordingly.
Let's not, however, point our
fingers only at Shockley, DoD
contractors, Lt. Calleys, or like
apartment dwellers, the
unfortunates who only reflect, in
its extreme, the soul of our
society. Let's look at our own
lives and decide what is important
for our collective futures.
Technology or life. It needn't be
so "either/or", but with each day
it becomes increasingly just so.
Technology can be valuable if it is
used for human purposes and not
as an end in itself.
Before we "off" Shockley, let's
look at ourselves; how close are
we all to steriliztion in its
broadest sense. To eliminate a
"geneticist" isn't enought to
eliminate genocide.

If we believe that the destiny
of man lies in a Utopian

If we believe otherwise, then

Let's not, however, point our

for our collective futures.
Technology or life. It needn't be
so "either/or", but with each day
it becomes increasingly just so.
Technology can be valuable if it is
used for human purposes and not
as an end in itself.
Before we "off" Shockley, let's
look at ourselves; how close are
we all to steriliztion in its
broadest sense. To eliminate a
"geneticist" isn't enought to
eliminate genocide.
(Mark Beck is a senior in Political
Science)
William Sliockley's racist
program has its roots in earlier
history than Hitler's atrocities. His
beliefs are products of our liberal
heritage. Less obvious but similar
manifestations of this liberal logic
abound about us.
Shockley postulates that the
goal of society is the continula
progress of technology; the
"telephone, the 'pill', bifocals,
and a piece of the moon in our
hand" are testimony to a
heretofore successful culture. By
"using the brain for the welfare of
all creatures" in this way,
Shockley holds, man is fulfilling
either God or evolution's will; his
happiness is thereby insured.
Shockley believes that all means
are legitimate if they are "true" to
this technological end. The result
is a passion for progress that
precludes empathy for the human
being; life increasingly becomes a
mathmatical formula, while
people are dealt with only as
elements of its objective structure.
Facist implications are
apparent. Those not capable
(genetically, he maintains) of
adding to the progress of society
are hindrances to it; they should
be eliminated. The
dehumanization of people that
results from their objectification
makes such extermination easy.
Those deleterious to "our future"
are like other parts of our
environment that we so freely
manipulate and discard.
The deceptive genetic

arguments Shockley develops for
specifying those people incapable
of fulfilling man's destiny have
been dealt with by qualified
geneticists. What is necessary,
here, is to understand that his
ideas and their logic are not
isolated products of one man's
warped mind. They are themes
common to our everyday lives, if
only less apparent, and their
results adversely affect more than
a minority of us all.
Most dramatically, billions of
tons of bomb shrapnel in S.E.
Asia testify to a similar
consciousness; the
historically-inevitable American
destiny has justified mass murder.
Millions of "uneducated" bodies
("Gooks") incidental to our
technological mission lie buried;
as corpses they are evidence of
how some human beings, less
"civilized", are less "important"
than others; they seem less
human, somehow, because they
are so quiet, undemonstrative,
unaggressive on their small rice
plots. They can be, somehow,
discarded, as we dislodge and
discard parts of a mountain
standing in the path of a proposed
highway, because they can only

with Shockley in advocating
sterilization or genocide.
If we believe otherwise, then
lets act accordingly.
Let's not, however, point our
fingers only at Shockley, DoD
contractors, Lt. Calleys, or like
apartment dwellers, the
unfortunates who only reflect, in
its extreme, the soul of our
society. Let's look at our own
lives and decide what is important
for our collective futures.
Technology or life. It needn't be
so "either/or", but with each day
it becomes increasingly just so.
Technology can be valuable if it is
used for human purposes and not
as an end in itself.
Before we "off" Shockley, let's
look at ourselves; how close are
we all to steriliztion in its
broadest sense. To eliminate a
"geneticist" isn't enought to
eliminate genocide.
(Mark Beck is a senior in Political
Science)
William Sliockley's racist
program has its roots in earlier
history than Hitler's atrocities. His
beliefs are products of our liberal
heritage. Less obvious but similar
manifestations of this liberal logic
abound about us.
Shockley postulates that the
goal of society is the continula
progress of technology; the
"telephone, the 'pill', bifocals,
and a piece of the moon in our
hand" are testimony to a
heretofore successful culture. By
"using the brain for the welfare of
all creatures" in this way,
Shockley holds, man is fulfilling
either God or evolution's will; his
happiness is thereby insured.
Shockley believes that all means
are legitimate if they are "true" to
this technological end. The result
is a passion for progress that
precludes empathy for the human
being; life increasingly becomes a
mathmatical formula, while
people are dealt with only as
elements of its objective structure.
Facist implications are
apparent. Those not capable
(genetically, he maintains) of
adding to the progress of society
are hindrances to it; they should
be eliminated. The
dehumanization of people that
results from their objectification
makes such extermination easy.
Those deleterious to "our future"
are like other parts of our
environment that we so freely
manipulate and discard.
The deceptive genetic

arguments Shockley develops for
specifying those people incapable
of fulfilling man's destiny have
been dealt with by qualified
geneticists. What is necessary,
here, is to understand that his
ideas and their logic are not
isolated products of one man's
warped mind. They are themes
common to our everyday lives, if
only less apparent, and their
results adversely affect more than
a minority of us all.
Most dramatically, billions of
tons of bomb shrapnel in S.E.
Asia testify to a similar
consciousness; the
historically-inevitable American
destiny has justified mass murder.
Millions of "uneducated" bodies
("Gooks") incidental to our
technological mission lie buried;
as corpses they are evidence of
how some human beings, less
"civilized", are less "important"
than others; they seem less
human, somehow, because they
are so quiet, undemonstrative,
unaggressive on their small rice
plots. They can be, somehow,
discarded, as we dislodge and
discard parts of a mountain
standing in the path of a proposed
highway, because they can only
slow our realization of
"evolution's technological will."
We are naive, however, if we
believe that this technocratic
mentality is reserved for our Asian
relations only. It has, like a slow
cancer, pervaded our own social,
psychological lives as well.
Tragically, however, we have,
in our haste, overlooked an
important part of life. We are
forgetting the art of feeling,
enjoying, and communicating as

we press forever onward. To one
another we become, like the rest
of our enviornment, manipulablc
quantum.
Kitty Genovese was repeatedly
attacked and assaulted on a
well-lit New York City street
several years ago while hundreds
of people passively watched from
their comfortable apartment
windows. The observers were
saying to this victimized women,
in their silence: "The desire to
order our lives more efficiently
and productively precludes
allowing us to concern ourselves
with you or other people. We
don't have time to empathize or
we'll be left behind. History
moves quickly and will, without
reflection, bury your insignificant
body beneath splendored
industrial products."
During WW II a journalist
wrote: "There is a dream which
keeps coming back to me at
almost regular intervals; it is dark,
and I am being murdered in some
kind of thicket or brushwood;
there is a busy road at no more
than ten yards distance; I scream
for help but nobody hears me, the
crowd walks part, laughing and
chattering. . . . Now and then we
succeed in reaching your ear for a
minute. I know it happens by a
certain dumb wonder in your
faces, a faint glassy stare entering
your eye; and I tell myself: now
you have got them, now hold
them, so that they will remain
awake. But it only lasts a minute.
You shake yourself like puppies
who have got their fur wet; than
the transparent screen descends
again, and you walk on, protected
by the dream barrier which stifles
all sound." Arthur Koestler, one
of those who tried in vain to
awaken the British and American
people to the horrors of Hitlerism

in Germany, wrote this testimony
in 1944.
Shockley believes that his
sterilization program will insure
greater happiness for millions who

poverty; for happiness to
Shockley is telephones and pieces
of the moon.
If we believe that the destiny
of man lies in a Utopian
technological society, where an
elite few reap its synthetic
rewards, than we should march
