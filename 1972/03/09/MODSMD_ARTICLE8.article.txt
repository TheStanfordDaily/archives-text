## Non-Violent Studies 
### 
In the last few months there
has been much discussion
concerning Non-Violence. We
have heard Richard Lyman
declare that contrary to common
belief, Non-Violence is coercive
and is to be looked at in this vein.
Students have asked, "is stopping
the university's complicity with
the war through demonstrations,
sit-ins, fasts, etc. really
Non-Violence?" We have seen
members of the community
applaud bold decisive ethnical
actions called Non-Violence, and
the baking of bread as
Non-Violent. These ideas and
expressions of thought on
non-violence go on and on.

Fortunately there are two courses
in Non-Violence in the Struggle
for Liberation presently being
offered through the Social
Thought department. The courses
are divided up into two sections
so the class can conduct itself in a
personnal manner. We try to
enhance exchange of views, have
in depth probing of a little
understood perception of reality,
and to experiment with
non-violence in the seminar itself.
The courses are SSCI 168 c or
SSCI 169 c. 168 c is an
introduction to some of the major
notions of non-violence, some of
the people who have acted in a
struggle for liberation with

non-violence, critics of what some
people may call non-violence, and
projects in non-violence. The
major interest of this seminar is to
reveal the participants
presuppositions of non-violence.
These previous thoughts on
non-violence are usually vague
thoughts, deep expectations that
consider non-violence to simply
be a negation of violence. What
we begin to see in the seminar is
that non-violence is a perception
of reality based on the
understanding of many of the
processes that make up life. What
is commonly termed non-violence
is usually some short term tactic
or sense of general morality rather
than a perception of the depths of
the social, political, economic,
and personnal considerations of
Satyagraha (life force as used by
Gandhi). Non-violence is a
positive creative perception of

reality, not a negation of
something else.
169 c is a second year seminar
studying in-depth cases where
non-violence is said to have been
the perception of life that those
working people held. We
continually try to see the
theoretical dimensions of the case
as compared and intermingled
with the practice of the campaign.
We have studied SNCC and the
United Farm Worker's Organizing
Committee, and will contiuue
with Dolci in Italy, and Gandhi in
South Africa. A comparison of
these campaigns will help to get
some sense of the common factors
present in the work and lives of
the people as well as seeing and
trying to understand the
differences.
If you have an interest in
Non-Violence and wish to share
time with people actually
interested in this area as thought
and action, feel free to come.
