## Crime & Punishment 
### 
Capital Punishment
With the recent California
Supreme Court decision and
various public statements by
Stanford Law School professor
Anthony Amsterdam and several
politicians, the subject of the
death penalty is at present a
matter of general discussion. Such
a state of affairs provides a chance
to bring one's principles to bear
on the question of capital
punishment and on punishment in
general.
Sensible commentators on
these issues seem to fall roughly
into two camps:
On one side are opponents of
the death penalty, who usually
adhere to a utilitarian
deterrence-rehabilitation theory
of punishment. They emphasize
making it costly to disobey any
rules made by the government and
then after a rule is breached,
restoring the rule-breaker,
hopefully now reformed, to full
participation in society.
On the other side are
proponents of the death penalty,
who often adhere to a
restitution-retribution theory of
punishment. They rightly
emphasize repair of the injury
which the criminal has inflicted
upon his victim and application of
a punishment which befits the
crime committed.
Those who see proper
punishment as providing
restitution and retribution
consider the criminal to have
violated the victim's natural
rights. Punishment should then
restore balance to the scales of
justice.
The epithet "barbaric" is often
hurled at proponents of
retributive punishment, but such
name-calling proves no arguments.
In fact, as Harry Elmer Barnes and
Negley K. Teeters once wrote, "It
is perhaps worth noting, that our
barbarian ancestors were wiser
and more just than we are today,
for they adopted the theory of
restitution to the injured, whereas
we have abandoned this practice,
to the detriment of all
concerned."
In summary form, conceiving
justice in terms of natural rights
leads to a theory of punishment as
restitution and retribution. First,
the victim must be paid back
materially by the criminal;
secondly, the victim must be
provided psychic recompense for
the "degradation, physical
suffering, and grief" he has
endured; and thirdly, this psychic
recompense is to come from a
retributive punishment (which
comes in addition to material
restitution) that objectively
matches the crime committed by
the criminal. Such punishment
will restore the balance upset by
the material and non-material
damage done by the criminal. Of
course, a victim has a right to
forgive, in whole or in part, those
who have trespassed against him.
For the crime of willful
murder, the punishment which
fits the crime is death. As James J.
Kilpatrick says in his column
published in the February 26 Palo
Alto Times, "Punishment ought
not to be imposed because it is
therapeutic, but because it is
just.... The execution of a
cold-blooded killer, found guilty
after a fair trial, is not an act of
social depravity; it becomes an act
of elementary justice."
In his book Compensation and
Restitution to Victims of Crime,
Stephen Schafer writes:

"Punishment satisfies our feelings
of revenge against those who
attack us . . . The evil visited on
the wrong-doer in punishment is
intended not only to make the
power of moral and legal order
felt by the criminal, but at the
same time, to endeavor to
compensate the victim for his
encroached or destroyed right by
offering him some spiritual
satisfaction . . . This task of
punishment was prominent in the
golden age of classic criminal law,
when criminal justice throughout
the world adjusted the
punishment roughly to the quality
and quantity of the victim's
injury."
The concepts of retaliation and
vengeance have not had a good
press in recent times, but Aristotle
is correct when he says, "Revenge
is just." Is it not appropriate and
reasonable for an Indochinese
farmer who sees the rain of death
brought by the U.S. Air Force to
desire to get back at those
responsible?
Murray N. Rothbard asks in a
similar vein, "If a man's infant
daughter is cruelly butchered,
why should he not desire the
butchery of the criminal in return,
and should he not have this desire
executed?"
The opponents of capital
punishment are often, in Sidney
Hook's phrase, "dripping with
treacly humanitarianism," but
their view of a humane society is
simply a mistaken one. As Donald
Atwell Zoll recently wrote: "A
humane society is a
compassionate society, but
compassion is only significant in
terms of justice, of a sensitivity to
the valid claims of men which rest
upon the restraints on usurpation,
aggression, and terror."
Soviet Mental Hospitals
Radical journalist I.F. Stone
shed light on the practice of
incarcerating radical political
dissidents in the Soviet Union in
mental hospitals in two recent
articles, one in the February 10
New York Review of Books, the

bill evers

other in the February 15 New
York Times.
Stone's articles contain
fascinating anecdotes on the
involuntary mental hospitalization
of persons diagnosed as having
"obsessive reformist delusions."
But more importantly, Stone
focuses attention on a
whitewashing H.E.W. report on
Soviet psychiatric practices which
is constantly utilized by Soviet
authorities as evidence that
mental hospitals are being used
properly in the Soviet Union. This
report was written by Judge David
L. Bazelon of the U.S. Court of
Appeals and six major American
mental health experts after a 1967
visit to the Soviet Union. (Judge
Bazelon is famous for his decision
in the 1954 case of Durham v.
United States in which he adopted
a psychiatric model of "insanity,"
and rejected the more sensible
McNaughten rule that those who
can distinguish right from wrong
should be held responsible for
their acts.)
Stone asks that Judge Bazelon
examine the case of Vladimir
Bukovsky and consider modifying
his statements in the H.E.W.
report in light of the Bukovsky
case, for which full
documentation is available.
On September 16, 1971, the
London Times published a letter
by 44 British psychiatrists in
which they declared themselves,
after examining the Bukovsky
documents, "impelled to express
gave doubts about the legitimacy
of compulsory treatment for the
six people concerned, and
indefinite confinement in prison
mental hospital conditions."
The 44 psychiatrists concluded
that the diagnosis of the six
(including Bukovsky) seemed to
have been "made purely in
consequence of actions in which
they were exercising fundamental
freedomsâ€”as set out in the
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and guaranteed by the
Soviet Constitution."

L. Bazelon of the U.S. Court of
Appeals and six major American
mental health experts after a 1967
visit to the Soviet Union. (Judge
Bazelon is famous for his decision
in the 1954 case of Durham v.
United States in which he adopted
a psychiatric model of "insanity,"
and rejected the more sensible
McNaughten rule that those who
can distinguish right from wrong
should be held responsible for
their acts.)
Stone asks that Judge Bazelon
examine the case of Vladimir
Bukovsky and consider modifying
his statements in the H.E.W.
report in light of the Bukovsky
case, for which full
documentation is available.
On September 16, 1971, the
London Times published a letter
by 44 British psychiatrists in
which they declared themselves,
after examining the Bukovsky
documents, "impelled to express
gave doubts about the legitimacy
of compulsory treatment for the
six people concerned, and
indefinite confinement in prison
mental hospital conditions."
The 44 psychiatrists concluded
that the diagnosis of the six
(including Bukovsky) seemed to
have been "made purely in
consequence of actions in which
they were exercising fundamental
freedomsâ€”as set out in the
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and guaranteed by the
Soviet Constitution."

Capital Punishment
With the recent California
Supreme Court decision and
various public statements by
Stanford Law School professor
Anthony Amsterdam and several
politicians, the subject of the
death penalty is at present a
matter of general discussion. Such
a state of affairs provides a chance
to bring one's principles to bear
on the question of capital
punishment and on punishment in
general.
Sensible commentators on
these issues seem to fall roughly
into two camps:
On one side are opponents of
the death penalty, who usually
adhere to a utilitarian
deterrence-rehabilitation theory
of punishment. They emphasize
making it costly to disobey any
rules made by the government and
then after a rule is breached,
restoring the rule-breaker,
hopefully now reformed, to full
participation in society.
On the other side are
proponents of the death penalty,
who often adhere to a
restitution-retribution theory of
punishment. They rightly
emphasize repair of the injury
which the criminal has inflicted
upon his victim and application of
a punishment which befits the
crime committed.
Those who see proper
punishment as providing
restitution and retribution
consider the criminal to have
violated the victim's natural
rights. Punishment should then
restore balance to the scales of
justice.
The epithet "barbaric" is often
hurled at proponents of
retributive punishment, but such
name-calling proves no arguments.
In fact, as Harry Elmer Barnes and
Negley K. Teeters once wrote, "It
is perhaps worth noting, that our
barbarian ancestors were wiser
and more just than we are today,
for they adopted the theory of
restitution to the injured, whereas
we have abandoned this practice,
to the detriment of all
concerned."
In summary form, conceiving
justice in terms of natural rights
leads to a theory of punishment as
restitution and retribution. First,
the victim must be paid back
materially by the criminal;
secondly, the victim must be
provided psychic recompense for
the "degradation, physical
suffering, and grief" he has
endured; and thirdly, this psychic
recompense is to come from a
retributive punishment (which
comes in addition to material
restitution) that objectively
matches the crime committed by
the criminal. Such punishment
will restore the balance upset by
the material and non-material
damage done by the criminal. Of
course, a victim has a right to
forgive, in whole or in part, those
who have trespassed against him.
For the crime of willful
murder, the punishment which
fits the crime is death. As James J.
Kilpatrick says in his column
published in the February 26 Palo
Alto Times, "Punishment ought
not to be imposed because it is
therapeutic, but because it is
just.... The execution of a
cold-blooded killer, found guilty
after a fair trial, is not an act of
social depravity; it becomes an act
of elementary justice."
In his book Compensation and
Restitution to Victims of Crime,
Stephen Schafer writes:

"Punishment satisfies our feelings
of revenge against those who
attack us . . . The evil visited on
the wrong-doer in punishment is
intended not only to make the
power of moral and legal order
felt by the criminal, but at the
same time, to endeavor to
compensate the victim for his
encroached or destroyed right by
offering him some spiritual
satisfaction . . . This task of
punishment was prominent in the
golden age of classic criminal law,
when criminal justice throughout
the world adjusted the
punishment roughly to the quality
and quantity of the victim's
injury."
The concepts of retaliation and
vengeance have not had a good
press in recent times, but Aristotle
is correct when he says, "Revenge
is just." Is it not appropriate and
reasonable for an Indochinese
farmer who sees the rain of death
brought by the U.S. Air Force to
desire to get back at those
responsible?
Murray N. Rothbard asks in a
similar vein, "If a man's infant
daughter is cruelly butchered,
why should he not desire the
butchery of the criminal in return,
and should he not have this desire
executed?"
The opponents of capital
punishment are often, in Sidney
Hook's phrase, "dripping with
treacly humanitarianism," but
their view of a humane society is
simply a mistaken one. As Donald
Atwell Zoll recently wrote: "A
humane society is a
compassionate society, but
compassion is only significant in
terms of justice, of a sensitivity to
the valid claims of men which rest
upon the restraints on usurpation,
aggression, and terror."
Soviet Mental Hospitals
Radical journalist I.F. Stone
shed light on the practice of
incarcerating radical political
dissidents in the Soviet Union in
mental hospitals in two recent
articles, one in the February 10
New York Review of Books, the

bill evers

other in the February 15 New
York Times.
Stone's articles contain
fascinating anecdotes on the
involuntary mental hospitalization
of persons diagnosed as having
"obsessive reformist delusions."
But more importantly, Stone
focuses attention on a
whitewashing H.E.W. report on
Soviet psychiatric practices which
is constantly utilized by Soviet
authorities as evidence that
mental hospitals are being used
properly in the Soviet Union. This

L. Bazelon of the U.S. Court of

similar vein, "If a man's infant
daughter is cruelly butchered,
why should he not desire the
butchery of the criminal in return,
and should he not have this desire
executed?"
The opponents of capital
punishment are often, in Sidney
Hook's phrase, "dripping with
treacly humanitarianism," but
their view of a humane society is
simply a mistaken one. As Donald
Atwell Zoll recently wrote: "A
humane society is a
compassionate society, but
compassion is only significant in
terms of justice, of a sensitivity to
the valid claims of men which rest
upon the restraints on usurpation,
aggression, and terror."
Soviet Mental Hospitals
Radical journalist I.F. Stone
shed light on the practice of
incarcerating radical political
dissidents in the Soviet Union in
mental hospitals in two recent
articles, one in the February 10
New York Review of Books, the

bill evers

other in the February 15 New
York Times.
Stone's articles contain
fascinating anecdotes on the
involuntary mental hospitalization
of persons diagnosed as having
"obsessive reformist delusions."
But more importantly, Stone
focuses attention on a
whitewashing H.E.W. report on
Soviet psychiatric practices which
is constantly utilized by Soviet
authorities as evidence that
mental hospitals are being used
properly in the Soviet Union. This
report was written by Judge David
L. Bazelon of the U.S. Court of
Appeals and six major American
mental health experts after a 1967
visit to the Soviet Union. (Judge
Bazelon is famous for his decision
in the 1954 case of Durham v.
United States in which he adopted
a psychiatric model of "insanity,"
and rejected the more sensible
McNaughten rule that those who
can distinguish right from wrong
should be held responsible for
their acts.)
Stone asks that Judge Bazelon
examine the case of Vladimir
Bukovsky and consider modifying
his statements in the H.E.W.
report in light of the Bukovsky
case, for which full
documentation is available.
On September 16, 1971, the
London Times published a letter
by 44 British psychiatrists in
which they declared themselves,
after examining the Bukovsky
documents, "impelled to express
gave doubts about the legitimacy
of compulsory treatment for the
six people concerned, and
indefinite confinement in prison
mental hospital conditions."
The 44 psychiatrists concluded
that the diagnosis of the six
(including Bukovsky) seemed to
have been "made purely in
consequence of actions in which
they were exercising fundamental
freedomsâ€”as set out in the
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and guaranteed by the
Soviet Constitution."

Capital Punishment
With the recent California
Supreme Court decision and
various public statements by
Stanford Law School professor
Anthony Amsterdam and several
politicians, the subject of the
death penalty is at present a
matter of general discussion. Such
a state of affairs provides a chance
to bring one's principles to bear
on the question of capital
punishment and on punishment in
general.
Sensible commentators on
these issues seem to fall roughly
into two camps:
On one side are opponents of
the death penalty, who usually
adhere to a utilitarian
deterrence-rehabilitation theory
of punishment. They emphasize
making it costly to disobey any
rules made by the government and
then after a rule is breached,
restoring the rule-breaker,
hopefully now reformed, to full
participation in society.
On the other side are
proponents of the death penalty,
who often adhere to a
restitution-retribution theory of
punishment. They rightly
emphasize repair of the injury
which the criminal has inflicted
upon his victim and application of
a punishment which befits the
crime committed.
Those who see proper
punishment as providing
restitution and retribution
consider the criminal to have
violated the victim's natural
rights. Punishment should then
restore balance to the scales of
justice.
The epithet "barbaric" is often
hurled at proponents of
retributive punishment, but such
name-calling proves no arguments.
In fact, as Harry Elmer Barnes and
Negley K. Teeters once wrote, "It
is perhaps worth noting, that our
barbarian ancestors were wiser
and more just than we are today,
for they adopted the theory of
restitution to the injured, whereas
we have abandoned this practice,
to the detriment of all
concerned."
In summary form, conceiving
justice in terms of natural rights
leads to a theory of punishment as
restitution and retribution. First,
the victim must be paid back
materially by the criminal;
secondly, the victim must be
provided psychic recompense for
the "degradation, physical
suffering, and grief" he has
endured; and thirdly, this psychic
recompense is to come from a
retributive punishment (which
comes in addition to material
restitution) that objectively
matches the crime committed by
the criminal. Such punishment
will restore the balance upset by
the material and non-material
damage done by the criminal. Of
course, a victim has a right to
forgive, in whole or in part, those
who have trespassed against him.
For the crime of willful
murder, the punishment which
fits the crime is death. As James J.
Kilpatrick says in his column
published in the February 26 Palo
Alto Times, "Punishment ought
not to be imposed because it is
therapeutic, but because it is
just.... The execution of a
cold-blooded killer, found guilty
after a fair trial, is not an act of
social depravity; it becomes an act
of elementary justice."
In his book Compensation and
Restitution to Victims of Crime,
Stephen Schafer writes:

"Punishment satisfies our feelings
of revenge against those who
attack us . . . The evil visited on
the wrong-doer in punishment is
intended not only to make the
power of moral and legal order
felt by the criminal, but at the
same time, to endeavor to
compensate the victim for his
encroached or destroyed right by
offering him some spiritual
satisfaction . . . This task of
punishment was prominent in the
golden age of classic criminal law,
when criminal justice throughout
the world adjusted the
punishment roughly to the quality
and quantity of the victim's
injury."
The concepts of retaliation and
vengeance have not had a good
press in recent times, but Aristotle
is correct when he says, "Revenge
is just." Is it not appropriate and
reasonable for an Indochinese
farmer who sees the rain of death
brought by the U.S. Air Force to
desire to get back at those
responsible?
Murray N. Rothbard asks in a
similar vein, "If a man's infant
daughter is cruelly butchered,
why should he not desire the
butchery of the criminal in return,
and should he not have this desire
