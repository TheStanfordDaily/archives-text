# Placement Disruption
## Four Students Suspended 
### JIM WASCHER 
Four students, the so-called "Place
ment Center 4," have been suspended
for three academic quarters for inter
fering with a TRW Corporation inter
view at the Placement Center last
November.
Acting in President Richard Ly
man's absence, Provost William Miller
concurred with an earlier recommen
dation of the Campus Judicial Panel
that the four be suspended. Lyman
left Stanford for a trip to the East
Coast during spring break, leaving
Miller as acting president.
The CJP had unanimously accepted
hearing officer Lillian Altree's recom
mendation of a guilty verdict in the
case, and had recommended that the
President suspend the four for three
quarters "beginning with the spring
quarter and including the summer and
fall quarters of 1972."
Finals Week Decision
The four were charged with viola
tion of the Campus Disruption Policy
because they interfered with a TRW
Corporation interview at the Place
ment Center last November. The CJP,
chaired by Law Professor John Kap
lan, released its 20-page opinion early
in Winter Quarter finals week.
The defendants are senior Don Lee
and sophomore Steve Downey, both
of Venceremos and sophomores Pete

Knutson and Paul Loeb of the Young
Crows.
Lee, who completed the number of
units necessary for graduation Winter
Quarter, cannot receive his diploma
until Winter, 1973 because of the
decision. Article II(C)2c of the Stu
dent Conduct Penalty Code states that
"no student who has been suspended
in a future quarter shall be eligible to
receive a University degree until the
period of suspension has terminated."
Explaining its decision, the CJP
wrote: "they [the defendants] decid
ed that they had the right to prevent
other students from doing what those
students felt was right. Moreover, in
this case, all the student was doing was
trying to find things out (about TRW's
connection with the Vietnam War) for
himself. In a University, which values
free expression and access to informa
tion, actions aimed at preventing this
are especially intolerable."
Future Misconduct
The Panel also said "it is fairly clear
that the defendants remain convinced
that they have acted properly. Indeed,
rather than express remorse for their
activities, they are quite proud of
them. The significance of this is that
our rules enjoin us, in imposing
sanctions, to weigh the 'likelihood or
lack thereof of similar misconduct by
the student in the future."

The purposes of the sanction, the
CJP said, were to "express the reproof
that the community feels is merited"
and "to deter such conduct in the
future."
The Panel rejected the defendants'
contention that the interview they
interrupted was not an "authorized
University function" as specified by
the Policy and Campus Disruption,
and said that interviews were specifi
cally mentioned in the Policy.
Also rejected by the CJP was the
defense argument that the April 19,
1971 student referendum "to prohibit
the use of Stanford lands by corpora
tions that are directly producing
material and research for the military"
helped establish the defendants' case
against war-related recruiting being
held as "authorized functions."
The Panel said that "the referendum
does not, in and of itself, purport to
exercise any power to change the state
of affairs" with regard to Placement
Center policy. Also cited was the
Committee on Student Services'
5-4 vote against the prohibition.
Students hold a majority on COSS.
The Panel also said "bad as the
Vietnam War may be, the defendants
did very little to stop it in this case,
and the wrong of denying an indi
vidual student's rights in our com
munity, is compounded by the
inescapable challenge which that
denial constitutes." The CJP also
rejected the defendants' introduction
of international law into their "plea in
mitigation of sentence."
In two landmark decisions for
future defendants, the Panel said that
"the modern trend has been to allow a
general defense, and we agree with
defendants that justification, if it
exists, is an appropriate defense before
the CJP. Moreover, we agree with the'
defense that 'under some circum
stances action that would normally
come under the disruption policy is
simply not a violation of that policy."
Also decided by the CJP was that
"should justification defenses be
raised, there must be either a conces
sion by the prosecution or testimony
on the defendants' state of mind
which the prosecution can cross
examine before we can consider a
justification defense."
