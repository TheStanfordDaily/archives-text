# CJP Decision In Two Forgery Cases

Space paid for by University Relations

In Re R:
Defendant was charged with two counts of assault
and one count of forgery of a registration-day hold card.
The hearing officer acquitted him on one assault
charge and though he found that the second assault did
occur, he recommended that it not be considered a
violation of the Fundamental Standard on the ground
that it was too minor and resulted from an accident and
poor judgment rather than from maliciousness. Finally,
the defendant admitted, and was found guilty of the
forgery.
We concur with the recommendation of the hearing
officer on the charge of assault. Tiie recommendations
of the hearing officer are not conclusive upon our deter
minations, but in this case we agree.
With respect to the forgery, the question presented to
us is what sanction should be imposed.
One factor relevant to our consideration is the signifi
cance that the community should attach to this offense.
Forgery destroys the credibility of documents and, if
permitted on a widespread scale, could seriously impair
the utility of many processes in a social system such as
the university.
Moreover, forgery is taken seriously in the outside
community; it is a felony in civil courts. It has the same
deleterious effects in a university and should be similarly
regarded. Finally, forgery is a written lie and a university
whose major values include truth and integrity must
regard any lie as a serious offense.
The second factor to be considered is the appropriate
ness for the defendant of a particular sanction. Since
innumerable elements, varying with each defendant,
affect this consideration, it is impossible to devise a
policy that can be consistently applied. The circum
stances of each case and the cffects of various sanctions
upon the individual defendants must all be evaluated.
The defendant has no previous record of any univer
sity discipline. He understands the wrongfulness of his
conduct and has no intention of repeating this type of
offense. He did not perform the forgery for personal
gain.
The hold card was an attempt to enforce a bill owed
to the university and we are satisfied that the defendant
did not intend to evade this debt permanently. Finally,
the defendant has an extremely low draft number and
any suspension for more than one quarter would have an

effect upon his life out of proportion to the gravity of
his offense.
Accordingly, we find in this case that suspension for
Spring Quarter is an appropriate sanction.
We have considered suspension for the remainder of
this (Winter) Quarter, but have rejected this as too
harsh: it constitutes, in essence, a fine in excess of
$1,000.00 and it may deprive the student of the results
of considerable academic effort.
We mention the foregoing for two purposes: (1) to
distinguish between two sanctions that on their face
might seem very similar and thus to communicate more
accurately the significance attached to the offense of
forgery; and, (2) to distinguish between these two sanc
tions so that the relative significance of other offenses
can be communicated.
The Panel recommends that the defendant be sus
pended for Spring Quarter.

In Re: B
There is no real factual dispute concerning this case.
Mr. B was charged with the forgery of registration mate
rials, and admits it. It appears that his dominant motive
was to obtain a student body card for the purpose of
being able to purchase football tickets while he was out
of Stanford for a quarter. He is a self-described "football
freak."
Although there are certain differences from the case
of Mr. R. also decided today, we arc convinced that, on
the whole, the two cases present situations so close that,
in fairness, we cannot distinguish between them.
The panel recommends that the defendant be sus
pended for Spring Quarter.
