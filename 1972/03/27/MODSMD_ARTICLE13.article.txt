# A 						Night To Forget
## Winterland At Its Very Worst 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
The most entertaining thing
about last Saturday's Winterland
show was seeing how much dope,
alcohol and nicotine the people
around me could consume in a
five hour sitting. And 1 can defi
nitely say that my audience neigh
bors' performances with bottles,
joints and pipes were more enjoy
able than the combined musical
offerings of the show's three
groups.
Before getting into the specif
ics of this musical nightmare, let
me suggest that you get a pen and
add the following three groups to
your list of BANDS TO BE
AVOIDED. In alphabetical order,
add the Blues Project, Emerson,
Lake & Palmer and The Mahavish
nu Orchestra.
I'd probably like to stop right
here and try to forget about the
entire show, but neither rain, sleet
or utter musical trash can keep me
from my appointed rounds as a
critic. To try and decide which of
the evening's three groups was the
worst though is probably an im
possible job since all have sunk be
low that level where you stop dis
tinguishing between different de-.
grees of incompetence. Let me
just say that all three are very,
very bad.
Since all three then are in a
dead heat for the award as worst
group of the night, I guess a
chronological recap is the only
way to discuss them.
The Blues Project set the tone
for the evening with an opening
number that only succeeded in
making me wonder why anybody,
much less Bill Graham, would've
brought these guys out from New
York. And except for one fairly
good traditional blues number,
the rest of their set did little to
answer my wonderment.

Probably the most notable
thing about this group was that
their lead singer could look a lot
like Alice Cooper if he'd let his
stringy black hair grow a bit. And
he seems to be trying for such a
comparison since he loves to jump
up and down and make wide gy
rations with his arm and do other
pseudo-calisthenics. After hearing
him sing, I'd much rather just
watch him jump around. Oh, I al
most forgot the one good thing
about the Blues Project's set: at
45 minutes it was the shortest of
the evening.
Next up was The Mahavishnu
Orchestra with John McLaughlin.
Mahavishnu centers around the
highly-acclaimed McLaughlin who
plays what appears to be two
guitars welded together. I guess
McLaughlin was thinking along
the old "Double your pleasure,
double your fun" lines, but he
ended up more correctly only
doubling some of the garbage this
group poured out.
McLaughlin did show flashes of
some fine technical ability on his
Siamese-twin guitar and the
group's drummer has extremely
quick and talended hands. But as
a group, Mahavishnu is eminently
forgetable.
Unpleasant Music
Mahavishnu played six num
bers which averaged about 15
minutes each in length and all of
which featured a content of un
structured, often dissonant and al
most always unpleasant music.
What was most disheartening was
that the audience really ate it up
probably because of the "If I
don't understand it, it must be
heavy" syndrome. When Fillmore
West closed last summer Bill
Graham made a comment about

how the Fillmore audiences seem
ed to have lost much of their mu
sical taste and last night's audi
ence proved that a change of halls
hasn't ended that trend.
The "headliners" of the show
were England's Emerson, Lake &
Palmer. Some of their recorded
work has been fairly interesting
and many people have raved to
me about their live performances,
but any talent they have was no
where in evidence on Saturday
night.
To understand what Emerson,
Lake & Palmer did you must
think about the two main tech
niques bands can use to try and
cover up rotten music. Some
bands turn everything up as loud
as they can and try to blow the
audience out of the hall. Others
do what Emerson, Lake & Palmer

did on Saturday night and try to
substitute gimmickery for good
music. It doesn't work.
The Ultimate Gimmick
And Emerson, Lake & Palmer
has a Moog Synthesizer which in
the hands of Keith Emerson is
used most of the time as the ulti
mate gimmick. Some people have
compared this group to the
Moody Blues, since they're both
from England and both use a
synthesizer, but any further com
parison can only tarnish the mag
nificent musical ability of the
Moody Blues.
On the synthesizer, Emerson is
able to produce the sounds of a
siren, machine gun fire, dripping
water, wind and assorted sounds
which would fit right in with a TV
show like Lost In Space. Big Deal.
Every once in a while he does pro

duce some musically interesting
sounds on the Moog, and a couple
of times Emerson showed good
keyboard technique on a piano,
but most of the time he was like a
little kid with a new toy.
What is most interesting is that
Emerson's facial expression often
makes it look like he's engaging in
sexual intercourse with the Moog.
And near the end of the set he
starts stabbing one of the key
boards with a knife. Maybe Freud
could figure it all out.
With Lee Michaels, Sha-Na-Na,
J. Geils, and Dave Mason all com
ing to Winterland in the near fu
ture, things are bound to get bet
ter. It may be a bit cliched to say
it, but they couldn't get any
worse. Maybe I should've spent
my vacation in Gilroy after all.
