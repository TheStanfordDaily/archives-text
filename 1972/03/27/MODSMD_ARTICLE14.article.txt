### 
Anyone who will be
sponsoring a film series this
quarter is requested to send
the Daily a schedule of their
series listing films, times,
locations and prices. Please
do this as soon as possible so
we can maintain a complete
listing of films in our
entertainment calendar.
Anyone else who is
sponsoring an entertainment
event of any kind next
quarter is also requested to
send information of such
events to the Entertainment
Editor, c/o The Stanford
Daily, Stanford, Calif. 94305.
