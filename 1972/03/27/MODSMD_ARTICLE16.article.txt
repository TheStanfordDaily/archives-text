# Entertainment Vs. Enlightenment
## Two Different Kinds Of Theatre 
### DOUG ARTHUR 
On two consecutive nights I
attended two plays which
might illustrate the diversity,
and even conscious opposition,
between entertainment and en
lightenment. Not that these
qualities need necessarily be op
posed; it just seems that the
visible strivings of the modern
theatre tend to be identified
with the latter.
Noel Coward's "Private
Lives," a situation comedy in
which two affluent sophisticates
find each other after five years
of alternate marriages, dump
their spouses, and flee to Paris
and a very predictable life of
quarrels, is an escape into the
bourgeois realm of domestic
strife. Coward's dialogue still
has punch, and the comic in
cidents appear amusing if not
plausible.
The ACT production of
Coward's play promised and
gave an entertaining evening
provided one left his cares and
thoughts outside the door of
the Geary Theatre. Four musi
cians provided accompaniment
to the play and through inter
missions. The light piano bar
music and innocuous songs an
ticipated the action onstage. It
was like a prolonged nightclub
act with a few more characters
and a few more gestures than
usual. I found it totally ap
propriate that spectators re
quested old favorites from the
musicians at intermission.
Director Francis Coppola's

staging compensated for any in
adequacies in the script: espe
cially in the first scenes, the
small bits of action helped us
identify the characters along
with their dialogue. The block
ing sustained interest in some
sections of the play that would
have otherwise faltered. I en
joyed the fight scene in Act 2
between the re-united lovers;
the physical smashing of the
collapsible set resembled
knock-about farce—it built up
to a rousing crescendo upon
which the unwanted spouses
entered. With the exception of
the beginning of the play,
which was a little too fast, the
pacing of the show accentuated
the humor in the script.
Robert Blackman's scenery
created a glamorous background
for the play. Amanda's fiat in
Paris is an eloquently decorated
room in the modernistic style
of the 1930'5, complete with
sumptuous rugs, modernistic
furniture, and works of art.
The costumes by Robert
Fletcher flamboyantly displayed
the nature of the characters:
Amanda's gowns scream money.
Outstanding in the case was
Michael Learned's Amanda
Prynne. She used her throaty
voice to the utmost advantage
in getting her way. Her facial
and body gestures indicated her
worldly wisdom and sophistica
tion. Her quick changes from
bored disinterestedness to emo
tional anger underlined the hu
mor in the situations.

The production, with its
nightclub musicians, gorgeous
sets and costumes, emphasized
the escapist element of
Coward's play. For what it
was, this slick production of
the show was excellent. Its
goal, a pleasant evening of
entertainment, was fully
achieved.
Far less pleasant, and infinitely
more challenging, was the
University of Santa Clara's "And
They Put Handcuffs on the
Flowers," guest-directed by its
playwright, Fernando Arrabal.
This work is a brutal series of
vignettes, some theatrically
brilliant, dealing with political
prisoners in Franco's Spain.
It would be fairly easy to
dislike this theatre. Spectators are
grabbed, one by one, hustled
through the darkness of electronic
screams, and shoved into the seats
of UCSC's Barn theatre. Some
scenes would be sure to offend
almost anyone: Christ gives a
blessing while getting a blow-job;
sodomy between the prisoners;
the emphasis on escatology; the

instances of symbolic violence,
including a garroting chair.
What makes this play vital is
the ferocity with which the theme
of the terrifying daily lives of the
prisoners is portrayed. The
prisoners are enclosed in a cage
near the center of the barn. Their
dreams and nightmares occur,
under garish lights, outside of the
cage in different sections of the
barn. A child, clothed in white,
narrates part of the script
pertaining to the inhuman prison
conditions.
With heads shaved and wearing
worn-out fatigues, the actors
appeared to be of an
indeterminate age: their sense of
physical and mental exhaustion
was overwhelming. In all of the
scenes, I was impressed by the
actors' lack of self-consciousness.
Arrabal's direction utilized
bodily gestures and stage action in
a forceful manner. During an
interrogation, the prisoner and the
guard crawl back and forth. The
trial is a boxing match—a perfect
metaphor for the type of sham
trials that we have been witnessing

recently. A prisoner in a cage says
farewell to his wife: only a
moving flashback is needed to
indicate the gap between them.
Arrabal's theatre has a peculiar
quality of childlike innocence,
even in the most degrading or
grotesque situations. This
production made me realize what
levity can be interspersed with the
horrible instances of torture.
Actors pretend to be animals, and
take a keen delight in their
sexuality. The satiric attacks on
the corrupt government and
judiciary are alternated with
ironic perspectives of the
prisoners: at one point a man
dressed as a ballerina dances in
and out of the play.
For all of its grotesque scenes,
the most powerful scene found
the naked prisoner dragged slowly
around the stage in a white sheet.
Arrabal's play was an intellectual
tour de force as well as a unique
theatrical experience. Unlike
"Private Lives" which lulled us
into complacency, Arrabal
confronts us with the daily
atrocities that are being
committed in our name.
