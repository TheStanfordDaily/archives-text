# Testimony Begins In Davis Trial
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
Testimony in the Angela Davis trial
begins this week, more than a year and
a half after a Marin County Grand
Jury indicted Davis for murder,
kidnap, and conspiracy.
After three weeks of jury selection
and a ten-day recess, the trial will
reconvene at 9:30 a.m. for opening
arguments, followed by prosecution
testimony in Courtroom No. 1 of the
Santa Clara County Criminal-Legal
Building in San Jose.
Albert Harris and Clifford
Thompson of the State
Attorney-General's Office, who are
prosecuting the case, plan an opening
statement, but the seven-person
defense team has not indicated
whether it will address the court at the
beginning of the trial.
The trial will probably last three to
six months, depending in large part
upon the number of witnesses
presented by the defense. Harris and
Thompson plan to call 104
prosecution witnesses.
1970 Kidnapping
The charges against Davis stem from
an April 7, 1970 kidnapping in a Marin
County courtroom, and a subsequent
gunfight outside the courthouse in
which four people were killed and
three wounded.
One of the four was Marin Superior
Court Judge Harold Haley, who was
abducted with others in what authori
ties claim was an attempt to free the
three "Soledad Brothers," accused of
murdering a Soledad State Prison
guard.
The hostages taken in the kid
napping were to be exchanged for the
three, the state contends. A jury is
now deliberating in the San Francisco
trial of the two surviving Soledad
Brothers, John Cluchette and Fleeta
Drumgo.
The weapons used in the abortive
kidnap were smuggled into the court
room by Jonathan Jackson, 17, who
died along with Haley and two San
Quentin prison convicts being tried in
his courtroom, in the shootout which
followed.
Friend of Davis
Jonathan Jackson was a close friend
of Davis, and a brother of the late
George Jackson, one of the Soledad

Brothers, who was killed by prison
guards while allegedly attempting to
escape from San Quentin Prison last
August.
Davis, who was arrested in New
York by the FBI months after the
shootout, is accused of helping plan
the kidnapping with Jackson and of
furnishing the guns he smuggled into
the courtroom.
Most of the state's witnesses against
Davis are federal, state, and Marin
County law enforcement officers who
were summoned to the courthouse to
prevent the kidnapping, and partici
pated in the shootout which followed
it.
An all points bulletin has been
circulated by the Marin County Sheriff
for a missing prosecution witness,
former deptuy sheriff James Layne,

who was a bailiff in Haley's courtroom
during the kidnapping.
Trial Transfer
Davis' trial was transferred to Santa
Clara County from Marin County on a
change of venue motion, despite her
objections because of the small num
ber of blacks here. She had requested a
move to San Francisco.
The black communist will be tried
by an all-white jury. Contra Costa
County Superior Court Judge Richard
Arnason, who was selected after
several other judges were disqualified,
will preside.
Prosecutors and defense attorneys
agreed on the four-man, eight-women
jury in only two weeks, expending
only four of the 20 prosecution
pre-emptory challenges allowed and
only two of the defense challenges.
Selection of three men and one
woman to sit as alternate jurors in the
case consumed another week. One
student is included among the alter
nate jurors.
Davis was released on $102,500 bail
after the California Supreme Court
decided that the death penalty violat
ed provisions of the state constitution

prohibiting "cruel or unusual" punish
ment.
She had been jailed because of
California Penal Code Section 1270,
which states: "A defendant charged
with an offense punishable with death
cannot be admitted to bail, when
proof of his guilt is evident or the
presumption thereof great."
Arnason had previously decided
that Davis was not a flight risk, and

released her when the death penalty
was abolished.
A Supreme Court clarification re
leased after the decision ordered the
continued application of the Penal
Code section.
Nevertheless, state Attorney Gener
al Evelle Younger decided not to ask
Arnason to rescind his bail decision,
though bail could legally have been
revoked.

Friend of Davis
Jonathan Jackson was a close friend
of Davis, and a brother of the late
George Jackson, one of the Soledad

Brothers, who was killed by prison
guards while allegedly attempting to
escape from San Quentin Prison last
August.
Davis, who was arrested in New
York by the FBI months after the
shootout, is accused of helping plan
the kidnapping with Jackson and of
furnishing the guns he smuggled into
the courtroom.
Most of the state's witnesses against
Davis are federal, state, and Marin
County law enforcement officers who
were summoned to the courthouse to
prevent the kidnapping, and partici
pated in the shootout which followed
it.
An all points bulletin has been
circulated by the Marin County Sheriff
for a missing prosecution witness,
former deptuy sheriff James Layne,

who was a bailiff in Haley's courtroom
during the kidnapping.
Trial Transfer
Davis' trial was transferred to Santa
Clara County from Marin County on a
change of venue motion, despite her
objections because of the small num
ber of blacks here. She had requested a
move to San Francisco.
The black communist will be tried
by an all-white jury. Contra Costa
County Superior Court Judge Richard
Arnason, who was selected after
several other judges were disqualified,
will preside.
Prosecutors and defense attorneys
agreed on the four-man, eight-women
jury in only two weeks, expending
only four of the 20 prosecution
pre-emptory challenges allowed and
only two of the defense challenges.
Selection of three men and one
woman to sit as alternate jurors in the
case consumed another week. One
student is included among the alter
nate jurors.
Davis was released on $102,500 bail
after the California Supreme Court
decided that the death penalty violat
ed provisions of the state constitution

prohibiting "cruel or unusual" punish
ment.
She had been jailed because of
California Penal Code Section 1270,
which states: "A defendant charged
with an offense punishable with death
cannot be admitted to bail, when
proof of his guilt is evident or the
presumption thereof great."
Arnason had previously decided
that Davis was not a flight risk, and

released her when the death penalty
was abolished.
A Supreme Court clarification re
leased after the decision ordered the
continued application of the Penal
Code section.
Nevertheless, state Attorney Gener
al Evelle Younger decided not to ask
Arnason to rescind his bail decision,
though bail could legally have been
revoked.
Testimony in the Angela Davis trial
begins this week, more than a year and
a half after a Marin County Grand
Jury indicted Davis for murder,
kidnap, and conspiracy.
After three weeks of jury selection
and a ten-day recess, the trial will
reconvene at 9:30 a.m. for opening
arguments, followed by prosecution
testimony in Courtroom No. 1 of the
Santa Clara County Criminal-Legal
Building in San Jose.
Albert Harris and Clifford
Thompson of the State
Attorney-General's Office, who are
prosecuting the case, plan an opening
statement, but the seven-person
defense team has not indicated
whether it will address the court at the
beginning of the trial.
The trial will probably last three to
six months, depending in large part
upon the number of witnesses
presented by the defense. Harris and
Thompson plan to call 104
prosecution witnesses.
1970 Kidnapping
The charges against Davis stem from
an April 7, 1970 kidnapping in a Marin
County courtroom, and a subsequent
gunfight outside the courthouse in
which four people were killed and
three wounded.
One of the four was Marin Superior
Court Judge Harold Haley, who was
abducted with others in what authori
ties claim was an attempt to free the
three "Soledad Brothers," accused of
murdering a Soledad State Prison
guard.
The hostages taken in the kid
napping were to be exchanged for the
three, the state contends. A jury is
now deliberating in the San Francisco
trial of the two surviving Soledad
Brothers, John Cluchette and Fleeta
Drumgo.
The weapons used in the abortive
kidnap were smuggled into the court
room by Jonathan Jackson, 17, who
died along with Haley and two San
Quentin prison convicts being tried in
his courtroom, in the shootout which
followed.
