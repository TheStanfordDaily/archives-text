## 
### 
The 1972 Stanford track and
field opened its season with three
impressive dual meet wins, and a
fourth place finish in a field of
nine teams last weekend in the
Easter Relays at Santa Barbara.
Although the Cards failed to
capture a first place in any of the
relays at Santa Barbara, three
Stanford trackmen reached the
finals in individual events. In the
100, sophomore Ken Curl finished
a close fourth with a 9.9 clocking.
In the triple jump, Rod Utley was
also fourth with a 47-3'/2 jump.
Tom Anderson leaped 22-11 to
garner third place in the long
jump.
Redlands Outlegged
Last Wednesday, Stanford won
all eleven running events and
scored a 109-50 triumph over
Redlands. Curl led the Cards with
sprint victories in the 100 with a
â€¢9.8 time and the 220 in 21.6.
John Kessel sped to a 49.8 win

in the 440, while Les McFadden
won the 880 in 1:55.4. In the
mile run, Brian Mittelstaedt loped
to an easy 4:17.4 win over
teammates Dave Whiteing and
Arvid Kretz. Kretz returned to
win in the two mile with a 9:28.6
timing.
Oxy Beaten In L.A.
A week ago, Stanford downed
Occidental, 99-46. It was first
time the Cards had managed to
defeat Oxy in Los Angeles.
Junior Tom Anderson led
Stanford as high point man for
the Cardinals with wins in the
long jump (24-0V&) and the 440
dash (48.1), a second place in the
high jump and running a leg in the
victorious 440 relay. Curl was also
a triple winner with wins in the
100 (9.8), the 220 (21.5), and
anchorman on the 440 relay.
In the Cards' season opener on
March 4, Stanford outpointed
Fresno State, 100-63.
