### THERESA RAMIREZ 
The AKSU Senate has endorsed a
proposal for the establishment of a
ni w judicial system which features a
trial b> jury, and recommended that
the proposal be submitted to the
Committee of 15 for review.
The proposal, entitled the
University Judicial System, was
prepared by a three member,
unofficial Senate committee headed
by Ed Hayes, president of the Law
School Students Association. Hayes
began working on the proposal in
October at the request of Senate
Chairman James Jefferson.
Fredrick Crawford, chairman of the
Committee of Fifteen, says that the
C-15 has not yet "formally" received a
copy of the proposal, although some
student members of the C-15 do have
copies of it.
Crawford said that he was
contacted by John McNeece, an ASSU
senator who helped Hayes prepare the
proposal, and Crawford expects
McNeece wit! arrange to present the
proposal to the C-15 possibly during
the next two weeks.
Council Authority
The proposed University Judicial
System would have jurisdiction over
students and faculty, with the
provision that in the case of the
faculty, the Academic Council will still
have the authority to act on matters
"which involve professional standards

and/or ethics."
The University Judicial System is
made up of four parts. It includes a
University Judicial Panel (UJP), a
University Trial Court (UTC), a Panel
of Hearing Officers, and the Dean of
Students.
A student may choose to have his
case heard before any of the four
bodies.
The University Judicial Panel
(UJP), would be made up of a
Presiding Judge and two Associate
Judges. "Among its other duties, the
Panel shall determine sanction in cases
heard before the University Trial
Court," according to the proposal.
The UJP's Presiding Judge would be
a lawyer, not connected with Stanford
University. The Dean of the law school
would select the Presiding Judge and
the two Associate Judges, subject to
the approval of the law faculty and the
President of the University.
One student and one faculty
member will hold the two places as
Associate Judges. The Student
Associate judges will be chosen in an
annual general election of the student
body.
The faculty Associate Judge "shall
be chosen by the Academic Council of
the University in the manner it deems
most appropriate."
The University Trial Court (UTC) is
made up of the University Judicial
Panel (UJP) and a jury. In the case of a

student, the jury will consist of seven
jurors randomly selected from a pool
of 20 students. For faculty the seven
faculty jurors are to be selected from a
pool of 20 faculty members. A vote of
five of the seven jurors will determine
guilt or innocence.
If he wants, a student or faculty
member may have his case heard by a
four member Panel of Hearing
Officers. The members of the Panel are
to be selected by the Dean of the Law
School and the two Associate Judges
of the UJP and must be "qualified
members of the community."
Four Options
A student may still choose to ?iave
his case heard by the Ivan of
Students, who has the option of
refusing to hear the esse
Hayes says that the proposal is not
yet in its final form, though he expects
it to be when it is presented to the
Committee of Fifteen. The proposal
has not been widt !y distributed
because, Hayes says,"i? may
jeopardize the outcome of rensitive
negotiations which ere going on eight
now."
Proposal Criticized
Hayes has already received criticism
that the proposal i.-j not feasible. "I
think that feasibility is u legitimate
concern," says Hayes, "but I think
that it can be overcome."

which was created by President Lyman
after the Student Senate refused to
nominate student members to the
Student Judicial Council (SJC).
