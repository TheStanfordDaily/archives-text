# Faculty Votes Support For Open Recruiting
## 
### 
The Facility Senate two weeks ago recommended against barring military
recruiters from the formal placement facilities.
By a 31 to 6 vote, the faculty group on March 16 advised President Richard
Lyman not to accept a recommendation of the Committee on Student Services
(COSS) to bar military recruiters from campus placement centers. Lyman had
asked the advice of the Senate on the issue.
The Senate then voted by a divided voice vote to urge "the University
AdmÂ»nistration to seek effective means of relieving pressure" on higher
education from riders on Congressional appropriations. The resolution noted
tha* two appropriation bills (for DoD research funds and NASA research grants)
denies funds to universities that bar Armed Forces' recruiters from campus and
"regrets that federal funding of research programs may be decided by such a
factor extraneous to their merits."
Lyman told the Senate that Stanford risked the loss of more than $16 million
annually in research funds if it imposed selective restrictions on military
recruiters.
He quoted from a letter from a Washington, D.C., attorney who had consulted
with the Defense Department on the placement issue. The attorney explained
that the Defense Department designated those institutions that bar recruiting
personnel from their property on the basis of reports from personnel in the
fields. He said that there are approximately seven small colleges currently on the
list prepared by the DoD that will not receive DoD funds.
