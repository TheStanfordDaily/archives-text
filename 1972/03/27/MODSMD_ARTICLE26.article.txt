Dita Beard Speaks, Collapses
DENIVER, Colo. — Lobbyist Dita D. Beard collapsed
yesterday, several hours after testifying that her boss at
International Telephone & Telegraph Corp. got a phone
call from an unidentified White House staffer who, she
said, believed the conglomerate would donate $600,000
toward President Nixon's re-election campaign.
She denied—for the first time under oath—that it was
the same memo attributed to her by columnist Jack
Anderson. The Anderson memo linked the convention
contribution to an out-of-court settlement by the Justice
Department of an anti-trust case against ITT. Mrs. Beard
said she did not link the two actions.
The ITT lobbyist was questioned in her hospital room
by the senators for about 90 minutes. She collapsed
during a second questioning session which immediately
was called off pending new examinations by doctors
attending her.
IRA Calls Bombing Halt

Army's Provisional wing announced early this morning a
one-month suspension of its attacks against civilian
targets.
The command said it hoped the British government

A statement issued by Provisional chiefs in London
derry made it clear there would be no truce with the
15,000 British soldiers in the province. But the
Provisionals said they would remain quiet beyond the
month if the troops were withdrawn.
The statement said suspension attacks against
civilian targets would apply to rovisionals, the
militant nationalist wing of the o'>« - <_• f IA.

VANC'.v '< r. ft WASH. — A Superior Court jury returned
verrti fs y \;r.<?r(iay in favor of San Francisco Mayor Joseph
A'«'aivl two former Washington state officials in a $2.3
m'Jlion civ,J fee-splitting trial.
The Clark County jury of six men and six women
deliberated more than lO'/i hours before announcing at
1:55 p.m. that a verdict had been reached.

The defendants also face federal criminal charges of
conspiring to bribe a state official in connection with the
same set of circumstances. A tentative trial date has been
set for April 17 and a pretrial hearing will be held next
Friday in Seattle to consider whether to move the trial to
another city and whether the April 17 date should be
made firm.
The plaintiffs—the state of Washington and 12 publicly
owned utilities in the state-—sought the recovery of $2.3
million in legal fees paid to Alioto for antitrust work
during the 19605.
The suit contended Alioto improperly and secretly
shared $800,000 of his fee with the two officials.

Dita Beard Speaks, Collapses
DENIVER, Colo. — Lobbyist Dita D. Beard collapsed
yesterday, several hours after testifying that her boss at
International Telephone & Telegraph Corp. got a phone
call from an unidentified White House staffer who, she
said, believed the conglomerate would donate $600,000
toward President Nixon's re-election campaign.
She denied—for the first time under oath—that it was
the same memo attributed to her by columnist Jack
Anderson. The Anderson memo linked the convention
contribution to an out-of-court settlement by the Justice
Department of an anti-trust case against ITT. Mrs. Beard
said she did not link the two actions.
The ITT lobbyist was questioned in her hospital room
by the senators for about 90 minutes. She collapsed
during a second questioning session which immediately
was called off pending new examinations by doctors
attending her.
