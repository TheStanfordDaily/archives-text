# Grad Student Convinces FDA To Disclose Additive Tests
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
A Stanford graduate student in genetics, in conjunction
with a Berkeley legal and environmental group, has
convinced the Food and Drug Administration to disclose
how it evaluates a possibly dangerous food additive,
sodium nitrite.
Dale Hattis, the genetics student, had been asking the
FDA for nearly two years to give him information on the
tests it runs on sodium nitrite, since he fears it can
become a cancer-producing and mutagenic agent in
combination with other food chemicals.
Under the pressure of a law suit filed last month, the
FDA agreed to change its policy which restricted public
access to information supplied by manufacturers, on
chemical additives to food but only in the case of sodium
nitrite. The FDA originally argued that information on
the use of these additives was a "trade secret" of the
manufacturers which should not be released.
Tests To Be Released
FDA assistant general counsel Peter Hutt last week
promised to release the information on tests used to
evaluate sodium nitrite's safety.
But Thomas Graff, attorney for the Berkeley-based
Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) which brought the
suit, feels confident that this action will lead to the release
of information on all food additives whose harmfulness is
in question.

According to Graff, "the case established a precedent
that safety is not still a trade secret." He added that "It
looks like the FDA is coming around" to making available
information on all chemical additives.
The actual suit brought by the EDF will be dropped,
according to Graff, now that the FDA has agreed to
disclose the information.
Genetics student Hattis is interested in the tests the
FDA has made on sodium nitrite to determine whether
they take into account new information on the chemical.
He says that other scientists are concerned that derivatives
of the chemical can cause cancer in mice and rats.
Need Further Investigations
Hattis feels that the evidence on sodium nitrite calls for
further investigations. He is also doing research to
establish new standards for judging mutation producing
agents, of which sodium nitrite may be one example.
Hattis came to the EDF which is largely made up of
lawyers, for their help in obtaining the data on sodium
nitrite from the FDA. A former associate of Ralph Nader,
he presently lives on campus in Ecology House.
Stanford's Nobel prizewinning geneticist, Joshua
Lederberg, also Hied a statement supporting the suit,
stressing the importance of allowing scientists to evaluate
ahead of time the effect of any possibly dangerous
chemicals.
