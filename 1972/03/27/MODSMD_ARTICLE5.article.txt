# Franklin Firing
## Court Challenge Planned 
### FRANK MILLER 
The firing of English Professor H.
Bruce Franklin will be challenged in a
court case sponsored by the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), prob
ably in two to three months.
The Directors of the Northern
California ACLU voted March 9 to
explore the possibility of intervening
on behalf of Franklin. Since then staff
counsel for the ACLU-NC have met
with Franklin and the ACLU-NC will
"represent" Franklin, according to
Chuck Marston, staff counsel for the
organization.
Marston, who will become the legal
director of the ACLU-NC in June, said
that he would have to study the entire
testimony of Franklin's six week
hearing before he can actually file a
court challenge of the firing. He feels
that the substantial ground-work for
the filing will take "a couple of
months."
The board's action to support
Franklin was taken after reading the
text of the Advisory Board decision in
the case and after receiving both
written and oral presentations from
law professor Alan Dershowitz of
Harvard, now at the Center for the
Advanced Study of the Behavioral
Sciences, and Stanford law professor
Gerald Gunther. Dershowitz criticized
and Gunther defended the Advisory
Board Report.
Jay A. Miller, ACLU-NU executive
director, said: "It's just impossible for
us to believe that Franklin's speeches
represented incitement. They were
advocacy."
Standards Would Be 'Disaster'
The standards used in the case, if
applied to the outside community,
"would be a disaster," he continued.
"We are afraid they would become the
standard of other colleges and univer
sities if this case is not won."
If followed by other major private
universities and even public institu

tions, Miller said, the Advisory Board
decision "would mean there would be
a different standard of speech in the
commons [public places] of the
university than on the street corner."
Had Franklin been speaking on a
street corner instead of on campus,
Miller said, "There's no question that
what he said was completely permissi
ble.
Franklin told the Daily that by
challenging his firing in court, "whet
her we win or lose . . . makes it much
harder for Stanford or other institu
tions to fire people for political
viewpoints."
He said he was very pleased that
Marston was taking the case personally
and said he felt he had a "good chance
of winning. The ACLU-NC doesn't feel
they have any choice to allow such a
foul assault on free speech ... to go
unchallenged."
ACLU-NC Newsletter
In the regular ACLU-NC newsletter
mailed this week to members, Miller
writes, "Stanford's first amendment
interpretation cannot go unchallenged
or academic freedom on all campuses,
public and private, will be imperiled."
The ACLU-NC Board of Directors
concluded that Franklin was dis
charged for making statements pro
tected by the first amendment, Miller
argues.
The article concludes, "Certainly
the mere expression of support for the
goals of those who commit unlawful
acts and the affirmation and belief of
the legitimacy of their grievances
cannot be called 'incitement' without
torturing the word. Franklin at no
time urged immediate unlawful
action."
The ACLU-NC will handle
Franklin's case at no cost to Franklin.
Franklin says, however, that the
money that has been collected for his
court challenge by a defense commit
tee would be used for assistance and

research to the ACLU-NC attorneys.
President Richard Lyman said yes
terday that an outside law firm would
handle the University's defense.
Possible success of the court chal
lenge is uncertain, although the ACLU
is optimistic. Marston said that al
though he hadnot yet studied the
documents of the six-week hearing, he
felt their chances of winning were
"good." Joel Klein, one of Franklin's
co-counsel during the hearings, admits
that he's "not a great optimist" on the
case although "after talking to the
ACLU and others I think we have a
good chance."
Gunther disagrees. He termed
chances for the firing being overturned
"quite low" and claimed that most
lawyers familiar with the case also
"think they would be quite low."
Protecting First Amendment Rights
Klein notes that in firing Franklin
Stanford said that first amendment
rights would be protected and set up
standards for their application. "If
they stick to that in court... I think
they'll be overturned," he claimed.
Marston said that Stanford has said
it would follow first amendment
guidelines in considering Franklin's
case and that the University has "not
fulfilled that promise ... Stanford's
new to the first amendment. This
might be a good experience to show
them what this really means."
Marston said there are no real
precedents for the case and that is one
of the reasons the ACLU-NC is taking
the case. Franklin agrees and says that
this case is unique since he was not
prosecuted in criminal court for
actions that he was fired for allegedly
advocating. "In the general wave of
political persecutions ... most institu
tions were much more subtle than
Stanford." They prosecuted them for
such things as "breaking the grading
structure. This is a direct attack on
speech," Franklin claims.
