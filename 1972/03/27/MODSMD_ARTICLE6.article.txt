## Escalation Of Political Repression 
### 
i pete knutson

If our suspensions have done
nothing else, they have at least
underlined the administrations
determination to run Stanford in
a fashion favorable to corporate
interests, regardless of the desires
of those affected by that decision.
If a three minute, non-violent
disruption of corporate business
now warrants a three quarter
suspension it is obvious that the
repression of students for active
political dissent has begun to
approach the level of oppression
imposed upon the Stanford facul
ty since the Franklin firing.
Having enumerated and later
abandoned a series of rather
tenuous arguments concerning
military and corporate recruiting
on campus, Lyman in a winter
quarter confrontation with pro
testing fasters was forced to admit
the actual basis for his decision on
recruiting policy. It was not, as he
had suggested in other years, the
consent of students, faculty or
anyone else, but rather the power
vested in him by the trustees.
Lyman has often stated his
strongly-held belief that the Uni
versity cannot and should not be
run democratically. His actions,
have certainly been consistent
with those expressed beliefs.
Viewed concretely as a power
relationship, the issue of campus
recruiting by the military and
militarily-related corporations is
obviously not one which will be
resolved by simple persuasion. It
is a question of power. Lyman
further acknowledged this fact
last fall when he stated that he did
"not simply await advice on the

[recruiting J matter." In fact,
Lyman actually rejected the ad
vice from his own Committee on
Student Services which had given
him an "unfavorable" recommen
dation on the recruiting issue.
As Lyman clearly realizes, his
power to make institutional deci
sions flows from and is circum
scribed by those who control the
purse strings — the corporate
interests. The Trustees, as major
industrialists, have been quite
influential in charting Stanford's
course, particularly in the areas of
land use, recruiting and research
policies. Ralph Keller, director of
the Stanford Placement Center,
testified to the existence of
corporate influence upon Stan
ford decision-making processes in
a May 20, 1971 memorandum to
the Committee on Student Ser
vices, stating, "Another issue
evolves for consideration which
might be of some importance.
Much of the support for the
School of Engineering and the
Graduate School of Business
comes from organizations in busi
ness and industry which are
among the leading prime defense
contractors." It was no accident
that the Durand Aerospace Build
ing (Aero & Astro) was con
structed with 1.4 million dollars
of Lockheed, Boeing, General

Dynamics and General Electric
money. Richard Lyman himself
did much of the corporate fund
raising for that edifice.
It is clear where Richard
Lyman's power grows out of.
Provided he acts within the
parameters of corporate needs,
the David Packards, Ernie Ar
buckles, and Bill Hewletts will
continue to supply the finances
and forces necessary to maintain
Lyman's rule.
The administration's decision to
suspend four students for an
extremely minor disruption of
corporate business at Stanford is
an unmistakable statement to the
Stanford community that any
challenge to the reign of cor
porate-military priorities at Stan
ford will be firmly suppressed.
Neither referendums nor commit
tee reports and neither fasts nor
other non-violent actions will
affect the decision-making process
at Stanford, Lyman seems to be
telling us. In fact, judging by his
actions, that type of behavior will
be repressed.
Lyman has moved often in the
past year to assert his power over
the Stanford community through
firings, injunctions and suspen
sions in unsuccessful attempts to
silence the resistance to the
corporate priorities of the institu-

tion. In so doing, he has employed
his semantic skills in an effort to
redefine "violence." Violence in
Lyman's eyes now constitutes a
broad range of protest actions
hitherto considered non-violent
including both sit-ins (which he
outlawed) and fasts (which he
termed coercive).
Understanding the power rela
tionship which encourages Lyman
to repress political dissent and
ignore legitimate grievances,
brings one to the realization that
those affected by Stanford poli
cies will only begin to seize
control of the decision-making
process when they themselves
begin to directly challenge the real
foundations of power at Stanford.
Lyman's attempt to stifle active
political dissent directed against
Stanford contributions to the
Indochinese war and the Ameri
can Empire must be challenged.
Tuesday night in Branner lounge
at 7:30 pm a response to this
escalation of political repression
will be planned. If further repres
sion is not to ensue, we must act
decisive. I would urge all those
concerned about the rights of
dissent on the Stanford campus to
attend the meeting.

buckles, and Bill Hewletts will
continue to supply the finances
and forces necessary to maintain
Lyman's rule.
The administration's decision to
suspend four students for an
extremely minor disruption of
corporate business at Stanford is
an unmistakable statement to the
Stanford community that any
challenge to the reign of cor
porate-military priorities at Stan
ford will be firmly suppressed.
Neither referendums nor commit
tee reports and neither fasts nor
other non-violent actions will
affect the decision-making process
at Stanford, Lyman seems to be
telling us. In fact, judging by his
actions, that type of behavior will
be repressed.
Lyman has moved often in the
past year to assert his power over
the Stanford community through
firings, injunctions and suspen
sions in unsuccessful attempts to
silence the resistance to the
corporate priorities of the institu-

tion. In so doing, he has employed
his semantic skills in an effort to
redefine "violence." Violence in
Lyman's eyes now constitutes a
broad range of protest actions
hitherto considered non-violent
including both sit-ins (which he
outlawed) and fasts (which he
termed coercive).
Understanding the power rela
tionship which encourages Lyman
to repress political dissent and
ignore legitimate grievances,
brings one to the realization that
those affected by Stanford poli
cies will only begin to seize
control of the decision-making
process when they themselves
begin to directly challenge the real
foundations of power at Stanford.
Lyman's attempt to stifle active
political dissent directed against
Stanford contributions to the
Indochinese war and the Ameri
can Empire must be challenged.
Tuesday night in Branner lounge
at 7:30 pm a response to this
escalation of political repression
will be planned. If further repres
sion is not to ensue, we must act
decisive. I would urge all those
concerned about the rights of
dissent on the Stanford campus to
attend the meeting.

If our suspensions have done
nothing else, they have at least
underlined the administrations
determination to run Stanford in
a fashion favorable to corporate
interests, regardless of the desires
of those affected by that decision.
If a three minute, non-violent
disruption of corporate business
now warrants a three quarter
suspension it is obvious that the
repression of students for active
political dissent has begun to
approach the level of oppression
imposed upon the Stanford facul
ty since the Franklin firing.
Having enumerated and later
abandoned a series of rather
tenuous arguments concerning
military and corporate recruiting
on campus, Lyman in a winter
quarter confrontation with pro
testing fasters was forced to admit
the actual basis for his decision on
recruiting policy. It was not, as he
had suggested in other years, the
consent of students, faculty or
anyone else, but rather the power
vested in him by the trustees.
Lyman has often stated his
strongly-held belief that the Uni
versity cannot and should not be
run democratically. His actions,
have certainly been consistent
with those expressed beliefs.
Viewed concretely as a power
relationship, the issue of campus
recruiting by the military and
militarily-related corporations is
obviously not one which will be
resolved by simple persuasion. It
is a question of power. Lyman
further acknowledged this fact
last fall when he stated that he did
"not simply await advice on the

[recruiting J matter." In fact,
Lyman actually rejected the ad
vice from his own Committee on
Student Services which had given
him an "unfavorable" recommen
dation on the recruiting issue.
As Lyman clearly realizes, his
power to make institutional deci
sions flows from and is circum
scribed by those who control the
purse strings — the corporate
interests. The Trustees, as major
industrialists, have been quite
influential in charting Stanford's
course, particularly in the areas of
land use, recruiting and research
policies. Ralph Keller, director of
the Stanford Placement Center,
testified to the existence of
corporate influence upon Stan
ford decision-making processes in
a May 20, 1971 memorandum to
the Committee on Student Ser
vices, stating, "Another issue
evolves for consideration which
might be of some importance.
Much of the support for the
School of Engineering and the
Graduate School of Business
comes from organizations in busi
ness and industry which are
among the leading prime defense
contractors." It was no accident
that the Durand Aerospace Build
ing (Aero & Astro) was con
structed with 1.4 million dollars
of Lockheed, Boeing, General

Dynamics and General Electric
money. Richard Lyman himself
did much of the corporate fund
raising for that edifice.
It is clear where Richard
Lyman's power grows out of.
Provided he acts within the
parameters of corporate needs,
the David Packards, Ernie Ar
buckles, and Bill Hewletts will
continue to supply the finances
