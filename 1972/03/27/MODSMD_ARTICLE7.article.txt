## Now, If Every Chinese Had A Car... 
### 
Now that the People's Republic
of China has been admitted to the
United Nations and American
leaders are jetting to Peking, it is
inevitable that we will be hearing
more proposals for trade and aid
to help the Chinese bring them
selves up to "our standard of
living." The idea of helping less
developed nations "industrialize"
or "catch up" seems as American
as baseball.
Few people question the com
mon wisdom behind these pro
grams, the idea that the develop
ing areas of the world can
somehow catch up with contem
porary consumptive standards of

living in industrial societies.
The emergence of China as a
needy superpower must surely
generate a re-evaluation of these
beliefs. First, it is doubtful that
the Chinese will ever reach our
current standard of living; indeed
it is not certain that this is even
possible. But, more important, it
is questionable whether such an
achievement would be desirable,
from any point of view.

If the level of industrialization
in China could be increased to the
point that each Chinese family
possessed an automobile and
other amenities of industrial socie
ty, the effect on China and the
entire world would be catastroph
ic.
This observation immediately
raises the point, of course, that
the U.S. should be considered
overdeveloped by virtue of having
attained a level of per capita
consumption far in excess of that
to which the bulk of humanity
can realistically aspire.
Some very basic figures shed
light on the development dilem
ma. There are currently at least
750 million people in mainland
China. By contrast, the popula
tion of the United States is lightly
over 200 million. Since there are
more than 3.5 Chinese for every
American, it would require some
3.5 times the present United
States resources consumption to
sustain China at current American

levels.
Such affluence in China would
necessitate a tremendous shift in
world consumption of raw materi
als.
Energy consumption is the best
summary measure of industrial
sophistication, and per capita
energy consumption is indicative
of average individual environmen
tal impact. The world currently
consumes 6.5 billion metric tons
of coal equivalent in energy each
year. The United States uses 2.2
billion metric tons equivalent or
one-third of total world consump
tion.
The Chinese, on the other
hand, consume less than 400
million metric tons equivalent. In
per capita terms, each person in
China is supported by the con
sumption of less than 500 kilo

grams of coal equivalent, while his
American counterpart is support
ed by some 11,000. Roughly
speaking, twenty-two times as
much energy is used to sustain an
American as to sustain one citizen
of China.
An "Americanized" China
would consume nearly eight bil
lion metric tons of coal equivalent
in energy each year, more than
the present total world consump
tion. To the extent that energy
consumption is a reasonable index
of environmental impact, these
numbers mean that raising
Chinese energy consumption to
the American level would amount
to doubling the environmental
impact of homo sapiens.

These figures, and similar ones

that could be calculated for other
less developed nations, indicate
that it is imperative that the
United States reassess policies
predicated on the assumption that
those nations can and should
"catch up."
The industrial nations really
have two choices. They can
continue their present course of
devouring more and more of the
earth's resources while destroying
the environment. In the process
there will be little substantial
improvement in the lot of the
poor nations, and in the not-too
distant future, a catastrophic
reduction in the capacity of the
planet ot support human life. In
short, the greed of the few will
lead to disaster for all.
The second choice would be for
the industrial nations to deal with

their own overpopulation and
overconsumption. They could
face up to the ecological unity of
planet Earth and to the ways in
which they destinies are inter
twined with those of the poor
nations.
By establishing a high quality
life instead of a high quantity life
they could provide a new kind of
model for the developing nations
to emulate.
Simultaneously they could
begin a massive transfer of wealth
to the poor nations so that
poverty could be reduced substan
tially without destroying our
planet in thy process.
