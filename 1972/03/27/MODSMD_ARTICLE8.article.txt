Farmers?
Editor, THE DAILY:
My suggestion for the team
name is the Stanford Farmers.

Cowboys?
Editor, THE DAILY:
How about using the same
"Cowboys" instead of Indians, so
the teams will be known as the
Stanford Cowboys instead of the
Stanford Indians?
The Cowboys always won,
anyway, except for the game lost
by the Custer team.

Pigs?
Editor, THE DAILY:
Now that Stanford has
abolished the Indian symbol I
would like to recommend the one
that would be perfect.
This is the Pig because even

more than at Columbia and
Berkeley, nowhere has the hippie
pig influence of acting like pigs,
talking like pigs, and dressing like
pigs been more eagerly accepted
than at Stanford.
In the words of the hippie pigs
so copied at Stanford to show off
how "sophisticated" and racist in
favor of the black race they are,
"Hey, man. That's telling it like it
is, man. Groovy. Right on, man."
Doesn't it sound perfect? The
Stanford Pigs.
As a second choice, how about
the Stanford Oswalds: Since the
political philosophy and racism of
90% of the Stanford student body
is exactly the same as Lee Harvey
Oswald's, this nick-name would be
almost as appropriate as the pig
for if Oswald were alive today he
would be in the forefront of
demonstrations in support of the
Communist aggression in South
Vietnam, in support of the black
racist and racism in favor of the
black race, in support of and the
glorification of Mao, at Stanford
especially.

Wasp?
Editor, THE DAILY:
Now that our university has
been bereft of its ancient and
honorable mascot, the Indian, I
suggest as our new totem that
patient and persistent insect, the
wasp.
Many, indeed, are its virtues.
The mother wasp toils ceaselessly
to provide her children with food;
the wasp nest is always
scrupulously neat and clean;
wasps never attack each other,
only outsiders, and then only
under extreme provocation (but
when such self-defense becomes

necessary, it is conducted in a
memorable fashion).
Last and by no means least, the
wasp's extraordinary skills as
designer and builder are
reminiscent of those of that
supernal Stanfordite, THE
GREAT ENGINEER!

Quislings?
Editor, THE DAILY:
I cannot comprehend the
Stanford Student Senate's
decision to terminate the use of
the Stanford Indian Symbol. The
spirit in which this symbol was

used added nothing but honor and
respect to the American Indian.
To agree to eliminate this
symbol only adds credibility to
the claims of the few that contend
this is in disrespect to their race.
It is time we realize there are
some among us who are bent on
destruction; destruction of the
University's physical plant, and
destruction of its traditions and
ideals. Those lending their support
to this direction are mere
"Quislings" for the destroyers.
They are traitors to the trust
which has been given them to
preserve and maintain the
traditions and ideals which at one

time gave Stanford the respect of
a great University. I say it is time
for the Stanford Family to act
like grown men and women.
To some this may not be a big
thing; but to me the principle and
direction are.

Stanford - class 1937
Editor, THE DAILY:
We would like to make a
recommendation for an
alternative name for the Stanford
mascot. Since we can no longer be
the Indians, and since "Cardinals"
is already an overused name in
this country (as well as being

uninspiring), we would like to
suggest that all teams be called
"The Stanford Grapes."
This name is particularly
appropriate in view of Stanford's
location close to the heart of the
Santa Clara grape and wine
country. Team colors would not
have to be changed, since wine
grapes, as well as grape products,
are red.
Think of the spellouts at
football games! Third, the grape
has been the symbol of man's
fruitful work and its rewards for
ages. Also, the grape bunch
symbolizes fellowship and
teamwork. Finally, the name
"Grapes" would give Stanford a
unique status among American
university teams.
