# CJP Decision In Placement Center Case
## 
### 
THE FACTS
This is the case of what has been called the "Place
ment Center Four." The report of the hearing officer
found that all four defendants, among others not identi
fied, had, in the words of the hearing officer:
"intentionally intruded upon and refused to leave a
scheduled private interview at the Placement Center
between Mr. Burnell, the representative of the TRW
Corporation and Duane Lisenbardt, then a registered
student at Stanford University. Each defendant there
by intentionally prevented the effective carrying out
of that conference."
The facts have been set out for us in considerable
detail in the report of the hearing officer and in any
event, do not seem to be in great dispute. The questions
for us are questions of law and of the appropriate
sanction.
Although the hearing officer recommended a finding
that the defendants had been guilty of a disruption
within the meaning of the Policy on Campus Disruption,
we must examine that recommendation afresh, basing
our decision, however, upon the facts as found by the
hearing officer. Although the hearing officer does make
a recommendation to us, it would be wrong even to
regard that recommendation as establishing a presump
tion of correctness. The issues of law are for us, and we
must decide the questions presented by the defendants,
uninfluenced by the hearing officer's recommendations.
The defendants, in their briefs, make two arguments,
each of which is fairly complex. Both rely on the fact
that TRW is involved in "war-related" work in the sense
that that corporation, under contract with the United
States Government, has produced and is producing mate
rial which aids the government in fighting the war on the
Indochinese peninsula. There is no dispute about these
facts. It is the relevance of these facts which will be at
issue in the ensuing discussion.
"UNIVERSITY FUNCTION"
The first of the defendants' arguments is based upon
the wording of the disruption policy which they were
charged with violating. That policy reads:
"It is a violation of University policy for a member of
the faculty, staff, or student body to 1) prevent or
disrupt the effective carrying out of a university func
tion or approved activity, such as lectures, meetings,
interviews, ceremonies...."
Defendants first argue that "University function or
approved activity" means authorized University function
or approved activity, and that there was no evidence
introduced before the hearing officer that the interview
disrupted by the defendants was authorized at the Uni
versity. Of course, whether a placement interview is an
authorized University function within the Disruption
Policy is not a question of fact, but rather one of law for
us. As a result, there was no need to introduce evidence
on this issue before the hearing officer. (Actually, the
prosecution, in an excess of caution, did introduce evi
dence on the matter, but the hearing officer, quite
properly, did not admit it on the ground that it was
irrelevant to her function.)
The question of whether placement interviews, in
general, are authorized University functions within the
Disruption Policy has been put forth by defendants.
Nonetheless, we do not find it a difficult one. The
Disruption Policy itself gives examples of a "University
function or approved activity" and these include "inter
views." (Actually, the distinction between "University
function" and "approved activity" was drawn to protect
from disruption not only such events as classes, examina
tions, and interviews, which are "university functions,"
but also meetings of student organizations which though
not "university functions" were nonetheless "approved
activities.") Entirely apart from the specific example
given in the Disruption Policy, the presumption is fairly
strong that placement interviews are an authorized Uni
versity function. After all, for many years they have
taken place in a University building; and the placement
officials are paid by the University. Defendants' argu
ment that placement, recruiting, or setting up interviews,
in general, is an unauthorized function is more than we
can accept.
"WAR RELATED" RECRUITING
This, however, is not the defendants' major argument
on the "University function" issue. Their major argu
ment is that the placement recruiting by a "war-related"
prospective employer is not an authorized University
function. There are two grounds defendants put forth to
sustain this position. First is essentially a moral ground.
This argument is similar to, though somewhat different
from, the justification defense discussed below. How
ever, it argues not that the defendants were justified in
disrupting the interview by the "war-related" recruiter
but rather that the University was unjustified in permit
ting the interview to begin with, and hence that the
interview in question was not within the Disruption
Policy. Under this argument, the lack of authorization of
the interview is determined by international law and/or
as a moral matter and hence would exist regardless of
any decision to allow such recruiting made by the stu
dents, faculty, administration, or whatever group held
the legitimate authority to decide this issue.
The crux of the defendants' argument is basically that
the Vietnam war is illegal and that the company whose
interview was disrupted was involved in that illegality
and that, therefore, they could not be "authorized" to
recruit on campus. Although this argument is broader
than the justification defense, it depends on the same
line of reasoning. We will consider it in greater detail in
discussing that defense. At this point all we need say is
that for the reasons we discuss below, we must reject
this argument.
THE REFERENDUM
The defendants argue next, and this is their major
contention on the "University function" issue, that a
student referendum had rendered the recruiting of war
related companies such as TRW, unauthorized.
The argument of the defendants is:
"the student body has expressed its wish that it does
not want war-related recruiting and that the applic
able policy on who may use campus facilities to
recruit is determined not by the pronouncements of
Richard Lyman, but by the pronouncements of the
students."

This is obviously a reference to the student referen
dum of April 19, 1971. That referendum reads:
"1, As a member of the Stanford University commun
ity, 1 choose to change the present policy on military
and corporate recruiting. . . .
2, To prohibit the use of Stanford lands by corpora
tions that are directly producing material and re
search for the military. 'Directly producing' to be
defined by a joint committee of three elective repre
sentatives from the faculty Senate, three elected rep
resentatives from the ASSU Senate, three representa
tives from the Stanford staff at large which will make
its decision no later than May 25, 1971
The "directly producing" section of this referendum
passed by a margin of 1768 to 1596.
It seems to us that this referendum does not help
establish defendants' case. First, it acknowledges that, at
the time of the referendum, "war-related" recruitment
was authorized on the campus. Secondly, the referen
dum does not, in and of itself, purport to exercise any
power to change that state of affairs. Rather than being
a flat statement, "we change the rule," it is phrased in
terms of individual students saying "1 choose. .. No
enactment intending to exert a specific political power
to make or change a rule begins that way.
Rather the referendum was obviously intended as one
step in a fairly long process which would later lead to
the changing of the rule. Among the reasons for this was
the difficulty in defining "directly producing," a matter
addressed directly by the referendum. The fact that,
rather than attempting itself to define "directly produc
ing" or leave it to some judicial body or to the Student
Senate to define, the referendum attempted to set up a
committee to determine what the words meant, strongly
indicates that the bar on certain kinds of recruiting was
not intended to take force until this was done.
Interestingly, the Student Senate did not elect the
representatives as provided in the referendum; neither
did the Faculty Senate, nor the staff at large. Instead,
the matter was turned over to the Committee on Stu
dent Services—in which students do hold the majority,
and this year (though after the actions giving rise to the
present case) the Committee on Student Services voted 5
to 4 not to recommend the prohibition of "war-related"
recruiting on campus.
Accordingly, we find that this referendum which de
fendants allege stripped "war-related" recruiting of its
University authorization was not intended to do and did
not do this. The prosecution would have us go further
and hold that even if the students had intended to
exercise such a power then and there to prevent this
kind of recruiting, they simply did not have that kind of
power. As a technical matter, the University is correct in
stating:
"However much the defendants may wish their asser
tion to be the case, they are simply incorrect. Section
4 of the Founding Grant of this University vests in
the Trustees the power and duty to 'manage and
control the institution hereby founded' and 'to man
age and control the trust property, care for and;
improve the same, operate or lease it, and apply the
net proceeds or profits thereof to the purposes of the
trust hereby created' and 'to make bylaws not incon
sistent with the laws of this state or the purposes of
this Grant for the government of the institution here
by founded,' and 'to make rules and regulations for
the management of the trust property' (see Attach
ment 1). The bylaws of the Board of Trustees state in
Section 5.01 of Article 5 that 'the President of the
University shall be appointed or removed only by the
affirmative vote of not fewer than 12 trustees; in
addition to his duties set forth in the Founding Grant
he shall be responsible for the management of the
University and all its departments, including the oper
ation of the physical plant and the administration of
the University's business activities.'
It is, therefore, in fact the President of Stanford
University who establishes the policy at the Stanford
Career Planning and Placement Center."
In this case, however we need not rely on what many
students regard as an unpleasant truth. We are convinced
that even if the student body held the power which
defendants claim, that body did not use it in a way that
benefits defendants' case.
JUSTIFICATION
Holding, then, as we do, that the recruiting attempted
to be carried out at the Placement Center which was
disrupted by these defendants was within the disruption
policy, we come now to the defendants' next and main
defense-justification.
Defendants spend considerable effort in their brief
arguing that justification should be a complete defense
(as distinguished from merely a mitigating factor) in the
law governing Stanford University. It is true that neither
federal nor California law recognizes a general justifica
tion defense—though, of course, a justification defense
has been recognized by case law or statute in specific
situations such as apprehension of fleeing felons or de
fense of life or property. Nonetheless, the modern trend
has been to allow a general defense, and we agree with
defendants that justification, if it exists, is an appro
priate defense before the CJP. Moreover, we agree with
the defense contention that "under some circumstances
action that would normally come under the disruption
policy is simply not a violation of that policy."
The classic examples of the justification defense usu
ally given in criminal law involve the right to drive
through a red light, in violation of the law, if it is
otherwise safe to do so and if one is on the way to the
hospital with an emergency patient. Presumably, in the
University, one would also have the right to disturb the
peace and disrupt a University function by crying "fire,"
if this were to empty a building which was in fact on
fire.
The prosecution indeed agrees that a justification
defense should exist in University law. The problem is,
of course, whether the justification defense is applicable
to this case, and it is this issue to which we must direct
attention.
The problem of setting down standards for precisely
when a justification defense is and when it is not proper
is an enormously complicated one. No verbal standards
set down in advance seem quite to cover all of the cases
without including too much. As a result, instead of
attempting to lay down a statute which is, first, not our
job and, second, beyond our competence- we will at
tempt to decide this case on its particular facts and

determine whether, regardless of how other cases would
be treated, a justification defense should be recognized
here.
The first aspect of a justification defense is that the
defendant arguing it must himself act under that justifi
cation. Until evidence of this is produced, the defense is
simply not part of the case. With respect to these defen
dants, we do have a problem because they exercised
their right not to testify before the hearing examiner—
thus leaving no evidence of their own justified state of
mind in the record. We are prepared to ignore this
technical defect in the defendants' case, since it is obvi
ous from the motivational statement submitted to us
that they do feel justified in their actions. We point this
out, however, to give notice that in future cases,should
justification defenses be raised, there must be either a
concession by the prosecution or testimony on the de
fendants' state of mind which the prosecution can cross
examine before we can consider a justification defense.
The real issue here, however, is not what the defen
dants thought. It is clear to us that they considered
themselves justified. In the last analysis, however, the
issue is whether this Panel thinks they are justified. This
question is hardly free from difficulty. We must remem
ber that justification, if it exists, is a complete defense
(as distinguished from mitigation, which we discuss
later).
Where an act comes within a justification defense,
society says to the defendant "You did the right thing.
You had a choice between two evils (going through a red
light, on the one hand, and delaying emergency treat
ment of a seriously injured person, on the other; disturb
ing the peace, on the one hand, or allowing people in a
building to be burned to death, on the other) and you
chose correctly." We cannot say that here.
Perhaps the simplest reason to deny the defendants'
justification defense under the facts here is that the
nexus between what they attempted to prevent and
what they did is not nearly close enough. The defen
dants did indeed successfully disrupt an interview at
Stanford. Yet the next logical question, "did they there
fore stop the war?" is so absurd that it cannot even be
posed seriously. This indicates the insufficiency of the
nexus. Note that a parallel question, asked of the driver
who went through the red light with the emergency
patient, would not be at all inappropriate.
We will, however, not rest with this short an answer;
we grant the following factual elements in the offered
justification: the defendants did wish to prevent, or at
least make less likely, the employment of persons in the
manufacture of weapons to be used in the war in Indo
china; they believed the war to be illegal, undesirable,
and evil, and that even an indirect contribution to it was
a violation of international law; they considered it to be
desirable and proper to prevent or inhibit what they
considered to be violations of international law; they felt
that preventing or inhibiting the above described em
ployment prevented or inhibited a violation of interna
tional law; and they felt that therefore, it was more
desirable to prevent or make less likely this kind of
employment than to maintain the order and respect for
the rights of others protected by the University Policy
on Disruption.
What must be compared, however, is not the "killing
in Asia" as opposed to a few minutes inconvenience to a
few persons at Stanford, but something far more com
plex. We must balance the likelihood of significantly
inhibiting the war in Asia, multiplied by the value of
doing so, against a similar product of probability and
value assessments involving the effects at Stanford of the
defendants' actions. In other words, we must make a
judgment both as to the likelihood of defendants' acts
(if unpunished) contributing significantly, not only to
the temporary annoyance of individuals, but, more seri
ously, to a condition of insecurity and instability on the
campus, resulting from a successful demonstration that
coercion can freely be used to obstruct the activities of
others, and the utility, or rather disutility, of this state
of affairs. We recognize that we give and can give here
only a brief outline of a fully reasoned assessment of
these variables. But we submit that, even granting as
appropriate, and figuring in, a highly passionate condem
nation of the Vietnam war, the defendants' acts are not
justified.
Another way of looking at the matter is in terms of
right and wrong, both legal and moral. Viewed from this
vantage, it is a fallacy to see the issue as a trivial
interference with the rights of others (under one legal
standard) vs. complicity in murder (under another, over
riding standard). This would be simply to repeat, in
different terms, the error pointed to above. Bad as the
Vietnam war may be, the defendants did very little to
stop it in this case, and the wrong of denying an indivi
dual student's rights in our own community is compoun
ded by the inescapable challenge which that denial con
stitutes (even if the challenge is unintended) to the rights
of everyone.
THE FIVE-STEP ARGUMENT
Put another way, the defense asks five things of us:
first, that we accept international law as the binding law
at Stanford; second, that we agree that this law makes
the United States presence- as opposed to some of its
actions-in Vietnam, illegal; third, that we hold any
person or corporation contributing to the Vietnam war
is thereby breaking the law; fourth, that we find that
any recruiting of employees by such a corporation as
TRW which produces substantial amounts of materials
used in the Vietnam war is also illegal; and fifth, that we
conclude that the defendants are legally justified in
physically preventing such recruiting on campus. We
cannot accept any step of the five-step argument.
As to the first step, some of us on this Panel wish that
international law were the controlling law of this coun
try. But, in fact, it is not, and our pretending it is would
not make it so. There is not a tribunal in the United
States that has made a single judgment justifying any
conduct because of the precedence of international law
on the Vietnam issue over domestic law, and for us to
assume such precedence would be to lay aside our re
sponsibility to provide this community with a judicial
institution such as any community must have. The fact
is that international law is very different from a nation's
domestic law. It is binding more morally than legally ■
and has been recognized as controlling within nations
only with respect to a relatively few, technical areas,
none of which is relevant here.
The second of defendants' five steps must also fail.
The illegality, as opposed to the immorality, wasteful
ness or stupidity of the U.S. presence in Vietnam is

Space paid for by News and Publications
simply not as clear as the defendants assert. The fact is
that this is a Constitutional matter of great difficulty,
about which considerable dispute has been raised. So far
as we can tell, a majority of American legal scholars who
have discussed the issue have not held that the Vietnam
war is illegal.
Third, we cannot agree that any person or corpora
tion contributing to the Vietnam war thereby becomes a
criminal. Even in the Nuremberg trials, ordinary soldiers
and industrial employees were not deemed guilty of any
crime for their aid in an illegal war. And those who
supplied war material to what was a government with
vastly less claim to legitimacy than our own were not
held liable for this (though some were, of course, convic
ted of their own violations, such as using slave labor).
The fact is that in one way or another any person or
organization that pays its federal taxes is regrettably
helping the Vietnam war. We do not feel that they are
criminals for this.
Indeed, the consequences of holding that all those
who aid a war illegal under international law are them
selves criminals fortify us in rejecting the previous step
and refusing here to hold the Vietnam war illegal. Under
defendants' reasoning the consequences of a declaration
that the war is illegal to one who aided the Vietnam war
would be so serious that he would be entitled to argue
before us that the war was legal. We would then have to
extend to him the same rights which defendants here
have enjoyed— a right to cross-examine witnesses on all
issues essential to their guilt; a right to present evidence
in their own behalf and a right to move to disqualify any
members of this body who were biased against him. The
inability of our procedures to afford such rights to those
who directly or indirectly have aided the Vietnam war is
a very good reason to stay out of the area altogether.
Fourth, even if all contributions to the Vietnam war
by a corporation were criminal, this would not mean
that all their recruiting of employees would be criminal
as well. One problem with this step is that the armed
forces do other tilings besides fight in Vietnam, and
industrial suppliers, including TRW, do many other
things than supply the armed forces. This part of the
defendants' argument would be stronger if the recruiter
for TRW had been attempting to recruit Mr. Lisenbardt
specifically for the purpose of aiding in the violation of
law, or indeed for work in a division which produced
"war-related" materials.
On the facts of this case, however, there is no indica
tion that the student whose interview was disrupted was
being recruited for any part of the corporation which
did any war-related work. Indeed, the student, Mr.
Lisenbardt, testified without contradiction that he
would not work in "a munitions factory" and that he
wanted to find out for himself the company's role in the
Vietnam war.
The defendants' reasoning allows one to disrupt not
only the interview between TRW and Mr. Lisenbardt,
but also between a "war-related" conglomerate and a
professor who wishes to write a book for a publishing
subsidiary of that corporation.
Finally, even if the "war-related" company's recruit
ing of potential employees is criminal, regardless of what
the employees were to do, this would not allow the
defendants to use self help and appoint themselves to
enforce the law. One is not necessarily justified in com
mitting an illegal act just to prevent another illegal act
even where the nexus is close. We would still have to
balance then the good that the defendants had done
against the harm including the damage on a University
campus caused by ignoring process-the right of consti
tuted authority to make decisions, even when they may
be wrong.
We must remember that the defendants' reasoning on
this point extends far beyond the Vietnam war. The
Vietnam war is not the only allegedly illegal and immor
al activity to which corporate interviewers have been
known to contribute. The Placement Office has played
host to despoilers of the environment, anti-trust viola
tors, manufacturers of unsafe automobiles and presum
ably other violators of legal and moral rules. If the
defendants can disrupt the interviews of Vietnam "war
criminals" others can disrupt those of polluters, and
anyone else who violates what they consider to be a
moral principle. It is clear that we cannot tolerate this
state of affairs on the campus.
FREEDOM TO ACCESS OF INFORMATION
The final reason why we must reject defendants'
justification defense is that the sanction which defend
ants claim they were justified in administering to the
offending company, and incidentally to the Stanford
student in question, violated one of the University's
most cherished values-freedom of access to informa
tion. Even if we would accept defendants'justification
defense in the outside society, we would not allow it in a
University. The fact is that recruiting is a kind of speech.
The student, Mr. Lisenbardt, testified that he just wan
ted to discuss with the company's representatives the
involvement of the recruiting company in the Vietnam
war and only if he were satisfied as to this would he
consider employment. A University community that val
ues free speech and inquiry as supreme values, so long as
they fall short of incitement, cannot and will not hold
that the defendants were justified in preventing the
discussion at the placement office.
There is one further argument or justification that
may be made on behalf of the students. It points out
that they had tried to persuade others to their view
through less disruptive means such as picketing and
political action-indeed they had a degree of success in
the referendum discussed earlier-and that disruptions
such as this were the least disruptive means of gaining
their end of stopping the "war-related" recruiting. This
view takes as given that defendants must be permitted to
gain their ends. The problem is that this is not so. Even
if the defendants are right in asserting that their course is
the wisest and most moral course for the University,
living in a civilized society implies that one may lose as
well as win arguments, and that one must play by the
rules, even if one loses when one should win. Of course,
there may come a time when as should have happened
more often in Nazi Germany one must say he will not
abide by the rules and hence declare war on the system.
Unlike Nazi Germany, both our society and the Univer
sity allow such a degree of free speech, and the outside,
controlling society allows such free elections, that the
analogy of Nazi Germany is strained beyond recognition
in this case.
