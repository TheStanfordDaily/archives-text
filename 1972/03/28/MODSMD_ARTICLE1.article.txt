# Workers Vote April 19 In NLRB Runoff Ballot
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
University workers will make a final
decision on collective bargaining April
19 when they go to the polls to choose
between the Teamsters Union and no
union at all.
Brad Wells of the San Francisco
office of the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) announced yesterday
that all parties in the initial March 7
election had agreed to set aside 187
challenged ballots.
Wells said that it could have taken
over a year to decide which ballots
were valid, but the three unions
involved in the election—Teamsters,
United Stanford Employees (USE) and
California School Employees
Association-Stanford Employees
Association (CSEA-SEA)—agreed with
the University administration to drop
all the disputed ballots from
consideration.
The agreement meant that the
Teamsters, who won 345 votes in the
March election, would move into a
runoff election with the "no union"
option, which led the ballot with 483.
USE received 268 votes, CSEA-SEA
197, and the defunct Workers Action
Caucus one.
Same Time, Place
Wells said the new election, which
involves 1600 workers, will be
conducted exactly as the last one was,
with voting at the same places and
times.
While all parties to the last election
technically had to agree to eliminate
the challenge ballots—votes cast by

employees who felt they should be
part of the voting unit although the
University said they weren't—the
decision was more or less up to USE,
which was virtually the only group
that stood to gain anything if the votes
were accepted.
Nearly everyone agreed that
chances that the challenge ballots
would lift CSEA-SEA into the runoff
were minimal.
And, according to USE president
Jim Berk, it soon became apparent
that the chances of USE profiting
from the ballots were equally small.
Zero Chance
"We felt that the mathematical
probability was approaching zero that
we would replace the Teamsters on the
ballot," Berk explained. "Particularly
when the NLRB indicated that it
would not accept ballots of computer
personnel.
"It seemed like it was in the
interests of the workers to go into the
runoff right away. Putting off the
runoff was only putting off any future
election," Berk continued. NLRB
regulations say that there must be at
least one year between elections in a
voting unit.
"We had five minutes to reach a
decision when the ballots were
counted in San Francisco on March 8,
and we weren't allowed to consult
with anyone," Berk said. "So at that
time, we decided to make an issue of
the challenged ballots. But later on,
when we consulted with our attorneys
we decided that it was unlikely that
we would overtake the Teamsters."

Berk said his union hasn't decided
whose side to take in the runoff
election, and probably won't
announce anything until the last week
of the campaign. "We'll want to dig
behind the glossy front of their
[Teamsters] statements first," he said.
Steve Cardoza, a member of the
Teamsters Stanford Organizing
Committee, said that his organization
hasn't made any firm plans as to the
direction the campaign will take.
"We've all tried to take it easy for the
last couple of weeks," Cardoza said.
"But we'll get back to work now that
the decision is in. We should figure it
out in the next couple of days."
