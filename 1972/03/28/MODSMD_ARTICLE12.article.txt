# The 						Best Films Of All Time
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Every ten years the British film
quarterly "Sight and Sound"
consults a comprehensive
cross-section of the world's film
critics to determine a list of the
greatest films of all time. Most
critics agree that making such a
list is next to impossible but at
the same time, most critics enjoy
playing the "Top Ten Game," as
it is called, if only to express the
occasional perversities of their
affections through the subjectivity
of their choices.
In its current winter issue,
"Sight and Sound" admits the
impossibility of naming the
"best" of anything and most of
the critics toss any pretense of
objectivity out the window and
blatantly list their personal
favorites, often "the ten films I
can least do without today," "A
strictly emotional list with no
regard for historical significance"
or "Not the greatest, but those I
could least bear never to see again

— at the moment. All change next
week." One or two critics even
dated their lists — "October 11,
1971, 4 p.m.. .. two days later or
one hour earlier my choice could
have been other."
In all, 89 critics are represented
in the poll, including all the major
British critics, a decent
cross-section of the establishment
and semi-underground press in the
United States and the principal
critics of Italy, France, Sweden
and Denmark, with the rest
reporting in from such distant
points as Japan, India, South
America, Poland, Ceylon, Turkey,
Romania and Israel. No
nationalistic or even continental
patterns emerge from the lists
and, if any conclusions can be
drawn, it is that in the face of the
so-called New Cinema of the late
fifties and sixties, most critics still
reserve their ultimate accolades
for the established masters. The
only sixties films included on the
top ten are by Fellini and

Bergman, who can hardly qualify
as newcomers.
Before I forget, here's the list,
with the number of total
mentions each film received noted
afterwards:
Citizen Kane 32
(Welles, 1941)
Rules of the Game 28
(Renoir, 1939)
Battleship Potemkin 16
(Eisenstein, 1925)
B>A 15
(Fellini, 1963)
L'Avventura 12
(Antonioni, I960)
Persona - 12
(Bergman, 1967)
The Passion of Joan of Arc 11
(Dreyer, 1928)
The General 10
(Keaton/Bruckman, 1926)
The Magnificent Amber sons 10
(Welles, 1942)
Ugetsu Monogatari 9
(Mizoguchi, 1953)
Wild Strawberries 9
(Bergman, 1957)
Runners-up, with eight and
seven votes apiece, include
Chaplin's "The Gold Rush,"
Resnais' "Hiroshima Mon
Amour," Kurosawa's "Ikiru,"
Eisenstein's "Ivan the Terrible,"
Godard's "Pierrot le Fou,"
Hitchcock's "Vertigo," Renoir's
"Grand Illusion," Bresson's
"Mouchette," Ford's "The
Searchers," Murnau's "Sunrise,"
Kubrick's "2001: A Space
Odyssey" and Bunuel's
"Viridiana."
Extrapolating from the
compiled lists, the top directors of
all time are Orson Welles, Jean
Renoir, Ingmar Bergman, Luis
Bunuel, Sergei Risenstein, John
Ford, Jean-Luc Godard, Buster
Keaton, Federico Fellini,
Michelangelo Antonioni, Charles
Chaplin and Carl Dreyer.
"Citizen Kane" also topped the
1962 list, on which
"L'Avventura" placed second and
which also included such present
absentees as "Greed," "Ivan," "La
Terra Trema," "L'Atalante" and
"Bicycle Thieves," which was
number one in 1952. Writes
"Sight and Sound." "The most
potent word in the cinema, it
seems, is still Rosebud."
Subjective Endeavor
I have toyed with the notion of
an all time Top Ten for a couple
of years now and can testify to
other critics' claims that the
endeavor can only be subjective, is
impulsively tentative but is rather
fun as well. For the most part, I
find myself listing my favorite
directors as opposed to absolute
favorite films. For instance, while
there are several Keaton films I
love just as much as "The
Navigator," I prefer listing just
"The Navigator" in order to make
way for other great directors
rather than loading the list with

other exemplary Keaton films.
At the moment, I most regret
that on a list limited to ten there
is no room for the sublime work
of Lubitsch ("Lady Windermere's
Fan," "Design for Living"),
Godard ("Contempt," "Pierrot le
Fou") and the Marx Brothers
("Duck Soup").
I enjoy seeing all these films
repeatedly and in many cases try
to see them once a year (in the
case of "Citizen Kane" and
"Touch of Evil," perhaps twice
that). For all the academic and
historical importance of
something like "Potemkin" or
"Intolerance," I really can't sit
through them more than once or
twice.
Controlled more than anything
by my precarious emotional state
at the moment, I submit a list of
my favorite films of all time:
Children of Paradise (Carne,
1945)
Citizen Kane
The Navigator (Kea ton/Crisp,
1924)
The Devil Is a Woman (Von
Sternberg, 1935)
The Crime of M. Lange
(Renoir, 1935)
Touch of Evil (Welles, 1958)
My Darling Clementine (Ford,
1946)
Shoot the Piano Player
(Truffaut, I960)
Sullivan's Travels (Sturges,
1942)
Casablanca (Curtiz, 1942)
I asked Stanford's celebrated
resident film fanatic Clive T.
Miller for his list and he
immediately admitted his
difficulty in reconciling his
personal favorites with what he
objectively considers great. Once
he had pared his list down to 35
he felt he could go no further but
ultimately opted for the films he
"feels closest to." Clive made a
point of not including his two
favorite movies, "Casablanca" and
Minnelli's "Meet Me in St. Louis,"
nor Keaton's silent "Our
Hospitality."
Miller's List
Rules of the Game
Citizen Kane
The Lady Eve (Sturges, 1941)
VAvventura
North by Northwest
(Hitchcock, 1959)
YojirAbo (Kurosawa, 1961)
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
(Mamoulian, 1932)
Swing Time (Stevens, 1936)
for dancing and/or The Gay
Divorcee (Sandrich, 1934) for
story
Duck Soup (McCarey, 1933)
Smiles of a Summer Night
(Bergman, 1955)
Clive also chose the greatest
director of all time (Jean Renoir),
the best actor (Laurence Olivier)
and actress (Bette Davis, from
1938-42).


CITIZEN WELLES—In the British film magazine "Sight and
Sound" 's recent poll to determine the greatest films of all time,
"Citizen Kane" was adjudged the number one film and Orson Welles
(above) was named as the greatest director. Welles' "The Magnificent
Ambersons" also made the top ten. As if this were not enough,
"Citizen Kane" also made the lists of Stanford film fanatics Todd
McCarthy and Clive Miller.
