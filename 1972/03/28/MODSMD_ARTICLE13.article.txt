## The 						Music Hasn't Died

It is a remarkable achievement for any musician
to overcome the incredible problems involved in
performing at the Santa Clara County Fairgrounds
Exposition Hall, an old, cement-floored, airplane
hangar type of a building whose lack of comfort is
matched only by its acoustical inadequacies.
A Savoy-Brown-Fleetwood Mac concert of a few
weeks ago typified the problems involved with
concerts there. With the stage placed at one end of
this very thin, rectangular hall, anyone sitting more
than halfway back from the stage enjoyed a visual
sensation which was analagous to observing the
occupants of an ant farm.
The tunnel effect of placing the stage at one end
of the hangar predictably leads to some major sound
variations in different parts of the hall. Add to this
an audience which includes morons such as one guy
behind me who didn't have the sense to take a girl
with him outside for fresh air even after she had
thrown up on the floor more than once and you can
see why I left before Savoy Brown had played their
final note.
So it was with a fair amount of apprehension I
returned to the fairgrounds for another concert a
week ago Saturday night. One valuable physical
change was immediately visible, the stage had been
moved to the side-center of the hall, eliminating
some of the afore-mentioned problems.
Mellower Audience
And as the evening progressed it was obvious that
this audience was much mellower than a typical
fairgrounds crowd. But it was the headline
performer who was to make it a very memorable
night of music. Don McLean is one of those rare
performers who could probably even overcome the
problems of playing on a filled New York City
subway car.
Good old Mr. American Pie gave to what was
unfortunately a relatively small San Jose audience,
one of the finest solo performances I have ever
heard. If anyone still thought that McLean was only
going to be a one-shot artist with his already
legendary "American Pie," this concert made it
clear that McLean is definitely a major musical
figure who ought to rank along with Carole King
and James Taylor as one of the major finds of
American popular music of the last decade.
On the heels of the spectacular success of
"American Pie," two more McLean singles, the
beautiful and sad "Vincent" and the lovely "Winter
Wood," have begun to receive frequent air play.
And those of you who are quite impressed with the
recorded talent of this male Rookie-Of-The-Year in
popular music, will be happy to know his live solo
performance exceeds his recorded output.
Two of the bigger recent finds in the
widely-varied area of light-rock and folk music, have
been England's Elton John and Canada's Gordon
Lightfoot. But McLean and Taylor may very well be
the first major American performers to emerge in
this area since Bob Dylan was revolutionizing folk
music back in the Sixties.
New Style
But it is very unfair to compare McLean to other
folk artists. For in his concert. McLean ably
demonstrated that he has developed a style which is
as new and noteworthy as it is refreshing. He isn't
copying anyone in particular, and hopefully no one
will try to copy him, although it is inevitable that
people will as they always do when someone
achieves success.
Just as actors who achieve instant stardom
through a major role are often typecast, it is very
possible that people will always think of McLean in
terms of "American Pie." And this is unfortunate,
because his talent reaches into far too many areas to
be associated with any one song.

Don Tollefson

Many artists seem to despise such labelling and
avoid at all costs the work which led to the label,
but McLean has not done that. In his concert, he
performed the full "American Pie" as if he
thoroughly enjoyed doing it and would probably
never tire of it.
McLean however did register both a verbal and
sung protest at the incredible number of people who
have attempted to interpret the lyrics of "American
Pie." He criticized specifically radio disc jockeys
who try to set and establish trends, which "people
follow like Pavlov's dogs, because they are Pavlov's
dogs."
Musical Protest
His musical protest was prefaced by a comment
about how the following song would "put lyric
interpretators out of business." McLean then sung
"On The Amazon," an externally nonsensical song
which is a brilliant parody on our words and
language. But unlike some of Dylan's outwardly
non-sensical songs, "On The Amazon" flowed
beautifully through the use of some very creative
rhymes.
The rest of the concert, both before and after his
rendition of his masterpiece, showed the extensive
breadth of McLean's talent. McLean uses an
acoustical guitar on all but two songs in which he
admirably played a banjo. One of those songs
featured a fine display of "pickin' " and the other
was one of the few really likeable songs about Jesus
Freaks which I've heard.
McLean prefaced the Jesus song with remarks
about Billy Graham and when he suggested reading
Graham's column daily, somebody in the audience
asked him why and he cooly replied, "Read it and
find out." McLean was also quite adept at filling the
traditional tuning void with some very good and
very often witty remarks, but he never carried this
to an excess as too many performers do.
McLean moved effortlessly from fast
foot-stomping rockers to more slow and reflective
things such as "Vincent" and "Winter Wood." But
he also showed he could handle broad social satire
through such songs as one about a guy standing on
the White House lawn which takes pokes at all sorts
of Washington heavies.
In the song McLean sings about signing a
ban-the-bomb petition which had already been
signed by "Dean Rusk, General Wastermoreland and
Checkers." He then gets a call from J. Edgar Hoover
who tells him, "I've got you're number," prompting
a statement from McLean about how there are
8,000 Communists in California, 3,000 of whom are
FBI men, and if they left, the party would die. He
adds that "maybe J. Edgar wants to be grand
commisar."
Lack of Humanity
Loneliness, alienation and the lack of humanity
in society are a theme in many of his songs and this
subject is beautifully covered in 'Three Flights Up,"
an incredible song about residents of the different
floors of an apartment house who are each sinking
in their own loneliness and sadness and who still
never reach out to each other.
Regardless of what kind of song he was singing,
McLean always maintained his clear vocal style and
his nearly perfect diction which are supported in
near-flawless fashion by his smooth and often
seemingly-effortless guitar technique.
Two lines from two of his songs typify the talent
and insight which McLean displayed in his music all
night long. In a song about a lonely man looking for
a lover, McLean says, "Maybe I'll find a rich
banker's daughter and do to her what he's done to
us." And near the end of one of his social comment
numbers he says, "if winning is all that matters, I
respect the losers." As long as people like Don
McLean are singing, the music will never die.
