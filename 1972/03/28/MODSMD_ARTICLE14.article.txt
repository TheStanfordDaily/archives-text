# Undefeated Laxmen Edge Golden Gate
## 
### 
The Stanford lacrosse team
remains tied for the lead of the
Northern California Lacrosse As
sociation standings after three
matches of the young season.
The Cards edged Golden Gate
Lacrosse Club 7-6 in San Fran
cisco Saturday to keep a perfect
league record at 3-0.
Also Saturday, Palo Alto
whipped Monterey's Naval Post
graduate School 19-7 at El
Camino Park to keep their league
record at 3-0.
Overtime Victory
In Saturday's Golden Gate
contest, Stanford came from be
hind in the last minute of
regulation play to knot the score
at 6-6. With 55 seconds remaining,
Golden Gate gained possession of
the ball in the Stanford defensive
area and proceeded to stall.
The Stanford defenders em
ployed a hustling double-team
defense that enabled Ned Cham
bers to steal a loose ball at
midfield. Defenseman Chambers
dashed fifty yards downfield be
fore passing off to Chip Loveman.
Loveman fed off to Dave
Sampson, who passed the ball to
Ted Suen behind the Golden Gate
cage. Suen shot an assist pass back
to Loveman who scored the tying
goal, his third of the day for his
second hat trick of the season.
Larry Glenn's midfield shot in
overtime play provided the margin
of victory for Stanford.
Veteran Attack
The lacrosse team enters the

1972 season with all but four
returning players from last year's
team, which posted a 9-5 record
and finished third in the Northern
California Lacrosse Association.
Stanford fields three solid mid
fields and a veteran attack that
has played together for three
years. Coach Bill Eakland con
siders the defense the weakspot of
this year's team, but notes that it
has matured in practice "and
should provide a formidable
threat by the end of the season to
the best of the West Coast
Lacrosse."
Second year player Kem
Ketcham, last years Most Im
proved Player, anchors the de
fense at the crease position. The
bright spot in the defense could
be beginning player (and football
player) Ned Chambers. In the goal
is returning net-keeper, Fred
Choate, who according to Eakland
has periods of erratic play, but
"on occasion has proven the
deciding factor in many of Stan
ford's games".
Stanford plays a tough league
schedule as part of the newly
formed Southern Division
consisting of Palo Alto, the Naval
Post Graduate School, and Golden
Gate. Eakland considers Palo Alto
the pre-season choice for the
league title, and believes the
home-and-home series with Palo
Alto will provide exciting action.
Road Trips
The intercollegiate schedule in
cludes road trips to Oregon and

Los Angeles, and home stands
against UCLA, Arizona, Clare
mont, Utah, and national power
Air Force.
Stanford faces the Air Force
Wednesday in what will be a
tough test. The Falcon team is on
their Spring training tour of
California which also includes
games against Berkeley and several
Los Angeles teams. This game will
be the second straight visit to
Stanford for the Air Force. The
Falcons hold an overall 4-1 edge
in encounters between the two
teams. Last year the Air Force
was 8-4. /
Eakland believes that Stanford
must play an exceptional game in
order to give the Falcons a battle.
The Air Force has won two
straight Rocky Mountain Cham
pionships, representing that region
in the NCAA Championships each
year.
