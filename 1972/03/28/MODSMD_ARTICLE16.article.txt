Editor, THE DAILY:
I noted with interest that last
March 2, 1972 your Student
Senate voted to drop your
school's mascot and symbol, the
Indian, due to pressure from
certain American Indian groups.
The purpose of this
communication is to commend
your group on its fine upstanding
action in doing away with what
some spokesman apparently
referred to as "the somewhat
commercialized and always
somewhat fake representation of
the Indian tradition" (Los Angeles
Times, 3/4/72).
I greatly admired the strength
of character evidenced by your
action. You went right for the
issue, ignoring such irrelevant
factors as your school's forty-two
years of tradition tied up in that
racist mascot. You very lucidly
decided that it was insulting
rather than being simply a
colorful caricature.
The harmfulness of the use of
the mascot is obvious. Why, if you
hadn't done away with it as a
symbol, everybody would have
continued to think, as we all
know they presently do, that all
Indians today wear feathers, war
paint and walk around in loin
cloths and mocassins. Some of my
best friends being Indians, I know
how much the red savages resent
this implication.
Finally, I want to congratulate
you on the seriousness with which
you treated the objections which
led to your doing away with the
name. Some may have thought
such objections were ludicrous
efforts to reach for a wispy issue,
but I can see how serious they
really are. Being of Italian, Irish,
German and French derivation
myself (my family got around), I
know how upset I would be if any
school named their mascot after
my ancestors.
Obviously, such an act would
be intended to subject me and my
family to public scorn and
humiliation and would be
designed to promote a racist
image rather than being just a
reference to a colorful part of
Americana.
As it now stands, I have been
informed that Notre Dame

University has been guilty of this
unforgivable transgression insofar
as my Irish genesis is concerned
and therefore I am considering
bringing a class action it
on this basis in order to further
this serious and noble cause.
Its derogatory use of the
nickname "Irish" is a racial slur
(and I'll fight anyone anytime and
any place to prove it) which must
be rectified in order to protect me
and my family from being
considered as being in any way
different from anybody else.
Insofar as your action evidences
your awareness of our country's
obvious need to all be the same, I
congratulate you on it.
In closing, I just want to
reiterate how much in keeping
with Stanford's high
socio-intellectual standards this
action was. It was in the greatest
tradition of American achromatic
homogeneity.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Concerning the dropping of the
Indian mascot, the tone of the
letters from outside Stanford
seems to be that "those dirty
hippie Commies have destroyed
our cherished tradition again." I
should like to reassure the outside
traditionalists that one need not
be a dirty hippie Commie to favor
the elimination of the Indian
symbol, nor need one sympathize
with the emotional issues raised to
justify its elimination. One need
only believe in the concept of
individual rights, and in the
immorality of violating these
rights.
The argument used most often
in favor of the Indian mascot is
that its use was a compliment to
the Indian, not an instrument of
degradation. Apart from the ob
vious problem of non-Indians
presuming to speak for Indians,
there is the question of a business
enterprise making use of the name
of an individual or a group of
individuals without their permis
sion (the Stanford football team,
after all, is in many respects a
business). The proprietor of a
hamburger stand could not use

my name for business purposes
(e.g., the "Chris Hocker Hambur
ger Stand") without my permis
sion, nor can he justify such
action by claiming that the
hamburgers are of excellent quali
ty and that he meant it as a
compliment. He must ask my
permission; if he does not, I may
sue him.
People tend to forget that the
full name of Stanford athletic
teams has been the Stanford
Indians, not merely "the Indians."
This is not just a picky semantic
point; rather, to use the term
"Stanford Indians" is to use the
ethnic label of all Indians, or
Native Americans, who are at
Stanford. These Native Americans
have requested, unanimously, that
their name not be used. Dropping
the Indian as mascot is not a
matter of emotion, it is a matter
of right.
Those Indians who favor the
retention of the symbol, such as
certain members of the Yurok
tribe and others, are not properly
Stanford Indians. Their opinions
may be interesting, but they have
no bearing on the question of
violation of rights. Those who call
upon tradition to defend the
retention of the mascot are taking
a totally irrationalist position.
This is not to suggest that some of
those who favor dropping the
symbol are not taking an equally
irrational stance, but merely to
point out that there are firm,
objective, rational grounds on
which to favor its elimination.
Chris Hocker
Editor, THE DAILY:
I find the controversy over the
Stanford mascot to be both
absurd and tragic. I am half
Scandinavian-American, yet I have
never felt it necessary to petition
the Minnesota Vikings to change
their mascot. Let's face it though,
that's not a fair comparison.
Scandinavian-Americans are not
treated the same as Indians. To
me, this is the real issue: the
situation of the American Indian
of today!
So far in this dispute much has
been said about 1) ethical and
philosophical aspects of using

racial groups as mascots, 2) the
effect the change of mascots will
have on the Stanford Community,
and 3) what we [the European
invaders] did to the Indians. Yet
very little has been said about
what we (all of us] are doing to
the Indians, now . .. this very
day.
I grew up in Montana. I have
worked as a camp counselor at a
camp on the Blackfoot Indian
Reservation. The camp served
boys of all races through the Boy
Scouts of America. I have also
spent some time on a ranch on the
Flathead Indian Reservation near
Ronan, Montana. A number of
Indian families are living in
Helena, where I grew up. "Liv
ing," however, is not an apt
description, subsisting would be a
more fitting term: physically,
emotionally, socially, and eco
nomically subsisting. I feel certain
that these have some more serious
complaints than sharing the name
Indian with some fancy California
university.
Somehow, I cannot find much
sympathy for a group of Native
Americans whose worst complaint
seems to be the name of a mascot.
I feel that this group and the
Stanford Community have ig

nored what should have been the
major concern: the plight of a
group of fellow human beings. In
comparison to the Indians I have
known, the Stanford Native
Americans have it made if this is
the most serious issue they can
raise.
Though some may say this is "a
beginning" or that "yÂ° u have to
start somewhere," I say this has
been a waste, a farce, a token
solution to a token complaint.
The guilty consciences have been
soothed, Stanford has come
through again and done its part
for minorities, the Native Ameri
cans can chalk up a victory and be
proud members of the Stanford
Community .. . and in Montana
[where's that?] and other places
we don't talk about, Indians will
still be doing their "shopping" for
furnitire, shelter, clothing and yes,
even food at the city dump.
