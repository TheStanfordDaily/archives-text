Soledad Brothers Acquitted
SAN FRANCISCO — An all-white jury yesterday
acquitted the two surviving Soledad Brothers, black
convicts charged with murdering a white prison guard.
The two—John Clutchette and Fletta Drumgo—and
George Jackson, a third Soledad Brother who died in San
Quentin violence last Aug. 21, are the prisoners Angela
Davis is charged with plotting to free.
"The verdict is beautiful" Miss Davis said in San Jose
where she is on trial for kidnap, conspiracy and murder.
Clutchette, 28, and Drumgo, 26, were accused with
Jackson, 28, of beating guard John V. Mills to death Jan.
16, 1970, at Soledad Prison in Monterey County.
Jackson, whose book of letters from prison became an
underground best seller, died with three white guards and
two white convicts in what prison authorities called an
escape attempt.
The Superior Court jury had deliberated the case since
Friday night.
The trial had lasted 13 weeks under extraordinary
security precautions at the Hall of Justice. Clutchette and
Drumgo were flown back and forth each day from San
Quentin by helicopter.
When the innocent verdicts were read, Clutchette and
Drumgo jumped up and hugged their court-appointed
attorneys—Richard Silver and Floyd Silliman.
Doris Maxwell, Clutchette's mother, said, "Oh, thank
God. God bless the jury. I am as happy as the first day
John was born."
Inez Williams, mother of Drumgo, said, "I'm very, very
happy and very excited.
"But our fight is not over. Fletta has been indicted for
what happened at San Quentin when George Jackson
died. So we have to keep on fighting," Mrs. Williams said.
Drumgo is charged with murder in the Marin County
indictment stemming from the San Quentin violence.
No other charge was pending against Clutchette, who
was scheduled for parole April 20, 1970, before being
charged in Mills' death.
John Callahan, an airlines ticket agent who served on
the jury of nine women and three men, said Gov. Reagan
immediately should pardon both Clutchette and Drumgo.
"There was no case against them," Callahan declared.
"Everybody who testified against them was bought."
When Clutchette and Drumgo thanked the jurors for
their verdict, Callahan said he told them, "I should thank
you. We have suffered for five months to get the truth.
You have suffered for years just to get justice."
Superior Court Judge S. Lee Vavuris dropped

contempt charges he had ordered against both defense
attorneys.
Dita Unable To Testify
DENVER, Colo. — Doctors attending ailing lobbyist Dita
D. Beard said yesterday it is doubtful she will ever testify
again before the Senate Judiciary Committee considering
the nomination of Richard G. Kleindienst to be attorney
general.
Doctors Lewis Radetsky and David Garland said it will
be at least six months before Mrs. Beard, recovering from
a heart ailment, might be well enough to travel to
Washington for a Senate hearing.
Mrs. Beard collapsed in bed during the second of two
extraordinary hearings Sunday before a Senate subcom
mittee in a hospital meeting room.
But she already had linked the White House to the
controversy surrounding her boss, International
Telephone & Telegraph Corp.
Berrigan Final Arguments Begin
HARRISBURG, Pa. — Final arguments begin this morning
in the trial of Father Philip Berrigan and six others. One
of the defendants had two of the three charges against
him dropped yesterday.
Eqbal Ahmad was cleared of a charge of writing a letter
threatening to kidnap Presidential aide Henry Kissinger,
but remains charged with conspiracy, as are the other six
defendants.
U.S. District Judge R. Dixon Herman rejected defense
motions to acquit the rest of the Harrisburg 7, including
the Rev. Philip Berrigan, on all charges.
Ahmad, a Pakistani Moslem and the only non-Catholic
among the defendants, also was cleared of a charge of
causing an illegal letter to be smuggled into a federal
penitentiary.
Ahmad now faces a maximum penalty of five years in
prison if convicted, in contrast to the 20-year sentence he
could have received before the directed acquittal.
Only Berrigan, who could get up to 45 years, and Sister
Elizabeth McAlister, who could get up to 40 years, still
face lengthy prison terms if convicted. The others all face
the maximum five years on the conspiracy charge.

BELFAST — The Protestants struck back in Northern
Ireland yesterday with a massive general strike that
brought Belfast to a virtual halt.
The strike, protesting Britain's takeover of the
government, started with a cut in electrical power at
breakfast time.
