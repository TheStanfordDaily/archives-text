# Defense Testimony Stricken In Shockley-CJP Hearing
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
A key defense witness had his
testimony stricken from the record
yesterday for refusing to identify an
informant in the Campus Judicial
Panel hearings of three persons charg
ed with disrupting Professor William
Shockley's quantum mechanics class
January 18.
The three defendants are Don Lee,
Kwonping Ho, and Alice Furumoto.
In addition, the defense submitted
for decision the case of Gerry Foote,
originally charged with the other
three, without presenting any testi
mony in her behalf. Her case will not
be officially concluded until the
prosecution recalls one of its witnesses
against her.
Stricken
The testimony of Bill Flores, a
Political Science graduate student, was
stricken after he refused to tell the
prosecution the name of the person
who informed him that there would be
a disruption of Shockley's class.
Hearing Officer Henry Ramsey over
ruled strong defense objections by
claiming that the question concerned
the "veracity of the witness."
Defense co-counsel Ricardo De
Anda told Flores, "You don't have to
answer that if you're going to get
somebody in trouble." Flores again
refused to answer and his testimony
was thrown out.
The defense was dealt another blow
earlier in the day when Ramsey would
not allow them to present testimony
relating to what constitutes a disrup
tion in a classroom situation.
In obtaining the objection, Ramsey
declared, "The charge of the hearing
officer is to find out what the hell
happened in that class and not what
this professor things." He then re
cessed the hearing until the afternoon.
In his stricken testimony Flores

claimed Shockley made taunting re
marks to the person who read a
statement condemning Shockley and
asking him to debate. Flores said
Shockley's remarks stirred up the
originally quiet group of demonstra
tors. After Shockley had agreed to a
debate with Psychology Professor
Cedric Clark, Flores testified that the
demonstrators left when they felt their
purpose had been accomplished.
Third World
Flores remembered Furumoto
speaking out only once during the half
hour protest and Ho only twice. In
addition, Flores said there were only
three whites in the room, and that
they were "observers instead of
participants" because the protest was
largely run by Third World people.
The only testimony entered into the
record yesterday was given by Charlie

Bennett, a KZSU news analyst. Ben
nett remembered Shockley saying,
toward the end of the protest, "I
would vote for the suspension of any
student who has disrupted my class."
Bennett testified that he was
reasonably sure Ho said things inside
the classroom, but claimed there was
nothing to distinguish llo's remarks
from those of anyone else. Bennett
also had a vague recollection of
Furumoto standing up and speaking
loudly once.
Bennett did not remember seeing
Don Lee at the protest at all, and said
he recalled seeing only one white
person inside the room.
Testimony is expected to conclude
Wednesday at 1:00 p.m. with final
arguments scheduled for Friday at
1:30 p.m. in Room 83 of the Graduate
School of Business.
