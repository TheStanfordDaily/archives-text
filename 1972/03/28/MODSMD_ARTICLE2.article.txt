## Angela Linked To Marin Shootings 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
The prosecution said yesterday that
Angela Davis' love for George Jackson
led her to devise an "ingenious" plan
for his escape, which though "nearly
successful," at the last minute back
fired and resulted in murder.
While admitting that he would rely
entirely on circumstantial evidence,
prosecutor Albert Harris Jr. claimed he
will show an intricate web of links
between Davis and Jonathan Jackson,
which he said will prove that there was
a "conspiracy" for which Davis bears
principle responsibility.

Davis, 28, is charged with murder,
kidnap and conspiracy. She is accused
under a state law which holds
conspirators equally responsible with
those who commit a crime.
Much of the evidence in the case,
including a detailed description of the
August 7, 1970 Marin County court
house shootout in which Judge Harold
Haley, Jonathan Jackson, and two
other convicts were killed, was made
public for the first time yesterday.
The defendant sat impassively, her
chin resting on her hands and her eyes
on Harris as he spoke. The small,

72-seat courtroom was packed with
spectators and press who remained
silent throughout the four hour
statement.
"Her motive. . . was passion—simple
human passion," Harris said, "... a
passion which went beyond a respect
for human life, even the life of George
Jackson's brother, Jonathan."
Not Abstract
"The motive was not abstract, not
founded on social justice, it was
founded on passion—the same passion
which motivates hundreds of violent
crimes every year," said Harris.
Evidence of Davis' love for Jackson
to be offered by the prosecution will
include private letters that she wrote
him in prison, and a "close, passionate,
and physical involvement" that she
had with him during a July 8, 1971
meeting in the Marin County Jail after
Davis' capture and only one month
before Jackson was killed in an escape
attempt.
That meeting, requested by Davis'
attorneys and granted by a special
court order, violated a state law
prohibiting male and female prisoners
from seeing each other. However, what
is more significant according to Davis'
attorney, Leo Branton, is that the
meeting which was for the purpose of
preparing the defense and was sup
posed to be private, was apparently
secretly monitored.
Evidence of Davis' ability to carry
out the conspiracy according to Harris
included her purchase of four guns
used in the kidnapping, two of which
were bought specifically for this act;
her purchase of 450 rounds of
ammunition within a month of the
event; and her having provided the
money used to rent a van used in the
escape attempt.
"Practically every instrumentality

of the crime was the property of the
defendant," said Harris, "young
Jackson was merely a tool of Miss
Davis and George Jackson."
Davis' opportunity to conspire will
be shown by the close association
between herself and Jonathan Jackson
in the days before the crime according
to Harris. "It's one thing to go to a
show together," he said, "but it's
another to go to a gunshop together. I
want you to consider the purpose of
this close association .. . the only
possible conclusion is that Angela
Davis did aid and abett, render
assistance, furnish weapons, and con
spire with Jonathan Jackson."
Dry Run
Harris listed several occasions short
ly before the shootout in which Davis
and Jackson were seen together. Most
damaging if established as fact was an
alleged "dry run" of the kidnapping
the day before the actual event.
Harris pointed to Davis' flight from
San Francisco to Los Angeles only two
hours after the shootout as evidence of
her awareness of her own guilt. He said
that the Marin Courthouse group was
planning to meet her at the airport.
By the time they would have
arrived, he said, the alleged conspira
tors hoped that George Jackson and
the oher "Soledad Brothers" would be
free; the hostages would be released
and all would embark for freedom.
"One member of that conspiracy
was not at Marin County Civic
Center," Harris said, turning slightly
toward Davis. "Instead, the defendant
on trial here was at San Francisco
International Airport."
In addition, he said that the state
would show that Jonathan Jackson's
wallet contained a slip of paper
bearing a public phone number at the
airport where Davis may have been
waiting, and that a car borrowed by
Jackson which Davis may have used
was found at the airport after the
shootout.
Harris warned the jurors not to be
influenced by Davis' calm demeanor
and scholarly background. ". . . The
defendant does not live only in the
world of ideas,.. . her own words will
reveal that beneath the cool academic
veneer is a woman capable of being
moved to violence by passion."
Court recessed and attorneys met
with Judge Richard Arnason after the
defense announced that it will make
an opening statement at 9:30 this
morning after preparing a "point-by
point" reply to Harris' remarks.

ammunition within a month of the
event; and her having provided the
money used to rent a van used in the
escape attempt.
"Practically every instrumentality

of the crime was the property of the
defendant," said Harris, "young
Jackson was merely a tool of Miss
Davis and George Jackson."
Davis' opportunity to conspire will
be shown by the close association
between herself and Jonathan Jackson
in the days before the crime according
to Harris. "It's one thing to go to a
show together," he said, "but it's
another to go to a gunshop together. I
want you to consider the purpose of
this close association .. . the only
possible conclusion is that Angela
Davis did aid and abett, render
assistance, furnish weapons, and con
spire with Jonathan Jackson."
Dry Run
Harris listed several occasions short
ly before the shootout in which Davis
and Jackson were seen together. Most
damaging if established as fact was an
alleged "dry run" of the kidnapping
the day before the actual event.
Harris pointed to Davis' flight from
San Francisco to Los Angeles only two
hours after the shootout as evidence of
her awareness of her own guilt. He said
that the Marin Courthouse group was
planning to meet her at the airport.
By the time they would have
arrived, he said, the alleged conspira
tors hoped that George Jackson and
the oher "Soledad Brothers" would be
free; the hostages would be released
and all would embark for freedom.
"One member of that conspiracy
was not at Marin County Civic
Center," Harris said, turning slightly
toward Davis. "Instead, the defendant
on trial here was at San Francisco
International Airport."
In addition, he said that the state
would show that Jonathan Jackson's
wallet contained a slip of paper
bearing a public phone number at the
airport where Davis may have been
waiting, and that a car borrowed by
Jackson which Davis may have used
was found at the airport after the
shootout.
Harris warned the jurors not to be
influenced by Davis' calm demeanor
and scholarly background. ". . . The
defendant does not live only in the
world of ideas,.. . her own words will
reveal that beneath the cool academic
veneer is a woman capable of being
moved to violence by passion."
Court recessed and attorneys met
with Judge Richard Arnason after the
defense announced that it will make
an opening statement at 9:30 this
morning after preparing a "point-by
point" reply to Harris' remarks.
The prosecution said yesterday that
Angela Davis' love for George Jackson
led her to devise an "ingenious" plan
for his escape, which though "nearly
successful," at the last minute back
fired and resulted in murder.
While admitting that he would rely
entirely on circumstantial evidence,
prosecutor Albert Harris Jr. claimed he
will show an intricate web of links
between Davis and Jonathan Jackson,
which he said will prove that there was
a "conspiracy" for which Davis bears
principle responsibility.

Davis, 28, is charged with murder,
kidnap and conspiracy. She is accused
under a state law which holds
conspirators equally responsible with
those who commit a crime.
Much of the evidence in the case,
including a detailed description of the
August 7, 1970 Marin County court
house shootout in which Judge Harold
Haley, Jonathan Jackson, and two
other convicts were killed, was made
public for the first time yesterday.
The defendant sat impassively, her
chin resting on her hands and her eyes
on Harris as he spoke. The small,

72-seat courtroom was packed with
spectators and press who remained
silent throughout the four hour
statement.
"Her motive. . . was passion—simple
human passion," Harris said, "... a
passion which went beyond a respect
for human life, even the life of George
Jackson's brother, Jonathan."
Not Abstract
"The motive was not abstract, not
founded on social justice, it was
founded on passion—the same passion
which motivates hundreds of violent
crimes every year," said Harris.
Evidence of Davis' love for Jackson
to be offered by the prosecution will
include private letters that she wrote
him in prison, and a "close, passionate,
and physical involvement" that she
had with him during a July 8, 1971
meeting in the Marin County Jail after
Davis' capture and only one month
before Jackson was killed in an escape
attempt.
That meeting, requested by Davis'
attorneys and granted by a special
court order, violated a state law
prohibiting male and female prisoners
from seeing each other. However, what
is more significant according to Davis'
attorney, Leo Branton, is that the
meeting which was for the purpose of
preparing the defense and was sup
posed to be private, was apparently
secretly monitored.
Evidence of Davis' ability to carry
out the conspiracy according to Harris
included her purchase of four guns
used in the kidnapping, two of which
were bought specifically for this act;
her purchase of 450 rounds of
ammunition within a month of the
event; and her having provided the
money used to rent a van used in the
escape attempt.
