# Waiting, Hating Diminish
## Limited Confusion Marks New Reg Day 
### DAVE SULITEANU 
The new Advance Registration
procedure, completed by more than
7000 students, was initiated as a result
of a recent Gallup popularity poll
which rated registration day on a par
with Pearl Harbor, Lee Harvey Oswald,
and food service hamburgers. It was to
herald a new era of no fussing and
cussing where, as the program's plan
ners said, "if you no wait, you no
hate."
Yesterday there was no doubt that
the fussing and the cussing, the waiting
and the hating had diminished. Both
students and registrars agreed that
Advance Registration had made the
whole procedure faster and more
efficient. The crowd even contained
some smiling faces.
In the pavilion the information
table, usually completely buried by
lost souls, was visible. The lines,
which in the past have dwarfed those
of the "Love Story" box office,
shriveled up. An official from the
Santa Clara County Line Measuring

Bureau estimated that on a one to 10
scale (from short to long) "the lines
hovered around 2 all day."
The number of totally confused
people wandering aimlessly from table
to table mumbling "Where am I? What
am I doing?" had also definitely
dwindled.
Partial Exasperation
However, there was considerable
evidence of partially exasperated stu
dents. Confusion Central, traditionally
located at the pavilion, yesterday
moved to the Old Union. All questions
concerning bills, schedules, their iden
tities, etc. seemed to be clustered
there.
It was in the Old Union that one
could find the longest and most
unpopular line. Having tied itself in
knots, with a 20 minute wait, the line
to pick up loans was reminiscent of
registration days gone by. Because
loans were not available until yester
day, many students complained (es
pecially those at the end of the line)
that they had advance registered with
the idea that thev would not have to

return on reg day.
The loans were not ready for
Advance Registration, said Joseph
Jedd, student accounting manager,
because the paperwork involved was
not completed in time. "It would
certainly be desirable," he said, "if we
could have the loans ready when the
students advance register. This is one
of the things that we will be
considering when we evaluate what has
happened today."
Some tuition-grant cards and non
university scholarships also could not
be picked up until yesterday.
Treasure Hunt
Winning the most confusing activity
of the day award was the "Where do I
get my meal ticket" treasure hunt. At
the end of the day most students had
still not obtained their meal stickers.
Many thought that because of the new
registration method the procedure for
picking up meal stamps had also
changed, and apparently a few of the
cashiers thought the same thing. The
food service office could not under

stand why students coming from the
cashier kept wandering in looking for
their meal tickets. Said one exasperat
ed secretary, "I don't know what's
going on. It's a big mess."
When asked why the food stickers
could not have been taken care of
during advanced registration, Kay
Gaskin, food service secretary, re
plied, "The main reason why this was
not done was because the student
body card is too small to hold two
stickers. With three weeks left in the
quarter, we couldn't cover up the
Winter stickers, especially those of
students who changed board plans."
She added, "Students can pick up
their stickers at the food service office
from Tuesday on. The old ones will be
good only through Wednesday."
Now that the whole thing is over,
the committee that was primarily
responsible for the new procedures
will determine what went wrong and
how to improve it so that by the next
popularity poll, registration will have
moved up at least to the level of final
exams.
