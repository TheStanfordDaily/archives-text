# Indian Mascot Elimination Moves Slowly
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
Just one month after the Student
Senate decided to eliminate use of the
Indian as the ASSU mascot, confusion
abounds on whether the change is
official and when a formal drop of the
name will take place.
Discrepancies between the Senate's
resolution to abolish the mascot and
more recent statements by President
Richard Lyman leave the question of
who has the final say on the mascot's
demise up in the air.
The difference of opinion
surrounds a committee set up by the
Student Senate to carry out the
decision to abolish the mascot, which

the President's Office understood
would first make its own decision on
the mascot's elimination.
Besides four members of the
student body, the committee has a
representative from the alumni, the
Stanford Buck Club, the Athletics
Department, the Native American
Students Association, and the ASSU
Senate. The committee must also find
a method for choosing a new mascot.
At the same time, the prevailing
opinion is that the mascot is sure to
go. President Lyman stated that
abolishing the Indian symbol "might
remove one obstacle" to

understanding the extreme hardship
which the Indians face in the U.S., in a
letter to Buck Club members two
weeks ago.
Inconceivable
Lyman also said earlier over KZSU
that "It's just about inconceivable that
the committee is going to recommend
reinstatement of the Indian symbol."
Robert Young, acting director of
athletics, said he is going on "the
assumption that it [the mascot J is
out," but has received no explicit
directions. All use of the Indian
mascot by the department will not
stop immediately, but when publicity
materials and certain uniforms are

re-ordered they will no longer have
any reference to the mascot, according
to Young.
Brochures and ticket orders for
next year's football season will carry a
block "S" instead of an Indian's
profile, for example.
Members of the committee on the
mascot are not certain whether they
will review or just carry out the
Student Senate's 18-4 vote to
eliminate the Indian mascot.
James Mell Jr., former Buck Club
president, said yesterday he has
received "no contact on when we meet
or what the charge [of the committee]
is." He added that he did "not care
whether the Indian is retained or not."
Athletic Department alumni
coordinator Jack Laird will also sit on
the committee with William Kartozian,
immediate past president of the
Alumni Association, and ASSU
Senator Linda Wright, a senior and
former pom-pon girl. The other five
members of the committee have yet to
be chosen.

NO MORE SCALPING—Prince Lightfoot and the befeathered Stanford pom-pon dollies danced down Disneyland's Main
Street for perhaps the last time this winter. President Lyman and the Student Senate have expressed interest in the
Indian mascot's demise.
The disagreement on the
committee's purpose stems from a
strong difference of opinion between
student leaders and the President's
Office.
According to Bill Stone, assistant to
President Lyman, he met with ASSU
co-presidents Doug McHenry and
Diane Fields to discuss the nature of
this mascot committee, shortly before
the proposal was laid before the ASSU
Senate.
Review
Stone thought an understanding
was reached giving the committee
power to review any decision to
eliminate the mascot, but McHenry
apparently did not agree and
introduced the proposal to the Senate
without this provision.
Then two weeks later, Lyman sent

a letter to members of the Buck Club,
saying the Senate's mascot committee
would have this power of review, to
further draw the lines of opposition.
A meeting will be held today with
Lyman, McHenry, and Stone among
others to resolve the question. While
McHenry had no comment beyond his
Senate resolution, Stone commented
yesterday that the present resolution
will "exclude other constituencies
from the decision" to abolish the
mascot.
The purpose of having the
committee make its own decision on
the Indian symbol is to allow groups
such as the alumni and the Buck Club
to feel they have been consulted on
the decision, according to Stone.
He does not want the alumni to feel
that "the University is caving in to a
pressure group or angry mob."

registration gains wider acceptance. This year, some 7000 students took part in
registration yesterday, choosing not to avail themselves of the new procedures.

go. President Lyman stated that
abolishing the Indian symbol "might
remove one obstacle" to

understanding the extreme hardship
which the Indians face in the U.S., in a
letter to Buck Club members two
weeks ago.
Inconceivable
Lyman also said earlier over KZSU
that "It's just about inconceivable that
the committee is going to recommend
reinstatement of the Indian symbol."
Robert Young, acting director of
athletics, said he is going on "the
assumption that it [the mascot J is
out," but has received no explicit
directions. All use of the Indian
mascot by the department will not
stop immediately, but when publicity
materials and certain uniforms are

re-ordered they will no longer have
any reference to the mascot, according
to Young.
Brochures and ticket orders for
next year's football season will carry a
block "S" instead of an Indian's
profile, for example.
Members of the committee on the
mascot are not certain whether they
will review or just carry out the
Student Senate's 18-4 vote to
eliminate the Indian mascot.
James Mell Jr., former Buck Club
president, said yesterday he has
received "no contact on when we meet
or what the charge [of the committee]
is." He added that he did "not care
whether the Indian is retained or not."
Athletic Department alumni
coordinator Jack Laird will also sit on
the committee with William Kartozian,
immediate past president of the
Alumni Association, and ASSU
Senator Linda Wright, a senior and
former pom-pon girl. The other five
members of the committee have yet to
be chosen.

NO MORE SCALPING—Prince Lightfoot and the befeathered Stanford pom-pon dollies danced down Disneyland's Main
Street for perhaps the last time this winter. President Lyman and the Student Senate have expressed interest in the
Indian mascot's demise.
The disagreement on the
committee's purpose stems from a
strong difference of opinion between
student leaders and the President's
Office.
According to Bill Stone, assistant to
President Lyman, he met with ASSU
co-presidents Doug McHenry and
Diane Fields to discuss the nature of
this mascot committee, shortly before
the proposal was laid before the ASSU
Senate.
Review
Stone thought an understanding
was reached giving the committee
power to review any decision to
eliminate the mascot, but McHenry
apparently did not agree and
introduced the proposal to the Senate
without this provision.
Then two weeks later, Lyman sent

a letter to members of the Buck Club,
saying the Senate's mascot committee
would have this power of review, to
further draw the lines of opposition.
A meeting will be held today with
Lyman, McHenry, and Stone among
others to resolve the question. While
McHenry had no comment beyond his
Senate resolution, Stone commented
yesterday that the present resolution
will "exclude other constituencies
from the decision" to abolish the
mascot.
The purpose of having the
committee make its own decision on
the Indian symbol is to allow groups
such as the alumni and the Buck Club
to feel they have been consulted on
the decision, according to Stone.
He does not want the alumni to feel
that "the University is caving in to a
pressure group or angry mob."

FINAL STEP—Scenes like this may well be eventually stamped out as advance
registration gains wider acceptance. This year, some 7000 students took part in
registration yesterday, choosing not to avail themselves of the new procedures.
Just one month after the Student
Senate decided to eliminate use of the
Indian as the ASSU mascot, confusion
abounds on whether the change is
official and when a formal drop of the
name will take place.
Discrepancies between the Senate's
resolution to abolish the mascot and
more recent statements by President
Richard Lyman leave the question of
who has the final say on the mascot's
demise up in the air.
The difference of opinion
surrounds a committee set up by the
Student Senate to carry out the
decision to abolish the mascot, which

the President's Office understood
would first make its own decision on
the mascot's elimination.
Besides four members of the
student body, the committee has a
representative from the alumni, the
Stanford Buck Club, the Athletics
Department, the Native American
Students Association, and the ASSU
Senate. The committee must also find
a method for choosing a new mascot.
At the same time, the prevailing
opinion is that the mascot is sure to
go. President Lyman stated that
