# Stanford Security Patrols Will Be Deputized

About 30 Stanford "police" will eventually
obtain full peace officer status under an
agreement between the University and the
Santa Clara County Sheriff signed two weeks
ago.
The "memorandum of understanding,"
signed by Sheriff James Geary and University
Vice-President for Business and Finance
Robert Augsberger, will provide the Stanford
officers with the same on-duty powers as
regular Sheriff's deputies or city policemen.
Before the agreement, Stanford public safety
officers had no police powers.
Under the memorandum, Geary will, at the
request of Stanford Director of Public Safety
Marvin Herrington, swear specially trained
Stanford officers into the Sheriff's
Department as reserve deputies, but
Herrington will retain operational control of
the newlv deputized officers.
Early 1973
Two Stanford officers—Herrington and
Stanford Public Safety Captain William
Wullschleger-have been deputized already,
but Reserve Captain Herrington does not
expect to "phase in" to the agreement
completely until early 1973.

He hopes to have about 15 officers
deputized by September, with the remainder
to be recruited and trained later.
The memorandum states that "In the
exercise of his authority as a peace officer the
Director of Public Safety at Stanford
University shall be under the command of any
regular Deputy Sheriff of equivalent or higher
rank."
According to Santa Clara officials, this
provision extends to all other command
personnel—a Sheriffs lieutenant can
command a Stanford reserve lieutenant, for
instance.
However, Herrington has promised to place
himself under the command of the Sheriff's
Office "watch commander," usually a
lieutenant, who will now monitor the
Stanford radio frequency continuously.
Because of the agreement with Geary,
concluded after almost a year of negotiations,
Stanford has moved to kill a bill introduced in
the State Assembly at the University's request
by Republican Assemblyman Dixon Arnett,
former Director of Community Relations it-
Stanford's University Relations office.
The bill would have conferred limited
peace officer powers on selected Stanford

officers, and placed them under the Sheriffs
supervision.
Some Sheriffs Office command personnel
believe that Geary capitulated to Stanford
because of the threatened passage of Arnett's
legislation, A.B. 1248, but both Geary and
Stanford President Richard Lyman deny any
direct or implied threat.
Lyman traveled to San Jose to describe the
University's position on the legislation to
Geary in early March. As Lyman explains it,
the deadline for submitting bills in the
Legislature was March 15, and the University
"was not about to wait twelve more months"
to resolve the police question.
Marked Cars
When Stanford has its full complement of
30-35 reserve deputies, it will operate four
marked patrol cars 24 hours a day, according
to Herrington.
All the newly deputized Stanford officers
will operate from patrol cars. Foot patrolmen,
now called "community service officers," will
soon be clothed in blazers, while reserve
deputies will probably wear the normal
Sheriffs reserve uniform with a Stanford
University patch and/or badge.

However. Stanford reserve deputies will
not be allowed to operate University-owned
vehicles equipped with red light and siren,
according to undersheriff Tom Rosa, because
"the law states that the only vehicles that can
be equipped as emergency vehicles are those
that are owned or maintained by the public
entity that has jurisdiction in the area, which
is in this case the Sheriffs Office."
Reserve deputies employed by Stanford
will be allowed to carry and use shotguns,
mace, and other traditional police weapons
after they are trained in their use.
Detectives
While Stanford will create a detective
section for misdemeanor investigations, the
Sheriffs Office will conduct initial and
followup investigations of all burglaries
greater than $1,000 and all other felonies.
Herrington had originally planned to train
a squad of about twelve men for duty in
crowd control and riot situations, but Geary
will apparently prevent Stanford from
forming its own tactical squad, although he
has promised to review any proposals and will
continue to use his own men in these
situations.

Stanford's reserve deputies will receive the
same training as regular Sheriffs deputies, and
meet the standards set by the California
Commission on Peace Officer Standards and
Training.
Herrington plans to first evaluate men
presently employed by his department, and
then to recruit for the positions remaining. He
has not hired new officers since he began
work at Stanford last year, allowing the
department to fall about 20 men below its
authorized strength.
Herrington has prom/-?d that any men
discharged from his department because of
the deputization agreement will be offered
positions elsewhere in the University.
He expects the pay scale for deputies to
increase, but does not anticipate an immediate
increase in his department's budget, now
between $800,000 and $900,000.
The activities of Stanford reservists will be
supervised closely by Sheriff's regular
deputies—Stanford must follow all Sheriffs
office policies and procedures, maintain a
"Daily Occurrence Report" and forward it to
the Sheriff's Office, and must open its
personnel and criminal investigation files to
inspection by authorized Sheriffs deputies.
