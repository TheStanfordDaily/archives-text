## Open Recruiting Important 
### 
The following is an open letter to
President Richard Lyman.
I have recently received a letter
from Mr. Ralph W. Keller, the
Director of the Career Planning
and Placement Center, in which
he urged me to write to you
expressing my views on the
present Placement Center contro
versy.
Although I have been away
from Stanford for several months,
I am a very recent graduate and a
beneficiary of Placement Center
services. Moreover, as a photog
rapher and member of the Editor
ial Board of the Stanford Daily, I
was quite familiar with the Place
ment Center issue as it existed last
fall. My readings of relatively
current Dailies indicate that the
situation has not changed in a
qualitative sense, although the
protests against recruiting seem to
be more intense now than they
were in the fall.
First, to state my position as
directly as possible, I am opposed,
on principle, to the restriction of
recruiting activities at Stanford. I
will not hedge and make excep
tions for companies that are
racist, sexist, militarist, anti-
Semitic, or whatever; I do not
care if they are Fascist or
Communist. If they want to
recruit, I believe that the Univer
sity should welcome them, if not
with open arms, then at least with
the courtesy that we have pro
fessed to extend to controversial
persons or institutions in the past.
The Placement Center pro
testers claim that restricting re
cruitment activities is not an
abridgement of either academic
freedom or freedom of speech.
"We will listen to what you have
to say, but we will not let you
conduct your business here" is a
phrase which I seem to recall
hearing many times last fall. The
argument is clearly specious. To
characterize recruiting as "carry
ing on business" is to stretch the
concept of "business" to a point

beyond credibility.
By seeking to prevent certain
corporations from meeting poten
tial employees on campus, the
Placement Center demonstrators
are exhibiting a moral superiority
and arrogance that would have
done credit to the most orthodox
of Puritan censors. As a graduate
student at Stanford, with a fair
idea of what was going on in the
world, and several decades of
moral pondering behind me, I felt
that I was competent to deter
mine who was worthy of hiring
my services. I did not feel that I
needed either Venceremos or
Columbae House as arbiters. I
suspect that the vast majority of
students who use the Placement
Center feel the same.
The Placement Center demon
strators rationalize their disruptive
activities (as opposed to their
protest activitiesâ€”which require
no rationalization) by appeal to
the student referendum of Spring,
1971, which called for an end to
the use of university facilities for
corporations engaged in war
related work. While I am the last
person to denigrate the value of
referenda, I must question the
validity of this particular vote as
representing a mandate from"the
students."
You see, there are students and
then there are students. In this
case, the students that voted to, in
effect, halt recruiting, are not the
students who are likely to be in
need of the proferred services.
The Placement Center, in its
capacity as an interview service,
caters largely to graduate students
in science and engineering, a body
which has historically taken little
or no interest in the functioning
of student government. To the
vast, vast majority of engineering
graduate students, the ASSU rep
resents a juvenile assemblage of
amateur politicos and a comic
opera Senate whose only concern
with the students of the School of
Engineering is to periodically pass

resolutions endorsing attacks on
various laboratories. The degree of
interest in student politics preva
lent in the graduate sciences was
indicated in last fall's election,
when none of the seats alloted to
graduate engineering and earth
science were filled, let alone
contested, in the Senate election.
Most graduate scientists either
did not know, or did not care,
that a resolution restricting re
cruiting activities was on the
Spring ballot. Apparently they
were not alone, as the total vote
on the issue came to less than
twenty percent of the student
body, if I remember correctly.
Given the lack of publicity direct
ed to the subject at the time, it is
not unreasonable to assume that
the students who did bother to
exercise their franchise were more
likely to have been contacted by
proponents of the measure, who
were relatively well organized,
than by opponents, who were
largely unaware that it existed at
all.
To reiterate, on purely theoreti
cal grounds I feel that the move to
forcibly restrict recruiting at the
University is a direct threat to
freedom of speech and academic
freedom, that it is based on an
insulting and intolerable moral
arrogance on the part of the
demonstrators, some, and perhaps
many, of whom have exhibited
either definite political bias or

distressing ignorance in regard to
the issues, and that the referen
dum that is used to justify these
actions in the name of "the
students" is, at least in my mind,
of dubious value as an indicator of
student opinion.
It is easy for the undergraduate,
smug and secure in his father's
money, to condemn the nefarious
deeds of Corporate America. But
when Corporate America is your
only opportunity to continue
eating beyond graduation, you
begin to see things in a somewhat
different light. I, for one, found
myself talking last fall with
companies whose social policies,
politics and products I found very
disagreeable, companies I didn't
consider talking to a year earlier,
when graduation was still very far
away.
Stanford University has faced
several challenges to free speech in
the last year; it lost a major
challenge with its dismissal of
Professor Franklin. It is my
earnest hope that the University
will show greater courage in
devotion to its principles in this
case, and resist attempts by a
group of ersatz moral arbiters to
deprive graduating students of the
services of the Placement Center.

graduate. While at Stanford he
was a member of the Daily staff
and a regular columnist.)
