Youth Vote
Editor, THE DAILY:
Mr. Agnew and others have
been saying the youth vote will be
an illusion. One might have
thought otherwise during the
outpouring of energy against the
Cambodian invasion, but time and
tokenism have taken their toll
until political activism, as con
trasted to vandalism, has pretty
much disappeared.

Unfortunately many people
think that the important decisions
will be made November 7 or at
least on June 6 when the primary
will be held. They are wrong. The
decisive date for California will be
April 13 when voter registration
ends under the present law.
Since the power of the ballot is
held only by those who are
registered to vote, the first crucial
step in pressuring or reforming the
government is to register the

workers, minority group mem
bers, and students who in massive
numbers are often disenfranchised
by the electoral system.
What can be done? You and
everyone you know who wants to
work within the system can
become a deputy voter registrar
and register voters in your spare
time. All it requires is a two hour
class and some initiative. The
people I've registered have been
pleased to have the chance and
apologetic about being unregis
tered.
With only two weeks left, time
is becoming short. Anyone in
terested should call the Registrar
of Voters tc sign up for classes
this week. The class size must be
limited to 50 so call as early as

possible. The only requirement is
that you are registered to vote in
Santa Clara County and you may
register at the class.
The alternative is for more
from the bunch that brought us
Cambodia, Jackson State, Kent
State, Bangladesh, Rehnquist, and
the Berrigan trial. Clearly, this
chance to influence the system is
too important to sit out.

I have read in local newspapers
that Stanford will no longer be
known as the Indians. I am going
to miss those young ladies with
their pom pons and the feathers in
their headbands.
May I suggest that you call
yourselves the Stanford
"Lelands." Leland, being a
comparatively uncommon name,
you will run a minimal risk of
offending somebody.
