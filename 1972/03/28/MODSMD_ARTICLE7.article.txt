## 'Law And Order' Backfires 
### 
The continuing saga of
"L'Affaire ITT" ranks with the
Indochinese War, Attica, and the
Jackson and Kent State massacres
as one of the most deceptive

governmental opei&tions recently
force-fed to the American public.
Much of the groundwork for
the ITT-Justice Department-GOP
controversy was laid in 1968,

when Richard Nixon ran for the
Presidency on a well-publicized
"law and order" platform. Unfor
tunately, like his "secret plan" to
end the war in Indochina, "law
and order" proved to be a public
relations smokescreen that cover
ed up a rather remarkable lack of
definitive law-enforcement policy.
"Law and order" made a good
slogan, especially with all-Middle-
American Spiro Agnew running
for Vice President, and people
voted for the Nixon-Agnew slate.
But, like "Vietnamization,"
people still aren't sure what "law
and order" meant or means. Most
major urban crime indices are
continuing to climb at startling
rates; J. Edgar Hoover is still
running the F. 8.1.; and investiga
tions into various police depart
ments' corruption, brutality and
malfeasance are blossoming daily.
However, as apparent inconsis
tencies in how various laws have
been applied to special interest
groups (such as ITT, a multi
national conglomerate) surface,
the "law and order" theme seems
to have backfired on the President
in a most peculiar and unpleasant
way.
Americans got their first close
up view of the Justice Depart
ment's "new" style of "law and
order" during the Washington,
D.C. 'Mayday' antiwar demonstra
tions last spring.
There, the Metropolitan Police
Department, under the direction
of Atty. Gen. John Mitchell and
Asst Atty. Gen. Richard Kleindienst,
created what the American Civil
Liberties Union termed a "free
arrest zone" throughout large
sections of downtown Washing
ton. They arrested more than
12,000 people — may of them not
antiwar demonstrators — during
the course of the week.
In late May, some 6,000 cases
were thrown out of court in one
week; eventually fewer than 100

people were ever found guilty of
any charges. Most people were
arrested simply to "keep them off
the streets" — i.e., preserve "law
and order."
New Ball Game
But the ITT controversy, and
the nomination of Richard Klein
dienst to the Attorney General
ship, is a whole new ball game —
buying favors and influence.
How all of this came about is
well-known. The Senate Judiciary
Committee held a series of confir
mation hearings on Kleindienst's
qualifications. Nothing appeared
to be amiss — despite Klein
dienst's record as a 1964 Gold
water campaign manager and his
involvement as a leading decision
maker in determining the Justice
Department's response to the
'Mayday' demonstrations. He was
approved overwhelmingly by the
Senate committee.
Then, columnist Jack Ander
son published the controversial
memo from an ITT Washington
lobbyist that contradicted what
both Mitchell and Kleindienst
earlier had told the committee
about their relation to the ITT—
Hartford Insurance anti-trust
settlement with the Justice De
partment. And the memo that
Anderson published indicated that
a subsidiary of ITT, the Sheraton
hotel chain, was preparing to con
tribute $400,000 to the Republi
can National Convention to be
held in San Diego later this year.
Corrupt Practices Act
Under the Corrupt Practices
Act, it is illegal for "any corpora
tion whatsoever" to make a con
tribution or expenditure "in con
nection with any primary election
or political convention or caucus
held to select candidates" for
federal offices.
However, Kleindienst told the
Judiciary Committee two weeks
ago that he didn't think the al
leged $400,000 contribution (in

Ed kohn

hotel services) would be illegal
under the terms of the Act, pre
sumably because no money would
be given directly to either the
Republican National Committee
or to the President's campaign
organization.
And, in a discovery that reflects
much arrogance on ITT's part, the
Washington Post learned last week
that the offer might be withdrawn
— not because ITT considered it
illegal or was in any way pressured
to withdraw it, but because one
of the terms of the agreement
apparently stipulated that the
President was to use a new Sher?"
ton hotel as his headquarters dur
ing the convention — and the
Presidential campaign managers
apparently have yet to announce
such plans.
The ITT investigation should
come to a head within a few days.
A Judiciary subcommittee is now
in Denver interviewing the ITT
lobbyist to try to determine the
authenticity of the ITT memo and
to explore Kleindienst's involve
ment, if any, with the ITT—
Hartford Insurance merger. Also,
Sen. Mike Mansfield has promised
hearings in the near future on
other Anderson allegations that
ITT attempted to interfere in
Chile's presidential elections in
1970, in which a Marxist, obvious
ly hostile to ITT's investment in
that country, was elected.
But no matter how the hear
ings turn out, it seems doubtful
that the President will be able to
successfully exploit the "law and
order" theme in the upcoming
elections. And, whether or not the
Senate eventually approves it,
Kleindienst's nomination, like
those of Haynesworth, Carswell
and Butz, will make powerful
ammunition for Democratic con
tenders for public offices through
out the nation.

held in San Diego later this year.
Corrupt Practices Act
Under the Corrupt Practices
Act, it is illegal for "any corpora
tion whatsoever" to make a con
tribution or expenditure "in con
nection with any primary election
or political convention or caucus
held to select candidates" for
federal offices.
However, Kleindienst told the
Judiciary Committee two weeks
ago that he didn't think the al
leged $400,000 contribution (in

Ed kohn

hotel services) would be illegal
under the terms of the Act, pre
sumably because no money would
be given directly to either the
Republican National Committee
or to the President's campaign
organization.
And, in a discovery that reflects
much arrogance on ITT's part, the
Washington Post learned last week
that the offer might be withdrawn
— not because ITT considered it
illegal or was in any way pressured
to withdraw it, but because one
of the terms of the agreement
apparently stipulated that the
President was to use a new Sher?"
ton hotel as his headquarters dur
ing the convention — and the
Presidential campaign managers
apparently have yet to announce
such plans.
The ITT investigation should
come to a head within a few days.
A Judiciary subcommittee is now
in Denver interviewing the ITT
lobbyist to try to determine the
authenticity of the ITT memo and
to explore Kleindienst's involve
ment, if any, with the ITT—
Hartford Insurance merger. Also,
Sen. Mike Mansfield has promised
hearings in the near future on
other Anderson allegations that
ITT attempted to interfere in
Chile's presidential elections in
1970, in which a Marxist, obvious
ly hostile to ITT's investment in
that country, was elected.
But no matter how the hear
ings turn out, it seems doubtful
that the President will be able to
successfully exploit the "law and
order" theme in the upcoming
elections. And, whether or not the
Senate eventually approves it,
Kleindienst's nomination, like
those of Haynesworth, Carswell
and Butz, will make powerful
ammunition for Democratic con
tenders for public offices through
out the nation.

The continuing saga of
"L'Affaire ITT" ranks with the
Indochinese War, Attica, and the
Jackson and Kent State massacres
as one of the most deceptive

governmental opei&tions recently
force-fed to the American public.
Much of the groundwork for
the ITT-Justice Department-GOP
controversy was laid in 1968,

when Richard Nixon ran for the
Presidency on a well-publicized
"law and order" platform. Unfor
tunately, like his "secret plan" to
end the war in Indochina, "law
and order" proved to be a public
relations smokescreen that cover
ed up a rather remarkable lack of
definitive law-enforcement policy.
"Law and order" made a good
slogan, especially with all-Middle-
American Spiro Agnew running
for Vice President, and people
voted for the Nixon-Agnew slate.
But, like "Vietnamization,"
people still aren't sure what "law
and order" meant or means. Most
major urban crime indices are
continuing to climb at startling
rates; J. Edgar Hoover is still
running the F. 8.1.; and investiga
tions into various police depart
ments' corruption, brutality and
malfeasance are blossoming daily.
However, as apparent inconsis
tencies in how various laws have
been applied to special interest
groups (such as ITT, a multi
national conglomerate) surface,
the "law and order" theme seems
to have backfired on the President
in a most peculiar and unpleasant
way.
Americans got their first close
up view of the Justice Depart
ment's "new" style of "law and
order" during the Washington,
D.C. 'Mayday' antiwar demonstra
tions last spring.
There, the Metropolitan Police
Department, under the direction
of Atty. Gen. John Mitchell and
Asst Atty. Gen. Richard Kleindienst,
created what the American Civil
Liberties Union termed a "free
arrest zone" throughout large
sections of downtown Washing
ton. They arrested more than
12,000 people — may of them not
antiwar demonstrators — during
the course of the week.
In late May, some 6,000 cases
were thrown out of court in one
week; eventually fewer than 100

people were ever found guilty of
any charges. Most people were
arrested simply to "keep them off
the streets" — i.e., preserve "law
and order."
New Ball Game
But the ITT controversy, and
the nomination of Richard Klein
dienst to the Attorney General
ship, is a whole new ball game —
buying favors and influence.
How all of this came about is
well-known. The Senate Judiciary
Committee held a series of confir
mation hearings on Kleindienst's
qualifications. Nothing appeared
to be amiss — despite Klein
dienst's record as a 1964 Gold
water campaign manager and his
involvement as a leading decision
maker in determining the Justice
Department's response to the
'Mayday' demonstrations. He was
approved overwhelmingly by the
Senate committee.
Then, columnist Jack Ander
son published the controversial
memo from an ITT Washington
lobbyist that contradicted what
both Mitchell and Kleindienst
earlier had told the committee
about their relation to the ITT—
Hartford Insurance anti-trust
settlement with the Justice De
partment. And the memo that

running the F. 8.1.; and investiga
tions into various police depart
ments' corruption, brutality and
malfeasance are blossoming daily.
However, as apparent inconsis
tencies in how various laws have
been applied to special interest
groups (such as ITT, a multi
national conglomerate) surface,
the "law and order" theme seems
to have backfired on the President
in a most peculiar and unpleasant
way.
Americans got their first close
up view of the Justice Depart
ment's "new" style of "law and
order" during the Washington,
D.C. 'Mayday' antiwar demonstra
tions last spring.
There, the Metropolitan Police
Department, under the direction
of Atty. Gen. John Mitchell and
Asst Atty. Gen. Richard Kleindienst,
created what the American Civil
Liberties Union termed a "free
arrest zone" throughout large
sections of downtown Washing
ton. They arrested more than
12,000 people — may of them not
antiwar demonstrators — during
the course of the week.
In late May, some 6,000 cases
were thrown out of court in one
week; eventually fewer than 100

people were ever found guilty of
any charges. Most people were
arrested simply to "keep them off
the streets" — i.e., preserve "law
and order."
New Ball Game
But the ITT controversy, and
the nomination of Richard Klein
dienst to the Attorney General
ship, is a whole new ball game —
buying favors and influence.
How all of this came about is
well-known. The Senate Judiciary
Committee held a series of confir
mation hearings on Kleindienst's
qualifications. Nothing appeared
to be amiss — despite Klein
dienst's record as a 1964 Gold
water campaign manager and his
involvement as a leading decision
maker in determining the Justice
Department's response to the
'Mayday' demonstrations. He was
approved overwhelmingly by the
Senate committee.
Then, columnist Jack Ander
son published the controversial
memo from an ITT Washington
lobbyist that contradicted what
both Mitchell and Kleindienst
earlier had told the committee
about their relation to the ITT—
Hartford Insurance anti-trust
settlement with the Justice De
partment. And the memo that
Anderson published indicated that
a subsidiary of ITT, the Sheraton
hotel chain, was preparing to con
tribute $400,000 to the Republi
can National Convention to be
held in San Diego later this year.
Corrupt Practices Act
Under the Corrupt Practices
Act, it is illegal for "any corpora
tion whatsoever" to make a con
tribution or expenditure "in con
nection with any primary election
or political convention or caucus
held to select candidates" for
federal offices.
However, Kleindienst told the
Judiciary Committee two weeks
ago that he didn't think the al
leged $400,000 contribution (in

Ed kohn

hotel services) would be illegal
under the terms of the Act, pre
sumably because no money would
be given directly to either the
Republican National Committee
or to the President's campaign
organization.
And, in a discovery that reflects
much arrogance on ITT's part, the
Washington Post learned last week
that the offer might be withdrawn
— not because ITT considered it
illegal or was in any way pressured
to withdraw it, but because one
of the terms of the agreement
apparently stipulated that the
President was to use a new Sher?"
ton hotel as his headquarters dur
ing the convention — and the
Presidential campaign managers
apparently have yet to announce
such plans.
The ITT investigation should
come to a head within a few days.
A Judiciary subcommittee is now
in Denver interviewing the ITT
lobbyist to try to determine the
authenticity of the ITT memo and
to explore Kleindienst's involve
ment, if any, with the ITT—
Hartford Insurance merger. Also,
Sen. Mike Mansfield has promised
hearings in the near future on
other Anderson allegations that
ITT attempted to interfere in
Chile's presidential elections in
1970, in which a Marxist, obvious
ly hostile to ITT's investment in
that country, was elected.
But no matter how the hear
ings turn out, it seems doubtful
that the President will be able to
successfully exploit the "law and
order" theme in the upcoming
elections. And, whether or not the
Senate eventually approves it,
Kleindienst's nomination, like
those of Haynesworth, Carswell
and Butz, will make powerful
ammunition for Democratic con
tenders for public offices through
out the nation.

The continuing saga of
"L'Affaire ITT" ranks with the
Indochinese War, Attica, and the
Jackson and Kent State massacres
as one of the most deceptive

governmental opei&tions recently
force-fed to the American public.
Much of the groundwork for
the ITT-Justice Department-GOP
controversy was laid in 1968,

when Richard Nixon ran for the
Presidency on a well-publicized
"law and order" platform. Unfor
tunately, like his "secret plan" to
end the war in Indochina, "law
and order" proved to be a public
relations smokescreen that cover
ed up a rather remarkable lack of
definitive law-enforcement policy.
"Law and order" made a good
slogan, especially with all-Middle-
American Spiro Agnew running
for Vice President, and people
voted for the Nixon-Agnew slate.
But, like "Vietnamization,"
people still aren't sure what "law
and order" meant or means. Most
major urban crime indices are
continuing to climb at startling
rates; J. Edgar Hoover is still
running the F. 8.1.; and investiga
tions into various police depart
ments' corruption, brutality and
malfeasance are blossoming daily.
