Agnew Coming
Vice President Spiro Agnew
will address the California Repub
lican Assembly (CRA) annual
convention in Palo Alto April 8 at
the Cabana Hyatt House.
David Packard, former deputy
defense secretary, is also slated to
speak to the convention at a
luncheon at Rickey's Hyatt House
the same day. The three-day
convention begins April 7.
The "Committee for Just Re
wards," a radical group which
tried to give Packard a "Mad
Bomber of the Year Award" when
he spoke in Palo Alto last month,
will attempt to give Agnew a
"Mouthpiece of the Empire
Award."
During the convention, it is
expected that conservative mem
bers of the CRA will move to
endorse Rep. John Ashbrook
instead of President Nixon for the
Presidency this year, but the CRA
President does not believe there
are enough votes to block an
endorsement of Nixon.
Agnew is due to speak at 8 p.m.
Bazile Acquitted
Former Stanford Black Stu
dents Union Chairman, Leo
Bazile, was acquitted March 17 in
Palo Alto of charges stemming
from the April 8-9, 1971, Hospital
sit-in.
Bazile was arrested at that time
outside the scene of the sit-in and
charged with two counts of failure
to disperse, one of unlawful
assembly, and inciting to riot.
Assistant Dean of the Law
School, Thelton Henderson,
Bazile's lawyer, said he originally
asked Judge Sidney Fineberg who

tried the case, for a delay because
Henderson did not want this case
to prejudice the outcome of
Bazile's felony trial for a separate
incident in Redwood City Court.
Bazile had been charged with
assault with intent to commit
great bodily harm, and burglary
when Stanford Hospital worker,
Mary Jane Schmidt, identified
him as one of the men who had
allegedly attacked her. Bazile was
found not guilty of both charges
by a jury December 10.
Motion Denied
Palo Alto Municipal Court
Judge Sidney Feinberg denied a
pretrial motion made by attorneys
for eight persons arrested after a
disruption of Professor William
Shockley's class on Feb. 3.
The motion asked for suppres
sion of evidence obtained during
what the defense claimed were
illegal arrests.
In denying the motion, Fein
berg, ruled that "the arresting
officer had reasonable cause to
believe a misdemeanor had been
caused in his presence."
The demonstrators had entered
Shockley's class dressed in white
sheets to protest Shockley's
theories of racial genetics.
The trial is set to begin April
11.
Speech Disrupted
A debate between Stanford
professor William Shockley and
Edgar Epps, former director of
behavioral sciences at Tuskegee
Institute, scheduled to take place
at Wright College in Chicago
March 22, was cancelled due to a
sustained disruption.
The debate was to be on the

subject of race, heredity, and
intelligence.
About 30 young people, who
claimed they were members of
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS) continually shouted denun
ciations of Shockley.
Police tangled with several
demonstrators who were attempt
ing to post a sign which read
"Sterilize Shockley."
Most of the 350 members of
the audience watched silently as
Shockley was called a fascist and
compared to Hitler.
When Shockley managed to
make it to the microphone once,
he praised the First Amendment
to the Constitution, and said "It is
very unlikely that Hitler and the
Nazis could have existed if free
speech had existed in Germany.
Moratorium Continued
The Committee on Public
Events has recommended that the
current moratorium on rock con
erts in Frost Amphitheater be
continued until such time as
adequate crowd control peri
meters are installed there.
In a report submitted to Presi
dent Richard W. Lyman, the
committee said "the majority of
the problems relating to violence
and internal ecological damage
occasioned by rock concerts"
stem from the seize and type of
audience these events attract.
Present fencing around the
amphitheater is not adequate for
controlling the crowd size, the
report added.
The committee suggested fur
ther study be given the possibility
of making Frost adequate to
safely handle large crowds, with a
series of changes designed to make

it "a more physically and tech
nically attractive facility to use."
An ad hoc study headed by
John Bunker, chairman of anes
thesia, suggested that the costs for
such improvements could be paid
back through a higher fee struc
ture for use of the amphitheater
at major events. This should be
accompanied by more detailed
inquiry into the managerial capa
city of groups sponsoring pro
grams there.
Besides fencing, suggested im
provements included paved roads
and pathways, construction of a
permanent stage, installation of a
modern sound system, expanded
lavatory facilities, and purchase of
lighting and other technical equip
ment needed to make Frost
independent of other University
public facilities.
Registrar Classes
The Stanford Young Democrats
are sponsoring classes this week to
train voter registrars. The classes
started last night and will con
tinue Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. in
Tressider 275.
In addition, volunteers are
needed to register new voters on
campus, in the community, and in
San Jose on April 8.
Those wishing to attend either
class must be registered voters in
Santa Clara County. To sign up,
interested persons should call the
Registrar of Voters before 4 p.m.
or, if unregistered, they should
call 493-4486 and then register at
the class. The session will last
about two hours.
The deadline for voter registra
tion is April 13 for those wishing
to vote in the California primary.
