on-campus sales representative of
electronic systems for behavioral and
biomedical studies. These digital
systems program and present stimuli
and measure and record subject
response.
This product-line of a
well-established company has no
significant competition. An
opportunity exists to make
behavioral science investigators aware
of our apparatus.
Only one student will be selected to
represent us on campus, and will
receive a commission for each system
sold on campus. Our campus
representative can possibly step into
a full-time position following
graduation.
