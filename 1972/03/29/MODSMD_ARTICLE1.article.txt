## Jordan's Fundamental Standard 
### MARK WEAVER 
(First of two parts)
"You cannot fasten a two-thousand
dollar education to a fifty-cent boy.
The fool, the dude, and the shirk come
out of college pretty much as they
went in. They dive deep in the Pierian
springs, as the duck dives in the pond
and they come up as dry as the duck
does."
These words were fashioned by the
mind of David Starr Jordan, scientist,
peace-activist, and the first president
of Stanford from the 1890's into the
early years of the 20th century. They
came from a man who seemed to
generate awe wherever he went.
"Everyone raised his hat to him as a
custom," recalls Welton Crook, Emeri
tus Professor here. "It was accepted as
the proper thing to do. Students
looked up to the faculty in those
days." Jordan "impressed you as a
very large man," remembers E]dgar
Robinson, Emeritus Professor of His
tory here. "He had a deep, resonant
voice."
"He walked slowly, lumbered
along," adds Crook. "1 remember one
day Dr. Jordan saw me running
through the Quad. He said 'You're in a
hurry!' I told him I was late for a class

and he replied, 'I'm never in a hurry."
For a man who was never in a
hurry, David Jordan accomplished a
lot in his lifetime. It was in the Spring
of 1891 that Leland Stanford solicited
.Jordan for the first presidency of
Stanford. That appointment was only
one of a string of honors to punctuate
his life.
Butterflies and Flowers
David Starr Jordan was born in
1851. His father was a farmer of
comfortable circumstances who cared
more for poetry than agricultural
literature. Young David disliked the
labors of the farm, preferring to
collect butterflies and flowers instead.
After receiving a Ph.D. from Butler
University, he assumed a professorship
in natural history at Indiana Univer
sity. In 1885 Jordan became its
president.
During these early years, the future
president of Stanford extensively stud
ied and catalogued the fish of much of
the world. In 1881 Dr. Jordan climbed
the Matterhorn and then spent years
lecturing on the exciting event. A
popular lecturer, he often spoke about
evolution and education, and to youth
groups on morality, temperance, and
physical well-being.

As the newly appointed president of
Stanford in the early 1890's, Jordan
undertook the challenging task of
recruiting a faculty. He wrote of the
difficulties in New England, where
there were "men who nothing would
induce to go west of Springfield, and
men whose regret of their lives is that
they were born outside of Boston."
After the death of Leland Stanford,
Dr. Jordan stood by Mrs. Stanford in
her persistent fight to keep the new
university open and financially sol
vent. He was an optimist. When much
of Stanford was shaken to the ground
in the earthquake of 1906, his
colleague, Payson Treat, wondered if
he should carry out a planned trip to
Japan. The President replied, "Treat,
you go. By the time you get back we'll
have this place built back up again."
During those "six pretty long years"
he continued his ichthyological work
and became deeply involved in the
conservation movement. He helped
found the Sierra Club and was active
in the establishment of Yosemite and
Mt. Ranier National Parks.
Pacifist
Having achieved fame as an ichthy
ologist and educator, Dr. Jordan
turned his energies to the area of

international peace that was to occupy
much of his later life. In 1910 he
became the chief director of the World
Peace Foundation and spent much
time lecturing and writing on the
follies of war. He resigned the
presidency of Stanford to devote all
his time and energy to the cause.
Among the California philosopher's
awards are the Japanese Order of the
Rising Sun for his scientific work and
the Hermann Peace Prize of 1924.
During the first two decades of this
century, few were more concerned
about peace and war. Dr. Jordan wrote
such books as The Horrors of War and
War and Waste and toured the country
giving lectures such as "Is War
Eternal?" Edgar Robinson remembers
one of his lectures, saying, "I'll never
forget his closing words: 'The cost of
war comes afterwards."
In his autobiography, The Days of
A Man, Dr. Jordan wrote, "War I hold
to be in itself and under all circum
stances abhorrent — demoralizing and
ruinous to every legitimate interest of
humanity."
As the nation slid closer to war with
Germany, Jordan made repeated pleas
for reconciliation by mediation. He

travelled to Europe and conferred with
President Wilson, hoping the United
States could settle the dispute over the
conference table.
Hit 'The System'
When the war became imminent, he
complained that "the System, the
powerful organization which has its
seat in the seaboard cities — and
which, when it chooses, largely con
trols the press, the banking system,
and the financial plexus — had
virtually decided that we must enter
the war."
Soon American was in the middle of
a raging world war and Dr. Jordan
reconciled himself to the fact. "Our
country is now at war and the only
way out is forward. We must stand
together ... to advance the cause of
Democracy and hasten the coming of
lasting peace."
The peace-activist still maintained
that "All war is in itself a confession
of failure," but conceded that "True
peace cannot be gained by lying down
before aggression."
Robinson recalls walking along the
beach with Jordan one day while
Europe raged. "He was a very sad
man." After it was all over, the first
president of Stanford wrote: "I feel
really ashamed of what I said against
the war before the war was brought
on. It was so inadequate."
Militarism Protested
Militarism also contributed to Jor
dan's abhorrence of war. He protested
against "the sudden outburst of
military zeal" at Stanford and the

desire of some of the authorities to
transform the institution into an arm
of the War Department.
Yet Jordan seemed to abominate,
more than anything else, compulsory
military service. The forced participa
tion of men in international man
slaughter, he found despicable. It was
the antithesis of democracy and the
"very root of the War System." He
maintained that the training turned
soldiers into slaves, and as a conse
quence, fostered a perverted form of
patriotism expressed by "My country,
right or wrong" at the expense of
"planetary patriotism."
