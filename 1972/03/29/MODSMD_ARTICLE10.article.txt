# words vs. actions
## CJP Opinion Coercion 
### 
"Michael goldstein

The Campus Judicial Panel's
(CJP) actions, in recommending
three quarters' suspension for four
students who refused to leave a
Placement Center interview room
so recruiting for a war producer
could continue, are more impor
tant than their words and require
little comment. The words, how
ever, are also interesting, since
Professor Kaplan's opinion justify
ing that action ably demonstrates
why the university has to rely on
such heavy coercion, instead of on
"rational dialogue," to enforce its
policy.
Though there is no Disruption
Policy violation unless recruiting
interviews are an authorized uni
versity function, no one has yet
shown that Richard Lyman has
the authority to insist that our
tuition and other university re
sources be spent to aid the
recruiting work of organizations
like TRW Corporation and the
military. The quoted portion of
the trustees' bylaws contains no
such authorization.
The CJP's benefit calculation in
its cost-benefit analysis of the
disruption ignores the fact that
the people of this country cannot
stop the Indochina war unless
each of us stops whatever frag
ment of the war effort that is
being carried on in his own
community. Obviously no single
action will end the war, but this
exercise of individual and local
responsibility is what we all claim
that the German people should
have done 30 years ago.
The cost calculation in the
same analysis makes the opposite
error, since the CJP thinks an
unpunished disruption at the
Placement Center will lead to
chaos on the campus, if not order
'n Indochina. We never argued
that all conscientiously-motivated
disruptions must go unpunished,
but only that there should be no
punishment when the protesters
appear to be correct and had
exhausted other channels for
charige. Permitting truly justified
actrons hardly means that unjusti

fied ones need be tolerated.
The CJP's discussion of
"rights" and "coercion" assumes
that people have a "right" to do
any work they find rewarding,
including improving the U.S. ca
pacity to murder Asians. It also
assumes that interfering with that
"right" is more coercive than
shredding the flesh of Indochinese
children.
The CJP assumes that students
and corporations have a "right" to
use Stanford resources and facili
ties to aid their meeting each
other. Yet most of us have no
such right; we obtain jobs by
knocking on doors and writing
letters. Facilitating the recruiting
effort for the corporate giants
which can afford to send represen
tatives here has nothing to do
with anyone's rights.
The CJP was unable to punish
the protesters without arguing
that Stanford must join the rest of
the American Establishment in
ignoring international law.
The claim that the illegality of
the war is not manifest was made
only by concentrating on the
constitutionality question and for
getting the international law argu
ment.
The CJP fancies itself a pro
tector of free speech. Recruiting
may use speech, but it is the
clearest example of incitement to
action that exists, even without
using the definitions of punishable
incitement developed for Bruce
Franklin.
The pious reflections on civil
disobedience theory have an un
savory taint when they come from
men who defend the freedom of
Americans to help wage the
Indochina war, rather than the
freedom of the Indochinese to
live. Moreover, it is simply stupid
to claim that anyone who tells his
judges that he was right, and is
therefore not guilty, is a person
unprepared to take the conse
quences of his action. It is the
openness of the protest, not
silence in the face of one's
accusers, that indicates a decision

to expose oneself to possible
punishment. (Compare the exam
ple of the Catonsville Nine; do the
Berrigans also flunk Mr. Kaplan's
civil disobedience test?)
Of course the most interesting
aspect of the opinion was the fact
of its unanimous approval by the
CJP, despite its questionable
handling of controversial issues
and the imposition of such a harsh
penalty. So much for any claim
that the CJP is a fair body
reflecting the d'versity of views
existing on this campus.
