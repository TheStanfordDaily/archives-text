Advocates
Editor, THE DAILY:
The growing student commitment at Stanford to the formation of
Citizens Advocates at Stanford, Inc. should be encouraging to all
citizens interested in developing knowledgeable citizenship. The
hardworking and idealistic students leading this effort know that
building the institutions of citizen research and action is the basic
pioneering need in this country. Other students in Southern California
in the San Diego area have already approved a similar plan. Students
in 9 other states will have public interest advocates working for them
next year to attempt to advance the forces of genuine progress and
iustice in helping to solve serious problems besetting many Americans
and the nation.
Many students today want to correct injustices and apply the
resources and intelligence in the nation to the enormous problems
that prevail now and which will loom even larger in the future.
Everyone knows about these problems such as poverty, unemploy
ment, discrimination, pollution, consumer injustice, threat of war,
concentration of power in fewer corporations and larger governments
and the growing futility of the dollar to respond to the people's needs.
Students can do something about these problems while they are
students. They can research them, develop strategies for change and
participate in their implementation. This is the most intensive
educational experience for it (Jjallenges the intellect and the value
system of the student in tandem and motivates effort and dedication.
One of the main purposes of education is to develop the capacity and
will to be effective citizens, whatever their respective value systems
may be.
A diversity of viewpoints indeed renews and invigorates responsible
citizenship. What is needed is a student directed institution which will
act as a catalyst for opportunities which students can take hold of and
direct toward problem solving. Before most forums of decision
making—government, corporate or union—special interests are well
represented but the public or broad citizen interest is not.
The establishment of Citizens Advocates at Stanford, Inc. would
provide students with an effective professional voice before these
forums and enlist enormous student participation, by way of research,
laboratory testing, and other skills both during the school year and
during summer vacations. Citizenship experience should be an integral
part of educational attainments.
It is hoped that students will support the Citizens Advocates at
Stanford, Inc. and help create a constructive and dynamic force for
good in the state of California.
