## The 						Future Of The University 
### 
larry diamond

There is no problem that besets
a serious political leader more
persistently than that of doubt
doubt not only about the wisdom
of his or her positions and
decisions, but doubt as well about
the very focus of his attention and
energy.
I remain deeply opposed to
Administration policy on recruit
ment standards at the Placement
Center and on the structure of the
student judicial system. I am more
than ever convinced that the firing
of Bruce Franklin was a dangerous
and tragic precedent in its implica
tions for academic freedom.
But I am coming to doubt
seriously the worth of beating
these kinds of issues to death with
the style of ultimatum politics
that has come to envelop them.
We cannot afford to have so
disproportionate an amount of
the attention of the community,
and the time and energy of its
leaders in the student body,
faculty, and administration, spent
on issues and problems important
in a moral or symbolic sense, but
peripheral to the question of the
quality of the University and the
direction of its future.
We cannot afford to because
there are issues that are very
central to this latter question, and
in the rush of rhetoric and
demands and disruptions and
subsequent prosecutions, we
aren't dealing with them. In fact, I
suspect most of us aren't even
conscious of them.
As a community, together, we
need desperately to start thinking
and talking about them.
What are these long term crises
that cloud the University's future?
For one, we are in a financial
crisis of tremendous proportions.
Anyone whose department or
program has felt the cutting blade
of BAP is painfully aware of this.
Students and applicants who are
neither rich enough to meet with
ease the soaring costs of a
Stanford education, nor poor
enough to qualify for large

scholarships, are painfully aware
of this. Administrators who have
had to compromise the autonomy
of the University in order to keep
it afloat financially are painfully
aware of this.
My view is that we can never
hope to resolve this crisis without
a massive infusion of federal aid.
In fact, one of the great issues for
American universities is now
being battled in the Congress; the
nature and extent of that aid.
A bill sponsored by Rep. Edith
Green, and passed by the House,
would offer aid to universities and
colleges in the form of a block
grant to the institution based on
its annual number of credit hours.
By using credit hours in the
formula with which to compute
the amount of federal aid, this bill
would encourage schools to grant
credit for almost anything imagin
able in order to get more federal
dollars. But, more ominously, by
offering the aid in the form of a
block grant (an annually flowing
faucet that could conceivably be
turned off as easily as it is left on)
the door is opened for accom
panying federal control.
Temptation
The temptation for the govern
ment to attach restrictions on
how the money can be spent—and
on what a school must do or not
do in order to qualify for it —is
enormous. The Green Bill is an
invitation to a kind of federal
intimidation more potent than
anything higher education has yet
been subjected to. It must be
defeated.
Now lodged with the Green Bill
in a House-Senate conference
committee is a bill passed by the
Senate and sponsored by Sen.
John Pastore. It is vitally impor
tant to the future of this Univer
sity.
The Pastore bill provides for a
program of federal aid which is
focused on the individual student
rather than on the school. The aid
is offered directly to the student
to carry with him to whichever

college or university he chooses.
With his own aid, the student on
the graduate level carries with him
to the school of his choice a
companion grant to the school to
defray the costs of educating him.
Decentralizing
This bill offers financial aid to
colleges and universities in a form
to which intimidating restrictions
cannot very easily be applied. It
decentralizes the giving of aid, and
emphasizes the role of the student
as consumer. By giving the aid to
the student to take to whichever
school he chooses, the Pell bill
provides "competitive incentives
for evolutionary reform" that will
make each institution more attrac
tive.
If we are going to be able to be
a leading creative force in higher
education in the coming years, we
are going to need more money.
Millions more. As an institution,
we are going to have to start
thinking about how we are going
to get it.
Aid
I think we will conclude that,
no matter how valiant an effort
we make in raising contributions
from alumni and other private
sources, we will not meet our
needs, and no matter how un
reasonably high we raise tuition,
we will not meet our needs,
without massive federal aid.
We must understand that the
sources of and solutions to many
of our problems are not internal
to the University. If we are to win
the adoption of a federal aid
program of the form and scope so
urgently needed, we will have to
affect national policy.
If we are to change the chief
source of research funding from
the Defense Department to civil
iam agencies, and if we are to
change the focus of federal
funding for University research
away from meeting military needs
and more towards meeting the
human and environmental needs
of this country, we will have to
affect national policy.

And if we are to establish the
kinds of close working relation
ships with other Universities that
can make possible more coordi
nated national research into
social, political, and environ
mental problems (using the re
sources and enthusiasm that
Universities possess in such special
abundance), it will mean organiza
tion and cooperation on a na
tional level.
It would be dangerous to
imagine that in action on a
national level lie the solutions to
all our problems. But the present
danger lies in our assumption that
there are no solutions to be
achieved on that level at all.
Despite the questions and sharp
disagreements over his internal
positions, Richard Lyman can be
an important leader in arguing the
case for colleges and universities
in America.
I believe he is willing to move
toward the key national role he is
capable of. But he is now unable
to, and will remain so, as long as
one flash crisis after another
deflects his time and attention so

completely away from larger
problems.
A nation in times of interna
tional crisis very often rallies
around its president, supporting
his foreign policy iniatives even
while it may differ bitterly over
his domestic ones.
Stanford is now in a com
parable kind of crisis from with
out, and it is time for people here
with a wide range of political
perspectives to follow this histori
cal precedent and give our own
president the support he needs in
forging a "foreign policy" for the
institution that will relieve its
financial crisis, reclaim the sub
stantial degree of autonomy it has
lost, and strike new working
relationships with other Univer
sities that will move them all into
a role of greater leadership and
innovation in the quest for solu
tions to the social and ecological
problems that plague the nation.

turned off as easily as it is left on)
the door is opened for accom
panying federal control.
Temptation
The temptation for the govern
ment to attach restrictions on
how the money can be spent—and
on what a school must do or not
do in order to qualify for it —is
enormous. The Green Bill is an
invitation to a kind of federal
intimidation more potent than
anything higher education has yet
been subjected to. It must be
defeated.
Now lodged with the Green Bill
in a House-Senate conference
committee is a bill passed by the
Senate and sponsored by Sen.
John Pastore. It is vitally impor
tant to the future of this Univer
sity.
The Pastore bill provides for a
program of federal aid which is
focused on the individual student
rather than on the school. The aid
is offered directly to the student
to carry with him to whichever

college or university he chooses.
With his own aid, the student on
the graduate level carries with him
to the school of his choice a
companion grant to the school to
defray the costs of educating him.
Decentralizing
This bill offers financial aid to
colleges and universities in a form
to which intimidating restrictions
cannot very easily be applied. It
decentralizes the giving of aid, and
emphasizes the role of the student
as consumer. By giving the aid to
the student to take to whichever
school he chooses, the Pell bill
provides "competitive incentives
for evolutionary reform" that will
make each institution more attrac
tive.
If we are going to be able to be
a leading creative force in higher
education in the coming years, we
are going to need more money.
Millions more. As an institution,
we are going to have to start
thinking about how we are going
to get it.
Aid
I think we will conclude that,
no matter how valiant an effort
we make in raising contributions
from alumni and other private
sources, we will not meet our
needs, and no matter how un
reasonably high we raise tuition,
we will not meet our needs,
without massive federal aid.
We must understand that the
sources of and solutions to many
of our problems are not internal
to the University. If we are to win
the adoption of a federal aid
program of the form and scope so
urgently needed, we will have to
affect national policy.
If we are to change the chief
source of research funding from
the Defense Department to civil
iam agencies, and if we are to
change the focus of federal
funding for University research
away from meeting military needs
and more towards meeting the
human and environmental needs
of this country, we will have to
affect national policy.

And if we are to establish the
kinds of close working relation
ships with other Universities that
can make possible more coordi
nated national research into
social, political, and environ
mental problems (using the re
sources and enthusiasm that
Universities possess in such special
abundance), it will mean organiza
tion and cooperation on a na
tional level.
It would be dangerous to
imagine that in action on a
national level lie the solutions to
all our problems. But the present
danger lies in our assumption that
there are no solutions to be
achieved on that level at all.
Despite the questions and sharp
disagreements over his internal
positions, Richard Lyman can be
an important leader in arguing the
case for colleges and universities
in America.
I believe he is willing to move
toward the key national role he is
capable of. But he is now unable
to, and will remain so, as long as
one flash crisis after another
deflects his time and attention so

completely away from larger
problems.
A nation in times of interna
tional crisis very often rallies
around its president, supporting
his foreign policy iniatives even
while it may differ bitterly over
his domestic ones.
Stanford is now in a com
parable kind of crisis from with
out, and it is time for people here
with a wide range of political
perspectives to follow this histori
cal precedent and give our own
president the support he needs in
forging a "foreign policy" for the
institution that will relieve its
financial crisis, reclaim the sub
stantial degree of autonomy it has
lost, and strike new working
relationships with other Univer
sities that will move them all into
a role of greater leadership and
innovation in the quest for solu
tions to the social and ecological
problems that plague the nation.

There is no problem that besets
a serious political leader more
persistently than that of doubt
doubt not only about the wisdom
of his or her positions and
decisions, but doubt as well about
the very focus of his attention and
energy.
I remain deeply opposed to
Administration policy on recruit
ment standards at the Placement
Center and on the structure of the
student judicial system. I am more
than ever convinced that the firing
of Bruce Franklin was a dangerous
and tragic precedent in its implica
tions for academic freedom.
But I am coming to doubt
seriously the worth of beating
these kinds of issues to death with
the style of ultimatum politics
that has come to envelop them.
We cannot afford to have so
disproportionate an amount of
the attention of the community,
and the time and energy of its
leaders in the student body,
faculty, and administration, spent
on issues and problems important
in a moral or symbolic sense, but
peripheral to the question of the
quality of the University and the
direction of its future.
We cannot afford to because
there are issues that are very
central to this latter question, and
in the rush of rhetoric and
demands and disruptions and
subsequent prosecutions, we
aren't dealing with them. In fact, I
suspect most of us aren't even
conscious of them.
As a community, together, we
need desperately to start thinking
and talking about them.
What are these long term crises
that cloud the University's future?
For one, we are in a financial
crisis of tremendous proportions.
Anyone whose department or
program has felt the cutting blade
of BAP is painfully aware of this.
Students and applicants who are
neither rich enough to meet with
ease the soaring costs of a
Stanford education, nor poor
enough to qualify for large

scholarships, are painfully aware
of this. Administrators who have
had to compromise the autonomy
of the University in order to keep
it afloat financially are painfully
aware of this.
My view is that we can never
hope to resolve this crisis without
a massive infusion of federal aid.
In fact, one of the great issues for
American universities is now
being battled in the Congress; the
nature and extent of that aid.
A bill sponsored by Rep. Edith
Green, and passed by the House,
would offer aid to universities and
colleges in the form of a block
grant to the institution based on
its annual number of credit hours.
By using credit hours in the
formula with which to compute
the amount of federal aid, this bill
would encourage schools to grant
credit for almost anything imagin
able in order to get more federal
dollars. But, more ominously, by
offering the aid in the form of a
block grant (an annually flowing
faucet that could conceivably be
turned off as easily as it is left on)
the door is opened for accom

institution that will relieve its
financial crisis, reclaim the sub

There is no problem that besets
a serious political leader more
persistently than that of doubt
doubt not only about the wisdom
of his or her positions and
decisions, but doubt as well about
the very focus of his attention and
energy.
I remain deeply opposed to
Administration policy on recruit
ment standards at the Placement
Center and on the structure of the
student judicial system. I am more
than ever convinced that the firing
of Bruce Franklin was a dangerous
and tragic precedent in its implica
tions for academic freedom.
But I am coming to doubt
seriously the worth of beating
these kinds of issues to death with
the style of ultimatum politics
that has come to envelop them.
We cannot afford to have so
disproportionate an amount of
the attention of the community,
and the time and energy of its
leaders in the student body,
faculty, and administration, spent
on issues and problems important
in a moral or symbolic sense, but
peripheral to the question of the
quality of the University and the
direction of its future.
We cannot afford to because
there are issues that are very
central to this latter question, and
in the rush of rhetoric and
demands and disruptions and
subsequent prosecutions, we
aren't dealing with them. In fact, I
suspect most of us aren't even
conscious of them.
As a community, together, we
need desperately to start thinking
and talking about them.
What are these long term crises
that cloud the University's future?
For one, we are in a financial
crisis of tremendous proportions.
Anyone whose department or
program has felt the cutting blade
of BAP is painfully aware of this.
Students and applicants who are
neither rich enough to meet with
ease the soaring costs of a
Stanford education, nor poor
enough to qualify for large

scholarships, are painfully aware
of this. Administrators who have
had to compromise the autonomy
of the University in order to keep
it afloat financially are painfully
aware of this.
My view is that we can never
hope to resolve this crisis without
a massive infusion of federal aid.
In fact, one of the great issues for
American universities is now
being battled in the Congress; the
nature and extent of that aid.
A bill sponsored by Rep. Edith
Green, and passed by the House,
would offer aid to universities and
colleges in the form of a block
grant to the institution based on
its annual number of credit hours.
By using credit hours in the
formula with which to compute
the amount of federal aid, this bill
would encourage schools to grant
credit for almost anything imagin
able in order to get more federal
dollars. But, more ominously, by
offering the aid in the form of a
block grant (an annually flowing
faucet that could conceivably be
turned off as easily as it is left on)
the door is opened for accom
panying federal control.
Temptation
The temptation for the govern
ment to attach restrictions on
how the money can be spent—and
on what a school must do or not
do in order to qualify for it —is
enormous. The Green Bill is an
invitation to a kind of federal
intimidation more potent than
anything higher education has yet
been subjected to. It must be
defeated.
Now lodged with the Green Bill
in a House-Senate conference
committee is a bill passed by the
Senate and sponsored by Sen.
John Pastore. It is vitally impor
tant to the future of this Univer
sity.
The Pastore bill provides for a
program of federal aid which is
focused on the individual student
rather than on the school. The aid
is offered directly to the student
to carry with him to whichever

college or university he chooses.
With his own aid, the student on
the graduate level carries with him
to the school of his choice a
companion grant to the school to
defray the costs of educating him.
Decentralizing
This bill offers financial aid to
colleges and universities in a form
to which intimidating restrictions
cannot very easily be applied. It
decentralizes the giving of aid, and
emphasizes the role of the student
as consumer. By giving the aid to
the student to take to whichever
school he chooses, the Pell bill
provides "competitive incentives
for evolutionary reform" that will
make each institution more attrac
tive.
If we are going to be able to be
a leading creative force in higher
education in the coming years, we
are going to need more money.
Millions more. As an institution,
we are going to have to start
thinking about how we are going
to get it.
Aid
I think we will conclude that,
no matter how valiant an effort
we make in raising contributions
from alumni and other private
sources, we will not meet our
needs, and no matter how un
reasonably high we raise tuition,
we will not meet our needs,
without massive federal aid.
We must understand that the
sources of and solutions to many
of our problems are not internal
to the University. If we are to win
the adoption of a federal aid
program of the form and scope so
urgently needed, we will have to
affect national policy.
If we are to change the chief
source of research funding from
the Defense Department to civil
iam agencies, and if we are to
change the focus of federal
funding for University research
away from meeting military needs
and more towards meeting the
human and environmental needs
of this country, we will have to
affect national policy.

And if we are to establish the
kinds of close working relation
ships with other Universities that
can make possible more coordi
nated national research into
social, political, and environ
mental problems (using the re
sources and enthusiasm that
Universities possess in such special
abundance), it will mean organiza
