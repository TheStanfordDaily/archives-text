# Primary Defeats Stun Daley
## 
### JIM WASCHER News Analysis 
Last Tuesday's Illinois primary
election showed that Chicago
Mayor Richard J. Daley's vaunted
Cook County "Machine" is filially
on its last legs. The "Machine"
suffered two major, stunning
defeats and a score of minor ones.
The fall was sudden for Haley,
the last of the big city bosses, who
only last April had been over
whelmingly elected to an unpre

cedented fifth four-year term as
mayor and who has been chair
man of the powerful Cook
County Democratic Central Com
mittee since 1953.
In the race for the Democratic
nomination for governor, Daley
and his cronies had slated Lieuten
ant Governor Paul Simon, a
one-time independent who had
actively sought that slating.
Simon was presumed to be
immensely popular in the Down
state areas outside Cook County.
It was also widely assumed that
Daley's "Machine" could deliver a
minimum of several hundred
thousand votes in the city of
Chicago and that a combination of
the two would sweep Simon to an
easy victory.
Anti-Machine Candidate
Battling against Simon was
anti-Machine candidate Dan
Walker, who had resigned his
$ 118,000-a-year job as Vice Presi
dent and General Counsel of
Montgomery Ward and Co. to run.
In 1968, he had authored the
famed "Walker Report" which
castigated the Mayor and his
police for their handling of the
1968 Democratic National Con
vention disturbances.
Last summer, for four months,
Walker and two of his sons walked
a 1,197 mile zig-zag up the state
to Chicago in the style of his
friend, U.S. Senator Lawton M.
Chiles (Dem.-Fla.). Chiles had
won his seat in 1970 using two
similar walks. The walk gained
Walker wide publicity and a
Downstate base of support.
A record turn-out of 1.4
million voters on primary day
provided Walker with a 45,000
vote victory in what Walker called
"the biggest political upset any
where since 1948." Simon was
only able to get a low 55% of the
vote in Chicago. All that a
shocked Mayor Daley could do

was joke that "1 don't take any
walks." Now Walker, and not
Daley, must be viewed as the
leader of the state's Democratic
Party.
State's Attorney's Race
In the Cook County State's
(District) Attorney's race, incum
bent Edward V. Hanrahan was
first slated by the Daley
"Machine" and then dumped.

Daley had been frightened when
Hanrahan's indictment for con
spiracy to obstruct justice was
upheld by the state's Supreme
Court. The indictment came for
Hanrahan's part in blocking the
investigation of the killings of two
Black Panthers by State's
Attorney's police in December
1969.
Hanrahan decided to buck the

"Machine" and run without its
support. Daley chose Supervising
Traffic Court Judge Raymond K.
Berg to run in Hanrahan's place
on the "Machine" slate. Also
running was independent attorney
Donald Page Moore, a former
assistant to Attorney General
Robert Kennedy.
In spite of his not having
"Machine" backing, Hanrahan
won the primary handily with
42% of the vote while Berg and
Moore received 30% and 28%
respectively. Hanrahan got 37% of
the vote in Daley's own ward. The
State's Attorney is now in a
strong position to challenge
Daley's control of the party in
Cook County itself.
Independent Democrats
In seven hotly contested races
for state representative or senator
from Chicago, independent Demo
crats beat the "Machine" in six
and came close in the seventh.
Even playwright Tennessee
Williams' brother, the token op
ponent of Daley's candidate for
U.S. Senator (Congressman
Roman C. Pucinski) received a full
30%. of the vote after an un
noticed non-campaign.
The returns from top to bot
tom on the ballot demonstrate
what dire straits Mayor Daley and
his "Machine" are indeed in. The
diminishing of Daley's power
locally can only reduce his posi
tion nationally as a kingmaker of
Presidents.
As Chicago Daily News column
ist Mike Royko commented: "On
Wednesday morning voters were
looking at each other all over
Illinois and marveling at what
they had done. They had kicked
the hell out of city hall just by
walking in and voting, as they
were taught to do in high school
civics. Now that they've seen how
easy it is, they'll probably do it
again."


ILLINOIS WINNER Dei icratic j rial nominee Dan Walker (left) and his sons Dan, Jr. (center)
and Charles are picluml on theii !,l')7-mile walk of the state last summer. Walker's victory last week
indicates trouble afoot for the Daley "Machine" in Chicago which may be on its last legs.
