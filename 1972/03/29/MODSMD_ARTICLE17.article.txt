# Football Future Bright
## Spring Recruiting A Success 
### MIKE CHASSON 
Stanford's football future looked bright as the
Pacific Eight released last Friday the list of
student-athletes who had signed letters of intent
with the conference on or before March 16.
"I'm veiy happy with the recruiting" said head
coach Jack Christiansen after he had looked over
the names of the 24 players who had signed a letter
of intent favoring Stanford.
Christiansen labled this year as one of the best
recruiting years that he's seen while at Stanford.
Christiansen stated "There are probably five
outstanding quarterbacks who have not yet signed a
letter of intent. We're in the process of recruiting at
least four of them."
Christiansen was very pleased that "13 or 14
prize players" were headed for Stanford. He believes
that Stanford has a chance of getting four or five
more, plus three or four outstanding junior college
players in the fall.
Of those signing letters of intent with Stanford all
but one will be present at the opening of spring
practice April 8. Christiansen gave the following
thumbnail sketches of some of the prominent
players who indicated they would come to
Stanford:
Ray Anderson, 5-11, 180-pound running back
from La Verne's Bonita High: "He's the Miles
Moore, type. He was a quarterback in high school,
but has indicated to us he wants to be a receiver. He
could be real outstanding."
Todd Anderson, 6-4, 240 pound offensive tackle
from Ventura: "Todd is a big tackle, but we might
use him at center. He was picked to play in this
summer's Shrine game in Los Angeles. We think
he'll be a great asset."
Dick Atwater, Long Beach City College: "He's a
linebacker who goes about 6 feet, 210. He's the
same type of player as Mike Simone was for us last
year. A little on the small side, but a real fighter. He
was voted the most inspirational player on the Long
Beach team and we look for that kind of leadership
to continue at Stanford."
Joe Baumgaertner, 5-11, 180-pound running back
from Glendora's Damien High: "Joe was one of the
five or six best backs in the Los Angeles area,
according to our people down there. He could be
outstanding for us, but he's also been recruited
heavily by Rice and Rice still thinks it has a good
shot at him."
Mike Cummins, 6-2, 210-pounder from Bakers

field's North High: "Mike is another one picked to
the Shrine game and one of the best linebackers ever
developed in the Bakersfield area. Some people
compare him favorably to Jeff Siemon, our
All-American linebacker last year who also grew up
in Bakersfield."
Doug Jena, 6-2, 190-pound running back from El
Camino JC: "Doug just might well have been the
best junior college running back in the nation last
year. He had a couple of games where he gained
close to 200 yards, has outstanding speed -about 10
flat for the 100—and is a great blocker. And he can
catch the ball, too. We're very happy he chose
Stanford. Very happy."
Dave Ottmar, 6-3, 210-pound quarterback from
Gavilan College in Gilroy: "Dave has a strong arm
and is a very intelligent boy. He's in good position
to battle Mike Boryla and Jim Wise for the starting
job."
A 1 Tenbruggencate, 6-4, 260-pounder from San
Francisco's Riordan High: "A 1 is a prize catch,
probably the best high school lineman in Northern
California. He'll either be an offensive or defensive
lineman, but you can bet he'll be playing
somewhere. He's a wildcat, just a fantastic player."
Christiansen will open spring practice on April 8
with an expected attendance of 80 to 90 players,
excluding the seniors who aren't obligated to report
until the following week.
