## 
### DOUG WILSON 
The University of Washington
kept the Stanford gymnastics
team from travelling as a unit to
next week's NCAA gymnastics
championship in Ames, lowa, by
seventy-five hundredths of a point
at the Pacific-8 Conference meet
in Pullman last Friday.
Nobody, however, could stop
Stanford's Steve Hug from captur
ing the all-around title at the
meet; the Stanford Olympian not
only ammassed the highest point
total of 103.25, but managed to
qualify in three events to lead
Pacific-8 contenders at the NCAA
tourney in Ames.
California, as is becoming usual,
won the team title over Washing
ton, 154.090-148.075. However,
the Bears are ineligible for the
NCAA meet because of an admini
strative oversight involving the
participation of Isaac Curtis on
the Cal football squad; conse

quently, runner-up Washington
will travel as a squad to represent
the Pacific-8 as a contender for
the national team title. In addi
tion, the top three finishers in
each event at the Pullman meet
will travel to Ames for the NCAA
championships.
The Huskies earned the trip
with a dramatic point-count vic
tory over the Indians. Following
Thursday's compulsory events,
Stanford was 2.15 points behind
Washington; despite brilliant per
formances in the optional events,
the Stanford gymnasts were un
able to overcome the deficit, and
placed third in the meet "with
148.00 points.
Coach Dan Mill man will send
three of his top performers to
Ames, however; Hug, rings per
former Howard Bessen, and floor
exercise performer Bob Anderson,
who qualified as a substitute
representative in that event. Hug

qualified third in the pommel
horse event, tying with Washing
ton's Norm Ewald; both per
formers had overall (compulsory
optional) scores of 8.4875. In
Friday's optional performance,
however, Hug scored the evening's
highest point total, with a routine
that brought an ovation from the
crowd and a 9.45 score.
Hug also placed second in the
parallel bars event (8.9125) and
won the horizontal bar with an
amazing 9.0125 performance. The
Stanford sophomore managed op
tional scores of nine or better in
all three events, as well as in the
Friday night session of floor
exercise.
Stanford's Howard Bessen was
the second performer of the meet
to amass an over-nine score in an
event—the first was the gymnast
who defeated him for the Pac-8
rings title, Barney Peters of Cal.
Bessen's Friday night optional
performance garnered 9.15 points;
his overall total was 8.8375.
Stanford freshman Bob Ander
son placed fourth in the floor
exercise event, with an 8.525
point total; as Berkeley perform
ers swept the event, however,
Anderson won the top substitute
spot for the Ames meet.

three of his top performers to
Ames, however; Hug, rings per
former Howard Bessen, and floor
exercise performer Bob Anderson,
who qualified as a substitute
representative in that event. Hug

qualified third in the pommel
horse event, tying with Washing
ton's Norm Ewald; both per
formers had overall (compulsory
optional) scores of 8.4875. In
Friday's optional performance,
however, Hug scored the evening's
highest point total, with a routine
that brought an ovation from the
crowd and a 9.45 score.
Hug also placed second in the
parallel bars event (8.9125) and
won the horizontal bar with an
amazing 9.0125 performance. The
Stanford sophomore managed op
tional scores of nine or better in
all three events, as well as in the
Friday night session of floor
exercise.
Stanford's Howard Bessen was
the second performer of the meet
to amass an over-nine score in an
event—the first was the gymnast
who defeated him for the Pac-8
rings title, Barney Peters of Cal.
Bessen's Friday night optional
performance garnered 9.15 points;
his overall total was 8.8375.
Stanford freshman Bob Ander
son placed fourth in the floor
exercise event, with an 8.525
point total; as Berkeley perform
ers swept the event, however,
Anderson won the top substitute
spot for the Ames meet.
The University of Washington
kept the Stanford gymnastics
team from travelling as a unit to
next week's NCAA gymnastics
championship in Ames, lowa, by
seventy-five hundredths of a point
at the Pacific-8 Conference meet
in Pullman last Friday.
Nobody, however, could stop
Stanford's Steve Hug from captur
ing the all-around title at the
meet; the Stanford Olympian not
only ammassed the highest point
total of 103.25, but managed to
qualify in three events to lead
Pacific-8 contenders at the NCAA
tourney in Ames.
California, as is becoming usual,
won the team title over Washing
ton, 154.090-148.075. However,
the Bears are ineligible for the
NCAA meet because of an admini
strative oversight involving the
participation of Isaac Curtis on
the Cal football squad; conse

quently, runner-up Washington
will travel as a squad to represent
the Pacific-8 as a contender for
the national team title. In addi
tion, the top three finishers in
each event at the Pullman meet
will travel to Ames for the NCAA
championships.
The Huskies earned the trip
with a dramatic point-count vic
tory over the Indians. Following
Thursday's compulsory events,
Stanford was 2.15 points behind
Washington; despite brilliant per
formances in the optional events,
the Stanford gymnasts were un
able to overcome the deficit, and
placed third in the meet "with
148.00 points.
Coach Dan Mill man will send
three of his top performers to
