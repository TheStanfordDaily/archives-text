# Room Rate Increase
## 
### GARY ATKINS 
Tuition probably won't be the only
thing going up next year.
This week, the Room and Board
Task Force, a student-staff committee
charged with studying room and board
rates, is finalizing its recommendations
on increasing those rates next fall. And
its report, which is scheduled for
release some time next week, is
expected to recommend an increase of
between $45 and $65 per year in room
and board as well as a reduction in
food services.
Details are not being released until
the Task Force completes its delibera
tions in meetings being held today and
Friday, but, according to Ed Scoles,
Director of Housing and Food Services
and chairman of the committee, the
recommendations will be in accord
with the results of a poll of dorm
students taken in February.
That poll indicated that students on
boarding plans preferred an increase of
between $45 and $65 coupled with a
reduction in food services to the larger
increase which, according to the
committee, would be needed to
maintain or expand present services.
Even with the smalier increase,
room and board would rise — for the
second year in a row — from its
present $1295 per year to between
$1340 and $1360 per year. Last fall,
the rate rose seven percent from
$1210 to $1295. This year, if the
committee adheres to the guidelines in
the poll, the increase will be between
three and five percent.
And, for the first time, significant
reductions in food services will be
recommended in order to keep the
increase down. In the past, cuts have
been made primarily in the room end
of room and board by curtailing such
things as maid service and grounds
maintenance — and the individual rates

have reflected it, with board increasing
more rapidly than room. Between
1966 and 1971, for example, room
rates rose $30; board rates, $125.
Possible areas of reduction in food
services suggested in the poll include:
—replacing seated service in Lagu
nita Court and Roble Hall with a
cafeteria, saving $13,200 per year;
—serving only brunch and dinner on
Saturday (as is done on Sunday),
saving $9,000 per year; and
-serving both the proposed Satur
day and the Sunday brunch in only
three residence halls instead of in all of
the dorms, reducing the need to serve
in several cafeterias and saving
$37,400 per year.
In its preliminary conclusions fol
lowing the poll, the committee said
that with the adoption of the brunch
proposals, the room and board rate
could be set at about $1345 for
1972-73. Whether the committee has
retained that figure in its final report
will not be known until next week.
The committee's recommendations
will be sent to the Vice President for
Business and Finance and the Dean of
Students and finally to the Board of
Trustees for approval.

ROOM AND BORED—Students may get steamed up next fall when they see
how much Stanford raised its room and board rates in order to iron out some of
its money problems.
