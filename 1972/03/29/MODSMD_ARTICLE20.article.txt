# Netters Ranked Third In Nation

### DAVE ANTONUCCIO 
The Stanford racketmen are
gunning for a national champion
ship this season and they may
have the manpower to pull it off.
Finishing fifth in the NCAA last
year the Indians sport a better
team with much greater depth
than last year's squad.
"I am really pleased and
impressed with the depth on the
team. There are ten to twelve
good players that 1 have great
confidence in to win
consistently," commented tennis
coach Duk Gould.
Stanford had a chance to show
off its depth in the form of a 9-0
victory over San Jose State three
weekends ago. Coach Gould took
six of his top players to the
Pacific Coast Sectional Doubles at
La Jolla, while the remainder of
the squad blanked San Jose. Gery
Groslimond, displayed top form
by defeating Carlos Kumayer,
recently crowned Northern
California Intercollegiate
champion and Brazilian Junior
Davis Cup star, in the number one
singles.
Stanford also took the
Northern California
Intercollegiate Championship,
held at San Jose State, just
another indication of the tribe's
power. Roscoe Tanner and Alex

Mayer, defending champs for
1970 and 1971 respectively,
bowed out of this tournament to
give the other players on the team
more experience. Impressive
performances were turned in by
Paul Sidone and Rick Evans, who
each reached the semi-finals in
singles competition. Freshman
Jim Delaney played well enroute
to the finals.
Delaney is one of three talented
Stanford freshmen who represent
seven major national titles. Chip
Fisher was a National Junior
Doubles Champion in 1971 and a
National Boys Doubles Champion
in 1969. Jim Delaney teamed with
him in those two victories and was
also a winner of the National
Junior-Indoor Singles and Doubles
Championships in 1971. James
"Chico" Hagey was the 1969
National Boys Singles Champion.
All three were members of the
1971 U.S. Junior Davis Cup
Team.
Tim Noonan, a promising
sophomore from Springfield, Ohio
has been playing good tennis and
the doubles combination of
Noonan and Hagey faired well in
the Nor Cal tourney.
Another indication that tennis
mentor Gould is building a
dynasty is the fact that there are
no seniors in the current top
eight. Furthermore, Stan Passarell,

last year's number 4 player, is the
only player who didn't return
from last year's squad.
Stanford is favored to dump
UCLA, the NCAA champion for
the last two years. A Stanford
victory over UCLA will be the
first in the past 30 seasons.
According to "Tennis West"
magazine Stanford is ranked third
in the nation behind USC and
Trinity University.
In recruiting, Stanford has hurt
USC and UCLA. "We recruited
three of the top four U.S. citizen
tennis players. Southern Cal
acquired Mexican Davis Cupper
Raul Ramirez," said Gould.
"We get better every year, and
we'll be better next year," added
the coach. Certainly, because of
Stanford's depth and efficient
recruiting, a national
championship is definitely within
reach.

There will be a meeting for all
intramural managers today at 4
p.m. in room 350 of Encina Gym.
Competition will be held this
quarter in the following sports:
badmitton, gymnastics, horse
shoes, Softball, swimming and
diving, singles tennis, track and
field, six-man volleyball, water
polo and bowling. There will also
be an intramural bike race this (
quarter.

championship is definitely within
reach.

There will be a meeting for all
intramural managers today at 4
p.m. in room 350 of Encina Gym.
Competition will be held this
quarter in the following sports:
badmitton, gymnastics, horse
shoes, Softball, swimming and
diving, singles tennis, track and
field, six-man volleyball, water
polo and bowling. There will also
be an intramural bike race this (
quarter.
The Stanford racketmen are
gunning for a national champion
ship this season and they may
have the manpower to pull it off.
Finishing fifth in the NCAA last
year the Indians sport a better
team with much greater depth
than last year's squad.
"I am really pleased and
impressed with the depth on the
team. There are ten to twelve
good players that 1 have great
confidence in to win
consistently," commented tennis
coach Duk Gould.
Stanford had a chance to show
off its depth in the form of a 9-0
victory over San Jose State three
weekends ago. Coach Gould took
six of his top players to the
Pacific Coast Sectional Doubles at
La Jolla, while the remainder of
the squad blanked San Jose. Gery
Groslimond, displayed top form
by defeating Carlos Kumayer,
recently crowned Northern
California Intercollegiate
champion and Brazilian Junior
Davis Cup star, in the number one
singles.
Stanford also took the
Northern California
Intercollegiate Championship,
held at San Jose State, just
another indication of the tribe's
power. Roscoe Tanner and Alex

Mayer, defending champs for
1970 and 1971 respectively,
bowed out of this tournament to
give the other players on the team
more experience. Impressive
performances were turned in by
Paul Sidone and Rick Evans, who
each reached the semi-finals in
singles competition. Freshman
Jim Delaney played well enroute
to the finals.
Delaney is one of three talented
Stanford freshmen who represent
seven major national titles. Chip
Fisher was a National Junior
Doubles Champion in 1971 and a
National Boys Doubles Champion
in 1969. Jim Delaney teamed with
him in those two victories and was
also a winner of the National
Junior-Indoor Singles and Doubles
Championships in 1971. James
"Chico" Hagey was the 1969
National Boys Singles Champion.
All three were members of the
1971 U.S. Junior Davis Cup
Team.
Tim Noonan, a promising
sophomore from Springfield, Ohio
has been playing good tennis and
the doubles combination of
Noonan and Hagey faired well in
the Nor Cal tourney.
Another indication that tennis
mentor Gould is building a
dynasty is the fact that there are
no seniors in the current top
eight. Furthermore, Stan Passarell,

last year's number 4 player, is the
only player who didn't return
from last year's squad.
Stanford is favored to dump
UCLA, the NCAA champion for
the last two years. A Stanford
victory over UCLA will be the
first in the past 30 seasons.
According to "Tennis West"
magazine Stanford is ranked third
in the nation behind USC and
Trinity University.
In recruiting, Stanford has hurt
USC and UCLA. "We recruited
three of the top four U.S. citizen
tennis players. Southern Cal
acquired Mexican Davis Cupper
Raul Ramirez," said Gould.
"We get better every year, and
we'll be better next year," added
the coach. Certainly, because of
Stanford's depth and efficient
recruiting, a national
championship is definitely within
reach.
