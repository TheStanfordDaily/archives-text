Eire Parliament Adjourns
BELFAST — A half century of
Protestant home rule in Northern
Ireland ended yesterday when the
provincial Parliament bowed to British
pressure and voted to adjourn for at
least a year.
An angry crowd of 100,000 Pro
testants massed outside Stormont
Castle, the seat of Parliament, and
assailed the British measures as a
sellout to the terrorist campaign waged
by the outlawed Irish Republican
Army.
Terrorists killed two more persons
with a bomb near Londonderry, and
there was another scattered violence.
A Protestant general strike crippled
the province for a second straight day.
Fears mounted that the imminent
British takeover of the provincial
government could touch off new
violence between the Protestant major
ity and Roman Catholic minority.
In London the British Parliament
rushed through legislation to enable
senior Cabinet minister William White
law to assume all government powers
in Northern Ireland by tonight.
The British acted in hopes that
direct rule from London would defuse
the long history of sectarian clashes
that have taken 290 lives in the
province during the past 32 months.
McCloskey Back Lindsay?
MILWAUKEE, Wis. - The New York
Post reported yesterday that Rep. Paul
N. McCloskey, the California Republi
can who dropped his challenge of
Nixon, would endorse New York
Mayor John Lindsay's Democratic
Presidential bid in Milwaukee tomor
row.
In Washington, McCloskey denied
the report. Noting his name still is on
the Wisconsin ballot, he said he had
several appearances scheduled in the
state today. He said Lindsay would be
on the same platform at one of the
stops, but he had no plans to endorse
the mayor.
Berrigan Trial To Close
HARRISBURG, Pa. - The defense
concludes its summation today in the
conspiracy trial of seven anti-war
activists including the Rev. Philip
Berrigan. The case will probably reach
the jury tomorrow.
Yesterday, the prosecution con
cluded its closing argument and the
defense began its answer.
Berrigan was depicted by the

government as a self-styled "priest of
peace" who betrayed the cause of
nonviolent antiwar protest with a
conspiracy to kidnap presidential ad
viser Henry A. Kissinger.
"There is no such thing as a
nonviolent kidnaping," said William
Connelly, assistant prosecutor. "It's a
contradiction in terms."
In beginning its response before the
trial was adjourned for the day, the
defense said of the purported kidnap
plot: "An exchange of letters was
where it was born and there it died.
There is not a single scintilla of
evidence that it ever was promoted
further. It fell of its own weight."
The seven defendants are accused
by the government, besides the plot to
kidnap Kissinger, of conspiring to
blow up heating tunnels in Washing
ton, D.C., and vandalize draft boards
in at least nine Eastern states.
ITT President To Testify
WASHINGTON - ITT president
Harold Geneen is to testify again
today as the Senate Judiciary
Committee resumes its hearings into
the nomination of Richard G.
Kleindienst to be attorney general.
Geneen told the committee
previously there was no connection
between an antitrust settlement last
summer and a commitment by
International Telephone & Telegraph

Corp. to underwrite part of the 1972
Republican convention.
Committee chairman James O.
Eastland, D-Miss., said Tuesday the
hearings have "got way away" from
Kleindienst's qualifications to be
attorney general.
He said he thinks there will be only
a few more witnesses in the hearings
which were requested by Kleindienst
after columnist Jack Anderson first
published his allegations about the ITT
case on Feb. 29.
33 Arrested At Boston U
BOSTON — Riot-equipped policemen,
swinging nightsticks in confrontation
with students, arrested 33 persons
Monday on the Boston University
campus after they were asked to break
up a demonstration protesting the
presence of military recruiters.
President John Silber said he called
the 50 policemen on campus after he
could not convince the students to
remove a blockade from a school
building. He said he acted "to protect
the freedom, the free atmosphere on
this campus."
