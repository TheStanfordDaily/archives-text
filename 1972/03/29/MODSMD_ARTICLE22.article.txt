# SRM Plans Demands
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
The Stanford Rehabilitation Move
ment will present the Academic
Council with a list of four demands
when the Council meets on Friday.
About 45 members of the SRM met
in Branner Lounge last night and
decided to go to the Council meeting
and ask:
—for a repeal of the suspensions of
students Paul Loeb, Pete Knutson,
Steve Downey and Don Lee for the
fall disruptions of the Placement
Center;
—for a moratorium on further
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) hearings
until the student body has a chance to
vote on a newly proposed judicial
body;
—to drop the burglary charges
against black militant Chris Laury for
theft of silverware from the Faculty
Club during the February eat-in there;
—for a stiff resolution from the
Council opposing strings tied to

Department of Defense grants to the
University.
The group also decided to search for
candidates to put on a slate for the
upcoming ASSU presidential elections.
The meeting, originally scheduled to
discuss the three-quarter suspensions
of Loeb, Knutson, Lee and Downey,
ended up considering everything from
next week's Palo Alto visit of Vice
President Spiro Agnew to the air war
in Southeast Asia.
The first hour featured an argument
among various group members about
whether the SRM should devote itself
primarily to demonstrations against
Agnew and the war, or campus judicial
hearings.
The group finally struck a com
promise, scheduling a meeting Thurs
day night to plan a demonstration for
the Agnew visit as well as preparing
the demands for the Academic Coun
cil.
