# Burglary Charged
## Karen Franklin Takes Cake? 
### 
Santa Clara County Sheriff's depu
ties have accused Karen Franklin,
15-year-old daughter of fired English
professor H. Bruce Franklin, and black
militant Christopher Laury of burglary
for alleged thefts during a January 24
Faculty Club mill-in.
Sophomore Kwonping Ho, a mem
ber of the Third World Liberation
Front, goes before the Campus Judi
cial Panel Tuesday night, April 4, for
his actions during the mill-in.
According to Sheriff's Office re
ports, about $1103 worth of silver

ware, plates, lamps, and the like were
stolen when 200 people briefly occu
pied the Faculty Club to protest
Franklin's firing.
The Franklin family first learned of
the burglary charges three weeks ago,
when they received a mailed burglary'
citation from the Sheriff's Office.
According to Bruce Franklin, the case
against his daughter was apparently
closed a week ago after meetings with
a San Mateo County juvenile proba
tion officer, who decided she had not
stolen anything from the Faculty
Club.

Under California law, entering a
building for the purpose of com
mitting a felony constitutes burglary—
thus the charge against Franklin and
Laury.
Franklin commented that "I guess
they're trying their usual number . . .
trying to get us. I think the
viciousness of trying to get anything is
pretty despicable."
He denied that his daughter took
anything. According to Sheriff's Office
reports, kitchen workers identified her
from photographs taken earlier in the
year at the Placement Center as the
person who stole a cheesecake, valued
at $3, from a kitchen refrigerator.
Laury was arrested by gun-wielding
San Mateo County Sheriff's deputies
in Redwood City on Thursday, March
23, charged with burglary, and re
leased on $1100 bail. Stanford politi
cal science professor Charles Drek
meier co-signed for Laury's bail.
Laury, who was acquitted earlier
this year along with former Black
Students Union president Leo Bazile,
of charges of assault on a Stanford
hospital worker, maintains that he
took nothing.
