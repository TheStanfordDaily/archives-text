# Faculty Discipline Plan Revealed
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
A Faculty Senate committee has
proposed seven categories of miscon
duct for which the University may
punish a professor and has also
recommended the use of outside
hearing officers in faculty discipline
cases.
The categories of misconduct in
clude: engaging in or inciting obstruc
tion of University activities; violation
of University regulations which have
been passed by the Faculty Senate,
President, and Board of Trustees; and
engaging in, inciting, or threatening
acts of physical harm or property
damage within the University.
The proposed areas of misconduct
are among several recommendations
which the six-man Floor Management
Committee released Monday in a
"Report on Faculty Self-Discipline."
The report also recommended that

any decision by the Advisory Board be
"final and binding." The Advisory
Board handles all matters of appoint
ment and tenure and hence discipline
cases.
In the past, as in the Franklin case,
the Advisory Board's findings were
merely recommendations to the Presi
dent and Board of Trustees and could
be overruled. But now the Advisory
Board's decision is final, except in
cases of recommended dismissal. In
this instance the Board of Trustees
would have to concur.
Ticklish Issue
Committee Chairman Gordon Craig
claims this may be the "most ticklish
part" of the report since it strips the
President and Board of their authority.
But Craig said yesterday, "If the
faculty is going to take the responsi
bility for self-discipline, it should take
the power."

The committee report comes up for
discussion in the Faculty Senate on
Thursday. The recommendations must
be passed by the Senate and Board of
Trustees before they become effective.
The committee said that the cate
gories of misconduct were an attempt
at "clarifying" the current statement
which defines professorial misconduct
as "substantial and manifest neglect of
duty, or personal conduct substantial
ly impairing the individual's per
formance of his appropriate functions
within the University" (Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure).
The committee added that a pro
fessor could only be sanctioned for
conduct which fell within these seven
categories.
The report also proposed that an
outside hearing officer determine the
"historical facts" of any case of
misconduct. Currently, as in the
Franklin case, the Faculty Advisory
Board is responsible for findings of
fact, as well as deciding on guilt and
penalty.
The report said the hearing officer
mechanism would make it unnecessary
for the entire Board to be present for
"lengthy hearings on issues of fact."
And secondly, the outside hearing
officer "insulates the board from the
inevitable charge that its members, as
active participants in the academic
community, bring so many precon
ceptions to the hearing that they
cannot impartially decide factual dis
putes solely on the basis of evidence
introduced at the hearing," the report
states.
Selection Method Open
The method of selecting a hearing
officer is left open. However, the
committee recommends that the Ad
visory Board "be required and author
ized to formulate standing rules of
procedures" which would presumably
include hearing officer selection.
The report also provides sanctions
for uncooperative defendants and

witnesses in judicial proceedings, but it
provides protection from self-incrimi
nation or divulging "confidential com
munication from a student or col
league made with the understanding it
would be kept confidential."
The report also recommends that if
the Advisory Board finds charges
brought against a faculty member to
be "frivolous or without substantial
merit," it can recommend that the
University reimburse the defendant for
part or all of his defense expenses.
The report was begun in late 1970
as a response to an American Assocu
tion of University Professors (AAUP,
statement on "Freedom and
Responsibility." This states in part:
"faculty should take the initiative,
working with the administration and
other components of the institution,
to develop and maintain an atmos
phere of freedom, commitment to
academic inquiry, and respect for the
academic rights of others."
AAUP Report
The executive committee of the
Stanford Chapter of AAUP then
established a nine-member commission
headed by Law Professor Herbert
Packer which drafted a report on
faculty self-discipline. This was pub
lished in January of 1971.
Craig's Floor Management Commit
tee then received the report and after
further discussion and suggestions
drafted their own report.
This was given to the Faculty
Senate Steering Committee in the
spring of 1971, but the committee
held the report until resolution of the
Franklin case.
Craig said yesterday that the Frank
lin case certainly had an impact on the
report but not as large as one might
think.
Craig said one way the Franklin case
directly affected the report was in the
hearing officer mechanism.
