# Town Support Sought For Land Tax Plan
## 
### BOB BACON 
Stanford is seeking the support of
surrounding communities for a change
in state law which would make
preservation of open space in the
foothills more financially attractive to
the University.
The University has asked the state
legislature to amend the California
Land Conservation Act, or "William
son Act," under which property tax
assessments are reduced in exchange
for a promise by the owner to keep
the land open.
The difficulty with the Act as
presently framed is that it obligates
the landowner to keep the land open
for ten years. Land can be developed
earlier only with the approval of the
County Board of Supervisors and the
payment of a heavy cancellation fee.
Loath to commit lands to open
space for ten years when they might
be needed for academic use sooner,
Stanford has placed no land under the
Act.
The current proposal would allow
educational institutions to withdraw
land from the Act for academic
purposes, without penalty and without
Supervisor approval.
Portola Valley Endorses
The Portola Valley Town Council
has endorsed the measure. The Menlo
Park City Council will consider Stan
ford's request for an endorsement on
April 4.
Also asked to endorse the measure
are the Palo Alto City Council, the

Ladera Community Association, and
the Committee for Green Foothills.
If the amendment is adopted, the
Webb Ranch south of SLAC would
probably be the first parcel of
Stanford land placed under the Wil
liamson Act.
An identical bill was introduced in
last year's legislature, but was not
acted upon. University officials feel
that support from surrounding com
munities might improve the chances of
this year's measure.
Principal arguments in favor of the
measure are that:
Stanford cannot plan its land needs
ten years in advance, and must be
flexible with regard to its undeveloped
lands.
It is unfair to impose stiff tax
penalties on an institution seeking to
use land for tax-exempt purposes.
The University Founding Grant
requires that the lands be used "in
furtherance of educational purposes,"
hence locking lands into non-educa
tional uses might not be permissible.
Passage of the amendment would
make it easier to maintain Stanford
lands in open space without financial
hardship on the University.
Opposing Arguments
Opponents claim that:
The amendment would weaken the
Williamson Act by creating a loophole
for educational institutions that is not
available to other landowners;
Ten years is not an overly-lengthy
period to plan institutional land needs;
Local government agencies need the
full tax revenue from the lands.
Stanford is not asking exemption
from cancellation fees should it wish
to remove land from the Williamson
Act for commercial development.
The bill has been referred to
the Assembly Committee on Planning
and Land Use. A public hearing date
has not yet been set.
The measure, Assembly Bill 658, is
being sponsored in the Legislature by
Republican Assemblyman Dixon Ar
nett of Redwood City. Amett is a
former Associate Director of Univer
sity Relations at Stanford. His San
Mateo County district includes most
of the foothill land in question.
