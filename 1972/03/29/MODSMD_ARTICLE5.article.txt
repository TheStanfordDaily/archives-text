# One Prisoner Killed In Jail Escape Try
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Sheriff's deputies shot and killed a
prisoner at the Santa Clara County Jail
in San Jose yesterday, ending an
escape attempt by three prisoners who
were holding knives at the throats of
two hostages.
Yesterday's session of the Angela
Davis trial was cancelled after the
two-hour escape attempt erupted in
the jail, located only several hundred
feet from the Davis trial courtroom.
Two prisoners were arrested and the
hostages were released unharmed after
Sheriff's deputies shot a prisoner they
identified as Jacob Zitzer, alias Chuck
Williamson. According to officials,
Zitzer escaped from San Quentin
prison last December while serving a
sentence for murder and armed rob
bery.
Zitzer was arrested again this month
for the robbery of the Cabana Hyatt
House on El Camino Real in Palo Alto.
The other two prisoners were identi
fied as Ted Guerrero and Norman
Lucas.
According to Undersheriff Tom

Rosa, the prisoners were in the jail's
dispensary at 8:50 a.m. when they
pulled three 12 inch knives, apparently
homemade. They seized a medical
secretary, Sue Kawamoto, and a public
defender, Alexander Safonoff.
They threatened to kill the hostages
unless they were provided with a
getaway car and allowed to escape,
Rosa said.
A getaway car was parked in front
of the jail, but Rosa said that police
sharpshooters were stationed outside
to hit the escapees.
"We had no intention of letting
them go with the hostages," Rosa said
later. As police held back onlookers
across the street from the jail, one
official warned, "There is going to be
lead flying through here any minute."
But the single shot fired came
before the prisoners left the jail. Rosa
said that Zitzer "upped the demand"
as he neared the jail exit and
demanded that Captain Wesley John
son give the convicts his weapon and
become a third hostage.
When Johnson refused, Rosa said,
Zitzer threatened to kill the hostages
immediately, and he was then shot by
police.
Before the shooting, police nego
tiated with the inmates for more than
90 minutes. Rosa, the only public
source for events in the jail, said that
at one point Zitzer, "to show he was
not kidding, plunged the knife six
inches into his own leg."
The incident began just as those
involved were arriving for the Angela
Davis trial. The defense had been
scheduled to present its opening
arguments, which have been post
poned until today.
While police surrounded the jail and

nearby buildings, reporters who had
entered the enclosure surrounding the
trial site were held captive in that area
for most of an hour.
Davis and her attorneys were turned
away by deputies when they arrived
for the court session. Until they were
told to leave for the day, jurors for her
trial stood outside and watched police
armed with high-powered rifles move
into position.
Defense lawyers said they did not
think the jurors would be prejudiced
in Davis' case by their glimpse of
yesterday's attempted jailbreak, which
in some ways resembled the Marin
Courthouse shootout in August, 1970.
Davis is on trial for allegedly
providing weapons used in that escape
attempt, which ended in four deaths.

escape attempt by three prisoners who
were holding knives at the throats of
two hostages.
Yesterday's session of the Angela
Davis trial was cancelled after the
two-hour escape attempt erupted in
the jail, located only several hundred
feet from the Davis trial courtroom.
Two prisoners were arrested and the
hostages were released unharmed after
Sheriff's deputies shot a prisoner they
identified as Jacob Zitzer, alias Chuck
Williamson. According to officials,
Zitzer escaped from San Quentin
prison last December while serving a
sentence for murder and armed rob
bery.
Zitzer was arrested again this month
for the robbery of the Cabana Hyatt
House on El Camino Real in Palo Alto.
The other two prisoners were identi
fied as Ted Guerrero and Norman
Lucas.
According to Undersheriff Tom

Rosa, the prisoners were in the jail's
dispensary at 8:50 a.m. when they
pulled three 12 inch knives, apparently
homemade. They seized a medical
secretary, Sue Kawamoto, and a public
defender, Alexander Safonoff.
They threatened to kill the hostages
unless they were provided with a
getaway car and allowed to escape,
Rosa said.
A getaway car was parked in front
of the jail, but Rosa said that police
sharpshooters were stationed outside
to hit the escapees.
"We had no intention of letting
them go with the hostages," Rosa said
later. As police held back onlookers
across the street from the jail, one
official warned, "There is going to be
lead flying through here any minute."
But the single shot fired came
before the prisoners left the jail. Rosa
said that Zitzer "upped the demand"
as he neared the jail exit and
demanded that Captain Wesley John
son give the convicts his weapon and
become a third hostage.
When Johnson refused, Rosa said,
Zitzer threatened to kill the hostages
immediately, and he was then shot by
police.
Before the shooting, police nego
tiated with the inmates for more than
90 minutes. Rosa, the only public
source for events in the jail, said that
at one point Zitzer, "to show he was
not kidding, plunged the knife six
inches into his own leg."
The incident began just as those
involved were arriving for the Angela
Davis trial. The defense had been
scheduled to present its opening
arguments, which have been post
poned until today.
While police surrounded the jail and

nearby buildings, reporters who had
entered the enclosure surrounding the
trial site were held captive in that area
for most of an hour.
Davis and her attorneys were turned
away by deputies when they arrived
for the court session. Until they were
told to leave for the day, jurors for her
trial stood outside and watched police
armed with high-powered rifles move
into position.
Defense lawyers said they did not
think the jurors would be prejudiced
in Davis' case by their glimpse of
yesterday's attempted jailbreak, which
in some ways resembled the Marin
Courthouse shootout in August, 1970.
Davis is on trial for allegedly
providing weapons used in that escape
attempt, which ended in four deaths.
