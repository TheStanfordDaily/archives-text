Stanford University must make
a decision about recruiting at the
Placement Service that is sharp
and definite, and then be prepared
to stand by it. I fear that the
present policy of indecision in
action, or of inconsistency be
tween action and policy, can only
be ultimately destructive for the
university.
There are three kinds of clear
choices that can be made:
1. Certain kinds of recruiting
can be allowed on campus, and

other kinds can be forbidden. This
is the. position advanced by the
demonstrators. Since it involves a
choice of criteria for or against
kinds of recruiting, it seems
inherently unstable and unsup
portable. It is essentially impossi
ble of implementation, and is
therefore, I believe, an unwise
choice.
2. All recruiting can be banned
from campus on the grounds that
recruiting of any kind is an
activity more properly conducted
off campus than on. This is a hard
choice to make, since it would
consistently eliminate much

worthwhile recruiting, as for the
Peace Corps, VISTA etc. Never
theless it is a position for which
definite rationale can be estab
lished. It is one viable choice.
3. All recruiting can be guar
anteed on campus. In this case the
university must take a strong
stand, inform demonstrators that
arguments against taking certain
occupational positions can be
freely made and distributed out
side the Placement Center, but
that the university uncondition
ally guarantees the right of every
recruiter and every student—by
the use of whatever force is

necessary—to meet on campus. It
is a second viable choice.
All too often the university
appears to be like the permissive
parent who says, "No, no," and
then stands helplessly by while
the child continues to do exactly
what he wants without challenge.
The wise parent learns to say,
"Yes, yes," on any issue not of
ultimate value, and to say, "No,
no," and to mean "No, no" with
whatever resources are needed, on
issues of ultimate significance. It
is never an easy choice.
