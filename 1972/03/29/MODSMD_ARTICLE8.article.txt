# ignores chinese reality
## Open Your Eyes, Comrade Barker

Bob Barker's ranting about
Taiwan in the Daily recently
deserves refutation on many
grounds. His facts must be called
into question. He includes all of
us in his own tiny clique of
"friends of the Republic of
China", and he completely ignores
the reality of Taiwan and the
People's Republic of China behind
a smokescreen of economic data
out of Chiang Kai-shek's almanac.
Either Barker has never been to
Taiwan, or he went there with his
eyes, ears, and mind totally
blocked by KMT propaganda. As
American students who have lived
in Taiwan, we wish to refute
Barker's statements about Taiwan
itself, leaving the rest of his
fabrications to others.
The economic progress in
Taiwan flouted by Barker as
evidence of "the merits of western
democracy and free enterprise" is
progress of the wealthy class only,
unmatched by an improvement in
the distance between rich and
poor. Such progress has been
made possible only by massive
doses of capital from abroad, first
in the form of aid and, since
1960, in the form of massive
investment by American and
Japanese corporations. Why do
investors choose Taiwan? Because
in Taiwan, the government
controlled wage-scale is so low
that it is less expensive to make
parts abroad, ship them to Tai

wan, assemble them there, and
ship the completed items back
than it is to assemble them at
their place of origin.
The average factory worker's
salary in the Kaohsiung industrial
complex (almost entirely owned
and operated by foreigners) is US
$17.50 per month, plus room, a
barely-subsistence wage. Compare
this wage with the earnings of
Chiang's corrupt bureaucrats or
industrialists, some of whom earn
over US $100,000 per year. These
men live like feudal princes,
ignoring Chiang's ever-so-moral
"social legislation" and "New Life
Movement" to enjoy their con
cubines, whoring, and the Finer
Things of Life, marked Made In
U.S.A. A taxi driver in Taipei,
whose name must be withheld for
his own safety, told us that he
must pay one-third to one-half of
his monthly wages (total earnings
of about US $50.00) in bribes to
various officials in order to keep
his hack license. Taiwan's export
trade has increased, using foreign
capital, but to whose advantage?
To the advantage of foreign
businessmen, Chiang Kai-shek, the
KMT, and its corrupt local and
natural-level bureaucrats.
On the social front, Chiang has
attempted to maintain "tradi
tional Chinese values" (e.g., politi
cal apathy, respect for authority,
subservience to parents, etc.)

when they suit his purposes, while
adding a veneer of Western "civili
zation". He has created a small,
privileged elite of semi-
Westernized suburbanites, a low
grade bourgeoisie placed over a
vast stratum of farmers, workers,
and migrants who live at subsis
tence.
This new class fawns on im
ported American values and goods
(the latter generally bought from
the American occupation forces
PX at a good profit for all
concerned, considering the black
market mark-up of 2.5:1). But
they know nothing of China, their
own country, for the government
controlled press tells them only
lies about the People's Republic.
The disparity between the high
and the low, the rich and the
poor, the mainland exiles and the
Taiwanese, the KMT-member and
the non-KMT-member has been
clear all along. The "traditional
Chinese values system", one of
exploitation of the poor and rural
by the rich and urban, has been
preserved.
It is in the political sphere that
Chiang's failure is most obvious.
Even his supposed "ideology", the
anachronistic "Three Principles of
the People" of Sun Yat-sen, has
been left by the wayside in his
scramble to maintain his own
warlord status over the people of
Taiwan. There are no elections,

the vast majority of the people
(the 80% of the population who
were there before Chiang and his
thugs were chased off the main
land) have no representation to
speak of in Chiang's phony
"People's Representative Con
gress," a group of octogenarians
"elected" in a rigged poll of
China's upper class after the
Second World War. The political
thought control police, the
dreaded Garrison Command, are
under the personal control of
Chiang's universally-detested son,
Chiang Ching-kuo, and are respon
sible to no one else. The cases of
Ts'ai Mao-t'ang, Li Ao, and other
intellectuals who conveniently
"disappeared" on Taiwan are
well-known in the U.S.
And to speak of "Chinese
subversion" in the U.S.? In 1968,
a Taiwanese student named Ch'en
Yu-hsi was tried and convicted of
subversion, having been spotted
reading the works of Mao Tse
tung in the library of the Uni
versity of Hawaii. KMT spies keep
a close watch on every Chinese
student in America (particularly
those with family still in Taiwan),
making sure that they toe the line.
J. Edgar Hoover is not, I am sure,
unaware of this.

Bob Barker's ranting about
Taiwan in the Daily recently
deserves refutation on many
grounds. His facts must be called
into question. He includes all of
us in his own tiny clique of
"friends of the Republic of
China", and he completely ignores
the reality of Taiwan and the
People's Republic of China behind
a smokescreen of economic data
out of Chiang Kai-shek's almanac.
Either Barker has never been to
Taiwan, or he went there with his
eyes, ears, and mind totally
blocked by KMT propaganda. As
American students who have lived
in Taiwan, we wish to refute
Barker's statements about Taiwan
itself, leaving the rest of his
fabrications to others.
The economic progress in
Taiwan flouted by Barker as
evidence of "the merits of western
democracy and free enterprise" is
progress of the wealthy class only,
unmatched by an improvement in
the distance between rich and
poor. Such progress has been
made possible only by massive
doses of capital from abroad, first
in the form of aid and, since
1960, in the form of massive
investment by American and
Japanese corporations. Why do
investors choose Taiwan? Because
in Taiwan, the government
controlled wage-scale is so low
that it is less expensive to make
parts abroad, ship them to Tai

wan, assemble them there, and
ship the completed items back
than it is to assemble them at
their place of origin.
The average factory worker's
salary in the Kaohsiung industrial
complex (almost entirely owned
and operated by foreigners) is US
$17.50 per month, plus room, a
barely-subsistence wage. Compare
this wage with the earnings of
Chiang's corrupt bureaucrats or
industrialists, some of whom earn
over US $100,000 per year. These
men live like feudal princes,
ignoring Chiang's ever-so-moral
"social legislation" and "New Life
Movement" to enjoy their con
cubines, whoring, and the Finer
Things of Life, marked Made In
U.S.A. A taxi driver in Taipei,
whose name must be withheld for
his own safety, told us that he
must pay one-third to one-half of
his monthly wages (total earnings
of about US $50.00) in bribes to
various officials in order to keep
his hack license. Taiwan's export
trade has increased, using foreign
capital, but to whose advantage?
To the advantage of foreign
businessmen, Chiang Kai-shek, the
KMT, and its corrupt local and
natural-level bureaucrats.
On the social front, Chiang has
attempted to maintain "tradi
tional Chinese values" (e.g., politi
cal apathy, respect for authority,
subservience to parents, etc.)

when they suit his purposes, while
adding a veneer of Western "civili
zation". He has created a small,
privileged elite of semi-
Westernized suburbanites, a low
grade bourgeoisie placed over a
vast stratum of farmers, workers,
and migrants who live at subsis
tence.
This new class fawns on im
ported American values and goods
(the latter generally bought from
the American occupation forces
PX at a good profit for all
concerned, considering the black
market mark-up of 2.5:1). But
they know nothing of China, their
own country, for the government
controlled press tells them only
lies about the People's Republic.
The disparity between the high
and the low, the rich and the
poor, the mainland exiles and the
Taiwanese, the KMT-member and
the non-KMT-member has been
clear all along. The "traditional
Chinese values system", one of
exploitation of the poor and rural
by the rich and urban, has been
preserved.
It is in the political sphere that
Chiang's failure is most obvious.
Even his supposed "ideology", the
anachronistic "Three Principles of
the People" of Sun Yat-sen, has
been left by the wayside in his
scramble to maintain his own
warlord status over the people of
Taiwan. There are no elections,

the vast majority of the people

Westernized suburbanites, a low

PX at a good profit for all

lies about the People's Republic.
The disparity between the high
and the low, the rich and the
poor, the mainland exiles and the
Taiwanese, the KMT-member and
the non-KMT-member has been

preserved.
It is in the political sphere that
Chiang's failure is most obvious.
Even his supposed "ideology", the
anachronistic "Three Principles of

been left by the wayside in his

warlord status over the people of
Taiwan. There are no elections,

the vast majority of the people
(the 80% of the population who
were there before Chiang and his
thugs were chased off the main
land) have no representation to
speak of in Chiang's phony
"People's Representative Con
gress," a group of octogenarians
"elected" in a rigged poll of
China's upper class after the
Second World War. The political
thought control police, the
dreaded Garrison Command, are
under the personal control of
Chiang's universally-detested son,
Chiang Ching-kuo, and are respon
sible to no one else. The cases of
Ts'ai Mao-t'ang, Li Ao, and other
intellectuals who conveniently
"disappeared" on Taiwan are
well-known in the U.S.
And to speak of "Chinese
subversion" in the U.S.? In 1968,
a Taiwanese student named Ch'en
Yu-hsi was tried and convicted of
subversion, having been spotted
reading the works of Mao Tse
tung in the library of the Uni
versity of Hawaii. KMT spies keep
a close watch on every Chinese
student in America (particularly
those with family still in Taiwan),
making sure that they toe the line.
J. Edgar Hoover is not, I am sure,
unaware of this.

Bob Barker's ranting about
Taiwan in the Daily recently
deserves refutation on many
grounds. His facts must be called
into question. He includes all of
us in his own tiny clique of
"friends of the Republic of
China", and he completely ignores
the reality of Taiwan and the
People's Republic of China behind
a smokescreen of economic data
out of Chiang Kai-shek's almanac.
Either Barker has never been to
Taiwan, or he went there with his
eyes, ears, and mind totally
blocked by KMT propaganda. As
American students who have lived
in Taiwan, we wish to refute
Barker's statements about Taiwan
itself, leaving the rest of his
fabrications to others.
The economic progress in
Taiwan flouted by Barker as
evidence of "the merits of western
democracy and free enterprise" is
progress of the wealthy class only,
unmatched by an improvement in
the distance between rich and
poor. Such progress has been
made possible only by massive
doses of capital from abroad, first
in the form of aid and, since
1960, in the form of massive
investment by American and
Japanese corporations. Why do
investors choose Taiwan? Because
in Taiwan, the government
controlled wage-scale is so low
that it is less expensive to make
parts abroad, ship them to Tai

wan, assemble them there, and
ship the completed items back
than it is to assemble them at
their place of origin.
The average factory worker's
salary in the Kaohsiung industrial
complex (almost entirely owned
and operated by foreigners) is US
$17.50 per month, plus room, a
barely-subsistence wage. Compare
this wage with the earnings of
Chiang's corrupt bureaucrats or
industrialists, some of whom earn
over US $100,000 per year. These
men live like feudal princes,
ignoring Chiang's ever-so-moral
"social legislation" and "New Life
Movement" to enjoy their con
cubines, whoring, and the Finer
Things of Life, marked Made In
U.S.A. A taxi driver in Taipei,
whose name must be withheld for
his own safety, told us that he
must pay one-third to one-half of
his monthly wages (total earnings
of about US $50.00) in bribes to
various officials in order to keep
his hack license. Taiwan's export
trade has increased, using foreign
capital, but to whose advantage?
To the advantage of foreign
businessmen, Chiang Kai-shek, the
KMT, and its corrupt local and
natural-level bureaucrats.
On the social front, Chiang has
attempted to maintain "tradi
tional Chinese values" (e.g., politi
cal apathy, respect for authority,
subservience to parents, etc.)

when they suit his purposes, while
adding a veneer of Western "civili
zation". He has created a small,
privileged elite of semi-
Westernized suburbanites, a low
grade bourgeoisie placed over a
vast stratum of farmers, workers,
and migrants who live at subsis
tence.

ported American values and goods
