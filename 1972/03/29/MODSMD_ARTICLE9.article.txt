## A 						Socializing Process 
### 
Michael wallerstein

I have been a student here for
nearly three years now during
which time I have found it harder
and harder to put up with all the
shit that makes up the life of a
student. Yet, now as I am finally
dropping out of this place, I want
to leave something behind.
What occurs here is not educa
tion but socialization. Education
is training to do something, to
create, to be a leader of oneself.
Socialization is training for a
passive acceptance of one's
socially determined role, to be a
follower of others. The crucial
difference is whether one is being
trained to have power, and stu
dents are both one of the most
powerless groups and one of the
most thoroughly socialized groups
in our society.
The basic structure of the
university today has its beginnings
around the turn of the century
when the university was trans
formed from an isolated enclave
of classical learning to an institu
tion dedicated to making good
bureaucrats, the capitalist new
man.
Bureau
In fact, a class meets the three
requirements of a bureau:
1. There is a common purpose
uniting all the activities of the
members. 2. There is vertical
control of resources. 3. There is
vertical control of rewards, wages
and advancement. The professor
determines a box of knowledge,

with specific boundaries, to work
in. He controls the resources,
deciding what books and tests to
use as well as obviously control
ling the rewards with his evalua
tions. The structure functions to
keep all exchange and communi
cation going up or down and
reducing any horizontal flow as
much as possible.
The essential characteristic of
the socialization process is train
ing to live in an authoritarian
hierarchy. We are taught to accept
as legitimate the power of the
professors who are made into
omniscient gods, controlling our
future with their arbitrary evalua
tions of us. We are atomized. We
are taught to work selfishly, in
isolation and in competition with
our fellow students. We even
swear by the Honor Code not to
help anyone else. As we are
constantly being rated we are
being taught that stratification is
natural, that we deserve what we
get and some people get more
than others.
We are taught to mystify
expertise. We are taught that the
only people qualified to teach or
make our decisions are those who
have been certified by the authori
ties. We are taught that process
always produces content, that one
can judge what one has learned
from how long one has been in
school or actually that what one
has learned does not matter, it is
only the process that counts. We
are taught to accept him rather
than considering any underlying
rationality. We are taught to
accept the status quo.
We are reduced to passive
consumers of the product of this
educational factory, knowledge.
Knowledge becomes a com
modity, separated into exact
boxes, each unrelated to anything
else, each quantifiable and certi
fiable. We are offered a variety of
boxes, from among which we can
consume if we pay tuition and do
what the professor demands. The

box of knowledge is like any
consumer item, it is standardized
and made marketable to the mass
of students. The complement is
that student's needs are reduced
to standardized items that can be
met by more consumer items.
Happiness and success are defined
by another car or another degree,
depending on which social class
you are a member of.
What is the result of this
institution which provides a justi
fication of stratification, a mysti
fication of expertise, and a re
duction of learning to commodity
consumption? I did a lot of talking
in the dorms this past quarter and
I have never seen a group of
people so obedient, so submissive,
who so identified with their
bosses for we are being proletari
anized. We are being taught the
values necessary to fulfill our role
as workers who will fill the higher
levels of the bureaucracies of
society, the government, the cor
porations, the universities, etc.
We are being objectified. We are
being reduced to simply producers
and consumers, to a commodity
with a price tag on our heads. We
are treated as children and trained
to always accept being treated as
children. We are being developed
into, on the one hand, disem
bodied intellects, pure minds,
superior to those below us on the
pyramid who have to work with
their bodies. On the other hand,
we are developed into pure body,
given no power to control our
own lives, subservient to those
above us on the pyramid.
As the basic condition of our
lives is powerlessness and pas
sivity, the most positive act is to
rebel, to refuse to accept one's
bureaucratic role, to refuse to
submit to authority, for in such
an act, one is creating his
freedom, taking the power neces
sary to act creatively and demo
cratically.

help anyone else. As we are
constantly being rated we are
being taught that stratification is
natural, that we deserve what we
get and some people get more
than others.
We are taught to mystify
expertise. We are taught that the
only people qualified to teach or
make our decisions are those who
have been certified by the authori
ties. We are taught that process
always produces content, that one
can judge what one has learned
from how long one has been in
school or actually that what one
has learned does not matter, it is
only the process that counts. We
are taught to accept him rather
than considering any underlying
rationality. We are taught to
accept the status quo.
We are reduced to passive
consumers of the product of this
educational factory, knowledge.
Knowledge becomes a com
modity, separated into exact
boxes, each unrelated to anything
else, each quantifiable and certi
fiable. We are offered a variety of
boxes, from among which we can
consume if we pay tuition and do
what the professor demands. The

box of knowledge is like any
consumer item, it is standardized
and made marketable to the mass
of students. The complement is
that student's needs are reduced
to standardized items that can be
met by more consumer items.
Happiness and success are defined
by another car or another degree,
depending on which social class
you are a member of.
What is the result of this
institution which provides a justi
fication of stratification, a mysti
fication of expertise, and a re
duction of learning to commodity
consumption? I did a lot of talking
in the dorms this past quarter and
I have never seen a group of
people so obedient, so submissive,
who so identified with their
bosses for we are being proletari
anized. We are being taught the
values necessary to fulfill our role
as workers who will fill the higher
levels of the bureaucracies of
society, the government, the cor
porations, the universities, etc.
We are being objectified. We are
being reduced to simply producers
and consumers, to a commodity
with a price tag on our heads. We
are treated as children and trained
to always accept being treated as
children. We are being developed
into, on the one hand, disem
bodied intellects, pure minds,
superior to those below us on the
pyramid who have to work with
their bodies. On the other hand,
we are developed into pure body,
given no power to control our
own lives, subservient to those
above us on the pyramid.
As the basic condition of our
lives is powerlessness and pas
sivity, the most positive act is to
rebel, to refuse to accept one's
bureaucratic role, to refuse to
submit to authority, for in such
an act, one is creating his
freedom, taking the power neces
sary to act creatively and demo
cratically.

I have been a student here for
nearly three years now during
which time I have found it harder
and harder to put up with all the
shit that makes up the life of a
student. Yet, now as I am finally
dropping out of this place, I want
to leave something behind.
What occurs here is not educa
tion but socialization. Education
is training to do something, to
create, to be a leader of oneself.
Socialization is training for a
passive acceptance of one's
socially determined role, to be a
follower of others. The crucial
difference is whether one is being
trained to have power, and stu
dents are both one of the most
powerless groups and one of the
most thoroughly socialized groups
in our society.
The basic structure of the
university today has its beginnings
around the turn of the century
when the university was trans
formed from an isolated enclave
of classical learning to an institu
tion dedicated to making good
bureaucrats, the capitalist new
man.
Bureau
In fact, a class meets the three
requirements of a bureau:
1. There is a common purpose
uniting all the activities of the
members. 2. There is vertical
control of resources. 3. There is
vertical control of rewards, wages
and advancement. The professor
determines a box of knowledge,

with specific boundaries, to work
in. He controls the resources,
deciding what books and tests to
use as well as obviously control
ling the rewards with his evalua
tions. The structure functions to
keep all exchange and communi
cation going up or down and
reducing any horizontal flow as
much as possible.
The essential characteristic of
the socialization process is train
ing to live in an authoritarian
hierarchy. We are taught to accept
as legitimate the power of the
professors who are made into
omniscient gods, controlling our
future with their arbitrary evalua
tions of us. We are atomized. We
are taught to work selfishly, in
isolation and in competition with
our fellow students. We even
swear by the Honor Code not to
help anyone else. As we are

and consumers, to a commodity
with a price tag on our heads. We
are treated as children and trained
to always accept being treated as
children. We are being developed
into, on the one hand, disem
bodied intellects, pure minds,
superior to those below us on the
pyramid who have to work with
their bodies. On the other hand,
we are developed into pure body,
given no power to control our
own lives, subservient to those
above us on the pyramid.
As the basic condition of our
lives is powerlessness and pas
sivity, the most positive act is to
rebel, to refuse to accept one's
bureaucratic role, to refuse to
submit to authority, for in such
an act, one is creating his
freedom, taking the power neces
sary to act creatively and demo
cratically.
