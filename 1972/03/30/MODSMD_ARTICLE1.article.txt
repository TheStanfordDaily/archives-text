# Black Demands Discussed
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
Stanford officials are currently
discussing a list of demands presented
to head basketball coach Howie
Dallmar by part-time Assistant Coach
Charles Range on behalf of the black
basketball players.
At a February 23 meeting involving
some of the black players, Coach
Range, Coach Dallmar, assistant coach
Bub Bowling, and Acting Athletic
Director Robert Young, a list of 11
demands was disclosed. They were as
follows:
1. There should be an end to
differential treatment of the black
athlete.
2. The basketball program should
change to utilize talent of the players
being recruited rather than changing
ball players' style to fit a program that
has historically been a failure.
3. Issues of the practices of the
coach should be evaluated by a task
force including black and white
faculty and staff of the university (no
more than seven to be selected by
Black athletes and staff). If such
findings are supportive of the Black
athletes, coach Dallmar should be
replaced immediately.
4. There should be established
periodic reviews of issues and concerns
of all athletes after each seventh game.
5. For each scholarship offered to a
white athlete there should be one
offered to a black athlete.
6. There should be no future
stacking of athletes. This means for
example having only black substitutes
for a black player at a starting
position.
7. All publicity originating from the
athletic department or initiated by
basketball coaches should reflect a
balance of recognition of both black
and white athletes.

8. Athletes should not be involved
in rating each other to determine
whether they will play or who they
prefer to play with.
9. Games should be scheduled with
black colleges.
10. Stanford should initiate the
necessary procedure to insure the
utilization of black officials in the
Pacific-8 Conference at the varsity and
freshmen level.
11. The authority and responsibili
ty for recommendation of athletes to
be recruited, visit the campus, and
receive athletic scholarships should be
equally shared among all coaches.
Not Vindictive
Range, the spokesman for the
players stated "I'm not out to be
vindicative. I feel there needs to be a
change [in the Stanford basketball
program]. It's kind of depressing to be
involved in a program that doesn't
perpetuate winning. We are not saying
fire everyone, change the whole
coaching staff. We're just saying that if
there is some validity to our concern,
people should be made aware of it and
give some time to respond to it."
Presidential Assistant James Sim
mons, Assistant Dean of Students
Harold Boyd, and other University
officials have had several informal
discussions with those concerned.
Simmons stated that the situation
was in no way similar to the St. Mary's
incident of three weeks ago, where all
the blacks quit the basketball team in
the middle of a game to protest
administration policies. "This thing is
not a racial matter, the players are
concerned that the basketball program
has been a failure and they want
something done about it."
Dallmar Confident
Coach Dallmar in response to the
demands stated, "All of us, coaches

and players alike, are always trying to
find ways to improve the program and
I have confidence that satisfactory
solutions will be reached." He con
tinued, "The one area of difficulty for
any basketball coach is simply that
only five players can be in the game at
a given time, and any player sitting on
the bench feels he should be playing
more. A coach in any sport certainly
doesn't make decisions like this based
on racial feelings, and he trusts that his
players won't make judgements that
way either."
On Tuesday afternoon talks were
held in President Lyman's office with
the black players, the coaches, and
Assistant Dean of Students Harold
Boyd. The talks were described "as
part of the continuing discussion on
the matter and that no statement will
be made until some final decisions
have been reached."
On KZSU Tuesday night, President
Lyman said he had "no comment"
when asked about the issue.

Boyd. The talks were described "as
part of the continuing discussion on
the matter and that no statement will
be made until some final decisions
have been reached."
On KZSU Tuesday night, President
Lyman said he had "no comment"
when asked about the issue.
Stanford officials are currently
discussing a list of demands presented
to head basketball coach Howie
Dallmar by part-time Assistant Coach
Charles Range on behalf of the black
basketball players.
At a February 23 meeting involving
some of the black players, Coach
Range, Coach Dallmar, assistant coach
Bub Bowling, and Acting Athletic
Director Robert Young, a list of 11
demands was disclosed. They were as
follows:
1. There should be an end to
differential treatment of the black
athlete.
2. The basketball program should
change to utilize talent of the players
being recruited rather than changing
ball players' style to fit a program that
has historically been a failure.
3. Issues of the practices of the
coach should be evaluated by a task
force including black and white
faculty and staff of the university (no
more than seven to be selected by
Black athletes and staff). If such
findings are supportive of the Black
athletes, coach Dallmar should be
replaced immediately.
4. There should be established
periodic reviews of issues and concerns
of all athletes after each seventh game.
5. For each scholarship offered to a
white athlete there should be one
offered to a black athlete.
6. There should be no future
stacking of athletes. This means for
example having only black substitutes
for a black player at a starting
position.
7. All publicity originating from the
athletic department or initiated by
basketball coaches should reflect a
balance of recognition of both black
and white athletes.

8. Athletes should not be involved
in rating each other to determine
whether they will play or who they
prefer to play with.
9. Games should be scheduled with
black colleges.
10. Stanford should initiate the
necessary procedure to insure the
utilization of black officials in the
Pacific-8 Conference at the varsity and
freshmen level.
11. The authority and responsibili
ty for recommendation of athletes to
be recruited, visit the campus, and
receive athletic scholarships should be
equally shared among all coaches.
Not Vindictive
Range, the spokesman for the
players stated "I'm not out to be
vindicative. I feel there needs to be a
change [in the Stanford basketball
program]. It's kind of depressing to be
involved in a program that doesn't
perpetuate winning. We are not saying
fire everyone, change the whole
coaching staff. We're just saying that if
there is some validity to our concern,
people should be made aware of it and
give some time to respond to it."
Presidential Assistant James Sim
mons, Assistant Dean of Students
Harold Boyd, and other University
officials have had several informal
discussions with those concerned.
Simmons stated that the situation
was in no way similar to the St. Mary's
incident of three weeks ago, where all
the blacks quit the basketball team in
the middle of a game to protest
administration policies. "This thing is
not a racial matter, the players are
concerned that the basketball program
has been a failure and they want
something done about it."
Dallmar Confident
Coach Dallmar in response to the
demands stated, "All of us, coaches

and players alike, are always trying to
find ways to improve the program and
I have confidence that satisfactory
solutions will be reached." He con
tinued, "The one area of difficulty for
any basketball coach is simply that
only five players can be in the game at
a given time, and any player sitting on
the bench feels he should be playing
more. A coach in any sport certainly
doesn't make decisions like this based
on racial feelings, and he trusts that his
players won't make judgements that
way either."
On Tuesday afternoon talks were
held in President Lyman's office with
the black players, the coaches, and
Assistant Dean of Students Harold
Boyd. The talks were described "as
