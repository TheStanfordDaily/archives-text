## Dinner For Dinosaurs

If you had been at Rickey's for the dinner honoring David Packard
Feb. 29, you would have been amazed at the assembly of the
powerful and the very, very rich. You also would have noticed the
huge crowd of hundred of people outside protesting the war in
Indochina and Packard's role in it, and heard the anti-war outrage of a
few people who attended the dinner itself. You might think it ironic
that even the elite of the ruling class couldn't buy itself a nice, quiet
party.
Several of us, members of the community who oppose the war,
managed to purchase the $10 tickets to the "Community Dinner"
honoring Packard, recipient of the 10th Distinguished Citizen Award
of the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce. Passing through the throngs
of protesters kept at bay by squads of policemen with yard-long
truncheons and then entering the plush Palo Alto Room, we felt like
we were attending the Czar's birthday party before the Revolution.
I wandered through the packed room at cocktail time, feeling like a
visitor to the past. The room was dominated by a generation of
WASPS who had trained at Stanford during the Depression years and
had made it very big. Here were the corporation heads, the
elegantly-dressed wives, leading business men, millionaires greeting
each other, drinks in hand. ("You old son-of-a-gun!") In the middle of
the room, looking younger than most, bathed in congenial limelight
were Dr. and Mrs. Richard Lyman. Harried cocktail waitresses in shiny
dresses which barely covered their hips dodged about with little trays
of drinks and dollar bills wrapped around their fingers. Here in one
gathering were hundreds of people who had shaped the policies and
designed the implements of war and those who supported these
actions and profited from them. There was a glow of success and
confidence in the crowd. These people had fulfilled the American
Dream which had become a nightmare for the people of Indochina.
And there they were, celebrating and congratulating each other.
Power means never having to say you're sorry.
Hovering
Hovering in the corridors, ready to start serving the prime roast
beef dinner were the help: waiters, cooks and busboys, all Third
World People, with name tags like "Carlos." It gave me the strangest
feeling, being the only Asian guest as far as I could see, sitting down
t,p the plush table set with wine glasses, cigarette favors, and fine
linen, wondering what my great-grandfather who slaved on Stanford's
railroad would think of the situation.
After the main course, the Master of Ceremonies from the
Chamber of Commerce opened the formalities of the evening with,
"Welcome to Washington, D.C. West!" There were the in-group jokes:
"The Award should really go to Bill Hewlett." "Back to the two-car
garage, Dave." Amidst such good cheer and applause the electronics
magnate, home-town boy-made-good, received an award from the Palo
Alto School District and another from the Office of the Civil Defense.

Just before the main event, the Big Award, Doug Mattern stood up
to make his own presentation and two of us joined him. He declared
in a voice that could be heard throughout the room, "I'd like
everyone in this room to be aware of the fact that by participating in
this award you are endorsing the war in Indochina. . . The
confident faces became twisted with anger. There were shouts of "get
out!", "Throw them in jail!"
Magnaminous
"Let me shake that fellow's hand," said this huge man, Packard
himself, showing his magnaminity.
"No thank you," said Doug and was promptly gripped by two
plainclothesmen and taken out of the room. I then shouted, "This
award was bought with the blood of the peoples of Indochina!" which
so infuriated an old guy sitting nearby that he struck me in the chest,
something which would have constituted assault had I done similarly
to one of the two cops who hauled me out.
"I have a son in the Palo Alto School District," said Barbara
Hickenlooper to Packard, "and I don't think that your presiding over
the killing of innocent Asian women and children is an example of
good citizenship." To which Packard replied, "You're entitled to your
opinion." She was taken away by two of the professional bouncers,
unable to say to his face, "And they are entitled to their lives!"
Furious Crowd
We were glad to be outside in the cold air, feeling somehow that
the plainclothesmen had saved us from being torn apart by the furious
crowd whose party we had spoiled. Two women who were still inside
managed to go from table to table with small leaflets and one man
went around repeating his anti-war message. Cozette Dudley tried to
speak at the microphone but was forced out, still reading her
statement. On the podium she had left a folder, our non-award to
David Packard. It contained an acknowledgement of Packard's
accomplishments in his pursuit of commercial and military interests
and two pictures of war-wounded Vietnamese children. Our statement
was made,
".. .in memory of the millions of women, children, and men of
Indochina who have been killed or maimed as result of U.S.
military action there, and in memory of a generation of American
youth who died in Indochina for nothing. It is also made on behalf
of millions of Americans whose lives have been wasted by a system
which ignores their needs and crushes their aspirations."
So Packard and other masters of war, there will be people like us at
your banquets, award ceremonies and stock holder meetings no
matter how many guards you hire, to remind you of what you are and
what you have done. We won't let up until your species is extinct and
then, it's even harder for a dinasour than a camel to get through a
needle's eye.
