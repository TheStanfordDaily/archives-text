McCloskey
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Stanford community holds
the key to Pete McCloskey's
battle for the Republican
nomination for Congress in the
new 17th Congressional district. It
is crucial for large numbers of the
students, faculty, and staff who
are presently registered as
Democrats or Independents to
change to Republican registration
by April 13 if we are not be
self-muzzled in this campaign.
McCloskey is on the
Republican liquidation list for
daring to challenge the Nixon
leadership. Come and hear him for
yourselves—he will be spending all
day on the campus April 3. He
stands for ending the bombings
and the war immediately; for
ending the senility committee
system that vitiates Congressional
leadership; for integrity—not
ITTegrity in government; for
continuing efforts in conservation
legislation.
His opponent, Dr. Cole, makes

down-the-linism and McCloskey's
refusal to knucle under to party
discipline the main issue. For his
qualifications he lists his
chairmanship of the Republican
Lincoln Day dinner that had "best
ever attendance." He has served
on the Palo Alto School Board
with closed mind, as the watchdog
of the right wing. His curricular
ideas there are quaint—he even
supported hving Genesis taught as
part of a science course.
Nevertheless he is a formidable
opponent—he has the bankroll
and the blessing of the Nixon
leadership -and he comes on with
the simplistic rhetoric of a George
Wallace.
Can you live with the prospect
of national headlines June
7—"Republicans dump liberal
McCloskey for conservative
Cole?"
The McCloskey race may well
be all over by April 13—the
deadline for new and
re-registrations. A groundswell of
Republican registrations at
Stanford can provide the margin
of victory for McCloskey on June
6. Register your support today.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The majority of persons voting
for a union in the National Labor
Relations' elections voted for an
outside union because they
believed that only a strongly
organized force could win more
pay and more benefits for them.
Although workers respected
United Stanford Employees
(USE) and come to us for
solutions of their grievances,
many simply do not feel that USE
has the power to force substantial
concessions from the.
administration. Nor do they have
the confidence that USE can
protect them in their jobs. The
barrage of propaganda issued by
CSEA and the Teamsters in the
last week before elections were
both false and the promises
illusory. Had USE the financial
and other resources to counteract
this propaganda and had we had
an open forum where workers
could listen and judge, the tides
would have turned in favor of
USE.
USE, I know, will continue to
organize and mobilize all the
people in the community in
support of workers' needs.
Because of the results of the
election we are immediately faced
with the possibility of a run-off
election between the Teamsters'
Union and no union.
Two million rank and file
members of the Teamsters' Union
can attest to their economic gains
and to the legitimacy of their
Union and no derogatory
statements that it is little different

from big business will convince
them otherwise. The Teamsters'
Union does have the power to win
substantial benefits for Stanford
workers provided it can convince
the majority of workers in the
bargaining unit as well as outside
the unit to support it. Is this
possible? The great majority of
employees here are white collar
workers, most of whom are
women, who cannot identify their
working interests with those of
the Teamsters. Certainly the
technicians in the bargaining unit
have the same problem. There is a
strong anti-Teamster feeling in the
University which I doubt that the
Teamsters can easily overcome.
Antagonism and resentment will
run high if these employees are
forced to join the Teamsters and
pay $7.00 in dues each month.
The no-union vote reflected an
anti-teamster vote as much as an
anti-union vote.
Yet for myself, I must state
that given a choice between the
Teamsters Union and no union, 1
must support those workers who
want the Teamsters to bargain for
them. A vote for no union is a
vote for the administration and
will adversely affect all
employees. USE will, I am certain,
continue to mobilize support for
all workers. We will guard against
any possible attempt by the
administration to use one group
of workers against another.
Can USE, a small dedicated
group, by itself survive the
competitive struggle for power
ahead and grow into a large
organization including all
employees at Stanford? Certainly
no one can do it for us. Yet most
independent, company-wide
unions have, in the past, either
been co-opted by the employer,
died a natural death, or affiliated
with a larger labor group. I foresee
the possibility of gaining
additional stability and strength
by linking our employee
organization with similar
employee organizing groups in all
the Universities of this country.
For this we need finances and
other organizational resources,

probably available through the
AFL-CIO, in order to form one
NATIONAL UNION OF
UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES.
Shall we try?

Editor, THE DAILY:
The Stanford community holds
the key to Pete McCloskey's
battle for the Republican
nomination for Congress in the
new 17th Congressional district. It
is crucial for large numbers of the
students, faculty, and staff who
are presently registered as
Democrats or Independents to
change to Republican registration
by April 13 if we are not be
self-muzzled in this campaign.
McCloskey is on the
Republican liquidation list for
daring to challenge the Nixon
leadership. Come and hear him for
yourselves—he will be spending all
day on the campus April 3. He
stands for ending the bombings
and the war immediately; for
ending the senility committee
system that vitiates Congressional
leadership; for integrity—not
ITTegrity in government; for
continuing efforts in conservation
legislation.
His opponent, Dr. Cole, makes

down-the-linism and McCloskey's
refusal to knucle under to party
discipline the main issue. For his
qualifications he lists his
chairmanship of the Republican
Lincoln Day dinner that had "best
ever attendance." He has served
on the Palo Alto School Board
with closed mind, as the watchdog
of the right wing. His curricular
ideas there are quaint—he even
supported hving Genesis taught as
part of a science course.
Nevertheless he is a formidable
opponent—he has the bankroll
and the blessing of the Nixon
leadership -and he comes on with
the simplistic rhetoric of a George
Wallace.
Can you live with the prospect
of national headlines June
7—"Republicans dump liberal
McCloskey for conservative
Cole?"
The McCloskey race may well
be all over by April 13—the
deadline for new and
re-registrations. A groundswell of
Republican registrations at
Stanford can provide the margin
of victory for McCloskey on June
6. Register your support today.

The majority of persons voting
for a union in the National Labor
Relations' elections voted for an
outside union because they
believed that only a strongly
organized force could win more
pay and more benefits for them.
Although workers respected
United Stanford Employees
(USE) and come to us for
solutions of their grievances,
many simply do not feel that USE
has the power to force substantial
concessions from the.
administration. Nor do they have
the confidence that USE can
protect them in their jobs. The
barrage of propaganda issued by
CSEA and the Teamsters in the
last week before elections were
both false and the promises
illusory. Had USE the financial
and other resources to counteract
this propaganda and had we had
an open forum where workers
could listen and judge, the tides
would have turned in favor of
USE.
USE, I know, will continue to
organize and mobilize all the
people in the community in
support of workers' needs.
Because of the results of the
election we are immediately faced
with the possibility of a run-off
election between the Teamsters'
Union and no union.
Two million rank and file
members of the Teamsters' Union
can attest to their economic gains
and to the legitimacy of their
Union and no derogatory
statements that it is little different

from big business will convince
them otherwise. The Teamsters'
Union does have the power to win
substantial benefits for Stanford
workers provided it can convince
the majority of workers in the
bargaining unit as well as outside
the unit to support it. Is this
possible? The great majority of
employees here are white collar
workers, most of whom are
women, who cannot identify their
working interests with those of
the Teamsters. Certainly the
technicians in the bargaining unit
have the same problem. There is a
strong anti-Teamster feeling in the
University which I doubt that the
Teamsters can easily overcome.
Antagonism and resentment will
run high if these employees are
forced to join the Teamsters and
pay $7.00 in dues each month.
The no-union vote reflected an
anti-teamster vote as much as an
anti-union vote.
Yet for myself, I must state
that given a choice between the
Teamsters Union and no union, 1
must support those workers who
want the Teamsters to bargain for
them. A vote for no union is a
vote for the administration and
will adversely affect all
employees. USE will, I am certain,
continue to mobilize support for
all workers. We will guard against
any possible attempt by the
administration to use one group
of workers against another.
Can USE, a small dedicated
group, by itself survive the
competitive struggle for power
ahead and grow into a large
organization including all
employees at Stanford? Certainly
no one can do it for us. Yet most
independent, company-wide
unions have, in the past, either
been co-opted by the employer,
died a natural death, or affiliated
with a larger labor group. I foresee
the possibility of gaining
additional stability and strength
by linking our employee
organization with similar
employee organizing groups in all
the Universities of this country.
For this we need finances and
other organizational resources,

probably available through the
AFL-CIO, in order to form one
NATIONAL UNION OF
UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES.
Shall we try?

The Stanford community holds
the key to Pete McCloskey's
battle for the Republican
nomination for Congress in the
new 17th Congressional district. It
is crucial for large numbers of the
students, faculty, and staff who
are presently registered as
Democrats or Independents to
change to Republican registration
by April 13 if we are not be
self-muzzled in this campaign.
McCloskey is on the
Republican liquidation list for
daring to challenge the Nixon
leadership. Come and hear him for
yourselves—he will be spending all
day on the campus April 3. He
stands for ending the bombings
and the war immediately; for
ending the senility committee
system that vitiates Congressional
leadership; for integrity—not
ITTegrity in government; for
continuing efforts in conservation
legislation.
His opponent, Dr. Cole, makes

down-the-linism and McCloskey's
refusal to knucle under to party
discipline the main issue. For his
qualifications he lists his
chairmanship of the Republican
Lincoln Day dinner that had "best
ever attendance." He has served
on the Palo Alto School Board
with closed mind, as the watchdog
of the right wing. His curricular
ideas there are quaint—he even
supported hving Genesis taught as
part of a science course.
Nevertheless he is a formidable
opponent—he has the bankroll
and the blessing of the Nixon
leadership -and he comes on with
the simplistic rhetoric of a George
Wallace.
Can you live with the prospect
of national headlines June
7—"Republicans dump liberal
McCloskey for conservative
Cole?"
The McCloskey race may well
be all over by April 13—the
deadline for new and
re-registrations. A groundswell of
Republican registrations at
Stanford can provide the margin
of victory for McCloskey on June
6. Register your support today.

Unionization
Editor, THE DAILY:
The majority of persons voting
for a union in the National Labor
Relations' elections voted for an
outside union because they
believed that only a strongly
organized force could win more
pay and more benefits for them.
Although workers respected
United Stanford Employees
(USE) and come to us for
solutions of their grievances,
many simply do not feel that USE
has the power to force substantial
concessions from the.
administration. Nor do they have
the confidence that USE can
protect them in their jobs. The
barrage of propaganda issued by
CSEA and the Teamsters in the
last week before elections were
both false and the promises
illusory. Had USE the financial
and other resources to counteract
this propaganda and had we had
an open forum where workers
could listen and judge, the tides
would have turned in favor of
USE.
USE, I know, will continue to
organize and mobilize all the
people in the community in
support of workers' needs.
Because of the results of the
election we are immediately faced
with the possibility of a run-off
election between the Teamsters'
Union and no union.
Two million rank and file
members of the Teamsters' Union
can attest to their economic gains
and to the legitimacy of their
Union and no derogatory
statements that it is little different

from big business will convince
them otherwise. The Teamsters'
Union does have the power to win
substantial benefits for Stanford
workers provided it can convince
the majority of workers in the
bargaining unit as well as outside
the unit to support it. Is this
possible? The great majority of
employees here are white collar
workers, most of whom are
women, who cannot identify their
working interests with those of
the Teamsters. Certainly the
technicians in the bargaining unit
have the same problem. There is a
strong anti-Teamster feeling in the
University which I doubt that the
Teamsters can easily overcome.
Antagonism and resentment will
run high if these employees are
forced to join the Teamsters and
pay $7.00 in dues each month.
The no-union vote reflected an
anti-teamster vote as much as an
anti-union vote.
Yet for myself, I must state
that given a choice between the
Teamsters Union and no union, 1
must support those workers who
want the Teamsters to bargain for
them. A vote for no union is a
vote for the administration and
will adversely affect all
employees. USE will, I am certain,
continue to mobilize support for
all workers. We will guard against
any possible attempt by the
administration to use one group
of workers against another.
Can USE, a small dedicated
group, by itself survive the
competitive struggle for power
ahead and grow into a large
organization including all
employees at Stanford? Certainly
no one can do it for us. Yet most
independent, company-wide
unions have, in the past, either
been co-opted by the employer,
died a natural death, or affiliated
with a larger labor group. I foresee
the possibility of gaining
additional stability and strength
by linking our employee
organization with similar
employee organizing groups in all
the Universities of this country.
For this we need finances and
other organizational resources,

probably available through the
AFL-CIO, in order to form one
NATIONAL UNION OF
UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES.
Shall we try?
