Applications for graduate and
professional study at Stanford
have increased more than 50
percent in the past six years at
Stanford, according to a recent
report by Graduate Dean Lincoln
Moses.
The University now receives
more than 10 applications for
every new enrollment in graduate
and professional programs.
In keeping with national
trends, most of the increase stems
from rising student interest in law,
medicine, and business.
