# Track Star Sues Stanford
## 
### 
Stanford University track star
Rodney Utley is no longer fast on
his feet, he declared in a $250,000
damage suit in Superior Court
here against Stanford University
Board of Trustees, track coach
Pay ton Jordan and discus thrower
Steven Davis.
While working on the track
team last year, he said, he was
caused by coach Jordan to walk in

an area in which discus-throwing
was being practiced.
He was hit on the head by a
discus tossed by Davis, he
charged, which resulted in part of
his skull being removed surgically
and causing him other injuries
which to the present time prevent
him from engaging in any
occupation requiring physical or
mental effort.
