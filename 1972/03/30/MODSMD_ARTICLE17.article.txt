The Stanford Glee Club suc
cessfully completed a one week
tour of Central California during
spring break, surviving a hectic
schedule that included 10 per
formances in 5 days.
Accompanied by their own
nine man jazz combo, the group
performed afternoon and evening
concerts in Modesto, Hollister,
Salinas, San Luis Obispo, Morro
Bay, Santa Barbara and Van Nuys.
Their repetoire ranged from

classical pieces by Bach and
Mozart, to show music from
"Stop the World I Want to Get
Off." The jazz combo's numbers
included funky tunes with
unlikely titles such as "Mr. Clean"
and "Werewolf."
The show, entitled "On the
Road," was directed by Robert
Mackinnon. Soloist Katie
Rowland drew accolades at each
performance. And the eight man
Stanford Axidentals added a
comic touch to the show with a
hang loose rock and roll medley
consisting of "Remember Then,"
"Barbara-Ann" and"The Duke of
Earl."
The show's most popular
numbers were "Biting Humans,"
whose text is taken from Dr.
Spock's book on child care, and
"Hey Buds Below" from "On a
Clear Day You Can See Forever."
Cole Porter's "Begin the Beguine"
turned on the older alumni in the
audiences, as did the Stanford
Fight Song and the alma mater.
The group concluded their tour
with an impromptu concert
performance for a parking lot
crowd of McDonalds luncheoners.
