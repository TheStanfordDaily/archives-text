# Cops Take Over Winterland
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Picture if you will a capacity
crowd at Winterland giving the
Sheriff of San Francisco a
standing ovation when he walks
on stage to introduce
Stoneground, the opening act on a
"Jailhouse Rock" show. Your
first reaction upon hearing
something like that might be to
give the person who told you
about it the old "ain't gonna ask
you what you been drinking'
(smokin')" line.
But somebody better reserve
some space in Ripley's, for any
one of about 5000 persons who
saw it happen last Sunday night
will testify to the validity of the
above fact. And San Francisco's
highly controversial 35-year old
sheriff, Richard Hongisto, didn't
stop there.
For the next five hours,
Hongisto, dressed in a
conservative grey suit, could be
seen rocking back and forth at the
back of the stage to the sounds of
Stoneground, the Elvin Bishop
Group and Crosby, Nash &
Young. And during much of the
show, he was joined on stage by
some of his uniformed deputies.
It's all a bit hard to believe, but
to paraphrase one of my
least-favorite ads, "we've come a
long way, baby." "The city that
knows how" now has a sheriff
who believes that when a person is
placed behind bars he doesn't
cease to be a human being.
Peace Symbol
As was predictable, this man
who wears a peace symbol in the
center of his badge, has been the
center of much controversy ever
since his election last year.
Hongisto has been adamant in his
demands for jail reform and
among other things he has made
surprise, unannounced visits to
San Francisco's two county jails
accompanied by newsmen.
He has also allowed newsmen
to spend time in the jails
anonymously as "prisoners" and
this has led to numerous stories
which have informed the San
Francisco public of some prime
examples of man's inhumanity to
man.
So it wasn't hard to believe
that Hongisto would arrange a
benefit concert to aid the welfare
fund of the inmates at the county
jails. Originally he had some
problems getting a bill lined up,
but a couple of weeks ago, when
the show was on the verge of
being cancelled, someone was able
to get David Crosby and
Graham Nash and the show went
on.
It's impossible to know how
many people in the audience came
more out of a desire to hear the
musicians than to help the
inmates, but no matter what their
motives were, they poured
$14,000 into the welfare fund

which according to Hongisto will
be used to buy television sets,
radios, gymnasium equipment,
chess sets and other games,
supplies and a stage for concerts
at the jails.
Rarely has a benefit had a
worthier cause. And luckily the
quality of the music almost
always was as good as that cause.
Solid Rock
Stoneground got off to a slow
start, but they soon showed why
they are definitely one of the
better local rock and roll bands.
This ten-member group
demonstrated a fresh and lively
approach with some fine original
material which is almost always
built on a solid rock foundation.
What is uniquely refreshing
about this group, which includes
four female vocalists, four male
guitarists, a male keyboard artist
and a male drummer, is that
almost every performer gets a
chance to lead on at least one
number. With some bands this
technique can lead to a problem
of inconsistency, but Stoneground
is a mature group that does not
need a chain of command.
They have such a strong
instrumental base to build on that
switching from one vocalist to
another doesn't create the
problems it could. And this group
is a delight to watch since all the
members seem to be having one
hell of a good time performing
and that is a feeling which too few
bands radiate. All in all, they
provided a spirited and
highly-enjoyable set.
In a break from the usual
concert tradition of
chronologically moving up the
totem pole, Stoneground was
followed by the show's headliners,
Crosby and Nash, who after three
numbers were joined by Palo Alto
resident Neil Young. It didn't take
long for these three former
members of one of music's
greatest groups to show why
Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young
reached the status they did.
It is often very hard for
members of groups which have
broken up to play together again,
but although there were a few
rough edges, the three musicians
played together beautifully on
such numbers as "Only Love Can
Break Your Heart, Teach Your
Children, Military Madness," and
"Chicago."
Solo Numbers
But thankfully each performer
also did a couple of solo numbers
in which they each demonstrated
the kind of individual talent
which made the disbanding of
their group probably an inevitable
occurrence.
Crosby was at his individual
best on a terribly expressive
performance of "Almost Cut My
Hair." Nash amply displayed his
combined keyboard and vocal

talents on "So It Goes" and
"Integration Man." But it was
Young who was responsible for
the most moving solo, a terribly
memorable performance of
"Heart of Gold," which definitely
showed why this man with the
truly distinctive and haunting
voice has recently been the most
successful solo artist of the four.
When I thought of all the great
material these three musicians
have produced both collectively
and individually, it was easy to
dream of listening to them for
many, many hours on Sunday
night, but after the encore of
"Chicago" produced a five minute
standing ovation, Bill Graham
came out and told a disappointed
but still very thankful audience
that Crosby, Nash and Young had
other committments to fulfill and
had to leave. Yes it was
disappointing, but it didn't lessen
the impact of a truly memorable
hour.
To follow a set like that is an
obviously inenviable task and
although the Elvin Bishop Group
was good, it wasn't really up to its
usual standards. Somehow many
of Bishop's numbers didn't sound
completely right. Maybe some of
them are becoming a bit stale
since Elvin has been playing so
many of the same songs for so
long. But "Party Till The Cows
Come Home" was still the classic
boogie number it always is.
The night ended up with a jam
which included some of Bishop's
group, some of Santana's
personnel and some other
unidentified musicians. It was
good to hear traces of Santana's
beautifully unique Latin-rock
sound, but on the whole, the jam
never really got off the ground
and it ended pretty quickly.
Overall, it was quite an
enjoyable night, musically
speaking. But the real star of the
night was Sheriff Hongisto. Only
when more people with ideas like
his are in positions of power will
the many ills of our penal system
begin to be cured. After the
concert Hongisto was quoted as
saying "We called it "Jailhouse
Rock No. 1" and there's going to
be a No. 2, 3 and 4." Rock on,
sheriff, rock on.

JAILHOUSE ROCK—Carlos Santana (left), seen here in a Frost Ampitheater concert last year, was one of
the artists who showed up unexpectedly for a late night jam at the "Jailhouse Rock" concert held at
Winterland last Sunday. A capacity crowd earlier heard Stoneground, Crosby, Nash and Young and the
Elvin Bishop Group perform in a show put on by San Francisco Sheriff Richard Hongisto which raised
$14,000 for the welfare fund of the inmates of San Francisco's two county jails.
