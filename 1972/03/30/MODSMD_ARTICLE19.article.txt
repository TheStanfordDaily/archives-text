# Symphony Grows Up
## 
### DAVID WILLIAMS 
The San Francisco Symphony
concert given on Wednesday, the
22nd, was so good, that it is a pity
that a review could not be
published last Thursday because
the Daily and everyone else went
on vacation. Little by little this
orchestra is developing a distinct
sound and an unmistakable style,
that is relatively free of
mannerism.
Seiji seems to encourage the
strings to produce a sound that is
all but perfect for the music of
classical and "neo-classical"
composers, but tends to
concentrate upon the "romantic"
side of these composers; he is best
when conducting works by the
so-called classic romantics of the
nineteenth century, i.e., Berlioz,
Debussy, Brahms, and of course
Beethoven. (One hopes we'll hear
his Schubert sometime.) The very
repetoire has begun to make the
orchestra grow and mature, and
the effect seems more satisfying
each time one goes to hear them.
Even though the strings might
have been more resonant, they
were more than adequate for the
very early Haydn Sinfonia
"Parthia" in B flat, No. 7 in
Haydn's own catalogue of 1805.
The early rococo allegro, a bit
clumsily written in spots, was
carried off with real
understanding.
The very courtly minuet with
its most unconventionally serious
trio was played with such
precision that nearly every phrase
seemed to give the listener a richer
impression of the young
provincial composer's feeling and
attitudes.
Masterful Movement
It was, however, the playing of
the andante that was most
impressive. This movement is
perhaps the most baroque piece of
structure in all of Haydn, except
perhaps the fugues from the early
quartets. At every moment the
composer seems to imitate
someone else, a perfectly normal
mode of procedure in that age;
now Handel, now Gallupi, now
the elder Stamitz, and now
Pergolesi.
The music is essentially a
Roman baroque andante like that
of Vivaldi's one movement
"Sinfonia al Santo Sepolcro," and
is of like seriousness. It is rare to
hear music so sensitively played
and so elegantly executed.
The composer brings it all to a
close with a decidely opera buffa
finale, with several obvious
allusions to Serpina's arias from
La Serua Padrona, and employs a
similarly brisk and sprightly
cosmopolitan style. Here one
might object that Ozawa's
direction didn't do justice to
Haydn's consummate sense of
structure, for one found oneself
adrift in music that is anything
but taxing; still, Haydn is often
treated worse and rarely treated
better.
Unconventionalities
The Schoenberg "Five Pieces
for Orchestra" is frankly a
discovery for which I hardily

thank Mr. Ozawa. Composed in
1909, one year after Das Lied von
der Erde, and four years before
the premiere of Le Sac re du
h-inteinps, it carries what seem
now to be Wagner's conventional
unconventionalities to their
ultimate conclusion.
In the first movement,
"Premonitions," as in the
remaining pieces, the tonalities
"look forward" to Stravinsky; in
the Second piece, 'The Past," the
composer seems to abstract
Mozart, Brahms, and Liszt
through a German Jewish filter,
and seems merely tosigh "ah well"
by way of comment.
The last three movements,
"Colors (The Changing Chord),"
"The Turning Point," and"The
Obbligato Recitative" take us
rather smoothly into the twenties.
The music, written entirely in the
composer's early "pre-tonal"
style, is a real delight, and the
playing was first-rate. Its
structure, more like that of
French keyboard suites (where
each movement has its own
separate identity, and often like
this work of Schoenberg
possessing a descriptive name)
than a German orchestral suite,
where each "movement" is
subservient to the whole, was
exactly perceived and as clear as
crystal.
Better than Ormandy
The concert closed with a
performance of Tchaikowsky's
"Pathetique" symphony,No.6inß
minor opus 74, 1893, a work
destined to receive revived critical
interest as well as continued
popular acclaim, if we will just
allow our prejudices to melt away.
The symphony represents
Tchaikowsky's finest large-scale
symphonic structure, with the
possible exception of the even
more "romantic" Manfred
Symphony of 1885. I admit a
preference for "Pathetique,"
probably because it is more
"classical."
The first movement, a lone
super-Haydnesque slow*

introduction in B minor, leads
into the famous allegro, a
remarkably complex composition
that suggests the superimposition
of the development-recapitulation
formula upon a simple eighteenth
century binary form, with a coda
that is thematically related to the
slow movements of both
Beethoven's Seventh Symphony
and the Ninth of Schubert.
The second movement, Allegro
con grazia, is related to similar
waltz-like structures in the works
of Mendelssohn, Brahms and
Dvorak. The third, Allegro molto
vivace is surely the best of
Tchaikowsky's march-like
movements a la liusse, and is the
perfect prelude to the finale.
Truly the last is the movement
from which the symphony takes
its "nickname," a mad Russian,
Dyonisian, self-conscious,
self-pitying extravaganza, elegant
throughout, and as pathological as
anything in Siegfried.
Ozawa's reading was superb,
better than any of the justly
celebrated Ormandy performances
in some ways, though the effect
of Philadelphia's strings is difficult
to beat, particularly in this work,
where the string writing is so very ,
excellent. Still this oboist in the
first two minutes of the
introduction, perfectly played. In
all a really wonderful evening.

the elder Stamitz, and now
Pergolesi.
The music is essentially a
Roman baroque andante like that
of Vivaldi's one movement
"Sinfonia al Santo Sepolcro," and
is of like seriousness. It is rare to
hear music so sensitively played
and so elegantly executed.
The composer brings it all to a
close with a decidely opera buffa
finale, with several obvious
allusions to Serpina's arias from
La Serua Padrona, and employs a
similarly brisk and sprightly
cosmopolitan style. Here one
might object that Ozawa's
direction didn't do justice to
Haydn's consummate sense of
structure, for one found oneself
adrift in music that is anything
but taxing; still, Haydn is often
treated worse and rarely treated
better.
Unconventionalities
The Schoenberg "Five Pieces
for Orchestra" is frankly a
discovery for which I hardily

thank Mr. Ozawa. Composed in
1909, one year after Das Lied von
der Erde, and four years before
the premiere of Le Sac re du
h-inteinps, it carries what seem
now to be Wagner's conventional
unconventionalities to their
ultimate conclusion.
In the first movement,
"Premonitions," as in the
remaining pieces, the tonalities
"look forward" to Stravinsky; in
the Second piece, 'The Past," the
composer seems to abstract
Mozart, Brahms, and Liszt
through a German Jewish filter,
and seems merely tosigh "ah well"
by way of comment.
The last three movements,
"Colors (The Changing Chord),"
"The Turning Point," and"The
Obbligato Recitative" take us
rather smoothly into the twenties.
The music, written entirely in the
composer's early "pre-tonal"
style, is a real delight, and the
playing was first-rate. Its
structure, more like that of
French keyboard suites (where
each movement has its own
separate identity, and often like
this work of Schoenberg
possessing a descriptive name)
than a German orchestral suite,
where each "movement" is
subservient to the whole, was
exactly perceived and as clear as
crystal.
Better than Ormandy
The concert closed with a
performance of Tchaikowsky's
"Pathetique" symphony,No.6inß
minor opus 74, 1893, a work
destined to receive revived critical
interest as well as continued
popular acclaim, if we will just
allow our prejudices to melt away.
The symphony represents
Tchaikowsky's finest large-scale
symphonic structure, with the
possible exception of the even
more "romantic" Manfred
Symphony of 1885. I admit a
preference for "Pathetique,"
probably because it is more
"classical."
The first movement, a lone
super-Haydnesque slow*

introduction in B minor, leads
into the famous allegro, a
remarkably complex composition
that suggests the superimposition
of the development-recapitulation
formula upon a simple eighteenth
century binary form, with a coda
that is thematically related to the
slow movements of both
Beethoven's Seventh Symphony
and the Ninth of Schubert.
The second movement, Allegro
con grazia, is related to similar
waltz-like structures in the works
of Mendelssohn, Brahms and
Dvorak. The third, Allegro molto
vivace is surely the best of
Tchaikowsky's march-like
movements a la liusse, and is the
perfect prelude to the finale.
Truly the last is the movement
from which the symphony takes
its "nickname," a mad Russian,
Dyonisian, self-conscious,
self-pitying extravaganza, elegant
throughout, and as pathological as
anything in Siegfried.
Ozawa's reading was superb,
better than any of the justly
celebrated Ormandy performances
in some ways, though the effect
of Philadelphia's strings is difficult
to beat, particularly in this work,
where the string writing is so very ,
excellent. Still this oboist in the
first two minutes of the
introduction, perfectly played. In
all a really wonderful evening.
The San Francisco Symphony
concert given on Wednesday, the
22nd, was so good, that it is a pity
that a review could not be
published last Thursday because
the Daily and everyone else went
on vacation. Little by little this
orchestra is developing a distinct
sound and an unmistakable style,
that is relatively free of
mannerism.
Seiji seems to encourage the
strings to produce a sound that is
all but perfect for the music of
classical and "neo-classical"
composers, but tends to
concentrate upon the "romantic"
side of these composers; he is best
when conducting works by the
so-called classic romantics of the
nineteenth century, i.e., Berlioz,
Debussy, Brahms, and of course
Beethoven. (One hopes we'll hear
his Schubert sometime.) The very
repetoire has begun to make the
orchestra grow and mature, and
the effect seems more satisfying
each time one goes to hear them.
Even though the strings might
have been more resonant, they
were more than adequate for the
very early Haydn Sinfonia
"Parthia" in B flat, No. 7 in
Haydn's own catalogue of 1805.
The early rococo allegro, a bit
clumsily written in spots, was
carried off with real
understanding.
The very courtly minuet with
its most unconventionally serious
trio was played with such
precision that nearly every phrase
seemed to give the listener a richer
impression of the young
provincial composer's feeling and
attitudes.
Masterful Movement
It was, however, the playing of
the andante that was most
impressive. This movement is
perhaps the most baroque piece of
structure in all of Haydn, except
perhaps the fugues from the early
quartets. At every moment the
composer seems to imitate
someone else, a perfectly normal
mode of procedure in that age;
now Handel, now Gallupi, now
the elder Stamitz, and now
Pergolesi.

playing was first-rate. Its
structure, more like that of
French keyboard suites (where
each movement has its own
separate identity, and often like
this work of Schoenberg
possessing a descriptive name)
than a German orchestral suite,
where each "movement" is
subservient to the whole, was
exactly perceived and as clear as
crystal.
Better than Ormandy
The concert closed with a
performance of Tchaikowsky's
"Pathetique" symphony,No.6inß
minor opus 74, 1893, a work
destined to receive revived critical
interest as well as continued
popular acclaim, if we will just
allow our prejudices to melt away.
The symphony represents
Tchaikowsky's finest large-scale
symphonic structure, with the
possible exception of the even
more "romantic" Manfred
Symphony of 1885. I admit a
preference for "Pathetique,"
probably because it is more
"classical."
The first movement, a lone
super-Haydnesque slow*

introduction in B minor, leads
into the famous allegro, a
remarkably complex composition
that suggests the superimposition
of the development-recapitulation
formula upon a simple eighteenth
century binary form, with a coda
that is thematically related to the
slow movements of both
Beethoven's Seventh Symphony
and the Ninth of Schubert.
The second movement, Allegro
con grazia, is related to similar
waltz-like structures in the works
of Mendelssohn, Brahms and
Dvorak. The third, Allegro molto
vivace is surely the best of
Tchaikowsky's march-like
movements a la liusse, and is the
perfect prelude to the finale.
Truly the last is the movement
from which the symphony takes
its "nickname," a mad Russian,
Dyonisian, self-conscious,
self-pitying extravaganza, elegant
throughout, and as pathological as
anything in Siegfried.
Ozawa's reading was superb,
better than any of the justly
celebrated Ormandy performances
in some ways, though the effect
of Philadelphia's strings is difficult
to beat, particularly in this work,
where the string writing is so very ,
excellent. Still this oboist in the
first two minutes of the
introduction, perfectly played. In
all a really wonderful evening.
The San Francisco Symphony
concert given on Wednesday, the
22nd, was so good, that it is a pity
that a review could not be
published last Thursday because
the Daily and everyone else went
on vacation. Little by little this
orchestra is developing a distinct
sound and an unmistakable style,
that is relatively free of
mannerism.
Seiji seems to encourage the
strings to produce a sound that is
all but perfect for the music of
classical and "neo-classical"
composers, but tends to
concentrate upon the "romantic"
side of these composers; he is best
when conducting works by the
so-called classic romantics of the
nineteenth century, i.e., Berlioz,
Debussy, Brahms, and of course
Beethoven. (One hopes we'll hear
his Schubert sometime.) The very
repetoire has begun to make the
orchestra grow and mature, and
the effect seems more satisfying
each time one goes to hear them.
Even though the strings might
have been more resonant, they
were more than adequate for the
very early Haydn Sinfonia
"Parthia" in B flat, No. 7 in
Haydn's own catalogue of 1805.
The early rococo allegro, a bit
clumsily written in spots, was
carried off with real
understanding.
The very courtly minuet with
its most unconventionally serious
trio was played with such
precision that nearly every phrase
seemed to give the listener a richer
impression of the young
provincial composer's feeling and
attitudes.
Masterful Movement
It was, however, the playing of
the andante that was most
impressive. This movement is
perhaps the most baroque piece of
structure in all of Haydn, except
perhaps the fugues from the early
quartets. At every moment the
composer seems to imitate
someone else, a perfectly normal
mode of procedure in that age;
now Handel, now Gallupi, now
the elder Stamitz, and now
Pergolesi.
The music is essentially a
Roman baroque andante like that
of Vivaldi's one movement
"Sinfonia al Santo Sepolcro," and
is of like seriousness. It is rare to
hear music so sensitively played
and so elegantly executed.
The composer brings it all to a
close with a decidely opera buffa
finale, with several obvious
allusions to Serpina's arias from
La Serua Padrona, and employs a
similarly brisk and sprightly
cosmopolitan style. Here one
might object that Ozawa's
direction didn't do justice to
Haydn's consummate sense of
structure, for one found oneself
adrift in music that is anything
but taxing; still, Haydn is often
treated worse and rarely treated
better.
Unconventionalities
The Schoenberg "Five Pieces
for Orchestra" is frankly a
discovery for which I hardily

thank Mr. Ozawa. Composed in
1909, one year after Das Lied von
der Erde, and four years before
the premiere of Le Sac re du
h-inteinps, it carries what seem
now to be Wagner's conventional
unconventionalities to their
ultimate conclusion.
In the first movement,
"Premonitions," as in the
remaining pieces, the tonalities
"look forward" to Stravinsky; in
the Second piece, 'The Past," the
composer seems to abstract
Mozart, Brahms, and Liszt
through a German Jewish filter,
and seems merely tosigh "ah well"
by way of comment.
The last three movements,
"Colors (The Changing Chord),"
"The Turning Point," and"The
Obbligato Recitative" take us
rather smoothly into the twenties.
The music, written entirely in the
composer's early "pre-tonal"
style, is a real delight, and the
playing was first-rate. Its
structure, more like that of
French keyboard suites (where
each movement has its own
separate identity, and often like
