# KZSU Requests $3 Assessment

### PATTY FELS 
Sometime in the next two weeks
KZSU will ask students to vote on a
$3 fee assessment for next year.
At a press conference at the KZSU
studios yesterday, Station Manager
John Broholm revealed that the
campus radio station would ask for a
fee assessment from the student body
for the second year in a row.
The station will ask for $1 per
student per quarter, totalling over
$36,000. This year KZSU received $1
per student for only fall quarter —
$12,000.
The fee assessment will be voted on
in a special election before the regular
ASSU spring election, April 12 and 13.
The referendum was submitted before
spring break and ASSU regulations
require that an election be held within
15 days of the beginning of the
quarter.
'Purely Pragmatic'
KZSU wants t':e special election for
"purely pragmatic reasons," according
to Broholm. There are several fee
assessment proposals on the regular
spring ballot and Broholm feels the
KZSU proposal would have a "better
chance" on a separate ballot. Doug
McHenry of the ASSU Council of
Presidents will decide on the date of
the election.
Broholm also told newsnica attend
ing the conference that a new survey
showed that KZSU was tre most
popular radio station among Univer
sity listeners, beating out KIOI in San
Francisco by a full six percent of the
audience.
However, the new popularity of the
station has also caused new problems,
Broholm claims. KZSU wants to be
sure that all members of the Stanford
community are receiving its signal.
Although the transmitter was relocat
ed a year ago and KZSU now reaches a
larger audience, there are still large
areas which are not covered and to
remedy the situation the station wants
to increase its power from 10 to 750
watts.
The power increase will require
nearly $15,000. The fee assessment
will pay for this as well as for new
equipment according to KZSU plans.
No Equipment
"We've got the staff now but we
need „he hardware," explained Bro
holm. "Before we've depended on a

lot of people's enthusiasm but that
only carries you to a certain degree of
technical polish. Beyond that it takes
more money."
Many of KZSU's former sources of
funding have been cut off. Campus
Media Inc., which solicits national
advertising for college radio stations,
went bankrupt recently leaving behind
a $1,000 debt to KZSU. Since most
AM advertising was handled through
Campus Media, KZSU now faces the
problem of new ad sources, Broholm
said.
In past years the University has
financed station improvements, but
budget cut-backs have caused the
University to stop. Sale of public
affairs tapes to the University archives
will also be virtually eliminated, said
Broholm.
The power increase will open new
areas for funding, he claims. When the
station reaches 750 watts it will
qualify for federal aid. The increase
will also be the first step in providing
stereophonic broadcasting.
Broholm explained another factor
making the power increase even more
crucial. In the past the Federal
Communications Commission has at
tempted to force 10-watt stations off
the air since space is in high demand.
KZSU may die altogether unless it can
increase its power, he claimed.
No Refund
There will be no refund provision in
the assessment. When asked whether
KZSU planned to ask for more money
in two years Broholm was uncertain.
However, he noted that this would be
the last power increase.
The results of the poll have made
the staff optimistic if not confident
about the assessment's chances. The
poll was conducted by the station
aithough the caller identified himself
as part of the Midpeninsula Survey
Institute. Each student was asked to
name his three favorite radio stations.
If he mentioned KZSU, he was then
asked specific questions.
Of those students who named
KZSU (36 percent of those question
ed), 75 percent said that they listened
to news broadcasts and live coverage
of campus activities. Half said they
listened to KZSU's interview program,
"Close-up."

No one at KZSU seems quite
certain what will happen if the
assessment doesn't pass. "We'll proba
bly provide sub-standard service for a
year and then try again," Broholm
said. "After all, it took the child care
center two tries."
