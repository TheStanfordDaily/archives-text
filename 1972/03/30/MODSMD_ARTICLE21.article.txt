More Bombs In Belfast
BELFAST — Violence rippled across Northern Ireland and
two bombs rocked Belfast today and yesterday ahead of a
British takeover designed to stop killings in the province.
Protestant militants returned to their jobs at the end of
a two-day strike to protest Britain's seizure of power.
Prime Minister Brian Faulkner and his ministers paid a
farewell visit to Gov. Lord Grey.
A big bomb blast wrecked a street in the center of
Belfast early this morning and killed a British army officer
as London's parliament debated emergency legislation
formalizing British control of this battle-scarred province.
A bomb estimated at up to 150 pounds of gelignite
erupted in downtown Belfast during the evening, blowing
out windows for hundreds of yards and demolishing the
truck in which it was planted.
Authorities already had discovered the explosives and
were trying to burn the gelignite away to prevent it from
exploding. But the blast went off as the plastic-like
substance burned. There were no reports of injuries.
Three gunmen wrecked a co-operative food store in
Belfast's Springfield Road after planting a bomb and
warning staff and customers they had five minutes to get
clear.
Security forces evacuated nearby homes and the
Clanard Roman Catholic Monastry before the bomb went
off 25 minutes later causing no casualties.
Bacon Indicted
SEATTLE — A federal grand jury here has indicted
antiwar activist Leslie Bacon on perjury charges for
allegedly lying to a grand jury last year when she denied
being inside the U.S. Capitol building hours before a
bomb exploded in a men's room.
The secret indictment was issued by the grand jury
here last Friday. It was made public yesterday by U.S.
Attorney Stan Pitkin when a summons for Bacon to
appear here May 5 was served on her four attorneys.
Bacon, then 19, was arrested by FBI agents in
Washington, D.C., as a material witness to the March 1,
1971, explosion in the Senate wing of the Capitol
building. She was taken into custody on April 7 and
ordered transferred to Seattle for a grand jury
investigation.
McGovern Takes Lead
MILWAUKEE — The newest poll shows that Sen. George
McGovern is in the lead for next Tuesday's Democratic
primary in Wisconsin.
The poll had been ordered to see if Alabama Gov.
George E. Wallace's strength was sufficient to warrant an
anti-Wallace drive by the state AFL-CIO.
It showed Wallace fourth with 12 percent, behind
McGovem's 23; Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey's 18, and Sen.
Edmund S. Muskie's 13, but ahead of Sen. Henry M.
Jackson's 11.
John W. Schmitt, president of the labor group, said
Wallace's rating wasn't high enough for a campaign against
the governor.
Kleindienst Hearing May End
WASHINGTON — Chairman James O. Eastland, D-Miss.,
of the Senate Judiciary Committee bowed yesterday to
Republican demands that a vote be taken on ending the
renewed hearings on the nomination of Richard G.
Kleindienst to be attorney general.
The vote, scheduled for Thursday of next week, could
cut off the month-long investigation into Kleindienst's
role in the out-of-court settlement of three antitrust suits
filed by the Justice Department against International
Telephone & Telegraph Corp.
The hearings were begun March 1 at Kleindienst's

request after columnist Jack Anderson alleged there was a
link between the settlement and an ITT pledge of
financial support for the Republican National Convention.
Kleindienst's nomination to succeed Mitchell when the
latter stepped down March 1 to manage President Nixon's
re-election campaign had won unanimous committee
approval prior (o publication of Anderson's accusations.
But the Senate had not acted on the report when the
new hearings were begun Senate majority leader Mike
Mansfield, D-Mont., has said there will be no Senate vote
until the hearings are concluded and the panel votes again
on Kleindienst.
However, Eastland has insisted that nothing derogatory
about Kleindienst has been brought out and he holds the
nomination stili stands approved without need for a
further committee vote.
Harvard Professor Sentenced
BOSTON — Harvard Prof. Samuel Popkin was given a
maximum 18-month jail term yesterday for refusing to
answer questions from a grand jury investigating the
release of the Pentagon Papers.
Popkin's attorney, William Homans, immediately filed
an appeal and Popkin was released in $1,000 personal
recognizance pending the outcome.
Popkin's an associated professor of government and a
"long-time" acquaintance of Dr. Daniel Ellsberg, who has
admitted releasing to the news media the Pentagon Papers
concerning U.S. involvement in Indochina. Popkin was
given the jail term after a civil contempt hearing before
U.S. District Court Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr.
The contempt hearing followed Popkin's refusal
Monday to answer 14 questions put to him by the grand
jury during what he said was about five hours of
testimony.
Under federal law, Popkin can be confined until he
answers the questions, until the grand jury expires or for a
maximum of 18 months if the grand jury continues.
Berrigan Case To Jury
HARRISBURG, Pa. — The government and the defense
completed arguments in the two-month bomb-kidnap
conspiracy trial of the Rev. Philip Berrigan and six other
peace activists yesterday, setting the stage for the jury to
get the case.
U.S. District Court Judge R. Dixon Herman is
scheduled to deliver his charge to the jury of nine women
and three men at 10 a.m. today. Deliberation is expected
to begin shortly thereafter.
Former U.S. Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark ended the
defense with a claim that the case against the seven
defendants was built on paid FBI informer Boyd Douglas
and"the letter," which mentioned the possibility of
kidnapping presidential adviser Henry Kissinger as a means
of forcing a bombing halt in Southeast Asia.
"That's it, isn't it?" Clark demanded.
"Boyd Douglas and the letter—a man you can't believe
and letters that don't say what the government tries to
twist and torture them into saying," he sa'd.
Legal arguments in the case ended with a 90-minute
rebuttal summation by deputy Asst. Atty. Gen. William
Lynch, who replied to Clark:
"Words are the trigger of action, and that is what these
letters are about." He asserted that the defense was unable
to shake the testimony of Douglas in eight days of
cross-examination.
In closing, Lynch declared: "Basically, they are argued
to you not for justice but for pardon . . . these defendants
are guilty as charged."
