# Tougher BAP Cuts Coming
## 
### 
Future cuts in the University
budget are "going to hurt more,"
according to President Richard Ly
man.
"What we've eliminated so far are
the services on the fringes," remarked
Lyman during a KZSU Campus Con
ference Tuesday night. "Accomplish
ing the remainder of the BAP (Budget
Adjustment Program) objectives is
going to be tougher."
BAP represents an effort to cut
University operating costs in order to
reduce the huge deficits the school has
incurred in recent years.
Lyman does not feel the reductions
have had any sweeping impact on
education at Stanford, nor does he
forsee any such effects.
He noted that, "We've just com
pleted a good year of fund-raising, not
very different from past years.
"But fund-raising must and will be
intensified," Lyman added.
The administrative head does not
expect financial relief in the form of
federal funding of higher education in
the immediate future. While two bills
which could deliver large sums of
money to the universities are currently
being discussed in Congressional Con
ference Committees, their fate is
unclear.
"We are not close to a solution as

far as federal spending is concerned,"
Lyman said in summary.
When asked about the proposed
judiciaJ process submitted to the
Committee of Fifteen by the ASSU
Senate, the President said that he
could only judge from newspaper
accounts of the plan, but that it

sounded "pretty cumbersome."
Certain provisions of the system
would include faculty under its juris
diction. Lyman expects that these,
"would probably be unacceptable to
the Faculty, since they are on a
different tack altogether as far as
self-discipline systems are concerned."
