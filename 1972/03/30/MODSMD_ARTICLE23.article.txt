# Bulkeley To Bradley
## 
### 
Engineering Professor Peter Z.
Bulkeley has been named dean of the
950-student College of Engineering
and Technology at Bradley University,
it was announced here by Bradley
President Martin G. Abegg.
The 38-year-old Bulkeley replaces
Abegg, who resigned the engineering
deanship a year ago to become
president of the private, coeducational
midwestern university. The appoint
ment is effective in mid-summer.
'Though I will miss many things
about Stanford I look forward to the
challenging opportunity that Bradley
presents," said Professor Bulkeley.
"There are few universities of distinc
tion in the Middle West that effectively
combine education in engineering and
technology with teaching in the
humanities and liberal arts.
"It seems to me similar to oppor
tunities presented at Stanford 15 or
more years ago. The development
patterns established here offer excel
lent guidelines for like programs at
other institutions, I believe."
Bulkeley has held a number of
administrative posts during his Stan
ford tenure, as well. He is currently
associate chairman of the Mechanical
Engineering Department, and served as
the dean of students for 14 months
from June of 1969 to the summer of

1970.
He joined the faculty in 1957 and
became director of the Design Division
of his department in 1964.
