# Dorm Phone Prefix Shift: Pacific Tel Drops '49'
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Students living in University resi
dence halls will be in for a little
surprise when they have their phones
installed in September.
The 491 prefix now serving the
residence halls is going to vanish
forever this summer. Instead, students
will receive the same service now given
to*Palo Alto telephone users.
R.J. Crouse, Pacific Telephone
manager, called the 491 system "out
dated . .. Mickey Mouse stuff . . .
lousy in general."
The 491 prefix, which serves 1400
campus telephones, was installed two
years ago when the University did
away with the system of using just
one phone to serve an entire residence.
"There are some advantages,"
Crouse admitted. "You can, of course,
reach any other 491 phone with just
four numbers. There is almost instant

service when a customer wants a
phone installed. And we get that small
green directory, that lists only stu
dents, out in just a couple of days
using a computer."
But he said the 491 system was "an
experimental, interim thing, designed
only to last three years." Crouse said
that the installation of new $4.7
million electronic switching equipment
made it possible to get rid of the 491
prefix a year early. He said the new
prefixes will be 327, 328, and 329.
Crouse also pointed out several
advantages to the new service. "It
won't be necessary to dial nine to get
an off-campus number anymore . ..
most of all, though, it means students
can have a limited-service phone, that
allows 20 calls a month or 60 calls a
month at a reduced rate," he ex
plained.
