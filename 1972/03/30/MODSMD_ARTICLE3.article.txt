## Condemned Eugenics Of War 
### MARK WEAVER (Last in a series) 
The eugenic effects of war were of
profound concern to David Starr
Jordan the scientist. Stanford Univer
sity's first president regarded a good
physical and mental inheritance as the
foundation of individual and national
progress.
War destroyed that inheri
tance. It selected the strongest, brav
est, and intelligent young men to
die in battle. As Jordan saw it, this left
the puny, deformed, and unmanly to
breed the next generation. The result
could only be social and cultural
decline.
Dr. Jordan wrote that "In the life
of a nation the vital differences are not
matters of education, but of heredi

tary potentialities." He regarded the
greater portion of poverty and crime
as products of persons who were of
inherently inferior racial material and
slums as hoppers for the misfits and
those who were born too weak to
survive in the struggle for existence.
He wrote that ultimately, "a good
stock is the only material out of which
history can make a great nation."
Given the proper heredity, Jordan
asserted, education would take care of
itself. The 50 cent boy just could not
handle it. Nevertheless, he believed
that every man had a right to some
form of higher education, lecturing
that the rewards of college must be
accessible to "the multitude," not as
gifts, but as rights "to be taken by
those who can hold them." But the
poor man was solely responsible for
providing the means for acquiring this
education.
Educated Minds
Higher education, according to
Jordan, brought one in contact with
the great minds of the past and
widened his horizons. The uneducated
man, he said, looks out on life through
a narrow window and thinks the world
is small. "The whole of your life must
be spent in your own company," he
advised, "and only the edcuated man
is good company for himself."
Jordan had little respect for the
man without an education: "I have
heard of a poor man in Wisconsin who
earns a half-dollar every day by driving
a cow to pasture. He watches her all
day as she eats, and then drives her
home at night. This is all he does. Put
here your half-dollar and there your
man. The one balances the other, and
the one enriches the world as much as
the other. If it were not for the cow,
the world would not need that man at
all!"
College was good. It intensified the
individuality of man. For Jordan, the
rugged individualist, education had to
accentuate the diversity of men, not
their uniformity. The diversity of
women mattered too. One of the

strongest arguments for co-education,
as Jordan expounded it, was that it
enhanced the moral tone of the
students. With regard to allowing
women to be taught in the same
classes as men, Jordan conceded, "This
is partly a matter of taste."
"Taste" concerned the first presi
dent of Stanford. He was a moralist.
"At a dinner party we were passing
around a box of cigars," Edgar
Robinson recalls, "Someone reached

for one and Jordan said, under his
breath, 'Do have one, and anyone who
smokes is a fool.' But he laughed
about it. He was full of humor."
Puritan Ethic
The Stanford educator possessed a
Puritan ethic of considerable severity.
To him, Nature was a harsh mistress
who ruthlessly eliminated the unfit
and preserved only the best for the
critically important missions of life.

PEACE AND PURlTY—Stanford's first President, David Starr Jordan, was not
only a dedicated pacifist who once protested against the "sudden outburst of
military zeal" at Stanford but was also a strict moralist who neither drank or
smoked. Jordan's interest in eugenics led him to conclude that war eliminated all
the "best stock" leaving mostly inferior men to populate the earth.
lie wno wanted to participate had to
conserve every ounce of physical and
nervous energy. By leaving even minor
indulgences to his competitors he
could safeguard his fullest effective
ness.
Alcohol, the moriuist regarded as a
potent factor in race degeneration. It
forced the nervous system to lie by
giving a feeling of vigor when the basis
of such a feeling did not exist.
Anything which reduced the truthful
ness of a sensation, thought, or action
would produce nervous disintegration.
Jordan particularly condemned
drinking because it broke down the
restraints of decency and opened the
way for more flagrant vices. Even the
glass of dinner wine was taboo, along
with cigarettes, coffee, and tea. Total

abstinence was the only safe rule, he
insisted.
With regard to sexual mores, Dr.
Jordan believed the chastity of women
was "society's most precious jewel."
The pure woman who knows the
truth, "will turn from the man who
touches her hand in wantonness as she
would turn from a rattlesnake."
Jordan did find two pure women,
marrying Jessie Knight after his first
wife died. It was with Jessie that he
shared most of the exploits which
ended with his death in 1931 at the
age of 80. David Starr Jordan left this
poetic epitaph:
A darkening sky and whitening sea.
And the wind in the palm trees tall;
Soon or late comes a call for me,
Down from the mountains or up from
the sea,
Then let me lie where I fall.
And a friend may write — for friends
there be,
On a stone from the gray sea wall,
"Jungle and town and reef and sea
I loved God's Earth and His Earth
loved me,
Taken for all in all. "
