# 'Shockley 3'Defense Walks Out
## 
### KEVIN SMITH JAMES LOBSENZ 
The defendants and their counsel
walked out as the Campus Judicial
Panel hearings of three students
charged with disrupting Professor
William Shockley's January 18 class
concluded yesterday. The three defen
dants are Don Lee, Alice Furumoto,
and Kwonping Ho.
In a statement read immediately
following hearing officer Henry Ram
sey's denial of a defense motion to
limit prosecution questioning, the
defense stated that they had cooper

ated with the hearings even though
they "considered the CJP to be an
illegitimate body and the charges to be
false."
The defense continued, "co-opera
tion becomes collaboration . . . when a
hearing to determine facts becomes an
opportunity to begin a witchhunt
against all those persons whom the
Administration wants to eliminate."
They charged that the Administra
tion does not want "to find the facts
and bring justice to this case," but
rather is using the hearings as "an
inquisition of all politically active
people."
The defense claimed that in order
"to continue ... an effective defense
we must identify people for the
Administration's witchhunt," since
there were no "provisions against
incriminations" during the hearings.
'Moratorium'
The statement also called for a
"moratorium on all CJP cases" until
the new judicial system proposed by

the Student Senate is "offered to the
student body in a binding referendum
. .. during the upcoming Presidential
elections."
Ramsey denied the request to bar
the prosecution from asking "witch
hunt" questions of defense witnesses
because he was "not interested in Mr.
Schwartz's motives" if the questions
were relevant.
Schwartz confirmed the defense
suspicions by stating, "I am going to
ask every question I can think of as to
who was there and what they were
doing." The three defendants had
planned to take the stand themselves
subject to a favorable ruling.
Earlier in the afternoon, Ramsey
also denied a prosecution request to
re-open the case of Gerry Foote by
recalling KZSU news analyst Charlie
Bennett to the stand.
Bennett, the only defense witness
officially presented in the case, testi
fied Monday after the prosecution had
agreed to close Foote's case. It was

only after Bennett's testimony had
been heard that the prosecution
decided to try to expand its case
against her.
'New Evidence'
Special Assistant to the President
John Schwartz, who is prosecuting the
case, claimed that Bennett's testimony
is "basically the same thing as new
evidence having been discovered after
both sides had rested."
Schwartz went on to say that the
purpose of the hearing is "to obtain
the truth and to get as much
information as you can." He said
failure to reopen a case under these
circumstances "would prejudice one
side or another and would not be
fair."
The defense objected that once the
prosecution has rested, it should not
be allowed to re-open its case.
Co-counsel Zach Wasserman stated, "I
don't think Mr. Schwartz has shown
enough diligence to warrant his bring
ing in a new witness that we found."
Ramsey denied the motion on the
grounds that Schwartz "should have
charged people jointly if he felt they
were aiding and abetting each other"
and that the defense counsel has
"done a tremendous and masterful
job, but the fact remains they are
inexperienced, and I don't want their
inexperience" to hurt their clients.
After the walkout, Troy Barbee, lab
director for the Center for Materials
Research, was recalled by the prosecu
tion to complete the case against
Foote. This had already been agreed to
by Ramsey before Bennett had given
his testimony.
On Monday, Schwartz had told the
defense that the only thing Barbee
would testify to was that the same
woman who had kicked Barbee inside
of Shockley's classroom was later seen
by Barbee outside in the haliway.
Two New Pictures
However, when Barbee took the
stand, Schwartz introduced two new
pictures and asked Barbee if he could
identify the woman who had kicked
him from those pictures.
In not allowing Barbee to respond,
Ramsey declared "There was no
indication there would be photographs
introduced ... I don't want anyone to
be 1 misled."
Schwartz then gave Barbee a
picture that had already been identi
fied as Foote by Stanford Police
Photographer Nick Brunot. Barbee
testified that two days after the
incident, he had identified the woman
in the photo as the one who had
kicked him.
The first day of the hearing,
however, Barbee had identified
another woman in the hearing room as
the one who had kicked him. Schwartz
never did ask whether or not Barbee
saw the woman in the hallway â€” the
purported reason for recalling the
witness.
Schwartz and the defense will
submit written final arguments by
April 7, and in addition, Schwartz will
present oral final arguments Monday
at 1:30 p.m.
