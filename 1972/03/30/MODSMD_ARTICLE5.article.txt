# Davis Opens, Asserts Innocence
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
SAN JOSE — Angela Davis, acting as
her own counsel, yesterday denied
having any personal involvement in the
Marin courthouse shootout that ended
with four persons killed.
She told the jurors, "The evidence
will show that I am totally innocent of
all the charges against me. The
prosecutor's evidence will prove that
his case is no case at all."
The defendant's statement followed
a lengthy voir dire of the jurors
concerning whether the attempted jail
escape which caused the cancellation
of Tuesday's session would prejudice
them in this case. After Davis' two
hour opening statement, the prosecu
tion presented its first witness, a
woman who was taken hostage and
wounded in the August 1970 shoot
out.
The witness, Maria Graham, de
scribed in detail her ordeal including
having seen Judge Harold Haley's face
blown off. While not connecting Davis
directly to the events, Graham did
testify that the kidnappers said they
were going to the San Francisco
airport. The prosecution claims that
Davis was waiting at the airport during
the shootout.
Opening Statement
In her opening statement Davis told
the jurors, "the prosecutor must prove
three things. First, he must prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that there
was a plan. Second he must prove that
1 had foreknowledge of a plan. Third
he must prove that I deliberately took
steps to promote a plan. He will not be
able to prove these three things
because they are not true."
"You must keep your eyes focused
on two issues even if there was a plan.
Those issues are knowledge and
intent ... as the prosecutor presents

evidence about the events of August 7,
you must ask, what bearing do those
events have—the only bearing is
whether I had knowledge and intent,"
she said.
'Passion' Motive
Davis disputed the widely
publicized "passion" motive revealed
by the prosecution Monday, saying,
"The evidence will show that as the
movement [to free the Soledad
brothers] progressed, I developed a
deep affection for George Jackson.
And I also felt a deep compassion and
love for Fleeta Drumgo and John
Clutchette.
"My love and affection for George
Jackson grew, but it was not until I
was arrested and" was a political
prisoner like him that my relationship
with George Jackson grew stronger
and my affection deeper."
She continued, "The prosecutor
would like to take advantage of the
fact that I am a woman, for in our
society, women are supposed to act on
the dictates of emotion. This is clearly
a symptom of the male chauvinism in
our society."
Davis also spent considerable time
outlining her political activities and
her upbringing, which she said made

the ownership and use of guns for
self-defense a natural part of her life.
"You will understand," she told
jurors, "that for a black person who
grew up in the South . . . guns were a
normal fact of life."
She said that she sometimes bought
weapons for friends "much as I would
pay the rent if one of my friends
couldn't or purchase medical supplies
if they were needed ... It was no
secret that I was the owner of
weapons."
Expert Markswoman
In addition, she said she became an
expert markswoman, practicing at
target ranges throughout Southern
California. This, she said, explained
her possession of ammunition.
She labeled the charges against her
"a political frameup" stemming from
her Communist affiliations and begin
ning when she was fired from her
UCLA teaching job.
Denying knowledge of the intent of
Jonathan Jackson in his kidnap at
tempt, Davis said the "angry frustra
tion of a young man who had no
memory of his brother that was not
obscured by prison bars," is something
she did not understand until after
having been imprisoned herself.
