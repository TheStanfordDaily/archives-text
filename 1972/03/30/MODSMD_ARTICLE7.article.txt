## Freedom From The Dictates Of Ideas 
### 
Barry wood

Modern civilized man is
probably best defined as man
living according to the dictates of
ideas. Living by ideas is believed
to be the sane way to live and the
unique achievement of rational
man. A proverb has it that there is
nothing so powerful as a great
idea whose time has come.
What we fail to grasp is that
the sanity of living by ideas is
itself only an idea of what is sane,
and the notion that a great idea is
tremendously powerful is itself
just one idea of what power-is. We
are caught in a vicious circle of
thinking about thoughts and
idealizing ideas. Quite literally, we
have lost our sense by letting it go
to our heads.
I've been thinking for some
time about how ideas enslave us. I
am particularly amused at the way
people will defend ideas furiously,
and how in the past men have
died for them. I am appalled at
how we spin problems out of our
own heads and then go to war
over them. I am tickled at how
everybody wants to convert
someone else, which means
getting agreement on ideas.

Take modern war, for example.
There was a time when wars were
over concrete goodies, like the
enemies corn patch, or his cache
of gold, or the luscious bodies of
his beautiful women, which were
carefully carried off unharmed.
Today we fight wars over ideas
and ideologies, and since
ideologies refuse to be erased, we
literally have to tear down the
landscape until there is nothing
left worth taking. This is sickness
unto death, and it's all in the
head.
Notions
No doubt some will deny this,
claiming that our wars are over
"real" issues like "containing
communism," "maintaining
power," or "expanding the
economy." But what is "real," is
someone's idea, is the notion
that communism needs to be
contained or that you get power
when you have contained it. It is
only an idea that the economy has
expanded—as is revealed if you
consider what the word
"economy" really means in a
garbage producing society like our
own. The fact is that when we act

upon some kinds of ideas, they
merely enslave us.
Take for example a brand of
student radical who thinks (a
revealing word) he is free from the
ideology of American imperialism.
He claims he is free because he
reads Marx, Lenin and Mao rather
than Keynes or Galbraith, whereas
he is simply enslaved to different
ideas. If you doubt this, look at
how he feels a "duty" to man the
little table on the grass selling the
thoughts of Mao. He is enslaved to
ideas in a little Red Book as surely
as his missionary friends at the
next table are enslaved to the
little Black Book.
I would like to put this as
politely as possible. Freedom is
not an idea, it is freedom from
ideas, including ideologies,
abstractions, beliefs, symbols and
systems. Being absolutely certain
and committed is idea-lized these
days, but is really a very dull
business of clinging to what has
been found without the
inconvenience of a further search.
Further searching, of course,
uncovers another book behind
both the black book and the red

on—and another book behind
that, and yet another. But surely
amid this welter of ideas it should
eventually come clear that truth is
not in ideas at all, but in your
head.
Opinions
Truth resides in where you
decide to put it. If you claim
truth for a book, an institution,
an ideology, the idea it is true in
your opinion. If you are the most
rigorous Catholic claiming that
Truth resides in the Church and
the Pope and God Himself—this is
your opinion. If you claim you
got it by revelation, what
constitutes revelation still boils
down to your opinion. Ultimately
Truth always boils down to a
choice you have to make.
Once you see this, education
becomes not the search for The
True Idea, but a systematic
freeing of oneself from their
bondage. Not that they aren't
useful, but their use is that of
tools. To claim that only a
"Marxist analysis" will work is
like the carpenter who insists on
using only a hammer to build a
house, since all other tools are
false.
At this point some of you are
disturbed. You feel your neat,
secure world of private truths
endangered and you therefore call
me a nihilist, an anarchist, or
downright immoral. "You have to

have ideas to build upon." But
what, I ask, will you build your
ideas upon—unless it's just
another idea? How will you test
your ideas without first assuming
an idea of what test will work?
And how will you be certain of
the result unless you first assume
an idea of what certainty means?
The fact is, we live on a
floating world, in a very odd
universe. It has no bottom! Think
about that. Try to figure out
where you can find a "true"
reference point from which to
draw conclusions. Try to find a
foundation that is not completely
arbitrary. For ultimately an idea is
like a satellite in space—it stays
"up" only by virtue of its
momentum. Most of the great
religions and ideologies are like
that. They just keep going
without resting on anything at all.
The terrors of this floating
world are what make men cry out
to God—though the notion that
this will work is itself only an
idea. Assuming that He hears, he
is probably looking for a place to
stand and is not at all sure of his
coordinates. When you get THIS,
it is time to laugh a little, start
throwing out all the conceptual
claptrap, and start enjoying this
very odd life on a floating world.
This you can all do—even without
any ideas of how to go about it.

how he feels a "duty" to man the
little table on the grass selling the
thoughts of Mao. He is enslaved to
ideas in a little Red Book as surely
as his missionary friends at the
next table are enslaved to the
little Black Book.
I would like to put this as
politely as possible. Freedom is
not an idea, it is freedom from
ideas, including ideologies,
abstractions, beliefs, symbols and
systems. Being absolutely certain
and committed is idea-lized these
days, but is really a very dull
business of clinging to what has
been found without the
inconvenience of a further search.
Further searching, of course,
uncovers another book behind
both the black book and the red

on—and another book behind
that, and yet another. But surely
amid this welter of ideas it should
eventually come clear that truth is
not in ideas at all, but in your
head.
Opinions
Truth resides in where you
decide to put it. If you claim
truth for a book, an institution,
an ideology, the idea it is true in
your opinion. If you are the most
rigorous Catholic claiming that
Truth resides in the Church and
the Pope and God Himself—this is
your opinion. If you claim you
got it by revelation, what
constitutes revelation still boils
down to your opinion. Ultimately
Truth always boils down to a
choice you have to make.
Once you see this, education
becomes not the search for The
True Idea, but a systematic
freeing of oneself from their
bondage. Not that they aren't
useful, but their use is that of
tools. To claim that only a
"Marxist analysis" will work is
like the carpenter who insists on
using only a hammer to build a
house, since all other tools are
false.
At this point some of you are
disturbed. You feel your neat,
secure world of private truths
endangered and you therefore call
me a nihilist, an anarchist, or
downright immoral. "You have to

have ideas to build upon." But
what, I ask, will you build your
ideas upon—unless it's just
another idea? How will you test
your ideas without first assuming
an idea of what test will work?
And how will you be certain of
the result unless you first assume
an idea of what certainty means?
The fact is, we live on a
floating world, in a very odd
universe. It has no bottom! Think
about that. Try to figure out
where you can find a "true"
reference point from which to
draw conclusions. Try to find a
foundation that is not completely
arbitrary. For ultimately an idea is
like a satellite in space—it stays
"up" only by virtue of its
momentum. Most of the great
religions and ideologies are like
that. They just keep going
without resting on anything at all.
The terrors of this floating
world are what make men cry out
to God—though the notion that
this will work is itself only an
idea. Assuming that He hears, he
is probably looking for a place to
stand and is not at all sure of his
coordinates. When you get THIS,
it is time to laugh a little, start
throwing out all the conceptual
claptrap, and start enjoying this
very odd life on a floating world.
This you can all do—even without
any ideas of how to go about it.

Modern civilized man is
probably best defined as man
living according to the dictates of
ideas. Living by ideas is believed
to be the sane way to live and the
unique achievement of rational
man. A proverb has it that there is
nothing so powerful as a great
idea whose time has come.
What we fail to grasp is that
the sanity of living by ideas is
itself only an idea of what is sane,
and the notion that a great idea is
tremendously powerful is itself
just one idea of what power-is. We
are caught in a vicious circle of
thinking about thoughts and
idealizing ideas. Quite literally, we
have lost our sense by letting it go
to our heads.
I've been thinking for some
time about how ideas enslave us. I
am particularly amused at the way
people will defend ideas furiously,
and how in the past men have
died for them. I am appalled at
how we spin problems out of our
own heads and then go to war
over them. I am tickled at how
everybody wants to convert
someone else, which means
getting agreement on ideas.

Take modern war, for example.
There was a time when wars were
over concrete goodies, like the
enemies corn patch, or his cache
of gold, or the luscious bodies of
his beautiful women, which were
carefully carried off unharmed.
Today we fight wars over ideas
and ideologies, and since
ideologies refuse to be erased, we
literally have to tear down the
landscape until there is nothing
left worth taking. This is sickness
unto death, and it's all in the
head.
Notions
No doubt some will deny this,
claiming that our wars are over
"real" issues like "containing
communism," "maintaining
power," or "expanding the
economy." But what is "real," is
someone's idea, is the notion
that communism needs to be
contained or that you get power
when you have contained it. It is
only an idea that the economy has
expanded—as is revealed if you
consider what the word
"economy" really means in a
garbage producing society like our
own. The fact is that when we act

upon some kinds of ideas, they
merely enslave us.
Take for example a brand of
student radical who thinks (a
revealing word) he is free from the
ideology of American imperialism.
He claims he is free because he
reads Marx, Lenin and Mao rather
than Keynes or Galbraith, whereas
he is simply enslaved to different
ideas. If you doubt this, look at
how he feels a "duty" to man the
little table on the grass selling the
thoughts of Mao. He is enslaved to
ideas in a little Red Book as surely
as his missionary friends at the
next table are enslaved to the

draw conclusions. Try to find a
foundation that is not completely
arbitrary. For ultimately an idea is
like a satellite in space—it stays
"up" only by virtue of its
momentum. Most of the great
religions and ideologies are like
that. They just keep going
without resting on anything at all.
The terrors of this floating
world are what make men cry out

idea. Assuming that He hears, he

very odd life on a floating world.

Modern civilized man is
probably best defined as man
living according to the dictates of
ideas. Living by ideas is believed
to be the sane way to live and the
unique achievement of rational
man. A proverb has it that there is
nothing so powerful as a great
idea whose time has come.
What we fail to grasp is that
the sanity of living by ideas is
itself only an idea of what is sane,
and the notion that a great idea is
tremendously powerful is itself
just one idea of what power-is. We
are caught in a vicious circle of
thinking about thoughts and
idealizing ideas. Quite literally, we
have lost our sense by letting it go
to our heads.
I've been thinking for some
time about how ideas enslave us. I
am particularly amused at the way
people will defend ideas furiously,
and how in the past men have
died for them. I am appalled at
how we spin problems out of our
own heads and then go to war
over them. I am tickled at how
everybody wants to convert
someone else, which means
getting agreement on ideas.

Take modern war, for example.
There was a time when wars were
over concrete goodies, like the
enemies corn patch, or his cache
of gold, or the luscious bodies of
his beautiful women, which were
carefully carried off unharmed.
Today we fight wars over ideas
and ideologies, and since
ideologies refuse to be erased, we
literally have to tear down the
landscape until there is nothing
left worth taking. This is sickness
unto death, and it's all in the
head.
Notions
No doubt some will deny this,
claiming that our wars are over
"real" issues like "containing
communism," "maintaining
power," or "expanding the
economy." But what is "real," is
someone's idea, is the notion
that communism needs to be
contained or that you get power
when you have contained it. It is
only an idea that the economy has
expanded—as is revealed if you
consider what the word
"economy" really means in a
garbage producing society like our
own. The fact is that when we act

upon some kinds of ideas, they
merely enslave us.
Take for example a brand of
student radical who thinks (a
revealing word) he is free from the
ideology of American imperialism.
He claims he is free because he
reads Marx, Lenin and Mao rather
than Keynes or Galbraith, whereas
he is simply enslaved to different
ideas. If you doubt this, look at
how he feels a "duty" to man the
little table on the grass selling the
thoughts of Mao. He is enslaved to
ideas in a little Red Book as surely
as his missionary friends at the
next table are enslaved to the
little Black Book.
I would like to put this as
politely as possible. Freedom is
not an idea, it is freedom from
ideas, including ideologies,
abstractions, beliefs, symbols and
systems. Being absolutely certain
and committed is idea-lized these
days, but is really a very dull
business of clinging to what has
been found without the
inconvenience of a further search.
Further searching, of course,
uncovers another book behind
both the black book and the red

on—and another book behind
that, and yet another. But surely
amid this welter of ideas it should
eventually come clear that truth is
not in ideas at all, but in your
head.
Opinions
Truth resides in where you
decide to put it. If you claim
truth for a book, an institution,
an ideology, the idea it is true in
your opinion. If you are the most
rigorous Catholic claiming that
Truth resides in the Church and
the Pope and God Himself—this is
your opinion. If you claim you
got it by revelation, what
constitutes revelation still boils
down to your opinion. Ultimately
Truth always boils down to a
choice you have to make.
Once you see this, education
becomes not the search for The
True Idea, but a systematic
freeing of oneself from their
bondage. Not that they aren't
useful, but their use is that of
tools. To claim that only a
"Marxist analysis" will work is
like the carpenter who insists on
using only a hammer to build a
house, since all other tools are
false.
At this point some of you are
disturbed. You feel your neat,
secure world of private truths
endangered and you therefore call
me a nihilist, an anarchist, or
downright immoral. "You have to

have ideas to build upon." But
what, I ask, will you build your
ideas upon—unless it's just
another idea? How will you test
your ideas without first assuming
an idea of what test will work?
And how will you be certain of
the result unless you first assume
an idea of what certainty means?
The fact is, we live on a
floating world, in a very odd
universe. It has no bottom! Think
about that. Try to figure out
where you can find a "true"
reference point from which to
draw conclusions. Try to find a
foundation that is not completely
arbitrary. For ultimately an idea is
like a satellite in space—it stays
"up" only by virtue of its
momentum. Most of the great
religions and ideologies are like
that. They just keep going
without resting on anything at all.
