Behold, Spring is around the corner, and the Income Tax form is
littering the countryside.
If, however, you still have that aching feeling in your pocketbook
from last year, and if you are nursing a deep grudge in your heart, let
me explain to you some of the ways in which you can, quite legally,
inflict your revenge upon the collectors of eternal revenue, at
absolutely no risk to yourself. I do not expect you to try to do all
these things; indeed, some of them are mutually exclusive. All of them
are guaranteed to cause the infernal revenue service no little
annoyance.
1. Write them letters to ask them questions. These can be serious
questions or frivolous questions, such as "Can I deduct my dog's vet
bills?" (Answer, NO!) But they will have to reply, since they are civil
servants, and this will use time that otherwise could be spent harassing
some poor taxpayer.
2. Usually it takes them 10 to 20 days to answer a letter so after 7
or 8 days, send them a follow-up. (Better yet start off with a
follow-up with out bothering to send the original!) Here, in case
you're interested, is a general purpose follow up letter that I use:
"Dear Madam or Sir, as the case may be: On or about—l sent you—.
As I have yet received no reply, I am concerned that my letter, or
your answer to it, may have become lost in the mail. Did you receive it?
-YES -NO
If so, what do you intend to do about it?
If not, I will .
I enclose a (stamped) self-addressed envelope for your reply.
Please excuse this form letter. It is a necessary way of saving time
and expense."
This usually gets results, as they hate for you to send them a form
letter. If not, keep sending them, with carbons to your senator, etc.
3. Last year the Martinsburg Monster detected 5 million arithmetic
errors on tax returns, of which 2 million were in the government's
favor. Each of the 5 million returns requires extra processing, often by
hand. An error of even 10c costs the government just as much as an
error of $10.00. Notice also, that by the law of averages, at least half
the errors should have been in the government's favor. Someone is
letting his dislike of paying taxes influence his arithmetic.

4. If you are going to make an error in arithmetic, it is safer to
make it in the government's favor. Then you can file an Amended
Return and apply for a refund. An Amended Return is just like the
original return, except that you write the words "Amended Return"
in large letters at the top of the page and correct the error. This causes
the government to process your return twice. Please do not be
dissuaded by any feeling of compassion for the clerical employees of
the IRS. Remember that according to the Talmud, tax gatherers are
classed with burglars and bandits.
5. Do NOT use the preprinted form that the Government supplies;
it is for their convenience, not yours, use a blank form.
6. Change the way that you write your name from year to year; if
you used John H. Reb last year, use Johnny Reb or J. Hugh Reb or
J.H. Reb.
7. Do not write the social security number in the space provided.
Instead, write, "See W-2, attached" or words to that effect. Likewise,
put all possible information on separate sheets of paper and write "see
attached".
8. Change your occupation from year to year. If you are an
undertaker, for example write "planter" or "last resort".
9. Use your children's nicknames every other year: Bud, Sissie.
10. Enter the written figures on the wrong line. For example, if
you have farm income put it on line 37 or 38 instead of 39.
11. Attach to your tax return a copy of some irrelevant matter,
such as a letter your Aunt Minnie sent you about her arthritis. This is
particularly helpful if you are claiming sick pay on form 2440.
12. By all means fill out and attach Form 4130 for the gasoline
you used in yourlawnmower. This gives you a small refund of gas tax.
13. If you end up having to pay additional tax, do not pay all of it
at once. Pay part of it and let the government bill you for the rest.
They will, of course, charge you interest, but where else can you
borrow money at 6 percent simple interest these days?
14. Do NOT write in your return address on the envelope. If you
want to cause some extra bother, put a lc stamp on the envelope and
let the IRS and the USPOD argue over the postage due.
15. Attach a copy of the Bill of Rights and refer them to it at the
appropriate places. Article IV (unreasonable search and seizure) is
most appropriate. You might also notice I, V, VIII, IX, X.
16. The laws forbidding the giving of false information do not
mean that you have to cooperate with the government. Remember the
boy who came to the question "Sex?" and wrote "very seldom." This
was true, even if it was not what the questionnaire was trying to find
out.
17. Attach the papers of your tax return in random order. This
leads to much hunting and searching. Also put one backwards or
upside down.
18. If you want to "forget" anything, I recommend forgetting to
sign the check, if you have to pay.
19. Take all your information, in a shoe box, down to the IRS
office and tell them that you need help in preparing your return. They
are required to help taxpayers. I especially urge doing this during the
2nd week in April, but if you don't like to wait in line, go earlier. Do
NOT take their word for what you owe them, however. Check it, or
have an accountant check it. They will make mistakes in the
goven.ment's favor.
20. When in doubt about a deduction, claim it; let them prove
you're not entitled to it, if they check.
21. Send your tax return to some other IRS Center than the one
for your area. If you live in California, you might consider sending it
to the Amherst, Mass. center.
22. Be sure that all pages of your return are well fastened together.
After all, you don't want them losing part of it. If you use staples,
staple at least 3 sides. Better yet, use glue, or safetypins.
23. You've been wondering what to do with all that aftershave
lotion you got for Christmas? Well, you might spill a little on the tax
return. It may smudge a little. It may stink a lot. n
24. Transpose numerals in your Social Security number. Thik
keeps them from locating last year's file as fast.
25. Call up the IRS offices, and ?sk them for some uncommon
form; it isn't your fault if it late; turns out that you don't need it.
Good ones to ask for are Schedule G, Income Averaging, or Form
1040 ES, Declaration of Estimated Tax, or Form 2333, Request for
Forms.
26. File a Declaration of Estimated Tax for 4c. You will have to
pay this in four installments: April 15, June 15, September 15, and
January 15. After all, you might have income that's not on your W-2
next year; you knows?
27. Cross out some of the lines on the tax return, and write in
your own names for them.

This usually gets results, as they hate for you to send them a form
letter. If not, keep sending them, with carbons to your senator, etc.
3. Last year the Martinsburg Monster detected 5 million arithmetic
errors on tax returns, of which 2 million were in the government's
favor. Each of the 5 million returns requires extra processing, often by
hand. An error of even 10c costs the government just as much as an
error of $10.00. Notice also, that by the law of averages, at least half
the errors should have been in the government's favor. Someone is
letting his dislike of paying taxes influence his arithmetic.

4. If you are going to make an error in arithmetic, it is safer to
make it in the government's favor. Then you can file an Amended
Return and apply for a refund. An Amended Return is just like the
original return, except that you write the words "Amended Return"
in large letters at the top of the page and correct the error. This causes
the government to process your return twice. Please do not be
dissuaded by any feeling of compassion for the clerical employees of
the IRS. Remember that according to the Talmud, tax gatherers are
classed with burglars and bandits.
5. Do NOT use the preprinted form that the Government supplies;
it is for their convenience, not yours, use a blank form.
6. Change the way that you write your name from year to year; if
you used John H. Reb last year, use Johnny Reb or J. Hugh Reb or
J.H. Reb.
7. Do not write the social security number in the space provided.
Instead, write, "See W-2, attached" or words to that effect. Likewise,
put all possible information on separate sheets of paper and write "see
attached".
8. Change your occupation from year to year. If you are an
undertaker, for example write "planter" or "last resort".
9. Use your children's nicknames every other year: Bud, Sissie.
10. Enter the written figures on the wrong line. For example, if
you have farm income put it on line 37 or 38 instead of 39.
11. Attach to your tax return a copy of some irrelevant matter,
such as a letter your Aunt Minnie sent you about her arthritis. This is
particularly helpful if you are claiming sick pay on form 2440.
12. By all means fill out and attach Form 4130 for the gasoline
you used in yourlawnmower. This gives you a small refund of gas tax.
13. If you end up having to pay additional tax, do not pay all of it
at once. Pay part of it and let the government bill you for the rest.
They will, of course, charge you interest, but where else can you
borrow money at 6 percent simple interest these days?
14. Do NOT write in your return address on the envelope. If you
want to cause some extra bother, put a lc stamp on the envelope and
let the IRS and the USPOD argue over the postage due.
15. Attach a copy of the Bill of Rights and refer them to it at the
appropriate places. Article IV (unreasonable search and seizure) is
most appropriate. You might also notice I, V, VIII, IX, X.
16. The laws forbidding the giving of false information do not
mean that you have to cooperate with the government. Remember the
boy who came to the question "Sex?" and wrote "very seldom." This
was true, even if it was not what the questionnaire was trying to find
out.
17. Attach the papers of your tax return in random order. This
leads to much hunting and searching. Also put one backwards or
upside down.
18. If you want to "forget" anything, I recommend forgetting to
sign the check, if you have to pay.
19. Take all your information, in a shoe box, down to the IRS
office and tell them that you need help in preparing your return. They
are required to help taxpayers. I especially urge doing this during the
2nd week in April, but if you don't like to wait in line, go earlier. Do
NOT take their word for what you owe them, however. Check it, or
have an accountant check it. They will make mistakes in the
goven.ment's favor.
20. When in doubt about a deduction, claim it; let them prove
you're not entitled to it, if they check.
21. Send your tax return to some other IRS Center than the one
for your area. If you live in California, you might consider sending it
to the Amherst, Mass. center.
22. Be sure that all pages of your return are well fastened together.
After all, you don't want them losing part of it. If you use staples,
staple at least 3 sides. Better yet, use glue, or safetypins.
23. You've been wondering what to do with all that aftershave
lotion you got for Christmas? Well, you might spill a little on the tax
return. It may smudge a little. It may stink a lot. n
24. Transpose numerals in your Social Security number. Thik
keeps them from locating last year's file as fast.
25. Call up the IRS offices, and ?sk them for some uncommon
form; it isn't your fault if it late; turns out that you don't need it.
Good ones to ask for are Schedule G, Income Averaging, or Form
1040 ES, Declaration of Estimated Tax, or Form 2333, Request for
Forms.
26. File a Declaration of Estimated Tax for 4c. You will have to
pay this in four installments: April 15, June 15, September 15, and
January 15. After all, you might have income that's not on your W-2
next year; you knows?
27. Cross out some of the lines on the tax return, and write in
your own names for them.

Behold, Spring is around the corner, and the Income Tax form is
littering the countryside.
If, however, you still have that aching feeling in your pocketbook
from last year, and if you are nursing a deep grudge in your heart, let
me explain to you some of the ways in which you can, quite legally,
inflict your revenge upon the collectors of eternal revenue, at
absolutely no risk to yourself. I do not expect you to try to do all
these things; indeed, some of them are mutually exclusive. All of them
are guaranteed to cause the infernal revenue service no little
annoyance.
1. Write them letters to ask them questions. These can be serious
questions or frivolous questions, such as "Can I deduct my dog's vet
bills?" (Answer, NO!) But they will have to reply, since they are civil
servants, and this will use time that otherwise could be spent harassing
some poor taxpayer.
2. Usually it takes them 10 to 20 days to answer a letter so after 7
or 8 days, send them a follow-up. (Better yet start off with a
follow-up with out bothering to send the original!) Here, in case
you're interested, is a general purpose follow up letter that I use:
"Dear Madam or Sir, as the case may be: On or about—l sent you—.
As I have yet received no reply, I am concerned that my letter, or
your answer to it, may have become lost in the mail. Did you receive it?
-YES -NO
If so, what do you intend to do about it?
If not, I will .
I enclose a (stamped) self-addressed envelope for your reply.
Please excuse this form letter. It is a necessary way of saving time
and expense."

undertaker, for example write "planter" or "last resort".
9. Use your children's nicknames every other year: Bud, Sissie.
10. Enter the written figures on the wrong line. For example, if
you have farm income put it on line 37 or 38 instead of 39.
11. Attach to your tax return a copy of some irrelevant matter,
such as a letter your Aunt Minnie sent you about her arthritis. This is
particularly helpful if you are claiming sick pay on form 2440.
12. By all means fill out and attach Form 4130 for the gasoline
you used in yourlawnmower. This gives you a small refund of gas tax.
13. If you end up having to pay additional tax, do not pay all of it
at once. Pay part of it and let the government bill you for the rest.
They will, of course, charge you interest, but where else can you
borrow money at 6 percent simple interest these days?
14. Do NOT write in your return address on the envelope. If you
want to cause some extra bother, put a lc stamp on the envelope and
let the IRS and the USPOD argue over the postage due.
15. Attach a copy of the Bill of Rights and refer them to it at the
appropriate places. Article IV (unreasonable search and seizure) is
most appropriate. You might also notice I, V, VIII, IX, X.
16. The laws forbidding the giving of false information do not
mean that you have to cooperate with the government. Remember the
boy who came to the question "Sex?" and wrote "very seldom." This
was true, even if it was not what the questionnaire was trying to find
out.
17. Attach the papers of your tax return in random order. This
leads to much hunting and searching. Also put one backwards or
upside down.
18. If you want to "forget" anything, I recommend forgetting to
sign the check, if you have to pay.
19. Take all your information, in a shoe box, down to the IRS
office and tell them that you need help in preparing your return. They
are required to help taxpayers. I especially urge doing this during the
2nd week in April, but if you don't like to wait in line, go earlier. Do
NOT take their word for what you owe them, however. Check it, or
have an accountant check it. They will make mistakes in the
goven.ment's favor.
20. When in doubt about a deduction, claim it; let them prove
you're not entitled to it, if they check.
21. Send your tax return to some other IRS Center than the one
for your area. If you live in California, you might consider sending it
to the Amherst, Mass. center.
22. Be sure that all pages of your return are well fastened together.
After all, you don't want them losing part of it. If you use staples,
staple at least 3 sides. Better yet, use glue, or safetypins.
23. You've been wondering what to do with all that aftershave
lotion you got for Christmas? Well, you might spill a little on the tax
return. It may smudge a little. It may stink a lot. n
24. Transpose numerals in your Social Security number. Thik
keeps them from locating last year's file as fast.
25. Call up the IRS offices, and ?sk them for some uncommon
form; it isn't your fault if it late; turns out that you don't need it.
Good ones to ask for are Schedule G, Income Averaging, or Form
1040 ES, Declaration of Estimated Tax, or Form 2333, Request for
Forms.
26. File a Declaration of Estimated Tax for 4c. You will have to
pay this in four installments: April 15, June 15, September 15, and
January 15. After all, you might have income that's not on your W-2
next year; you knows?
27. Cross out some of the lines on the tax return, and write in
your own names for them.

Behold, Spring is around the corner, and the Income Tax form is
littering the countryside.
If, however, you still have that aching feeling in your pocketbook
from last year, and if you are nursing a deep grudge in your heart, let
me explain to you some of the ways in which you can, quite legally,
inflict your revenge upon the collectors of eternal revenue, at
absolutely no risk to yourself. I do not expect you to try to do all
these things; indeed, some of them are mutually exclusive. All of them
are guaranteed to cause the infernal revenue service no little
annoyance.
1. Write them letters to ask them questions. These can be serious
questions or frivolous questions, such as "Can I deduct my dog's vet
bills?" (Answer, NO!) But they will have to reply, since they are civil
servants, and this will use time that otherwise could be spent harassing
some poor taxpayer.
2. Usually it takes them 10 to 20 days to answer a letter so after 7
or 8 days, send them a follow-up. (Better yet start off with a
follow-up with out bothering to send the original!) Here, in case
you're interested, is a general purpose follow up letter that I use:
"Dear Madam or Sir, as the case may be: On or about—l sent you—.
As I have yet received no reply, I am concerned that my letter, or
your answer to it, may have become lost in the mail. Did you receive it?
-YES -NO
If so, what do you intend to do about it?
If not, I will .
I enclose a (stamped) self-addressed envelope for your reply.
Please excuse this form letter. It is a necessary way of saving time
and expense."
This usually gets results, as they hate for you to send them a form
letter. If not, keep sending them, with carbons to your senator, etc.
3. Last year the Martinsburg Monster detected 5 million arithmetic
errors on tax returns, of which 2 million were in the government's
favor. Each of the 5 million returns requires extra processing, often by
hand. An error of even 10c costs the government just as much as an
error of $10.00. Notice also, that by the law of averages, at least half
the errors should have been in the government's favor. Someone is
letting his dislike of paying taxes influence his arithmetic.

4. If you are going to make an error in arithmetic, it is safer to
make it in the government's favor. Then you can file an Amended
Return and apply for a refund. An Amended Return is just like the
original return, except that you write the words "Amended Return"
in large letters at the top of the page and correct the error. This causes
the government to process your return twice. Please do not be
dissuaded by any feeling of compassion for the clerical employees of
the IRS. Remember that according to the Talmud, tax gatherers are
classed with burglars and bandits.
5. Do NOT use the preprinted form that the Government supplies;
it is for their convenience, not yours, use a blank form.
6. Change the way that you write your name from year to year; if
you used John H. Reb last year, use Johnny Reb or J. Hugh Reb or
J.H. Reb.
7. Do not write the social security number in the space provided.
Instead, write, "See W-2, attached" or words to that effect. Likewise,
put all possible information on separate sheets of paper and write "see
attached".
8. Change your occupation from year to year. If you are an
undertaker, for example write "planter" or "last resort".
9. Use your children's nicknames every other year: Bud, Sissie.
10. Enter the written figures on the wrong line. For example, if

upside down.
18. If you want to "forget" anything, I recommend forgetting to
sign the check, if you have to pay.
19. Take all your information, in a shoe box, down to the IRS
office and tell them that you need help in preparing your return. They
are required to help taxpayers. I especially urge doing this during the
2nd week in April, but if you don't like to wait in line, go earlier. Do
NOT take their word for what you owe them, however. Check it, or
have an accountant check it. They will make mistakes in the
goven.ment's favor.
20. When in doubt about a deduction, claim it; let them prove
you're not entitled to it, if they check.
21. Send your tax return to some other IRS Center than the one
for your area. If you live in California, you might consider sending it
to the Amherst, Mass. center.
22. Be sure that all pages of your return are well fastened together.
After all, you don't want them losing part of it. If you use staples,
staple at least 3 sides. Better yet, use glue, or safetypins.
23. You've been wondering what to do with all that aftershave
lotion you got for Christmas? Well, you might spill a little on the tax
return. It may smudge a little. It may stink a lot. n
24. Transpose numerals in your Social Security number. Thik
keeps them from locating last year's file as fast.
25. Call up the IRS offices, and ?sk them for some uncommon
form; it isn't your fault if it late; turns out that you don't need it.
Good ones to ask for are Schedule G, Income Averaging, or Form
1040 ES, Declaration of Estimated Tax, or Form 2333, Request for
Forms.
26. File a Declaration of Estimated Tax for 4c. You will have to
pay this in four installments: April 15, June 15, September 15, and
January 15. After all, you might have income that's not on your W-2
next year; you knows?
27. Cross out some of the lines on the tax return, and write in
your own names for them.
