## Awright, Youse Guys...

The sun shone brightly on White Plaza the day
that the Mafia recruiter came to the Placement
Center.
Michael Santini (8.A., Princeton '55) was
detained for a short time at the doors by
demonstrators from S.R.M. They demanded an
account of all business that Santini's Organization
conducts with the Department of Defense.
"None. None at all," replied Santini reassuringly.
"We really have almost no dealings with the
government. We're afraid of it."
The demonstrators smiled and nodded to one
another. It seemed that Santini had won them over.
Then he made a mistake. "The CIA opium farms in
Laos do supply us with some raw materials," he
admitted.
At the mention of the CIA, the crowd turned
ugly. Santini's assurance that "most of the stuff
comes from Turkey," did nothing to quiet them.
"Should we take you through. Boss?" asked
Nicki Bruno, one of Santini's menacing bodyguards.
"No rough stuff, boys. We're legit now," replied
the recruiter. He turned to Lt. Don Tamm of the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office. After a short
conversation, Tamm was seen to say a few words
into his walkie-talkie.
"Ironic, isn't it?" chuckled Santini to himself as
he hustled through the doors in the midst of a flying
wedge of deputies.
The receptionist greeted Mr. Santini courteously.
She informed him that the Center Policy Board had
read his firm's brochure and had found violations of

Placement Center Recruiting Guidelines. "Oh, oh,"
thought Santini, "I knew this racket looked too
good to be true."
"It's this passage about preferring recruits of
Sicilian descent, Mr. Santini. That is a violation of
the civil rights laws," she explained.
Santini was so shocked that he forgot himself.
"You mean that's all you object to?" he asked
incredulously. "It doesn't matter that we engage in
extortion, arson, murder, illicit drug traffic and
prostitution?"
"Why no, Mr. Santini!" the receptionist
answered sweetly. "The Department of Defense and
lots of other organizations who recruit here every
week deal quite openly in all those lines of
endeavor."
"Well," said Santini, somewhat recovering his
composure, "that's an oid brochure. We're just
looking for boys with talent these days. It don't
matter what their background is."
But nonetheless, Santini never conducted an
interview. For just then Marv Herrington, the only
FBI agent in the nation who is not assigned to
chasing down revolutionaries, burst into the
Placement Center and placed Santini under arrest.
"The audacity of you guys!" remarked
Herrington as he led the frustrated interviewer
away. "Imagine thinking that criminal organizations
can recruit on the University campus!"
"You don't understand," Santini protested. "The
dame inside told me they do it all the time."

chasing down revolutionaries, burst into the
Placement Center and placed Santini under arrest.
"The audacity of you guys!" remarked
Herrington as he led the frustrated interviewer
away. "Imagine thinking that criminal organizations
can recruit on the University campus!"
"You don't understand," Santini protested. "The
dame inside told me they do it all the time."

The sun shone brightly on White Plaza the day
that the Mafia recruiter came to the Placement
Center.
Michael Santini (8.A., Princeton '55) was
detained for a short time at the doors by
demonstrators from S.R.M. They demanded an
account of all business that Santini's Organization
conducts with the Department of Defense.
"None. None at all," replied Santini reassuringly.
"We really have almost no dealings with the
government. We're afraid of it."
The demonstrators smiled and nodded to one
another. It seemed that Santini had won them over.
Then he made a mistake. "The CIA opium farms in
Laos do supply us with some raw materials," he
admitted.
At the mention of the CIA, the crowd turned
ugly. Santini's assurance that "most of the stuff
comes from Turkey," did nothing to quiet them.
"Should we take you through. Boss?" asked
Nicki Bruno, one of Santini's menacing bodyguards.
"No rough stuff, boys. We're legit now," replied
the recruiter. He turned to Lt. Don Tamm of the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office. After a short
conversation, Tamm was seen to say a few words
into his walkie-talkie.
"Ironic, isn't it?" chuckled Santini to himself as
he hustled through the doors in the midst of a flying
wedge of deputies.
The receptionist greeted Mr. Santini courteously.
She informed him that the Center Policy Board had
read his firm's brochure and had found violations of

Placement Center Recruiting Guidelines. "Oh, oh,"
thought Santini, "I knew this racket looked too
good to be true."
"It's this passage about preferring recruits of
Sicilian descent, Mr. Santini. That is a violation of
the civil rights laws," she explained.
Santini was so shocked that he forgot himself.
"You mean that's all you object to?" he asked
incredulously. "It doesn't matter that we engage in
extortion, arson, murder, illicit drug traffic and
prostitution?"
"Why no, Mr. Santini!" the receptionist
answered sweetly. "The Department of Defense and
lots of other organizations who recruit here every
week deal quite openly in all those lines of
endeavor."
"Well," said Santini, somewhat recovering his
composure, "that's an oid brochure. We're just
looking for boys with talent these days. It don't
matter what their background is."
But nonetheless, Santini never conducted an
interview. For just then Marv Herrington, the only
FBI agent in the nation who is not assigned to
chasing down revolutionaries, burst into the
Placement Center and placed Santini under arrest.
"The audacity of you guys!" remarked
Herrington as he led the frustrated interviewer
away. "Imagine thinking that criminal organizations
can recruit on the University campus!"
"You don't understand," Santini protested. "The
