I What can we say to get
you to listen to The
j Mahamhnu Orchestra?
How about John Mclaughlin, Billy Cobham, and Jerry
Goodman, for starters? Three of the finest names in jazz, now
making music beyond jazz.
How about Jimi Hendrix, Buddy Miles, Eric Clapton? Three of
the finest names in rock, all of whom have played with John
McLaughlin.
How about John Broholm and Paul Wells, two of KZSU's
heaviest programmers — both of whom were more than blown
out by the Mahavishno's Orchestra's Winterland appearance last
weekend.
I And how about the fact that we at the Record Store are so
impressed by John McLaughlin's Mahavishno Orchestra that
we've put the album on sale this weekend - just to get you to
listen.
