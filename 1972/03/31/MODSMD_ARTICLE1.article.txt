# Good Friday Reflections: Jesus Then And Now
## 
### MARK WEAVER 
A ragged man recently walked into
a New England church and presented
its reverend with $9,000 in cash,
saying, "This is from Jesus." The
police, however, did not believe him
and the generous soul has been under
surveillance since.
Stanford student Cris Stevens is so
confident of Jesus' existence that she
finds, "If I just open myself and let
Him shine through I won't be too
sinful, inconsiderate of other people."
These examples are representative
of the continuing significance Jesus
holds for many people. They embrace
a question debated among Christians
and non-Christians alike: What was
Jesus all about?
Father Duryea of the Catholic
Newman Center has "no doubt" that a
man called Jesus lived some 1,972
years ago. In fact, "The evidence for
His existence is a great deal stronger

than that for Julius Caesar," he said.
Most religious authorities agree.
The meaning of His existence is
what stirs the great debate. Rabbi
Familant of the Hillel Foundation
gives the Bible a purely literary
interpretation. "The narrator was
attempting to get across a moral," he
asserts. "To bring a miracle into the
moral was a way of showing God."
The people who came after Jesus, he
continues, wrote many of the miracles
into the Bible as "a fairly obvious
attempt to give a divine status to
Him." The Rabbi adds that many
people needed to believe in Jesus at
the time because of all the suffering.
"His death challenged that belief. One
had to realize it was just human to
rationalize His death, which is what
they did."
Supernatural Events
David Roper, director of Seminar
'70, who describes himself as "sort of

the nominal Jesus freak on campus"
and a "biblical literalist," holds the
opposite view. "Our source for under
standing Jesus is the Bible," he says."I
think the Gospels are eyewitness
accounts. Too many disbelieve because
of something that precludes the
existence of supernatural events."
Roper believes that Jesus was human
but also God and that the miracles
were proofs of the power of God
within Him.
The issue, Religion Professor
Robert Brown insists, is that a group
of people came into existence who
believed that Jesus had not been held
captive by death. "You can't prove he
rose from the dead but for Christianity
to start £ ne people had to believe he
did."
Violent Jesus
The debate over the meaning and
existence of a "Jesus" aside, the
historical character Jesus was, accord

ing to Roper, "unique—there has been
no one like him before or since."
Roper characterizes Him as having
"strength under control. He was
compassionate, non-judgemental of
those who were weak."
The only time He became violent
was when He encountered the money
changers in the temple. (In biblical
times the collection of interest on
amounts of money was considered
immoral.) Jesus saw this being done to
exploit others. In His indignation He
tipped over their tables and demanded
that they leave.
"At times He exhibited violence,"
says Roper. "I don't think that's
contradictory to His teaching to turn
the other cheek" to someone who has
just slapped you in the face. "That was
when oneself was being hurt. In the
temple with the money changers,
other's rights were at stake so He
fought back."

He was "in many ways an enigmatic
man," explains Roper. He wanted
people to think through the truth for
themselves—that's why he spoke in
parables. He made it hard to leam so
he could see who wanted to learn and
who did not, says Roper, "which I
think was a good teaching device."
Mysterious Shroud
"He spoke with authority, with
conviction and no apology for what he
was saying," adds Duryea. "He was a
simple direct, honest man. For the
most part He was very gentle." He had
human emotions. He felt the anguish
of his pending death and when Lazarus
died he wept. "We know nothing of
His physical appearance," adds
Duryea, "although a white shroud
with blood stains was found in Italy in
the 19th century and dated back to
biblical times. A photograph was taken
of it and the negative revealed the
outline of a face with typically
Hebrew features. Whether this is true I
don't know."
Brown says that Jesus' "dominating
characteristic is love. Sometimes it is
tender. Sometimes it has to be
expressed with stemess. The whole
impact of Jesus," continues Brown, "is
that He calls into question our
ordinary perceptions — that people
shouldn't go hungry. Love your
enemies."
"I think He was a man very much
concerned with the underdog," says
Rabbi Familant. He was interested in
"taking idolatry out of money and
being more concerned with the spirit
of the law than letter of the law."
Familant explains Jesus' disgust with
people who followed the rituals and
thought they were religious. "Jesus
thought religion should provide a
moral conscience."
Quiet Confidence
At times He seemed to be very
vocal, He could be easily outraged by
hypocrisy. At other times He could be
very soft spoken and humble (as when
He washed the feet of the prostitute).
Familant portrays Jesus as an Abra
ham Lincoln in His speech. "He had a
gift for pithy statements, crystallizing
ideas in very few words. Apparently
He was very perceptive, He could see
through the confusion of an event or
person and epitomize it in a terse
fashion." The Rabbi pictures Jesus as

having a "tremendous amount of
determination and inner strength, one
who didn't feel it necessary to shout
His beliefs in the street. He strode
through life with a quiet confidence.
His confidence inspired people He
came in contact with."
Jesus did not like the way the
scribes and pharisees were interpreting
the laws and the political and religious
authorities had Him killed when He
began to attract a following. "It would
be like Governor Reagan and Bishop
Meyer getting together and crucifying
someone," says Irish. "He challenged
the establishment pe pie like you and
me who are living comfortably .. ."

Were He alive today Jesus "would
be threatening the established order,"
hypothesizes Irish. Jesus challenger
you to act in the way you interpret
your life before God. If you went up
to Him and asked "Should I sit in at
the Placement Center?" he'd probably
say "Render unto the economy . .
They'd Kill Him
Roper does not think Jesus would
take any political positions today
because He did not then. "He even
counseled people to pay their taxes.
Jesus' concern was not to change
government but men. The problem
was not the political system but
people, almost any system would work
with better men."
Roper conjectures that "if Jesus
came to this campus, you wouldn't be
able to distinguish Him from others.
He's get a small gathering of followers.
I think the hostility would be just as
great as it was then. They'd kill Him

because men are not willing to face the
light. They cannot stand to see their
lives, pride, and self-centeredness ex
posed." Roper adds that it would most
likely be hy assassination since the
political system probably could not be
brought to do it.
Jesus, according to Roper, would
try to teach us love and concern for
other people. When Jesus said 'Love

your neighbor' someone asked Him
'Who is my neighbor?' and He replied
that he is the next person you meet
who has a need, be it physical,
emotional, or spiritual. "Love for God
would be expressed in showing love
for iuiother person," says Roper. You
just have to be receptive to His
teachings.
"Jesus didn't think in terms of
government but He didn't denounce

it,"says Duryea. "He would denounce
the hypocrisy of Nixon's recent call
for a national day of prayer for peace"
at the same time his bombs were
raining on Asians.
Jesus As Revolutionary
Brown asserts that Jesus "forces
you to examine what you're doing to
promote love. For 2000 years people
have been invoking Jesus to justify
their cause whether it is bombing
humans or feeding the poor. I think
He is revolutionary in the sense of
seeing the need for radical change in
the world .. . He's against things
which are against human personhood."
On a more personal level Stanford
student Cris Stevens speaks not only
of "doing good" but of the personal
strength her belief in Jesus gives her:
"A friend of mine is really a beautiful
person. She does things for others but
I'm afraid she'll get burned by
someone someday and withhold her
giving spirit whereas if one had Jesus
there would be a never ending source
of love." She concedes "I still don't
have enough faith in the Lord.
Sometimes I'm afraid to tell people
I'm a Christian because they'll sit you
down and go through the whole spiel.
It's like a trial, asking how can you
rationally believe this."
Another Stanford student, a sopho
more who is uncertain in his belief in
Jesus says,"He could have been a fake
or he could have been the Son of
God." Nevertheless He's "Somebody
whose lifestyle, whose trust and love,
His peace, His simplicity in life, His
concern for humanity is something I
want to model myself after."
