# Earth Sciences Field Advancing Rapidly
## 
### CARL SUNSHINE 
The field of earth sciences is
undergoing a scientific
"revolution" perhaps as
significant as Relativity was to
physics, and Stanford is at the
head of it.
Quietly over the past decade
the new theory of "plate
tectonics" has emerged from

geophysicists all over the world.
Reflecting new interest and
advances in the field, Stanford's
geophysics department offered a
new course this quarter,
Geophysics 51, to present the
theory at an undergraduate level.
Taught jointly by Professor
George Thompson, chairman of
the geophysics department, and
Allan Cox, Professor of
Geophysics, the course is aimed at
students with varied interests in
the sciences who want to know
more about the Earth on a
planetary scale.
Atlantis?
Was there really a lost
continent of Atlantis? Are Eurasia
and America pieces of one giant
land mass that shattered and
drifted apart? Such theories, once
dismissed as fairytales, or at best
curious possibilities, are placed on
firmer scientific ground by the
theory discussed in the course.
According to plate tectonics,
the Earth's surface consists of
huge rigid plates of crustal
material. The plates slide against
or under each other, or flow away
from each other at ridges where
new material comes to the
surface. Nearly all geological
activity occurs along the
boundaries of the plates.
The San Andreas Fault is one

such boundary where a plate
containing the Eastern Pacific
Ocean floor moves to the
northwest relative to the North
American plate. The San Andreas
is a boundary where the plates
simply slide past each other. On
the north side of the Pacific along
the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, the
Pacific palte is disappearing under
the plate containing Alaska.
Understandably, tremendous
forces build up where these plates
of crust thousands of miles long
and 20-50 miles thick rub against
each other. Nearly all the world's
earthquakes and volcanos occur in
these areas. The great Alaska
quake resulted from tensions
where the Pacific plate descended
under Alaska.
Magnetic Fields
The most important support
for this theory of plate motions
has come in Cox's field of Earth
magnetism. In his pioneering work
at the US Geological Survey
before coming to teach at
Stanford, Cox showed that the
Earth's magnetic field has not
always pointed the same way as it
does today. Many rocks have the
Earth's magnetic field "locked in"
at the time they are formed.
By carefully analyzing rocks
whose ages were independently
determined, Cox and coworkers

constructed a "history" of the
Earth's magnetic field for the past
several million years.
This history shows that the
field is constantly fluctuating in
magnitude and direction by small
amounts, and several times in the
past million years it was
completely reversed from the
present direction.
When an instrument that can
detect the magnetism locked into
rocks is towed over one of the
undersea ridges where two plates
are spreading apart, a distinct
pattern ot magnetism is observed.
The rock nearest the center of
spreading shows magnetism just
like the present field, and rock
further out shows magnetism
reflecting the magnetic history
established from other rocks.
In fact, a similar pattern of
magnetism can be found for
hundreds of kilometers across
many ridges and reflects tens of
millions of years of history.
This consistency of the pattern
of "magnetic anomalies" lends
strong support to the theory that
the rigid plates are indeed
spreading apart as new material is
added at these ridges.
Current research by Cox and
his graduate students focuses on
filling in more details of the
known magnetic history, and

pushing it back farther by
studying and comparing the
magnetic anomaly patterns from
all over the world. Cox himself
has travelled to New Zealand,
Antarctica, and the Galapogos
Islands, to name but a few of the
more exotic spots, in the course
of collecting rock samples.
One of his students, Charles
Denham, is currently collecting
samples at Lake Mono and Lake
Tahoe in the Sierras to determine
the detailed recent magnetic
history of the area.
Cox sees the possibility of both
outdoor field work and academic
work as one advantage in the
field. Travel is a frequent
possibility. After all, "there are
rocks everywhere" commented
Denham.
Not only magnetism, but also
earthquakes, volcanoes, and
mountain building have their
place in the plate tectonics
theory. Volcanos occur where one
plate descends under another and
disturbs the molten material
beneath the crust (in the Andes,
Japan, the Aleutians).
The cumulative pattern of
earthquakes all over the Earth
shows striking localization to the
proposed boundaries between
plates. A few occur in the middle

The field of earth sciences is

"revolution" perhaps as
significant as Relativity was to

Quietly over the past decade
the new theory of "plate
tectonics" has emerged from

geophysicists all over the world.
Reflecting new interest and
advances in the field, Stanford's
geophysics department offered a
new course this quarter,
Geophysics 51, to present the
theory at an undergraduate level.

George Thompson, chairman of
the geophysics department, and
Allan Cox, Professor of
Geophysics, the course is aimed at
students with varied interests in
the sciences who want to know
more about the Earth on a
planetary scale.
Atlantis?
Was there really a lost
continent of Atlantis? Are Eurasia
and America pieces of one giant
land mass that shattered and
drifted apart? Such theories, once
dismissed as fairytales, or at best
curious possibilities, are placed on
firmer scientific ground by the
theory discussed in the course.
According to plate tectonics,
the Earth's surface consists of
huge rigid plates of crustal
material. The plates slide against
or under each other, or flow away
from each other at ridges where
new material comes to the
surface. Nearly all geological
activity occurs along the
boundaries of the plates.
The San Andreas Fault is one

such boundary where a plate
containing the Eastern Pacific
Ocean floor moves to the
northwest relative to the North
American plate. The San Andreas
is a boundary where the plates
simply slide past each other. On
the north side of the Pacific along
the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, the
Pacific palte is disappearing under
the plate containing Alaska.
Understandably, tremendous
forces build up where these plates
of crust thousands of miles long
and 20-50 miles thick rub against
each other. Nearly all the world's
earthquakes and volcanos occur in
these areas. The great Alaska
quake resulted from tensions
where the Pacific plate descended
under Alaska.
Magnetic Fields
The most important support
for this theory of plate motions
has come in Cox's field of Earth
magnetism. In his pioneering work
at the US Geological Survey
before coming to teach at
Stanford, Cox showed that the
Earth's magnetic field has not
always pointed the same way as it
does today. Many rocks have the
Earth's magnetic field "locked in"
at the time they are formed.
By carefully analyzing rocks
whose ages were independently
determined, Cox and coworkers

constructed a "history" of the
Earth's magnetic field for the past
several million years.
This history shows that the
field is constantly fluctuating in
magnitude and direction by small
amounts, and several times in the
past million years it was
completely reversed from the
present direction.
When an instrument that can
detect the magnetism locked into
rocks is towed over one of the
undersea ridges where two plates
are spreading apart, a distinct
pattern ot magnetism is observed.
The rock nearest the center of
spreading shows magnetism just
like the present field, and rock
further out shows magnetism
reflecting the magnetic history
established from other rocks.
In fact, a similar pattern of
magnetism can be found for
hundreds of kilometers across
many ridges and reflects tens of
millions of years of history.
This consistency of the pattern
of "magnetic anomalies" lends
strong support to the theory that
the rigid plates are indeed
spreading apart as new material is
added at these ridges.
Current research by Cox and
his graduate students focuses on
filling in more details of the
known magnetic history, and

pushing it back farther by
studying and comparing the
magnetic anomaly patterns from
all over the world. Cox himself
has travelled to New Zealand,
Antarctica, and the Galapogos
Islands, to name but a few of the
more exotic spots, in the course
