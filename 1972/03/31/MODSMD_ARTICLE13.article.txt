of plates that are being stretched
apart (in Nevada) or squeezed (in
the Himalayas). Thus the theory is
"a good framework to hang
everything together" according to
Lee Bell, graduate student in
geophysics and TA for the course.
Earthquakes
Research in geophysics in
general and particularly
earthquakes has been spurred by
recent government funding. 15
years ago the US government
spent 50 million dollars to
support research in seismology so
underground nuclear blasts could
be told from normal earthquakes.
Scientists solved the technology
problem within a few years, but
the politicians have yet to work
out a treaty, observed Cox.
Similar frustrations in the area
of earthquake damage prevention
confront geophysicists. According
to Cox, simply avoiding building
in known danger areas is far more
important than any early warning
system of an imminent quake
might be if developed.
Scientists with understanding
of the hazards "have some
responsibility to keep warning
people" said Cox, but frequently
such warnings are disregarded.
After the Alaska quake people
rebuilt in many of the same high
danger areas they had been
warned of even before the quake.
Nevertheless, a lot of
government money is supporting
earthquake research. The recent
San Fernando quake, although
only 1/800 th the intensity of the
1906 San Francisco quake, still
did one-half billion dollars in
damage. "You can buy an awful
lot of research for one percent of
the damages," said Cox, and
apparently this is the philosophy
behind some government funding.
Although receiving government
support from the National Science
Foundation and other non
military agencies, geophysics does
not attract much military interest
or funding in research. The only
defense connection that Cox
could bring to mind aside from
nuclear test detection, is
submarine warfare. Apparently
devices similar to those developed
to measure rock magnetism
beneath the ocean, are used to
detect the magnetic anomalies due
to metallic s u b m ari nes
underwater.
Another aspect of the new
interest in geophysics is better
than average job opportunities.
With new oil supplies increasingly
difficult to find, the petroleum
industry relies heavily on
geophysicists to locate possible
offshore and underground
deposits. Although Cox things

.tJdents can "maintain
self-respect if they do go into
industry," neither Denham or Bell
were anxious to pursue such a
course.
For the many students who
prefer to continue in an academic
career, departments all over the
country' are expanding to take
more students and offer more
courses. At Stanford, faculty and
student numbers have nearly
tripled in the last five years and
there are still more well qualified
applicants than support funds
available according to Thompson.
With government, industry,
and academics all climbing on the
bandwagon, geophysics students
feel more optimistic about jobs
than their fellows in other
sciences. "Job opportunities in
general are great," according to
Bell. How long the boom will last
is hard to say, but the theory of
plate tectonics that Stanford
scientists have helped develop has
many stories yet to rise above its
firm new foundations.
