# Electronics Profs Elected Fellows
## 
### 
Three Stai.ford faculty
members have received the unique
honor of being elected Fellows of
the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers. This
distinction is the highest grade of
membership lEEE can bestow and
is awarded by the Institute's
Board of Directors only in
recognition of the highest
professional and technical
achievement.
The three are: Frederick W.
Crawford, Plasma Research, who
was cited for Contribution to the
Understanding of Wave and
Instability Phenomena in Plasmas;
James F. Gibbons, Electronics,
who was cited for Contributions
to Solid State Electronics and
Engineering Education; and
Stephen E. Harris, Microwaves,
who was cited for Contributions
in Lasers, Non-linear Optics,
Optical Parametric Devices and
Acousto optics.
Election of new Fellows occurs
only once a year and the formal
presentation of the honor is made
at lEEE's annual banquet at its
convention in New York in March
of each year.
Frederick W. Crawford
Dr. Crawford is a professor in
the Department of Electrical
Engineering at Stanford. He
obtained a London University
B.Sc. (Eng.) degree with First
Class Honors in Electrical
Engineering in 1952 and a B.Sc.
(Math.) degree in 1954. From
Liverpool University he obtained
a Ph.D. in 1955, for work on
decaying arc discharges, and a

Diploma In Education In 1956.
Crawford then worked in the
research department of Great
Britain's National Coal Board
during 1956-57, and for two years
as a Senior Lecturer in Electrical
Engineering at the College of
Advanced Technology,
Birmingham (now the University
of Aston) before coming to
Stanford in December 1959.
He received the London
University M.Sc. (Math.) degree in
1958 in thermodynamics and
hydrodynamics. During 1961-62,
he spent a year as a visiting
scientist in the Plasma Physics
Group of the French A EC at
Saclay, France, and as consultant
to CFTH.
Dr. Crawford has had a
continuing interest in many
branches of discharge physics
since 1951, and was awarded the
Doctor of Engineering (D. Eng.)
degree of Liverpool University in
1965 for his publications in this
area. His early work was on arc
discharges and their reign ition,
breakdown, and glow discharges.
At Stanford, he has worked in
the areas of small signal and
nonlinear plasma wave
propagation, beam-plasma
interactions, diagnostic
techniques, echoes, and the
laboratory simulation of space
plasma phenomena, including
Alouette resonances and whistler
propagation.
He is author, or co-author of
well over 100 publications on
plasma physics. At the present
time, he directs the research work

of a group of about 12 research
associates and graduate students
in the Stanford University
Institute for Plasma Research.
Jumes F. Gibbons
Dr. Gibbons received the
B.S.E.E. degree from
Northwestern University in 1953,
the Ph.D. degree from Stanford
University in 1956 (NSF
Fellowship), and did postdoctoral
research (Fullbright Fellow) at
Cambridge University in England
in 1956-57.
He joined the Stanford Faculty
in 1957, where he is now
Professor of Electronics. In
1963-64 he was a visiting
Professor (NSF Senior
Post-doctoral Fellow) at the
Technical University of Denmark
and a Fullbright Guest Lecturer at
several European universities.
During the academic year
1970-71, he was a visiting
professor in the Nuclear Physics
Department at Oxford University,
and a Visiting Professor of
Electrical Engineering at the
University of Tokyo for the
summer quarter of the 1971
academic year.
Gibbons was Associate Editor
of the lEEE Transactions on
Electron Devices from 1964 to
1970, and was a member of the
NSF Graduate Fellowship Panel
for this same period. He served on
a Department of Health,
Education and Welfare Task Force
on Higher Education and helped
produce a report entitled "Report
on Higher Education."

Stephen E. Hants
Dr. Harris received the B.S. in
electrical engineering from
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
in 1959, and the M.S. and Ph.D.
degrees in electrical engineering
from Stanford University in 1961
and 1963.
Since 1963, he has been on the
faculty of Stanford University
where he is now a professor of
Electrical Engineering. His
research contributions include the
first demodulation of frequency
modulated light, the invention of
the EM laser, the development of
the first synthesis technique for
birefringent optical networks, the
development of a promising
stabilization technique for high
power lasers, the first observation
of optical parametric
flourescence, the operation of the
first visible cw optical parametric
oscillator, the invention of the
tunable acousto-optic filter, and
the demonstration of the first
electronically tunable laser.
