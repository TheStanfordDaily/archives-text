# A 						Tired 'Applause'
## 
### DOUG ARTHUR 
Had I been stoned, 1 would
have enjoyed Applause much
more. Then the little technical
and artistic inconsistencies would
not have been so blatant. 1 doubt
if anyone expected great drama
from the show even though it won
the Tony Award for the best
musical in 1970. What they came
to see was the best actress in a
musical (1970). Lauren Bacall.
The musical was a rather poor
excuse for her to be onstage in a
flimsy plot. Bacall plays an aging
Broadway actress who becomes
displaced by her understudy, yet
finds True Happiness at the end
with her director-lover.
but then no one attends musicals
for their plots.
Applause seems more decadent
than most musicals in the sense
that it relies primarily upon our
knowledge of the theater and
theater personalities. It
patronizingly considers us
insiders. All the allusions to other
musicals serve only to add some

badly needed excitement.
For instance, when three men
start dancing in the nude, we are
immediately reminded of the play
Oh Calcutta.
At another point in the
performance, Margo, the star,
gives a party and we are supposed
to guess who the celebrities are by
the way they are dressed. The
biggest game of this production
was "let's give a mediocre
performance and see if anyone
knows the difference." But the
games proper were only a minor
element of the show.
Vibrant Choreography
Most exciting for me was Ron
Field's choreography which gives
much needed vitality to the show.
The dance numbers are the most
visually stimulating sections. Two
scenes were especially
noteworthy. One occurs after
Margo's opening night, when she
goes to a gay bar with her
hairdresser. Dancers appear
onstage amid flashing colored
lights as the backdrop — posters
and walls — glides in. The
flamboyant costumes of the gay
people compliment the song, "But
Alive," which Margo and the
"boys" sing. The gestures and
dancing for this number are
indeed alive.
Equally enticing is the dancers'
number in a local cafe where they
demonstrate the glittering,
illogical nature of their vocation.
They pile the cafe tables together
and the set of the bar becomes a
stage upon which the dancers
parody other musicals, and
burlesque the sensationalism of
Broadway shows.
Disappointing Second Act
There are seventeen songs in
the show, and the disparity in
quality is astounding. Perhaps the
best song is Bacall's "Welcome to
the Theatre" which is interrupted
by a breakup scene with her lover.
Of all the songs its relation to the
action is the most direct, and
Bacall gives it some effort
(unfortunately, this was an
anomaly). Then there are
mindless songs, like "Fasten Your
Seat Belts" which is saved
(incredible as this sounds) only by
flashy costumes.
To be sure, the costumes are
the most consistently excellent
factor in the show. Ray Aghayan's
costumes on their own redeem
many of the scenes. Of primary
interest are Bacall's gowns and
suits. It's no wonder that her
name finds itself on the world's

ten best dressed women list.
The dialogue by Betty Comden
and Adolph Green holds interest
and rarely falls into
sentimentality. However, many of
Bacall's lines are not as clever as
they could be. About half the
songs could have been cut with no
damage to the show.
The direction of the first act is
very competent. The scenes
integrate with the acting, singing
and dancing, and the show moves
quickly. The pacing keeps the
stage busy and the technical
expertise in unobtrusively shifting
scenes is breathtaking.
I don't know what happened
backstage during intermission, but
the second act falters miserably.
Fortunately it was short. The
actors and dancers go through the
motions, but the result is
embarrassing. Whatever technical
brilliance the first act contains
disappears after intermission.
A Tired Bacall
When a musical has a weak
story line and is burdened with
sensational elements of other
shows, it requires strong acting,
singing and dancing to hold the
thing together. The first act pulled
it off, the second coufdn't.
Applause is one of those shows
that leaves you smiling when you
leave the theatre, yet only when
you are at home (or wherever) do
you realize that you've been taken
by some technical expertise and
little else.
Don Chastain as Bill, the
director and star's lover, irritated
me by his speaking voice which is
a bit too ar-tic-u-late—but at least
I could hear his lines better than
those of Bacall. Lee Roy Reams as
Duane, the star's hairdresser
confidant, does wonders with a
stereotyped role. He brought
some much needed charisma to
the show.
Because I did enjoy Ms. Bacall,
I find it difficult to fault her for
the entire production, but in a
show of this kind, it's
unavoidable. The star of the show
seemed unusually tired in her
performance and was ultimately
disappointing.
Only a few of her songs attain
a level of competence. Many of
her lines were mumbled or lost. I
don't know whether she's been in
the musical too long or finds
playing in the provinces tiring,
but the acting was shockingly
lackluster. It's unfortunate when a
"vehicle" runs over its star, and
Applause did just that.
