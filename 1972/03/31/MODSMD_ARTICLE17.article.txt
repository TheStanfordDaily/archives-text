# Superstar Returns, Success Continues
## 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
Skeptics attribute it to pelvic
action. I call it overwhelming
charisma. I'm talking about
Patrick Jude, who played Judas in
the newest version of Jesus Christ
Superstar at the Orpheum Theater
in San Francisco.
In a generally excellent show,
Jude stole the audience's
attention from all other
performers. Dressed in black and
white, and singing like a
combination lead singer and
musical star, he exuded such
appeal that, from then on,
whenever he had a part to sing,
this reviewer's eyes remained
riveted on him.
Judas' part contained a lot of
pure rock passages, but there are
other parts that require greater
strength and pathos, in which he
proved himself to be equally
skillful.
In the passage where he
decided to betray Jesus, Jude
acted so torn between his love for
Jesus and his ideals that the
audience was clearly moved.
Effective Performers
The title song was for me the
most powerful of the
performance, Judas came out in
modern clothes, and the full band,
orchestra, and chorus followed
him up. His strong, raspy voice
boomed out as he danced around
the stage.
The number drew numerous
groans from women in the
audience. I can well understand
why.
The other performers were just
as good, if not as personally
effective for this reviewer. The
production is billed as "the
original concert presentation."
Actually, the show was an
effective mixture of concert and
staged rock opera. There was not
acting as such, but the singers
moved as they sang and put a lot
of feeling into their songs.
Edie Walker played Mary
Magdalene. She had a voice that
was perfect for the part. It was
rich but not brassy. Her
movements were a little stiff, but,
under the concert atmosphere, it
was easy to overlook that.
Scene-stealing Herod
Her interpretation fit her
appearance. Dressed in white, she
was gentle and feminine
throughout. She did not sing her
major song as straight as it is sung
on the record. Instead she added
some pauses and dynamic
contrasts, and thus did the song
better and with more feeling than
I had ever heard before.
The supporting characters were
also exceptional. The scene-stealer
near the end was Reggie Mack,
who played Herod. He entered
dressed in a gold-sequinned tunic,
a fake bird sitting on his finger.
His subsequent performance
retained his pompous but satirical
appearance.
The scene was like an old
vaudeville act. If the opera were
less serious, he probably would
have been dragged off the stage
with a cane. Mack did an "Egypt
cum Charleston" dance that broke
up the audience. He danced the
old bent kicks and finger waving
moves few people have seen since
Satchmo stopped hamming it up.
Pontius Pilate, played by Jim
Turned, was also excellent. The
music for Pontius Pilate has
always reminded me of Captain
Hook's songs, although
considerably "rocked up." Turner
has a deep and mellow voice that

ably managed the various vocal
acrobatics of the part.
He was a villain in every sense.
Even his hesitancy about sending
Christ to be crucified did not mar
the overall impression that Pilate
was nasty enough to declare his
final, noncommital verdict.
David Ramsey, who played
Caiaphas, acted his evil role well.
Although some of his notes were
so low that he had to growl
incoherently into the mike, he
was good in the higher passages.
One of the best scenes came
when he administered the lashes
to Christ. Ramsey stood on a tall
black rectangular box with a long,
thin whip, and snapped it as the
chorus counted. He convinced us
that he really was enjoying the
torture.
The chorus provided an
excellent background to the leads.
Sometimes, like a Greek chorus, it
was a character in itself. This was
especially true in the Last Supper
scene, where the men playing the
apostles acted as cynically as they
sang.
The band is well known to this
reviewer. Travis Justis really seems
to get around. Hearing them, it is
understandable why. Jack Justis
on lead guitar was amazing in the
solo parts. Peter Fuino was so
good on the saxophone that it was
sometimes hard to keep your
attention on the singers.
David Sansone did all kinds of
acrobatic runs on the piano and
backed up the other players and
performers with snappy rhythms.
The orchestra was a little
shoddy, especially the trumpets.
They were perpetually off-tune.
Luckily, at the end there was a
place where two off-key trumpets
sounded effective, in giving an
eerie mood. The rest of the
orchestra was tolerable, so it was
easy to ignore the horns most of
the time.
Erratic Jesus Role
There was only one bad
performance in the show.
Unfortunately, it was that of the
title character. Robert Corff gave
an erratic performance as Jesus.
Several times he was very good.
Most of the time he was very bad.
His part however was hard to
sing. It requires three different
voice styles: a high falsetto,
capable of performing all kinds of
tricks, a soft, tenor voice, and a
deeper, rich voice. Corff fell short,
especially in the first. His idea of
singing the high parts was to screw
his face up as if he were in
excruciating pain and then to
scream. Granted, he was usually
on pitch, but the quality of the
notes was still painful.
Occasionally, Corff was good.
In his last song, Jesus tells God he
is tired, washed out. Where it was
soft, Corff used a raspy whisper
that, in context, was effective.
When it was louder, he sang in a
beautiful chest tone.
I was wondering how the
ending would come off
effectively. It could have seemed
anticlimactic after the big title
number. But the lighting crew,
which had contented itself until
then with just shining different
colored lights on the players,
bailed the music out.
No strobe lights or typical light
show. You've probably seen what
they did before, but any
description would ruin the
enjoyment you'll get out of it if
you see it, so you'll just have to
see the production for yourself. I
guarantee you'll like it.
