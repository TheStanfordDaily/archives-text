Editor, THE DAILY:
During the past weeks, I have
read with some concern about the
controversy over the American
Indian as the Stanford University
symbol. Many people, objecting
to what they consider a "debasing
racial symbol," have insisted that
the University abandon it
immediately. Those who suggest
that this question be put to a vote
of the Stanford community in a
referendum are usually told that,
since using the Indian as a
"mascot" is a racial slur, the
community has no right to use it,
no matter how many want to, any
more than anyone has the right to
deny Blacks their civil rights, no
matter how large the vote.
But many others do not
consider the Indian issue as
clear-cut as this. Though there
have been those insisting that this
symbol must be abolished in order
to stop the ridiculing of native
Americans, there are others who
just as strongly believe that using
an American Indian as Stanford's
symbol need not contribute to the
oppression of this minority, and
that, furthermore, the symbol can
be a rallying point for a stronger
dedication to the Indians' struggle
for equality.
My purpose in writing this
letter is not to advocate either
viewpoint. What disturbs me in
the rhetoric on both sides, but
particularly from those against the
Indian symbol, is the implication
that the issue is so clear-cut, and
some particular opinion the only
acceptable one, that no other
opinion is morally justified or
worthy of any consideration.
Those who suggest that the nature
tne question is such as to rule
at any community voice in favor
112 keeping the Indian as the
jtanford symbol should keep in

mind that they may be playing
around with a philosophy which
has been the "justification" for
many of the most barbaric
dictatorships in the recorded
history of mankind. By using such
methods , they invite into their
movement people who do not
particularly care about the plight
of the American Indian except as
such "concern" may help them to
accomplish less humanitarian
ends.
I sincerely hope that, before
any decision to adopt a new
University symbol is finalized, the
Stanford community will be given
a chance to express its position on
the matter through a referendum,
in which those voting will have
the option of voting to retain the
Indian if they wish to so vote. To
do otherwise would be to take a
step in a direction that an open
university would want to avoid.

I propose that Stanford adopt
as its mascot the dove. Man has
long chosen symbols in order to
both reflect and disseminate
values. With unfortunate accuracy
these symbols in the past have
consisted largely of predators:
Wildcats, Lions, Yellow Jackets,
Warriors, etc. Given the need for
our society to redefine its value
system along more ecological and
humanitarian lines, the choice of
the dove as a symbol for Stanford
seems appropriate. I plan to place
this recommendation on the
ballot in the spring quarter
election. I also call on the ASSU
Senate to consider this
recommendation.

The Chicanos in the School of
Education Association wish to
state its support of the Native
American Indians at Stanford
asking for elimination of the
Indian as a mascot for the athletic
teams.
Cartoons and editorials in the
local newspapers clearly illustrate
the extent to which the American
Indian is depersonalized and
dismissed by the dominant
society. On February 6, in the San
Francisco Chronicle, cartoonist
Graysmith equates the sensitivities
of human beings with those of
birds. An editorial that day, same
page, says the Native American
Indians should be proud to have
Stanford use the Indian as its
mascot, since Stanford University
beat Michigan in a football game!
That the fun and games of college
students should be meaningful to
the most disfranchised group of
people in this country just doesn't
follow.
The Stanford Bookstore
discontinued using the laughable
Indian caricature in its
merchandise, and good for them.
But, how many desk blotters with
advertisements using that type of
drawings were distributed this
very quarter at the door of the
bookstore? As it has been
mentioned, as long as the symbol
is retained it is impossible to
control its depiction.
In fighting against demeaning,
exploitive stereotypes, as in many
other ways, the Chicano and the
Indian are together. Uncle
Tomahawks and old grads, not

withstanding, Stanford must stop
using the Indian as its mascot.

Editor, THE DAILY:
In your blind dash to condemn
the University for use of the word
"Indian" as a symbol of the
School, it seems obvious to the
casual observer that such
self-hatred is little more than a
classic compliance with the
doctrine of self-fulfillment. THE
DAILY editorializes that "a
symbol which exploits or degrades
any race or ethnic group cannot
be tolerated."
Yet, far from being degrading,
such symbols are chosen precisely
for opposite qualities, i.e. pride,
bravery, and strength. Other
commonly used symbols clearly
demonstrate this point: the
Giants, Lions, Warriors, Bears,
Eagles, etc. All of these are
symbols of superiority and are
chosen for what we respect, not
what we find degrading.

The Chicanos in the School of
Education Association wish to
state its support of the Native
American Indians at Stanford
asking for elimination of the
Indian as a mascot for the athletic
teams.
Cartoons and editorials in the
local newspapers clearly illustrate
the extent to which the American
Indian is depersonalized and
dismissed by the dominant
society. On February 6, in the San
Francisco Chronicle, cartoonist
Graysmith equates the sensitivities
of human beings with those of
birds. An editorial that day, same
page, says the Native American
Indians should be proud to have
Stanford use the Indian as its
mascot, since Stanford University
beat Michigan in a football game!
That the fun and games of college
students should be meaningful to
the most disfranchised group of
people in this country just doesn't
follow.
The Stanford Bookstore
discontinued using the laughable
Indian caricature in its
merchandise, and good for them.
But, how many desk blotters with
advertisements using that type of
drawings were distributed this
very quarter at the door of the
bookstore? As it has been
mentioned, as long as the symbol
is retained it is impossible to
control its depiction.
In fighting against demeaning,
exploitive stereotypes, as in many
other ways, the Chicano and the
Indian are together. Uncle
Tomahawks and old grads, not

withstanding, Stanford must stop
using the Indian as its mascot.

In your blind dash to condemn
the University for use of the word
"Indian" as a symbol of the
School, it seems obvious to the
casual observer that such
self-hatred is little more than a
classic compliance with the
doctrine of self-fulfillment. THE
DAILY editorializes that "a
symbol which exploits or degrades
any race or ethnic group cannot
be tolerated."
Yet, far from being degrading,
such symbols are chosen precisely
for opposite qualities, i.e. pride,
bravery, and strength. Other
commonly used symbols clearly
demonstrate this point: the
Giants, Lions, Warriors, Bears,
Eagles, etc. All of these are
symbols of superiority and are
chosen for what we respect, not
what we find degrading.

Editor, THE DAILY:
During the past weeks, I have
read with some concern about the
controversy over the American
Indian as the Stanford University
symbol. Many people, objecting
to what they consider a "debasing
racial symbol," have insisted that
the University abandon it
immediately. Those who suggest
that this question be put to a vote
of the Stanford community in a
referendum are usually told that,
since using the Indian as a
"mascot" is a racial slur, the
community has no right to use it,
no matter how many want to, any
more than anyone has the right to
deny Blacks their civil rights, no
matter how large the vote.
But many others do not
consider the Indian issue as
clear-cut as this. Though there
have been those insisting that this
symbol must be abolished in order
to stop the ridiculing of native
Americans, there are others who
just as strongly believe that using
an American Indian as Stanford's
symbol need not contribute to the
oppression of this minority, and
that, furthermore, the symbol can
be a rallying point for a stronger
dedication to the Indians' struggle
for equality.
My purpose in writing this
letter is not to advocate either
viewpoint. What disturbs me in
the rhetoric on both sides, but
particularly from those against the
Indian symbol, is the implication
that the issue is so clear-cut, and
some particular opinion the only
acceptable one, that no other
opinion is morally justified or
worthy of any consideration.
Those who suggest that the nature
tne question is such as to rule
at any community voice in favor
112 keeping the Indian as the
jtanford symbol should keep in

mind that they may be playing
around with a philosophy which
has been the "justification" for
many of the most barbaric
dictatorships in the recorded
history of mankind. By using such
methods , they invite into their
movement people who do not
particularly care about the plight
of the American Indian except as
such "concern" may help them to
accomplish less humanitarian
ends.
I sincerely hope that, before
any decision to adopt a new
University symbol is finalized, the
Stanford community will be given
a chance to express its position on
the matter through a referendum,
in which those voting will have
the option of voting to retain the
Indian if they wish to so vote. To
do otherwise would be to take a
step in a direction that an open
university would want to avoid.

I propose that Stanford adopt
as its mascot the dove. Man has
long chosen symbols in order to
both reflect and disseminate
values. With unfortunate accuracy
these symbols in the past have
consisted largely of predators:
Wildcats, Lions, Yellow Jackets,
Warriors, etc. Given the need for
our society to redefine its value
system along more ecological and
humanitarian lines, the choice of
the dove as a symbol for Stanford
seems appropriate. I plan to place
this recommendation on the
ballot in the spring quarter
election. I also call on the ASSU
Senate to consider this
recommendation.

referendum are usually told that,
since using the Indian as a
"mascot" is a racial slur, the
community has no right to use it,
no matter how many want to, any
more than anyone has the right to
deny Blacks their civil rights, no
matter how large the vote.
But many others do not
consider the Indian issue as
clear-cut as this. Though there
have been those insisting that this
symbol must be abolished in order
to stop the ridiculing of native
Americans, there are others who
just as strongly believe that using
an American Indian as Stanford's
symbol need not contribute to the
oppression of this minority, and
that, furthermore, the symbol can
be a rallying point for a stronger
dedication to the Indians' struggle
for equality.
My purpose in writing this
letter is not to advocate either
viewpoint. What disturbs me in
the rhetoric on both sides, but
particularly from those against the
Indian symbol, is the implication
that the issue is so clear-cut, and
some particular opinion the only
acceptable one, that no other
opinion is morally justified or
worthy of any consideration.
Those who suggest that the nature
tne question is such as to rule
at any community voice in favor
112 keeping the Indian as the
jtanford symbol should keep in

mind that they may be playing
around with a philosophy which
has been the "justification" for
many of the most barbaric
dictatorships in the recorded
history of mankind. By using such
methods , they invite into their
movement people who do not
particularly care about the plight
of the American Indian except as
such "concern" may help them to
accomplish less humanitarian
ends.
I sincerely hope that, before
any decision to adopt a new
University symbol is finalized, the
Stanford community will be given
a chance to express its position on
the matter through a referendum,
in which those voting will have
the option of voting to retain the
Indian if they wish to so vote. To
do otherwise would be to take a
step in a direction that an open
university would want to avoid.

I propose that Stanford adopt
as its mascot the dove. Man has
long chosen symbols in order to
both reflect and disseminate
values. With unfortunate accuracy
these symbols in the past have
consisted largely of predators:
Wildcats, Lions, Yellow Jackets,
Warriors, etc. Given the need for
our society to redefine its value
system along more ecological and
humanitarian lines, the choice of
the dove as a symbol for Stanford
seems appropriate. I plan to place
this recommendation on the
ballot in the spring quarter
election. I also call on the ASSU
Senate to consider this
recommendation.

The Chicanos in the School of
Education Association wish to
state its support of the Native
American Indians at Stanford
asking for elimination of the
Indian as a mascot for the athletic
teams.
Cartoons and editorials in the
local newspapers clearly illustrate
the extent to which the American
Indian is depersonalized and
dismissed by the dominant
society. On February 6, in the San
Francisco Chronicle, cartoonist
Graysmith equates the sensitivities
of human beings with those of
birds. An editorial that day, same
page, says the Native American
Indians should be proud to have
Stanford use the Indian as its
mascot, since Stanford University
beat Michigan in a football game!
That the fun and games of college
students should be meaningful to
the most disfranchised group of
people in this country just doesn't
follow.
The Stanford Bookstore
discontinued using the laughable
Indian caricature in its
merchandise, and good for them.
But, how many desk blotters with
advertisements using that type of
drawings were distributed this
very quarter at the door of the
bookstore? As it has been
mentioned, as long as the symbol
is retained it is impossible to
control its depiction.
In fighting against demeaning,
exploitive stereotypes, as in many
other ways, the Chicano and the
Indian are together. Uncle
Tomahawks and old grads, not

withstanding, Stanford must stop
using the Indian as its mascot.

In your blind dash to condemn
the University for use of the word
"Indian" as a symbol of the
School, it seems obvious to the
casual observer that such
self-hatred is little more than a
classic compliance with the
doctrine of self-fulfillment. THE
DAILY editorializes that "a
symbol which exploits or degrades
any race or ethnic group cannot
be tolerated."
Yet, far from being degrading,
such symbols are chosen precisely
for opposite qualities, i.e. pride,
bravery, and strength. Other
commonly used symbols clearly
demonstrate this point: the
Giants, Lions, Warriors, Bears,
Eagles, etc. All of these are
symbols of superiority and are
chosen for what we respect, not
what we find degrading.

Editor, THE DAILY:
During the past weeks, I have
read with some concern about the
controversy over the American
Indian as the Stanford University
symbol. Many people, objecting
to what they consider a "debasing
racial symbol," have insisted that
the University abandon it
immediately. Those who suggest
that this question be put to a vote
of the Stanford community in a
referendum are usually told that,
since using the Indian as a
"mascot" is a racial slur, the
community has no right to use it,
no matter how many want to, any
