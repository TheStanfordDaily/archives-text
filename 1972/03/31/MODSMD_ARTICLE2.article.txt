# Minority Enrollment Increases Since '68
## 
### DICK LUTHER 
Since the academic year 1968-69.
the number of minority students at
Stanford has risen from 523 to 1348,
while the total enrollment has not
changed, according to a recent report
of the Academic Planning Office.
The report defines minority stu
dents as Asian American, black,
Chicano, and Native American. Foreign
students are not included in the
figures.
The greatest increase in minorities
has taken place among undergraduates,
where the enrollment has risen from
371 to 907 in the past three years.

Broken down between groups at
the undergraduate level, black enroll
ment went from 169 to 339; Asian
American from 156 to 264; Native
Americans from 8 to a present
enrollment of 50. The increase was
largest among Chicanos—from 38 to
254 in three years.
While the undergraduate enrollment
saw the greatest numerical influx of
minorities, the graduate school saw the
largest percentage increase, tripling
from 142 to 441.
In the graduate school black enroll
ment increased from 57 to 209, Asian
Americans from 59 to 107, Chicanos
from 20 to 114, and Native Americans
from 6 to 11.
Overall these four minority groups
make up 11.7 percent of the student
population now. Three years ago only
4.6 percent of Stanford students were
classified as minority.
The report adds that "this year's
freshman class included 248 minority
students, roughly one-sixth the enter
ing class of 1400." The class included
89 blacks, 76 Asian Americans, 63
Chicanos and 20 Native Americans.
Most Extensive Records
These figures are the most extensive
Stanford has ever had for minority
enrollment. According to Associate
Provost Ray Bachetti, head of the
Academic Planning Office, 1968-69
was the first academic year figures
were kept.
Bachetti explains that the spirit of
liberalism which dominated the coun
try ten years ago created an atmos

phere in which taking such statistics
was looked on with great disfavor, and
in some cases was illegal.
But a change in attitude occurred
toward the end of the decade, said
Bachetti. "People found out you
couldn't chart progress unless you
counted. You had to know the
figures."
BSU, Lyman Confer
Prior to 1968 there was no official
commitment of any sort by the
University to expand the number of
minority students. Following the
death of Martin Luther King in 1968,
members of the Black Student Union
met with then Provost Richard Lyman
concerning demands for a larger black
enrollment.
Out of those discussions grew the
first formal commitment to minority
students, the Task Force program
initiated in April of 1968, designed
"to equalize educational opportunities
for minority students and to increase
the number of minority students at
Stanford."
The program included recruitment
of minority students and suggested
non-traditional criteria for judging
admissions applications.
Despite the commitments, Charles
Ogletree, chairman of the Stanford
BSU, feels that the number of blacks
here is limited by a quota system.
Referring to the recent enrollment
figures, he said, "Regardless of any
type of enrollment, they're not going
to get enough blacks here."
"Admission is controlled by alum

ni. They don't want a campus filled
with minorities," he added.
Improving Conditions Emphasis
Ogletree said the emphasis of the
BSU is not now so much on
admissions as improving the conditions
of black students here.
"We're trying to make things as
pleasant as possible for blacks here.
Black studies is the trip we're on
rather than trying to get more blacks
in."
He said that when trying to recruit
high school students to come to
Stanford, "We have to tell the black
students the truth before they come
.. . It's not going to be rosy, there's
going to be a lot of racism."
Jose Razo, a member of the Mesa
Directiva for the chicano student
organization here said he is "happy"
with the increase of chicanos, but
added, "We're not satisfied with the
University's commitment."
The enrollment increase will level
off, Razo predicted, since "things that
are granted are usually temporary."
Other schools are leveling off on
chicano enrollment, and the same
cut-backs will be coming to Stanford,
too, he warned.
Rhue Not Satisfied
Tom Rhue, Assistant to the Dean
of Graduate Studies, is not satisfied
with the increase in minority enroll
ment. "There should still be more
. . . right now enrollment is just 2.5
percent across the board at the
graduate level," he said.
But Rhue, who is black, concedes
that the statistics are slightly lopsided;
the School of Engineering, large and
with few minority students, brings
down the average. "Without the
School of Engineering, the statistics
are slightly different."
In trying to augment graduate
minority enrollment, Rhue cannot
influence graduate admissions directly.
At the graduate level each department
and school has its own admissions
committee.
"All we can do is to encourage the
departments and bring to their atten
tion minority applications," Rhue
noted.
At the undergraduate level admis
sions policy is determined by the
Committee on Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aids (CUAFA) of
the Academic Council.
But because of its commitment to
"quality education," Material Sciences
Professor Arthur Bienenstock, chair
man of CUAFA, does not feel that the
University can at this time increase
minority enrollment as fast as some
would like.
The University has two options in
Bienenstock's opinion: to seek out
more qualified minority applicants,
and to enroll more of them once they
are admitted to Stanford.
But he opposes a quota system
which he feels would impose an
arbitrary level of minority students on
the University.

has taken place among undergraduates,
where the enrollment has risen from
371 to 907 in the past three years.

Broken down between groups at
the undergraduate level, black enroll
ment went from 169 to 339; Asian
American from 156 to 264; Native
Americans from 8 to a present
enrollment of 50. The increase was
largest among Chicanos—from 38 to
254 in three years.
While the undergraduate enrollment
saw the greatest numerical influx of
minorities, the graduate school saw the
largest percentage increase, tripling
from 142 to 441.
In the graduate school black enroll
ment increased from 57 to 209, Asian
Americans from 59 to 107, Chicanos
from 20 to 114, and Native Americans
from 6 to 11.
Overall these four minority groups
make up 11.7 percent of the student
population now. Three years ago only
4.6 percent of Stanford students were
classified as minority.
The report adds that "this year's
freshman class included 248 minority
students, roughly one-sixth the enter
ing class of 1400." The class included
89 blacks, 76 Asian Americans, 63
Chicanos and 20 Native Americans.
Most Extensive Records
These figures are the most extensive
Stanford has ever had for minority
enrollment. According to Associate
Provost Ray Bachetti, head of the
Academic Planning Office, 1968-69
was the first academic year figures
were kept.
Bachetti explains that the spirit of
liberalism which dominated the coun
try ten years ago created an atmos

phere in which taking such statistics
was looked on with great disfavor, and
in some cases was illegal.
But a change in attitude occurred
toward the end of the decade, said
Bachetti. "People found out you
couldn't chart progress unless you
counted. You had to know the
figures."
BSU, Lyman Confer
Prior to 1968 there was no official
commitment of any sort by the
University to expand the number of
minority students. Following the
death of Martin Luther King in 1968,
members of the Black Student Union
met with then Provost Richard Lyman
concerning demands for a larger black
enrollment.
Out of those discussions grew the
first formal commitment to minority
students, the Task Force program
initiated in April of 1968, designed
"to equalize educational opportunities
for minority students and to increase
the number of minority students at
Stanford."
The program included recruitment
of minority students and suggested
non-traditional criteria for judging
admissions applications.
Despite the commitments, Charles
Ogletree, chairman of the Stanford
BSU, feels that the number of blacks
here is limited by a quota system.
Referring to the recent enrollment
figures, he said, "Regardless of any
type of enrollment, they're not going
to get enough blacks here."
"Admission is controlled by alum

ni. They don't want a campus filled
with minorities," he added.
Improving Conditions Emphasis
Ogletree said the emphasis of the
BSU is not now so much on
admissions as improving the conditions
of black students here.
"We're trying to make things as
pleasant as possible for blacks here.
Black studies is the trip we're on
rather than trying to get more blacks
in."
He said that when trying to recruit
high school students to come to
Stanford, "We have to tell the black
students the truth before they come
.. . It's not going to be rosy, there's
going to be a lot of racism."
Jose Razo, a member of the Mesa
Directiva for the chicano student
organization here said he is "happy"
with the increase of chicanos, but
added, "We're not satisfied with the
University's commitment."
The enrollment increase will level
off, Razo predicted, since "things that
are granted are usually temporary."
Other schools are leveling off on
chicano enrollment, and the same
cut-backs will be coming to Stanford,
too, he warned.
Rhue Not Satisfied
Tom Rhue, Assistant to the Dean
of Graduate Studies, is not satisfied
with the increase in minority enroll
ment. "There should still be more
. . . right now enrollment is just 2.5
percent across the board at the
graduate level," he said.
But Rhue, who is black, concedes
that the statistics are slightly lopsided;
the School of Engineering, large and
with few minority students, brings
down the average. "Without the
School of Engineering, the statistics
are slightly different."
In trying to augment graduate
minority enrollment, Rhue cannot
influence graduate admissions directly.
At the graduate level each department
and school has its own admissions
committee.
"All we can do is to encourage the
departments and bring to their atten
tion minority applications," Rhue
noted.
At the undergraduate level admis
sions policy is determined by the
Committee on Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aids (CUAFA) of
the Academic Council.
But because of its commitment to
"quality education," Material Sciences
Professor Arthur Bienenstock, chair
man of CUAFA, does not feel that the
University can at this time increase
minority enrollment as fast as some
would like.
The University has two options in
Bienenstock's opinion: to seek out
more qualified minority applicants,
and to enroll more of them once they
are admitted to Stanford.
But he opposes a quota system
which he feels would impose an
arbitrary level of minority students on
the University.

254 in three years.
While the undergraduate enrollment
saw the greatest numerical influx of
minorities, the graduate school saw the
largest percentage increase, tripling
from 142 to 441.
In the graduate school black enroll
ment increased from 57 to 209, Asian
Americans from 59 to 107, Chicanos
from 20 to 114, and Native Americans
from 6 to 11.
Overall these four minority groups
make up 11.7 percent of the student
population now. Three years ago only
4.6 percent of Stanford students were
classified as minority.
The report adds that "this year's
freshman class included 248 minority
students, roughly one-sixth the enter
ing class of 1400." The class included
89 blacks, 76 Asian Americans, 63
Chicanos and 20 Native Americans.
Most Extensive Records
These figures are the most extensive
Stanford has ever had for minority
enrollment. According to Associate
Provost Ray Bachetti, head of the
Academic Planning Office, 1968-69
was the first academic year figures
were kept.
Bachetti explains that the spirit of
liberalism which dominated the coun
try ten years ago created an atmos

phere in which taking such statistics
was looked on with great disfavor, and
in some cases was illegal.
But a change in attitude occurred
toward the end of the decade, said
Bachetti. "People found out you
couldn't chart progress unless you
counted. You had to know the
figures."
BSU, Lyman Confer
Prior to 1968 there was no official
commitment of any sort by the
University to expand the number of
minority students. Following the
death of Martin Luther King in 1968,
members of the Black Student Union
met with then Provost Richard Lyman
concerning demands for a larger black
enrollment.
Out of those discussions grew the
first formal commitment to minority
students, the Task Force program
initiated in April of 1968, designed
"to equalize educational opportunities
for minority students and to increase
the number of minority students at
Stanford."
The program included recruitment
of minority students and suggested
non-traditional criteria for judging
admissions applications.
Despite the commitments, Charles
Ogletree, chairman of the Stanford
BSU, feels that the number of blacks
here is limited by a quota system.
Referring to the recent enrollment
figures, he said, "Regardless of any
type of enrollment, they're not going
to get enough blacks here."
"Admission is controlled by alum

ni. They don't want a campus filled
with minorities," he added.
Improving Conditions Emphasis
Ogletree said the emphasis of the
BSU is not now so much on
admissions as improving the conditions
of black students here.
"We're trying to make things as
pleasant as possible for blacks here.
Black studies is the trip we're on
rather than trying to get more blacks
in."
He said that when trying to recruit
high school students to come to
Stanford, "We have to tell the black
students the truth before they come
.. . It's not going to be rosy, there's
going to be a lot of racism."
Jose Razo, a member of the Mesa
Directiva for the chicano student
organization here said he is "happy"
with the increase of chicanos, but
added, "We're not satisfied with the
University's commitment."
The enrollment increase will level
off, Razo predicted, since "things that
are granted are usually temporary."
Other schools are leveling off on
chicano enrollment, and the same
cut-backs will be coming to Stanford,
too, he warned.
Rhue Not Satisfied
Tom Rhue, Assistant to the Dean
of Graduate Studies, is not satisfied
with the increase in minority enroll
ment. "There should still be more
. . . right now enrollment is just 2.5
percent across the board at the
graduate level," he said.
But Rhue, who is black, concedes
that the statistics are slightly lopsided;
the School of Engineering, large and
with few minority students, brings
down the average. "Without the
School of Engineering, the statistics
are slightly different."
In trying to augment graduate
minority enrollment, Rhue cannot
influence graduate admissions directly.
At the graduate level each department
and school has its own admissions
committee.
"All we can do is to encourage the
departments and bring to their atten
tion minority applications," Rhue
noted.
At the undergraduate level admis
sions policy is determined by the
Committee on Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aids (CUAFA) of
the Academic Council.
But because of its commitment to
"quality education," Material Sciences
Professor Arthur Bienenstock, chair
man of CUAFA, does not feel that the
University can at this time increase
minority enrollment as fast as some
would like.
The University has two options in
Bienenstock's opinion: to seek out
more qualified minority applicants,
and to enroll more of them once they
are admitted to Stanford.
But he opposes a quota system
which he feels would impose an
arbitrary level of minority students on
the University.

BSU DEMANDS—The University's commitment to increased minority
admissions began in 1968. Members of the Black Student Union met with then
provost Lyman to discuss black demands. Since then minority enrollment has
more than doubled.
Since the academic year 1968-69.
the number of minority students at
Stanford has risen from 523 to 1348,
while the total enrollment has not
changed, according to a recent report
of the Academic Planning Office.
The report defines minority stu
dents as Asian American, black,
Chicano, and Native American. Foreign
students are not included in the
figures.
The greatest increase in minorities
has taken place among undergraduates,
where the enrollment has risen from
371 to 907 in the past three years.

Broken down between groups at
the undergraduate level, black enroll
ment went from 169 to 339; Asian
American from 156 to 264; Native
Americans from 8 to a present
enrollment of 50. The increase was
largest among Chicanos—from 38 to
