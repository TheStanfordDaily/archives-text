# Bunce Near Canadian Club Contract
## 
### 
Former Stanford quarterback
Don Bunce says he's fairly close
to signing a contract with the
Canadian Football League's
British Columbia Lions.
However, Bunce flew to

Washington Wednesday to meet
with Redskins coach George
Allen. He doesn't anticipate "any
offer that will match what British
Columbia has offered."
Bunce drafted by the Redskins
in the 12th round, said he had
done u a great deal of talking with
British Columbia," adding that he
was "real excited about the
possibilities."
He said the CFL club had
proposed a three year contract,
but declined to say how much had
been offered. "We haven't set a

specific date for any
announcement," he added, "since
I would at least like to talk to
Allen first."
"A big deciding factor for me
would be the chance to go to
school at the same time I'm
playing football," said Bunce,
who wants to be a doctor. He said
the University of British Columbia
at Vancouver has a good medical
school.
Bunce was also happy with the
fact that he would have a chance
to play a lot in Canada and that

the season was much shorter and
not as demanding as in the United
States. The Canadians' season runs
from mid-June until the first week
in November and the majority of
practices are at night.
He expressed disappointment
with the results of the draft. "I
had been led to believe I was
going to go higher," he said,
"possibly in the first couple of
rounds. Initially it disappointed
me. Now, however, the Canadian
offer might be a great
opportunity."
