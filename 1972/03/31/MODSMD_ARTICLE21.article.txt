# Berlioz Requiem A Musical Feast
## 
### DAVID W. WILLIAMS 
It would be vain indeed to attempt to find the figure or the image
to do justice to Wednesday's performance of the Berlioz "Requium"
by the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, the Stanford University
Chorus and Choir, directed by Harold Schmidt, and the great tenor
Mr. Stuart Borrows all under the direction of Mr. Ozawa.
Yes, there was one strange note from one of the trumpets in the
balcony, but I had never noticed that phrase before, and somehow the
sound of the orchestra did not fill up the War Memorial Opera House,
as apparently Berlioz's forces did the Chapel of St. Louis at the
Invalides on December 5, 1837. None the less, Ozawa was
magnificent, Stuart Borrows was magnificent, and the choir was
magnificent.
Epicurean Feast
On the one hand the concert was a promise of good things to
come, and on the other, a splendid epicurean feast. Berlioz, partially
because of Colin Davis's complete Phillips recording project, and
Boulez's energetic efforts on the composer's behalf, has begun to
assume the status of a very great composer, in some ways the equal of
Beethoven himself. His art, painstakingly designed to be very popular
is the rich result of superb literary taste, and a carefully balanced
classic-romantic style, absolutely French in its pursuit of the most
elegant dramatic effect.
In his Memoirs, the composer tells us of the difficulty of
performing the "Requium," commissioned by the Compte de
Gasparin, Minister of Fine Arts, for a "service" honoring those who
had fallen in the Revolution of 1830. Berlioz finished the vast
composition on June 29, 1837, and according to mad Hector, his
enemies prevented its performance out of pure spite. At any rate the
death of one General Damremont, one of the earliest casualtjes of the
Algerian fiasco, caused even his enemies to apply to Berlioz for the
"Requium."
Liturgical Masterpiece
It is surely one of the masterpieces of liturgical composition, more
impressive even than Verdi's setting of this text, and despite its
sweeping effects as deeply moving as Mozart's unfinished work in the
same form, to which the composer alludes occasionally, most
particularly in the Rex Tremendae. The music is of incredibly even
quality, reflecting at every turn Berlioz's devotion to the study of
music ancient and modern, alluding even to Rossini at one point.
I cannot imagine a better performance, though at one or two
moments the first sopranos seemed to waver a bit, and it would be
difficult to say which parts were best performed. Still the "Tuba
Mirum," with its extensive use of balconied trumpets, usually
accounted the best section of the piece, was done to sonorous
perfection; the Lacrymosa was lovely, and indeed Stuart Borrows's
exquisite handling of the almost Donizettian phrasing of the Eostias
was too beautiful to be believed. Ozawa's sensitivity, devotion to
detail and incredible diligence were sublimely manifest last night, and
everyone seemed to sense it. My sole disappointment was that it came
at last to an end, and I had to begin clapping and shouting over and
over bravissimo, bravissimi.

Liturgical Masterpiece
It is surely one of the masterpieces of liturgical composition, more
impressive even than Verdi's setting of this text, and despite its
sweeping effects as deeply moving as Mozart's unfinished work in the
same form, to which the composer alludes occasionally, most
particularly in the Rex Tremendae. The music is of incredibly even
quality, reflecting at every turn Berlioz's devotion to the study of
music ancient and modern, alluding even to Rossini at one point.
I cannot imagine a better performance, though at one or two
moments the first sopranos seemed to waver a bit, and it would be
difficult to say which parts were best performed. Still the "Tuba
Mirum," with its extensive use of balconied trumpets, usually
accounted the best section of the piece, was done to sonorous
perfection; the Lacrymosa was lovely, and indeed Stuart Borrows's
exquisite handling of the almost Donizettian phrasing of the Eostias
was too beautiful to be believed. Ozawa's sensitivity, devotion to
detail and incredible diligence were sublimely manifest last night, and
everyone seemed to sense it. My sole disappointment was that it came
at last to an end, and I had to begin clapping and shouting over and
over bravissimo, bravissimi.
It would be vain indeed to attempt to find the figure or the image
to do justice to Wednesday's performance of the Berlioz "Requium"
by the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, the Stanford University
Chorus and Choir, directed by Harold Schmidt, and the great tenor
Mr. Stuart Borrows all under the direction of Mr. Ozawa.
Yes, there was one strange note from one of the trumpets in the
balcony, but I had never noticed that phrase before, and somehow the
sound of the orchestra did not fill up the War Memorial Opera House,
as apparently Berlioz's forces did the Chapel of St. Louis at the
Invalides on December 5, 1837. None the less, Ozawa was
magnificent, Stuart Borrows was magnificent, and the choir was
magnificent.
Epicurean Feast
On the one hand the concert was a promise of good things to
come, and on the other, a splendid epicurean feast. Berlioz, partially
because of Colin Davis's complete Phillips recording project, and
Boulez's energetic efforts on the composer's behalf, has begun to
assume the status of a very great composer, in some ways the equal of
Beethoven himself. His art, painstakingly designed to be very popular
is the rich result of superb literary taste, and a carefully balanced
classic-romantic style, absolutely French in its pursuit of the most
elegant dramatic effect.
In his Memoirs, the composer tells us of the difficulty of
performing the "Requium," commissioned by the Compte de
Gasparin, Minister of Fine Arts, for a "service" honoring those who
had fallen in the Revolution of 1830. Berlioz finished the vast
composition on June 29, 1837, and according to mad Hector, his
enemies prevented its performance out of pure spite. At any rate the
death of one General Damremont, one of the earliest casualtjes of the
Algerian fiasco, caused even his enemies to apply to Berlioz for the
"Requium."
