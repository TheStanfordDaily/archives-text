# 'The Contractor’: Concrete Play
## 
### STU ALLEN 
The Contractor, a play now at
the Geary, deals with five
workmen putting up a tent for the
outdoor wedding of the daughter
of the owner of the tent
company. The characters are thus
related to each other by close
daily contact or by blood, in the
case of the tent contractor's
family.
In the course of the play,
written by David Storey, these
relationships are paramount: they
are exposed and shown to be
static, arbitrary ties that do not
contribute to the growth and
happiness of the characters, but
instead put crippling strains of
inexplicable origin on the
individuals.
Tension is at the forefront of
the play. For example, the
contractor's son, home from the
University for his sister's wedding,
is always in a pose of clenched
frustration. His father, played
credibly by Ray Reinhardt, seems
to be happy only when he is
working or nagging his Irish
workers who aren't, and he
refuses to recognize, accept, or
treat his son kindly.
Unexplained Tension
The most glaring defect of the
play, however, is that the viewer is
never told just what is eating
whom. For example, the conflict
between father and son exists on
two levels that do not agree at all.
The emotional barrier between
two generations is certainly a
source of conflict, but as
portrayed on stage, that sort of
conflict is given too little depth
for the viewer to accept it as the
cause of the angry, sullen
exchanges between the son and
the contractor.
To harp on one overplayed
character (Larry Carpenter as the
son) would be unfair. The whole
production, however, is fused
with unexplained tension. The
director, William Bell, arranges the
characters on stage to be far apart
or alone during moments of calm,
while in tense scenes the stage is
usually crowded. The blocking

thus contributes to the unreality
of the tension by providing a
sharp distinction between war and
peace.
All but the last fifteen minutes
of the play, then, consists mostly
of various characters mostly at
each other's throat. In the case of
Bennett, a strong, silent workman
whose wife has recently left him,
and Fitzpatrick, the lazy
loudmouth workman who delights
in blue comedy, "at each other's
throat" is to be taken literally. In
the third act, the idle Fitzpatrick
(it is an understatement to say
that Storey's characters lend
themselves to being stereotyped)
goads the quiet, hard-working
Bennett into an unconvincing
attack on Fitzpatrick with a
crowbar.
The result of all this bitterness,
both on and below the surface, is
that most of the play is quite
boring. The point is that people
can't get along with each other
without agreeing to "lay off" each
other, to use Bennett's words.
Humor Relieves Ennui
In addition, even if they do
concur in accepting each other at
face value, their relationship will
be superficial. This is borne out in
the marriage of the contractor and
his wife: they never exhibit any
spark of affection or deep care for
each other, yet in the end they
walk off arm in arm to continue
their "normal" life together.
The author's point is well
taken, but demonstrated by
Storey and by the ACT
production in such unremitting
detail that the play drags on for
fully two and one half acts. This
ennui is relieved, however, by
several humorous characters: the
contractor's father, played by G.
Wood, and the duo of Marshall
and Fitzpatrick, played by
Herbert Foster and E. Kerrigan
Prescott, who are the two
protagonists goading the action
along by their mock slapstick
insults.^
The moments of humor are
mostly produced ay either good
acting or gimmicks, and are not

generally interwoven with the
action. Indeed the play is only
entertaining in the last fifteen
minutes, when it turns its focus to
the cause of the deterioration of
social relations. It is blamed,
tritely enough, on modern times,
especially machines, which seem
to have pulled people apart,
dehumanized them and left
people with only facades to
present to each other.
This answer is unsatisfactory
dramatically because it tells little
about the specific situation in
which, for example, the
contractor hires only the debris of
society: cripples, convicts, and

bums, who do his bidding and his
work.
Ironically, however, it works
theatrically. The pace is slowed,
the level of tension drops, and the
characters seem to have
more depth: they are more real
and believable. As Bennett
explains how he feels about
Fitzpatrick, for example, the
viewer feels an empathy for these
men that until then was missing.
One is left wondering, is it
worth the price of tickets, gas and
parking to see this play? Probably
not, for the last fifteen minutes,
while entertaining and
worthwhile, do not save The
Contractor in toto.

relationships are paramount: they
are exposed and shown to be
static, arbitrary ties that do not
contribute to the growth and
happiness of the characters, but
instead put crippling strains of
inexplicable origin on the
individuals.
Tension is at the forefront of
the play. For example, the
contractor's son, home from the
University for his sister's wedding,
is always in a pose of clenched
frustration. His father, played
credibly by Ray Reinhardt, seems
to be happy only when he is
working or nagging his Irish
workers who aren't, and he
refuses to recognize, accept, or
treat his son kindly.
Unexplained Tension
The most glaring defect of the
play, however, is that the viewer is
never told just what is eating
whom. For example, the conflict
between father and son exists on
two levels that do not agree at all.
The emotional barrier between
two generations is certainly a
source of conflict, but as
portrayed on stage, that sort of
conflict is given too little depth
for the viewer to accept it as the
cause of the angry, sullen
exchanges between the son and
the contractor.
To harp on one overplayed
character (Larry Carpenter as the
son) would be unfair. The whole
production, however, is fused
with unexplained tension. The
director, William Bell, arranges the
characters on stage to be far apart
or alone during moments of calm,
while in tense scenes the stage is
usually crowded. The blocking

thus contributes to the unreality
of the tension by providing a
sharp distinction between war and
peace.
All but the last fifteen minutes
of the play, then, consists mostly
of various characters mostly at
each other's throat. In the case of
Bennett, a strong, silent workman
whose wife has recently left him,
and Fitzpatrick, the lazy
loudmouth workman who delights
in blue comedy, "at each other's
throat" is to be taken literally. In
the third act, the idle Fitzpatrick
(it is an understatement to say
that Storey's characters lend
themselves to being stereotyped)
goads the quiet, hard-working
Bennett into an unconvincing
attack on Fitzpatrick with a
crowbar.
The result of all this bitterness,
both on and below the surface, is
that most of the play is quite
boring. The point is that people
can't get along with each other
without agreeing to "lay off" each
other, to use Bennett's words.
Humor Relieves Ennui
In addition, even if they do
concur in accepting each other at
face value, their relationship will
be superficial. This is borne out in
the marriage of the contractor and
his wife: they never exhibit any
spark of affection or deep care for
each other, yet in the end they
walk off arm in arm to continue
their "normal" life together.
The author's point is well
taken, but demonstrated by
Storey and by the ACT
production in such unremitting
detail that the play drags on for
fully two and one half acts. This
ennui is relieved, however, by
several humorous characters: the
contractor's father, played by G.
Wood, and the duo of Marshall
and Fitzpatrick, played by
Herbert Foster and E. Kerrigan
Prescott, who are the two
protagonists goading the action
along by their mock slapstick
insults.^
The moments of humor are
mostly produced ay either good
acting or gimmicks, and are not

generally interwoven with the
action. Indeed the play is only
entertaining in the last fifteen
minutes, when it turns its focus to
the cause of the deterioration of
social relations. It is blamed,
tritely enough, on modern times,
especially machines, which seem
to have pulled people apart,
dehumanized them and left
people with only facades to
present to each other.
This answer is unsatisfactory
dramatically because it tells little
about the specific situation in
which, for example, the
contractor hires only the debris of
society: cripples, convicts, and

bums, who do his bidding and his
work.
Ironically, however, it works
theatrically. The pace is slowed,
the level of tension drops, and the
characters seem to have
more depth: they are more real
and believable. As Bennett
explains how he feels about
Fitzpatrick, for example, the
viewer feels an empathy for these
men that until then was missing.
One is left wondering, is it
worth the price of tickets, gas and
parking to see this play? Probably
not, for the last fifteen minutes,
while entertaining and
worthwhile, do not save The
Contractor in toto.

The Contractor, a play now at

of the owner of the tent

related to each other by close
daily contact or by blood, in the

frustration. His father, played
credibly by Ray Reinhardt, seems
to be happy only when he is
working or nagging his Irish
workers who aren't, and he
refuses to recognize, accept, or
treat his son kindly.
Unexplained Tension
The most glaring defect of the
play, however, is that the viewer is
never told just what is eating
whom. For example, the conflict
between father and son exists on
two levels that do not agree at all.
The emotional barrier between
two generations is certainly a
source of conflict, but as
portrayed on stage, that sort of
conflict is given too little depth
for the viewer to accept it as the
cause of the angry, sullen
exchanges between the son and
the contractor.
To harp on one overplayed
character (Larry Carpenter as the
son) would be unfair. The whole
production, however, is fused
with unexplained tension. The
director, William Bell, arranges the
characters on stage to be far apart
or alone during moments of calm,
while in tense scenes the stage is
usually crowded. The blocking

thus contributes to the unreality
of the tension by providing a
sharp distinction between war and
peace.
All but the last fifteen minutes
of the play, then, consists mostly
of various characters mostly at
each other's throat. In the case of
Bennett, a strong, silent workman
whose wife has recently left him,
and Fitzpatrick, the lazy
loudmouth workman who delights
in blue comedy, "at each other's
throat" is to be taken literally. In
the third act, the idle Fitzpatrick
(it is an understatement to say
that Storey's characters lend
themselves to being stereotyped)
goads the quiet, hard-working
Bennett into an unconvincing
attack on Fitzpatrick with a
crowbar.
The result of all this bitterness,
both on and below the surface, is
that most of the play is quite
boring. The point is that people
can't get along with each other
without agreeing to "lay off" each
other, to use Bennett's words.
Humor Relieves Ennui
In addition, even if they do
concur in accepting each other at
face value, their relationship will
be superficial. This is borne out in
the marriage of the contractor and
his wife: they never exhibit any
spark of affection or deep care for
each other, yet in the end they
walk off arm in arm to continue
their "normal" life together.
The author's point is well
taken, but demonstrated by
Storey and by the ACT
production in such unremitting
detail that the play drags on for
fully two and one half acts. This
ennui is relieved, however, by
several humorous characters: the
contractor's father, played by G.
Wood, and the duo of Marshall
and Fitzpatrick, played by
Herbert Foster and E. Kerrigan
Prescott, who are the two
protagonists goading the action
along by their mock slapstick
insults.^
The moments of humor are
mostly produced ay either good
acting or gimmicks, and are not

generally interwoven with the
action. Indeed the play is only
entertaining in the last fifteen
minutes, when it turns its focus to
the cause of the deterioration of
social relations. It is blamed,
tritely enough, on modern times,
especially machines, which seem
to have pulled people apart,
dehumanized them and left
people with only facades to
present to each other.
This answer is unsatisfactory
dramatically because it tells little
about the specific situation in
which, for example, the
contractor hires only the debris of
society: cripples, convicts, and

bums, who do his bidding and his
work.
Ironically, however, it works
theatrically. The pace is slowed,
the level of tension drops, and the
characters seem to have
more depth: they are more real
and believable. As Bennett
explains how he feels about
Fitzpatrick, for example, the
viewer feels an empathy for these
men that until then was missing.
One is left wondering, is it
worth the price of tickets, gas and
parking to see this play? Probably
not, for the last fifteen minutes,
while entertaining and
worthwhile, do not save The
Contractor in toto.
