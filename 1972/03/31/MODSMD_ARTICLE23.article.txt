# Cards Run Fourth In Western Golf
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford's youthful golf team
was 11 strokes off the blistering
pace set by Arizona State
Wednesday in the opening round
of the 26th annual Western
Intercollegiate Championships at
Pasatiempo.
The Sun Devils made a mockery
of Pasatiempo's par of 71 as they
recorded a four man team total of
279, five under regulation figures.
All-American Howard Twitty
paced ASU with a six under par
65 and grabbed the individual lead
in the three day event.
Stanford captain Tom Keelin
fired a three under par 68 and was
tied for third place after the first
round. Dave Baskins and Gary
Vanier were also among the
leaders with scores of 73 and 74.
The Cards amassed a 290 total,
putting them in fourth place, 11
back of Arizona State but only
three behind second place
Brigham Young.
Stanford's starting lineup at
Pasatiempo includes four
freshmen and two seniors.
Veterans Keelin and Vanier are
joined by frosh standouts Baskins,
Bruce Robertson, Conrad
Nilmeier, and Aly Trompas. The
low four scorers count toward the
team total.
These same six players finished
third last week in a strong 10
team field at the Fresno State
Classic. But despite the team's
inexperience, Coach Bud Finger
was not happy with the third
place in Stanford's first major test

of the 1972 season. "We were
disappointed," said Finger, "but
we still have a chance to redeem
ourselves at Pasatiempo."
Brigham Young, ranked second
in the nation in a preseason
coaches' poll, won the Fresno
tourney with a total of 1336
strokes, six ahead of runnerup
Arizona State and 12 ahead ol
Stanford. Lon Hinkle of San
Diego State won the individual
title with a 54 hole total of 214,
edging Stanford's Nilmeier by a
shot. Nilmeier fashioned a strong
four under par 68 in the final
round to complete his impressive
varsity debut.
Keelin tied for sixth at Fresno
with a 220 total. Vanier shot 224
despite a 102 degree fever,
Baskins had 227, Robertson shot
229, and Trompas fired 233.
Unlike this week's Western
tourney, all six scores counted
toward the team total.
Both Robertson and Trompas
had trouble on the final day as
each recorded a 79. Robertson,
who recently reached the finals of
the San Francisco City
Championship, had putting
problems throughout his round
while former U.S. Junior
champion Trompas was plagued
by erratic shots off the tee.
If Robertson and Trompas
regain their championship form,
Stanford will be in an excellent
position to catch Arizona State at
Pasatiempo. Second round play
was completed late yesterday
afternoon with the final round
scheduled for today.

A FUTURE HlT—Stanford's batters have been extremely effective in destroying opposing teams. They
have hit 66 extra-base hits, including 16 homeruns in 28 games. In compiling a 21-6-1 record they have a
team batting average of .281.

229, and Trompas fired 233.
Unlike this week's Western
tourney, all six scores counted
toward the team total.
Both Robertson and Trompas
had trouble on the final day as
each recorded a 79. Robertson,
who recently reached the finals of
the San Francisco City
Championship, had putting
problems throughout his round
while former U.S. Junior
champion Trompas was plagued
by erratic shots off the tee.
If Robertson and Trompas
regain their championship form,
Stanford will be in an excellent
position to catch Arizona State at
Pasatiempo. Second round play
was completed late yesterday
afternoon with the final round
scheduled for today.

A FUTURE HlT—Stanford's batters have been extremely effective in destroying opposing teams. They
have hit 66 extra-base hits, including 16 homeruns in 28 games. In compiling a 21-6-1 record they have a
team batting average of .281.
Stanford's youthful golf team
was 11 strokes off the blistering
pace set by Arizona State
Wednesday in the opening round
of the 26th annual Western
Intercollegiate Championships at
Pasatiempo.
The Sun Devils made a mockery
of Pasatiempo's par of 71 as they
recorded a four man team total of
279, five under regulation figures.
All-American Howard Twitty
paced ASU with a six under par
65 and grabbed the individual lead
in the three day event.
Stanford captain Tom Keelin
fired a three under par 68 and was
tied for third place after the first
round. Dave Baskins and Gary
Vanier were also among the
leaders with scores of 73 and 74.
The Cards amassed a 290 total,
putting them in fourth place, 11
back of Arizona State but only
three behind second place
Brigham Young.
Stanford's starting lineup at
Pasatiempo includes four
freshmen and two seniors.
Veterans Keelin and Vanier are
joined by frosh standouts Baskins,
Bruce Robertson, Conrad
Nilmeier, and Aly Trompas. The
low four scorers count toward the
team total.
These same six players finished
third last week in a strong 10
team field at the Fresno State
Classic. But despite the team's
inexperience, Coach Bud Finger
was not happy with the third
place in Stanford's first major test

of the 1972 season. "We were
disappointed," said Finger, "but
we still have a chance to redeem
ourselves at Pasatiempo."
Brigham Young, ranked second
in the nation in a preseason
coaches' poll, won the Fresno
tourney with a total of 1336
strokes, six ahead of runnerup
Arizona State and 12 ahead ol
Stanford. Lon Hinkle of San
Diego State won the individual
title with a 54 hole total of 214,
edging Stanford's Nilmeier by a
shot. Nilmeier fashioned a strong
four under par 68 in the final
round to complete his impressive
varsity debut.
Keelin tied for sixth at Fresno
with a 220 total. Vanier shot 224
despite a 102 degree fever,
Baskins had 227, Robertson shot
229, and Trompas fired 233.
