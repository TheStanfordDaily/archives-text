### DAVID ANTONUCCIO 
The Stanford varsity tennis
team impressively downed
Pepperdine 7-2 Wednesday
afternoon in anticipation of
today's home match at 2:00 p.m.
against the University of
California at Irvine.
Victories were recorded by
Chico Hagey, Chip Fisher, Rick
Evans, Mac Claflin, and John
Wright in singles competition.
Evans and Claflin along with Tim
Noonan and Wright were the
victorious doubles combinations.
Roscoe Tanner and Alex
Mayer, who have already
solidified the number one and two
spots on the team, sat out
Wednesday's contest to give less
experienced players some playing
time. Four other netmen dueled
for positions on the Stanford
tennis ladder and could not take
part in the match.
"I was very satisfied with the
win over Pepperdine. The guys
played well and I have complete
confidence in all of them,"
commented tennis mentor Dick
Gould.
Today's battle with the Irvine
Anteaters will be slightly more
challenging than previous
matches. Even Stanford
strokemaster Roscoe Tanner will
have his work cut out for him.
The last time the Indians tangled
with the Anteaters, Tanner had to
wait until the final set before
downing Irvine's current number
one man 6-3.

"Irvine will probably be the futile fight.
