# Johnson's Homer Edges Lobos
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Centerfielder Glen Johnson,
who entered the game in the
seventh inning as a defensive
replacement, cracked a pitch 410
feet into left field for a ninth
inning homerun, handing Stanford
a 7-6 victory over the University
of New Mexico yesterday at the
Sunken Diamond.
Johnson came into the ball
game in the top of the seventh,

replacing Tom Williams for
defensive purposes. But he turned
into a potent offensive weapon
when hy led off the final inning
and hit the fourth pitch of Lobo
Arnie Marzullo over the fence.
It was the first game for
Stanford since the Indians
returned earlier this week from
winning the Riverside
Tournament last weekend
Johnson's homerun boosted his
team's record to 22-6-1, and
dropped UNM, second only to
Arizona State in the Western
Athletic Conference, to 19-7.
About 200 fans came out in
the sunny weather to watch
undefeated pitcher Dan Shaw
(7-0) dual with Lobo Marzullo.
But the game never belonged to
the pitchers—UNM opened up
with three runs aiiu four hits in
the top of the first inning, and
Stanford countered with five runs
and five hits in the bottom of the
frame.
The Lobos started off when
centerfielder Dennis Mernick,
leading off the game, hit a
grounder to deep short that
freshman Joe Lamoure, starting
his third game, couldn't handle
quickly enough. Third baseman
Henry Garcia followed with a long
shot down the right field line that

left him on first and Mernick on
third. Mernick scored when third
baseman Ron Adair grounded out.
Rightfielder Dan Fitzgerald
singled Garcia in, and moved to
second when Stanford rightfielder
Mike Nelson tried to catch Garcia
at the plate. The next batter,
catcher Gary Stewart, singled
Fitzgerald home to wind up the
New Mexico scoring.
Stanford Rally
Stanford struck back almost
immediately. Third baseman
Mickey Aguirre singled solidly to
center, and one out later
Ail-American leftfielder Rod
Boone got a hold of a pitch and
drove it over the 335-foot sign
hanging on the left field fence.
Boone's blast, his seventh
homer of the year, was followed
by a single by Mark Lucich,
Indian second baseman. Lucich
stole second, went onto third
when the throw was bad, and
scored on Nelson's single. Catcher
Bob Reece, who made second
base on an error and a stolen base,
also came in when Nelson hit his
drive to center.
Nelson himself stole second
and scored moments later when
Lamoure singled.
Things went quietly—although
Stanford did rap three more base

hits-until the fourth, when UNM
got another run. Stewart made
first on a fielder's choice, went to
second on a groundout, and came
in on a single by leftfielder Jim
Surber. The Indians got it right
back in the bottom of the inning
on an infield single by Rod
Boone, an error, and a single by
Lucich.
The Lobos set the stage for the
dramatic ninth inning by scoring
twice in the top of the sixth.
Fitzgerald and Stewart hit
back-to-back singles, and
Fitzgerald scored when shortstop
Bill Smith smacked a groundball
through the drawn-up infield that
went for a single. Stewart scored
when Surber hit a slow roller that
Stanford tried—and failed—to turn
into a double play.
Shaw didn't have much on the
ball all day, giving up 12 hits and
five earned runs to New Mexico.
The win went to Mike Higgins,
3-1, who came in to pitch the
ninth. Marzullo slipped to 5-2 for
the Lobos.
The Indians take on Stanislaus
State this afternoon at 2:30 at the
Sunken Diamond.
