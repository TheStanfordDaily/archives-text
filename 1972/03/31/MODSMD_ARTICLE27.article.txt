The Stanford hockey team
after leading through the first two
periods couldn't stop the Belmont
offense as the Oaks triumphed last
Tuesday night at Belmont, 7-4.
Stanford jumped out in front
as Will Mcllvaine stuffed in the
rebound of linemate Paul

Tittmann's shot. A little more
than two minutes later, the Cards
struck again. An errant clearing
pass in the Belmont zone was
taken by Stanford defenseman
Chris Counihan. His shot
deflected into the net off a
Belmont defenseman and
Stanford was ahead, 2-0.
However, the Card defense
faltered momentarily and
Belmont made it 2-1. Each team
scored once again before thee id
of the second period.
MacAusland tipped in Cunji
Makatsu's shot from the point.
But the Oaks rallied, scoring on an
expert passing play in the Cards
end. At the end of two periods
the Cards were still hanging oi r ,o
the lead 3-2.
Belmont began their comeback
when they tied the score at 7:15
of the final frame. They took the
lead two minutes later only to see
Will Mcllvaine score his second of
the night for Stanford. Yet only a
minute later, Belmont tallied on
another slick passing play to take
a lead they wouldn't relinquish.
After scoring an insurance tally
Belmont shot into an empty net
as Stanford had pulled its
goalie for an extra skater.
Though the quality of hockey
was good, there were many
penalties and cheap shots. The
Cards seemed to be better
tempered than Belmont but spent
more time in the penalty box and
had one player thrown out on
what some Stanford partisans
considered a questionable call.
The Cards play Belmont again
on Tuesday at Belmont. The
Cards must win or hang up their
skates until October. If they win
that game they must play
Belmont again, with the winner to
face the Berkeley Juniors for the
title. Tuesday's game starts at
8:00.
