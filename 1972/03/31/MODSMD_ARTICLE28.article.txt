Faculty Radical Supported
SAN DIEGO — A radical young economics instructor
whose teaching job at San Diego State College has been up
in the air for more than three months was recommended
for reappointment Wednesday by a faculty grievance
committee.
The committee began investigating the case of Asst.
Prof. Peter G. Bohmer about four weeks ago at the
instruction of state colleges chancellor Glenn S. Dumke,
who refused at that time to accept the rehiring
recommendation of acting college president Donald E.
Walker.
Walker, who decided last Dec. 17 not to rehire Bohmer
because of pending unprofessional conduct charges against
him, said Feb. 22 he would reappoint Bohmer because he
had been cleared of the allegations by a hearing officer
and by an independent committee from the American
Association of University Professors.
It was then that Dumke stepped in and said he would
make the final decision after the faculty grievance
committee had submitted its findings.
Fireworks Plant Explodes
BRIDGEWATER, Mass. - At least three persons were
killed and 11 others injured Thursday when a series of
explosions leveled buildings and ignited fires at a
fireworks manufacturing plant.
Three bodies were removed from the charred rubble of
Interstate Pyrotechnics Inc., about five hours after the
initial blast. None of the injured was reported in serious
condition.
Bridgewater Deputy Fire Chief Arthur Joyce said a
# building near the center of the nearly four acre complex
exploded first, touching off blasts in other structures.
The force of the blast was felt 10 miles from the blast
site.
Pollution Control Urged
LOS ANGELES — Environmental Protection Agency
administrator William Ruckelshaus said yesterday that
cleansing the nation's environment of pollution could
force closure of 200 to 300 industrial plants by 1976.
The nation's top pollution fighter, speaking to an
environmental seminar here, said as many as 125,000
workers might lose their jobs as a result of enforcing
pollution controls, many in smaller communities where
the economic impact would be severe.
Ruckelshaus discussed the contents of 12 federal
studies released here that were conducted for the EPA,
Department of Commerce and the President's Council on
Environmental Quality.
Irish Bombing Continues
BELFAST — Guerrilla extremists mounted bomb and
gunfire attacks in Northern Ireland yesterday, killing a
British army explosives expert and a woman bystander.
Two dozen civilians were wounded.
The new wave of violence erupted on the day the
British Parliament legalized its takeover of the province
and ordered in an extra 600 troops amid fears of Easter
fighting.
The outlawed Irish Republican Army set off a wave of
explosions from bombs planted in parked cars in three
cities, virtually ruling out last weekend's talk of an armed
truce during the British takeover.

Gun battles between British army troops and terrorist
snipers broke out in Belfast and in the border town of
Belleek, 90 miles to the west.
Catholics in the north were reported planning massive
marches in defiance of provincial security regulations.
This stirred fears of clashes with Protestants, furious over
the British takeover.
Jurors Get Boyle Case
WASHINGTON — The federal jury considering charges of
illegal spending of union funds on political contributions
against United Mine Workers President W.A. "Tony"
Boyle was sent home last night without having reached a
verdict.
The jury will resume deliberations at 9 a.m. this
morning.
Boyle, union secretary-treasurer, John Owens and
director James Kmetz of the union's political branch are
defendants in the case.
The government has charged that the money belonged
to the union's general treasury and was transferred to the
account of the league. Contributions of union money to
political campaigns are illegal.
Shootout Survivors Testify
SAN JOSE — Three women survivors of the San Rafael
courthouse shootout testified yesterday at the Angela
Davis trial and only one of them linked the violence to a
demand for the release of three convicts known as the
Soledad Brothers.
The witness who did testify about such a link, Maria
Graham, 50, conceded that her testimony may have been
influenced by the prosecution.
Graham, after some two hours of cross-examiniation
by defense attorney Howard Moore, Jr., broke down and
said perhaps the prosecutor had encouraged her to recall
shouts of "Free the Soledad Brothers" during the hours
she was held hostage.
Graham was the state's first witness in the 28-year-old
black Communist's murder-kidnap-conspiracy trial, which
opened Monday.
Graham and the two women who followed her to the
stand had been jurors in Superior Court Judge Harold
Haley's court the day the violence erupted.
Berrigan Jury Deliberates
HARRISBURG, Pa. — A federal jury which began
deliberations yesterday on conspiracy charges against the
Rev. Philip Berrigan and six others retired for the night
after seven hours without reaching a verdict.
The government charge? I"hat the defendants plotted to
kidnap presidential aide Henry Kissinger and blow up
government property.
This morning they will hear a re-reading of the court's
instructions on the conspiracy law before resuming
deliberations.
The seven defendants were charged with an escalating
conspiracy-draft board raids to recruit followers, followed
by a plot to blow up Washington's tunnel heating system
and finally the planned abduction of Kissinger, the White
House national security adviser.
The aim, the government said, was to call antiwar and
antigovernment views to the attention of the public.
The name of FBI informant Boyd F. Douglas Jr. went
into the record at the very outset of the trial.
Besides Douglas, the government presented 63 other
witnesses before resting its case one week ago. The
following day, the defense rested without calling any
witnesses.

HARRISBURG, Pa. — A federal jury which began
deliberations yesterday on conspiracy charges against the
Rev. Philip Berrigan and six others retired for the night

The government charge? I"hat the defendants plotted to
kidnap presidential aide Henry Kissinger and blow up
government property.
This morning they will hear a re-reading of the court's
instructions on the conspiracy law before resuming

SAN DIEGO — A radical young economics instructor
whose teaching job at San Diego State College has been up
in the air for more than three months was recommended
for reappointment Wednesday by a faculty grievance
committee.
The committee began investigating the case of Asst.
Prof. Peter G. Bohmer about four weeks ago at the
instruction of state colleges chancellor Glenn S. Dumke,
who refused at that time to accept the rehiring
recommendation of acting college president Donald E.
Walker.
Walker, who decided last Dec. 17 not to rehire Bohmer
because of pending unprofessional conduct charges against
him, said Feb. 22 he would reappoint Bohmer because he
had been cleared of the allegations by a hearing officer
and by an independent committee from the American
Association of University Professors.
It was then that Dumke stepped in and said he would
make the final decision after the faculty grievance
committee had submitted its findings.
Fireworks Plant Explodes
BRIDGEWATER, Mass. - At least three persons were
killed and 11 others injured Thursday when a series of
explosions leveled buildings and ignited fires at a
fireworks manufacturing plant.
Three bodies were removed from the charred rubble of
Interstate Pyrotechnics Inc., about five hours after the
initial blast. None of the injured was reported in serious
condition.
Bridgewater Deputy Fire Chief Arthur Joyce said a
# building near the center of the nearly four acre complex
exploded first, touching off blasts in other structures.
The force of the blast was felt 10 miles from the blast
site.
Pollution Control Urged
LOS ANGELES — Environmental Protection Agency
administrator William Ruckelshaus said yesterday that
cleansing the nation's environment of pollution could
force closure of 200 to 300 industrial plants by 1976.
The nation's top pollution fighter, speaking to an
environmental seminar here, said as many as 125,000
workers might lose their jobs as a result of enforcing
pollution controls, many in smaller communities where
the economic impact would be severe.
Ruckelshaus discussed the contents of 12 federal
studies released here that were conducted for the EPA,
Department of Commerce and the President's Council on
Environmental Quality.
Irish Bombing Continues
BELFAST — Guerrilla extremists mounted bomb and
gunfire attacks in Northern Ireland yesterday, killing a
British army explosives expert and a woman bystander.
Two dozen civilians were wounded.
The new wave of violence erupted on the day the
British Parliament legalized its takeover of the province
and ordered in an extra 600 troops amid fears of Easter
fighting.
The outlawed Irish Republican Army set off a wave of
explosions from bombs planted in parked cars in three
cities, virtually ruling out last weekend's talk of an armed
truce during the British takeover.

Gun battles between British army troops and terrorist
snipers broke out in Belfast and in the border town of
Belleek, 90 miles to the west.
Catholics in the north were reported planning massive
marches in defiance of provincial security regulations.
This stirred fears of clashes with Protestants, furious over
the British takeover.
Jurors Get Boyle Case
WASHINGTON — The federal jury considering charges of
illegal spending of union funds on political contributions
against United Mine Workers President W.A. "Tony"
Boyle was sent home last night without having reached a
verdict.
The jury will resume deliberations at 9 a.m. this
morning.
Boyle, union secretary-treasurer, John Owens and
director James Kmetz of the union's political branch are
defendants in the case.
The government has charged that the money belonged
to the union's general treasury and was transferred to the
account of the league. Contributions of union money to
political campaigns are illegal.
Shootout Survivors Testify
SAN JOSE — Three women survivors of the San Rafael
courthouse shootout testified yesterday at the Angela
Davis trial and only one of them linked the violence to a
demand for the release of three convicts known as the
Soledad Brothers.
The witness who did testify about such a link, Maria
Graham, 50, conceded that her testimony may have been
influenced by the prosecution.
Graham, after some two hours of cross-examiniation
by defense attorney Howard Moore, Jr., broke down and
said perhaps the prosecutor had encouraged her to recall
shouts of "Free the Soledad Brothers" during the hours
she was held hostage.
Graham was the state's first witness in the 28-year-old
black Communist's murder-kidnap-conspiracy trial, which
opened Monday.
Graham and the two women who followed her to the

Shootout Survivors Testify
SAN JOSE — Three women survivors of the San Rafael
courthouse shootout testified yesterday at the Angela
Davis trial and only one of them linked the violence to a
demand for the release of three convicts known as the
Soledad Brothers.
The witness who did testify about such a link, Maria
Graham, 50, conceded that her testimony may have been
influenced by the prosecution.
Graham, after some two hours of cross-examiniation
by defense attorney Howard Moore, Jr., broke down and
said perhaps the prosecutor had encouraged her to recall
shouts of "Free the Soledad Brothers" during the hours
she was held hostage.
Graham was the state's first witness in the 28-year-old
black Communist's murder-kidnap-conspiracy trial, which
opened Monday.
Graham and the two women who followed her to the
stand had been jurors in Superior Court Judge Harold
Haley's court the day the violence erupted.
Berrigan Jury Deliberates
HARRISBURG, Pa. — A federal jury which began
deliberations yesterday on conspiracy charges against the
Rev. Philip Berrigan and six others retired for the night
after seven hours without reaching a verdict.
The government charge? I"hat the defendants plotted to
kidnap presidential aide Henry Kissinger and blow up
government property.
This morning they will hear a re-reading of the court's
instructions on the conspiracy law before resuming
deliberations.
The seven defendants were charged with an escalating
conspiracy-draft board raids to recruit followers, followed
by a plot to blow up Washington's tunnel heating system
and finally the planned abduction of Kissinger, the White
House national security adviser.
The aim, the government said, was to call antiwar and
antigovernment views to the attention of the public.
The name of FBI informant Boyd F. Douglas Jr. went
into the record at the very outset of the trial.
Besides Douglas, the government presented 63 other
witnesses before resting its case one week ago. The
following day, the defense rested without calling any
witnesses.

Faculty Radical Supported
SAN DIEGO — A radical young economics instructor
whose teaching job at San Diego State College has been up
in the air for more than three months was recommended
for reappointment Wednesday by a faculty grievance
committee.
The committee began investigating the case of Asst.
Prof. Peter G. Bohmer about four weeks ago at the
instruction of state colleges chancellor Glenn S. Dumke,
who refused at that time to accept the rehiring
recommendation of acting college president Donald E.
Walker.
Walker, who decided last Dec. 17 not to rehire Bohmer
because of pending unprofessional conduct charges against
him, said Feb. 22 he would reappoint Bohmer because he
had been cleared of the allegations by a hearing officer
and by an independent committee from the American
Association of University Professors.
It was then that Dumke stepped in and said he would
make the final decision after the faculty grievance
committee had submitted its findings.
Fireworks Plant Explodes
BRIDGEWATER, Mass. - At least three persons were
killed and 11 others injured Thursday when a series of
explosions leveled buildings and ignited fires at a
fireworks manufacturing plant.
Three bodies were removed from the charred rubble of
Interstate Pyrotechnics Inc., about five hours after the
initial blast. None of the injured was reported in serious
condition.
Bridgewater Deputy Fire Chief Arthur Joyce said a
# building near the center of the nearly four acre complex
exploded first, touching off blasts in other structures.
The force of the blast was felt 10 miles from the blast
site.
Pollution Control Urged
LOS ANGELES — Environmental Protection Agency
administrator William Ruckelshaus said yesterday that
cleansing the nation's environment of pollution could
force closure of 200 to 300 industrial plants by 1976.
The nation's top pollution fighter, speaking to an
environmental seminar here, said as many as 125,000
workers might lose their jobs as a result of enforcing
pollution controls, many in smaller communities where
the economic impact would be severe.
Ruckelshaus discussed the contents of 12 federal
studies released here that were conducted for the EPA,
Department of Commerce and the President's Council on
Environmental Quality.
Irish Bombing Continues
BELFAST — Guerrilla extremists mounted bomb and
gunfire attacks in Northern Ireland yesterday, killing a
British army explosives expert and a woman bystander.
Two dozen civilians were wounded.
The new wave of violence erupted on the day the
British Parliament legalized its takeover of the province
and ordered in an extra 600 troops amid fears of Easter
fighting.
The outlawed Irish Republican Army set off a wave of
explosions from bombs planted in parked cars in three
cities, virtually ruling out last weekend's talk of an armed
truce during the British takeover.

Gun battles between British army troops and terrorist
snipers broke out in Belfast and in the border town of
Belleek, 90 miles to the west.
Catholics in the north were reported planning massive
marches in defiance of provincial security regulations.
This stirred fears of clashes with Protestants, furious over
the British takeover.
