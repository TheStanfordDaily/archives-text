# Faculty Debates Discipline
## 
### PATTY FELS 
Discussion of the controversial
faculty self-discipline issue began yes
terday at the first spring quarter
meeting of the Faculty Senate.
The Faculty Self-Discipline State
ment, a report of the floor manage
ment committee, lists seven categories
of faculty misconduct. It also recom
mends that trials be held by a Hearing
Officer before being considered by the
Advisory Board. The Board's decision
would be final in most cases.
Yesterday's debate was to deter
mine the feelings of the faculty on the
statement which will eventually be
returned to the committee for revi
sions. Discussion centered around the
vagueness of terms such as "profes
sional misconduct" and "University
property."
Representatives of the committee
emphasized that the proposal does not
mean that any action falling within the
seven categories will be punishable. It
says only that nothing falling outside
can be classified as misbehavior.
The committee also stated that the
vagueness of the proposal is inten
tional since it is impossible to
construct a criminal code listing every
violation for which a teacher can be
sanctioned. However, they feel that

the new policy is more explicit than
the former tenure statement.
The Senate became a "committee
of the whole" to consider the issue.
Professor Donald Kennedy moved that
while in the committee no quotations
could be attributed to specific profes
sors or paraphrased. The motion
passed almost unanimously.

President Richard Lyman was not
present at the meeting since he is in
Washington on business.
The Senate also conducted a
lengthy debate on foreign language
requirements at overseas campuses.
Discussion of the self-discipline
issue will continue at next week's
meeting.
