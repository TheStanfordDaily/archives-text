# Second Placement Hearing
## Defense Testimony Challenged 
### JIM WASCHER 
The Administration moved to strike
the testimony of the first defense
witness in the Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) hearing for a fifth person
charged with violation of the Policy on
Campus Disruption for the November
4 "mill-in" at the Placement Center.
Stanford Rehabilitation Movement
(SRM) member Don Zweig, a sopho
more, has been charged with disrupt
ing the interview of Duane Linsen
bardt with a representative of TRW
Corporation. The hearing began yester
day.
Kari Collins, the defense's first
witness, said Zweig wasn't "ever in the
room" where the disruption took
place. Collins added that she, along
with the four students suspended for
the disruption, were in the room.
When Collins refused to say why
she entered Room F, Special Assistant
to the President John Schwartz moved
that all of her testimony be stricken
from the record. He pointed out that
her not answering the question made
investigation of the "credibility and
veracity of her testimony" ah but
impossible.
Not A Game
Schwartz emphasized that "the
University doesn't consider these pro
ceedings as a game." Hearing Officer
Stephen Tennis said he would take the

motion under advisement and an
nounce his ruling along with his report
of the findings of fact in the case.
Earlier this month, four other
students were suspended for three
quarters for the same disruption. The
four are Don Lee, Steve Downey, Paul
Loeb and Pete Knutson. The defense
said they were "mystified" at the time
separation between the two cases.
Schwartz aided his secretary, Carole
Price, in prosecuting Zweig. Their first
witness was Stanford Public Safety
Department Photographer Luther
Long.
Long identified two pictures he had
taken of Zweig inside Room F of the
Placement Center during the interview
interruption. Long also testified that
the protesters in Room F "remained
quiet" and were not violent to
"property or persons."
Facts In Evidence
After Long's testimony had been
concluded, Price moved that the vast
majority of the findings of fact from
the previous Placement Center hearing
be entered into evidence. That motion
was accepted by Tennis.
Tennis is an attorney with the San
Francisco firm of Howard, Prim, Rice,
Nemerovski, Canady and Pollak.
Linsenbardt was the second prose
cution witness. He identified a picture
of Zweig, whom he said was in Room

F during the time he wished to carry
on his interview.
In an attempt to impeach Linsen
bardt's testimony, the defense ques
tioned him about the Durand Defense
Collective, which he said was a group
of electrical engineering students who
set up a walkie-talkie network around
electrical engineering buildings during
campus disturbances.
None of the other prosecution
witnesses could make a positive
identification of Zweig. They were:

Placement Center Director Ralph Kel
ler, Public Safety Department Director
Marvin Herrington, and Public Safety
Department photographer Nick Bru
not.
The second defense witness, Pete
Knutson, said that Zweig advised
against going into Room F and that he
did not recall Zweig entering the
room.
The hearing will resume at 9 a.m.
tomorrow in Room 83 of the Graduate
School of Business (GSB).

The Administration moved to strike
the testimony of the first defense
witness in the Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) hearing for a fifth person
charged with violation of the Policy on
Campus Disruption for the November
4 "mill-in" at the Placement Center.
Stanford Rehabilitation Movement
(SRM) member Don Zweig, a sopho
more, has been charged with disrupt
ing the interview of Duane Linsen
bardt with a representative of TRW
Corporation. The hearing began yester
day.
Kari Collins, the defense's first
witness, said Zweig wasn't "ever in the
room" where the disruption took
place. Collins added that she, along
with the four students suspended for
the disruption, were in the room.
When Collins refused to say why
she entered Room F, Special Assistant
to the President John Schwartz moved
that all of her testimony be stricken
from the record. He pointed out that
her not answering the question made
investigation of the "credibility and
veracity of her testimony" ah but
impossible.
Not A Game
Schwartz emphasized that "the
University doesn't consider these pro
ceedings as a game." Hearing Officer
Stephen Tennis said he would take the

motion under advisement and an
nounce his ruling along with his report
of the findings of fact in the case.
Earlier this month, four other
students were suspended for three
quarters for the same disruption. The
four are Don Lee, Steve Downey, Paul
Loeb and Pete Knutson. The defense
said they were "mystified" at the time
separation between the two cases.
Schwartz aided his secretary, Carole
Price, in prosecuting Zweig. Their first
witness was Stanford Public Safety
Department Photographer Luther
Long.
Long identified two pictures he had
taken of Zweig inside Room F of the
Placement Center during the interview
interruption. Long also testified that
the protesters in Room F "remained
quiet" and were not violent to
"property or persons."
Facts In Evidence
After Long's testimony had been
concluded, Price moved that the vast
majority of the findings of fact from
the previous Placement Center hearing
be entered into evidence. That motion
was accepted by Tennis.
Tennis is an attorney with the San
Francisco firm of Howard, Prim, Rice,
Nemerovski, Canady and Pollak.
Linsenbardt was the second prose
cution witness. He identified a picture
of Zweig, whom he said was in Room

F during the time he wished to carry
on his interview.
In an attempt to impeach Linsen
bardt's testimony, the defense ques
tioned him about the Durand Defense
Collective, which he said was a group
of electrical engineering students who
set up a walkie-talkie network around
electrical engineering buildings during
campus disturbances.
None of the other prosecution
witnesses could make a positive
identification of Zweig. They were:

Placement Center Director Ralph Kel
ler, Public Safety Department Director
Marvin Herrington, and Public Safety
Department photographer Nick Bru
not.
The second defense witness, Pete
Knutson, said that Zweig advised
against going into Room F and that he
did not recall Zweig entering the
room.
The hearing will resume at 9 a.m.
tomorrow in Room 83 of the Graduate
School of Business (GSB).
