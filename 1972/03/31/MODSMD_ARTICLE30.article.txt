# McCloskey To Visit Here

### 
Congressman and former presiden
tial candidate Paul N. (Pete) McClos
key (R —Portola Valley) hits the
Stanford trail in sear 'i of votes
Monday.
McCloskey plans to spend all day
Monday at Stanford in attempts to
round up votes for his Republican
primary battle for the 17th Congres
sional district.
Facing a tough fight in a newly
formed congressional district which
includes only one-fifth of his old
district, McCloskey is basing many of
his hopes on getting liberal republicans
to vote for him in the primary.
Bill Johnson, coordinator of Mc-
Closkey's schedule Monday, says
McCloskey is coming to Stanford "to
get people to change the Republican
party" and to get "people to reregis
ter" Republican. He is also recruiting
student help for his campaign. McClos
key "is going to face a difficult
challenge in the primary—one in which
he is going to need as much help as he

can," according to Johnson.
McCloskey is scheduled to talk to
students in White Plaza before noon,
meet with several small groups, and
meet with students in Branner Hall,
Rinconada House, Faisan House and
the Theta Delta Chi Fraternity before
finishing his one day canvass of the
Stanford campus at 8 p.m.
McCloskey had challenged Presi
dent Richard Nixon in New
Hampshire for the Republican Presi
dential nomination but dropped out of
the race after receiving 20 percent of
the vote.
Congressional redisricting divided
up his old district and he decided to
run in the new district—which includes
all of Stanford and most of Palo
Alto—although it included only about
50,000 voters from his last district.
Dr. Royce M. Cole, member of the
Palo Alto school board, and former
New York Congressman Robert Barry
of Woodside are challenging McClos
key in the primary.
