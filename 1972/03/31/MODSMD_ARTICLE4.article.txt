# Hospital Starts Blood Bank, Red Cross Shares In Effort
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
The Stanford Hospital is opening a
new blood bank and blood research
center in Palo Alto this July with the
help of the Red Cross. The Center will
give modern support to many kinds of
special treatment and operations being
done at the Medical Center.
But this change has caused some
concern over the effect on the
hospital's main supplier of blood, a
community-run organization based in
Burlingame. This bank, the Peninsula
Memorial Blood Bank, now gives
Stanford about 50 percent of its
requirements for blood and blood
components.
The new Red Cross blood bank in
Palo Alto is being designed to fill
about half of Stanford's needs in the
near future. At present the Red Cross

is only responsible for about one-tenth
of the blood Stanford gets.
From the point of view of the Red
Cross, coming to Stanford is an
opportunity to be connected with one
of the best research hospitals in the
area, with a benefit of sharing in its
research work.
According to Dr. Donald Avoy,
medical director of the Red Cross
blood bank in San Jose, "We hope to
become a part of the whole Stanford
community in research and teaching."
The Palo Alto bank will be a satellite
branch of the San Jose facility.
Avoy said that in recent years there
was a "realization that the Red Cross
has to update and upgrade through
association with major medical
schools."
He added that the National Red
Cross is also spending more in helping
to improve blood banking technology.
This ties in well with Stanford's
often specialized blood needs,
necessary when treating hemophiliacs,
for example, or certain other
malignant diseases.
Facing the needs of a heavily
research-oriented hospital such as
Stanford's, the community-run
Peninsula Blood Bank, with few funds
for research, found itself unable to
take part in the new project.
George McQueen, a secretary of
Peninsula, was slightly disappointed by
the shift and commented wryly of
Stanford's move, "They go into it
[blood banking] in a big way."
Peninsula did not have the money to
take part in the research Stanford
wanted, he said.
McQueen who does public relations
work for the bank believed the change
was not necessary, but said, "we've
been doing a good job and we think
we'll continue" to serve Stanford. He
said Peninsula already is serving seven

other hospitals in the area.
John Williams, associate director of
the Stanford Hospital for patient care
services, stated the "demand for blood
will be less" from Peninsula but
Stanford will continue to use the
facility heavily.
Peninsula had "known for two and
one-half years" about Stanford's desire
for a more advanced blood banking
facility nearby in Palo Alto, according
to Williams.
But Peninsula was not interested,
he said, because it "did not see the
value of the program" of the kind
which the Red Cross is now going to
set up.
In addition, according to Dr.
Stanley Schrier, head of the
hematology division at the Medical
School, the reninsuia Biooa Bank was
unable to supply the "extraordinary
needs" for blood products at Stanford.
For example, Stanford had been
producing about 30 percent of its
blood components on its own, Schrier
said.
When the blood center is in full
operation, research will be done in the
related fields of tissue-typing,
coagulation, and immunotherapy, too.
An advanced method of processing
frozen blood, used by the Red Cross,
will be started during the first year of
the Palo Alto center's operation,
allowing rare types of blood to be
stored.
There is also some competition
between the two blood banks, two of
the three largest between San
Francisco and San Jose, in an area
both feel they have a right to
administer.
Peninsula will be opening an
auxiliary blood-drawing center in Palo
Alto, open Wednesday afternoons, to
serve groups in the nearby area.
