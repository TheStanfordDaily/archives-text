## Privacy, Taxes, Drugs, & Subsidies 
### 
Contraceptives
On March 22, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 4-to-3 decision, found
that a Massachusetts statute under which terms of up to five years
imprisonment could be imposed on persons who sold or gave birth
control devices to unmarried persons was unconstitutional.
In the majority opinion, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., wrote: "If
the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual,
married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion
into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision
whether to bear or beget a child."
Income Taxation
The April 1972 issue of Ramparts contains an interesting article
entitled "How to Cheat on Your Income Tax: A Guide." The author
points out that the Internal Revenue Service's major concern is
concealed income. "Rarely does the IRS lunge for the jugular of the
little person who tries to inflate deductions." But there is an art to
inflating deductions so that they still appear "reasonable" and thus
escape detection by the IRS's computers.
Elsewhere in the same issue there is some debunking of the
National Debt myth that "we owe it to ourselves." Robert Fitch
recalls that "for fiscal '72, Nixon plans to come in about $25 billion
overweight—this following an unplanned deficit of $38.8 billion in
fiscal '71. And a mind-bending total of nearly $90 billion in deficits
since the President assumed office in 1969."
As with all policy matters, it is important here to ask: Who is doing
things to whom? It turns out that the commercial banks and the very
rich are fleecing the taxpayer. As Fitch puts it, "Commercial banks
and rich folk reap this $22 billion harvest, it should be remembered
without risking anything. The chance of the government defaulting on
its bonds is about the same as the likelihood of the Weatherpeople
seizing state power in fiscal '73."
The policy which the government usually adopts to deal with
expenditures which exceed the booty on hand from taxes and
consequently necessitate going into debt is either increasing the tax
burden or printing more paper money (which is actually a way of
taxing people on fixed incomes, by inflating the money supply).
Neither of these policies offers relief to the taxpayer. The only way

out of all this which does not entail further spoilation of the taxpayer
is repudiation of the national debt.
A Right To Take Drugs
In the April 1972 Harper's, Dr. Thomas S. Szasz, professor of
psychiatry at the State University of New York Upstate Medical
Center, asks: "If ingesting alcohol ... is ... a Constitutional right, is
ingesting opium, or heroin, or barbituates, or anything else, not also
such a right?"
Dr. Szasz argues that while the use of drugs is always described as a
medical and pharmacological problem, in fact it is a political
prohibition by some people of the non-aggressive behavior of other
people.
While my ethical position differs from Dr. Szasz's, my political
position on this issue I: almost exactly the same. I hold tht one owes
it to one's self not to misuse certain drugs, and that correct usage
(which may be non-usage) of these drugs is a necessary ingredient in
living a good life. Dr. Szasz believes that "we ought to know that
there is no necessary connection between facts and values, between
what is and what ought to be."
The important point in the present matter is that non-aggressive
behavior on the part of the human beings gathered together in society
is a necessary condition for the exercise of free will and the effort of
individuals to live a self-examined life. But, one could in fact live a
good life in a society in which other people committed suicide by
taking overdoses of sleeping pills, had the habit of injecting heroin
into their bloodstream, or smoked marijuana. Dr. Szasz would agree
with this political position.
He writes: "I want to make it clear that in my view, regardless of
their danger, all drugs should be 'legalized' (a misleading term I
employ reluctantly as a concession to popular usage). Although I
recognize that some drugs—notably heroin, the amphetamines, and
LSD, among those now in vogue—may have undesirable or dangerous
consequences, 1 favor free trade in drugs for the same reason the
Founding Fathers favored free trade in ideas. In an open society, it is
none of the government's business what idea a man puts into his
mind; likewise, it should be none of the government's business what
drug he puts into his body."
Dr. Szasz argues that "it is absurd to deprive an adult of a drug (or
anything else) because he might use it to kill himelf" for "every
individual is capable of injuring or killing himself. This potentiality is
a fundamental expression of human freedom."
John Stuart Mill's prescription for a libertarian polity is cited by
Dr. Szasz as the axiom to be applied in considering the drug question.
Mill wrote in his essay On Liberty:
"The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised
over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to
prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not
a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or
forbear because it will make him happier, (or) because in the opinions
of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. ... In the part (of his
conduct) which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right,
absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is
sovereign."
Because he, like Mill, is opposed to aggressive violence, Dr. Szasz is
careful to note that "the right to self-medication must. . . entail
unqualified responsibility for the effects of one's drug-intoxicated
behavior on others.
Who's Subsidizing Whom?
The March 1972 Washington Monthly contained a lengthy review
by Taylor Branch of a Joint Economic Committee study of Federal
subsidies during fiscal year 1970. Branch's review is entitled, "The
Screwing of the Average Man."
According to the study the agricultural subsidy structure doles out
$5 billion a year directly. "In addition to these payments, federal crop
limitations have the effect of raising all crop prices about 15 percent
above the market level. This costs people who don't grow their own
food about $4.5 billion annually—so that the combined payment and
control programs for agriculture take about $10 billion to the farm
each year." (The wealthiest 19 per cent of farm families obtain 62.8
per cent of this subsidy from the taxpayer and food-buyer.)

Income Taxation
The April 1972 issue of Ramparts contains an interesting article
entitled "How to Cheat on Your Income Tax: A Guide." The author
points out that the Internal Revenue Service's major concern is
concealed income. "Rarely does the IRS lunge for the jugular of the
little person who tries to inflate deductions." But there is an art to
inflating deductions so that they still appear "reasonable" and thus
escape detection by the IRS's computers.
Elsewhere in the same issue there is some debunking of the
National Debt myth that "we owe it to ourselves." Robert Fitch
recalls that "for fiscal '72, Nixon plans to come in about $25 billion
overweight—this following an unplanned deficit of $38.8 billion in
fiscal '71. And a mind-bending total of nearly $90 billion in deficits
since the President assumed office in 1969."
As with all policy matters, it is important here to ask: Who is doing
things to whom? It turns out that the commercial banks and the very
rich are fleecing the taxpayer. As Fitch puts it, "Commercial banks
and rich folk reap this $22 billion harvest, it should be remembered
without risking anything. The chance of the government defaulting on
its bonds is about the same as the likelihood of the Weatherpeople
seizing state power in fiscal '73."
The policy which the government usually adopts to deal with
expenditures which exceed the booty on hand from taxes and
consequently necessitate going into debt is either increasing the tax
burden or printing more paper money (which is actually a way of
taxing people on fixed incomes, by inflating the money supply).
Neither of these policies offers relief to the taxpayer. The only way

out of all this which does not entail further spoilation of the taxpayer
is repudiation of the national debt.
A Right To Take Drugs
In the April 1972 Harper's, Dr. Thomas S. Szasz, professor of
psychiatry at the State University of New York Upstate Medical
Center, asks: "If ingesting alcohol ... is ... a Constitutional right, is
ingesting opium, or heroin, or barbituates, or anything else, not also
such a right?"
Dr. Szasz argues that while the use of drugs is always described as a
medical and pharmacological problem, in fact it is a political
prohibition by some people of the non-aggressive behavior of other
people.
While my ethical position differs from Dr. Szasz's, my political
position on this issue I: almost exactly the same. I hold tht one owes
it to one's self not to misuse certain drugs, and that correct usage
(which may be non-usage) of these drugs is a necessary ingredient in
living a good life. Dr. Szasz believes that "we ought to know that
there is no necessary connection between facts and values, between
what is and what ought to be."
The important point in the present matter is that non-aggressive
behavior on the part of the human beings gathered together in society
is a necessary condition for the exercise of free will and the effort of
individuals to live a self-examined life. But, one could in fact live a
good life in a society in which other people committed suicide by
taking overdoses of sleeping pills, had the habit of injecting heroin
into their bloodstream, or smoked marijuana. Dr. Szasz would agree
with this political position.
He writes: "I want to make it clear that in my view, regardless of
their danger, all drugs should be 'legalized' (a misleading term I
employ reluctantly as a concession to popular usage). Although I
recognize that some drugs—notably heroin, the amphetamines, and
LSD, among those now in vogue—may have undesirable or dangerous
consequences, 1 favor free trade in drugs for the same reason the
Founding Fathers favored free trade in ideas. In an open society, it is
none of the government's business what idea a man puts into his
mind; likewise, it should be none of the government's business what
drug he puts into his body."
Dr. Szasz argues that "it is absurd to deprive an adult of a drug (or
anything else) because he might use it to kill himelf" for "every
individual is capable of injuring or killing himself. This potentiality is
a fundamental expression of human freedom."
John Stuart Mill's prescription for a libertarian polity is cited by
Dr. Szasz as the axiom to be applied in considering the drug question.
Mill wrote in his essay On Liberty:
"The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised
over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to
prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not
a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or
forbear because it will make him happier, (or) because in the opinions
of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. ... In the part (of his
conduct) which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right,
absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is
sovereign."
Because he, like Mill, is opposed to aggressive violence, Dr. Szasz is
careful to note that "the right to self-medication must. . . entail
unqualified responsibility for the effects of one's drug-intoxicated
behavior on others.
Who's Subsidizing Whom?
The March 1972 Washington Monthly contained a lengthy review
by Taylor Branch of a Joint Economic Committee study of Federal
subsidies during fiscal year 1970. Branch's review is entitled, "The
Screwing of the Average Man."
According to the study the agricultural subsidy structure doles out
$5 billion a year directly. "In addition to these payments, federal crop
limitations have the effect of raising all crop prices about 15 percent
above the market level. This costs people who don't grow their own
food about $4.5 billion annually—so that the combined payment and
control programs for agriculture take about $10 billion to the farm
each year." (The wealthiest 19 per cent of farm families obtain 62.8
per cent of this subsidy from the taxpayer and food-buyer.)

Contraceptives
On March 22, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 4-to-3 decision, found
that a Massachusetts statute under which terms of up to five years
imprisonment could be imposed on persons who sold or gave birth
control devices to unmarried persons was unconstitutional.
In the majority opinion, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., wrote: "If

concealed income. "Rarely does the IRS lunge for the jugular of the
little person who tries to inflate deductions." But there is an art to
inflating deductions so that they still appear "reasonable" and thus
escape detection by the IRS's computers.
Elsewhere in the same issue there is some debunking of the
National Debt myth that "we owe it to ourselves." Robert Fitch
recalls that "for fiscal '72, Nixon plans to come in about $25 billion
overweight—this following an unplanned deficit of $38.8 billion in
fiscal '71. And a mind-bending total of nearly $90 billion in deficits
since the President assumed office in 1969."
As with all policy matters, it is important here to ask: Who is doing
things to whom? It turns out that the commercial banks and the very
rich are fleecing the taxpayer. As Fitch puts it, "Commercial banks
and rich folk reap this $22 billion harvest, it should be remembered
without risking anything. The chance of the government defaulting on
its bonds is about the same as the likelihood of the Weatherpeople
seizing state power in fiscal '73."
The policy which the government usually adopts to deal with
expenditures which exceed the booty on hand from taxes and
consequently necessitate going into debt is either increasing the tax
burden or printing more paper money (which is actually a way of
taxing people on fixed incomes, by inflating the money supply).
Neither of these policies offers relief to the taxpayer. The only way

out of all this which does not entail further spoilation of the taxpayer
is repudiation of the national debt.
A Right To Take Drugs
In the April 1972 Harper's, Dr. Thomas S. Szasz, professor of
psychiatry at the State University of New York Upstate Medical
Center, asks: "If ingesting alcohol ... is ... a Constitutional right, is
ingesting opium, or heroin, or barbituates, or anything else, not also
such a right?"
Dr. Szasz argues that while the use of drugs is always described as a
medical and pharmacological problem, in fact it is a political
prohibition by some people of the non-aggressive behavior of other
people.
While my ethical position differs from Dr. Szasz's, my political
position on this issue I: almost exactly the same. I hold tht one owes
it to one's self not to misuse certain drugs, and that correct usage
(which may be non-usage) of these drugs is a necessary ingredient in
living a good life. Dr. Szasz believes that "we ought to know that
there is no necessary connection between facts and values, between
what is and what ought to be."
The important point in the present matter is that non-aggressive
behavior on the part of the human beings gathered together in society
is a necessary condition for the exercise of free will and the effort of
individuals to live a self-examined life. But, one could in fact live a
good life in a society in which other people committed suicide by
taking overdoses of sleeping pills, had the habit of injecting heroin
into their bloodstream, or smoked marijuana. Dr. Szasz would agree
with this political position.
He writes: "I want to make it clear that in my view, regardless of
their danger, all drugs should be 'legalized' (a misleading term I
employ reluctantly as a concession to popular usage). Although I
recognize that some drugs—notably heroin, the amphetamines, and
LSD, among those now in vogue—may have undesirable or dangerous
consequences, 1 favor free trade in drugs for the same reason the
Founding Fathers favored free trade in ideas. In an open society, it is
none of the government's business what idea a man puts into his
mind; likewise, it should be none of the government's business what
drug he puts into his body."
Dr. Szasz argues that "it is absurd to deprive an adult of a drug (or
anything else) because he might use it to kill himelf" for "every
individual is capable of injuring or killing himself. This potentiality is
a fundamental expression of human freedom."
John Stuart Mill's prescription for a libertarian polity is cited by
Dr. Szasz as the axiom to be applied in considering the drug question.
Mill wrote in his essay On Liberty:
"The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised
over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to
prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not
a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or
forbear because it will make him happier, (or) because in the opinions
of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. ... In the part (of his
conduct) which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right,
absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is
sovereign."
Because he, like Mill, is opposed to aggressive violence, Dr. Szasz is
careful to note that "the right to self-medication must. . . entail
unqualified responsibility for the effects of one's drug-intoxicated
behavior on others.
Who's Subsidizing Whom?
The March 1972 Washington Monthly contained a lengthy review
by Taylor Branch of a Joint Economic Committee study of Federal
subsidies during fiscal year 1970. Branch's review is entitled, "The
Screwing of the Average Man."
According to the study the agricultural subsidy structure doles out
$5 billion a year directly. "In addition to these payments, federal crop
limitations have the effect of raising all crop prices about 15 percent
above the market level. This costs people who don't grow their own
food about $4.5 billion annually—so that the combined payment and
control programs for agriculture take about $10 billion to the farm
each year." (The wealthiest 19 per cent of farm families obtain 62.8
per cent of this subsidy from the taxpayer and food-buyer.)

Contraceptives
On March 22, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 4-to-3 decision, found
that a Massachusetts statute under which terms of up to five years
imprisonment could be imposed on persons who sold or gave birth
control devices to unmarried persons was unconstitutional.
In the majority opinion, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., wrote: "If
the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual,
married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion
into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision
whether to bear or beget a child."
Income Taxation
The April 1972 issue of Ramparts contains an interesting article
entitled "How to Cheat on Your Income Tax: A Guide." The author
points out that the Internal Revenue Service's major concern is
concealed income. "Rarely does the IRS lunge for the jugular of the
little person who tries to inflate deductions." But there is an art to
