Indians
(Editor's Note: This letter was
originally sent to President
Lyman.)
Dear Pres. Lyman:
I regret I have not been able to
communicate with you on this
matter at an earlier date, but I
have just returned from Gary,
Indiana and therefore was not
aware of your letter of March 15,
concerning the status of the
Indian symbol until this week.
Upon reading your letter
addressed to the Stanford Buck
Club it is apparent that you have
received an inaccurate picture as
to what the ASSU has established
and what they have not
established. The ASSU has never
established a commission of the
kind described by you to the
Buck Club in your letter of the
15th.
"The ASSU Senate, mindful of
the fact that it was the student
government that had officially
endorsed the Indian symbol in
1930, voted to withdraw
Association endorsement for the
mascot, and established (with our
approval) a nine-member
committee which will review the
Senate's action, the petition from
the students, and the various (and
numerous!) communications
which we have received since the
announcement about the petition
was first made. Public opinion on

the subject, I note, is widely
divided; that division extends to
the several American Indian
organizations from which we've
heard."
We did not establish a review
committee to decide whether or
not the Indian symbol should be
eliminated for it is not our
position and never has been that a
mere committee should have the
power to recommend an action
concerning a .basic question of
racial discrimination. We did
establish, however, a committee
to decide on how best to
implement, not review, the ASSU
Senate's decision to eliminate the
Indian's use as the Stanford
mascot.
Rather than to debate
extensively my interpretation
against another, I have enclosed
the factual documentation as to
what the ASSU Senate established
with regards to a committee
concerning the mascot question;
the documentation not only
describes the committee but also
clearly delineates its charge as a
committee for implementation
and not recommendation.
Therefore, it should be clear
that such a commission is not
going to recommend anything to
your office in regards to whether
or not the Indian symbol should
be eliminated or not. At this
point, it seems to me what is

important is not the nature of the
misunderstanding itself, but the
manner in which the situation
concerning thy mascot is to be
clarified. Therefore, I would
request of you that you send a
copy with an accompanying
statement to all of those persons
and organizations which your
original letter of March 15 was
sent to correcting its inaccuracies.
As you might know, we have
scheduled the meeting with you
for this coming Tuesday
afternoon. At this point, I do not
feel it is necessary because
hopefully this letter has clarified
the situation, at least in reference
to factually what the ASSU has
established and what it has not. If
however, you deem such a
meeting as valuable, I am willing
to discuss this matter further with
you on that date.

Union Question
Editor, THE DAILY:
Sometimes our local-brand of
liberal intellectuals find it nearly
impossible to refrain from leading
their forces through infighting and
old-hat power struggles. The
Union election is a good example
of this.

USE (politically progressive,
liberal) can't seem to bring itself
to support the Teamsters
(politically reactionary,
conservative leadership) in the
Stanford workers struggle to
unionize. Where in this lies the
contradiction? As a good liberal
organization, USE often finds
itself at odds with the more
radical organizations on campus.
In this context they see massive
change (i.e. revolutionary change)
as impossible, impractical and
probably a bit scary. They argue
that most people would never go
for it. Too big a jump you see.
On the other hand, USE takes
an "all or nothing at all" approach
to unionization. That is, they say
that unless the workers are ready
to take the giant step-up to a
politically progressive union
(them), then USE will actively
work against or at least not
support any half-way house
(Teamsters) unionization. They
do this despite the pressing needs
on campus: low-cost housing,
higher wages, decent health and
dental plans, and some type of
protection against indiscriminate
lay-offs.
All these problems cry for
immediate unionization. History
shows where union elections fail
the first time around, it's
sometimes a number of years

before a strong movement can be
resurected. Most people can see
Opportunist-Liberalism when it
springs from the mouth of a
Lyman or Kaplan, but it can rear
its ugly head even from within
progressive ranks.
A United Front is what we
need! It is no empty slogan to say
that united the people can
overcome any obstacle, no matter
how outwardly powerfull it
seems. Anyone involved in the
union election knows how terribly
scared the Administration was
running towards the end. Anyone
this scared can't be too powerfull
or last long. But success depends
on a United Front and immediate
unionization. Vote Teamsters
because anything less is a vote for
the Administration and against
the Stanford Workers.

Perspective
Editor, THE DAILY:
I was very sad to read Steve
Ungar's open letter (Daily, 3/28)
for he seems to be losing both his
sense of humor and his moral
perspective since leaving Stanford.
If recruiting highly trained
technical personnel is not part of
"business" for a corporation, I
don't know what is. If a man of
Mr. Ungar's abilities can think of
no other way to get his next meal
but by working for concerns
whose "social policies, politics
and products" he finds
"disagreeable," our country is in
worse shape that I had thought.
And if the political apathy of
science and engineering students
(with regard to student
government and referenda) is
justified on the basis of the
"juvenile" and "comic opera"
aspects of that government (in
which they do not participate),
what hope does this offer for their
future concern with the political
uses to which their abilities will be
put? If his aim was to justify open
recruiting, he will have to try a lot
harder.
