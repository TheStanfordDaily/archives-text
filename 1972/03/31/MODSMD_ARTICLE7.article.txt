# cjp repression
## Defense Statement 
### 
(Editor's Note: This siait'-nent
ivas •;resented to the Campus
Judicial Panel.)
flic :pirit of the defense all
throughout tiicc hearings has
been one of ; o-nperation,
although we have rJways
considered the CJP to be an
illegitimate body and the charges
to bp false. We have been
consistent with the Hearing
Officer in his maintaining that
these proceedings are not a game,
and because of the serious
consequences to the defendants,
we have all done our utmost to
ensure that there would be justice
done to the case.
However, there is a point at
which co-operation becomes
collaboration. That is the point
when a hearing to determine facts
becomes an opportunity to begin
a witchhunt against all those
persons whom the Administration
wants to eliminate. The
Administration does not seek to
find the facts and bring justice to
this case; its sole objective has
been to utilize these hearings for
an inquisition of all politically
active people. If we co-operated
with the Administration's
investigation any further, we

shock ley defense

would be incriminating our
brothers and sisters in the
struggle.
There is a very important
principle which we cannot
compromise here. And this is the
principle that we will never
endorse political repression, much
less collaborate in the witchhunts
of recent months. Since these
proceedings have refused to make
any provisions against
incriminations, we are forced into
a dilemma: if we want to continue
with an effective defense we must
identify people for the
Administration's witchhunt.
And our answer is this: * r e will
not aid and abet \ Jitical
repression. We cannot abandon
our political principles and
acquiesce to an inquisition in
order for the four defendants to
put up a better legal defense.
The issue here is not the
impartiality or the ability of the
Hearing Officer. We are not
disputing his personal integrity
nor the possibility of fair findings.
But we will not continue to lend
legitimacy to the CJP by our
participation in what is clearly an
inquisition.
We will submit closing
arguments by mail in the next few
days. We cannot see any furhter
purpose in our being here other
than in legitimizing this whole
process.
We call for a moratorium on all
CJP cases until the alternative
judicial system endorsed by the
Student Senate is offered to the
student body in a binding
referendum to be held during the
upcoming Presidential elections.
Finally, we call upon our
brothers and sisters to intensify
this struggle and resist
intimidation, whenever it occurs.

Furumoto, Mel Kennedy, Don

with the Administration's
investigation any further, we

shock ley defense

would be incriminating our
brothers and sisters in the
struggle.
There is a very important
principle which we cannot
compromise here. And this is the
principle that we will never
endorse political repression, much
less collaborate in the witchhunts
of recent months. Since these
proceedings have refused to make
any provisions against
incriminations, we are forced into
a dilemma: if we want to continue
with an effective defense we must
identify people for the
Administration's witchhunt.
And our answer is this: * r e will
not aid and abet \ Jitical
repression. We cannot abandon
our political principles and
acquiesce to an inquisition in
order for the four defendants to
put up a better legal defense.
The issue here is not the
impartiality or the ability of the
Hearing Officer. We are not
disputing his personal integrity
nor the possibility of fair findings.
But we will not continue to lend
legitimacy to the CJP by our
participation in what is clearly an
inquisition.
We will submit closing
arguments by mail in the next few
days. We cannot see any furhter
purpose in our being here other
than in legitimizing this whole
process.
We call for a moratorium on all
CJP cases until the alternative
judicial system endorsed by the
Student Senate is offered to the
student body in a binding
referendum to be held during the
upcoming Presidential elections.
Finally, we call upon our
brothers and sisters to intensify
this struggle and resist
intimidation, whenever it occurs.

flic :pirit of the defense all
throughout tiicc hearings has
been one of ; o-nperation,
although we have rJways
considered the CJP to be an
illegitimate body and the charges
to bp false. We have been
consistent with the Hearing
Officer in his maintaining that
these proceedings are not a game,
and because of the serious
consequences to the defendants,
we have all done our utmost to
ensure that there would be justice
done to the case.
However, there is a point at
which co-operation becomes
collaboration. That is the point
when a hearing to determine facts
becomes an opportunity to begin
a witchhunt against all those
persons whom the Administration
wants to eliminate. The
Administration does not seek to
find the facts and bring justice to
this case; its sole objective has
been to utilize these hearings for
an inquisition of all politically
active people. If we co-operated
with the Administration's
investigation any further, we

would be incriminating our
brothers and sisters in the
