## Clash Of Political Moralities REER NNING AND TEMENT ENTER 
### 
It is with genuine reluctance
that I comment on the CJP
decision in the case of the
Placement Center Four. To
criticize the substance of a
decision implies that in some
manner it might be improved and
rendered acceptable, and in regard
to the CJP this is an erroneous
inference. The manner in which
that body was created (executive
fiat) as well as its mode of
operation (faculty jurisdiction
over students without reciprocity)
render it illegitimate, an agency of
repression. Any opinion it
produces, however well reasoned,
must be considered invalid.
Nevertheless, the placement
center case does involve the
question of the legitimacy of the
Vietnam War and the efforts to
oppose it. As long as that war
continues, and as long as there are
persons on this campus
determined to resist it, similar
cases will surely arise. If this
decision is not refuted, it may
stand as a model for future
judgements. This would be
particularly undesireable as the
decision evades rather than
confronts the fundamental ethical
issues raised by the anti-war
movement at Stanford.
The situation which the CJP
seeks to adjudicate involves a
clash of political moralities on this
campus. Essentially, one code
opposes the Vietnam War and
seeks to end university complicity
in its continuation; the other view
sanctions that war and defends
'the university's role in carrying it
out. The placement center
decision adopts the second
'Vnorality—but it does so in the
guise of political neutrality and
-legal objectivity.
"" The crucial issue in the case is
the defendant's justification
argument—in which they pose a
new morality in opposition to
that implicit in the literal reading
of university rules. The CJP
appears to accept the general

thrust of such a position but then
warps it to avoid facing the full
ethical challenge presented.
Red Light
For the Board uses as an
example of a justification defense
the case of a man running a red
light to get someone to the
hospital. What we must recognize
is that such a case involves values
which are compatible within a
single moral system; it is perfectly
consistent to support both healing
the injured and maintaining traffic
control. Should a situation arise
when the two conflict (driving an
injured man to the hospital), one
may be able to resolve the
question by employing a
utilitarian calculus—that is,
somehow determining which most
benefits society—healing an
injured man or maintaining traffic
laws inviolate.
It is just such a utilitarian
calculus which the CJP employes
in its decision (in its own words,
"We must balance the likelihood
of significantly inhibiting the war
in Asia, multiplied by the value of
doing so, against a similar product
of probability and value
assessments involving the effects
at Stanford of the defendant's
actions."). But the placement
center case involves conflicting
moralities, and the "value
assessments" crucial to the
utilitarian calculus vary according
to which morality is employed.
Thus, if the pro-war morality is
employed, seeking to take a job
with a war industry is an
important right; in fact, the threat
to such rights may cause "a
condition of insecurity and
instability on campus." But from
the anti-war point of view, taking
a job with a war industry is a
crime. Any "instability" or
"insecurity" on campus which
deters individuals from
committing that crime is a
positive benefit.
The CJP would have us believe
the utilitarian calculus is a

substitute for choosing between
political moralities. Rather, the
calculus cannot even be employed
unless one has already made that
choice. And the CJP, in its
stringent defense of the "right" to
participate in producing war
material, has clearly chosen to
apply the pro-war morality.
Calculus
In addition, any general
application of the CJP's utilitarian
calculus to political action will
yield bizarre results manifestly
undesireable and unfair. By
placing primary emphasis on the
likelihood of political success
("We must balance the likelihood
of significantly inhibiting the war
in Asia... ."), the calculus
penalizes political minorities.
Those who, bravely and alone,
stand oppossed to mass hysteria
would receive extra condemnation
because of the futility of their
effort. Those who join powerful
movements with a high likelihood
of success can expect exoneration.
Also, the calculus has the
effect of condemning almost any
local resistance to government
action. The size and power of the
U.S. ruling elite is clearly such
that no single action, if viewed
solely by itself, can have any
chance of reversing a policy. Now
note that the CJP chose to
evaluate the defendants' actions
not as part of a nation wide
anti-war movement but rather as
an isolated act against the state.
From this perspective, what
action at Stanford, or in Palo
Alto, or in any local area could
possibly meet the CJP's criteria?
The second line of argument
the CJP employs to refute the
defendants' claims to justification
is a narrow interpretation of
international law, especially as
applied by American courts. Here
again it can be shown the board is
defending its application of
pro-war morality with a shabby
screen of legalistic analysis. We

Robert brovcnstein

can examine the argument in each
of its five steps.
Precedence
In its first two steps, the Board
notes that U.S. courts have
neither established the precedence
of international law over domestic
law on the Vietnam issue nor
ruled the war to be illegal. This
may be true, but it is hardly
surprising that a government
engaged in criminality will not
condemn itself and legitimate
popular resistance. At any rate,
the strength of international law
is, as the Panel notes, its moral
capacity to indicate a
standard of conduct other than
that prescribed by an individual
state. If such a moral standard is
claimed as justification, it must be
evaluated on its merits and not
discarded simply because the
government persists in
maintaining its own innocence.
As regards the third step, the
Board argues that any person or
corporation contributing to the
war is not thereby a criminal.
Nuremberg is cited as precedent;
German soldiers and industrial
employees were not held
responsible for their role in an
illegal war. This contention is
simply absurd. The question is not
whether TRW and Lisenbardt are
so involved in the war that they
should be punished after its
conclusion, but whether they are
sufficiently involved in carrying
out the war now as to warrant
interference in their present
activities. From this point of view,
the analogy of World War II yields
a rather different perspective. The
same allies who would pardon
German soldiers and civiliams
after the war were quite willing to
destroy such persons when they
were still engaged (even
indirectly) in furthering the Nazi
war effort.
As an addition to the above,
the CJP then offers a particularly
amazing argument. It noted that
any finding which branded the

Vietnam War as illegal would
permit someone who considered
the war to be legal and was
adversely effected by acting on
that belief to seek a hearing with
full rights before the CJP. This
was a reasonable inference. It also
provided the CJP with an
opportunity to maintain political
neutrality if it so desired. By
indicating the administrative
difficulties inherent in such a
counter suit, it could have
admitted its procedural inability
to adjudicate a political issue and
dropped the case. Instead, it
employed the fact that a finding
in favor of the defendant's
position would cause it (the CJP)
procedural difficulty as a reason
for rejecting that position. In
other words, because a court
refuses to face the consequences
to itself of finding a defendant
innocent, it rejects his claim!
Peculiar Notion
As its fourth point, the CJP
observes that corporations
involved in the Vietnam war do
other things as well. It then argues
that interference would be more
legitimate if directed only at those
aspects of the corporation directly
linked to the war. This view leads
to the peculiar notion that

criminals can only be constrained
from commiting crimes by means
which do not interfere with their
other non-criminal activities. In
addition, it betrays the political
position of the CJP. Interestingly
enough, the Panel considered
corporate responsibility only in
terms of the production of
weapon systems and ignored the
role of the American corporate
structure in producing the foreign
policy which brought on the war
in the first place.
In its fifth point, the CJP
maintains a person is not
necessarily entitled to commit one
illegal act (disrupt the placement
center) to prevent another (war in
Vietnam). The obvious response is
that other measures had been
tried and failed, to such a
contention, the CJP replies that
"living in a civilized society
implies . .. one must play by the
rules." Here the board most
clearly indicates its support for
the political morality which
condones the Vietnam War. For
the crux of the anti-war position
is that the war in Indochina is
utterly barbaric. The rules of the
game are no longer in effect
because they have been blatantly
disregarded by the United States
government.
The CJP raises one final reason
why it must reject the claim of
justification. It alleges the
defendants transgressed upon one
of the university's most cherished
values—freedom of access to
information. "Recruiting is a kind
of speech." This argument is

preposterous. Recruitment, lik<»
selling (which also involves
speech) is a business function.
Despite the particular instance of
the Lisenbardt interview,
recruiters and students do not
normally employ the placement
center to discuss politics; they use
it to perform acts—acquiring a job
or hiring an employee. In
addition, as the members of the
CJP surely must have noted, those
opposed to war recruiting on
campus have not sought to
prohibit representatives from
corporations or the armed forces
from presenting their viewpoint.
Dave Josephson made this clear to
the U.S. Navy recruiter who was
barred from the placement center;
witness also the demand that
corporations be required to
provide information about
themselves and their war related
activities. It appears the CJP's
claim that free speech was
involved in this case can only be
interpreted as an effort to provide
some justification for an
outrageously severe sentence.
What the above analysis should
have made clear is that the CJP's
decision was in no sense an
objective one. The Placement
Center Four were guilty of
seeking to end the university's
complicity in the war in Asia. To
a Stanford administration
determined to continue the
university's involvement in that
war, such a "crime" warranted
suspension for an academic year.
