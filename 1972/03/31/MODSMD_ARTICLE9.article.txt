# in a racist society
## Shockley's Ideas Widespread 
### 
On March 9, 1972 Gregory
White, a 15 year old black youth,
was shot in the back by a San
Mateo County Deputy as the
youth fled a car which he had
allegedly taken joy-riding. A black
nurses aide offered to help White
as he bled to death, but she was
kept back by police. In response
to the demands of the Black
Community of East Palo Alto and
East Menlo Park that Deputy
Bringhurst be fired and tried for
ttiurder, the Sheriff's department
nas taken him off the beat and
transferred him to a job training
rtpcruits. A county supervisor
.Tames V. Fitzgerald has said that
he is convinced that Bringhurst
was just "doing his job." "If he's
guilty, then all of us in San Mateo
County are guilty," Fitzgerald
adde ..
Tlut a white police officer can
murder a black youth with
impunity should make all of us
stop and face the deep seated
racism that exists in this country,
and more specifically at Stanford
University. Although Bringhurst is
directly guilty of murdering
White, the responsibility for that
death extends beyond him.
Bringhurst was acting upon the
belief that blacks are inferior and
that their lives are somehow of
less value than a white person's.
The person in this area who is
probably the most articulate and
most publicized proponent of that
racist ideology is a professor at
Stanford, Professor William
Shockley. Not- only by his
theories but by his own actions
and the actions which his theories

incite. Shockley threatens the
lives of black people.
Essentially Shockley is saying
that the reason so many black
people are living in wretched
housing in urban ghettos and are
unemployed is that they don't
have the intelligence to get ahead.
He believes that their genes have
made blacks intellectually inferior
to whites. Consequently Shockley
believes that black people should
not reproduce for their own sake
and for the sake of taxpayers who
support them with welfare. He
proposes that black women be
paid to be sterilized. According to
his computations, it will cost
society less to pay for the
sterilizations than to pay for
future black children on welfare
rolls.
Validity
Let's first look at the validity
of his theories. Geneticists have
openly discarded Shockley's
genetic theories for he uses IQ
tests as a measure of black
intelligence. The National
Academy of Science has refused
to even discuss Shockley's
theories. That his theories have no
scientific basis is not surprising
considering the fact that his field
of expertise is electrical
engineering, not genetics.
His assumptions of how society
operates completely distort the
class nature of this country. He
talks about ghettos and
unemployment without
explaining why they coexist with
such affluence. Why do we spend
billions of dollars on the war in
Vietnam and so little on public

housing? Why do some people live
in mansions and have tennis
courts while children are being
gnawed to death by rats every
year in New York City? The
explanation is that resources in
this country are not used to meet
the needs of poor and working
people. It is not coincidental that
the people living in the mansions
are the same ones whose
corporations are manufacturing
the weapons for Vietnam and who
are profiting from the war. They
are the ones in whose interest the
country is run.
Historically black people were
imported to America as slaves to
increase profits for the owners of
the cotton plantations. It is still in
the financial interests of the ruling
class to perpetuate racism for it
ensures that the poor and working
people will stay divided and will
not effectively rebel against their
living conditions.
Absurd
Put in this context, to blame
the poor for living in ghettos, as
Shockley does, is absurd, and
moreover it diverts attention from
the people who are really to
blame for poverty in this country
as well as misery in Vietnam.
However no matter how
incorrect Shockley's theories are,
both from a geneti 1 and a
sociological perspective, they still
affect how people act. Shockley
himself has formed an
organization, FREED, that

lobbies for the implementaiton of
his genetic theories in welfare
programs. This means that black
women on welfare are given the
option of being sterilized and
collecting their welfare checks or
seeing their families starve. And
Shockley calls that "voluntary"
sterilization.
The repercussions of his
theories cannot be
underestimated. In a country
where racism is so widespread to
have a scientist at Stanford
University claim that blacks are
inferior and ought to be sterilized
creates a pseudo-scientific rationale
for any racist act. Many people
already believe that blacks are
inferior and his theories help them
to justify their actions
scientifically. Whether they are
firing a black from his job or
lynching him, they can say to
themselves, "This man is hardly a
human being; he really doesn't
deserve to live."
Shockley's theories and actions

hyland

show that he holds black people
in contempt and wishes to see
them exterminated. Whether he
carries out that extermination or
someone else does, with methods
not as sophisticated as
"voluntary" sterilizations, he is
directly responsible for the harm
done to the lives of black people.
He is the one who is inciting it.
The university should realize that
as long as Shockley preaches black
inferiority and uses his title of
Stanford professor to give his
theories prestige, the university
community is acting as his
accomplice. There is no neutral
stand, even for institutions, where
racism and potential genocide are
concerned. The first sten that
Stanford can take in preventing
the future murders of more
Gregory Whites is by firing
Shockley.

scientific basis is not surprising
considering the fact that his field
of expertise is electrical
engineering, not genetics.
His assumptions of how society
operates completely distort the
class nature of this country. He
talks about ghettos and
unemployment without
explaining why they coexist with
such affluence. Why do we spend
billions of dollars on the war in
Vietnam and so little on public

housing? Why do some people live
in mansions and have tennis
courts while children are being
gnawed to death by rats every
year in New York City? The
explanation is that resources in
this country are not used to meet
the needs of poor and working
people. It is not coincidental that
the people living in the mansions
are the same ones whose
corporations are manufacturing
the weapons for Vietnam and who
are profiting from the war. They
are the ones in whose interest the
country is run.
Historically black people were
imported to America as slaves to
increase profits for the owners of
the cotton plantations. It is still in
the financial interests of the ruling
class to perpetuate racism for it
ensures that the poor and working
people will stay divided and will
not effectively rebel against their
living conditions.
Absurd
Put in this context, to blame
the poor for living in ghettos, as
Shockley does, is absurd, and
moreover it diverts attention from
the people who are really to
blame for poverty in this country
as well as misery in Vietnam.
However no matter how
incorrect Shockley's theories are,
both from a geneti 1 and a
sociological perspective, they still
affect how people act. Shockley
himself has formed an
organization, FREED, that

lobbies for the implementaiton of
his genetic theories in welfare
programs. This means that black
women on welfare are given the
option of being sterilized and
collecting their welfare checks or
seeing their families starve. And
Shockley calls that "voluntary"
sterilization.
The repercussions of his
theories cannot be
underestimated. In a country
where racism is so widespread to
have a scientist at Stanford
University claim that blacks are
inferior and ought to be sterilized
creates a pseudo-scientific rationale
for any racist act. Many people
already believe that blacks are
inferior and his theories help them
to justify their actions
scientifically. Whether they are
firing a black from his job or
lynching him, they can say to
themselves, "This man is hardly a
human being; he really doesn't
deserve to live."
Shockley's theories and actions

hyland

show that he holds black people
in contempt and wishes to see
them exterminated. Whether he
carries out that extermination or
someone else does, with methods
not as sophisticated as
"voluntary" sterilizations, he is
directly responsible for the harm
done to the lives of black people.
He is the one who is inciting it.
The university should realize that
as long as Shockley preaches black
inferiority and uses his title of
Stanford professor to give his
theories prestige, the university
community is acting as his
accomplice. There is no neutral
stand, even for institutions, where
racism and potential genocide are
concerned. The first sten that
Stanford can take in preventing
the future murders of more
Gregory Whites is by firing
Shockley.
(Barbara Hyland is one of the
eight defendants arrested
following a guerrilla theater skit in
Professor Shockley s class.)
On March 9, 1972 Gregory
White, a 15 year old black youth,
was shot in the back by a San
Mateo County Deputy as the
youth fled a car which he had
allegedly taken joy-riding. A black
nurses aide offered to help White
as he bled to death, but she was
kept back by police. In response
to the demands of the Black
Community of East Palo Alto and
East Menlo Park that Deputy
Bringhurst be fired and tried for
ttiurder, the Sheriff's department
nas taken him off the beat and
transferred him to a job training
rtpcruits. A county supervisor
.Tames V. Fitzgerald has said that
he is convinced that Bringhurst
was just "doing his job." "If he's
guilty, then all of us in San Mateo
County are guilty," Fitzgerald
adde ..
Tlut a white police officer can
murder a black youth with
impunity should make all of us
stop and face the deep seated
racism that exists in this country,
and more specifically at Stanford
University. Although Bringhurst is
directly guilty of murdering
White, the responsibility for that
death extends beyond him.
Bringhurst was acting upon the
belief that blacks are inferior and
that their lives are somehow of
less value than a white person's.
The person in this area who is
probably the most articulate and
most publicized proponent of that
racist ideology is a professor at
Stanford, Professor William
Shockley. Not- only by his
theories but by his own actions
and the actions which his theories

incite. Shockley threatens the
lives of black people.
Essentially Shockley is saying
that the reason so many black
people are living in wretched
housing in urban ghettos and are
unemployed is that they don't
have the intelligence to get ahead.
He believes that their genes have
made blacks intellectually inferior
to whites. Consequently Shockley
believes that black people should
not reproduce for their own sake
and for the sake of taxpayers who
support them with welfare. He
proposes that black women be
paid to be sterilized. According to
his computations, it will cost
society less to pay for the
sterilizations than to pay for
future black children on welfare
rolls.

Let's first look at the validity

show that he holds black people
in contempt and wishes to see
them exterminated. Whether he
carries out that extermination or
someone else does, with methods
not as sophisticated as
"voluntary" sterilizations, he is
directly responsible for the harm
done to the lives of black people.
He is the one who is inciting it.
The university should realize that
as long as Shockley preaches black
inferiority and uses his title of
Stanford professor to give his
theories prestige, the university
community is acting as his
accomplice. There is no neutral
stand, even for institutions, where
racism and potential genocide are
concerned. The first sten that
Stanford can take in preventing
the future murders of more
Gregory Whites is by firing
Shockley.

Professor Shockley s class.)
On March 9, 1972 Gregory
White, a 15 year old black youth,
was shot in the back by a San
Mateo County Deputy as the
youth fled a car which he had
allegedly taken joy-riding. A black
nurses aide offered to help White
as he bled to death, but she was
kept back by police. In response
to the demands of the Black
Community of East Palo Alto and
East Menlo Park that Deputy
Bringhurst be fired and tried for
ttiurder, the Sheriff's department
nas taken him off the beat and
transferred him to a job training
rtpcruits. A county supervisor
.Tames V. Fitzgerald has said that
he is convinced that Bringhurst
was just "doing his job." "If he's
guilty, then all of us in San Mateo
County are guilty," Fitzgerald
adde ..
Tlut a white police officer can
murder a black youth with
impunity should make all of us
stop and face the deep seated
racism that exists in this country,
and more specifically at Stanford
University. Although Bringhurst is
directly guilty of murdering
White, the responsibility for that
death extends beyond him.
Bringhurst was acting upon the
belief that blacks are inferior and
that their lives are somehow of
less value than a white person's.
The person in this area who is
probably the most articulate and
most publicized proponent of that
racist ideology is a professor at
Stanford, Professor William
Shockley. Not- only by his
theories but by his own actions
and the actions which his theories

incite. Shockley threatens the
lives of black people.
Essentially Shockley is saying
that the reason so many black
people are living in wretched
housing in urban ghettos and are
unemployed is that they don't
have the intelligence to get ahead.
He believes that their genes have
made blacks intellectually inferior
to whites. Consequently Shockley
believes that black people should
not reproduce for their own sake
and for the sake of taxpayers who
support them with welfare. He
proposes that black women be
paid to be sterilized. According to
his computations, it will cost
society less to pay for the
sterilizations than to pay for
future black children on welfare
rolls.
Validity
Let's first look at the validity
of his theories. Geneticists have
openly discarded Shockley's
genetic theories for he uses IQ
tests as a measure of black
intelligence. The National
Academy of Science has refused
to even discuss Shockley's
theories. That his theories have no
scientific basis is not surprising
considering the fact that his field
of expertise is electrical
engineering, not genetics.
His assumptions of how society
operates completely distort the
class nature of this country. He
talks about ghettos and
unemployment without
explaining why they coexist with
such affluence. Why do we spend
billions of dollars on the war in
Vietnam and so little on public

housing? Why do some people live
in mansions and have tennis
courts while children are being
gnawed to death by rats every
year in New York City? The
explanation is that resources in
this country are not used to meet
the needs of poor and working
people. It is not coincidental that
the people living in the mansions
are the same ones whose
corporations are manufacturing
the weapons for Vietnam and who
are profiting from the war. They
are the ones in whose interest the
country is run.
Historically black people were
imported to America as slaves to
increase profits for the owners of
the cotton plantations. It is still in
the financial interests of the ruling
class to perpetuate racism for it
ensures that the poor and working
people will stay divided and will
not effectively rebel against their
living conditions.
Absurd
Put in this context, to blame
the poor for living in ghettos, as
Shockley does, is absurd, and
moreover it diverts attention from
the people who are really to
blame for poverty in this country
as well as misery in Vietnam.
However no matter how
incorrect Shockley's theories are,
both from a geneti 1 and a
sociological perspective, they still
affect how people act. Shockley
himself has formed an
organization, FREED, that

lobbies for the implementaiton of
his genetic theories in welfare
programs. This means that black
women on welfare are given the
option of being sterilized and
collecting their welfare checks or
seeing their families starve. And
Shockley calls that "voluntary"
sterilization.
The repercussions of his
theories cannot be
underestimated. In a country
where racism is so widespread to
have a scientist at Stanford
University claim that blacks are
inferior and ought to be sterilized
creates a pseudo-scientific rationale
for any racist act. Many people
already believe that blacks are
inferior and his theories help them
to justify their actions
scientifically. Whether they are
firing a black from his job or
lynching him, they can say to
themselves, "This man is hardly a
human being; he really doesn't
deserve to live."
