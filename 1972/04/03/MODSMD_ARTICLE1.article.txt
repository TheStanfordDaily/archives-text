# Administrators Resign After Salary Cuts
## 
### GEORGE WILLARD Copyright 1972 The Stanford Dally 
Sharp administrative salary cuts
announced by the President's office
Saturday have resulted in the resigna
tions of four top administrators. Three
of the four cited more lucrative job
offers as their reasons for leaving
Stanford.

Resigning effective June 30 are
Special Assistant to the President John
J. Schwartz, Presidential Legal Adviser
James V. Siena, and Vice-Provost
Robert M. Rosenzweig. Provost Wil
liam F. Miller announced his resigna
tion effective September 1.
The salary cuts, estimated at 15 to
20 percent, were termed "symbolic of
the sacrifices all in the University must
make to maintain services at an
adequate level," by President Richard
Lyman in a statement released by his
office Saturday April 1.
Citing his statement of March 29,
quoted in last Thursday's Daily,
Lyman said that "What we've elimi
nated so far are the services on the
fringes, and the accomplishment of
the remainder of the Budget Adjust
ment Program (BAP) objectives is
going to be tougher."
Faculty Cuts?
Amid the news of the salary cuts
and subsequent resignations, rumors
persisted that Lyman is considering an
even more dramatic move to achieve
the BAP goals. Some speculated that
he might announce sometime this
week an across-the-board five percent
cut in faculty salaries.
The resignations came several hours
after the announcements of the salary
cuts. Lyman, reached at home Satur
day evening, would say only that the
cuts were painful but necessary. "It
pains me to lose these fine adminis
trators, as it hurts the entire University

community, but I wish each of them
the very best of luck in their new
jobs," Lyman said.
Schwartz, citing "unmanageable
financial hardships" resulting from his
salary cut, will become an Assistant
Professor of Physics at Georgia Tech.
He will return to teaching physics after
a two-year stint as special prosecutor
at Stanford. "I don't really think they
need much of a special prosecutor
down where I'm going," Schwartz told
the Daily last night.
'Personal Reasons'
Miller will return to private indus
try, taking a post as Vice-President for
Research and Development for the
Digital Electronics Corporation near
Boston, Mass. Miller cited "personal
reasons" for his decision and added
that "my stay at Stanford has been
very pleasant and enlightening."
Siena will return to private practice
with the prestigious law firm of Tuttle
and Taylor in Los Angeles. "I have had
a fruitful stay at Stanford, and it's not
inconceivable that my duties may
bring me back here sometime in the
future," Siena commented.
Rosensweig told the Daily last night
that his plans were not definite as yet,
but explained that he would use his
time to write a book he has been
researching for several years, tenta
tively titled 'The Liberal: His Evolu
tion In Times of Radicalism."
A former colleague in the Political
Science department also revealed that

Rosensweig is looking for a teaching
job at an Eastern university.
Secret Documents
The salary cuts were evidently
made several weeks ago but no
information was released until late
Saturday in response to a Daily
investigation. The Daily learned of the
salary cuts and impending resignations
after reporters began investigating

alleged salary information contained in
documents delivered anonymously to
the paper early Saturday.
The documents purported to list
the salaries of 17 top administrators.
When the Daily contacted Siena,
Rosensweig, Schwartz, and Miller,
they confirmed the data, but indicated
it is no longer valid. When the Daily
called the President's office to confirm
the data and the administrators state
ments, Ray Bachetti, head of BAP,
released Lyman's report.
Bachetti refused to confirm or deny
that the resignations were linked
directly to the salary' cuts. "We had to
make several difficult decisions and I
would guess those affected had diffi
cult decisions to make also," Bachetti
said.
Salaries Revealed
The salary documents state that
Miller was receiving $40,000 per year,
Rosensweig $35,000, Schwartz
$22,000 and Siena $32,000. The
documents also set Lyman's salary at
$70,000 per year, and Bachetti's at
$28,000. The salary cuts were report
edly in the 20 percent range.
ASSU Council of President member
Larry Diamond told the Daily last
night that "President Lyman had an
extremely difficult decision to make,
and he did it with the forthrightness
which we have come to expect from
him." Diamond added that he thought
it "regretable" that budget cuts forced
the administrators to resign, but said

that in the long run the decision would
be for the benefit of the entire
community.
Council of Presidents member Doug
McHenry termed the budget cuts
"overdue" and added that "at a time
when tuition is continually rising, it is
about time administrators began to
feel the pinch, too. It is too bad that
they wouldn't stay here at financial
sacrifice like the students have to."

Lyman in a statement released by his
office Saturday April 1.
Citing his statement of March 29,
quoted in last Thursday's Daily,
Lyman said that "What we've elimi
nated so far are the services on the
fringes, and the accomplishment of
the remainder of the Budget Adjust
ment Program (BAP) objectives is
going to be tougher."
Faculty Cuts?
Amid the news of the salary cuts
and subsequent resignations, rumors
persisted that Lyman is considering an
even more dramatic move to achieve
the BAP goals. Some speculated that
he might announce sometime this
week an across-the-board five percent
cut in faculty salaries.
The resignations came several hours
after the announcements of the salary
cuts. Lyman, reached at home Satur
day evening, would say only that the
cuts were painful but necessary. "It
pains me to lose these fine adminis
trators, as it hurts the entire University

community, but I wish each of them
the very best of luck in their new
jobs," Lyman said.
Schwartz, citing "unmanageable
financial hardships" resulting from his
salary cut, will become an Assistant
Professor of Physics at Georgia Tech.
He will return to teaching physics after
a two-year stint as special prosecutor
at Stanford. "I don't really think they
need much of a special prosecutor
down where I'm going," Schwartz told
the Daily last night.
'Personal Reasons'
Miller will return to private indus
try, taking a post as Vice-President for
Research and Development for the
Digital Electronics Corporation near
Boston, Mass. Miller cited "personal
reasons" for his decision and added
that "my stay at Stanford has been
very pleasant and enlightening."
Siena will return to private practice
with the prestigious law firm of Tuttle
and Taylor in Los Angeles. "I have had
a fruitful stay at Stanford, and it's not
inconceivable that my duties may
bring me back here sometime in the
future," Siena commented.
Rosensweig told the Daily last night
that his plans were not definite as yet,
but explained that he would use his
time to write a book he has been
researching for several years, tenta
tively titled 'The Liberal: His Evolu
tion In Times of Radicalism."
A former colleague in the Political
Science department also revealed that

Rosensweig is looking for a teaching
job at an Eastern university.
Secret Documents
The salary cuts were evidently
made several weeks ago but no
information was released until late
Saturday in response to a Daily
investigation. The Daily learned of the
salary cuts and impending resignations
after reporters began investigating

alleged salary information contained in
documents delivered anonymously to
the paper early Saturday.
The documents purported to list
the salaries of 17 top administrators.
When the Daily contacted Siena,
Rosensweig, Schwartz, and Miller,
they confirmed the data, but indicated
it is no longer valid. When the Daily
called the President's office to confirm
the data and the administrators state
ments, Ray Bachetti, head of BAP,
released Lyman's report.
Bachetti refused to confirm or deny
that the resignations were linked
directly to the salary' cuts. "We had to
make several difficult decisions and I
would guess those affected had diffi
cult decisions to make also," Bachetti
said.
Salaries Revealed
The salary documents state that
Miller was receiving $40,000 per year,
Rosensweig $35,000, Schwartz
$22,000 and Siena $32,000. The
documents also set Lyman's salary at
$70,000 per year, and Bachetti's at
$28,000. The salary cuts were report
edly in the 20 percent range.
ASSU Council of President member
Larry Diamond told the Daily last
night that "President Lyman had an
extremely difficult decision to make,
and he did it with the forthrightness
which we have come to expect from
him." Diamond added that he thought
it "regretable" that budget cuts forced
the administrators to resign, but said

that in the long run the decision would
be for the benefit of the entire
community.
Council of Presidents member Doug
McHenry termed the budget cuts
"overdue" and added that "at a time
when tuition is continually rising, it is
about time administrators began to
feel the pinch, too. It is too bad that
they wouldn't stay here at financial
sacrifice like the students have to."

cuts. Lyman, reached at home Satur
day evening, would say only that the
cuts were painful but necessary. "It
pains me to lose these fine adminis
trators, as it hurts the entire University

community, but I wish each of them
the very best of luck in their new
jobs," Lyman said.
Schwartz, citing "unmanageable
financial hardships" resulting from his
salary cut, will become an Assistant
Professor of Physics at Georgia Tech.
He will return to teaching physics after
a two-year stint as special prosecutor
at Stanford. "I don't really think they
need much of a special prosecutor
down where I'm going," Schwartz told
the Daily last night.
'Personal Reasons'
Miller will return to private indus
try, taking a post as Vice-President for
Research and Development for the
Digital Electronics Corporation near
Boston, Mass. Miller cited "personal
reasons" for his decision and added
that "my stay at Stanford has been
very pleasant and enlightening."
Siena will return to private practice
with the prestigious law firm of Tuttle
and Taylor in Los Angeles. "I have had
a fruitful stay at Stanford, and it's not
inconceivable that my duties may
bring me back here sometime in the
future," Siena commented.
Rosensweig told the Daily last night
that his plans were not definite as yet,
but explained that he would use his
time to write a book he has been
researching for several years, tenta
tively titled 'The Liberal: His Evolu
tion In Times of Radicalism."
A former colleague in the Political
Science department also revealed that

Rosensweig is looking for a teaching
job at an Eastern university.
Secret Documents
The salary cuts were evidently
made several weeks ago but no
information was released until late
Saturday in response to a Daily
investigation. The Daily learned of the
salary cuts and impending resignations
after reporters began investigating

alleged salary information contained in
documents delivered anonymously to
the paper early Saturday.
The documents purported to list
the salaries of 17 top administrators.
When the Daily contacted Siena,
Rosensweig, Schwartz, and Miller,
they confirmed the data, but indicated
it is no longer valid. When the Daily
called the President's office to confirm
the data and the administrators state
ments, Ray Bachetti, head of BAP,
released Lyman's report.
Bachetti refused to confirm or deny
that the resignations were linked
directly to the salary' cuts. "We had to
make several difficult decisions and I
would guess those affected had diffi
cult decisions to make also," Bachetti
said.
Salaries Revealed
The salary documents state that
Miller was receiving $40,000 per year,
Rosensweig $35,000, Schwartz
$22,000 and Siena $32,000. The
documents also set Lyman's salary at
$70,000 per year, and Bachetti's at
$28,000. The salary cuts were report
edly in the 20 percent range.
ASSU Council of President member
Larry Diamond told the Daily last
night that "President Lyman had an
extremely difficult decision to make,
and he did it with the forthrightness
which we have come to expect from
him." Diamond added that he thought
it "regretable" that budget cuts forced
the administrators to resign, but said

that in the long run the decision would
be for the benefit of the entire
community.
Council of Presidents member Doug
McHenry termed the budget cuts
"overdue" and added that "at a time
when tuition is continually rising, it is
about time administrators began to
feel the pinch, too. It is too bad that
they wouldn't stay here at financial
sacrifice like the students have to."
