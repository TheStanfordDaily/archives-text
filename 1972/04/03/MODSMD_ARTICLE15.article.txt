# Changes In Overseas Studies
## 
### 
Two changes in overseas study
programs, designed to broaden
opportunities for students, have
been approved by the Faculty
Senate.
The first change provides
opportunities for advanced
independent study projects for.
students attending overseas
campuses. Such work, for from
five to nine units per quarter,
must be in addition to normal
courses of study and be done
under the supervision of a faculty
member or local advisor.
Eligibility for independent
study projects now will also be
open to graduate students, on a
space available basis. Participants

California, under the Act of March
3. 1879.)

may register for an additional
quarter to complete such projects,
if there is space.
The second change places a
new emphasis on conversational
ability in meeting foreign language
requirements. Academic directors
overseas are given discretion in
determining the amount of
language instruction needed after
the student arrives. Students well
qualified in language may
substitute other courses for
language if they so desire.
Professor Ralph M. Hester,
chairman of the Committee on
Foreign Study Programs, reported
that the new policy statement
reaffirms that basic academic
policies on the home campus still
apply overseas. Students "will
henceforth be free to select a
program of study from among all
of the courses offered, including
directed reading and independent

study projects," said Hester.
After the regular Senate
meeting last Thursday, Biology
Professor Colin Pittendrigh asked
the Steering Committee to
consider a study of the objectives
and costs of the overseas
campuses, indicating he felt the
alternative of sending Stanford
students to study at foreign
institutions should be viewed as a
possible substitute for the present
program.
Foreign institutions generally
have much higher language
requirements than those needed
at Stanford's overseas campuses.
