# Cards Struggle To Win Two
## 
### MIKE HERMAN 
Coming off the impressive
championship of the Riverside
Baseball Tournament, Stanford
returned to home action this
weekend and struggled to win two
out of three games from
California rivals, UC Davis and
Stanislaus State College.
Behind a ninth inning rally and
the brilliant pitching of Bob
DiPietro, the Cardinals managed
to take the first two games of the
weekend, downing Stanislaus 5-4
Friday and splitting with UC
Davis—winning the doubleheader
opener 4-0, before faltering 6-4 in
the nightcap.
During the first six innings of
the Stanislaus State game Friday,
Stanford hardly resembled the
poised and well-balanced team
that had swept through the Spring
recess Classic. Stanislaus grabbed a
three run lead in the first inning
off starter Nick Peterson on a
single to the leadoff hitter,
followed by an error by second

baseman, Kim Hannaford, two
run-producing singles and an
infield out.
Stanislaus picked up another
run in the seventh inning and SSC
starting pitcher Mike Jilka entered
the bottom of the seventh with a
three-hit shutout. Jilka, 0-4
coming into the game, was
suddenly hit by wildness and the
Cards scored three runs to put
themselves back into the
ballgame.
Rightfielder Mike Nelson led
off the inning with a walk but was
forced out at second. Singles by
Hannaford and Peterson
preceeded a two-run double by
Mickey Aguirre. Two batters later,
Peterson came home on a balk.
Clutch Hitting
Trailing 4-3 in the bottom of
the ninth, Stanford prevailed
upon some clutch hitting and a
very important error to rally for a
5-4 victory.
Pinchhitter Tim Wilson, opened
the inning by getting aboard on an
error by Stanislaus' second
baseman. After Aguirre had
grounded out, consecutive singles
by centerfielder Tom Williams,
leftfielder Ron Boone and
firstbaseman Mark Lucich brought
in the tying and winning runs.
DiPietro Throws Two-Hitter
Saturday, the Cardinals faced
UC Davis, a team which defeated
Stanford in mid-February. The
first game was less exciting than
Friday's contest, but the

outstanding pitching of DiPietro
certainly kept the gijme from
becoming boring as the Cards
triumphed, 4-0.
In a shortened seven inning
game, the Stanford lefthander
baffled Davis hitters, repeatedly
retiring the side in order. Through
four innings, DiPietro had a no
hitter going before giving up
solitary hits in the fifth and
seventh innings. Striking out six
and allowing only one walk, the
sophomore completed his fifth
game of the season, placing him
on top of the Cardinal staff with
Dan Shaw.
DiPietro provided the victory
margin when he scored in the fifth
inning as the Cards tallied three
runs to ice the game. Leading off
the inning, he cracked a hard
single and went to third on a
two-base error. Thirdbaseman
Aguirre singled in DiPietro, and
scored on a double off the bat of
Tom Williams. Williams later
moved to third on a passed ball
and scored on a sacrifice fly by

cleanup hitter Lucich.
Stanford also improved its base
running, stealing four bases off
the Davis battery.
In the nightcap Stanford
scored two quick runs in the first
inning and, except for a minor
offensive eruption in the seventh
inning, never threatened the
Aggies as Davis went on to win,
6-4.
UCD scored three runs in the
second, added another in the third
and rode home on a gamewinning
homerun by slugging shortstop,
John Repetto.
Pitcher Tom Grovhoug escaped
a serious situation in the bottom
of the seventh when the Cardinals
loaded the bases with no outs, but
were held to only two runs.
This week, Stanford concludes
its pre-conference season with a
game Tuesday against the
University of Pacific. Friday, the
Cards travel to Los Angeles for
the three most important games
of the league season against top
conference foe, USC.

DiPietro Throws Two-Hitter
Saturday, the Cardinals faced
UC Davis, a team which defeated
Stanford in mid-February. The
first game was less exciting than
Friday's contest, but the

outstanding pitching of DiPietro
certainly kept the gijme from
becoming boring as the Cards
triumphed, 4-0.
In a shortened seven inning
game, the Stanford lefthander
baffled Davis hitters, repeatedly
retiring the side in order. Through
four innings, DiPietro had a no
hitter going before giving up
solitary hits in the fifth and
seventh innings. Striking out six
and allowing only one walk, the
sophomore completed his fifth
game of the season, placing him
on top of the Cardinal staff with
Dan Shaw.
DiPietro provided the victory
margin when he scored in the fifth
inning as the Cards tallied three
runs to ice the game. Leading off
the inning, he cracked a hard
single and went to third on a
two-base error. Thirdbaseman
Aguirre singled in DiPietro, and
scored on a double off the bat of
Tom Williams. Williams later
moved to third on a passed ball
and scored on a sacrifice fly by

cleanup hitter Lucich.
Stanford also improved its base
running, stealing four bases off
the Davis battery.
In the nightcap Stanford
scored two quick runs in the first
inning and, except for a minor
offensive eruption in the seventh
inning, never threatened the
Aggies as Davis went on to win,
6-4.
UCD scored three runs in the
second, added another in the third
and rode home on a gamewinning
homerun by slugging shortstop,
John Repetto.
Pitcher Tom Grovhoug escaped
a serious situation in the bottom
of the seventh when the Cardinals
loaded the bases with no outs, but
were held to only two runs.
This week, Stanford concludes
its pre-conference season with a
game Tuesday against the
University of Pacific. Friday, the
Cards travel to Los Angeles for
the three most important games
of the league season against top
conference foe, USC.

afternoon.
Coming off the impressive
championship of the Riverside
Baseball Tournament, Stanford
returned to home action this
weekend and struggled to win two
out of three games from
California rivals, UC Davis and
Stanislaus State College.
Behind a ninth inning rally and
the brilliant pitching of Bob
DiPietro, the Cardinals managed
to take the first two games of the
weekend, downing Stanislaus 5-4
Friday and splitting with UC
Davis—winning the doubleheader
opener 4-0, before faltering 6-4 in
the nightcap.
During the first six innings of
the Stanislaus State game Friday,
Stanford hardly resembled the
poised and well-balanced team
that had swept through the Spring
recess Classic. Stanislaus grabbed a
three run lead in the first inning
off starter Nick Peterson on a
single to the leadoff hitter,
followed by an error by second

baseman, Kim Hannaford, two
run-producing singles and an
infield out.
Stanislaus picked up another
run in the seventh inning and SSC
starting pitcher Mike Jilka entered
the bottom of the seventh with a
three-hit shutout. Jilka, 0-4
coming into the game, was
suddenly hit by wildness and the
Cards scored three runs to put
themselves back into the
ballgame.
Rightfielder Mike Nelson led
off the inning with a walk but was
forced out at second. Singles by
Hannaford and Peterson
preceeded a two-run double by
Mickey Aguirre. Two batters later,
Peterson came home on a balk.
Clutch Hitting
Trailing 4-3 in the bottom of
the ninth, Stanford prevailed
upon some clutch hitting and a
very important error to rally for a
5-4 victory.
Pinchhitter Tim Wilson, opened
the inning by getting aboard on an
error by Stanislaus' second
baseman. After Aguirre had
grounded out, consecutive singles
by centerfielder Tom Williams,
leftfielder Ron Boone and
firstbaseman Mark Lucich brought
in the tying and winning runs.
