# Racketmen Smash UC Irvine, Oregon
## 
### DAVID ANTONUCCIO 
The Stanford tennis team
warmed up for UCLA and USC
next weekend by destroying UC
Irvine on Friday, 8-1, and the
University of Oregon on Saturday,
also 8-1.
Coach Dick Gould threw his
top line-up against Irvine and this
proved too much for the
Anteaters who have a top-flight
team. Roscoe Tanner displayed a
sizzling backhand all afternoon in
defeating Irvine's number one
player Bob Chappel, 6-2, 6-1.
Commenting on his performance
Tanner stated, "I was generally
satisfied with the win. I did well
on the big points but there are
still areas that I'd like to improve.
I could be hitting the ball a little
more solid and by next week I
feel I will be."
With number two man Alex
Mayer not playing because of a
muscle pull in his leg, freshman
Chico Hagey stepped into his spot
and did a superb job of downing
his opponent 6-2, 6-3. Stanford's

only defeat came in number two
doubles.
Against Oregon, most of the
regulars were rested. Paul Sidone
and Gery Groslimond occupied
the number one and two spots,
and both recorded victories. Rick
Evans, Mac Claflin, John Wright,
and Brian Hahn also won in
singles competition. Claflin and
Evans along with Chapin and
Wright were the victorious
doubles combinations. All four
are seniors on the squad.
Gould's forces will be working
hard for UCLA and USC but by
no means will they look past the
University of New Mexico and
Arizona St. next Tuesday and
Wednesday. "Arizona State and
New Mexico will probably be as
tough as Irvine and we're going to
play our best guys in preparation
for SC and UCLA," commented
Gould.
Looking ahead to the matches
in Los Angeles, the line-up sheet
will probably read Tanner, Mayer,
Hagey, Rick Fisher, Sidone, and
Groslimond. Chip Fisher and Jim
Delaney will be at seven and eight.
Tanner and Mayer will combine as
a doubles team, as will brothers
Rick and Chip Fisher, and Hagey
and Delaney.
"We're sharp and ready for the
matches down south," said Gould.
"Mayer should be healthy by

then. I have complete confidence
in our singles team, but I am
impressed with SC doubles' teams
and greatly respect them. I think
the key to victory will be our
doubles teams."

New Mexico will probably be as
tough as Irvine and we're going to
play our best guys in preparation
for SC and UCLA," commented
Gould.
Looking ahead to the matches
in Los Angeles, the line-up sheet
will probably read Tanner, Mayer,
Hagey, Rick Fisher, Sidone, and
Groslimond. Chip Fisher and Jim
Delaney will be at seven and eight.
Tanner and Mayer will combine as
a doubles team, as will brothers
Rick and Chip Fisher, and Hagey
and Delaney.
"We're sharp and ready for the
matches down south," said Gould.
"Mayer should be healthy by

then. I have complete confidence
in our singles team, but I am
impressed with SC doubles' teams
and greatly respect them. I think
the key to victory will be our
doubles teams."
STANFORD 8, UC IRVINE 1
Singles: Tanner, S, d. Chappell, 6-2,

6-1; Hagey, S, d. Gabolski, 6-2, 6-3;
Fisher, S, d. Ogle, 6-1, 6-0; Sidone, S,
d. Schneider, 6-1, 1-6, 6-2; Delaney, S,
d. Nachand, 7-5, 6-2; Noonan, S. d.
Edwards, 6-1, 6-7, 6-4.
Doubles: Fisher - Fisher d. Chappell -
Schneider, 6-2, 7-6; Gabolski - Cripe d.
Hagey - Delaney, 2-6, 6-1, 7-5; Evans -
Claflin, S. d. Nachand-Ogle, 6-2, 6-3.
The Stanford tennis team
warmed up for UCLA and USC
next weekend by destroying UC
Irvine on Friday, 8-1, and the
University of Oregon on Saturday,
also 8-1.
Coach Dick Gould threw his
top line-up against Irvine and this
proved too much for the
Anteaters who have a top-flight
team. Roscoe Tanner displayed a
sizzling backhand all afternoon in
defeating Irvine's number one
player Bob Chappel, 6-2, 6-1.
Commenting on his performance
Tanner stated, "I was generally
satisfied with the win. I did well
on the big points but there are
still areas that I'd like to improve.
I could be hitting the ball a little
more solid and by next week I
feel I will be."
With number two man Alex
Mayer not playing because of a
muscle pull in his leg, freshman
Chico Hagey stepped into his spot
and did a superb job of downing
his opponent 6-2, 6-3. Stanford's

only defeat came in number two
doubles.
Against Oregon, most of the
regulars were rested. Paul Sidone
and Gery Groslimond occupied
the number one and two spots,
and both recorded victories. Rick
Evans, Mac Claflin, John Wright,
and Brian Hahn also won in
singles competition. Claflin and
Evans along with Chapin and
Wright were the victorious
doubles combinations. All four
are seniors on the squad.
Gould's forces will be working
hard for UCLA and USC but by
no means will they look past the
University of New Mexico and
Arizona St. next Tuesday and
Wednesday. "Arizona State and
New Mexico will probably be as
tough as Irvine and we're going to
play our best guys in preparation
for SC and UCLA," commented
Gould.
