# Golfers Fourth In Tourney
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford's golf team tied the
tournament record last week in
the Western Intercollegiate
Championships but could only
manage a fourth place finish in
the 27 team event which
concluded Friday at Pasatiempo.
Arizona State, paced by two
time Ail-American Howard
Twitty, made the 26th annual
tournament a runaway as it
broke the old team record by 17
shots with an 867 total. Twitty
won the individual title with an
eight under par 205 performance,
breaking the old individual record
by nine shots.
Stanford finished with an 884
total, only one shot behind USC
and San Jose State, who tied for
second at 883. San Jose's Roger
Maltbie chipped in for a birdie on
the final hole to give the Spartans

their one shot cushion.
Although Stanford's team
performance was disappointing,
the Cards came up with two
outstanding individual efforts.
Captain Tom Keelin tied for
fourth with a 216 total on rounds
of 68-76-72 and freshman Dave
Baskins tied for sixth with
73-74-71 for a 218 total.
Bruce Robertson and Gary
Vanier each shot 225 while Aly
Trompas had 227. Conrad
Nilmeier slumped to a 235 total
after a strong second place finish
in the Fresno State Classic two
weeks ago.
Arizona State's 17 stroke
margin over Stanford was
somewhat misleading since the
Cards could have caught the Sun
Devils with four pars and a birdie
on five crucial holes. But Baskins
took a quadruple bogey on the
17th hole in Thursday's second
round while Keelin, Vanier, and
Robertson had four triple bogies
between them.
"Those holes were the
difference," said Coach Bud
Finger. "You can never tell what
would have happened if we had
scored around par on those five
holes."

Stanford will resume its dual
match schedule today with a
12:30 p.m. match against the
University of Hawaii at the
Stanford course. Tomorrow
afternoon, the Cards' undefeated
freshman team will seek its fifth
straight victory in a 12:30 p.m.
match against Menlo College at
Stanford.
