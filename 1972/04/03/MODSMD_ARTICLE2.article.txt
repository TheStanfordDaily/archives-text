# Junior Faculty Fund Awarded
## 
### 
Provost. William Miller announced
Friday that the University had receiv
ed a $1.25 million award from the
Andrew Mellon Foundation of New
York. Miller made the announcement
at the Spring Quarter meeting of the
Academic Council.
Miller said that the Mellon grant
will be used "to assist in providing a
better age distribution and a better
ratio of tenured to non-tenured
faculty . . and "to support a number
of junior faculty leaves."
Foundation President Nathan M.
Pusev stated in a letter to President
Lyman that "their award is 'one of
several being made to a small number
of leading private universities which
have exercised special responsibility
over the years for setting and main
taining high academic standards."
Pusey's letter specifies that the
award may " 'be used as the Presidents

and their chief advisors shall direct to
preserve or seek special excellence in
the intellectual life of their universi
ties.' "
Aid Young Faculty Flow
In explaining advantages the Ad
ministration hopes will accrue from
the award, Miller said that it will "be
used to allow the flow of young
faculty to continue by providing
additional positions in very key places
in anticipation of either future retire
ments or other faculty moves.
"The use of this share of the grant
will temporarily create a bulge in the
total number of faculty. The intellec
tual advantages of insuring this steady
flow of younger men and women in
faculty ranks should, I hope, outweigh
the inconveniences and the pressure of
these temporary bulges."
Miller said he hoped that the use of
the award in this manner would help

alleviate the University's current situa
tion in which "an abnormal number of
faculty are about 49 years old." Miller
said he felt that "this compression
tends to limit the number of young
faculty who can be brought into the
University."
Provost Miller also said that "the
second major use of the Mellon Award
will be for a substantial number of
junior faculty leaves. In order to aid
assistant professors to develop their
scholarship, a five-year program will
provide for one and occasionally two
quarter leaves during which the faculty
member may devote himself or herself
to scholarly pursuits only."
Funds For Academic Leaves
According to Miller, the five-year
program will begin in the academic
year 1972-1973, "with first applica
tions to be considered in the fall of
1972. We expect to be able to provide
approximately fifteen leaves per year
at the equivalent of one quarter at full
pay."
Also at the meeting, Miller predict
ed that Stanford "will have increased
our ethnic minority and women
faculty by significant numbers for the
coming school year." He indicated
that $75,000 for the Affirmative
Action Fund may have aided the
University's desire to recruit minority
and women faculty.
As most faculty knew, Miller said,
the University employment practices
are to be reviewed by the Department
of Health, Education and Welfare
although he said "at this stage we are
unsure when" this review might come.
Warning that because of the high
intensity use of labor at Stanford "we
are pricing ourselves out of the
educational market," he urged that
departments and programs "begin to
consider how they can improve their

academic effectiveness not only in
quality, but also in quantity; that is,
with larger student-faculty ratios on
the average."
Provost Miller suggested that facul
ty "may be able to adopt machine
methods for some activities, or, in
other cases, more self-study."

faculty by significant numbers for the
coming school year." He indicated
that $75,000 for the Affirmative
Action Fund may have aided the
University's desire to recruit minority
and women faculty.
As most faculty knew, Miller said,
the University employment practices
are to be reviewed by the Department
of Health, Education and Welfare
although he said "at this stage we are
unsure when" this review might come.
Warning that because of the high
intensity use of labor at Stanford "we
are pricing ourselves out of the
educational market," he urged that
departments and programs "begin to
consider how they can improve their

academic effectiveness not only in
quality, but also in quantity; that is,
with larger student-faculty ratios on
the average."
Provost Miller suggested that facul
ty "may be able to adopt machine
methods for some activities, or, in
other cases, more self-study."

PRESIDENT AND PROTESTER—President Lyman listens as SRM member Pete Kr.utson attempts to shout demands to
the Academic Council Friday over the loud mock applause of the faculty.
Provost. William Miller announced
Friday that the University had receiv
ed a $1.25 million award from the
Andrew Mellon Foundation of New
York. Miller made the announcement
at the Spring Quarter meeting of the
Academic Council.
Miller said that the Mellon grant
will be used "to assist in providing a
better age distribution and a better
ratio of tenured to non-tenured
faculty . . and "to support a number
of junior faculty leaves."
Foundation President Nathan M.
Pusev stated in a letter to President
Lyman that "their award is 'one of
several being made to a small number
of leading private universities which
have exercised special responsibility
over the years for setting and main
taining high academic standards."
Pusey's letter specifies that the
award may " 'be used as the Presidents

and their chief advisors shall direct to
preserve or seek special excellence in
the intellectual life of their universi
ties.' "
Aid Young Faculty Flow
In explaining advantages the Ad
ministration hopes will accrue from
the award, Miller said that it will "be
used to allow the flow of young
faculty to continue by providing
additional positions in very key places
in anticipation of either future retire
ments or other faculty moves.
"The use of this share of the grant
will temporarily create a bulge in the
total number of faculty. The intellec
tual advantages of insuring this steady
flow of younger men and women in
faculty ranks should, I hope, outweigh
the inconveniences and the pressure of
these temporary bulges."
Miller said he hoped that the use of
the award in this manner would help

alleviate the University's current situa
tion in which "an abnormal number of
faculty are about 49 years old." Miller
said he felt that "this compression
tends to limit the number of young
faculty who can be brought into the
University."
Provost Miller also said that "the
second major use of the Mellon Award
will be for a substantial number of
junior faculty leaves. In order to aid
assistant professors to develop their
scholarship, a five-year program will
provide for one and occasionally two
quarter leaves during which the faculty
member may devote himself or herself
to scholarly pursuits only."
Funds For Academic Leaves
According to Miller, the five-year
program will begin in the academic
year 1972-1973, "with first applica
tions to be considered in the fall of
1972. We expect to be able to provide
approximately fifteen leaves per year
at the equivalent of one quarter at full
pay."
Also at the meeting, Miller predict
ed that Stanford "will have increased
our ethnic minority and women
faculty by significant numbers for the
coming school year." He indicated
that $75,000 for the Affirmative
Action Fund may have aided the
University's desire to recruit minority
and women faculty.
