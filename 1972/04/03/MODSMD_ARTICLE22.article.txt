Major North Viet Drive
SAIGON — North Vietnamese troops and armor pushing
across the demilitarized zone into South Vietnam's
northernmost province crushed three more bases
yesterday and sent hundreds of government troops
retreating in disarray. Four American aircraft were
reported shot down while supporting the defenders.
The U.S. Command said nearly a score of American
fighter-bombers—grounded for days by bad flying
weather—struck inside North Vietnam against anti-aircraft
defenses. Sources said more heavy raids were being
planned against the north in retaliation for the biggest
enemy offensive since the 1968 Tet campaign.
Eight U.S. crewmen were reported missing in the air
losses over the embattled area south of the DMZ.
The South Vietnamese rushed 8,000 to 10,000
reinforcements north to aid the battered 3rd Division,
pushed back 10 miles from the DMZ.
President Nguyen Van Thieu cancelled a speech to the
National Assembly's lower house. He was reported
heading north to Da Nang and Hue to meet with military
commanders. Sources said Thieu told house leaders the
situation was very serious.
The U.S. Command said half a dozen North
Vietnamese sites inside and to the north of the
demilitarized zone and in Laos unleashed barrages of
surface-to-air missiles at American fighter-bombers
supporting South Vietnamese troops. Four of the SAMS
were fired across the DMZ, a spokesman said.
The command said none of the fighter-bombers was
hit, but conventional anti-aircraft fire brought down a
spotter plane and three helicopters north and northwest
of Quang Tri City, and roughly 10 miles below the DMZ.
The latest South Vietnamese base to fall was Mai Loc,
the 12th lost since the enemy offensive began last
Thursday. It is 11 miles south of the demilitarized zone.
With the enemy drive threatening Quang Tri City, 19
miles south of the DMZ, 80 American civilians were
evacuated, the U.S. Command said.
Gil Hodges Dies
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Gil Hodges, the one-time
star of the old Brooklyn Dodgers who managed the
Miracle Mets of New York to baseball's world
championship in 1969, collapsed and died yesterday.
Hodges had just finished a golf match at the Ramada
Inn and was strolling back to his motel room with
companions when he slumped to the ground.
He was rushed to the Good Samaritan Hospital, where
he was admitted at 5:25 p.m., EST. He died 20 minutes
later, the hospital said.
Death was caused by an apparent heart attack, a
hospital spokesman said.
Baseball Strike On
NEW YORK —Striking major league baseball players

continued to scatter to their homes yesterday while
representatives of both sides discussed the pension dispute
that threatened to delay the 1972 season opening,
scheduled for Wednesday.
It is the first generaJ strike by players in the sport's
history.
Owner Bill Bartholomay of the Atlanta Braves said
"every effort will be made" to field a team on opening
day, even if it means using minor leaguers.
Negotiators for both sides met yesterday for the
second straight day and reported no progress in their
90-minute talks. John Gaherin, representing the owners,
said he and Marvin Miller, executive director of the
striking Players Association, had agreed to talk again
today.
The strike began Saturday -all 12 scheduled exhibition
games were canceled—with the players seeking additional
contributions from the owners above the one-and-only
offer of $400,000 for the health care segment of the
pension package.
Berrigan Trial Verdict
HARRISBURG, Pa. — The Rev. Philip Berrigar. was
convicted yesterday of smuggling a letter out of prison,
but the jury trying the antiwar priest and six others
reported a deadlock on the other counts, including the
key conspiracy charge. They will resume deliberations this
morning.
The jury reported itself deadlocked on nine of the
indictment's 10 counts—including the one that charges the
Harrisburg Seven with plotting to kidnap White House
adviser Henry A. Kissinger and blow up or otherwise
destroy federal property.
U.S. District Court Judge R. Dixon Herman ordered
the jurors to give the case another try, citing the length,
the cost and the importance of the 10-week trial.
If they continued deadlocked, he admitted he would
have no choice but to dismiss the panel as a hung jury.
Herman set no time limit on the renewed deliberations.
After the panel was told to resume deliberations, at 4
p.m., the jury at its own request was sent to its suburban
motel quarters for the night. It was directed to return to
its deliberations room at 9 a.m. Monday.
The smuggling count upon which Berrigan was
convicted carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in
federal prison. He now is serving a six-year sentence for
destroying draft records.
He began his current term in 1970 and would have
been eligible for parole in early 1974.
The other counts in the indictment carry an additional
40-year maximum for the 48-year-old Berrigan; 40 years
for Sister Elizabeth McAlister, 31, and five years each for
the other defendants: Eqbal Ahmad, 41, the Revs. Neil
McLaughlin, 31, and Joseph Wenderoth, 36, and former
priest Anthony Scoblick, 31, and his wife, Mary, 33, an
ex-nun.
Berrigan, a Roman Catholic priest, betrayed no
outward emotionon hearing the limited verdict.

Major North Viet Drive
SAIGON — North Vietnamese troops and armor pushing
across the demilitarized zone into South Vietnam's
northernmost province crushed three more bases
yesterday and sent hundreds of government troops
retreating in disarray. Four American aircraft were
reported shot down while supporting the defenders.
The U.S. Command said nearly a score of American
fighter-bombers—grounded for days by bad flying
weather—struck inside North Vietnam against anti-aircraft
defenses. Sources said more heavy raids were being
planned against the north in retaliation for the biggest
enemy offensive since the 1968 Tet campaign.
Eight U.S. crewmen were reported missing in the air
losses over the embattled area south of the DMZ.
The South Vietnamese rushed 8,000 to 10,000
reinforcements north to aid the battered 3rd Division,
pushed back 10 miles from the DMZ.
President Nguyen Van Thieu cancelled a speech to the
National Assembly's lower house. He was reported
heading north to Da Nang and Hue to meet with military
commanders. Sources said Thieu told house leaders the
situation was very serious.
The U.S. Command said half a dozen North
Vietnamese sites inside and to the north of the
demilitarized zone and in Laos unleashed barrages of
surface-to-air missiles at American fighter-bombers
supporting South Vietnamese troops. Four of the SAMS
were fired across the DMZ, a spokesman said.
The command said none of the fighter-bombers was
hit, but conventional anti-aircraft fire brought down a
spotter plane and three helicopters north and northwest
of Quang Tri City, and roughly 10 miles below the DMZ.
The latest South Vietnamese base to fall was Mai Loc,
the 12th lost since the enemy offensive began last
Thursday. It is 11 miles south of the demilitarized zone.
With the enemy drive threatening Quang Tri City, 19
miles south of the DMZ, 80 American civilians were
evacuated, the U.S. Command said.

Inn and was strolling back to his motel room with
companions when he slumped to the ground.

Baseball Strike On
NEW YORK —Striking major league baseball players

continued to scatter to their homes yesterday while
representatives of both sides discussed the pension dispute
that threatened to delay the 1972 season opening,
scheduled for Wednesday.
It is the first generaJ strike by players in the sport's
history.
Owner Bill Bartholomay of the Atlanta Braves said
"every effort will be made" to field a team on opening
day, even if it means using minor leaguers.
Negotiators for both sides met yesterday for the
second straight day and reported no progress in their
90-minute talks. John Gaherin, representing the owners,
said he and Marvin Miller, executive director of the
striking Players Association, had agreed to talk again
today.
The strike began Saturday -all 12 scheduled exhibition
games were canceled—with the players seeking additional
contributions from the owners above the one-and-only
offer of $400,000 for the health care segment of the
pension package.
Berrigan Trial Verdict
HARRISBURG, Pa. — The Rev. Philip Berrigar. was
convicted yesterday of smuggling a letter out of prison,
but the jury trying the antiwar priest and six others
reported a deadlock on the other counts, including the
key conspiracy charge. They will resume deliberations this
morning.
The jury reported itself deadlocked on nine of the
indictment's 10 counts—including the one that charges the
Harrisburg Seven with plotting to kidnap White House
adviser Henry A. Kissinger and blow up or otherwise
destroy federal property.
U.S. District Court Judge R. Dixon Herman ordered
the jurors to give the case another try, citing the length,
the cost and the importance of the 10-week trial.
If they continued deadlocked, he admitted he would
have no choice but to dismiss the panel as a hung jury.
Herman set no time limit on the renewed deliberations.
After the panel was told to resume deliberations, at 4
p.m., the jury at its own request was sent to its suburban
motel quarters for the night. It was directed to return to
its deliberations room at 9 a.m. Monday.
The smuggling count upon which Berrigan was
convicted carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in
federal prison. He now is serving a six-year sentence for
destroying draft records.
He began his current term in 1970 and would have
been eligible for parole in early 1974.
The other counts in the indictment carry an additional
40-year maximum for the 48-year-old Berrigan; 40 years

Major North Viet Drive
SAIGON — North Vietnamese troops and armor pushing
across the demilitarized zone into South Vietnam's
northernmost province crushed three more bases
yesterday and sent hundreds of government troops
retreating in disarray. Four American aircraft were
reported shot down while supporting the defenders.
The U.S. Command said nearly a score of American
fighter-bombers—grounded for days by bad flying
weather—struck inside North Vietnam against anti-aircraft
defenses. Sources said more heavy raids were being
planned against the north in retaliation for the biggest
enemy offensive since the 1968 Tet campaign.
Eight U.S. crewmen were reported missing in the air
losses over the embattled area south of the DMZ.
The South Vietnamese rushed 8,000 to 10,000
reinforcements north to aid the battered 3rd Division,
pushed back 10 miles from the DMZ.
President Nguyen Van Thieu cancelled a speech to the
National Assembly's lower house. He was reported
heading north to Da Nang and Hue to meet with military
commanders. Sources said Thieu told house leaders the
situation was very serious.
The U.S. Command said half a dozen North
Vietnamese sites inside and to the north of the
demilitarized zone and in Laos unleashed barrages of
surface-to-air missiles at American fighter-bombers
supporting South Vietnamese troops. Four of the SAMS
were fired across the DMZ, a spokesman said.
The command said none of the fighter-bombers was
hit, but conventional anti-aircraft fire brought down a
spotter plane and three helicopters north and northwest
of Quang Tri City, and roughly 10 miles below the DMZ.
The latest South Vietnamese base to fall was Mai Loc,
the 12th lost since the enemy offensive began last
Thursday. It is 11 miles south of the demilitarized zone.
With the enemy drive threatening Quang Tri City, 19
miles south of the DMZ, 80 American civilians were
evacuated, the U.S. Command said.

Baseball Strike On

representatives of both sides discussed the pension dispute
that threatened to delay the 1972 season opening,
scheduled for Wednesday.

history.
Owner Bill Bartholomay of the Atlanta Braves said
"every effort will be made" to field a team on opening

Negotiators for both sides met yesterday for the
second straight day and reported no progress in their
90-minute talks. John Gaherin, representing the owners,
said he and Marvin Miller, executive director of the
striking Players Association, had agreed to talk again
