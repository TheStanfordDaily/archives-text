# Shockley Seeks Harvard Forum
## 
### 
William Shockley, who enthusias
tically debates his critics, was ready to
fly to Boston at a moment's notice to
face a radical convention there last
weekend.
The controversial electrical en
gineering professor asked for speaking
time at Harvard University because
that campus was the location of a
national convention of the radical
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS).
In its newspaper, published prior to
the convention, the SDS had called
Shockley "racist" for his theories
linking race with intelligence and had
printed Shockley's picture with the
caption, "Wanted: Dead or Alive."
Shockley telegraphed Harvard's
President Derek Bok and asked him to
supply a forum so that the professor
could reply to SDS.
SDS Convention
The SDS convention was scheduled

to include radical analysis of the views
of Shockley, of educational psycholo
gist Arthur Jensen of Berkely, and of
Richard Herrnstein of Harvard's
psychology department. The SDS
charged the three "are seeking to
transform racist ideology into a
respectable academic position."
In his telegram to Bok, Shockley
said he would be ready to leave at any
moment up until noon Saturday, if he
were guaranteed an opportunity to
speak on his theories that blacks'
genetic qualities give them lower
intelligence.
The Saturday deadline passed, but
yesterday at noon Shockley received a
telegram from the SDS inviting him to
address the radical group in session at
Harvard's Memorial Hall.
Shockley reserved space on a flight
to Boston, and began to place phone
calls to Cambridge to contact the SDS,
since he could not arrive to speak

before 11 p.m. Boston time.
Cancelled Trip
Shockley said he gave up on the
trip when he was unable to contact the
SDS up to half an hour before his
scheduled flight. He said he was able
to reach only the local police, a
Boston newspaper covering the con
ference, and the girlfriend of the
president of Harvard SDS.
The original telegram was sent to
Bok instead of SDS, Shockley said,
because "1 didn't think I could get a
reliable deal from the SDS."
The telegram to Bok states partly
that in "permitting the use of facilities
to SDS," Harvard knew "ahead of
time what they were going to say."
Therefore Harvard should have also
provided him with a forum to respond,
Shockley argued.
A recent speech by Shockley at
Wright College in Chicago was dis
rupted by the SDS March 22, and he
charged the incident was clear enough
proof of the radical organization's
irresponsibility.
Planned Speech
If he had traveled to Cambridge,
Shockley planned to present a speech
on the "Geneticity of I.Q. and
Proposed Research on Relations of
Racial Dysgenics in Urban Decay."
Dysgenics is the study of negative
genetic evolution.
SDS is currently active primarily in
the East and Midwest. The group was
involved in weeks of disputes with
Harvard administrators before obtain
ing permission for a national conven
tion there.
