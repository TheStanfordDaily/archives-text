# SRM Protest
## Council Meeting Halted 
### JIM WASCHER 
About 15 members of the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement (SRM) were
met with shouts of "get out of the
room" and "you don't belong here" as
they forced an early adjournment of
Friday's Spring Quarter meeting of the
Academic Council.
The protesters entered the meeting
at 4:30, about 15 minutes after
the scheduled start of the meeting,
during the prepared remarks of Pro
vost William Miller. President Richard
Lyman stepped up to the podium and
told Miller: "I think you've been
interrupted."
Lyman then asked the SRM mem
bers to leave and said, "I do not intend
to proceed until you have left." He
then recessed the meeting for five
minutes to give the protesters the
opportunity to leave. As Young Crow
Pete Knutson approached the podium
to speak, the microphone was turned
off.

Knutson began his statement, but
was almost immediately drowned out
by the loud and often rhythmic
clapping of most of the 150 faculty
and staff members present. Faculty
members also shouted "we don't want
to hear what you have to say."
Paul Loeb, also of the Young
Crows, asked "whatever happened to
the marketplace of ideas?" Both he
and Knutson were suspended for three
quarters last month for their part in
the disruption of a TRW Corporation
interview at the Placement Center last
November.
When the din temporarily subsided,
Computer Science Professor John
McCarthy rose "to move that you ask
the Stanford Police to remove the
visitors." Several in the audience
seconded the motion, but Lyman
made no response. However, at 4:43
Lyman moved in front of the podium,
raised his hands to silence the faculty
and adjourned the meeting.
The Physics Tank cleared rapidly
after the adjournment, but several
faculty members remained and argued
with the protesters.
McCarthy told some of the protes
ters that "the majority of the Univer
sity takes our position, so go to hell."
When the protesters asserted that
McCarthy's research in artificial intel
ligence involved him in genocide,
McCarthy said "we are not involved in
genocide. It is people like you who
start genocide."
Asked why he and the others had

interrupted the meeting, Knutson
mentioned that war research and
racism were being practiced by some
of the faculty. "So what?" responded
History Professor Carl Degler, who
added that since the SRM members
had forced their way into a closed
meeting, "I don't have to listen to
you."
The SRM had planned to present
four demands to the Council. These
included the repeal of the suspensions
of four students, including Knutson
and Loeb, for the November Place
ment Center disruption and a morator
ium on "witch hunt" Campus Judicial
Panel (CJP) hearings.
The demonstrators had also plan
ned to demand the dropping of
burglaiy charges against black activist
Chris Laury arising from a January
"eat-in" at the Faculty Club. The final
SRM demand was to be for the
Academic Council to adopt a "stiff
resolution opposing the influence
over" Stanford "resulting from DoD
[Department of Defense) and NASA
contracting."
When contacted last night by the
Daily, President Lyman said that there
seemed to be a good case for
prosecution of some of those involved
in the demonstration for violation of
University policy. Lyman called the
demonstration "a deplorable situation
all the way around." He added that he
was not sure whether the faculty's
loud mock applause was "the most
useful response" to the demonstration.
