## 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
At least four presidential slates and
six fee assessment referenda face
student voters in the ASSU primary
election April 12 and 13.
Prospective presidential slates and
candidates have until Wednesday to
submit petitions to be put on the
ballot. Four slates have announced
plans to do so. Running for ASSU
president and vice-president respec
tively, are Chris Hocker and Robin
Friedman; running as councils are the
slate of Scott Burke, Elaine Wong,
Brent Appel, and Peter Van Petten;
and the Rocky Barber, Chuck Fay and
Rich Cortez slate.
Members of the Stanford Rehabili
tation Movement (SRM) said yester
day that they are planning to run a
slate of four candidates, but are unsure
who all the members of the proposed
council will be.
Students will also be voting for
Senior Class President, Vice-president
and Business Manager, and three
student members of the Student
Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC).
Runoff Possible
In order to win, candidates and
assessments must receive a majority of
votes cast. If no candidate or assess
ment receives a majority, a runoff

(final) election will be held.
The six referenda on the ballot so
far are fee assessments submitted by a
proposed public law firm called
Citizens Advocates, The ASSU Publi
cations Board, and one by the
Stanford Daily.
The Daily and public law firm
proposed assessments include a refund
clause which provides that any student
who wishes may have his money
refunded.
The last three are fee assessments
submitted by the ASSU, the Office of
Special Events, and KZSU. These three

assessments, if passed, are binding on
each student.
The ASSU program fee referendum
is asking students to vote for either $0
or $1 per quarter for the 1972-73
academic year, with funds to be
divided according to the ASSU Con
stitution. Half the funds would go to
the graduate and undergraduate divi
sional associations and one half to the
programs of the student organizations
as determined by the Student Senate.
Last year the student body voted $0
to the ASSU.
KZSU is asking for $1 per quarter
to finance the operations of the radio
station. Last year students voted
KZSU $1 for fall quarter.
Special Events is asking students to
vote $1 per student per quarter "to be
used for the continuation of concert
productions and other student services
provided by the Office of Special
Events." Special Events was voted $1
per quarter two years ago but did not
ask for any money last year.
Citizens Advocates is asking for
approval of a refundable fee assess
ment of $2 in autumn quarter, $1 in
winter quarter, $2 in spring quarter,
and $1 in summer quarter during each
of the three academic years, 1972-73,
1973-74, and 1974-75."
The Stanford Daily is asking for $1
for fall, winter and summer quarters
for the 1972-73 year "for the purpose
of assisting in the publication of the
Stanford Daily," with refunds avail
able to students.
The Publications Board, which
includes the Sequoia, the Blotter, the
Chaparral, and the Quad, is requesting
$1 for fall quarter, with refunds
similarly available.

According to Frank Miller, former
Publications Board chairman, and
currently editor-in-chief of the Daily,
the two organizations plan to ask the
Student Senate tonight to remove
both referenda questions from the
ballot in favor of one that combines
the two.
If the Senate concurs, the new
proposal will ask for an assessment of
$1 for Pub Board publications other
than the Daily, in addition to $1 for
winter, spring, and summer quarters
for the Daily.
Students may ask to have their fees
refunded separately from either the
Publications Board or the Daily, or
from both. Miller says a refund plan
has been submitted to the ASSU
financial manager for consideration.
