## McCloskey's Drastic Chance 
### 
iim friend

In 1970, Pete McCloskey was
re-elected to Congress by one of
the highest percentages in
America. Despite his opposition
to the President on the war, the
ABM, the SST, and the Timber
Supply Act, McCloskey was
reasonably safe, for on other
issues he had been generally
supportive of the President.
Last month in New Hampshire
McCloskey took a drastic political
chance, he did the politically
unexpedient, he staked his career
on principles and ideals. He
challenged the President in his
own party.
"I would rather give up my

seat in Congress than stand by in
acquiescence", McCloskey says in
his new book. Truth and Untruth.
The best thing about such a
statement is that McCloskey
means it. In a political world
where self-perpetuation seems to
be at a premium, one man had the
courage to jump out of the boat
and swim upstream.
McCloskey hits hard on four
major campaign issues: the War,
the environment, racial
discrimination, and the
restoration of truth in
government. He doesn't
euphemize, couch his statements
in rhetoric, dodge issues. He has

strongly opposed the war since he
has been in Congress,
co-sponsored most of the
important anti-war legislation in
the House, criticized the
President. Yet McCloskey still
doesn't favor a volunteer army. "I
don't know of any reasonable
man who would volunteer for
infantry duty today, even without
Vietnam," he says."And I don't
want an army composed of
unreasonable men."
Consider
Stop for a moment and
consider the courage of such a
stand. How many politicians
today would dare oppose the war
so vehemently and still oppose a
volunteer army? Even Richard
Nixon now favors a volunteer
force, but probably for political
not moral reasons.
When McCloskey first ran for
Congress in a special election in
1967 he took a poll that revealed
that his district was 2-1 in favor of
the war. In direct opposition to
the easy road, he set out to run an
educational campaign in order to
convince the electorate that the
war was wrong and should be
ended. With the facts, McCloskey
won.
Last week McCloskey flew to
Wisconsin to campaign for John
Lindsay for President. Many
thought him a political fool for
such a blatant act. But that's the
kind of consistency McCloskey is
made of. He could have quietly

faded out of the Presidential
picture, but his convictions were
too strong.
In New Hampshire McCloskey
stood out as one of the few
straight talkers in the campaign.
While Muskie and McGovern
bickered over who should reveal
campaign contributions,
McCloskey had little to discuss:
he was the first Presidential
candidate in history to disclose his
contributors. For him it was a
matter of course.
In McCloskey's last
Congressional primary, the
opposition did all that they could
to distort his voting .record and
spread slanderous half-truths
about his positions. McCloskey
remained calm as usual, refused to
join in the political mudslinging.
People have come to expect
nothing less than dirty politics,
but Pete McCloskey continues to
disappoint them.
Instead, McCloskey deals with
facts. To learn about the war, he
has taken three major trips to
Vietnam to see the situation first
hand. For 2 x /i years he wrote to
the President expressing his strong
opposition to the war. "In
Vietnam, we are wrong," he wrote
to President Nixon in March of
1969. "Air strikes destroying
Vietnamese and Cambodian
villages have little relevance to any
ideological battle between
freedom and Communism," he
wrote in May of the following

year. In 1971 he requested "a few
minutes to discuss an alternative
course in Southeast Asia from
that expressed in your recent
speeches." For all of his carefully
considered correspondence to the
President, McCloskey never once
received a reply.
McCloskey abhors the
Administration's treatment of the
war, Nixon's "Southern strategy"
and edict for "minimal
compliance" with Supreme Court
bussing orders, and the near
disregard for our environment.
But one issue bothers him more
than the others: concealment and
deceitfulness in government.
Untruth, half-truth, deliberate
attempts on the part of the
Administration to dupe the
public.
McCloskey points to the
withholding of the Garwin report
by the Administration, a report
which was adverse to the passage
of the SST, to the distortion of
labor unemployment figures and
crime statistics, to concealment of
facts about the bombing in Laos,
to the ITT affair.
McCloskey comes before the
Stanford community today, now
part of his new district, to plead
his case for the Republican
Congressional nomination in the
June primary. It will be a tough
election, but he's not mitigating
his platform in order to woo
votes. Rather, McCloskey feels
that he is right on the issues and
hopes that, through a candid and
honest factual interchange that
voters might come to agree with
him.

America. Despite his opposition
to the President on the war, the
ABM, the SST, and the Timber
Supply Act, McCloskey was
reasonably safe, for on other
issues he had been generally
supportive of the President.
Last month in New Hampshire
McCloskey took a drastic political
chance, he did the politically
unexpedient, he staked his career
on principles and ideals. He
challenged the President in his
own party.
"I would rather give up my

seat in Congress than stand by in
acquiescence", McCloskey says in
his new book. Truth and Untruth.
The best thing about such a
statement is that McCloskey
means it. In a political world
where self-perpetuation seems to
be at a premium, one man had the
courage to jump out of the boat
and swim upstream.
McCloskey hits hard on four
major campaign issues: the War,
the environment, racial
discrimination, and the
restoration of truth in
government. He doesn't
euphemize, couch his statements
in rhetoric, dodge issues. He has

strongly opposed the war since he
has been in Congress,
co-sponsored most of the
important anti-war legislation in
the House, criticized the
President. Yet McCloskey still
doesn't favor a volunteer army. "I
don't know of any reasonable
man who would volunteer for
infantry duty today, even without
Vietnam," he says."And I don't
want an army composed of
unreasonable men."
Consider
Stop for a moment and
consider the courage of such a
stand. How many politicians
today would dare oppose the war
so vehemently and still oppose a
volunteer army? Even Richard
Nixon now favors a volunteer
force, but probably for political
not moral reasons.
When McCloskey first ran for
Congress in a special election in
1967 he took a poll that revealed
that his district was 2-1 in favor of
the war. In direct opposition to
the easy road, he set out to run an
educational campaign in order to
convince the electorate that the
war was wrong and should be
ended. With the facts, McCloskey
won.
Last week McCloskey flew to
Wisconsin to campaign for John
Lindsay for President. Many
thought him a political fool for
such a blatant act. But that's the
kind of consistency McCloskey is
made of. He could have quietly

faded out of the Presidential
picture, but his convictions were
too strong.
In New Hampshire McCloskey
stood out as one of the few
straight talkers in the campaign.
While Muskie and McGovern
bickered over who should reveal
campaign contributions,
McCloskey had little to discuss:
he was the first Presidential
candidate in history to disclose his
contributors. For him it was a
matter of course.
In McCloskey's last
Congressional primary, the
opposition did all that they could
to distort his voting .record and
spread slanderous half-truths
about his positions. McCloskey
remained calm as usual, refused to
join in the political mudslinging.
People have come to expect
nothing less than dirty politics,
but Pete McCloskey continues to
disappoint them.
Instead, McCloskey deals with
facts. To learn about the war, he
has taken three major trips to
Vietnam to see the situation first
hand. For 2 x /i years he wrote to
the President expressing his strong
opposition to the war. "In
Vietnam, we are wrong," he wrote
to President Nixon in March of
1969. "Air strikes destroying
Vietnamese and Cambodian
villages have little relevance to any
ideological battle between
freedom and Communism," he
wrote in May of the following

year. In 1971 he requested "a few
minutes to discuss an alternative
course in Southeast Asia from
that expressed in your recent
speeches." For all of his carefully
considered correspondence to the
President, McCloskey never once
received a reply.
McCloskey abhors the
Administration's treatment of the
war, Nixon's "Southern strategy"
and edict for "minimal
compliance" with Supreme Court
bussing orders, and the near
disregard for our environment.
But one issue bothers him more
than the others: concealment and
deceitfulness in government.
Untruth, half-truth, deliberate
attempts on the part of the
Administration to dupe the
public.
McCloskey points to the
withholding of the Garwin report
by the Administration, a report
which was adverse to the passage
of the SST, to the distortion of
labor unemployment figures and
crime statistics, to concealment of
facts about the bombing in Laos,
to the ITT affair.
McCloskey comes before the
Stanford community today, now
part of his new district, to plead
his case for the Republican
Congressional nomination in the
June primary. It will be a tough
election, but he's not mitigating
his platform in order to woo
votes. Rather, McCloskey feels
that he is right on the issues and
hopes that, through a candid and
honest factual interchange that
voters might come to agree with
him.

reasonably safe, for on other
issues he had been generally
supportive of the President.
Last month in New Hampshire
McCloskey took a drastic political
chance, he did the politically
unexpedient, he staked his career
on principles and ideals. He
challenged the President in his
own party.
"I would rather give up my

seat in Congress than stand by in
acquiescence", McCloskey says in
his new book. Truth and Untruth.
The best thing about such a
statement is that McCloskey
means it. In a political world
where self-perpetuation seems to
be at a premium, one man had the
courage to jump out of the boat
and swim upstream.
McCloskey hits hard on four
major campaign issues: the War,
the environment, racial
discrimination, and the
restoration of truth in
government. He doesn't
euphemize, couch his statements
in rhetoric, dodge issues. He has

strongly opposed the war since he
has been in Congress,
co-sponsored most of the
important anti-war legislation in
the House, criticized the
President. Yet McCloskey still
doesn't favor a volunteer army. "I
don't know of any reasonable
man who would volunteer for
infantry duty today, even without
Vietnam," he says."And I don't
want an army composed of
unreasonable men."
Consider
Stop for a moment and
consider the courage of such a
stand. How many politicians
today would dare oppose the war
so vehemently and still oppose a
volunteer army? Even Richard
Nixon now favors a volunteer
force, but probably for political
not moral reasons.
When McCloskey first ran for
Congress in a special election in
1967 he took a poll that revealed
that his district was 2-1 in favor of
the war. In direct opposition to
the easy road, he set out to run an
educational campaign in order to
convince the electorate that the
war was wrong and should be
ended. With the facts, McCloskey
won.
Last week McCloskey flew to
Wisconsin to campaign for John
Lindsay for President. Many
thought him a political fool for
such a blatant act. But that's the
kind of consistency McCloskey is
made of. He could have quietly

faded out of the Presidential
picture, but his convictions were
too strong.
In New Hampshire McCloskey
stood out as one of the few
straight talkers in the campaign.
While Muskie and McGovern
bickered over who should reveal
campaign contributions,
McCloskey had little to discuss:
he was the first Presidential
candidate in history to disclose his
contributors. For him it was a
matter of course.
In McCloskey's last
Congressional primary, the
opposition did all that they could
to distort his voting .record and
spread slanderous half-truths
about his positions. McCloskey
remained calm as usual, refused to
join in the political mudslinging.
People have come to expect
nothing less than dirty politics,
but Pete McCloskey continues to
disappoint them.
Instead, McCloskey deals with
facts. To learn about the war, he
has taken three major trips to
Vietnam to see the situation first
hand. For 2 x /i years he wrote to
the President expressing his strong
opposition to the war. "In
Vietnam, we are wrong," he wrote
to President Nixon in March of
1969. "Air strikes destroying
Vietnamese and Cambodian
villages have little relevance to any
ideological battle between
freedom and Communism," he
wrote in May of the following

year. In 1971 he requested "a few
minutes to discuss an alternative
course in Southeast Asia from
that expressed in your recent
speeches." For all of his carefully
considered correspondence to the
President, McCloskey never once
received a reply.
McCloskey abhors the
Administration's treatment of the
war, Nixon's "Southern strategy"
and edict for "minimal
compliance" with Supreme Court
bussing orders, and the near
disregard for our environment.
But one issue bothers him more
than the others: concealment and
deceitfulness in government.
Untruth, half-truth, deliberate
attempts on the part of the
Administration to dupe the
public.
McCloskey points to the
withholding of the Garwin report
by the Administration, a report
which was adverse to the passage
of the SST, to the distortion of
labor unemployment figures and
crime statistics, to concealment of
facts about the bombing in Laos,
to the ITT affair.
McCloskey comes before the
Stanford community today, now
part of his new district, to plead
his case for the Republican
Congressional nomination in the
June primary. It will be a tough
election, but he's not mitigating
his platform in order to woo
votes. Rather, McCloskey feels
that he is right on the issues and
hopes that, through a candid and
honest factual interchange that
voters might come to agree with
him.
