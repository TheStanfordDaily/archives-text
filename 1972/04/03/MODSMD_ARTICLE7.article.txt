## Federal Aid Not Panacea 
### 
kimball, fields, mchenry

As was stated at the end of Larry Diamond's article of March 29,
the views expressed are his own and do not represent the council of
presidents. However, because he has touched upon issues with which
we have been concerned as a Council all year, we have found it
necessary to express our views.
It is correct that the future of private education in this country is
in doubt. The student at Stanford can certainly bear witness to the
incredible tuition, room and board rate increases over the last three
years. The obvious extension of such raises is a castration of the
educational process. Education at Stanford will become the province
of the very rich and the very poor. More immediately, innovative
education will be stymied for lack of funding.
However, we view our positions on the Council in a somewhat
different light than does Diamond. First, we feel that it is
presumptuous for us to believe that we were elected by the student
body to cure the financial ills facing American universities today. We
are very much aware of the situation and in our encounters with
others we voice our opinions concerning that situation. However, due
to the many other problems facing this university, and due to our
limited resources of manpower and funding, we as a council find
ourselves limited to what we can accomplish within the realm of
Stanford University.
We feel that the problems facing Stanford will not be eliminated by
the passage of any bill in the National Congress concerning federal
funding of higher education. A bill does not eliminate the cry of the
alumni that the Bruce Franklins must be dismissed from Stanford; it
does not eliminate the excess of committees used by the
administration to hide issues within the university; it does not in any
way deal with the questions of University governance and the concern
of students to have more input into the social and educational issues
facing the university; it does not increase academic freedom; nor does
it do away with institutional racism.
Struggles
Federal funding will perhaps deal with the financial problems of
universities but in our position of Council of Presidents we can only
speak for it. We feel that we cannot give up the struggles to solve
problems within the University in order to help solve the financial
problems of Stanford. For when the financial problems are solved, we
will still face the problems of governance, military research, racism,

academic freedom, student services and all the other issues which exist
on this campus.
We also feel that it is not to the students' advantage to have
student leaders up in front of the crowd urging them to protest a
particular University policy, such as military and war-related industrial
recruiting, and then to desert them when the prospects for
accomplishing something look bad. To desert them and to tell them to
rally around a president who has not granted the students one inch of
ground on any issues is absurd. To desert them and to tell them to
rally around a president whom Mr. Diamond has called a hypocrite in
public is contradictory. To desert them and to tell them to be
concerned with the "larger issues of federal funding for universities" is
absurd. It has been very difficult for students and so-called student
leaders to accomplish much at this university in terms of reforms. It is
even more difficult for us to accomplish anything when we are led and
in the middle of an issue and are deserted.
Concerned
Although we would not presume to categorize ourselves as political
leaders, we nonetheless are concerned about our work as ASSU
Council of Presidents. A very large amount of our time is taken up by
the demands of the office. Returns are slow in coming, progress is
barely perceptible. However, there is a need for student advocacy at
Stanford. That need will remain if we content ourselves with
platitudes about our allegiance to the University and its president.
Our allegiance should not be questioned for it is only change for the
better which we are seeking. We see our position on the council as
student advocates for those changes and not as a launching pad for
national political prominence and publicity.
We only question Diamond's assumptions and presumption. We
feel that the problems facing the university are very important
problems. We feel that we were elected to deal with those problems
on a campus level as well as with conscientious lobbying. We do not
see them as "flash crises," for they have existed at this University for
quite some time, and they need to be dealt with as long term
problems, which need immediate solutions.
We feel that the President of this University and his administration
were selected to deal with all of those problems including funding. We
do not feel that he would be any more efficient or effective if we did
not "deflect his time and attention completely away from large;
problems." These other problems too must be faced, not only by
President Lyman, not only by the Council of Presidents, but also by
Larry Diamond.
In the past year we have done some lobbying on the state level, and
we have begun to pursue membership in the National Student lobby.
Diamond should realize that if he is speaking about effective action,
he should be considering a direction which is more productive than
merely voicing support for President Lyman. Unless we continue to
address ourselves to the myriad of challenges we facing this university,
we will see the decay of Stanford in short order. Whether Diamond
realizes it or not, students must be given a greater voice in this
community, or that decay will occur despite federal dollars.
(Diane Fields, Doug McHenry, and Ann Kimball are members of the
ASSU Council of Presidents.)
