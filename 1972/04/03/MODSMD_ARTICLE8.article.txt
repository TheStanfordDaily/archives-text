Unfair Treatment
(Editor's Note: This column was
originally sent to John Kaplan.)
Dear Professor Kaplan,
We should appreciate your
communicating to the Campus
Judicial Panel the expression of
our concern that the
Administration is continuing to
prosecute Kwonping Ho for an
alleged violation of the
Fundamental Standard arising out
of his participation in the Faculty
Club demonstration of January
24, 1972. We are concerned
because according to the findings
of fact issued by the hearing
officer in Kwonping's case, Mr.
Lesley Minkus, the
Administration failed to prove
that the violation occurred as they
had charged.
The Administration accused
Kwonping of violating the
Fundamental Standard by (1)
assaulting Faculty Club Chef
Arturo Lionetti and (2) forcing
his way into the kitchen of the
Stanford Faculty Club for the
purpose of stealing food from that
kitchen. In his findings of fact,
Mr. Minkus determined that
Kwonping was innocent of the
assault charge and further that
Kwonping neither stole food nor

even "intended to steal food or
any other items at any point
during the demonstration."
We are informed that the
Administration, having failed
entirely to convict on one charge
and having failed to convict as to
an essential element, intent, of the
second charge, may now be
considering making a plea before
the Campus Judicial Panel that
th Panel punish Kwonping
simply for being in the Faculty
Club that evening.
The Faculty Political Action
Group believes that the
imposition of such punishment
would violate concepts of notice,
fair play and due process in that
the punishment would be for acts
other than those Kwonping was
informed were illegal and in
violation of the Fundamental
Standard. The claims to
legitimacy of the Fundamental
Standard and of the entire student
disciplinary procedure are too
tenuous to allow such a
miscarriage of justice to occur.
We therefore request that,
having been found innocent of
assault and of harboring an intent
to steal, Kwonping Ho not receive
any punishment for the activities
of January 24, 1972.
On behalf of the Stanford
Faculty Political Action Group
