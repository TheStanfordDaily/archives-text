# Page Mill Plaza Delay Asked
## 
### BOB BACON 
The controversial office
building—YMCA development at
the Mayfield School site is on the
agenda for the Palo Alto City
Council tonight.
But Stanford officials have
asked them to delay consideration
of the zone change proposal until
April 24.
The site, located on Stanford
land at the corner of El Camino
Real and Page Mill Road,
presently houses a continuation
high school and child care center,
a branch of the United California
Bank, and a Mobil service station.
The University seeks a change
of zone for the property to permit
construction of "Page Mill Plaza,"
consisting of two office buildings,
one of 10 stories and the other of
seven; a new Palo Alto YMCA;
and parking facilities to serve
both.
Planning Commission
On March 22, the City
Planning Commission voted 5-1 to
recommend denial of zone change
and, ergo, abandonment of the
development plans. City Zoning
Administrator James O. Glanville
also has recommended denial of
the application.
Opponents of the project have
pointed to the traffic congestion
the new project would cause at
the corner of El Camino and Page
Mill. It would be located across
Page Mill Road from the

Dillingham-Palo Alto Square
complex.
They also note that the
development would increase the
housing shortage in the area and
would leave the child-care center
without a structure.
The project was proposed last
year, but Stanford withdrew and
revised its application when
substantial opposition developed.
It is the revised application that is
now being considered.
University Land Resources
Manager Boyd C. Smith asked for
the three-week delay in order to
give his office time to "develop
specific answers to some of the
questions raised during the
Planning Commission discussion,"
he wrote in asking for the request.
The Palo Alto Unified School
District would receive $300,000
from the developer if the plan is
approved, in exchange for giving
up its $1 per year lease on the
school site. The school building
and the two other buildings on
the site would be demolished
before construction of the new
buildings began.
At the Planning Commission
hearings, representatives of the
school district, Stanford, and the
development firm were the only
witnesses to speak in favor of the
development. Twelve witnesses
opposed it at one hearing, and
thirteen at the other.
The development is being

managed by "Page Mill Properties,
Inc."
Vacancies
Opponents of the project have
pointed to the high vacancy rates
at other office buildings in the
area, and have therefore
questioned the desirability of
building another similar complex.
University Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert R.
Augsburger told the Daily last
week that Page Mill Square was
"the right kind of development,
just at the wrong time." He
expressed confidence that tenants
would be available when the
building is completed.
The high vacancy rate at Palo
Alto Square, across the street, he
said was due to the fact that the
developers were holding out for
major, long-term tenants.
He noted that Page Mill
Properties already has several
tenants for the new complex.
Opponents also suggested that
Page Mill Square would raise
property values, and hence taxes
and rents, in nearby residential
areas.
Augsburger defended the
location, saying that he felt that it
was appropriate to concentrate on
high-rise buildings along El
Camino.
The council meets tonight at
7:30 p.m. in the City Hall, 250
Hamilton Avenue.

April 24.
The site, located on Stanford
land at the corner of El Camino
Real and Page Mill Road,
presently houses a continuation
high school and child care center,
a branch of the United California
Bank, and a Mobil service station.
The University seeks a change
of zone for the property to permit
construction of "Page Mill Plaza,"
consisting of two office buildings,
one of 10 stories and the other of
seven; a new Palo Alto YMCA;
and parking facilities to serve
both.
Planning Commission
On March 22, the City
Planning Commission voted 5-1 to
recommend denial of zone change
and, ergo, abandonment of the
development plans. City Zoning
Administrator James O. Glanville
also has recommended denial of
the application.
Opponents of the project have
pointed to the traffic congestion
the new project would cause at
the corner of El Camino and Page
Mill. It would be located across
Page Mill Road from the

Dillingham-Palo Alto Square
complex.
They also note that the
development would increase the
housing shortage in the area and
would leave the child-care center
without a structure.
The project was proposed last
year, but Stanford withdrew and
revised its application when
substantial opposition developed.
It is the revised application that is
now being considered.
University Land Resources
Manager Boyd C. Smith asked for
the three-week delay in order to
give his office time to "develop
specific answers to some of the
questions raised during the
Planning Commission discussion,"
he wrote in asking for the request.
The Palo Alto Unified School
District would receive $300,000
from the developer if the plan is
approved, in exchange for giving
up its $1 per year lease on the
school site. The school building
and the two other buildings on
the site would be demolished
before construction of the new
buildings began.
At the Planning Commission
hearings, representatives of the
school district, Stanford, and the
development firm were the only
witnesses to speak in favor of the
development. Twelve witnesses
opposed it at one hearing, and
thirteen at the other.
The development is being

managed by "Page Mill Properties,
Inc."
Vacancies
Opponents of the project have
pointed to the high vacancy rates
at other office buildings in the
area, and have therefore
questioned the desirability of
building another similar complex.
University Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert R.
Augsburger told the Daily last
week that Page Mill Square was
"the right kind of development,
just at the wrong time." He
expressed confidence that tenants
would be available when the
building is completed.
The high vacancy rate at Palo
Alto Square, across the street, he
said was due to the fact that the
developers were holding out for
major, long-term tenants.
He noted that Page Mill
Properties already has several
tenants for the new complex.
Opponents also suggested that
Page Mill Square would raise
property values, and hence taxes
and rents, in nearby residential
areas.
Augsburger defended the
location, saying that he felt that it
was appropriate to concentrate on
high-rise buildings along El
Camino.
The council meets tonight at
7:30 p.m. in the City Hall, 250
Hamilton Avenue.
The controversial office
building—YMCA development at
the Mayfield School site is on the
agenda for the Palo Alto City
Council tonight.
But Stanford officials have
asked them to delay consideration
of the zone change proposal until
April 24.
