# McCloskey Hits Viet Bombing, Urges Republican Registration
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Throughout his day-long visit here
yesterday, Congressman Paul N. (Pete)
McCloskey, Jr. emphasized that the
American people should not allow
President Nixon to respond to the
current Communist offensive in Viet
nam with resumed heavy bombing of
the North.
McCloskey called such bombing
"immoral and unconscionable" since,
he said, Americans no longer believe in
the war enough to be willing to lose
their own lives in ground combat. The
Portola Valley Republican said "just
because Americans aren't dying
doesn't mean that the war is winding
down." He added that "the issue of
the bombing transcends any party or
any candidate."
McCloskey also said that "the only
way I have to survive in Congress is to
convince young people to vote Repub
lican" in the June 6 California
primary. In that primary, McCloskey is
seeking renomination to Congress
from the 17th Congressional District,
which includes Stanford.
McCloskey drew his biggest crowd

of the day when 500-600 heard him
speak at a noon rally in White Plaza.
He was introduced there by former
Black Student Union chairman Leo
Bazile. McCloskey drew audiences of
over one hundred in the Law and
Business School lounges.
Party Switch
Questioned on KZSU's "Close-up"
about the possibility of his switching
political parties, McCloskey said
"there's nothing about the Democratic
Party that gives me very much hope."
He mentioned that it was a Demo
cratic President and Congress which
had initiated American participation in
the Vietnam War. He also complained
that it was a Democratic Congress
which had continued to fund the war.
However, McCloskey did say that
"I've decided I'm going to support the
best man or woman" instead of taking
the party line consistently. He explain
ed that "parties don't mean that much
anymore." He also questioned the
wisdom of switching parties "simply
because one disagrees with that party's
current leadership."
McCloskey said that he could not

support any Presidential candidate
who favored continued U.S. bombing
in Indo-China. He specifically men
tioned President Nixon and Senator
Henry Jackson (D.-Wash.). Of those
candidates still in the race, McCloskey
said New York Mayor John Lindsay
and Senator George McGovern
(D.-S.D.) were his favorites.
McCloskey attacked President
Nixon's position on busing several
times during the day. He said that
Nixon's speech on the issue was
"typical of all that's worst in Ameri
can politics." He explained that "the
thing that has outraged me the most
about the President is the lack of
moral leadership" with regard to
busing.
Busing Acceptable
McCloskey said busing was accept
able to achieve "equal education," but
that it was unacceptable if used solely
to achieve "racial balance."
In discussing his support of the
draft, McCloskey said it is "a far more
protective system to have reluctant
citizen-soldiers" rather than relying
solely upon volunteers, many of whom
"love to. kill."
McCloskey said that "equal protec
tion of the laws" would be denied by a
volunteer army which might attract
the poor who are unable to find other
employment. Regarding those who
have evaded the draft, McCloskey said
"I'd grant amnesty and grant it across
the board."
'Big Money'
The maverick Republican charged
that "the most insidious influence in
America today is the influence of big
money" on politics and government.
He said that the Federal loan to
Lockheed and the ITT gift to the
Republican National Convention
showed that the Republican Party
under Nixon has "turned away from
what was traditional Republican doc
trine" of free enterprise. McCloskey
said the Lockheed loan was "close to
prostitution."

When questioned by the Daily,
McCloskey said he would have voted
for a declaration of war against North
Korea during the Pueblo incident of
1968 had the President requested such
a declaration. He said that he knew the
North Koreans to be "abusive, arro
gant, and merciless" to their prison
ers-of-war.
In explaining his vote against the
women's rights amendment last year,
McCloskey said "it came to us on an
hour's debate. I don't think you want
to amend the Constitution on an
hour's debate." He said a mitigating
factor against the amendment was that
it would include women in the draft.
Nevertheless, McCloskey voted for a
similar amendment this year.
McCloskey is opposed in the
Congressional primary by conserva
tives Royce M. Cole of the Palo Alto
School Board and former New York
Congressman Bob Barry. McCloskey
said that Barry had asked him to run
in the neighboring 11th Congressional
District, assuring him that the White
House would not oppose him.
