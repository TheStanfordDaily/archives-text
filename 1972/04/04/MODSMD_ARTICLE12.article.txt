The Stanford Ice Hockey
Club will play the second of a
best two out of three series
against the Belmont Senior
Team tonight at 8:00 p.m. in
Belmont. Stanford must
win this game in order to
keep alive its hopes for a
playoff with the Berkeley
Juniors in the finals of the
Bay Area Senior Hockey
League.
Berkeley defeated the San
Francisco Seals in two games
while Belmont defeated
Stanford last week, 7-4.
Admission is free.
