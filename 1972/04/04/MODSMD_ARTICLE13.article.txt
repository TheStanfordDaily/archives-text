# Babes In Winterland
## 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
I hope the Ice Follies comes
back to Winterland. Soon. The
barnlike structure houses gliding
skaters far better than wailing
rock musicians. The sound system
fares far better with the sounds of
the big top than the wah-wah
pedals of aspiring rock muses.
After Friday night's concert, it
seems the auditorium finds a true
fulfillment as an ice rink rather
than a concert hall.
All the black lights hanging
from the ceiling of Winterland
should make it sterile and germ
free, but there is an echo of past
glory about the place that all the
day-glo paint in the world can't
muffle.
The building itself seems
something which has mistakenly
survived the wrecker's ball. The
children who once bounced
bright-eyed in their seats during
matinee performances of an ice
show have grown up. Their faces
are no longer bright, their stares
are now vacant.
Amplified Pollution
The concert got rolling with Jo
Jo Gunne. The musicians trotted
on stage and jumped into an ear
splitting barrage of amplified
pollution. Next to the stage, up in
the balcony, or down in the seats
it all sounded the same,
unintelligible noise. Time moved
along, the performers grew louder
and more frenzied, the piano
player leaped up and caressed the
microphone, but I couldn't
believe he was really carried away
by his loud and sloppy melodies.
The set ended and the crowd
demanded more. I couldn't
understand why. Perhaps
something had slipped by me,
something was there in the music
that I couldn't comprehend or
relate to. Copperhead took the
stage and began to perform and I
turned to the task of listening,
more resolute than before to
appreciate the music.
It was an impossible task.
Copperhead appeared much like
Jo Jo Gunne, save the addition of
one guitar player. The lyrics were
slightly more understandable, but
the music was still painfully loud,
the individual players were
competing, not cooperating to
build something musical.
The first two groups proved
too specialized for me; their
appeal extended only to those
who were ripped. Music "for the

people" entertained only those
who drugged themselves for it; it
seemed too painfully loud and
loose for those who didn't.
Musical Odyssey
Three hours into the night Lee
Michaels took the stage. No
gyrating musicians competing for
attention, no hype or phoniness,
just Michaels and his drummer. He
programmed the crowd from the
keyboard of his organ. The
audience heard him perform and
performed for him like puppets
whose strings were attached to his
fingers as they flew across the
keyboard.
The man was a musician, a
captain, a navigator, charting his
course and steering the audience
on a musical odyssey. His fingers
lightly tickled the keyboard and
the notes laughed back. Michaels
used his whole body in his music;
hands, feet, and mind combined
to give the melodies, rhythm, and
counterpoint.
After the encores, the concert
ended and I was lost in thought,
wondering how to manage terms
like tight set, together, good jam,
or funky. I sensed my career as a
rock reviewer would be a one
night stand, I hadn't gotten into
it, I wasn't entertained.
Thoughts churned in my head
about the people who wait all
week so they can groove on five
hours of amplified tunes. I
wondered what talent they
possessed for enjoying Winterland
concerts that I lacked. Even with
the talented music of Lee
Michaels, the evening had been a
wipeout. The only thing I had
liked about Winterland was the
peanuts they sold.
The performance itself hand't
been good. From the police at the
door to the fire marshals
wandering through the hall there
was a business-like aura about
Winterland. Much of the warmth
and fun of concerts had dissipated
into the past. The music knelled a
repetitious dirge for the
Woodstock Nation or flower
children or something. It was
difficult to determine what had
died or when it had gone, but
something was gone from Friday
night's concert that was sorely
needed.
In "Bye Bye Miss American
Pie," Don McLean says the music
died. He isn't talking about rock
music, but he could be.
I hope the Ice Follies comes
back to Winterland. Soon. The
barnlike structure houses gliding
skaters far better than wailing
rock musicians. The sound system

It was an impossible task.
Copperhead appeared much like
Jo Jo Gunne, save the addition of
one guitar player. The lyrics were
slightly more understandable, but
the music was still painfully loud,
the individual players were
competing, not cooperating to
build something musical.
The first two groups proved
too specialized for me; their
appeal extended only to those
who were ripped. Music "for the

people" entertained only those
who drugged themselves for it; it
seemed too painfully loud and
loose for those who didn't.
Musical Odyssey
Three hours into the night Lee
Michaels took the stage. No
gyrating musicians competing for
attention, no hype or phoniness,
just Michaels and his drummer. He
programmed the crowd from the
keyboard of his organ. The
audience heard him perform and
performed for him like puppets
whose strings were attached to his
fingers as they flew across the
keyboard.
The man was a musician, a
captain, a navigator, charting his
course and steering the audience
on a musical odyssey. His fingers
lightly tickled the keyboard and
the notes laughed back. Michaels
used his whole body in his music;
hands, feet, and mind combined
to give the melodies, rhythm, and
counterpoint.
After the encores, the concert
ended and I was lost in thought,
wondering how to manage terms
like tight set, together, good jam,
or funky. I sensed my career as a
rock reviewer would be a one
night stand, I hadn't gotten into
it, I wasn't entertained.
Thoughts churned in my head
about the people who wait all
week so they can groove on five
hours of amplified tunes. I
wondered what talent they
possessed for enjoying Winterland
concerts that I lacked. Even with
the talented music of Lee
Michaels, the evening had been a
wipeout. The only thing I had
liked about Winterland was the
peanuts they sold.
The performance itself hand't
been good. From the police at the
door to the fire marshals
wandering through the hall there
was a business-like aura about
Winterland. Much of the warmth
and fun of concerts had dissipated
into the past. The music knelled a
repetitious dirge for the
Woodstock Nation or flower
children or something. It was
difficult to determine what had
died or when it had gone, but
something was gone from Friday
night's concert that was sorely
needed.
In "Bye Bye Miss American
Pie," Don McLean says the music
died. He isn't talking about rock
music, but he could be.
I hope the Ice Follies comes
back to Winterland. Soon. The
barnlike structure houses gliding
skaters far better than wailing
rock musicians. The sound system
fares far better with the sounds of
the big top than the wah-wah
pedals of aspiring rock muses.
After Friday night's concert, it
seems the auditorium finds a true
fulfillment as an ice rink rather
than a concert hall.
All the black lights hanging
from the ceiling of Winterland
should make it sterile and germ
free, but there is an echo of past
glory about the place that all the
day-glo paint in the world can't
muffle.
The building itself seems
something which has mistakenly
survived the wrecker's ball. The
children who once bounced
bright-eyed in their seats during
matinee performances of an ice
show have grown up. Their faces
are no longer bright, their stares
are now vacant.
Amplified Pollution
The concert got rolling with Jo
Jo Gunne. The musicians trotted
on stage and jumped into an ear
splitting barrage of amplified
pollution. Next to the stage, up in
the balcony, or down in the seats
it all sounded the same,
unintelligible noise. Time moved
along, the performers grew louder
and more frenzied, the piano
player leaped up and caressed the
microphone, but I couldn't
believe he was really carried away
by his loud and sloppy melodies.
The set ended and the crowd
demanded more. I couldn't
understand why. Perhaps
something had slipped by me,
something was there in the music
that I couldn't comprehend or
relate to. Copperhead took the
stage and began to perform and I
turned to the task of listening,
more resolute than before to
appreciate the music.
It was an impossible task.
