# Hollywood And Brando Come Back
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
In its capsule summary of New
York critical opinion, The New
York Times reported that "The
Godfather" received eighteen
favorable reviews, two mixed and
one unfavorable. Such virtual
unanimity for any film, much less
a Hollywood entertainment, was,
to my knowledge, unprecedented.
(Even a new Bergman is not
received so thunderously).
However, the critics outdid
themselves only the following
week, when the Times tallied
nineteen favorable reviews and
one mixed for Marcel Ophuls'
incisive marathon documentary,
"The Sorrow and the Pity."
Also unprecedented was
Paramount's decision to book the
film simultaneously into five
major New York theatres,
including the piggyback Loew's
One and Two on Broadway. In its
first week, "The Godfather"
grossed $454,000 in New York,
selling out at every performance
at each theatre and, as in every
other city, breaking all existing
box office records.
At the moment, Paramount is
predicting an eventual gross of
$100 million, which would not
only double the take of the
company's own "Love Story" but
would install "The Godfather" as
by far the biggest money-making
film of all-time. Mario Puzo is just
now putting the finishing touches
on a screenplay tentatively titled,
'The Death of Michael Corleone."
Brilliant Promo Job
"The Godfather" has been the
benefactor of one of the
shrewdest and most effective long
range promotional plans ever
devised. Puzo's novel has sold in
the neighborhood of nine million
copies and, so the story goes,
public interest in the casting of
the movie paralleled that
surrounding "Gone With the
Wind" thirty years earlier.
Over the initial objections of
studio heads, Brando got the title
role on the basis of an
extraordinary screen test, though
at least two of the original
contenders for the part, John
Marley and Richard Costellano,
remain in the film in highly
effective but smaller capacities.
It was a closed set, newsmen
were forbidden to photograph the
star's "new" face, the film makers
agreed not to use the word
"Mafia," Joe Colombo was shot
(whatever happened to Joe
Colombo?) and Paramount,
finally realizing the potential of
its property, upped the budget to
six million dollars to make it a
class production rather than an
exploitation item.
The release date was put off
from December to March and in
one week, Brando made the cover
of Newsweek and Life (raves were
inside, as well as in Time). Pauline
Kael, not totally inaptly,
compared Francis Ford Coppola
to Renoir, Jean-Pierre Melville's
excellent "Le Samourai" was
rushed on the market as "The
Godson," the Italian-American
Unification Council, in protest,
bought all the tickets to the
Kansas City premiere so that the
film would open to an empty
house, and"The Godfather" was
on its way.
I've been desperately waiting
for years for what could
legitimately be called Marlon
Brando's comeback picture. This
is decidedly it, but while most of
the pictures he's appeared in over

the last ten years have been
disappointing and have invariably
lost money, it is worth
remembering that Brando's own
work in these films has often been
fascinating.
I'm probably the only person
who actually sat through "Mutiny
on the Bounty" three times but
am not alone in finding his work
both as an actor and director in
"One-Eyed Jacks" compelling and
even haunting.
I thought his paunchiness and
sluggishness in "Reflections in a
Golden Eye" depressing (though
many critics admired his
performance) but just three years
ago in the minor "The Night of
the Following Day,"he dyed his
hair blond and trimmed down to
the point where he looked not a
day over 25 and still prepared to
hop on a motorcycle at a
moment's notice.
"Bum!" was as admirable as it

was uneven and the current "The
Nightcomers" is bad period, but
with "The Godfather" under his
belt, Brando is now shooting
"Last Tango in Paris" for
Bernardo Bertolucci.
Commanding Presence
Brando's introduction in "The
Godfather" is brilliantly managed,
as a receding camera reveals from
the rear a mysterious figure
hearing the pleas of an undertaker
for revenge on some thugs who
have brutalized his daughter. The
first full-front shot of Brando as
the listening Godfather is
breathtaking, but I was
immediately thrown off balance
by his strong hands methodically
stroking a light colored cat, which
reminded me of nothing more
than the trademark of Blofeld in
the Bond films, and by a
high-pitched raspy voice I could
hardly understand.
The subsequent wedding party

sequence is fairly lax. But with
the first scene between Brando
and A 1 Martino as Johnny
Fontane/Frank Sinatra, the film
gains momentum and takes hold,
never to let go.
It's been cynically joked that
when Brando is nominated for an
Academy Award next year, as he
must be, it should be for Best
Supporting Actor rather than Best
Actor, for during the middle third
of the film, he is totally absent
from the screen. However,
Brando's presence dominates and
shadows every scene in the film
and the effect he makes in one
scene carries over to innumerable
subsequent scenes in which he
does not appear.
A testament to his power is
that after his moving death scene
(about twenty minutes before the
film ends), the film seems just a
bit less special and important. In
short, Brando looms.
Way of Life
What makes "The Godfather"
a tremendous film, however, is
that it confronts and explores
thoroughly specific and evolved
human behavior and ritual, a way
of life. Milieu and mannerisms are
quickly established and gradually
the details are filled in until what
we are left with is an epic not
only in length but in treatment
and texture.
'The Godfather" builds and
ultimately conveys the kind of
cumulative effect that only a film
with many characters and
extended length, such as
"Children of Paradise" or "Gone
With the Wind," can possess. Time
is taken for everything—
traditional exposition, character
development, set pieces, spectacle.
The period of the film—the
mid-forties through the
mid-fifties—is one largely unused
in films today and is evoked not
only through costume and set
design (and the marvellous old
cars) but by some amazing
panorama shots of New York,
Hollywood and Las Vegas that,
because of the extensive
architectural changes in those
cities over the past twenty years,
can only be stock footage which,
even so, flawlessly blend with the
texture of the rest of the film.
Coppola Rides High
Francis Ford Coppola's
previous films ("You're a Big Boy
Now," "Finian's Rainbow") were
marred by the sixties' penchant
for zooms and fancy cutting. He
is, however, currently riding high,
not only with "The Godfather"
but with his hit "Private Lives" at
the ACT and his forthcoming
assignment to direct next fall at
the San Francisco Opera.
His direction of "The
Godfather" is absolutely
controlled and confident, as he
uses long, steady takes, no

noticeable zooms and (like
Renoir) composes shots filled
with much detail at medium
length to allow the viewer to
discover what he will in the frame.
This is especially commendable
in a period film, where often
production design (to show off
the care administered to detail
and authenticity through big
spending) will be shoved in your
face. Coppola even employes the
newspapers-hot-off-the-press
montage technique, and it's so
natural that it's almost as if the
last twenty-five years of film
making didn't exist.
Michael is Superb
Al Pacino was good but
excessively Dustin-Hoffman-ish in
"Panic in Needle Park" last
summer. But his performance in
"The Godfather" confirms the
promise of his superb work in
"Does the Tiger Wear a Necktie?"
on Broadway a few seasons back.
Pacino, as Michael, the Don's
son, is on camera longer than
anyone else and though Brando
dominates everything, plays the
character who undergoes the
greatest change from beginning to
end.
Michael's gradual assimilation
into the family structure and
assumption of control is
accompanied by a growing
coldness and increasing distance
from those around him until, in
the film's memorably quiet final
shot, he is ensconsed in his office
with his business associates, out of
the reach even of his wife. Pacino
manages the transition
beautifully, starting off close to
Dustin Hoffman again and and
ending up resembling no one more
than Alain Delon.
"The Godfather" is practically
a model of perfect casting.
Richard Castellano, John Marley,
Richard Conte, Sterling Hayden,
John Cazale and especially James
Caan and Robert Duvall
constitute a memorable gallery of
faces and performances. Only
Diane Keaton as Michael's wife
provides a weak link, and it's
reported that Coppola had to cut
around her to make her come off
decently.
Nino Rota's score is his best in
years, staying effectively in the
background most of the time but
flowering in the beautiful Sicilian
sequences to approach the
ominous romanticism of Georges
Delerue's best scores.
Puzo's novel may have been
great trash but the film is great
entertainment to which no
debasing qualifications need be
attached. It's another piece of
evidence that the best films often
are made from novels of less than
distinguished literary
accomplishment. "The
Godfather" is Hollywood in its
prime again—finally!
