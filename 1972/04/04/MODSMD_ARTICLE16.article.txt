ITT Tax Disputed
WASHINGTON — A financial
statement on file at the Securities and
Exchange Commission appeared
yesterday to support International
Telephone & Telegraph Corp's
contention that it paid income taxes
for the years a presidential candidate
alleged it paid none.
Sen. George McGovern said Sunday
the giant conglomerate, with gross
revenue in 1970 of more than $6
billion, paid no federal income taxes in
1968, 1969 or 1970.
The South Dakota Democrat said
he based his assertion on reports on
file at the SEC.
But the financial statements on file
at the SEC were examined by the
Associated Press and they listed figures
that seemed to agree with those issued
by an ITT spokesman in New York in
response to McGovern.
Photographer Testifies
SAN JOSE — A photographer who
snapped pictures during a deadly
convict escape attempt two years ago
testified yesterday at the Angela Davis
trial that one convict demanded
release of the Soledad Brothers.
James Kean, a photographer for the

San Rafael Independent Journal, said
he stopped to jot in his notebook the
words "Soledad Brothers."
Kean told of seeing convicts
herding a judge and four hostages
down a courthouse hallway. He said he
started clicking his shutter, taking
perhaps 20 to 30 pictures within a few
minutes.
As the group moved past him
toward an elevator, Kean said convict
James McClain told him: "Tell them
we want the Soledad Brothers released
by 12 o'clock."
Strike Continues
NEW YORK — Baseball's owners
rejected Monday night a proposal
made earlier in the day by the striking
Major League Baseball Players
Association in an effort to end the
sport's first general player strike.
John Gaherin, the owners'
negotiator, said he had been
authorized to tell Marvin Miller,
executive director of the players'
association, that Miller's settlement
offer had been rejected.
Baseball's owners have been
summoned to a meeting in Chicago
Tuesday.
Asked what chances there were of
settling the strike before Wednesday's

scheduled opening game, Miller replied
flatly: "None."
Allies Halt Invasion
SAIGON — A South Vietnamese
commander said today the North
Vietnamese invasion has been halted as
the allies launched a massive
counteroffensive including amphibious
landings across South Vietnam's
northern front. The U.S. Navy
committed its biggest force since the
1968 bombing halt.
The 7th Fleet assembled at least
four aircraft carriers and four
destroyers to back up 20,000 South
Vietnamese ground troops. Another
5,000 South Vietnamese
reinforcements were ordered to the
northern front.
Overcast skies had hampered
operations of the attack jets, but
sources said massive raids against
North Vietnam were imminent in
retaliation for the biggest enemy push
since the Tet offensive of 1968.
Some American jets also crossed
into North Vietnam to hit
surface-to-air missile sites five miles
above the DMZ.
On the southern side of the DMZ,
four American aircraft were shot down
by antiaircraft fire. Eight American
crewmen were missing and feared
dead.
Nixon Ponders Attack
WASHINGTON — Administration
officials left open yesterday a wide
range of options—including possible air
attacks on North Vietnam or the use
of U.S. ground forces—as President
Nixon pondered ways to counter the
thrust of enemy forces in South
Vietnam.
At the White House and State
Department, spokesmen would not
discuss specific steps Nixon might
order but said, "All options are open,"
when asked whether bombing sorties
or deployment of American troops
were possible.
