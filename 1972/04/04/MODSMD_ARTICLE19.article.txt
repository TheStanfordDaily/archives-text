# Wisconsin Vote Tests Democratic Hopefuls
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Wisconsin voters will go to the polls
today in a primary that may well thin
the ranks of Democratic presidential
contenders.
Twelve Democrats and three Re
publicans will vie for the 67 Demo
cratic and 28 GOP delegate seats at
stake.
President Nixon is a virtual cinch to
sweep the Republicans. He faces only
token opposition from Rep. John
Ashbrook of Ohio and Rep. Paul
McCloskey of California, who has
since withdrawn from the race.
Conceded to be the Democratic
front-runners are Sen. Hubert Hum
phrey of Minnesota and Sen. George
McGovern of South Dakota, for either
of whom a Wisconsin victory would
provide a tremendous boost.
Muskie
Sen. Edmund Muskie of Maine also
would dearly love to pull out a
victory, but would score a moral
victory if he could drive a wedge in
between Humphrey and McGovern in
whatever order they finish.
Muskie derives his greatest strength
from the largely Polish working class
wards of Milwaukee. McGovern, who
boasts the best campaign organization,
is counting on a large plurality from
the college community surrounding
Madison, while Humphrey figures to
do well among the farmers and other
rural inhabitants of the state, and
among organized labor.
In the role of spoilers stand Gov.
George Wallace of Alabama and Sen.
Henry Jackson of Washington. In
1964, running against an unpopular
favorite-son stand-in for Lyndon John
son, Wallace won 34 percent of the
Wisconsin primary vote. But in the
1968 general election, running as a
third party candidate for president,
Wallace captured just eight percent.
Jackson, who finished a surprising
third in the Florida primary, will again
be shooting for a high finish. But if the
Southerner Wallace can beat the
Northerner Jackson in a Northern

state, it would establish Wallace as the
undisputed king of the Democratic
right wing and could cripple Jackson's
campaign.
Victory Needed
Muskie does not need a victory so
much as he needs to avoid another
humiliation like Florida. He would be
satisfied, if not pleased, by a third
place finish, although fourth place
could be disastrous.
Barring a surprisingly strong show
ing, Wisconsin may be the end of the
line for New York Mayor John
Lindsay. Money has been scarce for
Lindsay, and he has been unable to
afford the kind of media campaign
that he functions best with. For
publicity, he has been reduced to
spending the night in the home of a
Milwaukee steelworker.
Jackson too may be a campaign
casualty without a strong finish, and
former Sen. Eugene McCarthy, Rep.
Wilbur Mills, and Rep. Shirley Chis
holm are all in need of a big boost if
they are to continue.
Other Democrats on the ballot are
Rep. Patsy Mink of Hawaii, Sen.
Vance Hartke of Indiana, and Mayor
Sam Yorty of Los Angeles. Yorty and
Hartke have since dropped out of the
national race.
Eleven convention delegates will be
awarded to the state-wide winner
today, with the remaining 56 being
allotted by individual congressional
districts.

Henry Jackson of Washington. In
1964, running against an unpopular
favorite-son stand-in for Lyndon John
son, Wallace won 34 percent of the
Wisconsin primary vote. But in the
1968 general election, running as a
third party candidate for president,
Wallace captured just eight percent.
Jackson, who finished a surprising
third in the Florida primary, will again
be shooting for a high finish. But if the
Southerner Wallace can beat the
Northerner Jackson in a Northern

state, it would establish Wallace as the
undisputed king of the Democratic
right wing and could cripple Jackson's
campaign.
Victory Needed
Muskie does not need a victory so
much as he needs to avoid another
humiliation like Florida. He would be
satisfied, if not pleased, by a third
place finish, although fourth place
could be disastrous.
Barring a surprisingly strong show
ing, Wisconsin may be the end of the
line for New York Mayor John
Lindsay. Money has been scarce for
Lindsay, and he has been unable to
afford the kind of media campaign
that he functions best with. For
publicity, he has been reduced to
spending the night in the home of a
Milwaukee steelworker.
Jackson too may be a campaign
casualty without a strong finish, and
former Sen. Eugene McCarthy, Rep.
Wilbur Mills, and Rep. Shirley Chis
holm are all in need of a big boost if
they are to continue.
Other Democrats on the ballot are
Rep. Patsy Mink of Hawaii, Sen.
Vance Hartke of Indiana, and Mayor
Sam Yorty of Los Angeles. Yorty and
Hartke have since dropped out of the
national race.
Eleven convention delegates will be
awarded to the state-wide winner
today, with the remaining 56 being
allotted by individual congressional
districts.
Wisconsin voters will go to the polls
today in a primary that may well thin
the ranks of Democratic presidential
contenders.
Twelve Democrats and three Re
publicans will vie for the 67 Demo
cratic and 28 GOP delegate seats at
stake.
President Nixon is a virtual cinch to
sweep the Republicans. He faces only
token opposition from Rep. John
Ashbrook of Ohio and Rep. Paul
McCloskey of California, who has
since withdrawn from the race.
Conceded to be the Democratic
front-runners are Sen. Hubert Hum
phrey of Minnesota and Sen. George
McGovern of South Dakota, for either
of whom a Wisconsin victory would
provide a tremendous boost.
Muskie
Sen. Edmund Muskie of Maine also
would dearly love to pull out a
victory, but would score a moral
victory if he could drive a wedge in
between Humphrey and McGovern in
whatever order they finish.
Muskie derives his greatest strength
from the largely Polish working class
wards of Milwaukee. McGovern, who
boasts the best campaign organization,
is counting on a large plurality from
the college community surrounding
Madison, while Humphrey figures to
do well among the farmers and other
rural inhabitants of the state, and
among organized labor.
In the role of spoilers stand Gov.
George Wallace of Alabama and Sen.
Henry Jackson of Washington. In
1964, running against an unpopular
favorite-son stand-in for Lyndon John
son, Wallace won 34 percent of the
Wisconsin primary vote. But in the
1968 general election, running as a
