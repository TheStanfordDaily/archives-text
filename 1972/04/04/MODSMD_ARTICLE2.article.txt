# Nursing Growth Plan Held Up
## 
### CRAIG MALLOY 
A proposal for expanding Stanford
University's nursing school cannot be
implemented at this time for financial
reasons, according to Dean Clayton
Rich of the School of Medicine.
Rich stated that the proposal as a
whole, which includes granting an M.S.
and Ph.D. in nursing, was "unrealistic"
in view of the other priorities and
financial constraints facing the Med
School and University at this time.
A major item included in the
proposed program, not necessarily
requiring more money, is to shorten
the present five-year nursing curricu
lum to four years. This will be
followed only in part, as no students
are being accepted for next Septem
ber's incoming class at the nursing
school.
But the non-acceptance of students
for next year's class at the nursing
school does not automatically mean
the program is being cut to four years.
The proposal to initiate a four year
program was one of many recommen
dations in a thorough study of the
nursing school, completed last fall.
Dean Rich now has appointed a
committee to consider the study,
planning for the Future of Nursing
Education at Stanford University, and
to make recommendations on the Med
School's proper role in nursing educa
tion.
High Priority
The original study of last fall
identifies three "high priority" needs
at Stanford: the preparation of profes
sors, teachers, researchers and adminis
trators in the Held of nursing; the
preparation of high-quality clinical
nurses; and the continued education of
nurses in the Stanford area.
The change from five to four years
is the obvious feature of the proposed
program. The change to four years
would bring Stanford into line with
most schools. Presently a woman
spends two years as an undergraduate
at Stanford or elsewhere completing
prerequisites in general chemistry,

humanities and social sciences.
The next three years are currently
devoted to nine major nursing classes,
each usually 10 units and taken one
per quarter in addition to electives. To
shorten the program to four years
either a year of undergraduate study
or a year at the nursing school will be
eliminated.
But the proposed changes in the
program are not a simple reduction of
required classes. Dean Rich says,
"Personally, I'd welcome a more
fundamental change than reduction of
curriculum." He believes the new
program will reflect an essential
revaluation of the role of nurses in
medicine and health care.
More Responsibility Desired
Rich explains that "Nursing is in
transition." Nurses as a part of the
health care process are not involved to
their full potential, and many nurses
feel that they should have more
responsibility for the care of the
patient. Because of increased speciali
zation on the part of many doctors,
Rich hopes to see more medical
decisions made by nurses.
Grace Ringressy, Director of the
School of Nursing, feels that a four
year program would put available
money and time to better use, and
that a four year program could still
accomplish the goals of the nursing
school. Dean Rich concurs.
To facilitate the implementation of
the proposed four year program, if
approved, there will not be a new class
of students entering the nursing school

during the fall of 1972. During that
year the goals and curriculum of the
school will be revised.
The proposed nursing curriculum,
Rich hopes, will be designed with help
from doctors, nurses, and nursing and
medical students as well as from
instructors and professors from the
schools of medicine and nursing.
Curriculum Goal
Making complete use of educational
facilities at the medical center and on
the main campus is a goal of the
proposed curriculum. Medical students
and nurses will take some classes
together, and some nursing classes of
