# Pot Legalization Sought
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ News Analysis 
President Nixon seems to be having
trouble with his special study commis
sions. Previously he has rejected the
findings of the National Commission
on Obscenity and Pornography, which
found that pornographic literature was
not damaging the nation's moral
standards. He also dismissed the
conclusions of an oil import quota
commission that recommended in
creased quotas. Now he has dismissed
the report made by his Commission on
Marijuana and Drug Abuse.
The report maintains that the use
of marijuana does not lead to the use
of hard drugs in a majority of cases.
No significant connection between

crime and marijuana was uncovered. In
fact, it was suggested that looser
restrictions on marijuana might actual
ly aid in decreasing violent crime by
taking "the young marijuana user out
of a criminal drug-use culture."
The commission has recommended
that the private use of marijuana be
legalized, but that the sale, and
possession with intent to sell remain
illegal.
Stanford Law Professor John Kap
lan, a member of the International
Commission on Marijuana, predicted
correctly six weeks ago the recommen
dations of the President's Commission.
Kaplan believes that "while the recom
mendations are a great deal better than
the present policy, quite frankly, they

will not be enough." He maintains that
the legalization of marijuana for
private use would alleviate "the
alienation of a whole young generation
from the law."
Referendum Effort
Currently, there is a statewide drive
in progress to put a proposal such as
the President's commission has sug
gested, on the November ballot. The
referendum proposal, which needs
about 330,000 petition signatures in
order to be placed on the ballot, was
submitted to the State Attorney
General for approval on December 15
of last year. The collection of
signatures began February 1. Presently
the California Marijuana Initiative
(CMI) has about 100,000 signatures on
its petition which reads:
"No person in the state of Califor
nia 18 years of age or older shall be
punished criminally or be denied any
right or privilege by reason of such
person's planting, cultivation, harvest
ing, drying, processing, otherwise pre
paring, transporting or possessing mari
juana for personal use."
Last week the proposal received the
official support of the Berkeley City
Council, which voted 8 to 1 to support
CMI.
The Campus Coordinator of the
CMI, freshman Charmaine Berry says
that the movement is really "not just a
movement of dopers. It's really a
people's movement."
Berry also stated that she believes
the referendum will have the added
side effect of inducing many more of
the newly enfranchised voters to
register and to vote in the November
elections.
Professor Kaplan doesn't believe
that the referendum proposal will pass
this year, but gives it a fair chance to
succeed by 1974. Ultimately he thinks
pot will be sold "like alcohol at your
neighborhood drugstore." Kaplan is
very much against the idea of having
the government selling the drug: "the
government isn't efficient. Just look at
the post office."

correctly six weeks ago the recommen
dations of the President's Commission.
Kaplan believes that "while the recom
mendations are a great deal better than
the present policy, quite frankly, they

will not be enough." He maintains that
the legalization of marijuana for
private use would alleviate "the
alienation of a whole young generation
from the law."
Referendum Effort
Currently, there is a statewide drive
in progress to put a proposal such as
the President's commission has sug
gested, on the November ballot. The
referendum proposal, which needs
about 330,000 petition signatures in
order to be placed on the ballot, was
submitted to the State Attorney
General for approval on December 15
of last year. The collection of
signatures began February 1. Presently
the California Marijuana Initiative
(CMI) has about 100,000 signatures on
its petition which reads:
"No person in the state of Califor
nia 18 years of age or older shall be
punished criminally or be denied any
right or privilege by reason of such
person's planting, cultivation, harvest
ing, drying, processing, otherwise pre
paring, transporting or possessing mari
juana for personal use."
Last week the proposal received the
official support of the Berkeley City
Council, which voted 8 to 1 to support
CMI.
The Campus Coordinator of the
CMI, freshman Charmaine Berry says
that the movement is really "not just a
movement of dopers. It's really a
people's movement."
Berry also stated that she believes
the referendum will have the added
side effect of inducing many more of
the newly enfranchised voters to
register and to vote in the November
elections.
Professor Kaplan doesn't believe
that the referendum proposal will pass
this year, but gives it a fair chance to
succeed by 1974. Ultimately he thinks
pot will be sold "like alcohol at your
neighborhood drugstore." Kaplan is
very much against the idea of having
the government selling the drug: "the
government isn't efficient. Just look at
the post office."
President Nixon seems to be having
trouble with his special study commis
sions. Previously he has rejected the
findings of the National Commission
on Obscenity and Pornography, which
found that pornographic literature was
not damaging the nation's moral
standards. He also dismissed the
conclusions of an oil import quota
commission that recommended in
creased quotas. Now he has dismissed
the report made by his Commission on
Marijuana and Drug Abuse.
The report maintains that the use
of marijuana does not lead to the use
of hard drugs in a majority of cases.
No significant connection between

crime and marijuana was uncovered. In
fact, it was suggested that looser
restrictions on marijuana might actual
ly aid in decreasing violent crime by
taking "the young marijuana user out
of a criminal drug-use culture."
The commission has recommended
that the private use of marijuana be
legalized, but that the sale, and
possession with intent to sell remain
illegal.
Stanford Law Professor John Kap
lan, a member of the International
Commission on Marijuana, predicted
