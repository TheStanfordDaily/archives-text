# Diamond Quits Presidency
## 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
ASSU Council of Presidents mem
ber Larry Diamond announced his
resignation yesterday saying that he
plans to work full time on the
campaign of Democratic congressional

candidate Jim Stewart.
In a statement released last night,
Diamond said, "My feeling about the
directions of this country in 1972, and
my view of my personal responsi
bilities require that I make this
campaign my first priority in the next
two months. Therefore, as I have
dropped out of school this Spring
Quarter, so I must now announce my
resignation from the Council of
Presidents."
Three Weeks Left
Diamond resigned with less than
three weeks left before the next ASSU
presidential election. However, he said
that, "these are still weeks in which
the members of the Council should be
continuing to devote a major portion
of their time to the ASSU. I cannot
make that time commitment."
When asked about rumors that
"in-fighting" within the Council of
Presidents led him to make the
decision to resign, Diamond said, "It
has nothing to do with my resigning. It
is fair to say, though, that we have
developed differences in perception

over the whole range of problems
facing the University, but I wouldn't
really characterize it as in-fighting. We
just express different opinions."
Doug McHenry, Diane Fields, and
Anne Kimball, the three remaining
members of the Council plan to release
a joint statement concerning Dia
mond's resignation sometime today.
'Interesting Person'
President Richard Lyman said of
Diamond's resignation,"I find Larry a
very interesting person. I must say
though, that I am in a precarious
position to comment about Larry after
the column he just wrote, as I really
did appreciate it. But, there are other
reasons for thinking he's a good
guy ... So, he's going to work full
time in that's certainly
putting your money where your
mouth is."
Diamond is the third student body
president to resign in the last six years.
David Harris resigned in March of
1967, as did Peter Lyman in Novem
ber of that same year.
