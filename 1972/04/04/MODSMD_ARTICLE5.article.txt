# Lyman Proposal
## Student Senate Okays Mascot Compromise 
### 
Disagreement between the Univer
sity Administration and the ASSU
Council of Presidents over the elimina
tion of the Indian as the Stanford
mascot has finally been resolved.
Doug McHenry, a member of the
Council of Presidents, explained to the
Senate that President Lyman had
proposed that the committee appoint
ed to deal with the mascot issue meet
"informally" to discuss the Indian
mascot elimination. It would not,
however, have any power to change
the Student Senate decision to elimi
nate the mascot.

The informal meeting would only
provide "a forum for consultation" on
the Indian mascot according to Presi
dent Lyman. Bill Stone, assistant to
Lyman, indicated that Lyman would
explain why he felt the Indian mascot
should be eliminated and listen to
opinions the committee members
might have.
After this meeting, Lyman is
expected to formally announce that
the Indian has been eliminated as the
Stanford mascot.
The committee will then meet
formally to start the selection process
for a new mascot.
Last February the Student Senate
voted to eliminate the Indian as the
Stanford mascot and appointed a
committee to select a new mascot.
Disagreement arose with the Presi
dent's office when Lyman indicated
that the Senate action did not
formally change the mascot.
In a letter to McHenry last week,
Lyman reiterated his personal feeling
that the Indian mascot should be

eliminated and suggested the com
promise.
McHenry told the Senate that the
compromise is fine "as long as it is
clear that it is not a review committee
and doesn't make any formal recom
mendation" on the elimination of the
Indian mascot.
The Senate unanimously approved
the compromise.
The committee, composed of stu
dents, alumni, and an athletic depart
ment representative, is expected to
start considering a new mascot soon.
Also at the Senate meeting McHen
ry announced that all student organi
zations wishing to receive money from
the ASSU in the event that the ASSU
referendum asking for $1 per quarter
passes, must submit proposed budgets
to Financial Manager Tom Huseby for
review.
The Senate also passed an amend
ment to the Constitution which waives
the requirement that student organiza
tions be incorporated with the Dean of
Students office no later than Decem

ber of the previous year before they
can receive any ASSU program fee
money.
Under New Business, the Senate
put the Publications Board and the
Stanford Daily's proposed fee referen
dum on the ballot. The new referen
dum combines the two previous
referenda proposed by the groups and
now asks for an assessment of $1 for
Pub Board publications other than the
Daily, in addition to $1 for winter,
spring, and summer quarters for the
Daily.
The Senate also took up the matter
of the refund process included as an
option in two of the referenda on the
ballot, that of Citizens Advocates, and
the Publications Board-Stanford Daily.
The Senate decided that students
wishing to have their money refunded
by either the Advocates, the Pub
Board, or the Daily, could collect their
money in cash fall quarter, for a
period of two weeks in a centrally
located place, probably in the offices
of the ASSU located in Tresidder
Union.

proposed that the committee appoint
ed to deal with the mascot issue meet
"informally" to discuss the Indian
mascot elimination. It would not,
however, have any power to change
the Student Senate decision to elimi
nate the mascot.

The informal meeting would only
provide "a forum for consultation" on
the Indian mascot according to Presi
dent Lyman. Bill Stone, assistant to
Lyman, indicated that Lyman would
explain why he felt the Indian mascot
should be eliminated and listen to
opinions the committee members
might have.
After this meeting, Lyman is
expected to formally announce that
the Indian has been eliminated as the
Stanford mascot.
The committee will then meet
formally to start the selection process
for a new mascot.
Last February the Student Senate
voted to eliminate the Indian as the
Stanford mascot and appointed a
committee to select a new mascot.
Disagreement arose with the Presi
dent's office when Lyman indicated
that the Senate action did not
formally change the mascot.
In a letter to McHenry last week,
Lyman reiterated his personal feeling
that the Indian mascot should be

eliminated and suggested the com
promise.
McHenry told the Senate that the
compromise is fine "as long as it is
clear that it is not a review committee
and doesn't make any formal recom
mendation" on the elimination of the
Indian mascot.
The Senate unanimously approved
the compromise.
The committee, composed of stu
dents, alumni, and an athletic depart
ment representative, is expected to
start considering a new mascot soon.
Also at the Senate meeting McHen
ry announced that all student organi
zations wishing to receive money from
the ASSU in the event that the ASSU
referendum asking for $1 per quarter
passes, must submit proposed budgets
to Financial Manager Tom Huseby for
review.
The Senate also passed an amend
ment to the Constitution which waives
the requirement that student organiza
tions be incorporated with the Dean of
Students office no later than Decem

ber of the previous year before they
can receive any ASSU program fee
money.
Under New Business, the Senate
put the Publications Board and the
Stanford Daily's proposed fee referen
dum on the ballot. The new referen
dum combines the two previous
referenda proposed by the groups and
now asks for an assessment of $1 for
Pub Board publications other than the
Daily, in addition to $1 for winter,
spring, and summer quarters for the
Daily.
The Senate also took up the matter
of the refund process included as an
option in two of the referenda on the
ballot, that of Citizens Advocates, and
the Publications Board-Stanford Daily.
The Senate decided that students
wishing to have their money refunded
by either the Advocates, the Pub
Board, or the Daily, could collect their
money in cash fall quarter, for a
period of two weeks in a centrally
located place, probably in the offices
of the ASSU located in Tresidder
Union.
Disagreement between the Univer
sity Administration and the ASSU
Council of Presidents over the elimina
tion of the Indian as the Stanford
mascot has finally been resolved.

Council of Presidents, explained to the
