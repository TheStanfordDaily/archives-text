## USE Reluctance Explained 
###

Sometimes our local brand of liberal intellectuals find it nearly
impossible to refrain from spouting off about what they apparently
know precious little about. Michael Bacon's half baked analysis of the
Union question in a recent letter to the Daily is one such example.
Shedding crocodile tears over the fact that "progressive, liberal
USE" isn't quite ready to tumble in bed with the Teamsters, Mr.
Bacon cries — Vote Teamster!! Anything less is a vote for the
Administration!! — when a lot of us know nothing could be farther
from the truth.
As someone who has worked for Stanford for over five years and is
a real honest to goodness organizer for USE, I've talked with hundreds
of fellow workers. I can tell you why there might be a general
reluctance to make a pact with the Devil to throw Satan out. A lab
technician at the Medical School sums it up simply, "I don't need two
bosses," she says.
A Chicano animal caretaker wants solid assurance that USE "won't
sell out." With accuracy he recalls how the Teamsters have
doublecrossed Cesar Chaves and the lettuce workers. Two Black
women who have been on the receiving end of machine power all their
lives come looking for copies of the latest Employees Organize. In the
past USE representatives helped them win grievances. They're fighting
mad to lick the Teamsters and more important — they're willing to
wait a year — to vote no Teamsters this time so USE can get on the
ballot in a year.
Rewards
Burning the soles out of the bottom of my boots in a month of
ferocious campaigning for USE had its rewards. One was just to know
first hand hundreds of other worker's views. Another was a new
modesty, humility and respect for the intellectual resources and
integrity of the people who work at Stanford. Yet a third, was that
when it came necessary to sweat for USE, when push came to shove —
we found out who was willing to work for serious change and who
turned tail, spouted lame rhetoric and begged the Teamsters to
provide them with an instant union machine.
You can poke holes in Bacon's arguments till they come up Swiss
cheese. He writes, "History shows where union elections fail the first
lime around, its sometime a number of years before a strong
novement can be resurrected." Horsepuckey! Anyone familiar with

labor elections — certainly the Teamsters — can tell you very often
that it takes two or three elections spaced a year apart to push a single
union to a majority.
That's exactly what's happening here. He speaks of USE as if the
Union maintained only a single monolithic outlook, as if everyone was
"politically progressive and liberal." Nothing could be farther from
the truth. We contain a cross section of all viewpoints, from out and
out bigoted to a few who are ready to seize the first battleship that
sails down the bay. Most USE members and officers fall somewhere
between.
Disrespect
There's much to be said against Bacon's analysis, but central to his
thinking like Rudy Tham, the $40,000 a year boss of Teamster local
856, is a distinct disrespect for people who work at Stanford. He
displays that same arrogance, condescension and presumption that
motivates the little labor czar to publically refer to those who work at
Stanford as mere ciphers, only a number, etc. "You don't count," the
Teamster tells us—"you're just a cog, a name on a slip of paper."
Alas for Messrs. Bacon and Tham. We know it'll be a rough year
without a recognized union. But we'd be fools to trade what we've got
for a pig in a poke. We know that even unrecognized, USE has been
the main factor in winning shift premiums, rest periods, vacation, sick,
holiday and death leaves that are as good and usually exceed anything
that Teamsters 856 now has in any of its dozens of contracts. We
know USE was instrumental in stopping layoffs, firings and obtaining
frozen and back pay. We know we already have a pension plan which
pays twice the Teamster average. Inadequate as Kaiser Insurance is —
it's more than the Teamsters offer elsewhere. True some of us need
dental coverage and vision care — is that worth $10 a month in
Teamster dues? USE will undoubtedly secure that too. We're far from
fools and the Teamster offers appear slim indeed — considering the
price.
I guess all infantile disorders aren't confined to the pediatrics ward.
I guess Mr. Bacon considers himself a revolutionary or some kind of
radical. Thats hard to go for~a bit scary. Some people never recover
from textbooks. Never get over rhetoric. Too big a jump you see.
