## Questions, Answers On The Draft 
### 
peter hanawalt

1. Q. What draft calls have
been announced so far in 1972,
and what numbers have been
reached?
A. The Department of Defense
announced a call for 15,000 men
for April, May and June, 1972. In
implementing the call, Selective
Service stated that numbers 1-15
of the 1972 First Priority
Selection Group would definitely
be reached. Induction orders
should have been sent out
between March 15 and March 31
to all men holding these numbers
who were fully available to be
inducted.
Personal Appearance
2. Q. I am a graduating senior
with lottery number 10. I have a
c.o. claim on file which will be
considered in June when I lose my
2-S. According to new SSS laws
and regulations, what personal

appearance and appeal rights will I
have?
A. A revised structure of
personal appearance and appeal
rights went into effect on March
10, 1972.
For a c.o. (or hardship) claim,
you are entitled to a personal
appearance at your local board
either before, or after, they
initially decide your claim. You
will be sent a form asking if you
wish to have this appearance
before the decision. If you choose
to have it after the decision, you
must request it within 15 days of
the date of mailing of the
classification card. With the
classification card you should be
sent a written statement of
reasons why they rejected your
claim. You are entitled to present
up to 3 witnesses during a
minimum of 15 minutes before

your local board. A lawyer cannot
represent you at the personal
appearance, but can appear as a
witness.
If your claim is rejected at the
personal appearance before the
local board, you have the right to
appear before the state appeal
board, but you must request this
state appearance within 15 days
of the date of mailing of your
classification card. Again, you
should be sent a written statement
of reasons for rejection of your
claim, by both the local board and
state appeal board. A letter
requesting an appeal should
include a request for personal
appearance, if desired, and a
choice of either the appeal board
in the state of your residence, or
in the state of your local board, if
they are different. You may
present additional information,
but not witnesses, before the state
appeal board.
If the state appeal board
decision is unanimous, you have
no further rights of appeal. If it is
a split decision, you have the right
to a personal appearance (if

desired) before the Presidential
Appeal Board, if you request it
within 15 days of the date of
mailing of your classification card.
No witnesses are allowed before
the Presidential Appeal Board.
You can request a written
statement of reasons for rejection
within 30 days of the date of
mailing of the resulting
classification card.
Overseas
3. Q. I will be overseas for six
months, and feel that I may be
reclassified from 2-S to 1-A during
that time. My lottery number is 5,
so in that event, I want to use my
appeal rights to keep from being
inducted, as well as to get my 2-S
back. I've already passed a
physical. Can I safely handle
things by mail from overseas?
A. As SSS policy stands now,
you may have problems making a
timely appeal request from
overseas. The former 60 day
appeal period for a person residing
outside of North America has
been rescinded. The new 15 day
appeal period apparently applies
to all registrants, regardless of

distance from local board. Since
draft boards are not allowed to
use overseas airmail, 15 days is
obviously inadequate. A possible
alternate would be to have
someone in the U.S. handle your
SSS mail. You could leave with
them signed and undated letters
of appeal, that could then be
mailed within the necessary 15
days to the local board. A local
board can extend the appeal
period "for good cause," but in
the past this discretionary
authority has seldom been used.
Appeal
4. Q. I am in the First Priority
Selection Group for 1972, and my
lottery number is 25. I was
classified 1-A several months ago,
but did not appeal because I had
not taken a physical. My physical
is scheduled for this month, and I
expect to be found unacceptable.
But if they do pass me at the
physical, how long do I have to
appeal?
A. You have no guaranteed
time period for appeal.
Since the Army, not the draft
board, usually makes the decisions
on medical acceptability, your
right to appeal such decisions is
substantially obscured. You could
have appealed your 1-A
classification within 15 days of its
date of mailing. However, it is
difficult to get that classification
reopened now. The best way is to
submit new medical information
that documents your
unacceptability, and request
reopening of your classification.
Otherwise, you are only able to
appeal the decision indirectly
through the Army. If you submit
new doctors' letters, you should
get a papers-only review and
perhaps a re-examination. After
that (or instead of that), you can
request a final review from Army
Recruiting Command in Virginia.
You should receive this if you
request it from your local board
before it issues you an induction
order, but requesting this final
review does not prevent issuance
of an induction order.

physical. Can I safely handle
things by mail from overseas?
A. As SSS policy stands now,
you may have problems making a
timely appeal request from
overseas. The former 60 day
appeal period for a person residing
outside of North America has
been rescinded. The new 15 day
appeal period apparently applies
to all registrants, regardless of

distance from local board. Since
draft boards are not allowed to
use overseas airmail, 15 days is
obviously inadequate. A possible
alternate would be to have
someone in the U.S. handle your
SSS mail. You could leave with
them signed and undated letters
of appeal, that could then be
mailed within the necessary 15
days to the local board. A local
board can extend the appeal
period "for good cause," but in
the past this discretionary
authority has seldom been used.
Appeal
4. Q. I am in the First Priority
Selection Group for 1972, and my
lottery number is 25. I was
classified 1-A several months ago,
but did not appeal because I had
not taken a physical. My physical
is scheduled for this month, and I
expect to be found unacceptable.
But if they do pass me at the
physical, how long do I have to
appeal?
A. You have no guaranteed
time period for appeal.
Since the Army, not the draft
board, usually makes the decisions
on medical acceptability, your
right to appeal such decisions is
substantially obscured. You could
have appealed your 1-A
classification within 15 days of its
date of mailing. However, it is
difficult to get that classification
reopened now. The best way is to
submit new medical information
that documents your
unacceptability, and request
reopening of your classification.
Otherwise, you are only able to
appeal the decision indirectly
through the Army. If you submit
new doctors' letters, you should
get a papers-only review and
perhaps a re-examination. After
that (or instead of that), you can
request a final review from Army
Recruiting Command in Virginia.
You should receive this if you
request it from your local board
before it issues you an induction
order, but requesting this final
review does not prevent issuance
of an induction order.

1. Q. What draft calls have
been announced so far in 1972,
and what numbers have been
reached?
A. The Department of Defense
announced a call for 15,000 men
for April, May and June, 1972. In
implementing the call, Selective
Service stated that numbers 1-15
of the 1972 First Priority
Selection Group would definitely
be reached. Induction orders
should have been sent out
between March 15 and March 31
to all men holding these numbers
who were fully available to be
inducted.
Personal Appearance
2. Q. I am a graduating senior
with lottery number 10. I have a
c.o. claim on file which will be
considered in June when I lose my
2-S. According to new SSS laws
and regulations, what personal

appearance and appeal rights will I
have?
A. A revised structure of
personal appearance and appeal
rights went into effect on March
10, 1972.
For a c.o. (or hardship) claim,
you are entitled to a personal
appearance at your local board
either before, or after, they
initially decide your claim. You
will be sent a form asking if you
wish to have this appearance
before the decision. If you choose
to have it after the decision, you
must request it within 15 days of
the date of mailing of the
classification card. With the
classification card you should be
sent a written statement of
reasons why they rejected your
claim. You are entitled to present
up to 3 witnesses during a
minimum of 15 minutes before

your local board. A lawyer cannot
represent you at the personal
appearance, but can appear as a
witness.
If your claim is rejected at the
personal appearance before the
local board, you have the right to
appear before the state appeal
board, but you must request this
state appearance within 15 days
of the date of mailing of your
classification card. Again, you
should be sent a written statement
of reasons for rejection of your
claim, by both the local board and
state appeal board. A letter
requesting an appeal should
include a request for personal
appearance, if desired, and a
choice of either the appeal board
in the state of your residence, or
in the state of your local board, if
they are different. You may
present additional information,
but not witnesses, before the state
appeal board.
If the state appeal board
decision is unanimous, you have
no further rights of appeal. If it is
a split decision, you have the right
to a personal appearance (if

desired) before the Presidential
Appeal Board, if you request it
within 15 days of the date of
mailing of your classification card.
No witnesses are allowed before
the Presidential Appeal Board.
You can request a written
statement of reasons for rejection
within 30 days of the date of
mailing of the resulting
classification card.
Overseas
3. Q. I will be overseas for six
months, and feel that I may be
reclassified from 2-S to 1-A during
that time. My lottery number is 5,
so in that event, I want to use my
appeal rights to keep from being
inducted, as well as to get my 2-S
back. I've already passed a
physical. Can I safely handle
things by mail from overseas?
A. As SSS policy stands now,
you may have problems making a

10, 1972.
For a c.o. (or hardship) claim,
you are entitled to a personal
appearance at your local board
either before, or after, they
initially decide your claim. You
will be sent a form asking if you
wish to have this appearance
before the decision. If you choose
to have it after the decision, you
must request it within 15 days of
the date of mailing of the
classification card. With the
classification card you should be
sent a written statement of
reasons why they rejected your
claim. You are entitled to present
up to 3 witnesses during a
minimum of 15 minutes before

your local board. A lawyer cannot
represent you at the personal
appearance, but can appear as a
witness.
If your claim is rejected at the
personal appearance before the
local board, you have the right to
appear before the state appeal
board, but you must request this
state appearance within 15 days
of the date of mailing of your
classification card. Again, you
should be sent a written statement
of reasons for rejection of your
claim, by both the local board and
state appeal board. A letter
requesting an appeal should
include a request for personal
appearance, if desired, and a
choice of either the appeal board
in the state of your residence, or
in the state of your local board, if
they are different. You may
present additional information,
but not witnesses, before the state
appeal board.
If the state appeal board
decision is unanimous, you have
no further rights of appeal. If it is
a split decision, you have the right
to a personal appearance (if

desired) before the Presidential
Appeal Board, if you request it
within 15 days of the date of
mailing of your classification card.
No witnesses are allowed before
the Presidential Appeal Board.
You can request a written
statement of reasons for rejection
within 30 days of the date of
mailing of the resulting
classification card.
Overseas
3. Q. I will be overseas for six
months, and feel that I may be
reclassified from 2-S to 1-A during
that time. My lottery number is 5,
so in that event, I want to use my
appeal rights to keep from being
inducted, as well as to get my 2-S
back. I've already passed a
physical. Can I safely handle
things by mail from overseas?
A. As SSS policy stands now,
you may have problems making a
timely appeal request from
overseas. The former 60 day
appeal period for a person residing
outside of North America has
been rescinded. The new 15 day
appeal period apparently applies
to all registrants, regardless of

distance from local board. Since
draft boards are not allowed to
use overseas airmail, 15 days is
obviously inadequate. A possible
alternate would be to have
someone in the U.S. handle your
SSS mail. You could leave with
them signed and undated letters
of appeal, that could then be
mailed within the necessary 15
days to the local board. A local
board can extend the appeal
period "for good cause," but in
the past this discretionary
authority has seldom been used.
Appeal
4. Q. I am in the First Priority
Selection Group for 1972, and my
lottery number is 25. I was
classified 1-A several months ago,
but did not appeal because I had
not taken a physical. My physical
is scheduled for this month, and I
expect to be found unacceptable.
But if they do pass me at the
physical, how long do I have to
appeal?
A. You have no guaranteed
time period for appeal.
Since the Army, not the draft
board, usually makes the decisions
on medical acceptability, your
right to appeal such decisions is
substantially obscured. You could
have appealed your 1-A
classification within 15 days of its
date of mailing. However, it is
difficult to get that classification
reopened now. The best way is to
submit new medical information
that documents your
unacceptability, and request
reopening of your classification.
Otherwise, you are only able to
appeal the decision indirectly
through the Army. If you submit
new doctors' letters, you should
get a papers-only review and
perhaps a re-examination. After
that (or instead of that), you can
request a final review from Army
Recruiting Command in Virginia.
You should receive this if you
request it from your local board
before it issues you an induction
order, but requesting this final
review does not prevent issuance
of an induction order.

Services Office.)

1. Q. What draft calls have
been announced so far in 1972,
and what numbers have been
reached?
A. The Department of Defense
announced a call for 15,000 men
for April, May and June, 1972. In
implementing the call, Selective
Service stated that numbers 1-15
of the 1972 First Priority
Selection Group would definitely
be reached. Induction orders
should have been sent out
between March 15 and March 31
to all men holding these numbers
who were fully available to be
inducted.
Personal Appearance
2. Q. I am a graduating senior
with lottery number 10. I have a
c.o. claim on file which will be
considered in June when I lose my
2-S. According to new SSS laws
and regulations, what personal

appearance and appeal rights will I
have?
A. A revised structure of
personal appearance and appeal
rights went into effect on March
10, 1972.
For a c.o. (or hardship) claim,
you are entitled to a personal

either before, or after, they
