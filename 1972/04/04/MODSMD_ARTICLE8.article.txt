Death & Taxes
April 17th is fast approaching,
the infamous day on which we are
all required to dig deep and fork
over to Uncle Sam the money
which we are taxed. It is
remarkable that so many people
so willingly and unquestioningly
pay up without delving into
questions of why and what for.
Most Americans work long and
hard to earn their keep, yet when
April Tax Day comes along we
kiss a good deal of that money
goodbye forever. In 1971, the
average person worked for Uncle
Sam until May 10. It was on May
10, 1971, that we started to earn
our own money. In 1971 we paid
over $1,000,000,000 for wars,
past, present and future. That is
$500 for every man, woman, and
child in this country; a typical
family with three children paid
over .$2500 for war.
To pay our taxes without
simultaneously raising our voices
is to give consent to whatever that
money is being spent for. The
$2500 that family is supposed to
pay in war taxes is spent to burn
babies in the Plain of Jars in Laos,
it is spent on military retirement
pay for the pilot who killed those
babies, and it is spent to develop
newer and more efficient ways of
burning the unborn babies of the
future. When we simply file that
Form 1040, we are consciously
permitting the American
government to continue its policy
of patrolling the world in our
name. In fact we do more: we
incite the government to continue
these policies by giving it the
wherewithal to carry out these
policies.
What can we do? How can we
avoid being implicated in this
destruction of human life? A first
step is telephone tax resistance.
The 10% Federal phone tax was
instituted in 1966 solely and
specifically to pay for the War in
Vietnam. Some 100,000 people
are now refusing to pay this tax.
In so doing we are in effect
determining how our tax dollars
are to be spent, which is one of
the characteristics of a true
democratic government (of the
people, by the people, for the
people).

Other people are not placidly
filing their 1040's, but are in some
way voicing their opinion about
what that money should be spent
for. There are many means a
person can use, from filing a form
under protest, to claiming
Vietnamese children as
dependants, to "adjusting" one's
taxable income on line 17 so that
one does not have to pay any tax,
to refusing to pay either all of the
tax due or just the 65% destined
for war, to simply not filing the
1040 at all. There are varying
degrees of risk associated with
these steps, and before trying any
of them (except for including a
letter of protest with your return
or writing your congressman) you
should check with us at
Columbae, 328-9555, for more
information.
A group of people will be
taking a substantive action on the
morning of April 17th at the
Alameda Naval Air Station, where
many of the aircraft carriers doing
the bombing of Indochina are
based. They will be engaging in
civil disobedience in order to
demonstrate their abhorrence for
the destruction our tax dollars are
causing. While no one expects
U.S. policies to change as a direct
result of this action, it is through
many people beginning to act in
accord with their beliefs that this
war, and wars in general, will be
brought to a halt. For those of us
who already profess to be against
the war, it is time to begin to act,
to move from the stage of inner
protest to the stage of overt
resistance.
To do nothing, to wallow in
the quagmire of our affluence, is
to ignore the extreme poverty, the
denial of inalienable human rights,
and the outright slaughter which
the American government is
responsible for. To pay our taxes
is to legitimize those activities and
to take the responsibility for them
upon ourselves.
