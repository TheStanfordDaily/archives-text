Today is April 5, 1972.
On this date in 1614, Pocahontas married John Rolfe,
inventor of the cigar. She was the one who, history books
tell us, interfered when her father was about to give Captain
Smith the Axe.
It has been suggested that Rolfe married her solely to
exploit her image in his cigar ads. A woman is only a
woman, but a good cigar is a smoke.
