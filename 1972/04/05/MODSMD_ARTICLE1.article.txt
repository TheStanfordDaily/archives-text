## VP Criticizes 'Lack Of Trust' 
### BOB BACON 
'There's a lot of talent wasted
around Stanford in committees. It's a
pure waste of time ... it seems that
people don't trust one another to
make decisions," said Robert R.
Augsburger as he discussed his impres
sions of Stanford after nine months as
Vice President for Business and Fi
nance.
"The quality of operations and
thinking here was a very pleasant
surprise to me ... but I'm still very
much disturbed by the decision
making process, which I recognize
can't be identical to a profit-making
business enterprise, but still can be
improved upon."
The former investment banker
offered the Daily his appraisals of
Stanford from his point of view last
week in his Encina Hall office.
Augsburger is responsible for most
of the University's non-academic oper
ations in his newly-created post. Under
his jurisdiction are the officers in

charge of fiscal planning and the
University's budget, personnel and
employee relations, the student hous
ing and food services, facilities plan
ning and construction, physical plant
maintenance, the police and fire
departments, land use planning, and
investment management, among
others.
Finances
Looking toward the future, he
pointed to finances as the most
important problem facing the institu
tion in the near future. "The flexibili
ty of most of our sources of revenue is
nearing its peak," he pointed out.
Tuition cannot continue to rise
faster than inflation indefinitely, or all
the added revenue will be required for
increases in financial aid.
Augsburger mentioned experimen
tal long-term repayment procedures to
cover the costs of education, pointing
out that such programs are in the
planning stage at the Stanford Business
and Law Schools.

But, he said, "these are probably
only apropos for the professional
schools" where the students can
anticipate relatively high incomes and
"where there is incentive to assume a
significant debt."
In addition, land development can
no longer be counted on as a
continually increasing source of funds,
he explained, due to anti-development
pressures and the very small amount of
land available for new industrial leases.
"Gifts are the leverage we have,
together with perhaps some new form
of support from the federal govern
ment. But we can't count on these,"
he stressed.
As a result, "the budgeting deci
sions will get tougher. It's likely that
we'll have to cut out some services or
programs that we've come to accept as
standards and very natural," Augsbur
ger added.
Last September, he stated that "We
must re-examine each and every one of
our activities against the test of
whether they are really critical to the
achievement of a quality education. If
they do not meet that test, we must
face up to the tough decision to
eliminate them."
To that end, he told the Daily, he is
seeking a clarification of the organiza
tion, objectives, and priorities of each
of the operating divisions responsible
to him.
"This is both to provide long-range
goals for each division, and, in the
short run, to make decisions regarding
budget cutbacks," he explained.
Augsburger opined that "we've

improved employee confidence in the
fairness of the University. We've
recognized that all supervisors aren't
automatically right. We're moving
toward fair and equal treatment of
employees, in wage scales, with the
Affirmative Action Program, and with
the new grievance procedures.
"The results of the union election,
with a large percentage of the workers
voting in favor of a union, might
represent strong anti-administration
sentiment—a repudiation of our ef
forts. But it doesn't necessarily mean
that," he continued.
He suggested that decision-making
in the University could be improved
by "more delegation of responsibility
by the faculty to the administration,
and, within the administration, down
the chain of command.
"We must get the most informed
person to make the decisions. Too
many minor decisions flow to the
upper echelons of the administration,
particularly to the President's office.
They should be spending their time on
planning and policy questions," he
continued.
"People shouldn't call on the
top-level administrators with all their
problems."
Willow Road
Augsburger reported that a prelimi
nary design study is underway for
extension of Willow Road behind the
Shopping Center to El Camino Real.
The proposal also includes creation of
a four-lane parkway with roadside
plantings and a bicycle path for the
