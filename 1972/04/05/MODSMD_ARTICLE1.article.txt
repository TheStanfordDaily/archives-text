## VP Criticizes 'Lack Of Trust' 
### BOB BACON 
'There's a lot of talent wasted
around Stanford in committees. It's a
pure waste of time ... it seems that
people don't trust one another to
make decisions," said Robert R.
Augsburger as he discussed his impres
sions of Stanford after nine months as
Vice President for Business and Fi
nance.
"The quality of operations and
thinking here was a very pleasant
surprise to me ... but I'm still very
much disturbed by the decision
making process, which I recognize
can't be identical to a profit-making
business enterprise, but still can be
improved upon."
The former investment banker
offered the Daily his appraisals of
Stanford from his point of view last
week in his Encina Hall office.
Augsburger is responsible for most
of the University's non-academic oper
ations in his newly-created post. Under
his jurisdiction are the officers in

charge of fiscal planning and the
University's budget, personnel and
employee relations, the student hous
ing and food services, facilities plan
ning and construction, physical plant
maintenance, the police and fire
departments, land use planning, and
investment management, among
others.
Finances
Looking toward the future, he
pointed to finances as the most
important problem facing the institu
tion in the near future. "The flexibili
ty of most of our sources of revenue is
nearing its peak," he pointed out.
Tuition cannot continue to rise
faster than inflation indefinitely, or all
the added revenue will be required for
increases in financial aid.
Augsburger mentioned experimen
tal long-term repayment procedures to
cover the costs of education, pointing
out that such programs are in the
planning stage at the Stanford Business
and Law Schools.

But, he said, "these are probably
only apropos for the professional
schools" where the students can
anticipate relatively high incomes and
"where there is incentive to assume a
significant debt."
In addition, land development can
no longer be counted on as a
continually increasing source of funds,
he explained, due to anti-development
pressures and the very small amount of
land available for new industrial leases.
"Gifts are the leverage we have,
together with perhaps some new form
of support from the federal govern
ment. But we can't count on these,"
he stressed.
As a result, "the budgeting deci
sions will get tougher. It's likely that
we'll have to cut out some services or
programs that we've come to accept as
standards and very natural," Augsbur
ger added.
Last September, he stated that "We
must re-examine each and every one of
our activities against the test of
whether they are really critical to the
achievement of a quality education. If
they do not meet that test, we must
face up to the tough decision to
eliminate them."
To that end, he told the Daily, he is
seeking a clarification of the organiza
tion, objectives, and priorities of each
of the operating divisions responsible
to him.
"This is both to provide long-range
goals for each division, and, in the
short run, to make decisions regarding
budget cutbacks," he explained.
Augsburger opined that "we've

improved employee confidence in the
fairness of the University. We've
recognized that all supervisors aren't
automatically right. We're moving
toward fair and equal treatment of
employees, in wage scales, with the
Affirmative Action Program, and with
the new grievance procedures.
"The results of the union election,
with a large percentage of the workers
voting in favor of a union, might
represent strong anti-administration
sentiment—a repudiation of our ef
forts. But it doesn't necessarily mean
that," he continued.
He suggested that decision-making
in the University could be improved
by "more delegation of responsibility
by the faculty to the administration,
and, within the administration, down
the chain of command.
"We must get the most informed
person to make the decisions. Too
many minor decisions flow to the
upper echelons of the administration,
particularly to the President's office.
They should be spending their time on
planning and policy questions," he
continued.
"People shouldn't call on the
top-level administrators with all their
problems."
Willow Road
Augsburger reported that a prelimi
nary design study is underway for
extension of Willow Road behind the
Shopping Center to El Camino Real.

plantings and a bicycle path for the

entire distance of Willow Road from
El Camino to Sand Hill Road.
"Finances are still a question," he
noted. "Palo Alto wants Stanford to
pay much of the cost. It's difficult to
apportion the traffic volume between
the campus and the community. The
hospital serves Palo Alto although
Stanford owns it. Palo Alto's revenues
[taxes] from the shopping center are
greater than the University's [lease
fees]."
Last February, Augsburger also
suggested the creation of a link for
cars, pedestrians, and bicycles between
downtown Palo Alto and Stanford
Shopping Center by linking Quarry
Road and Lytton Street with an
overpass or underpass bridging El
Camino and the railroad tracks. He
called that suggestion a way to help
overcome the physical separation of
the two communities.
Augsburger's comments on the
controversial Page Mill Square develop
ment proposal were noted in an article
in Monday's Daily.
Learning Process
The transplanted New Yorker ad
mitted that his tenure to date at
Stanford has been "largely a learning
period for me, and I realize that there
is still much more to learn."
But as he leams, he is also seeking
to mold and modify the University's
business operations as he views them
from a business executive's perspec
tive.
Augsburger is probably in the
minority when he suggests significant
modifications in the University deci
sion-making process. His presence has
been criticized as evidence of a close
tie between big business and higher
education.
Higher education in general, and
Stanford in particular, have been
criticized both for being too business
like and not businesslike enough in the
management of their non-academic
affairs. For better or for worse,
Stanford's financial affairs are now in
the hands of a man who last fall
compared Stanford "with the best of
the quality growth companies."

Augsburger is probably in the
minority when he suggests significant
modifications in the University deci
sion-making process. His presence has
been criticized as evidence of a close
tie between big business and higher
education.
Higher education in general, and
Stanford in particular, have been
criticized both for being too business
like and not businesslike enough in the
management of their non-academic
affairs. For better or for worse,
Stanford's financial affairs are now in
the hands of a man who last fall
compared Stanford "with the best of
the quality growth companies."
'There's a lot of talent wasted
around Stanford in committees. It's a
pure waste of time ... it seems that
people don't trust one another to
make decisions," said Robert R.
Augsburger as he discussed his impres
sions of Stanford after nine months as
Vice President for Business and Fi
nance.
"The quality of operations and
thinking here was a very pleasant
surprise to me ... but I'm still very
much disturbed by the decision
making process, which I recognize
can't be identical to a profit-making
business enterprise, but still can be
improved upon."
The former investment banker
offered the Daily his appraisals of
Stanford from his point of view last
week in his Encina Hall office.
Augsburger is responsible for most
of the University's non-academic oper
ations in his newly-created post. Under
his jurisdiction are the officers in

charge of fiscal planning and the
University's budget, personnel and
employee relations, the student hous
ing and food services, facilities plan
ning and construction, physical plant
maintenance, the police and fire
departments, land use planning, and
investment management, among
others.
Finances
Looking toward the future, he
pointed to finances as the most
important problem facing the institu
tion in the near future. "The flexibili
ty of most of our sources of revenue is
nearing its peak," he pointed out.
Tuition cannot continue to rise
faster than inflation indefinitely, or all
the added revenue will be required for
increases in financial aid.
Augsburger mentioned experimen
tal long-term repayment procedures to
cover the costs of education, pointing
out that such programs are in the
planning stage at the Stanford Business
and Law Schools.

But, he said, "these are probably
only apropos for the professional
schools" where the students can
anticipate relatively high incomes and
"where there is incentive to assume a
significant debt."
In addition, land development can
no longer be counted on as a
continually increasing source of funds,
he explained, due to anti-development
pressures and the very small amount of
land available for new industrial leases.
"Gifts are the leverage we have,
together with perhaps some new form
of support from the federal govern
ment. But we can't count on these,"
he stressed.
As a result, "the budgeting deci
sions will get tougher. It's likely that
we'll have to cut out some services or
programs that we've come to accept as
standards and very natural," Augsbur
ger added.
Last September, he stated that "We
must re-examine each and every one of
our activities against the test of
whether they are really critical to the
achievement of a quality education. If
they do not meet that test, we must
face up to the tough decision to
eliminate them."
To that end, he told the Daily, he is
seeking a clarification of the organiza
tion, objectives, and priorities of each
of the operating divisions responsible
to him.
"This is both to provide long-range
goals for each division, and, in the
short run, to make decisions regarding
budget cutbacks," he explained.
Augsburger opined that "we've

improved employee confidence in the
fairness of the University. We've
recognized that all supervisors aren't
automatically right. We're moving
toward fair and equal treatment of
employees, in wage scales, with the
Affirmative Action Program, and with
the new grievance procedures.
"The results of the union election,
with a large percentage of the workers
voting in favor of a union, might
represent strong anti-administration
sentiment—a repudiation of our ef
forts. But it doesn't necessarily mean
that," he continued.
He suggested that decision-making

entire distance of Willow Road from
El Camino to Sand Hill Road.
"Finances are still a question," he
noted. "Palo Alto wants Stanford to
pay much of the cost. It's difficult to
apportion the traffic volume between
the campus and the community. The
hospital serves Palo Alto although
Stanford owns it. Palo Alto's revenues
[taxes] from the shopping center are
greater than the University's [lease
fees]."
Last February, Augsburger also
suggested the creation of a link for
cars, pedestrians, and bicycles between
downtown Palo Alto and Stanford
Shopping Center by linking Quarry
Road and Lytton Street with an
overpass or underpass bridging El
Camino and the railroad tracks. He
called that suggestion a way to help
overcome the physical separation of
the two communities.
Augsburger's comments on the
controversial Page Mill Square develop
ment proposal were noted in an article
in Monday's Daily.
Learning Process
The transplanted New Yorker ad
mitted that his tenure to date at
Stanford has been "largely a learning
period for me, and I realize that there
is still much more to learn."
But as he leams, he is also seeking
to mold and modify the University's
business operations as he views them
from a business executive's perspec
tive.
Augsburger is probably in the
minority when he suggests significant
modifications in the University deci
sion-making process. His presence has
been criticized as evidence of a close
tie between big business and higher
education.
Higher education in general, and
Stanford in particular, have been
criticized both for being too business
like and not businesslike enough in the
management of their non-academic
affairs. For better or for worse,
Stanford's financial affairs are now in
the hands of a man who last fall
compared Stanford "with the best of
the quality growth companies."
'There's a lot of talent wasted
around Stanford in committees. It's a
pure waste of time ... it seems that
people don't trust one another to
make decisions," said Robert R.
Augsburger as he discussed his impres
sions of Stanford after nine months as
Vice President for Business and Fi
nance.
"The quality of operations and
thinking here was a very pleasant
surprise to me ... but I'm still very
much disturbed by the decision
making process, which I recognize
can't be identical to a profit-making
business enterprise, but still can be
improved upon."
The former investment banker
offered the Daily his appraisals of
Stanford from his point of view last
week in his Encina Hall office.
Augsburger is responsible for most
of the University's non-academic oper
ations in his newly-created post. Under
his jurisdiction are the officers in

charge of fiscal planning and the
University's budget, personnel and
employee relations, the student hous
ing and food services, facilities plan
ning and construction, physical plant
maintenance, the police and fire
departments, land use planning, and
investment management, among
others.
Finances
Looking toward the future, he
pointed to finances as the most
important problem facing the institu
tion in the near future. "The flexibili
ty of most of our sources of revenue is
nearing its peak," he pointed out.
Tuition cannot continue to rise
faster than inflation indefinitely, or all
the added revenue will be required for
increases in financial aid.
Augsburger mentioned experimen
tal long-term repayment procedures to
cover the costs of education, pointing
out that such programs are in the
planning stage at the Stanford Business
and Law Schools.

But, he said, "these are probably
only apropos for the professional
schools" where the students can
anticipate relatively high incomes and
"where there is incentive to assume a
significant debt."
In addition, land development can
no longer be counted on as a
continually increasing source of funds,
he explained, due to anti-development
pressures and the very small amount of
land available for new industrial leases.
"Gifts are the leverage we have,
together with perhaps some new form
of support from the federal govern
ment. But we can't count on these,"
he stressed.
As a result, "the budgeting deci
sions will get tougher. It's likely that
we'll have to cut out some services or
programs that we've come to accept as
standards and very natural," Augsbur
ger added.
Last September, he stated that "We
must re-examine each and every one of
our activities against the test of
whether they are really critical to the
achievement of a quality education. If
they do not meet that test, we must
face up to the tough decision to
eliminate them."
To that end, he told the Daily, he is
seeking a clarification of the organiza
tion, objectives, and priorities of each
of the operating divisions responsible
to him.
"This is both to provide long-range
goals for each division, and, in the
short run, to make decisions regarding
budget cutbacks," he explained.
Augsburger opined that "we've

improved employee confidence in the
fairness of the University. We've
recognized that all supervisors aren't
automatically right. We're moving
toward fair and equal treatment of
employees, in wage scales, with the
Affirmative Action Program, and with
the new grievance procedures.
"The results of the union election,
with a large percentage of the workers
voting in favor of a union, might
represent strong anti-administration
sentiment—a repudiation of our ef
forts. But it doesn't necessarily mean
that," he continued.
He suggested that decision-making
in the University could be improved
by "more delegation of responsibility
by the faculty to the administration,
and, within the administration, down
the chain of command.
"We must get the most informed
person to make the decisions. Too
many minor decisions flow to the
upper echelons of the administration,
particularly to the President's office.
They should be spending their time on
planning and policy questions," he
continued.
"People shouldn't call on the
top-level administrators with all their
problems."
