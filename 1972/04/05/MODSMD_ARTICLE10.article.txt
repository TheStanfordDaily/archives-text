Disruptions
Editor, THE DAILY:
I am writing to call the
attention of the Stanford
community to the growing
annoyance of our faculty with
respect to the continuing
disruption of legitimate academic
functions on campus by a small
group of dissidents. The
disruption of the Academic
Council meeting last Friday was
the second successive event of its
kind. The fact that the SRM is a
small operation with no real base
of support among the Stanford
community did not diminish the
resentment of a large fraction of
those present in being unable to
hear in its entirety the important
speech by Provost Miller, and to
erVgage in subsequent discussion.
â€¢" The response last Friday is not
surprising in view of the
anti-disruption resolution passed
by the Senate of the Academic
Council on February 17, 1972.
The resolution, overwhelmingly
voted by 36-1, with 3 abstentions,
unreservedly condemns
disruptions in classrooms and
laboratories. It urges the
University administration "to use
all reasonable means to protect
the performance of essential
University functions,. . I know
that Drs. Lyman and Miller and
their advisors are giving the fullest
consideration to this
recommendation.
I call upon the ASSU Council
of Presidents and ASSU Senate,
and also upon leaders of other
sectors of the Stanford
community to join the faculty
Senate in expressing their
condemnation of campus
disruptions and in offering their
support of additional steps as
required to protect us all from
future coercive intrusions of this
or similar kind.
Daniel Bershader
Chairman, Senate of
the Academic Council
