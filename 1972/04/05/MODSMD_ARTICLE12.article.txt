## The 						Chinese Can So Have Cars 
### 
c john mccarthy

Pirages and Ehrlich declare it
impossible that the Chinese will
ever achieve the same ratio of cars
to people as the U.S. has at
present. They also argue that since
each American uses one
twenty-two times the energy per
capita, raising the Chinese level to
the American would double the
environmental impact of
humanity. They don't say this is
bad, but one can assume they
consider it unacceptable.
It seems to me very likely that
the Chinese will eventually
achieve both the rate of
automobile use and the rate of
energy use of present day America
and that this will be good for
them and that the side effects will
not be harmful to themselves or
anyone else. On the level of detail
of the Pirages and Ehrlich article,
this is all that need be said; an
unsupported opinion in an article
needs only an unsupported
opinion as a reply. However,
Ehrlich and others have given
more details elsewhere, so here is
a reply to some of the points they
might have made.
First, a substitute for gasoline
from patroleum must be found;
even present consumption rates
cannot continue long. Battery cars
might work, but this is still not
clear in spite of considerable
development effort. Several
authors have proposed to use
liquid hydrogen produced by
electrolyzing water as a motor
fuel. It works fine even in present
engines, but it promises to be
somewhat dangerous to handle,
perhaps more dangerous than

gasoline. I predict that we and the
Chinese will accept the accidents
rather than forgo personal
transportation.
Of course, the electricity for
extracting the hydrogen must be
found, and this can come from
breeder reactors for which the
supply of raw materials will last
for 1000 years. (It would be
insulting to the technological
ability of our descendants to plan
beyond that). Operating these
reactors will produce local hot
spots in the water along the
Chinese coast, but they will
accept that price as will we.
Consider mineral resources on
which the U.S. now spends two
percent of its GNP. We import
high grade iron ore because this is
cheaper than using lower grade
ores, but when we have to, we can
use iron at its 5 percent
abundance in the earth's crust;
minerals may then cost 4 percent
of our GNP. Copper may become
genuinely short. If it were as
expensive as gold, we would
substitute aluminum for almost all
its uses.
The worst consequence of this
would be that electric motors and
transformers would be bulkier
since aluminum conducts
electricity worse than copper.
Before that, however, we will
mine AT&T's underground cables

and replace them by aluminum.
There are many more resource
problems than this, and many of
the solutions are not well
understood, but the arguments
that they are unsolvable are
unconvincing, and how to solve
the problems of the next hundred
years is much better understood
than the problems of the last
hundred years were understood a
hundred years ago. Incidentally,
the cartoon that accompanied the
article showing the Chinese
landscape totally covered with
cars was fradulent; when the
Chinese have as many cars per
capita as the United States, they
will have 120 cars per square mile
which is half the present car
density of New Jersey.
Particular Case
The question of whether the
Chinese can eventually have cars is
only a particular case of the
general question of whether the
world can support its future
population at a high standard of
living even granted that the
population can be stabilized at a
few times its present level. The
conventional view until recently
was that even several times the
present population can have at
least the present U.S. standard of
living. After considerable study of
statistics and technology, I have
remained convinced that the

conventional view is right and that
slow development of the poor
countries is one of our main
problems. Another is the timely
development of a substitute for
petroleum as a vehicle fuel. There
are several plausible alternatives
but not enough well supported
projects.
On the other hand, if the
increasingly popular gloomy view
that Ehrlich proposes is correct,
then the main problem is sharing
and not development, In that
case, it should be pointed out that

the main resource of which the
U.S. has more than its share is
good agricultural land, and the
quickest way to share that would
be to repeal the U.S. laws
restricting immigration. In my
opinion, if this were done, the
world standard of living would
rise sharply, because the American
people would really have to
scramble to prevent our standard
of living from decreasing. In the
end, it would be good for us.
