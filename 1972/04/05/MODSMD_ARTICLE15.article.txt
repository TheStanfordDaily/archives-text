# Miller Calls For Study

### 
Educators, like physicians,
should begin studying how to
improve their academic
effectiveness, delivering both
more and better services to
students, Provost William F. Miller
believes.
Education, like medicine, is a
"labor intensive activity," with
about three fourths the cost of
education going to salaries alone,
he explains.
This .means that education
costs will tend to rise faster than
those of machine-oriented
activities, where heavy capital
investment may yield significant
gains in production.
"Traditionally, for us, as well
as for physicians, we have been
most effective by having a large
amount of one-to-one or
one-to-few contacts with our
clients [students]," Miller notes.
"That type of contact is at the
very core of high quality
education.
"Yet, as we recognize in the
case of health care
activities .. . because of this high
intensity use of labor and the
concomitant disproportionate
share of the cost rise, we are

pricing ourselves out of the
market.
"Perhaps there are a number of
ways to attack this problem. We
may be able to adopt some of the
methods that health care activities
have adopted—for example, the
use of para-academic personnel to
get considerable leverage on the
time of the more expensive
faculty member.
"Careful attention by
departments to the distribution of
small group activities and larger
group activities may yield the
capability of providing the
high-quality education we cherish
to larger numbers of students and
thereby improve our so-called cost
effectiveness. .. .
"It is important for every
department and every program to
begin to consider how they can
improve their academic
effectiveness, not only in quality
but also in quantity—that is, with
larger student-faculty ratios on
the average."
