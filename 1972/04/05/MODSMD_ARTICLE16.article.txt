# Lacrosse Defeats Arizona
## 
### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
After losing a two-goal lead,
the Stanford Lacrosse team came
from behind to defeat the
University of Arizona last Friday,
5-4. Despite mental errors in its
own end, Stanford played an
excellent game both offensively
and defensively.
Arizona had the early
advantage as it controlled the play
mostly in the Cards' defensive
area. However, after the visitors
had thwarted a Stanford scoring
attempt and were breaking out of
their end, Chip Lovemann
intercepted a clearing pass across
the crease by Arizona. Lovemann
shot into the open net to put
Stanford ahead, 1-0.
Through the rest of the period,
Arizona was controlling the play.
The Wildcats pressured the Card
defense and had some excellent
chances to score but Stanford
responded with alert defensive
play. The defense was playing
good position and forced several
Arizona turnovers.
At the other end, Stanford had
few chances to score but managed
to convert on one of them. Butch
Hazelett hit middie Pete Stoloff
with a perfect pass as Stoloff
broke through the Arizona
defense. In one quick motion
Stoloff took the pass and rifled
his shot past the Arizona
netminder to end the scoring in
the first frame.
In the second period, the
Stanford defense again was
impressive as they held off
Arizona. The visitors had several
extra man advantages but were
unable to put the ball past Fred
Choate, Stanford's goalie.
However, the visitors made a last
thrust toward the Stanford goal

and tallied right at the gun ending
the first half.
Stanford started off very
strong in the second half. After an
Arizona scoring attempt failed,
the Cards moved into Wildcat
territory and controlled the play
with excellent passing and
position play, always looking for
the opening. Chip Lovemann was
directing the attack from behind
the net and spotted Butch
Hazelett open in front. Hazelett's
shot was blocked but he regained
possession and fed to Pete Stoloff
who was open on the other side of
the net.
However, at this point the
Stanford defense began to falter.
The visitors dominated the rest of
the period scoring three straight
goals. The first two were scored
with Stanford a man down. The
first tally was on what seemed to
be a routine shot from the left
side. Yet the low shot bounced
right in front of Choate and
handcuffed him. The second goal
came on a similar shot from the
other side. The shooter did not
have a clear path to the goal, yet
his shot eluded Choate and the
score was deadlocked.
The fourth Arizona goal came as
the result of a mental error on the
part of the Stanford defense. A
clearing pass across the goalmouth
was intercepted by an Arizona
attackman who fired the ball into
an open net.
The final frame was dominated
by Stanford who again passed well
in the offensive zone. After
making a good save, the pressured
Arizona netminder could not stop
the next shot by middie Dave

Sampson. The drive bounced off
the goalie's leg into the net.
The winning tally came as a
result of alert play by attackman
Ted Suen. Suen broke up an
Arizona clearing attempt and after
warding off several defenders he
fed the Dall to Chip Lovemann
standing all alone in front of the
net. Lovemann scored easily,
providing Stanford's victory
margin.

JUST A FOUL BALL—Rod Boone was only able to foul this pitch back. Usually if he connects it goes
much farther as evidenced by his team leading seven homeruns and 28 RBl's. Next weekend Boone gets

The final frame was dominated
by Stanford who again passed well
in the offensive zone. After
making a good save, the pressured
Arizona netminder could not stop
the next shot by middie Dave

Sampson. The drive bounced off
the goalie's leg into the net.
The winning tally came as a
result of alert play by attackman
Ted Suen. Suen broke up an
Arizona clearing attempt and after
warding off several defenders he
fed the Dall to Chip Lovemann
standing all alone in front of the
net. Lovemann scored easily,
providing Stanford's victory
margin.

JUST A FOUL BALL—Rod Boone was only able to foul this pitch back. Usually if he connects it goes
much farther as evidenced by his team leading seven homeruns and 28 RBl's. Next weekend Boone gets
to use his skills against USC pitching.
After losing a two-goal lead,
the Stanford Lacrosse team came
from behind to defeat the
University of Arizona last Friday,
5-4. Despite mental errors in its
own end, Stanford played an
excellent game both offensively
and defensively.
Arizona had the early
advantage as it controlled the play
mostly in the Cards' defensive
area. However, after the visitors
had thwarted a Stanford scoring
attempt and were breaking out of
their end, Chip Lovemann
intercepted a clearing pass across
the crease by Arizona. Lovemann
shot into the open net to put
Stanford ahead, 1-0.
Through the rest of the period,
Arizona was controlling the play.
The Wildcats pressured the Card
defense and had some excellent
chances to score but Stanford
responded with alert defensive
play. The defense was playing
good position and forced several
Arizona turnovers.
At the other end, Stanford had
few chances to score but managed
to convert on one of them. Butch
Hazelett hit middie Pete Stoloff
with a perfect pass as Stoloff
broke through the Arizona
defense. In one quick motion
Stoloff took the pass and rifled
his shot past the Arizona
netminder to end the scoring in
the first frame.
In the second period, the
Stanford defense again was
impressive as they held off
Arizona. The visitors had several
extra man advantages but were
unable to put the ball past Fred
Choate, Stanford's goalie.
However, the visitors made a last
thrust toward the Stanford goal

and tallied right at the gun ending
the first half.
Stanford started off very
strong in the second half. After an
Arizona scoring attempt failed,
the Cards moved into Wildcat
territory and controlled the play
with excellent passing and
position play, always looking for
the opening. Chip Lovemann was
directing the attack from behind
the net and spotted Butch
Hazelett open in front. Hazelett's
shot was blocked but he regained
possession and fed to Pete Stoloff
who was open on the other side of
the net.
However, at this point the
Stanford defense began to falter.
The visitors dominated the rest of
the period scoring three straight
goals. The first two were scored
with Stanford a man down. The
first tally was on what seemed to
be a routine shot from the left
side. Yet the low shot bounced
right in front of Choate and
handcuffed him. The second goal
came on a similar shot from the
other side. The shooter did not
have a clear path to the goal, yet
his shot eluded Choate and the
score was deadlocked.
The fourth Arizona goal came as
the result of a mental error on the
part of the Stanford defense. A
clearing pass across the goalmouth
was intercepted by an Arizona
attackman who fired the ball into
an open net.
The final frame was dominated

in the offensive zone. After
