# Spikers Face USC
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
The Stanford track team goes south Saturday to
take on NCAA runner up USC in a dual meet. The
Cards go into the meet with a 3-0 record, and the
Trojans are likewise undefeated.
The last time Stanford beat USC in a dual track
meet was back in 1933. Last year, the Trojans won
86-58. Barring a major upset, this year should be
more of the same.
Stanford is the underdog in the short sprints. The
Trojans have super stars Willie Deckard (9.2 100
yds., 20.2 220 yds.), Don Quarrie (9.4, 20.4), and
Edesel Garrison (20.4). Facing them will be Ken
Curl (9.3, 21.2), Bob Barmeyer (9.7, 21.7), and
John Anderson (21.4).
Garrison should easily dominate the 440. Last
year he ran a blistering 45.4. Teammate Leon
Brown ran a 47.8 last week against Occidental. John
Anderson, who has also run a 47.8, will lead the
Cards with support from John Kessel (48.5) and
Bruce Henry (49.4).
Whiteing In 880
Stanford should pick up points in the 880. Dave
Whiteing has run a 1:52.3 and will be supported by
Brian Mittelstaedt who ran a 1:51.2 relay leg at
Santa Barbara two weeks ago. The other Stanford
entry will be Dave Hustwick (1:54.3). The Trojan's
current leader is Burks, who ran a 1:53.8 last week.
Rich Carr has run a 4:04.3 mile for USC and wiU
be tough to beat. Behind him is Lipski (4:22.0).
Stanford will run Les McFadden (4:12.5) and
Mittelstaedt (4:12.5). Arvid Kretz will lead the
Cards in the two mile. He has run 8:49.4. Facing
him will be Brown (9:02.2) and Carr (9:14.1).
USC's Lance Babb is the favorite in the 120 yard
high hurdles. He ran a 13.4 last year and was tied
for third in the world. Backing him up are Coffman
(14.0) and Wilson (13.8). Stanford will run Tom
Long (14.2), Mark Haight (14.7), and freshman
Dave Bagshaw (14.4).
In the intermediate hurdles USC has Jackson
(53.8) and Wilson (53.2). The Cardinals have Long
(52.3) and Mark Haight (53.2).
Strong In Field Events
The Trojans don't plan to lose many points inthe
field events. They swept the pole vault last year and
should do the same this year with Bob Pullard
(16'9"), Scott Cryder (16'8"), and Steve Cochran
(16'). Stanford's lone hope is Tom Lindsay (15')
who has been injured all year and just started
vaulting again last week.

In the javelin, Barnet of USC should dominate.
He has already thrown 248'3" this year. Other top
Trojan throwers are Lahti (230'2") and Ram
(208'10"). Steve Hopkins (223'3") and Rick Larson
(209'11") will throw for Stanford.
The shot put will be another weak event for the
Cards. Ralph Bakkensen (52'2 Vz y ) and Pete
Dreissigacker (50'4") will be pitted against USC's
Doug Lane (63'2") and Stevens (52'2").
The high jump will feature USC's two 7-footers,
Owens and Hollins. Facing them will be Skip
Groadahl (6'9") and Tom Anderson (6'6").
Long Jump Interesting
In the long jump, USC's Jackson has done
24'10" this year. Williams, his teammate, jumped
24'4" last week. Tom Anderson has a 25' l"leap to
his credit, and with backing from Mel Ho (24'4")
should make this an interesting event. Ho will also
support the Cards' triple jump squad with a 49'9"
mark, behind Rod Utley (50'2"). Facing them will
be Jackson (50'11"), Williams (49'9"), and Todd
(48'8").
The discus promises to be Stanford's strongest
field event. Freshman Jim Howard has thrown well
over 170' in practice this week. Also competing for
the Cardinals will be Pete Dreissigacker (167'3")
and Jim Royer (164'11"). They will go against
Sterner (160'3'/2") and Stevens (155'7").
The meet wiU be held at the Los Angeles
Coliseum beginning at 1:15. UCLA and California
will also be having a dual there at the same time.
The junior varsity team kicks off its season today
with a quadrangular meet against Monterey
Peninsula, Ohlone, and Skyline. The contest will
begin at 4:00 in the Stanford stadium.
