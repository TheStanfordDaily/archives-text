# McGovern Takes Wisconsin
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
A tide of cross-over Republican
voters made the Democratic presi
dential race a shambles yesterday,
giving Sen. George McGovern of South
Dakota a solid victory and Maine Sen.
Edmund Muskie a crushing fourth
place finish.
With 85 percent of the vote in last
night, McGovern was a clear winner
with 30 percent of the ballots, running
ahead of Alabama Gov. George
Wallace with 22 percent and Minnes
ota Sen. Hubert Humphrey with 21
percent.
Muskie, once far and away the
leader of the Democratic hopefuls,
became just another member of the
pack with 10 percent. Sen. Henry
Jackson of Washington and New York
Mayor John Lindsay ran well back
with eight and seven percent, followed
by six other candidates on the ballot.

MILWAUKEE (AP) - With 85 percent
of the precincts reporting, these were
the vote totals for the six leading
candidates in yesterday's Wisconsin
Democratic Presidential Primary:
McGovern 286,006, or 30 percent
Wallace 209,330, or 22 percent
Humphrey 201,247, or 21 percent
Muskie 98,852, or 10 percent
Jackson 75,580, or 8 percent
Lindsay 65,264, or 7 percent

Lindsay, upset by his poor showing,
dropped out of the race, narrowing the
field to five major candidates.
President Richard Nixon smashed
his nonopposition of Ohio Rep. John
Ashbrook and California Rep. Paul
McCloskey in the Republican primary.
McCloskey withdrew from the race 4
weeks ago, Ashbrook did not
campaign and Nixon took 97 percent
of the vote.
McGovern won 54 of the 67
delegates to the July convention in
Miami Beach, with Humphrey picking
up the other 13. Nixon collected all 28
GOP votes.
Strong Everywhere
McGovern did well all over the

state, but Wallace amassed most of his
support in areas with heavy Republi
can registration. McGovern led from
the very start, holding 33 percent of
the vote at first. Even though that
margin steadily eroded, CBS projected
his victory at 6:34 p.m., and Associ
ated Press declared a McGovern
triumph at 8:10 p.m. 9
About 35 or 40 percent of the
registered Republicans in the state
moved over and voted Democratic,
taking advantage of Wisconsin's cross
filing system that makes such shifts
easy. The result was joy in the
McGovern camp and overwhelming
gloom for Muskie followers.
Wisconsin political analysts theo
rized that most of the Republican
votes were going to Wallace—allowing
the conservative Southerner to beat
out Muskie for third place—with GOP
liberals casting their ballots for Mc-
Govern.
"Where it went is very difficult to
tell," Humphrey told newsmen of the
Republican cross-balloting, "but I
don't think it helped me."
Muskie Troubles
Humphrey's performance was
respectable, and will keep him in the
race. But things don't look too bright
for Muskie. The Maine legislator rode a
series of glittering endorsements from
fellow senators and political luminaries
into the lead. His victory in the New
Hampshire primary last month, how
ever, was not of the gigantic propor
tions expected, and he took a
whipping in Florida, finishing fourth
with only nine percent of the vote.
His lead, everyone conceded last
night, is gone. He stands virtually even
with McGovern in total committed
votes, and takes the field as an equal
from here on.
The parties lasted well into the
night at McGovern headquarters across
the country. A spokesman at the Palo
Alto command post summed it up:
"It's about time! We couldn't have
taken another moral victory."
McGovern made a last minute bid
for the Democratic presidential nomin

ation in Chicago in 1968, and has been
running ever since. He was the first to
formally announce for the campaign
15 months ago, but national polls
showed less than 10 percent of the
voters in his column up till the
opening of the primary season in
February. He took a "moral victory"
in New Hampshire, holding Muskie to
48 percent of the vote.
McGovern In City
McGovern's headquarters an
nounced that the candiate will arrive
at San Francisco International Airport
tomorrow at noon for a fund raising
dinner in the city tomorrow night.
Larry Diamond, former ASSU presi
dent who works for the McGovem
organization, said he hoped the sena
tor would visit the campus, but
indicated there were no plans to do so
at present.
Lindsay's miserable showing
prompted him to drop out of the race
last night, joining Sen. Vance Hartke
of Indiana, Sen. Fred Harris of Okla
homa, Sen. Birch Bayh of Indiana,
Sen. Harold Hughes of lowa, and
Mayor Sam Yorty of Los Angeles—all
earlier casualties.
