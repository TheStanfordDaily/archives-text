North Viets Continue Drive
SAIGON — Tank-led North Vietnamese forces drove on
the key city of Quang Tri today in the seventh day of an
offensive that has thrust 10 miles into South Vietnam
from the demilitarized zone.
Units overran two more government bases and heavy
fighting was reported around the last remaining defense
anchor of Quang Tri, the northern provincial capital 19
miles south of the DMZ.
The U.S. Command said more than a score of U.S.
warplanes struck inside North Vietnam Monday and
yesterday against nine radar-controlled missile sites
threatening American bombers pounding the advancing
Communists.
The command said three of the sites were destroyed
and no American aircraft were damaged. The strikes were
in the northern half of the DMZ and just above it.
Columns of North Vietnamese tanks probed the main
South Vietnamese defense line along the Dong Ha River
10 miles south of the DMZ and approached the South
Vietnamese border from Laos. Government pilots said
they knocked out 11 tanks.
The United States sent its entire fleet of 852 bombers
and scores of fighter bombers to disrupt the plans for new
strikes. Five destroyers offshore added their firepower to
the pounding of enemy positions.
UJS. Bomber Force Bolstered
WASHINGTON — While officially holding open its
options on how to deal with North Vietnam's new
offensive, the Nixon administration bolstered the U.S.
852 bomber force in the Western Pacific by 25 percent
yesterday.
It was learned that about 20 of the eight-jet bombers
have been ordered to reinforce the 852 fleet already in
Thailand and Guam.
The Pentagon declined comment on the move, the
second by the Nixon administration this week to bolster
U.S. bombing power in Southeast Asia. Two additional
aircraft carriers were previously ordered to join two others
off the Vietnamese coast.
From a military standpoint, the U.S. officials said, it is
plain that stepped-up air attacks are the main recourse left
for U.S. forces in Vietnam. U.S. ground troops have
dwindled to the point where they are no longer available
for much combat action. And the U.S. withdrawals will be
proceeding, they said.
Publicly, White House press officer Gerald Warren said
that President Nixon is keeping all options open on what
the United States might do. The administration's inside
crisis unit, named the Washington Special Action Group,
met for the second time in two days on the Vietnam
situation.
At the Capitol, Senate Democratic leader Mike
Mansfield said he opposed any use of air power or U.S.
combat troops to counter the new offensive.
As for the Viet Cong demand in Paris that the allies
return to the peace talks tomorrow, McCloskey backed
South Vietnam's refusal to attempt a session at this time.
The United States is saying that negotiations cannot be
held under the pressure of an enemy offensive.
U.S. Recognizes Bangladesh
WASHINGTON - The United States yesterday officially
recognized Bangladesh, the new nation carved out of the
former eastern province of Pakistan late last year with the
aid of the Indian army.
The action ends more than three months of varying
stances by the Nixon administration toward the new
nation.
The initial American response to Bangladesh when it
won its independence in December was one of reticence,

with spokesmen saying at the time recognition was not
being considered.
Baseball Owners Meet, Strike On
CHICAGO — Major league baseball owners met for five
hours last night and again turned down the players
association's latest proposal, which might have ended
major league baseball's first strike.
John J. Gaherin, representing the owners, said the
baseball owners are convinced that the players' demand
for a 17 percent increase in pension benefit funds is
unreasonable.
Gaherin said there was no sentiment among the owners
to accept the players' proposal.
"In the interest of the public and the game of
baseball," said Gaherin, "the clubs called upon the players
association to direct the players to rejoin their clubs so
that the season may commence as soon as it is
practicable."
The players walked out Saturday and the season had
been scheduled to open today. But the only game,
Houston at Cincinnati, was postponed yesterday.
Gaherin admitted that there was no difference from
the owners' original stand and added as yet the players
association has not made any proposal which the owners
are ready to accept.
Gaherin said he would attempt to contact Marvin
Miller, negotiator for the players association, in the
morning, "if I can." Miller was in Cincinnati last night for
a meeting with Reds players.
Berrigan Deliberations Continue
HARRISBURG, Pa. — A jury trying the Rev. Philip
Berrigan and six others on kidnap-bomb conspiracy
charges asked yesterday for more time for deliberations,
saying: "For the past two hours there has been progress
made."
The foreman, Harold Sheets, told U.S. District Court
Judge R. Dixon Herman, however, that he foresaw no
verdict before today at the earliest.
Nine women and three men on the jury reported
Sunday that they were deadlocked on the key features of
a government indictment charging Berrigan and six other
antiwar activists with a plot to kidnap White House aide
Henry Kissinger and blow up a government tunnel heating
system in Washington, D.C., and vandalize draft boards in
various states.
Herman directed at that time that they resume
deliberations in an attempt to reach an overall verdict.
The jury had found Berrigan guilty of a single count in the
indictment of smuggling a letter out of the federal
penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pa.
The defense objected on the spot to continuing the
jury deliberations, and renewed its objections Monday and
yesterday, charging the jury was "being coerced into a
compromise verdict."
"Further forced deliberations by this jury would be
prejudicial to the defendants," defense lawyer Thomas
Menaker said in a formal handwritten motion, again
asking that the jury be discharged.
Adam Clayton Powell Dies
MIAMI — Adam Clayton Powell, a controversial former
New York Congressman, died here last night of
complications following prostate surgery.
Powell, 63, had been critically ill for several weeks
after being stricken at his Bahamas retreat of Bimini.
He represented Manhattan's Harlem in the House of
Representatives for years until being defeated for
re-election in 1970. Alleged improprieties in use of
government funds led to his exclusion from Congress in
1967. He was readmitted two years later.
