# School Board Candidates Speak
## 
### LARRY HUMMER 
Five of six candidates for school
board trustee of the Palo Alto Unified
School District spoke to fifty persons
last night in Cubberley Auditorium.
The candidates, vying for a single seat
on the board, are in an election April
18.
The meeting began with opening
statements by the candidates, and then
the floor was opened to questions.
Doug Garrett, Venceremos mem
ber, and Greg Kerber, a tennis
instructor, are the two radicals in the
election. Both claimed the main issue
in the election is the purpose of
education and backed greater student
control of decision-making.
Garrett termed the issues raised by
liberal candidates to be "political
smokescreens."
Kerber claimed it was impossible tc
look at the school system as an
isolated segment of society. "Funda
mental economic changes," said Ker
ber, "must come before any changes in
the schools."

Eleanor Kraft, an attorney, empha
sized her experience in family law, and
family and marriage counseling. She
put stress on gearing education toward
the individual child.
Sally Siegel, former Palo Alto-
Stanford coordinator for Wilson Riles'
campaign for State Superintendent of
Public Instruction, told of her exper
ience working in local public groups
and observing school board meetings.
Ted Vian, another attorney, stres
sed the importance of small class size
and the importance of other social
organizations outside the schools in
combatting drug abuse.
All candidates supported the recent
California Supreme Court decision
requiring equal financing statewide of
public school education. The decision
has led to searches for alternatives to
the property tax as a means of
financing schools.
It is expected that Palo Alto, a
wealthy community, will be paying
more school taxes in the future while
getting less revenue for its schools.

Virginia Williams, another candi
date, was not present at the meeting.
The meeting was organized by Joel
Goodman, a graduate student in the
School of Education who has worked
as a student teacher in the Palo Alto
schools. He said he was disappointed
by the small audience which he said
demonstrated the apathy of Stanford
students toward the Palo Alto School
Board. Students registered on the
campus before February 24 are eligible
to vote in the election.
