# Chances 'Bleak' For Law School Applicants
## 
### CARLA KALLAN 
Students now headed in droves for
law schools across the country may
soon face the same employment
problems which confront engineers,
Ph.D.'s, and schoolteachers.
Concern for a potential oversupply
of lawyers is expressed both by
national leaders in the profession and
by law school placement officers.
Law school enrollment nationally
has more than doubled in the past
decade. It shot up from 40,381 in
1960 to 82,041 in 1970, with more
than half of this growth occurring in
the last two years. At this moment,
94,468 students attend law schools
approved by the American Bar As
sociation, an enrollment increase of
nearly 20 percent over last year.
What does this mean for the
potential law student? The Fall 1970
ABA survey demonstrated that almost
all accredited law schools were filled
to capacity. There may well be no
unfilled seats in accredited law schools
for this Fall's entering class.
The demands for legal education
are even greater. The Law School
Admission Test, a prerequisite for
almost all law applicants, indicates
that in 1970-71, there was an increase
of 43.8 percent over 1969-70. This
year, applications are running well
ahead of last year's figures.
The ABA Consultant on Legal

Education has estimated that more
than two applicants competed last
year for every first-year class position,
and that virtually all ABA-approved
law schools turned away applicants
who would have been admitted three
years ago.
Need More Facilities
Alfred E. Conard, president of the
Association of American Law Schools,
commented, "Until now, law schools
have been able to keep pace with the
steady increase in enrollment, but the
current and projected influx of stu
dents will soon far outstrip all
available accredited facilities."
An unusually large number of
college graduates and a shortage of
employment opportunities have creat
ed a shift from other graduate, Ph.D.
and professional programs into law.
Legal opportunities are also open
ing up for minority students, and
women view law as an attractive and
viable profession. Many college stu
dents also feel that law is "the place to
be" to effect social change by working
through the system. Some have actual
ly been out of school two or three
years trying other routes of change,
and are now seeking the legal alterna
tive.
Finally, law school has become
something of a catch-all. Andy Kaplan,
at the University of California's Boalt
Hall Placement Office, explained that

"it seems to be the culmination of
almost any background: English,
psychology, or history."
It is obvious that there will be
many disappointed law school appli
cants this fall, but the question of
what should be done is not clear. If
more law schools were established,
would there be an economic demand
for the greater number of emerging
lawyers?
In 1960, the number of new
admissions to the Bar was approxi
mately 10,000. By 1970, it approach
ed 20,000. In 1973, it is expected to
hit the 27,000 mark. The capacity of
the legal profession to absorb and
utilize these new members in meaning
ful roles is dubious.
Robert W. Meserve, president-elect
of the American Bar Association,
addressed this problem January 22 at a
midyear meeting of the State Bar of
Michigan: "We have before us the
horrible example of the hard scientists,
physicists, mathematicians, and the
like. This situation cannot be permit
ted to occur in the legal profession."
Lawyers Deluge Market
But it seems that the crunch is
already on. Tremendous numbers of
qualified lawyers are spilling into the
job market at a time when pressure is
great to reduce legal expenses. The
very areas of law that employ most
people and produce the greatest

income—personal injury, domestic
relations, and probate—are being
dramatically reduced or eliminated.
"No fault" insurance could deva
state the area of personal injury, the
source of 15-20 percent of the legal
profession's total revenue. This insur
ance plan would replace legal action
by administrative measures.
Kaplan explained, "The job market
is being killed. There are just too many
lawyers. If you graduate from Boalt in
