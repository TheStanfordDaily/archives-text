# Prosecutor Schwartz Presents Evidence To Show Ho's Alleged Conduct Violation
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
University prosecutor John
Schwartz attempted to prove that
defendant Kwonping Ho had indeed
violated the Fundamental Standard as
the full Campus Judicial Panel met last
night.
The original charge accused Ho of
violating the Fundamental Standard
by assaulting Faculty Club chef Arturo
Lionetti and forcing his way into the
kitchen "for the purpose of stealing
food" during a demonstration January
24.

In a report issued February 29,
hearing officer Leslie Minkus found
Ho innocent of assault and found that
Ho did not enter the Faculty Club
"for the purpose of stealing food."
Minkus did find, however, that Ho
encouraged others to help him gain
access to the hallway leading to the
kitchen and, with others, forcibly
opened the doors leading to that
hallway.
Schwartz asserted it was the Univer
sity's position that "simply calling
upon other people to force the doors

open" and then trying to keep them
open against the will of the manage
ment of the Faculty Club is something
"intolerable" to the University com
munity.
Philosophy Professor David Nivi
son, a member of the panel, told
Schwartz, "The question is did you
contend this in making the charge."
'Aggravating Circumstance'
Schwartz responded that the
second part of the charge consisted of
two different things: that Ho forced
his way into the kitchen, and that, as
an "aggravating circumstance," he did
so for the purpose of stealing food.
Another panel member, Electrical
Engineering Professor Robert White,
said he believed, however, that "if the
purpose is undercut, then the charge is
undercut."
Schwartz likened Ho's case to that
of someone charged with assault with
intent to kill who is found innocent of
having intent to kill but is still found
guilty of assault. He agreed that Ho's
pushing through the doors was tanta
mount to a lesser included offense.
Defense co-counsel Wally Hunkeler
insisted that the assault analogy was
not applicable in this case because
"assault in itself is an offense,"
whereas there can be many legal

reasons for forcible entry.
Hunkeler claimed, "In defeating
any intention of stealing food, we felt
the charge was defeated."
Charge Misleading
Accusing the original charge of
being misleading, co-counsel Zack
Wasserman said, "Once you drop the
intent requirement, the whole posture
of the case becomes different."
The defense cited Rule 3 of the CJP
procedures which states, in part, "The
complaint and the notice shall contain
a specification of the act upon which
the charge is based and the regulation
allegedly violated . . The defense
continually objected that Schwartz did
not originally charge that forcing
through the doors to the hallway was a
violation of the Fundamental Stand
ard.
Hunkeler stated that the only
reason events at the hallway doors
were brought up during the hearings
was that they were "intimately bound
up with the assault charge."
Hunkeler continued, "Ho was en
trapped into admitting something that
could now be considered an offense"
referring to llo's testimony about the
alleged assault.
Wasserman further argued, 'The
phrases of the Fundamental Standard
do not help anyone particularly in
preparing a defense" because the
Standard is too vague.
Hunkeler added, "We asked for
clarification of the charges and the
charges at the beginning were [given
as] assault and burglary."
Schwartz said he would never have
agreed to the classification of the
second charge as "burglary," to which
CJP chairman John Kaplan responded,
"I've got to admit it does look like a
burglary charge to me."
In summation, Hunkeler claimed,
"Mr. Schwartz has made an attempt to
introduce evidence not to be found in
the hearing officer's report ... We feel
that there is no violation of the
Fundamental Standard."
On the issue of potential sentence,
Hunkeler said, "There can be no
conviction here and there is no need in
proceeding."

Defense co-counsel Wally Hunkeler
insisted that the assault analogy was
not applicable in this case because
"assault in itself is an offense,"
whereas there can be many legal

reasons for forcible entry.
Hunkeler claimed, "In defeating
any intention of stealing food, we felt
the charge was defeated."
Charge Misleading
Accusing the original charge of
being misleading, co-counsel Zack
Wasserman said, "Once you drop the
intent requirement, the whole posture
of the case becomes different."
The defense cited Rule 3 of the CJP
procedures which states, in part, "The
complaint and the notice shall contain
a specification of the act upon which
the charge is based and the regulation
allegedly violated . . The defense
continually objected that Schwartz did
not originally charge that forcing
through the doors to the hallway was a
violation of the Fundamental Stand
ard.
Hunkeler stated that the only
reason events at the hallway doors
were brought up during the hearings
was that they were "intimately bound
up with the assault charge."
Hunkeler continued, "Ho was en
trapped into admitting something that
could now be considered an offense"
referring to llo's testimony about the
alleged assault.
Wasserman further argued, 'The
phrases of the Fundamental Standard
do not help anyone particularly in
preparing a defense" because the
Standard is too vague.
Hunkeler added, "We asked for
clarification of the charges and the
charges at the beginning were [given
as] assault and burglary."
Schwartz said he would never have
agreed to the classification of the
second charge as "burglary," to which
CJP chairman John Kaplan responded,
"I've got to admit it does look like a
burglary charge to me."
In summation, Hunkeler claimed,
"Mr. Schwartz has made an attempt to
introduce evidence not to be found in
the hearing officer's report ... We feel
that there is no violation of the
Fundamental Standard."
On the issue of potential sentence,
Hunkeler said, "There can be no
conviction here and there is no need in
proceeding."

HEARINGS—Members of the Campus Judicial Panel (CJP)—David Nivison, chairman of the Philosophy Department;
Charles Stiver, law student; and John Kaplan, CJP Chairman—listen to defense and prosecution arguments over
Kwonping Ho's alleged participation in the January 24 Faculty Club "eat-in." The CJP hearing on the case was held
last night.
University prosecutor John
Schwartz attempted to prove that
defendant Kwonping Ho had indeed
violated the Fundamental Standard as
the full Campus Judicial Panel met last
night.
The original charge accused Ho of
violating the Fundamental Standard
by assaulting Faculty Club chef Arturo
Lionetti and forcing his way into the
kitchen "for the purpose of stealing
food" during a demonstration January
24.

In a report issued February 29,
hearing officer Leslie Minkus found
Ho innocent of assault and found that
Ho did not enter the Faculty Club
"for the purpose of stealing food."
Minkus did find, however, that Ho
encouraged others to help him gain
access to the hallway leading to the
kitchen and, with others, forcibly
opened the doors leading to that
hallway.
Schwartz asserted it was the Univer
sity's position that "simply calling
upon other people to force the doors

open" and then trying to keep them
open against the will of the manage
ment of the Faculty Club is something
"intolerable" to the University com
munity.
Philosophy Professor David Nivi
son, a member of the panel, told
Schwartz, "The question is did you
contend this in making the charge."
'Aggravating Circumstance'
Schwartz responded that the
second part of the charge consisted of
two different things: that Ho forced
his way into the kitchen, and that, as
an "aggravating circumstance," he did
so for the purpose of stealing food.
Another panel member, Electrical
Engineering Professor Robert White,
said he believed, however, that "if the
purpose is undercut, then the charge is
undercut."
Schwartz likened Ho's case to that
of someone charged with assault with
intent to kill who is found innocent of
having intent to kill but is still found
guilty of assault. He agreed that Ho's
pushing through the doors was tanta
mount to a lesser included offense.
Defense co-counsel Wally Hunkeler
insisted that the assault analogy was
not applicable in this case because
"assault in itself is an offense,"
whereas there can be many legal

reasons for forcible entry.
