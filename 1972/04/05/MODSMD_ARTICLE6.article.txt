Errors
Editor, THE DAILY:
Two minor errors of fact mar
your story of Aprid 3rd on Miller,
Schwartz, Siena and me.
First, the grand salary you
generously assigned to me must
belong to someone else. 1 hope
you will make this clear or I will
never be able to persuade my wife
that I am not keeping a secred
pied a terre ("Pad", in the
vernacular) with the difference
between what I bring home and
what you said I should be bringing
home.
Second, in the course of
preliminary research for the book
tentatively titled "The Liberal:
His Evolution in Times of

Radicalism", I decided that
autobiography at my age is either
hubris or chutzpa. Therefore, I
changed the direction of my
research and the new tentative
title of my book is, "The
Manipulation of Student Dissent:
The Case of the People's Republic
of China". It is true that I neither
read nor speak Chinese, but my
experience at Stanford has
convinced me that I am not
thereby barred from asserting my
views on Chinese history, politics,
economics, society, culture,

health care, cuisine, sanitary
system, sports, and education as
authoriatively as the next fellow.

The Daily has misrepresented
my request to President Bok of
Harvard for a forum to answer the
attacks on me by SDS. I did not,
as the Daily prints, demand "to
speak on his theories that black's
genetic qualities give them lower
intelligence."
The telegram that I read to the
Daily stated:
"If notified before noon
California time Saturday, I could
come at no expense to Harvard to
speak or debate on Sunday April
2. My discussion would be both
technical and ethical. I would

focus on the intellectual
obligation that I expressed in
Presbyterian Life of February first
as three moral postulates: Truth —
Concern — Death. I propose these
moral postulates in an attempt to
correct a flat human quality
illusion far more dangerous to
humanity's future than was the
flat earth illusion of Galileo's
day."

McCloskey
Editor, THE DAILY:
I can see one good reason for
being a Democrat: to vote for
McGovern, and one for being a
Republican: to vote for
McCloskey. Unfortunately
McGovern doesn't have a chance.
But McCloskey has, but needs
every vote to remain in Congress.
He is strongly for quick and
full withdrawal from Vietnam, is
fighting almost a lone battle
against the seniority system, plays
an important role in congress for
ecology, and is outspoken against
the systematic deceptions of the
administration.
Because it is very important to
keep McCloskey in Congress, I urge
Democrats at Stanford to change
registration to the Republican
Party. After all the two parties are
about equally dying and corrupt.

Concern — Death. I propose these

flat earth illusion of Galileo's

McCloskey
Editor, THE DAILY:
I can see one good reason for
being a Democrat: to vote for
McGovern, and one for being a
Republican: to vote for
McCloskey. Unfortunately
McGovern doesn't have a chance.
But McCloskey has, but needs
every vote to remain in Congress.
He is strongly for quick and
full withdrawal from Vietnam, is
fighting almost a lone battle
against the seniority system, plays
an important role in congress for
ecology, and is outspoken against
the systematic deceptions of the
administration.
Because it is very important to
keep McCloskey in Congress, I urge
Democrats at Stanford to change
registration to the Republican
Party. After all the two parties are
about equally dying and corrupt.

Errors
Editor, THE DAILY:
Two minor errors of fact mar
your story of Aprid 3rd on Miller,
Schwartz, Siena and me.
First, the grand salary you
generously assigned to me must
belong to someone else. 1 hope
you will make this clear or I will
never be able to persuade my wife
that I am not keeping a secred
pied a terre ("Pad", in the
vernacular) with the difference
between what I bring home and
what you said I should be bringing
home.
Second, in the course of
preliminary research for the book
tentatively titled "The Liberal:
His Evolution in Times of

Radicalism", I decided that
autobiography at my age is either
hubris or chutzpa. Therefore, I
changed the direction of my
research and the new tentative
title of my book is, "The
Manipulation of Student Dissent:
The Case of the People's Republic
of China". It is true that I neither
read nor speak Chinese, but my
experience at Stanford has
convinced me that I am not
thereby barred from asserting my
views on Chinese history, politics,
economics, society, culture,

health care, cuisine, sanitary
system, sports, and education as
authoriatively as the next fellow.

Telegram
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Daily has misrepresented
my request to President Bok of
Harvard for a forum to answer the
attacks on me by SDS. I did not,
as the Daily prints, demand "to
speak on his theories that black's
genetic qualities give them lower
intelligence."
The telegram that I read to the
Daily stated:
"If notified before noon
California time Saturday, I could
come at no expense to Harvard to
speak or debate on Sunday April
2. My discussion would be both
technical and ethical. I would

focus on the intellectual
obligation that I expressed in
Presbyterian Life of February first
as three moral postulates: Truth —
Concern — Death. I propose these
moral postulates in an attempt to
correct a flat human quality
illusion far more dangerous to
humanity's future than was the
