## Easter Salvation Sweepstakes 
### 
?barry wood

Over Easter weekend I had a
dream. I dreamed I won a
Sweepstake and was immediately
wafted up to a pink cloud where I
found myself before the throne of
God. I heard a loud voice in my
ear: "You are the winner of the
Easter Salvation Sweepstakes. For
the Grand Prize you get to play a
game with God. Please draw the
name of your game from the
Chance Jar." A little uneasy about
all this, I pulled a paper from the
Jar and on it were the words:
Twenty Questions. "What does
this mean?" 1 asked. "It means
you get to ask God twenty
questions and you have already
asked one. You have nineteen
questions left."
Very curious about this voice
in my ear, and not seeing anyone
but God, who was quite silent, I
said to the voice "Who are you?"
"I am the Holy Ghost" came the
answer. "Well, you are standing
too close to my ear. Would you
mind stepping back a bit and not
shouting?" "Yes, I do mind. You
are blaspheming against the Holy
Ghost, but I will overlook it this
time. Please proceed, you have
seventeen questions left."
Sitting there on this pink cloud
and looking up at God, I noticed
that he was quite unlike anything
I had ever seen. "Are you animal,
vegetable or mineral?" I asked.
"Divine!" came back the answer
in a huge voice. Pondering the
little pink cloud for a moment, I

said "Am I in heaven?" "Only
temporarily" said the Lord.
"Then how can I get here
permanently?" I asked. The huge
voice boomed back: "You must
love me with all your mind and
heart and soul." After a moments
reflection I said: "Suppose I
refuse." But the Lord answered,
"You're not allowed to make
suppositions. This game is called
Twenty Questions. However, if
you refuse to love me with all
your mind and heart and soul,
you will be damned and sent to
hell. Now please restrain yourself
and stick to the rules of the game.
You have fourteen questions
left."
"Considering the punishment,"
I said, "for refusing to love you, it
would obviously be very prudent
to agree to it." "That's very true,"
replied the Godhead "but it is
rather speculative, and is most
certainly not a question. Please
stick to questions." "All right, all
right," I snapped, somewhat
annoyed by this time. "I agree to
love you with all my mind and
heart and soul. Will that do?"
"That is much better," said God.
"You are really getting the hang
of this game!" "Cut the flattery,"
I said, "and answer my question.
Will it do if I agree to love you?"
"Well, to be perfectly honest"
boomed the Godhead, "It won't
quite do. You see, you are really
not loving me voluntarily. True
love is spontaneous." Somewhat
taken aback by this, I cried out to
God the Father, Son and Holy
Ghost: "But how can I love you
voluntarily when you have told
me I must?" "That's your
problem" boomed all three in
chorus. "You have twelve
questions left."

I looked up at God on his
Golden throne, and at the Son on
his right side. Then I noticed a
suspicious dark creature with
horns on the left side of God. He
kept whispering things in God's
ear. I was sure this Devil belonged
elsewhere until I realized his name
was Lucifer. The Light Bearer.
Love
"All right," I said. "I have now
decided after considerable
thought that I do really love you
voluntarily, and I presume
therefore that I will get to
heaven." But the Godhead
wrinkled his head and boomed:
"You are wrong. You are guilty of
the Sin of Presumption, which
means you will surely go to hell
rather than heaven!" By now I
was boiling, but keeping my
temper, I asked: "Does this mean
that I must despair of ever getting
to heaven?"
And God said: "If you despair,
you are guilty of the Deadly Sin
of Despair, and you definitely will
not get into heaven." "Well," I
shouted indignantly, "If I can't
presume and I can't despair and I
must love you—voluntarily—how
am I even to know I'm saved?"
"That's your problem. You have
ten questions left."
"What the hell kind of a
Sweepstake is this anyway? So far
I haven't won anything." "It is
called the Easter Salvation
Sweepstake," said God, "and you
ought to ask your questions more
politely. You now only have nine
left." "All right, all right. I have
decided to really love you
voluntarily. What do you think of
that?" "Not much," said God,
"because you are a fallen creature,
a miserable little ragamuffin

sinner, and therefore quiU
incapable of voluntary love.'
"Well, dammit," I shouted, "hoy
does this system work?" "Well
you have to wait until I give yoij
My Grace."
Puzzling
Puzzling this a little, I said
"Do you give Grace tc
everybody?" "I offer it td
everybody, but not everyone
receives it." "Do those you
receive it get to heaven?" "Yes,"
said God, "provided they don't
get proud of having Grace."
"Then those who don't receive
Grace are really those whom youi
have decided to damn?" "NO,i
NO, NO!" stormed the Godhead.
"They damn themselves by not
accepting what I offer!"
I jumped up, excited. "Then
those who are saved really save
themselves by accepting what you
offer?" "NO!" he said, scowling
fiercely. "Nobody can save
himself. People can only damn
themselves. It is ME who can save
them." "Then," I said, "Don't
you think this is an unfair
system?" "NO, you impudent
little creep! I designed it, and
everything I design is Perfect!
Now, damn you, I'm getting tired
of your questions. You have two
left. Hurry up and ask them!"
"What's this pink cloud made
from?" The booming voice
replied: "I don't know, and I
don't care. It was a donation. You
have one question left."
"What now?" I asked. "THIS"
he shouted giving me such a
terrible kick that I fell right off
the cloud and woke up. I found
myself on the floor geside my
bed, and it was Easter Morning.

that?" "Not much," said God,
"because you are a fallen creature,
a miserable little ragamuffin

sinner, and therefore quiU
incapable of voluntary love.'
"Well, dammit," I shouted, "hoy
does this system work?" "Well
you have to wait until I give yoij
My Grace."
Puzzling
Puzzling this a little, I said
"Do you give Grace tc
everybody?" "I offer it td
everybody, but not everyone
receives it." "Do those you
receive it get to heaven?" "Yes,"
said God, "provided they don't
get proud of having Grace."
"Then those who don't receive
Grace are really those whom youi
have decided to damn?" "NO,i
NO, NO!" stormed the Godhead.
"They damn themselves by not
accepting what I offer!"
I jumped up, excited. "Then
those who are saved really save
themselves by accepting what you
offer?" "NO!" he said, scowling
fiercely. "Nobody can save
himself. People can only damn
themselves. It is ME who can save
them." "Then," I said, "Don't
you think this is an unfair
system?" "NO, you impudent
little creep! I designed it, and
everything I design is Perfect!
Now, damn you, I'm getting tired
of your questions. You have two
left. Hurry up and ask them!"
"What's this pink cloud made
from?" The booming voice
replied: "I don't know, and I
don't care. It was a donation. You
have one question left."
"What now?" I asked. "THIS"
he shouted giving me such a
terrible kick that I fell right off
the cloud and woke up. I found
myself on the floor geside my
bed, and it was Easter Morning.

Over Easter weekend I had a
dream. I dreamed I won a
Sweepstake and was immediately
wafted up to a pink cloud where I
found myself before the throne of
God. I heard a loud voice in my
ear: "You are the winner of the
Easter Salvation Sweepstakes. For
the Grand Prize you get to play a
game with God. Please draw the
name of your game from the
Chance Jar." A little uneasy about
all this, I pulled a paper from the
Jar and on it were the words:
Twenty Questions. "What does
this mean?" 1 asked. "It means
you get to ask God twenty
questions and you have already
asked one. You have nineteen
questions left."
Very curious about this voice
in my ear, and not seeing anyone
but God, who was quite silent, I
said to the voice "Who are you?"
"I am the Holy Ghost" came the
answer. "Well, you are standing
too close to my ear. Would you
mind stepping back a bit and not
shouting?" "Yes, I do mind. You
are blaspheming against the Holy
Ghost, but I will overlook it this
time. Please proceed, you have
seventeen questions left."
Sitting there on this pink cloud
and looking up at God, I noticed
that he was quite unlike anything
I had ever seen. "Are you animal,
vegetable or mineral?" I asked.
"Divine!" came back the answer
in a huge voice. Pondering the
little pink cloud for a moment, I

said "Am I in heaven?" "Only
temporarily" said the Lord.
"Then how can I get here
permanently?" I asked. The huge
voice boomed back: "You must
love me with all your mind and
heart and soul." After a moments
reflection I said: "Suppose I
refuse." But the Lord answered,
"You're not allowed to make
suppositions. This game is called
Twenty Questions. However, if
you refuse to love me with all
your mind and heart and soul,
you will be damned and sent to
hell. Now please restrain yourself
and stick to the rules of the game.
You have fourteen questions
left."
"Considering the punishment,"
I said, "for refusing to love you, it
would obviously be very prudent
to agree to it." "That's very true,"
replied the Godhead "but it is
rather speculative, and is most
certainly not a question. Please
stick to questions." "All right, all
right," I snapped, somewhat
annoyed by this time. "I agree to
love you with all my mind and
heart and soul. Will that do?"
"That is much better," said God.
"You are really getting the hang
of this game!" "Cut the flattery,"
I said, "and answer my question.
Will it do if I agree to love you?"
"Well, to be perfectly honest"
boomed the Godhead, "It won't
quite do. You see, you are really
not loving me voluntarily. True
love is spontaneous." Somewhat
taken aback by this, I cried out to
God the Father, Son and Holy
Ghost: "But how can I love you
voluntarily when you have told
me I must?" "That's your
problem" boomed all three in
chorus. "You have twelve
questions left."

I looked up at God on his
Golden throne, and at the Son on
his right side. Then I noticed a
suspicious dark creature with
horns on the left side of God. He
kept whispering things in God's
ear. I was sure this Devil belonged
elsewhere until I realized his name
was Lucifer. The Light Bearer.
Love
"All right," I said. "I have now
decided after considerable
thought that I do really love you
voluntarily, and I presume
therefore that I will get to
heaven." But the Godhead
wrinkled his head and boomed:
"You are wrong. You are guilty of
the Sin of Presumption, which
means you will surely go to hell
rather than heaven!" By now I
was boiling, but keeping my
temper, I asked: "Does this mean
that I must despair of ever getting
to heaven?"
And God said: "If you despair,
you are guilty of the Deadly Sin
of Despair, and you definitely will
not get into heaven." "Well," I
shouted indignantly, "If I can't
presume and I can't despair and I
must love you—voluntarily—how
am I even to know I'm saved?"
"That's your problem. You have
ten questions left."
"What the hell kind of a
Sweepstake is this anyway? So far
I haven't won anything." "It is
called the Easter Salvation
Sweepstake," said God, "and you
ought to ask your questions more
politely. You now only have nine
left." "All right, all right. I have
decided to really love you
voluntarily. What do you think of
that?" "Not much," said God,
"because you are a fallen creature,
a miserable little ragamuffin

sinner, and therefore quiU
incapable of voluntary love.'

taken aback by this, I cried out to
God the Father, Son and Holy
Ghost: "But how can I love you
voluntarily when you have told
me I must?" "That's your
problem" boomed all three in
chorus. "You have twelve
questions left."

I looked up at God on his
Golden throne, and at the Son on
his right side. Then I noticed a
suspicious dark creature with
horns on the left side of God. He
kept whispering things in God's
ear. I was sure this Devil belonged
elsewhere until I realized his name
was Lucifer. The Light Bearer.
Love
"All right," I said. "I have now
decided after considerable
thought that I do really love you
voluntarily, and I presume
therefore that I will get to
heaven." But the Godhead
wrinkled his head and boomed:
"You are wrong. You are guilty of
the Sin of Presumption, which
means you will surely go to hell
rather than heaven!" By now I
was boiling, but keeping my
temper, I asked: "Does this mean
that I must despair of ever getting
to heaven?"
And God said: "If you despair,
you are guilty of the Deadly Sin
of Despair, and you definitely will
not get into heaven." "Well," I
shouted indignantly, "If I can't
presume and I can't despair and I
must love you—voluntarily—how
am I even to know I'm saved?"
"That's your problem. You have
ten questions left."
"What the hell kind of a
Sweepstake is this anyway? So far
I haven't won anything." "It is
called the Easter Salvation
Sweepstake," said God, "and you
ought to ask your questions more
politely. You now only have nine
left." "All right, all right. I have
decided to really love you
voluntarily. What do you think of
that?" "Not much," said God,
"because you are a fallen creature,
a miserable little ragamuffin

sinner, and therefore quiU
incapable of voluntary love.'
"Well, dammit," I shouted, "hoy
does this system work?" "Well
you have to wait until I give yoij
My Grace."
Puzzling
Puzzling this a little, I said
"Do you give Grace tc
everybody?" "I offer it td
everybody, but not everyone
receives it." "Do those you
receive it get to heaven?" "Yes,"
said God, "provided they don't
get proud of having Grace."
"Then those who don't receive
Grace are really those whom youi
have decided to damn?" "NO,i
NO, NO!" stormed the Godhead.
"They damn themselves by not
accepting what I offer!"
I jumped up, excited. "Then
those who are saved really save
themselves by accepting what you
offer?" "NO!" he said, scowling
fiercely. "Nobody can save
himself. People can only damn
themselves. It is ME who can save
them." "Then," I said, "Don't
you think this is an unfair
system?" "NO, you impudent
little creep! I designed it, and
everything I design is Perfect!
Now, damn you, I'm getting tired
of your questions. You have two
left. Hurry up and ask them!"
"What's this pink cloud made
from?" The booming voice
replied: "I don't know, and I
don't care. It was a donation. You
have one question left."
"What now?" I asked. "THIS"
he shouted giving me such a
terrible kick that I fell right off
the cloud and woke up. I found
myself on the floor geside my
bed, and it was Easter Morning.

Over Easter weekend I had a
dream. I dreamed I won a
Sweepstake and was immediately
wafted up to a pink cloud where I
found myself before the throne of
God. I heard a loud voice in my
ear: "You are the winner of the
Easter Salvation Sweepstakes. For
the Grand Prize you get to play a
game with God. Please draw the
name of your game from the
Chance Jar." A little uneasy about
all this, I pulled a paper from the
Jar and on it were the words:
Twenty Questions. "What does
this mean?" 1 asked. "It means
you get to ask God twenty
questions and you have already
asked one. You have nineteen
questions left."
Very curious about this voice
in my ear, and not seeing anyone
but God, who was quite silent, I
said to the voice "Who are you?"
"I am the Holy Ghost" came the
answer. "Well, you are standing
too close to my ear. Would you
mind stepping back a bit and not
shouting?" "Yes, I do mind. You
are blaspheming against the Holy
Ghost, but I will overlook it this
time. Please proceed, you have
seventeen questions left."
Sitting there on this pink cloud
and looking up at God, I noticed
that he was quite unlike anything
I had ever seen. "Are you animal,
vegetable or mineral?" I asked.
"Divine!" came back the answer
in a huge voice. Pondering the
little pink cloud for a moment, I

said "Am I in heaven?" "Only
temporarily" said the Lord.
"Then how can I get here
permanently?" I asked. The huge
voice boomed back: "You must
love me with all your mind and
heart and soul." After a moments
reflection I said: "Suppose I
refuse." But the Lord answered,
"You're not allowed to make
suppositions. This game is called
Twenty Questions. However, if
you refuse to love me with all
your mind and heart and soul,
you will be damned and sent to
hell. Now please restrain yourself
and stick to the rules of the game.
You have fourteen questions
left."
"Considering the punishment,"
I said, "for refusing to love you, it
would obviously be very prudent
to agree to it." "That's very true,"
replied the Godhead "but it is
rather speculative, and is most
certainly not a question. Please
stick to questions." "All right, all
right," I snapped, somewhat
annoyed by this time. "I agree to
love you with all my mind and
heart and soul. Will that do?"
"That is much better," said God.
"You are really getting the hang
of this game!" "Cut the flattery,"
I said, "and answer my question.
Will it do if I agree to love you?"
"Well, to be perfectly honest"
boomed the Godhead, "It won't
quite do. You see, you are really
not loving me voluntarily. True
love is spontaneous." Somewhat
taken aback by this, I cried out to
God the Father, Son and Holy
Ghost: "But how can I love you
voluntarily when you have told
me I must?" "That's your
