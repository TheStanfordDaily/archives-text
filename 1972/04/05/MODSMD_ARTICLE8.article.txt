## Is The Machine Dead?

Although the voters in Illinois
spoke on March 21, the results of
the Illinois primary are still quite
important. There are a number of
people who feel that the Chicago
Democratic Machine of Richard J.
Daley is on its last legs as a result
of two independent Democrats
winning major victories in the
Democratic primary there. Well
my friends, I hate to shock you
out of these delusions of
grandeur, but Mayor Daley's
organization is alive and kicking,
probably as strong as ever.
The numbers in an Illinois
primary do not tell all that much.
It is true that independent Dan
Walker defeated organization
candidate for governor, Paul
Simon, by 45,000 votes. But you
can not analyze this political
victory by merely looking at the
final tallies. They tell you who
won but they don't tell how. In
the case of Dan Walker, a number
of hidden factors led to his upset

of Paul Simon, the present
lieutenant governor.
Dan Walker is a maverick
politician. He made a 1,200 mile
walk last summer from downstate
Illinois up. to Chicago and this
earned him some much-needed
free publicity. It was this kind of
publicity that he would need to
win over sympathetic Democrats
and defeat the Machine.
However, there was a facet
overlooked in the Daily article
which was very likely the main
reason for Walker's defeat of
Simon. About a week before the
primary, the Illinois Supreme
Court threw out an old Illinois
statute requiring that party
switching in primaries be done 23
months before the contest. The
high court ruled that a voter could
take either a Republican or
Democratic ballot in the primary,
regardless of the party he declared
when he registered.
Result: Thousands and
thousands of Republican voters
across Illinois took Democratic
ballots and proceeded to vote for
independent and second rate
Democratic candidates in order to
embarrass the Daley organization.
Cook county state's attorney
Edward Hanrahan, 'dumped' by
the Machine as a result of his
indictment in the Chicago Black
Panther shootout, also defeated
the organization candidate, old
time friend of the Mayor,

Raymond Berg. The question
raised by the major political
analysts in Chicago was whether
or not Hanrahan was really
Daley's man all along. Daley could
not officially support Hanrahan of
course, because this would
alienate much of the Black
community in Chicago.
But Daley could help Hanrahan
by not helping Berg. At a
Democratic Chinese dinner a few
weeks before the primary, the
notes inside the fortune cookies
read, "Hanrahan's The Man."
When Hanrahan walked past
Mayor Daley at the reviewing
stand in the St. Patrick's Day
Parade in Chicago, he tipped his
hat and out fluttered a white
dove.
Crossover
On election day, the huge
Republican crossover helped
Hanrahan indeed, but the
extremely poor Black turnout at
the polls was an even more
significant factor. When Daley has
to get out the Black vote, he does,
simple as that. A large Black vote
in this election would have
crippled Hanrahan; but Daley did
not get the Black vote out.
So what does this prove?
Simply that Daley wants control
of Chicago more than he wants a
Democratic governor. Daley is a
shrewd politician. He knows that
the Republicans who crossed over
and voted for independent
Democrats in the primary will
turn around in the fall and vote
for the Republican candidates,
again hoping to embarrass the
Machine. To contend, as did the
Daily article, that Walker has
dethroned Daley as the
Democratic leader in Illinois is
preposterous.
Daley's primary goal is to get
out the vote for his candidates in
November. He would like to see a
Democrat in the statehouse and
also in the White House. But
whether or not this is
accomplished, his candidates will
win in Cook county. If you doubt
this, wait until November and
take a look at the results in
Illinois.
