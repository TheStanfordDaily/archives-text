## Changing Vietnam Roles 
### 
iconcerned asian scholars

The fighting in Indochina is
intensifying. Its significance lies in
the radically changed
circumstances under which the
war is now being fought. Various
elements of the situation have
been in the process of
transformation for some time.
The most obviously altered
constituent is, of course, the
greatly diminished number of
American infantry present in
Vietnam. Although there are still
about 100,000 troops in that
country, those on combat status
compose only a small percentage
of that number.
The importance of this can be
appreciated by recalling the
extensive backup provided by the
U.S. Army during last year's
abortive invasion of Laos. The
fact that the territory recently
overrun by the North Vietnamese
is the same area from which the
Laos invasion was launched shows
the extent to which things have
changed.
Although not as well
publicized as the Vietnam
situation, an even more drastic
metamorphosis has been going on
in Laos and Cambodia. In the
continuing battle for the former
key CIA base at Long Cheng
(Laos), it has been reported that
several battalions of Lao troops

defected to the enemy, and Vang
Pao's CIA-run "secret army" has
been reduced to shooting its own
deserters.
While the military situation has
become more precarious in
Southeast Asia, Nixon still relies
in the end on the Saigon army.
Recent setbacks do not imply its
imminent demise. But assessment
of the present crisis is severely
impeded by another of the altered
circumstances: As part of
Vietnamization, the Saigon
information service has recently
been transferred to the hands of
Thieu's government.
While the old American
military information service was
less than ideal, it at least had the
virtues of consistency and a
familiar work style. The
contradictory reports, the
ommissions and the flagrant
exaggerations which have become
a standard fare since the change
make all war news of the past
three months highly suspect.
Confusion
As if the situation were not
tortuous enough already, the
unilateral American cancellation
of the Paris talks adds greatly to
the confusion. The action seems
at first glance to be just another
ploy in the negotiations game.
The latest offensive, however,
would indicate that the
Vietnamese, at least, do not
regard it as such.
If it was not such a tactical
move, then, what was it? It can
hardly be an expression of belief
in ultimate military victory. Even
Nixon surely does not see any
such light - at - the - end - of - the
tunnel in the currently
deteriorating situation.
To be comprehended, this
action must be seen as one of a
series. Beginning last summer with
the US's insistence on supporting
Thieu through the election farce,
every major American maneuver
has been a retreat from whatever
possibilities there once were for
neutralization and
demilitarization of the area.
Kissenger's exposure of the secret
talks, the Christmas bombings and
Nixon's bogus peace plan all fit
within this pattern.
The answer to all this seems to
be linked with Nixon's
expectations for gains from his
China trip. He expects most
concretely a reconstituted world
power balance. This envisions
China paying for her recognition
as a major power with a
willingness to abandon her
notions of third-world revolution
and independence.
The refusal to seek reasonable
compromise stems from this
world-view. All the small
countries of the world, especially
those in areas of high economic
potential, are to be beholden to
one of the super-powers.
The consequences of this
policy could not be more serious.
Rather than recognize the
legitimate aspirations of the
Indo-Chinese people, the
American government is
committed to imposing puppet
governments over them.

It is because of this insistence
upon partioning the world into
"ours" and "theirs" that the
tragedy of Indo-China will
continue. The saturation bombing
of North Vietnam has already
begun again, it has never ceased in
Laos. The Vietnamese have ceased
to believe in any possibility of
compromise and launched this
offensive. The choices Nixon has
made and continues to make
ensures that even in the event of
US defeat in Indo-China the war
will go on.

Confusion
As if the situation were not
tortuous enough already, the
unilateral American cancellation
of the Paris talks adds greatly to
the confusion. The action seems
at first glance to be just another
ploy in the negotiations game.
The latest offensive, however,
would indicate that the
Vietnamese, at least, do not
regard it as such.
If it was not such a tactical
move, then, what was it? It can
hardly be an expression of belief
in ultimate military victory. Even
Nixon surely does not see any
such light - at - the - end - of - the
tunnel in the currently
deteriorating situation.
To be comprehended, this
action must be seen as one of a
series. Beginning last summer with
the US's insistence on supporting
Thieu through the election farce,
every major American maneuver
has been a retreat from whatever
possibilities there once were for
neutralization and
demilitarization of the area.
Kissenger's exposure of the secret
talks, the Christmas bombings and
Nixon's bogus peace plan all fit
within this pattern.
The answer to all this seems to
be linked with Nixon's
expectations for gains from his
China trip. He expects most
concretely a reconstituted world
power balance. This envisions
China paying for her recognition
as a major power with a
willingness to abandon her
notions of third-world revolution
and independence.
The refusal to seek reasonable
compromise stems from this
world-view. All the small
countries of the world, especially
those in areas of high economic
potential, are to be beholden to
one of the super-powers.
The consequences of this
policy could not be more serious.
Rather than recognize the
legitimate aspirations of the
Indo-Chinese people, the
American government is
committed to imposing puppet
governments over them.

It is because of this insistence
upon partioning the world into
"ours" and "theirs" that the
tragedy of Indo-China will
continue. The saturation bombing
of North Vietnam has already
begun again, it has never ceased in
Laos. The Vietnamese have ceased
to believe in any possibility of
compromise and launched this
offensive. The choices Nixon has
made and continues to make
ensures that even in the event of
US defeat in Indo-China the war
will go on.

The fighting in Indochina is
intensifying. Its significance lies in
the radically changed
circumstances under which the
war is now being fought. Various
elements of the situation have
been in the process of
transformation for some time.
The most obviously altered
constituent is, of course, the
greatly diminished number of
American infantry present in
Vietnam. Although there are still
about 100,000 troops in that
country, those on combat status
compose only a small percentage
of that number.
The importance of this can be
appreciated by recalling the
extensive backup provided by the
U.S. Army during last year's
abortive invasion of Laos. The
fact that the territory recently
overrun by the North Vietnamese
is the same area from which the
Laos invasion was launched shows
the extent to which things have
changed.
Although not as well
publicized as the Vietnam
situation, an even more drastic
metamorphosis has been going on
in Laos and Cambodia. In the
continuing battle for the former
key CIA base at Long Cheng
(Laos), it has been reported that
several battalions of Lao troops

defected to the enemy, and Vang
Pao's CIA-run "secret army" has
been reduced to shooting its own
deserters.
While the military situation has
become more precarious in
Southeast Asia, Nixon still relies
in the end on the Saigon army.
Recent setbacks do not imply its
imminent demise. But assessment
of the present crisis is severely
impeded by another of the altered
circumstances: As part of
Vietnamization, the Saigon
information service has recently
been transferred to the hands of
Thieu's government.
While the old American
military information service was
less than ideal, it at least had the
virtues of consistency and a
familiar work style. The
contradictory reports, the
ommissions and the flagrant
exaggerations which have become
a standard fare since the change
make all war news of the past
three months highly suspect.
