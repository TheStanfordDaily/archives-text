# Packard Plans To Stay Out Of Campus Affairs
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT FRANK MILLER 
David Packard has returned to Palo Alto but not to an
active role in Stanford affairs.
The multimillionaire electronics executive feels that he
"spent enough time" in 15 years as a Stanford trustee.
He resigned from the Board when he began his three
year term as Deputy Secretary of Defense.
Although insisting he is still interested in his alma

mater, Packard said Tuesday, "I'm not going to get
involved closely with Stanford again."
Sources on campus confirmed that Packard was invited
to return to the Board of Trustees when he left the
Defense Department in December. Packard would say
only that he "was not formally asked" and would refuse
such an invitation, although he recently accepted a
position on the Hoover Institute's Board of Overseers.
Nixon Campaign
During a Daily interview at his office in Stanford
Industrial Park, Packard explained he is staying busy as
Chairman of the Board of Hewlett-Packard Company and
as chairman of President Nixon's re-election campaign in
the Bay Area.
He does not plan to spend time working on Stanford's
upcoming fund-raising drive. However, Packard who
reportedly earns up to $1 million annually, said, "I expect
they will ask me for money."
But he also hinted that Stanford may receive less of his
wealth in the years ahead. Packard said his future gifts will
be directed to specific projects from which he can "see
particular benefits."

He also indicated a growing interest in helping "small
liberal arts colleges." That interest was shown in the
division last month of $23 million which accumulated in a
trust fund while Packard worked in the Pentagon. Packard
gave Stanford $2.6 million, but small Colorado College
received a heftier $7.5 million.
Packard added that he takes a special interest in
Colorado College because he grew up in Colorado and
both of his parents graduated from the school.
Although Packard may be devoting less energy to
Stanford, ne is pleased with recent events on campus.
Packard said that "militant action is settling down now. I
think the campus will continue to remain peaceful."
Packard seldom misses an opportunity to lambast
campus revolutionaries, who denounce him as a "war
criminal" for his Defense Department work and his

company's production of electronic weapons equipment.
Purveyors of Evil
Protesters were marching in the street last month when
Packard addressed the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce
and congratulated Stanford for exposing "the purveyors
of evil ideas."
He confirmed he was referring "to the general |H.
Bruce] Franklin situation out there. I think it was very
encouraging that the faculty committee was willing to
make a recommendation, to decide it was not very
beneficial to allow that kind of thing to go on."
Packard said he warned the Chamber of Commerce
audience that "some of these purveyors of evil ideas have
moved into your high schools" because he heard that
Franklin and other radicals had been speaking in the
schools.
The radicals went to the high schools to "try and drum
up a lot of activity and get out and throw stones at
somebody," Packard charged.
Deadly Enemies
In a speech last year which was moved from Palo Alto
to San Francisco because of demonstrations, Packard
warned electronics executives that "the Davis Harrises, the
Jane Fondas and all those that support them are your
deadly enemies."
He explained, "What I had in mind was that this
country was based on a democratic approach. Some of
these people are advocating a revolutionary approach. I
think the rise of militism in the domestic society is
adverse to our democratic tradition."
Packard said civilian influence on the military was
weakened when activists succeeded in eliminating ROTC
military training from major campuses, including
Stanford. Packard added that he and Defense Secretary
Melvin Laird tried to work out new ROTC programs
which the universities will accept "in the long run."
ROTC Returned
He said that Laird "is very sensitive to the ROTC
program," and Packard expressed his own hope that

ROTC will eventually be returned to Stanford.
Packard views major universities as "national assets"
which "contribute to the progress or lack of it in our
society. This imposes a responsibility to recognize this."
He said that only small liberal arts schools are free "to
go off to the hills" and follow the traditional academic
view of "a haven for scholars . . . without obligation to
pursue any specific problem in any specific way." But he

added that, despite dependence on
government research funding,
"universities have to have some
independence" from government.
Wealth And Power
Asked if his opinions on campus
issues might be given special weight by
administrators because of his wealth
and power, Packard said, "I doubt
very much that any Stanford policies
were modified because they thought
they might please me."
He said he hopes his opinions are
considered, "but not because of my
wealth, if that's the reason they listen
to me, I'd just as soon not waste my
time talking to them."
Packard conceded he is "a little
concerned" that some of the many
awards and honors he has received
over the years have been presented
"because the people have in mind that
I may be helpful to them."
Although he may be conservative in
his opposition to radicals, Packard said
he has "tried to do some things that
are progressive" and could not say if
he is a liberal or conservative overall.

He recalled that he was sharply
criticized by other businessmen in the
1940'5, when he "was one of the first
people to advocate that business has a
responsibility beyond the
stockholders—to the community at
large and the employees."
Packard said he is active now in the
Nixon campaign because "I worked
very closely with the President during
these three years on some very
difficult issues. I've come to respect
him after seeing how carefully he's
trying to consider the issues, to
question the options."
He described Nixon as "intense and
sincere" but said that "somehow he
doesn't have a warmth that gets over"
to the public.
'Vietnamization' Program
Speaking of his years in the
Pentagon, Packard described the
"Vietnamization" program as part of
Nixon's effort to "tailor our
commitments more in line with our
national resources" and to "eliminate
the points of friction between
ourselves and the Communists."
But he said that air power and
other "logistics support" of the South
Vietnamese must continue for the
present because the U.S. is "a very
important stabilizing influence there.
We cannot eliminate our presence
from Asia and other parts of the world
in the short-term future."
Hack from a leadership position in
the Pentagon, Packard was asked if he
ever seriously considers the charges
that national leaders are guilty of war
crimes. He answered, "No I don't
think so. We did a good many things
|in the Nixon administration] to
change the situation in Vietnam."

Number 2 position in December, does not plan to "get
involved closely with Stanford again."


CAMPUSES QUlET—David Packard, Bay Area chairman
of the Nixon campaign, predicted the campuses will
"continue to remain peaceful" in the months ahead.
added that, despite dependence on
government research funding,
"universities have to have some
independence" from government.
Wealth And Power
Asked if his opinions on campus
issues might be given special weight by
administrators because of his wealth
and power, Packard said, "I doubt
very much that any Stanford policies
were modified because they thought
they might please me."
He said he hopes his opinions are
considered, "but not because of my
wealth, if that's the reason they listen
to me, I'd just as soon not waste my
time talking to them."
Packard conceded he is "a little
concerned" that some of the many
awards and honors he has received
over the years have been presented
"because the people have in mind that
I may be helpful to them."
Although he may be conservative in
his opposition to radicals, Packard said
he has "tried to do some things that
are progressive" and could not say if
he is a liberal or conservative overall.

He recalled that he was sharply
criticized by other businessmen in the
1940'5, when he "was one of the first
people to advocate that business has a
responsibility beyond the
stockholders—to the community at
large and the employees."
Packard said he is active now in the
Nixon campaign because "I worked
very closely with the President during
these three years on some very
difficult issues. I've come to respect
him after seeing how carefully he's
trying to consider the issues, to
question the options."
He described Nixon as "intense and
sincere" but said that "somehow he
doesn't have a warmth that gets over"
to the public.
'Vietnamization' Program
Speaking of his years in the
Pentagon, Packard described the
"Vietnamization" program as part of
Nixon's effort to "tailor our
commitments more in line with our
national resources" and to "eliminate
the points of friction between
ourselves and the Communists."
But he said that air power and
other "logistics support" of the South
Vietnamese must continue for the
present because the U.S. is "a very
important stabilizing influence there.
We cannot eliminate our presence
from Asia and other parts of the world
in the short-term future."
Hack from a leadership position in
the Pentagon, Packard was asked if he
ever seriously considers the charges
that national leaders are guilty of war
crimes. He answered, "No I don't
think so. We did a good many things
|in the Nixon administration] to
change the situation in Vietnam."
David Packard has returned to Palo Alto but not to an
active role in Stanford affairs.
The multimillionaire electronics executive feels that he
"spent enough time" in 15 years as a Stanford trustee.
He resigned from the Board when he began his three
year term as Deputy Secretary of Defense.
Although insisting he is still interested in his alma

mater, Packard said Tuesday, "I'm not going to get
involved closely with Stanford again."
Sources on campus confirmed that Packard was invited
to return to the Board of Trustees when he left the
Defense Department in December. Packard would say
only that he "was not formally asked" and would refuse
such an invitation, although he recently accepted a
position on the Hoover Institute's Board of Overseers.
Nixon Campaign
During a Daily interview at his office in Stanford
Industrial Park, Packard explained he is staying busy as
Chairman of the Board of Hewlett-Packard Company and
as chairman of President Nixon's re-election campaign in
the Bay Area.
He does not plan to spend time working on Stanford's
upcoming fund-raising drive. However, Packard who
reportedly earns up to $1 million annually, said, "I expect
they will ask me for money."
But he also hinted that Stanford may receive less of his
wealth in the years ahead. Packard said his future gifts will
be directed to specific projects from which he can "see
particular benefits."
Packard Gifts
He also indicated a growing interest in helping "small
liberal arts colleges." That interest was shown in the
division last month of $23 million which accumulated in a
trust fund while Packard worked in the Pentagon. Packard
gave Stanford $2.6 million, but small Colorado College
received a heftier $7.5 million.
Packard added that he takes a special interest in
Colorado College because he grew up in Colorado and
both of his parents graduated from the school.
Although Packard may be devoting less energy to
Stanford, ne is pleased with recent events on campus.
Packard said that "militant action is settling down now. I
think the campus will continue to remain peaceful."
Packard seldom misses an opportunity to lambast
campus revolutionaries, who denounce him as a "war
criminal" for his Defense Department work and his

company's production of electronic weapons equipment.
Purveyors of Evil
Protesters were marching in the street last month when
Packard addressed the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce
and congratulated Stanford for exposing "the purveyors
of evil ideas."
He confirmed he was referring "to the general |H.
Bruce] Franklin situation out there. I think it was very
encouraging that the faculty committee was willing to
make a recommendation, to decide it was not very
beneficial to allow that kind of thing to go on."
Packard said he warned the Chamber of Commerce
audience that "some of these purveyors of evil ideas have
moved into your high schools" because he heard that
Franklin and other radicals had been speaking in the
schools.
The radicals went to the high schools to "try and drum
up a lot of activity and get out and throw stones at
somebody," Packard charged.
Deadly Enemies
In a speech last year which was moved from Palo Alto
to San Francisco because of demonstrations, Packard
warned electronics executives that "the Davis Harrises, the
Jane Fondas and all those that support them are your
deadly enemies."
He explained, "What I had in mind was that this
country was based on a democratic approach. Some of
these people are advocating a revolutionary approach. I
think the rise of militism in the domestic society is
adverse to our democratic tradition."
Packard said civilian influence on the military was
weakened when activists succeeded in eliminating ROTC
military training from major campuses, including
Stanford. Packard added that he and Defense Secretary
Melvin Laird tried to work out new ROTC programs
which the universities will accept "in the long run."
ROTC Returned
He said that Laird "is very sensitive to the ROTC
program," and Packard expressed his own hope that

ROTC will eventually be returned to Stanford.
Packard views major universities as "national assets"
which "contribute to the progress or lack of it in our
society. This imposes a responsibility to recognize this."
He said that only small liberal arts schools are free "to
go off to the hills" and follow the traditional academic
view of "a haven for scholars . . . without obligation to
pursue any specific problem in any specific way." But he

trust fund while Packard worked in the Pentagon. Packard
gave Stanford $2.6 million, but small Colorado College
received a heftier $7.5 million.
Packard added that he takes a special interest in
Colorado College because he grew up in Colorado and
both of his parents graduated from the school.
Although Packard may be devoting less energy to
Stanford, ne is pleased with recent events on campus.
Packard said that "militant action is settling down now. I
think the campus will continue to remain peaceful."
Packard seldom misses an opportunity to lambast
campus revolutionaries, who denounce him as a "war
criminal" for his Defense Department work and his

company's production of electronic weapons equipment.
Purveyors of Evil
Protesters were marching in the street last month when
Packard addressed the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce
and congratulated Stanford for exposing "the purveyors
of evil ideas."
He confirmed he was referring "to the general |H.
Bruce] Franklin situation out there. I think it was very
encouraging that the faculty committee was willing to
make a recommendation, to decide it was not very
beneficial to allow that kind of thing to go on."
Packard said he warned the Chamber of Commerce
audience that "some of these purveyors of evil ideas have
moved into your high schools" because he heard that
Franklin and other radicals had been speaking in the
schools.
The radicals went to the high schools to "try and drum
up a lot of activity and get out and throw stones at
somebody," Packard charged.
Deadly Enemies
In a speech last year which was moved from Palo Alto
to San Francisco because of demonstrations, Packard
warned electronics executives that "the Davis Harrises, the
Jane Fondas and all those that support them are your
deadly enemies."
He explained, "What I had in mind was that this
country was based on a democratic approach. Some of
these people are advocating a revolutionary approach. I
think the rise of militism in the domestic society is
adverse to our democratic tradition."
Packard said civilian influence on the military was
weakened when activists succeeded in eliminating ROTC
military training from major campuses, including
Stanford. Packard added that he and Defense Secretary
Melvin Laird tried to work out new ROTC programs
which the universities will accept "in the long run."
ROTC Returned
He said that Laird "is very sensitive to the ROTC
program," and Packard expressed his own hope that

ROTC will eventually be returned to Stanford.
Packard views major universities as "national assets"
which "contribute to the progress or lack of it in our
society. This imposes a responsibility to recognize this."
He said that only small liberal arts schools are free "to
go off to the hills" and follow the traditional academic
view of "a haven for scholars . . . without obligation to
pursue any specific problem in any specific way." But he

of the Nixon campaign, predicted the campuses will
"continue to remain peaceful" in the months ahead.
added that, despite dependence on
government research funding,
"universities have to have some
independence" from government.
Wealth And Power
Asked if his opinions on campus
issues might be given special weight by
administrators because of his wealth
and power, Packard said, "I doubt
very much that any Stanford policies
were modified because they thought
they might please me."
He said he hopes his opinions are
considered, "but not because of my
wealth, if that's the reason they listen
to me, I'd just as soon not waste my
time talking to them."
Packard conceded he is "a little
concerned" that some of the many
awards and honors he has received
over the years have been presented
"because the people have in mind that
I may be helpful to them."
Although he may be conservative in
his opposition to radicals, Packard said
he has "tried to do some things that
are progressive" and could not say if
he is a liberal or conservative overall.

He recalled that he was sharply
criticized by other businessmen in the
1940'5, when he "was one of the first
people to advocate that business has a
responsibility beyond the
stockholders—to the community at
large and the employees."
Packard said he is active now in the
Nixon campaign because "I worked
very closely with the President during
these three years on some very
difficult issues. I've come to respect
him after seeing how carefully he's
trying to consider the issues, to
question the options."
He described Nixon as "intense and
sincere" but said that "somehow he
doesn't have a warmth that gets over"
to the public.
'Vietnamization' Program
Speaking of his years in the
Pentagon, Packard described the
"Vietnamization" program as part of
Nixon's effort to "tailor our
commitments more in line with our
national resources" and to "eliminate
the points of friction between
ourselves and the Communists."
But he said that air power and
other "logistics support" of the South
Vietnamese must continue for the
present because the U.S. is "a very
important stabilizing influence there.
We cannot eliminate our presence
from Asia and other parts of the world
in the short-term future."
Hack from a leadership position in
the Pentagon, Packard was asked if he
ever seriously considers the charges
that national leaders are guilty of war
crimes. He answered, "No I don't
think so. We did a good many things
|in the Nixon administration] to
change the situation in Vietnam."
David Packard has returned to Palo Alto but not to an
active role in Stanford affairs.
The multimillionaire electronics executive feels that he
"spent enough time" in 15 years as a Stanford trustee.
He resigned from the Board when he began his three
year term as Deputy Secretary of Defense.
Although insisting he is still interested in his alma

mater, Packard said Tuesday, "I'm not going to get
involved closely with Stanford again."
Sources on campus confirmed that Packard was invited
to return to the Board of Trustees when he left the
Defense Department in December. Packard would say
only that he "was not formally asked" and would refuse
such an invitation, although he recently accepted a
position on the Hoover Institute's Board of Overseers.
Nixon Campaign
During a Daily interview at his office in Stanford
Industrial Park, Packard explained he is staying busy as
Chairman of the Board of Hewlett-Packard Company and
as chairman of President Nixon's re-election campaign in
the Bay Area.
He does not plan to spend time working on Stanford's
upcoming fund-raising drive. However, Packard who
reportedly earns up to $1 million annually, said, "I expect
they will ask me for money."
But he also hinted that Stanford may receive less of his
wealth in the years ahead. Packard said his future gifts will
be directed to specific projects from which he can "see
particular benefits."
Packard Gifts
He also indicated a growing interest in helping "small
liberal arts colleges." That interest was shown in the
division last month of $23 million which accumulated in a
trust fund while Packard worked in the Pentagon. Packard
gave Stanford $2.6 million, but small Colorado College
received a heftier $7.5 million.
