# Lyman Awarded Grant
## 
### 
President Richard Lyman is
one of 20 college presidents and
chancellors awarded short-term
leave grants for 1972-73 by the
Danforth Foundation announced
in St. Louis yesterday.
The foundation provides up to
$5,000 in expenses for recipients
and their spouses to take from
two to four months leave. The
Lymans have made no firm plans
on when to take the leave.
Now in its fifth year, the
Danforth program is designed to
allow college administrators "to

enlarge their perspectives of
current and future educational
issues, and to reinforce the
administrator's leadership
capabilities in higher education,"
according to William C. Nelson,
program director.
Preference is given individuals
who have served at least five years
in their present position, or in a
similar position, but who are not
within five years of retirement.
Lyman served as provost from
1967 until his selection as
president in 1970.
Created by the late Mr. and
Mrs. William H. Danforth in 1927,
the foundation now focuses its
activities in two major areas,
education and the city.
