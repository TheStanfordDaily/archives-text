# Ike & Tina Do It Again
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Over the past few years, as
rock music has become more and
more accepted as a valid part of
American culture, numerous
medical reports have appeared
which warn of the possible ear
damage which can be sustained by
long-term exposure to highly
amplified music. Anyone who has
stood directly in front of a sound
system while one of rock's louder
bands was playing would probably
agree that such a danger definitely
exists. •
The ear damage problem is
very plausible, but what often
amazes me about rock musicians
is how some of them can sing for
years and years in a very
high-powered fashion without
ruining their voices. When you
consider that someone like Tina
Turner has been singing for almost
20 years, it's kind of amazing that
she can still belt out songs with
the same incredible vocal power
night after night.
In her appearance last weekend

at the Circle Star Theater Tina
showed no traces of aging and I
kind of think she'll be greatly
exciting audiences with her
electrifying singing, dancing and
general stage presence for many
years to come.
I was so blown out by the Ike
and Tina Turner Revue when I
first saw them a year ago that
seeing them again had to be a
little less exciting due to the
missing surprise factor. But taking
this into consideration along with
the fact that I saw them
performing the second of two
shows on Saturday night, I must
say that I still definitely feel that
the Ike and Tina Turner Revue is
undoubtedly one of the most
incredible live entertainment acts
around.
Good Vibes
The strength of their show is
beautifully demonstrated when
without Ike, Tina or the Ikettes
on stage, the revue's band, the
Family Vibes, by themselves play
some of the best music I've heard

in a long while. The Family Vibes
consists of two saxophone
players, two trumpeters, a
trombonist, two guitarists, a
keyboard man and a drummer.
And they opened the revue with
the finest version of Isaac Hayes'
Grammy Award winning "Theme
From Shaft," 1 have ever heard.
The lead guitar work on their
version is truly memorable.
Next they got into a rendition
of Chicago's "25 or 6 to 4,"
which sounded much better than
the version Chicago played in
their Maples Pavilion performance
last year. Then one of the
trumpeters sang A 1 Green's "Let's
Stay Together" and he sounded so
much like the distinctly moaning
Mr. Green that I thought it might
be him in disguise. The Vibes
capped off this remarkable
opening portion of the show with
a very happy, horn-dominated
Sly-type number.
The Vibes were sounding so
good that I could've listened to
them by themselves for quite a
while. But the show had to go on
and here come Ike and the
Ikettes. The Ikettes are three
women who are some of the best
dancers I have ever seen, but who,
before Tina appears, demonstrate
that they can also sing. With Ike
showing his fine technique as a
very soulful lead guitarist, the
Ikettes go to work.
Their first number was a classic
version of "Heaven Make You
Happy." The Ikettes' dancing
prowess is well known but what is
so pleasant about their singing is
that it is very good and is a very
refreshing change from the usual
echo tradition of most vocal
choruses.
Things Start Cooking
They continued to demonstrate
their individual singing talents on
"So Fine," "Piece of My Heart"
and "Shake It, Shake It Baby."
And by this time, the crowd is
warmed up and very ready for the
appearance of the show's start.
After being announced as "the
hardest working young lady in
show business today," a beautiful
black woman runs on stage and
things really begin to cook.
Tina started out a bit slow on a

few numbers like "With A Little
Help From My Friends," but she
really got going on a great duet
with Ike, "It's Gonna Work Out
Fine." The combination of Ike's
deep-deep-deep bass and Tina's
raw and earthy voice make for
one of music's best mixed duets.
Ike and Tina's recorded
material clearly shows that Tina
has a very powerful and very
funky voice, but you have to see
her to appreciate her amazing
dancing and stage presence. Tina
really demonstrated some fine
"stepping" early in the show on
the Beatles' "Get Back."
Then Tina got into two of her
classics, "River Deep, Mountain
High," and "Honky-Tonk
Woman." The first song features
some great guitar work by Ike and
the second, well the second as far
as I'm concerned is Tina's song.
Tina might very well be the
original "honky-tonk woman."
She completed a fine sequence
with "Proud Mary," on which Ike
showed that he must have one of
the deepest voices in the world.
Then Tina sang her legendary
mike-as-sex-organ number, "I've
Been Loving You Too Long." Ike
and Tina make this into the
ultimate sexual song, and it has to
be seen to be appreciated. The
hour and a half of very, very good
entertainment was climaxed bv
Sly's "I Want To Take You
Higher."
Saturday night's show may not
have knocked me out as much as
the first Ike and Tina show I saw a
year ago. But I can still say that
the Ike and Tina Turner Revue is
one of the greatest live shows in
the entertainment field.
Ike and Tina are tentatively
scheduled to return to the Bay
Area in early June for a two-night
jazz show at the Oakland
Coliseum which is supposed to
include Ray Charles, 8.8. King,
Thelonius Monk, Miles Davis,
Nina Simone and Donny
Hathaway among others. If you're
going to be around in early June,
don't miss it. To paraphrase the
title of one of Ike and Tina's
albums, "what you see is what
you get" and Ike and Tina Turner
have to be seen to be believed.

HONKY-TONK WOMEN—Tina Turner and the Ikettes are seen above
in a performance last weekend at the Circle Star Theater in San
Carlos. The Ike and Tina Turner Revue is expected to return to the
Bay Area in early June for a jazz festival at the Oakland Coliseum
which is supposed to also include Ray Charles, 8.8. King, Miles Davis,
Donny Hathaway and Nina Simone.
Over the past few years, as
rock music has become more and
more accepted as a valid part of
American culture, numerous
medical reports have appeared
which warn of the possible ear
damage which can be sustained by
long-term exposure to highly
amplified music. Anyone who has
stood directly in front of a sound
system while one of rock's louder
bands was playing would probably
agree that such a danger definitely
exists. •
The ear damage problem is
very plausible, but what often
amazes me about rock musicians
is how some of them can sing for
years and years in a very
high-powered fashion without
ruining their voices. When you
consider that someone like Tina
Turner has been singing for almost
20 years, it's kind of amazing that
she can still belt out songs with
the same incredible vocal power
night after night.
In her appearance last weekend

at the Circle Star Theater Tina
showed no traces of aging and I
kind of think she'll be greatly
exciting audiences with her
electrifying singing, dancing and
general stage presence for many
years to come.
I was so blown out by the Ike
and Tina Turner Revue when I
first saw them a year ago that
seeing them again had to be a
little less exciting due to the
missing surprise factor. But taking
this into consideration along with
the fact that I saw them
performing the second of two
shows on Saturday night, I must
say that I still definitely feel that
the Ike and Tina Turner Revue is
undoubtedly one of the most
incredible live entertainment acts
around.
Good Vibes
The strength of their show is
beautifully demonstrated when
without Ike, Tina or the Ikettes
on stage, the revue's band, the
Family Vibes, by themselves play
some of the best music I've heard

in a long while. The Family Vibes
consists of two saxophone
players, two trumpeters, a
trombonist, two guitarists, a
keyboard man and a drummer.
And they opened the revue with
the finest version of Isaac Hayes'
Grammy Award winning "Theme
From Shaft," 1 have ever heard.
The lead guitar work on their
version is truly memorable.
Next they got into a rendition
of Chicago's "25 or 6 to 4,"
which sounded much better than
the version Chicago played in
their Maples Pavilion performance
last year. Then one of the
trumpeters sang A 1 Green's "Let's
Stay Together" and he sounded so
much like the distinctly moaning
Mr. Green that I thought it might
be him in disguise. The Vibes
capped off this remarkable
opening portion of the show with
a very happy, horn-dominated
Sly-type number.
The Vibes were sounding so
good that I could've listened to
them by themselves for quite a
while. But the show had to go on
and here come Ike and the
Ikettes. The Ikettes are three
women who are some of the best
dancers I have ever seen, but who,
before Tina appears, demonstrate
that they can also sing. With Ike
showing his fine technique as a
very soulful lead guitarist, the
Ikettes go to work.
Their first number was a classic
version of "Heaven Make You
Happy." The Ikettes' dancing
prowess is well known but what is
so pleasant about their singing is
that it is very good and is a very
refreshing change from the usual
echo tradition of most vocal
choruses.
Things Start Cooking
They continued to demonstrate
their individual singing talents on
"So Fine," "Piece of My Heart"
and "Shake It, Shake It Baby."
And by this time, the crowd is
warmed up and very ready for the
appearance of the show's start.
After being announced as "the
hardest working young lady in
show business today," a beautiful
black woman runs on stage and
things really begin to cook.
Tina started out a bit slow on a

few numbers like "With A Little
Help From My Friends," but she
really got going on a great duet
with Ike, "It's Gonna Work Out
Fine." The combination of Ike's
deep-deep-deep bass and Tina's
raw and earthy voice make for
one of music's best mixed duets.
Ike and Tina's recorded
material clearly shows that Tina
has a very powerful and very
funky voice, but you have to see
her to appreciate her amazing
dancing and stage presence. Tina
really demonstrated some fine
"stepping" early in the show on
the Beatles' "Get Back."
Then Tina got into two of her
classics, "River Deep, Mountain
High," and "Honky-Tonk
Woman." The first song features
some great guitar work by Ike and
the second, well the second as far
as I'm concerned is Tina's song.
Tina might very well be the
original "honky-tonk woman."
She completed a fine sequence
with "Proud Mary," on which Ike
showed that he must have one of
the deepest voices in the world.
Then Tina sang her legendary
mike-as-sex-organ number, "I've
Been Loving You Too Long." Ike
and Tina make this into the
ultimate sexual song, and it has to
be seen to be appreciated. The
hour and a half of very, very good
entertainment was climaxed bv
Sly's "I Want To Take You
Higher."
Saturday night's show may not
have knocked me out as much as
the first Ike and Tina show I saw a
year ago. But I can still say that
the Ike and Tina Turner Revue is
one of the greatest live shows in
the entertainment field.
Ike and Tina are tentatively
scheduled to return to the Bay
Area in early June for a two-night
jazz show at the Oakland
Coliseum which is supposed to
include Ray Charles, 8.8. King,
Thelonius Monk, Miles Davis,
Nina Simone and Donny

hour and a half of very, very good
entertainment was climaxed bv
Sly's "I Want To Take You
Higher."
Saturday night's show may not
have knocked me out as much as
the first Ike and Tina show I saw a
year ago. But I can still say that
the Ike and Tina Turner Revue is
one of the greatest live shows in
the entertainment field.
Ike and Tina are tentatively
scheduled to return to the Bay
Area in early June for a two-night
jazz show at the Oakland
Coliseum which is supposed to
include Ray Charles, 8.8. King,
Thelonius Monk, Miles Davis,
Nina Simone and Donny
Hathaway among others. If you're
going to be around in early June,
don't miss it. To paraphrase the
title of one of Ike and Tina's
albums, "what you see is what
you get" and Ike and Tina Turner
have to be seen to be believed.

HONKY-TONK WOMEN—Tina Turner and the Ikettes are seen above
in a performance last weekend at the Circle Star Theater in San
Carlos. The Ike and Tina Turner Revue is expected to return to the
Bay Area in early June for a jazz festival at the Oakland Coliseum
which is supposed to also include Ray Charles, 8.8. King, Miles Davis,
Donny Hathaway and Nina Simone.
Over the past few years, as
rock music has become more and
more accepted as a valid part of
American culture, numerous
medical reports have appeared
which warn of the possible ear
damage which can be sustained by
long-term exposure to highly
amplified music. Anyone who has
stood directly in front of a sound
system while one of rock's louder
bands was playing would probably
agree that such a danger definitely
exists. •
The ear damage problem is
very plausible, but what often
amazes me about rock musicians
is how some of them can sing for
years and years in a very
high-powered fashion without
ruining their voices. When you
consider that someone like Tina
Turner has been singing for almost
20 years, it's kind of amazing that
she can still belt out songs with
the same incredible vocal power
night after night.
In her appearance last weekend

at the Circle Star Theater Tina
showed no traces of aging and I
kind of think she'll be greatly
exciting audiences with her
electrifying singing, dancing and
general stage presence for many
years to come.
I was so blown out by the Ike
and Tina Turner Revue when I
first saw them a year ago that
seeing them again had to be a
little less exciting due to the
missing surprise factor. But taking
this into consideration along with
the fact that I saw them
performing the second of two
shows on Saturday night, I must
say that I still definitely feel that
the Ike and Tina Turner Revue is
undoubtedly one of the most
incredible live entertainment acts
around.
Good Vibes
The strength of their show is
beautifully demonstrated when
without Ike, Tina or the Ikettes
on stage, the revue's band, the
Family Vibes, by themselves play
some of the best music I've heard

in a long while. The Family Vibes
consists of two saxophone
players, two trumpeters, a
trombonist, two guitarists, a
keyboard man and a drummer.
And they opened the revue with
the finest version of Isaac Hayes'
Grammy Award winning "Theme
From Shaft," 1 have ever heard.
The lead guitar work on their
version is truly memorable.
Next they got into a rendition
of Chicago's "25 or 6 to 4,"
which sounded much better than
the version Chicago played in
their Maples Pavilion performance
last year. Then one of the
trumpeters sang A 1 Green's "Let's
Stay Together" and he sounded so
much like the distinctly moaning
Mr. Green that I thought it might
be him in disguise. The Vibes
capped off this remarkable
opening portion of the show with
a very happy, horn-dominated
Sly-type number.
The Vibes were sounding so
good that I could've listened to
them by themselves for quite a
while. But the show had to go on
and here come Ike and the
Ikettes. The Ikettes are three
women who are some of the best
dancers I have ever seen, but who,
before Tina appears, demonstrate
that they can also sing. With Ike
showing his fine technique as a
very soulful lead guitarist, the
Ikettes go to work.
Their first number was a classic
version of "Heaven Make You
Happy." The Ikettes' dancing
prowess is well known but what is
so pleasant about their singing is
that it is very good and is a very
refreshing change from the usual
echo tradition of most vocal
choruses.
Things Start Cooking
They continued to demonstrate
their individual singing talents on
"So Fine," "Piece of My Heart"
and "Shake It, Shake It Baby."
And by this time, the crowd is
warmed up and very ready for the
appearance of the show's start.
After being announced as "the
hardest working young lady in
show business today," a beautiful
black woman runs on stage and
things really begin to cook.
Tina started out a bit slow on a

few numbers like "With A Little
Help From My Friends," but she
really got going on a great duet
with Ike, "It's Gonna Work Out
Fine." The combination of Ike's
deep-deep-deep bass and Tina's
raw and earthy voice make for
one of music's best mixed duets.
Ike and Tina's recorded
material clearly shows that Tina
has a very powerful and very
funky voice, but you have to see
her to appreciate her amazing
dancing and stage presence. Tina
really demonstrated some fine
"stepping" early in the show on
the Beatles' "Get Back."
Then Tina got into two of her
classics, "River Deep, Mountain
High," and "Honky-Tonk
Woman." The first song features
some great guitar work by Ike and
the second, well the second as far
as I'm concerned is Tina's song.
Tina might very well be the
original "honky-tonk woman."
She completed a fine sequence
with "Proud Mary," on which Ike
showed that he must have one of
the deepest voices in the world.
Then Tina sang her legendary
mike-as-sex-organ number, "I've
Been Loving You Too Long." Ike
and Tina make this into the
ultimate sexual song, and it has to
be seen to be appreciated. The
hour and a half of very, very good
entertainment was climaxed bv
Sly's "I Want To Take You
Higher."
Saturday night's show may not
have knocked me out as much as
