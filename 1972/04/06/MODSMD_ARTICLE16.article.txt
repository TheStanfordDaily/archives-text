The Massage Book
by George Downing
Random House—The Bookworks
$3.95
Another book has come along
as useful as the volume on how to
keep a Volkswagen alive. The
Massage Book delves into the
meaning and purpose of massage
while presenting a lucid and
practical account of how to give a
full body massage. Printed in large
pages in large type so it can be
referred to during a massage, The
Massage Hook, like a Kodak
camera, is the gift that keeps on
giving.
George Downing, the author,
leads workshops and classes for
Esalen and other growth centers
in massage and body awareness.
He wrote the book to fill the need
for a good book on massage to
recommend to students in his
classes. His style is informal,
loose, and almost conversational,
making the transition from the
printed page to the nonverbal
communication of massage an
easy one for the reader.
After basic sections on oils and
powders, massage tables, and
preparing for a massage, Downing
launches into a region by region
description of how to massage.
Strokes for each part of the body
are carefully described and where
possible illustrated, and Downing
adds commentary on refinements
in technique which lend flourish
to a massage.
Beyond Technique
Several sections are devoted to

aspects of massage that go beyond
technique including nervousness,
body tension, discomfort, the
tickles, and massaging to music
(which incidentally the author
doesn't recommend since he feels
it interferes with the massage.).
While the full body massage
described in the book takes about
an hour and one half, Downing
includes a section on how to give
a ten minute massage by
concentrating only on certain
strokes.
Although he sees massage as a
healing art and not an advanced
sexual technique, Downing
authored a section on "Massage
for Lovers," which he begins with
the comment "Bet you turned to
this chapter right away, huh?"
The last chapters of the book
deal with other forms of massage.
The Chinese art of moving
meditation Tai Chi Chuan, zone
therapy, Reichian Massage,
Rolfing (a method of deep
massage), and even Acupuncture
are discussed. Most of these areas
are mentioned in passing, but
Downing provides references that
the interested reader can pursue.
Fullness Never Matched
In the chapter "Why Massage,"
Downing states that "the core of
massage lies in its unique way of
communicating without words.
Trust, empathy, and respect, to
say nothing of a sheer sense of
mutual physical existence, can be
expressed with a fullness never
matched by words."
Anyone whose back has been
rubbed after a hard night sitting
and studying knows how tension
reducing even a short massage can
be. The Massage Booh gives the
background one needs in order to
convert an ordinary backrub into
a very unique experience.
Those who can deliver a good
massage can take a very special
pride in craft, a joy in working
with the hands that students
rarely have an opportunity to find
during their academic years. In
terms of a long lasting skill, The
Massage Booh could prove the
l.iost valuable volume on your
bookshelf.

Esalen and other growth centers
in massage and body awareness.
He wrote the book to fill the need
for a good book on massage to
recommend to students in his
classes. His style is informal,
loose, and almost conversational,
making the transition from the
printed page to the nonverbal
communication of massage an
easy one for the reader.
After basic sections on oils and
powders, massage tables, and
preparing for a massage, Downing
launches into a region by region
description of how to massage.
Strokes for each part of the body
are carefully described and where
possible illustrated, and Downing
adds commentary on refinements
in technique which lend flourish
to a massage.
Beyond Technique
Several sections are devoted to

aspects of massage that go beyond
technique including nervousness,
body tension, discomfort, the
tickles, and massaging to music
(which incidentally the author
doesn't recommend since he feels
it interferes with the massage.).
While the full body massage
described in the book takes about
an hour and one half, Downing
includes a section on how to give
a ten minute massage by
concentrating only on certain
strokes.
Although he sees massage as a
healing art and not an advanced
sexual technique, Downing
authored a section on "Massage
for Lovers," which he begins with
the comment "Bet you turned to
this chapter right away, huh?"
The last chapters of the book
deal with other forms of massage.
The Chinese art of moving
meditation Tai Chi Chuan, zone
therapy, Reichian Massage,
Rolfing (a method of deep
massage), and even Acupuncture
are discussed. Most of these areas
are mentioned in passing, but
Downing provides references that
the interested reader can pursue.
Fullness Never Matched
In the chapter "Why Massage,"
Downing states that "the core of
massage lies in its unique way of
communicating without words.
Trust, empathy, and respect, to
say nothing of a sheer sense of
mutual physical existence, can be
expressed with a fullness never
matched by words."
Anyone whose back has been
rubbed after a hard night sitting
and studying knows how tension
reducing even a short massage can
be. The Massage Booh gives the
background one needs in order to
convert an ordinary backrub into
a very unique experience.
Those who can deliver a good
massage can take a very special
pride in craft, a joy in working
with the hands that students
rarely have an opportunity to find
during their academic years. In
terms of a long lasting skill, The
Massage Booh could prove the
l.iost valuable volume on your
bookshelf.

Another book has come along
as useful as the volume on how to
keep a Volkswagen alive. The
Massage Book delves into the
meaning and purpose of massage
while presenting a lucid and
practical account of how to give a
full body massage. Printed in large
pages in large type so it can be
referred to during a massage, The
Massage Hook, like a Kodak
camera, is the gift that keeps on
giving.
