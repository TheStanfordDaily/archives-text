# Plastic Panic Hits Berkeley
## 
### DOUG ARTHUR 
Berkeley audiences will
applaud anything. I came to that
conclusion after sitting through
Nick Kazan's Plastic Panic at the
Magic Theatre. Not that it
mattered much: the director had
judiciously taped applause in case
the audience didn't come through
and the actor credits were on film
so they didn't have to take a bow.
The play itself is a mixture of:
watered down 19M4, satire on
Middle America, a skin Hick (not
even enticing as skin flicks go) and
an attack on the church and
government. I thought of some
crucial questions while watching
this play. What will happen to the
family? Will the war still be going
on in the distant future? Whatever
possessed them to do this play?
What am I doing here?
The best parts of the play were
the filmed sections that were
projected on the huge TV screen
that dominates the set and which
the family continually watches.
All aspects of the family's life are
controlled by the TV set, and its
announcer relates all important
personal news to them, such as
the death of their son in Asia,
which they witness on TV. The
beginning film parodied a
"serious" TV drama.
We see the budding romance of
a man in a tuxedo and an
attractive woman in a white gown.
They are sitting by a lake on the
grass, he impulsively kisses her;
she decides it's over and wants to
kill herself. She begins brushing
her teeth with poison toothpaste
until she's foaming at the mouth,
then falls into the water and
gracefully drowns.
"How To "
Another program is "adult
theatre" which shows the adults
how to do it. It starts with the
preliminaries and tells the viewers
what to do and say. A commercial
advertises a new product that can
inspire trust: Zilch is guaranteed
to do nothing—it's something you
can believe in. Which is more than
I can say for the dramatic sections
of this play.
Set in the future, the play
revolves around an American
family: Mom, who takes an
unusual interest in her pet mouse;
Pop, who was probably concfivod
as a comic figure, but comes off a-'
a heavy hypochondriac; a sexualh
precocious daughter named
Cassie, and her greaser boyfriend
Rollo. The son, Timmy, was stil.
fighting in Asia so we mus
assume Nixon was reelected.
The tendency to view death

and suffering as humorous seems
to be a given of contemporary
life. In the play, this is revealed in
the death of the son, and indeed,
the surface incidents are made to
be funny. The TV announces the
death of Timmy and tells the
family to expect the coffin in a
few seconds. The coffin, about
the size of a shoebox, arrives
momentarily. The daughter opens
it and finds an envelope
containing Timmy's remains.
The minister is called in for a
quick funeral, but, as he is hard of

hearing, he marries the father to
the daughter by mistake. After a
brief explanation, the funeral
begins again, but the envelope has
been misplaced, or stolen. Then
we get a gratuitous little scene
where the characters line up
downstage and spotlights and a
recorded voice interrogates them.
Farts Don't Add Up
The play is a mixture of parts
which don't quite add up to a
whole. Bob Hirechfeld, who plays
Rollo, tries to be as obnoxious as
possible in his appearance and

movements. He appears as the
straight man against which the
eccentricities of the family were
played off. I did enjoy a filmed
clip of "The War Show" (brought
to you by the American
Government) as it was
authentically filmed.
The most seditious film scene
depicted the president explaining
the reason why we are fighting in
Asia. Although the "figure" did
not resemble any particular
politician, it had genitals rather
than a face. The narration was
particularly simple-minded, but
that was in keeping with the rest
of the work.
The plot contains other
unexpected events: the dead son
returns as a government official,
Rollo is killed by the TV set, the
son and daughter have sex on the
screen, etc., etc. Finally, an
announcer tells the family that it's
all a joke—for the past three days
they were on a TV show, entitled,
appropriately enough for the
audience, "You're a Fool."
Future Plans
I am somewhat disturbed by
the acclaim that the play received
and, by extension, the trend of
the Magic Theatre's work: what
they consider to be experimental.
For instance, the author of this
play, Nick Kazan, has another
idea for a future production.
In it, an audience would be
locked in the theatre for 45
minutes. Nothing would happen
onstage, except for some
background music. The audience
would then presumably get angry
and do something. After 45
minutes, a voice would announce
that the audience could watch
themselves on 3 TV consoles, or
leave the theatre.
Perhaps I'm being too critical
of their work, but I do question
the philosophy of doing
experimental works for the sake
of producing something new. In
any event, they will be doing David
Rabe's The Basic Training of
Paulo Hummel in the near future,
which I will be looking forward to
as I have seen little magic from
their company, and even less
theatre.
If you still want to see "Plastic
Panic", it'll be at the Berkeley
Magic Theatre thru Sunday, at
8:30. Tickets are $3 general
