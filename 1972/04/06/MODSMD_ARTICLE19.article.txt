# Clumsy Ballet
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
On Friday night, I had the opportunity to witness for the first time
the performance of the San Francisco Ballet Company—a grave
disappointment.
The saving grace (if there was any) was the first dance, "Split",
choreographed by John Butler in 1971. The choreography was
sensitivie and innovative, for it picked up and played upon the
nuances of Morton Subotnik's electronic score.
The dancing on the whole was satisfactory and at times downright
powerful. Butler at several points made effective use of diagonal
entrances and exits and also of distorted ballet movement.
The men and women were all dressed in white leotards and tights.
These costumes were well-chosen; for they reflected the metallic,
almost bland, quality of the music. The choreography had an
interesting way of continually changing its dynamic qualities. Often
just at the point of becoming monotonous, the dancing would
increase in speed and intensity until the audience and the dancers
were visibly caught up in the excitement.
What most impressed me about this dance was the way in which
the excitement generated by the music and choreography was always
contained—always kept more or less under the surface, so that the
audience was forced to listen hard and pay close attention to the
dancing in order to reap whatever benefits there were from the dance.
Lacks Subtlety
The set, designed by Robert Darling, however, lacked subtlety and
purpose. It was a large white geometrical figure that resembled in
some ways a Chinese kite, hung from above. It was too much like
other stage nets I have seen, and its staid quality clashed with the
frenetic quality of the music and choreography.
The second dance, "Sinfonia", choreographed in 1959 by Lew
Christensen, was a disaster. Christensen made little use of the
opportunity for free and dynamic ballet movement within the
abstract form of Bocchini's music. There was a general lack of
sensitivity not only to the potential for movement of the more
talented comapny members, but also to the music itself.
At several points, the turns and jumps performed by the dancers
were repeated far too many times. This insensitivity culminated when
one of the male dancers dropped Virginia Johnson flat on her face on
the floor at the end of the second movement. Though she gracefully
recovered from her fall, it cast a pall over the rest of the performance.
Miserable Choice
The set and costumes were miserably chosen. The lighting was
turned up and down at irrelevant points in the performance, and the
bare wall in back lent a barren rigid quality which the dance hardly
needed. The costumes lacked the same degree of innovation. They
were the traditional ballet class garb of pink tights and leotards for the
women, and black tights and white shirts for the men. The basic effort
at originality consisted of a series of West Side Story type squats and
finger snaps that only mocked the rest of the dance instead of adding
to it.
The third pice, "Both Sides Now", was choreographed by Robert
Gladstein in 1971. It was during this dance that the canned music
struck me as particularly detrimental to the over-all effectiveness of
the dance. The music switched at certain points abruptly from a lilting
rhythm to a hard rock and jazz tone.
The costuems at the beginning were effective contrasts of black
and white. However, they soon degenerated into bad color
combinations that again demonstrated the insensitivity of the whole
performance. One woman dancer was dressed in a bright neon green
and pea green combination that made me want to have Daniel
Simmons', the costume designer, eyes checked for color blindness.
The men wore footless tights that ended half way down their calfs,
making the more unskilled dancers look like awkward adolescents.
The choreography hits a blank in my memory which means it must
have blended with the mediocrity of the rest of the performance.
At the end of the evening, the company received only two curtain
calls from an only partially filled theater. The applause, as befitted the
performance, was unconvincing.

finger snaps that only mocked the rest of the dance instead of adding
to it.
The third pice, "Both Sides Now", was choreographed by Robert
Gladstein in 1971. It was during this dance that the canned music
struck me as particularly detrimental to the over-all effectiveness of
the dance. The music switched at certain points abruptly from a lilting
rhythm to a hard rock and jazz tone.
The costuems at the beginning were effective contrasts of black
and white. However, they soon degenerated into bad color
combinations that again demonstrated the insensitivity of the whole
performance. One woman dancer was dressed in a bright neon green
and pea green combination that made me want to have Daniel
Simmons', the costume designer, eyes checked for color blindness.
The men wore footless tights that ended half way down their calfs,
making the more unskilled dancers look like awkward adolescents.
The choreography hits a blank in my memory which means it must
have blended with the mediocrity of the rest of the performance.
At the end of the evening, the company received only two curtain
calls from an only partially filled theater. The applause, as befitted the
performance, was unconvincing.
On Friday night, I had the opportunity to witness for the first time
the performance of the San Francisco Ballet Company—a grave
disappointment.
The saving grace (if there was any) was the first dance, "Split",
choreographed by John Butler in 1971. The choreography was
sensitivie and innovative, for it picked up and played upon the
nuances of Morton Subotnik's electronic score.
The dancing on the whole was satisfactory and at times downright
powerful. Butler at several points made effective use of diagonal
entrances and exits and also of distorted ballet movement.
The men and women were all dressed in white leotards and tights.
These costumes were well-chosen; for they reflected the metallic,
almost bland, quality of the music. The choreography had an
interesting way of continually changing its dynamic qualities. Often
just at the point of becoming monotonous, the dancing would
increase in speed and intensity until the audience and the dancers
were visibly caught up in the excitement.
What most impressed me about this dance was the way in which
the excitement generated by the music and choreography was always
contained—always kept more or less under the surface, so that the
audience was forced to listen hard and pay close attention to the
dancing in order to reap whatever benefits there were from the dance.
Lacks Subtlety
The set, designed by Robert Darling, however, lacked subtlety and
purpose. It was a large white geometrical figure that resembled in
some ways a Chinese kite, hung from above. It was too much like
other stage nets I have seen, and its staid quality clashed with the
frenetic quality of the music and choreography.
The second dance, "Sinfonia", choreographed in 1959 by Lew
Christensen, was a disaster. Christensen made little use of the
opportunity for free and dynamic ballet movement within the
abstract form of Bocchini's music. There was a general lack of
sensitivity not only to the potential for movement of the more
talented comapny members, but also to the music itself.
At several points, the turns and jumps performed by the dancers
were repeated far too many times. This insensitivity culminated when
one of the male dancers dropped Virginia Johnson flat on her face on
the floor at the end of the second movement. Though she gracefully
recovered from her fall, it cast a pall over the rest of the performance.
Miserable Choice
The set and costumes were miserably chosen. The lighting was
turned up and down at irrelevant points in the performance, and the
bare wall in back lent a barren rigid quality which the dance hardly
needed. The costumes lacked the same degree of innovation. They
were the traditional ballet class garb of pink tights and leotards for the
women, and black tights and white shirts for the men. The basic effort
at originality consisted of a series of West Side Story type squats and
finger snaps that only mocked the rest of the dance instead of adding
to it.
