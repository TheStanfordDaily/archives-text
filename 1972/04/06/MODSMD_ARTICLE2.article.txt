# Crowd Assails Pro-Busing Stand As McGovern Attacks War Policy
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
An irate crowd of about 200
people, protesting Senator George
McGovern's stand on busing,
demonstrated outside the San
Francisco Hilton last night, while
inside McGovern told a group of 1200
that if he were President, he was
"confident" that he could have every
American, including prisoners of war,
out of Southeast Asia within 90 days.
McGovern's comments, at a $25 per
person fund-raiser, highlighted a day
of politicking that kicked off his
California Presidential primary
campaign. The California primary is
June 6.
McGovern, still basking in the glow
of his victory in Tuesday's Wisconsin
primary, accused President Nixon of
"still playing war games with the
American people."
While McGovern spoke, 200
demonstrators chanted "stop busing,
stop McGovern" and "hail Wallace" as
they milled around in front of the
posh hotel.
No Arrests
About 20 members of the San
Francisco police department arrived
on the scene when protesters
threatened to block the entrances to
the building. However, the crowd
moved away from the doors when the
officers arrived, and no arrests were
reported.
Marge Lemlow, an anti-busing
candidate for the San Francisco Board
of Education and one of the march's
organizers, asserted that McGovern
was the symbol of the "typical
hypocrisy of government leaders, the
typical 'don't do as we do, do as we
say' attitude."
Tax Reform
One marcher, who refused to be
identified, said that McGovern was
"trying to steal Wallace's issues" by
coming out in favor of tax reform.
"He just sees what's popular and then
decides to support it,"the
demonstrator said.
Close to half the crowd was
composed of members of San
Francisco's large Oriental-American
population. One of them, Agnews
Wong of the Chinese Parents
Association, told the Daily that busing
was "a social problem, not an
educational problem."
Attacks Nixon
Instead, the South Dakota Senator
concentrated his attacks on President
Nixon, and on fellow Democratic
Presidential aspirant George Wallace of
Alabama.

He said his campaign would do
away with partisan labels. "It is not
left or right to demand an end to one
of the most pointless and barbaric
wars in the history of mankind," he
said.
Appearing with McGovern were
several well-known entertainers and
area political figures. Warren Beatty
served as master of ceremonies at the
fund raiser, with actresses Barbara
Rush and Julie Christie, as well as
actors Jack Nicholson, Dennis Weaver,
and Roger Bowen, and singer Michelle
Gilliam of the Mamas and the Papas.
Sheriff Hongisto
Outside of Senator McGovern\s
appearance, the longest and loudest
applause of the evening came with the
introduction of San Francisco Sheriff
Richard Hongisto. Assemblymen John
Burton, Willie Brown, John
Vasconcellos, John Miller, Ken Mead,
John Crown, and John Knox, were all
in attendance, as well as Berkeley
Mayor Warren Widener.
Two rivals for the Democratic
congressional nomination in the 17th
District, which includes Stanford, were
also introduced. The two, Jim Stewart

and Gary Gilmore, will face each other
in the June 6 California primary.
Earlier in the evening, the
anti-busing demonstrators were joined
by a group of about 25 young people
who identified themselves as members
of the Progressive Labor Party (PLP)
and Students for a Democratic
Society.
'It's The System'
One demonstrator declared that
"it's not the candidate we're
protesting, it's the system." He refused
to identify himself, saying "it's not
who we are that's important, it's what
we're saying."
The PLP did not mix with the
anti-busing forces, but the two groups
provided a study in contrast. Said one
bystander, "that's the most damnedest
confusing protest I've ever seen."
A Hilton doorman, trying vainly to
hail passing taxis for hotel residents
through the crowd, said "I don't mind
them here except when they make it
hard to do my job. This is my living,
man."
The PLP contingent left long before
the police arrived on the scene.

NO BUSlNG—Members of the Chinese Parents Association and Wallace
supporters joined forces last night in San Francisco to protest Senator
McGovern's pro-busing stand.
The benefit dinner highlighted a
full day of campaigning for McGovern,
who flew into San Francisco
International Airport before noon
yesterday morning, where he met with
newsmen and told them that his
Wisconsin win had narrowed the field
of viable Democratic candidates to
three—himself, Senator Hubert
Humphrey, and Senator Edmund
Muskie.

in the June 6 California primary.
Earlier in the evening, the
anti-busing demonstrators were joined
by a group of about 25 young people
who identified themselves as members
of the Progressive Labor Party (PLP)
and Students for a Democratic
Society.
'It's The System'
One demonstrator declared that
"it's not the candidate we're
protesting, it's the system." He refused
to identify himself, saying "it's not
who we are that's important, it's what
we're saying."
The PLP did not mix with the
anti-busing forces, but the two groups
provided a study in contrast. Said one
bystander, "that's the most damnedest
confusing protest I've ever seen."
A Hilton doorman, trying vainly to
hail passing taxis for hotel residents
through the crowd, said "I don't mind
them here except when they make it
hard to do my job. This is my living,
man."
The PLP contingent left long before
the police arrived on the scene.

NO BUSlNG—Members of the Chinese Parents Association and Wallace
supporters joined forces last night in San Francisco to protest Senator
McGovern's pro-busing stand.
The benefit dinner highlighted a
full day of campaigning for McGovern,
who flew into San Francisco
International Airport before noon
yesterday morning, where he met with
newsmen and told them that his
Wisconsin win had narrowed the field
of viable Democratic candidates to
three—himself, Senator Hubert
Humphrey, and Senator Edmund
Muskie.
An irate crowd of about 200
people, protesting Senator George
McGovern's stand on busing,
demonstrated outside the San
Francisco Hilton last night, while
inside McGovern told a group of 1200
that if he were President, he was
"confident" that he could have every
American, including prisoners of war,
out of Southeast Asia within 90 days.
McGovern's comments, at a $25 per
person fund-raiser, highlighted a day
of politicking that kicked off his
California Presidential primary
campaign. The California primary is
June 6.
McGovern, still basking in the glow
of his victory in Tuesday's Wisconsin
primary, accused President Nixon of
"still playing war games with the
American people."
While McGovern spoke, 200
demonstrators chanted "stop busing,
stop McGovern" and "hail Wallace" as
they milled around in front of the
posh hotel.
No Arrests
About 20 members of the San
Francisco police department arrived
on the scene when protesters
threatened to block the entrances to
the building. However, the crowd
moved away from the doors when the
officers arrived, and no arrests were
reported.
Marge Lemlow, an anti-busing
candidate for the San Francisco Board
of Education and one of the march's
organizers, asserted that McGovern
was the symbol of the "typical
hypocrisy of government leaders, the
typical 'don't do as we do, do as we
say' attitude."
Tax Reform
One marcher, who refused to be
identified, said that McGovern was
"trying to steal Wallace's issues" by
coming out in favor of tax reform.
"He just sees what's popular and then
decides to support it,"the
demonstrator said.
Close to half the crowd was
composed of members of San
Francisco's large Oriental-American
population. One of them, Agnews
Wong of the Chinese Parents
Association, told the Daily that busing
was "a social problem, not an
educational problem."
Attacks Nixon
Instead, the South Dakota Senator
concentrated his attacks on President
Nixon, and on fellow Democratic
Presidential aspirant George Wallace of
Alabama.

He said his campaign would do
away with partisan labels. "It is not
left or right to demand an end to one
of the most pointless and barbaric
wars in the history of mankind," he
said.
Appearing with McGovern were
several well-known entertainers and
area political figures. Warren Beatty
served as master of ceremonies at the
fund raiser, with actresses Barbara
Rush and Julie Christie, as well as
actors Jack Nicholson, Dennis Weaver,
and Roger Bowen, and singer Michelle
Gilliam of the Mamas and the Papas.
Sheriff Hongisto
Outside of Senator McGovern\s
appearance, the longest and loudest
applause of the evening came with the
introduction of San Francisco Sheriff
Richard Hongisto. Assemblymen John
Burton, Willie Brown, John
Vasconcellos, John Miller, Ken Mead,
John Crown, and John Knox, were all
in attendance, as well as Berkeley
Mayor Warren Widener.
Two rivals for the Democratic
congressional nomination in the 17th
District, which includes Stanford, were
also introduced. The two, Jim Stewart

and Gary Gilmore, will face each other
in the June 6 California primary.
