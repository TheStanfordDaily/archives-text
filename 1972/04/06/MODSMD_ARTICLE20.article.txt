Berrigan, Nun Convicted
HARRISBURG, Fa. - The Rev. Philip Berrigan and
a nun who served as his lieutenant in the antiwar
movement wore convicted yesterday of smuggling
letters in and out of a federal prison, but a jury
deadlocked on charges that they conspired with five
other defendants to kidnap presidential aide Henry
Kissinger. The five were freed by the jury deadlock.
At the heart of the government's case was the
three-pronged conspiracy charge accusing the
"Harrisburg Seven" of scheming to kidnap
Kissinger, blow up government heating tunnels in
Washington and vandalize draft boards in several
Eastern cities. But this went by the boards as a
result of the jury's verdict.
Instead, Berrigan and his assistant in the Catholic
antiwar left, Sister Elizabeth McAlister, were
convicted of smuggling half a dozen letters in and
out of Lewisburg, Pa. federal penitentiary after the
priest entered in 1970 to begin a term he still is
serving.
The other five defendants not involved in the
letter smuggling, and thus not included in any way
whatsoever in the verdict, were Eqbal Ahmad, 41;
the Rev. Neil McLaughlin, 31; the Rev. Joseph
Wenderoth, 36; Anthony Scoblick, 31 and his wife,
Mary Cain Scoblick, 33.
Ahmad, the only non-Catholic among the group,
is a Pakistani Moslem associated with the Adlai
Stevenson Institute of International Affairs in
Chicago. McLaughlin and Wenderoth are Roman
Catholic priests, Scoblick is a former Josephite
priest and his wife is a former nun.
"We all have a feeling of celebrating a victory,"
said Sister Elizabeth, who faces a maximum
sentence of 30 years as a result of the conviction.
"The government based a whole indictment against
seven people on the exchange of correspondence
between two," she told a news conference.
Berrigan faces a maximum of 40 years in prison
as a result of his convictions.

Crippled Prosecutor Testifies
SAN JOSE, Calif. — A prosecutor crippled in a wild
shootout two years ago testified at the Angela Davis
trial yesterday that he shot three abductors to death
and wounded another inside a blood-spattered van
after he saw a judge shotgunned to death.
Testifying from a wheelchair, Assistant District
Attorney Gary Thomas, 34, gave his first public
account of the Aug. 7, 1970 Marin County
Courthouse shootout which left him permanently
paralyzed.
His voice quavering at times, Thomas
dramatically told of shooting at the men who were
holding him hostage in a van, then of being shot in
the back himself.
"... I yelled out, 'Stop firing, please, please stop
firing," Thomas said. And he disclosed that the shot
which crippled him was fired from outside the van,
presumably by guards firing at the kidnapers.
Thomas said he grabbed a gun from Jonathan
Jackson's hand and began firing after he saw Judge
Harold Haley, his wife's uncle, killed by a shotgun
blast to the head and watched the judge's face
"slowly pulling away from his skull."
Bombs Explode In Belfast
BELEAST — Two bombs shattered a calm in
Northern Ireland Wednesday as the outlawed Irish
Republican Army debated possible peace moves.
The bombs in Belfast, one of which was found
and intentionally detonated by troops, caused no
casualties. They came amid reports that William
Whitelaw, the British minister named overseer of
Northern Ireland, soon will order the release of 60
suspected guerrillas interned without trials. The
death toll from 32 months of communal violence
between Roman Catholics and Protestants mounted
to 294.
There were indications that the IRA might be
considering a halt in its guerrilla campaign, in
response to mounting public pressure. Many

rr
Catholics have called on the IRA to cease hostilities
and give a fair chance to the British peace plan,
which installed Whitelaw and ended a half century
of Protestant domination over the Catholic
minority.
Women's Rights Bill Set Hack
SACRAMENTO — Women's rights n'ceived a
setback today when the Senate Rules Committee
killed 2-2 a resolution to ratify the 27th
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
The ratification movement remains alive,
however, because two other versions of the same
resolution have been introduced.
Sen. Mervyn Dymally, D-Los Angeles, authored
the resolution which was voted on today by the
Senate Rules Committee. But he failed to appear for
the hearing and no witnesses were presented.
Seven states have ratified the amendment which
guarantees equal rights to women. Thirty-eight
ratifications are needed to take effect. Congress
approved the amendment March 22.
Congressman: 'ITT Memo True'
BALTIMORE, Md. — Dita D. Beard told Rep. Bob
Wilson she wrote a memo linking financing of the
Republican National Convention with settlement of
an antitrust suit against ITT, the Baltimore Sun
quotes the California congressman as saying.
The Sun in today's editions, also said that
Wilson, a Republican who was instrumental in
getting the convention for his home city of San
Diego, stated that William R. Merriam, Mrs. Beard's
boss in the Washington office of International
Telephone & Telegraph Corp., admitted receiving
the memo from the veteran lobbyist.
Bear& testified March 26 under oath before
a special Senate subcommittee hearing in her
hospital room in Denver, Colo., where she is being
treated for a heart condition, that she did not write
the memo.

"Harrisburg Seven" of scheming to kidnap
Kissinger, blow up government heating tunnels in
Washington and vandalize draft boards in several
Eastern cities. But this went by the boards as a
result of the jury's verdict.
Instead, Berrigan and his assistant in the Catholic
antiwar left, Sister Elizabeth McAlister, were
convicted of smuggling half a dozen letters in and
out of Lewisburg, Pa. federal penitentiary after the
priest entered in 1970 to begin a term he still is
serving.
The other five defendants not involved in the
letter smuggling, and thus not included in any way
whatsoever in the verdict, were Eqbal Ahmad, 41;
the Rev. Neil McLaughlin, 31; the Rev. Joseph
Wenderoth, 36; Anthony Scoblick, 31 and his wife,
Mary Cain Scoblick, 33.
Ahmad, the only non-Catholic among the group,
is a Pakistani Moslem associated with the Adlai
Stevenson Institute of International Affairs in
Chicago. McLaughlin and Wenderoth are Roman
Catholic priests, Scoblick is a former Josephite
priest and his wife is a former nun.
"We all have a feeling of celebrating a victory,"
said Sister Elizabeth, who faces a maximum
sentence of 30 years as a result of the conviction.
"The government based a whole indictment against
seven people on the exchange of correspondence
between two," she told a news conference.
Berrigan faces a maximum of 40 years in prison
as a result of his convictions.

Crippled Prosecutor Testifies
SAN JOSE, Calif. — A prosecutor crippled in a wild
shootout two years ago testified at the Angela Davis
trial yesterday that he shot three abductors to death
and wounded another inside a blood-spattered van
after he saw a judge shotgunned to death.
Testifying from a wheelchair, Assistant District
Attorney Gary Thomas, 34, gave his first public
account of the Aug. 7, 1970 Marin County
Courthouse shootout which left him permanently
paralyzed.
His voice quavering at times, Thomas
dramatically told of shooting at the men who were
holding him hostage in a van, then of being shot in
the back himself.
"... I yelled out, 'Stop firing, please, please stop
firing," Thomas said. And he disclosed that the shot
which crippled him was fired from outside the van,
presumably by guards firing at the kidnapers.
Thomas said he grabbed a gun from Jonathan
Jackson's hand and began firing after he saw Judge
Harold Haley, his wife's uncle, killed by a shotgun
blast to the head and watched the judge's face
"slowly pulling away from his skull."
Bombs Explode In Belfast
BELEAST — Two bombs shattered a calm in
Northern Ireland Wednesday as the outlawed Irish
Republican Army debated possible peace moves.
The bombs in Belfast, one of which was found
and intentionally detonated by troops, caused no
casualties. They came amid reports that William
Whitelaw, the British minister named overseer of
Northern Ireland, soon will order the release of 60
suspected guerrillas interned without trials. The
death toll from 32 months of communal violence
between Roman Catholics and Protestants mounted
to 294.
There were indications that the IRA might be
considering a halt in its guerrilla campaign, in
response to mounting public pressure. Many

rr
Catholics have called on the IRA to cease hostilities
and give a fair chance to the British peace plan,
which installed Whitelaw and ended a half century
of Protestant domination over the Catholic
minority.
Women's Rights Bill Set Hack
SACRAMENTO — Women's rights n'ceived a
setback today when the Senate Rules Committee
killed 2-2 a resolution to ratify the 27th
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
The ratification movement remains alive,
however, because two other versions of the same
resolution have been introduced.
Sen. Mervyn Dymally, D-Los Angeles, authored
the resolution which was voted on today by the
Senate Rules Committee. But he failed to appear for
the hearing and no witnesses were presented.
Seven states have ratified the amendment which
guarantees equal rights to women. Thirty-eight
ratifications are needed to take effect. Congress
approved the amendment March 22.
Congressman: 'ITT Memo True'
BALTIMORE, Md. — Dita D. Beard told Rep. Bob
Wilson she wrote a memo linking financing of the
Republican National Convention with settlement of

priest entered in 1970 to begin a term he still is
serving.
The other five defendants not involved in the
letter smuggling, and thus not included in any way
whatsoever in the verdict, were Eqbal Ahmad, 41;
the Rev. Neil McLaughlin, 31; the Rev. Joseph
Wenderoth, 36; Anthony Scoblick, 31 and his wife,
Mary Cain Scoblick, 33.
Ahmad, the only non-Catholic among the group,
is a Pakistani Moslem associated with the Adlai
Stevenson Institute of International Affairs in
Chicago. McLaughlin and Wenderoth are Roman
Catholic priests, Scoblick is a former Josephite
priest and his wife is a former nun.
"We all have a feeling of celebrating a victory,"
said Sister Elizabeth, who faces a maximum
sentence of 30 years as a result of the conviction.
"The government based a whole indictment against
seven people on the exchange of correspondence
between two," she told a news conference.
Berrigan faces a maximum of 40 years in prison
as a result of his convictions.

Crippled Prosecutor Testifies
SAN JOSE, Calif. — A prosecutor crippled in a wild
shootout two years ago testified at the Angela Davis
trial yesterday that he shot three abductors to death
and wounded another inside a blood-spattered van
after he saw a judge shotgunned to death.
Testifying from a wheelchair, Assistant District
Attorney Gary Thomas, 34, gave his first public
account of the Aug. 7, 1970 Marin County
Courthouse shootout which left him permanently
paralyzed.
His voice quavering at times, Thomas
dramatically told of shooting at the men who were
holding him hostage in a van, then of being shot in
the back himself.
"... I yelled out, 'Stop firing, please, please stop
firing," Thomas said. And he disclosed that the shot
which crippled him was fired from outside the van,
presumably by guards firing at the kidnapers.
Thomas said he grabbed a gun from Jonathan
Jackson's hand and began firing after he saw Judge
Harold Haley, his wife's uncle, killed by a shotgun
blast to the head and watched the judge's face
"slowly pulling away from his skull."
Bombs Explode In Belfast
BELEAST — Two bombs shattered a calm in
Northern Ireland Wednesday as the outlawed Irish
Republican Army debated possible peace moves.
The bombs in Belfast, one of which was found
and intentionally detonated by troops, caused no
casualties. They came amid reports that William
Whitelaw, the British minister named overseer of
Northern Ireland, soon will order the release of 60
suspected guerrillas interned without trials. The
death toll from 32 months of communal violence
between Roman Catholics and Protestants mounted
to 294.
There were indications that the IRA might be
considering a halt in its guerrilla campaign, in
response to mounting public pressure. Many

rr
Catholics have called on the IRA to cease hostilities
and give a fair chance to the British peace plan,
which installed Whitelaw and ended a half century
of Protestant domination over the Catholic
minority.
Women's Rights Bill Set Hack
SACRAMENTO — Women's rights n'ceived a
setback today when the Senate Rules Committee
killed 2-2 a resolution to ratify the 27th
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
The ratification movement remains alive,
however, because two other versions of the same
resolution have been introduced.
Sen. Mervyn Dymally, D-Los Angeles, authored
the resolution which was voted on today by the
Senate Rules Committee. But he failed to appear for
the hearing and no witnesses were presented.
Seven states have ratified the amendment which
guarantees equal rights to women. Thirty-eight
ratifications are needed to take effect. Congress
approved the amendment March 22.
Congressman: 'ITT Memo True'
BALTIMORE, Md. — Dita D. Beard told Rep. Bob
Wilson she wrote a memo linking financing of the
Republican National Convention with settlement of
an antitrust suit against ITT, the Baltimore Sun
quotes the California congressman as saying.
The Sun in today's editions, also said that
Wilson, a Republican who was instrumental in
getting the convention for his home city of San
Diego, stated that William R. Merriam, Mrs. Beard's
boss in the Washington office of International
Telephone & Telegraph Corp., admitted receiving
the memo from the veteran lobbyist.
Bear& testified March 26 under oath before
a special Senate subcommittee hearing in her
hospital room in Denver, Colo., where she is being
treated for a heart condition, that she did not write
the memo.
