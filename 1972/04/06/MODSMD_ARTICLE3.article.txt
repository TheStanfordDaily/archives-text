# Disagreement On Reasons
## CSEA, SEA Terminate Mutual Pact 
### GLENN GARVIN 
The Stanford Employees Associa
tion (SEA) and the California School
Employees Association (CSEA) parted
ways last Friday, but no one seems to
agree on why or how.
Both SEA and CSEA agree that the
working agreement between the two
that was set up four years ago was
terminated Friday, but who broke the
pact—and why—is a matter of dispute.
Bill Young, CSEA field representa
tive who worked with SEA when the
two organizations were affiliated, said
that he told the Stanford group on
March 17 that CSEA would have to
withdraw from campus, and that
neither side had discussed the action
up until that time.
On the other hand, SEA Acting
President Forest Futtere told the

Daily, "We voted at a membership
meeting March 7 to break away from
the CSEA. It was unanimous." He said
it was discontent with Young that
prompted the vote to sever relations.
Young said he spoke with members
of the SEA executive committee on
March 17 about the necessity of CSEA
abandoning the campus group. "We
talked about it and I put it in writing
the next day," Young explained. "I
sent them a letter. You've given me
the first indication that there was any
vote."
Lost In Election
Young said his union had to
withdraw from the campus after losing
a vote of employees on March 7 to
determine what group, if any, would
represent Stanford workers in collec
tive bargaining.
"As a result of the election, CSEA
could no longer claim to represent
anyone [at Stanford] and in fact did
not," Young said. "The executive
committee understood this and said,
'well, okay.' Their reaction was that if
the April 19 election [between the
Teamsters Union and the no union
proposal] ends in no union, we can
start all over again a year from now."
National Labor Relations Board
regulations stipulate that no bargaining
unit may hold more than one election
within a year.
Explanations Disagree
But Young's story does not mesh at
all with that of Futtere, who says that
SEA withdrew from the larger state
organization because of dissatisfaction
with Young.
"He seemed inexperienced in this

field to most of our members,"
Futtere claimed. "All comments to
Mr. [Richard] Bartlett [CSEA execu
tive director] were rejected as to
changing field representatives and
getting someone who could do the job.
He indicated he had no personal
quarrel with Young. "I personally like
the man. But he's new to the field of
labor relations at a private institution.
He handled himself very well in certain
given situations, and very poorly in
others."
No Complaints
Young said he hadn't heard any
complaints from SEA. "I'm aware of
only one person being unhappy," he
said. "But I know that being in the
public eye you can't keep people
happy all the time. It's reasonable that
more than one might be unhappy."
He denied that he was
inexperienced: "I have over 15 years
of service. I'm on the board of
directors of the Committee on Politi
cal Education. I've been a delegate to
AFL-CIO conventions. I'm on the

board of directors of several labor
councils, I've been a county labor
consultant. I am the labor consultant
to the Monterey County Industrial
Development Corporation.
"I am very experienced."
No Long Term Plans
Futtere said that SEA hadn't made
any long term plans regarding its
future without CSEA, but did say "We
are an in-house organization and
intend to remain one.
"There was a sign of relief on both
sides when we cut the ropes," Futtere
told the Daily. "CSEA is not really
suited for this line of work. They lost
the election down at Occidental
[University in Los Angeles] and they
are through with the whole business."
"I am glad the problem at Stanford
is settled, but I'm not glad we lost the
election," Young said. He said that the
election at Occidental, similar in
naturP to the one here last month, was
under appeal and that CSEA still
hoped to come out on top.

only one person being unhappy," he
said. "But I know that being in the
public eye you can't keep people
happy all the time. It's reasonable that
more than one might be unhappy."
He denied that he was
inexperienced: "I have over 15 years
of service. I'm on the board of
directors of the Committee on Politi
cal Education. I've been a delegate to
AFL-CIO conventions. I'm on the

board of directors of several labor
councils, I've been a county labor
consultant. I am the labor consultant
to the Monterey County Industrial
Development Corporation.
"I am very experienced."
No Long Term Plans
Futtere said that SEA hadn't made
any long term plans regarding its
future without CSEA, but did say "We
are an in-house organization and
intend to remain one.
"There was a sign of relief on both
sides when we cut the ropes," Futtere
told the Daily. "CSEA is not really
suited for this line of work. They lost
the election down at Occidental
[University in Los Angeles] and they
are through with the whole business."
"I am glad the problem at Stanford
is settled, but I'm not glad we lost the
election," Young said. He said that the
election at Occidental, similar in
naturP to the one here last month, was
under appeal and that CSEA still
hoped to come out on top.
The Stanford Employees Associa
tion (SEA) and the California School
Employees Association (CSEA) parted
ways last Friday, but no one seems to
agree on why or how.
Both SEA and CSEA agree that the
working agreement between the two
that was set up four years ago was
terminated Friday, but who broke the
pact—and why—is a matter of dispute.
Bill Young, CSEA field representa
tive who worked with SEA when the
two organizations were affiliated, said
that he told the Stanford group on
March 17 that CSEA would have to
withdraw from campus, and that
neither side had discussed the action
up until that time.
On the other hand, SEA Acting
President Forest Futtere told the

Daily, "We voted at a membership
meeting March 7 to break away from
the CSEA. It was unanimous." He said
it was discontent with Young that
prompted the vote to sever relations.
Young said he spoke with members
of the SEA executive committee on
March 17 about the necessity of CSEA
abandoning the campus group. "We
talked about it and I put it in writing
the next day," Young explained. "I
sent them a letter. You've given me
the first indication that there was any
vote."
Lost In Election
Young said his union had to
withdraw from the campus after losing
a vote of employees on March 7 to
determine what group, if any, would
represent Stanford workers in collec
tive bargaining.
"As a result of the election, CSEA
could no longer claim to represent
anyone [at Stanford] and in fact did
not," Young said. "The executive
committee understood this and said,
'well, okay.' Their reaction was that if
the April 19 election [between the
Teamsters Union and the no union
proposal] ends in no union, we can
start all over again a year from now."
National Labor Relations Board
regulations stipulate that no bargaining
unit may hold more than one election
within a year.
Explanations Disagree
But Young's story does not mesh at
all with that of Futtere, who says that
SEA withdrew from the larger state
organization because of dissatisfaction
with Young.
"He seemed inexperienced in this

field to most of our members,"
Futtere claimed. "All comments to
Mr. [Richard] Bartlett [CSEA execu
tive director] were rejected as to
changing field representatives and
getting someone who could do the job.
He indicated he had no personal
quarrel with Young. "I personally like
the man. But he's new to the field of
labor relations at a private institution.
He handled himself very well in certain
given situations, and very poorly in
others."
No Complaints
Young said he hadn't heard any
complaints from SEA. "I'm aware of
only one person being unhappy," he
said. "But I know that being in the
public eye you can't keep people
happy all the time. It's reasonable that
more than one might be unhappy."
