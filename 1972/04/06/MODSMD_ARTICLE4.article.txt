# North Viets Open Third Front; Thieu: 'Fighting For Existence'
## 
### 
SAIGON (AP) — North Vietnamese tanks and troops
opened a third front yesterday, slashing 20 miles across
the Cambodian border to within 60 miles of Saigon.
President Nguyen Van Thieu declared South Vietnam is
fighting for its existence.
On the major front south of the demilitarized zone,
other North Vietnamese battled to cut off the provincial
capital of Quang Tri from the south while advancing from
the north and west on that city base 19 miles south of the
zone. Enemy tanks were also on the attack in the central
highlands.
Thieu disclosed in a television and radio address that he
had asked President Nixon for maximum air and naval
support. He said North Vietnam had committed the
equivalent of five divisions to the battle south of the DMZ
in an effort to seize the two northernmost provinces,
Quang Tri and Thua Thien. He said the enemy had chosen
this time because the Americans had almost completed
their withdrawal. „
Additional 852 Bombers
President Nixon is sending additional 852 bombers to
help offset Hanoi's invasion but it remains uncertain if the
administration has decided on a resumption of widespread
air attacks in the North.
Vietnamese diplomatic sources, calling it a three-front
war now, point out that action already has flared south of
the demilitarized zone, and along a second front in the
Central Highlands. The third front is along the border of
central Cambodia.
On each of these lines, there are at least three
Communist divisions, or, 30,000 to 40,000 men on each
front.
The next few days will be rather fluid, but in a matter
of two to three weeks the Communist drive will be
contained, the Vietnamese say.
More Forces Uncommitted
American spokesmen say the North Vietnamese have
not yet committed all their ground forces to the action.
The sth, 7th and 9th divisions are in the Thay Ninh region
near the Cambodian border. The 304 th, 308 th and 324-B
divisions are in the regions south of the demilitarized
zone. The equivalent of three divisions, numbering 27,000
to 35,000 men, made up of various regiments, are in the
Central Highlands, near Kontum and Pleiku.

Earlier this week, after the size of the onslaught
became evident, the United States ordered two more
aircraft carriers to join two already off the Vietnamese
coast.
The Pentagon refused comment on the report of the
beefed-up American air power for Southeast Asia. "We
don't discuss operational matters concerning 8525," said
spokesman Jerry W. Friedheim.
"We are prepared to take whatever steps are necessary
to assure that Gen. Abrams [Creighton W. Abrams, the
U.S. commander in Vietnam) is able to protect the
remaining Americans in the war zone."
Denies ARVN Surprised
Friedheim denied that U.S. and South Vietnamese
forces were taken by surprise when the enemy crossed the
DMZ last weekend.
Although it was long known "that there existed the
capability on the part of the enemy to attack in force
across the DMZ," he said there was no way to predict his
intentions.
Despite this explanation, newsmen pressed Friedheim
to account for why the U.S. and South Vietnamese, with
their superior airpower, were unable to blunt the North
Vietnamese attack in its early stages.
Friedheim replied that weather in the area was bad and
that 50,000 to 100,000 refugees were being driven in
front of the invading force, making aerial bombing
di fficult.
Little Possibility For American Troops
The domestic political climate is acknowledged by
government officials as practically ruling out sending
American forces back into Vietnam, although they refuse
to publicly deny such a possibility.
Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield said
Tuesday there should be no use of American air power
over the North.
"It's time for Vietnamization to fish or cut bait—to
produce or else," the Montana Democrat said. "We must
get out, lock stock and barrel."
Rep. Paul McCloskey Jr. said Tuesday there should be
a "massive national outcry" against new bombing of the
North.
Without such a reaction, he went on, "I fear that the
administration will resume policies resulting in the killing
and maiming of countless thousands of civilians."
