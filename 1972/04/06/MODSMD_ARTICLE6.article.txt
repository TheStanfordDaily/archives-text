## USE To Sabotage Election 
### 
= Michael bacon

My original letter used the words Opportunist-Liberal to describe
Lyman and Kaplan and inferred that in this Union election the same
can be said for USE. Well now, what did USE have to say: They take
this "opportunity" to heap praise on and congratulate themselves for
all the good things Stanford workers gained through their own
struggles. Somehow USE, an unrecognized union that received a vote
total less than that of the Teamsters, sees itself as a prime moving
force on the campus.
They see their goals and motives in an almost missionary light and
believe, despite a poor showing in the election (much less than even
they expected), that they somehow have the support of the Stanford
Workers. The election proves the contrary. It must be obvious that
Stanford Workers did not see USE as the reason for progress at
Stanford.
One concrete example of opportunist credit-taking by USE is their
claim that they had something to do with workers receiving back pay
after the wage-price freeze. How can they claim credit for this. The
administration wanted to pay the money out and purposely waited
(held it back) until just before the election in the hopes of influencing
the no-union vote. USE had nothing to do with it and they know it.
But they're still campaigning, infighting for power. This is what they
were charged with in my original letter.
Distortion
Time after time we've heard USE use fear and distortion as an
election tactic. No one should fear that when Teamsters are elected
there will be a cut-back in benefits enjoyed by Stanford Workers. But
there's USE showing us where Stanford Workers are better off
(because of USE, of course) than other Teamster organized workers.
What USE fails to mention is that the other workers started in much
worse shape to begin with.
They fail to mention that from the other workers point of view
progress has been great. USE sounds like the administration itself,
counting off all the benefits we workers have and all the while taking
credit for them right down the line. And all the bull about high dues.
Not long ago in this area a company saw itself faced with a strong
union movement among its workers.
They came up with a sneaky plan: In the payperiod just prior to
the election, the company deducted the amount of union dues from

everyone's paycheck. Of course, eventually all the money was paid
out to the workers, but from the sound of USE it looks like they
would do the same thing, just to show you and 1 what our checks will
look like. Educational value no doubt. But if workers want a strong
bargaining voice with the administration they should expect to pay
out something. Pay nothing and get nothing.
Good Things
I am not contending that if the Teamsters win everything will be
fine or that a new struggle for a strong and progressive local will not
rise to the surface. And I am not attempting to put down USE for the
good work they've done in the past. On a personal and individual basis
they've been responsible for the settling of many grievances. This was
a good thing. But one must listen to what they now say: "We know
it'll be a rough year without a recognized union."
I wonder how they can say a year when only a few sentences
before they contend that it will take two or three (maybe more?)
years to build a majority. All of the "horsepucking" aside, this is
exactly what I had said. If a union election fails the first time around
it's sometimes a number of years before a strong movement can be
resurrected. In other words, USE admits that a no-vote in the election
will put off unionization and they can't tell you how long before
there ever will be a union on the Stanford campus. From the looks of
the last vote total it seems that USE would have us wait forever for a
strong union.
USE was a fine idea and served a useful purpose. But a vote against
Teamsters and an indefinite wait for a union, plays right into the
hands of the administration. Waiting for USE to materialize into a
strong union is a pipe-dream and not very progressive and that is why
I urged (cried?) people to vote for the Teamsters.
Hopefully in the future USE might put aside personal attack and
those awful puns on my last name. I've heard them all, believe me,
I've heard them all. In reality it is not a question of personality,
except that some people want power and others want results.
Stanford workers can't afford what even USE admits: A no vote will
put off unionization indefinitely and no one can tell you when the
impasse will end. USE is trying to sabotage the election in order to stay
alive. Vote Teamsters.

Time after time we've heard USE use fear and distortion as an
election tactic. No one should fear that when Teamsters are elected
there will be a cut-back in benefits enjoyed by Stanford Workers. But
there's USE showing us where Stanford Workers are better off
(because of USE, of course) than other Teamster organized workers.
What USE fails to mention is that the other workers started in much
worse shape to begin with.
They fail to mention that from the other workers point of view
progress has been great. USE sounds like the administration itself,
counting off all the benefits we workers have and all the while taking
credit for them right down the line. And all the bull about high dues.
Not long ago in this area a company saw itself faced with a strong
union movement among its workers.
They came up with a sneaky plan: In the payperiod just prior to
the election, the company deducted the amount of union dues from

everyone's paycheck. Of course, eventually all the money was paid
out to the workers, but from the sound of USE it looks like they
would do the same thing, just to show you and 1 what our checks will
look like. Educational value no doubt. But if workers want a strong
bargaining voice with the administration they should expect to pay
out something. Pay nothing and get nothing.
Good Things
I am not contending that if the Teamsters win everything will be
fine or that a new struggle for a strong and progressive local will not
rise to the surface. And I am not attempting to put down USE for the
good work they've done in the past. On a personal and individual basis
they've been responsible for the settling of many grievances. This was
a good thing. But one must listen to what they now say: "We know
it'll be a rough year without a recognized union."
I wonder how they can say a year when only a few sentences
before they contend that it will take two or three (maybe more?)
years to build a majority. All of the "horsepucking" aside, this is
exactly what I had said. If a union election fails the first time around
it's sometimes a number of years before a strong movement can be
resurrected. In other words, USE admits that a no-vote in the election
will put off unionization and they can't tell you how long before
there ever will be a union on the Stanford campus. From the looks of
the last vote total it seems that USE would have us wait forever for a
strong union.
USE was a fine idea and served a useful purpose. But a vote against
Teamsters and an indefinite wait for a union, plays right into the
hands of the administration. Waiting for USE to materialize into a
strong union is a pipe-dream and not very progressive and that is why
I urged (cried?) people to vote for the Teamsters.
Hopefully in the future USE might put aside personal attack and
those awful puns on my last name. I've heard them all, believe me,
I've heard them all. In reality it is not a question of personality,
except that some people want power and others want results.
Stanford workers can't afford what even USE admits: A no vote will
put off unionization indefinitely and no one can tell you when the
impasse will end. USE is trying to sabotage the election in order to stay
alive. Vote Teamsters.

My original letter used the words Opportunist-Liberal to describe
Lyman and Kaplan and inferred that in this Union election the same
can be said for USE. Well now, what did USE have to say: They take
this "opportunity" to heap praise on and congratulate themselves for
all the good things Stanford workers gained through their own
struggles. Somehow USE, an unrecognized union that received a vote
total less than that of the Teamsters, sees itself as a prime moving
force on the campus.
They see their goals and motives in an almost missionary light and
believe, despite a poor showing in the election (much less than even
they expected), that they somehow have the support of the Stanford
Workers. The election proves the contrary. It must be obvious that
Stanford Workers did not see USE as the reason for progress at
Stanford.
One concrete example of opportunist credit-taking by USE is their
claim that they had something to do with workers receiving back pay
after the wage-price freeze. How can they claim credit for this. The
administration wanted to pay the money out and purposely waited
(held it back) until just before the election in the hopes of influencing
the no-union vote. USE had nothing to do with it and they know it.
But they're still campaigning, infighting for power. This is what they
were charged with in my original letter.
