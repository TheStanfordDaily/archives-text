Thanks
We would like to take this
opportunity to thank Larry
Diamond for the amount of time
and effort he spent as a member
of the Council of Presidents this
year. The student body owes him
a great deal of thanks for his work
on the Trustee Investments issue,
as well as the recycling projects.

We have enjoyed working with
Larry this year and wish him
every success in his future plans.
Although there is very little
time left in our term of office, we
felt, as did Larry, that the
precedent should be set. The
ASSU must be the primary
commitment of a member of the
Council of Presidents.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Last Friday, some of the local
thugs and crazies of SRM invaded

the private estates of our local
elite. Having had their private
eating club intruded upon in the
past, these members of the
Academic Council were further
enraged at the presence of these
people in their own forum,
confronting them with crass talk
about political repression and
racism at Stanford. Their anger is
understandable for such intrusions
threaten the calm and removed
atmosphere, and can only destroy
the possibility of the pure thought
which must remain isolated from
the unpleasant vulgarities of
everyday life — such as racism,
genocide, Gregory White, and the
like. And it is only people like

these predominately white, male
faculty that are capable of such
thought which our system
depends on.
This body has often been
called, somewhat unfairly,
Lyman's kiss asses. (In response to
this charge, one eloquent
professor said, "Yeah, but his ass
sure is a smooth one.") That term
doesn't really do justice to their
role in society. More important
than acting as a subtle but reliable
rubber stamp for any
administration decree or act
(whether by their actions or their
silence), they are the means of
intellectual production which the
ruling class (Board of Trustees and
their like) owns, controls, and
uses to their advantage.
It is the ideas expressed by
men like these and propagated by
institutions like Stanford that are
used to justify or obscure the acts
of daily oppression which are
coming down not only on third
world nations but increasingly on
all poor and working people in
this country. ("Racism? So
what?" shouted one professor in
response to our demand
concerning Chris Laury.)
It is only when they are
confronted directly and when
they themselves have to do the
actual job of repression that their
liberal form disintegrates and the
liberal tactic of separating their
own actions from the

consequences of those actions
fails to hide their guilt. The "we
only make the bombs, we can't
tell the Department of Defense
what to do with them" line falls
apart when they themselves have
to deal with the forces which
threaten their position.
Then their ideology of freedom
of the individual and freedom of
speech must retreat again as not
must only third world peoples be
excluded but even Stanford
students who side with those
liberation struggles must be
excluded. While normally the
repression is carried but by hired
thugs in Vietnam or E. Menlo
Park, on Friday themselves used a
mild form of repression by which
they further demonstrated that
their plea of innocence to
complicity in war crimes on
account of their desire for
individual liberties at Stanford is a
defense of the freedom of a
certain privileged group of
individuals. The freedom they
defend turns out in practice to be
primarily the freedom of a certain
class to exploit people, and
secondly the freedom of others
who willingly and profitably help
them do their business. On the
other side of this sacred freedom
is of course the oppression of
millions of people around the
world.
So when we entered the
Academic Council to find out
their response to the escalating
repression on their own campus,
they answered by shouting us
down and not even allowing us to
make a statement. Remember it
was these people who were so

outraged when ace war criminal
Henry Cabot Lodge was heckled
last year. Were these faculty's
actions a "disruption"?
I think by now we realize that
Schwartz and Lyman will decide
that it was not those faculty who
were disruptive, but ourselves for
having the audacity to confront
them with what is going on in
their own backyard. Yes, it
becomes clearer and clearer that a
disruption of a "legitimate
university function" is any act
threatening or preventing the
smooth execution of Stanford's
role in serving the interests of US
imperialism — be it in the
production of personnel
(Placement Center "disruption"),
or ideology (Shockley or Lodge
"disruption"), or technology
(AEL or future Hansen Lab
"disruptions").
Through practice it has become
easier for us to understand what is

meant by the term "liberal
fascism". Liberal in their rhetoric,
with freedom foi; all those
individuals whose actions coincide
with their interests! Fascist in
their effects on all those around
the world who threaten to intrude
into their private eating club. We
can be sure that in the future the
role of these enlightened
professors, embodiments of the
most highly developed ideas and
tastes, will be the same role that
their counterparts played in Nazi
Germany. Their response to the
heightening repression in this
country in the future will be the
same as their response to the
slaughter of the Indochinese
people and the political repression
at Stanford today.

role in serving the interests of US
imperialism — be it in the
production of personnel
(Placement Center "disruption"),

"disruptions").
Through practice it has become
easier for us to understand what is

meant by the term "liberal
fascism". Liberal in their rhetoric,
with freedom foi; all those
individuals whose actions coincide

their effects on all those around
the world who threaten to intrude
into their private eating club. We
can be sure that in the future the
role of these enlightened
professors, embodiments of the
most highly developed ideas and
tastes, will be the same role that
their counterparts played in Nazi
Germany. Their response to the

We would like to take this
opportunity to thank Larry
Diamond for the amount of time
and effort he spent as a member
of the Council of Presidents this
year. The student body owes him
a great deal of thanks for his work
on the Trustee Investments issue,
as well as the recycling projects.

We have enjoyed working with
Larry this year and wish him
every success in his future plans.
Although there is very little
time left in our term of office, we
felt, as did Larry, that the
precedent should be set. The
ASSU must be the primary
commitment of a member of the

Editor, THE DAILY:
Last Friday, some of the local
thugs and crazies of SRM invaded

the private estates of our local
elite. Having had their private
eating club intruded upon in the
past, these members of the
Academic Council were further
enraged at the presence of these
people in their own forum,
confronting them with crass talk
about political repression and
racism at Stanford. Their anger is
understandable for such intrusions
threaten the calm and removed
atmosphere, and can only destroy
the possibility of the pure thought
which must remain isolated from
the unpleasant vulgarities of
everyday life — such as racism,
genocide, Gregory White, and the
like. And it is only people like

these predominately white, male
faculty that are capable of such
thought which our system
depends on.
This body has often been
called, somewhat unfairly,
Lyman's kiss asses. (In response to
this charge, one eloquent
professor said, "Yeah, but his ass
sure is a smooth one.") That term
doesn't really do justice to their
role in society. More important
than acting as a subtle but reliable
rubber stamp for any
administration decree or act
(whether by their actions or their
silence), they are the means of
intellectual production which the
ruling class (Board of Trustees and
their like) owns, controls, and
uses to their advantage.
It is the ideas expressed by
men like these and propagated by
institutions like Stanford that are
used to justify or obscure the acts
of daily oppression which are
coming down not only on third
world nations but increasingly on
all poor and working people in
this country. ("Racism? So
what?" shouted one professor in
response to our demand
concerning Chris Laury.)
It is only when they are
confronted directly and when
they themselves have to do the
actual job of repression that their
liberal form disintegrates and the
liberal tactic of separating their
own actions from the

consequences of those actions
fails to hide their guilt. The "we
only make the bombs, we can't
tell the Department of Defense
what to do with them" line falls
apart when they themselves have
to deal with the forces which
threaten their position.
Then their ideology of freedom
of the individual and freedom of
speech must retreat again as not
must only third world peoples be
excluded but even Stanford
students who side with those
liberation struggles must be
excluded. While normally the
repression is carried but by hired
thugs in Vietnam or E. Menlo
Park, on Friday themselves used a
mild form of repression by which
they further demonstrated that
their plea of innocence to
complicity in war crimes on
account of their desire for
individual liberties at Stanford is a
defense of the freedom of a
certain privileged group of
individuals. The freedom they
defend turns out in practice to be
primarily the freedom of a certain
class to exploit people, and
secondly the freedom of others
who willingly and profitably help
them do their business. On the
other side of this sacred freedom
is of course the oppression of
millions of people around the
world.
So when we entered the
Academic Council to find out
their response to the escalating
repression on their own campus,
they answered by shouting us
down and not even allowing us to
make a statement. Remember it
was these people who were so

outraged when ace war criminal
Henry Cabot Lodge was heckled
last year. Were these faculty's
actions a "disruption"?
I think by now we realize that
Schwartz and Lyman will decide
that it was not those faculty who
were disruptive, but ourselves for
having the audacity to confront
them with what is going on in
their own backyard. Yes, it
becomes clearer and clearer that a
disruption of a "legitimate
university function" is any act
threatening or preventing the
smooth execution of Stanford's
role in serving the interests of US
imperialism — be it in the
production of personnel
(Placement Center "disruption"),
or ideology (Shockley or Lodge

certain privileged group of
individuals. The freedom they
defend turns out in practice to be
primarily the freedom of a certain
class to exploit people, and
secondly the freedom of others
who willingly and profitably help
them do their business. On the
other side of this sacred freedom
is of course the oppression of
millions of people around the
world.
So when we entered the
Academic Council to find out
their response to the escalating
repression on their own campus,
they answered by shouting us
down and not even allowing us to
make a statement. Remember it
was these people who were so

outraged when ace war criminal
Henry Cabot Lodge was heckled
last year. Were these faculty's
actions a "disruption"?
I think by now we realize that
Schwartz and Lyman will decide
that it was not those faculty who
were disruptive, but ourselves for
having the audacity to confront
them with what is going on in
their own backyard. Yes, it
becomes clearer and clearer that a
disruption of a "legitimate
university function" is any act
threatening or preventing the
smooth execution of Stanford's
role in serving the interests of US
imperialism — be it in the
production of personnel
(Placement Center "disruption"),
or ideology (Shockley or Lodge
"disruption"), or technology
(AEL or future Hansen Lab
"disruptions").
Through practice it has become
easier for us to understand what is

meant by the term "liberal
fascism". Liberal in their rhetoric,
with freedom foi; all those
individuals whose actions coincide
with their interests! Fascist in
their effects on all those around
the world who threaten to intrude
into their private eating club. We
can be sure that in the future the
role of these enlightened
professors, embodiments of the
most highly developed ideas and
tastes, will be the same role that
their counterparts played in Nazi
Germany. Their response to the
heightening repression in this
country in the future will be the
same as their response to the
slaughter of the Indochinese
people and the political repression
at Stanford today.

Thanks
We would like to take this
opportunity to thank Larry
Diamond for the amount of time
and effort he spent as a member
of the Council of Presidents this
year. The student body owes him
a great deal of thanks for his work
on the Trustee Investments issue,
as well as the recycling projects.

We have enjoyed working with
Larry this year and wish him
every success in his future plans.
Although there is very little
time left in our term of office, we
felt, as did Larry, that the
precedent should be set. The
ASSU must be the primary
commitment of a member of the
Council of Presidents.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Last Friday, some of the local
thugs and crazies of SRM invaded

the private estates of our local
elite. Having had their private
eating club intruded upon in the
past, these members of the
Academic Council were further
enraged at the presence of these
people in their own forum,
confronting them with crass talk
about political repression and
racism at Stanford. Their anger is
understandable for such intrusions
threaten the calm and removed
atmosphere, and can only destroy
the possibility of the pure thought
which must remain isolated from
the unpleasant vulgarities of
everyday life — such as racism,
genocide, Gregory White, and the
like. And it is only people like

these predominately white, male
faculty that are capable of such
thought which our system
depends on.
This body has often been
called, somewhat unfairly,
Lyman's kiss asses. (In response to
this charge, one eloquent
professor said, "Yeah, but his ass
sure is a smooth one.") That term
doesn't really do justice to their
role in society. More important
than acting as a subtle but reliable
rubber stamp for any
administration decree or act
(whether by their actions or their
silence), they are the means of
intellectual production which the
ruling class (Board of Trustees and
their like) owns, controls, and
uses to their advantage.
It is the ideas expressed by
men like these and propagated by
institutions like Stanford that are
used to justify or obscure the acts
of daily oppression which are
coming down not only on third
world nations but increasingly on
all poor and working people in
this country. ("Racism? So
what?" shouted one professor in
response to our demand
concerning Chris Laury.)
It is only when they are
confronted directly and when
they themselves have to do the
actual job of repression that their
liberal form disintegrates and the
liberal tactic of separating their
own actions from the

consequences of those actions
fails to hide their guilt. The "we
only make the bombs, we can't
tell the Department of Defense
what to do with them" line falls
apart when they themselves have
to deal with the forces which
threaten their position.
Then their ideology of freedom
of the individual and freedom of
speech must retreat again as not
must only third world peoples be
excluded but even Stanford
students who side with those
liberation struggles must be
excluded. While normally the
repression is carried but by hired
thugs in Vietnam or E. Menlo
Park, on Friday themselves used a
mild form of repression by which
they further demonstrated that
their plea of innocence to
complicity in war crimes on
account of their desire for
individual liberties at Stanford is a
defense of the freedom of a
certain privileged group of
individuals. The freedom they
defend turns out in practice to be
primarily the freedom of a certain
class to exploit people, and
secondly the freedom of others
who willingly and profitably help
them do their business. On the
other side of this sacred freedom
is of course the oppression of
millions of people around the
world.
