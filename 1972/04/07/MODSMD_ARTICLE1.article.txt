# Faculty Club Employees Ask Lionetti's Dismissal
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Three Faculty Club kitchen
workers will file grievances with
Personnel Director Emil Sarpa this
morning, asking that Head Chef
Arturo Lionetti be dismissed for
making racist remarks to black
employees.
Library worker Roy Boggs will file
the written grievances for John
Patterson, Ray Bradford, and Leonard
McKinney. Boggs, who was himself
involved in an incident with Lionetti
in February, is representing the three
workers in the matter.
The grievances also touched off a
dispute between some of the
supporters of the three workers and
the Teamsters Union.
A seven-page statement issued to
the Daily last night by Mike Dawson,
former chairman of the Black Student
Union and the ASSU Senate, said that
Lionetti "is guilty of repeatedly
abusing Third World and women
workers.
"Reportedly the abuse has been
both physical and verbal."
Dawson's statement listed several
racial slurs allegedly made by Lionetti,
and charged that Patterson had already
submitted an informal grievance to
Philip Duffy, Tresidder business
manager.
Avoid Lionetti
Boggs confirmed that the informal
grievance report had been made.
"Duffy just kind of told him
[Patterson] that this was the way
Lionetti was, and it was something
you had to live with. He said to avoid
Lionetti."
Duffy at first denied any meeting
with Patterson or knowledge of any
grievance, but after a Daily reporter
read Dawson's statement over the
phone, Duffy admitted that he had
spoken to the kitchen helper.
"I talked to Patterson some time
ago," he said. "I have no further
comment." Forrest Tregea, Faculty
Club manager, was not available for
comment.
Dawson's statement listed several
specific charges against Lionetti. "The
first incident occurred in February,"
the statement said. "While working in
the kitchen he [Lionetti] told a joke
whose most noticeable feature was a
punch line that highlighted 'Flip
Wilson's black balls.' "
The next incident allegedly took
place on March 16, when Lionetti told
McKinney to polish silverware "until
it shines like a nigger's ass," according

to Dawson's statement.
Lazy
It was after this, Dawson said, that
Patterson took his grievance to Duffy.
Later on, according to the statement,
Lionetti called Mexicans "lazy" and
said, "Mexicans always make their
women work while they do nothing."
The statement also said that
Lionetti told Patterson he would "kill
his daughter before he would let her
marry a Mexican," and that he issued
orders for Patterson to wear gloves
because "I don't want any black hands
in my customer's food."
Lionetti, contacted by the Daily at
his home in San Jose last night, denied
any problems in the kitchen. "I went in
at 7 this morning, I did my marketing,
I went to a conference at 8 a.m. This is
the first I heard about it,"he said.
He was extremely upset when a
Daily reporter told him of the
grievances. "I don't know what they're
beefing about." He asked for specific
charges, but when the reporter began
reading Dawson's statement, he
interjected, "This is nothing new, I've
heard all this bullshit before, I don't
have to listen to this. Get to the point.
No Prejudices
"If I tell you that none of it is true,
will you print what I say? All right,
none of it is true. We don't hold any
prejudices. My daughter is a junior at
San Jose State, and we don't hold any
prejudices. I have friends who aren't
white. I don't know where they get
this stuff about Chicanos.
"These guys have worked with me
for a year. They like it. I think
somebody is putting words in his
mouth. Someone is talking for them.
I'm sure whatever they say isn't said
by them," Lionetti continued.
Boggs last night claimed that the
Teamsters Union tried to interfere
with settlement of the grievance, and
said that union representatives "pulled
a mobster bit."
Strong Arm Move
"There was a meeting behind the
Faculty Club Wednesday night, with
just a couple of people talking to
Patterson. Then this van appears, and
about 30 guys jump out [Teamster
Organizer Rudy Tham said there were
actually only seven] and they pulled a
strong arm move.
"They told Lionetti that unless he
quit jiving around with the black
workers he would be walking in an
unemployment line, with some added
insinuations about walking it on
crutches."

Boggs has had his own trouble with
Lionetti. In early February Lionetti
ordered him out of a Harvard Club
meeting at the Faculty Club. (Boggs is
a Harvard alumnus.) Faculty Club
President David Mason later wrote
Boggs a letter of apology and promised
that the incident would never be
repeated.
Boggs said that Patterson held a
meeting yesterday morning with
several members of Venceremos and
the Teamsters, but that the union was
uncooperative. "Patterson said, 'All
right, fine, you scared the living
daylights out of Lionetti, but I want
to carry this program through.' But
the Teamsters said it would hurt them
in the election and they wanted to
drop it till after that was over.
April Vote
University employees vote April 19
on whether to allow the Teamsters to
represent them in collective
bargaining.
"They just want to look good in
the election," Boggs concluded.
Tham said the meeting dealt mostly
with a personality clash between
Patterson and Lionetti, and that the
Teamsters, by intervening, got a raise
and a promotion for Patterson.
"They wanted to demonstrate,"
Tham said of the group that met with
him yesterday. "We told them to
knock it off. No fucking radical group
is going to dictate policy to us."
Lionetti denied that anyone met
with him concerning any worker
grievance, and said that the raise and
promotion was automatic, regardless
of what he did.
