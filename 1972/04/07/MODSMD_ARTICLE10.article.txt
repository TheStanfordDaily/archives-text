Trivia Program
Recent events in the past two
thousand years show that we live
in a time of precedented turmoil
and change. On all sides, mankind
is beset by significant problems,
Foremost among these is the
problem of significance. But for
significance, there would be no
significant problems. Thus, there
is a clear cut need in our society
for the study of insignificance.
In light of this, Stanford
University is pleased to announce
its selection as the first University
to offer an undergraduate minor
program in Trivia.
The program will be funded by
a joint $6.87 grant from the Flat
Earth Society and the Elvish
Study Circle. It has been endorsed
by Venceremos and the Daughters
of the American Revolution, both
militantly trivial groups.
The program will be a fully
accredited undergraduate minor
course of study (there is nothing
major about it), leading to a B.S.
degree. Graduate programs in
trivia have been available since
1189 A.D.
The program will be
coordinated by the Classics
Department, which has done the
best of any department in
preserving itself from significance.
Present plans calls for a 15 unit
core sequence with upper division
classes offered by each
department.
To insure insignificance, upper
division classes will be taught
entirely by teaching assistants.
Undergraduates wishing to offer
courses not included in the regular
curriculum will be encouraged to
do so.
The core curriculum will be a
three course sequence with
courses to be taught by an
outstanding authority in the field.
The order in which they are taken
doesn't really matter.
Religion and Science
(''Cosmology, Life and Thought")
will be taught by Edwin S.
Hubble, founder of Scientology.
It will cover such topics as
ethers, spirits and vital humors,

spontaneous generation, the earth
as a plane surface, the seven
spheres of the universe, home
alchemy, the Albigensian heresy,
angels, pinheads, comparative
catechism and godhead.
Social Science ("Society,
Personality and Incompression")
will be taught by Abigail Van
Buren and Harold Stassen. Topics
include: comparative cookbooks,
Freud's butterflies, bureaucratic
forms, comparative crosslinguisic
swear words, price fluctuations in
the chickpea market and nonsense
syllables.
Literature and the Arts
("Symbols and Meaninglessness")
will be taught by A 1 Capp and
Nora Barnacle.
Possible topics include:
Chinese checkers, bestsellers
through the ages, the minor
character, my favorite crossword
puzzles, the Dada movement,
Revolutionary and Marxist Art,
the frames of great paintings, and
funny comix.
Early studies indicate that
many courses required for regular
traditional department majors fit
well in the trivia program. Credit
for many of these courses will be
awarded toward a trivia minor.

As far as I recall, our beloved
VP is scheduled to bless a feast at
the Cabana Hash House on
Saturday, April 8, without even
using electronic amplification.
They're probably having SOS, so
all I can say is BFD. Had they
planned the feast 7 days earlier, it
would have "complimented
tradition".
Two weeks later. . . .
An incredibly humorous thing
happened just recently. It seems
that the Mad Hatter was throwing
a much publicized tea party
(greatly criticized by his enemies,
I might add) for several of his
"friends". He had visualized one
of his usual programs for the

entertainment of his guests.
However, an unexpected, quite
comical situation transpired. Most
of the entertainers cancelled their
"engagement"; moreover, those
that came refused to perform,
leaving the Hatter feeling "really
average" and embarrassed, to say
the least.
Moral of the story: For an
invective to be effective, think
creative and selective, and so,
peacefully achieve the objective.

This year is the first year of the
18 year-old vote and perhaps one
of the most important election
years ever.
Breaking down the possible
youth vote, the new 18 to 20
year-old populace totals 11
million, and the composite of 18
to 24 year-olds mounts 25
million. The 1968 election was
decided by 500,000 votes; the
new 18 year-old vote with 11
million votes certainly could turn
the table of an election.
The registration drive is
progressing now into the last 6
days of voter registration before
the deadline of the June 6th
primary election. After April
13th, voter registration will close
down until after the primaries
when voter registration
organizations will begin an all-out
effort before November.
All people should register if
he/she is not registered, or if
he/she has changed legal address
within California (including
considering campus address as
legal address), or if he/she has a
name change, or if he/she wishes
to change party affiliation.
It should be noted that the
voter rolls are purged every two
years unless the person has voted
once every two years in a
gubernatorial or a presidential
election. Also, in order to vote on
any referendum, one has to be a
registered voter. Expected to
appear on the November ballot
are the "Women's Rigths
Referendum," the "Clean
Air/Water Environmental
Referendum" as well as the
infamous "Marijuana Initiative."
Another bill that requires voter
status is the "Recall Reagan
Petition."
These last six days are
obviously of primary significance
for the nation and for the voter as
a prelude of the National
Election. Deputy registrars can
register residents of any California
resident during this period.

As far as I recall, our beloved
VP is scheduled to bless a feast at
the Cabana Hash House on
Saturday, April 8, without even
using electronic amplification.
They're probably having SOS, so
all I can say is BFD. Had they
planned the feast 7 days earlier, it
would have "complimented
tradition".
Two weeks later. . . .
An incredibly humorous thing
happened just recently. It seems
that the Mad Hatter was throwing
a much publicized tea party
(greatly criticized by his enemies,
I might add) for several of his
"friends". He had visualized one
of his usual programs for the

entertainment of his guests.
However, an unexpected, quite
comical situation transpired. Most
of the entertainers cancelled their
"engagement"; moreover, those
that came refused to perform,
leaving the Hatter feeling "really
average" and embarrassed, to say
the least.
Moral of the story: For an
invective to be effective, think
creative and selective, and so,
peacefully achieve the objective.

This year is the first year of the
18 year-old vote and perhaps one
of the most important election
years ever.
Breaking down the possible
youth vote, the new 18 to 20
year-old populace totals 11
million, and the composite of 18
to 24 year-olds mounts 25
million. The 1968 election was
decided by 500,000 votes; the
new 18 year-old vote with 11
million votes certainly could turn
the table of an election.
The registration drive is
progressing now into the last 6
days of voter registration before
the deadline of the June 6th
primary election. After April
13th, voter registration will close
down until after the primaries
when voter registration
organizations will begin an all-out
effort before November.
All people should register if
he/she is not registered, or if
he/she has changed legal address
within California (including
considering campus address as
legal address), or if he/she has a
name change, or if he/she wishes
to change party affiliation.
It should be noted that the
voter rolls are purged every two
years unless the person has voted
once every two years in a
gubernatorial or a presidential
election. Also, in order to vote on
any referendum, one has to be a
registered voter. Expected to
appear on the November ballot
are the "Women's Rigths
Referendum," the "Clean
Air/Water Environmental
Referendum" as well as the
infamous "Marijuana Initiative."
Another bill that requires voter
status is the "Recall Reagan
Petition."
These last six days are
obviously of primary significance
for the nation and for the voter as
a prelude of the National
Election. Deputy registrars can
register residents of any California
resident during this period.

Trivia Program
Recent events in the past two
thousand years show that we live
in a time of precedented turmoil
and change. On all sides, mankind
is beset by significant problems,
Foremost among these is the
problem of significance. But for
significance, there would be no
significant problems. Thus, there
is a clear cut need in our society
for the study of insignificance.
In light of this, Stanford
University is pleased to announce
its selection as the first University
to offer an undergraduate minor
program in Trivia.
The program will be funded by
a joint $6.87 grant from the Flat
Earth Society and the Elvish
Study Circle. It has been endorsed
by Venceremos and the Daughters
of the American Revolution, both
militantly trivial groups.
The program will be a fully
accredited undergraduate minor
course of study (there is nothing
major about it), leading to a B.S.
degree. Graduate programs in
trivia have been available since
1189 A.D.
The program will be
coordinated by the Classics
Department, which has done the
best of any department in
preserving itself from significance.
Present plans calls for a 15 unit
core sequence with upper division
classes offered by each
department.
To insure insignificance, upper
division classes will be taught
entirely by teaching assistants.
Undergraduates wishing to offer
courses not included in the regular
curriculum will be encouraged to
do so.
The core curriculum will be a
three course sequence with
courses to be taught by an
outstanding authority in the field.
The order in which they are taken
doesn't really matter.
Religion and Science
(''Cosmology, Life and Thought")
will be taught by Edwin S.
Hubble, founder of Scientology.
It will cover such topics as
ethers, spirits and vital humors,

spontaneous generation, the earth
as a plane surface, the seven
spheres of the universe, home
alchemy, the Albigensian heresy,
angels, pinheads, comparative
catechism and godhead.
Social Science ("Society,
Personality and Incompression")
will be taught by Abigail Van
Buren and Harold Stassen. Topics
include: comparative cookbooks,
Freud's butterflies, bureaucratic
forms, comparative crosslinguisic
swear words, price fluctuations in
the chickpea market and nonsense
syllables.
Literature and the Arts
("Symbols and Meaninglessness")
will be taught by A 1 Capp and
Nora Barnacle.
Possible topics include:
Chinese checkers, bestsellers
through the ages, the minor
character, my favorite crossword
puzzles, the Dada movement,
Revolutionary and Marxist Art,
the frames of great paintings, and
funny comix.
Early studies indicate that
many courses required for regular
traditional department majors fit
well in the trivia program. Credit
for many of these courses will be
awarded toward a trivia minor.

Trivia Program
Recent events in the past two
thousand years show that we live
in a time of precedented turmoil
and change. On all sides, mankind
is beset by significant problems,
Foremost among these is the
problem of significance. But for
significance, there would be no
significant problems. Thus, there
is a clear cut need in our society
for the study of insignificance.
In light of this, Stanford
University is pleased to announce
its selection as the first University
to offer an undergraduate minor
program in Trivia.
The program will be funded by
a joint $6.87 grant from the Flat
Earth Society and the Elvish
Study Circle. It has been endorsed
by Venceremos and the Daughters
of the American Revolution, both
militantly trivial groups.
The program will be a fully
accredited undergraduate minor
course of study (there is nothing
major about it), leading to a B.S.
degree. Graduate programs in
trivia have been available since
1189 A.D.
The program will be
coordinated by the Classics
Department, which has done the
best of any department in
preserving itself from significance.
Present plans calls for a 15 unit
core sequence with upper division
classes offered by each
department.
To insure insignificance, upper
division classes will be taught
entirely by teaching assistants.
Undergraduates wishing to offer
courses not included in the regular
curriculum will be encouraged to
do so.
The core curriculum will be a
three course sequence with
courses to be taught by an
outstanding authority in the field.
The order in which they are taken
doesn't really matter.
Religion and Science
(''Cosmology, Life and Thought")
will be taught by Edwin S.
Hubble, founder of Scientology.
It will cover such topics as
ethers, spirits and vital humors,

spontaneous generation, the earth
as a plane surface, the seven
spheres of the universe, home
alchemy, the Albigensian heresy,
angels, pinheads, comparative
catechism and godhead.
Social Science ("Society,
Personality and Incompression")
will be taught by Abigail Van
Buren and Harold Stassen. Topics
include: comparative cookbooks,
Freud's butterflies, bureaucratic
forms, comparative crosslinguisic
swear words, price fluctuations in
the chickpea market and nonsense
syllables.
Literature and the Arts
("Symbols and Meaninglessness")
will be taught by A 1 Capp and
Nora Barnacle.
Possible topics include:
Chinese checkers, bestsellers
through the ages, the minor
character, my favorite crossword
puzzles, the Dada movement,
Revolutionary and Marxist Art,
the frames of great paintings, and
funny comix.
Early studies indicate that
many courses required for regular
traditional department majors fit
well in the trivia program. Credit
for many of these courses will be
awarded toward a trivia minor.

Agwho?
As far as I recall, our beloved
VP is scheduled to bless a feast at
the Cabana Hash House on
Saturday, April 8, without even
using electronic amplification.
They're probably having SOS, so
all I can say is BFD. Had they
planned the feast 7 days earlier, it
would have "complimented
tradition".
Two weeks later. . . .
An incredibly humorous thing
happened just recently. It seems
that the Mad Hatter was throwing
a much publicized tea party
(greatly criticized by his enemies,
I might add) for several of his
"friends". He had visualized one
of his usual programs for the

entertainment of his guests.
However, an unexpected, quite
comical situation transpired. Most
of the entertainers cancelled their
"engagement"; moreover, those
that came refused to perform,
leaving the Hatter feeling "really
average" and embarrassed, to say
the least.
Moral of the story: For an
invective to be effective, think
creative and selective, and so,
peacefully achieve the objective.

Youth Power
This year is the first year of the
18 year-old vote and perhaps one
of the most important election
years ever.
Breaking down the possible
youth vote, the new 18 to 20
year-old populace totals 11
million, and the composite of 18
to 24 year-olds mounts 25
million. The 1968 election was
decided by 500,000 votes; the
new 18 year-old vote with 11
million votes certainly could turn
the table of an election.
The registration drive is
progressing now into the last 6
days of voter registration before
the deadline of the June 6th
primary election. After April
13th, voter registration will close
down until after the primaries
when voter registration
organizations will begin an all-out
effort before November.
All people should register if
he/she is not registered, or if
he/she has changed legal address
within California (including
considering campus address as
legal address), or if he/she has a
name change, or if he/she wishes
to change party affiliation.
It should be noted that the
voter rolls are purged every two
years unless the person has voted
once every two years in a
gubernatorial or a presidential
election. Also, in order to vote on
any referendum, one has to be a
registered voter. Expected to
appear on the November ballot
are the "Women's Rigths
Referendum," the "Clean
Air/Water Environmental
Referendum" as well as the
infamous "Marijuana Initiative."
Another bill that requires voter
status is the "Recall Reagan
Petition."
These last six days are
obviously of primary significance
for the nation and for the voter as
a prelude of the National
Election. Deputy registrars can
