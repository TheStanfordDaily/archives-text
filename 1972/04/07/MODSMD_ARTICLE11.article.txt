## Ashbrook Vs. Nixon 
### 
Noel casey

Only two names will appear on the California
Presidential Primary Republican ballot: Richard
Nixon and John Ashbrook. California Republicans
have the opportunity to help restore their party to
conservative principles, which are its bedrock, by
voting for John Ashbrook.
That the votes of conservative Republicans can be
influential cannot be doubted. The mere
announcement of Ashbrook's candidacy in
December aborted plans to chop Spiro Agnew from
the ticket. Ashbrook's focus on military
preparedness as his principal issue resulted in a
last-minute addition of several million dollars to the
fiscal 1973 budget for defense research.
Politicians have a natural tendency to bend to
pressure. The single form of pressure which makes a
lasting impression on a successful politician is his
losing opponent's best arguments. In 1952, the most
telling issue Adlai Stevenson used was a charge that
the Republicans planned to dismember the New
Deal. After taking office, this is precisely what
General Eisenhower took pains not to do. In 1960,
Richard Nixon's single most telling charge was that
Kennedy would appease Red China by not
defending Quemoy and Matsu.
On taking office, Kennedy took pains to avoid
any appearance of accomodation with the Chinese
Communists. In 1964, Barry Goldwater demanded
the bombing of North Vietnam and higher defense
spending. Lyndon Johnson shortly after the election
began heavy bombing of North Vietnam and sharply
increased defense spending. In 1969, upon assuming
the Presidency, Richard Nixon began implementing
essentially the program which Hubert Humphrey
would have imposed. Nixon did not implement the
conservative program promised in the 1968
Republican platform because there was no real (i.e.,
electoral) pressure to do so. The Ashbrook
candidacy supplies the opportunity to exert that
pressure.
Nixon
"What if we Republicans had told the public in
1968 that we would promote record domestic
spending programs, continue our defense
deterioration and promote a guaranteed income? Or
if candidate Nixon had said, 'I am now a
Keynesian'? I feel the voters would have stuck to
the party with real expertise in these areas, the
Democratic party. We offered change and it was to
be in the conservative direction. We were elected on
that basis."
Thus John Ashbrook, six-term member of the
House of Representatives from Ohio's 17th district,
former chairman of the American Conservative
Union, and a key member of the 1964 Draft
Goldwater movement, announced his challenge to
Richard Nixon for the 1972 Republican Presidential
nomination.
The great opportunity of the Ashbrook
candidacy is the chance it gives us to reflect — and
see just how thorough Richard Nixon's failure to
implement sensible Republican policies has been. He

has failed to check the anti-social power of the big
labor unions, whose strikes have done so much to
slow the economic recovery. Associating the
Republicans with Hoffa and the Teamsters is no
substitute. He has failed to free business from the
strangling net of federal regulation.
Instead, he has by capitulating to the
Galbraithian lust for wage and price controls, struck
probably the single heaviest blow for socialism in
this country since the days of F.D.R. He has failed
to control the ambitious federal bureaucracy, so
that government policy can still be undermined, as
it was over Bangla Desh, by hostile leaks from the
State Department, and so that HUD and HEW
officials are still conducting pogroms against towns
and suburbs which dare to resist their social
planning.
Perhaps most dangerous of all, he has permitted
one of an American's most cherished rights — to
shape and improve the destiny of his own children
— to be jeopardized. Further, by allowing the
growth of compulsory busing against the wishes of a
clear majority of the people, he has shaken the
country's faith in its own institutions.
If Humphrey or one of the openly Peacenik
Democrats had been elected in 1968, we might have
expected the failure to moderninze our military
machine, the wholly unwarrented cut-backs in
military strength in the face of Russia's dramatically
improved offensive capability, and the failure to
develop the A.B.M. program after the bruising
Senate victory. Fatuous summitry would have been
inevitable, though the sight of an American
President fawning on unfriendly Chinese is no more
pleasant for that.
Sales of strategic equipment to hostile countries,
such as the truck plant to Russia, would have
occurred, and we would certainly have been bored
by tedious and totally misleading nonsense about a
"Generation of Peace." All this we would have had
to swallow from a foolish Democrat openly elected
— but to tolerate these blunders on the part of a
Republican whose election platform was the
negation of these policies is impossible. John
Ashbrook's candidacy in the California primary
gives us a chance to protest these betrayals.
Republicans are reasonable people — perhaps,
that is why our election record is so poor. Support
for Nationalist China, the protection of the
non-Communist world, belief in military
preparedness and a reasonably dignified stance for
our country, faith in the free enterprise system and
the value of individual freedom and opportunity —
all are, indeed, dear to our hearts. The question
John Ashbrook asks, as must any thinking
Republican, is what benefit has been derived by
these retreats and surrenders. Only by a solid vote
for John Ashbrook can this exploitation of
Republican patience be brought to an end.
