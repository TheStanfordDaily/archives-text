## Ill-Gotten American Gains? 
### 
i lewis h. aann

According to a widely current academic orthodoxy, American
"neocolonialism" derives its wealth above all from capital investment
in the "Third World", where land, labor and raw materials are said to
be cheaper and labor costs lower than in the more developed
countries. American prosperity thus supposedly derives from the
ill-gotten gains obtained from the exploitation of Asia and Africa,
whose surplus wealth in turn is used to "buy off" the white American
workers.
I don't profess to be a professional economist or a specialist on
international investment. But these are the figures which I derive from
the Encyclopedia Britannica (1972 Yearbook). According to their
statistics, derived from the UN, the US Department of Commerce, and
similar sources, the National Income of the US in 1970 amounted to
some $801 billion. Total American investment abroad amounted to
about $78 billion, that is to say less than one tenth of the US total
national income.
But in turn only a small proportion of America's foreign
investment was placed in Asia or in Africa. American investments in
the entire African continent amounted to just under $3.5 billion. The
total value of American investment in Africa and Asia together stood
at just over $9 billion, or only about 11 percent of America's total
foreign investment.
Profits
As regards profits, the total profits repatriated from abroad to the
US in 1970 amounted to about $6 billion that is to say considerably
less than 1 percent of the total National Income.
As regards Africa, the total American profits repatriated in 1970
from the entire continent amounted to no more than 680 million
dollars. (To put these figures into their American context, the
Americans spent a great deal more than this amount alone on the
University of California system, one of many giant academic systems.
In 1970 the Americans, to give another example, disbursed $72.4
billion alone on "clothing, accessories and personal care", that is to
say nearly as much as the total value of all their foreign investments
together.)
As regards the direction of American investments, Great Britain —
another "white," developed capitalist country — by 1970 had
absorbed nearly as much American capital as the whole of Africa and
Asia put together. (In 1970 the total value of American investments in
the United Kingdom stood at $8 billion, which was more than twice
the value of American investments in the whole of Africa.)
Investments
Not that the British and other Europeans had any reason to
complain. In 1970 foreigners (mainly Europeans) had invested a total
of more than $3 billion in the US. Foreign investment in the US was
thus far more extensive than American investment in the EEC which
amounted to $1.2 billion or so. This is a useful point to remember
when considering the views of European romantics who profess to
bewail the "Americanization of Europe."
The golden era of British investment in the United States was the
nineteenth century when America derived the bulk of its foreign
capital (and also a very large number of immigrants) from Great
Britain. For all the fashionable polemics against the supposed evils of
foreign lending, modern America, Australia or Canada could hardly
have developed in their present form without the tremendous influx
of European (mainly British) capital, which financed railways, port

installations, ranches, factories, and a host of other enterprises.
I might add that available statistics concerning European capital
investment overseas (such as those in Herbert Feis, Europe the World's
Banker, 1870-1914.. . Yale University Press, 1930) do not in the
least square with Leninist interpretations concerning the nature of late
nineteenth-century Western imperialism.
Misconception
For instance, contrary to a widely-held misconception, the most
important recipients of British capital during the heyday of British
imperialism were not the tropical and subtropical parts of the world,
where the British built their African empire. British capital above all
went to the areas of white settlement, especially the US.
By 1911 the British thus had invested more than twenty times as
much money in the United States as in West Africa. Canada on the
one hand, Australia and New Zealand on the other, each had absorbed
more capital than the whole of India. (To be exact, by 1911, the
British had invested a total of about L6BB million in the US; L 379
million in Australia and New Zealand; L 372 million in Canada and
Newfoundland; L 365 million in India and Ceylon; and L 29 million in
West Africa. (Source: George Paish, Great Britain's Foreign
Investments in individual Colonial and Foreign Countries", Journal of
the Royal Statistical Society, LXXIV, Part 2, January 1911, p.
167-187).
When SWOPSI holds its next session on imperialism, the
participants might perhaps be interested in discussing the implications
of these figures.
