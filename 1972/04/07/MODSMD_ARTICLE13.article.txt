Course Review
Sometimes it is difficult for the
average student to know when he
is being told the truth, or when he
is being led down the proverbial
garden path. Campaigns seem to
be that kind of a time. Two major
slates have now spoken of the
need for an independent course
review run by and for students.
Well kids, you needn't worry any
more.
Last fall, the Council of
Presidents set up the ASSU
Committee on Education. This
small but dedicated group of
people took it upon themselves to
create a student run course review
with their bare hands. The
procedure was arduous.
During the beginning of their
work, an article was published in
the Daily asking for additional
help from the rest of the student
body. Although the response was
not exactly overwhelming, they
continued to work. They set up a
system of random sampling, and
proceeded to poll students about
their courses.
A telephone poll was
conducted because of lack of
funds for a mailing. Each of the
five students in the group spent
many hours a week calling and
tallying, and eventually writing a
comprehensive article on each
course reviewed.
Finally, at the end of winter
quarter, the review was finished.
It was dubbed the Guerilla, and
sent on its ways to residence
staffers, the AIC, UGLI,
Undergraduate studies office, and
given to people who had worked
on it for six long mongths. The
Guerrilla was announced in a
Daily article at the end of winter
quarter.
This quarter, the students have
begun to seek additional funding
for their project. Major
reorganization of the staffing is
anticipated. The Dean of Students
office student initiative fund will

provide money for mailing, and
will review other needs with the
submission of an itemized budget.
The group will be meeting
Wednesday, April 11, at 3 p.m. in
the ASSU, and any interested
student is urged to attend.

The union question on the
campus is constantly being
brought up and rightly so, since at
this time we finally have a say in
whether we have representation or
not.
Jan Sutter's article on the
position of USE sounds very
much like a 49ers fan of years ago
after a dissappointing season
saying, "wait till next year."
I feel that the time to build is
now, not next year. Both USE
and CSEA-SEA have served the
workers of Stanford, and both
groups have done a credible job
considering the University policies
they had to work with.
However, the time for
disorganized chaos has passed. Mr.
Sutter said that USE is a
cross-section of all viewpoints,
from one extreme to another,
with everyone working toward
different goals. It is important
that we group together behind

one set of goals — better wages,
better working conditions, and
better benefits. This requires a
strong organization that has the
experience in negotiating for the
goals for which we strive.
As long as we, Stanford
employees, stay divided into small
groups of workers we will remain
ineffective, and the University will
have defeated us in our fight, for
bargaining power.
Next year may be too late. We
must bring about a change. We
now have an opportunity to voice
our support of a labor
organization on campus — an
organization that will represent us
and help us through these hard
times we are experiencing. This
union is the Teamsters. We will all
be losers if we do not vote for the
union on April 19.

Response
This is one faculty member's
response to Steve Downey's
incredibly bogus explanation of
why the Academic Council refuses
to sit placidly while SRM
members harangue us at their
pleasure. I think it is important
for the whole campus community
that some response to his absurd
tirade be printed. In my opinion,
the real reasons why the faculty

repudiates seizure of the podium
at Academic Council meetings by
the SRM are far simpler than Mr.
Downey supposes.
Faculty members, like people
everywhere, are subject to varied
pressures, for good and ill alike,
and each must chart a personal
course with regard to the myriad
influences that affect the process
of living. On one day each
quarter, however, we go if we
wish to Academic Council
meeting deliberately
unencumbered by rank or
position or circumstance of any
kind, except for the inherent fact
that we are all faculty members
here.
In this setting, if I may voice
now my own feeling, I am willing
to be persuaded how to vote, but
not instructed in that exercise by
anyone; I am prepared to vote on
an issue if I wish, but I will not
respond to an order or a demand
that I vote; and I will not accept
the presumed authority of a
captured podium.
In matters both large and
small, history tells us clearly what
can be done and what cannot be
done with a free assembly. A free
assembly can be pre-empted, it
can be suppressed, it can be
disrupted. In a hundred ways can
it be frustrated, and it also can be
influenced honestly, but if it is
truly free it cannot be compelled
to take actions except of its own
will. The SRM would do well to
ponder this truth, for what they
essay in their abrasively boisterous
invasions is pure Gilbert-and-
Sullivan: comic farce in the sense
of charade or logical impossibility.
If the Academic Council places
itself under the intellectual,
moral, or physical command of
any intruding group of any
description or persuasion, then it
has no valid excuse to meet or
vote at all.

Response
This is one faculty member's
response to Steve Downey's
incredibly bogus explanation of
why the Academic Council refuses
to sit placidly while SRM
members harangue us at their
pleasure. I think it is important
for the whole campus community
that some response to his absurd
tirade be printed. In my opinion,
the real reasons why the faculty

repudiates seizure of the podium
at Academic Council meetings by
the SRM are far simpler than Mr.
Downey supposes.
Faculty members, like people
everywhere, are subject to varied
pressures, for good and ill alike,
and each must chart a personal
course with regard to the myriad
influences that affect the process
of living. On one day each
quarter, however, we go if we
wish to Academic Council
meeting deliberately
unencumbered by rank or
position or circumstance of any
kind, except for the inherent fact
that we are all faculty members
here.
In this setting, if I may voice
now my own feeling, I am willing
to be persuaded how to vote, but
not instructed in that exercise by
anyone; I am prepared to vote on
an issue if I wish, but I will not
respond to an order or a demand
that I vote; and I will not accept
the presumed authority of a
captured podium.
In matters both large and
small, history tells us clearly what
can be done and what cannot be
done with a free assembly. A free
assembly can be pre-empted, it
can be suppressed, it can be
disrupted. In a hundred ways can
it be frustrated, and it also can be
influenced honestly, but if it is
truly free it cannot be compelled
to take actions except of its own
will. The SRM would do well to
ponder this truth, for what they
essay in their abrasively boisterous
invasions is pure Gilbert-and-
Sullivan: comic farce in the sense
of charade or logical impossibility.
If the Academic Council places
itself under the intellectual,
moral, or physical command of
any intruding group of any
description or persuasion, then it
has no valid excuse to meet or
vote at all.

Course Review
Sometimes it is difficult for the
average student to know when he
is being told the truth, or when he
is being led down the proverbial
garden path. Campaigns seem to
be that kind of a time. Two major
slates have now spoken of the
need for an independent course
review run by and for students.
Well kids, you needn't worry any
more.
Last fall, the Council of
Presidents set up the ASSU
Committee on Education. This
small but dedicated group of
people took it upon themselves to
create a student run course review
with their bare hands. The
procedure was arduous.
During the beginning of their
work, an article was published in
the Daily asking for additional
help from the rest of the student
body. Although the response was
not exactly overwhelming, they
continued to work. They set up a
system of random sampling, and
proceeded to poll students about
their courses.
A telephone poll was
conducted because of lack of
funds for a mailing. Each of the
five students in the group spent
many hours a week calling and
tallying, and eventually writing a
comprehensive article on each
course reviewed.
Finally, at the end of winter
quarter, the review was finished.
It was dubbed the Guerilla, and
sent on its ways to residence
staffers, the AIC, UGLI,
Undergraduate studies office, and
given to people who had worked
on it for six long mongths. The
Guerrilla was announced in a
Daily article at the end of winter
quarter.
This quarter, the students have
begun to seek additional funding
for their project. Major
reorganization of the staffing is
anticipated. The Dean of Students
office student initiative fund will

provide money for mailing, and
will review other needs with the
submission of an itemized budget.
The group will be meeting
Wednesday, April 11, at 3 p.m. in
the ASSU, and any interested
student is urged to attend.

Teamsters
The union question on the
campus is constantly being
brought up and rightly so, since at
this time we finally have a say in
whether we have representation or
not.
Jan Sutter's article on the
position of USE sounds very
much like a 49ers fan of years ago
after a dissappointing season
saying, "wait till next year."
I feel that the time to build is
now, not next year. Both USE
and CSEA-SEA have served the
workers of Stanford, and both
groups have done a credible job
considering the University policies
they had to work with.
However, the time for
disorganized chaos has passed. Mr.
Sutter said that USE is a
cross-section of all viewpoints,
from one extreme to another,
with everyone working toward
different goals. It is important
that we group together behind

one set of goals — better wages,
better working conditions, and
better benefits. This requires a
strong organization that has the
experience in negotiating for the
goals for which we strive.
As long as we, Stanford
employees, stay divided into small
groups of workers we will remain
ineffective, and the University will
have defeated us in our fight, for
bargaining power.
Next year may be too late. We
must bring about a change. We
now have an opportunity to voice
our support of a labor
organization on campus — an
organization that will represent us
and help us through these hard
times we are experiencing. This

many hours a week calling and
tallying, and eventually writing a
comprehensive article on each
course reviewed.
Finally, at the end of winter
quarter, the review was finished.
It was dubbed the Guerilla, and
sent on its ways to residence
staffers, the AIC, UGLI,
Undergraduate studies office, and
given to people who had worked
on it for six long mongths. The
Guerrilla was announced in a
Daily article at the end of winter
quarter.
This quarter, the students have
begun to seek additional funding
for their project. Major
reorganization of the staffing is
anticipated. The Dean of Students
office student initiative fund will

provide money for mailing, and
will review other needs with the
submission of an itemized budget.
The group will be meeting
Wednesday, April 11, at 3 p.m. in
the ASSU, and any interested
student is urged to attend.

The union question on the
campus is constantly being
brought up and rightly so, since at
this time we finally have a say in
whether we have representation or
not.
Jan Sutter's article on the
position of USE sounds very
much like a 49ers fan of years ago
after a dissappointing season
saying, "wait till next year."
I feel that the time to build is
now, not next year. Both USE
and CSEA-SEA have served the
workers of Stanford, and both
groups have done a credible job
considering the University policies
they had to work with.
However, the time for
disorganized chaos has passed. Mr.
Sutter said that USE is a
cross-section of all viewpoints,
from one extreme to another,
with everyone working toward
different goals. It is important
that we group together behind

one set of goals — better wages,
better working conditions, and
better benefits. This requires a
strong organization that has the
experience in negotiating for the
goals for which we strive.
As long as we, Stanford
employees, stay divided into small
groups of workers we will remain
ineffective, and the University will
have defeated us in our fight, for
bargaining power.
Next year may be too late. We
must bring about a change. We
now have an opportunity to voice
our support of a labor
organization on campus — an
organization that will represent us
and help us through these hard
times we are experiencing. This
union is the Teamsters. We will all
be losers if we do not vote for the
union on April 19.

Response
This is one faculty member's
response to Steve Downey's
incredibly bogus explanation of
why the Academic Council refuses
to sit placidly while SRM
members harangue us at their
pleasure. I think it is important
for the whole campus community
that some response to his absurd
tirade be printed. In my opinion,
the real reasons why the faculty

repudiates seizure of the podium
at Academic Council meetings by
the SRM are far simpler than Mr.
Downey supposes.
Faculty members, like people
everywhere, are subject to varied
pressures, for good and ill alike,
and each must chart a personal
course with regard to the myriad
influences that affect the process
of living. On one day each
quarter, however, we go if we
wish to Academic Council
meeting deliberately
unencumbered by rank or
position or circumstance of any
kind, except for the inherent fact
that we are all faculty members
here.
In this setting, if I may voice
now my own feeling, I am willing
to be persuaded how to vote, but
not instructed in that exercise by
anyone; I am prepared to vote on
an issue if I wish, but I will not
respond to an order or a demand
that I vote; and I will not accept
the presumed authority of a
captured podium.
In matters both large and
small, history tells us clearly what
can be done and what cannot be
done with a free assembly. A free
assembly can be pre-empted, it
can be suppressed, it can be
disrupted. In a hundred ways can
it be frustrated, and it also can be
influenced honestly, but if it is
truly free it cannot be compelled
to take actions except of its own
will. The SRM would do well to
ponder this truth, for what they
essay in their abrasively boisterous
invasions is pure Gilbert-and-
Sullivan: comic farce in the sense
of charade or logical impossibility.
If the Academic Council places
itself under the intellectual,
moral, or physical command of
any intruding group of any
description or persuasion, then it
has no valid excuse to meet or
vote at all.

Course Review
Sometimes it is difficult for the
average student to know when he
is being told the truth, or when he
is being led down the proverbial
garden path. Campaigns seem to
be that kind of a time. Two major
slates have now spoken of the
need for an independent course
review run by and for students.
Well kids, you needn't worry any
more.
Last fall, the Council of
Presidents set up the ASSU
Committee on Education. This
small but dedicated group of
people took it upon themselves to
create a student run course review
with their bare hands. The
procedure was arduous.
During the beginning of their
work, an article was published in
the Daily asking for additional
help from the rest of the student
body. Although the response was
not exactly overwhelming, they
continued to work. They set up a
system of random sampling, and
proceeded to poll students about
their courses.
A telephone poll was
conducted because of lack of
funds for a mailing. Each of the
five students in the group spent
many hours a week calling and
tallying, and eventually writing a
comprehensive article on each
course reviewed.
Finally, at the end of winter
quarter, the review was finished.
It was dubbed the Guerilla, and
sent on its ways to residence
staffers, the AIC, UGLI,
Undergraduate studies office, and
given to people who had worked
on it for six long mongths. The
Guerrilla was announced in a
Daily article at the end of winter
quarter.
This quarter, the students have
begun to seek additional funding
for their project. Major

office student initiative fund will

will review other needs with the
submission of an itemized budget.
The group will be meeting
