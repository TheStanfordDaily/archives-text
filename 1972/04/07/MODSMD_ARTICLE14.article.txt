## A 						Case Of Hyperbole 
### 
Douglas alien

I am compelled out of basic common sense to
respond to Ms. Hyland's Daily article of March 30
entitled "Shockley's Ideas Widespread." This
response is not intended by any means as a defense
of Prof. Shockley or his theories but only as a
strong criticism of Ms. Hyland's article. Taken in its
entirety, that article is an exemplary case of radical
hyperbole.
In the simplest terms possible, it lacked clear
focus because it contained too many unconnected
ideas. The article was both unconvincing and
careless in content. With all due respect to logic, not
to mention Prof. Shockley or the late Gregory
White, her feverish article must be laid to rest.
Through an ingenuous scheme of patchwork
reasoning, Ms. Hyland unskillfully and imprudently
linked Shockley to numerous social ills, the most
heinous of which was the killing of a black youth.
To her credit, she wisely balked from unequivocally
stating that there was or could be a direct
connection between Shockley and the killing of that
youth. However, the offensive implications of her
article go clearly beyond the pale of warranted or
needed criticism of either Shockley or his theory
and tend to edge dangerously on malicious libel.
Ms. Hyland proceeded tenuously along a logical
tightrope making the following assumptions:
Assumptions
That a white police officer, Bringhurst, killed a
black youth and is therefore "directly guilty" of
murder, this fact never having been established
legally. This is false assumption number one.
That Bringhurst's act was motivated by a racist
belief that blacks are inferior to whites and "that
their lives are somehow of less value than a white
person's," this motive neither shown by a court nor
by Ms. Hyland. This is false assumption number
two.
That Bringhurst's racist motive is a widespread
racist belief and that his guilt therefore extends
beyond himself, although all the facts given by Ms.
Hyland indicated that Bringhurst's actions were
solely his own and that he alone was responsible for
the killing. This is false assumption number three.
That Shockley is a proponent of a racist theory
that incites racist action; that "Shockley's theories

and actions show that he holds black people in
contempt and wishes to see them exterminated.
Whether he carries out that extermination or
someone else does ... he is directly responsible for
the harm done to the lives of black people;" that
Bringhurst's actions and Shockley's theory share a
similar racist motive and therefore by extension
Shockley is in some sense responsible for White's
death.
This is false and very dangerous assumption
number four. And there were other false
assumptions and conclusions.
Although Ms. Hyland's article passes stylistic
scrutiny, it is pathetically evident that her thinking
lacks sound logical or legal reasoning. If she desired
to write an eulogy to Gregory White or to expose
the dubious facts of that tragic and apparently
irresponsible incident, then she should intelligently
and responsibly have done just that and no more.
But she did not. Instead she, like Bringhurst in his
impulsive actions, did not stop short of poor
judgment. As is too common the case today, Ms.
Hyland unfortunately overreacted and brought
Shockley's controversial theory to bear
incredulously on an isolated and definitely
unrelated incident.
Invalidity
If, on the other hand, she wished to discuss the
scientific invalidity of Shockley's genetic theoiy of
race and the possible moral, social, and political
implications of the same, then she should have done
just that and no more. But again she failed to
restrain herself at the very moment caution was
most desirable.
Just as she gathered the facts of the Gregory
White incident, arrogated to herself the combined
roles of judge, jury, and advocates, and rendered a
hasty verdict of guilty of murder, so has she in a like
sweep of irrationality condemned Shockley in her
kangaroo court of absurd logic. She should have
discussed one subject or the other, but never both as
if they were directly related.
Ms. Hyland's article is a spice box of urgent but
misplaced concerns. The article's folly is bad
reasoning. Its tragedy is destructive content.
