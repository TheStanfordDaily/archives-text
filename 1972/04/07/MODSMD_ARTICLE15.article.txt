# Faculty Wives: Who Are They?
## 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
Who is Mrs. Stanford
Professor?
She is intelligent, a college
graduate often with an advanced
degree. She is active: holding
down a steady job, working as an
artist, or involved in community
programs.
She is usually a mother, though
perhaps with grown children.
She is reasonably happy with
her life. Although she may be
looking unsuccessfully for a
challenging part-time job, she
claims to be "as liberated as 1
want to be."
But as far as students are
concerned, Mrs. Professor is
someone who serves cookies and
fruit punch at evening seminars.
Students have little contact with
faculty wives, yet these women
form a significant part of the
University community.
Faculty Women's Club
The Faculty Women's Club
considers 2300 women, all
narried to faculty or
idministrators, to be eligible for
membership. Of these, about 600
>elong to the club.
The club meets as a whole once

a month to hear a talk or a choral
group, to see a demonstration or a
fashion show.
"It's a typical women's club,"
said president Norma Waithman,
whose husband, Victor, is a SLAC
engineer and physicist. "We feel
it's relevant to today's complex
campus world to be sociable and
friendly."
Active Sections
Most of the club's activity goes
on in the 21 sections, where
participants concentrate on such
areas as writing, music,
needlepoint, language, bowling,
orientation for newcomers, and
social action.
The last section is the most
controversial, challenging the
"typical women's club" focus.
The social action group aids
foreign students, provides
weekend homes for harassed dorm
residents, and advises Escondido
Villagers, as well as surveying
health services and preparing a
booklet on Stanford history.
Nan Brand, a Stanford wife
since 1929, believes that the club
should remain primarily social.
She is an "emeritus wife," since
her husband Carl is an emeritus

professor of history.
New People
'There is an academic
relationship that they call activist.
But it doesn't really do the things
at hand," Nan Brand stated. "The
younger group doesn't know what
they're missing by not developing
strong relationships."
While she worries that in many
cases "new people do not become
part of the Stanford community,"
many club members feel the
newcomer's section is one of the
most important.
"It's a warm and friendly
group foi people who want to
meet other people," said Sidney
Brown, wife of religion professor
Robert McAfee Brown.
Club Changes
Jing Lyman, whose husband,
Richard, is president of the
University, agreed that the club
"serves a purpose for many
people."
A leading advocate of fair
housing, she has been one of the
catalysts for change toward social
activism. "Times had changed.
Lots of women who had needs
along this line were not being
spoken to along the lines of the

Faculty Women's Club,"
Stanford's "first lady" said.
She added, "We wanted to
update the club to reach out to
them."
Wives Lack Unity
While the women feel part of
the University community,, not all
feel a bond with their fellow
faculty wives. Some women prefer
not to be identified as a faculty
wife.
A few say that faculty wives
are too status-conscious,
concerned about who has tenure
and whose husband holds what
academic rank. Many women are
just too involved in outside
activities to worry about faculty
wifedom as a whole.
Others like Judy Carnoy
simply "prefer to be with
students." As a researcher at the
Pacific Studies Center and a
participant in radical campus
politics, she has more contact
with students than other women.
Yet many of her friends don't
realize that her husband Martin is
an associate professor of
education.
Nan Brand regrets the lack of a
sense of community among
younger wives. "I am very much a
part of the older community
which was a very solid unit," she
said. "We look after each other
and always have."
However, "You don't get to
know the young people. The
effort's not made, not responded
to, to make young people part of
the community."
More Student Contact
Many faculty women regret
their isolation from students,
particularly undergraduates.
"I'd like much more student
contact," Annie Mae Leland said.
She and her husband Havne, an
assistant professor of economics,
have eaten in dorms and held
open houses, but she feels this
encourages only superficial
communication.
However she agreed with
Sidney Brown that "the overseas
campus is a marvelous experience
that continues when you come
back."
Faculty Ghetto
The "faculty ghetto" is home
for many University families.
"It's a delightful segregated
life," noted Louise Wright, a
ghetto-dweller since 1957.. "It's
too easy to be completely
unaware of the problems of life."
She is married to history
professor Gordon Wright, now
associate dean of humanities and
sciences. The Wrights were leery
of living in a company town when
they first came to Stanford, but
financial considerations led them
to build a house on San Francisco
Court.
They found neighbors from
diverse academic fields and "a lot
of kids and dogs." The neighbors
"met and planted gardens
together," Louise Wright
remembered.

Annie Mae Leland argued that
the faculty ghetto is as diversified
as the engineer's ghetto in Palo
Alto and the surrounding
middle-class communities. "I
don't feel I'm caught in a web as
far as where I live," she said.
Good Neighbors
"It was a real sense of relief for
me to come to an area where my
neighbors shared my interests,"
Jing Lyman declared, adding,
"But we'd be better off if our kids
were exposed to more diversity.
Sidney Brown especially enjoys
living with University people
because, "I love seeing people
really involved in what they care
about, being paid for something
they really love to do."
And according to Nan Brand, it
is "not a ghetto by any
definition." She is proud to have
lived 37 years in the same house
on Stanford land. "We worked
like fury to keep it up. We didn't
sit around and psychologize about
it."
She is proud that she has no
hired help. "I do all my own
housework. We share our home
with a great many people."
Active Women
The caricature of the
dissatisfied faculty wife guzzling
morning martinis in her lavish
house on the hill is far from
reality.
Officially, Louise Wright is a
housewife. But she is also a
co-chairwoman of the social
action section of the Faculty
Women's Club, an incredibly
active woman full of enthusiasm
for her projects.
She is involved in the League
of Women Voters, which is now
analyzing regional administration
of public services and problems of
citv finances. And in Stanford
Community. Women for Peace, in
a study of child care needs at the
University, in political
maneuverings to insure a

community center for Escondido
Village.
Liberal Lady
This year she is concentrating
her energies on supporting The
Center for Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgery in Saigon.
A "liberal lady," but an
effective one, she believes that the
University community needs to
have a great deal more discussion
of lifestyles. "We should be
discussing what kind of lives we
really want," she said.
So she got together with a
dozen friends last quarter who
had been involved in child care
research and discussed just that.
The group is developing a project
to increase visibility of
"outstanding women in all fields
of activities."

They hope to expose
undergraduate women to
successful lifestyle options,
perhaps sponsoring panel
discussion, among community
women.
"A woman who is working
with a high degree of success in
her chosen field and if married
leads a life that is mutually
satisfying to her husband and
children" was defined as
"outstanding."
The group developed a long list
covering 14 career categories
naming Stanford women whom
they felt exhibited these qualities.
"You don't have to be a
college professor to be
successful," Louise Wright
emphasized. Few students, male
or female, are aware of the
activities and achievements of
faculty wives.
Women's Careers
Dr. Wolfgang Panofsky is well
known as the director of SLAC.
Adele Panofsky is a leader of
Mid-Peninsula Citizens for Fair
Mousing and active in Open Space.
Paul W. Berg teaches
mathematics. His wife, Dr. Judith
Nadell, M.D., is associate medical
director of Syndex Research.
Moses Abramowitz serves as
chairman of the economics
department. Carrie Abramowitz is
a painter and sculptor.
Fields of Involvement
William Miller is vice-president
and provost. Pat Miller directs the
Planned Parenthood organization
in Santa Clara County.
Besides the fields of
community involvement, research
science, art and administration,
the committee found faculty
wives in social work, business,
education, law, library work,
medicine, mental and physical
health, music, nursing, theater arts
and writing.
"Of course," Jing Lyman
observed, "there are a lot of
women devoted wholeheartedly
and effectively to supporting their
husbands."
