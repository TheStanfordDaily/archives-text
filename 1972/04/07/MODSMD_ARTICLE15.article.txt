# Faculty Wives: Who Are They?
## 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
Who is Mrs. Stanford
Professor?
She is intelligent, a college
graduate often with an advanced
degree. She is active: holding
down a steady job, working as an
artist, or involved in community
programs.
She is usually a mother, though
perhaps with grown children.
She is reasonably happy with
her life. Although she may be
looking unsuccessfully for a
challenging part-time job, she
claims to be "as liberated as 1
want to be."
But as far as students are
concerned, Mrs. Professor is
someone who serves cookies and
fruit punch at evening seminars.
Students have little contact with
faculty wives, yet these women
form a significant part of the
University community.
Faculty Women's Club
The Faculty Women's Club
considers 2300 women, all
narried to faculty or
idministrators, to be eligible for
membership. Of these, about 600
>elong to the club.
The club meets as a whole once

a month to hear a talk or a choral
group, to see a demonstration or a
fashion show.
"It's a typical women's club,"
said president Norma Waithman,
whose husband, Victor, is a SLAC
engineer and physicist. "We feel
it's relevant to today's complex
campus world to be sociable and
friendly."
Active Sections
Most of the club's activity goes
on in the 21 sections, where
participants concentrate on such
areas as writing, music,
needlepoint, language, bowling,
orientation for newcomers, and
social action.
The last section is the most
controversial, challenging the
"typical women's club" focus.
The social action group aids
foreign students, provides
weekend homes for harassed dorm
residents, and advises Escondido
Villagers, as well as surveying
health services and preparing a
booklet on Stanford history.
Nan Brand, a Stanford wife
since 1929, believes that the club
should remain primarily social.
She is an "emeritus wife," since
her husband Carl is an emeritus

professor of history.
New People
'There is an academic
relationship that they call activist.
But it doesn't really do the things
at hand," Nan Brand stated. "The
younger group doesn't know what
they're missing by not developing
strong relationships."
While she worries that in many
cases "new people do not become
part of the Stanford community,"
many club members feel the
newcomer's section is one of the
most important.
"It's a warm and friendly
group foi people who want to
meet other people," said Sidney
Brown, wife of religion professor
Robert McAfee Brown.
Club Changes
Jing Lyman, whose husband,
Richard, is president of the
University, agreed that the club
"serves a purpose for many
people."
A leading advocate of fair
housing, she has been one of the
catalysts for change toward social
activism. "Times had changed.
Lots of women who had needs
along this line were not being
spoken to along the lines of the

Faculty Women's Club,"
Stanford's "first lady" said.
She added, "We wanted to
update the club to reach out to
them."
Wives Lack Unity
While the women feel part of
the University community,, not all
feel a bond with their fellow
faculty wives. Some women prefer
not to be identified as a faculty
wife.
A few say that faculty wives
are too status-conscious,
concerned about who has tenure
and whose husband holds what
academic rank. Many women are
just too involved in outside
activities to worry about faculty
wifedom as a whole.
Others like Judy Carnoy
simply "prefer to be with
students." As a researcher at the
Pacific Studies Center and a
participant in radical campus
politics, she has more contact
with students than other women.
Yet many of her friends don't
realize that her husband Martin is
an associate professor of
education.
Nan Brand regrets the lack of a
sense of community among
younger wives. "I am very much a
part of the older community
which was a very solid unit," she
said. "We look after each other
and always have."
However, "You don't get to
know the young people. The
effort's not made, not responded
to, to make young people part of
the community."
More Student Contact
Many faculty women regret
their isolation from students,
particularly undergraduates.
"I'd like much more student
contact," Annie Mae Leland said.
She and her husband Havne, an
assistant professor of economics,
have eaten in dorms and held
open houses, but she feels this
encourages only superficial
communication.
However she agreed with
Sidney Brown that "the overseas
campus is a marvelous experience
that continues when you come
back."
Faculty Ghetto
The "faculty ghetto" is home
for many University families.
"It's a delightful segregated
life," noted Louise Wright, a
ghetto-dweller since 1957.. "It's
too easy to be completely
unaware of the problems of life."
She is married to history
professor Gordon Wright, now
associate dean of humanities and
sciences. The Wrights were leery
of living in a company town when
they first came to Stanford, but
financial considerations led them
to build a house on San Francisco
Court.
They found neighbors from
diverse academic fields and "a lot
of kids and dogs." The neighbors
"met and planted gardens
together," Louise Wright
remembered.

Annie Mae Leland argued that
the faculty ghetto is as diversified
as the engineer's ghetto in Palo
Alto and the surrounding
middle-class communities. "I
don't feel I'm caught in a web as
far as where I live," she said.
Good Neighbors
"It was a real sense of relief for
me to come to an area where my
neighbors shared my interests,"
Jing Lyman declared, adding,
"But we'd be better off if our kids
were exposed to more diversity.
Sidney Brown especially enjoys
living with University people
because, "I love seeing people
really involved in what they care
about, being paid for something
they really love to do."
And according to Nan Brand, it
is "not a ghetto by any
definition." She is proud to have
lived 37 years in the same house
on Stanford land. "We worked
like fury to keep it up. We didn't
sit around and psychologize about
it."
She is proud that she has no
hired help. "I do all my own
housework. We share our home
with a great many people."
Active Women
The caricature of the
dissatisfied faculty wife guzzling
morning martinis in her lavish
house on the hill is far from
reality.
Officially, Louise Wright is a
housewife. But she is also a
co-chairwoman of the social
action section of the Faculty
Women's Club, an incredibly
active woman full of enthusiasm
for her projects.
She is involved in the League
of Women Voters, which is now
analyzing regional administration
of public services and problems of
citv finances. And in Stanford
Community. Women for Peace, in
a study of child care needs at the
University, in political
maneuverings to insure a

community center for Escondido
Village.
Liberal Lady
This year she is concentrating
her energies on supporting The
Center for Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgery in Saigon.
A "liberal lady," but an
effective one, she believes that the
University community needs to
have a great deal more discussion
of lifestyles. "We should be
discussing what kind of lives we
really want," she said.
So she got together with a
dozen friends last quarter who
had been involved in child care
research and discussed just that.
The group is developing a project
to increase visibility of
"outstanding women in all fields
of activities."

They hope to expose
undergraduate women to
successful lifestyle options,
perhaps sponsoring panel
discussion, among community
women.
"A woman who is working
with a high degree of success in
her chosen field and if married
leads a life that is mutually
satisfying to her husband and
children" was defined as
"outstanding."
The group developed a long list
covering 14 career categories
naming Stanford women whom
they felt exhibited these qualities.
"You don't have to be a
college professor to be
successful," Louise Wright
emphasized. Few students, male
or female, are aware of the
activities and achievements of
faculty wives.
Women's Careers
Dr. Wolfgang Panofsky is well
known as the director of SLAC.
Adele Panofsky is a leader of
Mid-Peninsula Citizens for Fair
Mousing and active in Open Space.
Paul W. Berg teaches
mathematics. His wife, Dr. Judith
Nadell, M.D., is associate medical
director of Syndex Research.
Moses Abramowitz serves as
chairman of the economics
department. Carrie Abramowitz is
a painter and sculptor.
Fields of Involvement
William Miller is vice-president
and provost. Pat Miller directs the
Planned Parenthood organization
in Santa Clara County.
Besides the fields of
community involvement, research
science, art and administration,
the committee found faculty
wives in social work, business,
education, law, library work,
medicine, mental and physical
health, music, nursing, theater arts
and writing.
"Of course," Jing Lyman
observed, "there are a lot of
women devoted wholeheartedly
and effectively to supporting their
husbands."
Women who want to work

encounter serious limitations.
Many are looking for a meaningful
part-time job, but these are very
hard to find.
Annie Mae Leland, who is
chairwoman of the continuing
education and job opportunities
section of the Women's Club,
holds a B.A. in English literature
and a M.A. in elementary
education, both from Radcliffe.
She is "almost 30," the mother of
a four year old girl and a two year
old boy.
"There is a view of women that
we are dilettantes. It's true, but
give us an interesting part-time
job, use our abilities, and we'll
show what we can do," she
declared. "Why not stop and start
until somebody gives me
something valuable to do?"
Her thirty woman group is
working to expose "unwitting
discrimination" in the University.
They feel their influence may be
felt beyond Stanford as living
patterns change.
The section has found that
women who take time out to raise
a family may discover that they
have been out of the work force
too long, their skills are out of
date, perhaps they are
"over-qualified" for the jobs
available. They just can't get
started.

Dr. Martha White is conducting
a human recycling program called
"Next Step" to give wnm
insight into themselves.
"You'd be amazed at how
unconfident a 30-35 year old
woman can be," Annie Mae
Leland said. "You have to shove
them into it. But they all want to
do something."
Continuing Education
Several years ago the Women's
Club published booklets on
"Going Into Labor" and
"Continuing Education" which
sold a total of 1700 copies. Yvettc
Gurley, wife of popular
economics professor John Gurley,
worked on continuing education,
but she feels that "there aren't a
tremendous number of faculty
wives who are interested in this."
Stanford has been reluctant to
admit women over 30 for work on
advanced degrees and universities
are just beginning to allow
part-time graduate work.
Although ten wives were
admitted to graduate schools on a
special basis, the early enthusiasm
has died down.
Child Care
Lack of adequate child care is
another factor that ties women to
the home, though some wives
have domestic help. A child care
report directed by Ann Miner,
special assistant to the president,

was scheduled to come out by the
end of March.
"I don't think the trend wtll
turn around as far as women
wanting to work," Louise Wright
said, noting that mothers who do
not hold paying jobs can also
benefit from child care facilities.
In the past faculty wives have
often exchanged babysitting. "We
didn't have nursery schools, but
we traded our children," Nan
Brand, mother of three, recalled.
Jing Lyman, Louise Wright and
two other mothers set up a
mini-day care center for their four
sons.
Take Kids Along
Or Louise Wright would
"bundle the kids up and take
them to meetings." As mother of
five sons, she lived for 20 years
with at least one pre-school child.
A journalism and economics
major at the University of Oregon,
she worked as a journalist before
marriage. However she does not
regret leaving her career.
Before her marriage, "I had
never not worked," she said.
"How frivolous, how utterly
gorgeous to do what I wanted to
do."
A native of France, Annie Mae
Leland loves to cook and has
taught French cooking. Her dream
job would be teaching in a test
kitchen.

She taught elementary school
for a while and wishes she hadn't
stopped. "I'd like to have a job so
I'd stop doing so many things,"
she said.
Although 7 the women's
liberation movement has attacked
traditional roles, Nan Brand insists
that "a homemaker's life is so
free. Much freer than any kind of
job."
She stated, "I have not been
cramped in any way, shape or
form. Oh no, my life is infinitely
richer." She added, "You young
people just don't know what
you're missing. There's no
frustration at all."
'It Can Be Overcome'
While Annie Mae Leland feels
that working is not necessarily a
solution, she observed, "I
understand what a male chauvinist
pig is, but I think it can be
overcome."
She doesn't feel enslaved and
thinks "you don't have to be the
same to be equal," but believes
that "man and wife ought to lead
more complementary lives."
Although she sympathizes with
the women's liberation
movement, Louise Wright feels it
is taking the wrong tack. "We
need human liberation," she said.
Free Soul
"Women are equipped to do
anything men can do
intellectually," she went on.
Believing that "it's good for a
woman to have a life outside her
husband's life," she has never felt
limited by being a wife and
mother. "I'm one of the freest
souls on earth."
"But use of freedom demands
imagination and creativity,"
Louise Wright emphasized. "A lot
of people aren't free," she
admitted. "Some women let
themselves be caught."
Like other wives, she said, "I
couldn't stand me if I were any
more liberated."
Judy Camoy, a mother of two,
is one of the few who will admit
she is "certainly a supporter" of
women's liberation. "I've changed
a lot of my attitudes and things
like that," she said.
However she is on the
periphery of the movement. A
political activist, she admitted, "I
get tired of going to so many
meetings."
Several women pointed out
that faculty wives have an
advantage over other wives
because academic work hours are
so flexible.

"It made it possible for Dick
and me to develop our own
interests, supporting each other,"
Jing Lyman explained. She
revealed that the future president
babysat and helped with
housework during his free hours.
Husbands Rank High
Husbands rank high in priority,
no matter how liberated the wife.
"Gordon has been a marvelous
man to be married to," Louise
Wright said.
"Picking the right man is the
first step," advised Nan Brand.
"And that doesn't mean someone
you can walk over."
Are faculty wives happy?
"Women who can't find
fulfillment by themselves don't
stay happy faculty wives," Louise
Wright said. "They don't stay
married very long."
As Happy As Most
Judy Carnoy said, "We're
probably as happy as most
Americans. Most aren't very
happy."
"Some of the younger wives
might be unhappy," Nan Brand
said. "Because they're not of use
in the community, using their
energy in volunteer or paid
work."
Jing Lyman believed that only
a few wives are dissatisfied and
this occurs in any community. "I

don't think it needs to happen,"
she said.
"There is enough good music,
art, theater, reading groups; you
can audit classes. I don't think
this unhappiness is the fault of the
community as such."
Impressive, Unappreciated
On the whole, Stanford's
faculty wives are an impressive
but underappreciated group. They
are making very real contributions
to the University community and

the larger society.
Many Stanford women marry
Stanford men, and many of those
men go through graduate school
and become university professors.
Women students who wish to
judge the success or failure of
faculty wives must remember that
they are not sociology subjects or
case histories in The Woman's
Struggle.
They are the people we may
become.
