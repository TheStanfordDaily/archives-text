# Molina Dancers Give Lively Show
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
On Saturday night, Jose Molina's Bailes Espanoles performed the
last of two performances in the Bay Area at the Masonic Auditorium
in San Francisco.
For me, it was a really enjoyable introduction to the art of
flamenco dancing. The music provided a vibrant combination of live
flamenco guitar music, flamenco singing and piano. The whole
performance emanated a professional and technically brilliant attitude
towards dance, all the way from the costumes to the very timing and
duration of each dance.
The performance consisted of twelve short dances and one solo
guitar performance.
The first dance was one of the most impressive of the evening. It
was a gay dance in the style and elegance of eighteenth century
Madrid. We were witness to a formalized ritual dance of men and
women dancing together at times and at other times separate from
each other. The strongest parts of the dance were at the beginning and
the end, when the three male dancers, Luis Montero, Manolo Rivera
and Victor Romero, danced in a trio. The agility of their movement
and bearing lived up to all I had ever heard about the art of flamenco
dancing.
Fascinating Dancer
In the second dance, Jose Molina danced a solo, "Vida Breve,"
from the opera of the same name. In this dance, Molina proved his
exceptional ability as a performer. His use of castinets provided a
distinct rhythm which complemented and contrasted with the music
provided by the guitarists and by the pianist.
The most fascinating dancer for me was Luis Montero, who danced
a solo called "Leyenda" soon after Molina's dance. With total control
of all his faculties, Montero performed a series of calm staid twirls. His
isolated hand gestures added a strange subtlety to the clean
straightforward lines of his movement.
At the end, Montero did something which brought the audience to
loud applause. He was stamping his feet, one after the other on the
ground so quickly that his legs seemed blurred in a whirlwind of
movement. Then, little by little, he decreased the distance of his feet
from the ground until his feet seemed to clatter against the ground
like chattering teeth. The movement was simultaneously so tiny and
rapid that Montero for a moment lost all his human qualities and
became a total vehicle for movement.
The sixth dance, "Fantasia," was set to Ravel's "Bolero," and as
the program states, "it is an exciting fantasy of color and movement
which builds with the music to a frenzied climax." At this "climax,"
the dancers began swirling in circles, women with skirts flying and the
men spinning like tops. There was so much commotion on stage that
the vibrations of stomping feet reached my seat in the eighth row!
Molina danced a second solo, "Cana," which showed the dramatic
and almost magical quality of Molina's dancing. This dance is a
"Jondo," a dance performed from"the inner depths of the soul."
Unfortunately the large impersonal auditorium did most harm of all
to this rather haunting solo, for it seemed to engulf Molina's "soulful
movement."
Lively Participation
Near the end of the evening, Francisco Espinosa, a virtuoso of
Spanish guitar, played pieces selected from his concert repertoire. The
agility of his plucking and the intricacy of rhythm and melody
brought Espinosa back for two encores. For awhile, I even wondered
whether he might "steal the show."
In the last dance, the whole company gathered onstage. While the
rest of the company sat and provided the "jaleo," or background
rhythms, the dancers rose one by one to perform a series of individual
dance movements.
Though the Masonic Auditorium is huge, the dancers still created
an electric link between performer and audience. This dance brought
many laughs and clapping from the audience as well as the traditional
"ole" that one could hear throughout the evening.
In fact, it was this very "link" between audience and performer
which made the evening so refreshing. All the way from the quiet of
the flamenco guitar to the feeling of vibrations under my seat from
the sound of stomping feetâ€”the performance ran the full gamut of
lively audience participation. Those who missed Molina's company
this year must catch them the next time around.
