# Classical Guitarist Performs Tonight
## 
### 
Classical guitarist, Michael
Lorimer, will perform tonight in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium at 8 p.m.
Among experts, Lorimer is
regarded as one of the two or
three leading classical guitarists of
the younger generation. He is a
protege of the great Andres
Segovia, whose enthusiasm for the
young artist has prompted him to
say: "I am certain that in a few
years his name will be respected
and esteemed in the United States
and abroad."
In the short time since the
great guitarist made this
statement, Lorimer's concert
appearances in Spain and
throughout North American have
already established him as a
highly-acclaimed artist.
Lorimer was born in Chicago
but reared in Los Angeles and
began his studies when he was ten.
His father, Walter, is an attorney
with an amateur's interest in
music. Walter Lorimer had bought
a guitar and had been taking
lessons in classical guitar at a local
high school when he brought
home a recording of Andres
Segovia playing J.S. Bach.
Young Michael was completely

taken by both the music and the
sound of the instrument. He had
always been attracted to the
sound of plucked instruments and
had heard or read about the harp,
harpsichord and lute. He found
the music of these instruments in
the Segovia recording and
immediately devoted himself to
learning to play the guitar.
Eventually Lorimer played for
Andres Segovia and was invited to
attend the master's classes in
Siena, Italy. He soon became one
of Segovia's favorite pupils and
spent six summers studying with
him.
Last season he gave thirty
concerts all over the country and
made his New York City debut in
March gaining critical acclaim and
a new following.
Lorimer has given classes
throughout the country as well
and teaches puitar when he is not
touring at the San Francisco
Conservatory of Music and at the
University of California at
Berkeley.
His performance tonight will
include works by John Dowland,
Johann Jakob Froberger, Johann
Sebastian Bach and Isaac Albeniz.
