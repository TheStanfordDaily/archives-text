# 'Sleuth' Presents A Lot Of Problems
## 
### DAVID W. WILLIAMS 
I didn't like the A.C.T. production of Anthony Shaffer's Sleuth
very much, but I would encourage anyone interested in "the problems
of today's theatre" to see it. The dialogue, a pretentious blend of
Wilde, James and Beerbohm needs to be cut drastically. Such cutting
would help the characters escape the cliches with which the author so
richly dresses them. There is hardly anything in the piece that is new.
It is in fact an inverted pastoral dialogue in high-Gothic drag. The
attempt to create a play of only two characters has been better
realized, most notably in Dutchman, hence even the most virtuostic
quality about this strange melodrama seems hackneyed and even
inept.
In the first act, Andrew Wyke, as played not very well by Ken
Ruta, entices his spendthrift wife's lover, as played fairly well by Peter
Donat, from London to his gothic house in Wiltshire, ostensibly to
talk about the "affair." Wyke, a writer of "classic" detective stories
convinces Milo Tindle, who is half Italian and one-quarter Jewish that
he really ought to steal his wife's jewels, sell them at a 25% loss to a
fence of his acquaintance in Amsterdam, and hand over the title to
the jewels to said fence, while Wyke gets the insurance money.
An Outraged Husband
That way Milo, who is poor, will be able to keep Margaurite, whom
Wyke apparently, on account of long suffering, detests. Furthermore
Wyke insists that Milo disguse himself as a clown in order to do the
thing right. Milo agress; once the room has been appropriately
disarranged and the safe blown up, the poor boy finds himself on the
wrong side of a revolver, facing what seems to be a thoroughly
outraged jealous husband who hates Jews, Italians, and Latin lovers
very much in particular. The gun goes off—curtain.
I shall not ruin the second act for those who like to be surprised,
but I will warn those of delicate sensibilities that there is more of the
same, and the language becomes utterly purple as the author indulges
himself in all the varieties of sadomasochism now in vogue. The play
pretends to be about the games the sickies play, but is really an
attempt on the part of a fairly talented playwright to cash in on the
current fashion for watching unhappy homosexuals and those who
might be happier if they "came out," do nasty things to each other in
the name of "the games" which "normal" people don't play. (At one
climactic moment, Milo tells Wyke that he knows Wyke can't make it
with his "mistress," so the old boy goes down on his knees and asks
Milo to live with him.)
Perverse Games
The games were very like those of The Boys in the Band, though
finally more perverse, and the fantasies rather like those of Hadrian
the Seventh, though a good deal less civilized, and the audience
enjoyed it tremendously; the players were given a quite spontaneous
standing ovation, while my friend and I attempted to find out what
we missed, and I'm afraid I don't think we missed very much. To call
such theatre prurient is to indulge in understatement, and I would
suggest that it is a rather striking example of what one shouldn't
bother typing if he calls himself a playwright.
In short, it's a really sensational play, kiddies, one without the
barest trace of a moral, and with a generous supply of what has been
done and overdone, but do see it. The scenery, as arranged by Robert
Blackman is just the maddest ever, and while the directing is sloppy,
the acting spotty—at the very least—and the language over-ripe, the
playwright does have promise . . .

richly dresses them. There is hardly anything in the piece that is new.
It is in fact an inverted pastoral dialogue in high-Gothic drag. The
attempt to create a play of only two characters has been better
realized, most notably in Dutchman, hence even the most virtuostic
quality about this strange melodrama seems hackneyed and even
inept.
In the first act, Andrew Wyke, as played not very well by Ken
Ruta, entices his spendthrift wife's lover, as played fairly well by Peter
Donat, from London to his gothic house in Wiltshire, ostensibly to
talk about the "affair." Wyke, a writer of "classic" detective stories
convinces Milo Tindle, who is half Italian and one-quarter Jewish that
he really ought to steal his wife's jewels, sell them at a 25% loss to a
fence of his acquaintance in Amsterdam, and hand over the title to
the jewels to said fence, while Wyke gets the insurance money.
An Outraged Husband
That way Milo, who is poor, will be able to keep Margaurite, whom
Wyke apparently, on account of long suffering, detests. Furthermore
Wyke insists that Milo disguse himself as a clown in order to do the
thing right. Milo agress; once the room has been appropriately
disarranged and the safe blown up, the poor boy finds himself on the
wrong side of a revolver, facing what seems to be a thoroughly
outraged jealous husband who hates Jews, Italians, and Latin lovers
very much in particular. The gun goes off—curtain.
I shall not ruin the second act for those who like to be surprised,
but I will warn those of delicate sensibilities that there is more of the
same, and the language becomes utterly purple as the author indulges
himself in all the varieties of sadomasochism now in vogue. The play
pretends to be about the games the sickies play, but is really an
attempt on the part of a fairly talented playwright to cash in on the
current fashion for watching unhappy homosexuals and those who
might be happier if they "came out," do nasty things to each other in
the name of "the games" which "normal" people don't play. (At one
climactic moment, Milo tells Wyke that he knows Wyke can't make it
with his "mistress," so the old boy goes down on his knees and asks
Milo to live with him.)
Perverse Games
The games were very like those of The Boys in the Band, though
finally more perverse, and the fantasies rather like those of Hadrian
the Seventh, though a good deal less civilized, and the audience
enjoyed it tremendously; the players were given a quite spontaneous
standing ovation, while my friend and I attempted to find out what
we missed, and I'm afraid I don't think we missed very much. To call
such theatre prurient is to indulge in understatement, and I would
suggest that it is a rather striking example of what one shouldn't
bother typing if he calls himself a playwright.
In short, it's a really sensational play, kiddies, one without the
barest trace of a moral, and with a generous supply of what has been
done and overdone, but do see it. The scenery, as arranged by Robert
Blackman is just the maddest ever, and while the directing is sloppy,
the acting spotty—at the very least—and the language over-ripe, the
playwright does have promise . . .
I didn't like the A.C.T. production of Anthony Shaffer's Sleuth
very much, but I would encourage anyone interested in "the problems
of today's theatre" to see it. The dialogue, a pretentious blend of
Wilde, James and Beerbohm needs to be cut drastically. Such cutting
would help the characters escape the cliches with which the author so
richly dresses them. There is hardly anything in the piece that is new.
