# Football Practice To Start
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
The 1972 edition of the Stanford football team begins Spring
football practice tomorrow morning at 9:30. 75-80 players are
expected to turn out.
Head coach Jack Christensen along with assistants Dave Curry and
Bill Moultrie are the only returnees from last year's staff that directed
the Cards to the Rose Bowl.
Christiensen is fartfd with the task of directing a new coaching staff
as well as building a team. Spring football practice will be of special
importance this year because it will allow both coaches and players to
learn about each other.
Junior college transfers will be participating along with this year's
freshman, sophomores and juniors. Seniors with another year of
eligibility do not have to report until the 15th.
Ninety Minutes
All practices will run no more than ninety minutes a day, five days
a week: Monday thru Thursday, a rest on Friday and a scrimmage on
Saturday. Pac-8 rules say that all teams must get in twenty days of
practice within thirty-five.
Christensen's philosophy behind incorporating practice into five
consecutive weeks is that an intensive schedule permits players to "get
back to their studies" and allows him more time to concentrate on the
selection of players who should be brought back in the fall.
Player Interviews
"This type of practice schedule gives us the entire month of May,"
states Christensen, "We can look at films more intensively, recruit new
players and have an interview with each player. The interview was
started by Ralston three or four years ago, and it's a good idea.
Whether we talk for fifteen or thirty minutes, it's good to look at
somebody in the eye and find out his opinions of himself and how
things are going."
Christensen emphasizes that the purpose of spring practice is not
"to beat anybody to death." He explains that he will be approaching
practices in a manner different from Ralston. "John was always
looking for an intermediate step between a dummy practice and the
defense and offense simply running plays. He developed the thump
drill—a step between offense and defensive maneuvers and actual
scrimmages."
Christensen believes that such a practice is dangerous and although
there were no major injuries because of this system, he states, "There
is a great opportunity for somebody to get hurt; so, under these
conditions, I think you've got to be one way or the other-rather than
have the thump, we'll either have all dummy or all scrimmage."
Christensen On Discipline
In a scrimmage, players are guided by a rule book. The unwritten
rules come under the heading of discipline. Christensen views

discipline in the fall and spring as two different matters.
"I think spring football has got to be more of a learning situation,"
he says. "In a relaxed situation such as this the players art' not
representing the school; they are merely learning. We want less of an
emphasis on rules and regulations. In the fall, rules are something
you've got to have, for discipline in a team sport is needed to perform
correctly."
Christensen feels that discipline is not one large overriding principle
but that it is made up of "a lot of little things." "I think it is a mutual
respect between players themselves as well as between coaches and
players," states the former San Francisco Forty-Niner coach.
"They are not only representing themselves but also their
teammates, and anything they do in actions, dress, manner or
character in a hotel or on an airplane reflects directly on teammates,
coaches, the athletic department and all people connected with the
university as well as their parents."
Not wishing to give the impression that he has the final word
concerning the discipline of his team, Christensen explains, "A lot of
people think that the football team belongs to the school or the
coach; it doesn't—it's the player's team so it's themselves they've got
to worry about.
"For example, as far as hair is concerned, this is a personal matter,
but if it is so long that it is unruly and doesn't look good and if a
player wants to be disrespectful to his teammates, this is one way of
doing so."
Staff Agrees
Christensen stresses that he and his staff agree concerning the idea
of necessary mutual respect between coaches and players as a
pre-requisite for a successful season.
Joining Curry, Christensen and Moultrie will be six new coaches:
Bob Jones will act as offensive line coordinator; Pete Katella, formerly
the head coach at U.C. Riverside, will supervise the receivers; Norm
Hecker, ex-defensive coach for the Green Bay Packers, will coordinate
the defensive line; Ray Hanley, a former player for Stanford who
worked with the team last year, will coach the linebackers.
George Siefert, previously head coach at the University of Oregon
for five years, will handle the defensive secondary; and Hudson
Howke, freshman coach at USC for the past two years, will work with
the offensive line in the Spring and the freshman in the fall.
Moultrie has moved from coaching the freshman to working with
special teams and Curry will coach the running backs.
In May, Pac-8 faculty representatives and athletic directors will
decide upon the specific details of freshman eligibility for varsity
competition. The roles of the freshmen and a decision as to whether
freshmen can come to practice early in the fall will be determined at
that time. According to Christensen, Stanford's freshman program will
remain unchanged.

importance this year because it will allow both coaches and players to
learn about each other.
Junior college transfers will be participating along with this year's
freshman, sophomores and juniors. Seniors with another year of
eligibility do not have to report until the 15th.
Ninety Minutes
All practices will run no more than ninety minutes a day, five days
a week: Monday thru Thursday, a rest on Friday and a scrimmage on
Saturday. Pac-8 rules say that all teams must get in twenty days of
practice within thirty-five.
Christensen's philosophy behind incorporating practice into five
consecutive weeks is that an intensive schedule permits players to "get
back to their studies" and allows him more time to concentrate on the
selection of players who should be brought back in the fall.
Player Interviews
"This type of practice schedule gives us the entire month of May,"
states Christensen, "We can look at films more intensively, recruit new
players and have an interview with each player. The interview was
started by Ralston three or four years ago, and it's a good idea.
Whether we talk for fifteen or thirty minutes, it's good to look at
somebody in the eye and find out his opinions of himself and how
things are going."
Christensen emphasizes that the purpose of spring practice is not
"to beat anybody to death." He explains that he will be approaching
practices in a manner different from Ralston. "John was always
looking for an intermediate step between a dummy practice and the
defense and offense simply running plays. He developed the thump
drill—a step between offense and defensive maneuvers and actual
scrimmages."
Christensen believes that such a practice is dangerous and although
there were no major injuries because of this system, he states, "There
is a great opportunity for somebody to get hurt; so, under these
conditions, I think you've got to be one way or the other-rather than
have the thump, we'll either have all dummy or all scrimmage."
Christensen On Discipline
In a scrimmage, players are guided by a rule book. The unwritten
rules come under the heading of discipline. Christensen views

discipline in the fall and spring as two different matters.
"I think spring football has got to be more of a learning situation,"
he says. "In a relaxed situation such as this the players art' not
representing the school; they are merely learning. We want less of an
emphasis on rules and regulations. In the fall, rules are something
you've got to have, for discipline in a team sport is needed to perform
correctly."
Christensen feels that discipline is not one large overriding principle
but that it is made up of "a lot of little things." "I think it is a mutual
respect between players themselves as well as between coaches and
players," states the former San Francisco Forty-Niner coach.
"They are not only representing themselves but also their
teammates, and anything they do in actions, dress, manner or
character in a hotel or on an airplane reflects directly on teammates,
coaches, the athletic department and all people connected with the
university as well as their parents."
Not wishing to give the impression that he has the final word
concerning the discipline of his team, Christensen explains, "A lot of
people think that the football team belongs to the school or the
coach; it doesn't—it's the player's team so it's themselves they've got
to worry about.
"For example, as far as hair is concerned, this is a personal matter,
but if it is so long that it is unruly and doesn't look good and if a
player wants to be disrespectful to his teammates, this is one way of
doing so."
Staff Agrees
Christensen stresses that he and his staff agree concerning the idea
of necessary mutual respect between coaches and players as a
pre-requisite for a successful season.
Joining Curry, Christensen and Moultrie will be six new coaches:
Bob Jones will act as offensive line coordinator; Pete Katella, formerly
the head coach at U.C. Riverside, will supervise the receivers; Norm
Hecker, ex-defensive coach for the Green Bay Packers, will coordinate
the defensive line; Ray Hanley, a former player for Stanford who
worked with the team last year, will coach the linebackers.
George Siefert, previously head coach at the University of Oregon
for five years, will handle the defensive secondary; and Hudson
Howke, freshman coach at USC for the past two years, will work with
the offensive line in the Spring and the freshman in the fall.
Moultrie has moved from coaching the freshman to working with
special teams and Curry will coach the running backs.
In May, Pac-8 faculty representatives and athletic directors will
decide upon the specific details of freshman eligibility for varsity
competition. The roles of the freshmen and a decision as to whether
freshmen can come to practice early in the fall will be determined at
that time. According to Christensen, Stanford's freshman program will
remain unchanged.

Saturday. Pac-8 rules say that all teams must get in twenty days of
practice within thirty-five.
Christensen's philosophy behind incorporating practice into five
consecutive weeks is that an intensive schedule permits players to "get
back to their studies" and allows him more time to concentrate on the
selection of players who should be brought back in the fall.
Player Interviews
"This type of practice schedule gives us the entire month of May,"
states Christensen, "We can look at films more intensively, recruit new
players and have an interview with each player. The interview was
started by Ralston three or four years ago, and it's a good idea.
Whether we talk for fifteen or thirty minutes, it's good to look at
somebody in the eye and find out his opinions of himself and how
things are going."
Christensen emphasizes that the purpose of spring practice is not
"to beat anybody to death." He explains that he will be approaching
practices in a manner different from Ralston. "John was always
looking for an intermediate step between a dummy practice and the
defense and offense simply running plays. He developed the thump
drill—a step between offense and defensive maneuvers and actual
scrimmages."
Christensen believes that such a practice is dangerous and although
there were no major injuries because of this system, he states, "There
is a great opportunity for somebody to get hurt; so, under these
conditions, I think you've got to be one way or the other-rather than
have the thump, we'll either have all dummy or all scrimmage."
Christensen On Discipline
In a scrimmage, players are guided by a rule book. The unwritten
rules come under the heading of discipline. Christensen views

discipline in the fall and spring as two different matters.
"I think spring football has got to be more of a learning situation,"
he says. "In a relaxed situation such as this the players art' not
representing the school; they are merely learning. We want less of an
emphasis on rules and regulations. In the fall, rules are something
you've got to have, for discipline in a team sport is needed to perform
correctly."
Christensen feels that discipline is not one large overriding principle
but that it is made up of "a lot of little things." "I think it is a mutual
respect between players themselves as well as between coaches and
players," states the former San Francisco Forty-Niner coach.
"They are not only representing themselves but also their
teammates, and anything they do in actions, dress, manner or
character in a hotel or on an airplane reflects directly on teammates,
coaches, the athletic department and all people connected with the
university as well as their parents."
Not wishing to give the impression that he has the final word
concerning the discipline of his team, Christensen explains, "A lot of
people think that the football team belongs to the school or the
coach; it doesn't—it's the player's team so it's themselves they've got
to worry about.
"For example, as far as hair is concerned, this is a personal matter,
but if it is so long that it is unruly and doesn't look good and if a
player wants to be disrespectful to his teammates, this is one way of
doing so."
Staff Agrees
Christensen stresses that he and his staff agree concerning the idea
of necessary mutual respect between coaches and players as a
pre-requisite for a successful season.
Joining Curry, Christensen and Moultrie will be six new coaches:
Bob Jones will act as offensive line coordinator; Pete Katella, formerly
the head coach at U.C. Riverside, will supervise the receivers; Norm
Hecker, ex-defensive coach for the Green Bay Packers, will coordinate
the defensive line; Ray Hanley, a former player for Stanford who
worked with the team last year, will coach the linebackers.
George Siefert, previously head coach at the University of Oregon
for five years, will handle the defensive secondary; and Hudson
Howke, freshman coach at USC for the past two years, will work with
the offensive line in the Spring and the freshman in the fall.
Moultrie has moved from coaching the freshman to working with
special teams and Curry will coach the running backs.
In May, Pac-8 faculty representatives and athletic directors will
decide upon the specific details of freshman eligibility for varsity
competition. The roles of the freshmen and a decision as to whether
freshmen can come to practice early in the fall will be determined at
that time. According to Christensen, Stanford's freshman program will
remain unchanged.
