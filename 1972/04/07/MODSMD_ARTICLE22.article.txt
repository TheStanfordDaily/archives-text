## A 						Wrestler's Plight 
### Doug Wilson 
Wrestling season is over, and I
for one am more than happy to
see it go. Not that I don't like the
sport, of course (I enjoy seeing
two people beat the hell out of
each other as much as the next
guy)—it's just that my friend Ken
Krebs was wasting away to
nothing trying to keep his weight
down so that he could wrestle in
the most advantageous
classification.
Ken was a depressing person to
be around last quarter. Especially
at meals. He would sit with us at
the table, a cottage-cheese and
lettuce sandwich half-eaten on his
plate, and stare longingly at the
piece of meat (or whatever it was
under the gravy) on my plate, his
eyes glistening, his voice becoming
unsteady, and all the while trying
hard to smile (partly, I believe, to
stop the drooling). Dessert was
sheer pathos. The bags under his
eyes (muscular of course;
wrestlers develop every part of
their body) were notably visible
under the stress of chocolate ice
cream. Ken could not be
comforted when I offered a bit of
hot fudge sauce to go with his salt
tablet; seeing the discomfort and
the pity he was arousing he would
quietly leave the table, and head
for the bathroom scales.
One had to be careful in
conservation. The mere mention
of the word "weigh-in" would
send shivers up Kreb's spine; his
body would tense, and he would
begin running in place, muttering
"only one and a half more pounds
before tomorrow" and theorizing

"if I don't eat for th£ next three
weeks, I can wrestle lightweight in
the nationals."
I did not understand how
Krebs could continue to wrestle,
gaunt as he was. Granted, he was
in perfect physical condition,
outwardly; every hair in his
eyebrow, every fingernail bulged
and rippled. Even his cheeks,
which by now turned inward from
lack of food, were
muscular—wrestlers do cheek
exercises, I found out.
Now, all that has changed. The
day after wrestling season ended,
Krebs began an eating spree that
resulted in a net gain of
twenty-four pounds in thirty-six
hours. I myself contributed a
two-pound box of chocolates to
the effort, which were gratefully
accepted in between bites of
chicken wing and long draughts
on the milk carton.
Lately, I've noticed the
beginnings of a paunch, and Krebs
has, too, I believe, for he has
begun short grappling sessions
with his dog, Moose, to keep in
trim. But things are a lot more
pleasant at meals nowadays, and
when I asked him how things
shaped up for next year's
wrestling squad, he just grunted
and said "pass the pudding."

WILL HE BE READY?—Sandy Mayer, Stanford's number two singles
player, is recovering from an injured leg. In the past two weeks Mayer
has seen little action. How well he is able to play will go a long way
toward deciding how well the Cards will fare against USC and UCLA
this weekend.

TRAP PLAY—First baseman Mark Lucich (20) and second baseman Dave Edson (4) rundown a U.C. Davis
player in a game last Saturday. This weekend they will be facing the defending NCAA champions, USC, at
Los Angeles. Stanford hopes to win at least two of the three game series.
