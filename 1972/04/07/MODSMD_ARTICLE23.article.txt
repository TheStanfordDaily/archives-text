# Racketmen Face Southland Rivals
## 
### DAVID ANTONUCCIO 
The Stanford tennis team
travels to Los Angeles this
weekend to face UCLA and USC.
Today the Cards hope to defeat
the Bruins for the first time since
1942, before tangling with the
Trojans on Saturday morning.
"This is our best opportunity
in thirty years to beat UCLA.
We're certainly not afraid of
them. I think we're a better team
but they will have the home court
advantage and we'll have to play
well to win," commented Coach
Dick Gould. 'Their first three
players have beaten many of the
world's top professionals and all
have national rankings."
In the past twenty-two years,
UCLA and USC have captured the
NCAA Championship ten times
each, with the Bruins the victors
the past two years. The UCLA
netmen, who recently downed the

French Davis Cup team, will pit
Jeff Austin against Indian
strokemaster Roscoe Tanner.
Austin is a highly ranked national
men's player and previous
matches with Tanner have always
been close.
If the ailing Sandy Mayer
recovers from an injured leg, he'll
face Junior Wimbleton Champion
Bob Kreiss. In the past two weeks
Mayer has seen little action and
this could conceivably affect his
performance, but it looks now as
though he'll be healthy and in
good form.
Frosh sensation Chico Hagey
will play in the number three
position followed by Rick Fisher,
Paul Sidone, and Gery
Groslimond. The doubles teams
will be Tanner-Mayer,
Fisher-Fisher, and Hagey-Delaney.
Stanford will probably throw
the same lineup against USC or.

Saturday. The Trojans again have
one of the best teams in the
country with a number two
ranking, and have a good shot at
the national championship.
Mexican Davis Cuppers
Marcelo Lara and Raul Ramirez,
numbers one and two on the
Trojan squad, will face Tanner
and Mayer in doubles
competition. In their last meeting
in La Jolla a month ago,
Tanner-Mayer fell 7-6 in the fifth
set. Coach Gould rates this duel a
toss-up. SC has other outstanding
doubles as their number three
players are the Southern
California Intercollegiate
Champions.
Singles match ups will also be a
battle. Last season Tanner
defeated Lara three times but
Lara has improved tremendously
since then, and Roscoe will have
his work cut out for him. Mayer
downed Ramirez in a close match
in the semi-finals of the National
Indoor Championship in Salt Lake
this year. Ramirez, U.S. National
Juniors Champion, had a bad
wrist at the time.
The rest of the SC lineup will
probably read Dick Bohrnstedt,
Mike Machette, John Andrews,
and Sashi Menon (former Junior
Champ of India). Ramirez is the
only addition to last year's squad
which finished fourth nationally.
"This is the first time since I've
been here as a student and player
since 1955, that we've had a
realistic chance to sweep UCLA
and USC," added Gould.

one of the best teams in the
country with a number two
ranking, and have a good shot at
the national championship.
Mexican Davis Cuppers
Marcelo Lara and Raul Ramirez,
numbers one and two on the
Trojan squad, will face Tanner
and Mayer in doubles
competition. In their last meeting
in La Jolla a month ago,
Tanner-Mayer fell 7-6 in the fifth
set. Coach Gould rates this duel a
toss-up. SC has other outstanding
doubles as their number three
players are the Southern
California Intercollegiate
Champions.
Singles match ups will also be a
battle. Last season Tanner
defeated Lara three times but
Lara has improved tremendously
since then, and Roscoe will have
his work cut out for him. Mayer
downed Ramirez in a close match
in the semi-finals of the National
Indoor Championship in Salt Lake
this year. Ramirez, U.S. National
Juniors Champion, had a bad
wrist at the time.
The rest of the SC lineup will
probably read Dick Bohrnstedt,
Mike Machette, John Andrews,
and Sashi Menon (former Junior
Champ of India). Ramirez is the
only addition to last year's squad
which finished fourth nationally.
"This is the first time since I've
been here as a student and player
since 1955, that we've had a
realistic chance to sweep UCLA
and USC," added Gould.
The Stanford tennis team
travels to Los Angeles this
weekend to face UCLA and USC.
Today the Cards hope to defeat
the Bruins for the first time since
1942, before tangling with the
Trojans on Saturday morning.
"This is our best opportunity
in thirty years to beat UCLA.
We're certainly not afraid of
them. I think we're a better team
but they will have the home court
advantage and we'll have to play
well to win," commented Coach
Dick Gould. 'Their first three
players have beaten many of the
world's top professionals and all
have national rankings."
In the past twenty-two years,
UCLA and USC have captured the
NCAA Championship ten times
each, with the Bruins the victors
the past two years. The UCLA
netmen, who recently downed the

French Davis Cup team, will pit
Jeff Austin against Indian
strokemaster Roscoe Tanner.
Austin is a highly ranked national
men's player and previous
matches with Tanner have always
been close.
If the ailing Sandy Mayer
recovers from an injured leg, he'll
face Junior Wimbleton Champion
Bob Kreiss. In the past two weeks
Mayer has seen little action and
this could conceivably affect his
performance, but it looks now as
though he'll be healthy and in
good form.
Frosh sensation Chico Hagey
will play in the number three
position followed by Rick Fisher,
Paul Sidone, and Gery
Groslimond. The doubles teams
will be Tanner-Mayer,
Fisher-Fisher, and Hagey-Delaney.
Stanford will probably throw
the same lineup against USC or.

Saturday. The Trojans again have
one of the best teams in the
country with a number two
ranking, and have a good shot at
the national championship.
