# Batsmen Meet USC In Crucial Series
## 
### JAY GELLERT 
The Stanford Baseball Team opens their Pac-8 season with a
three-game series this weekend on the road against the Trojans of the
University of Southern California. Stanford baseball coach, Ray
Young, considers this series with the defending national champions
"the three most important games of the year."
The Trojan team that the Cards will face in a single game Friday
and a doubleheader Saturday is much the same club as last year's
team. This Trojan team is marked with experience and depth. All their
regulars of last year have returned and the only question mark is the
pitching staff where they have lost two starters.
The Trojans, ranked sixth nationally, started slow this season, but
came on strong to win the Armed Service Easter Tournament. They
are led by all league infielder, George Ambrow, left-handed
outfielders, Fred Lynn and Tim Steele, and power-hitting first
baseman, Darryl Arienstein. The pitching staff has of late returned to
last year's form with the strong performances by Mark Sogge (11-0
last year) and Randy Searberry.
The "screwy dimensions" of the Trojan's Bovard Field have
plagued many a team. Though it is 400 feet to straight away center,
the fence is only 285 feet from home plate in straightaway right. The
Trojans take advantage of this by loading up with left-handers and
force the opposition to play home-run ball with them. For example,
last year when the Cards lost 8-4, they outhit SC 14-6, yet six Trojan
runs were scored on home runs that would have been well within play
elsewhere.
Stanford, ranked third nationally, is ready for USC, though. Coach
Young feels that this is the best ball club that he has had at Stanford.

This club, that has won more games at this point than any other
Stanford team, is marked by great depth, good hitting (team average is
close to .300), and fine pitching (team E.R.A. of 2.00). The only
problem area, the defense, is finally shaping up.
Coach Young is especially impressed with the hitting of outfielder,
Tom Williams (.445), third baseman, Mickey Aguiere (.370), and
outfielder, Mike Nelson (.342), and the power of Rod Boone (7 home
runs and 28 R. 8.1.'5).
The pitching, led by starters Bob Di Pietro (5-2), Dan Shaw (7-0),
Nick Peterson (2-1), and Bob Kammeyer (5-2), and reliever, Mike
Higgins (3-1) and Tom Shangnon (0.39 E.R.A.), make this the
strongest staff at Stanford in many years. The addition of basketball
player, Dave Frost, adds depth. Frost went 9 innings giving up only
one earned run against the University of the Pacific.
The team has retained the momentum of the Riverside
Tournament and Coach Young feels the team is "high and ready."
Stanford has always done well with USC and then later let down
against other conference rivals. This year, Young is optimistic that this
won't happen. He feels that if they can win at least two of the three
over the weekend, the Cards are well on the road to the College World
Series in Omaha, Nebraska.
Friday, Young is starting sophomore Bob Di Pietro, who is coming
off back-to-back shutouts against UCLA and UCD. The pitchers for
Saturday's doubleheader will be Shaw, Peterson or Kammeyer.
In summary, Coach Young said "If we can play our game, we
expect to do well and even sweep (the series)." There is no question
the Cards are ready for this series that will play a good part in
deciding the Pac-8 champion.
