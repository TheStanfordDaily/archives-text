North Vietnam Bombed
SAIGON — Scores of U.S. warplanes
and several destroyers pounded targets
inside North Vietnam for a second day
today in the biggest air and naval
onslaught since the 1968 bombing
halt.
The attacks countered a three-front
North Vietnamese offensive that has
brought the war to a new peak in
South Vietnam.
The U.S. Command announced that
two Navy A 7 attack aircraft were shot
down over the North in the opening
round of strikes yesterday. The com
mand also disclosed the loss of a big
Air Force rescue helicopter just south
of the demilitarized zone and said a
destroyer was damaged by fire from
shore batteries.
For the first time in the war, North
Vietnamese fired a surface-to-air mis
sile from South Vietnamese soil.
Witnesses on the northern front said
the missile was fired at an allied plane
from one of the abandoned South
Vietnamese bases. It missed the plane.
New Mideast Split
CAIRO — Egypt has severed relations
with Jordan in retaliation for King
Hussein's proposal to create a Palestine
state on the occupied west bank of the
Jordan River, President Anwar Sadat
announced last night.
Addressing the Palestinian- National
Council, Sadat also declared that
Egypt will fight Israel "to defend
Egypt's rights as well as the Palestin
ians' rights. We will fight from house

to house if necessary and pay the price
in blood."
Referring to the break with Jordan,
Sadat said: "We have taken this
decision with regret because we care
much for the Jordanian people. But it
should be clear we refuse to let the
Jordanian front, which represents our
eastern front against Israel, become an
open door to the enemy."
Egypt is the third Arab state to
sever relations with Jordan. Libya and
Syria, Egypt's partners in a federation,
broke ties after Hussein's army crack
ed down on the Palestine guerrillas in
1970-1971. Egyptian and Jordanian
relations were strained at that time.
Coalition Urged
PARIS — Claiming major victories in
the offensive in South Vietnam, the
Viet Cong's chief delegate to the Paris
peace talks said yesterday the over-all
aim is to set up a coalition government
in Saigon.
Nguyen Thi Binh also insisted the
United States return to the peace
table. She and the North Vietnamese
delegation reiterated charges that the
United States had sabotaged the peace
talks.
"What we want and what we are
doing is to liberate all of South
Vietnam from American aggression to
permit a government of national
concord, which will be formed, to
install its seat in Saigon itself," Binh
said.
The government of national con
cord, which is a key point in the Viet
Cong peace plan put forth last July 1,
would include the Viet Cong, members
of the present Saigon administration

after the departure of President
Nguyen Van Thieu and representatives
of other forces favoring peace, inde
pendence and neutrality.
Binh told reporters she hoped that
the Viet Cong peace plan will be
accepted by the United States at the
Paris talks. But since the United States
suspended the conference indefinitely
March 23, she continued, the "nation
al liberation forces of South Vietnam"
were obliged to step up military action
to achieve their goal.
Women May Be Drafted
COUPVILLE, Wash. - The national
director of the Selective Service
System said women definitely will be
drafted if the equal rights amendment
to the Constitution is ratified.
Curtis Tarr, 47, said there is "no
question about it," but added, he does
not think drafting women is a good
idea.
"You can't put women in tough,
combat jobs," he said. "There are so
many things they can't do physically.
Tell one to take a mortar casing over
the hill and, by thunder, she can't even
get it over a log."
The proposed constitutional
amendment guaranteeing equal rights
for women was rejected yesterday by
the Connecticut House of Representa
tives, with 10 of 18 women members
voting against it.
So far, 11 states have ratified the
proposed amendment. The approval of
38 state legislatures is needed for
adoption. Yesterday's vote made Con
necticut the second state to reject the
amendment. Oklahoma was the first.
