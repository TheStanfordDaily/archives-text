# Two Refused Marin Escape
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
SAN ,JOSEâ€”Two San Quentin prisoners refused an offer
to join the August, 1970, escape attempt at the Marin
County Courthouse, according to testimony in the Angela
Davis trial yesterday.
John T. Mitchell, a San Quentin correctional officer,
told the jury in Davis' San Jose trial that one of the
inmates explained he would not participate because "I
don't have enough time to do [in prison] to go with
you."
Davis is charged with providing guns and helping to
plan the escape attempt, which ended in four deaths. The
prosecution charges that Jonathan Jackson smuggled guns
into a courtroom and was joined by inmate James
McClain, who was on trial there, and two other convicts
who were testifying in his defense.
But Mitchell said the third and fourth inmate-witnesses
refused to join McClain and Jackson, who approached
their holding cell. Mitchell said McClain and Jackson were
carrying weapons and holding Judge Harold Haley
hostage.

Before the morning events, Mitchell said, McClain and
the four inmates who were to testify for him huddled
closely together in two brief conferences in the holding
cell.
He added that at the lime of the second conference
McClain changed the order of the inmates who would
testify in his trial that morning. The prosecution contends
the inmates knew of the escape plan in advance.
Two of yesterday's eight witnesses were Los Angeles
gun salesmen, who testified that Davis purchased two of
the weapons used in the San Rafael incident from them in
1968 and 1969.
The salesmen identified registration certificates signed
by Miss Davis and sales slips for ammunition and an M-l
Carbine, and a Browning pistol.
But both salesmen agreed with defense contentions
that such purchases were "nothing unusual" for a
target-shooter hobbyist. One salesman added that Davis
asked him to recommend a pistol she could use for
"personal protection."
