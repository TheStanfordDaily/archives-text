# Sixth Fee Assessment Added
## 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
The student Senate last night added
one more fee assessment to the
upcoming elections ballot, and
amended the ASSU Constitution to
allow students to write in candidates
for ASSU president.
The new fee request asks "that a
one dollar special assessment per
student will be levied during the fall
quarter of the academic year 1972-73
to finance the Afro-American Stanford
Community cultural and tutorial
programs sponsored by the Black
Students Union for the upcoming
year."
The proposed assessment includes a
negative option plan which allows any
student who wishes to get his money
back to do so during fall quarter.
The addition to the ballot of the
referendum brings the total number of
proposed assessments to six. Already
on the ballot are fee requests from
KZSU, the Publications

Board-Stanford Daily, ASSU Program
Fee, Special Events, and one from
Citizens Advocates.
The KZSU, ASSU Program, and the
Special Events proposal are the only
fee assessments on the ballot so far
which do not include a negative option
plan.
After lengthy discussion the Senate
voted to refer a proposed
Constitutional amendment to the
By-Laws Committee for further study,
rather than put it on the upcoming
ballot. The amendment, submitted by
presidential candidate Chris Hocker,
proposes that membership in the
ASSU be made voluntary.
The constitutional amendment
concerning requirements for
presidential candidates, however, did
pass by the required two-thirds vote of
the Senate. The amended section of
the Constitution now allows students
to write in candidates for the office of
president, and states that a write-in

candidate is qualified to serve as
president. Previously a write-in
candidate, even if he won, was not
permitted to hold the office.
The Senate also passed a resolution
initiated by Senator Jeniffer Springer
which calls for a moritorium on all
Campus Judicial Panel hearings until
the proposed University Judicial
System (UJS) is placed before the
student body for approval. The
Committee of 15 is currently
considering that proposal.
However, the proposed judicial
system will not be on the ballot in the
upcoming election.
All proposals, referenda, and
candidates for office have now been
forwarded to Elections Commissioner
Johnny Lawson. Lawson expects to
have the final ballot ready sometime
this afternoon.
The primary election will be held
next Wednesday and Thursday, April
12 and 13.
