# Ex-Cellmate
## Friend Of Jackson Slain 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
SAN JOSE—James E. Carr, a close
friend and former cellmate of
"Soledad Brother" George Jackson,
was assassinated yesterday morning as
he left his home here.
The victim of the ambush—killed
by rifle and shotgun fire at 7:11
a.m.—was thought to be a "super
radical" by some and a police
provocateur by others.

Whatever his allegience, Carr had an
incredible series of contacts with black
revolutionaries in recent years.
In the tangled web of Carr's
acquaintances, "Some people thought
he was a CIA agent, others thought he
was a super radical," Carr's attorney,
Richard Hodge, said yesterday.
Carr 'Enigmatic'
Hodge called Carr an "enigmatic
man" who was dealt with "on a

fantasy level" by many people. He
added, "I can think of lots of reasons
why someone would want to kill him,
people from the far left, the far right
and in between, because he was a very
controversial leader in prison."
Half an hour after the shooting,
police arrested two suspects for
investigation 25 miles south of here.
They were identified as Chester Duane
Ligons, 48 and black, and Richard
Rodriquez, 24 and a Chicano, both
from the Los Angeles area.
But the scant arrest report gave no
clue of why Jimmy Carr was "offed.''
Carr's experiences in radical politics
apparently began in Soledad Prison,
when he was George Jackson's
cellmate during a six-year robbery
term.
Jackson-Carr Relationship
"Jimmy really loved George
Jackson," according to Hodge, who
said that Jackson taught Carr how to
read and write. (Carr, who later was
Huey Newton's prison friend and
"bodyguard," became an outstanding
student at UC Santa Cruz after his
years in jail.)
Since Carr's release from jail two
years ago, he has been involved'in the
following series of incidents and
allegations:
—(1) FBI informer Thomas Mosher,
a former Stanford radical, told a
Senate committee last spring that Carr
killed Black Panther captain Fred
Bennett in January, 1971. Mosher said
the killing was witnessed by James
Johnson, another former Stanford
activist, who allegedly ran a bomb
factory in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
Johnson is now a fugitive.
—(2) Carr was arrested last April for
allegedly assaulting a policeman at a
hearing for Jackson and the other
Soledad Brothers.

PROBLEMS, PROBLEMS—Chef Arturo Lionetti of the Faculty Club dourly surveys the scene in the club during last
January's Eat-In staged by the Stanford Rehabilitation Movement. Minority workers are filing grievances with the
University asking for Lionetti's dismissal.
Hodge said that those who believe
Carr was a police agent point out that
the charge was reduced to a
misdemeanor with no prison term
despite Carr's guilty plea.
Advance Notice
—(3) LouisTackwood, the husband of
Carr's sister, alleged this fall that he
had been an undercover agent for the
Los Angeles Police Department, both
there and in the Bay Area. Tackwood
made wildly conflicting charges against
both police and radicals. One charge
was that police knew in advance that
there would be an escape attempt at
Marin Courthouse in August, 1970.
—(4) Carr lived quietly in San Jose
in recent months with his wife and son
in the home of his mother-in-law, Joan
Hammer, a veteran activist who knew
Angela Davis and the Jackson family.
—(5) The prosecution in the Davis
case charged that Jackson's younger
brother, Jonathan, borrowed a car
from a woman who lived for a time in
the Hammer house. The prosecution
claims the Marin escape attempt was
planned to lead to San Francisco
airport and that the car was found
there two weeks later.
—(6) Most recently, prosecutors in
the Davis trial said in pretrial hearings
that they possess a document allegedly
including comments by Carr and a
response written by George Jackson at
an undisclosed date. The letter,
allegedly found in Carr's pants pocket
at a Santa Cruz dry cleaners, is
rumored to show Jackson's interest in

prison escape attempts.
Hodge conceded that many of the
recent "fantasies" about Carr involved
speculation that he would tum up as
either a defense or a prosecution
witness in the Davis case.
Several hours after Carr's killing,
Assistant Attorney General Albert
Harris, the prosecutor in the Davis
case, refused to comment on whether
Carr would have been part of his case.
Chief Defense Attorney Howard
Moore similarly refused to say if Carr
might have been a potential defense

witness. But he did reveal that he
talked to Carr only last week.
Moore said that Carr "informed me
he has written no such letter" as that
alleged by Harris. Moore said he was
"by no means confident" that Jackson
wrote his half of the letter, either.
Hodge said yesterday that Carr's
role—informer or revolutionary—may
never be known. He commented that
learning the killer's motives could
reveal one of the many fantasies about
Carr without "coming much closer to
what was really true."

clue of why Jimmy Carr was "offed.''
Carr's experiences in radical politics
apparently began in Soledad Prison,
when he was George Jackson's
cellmate during a six-year robbery
term.
Jackson-Carr Relationship
"Jimmy really loved George
Jackson," according to Hodge, who
said that Jackson taught Carr how to
read and write. (Carr, who later was
Huey Newton's prison friend and
"bodyguard," became an outstanding
student at UC Santa Cruz after his
years in jail.)
Since Carr's release from jail two
years ago, he has been involved'in the
following series of incidents and
allegations:
—(1) FBI informer Thomas Mosher,
a former Stanford radical, told a
Senate committee last spring that Carr
killed Black Panther captain Fred
Bennett in January, 1971. Mosher said
the killing was witnessed by James
Johnson, another former Stanford
activist, who allegedly ran a bomb
factory in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
Johnson is now a fugitive.
—(2) Carr was arrested last April for
allegedly assaulting a policeman at a
hearing for Jackson and the other
Soledad Brothers.

PROBLEMS, PROBLEMS—Chef Arturo Lionetti of the Faculty Club dourly surveys the scene in the club during last
January's Eat-In staged by the Stanford Rehabilitation Movement. Minority workers are filing grievances with the
University asking for Lionetti's dismissal.
Hodge said that those who believe
Carr was a police agent point out that
the charge was reduced to a
misdemeanor with no prison term
despite Carr's guilty plea.
Advance Notice
—(3) LouisTackwood, the husband of
Carr's sister, alleged this fall that he
had been an undercover agent for the
Los Angeles Police Department, both
there and in the Bay Area. Tackwood
made wildly conflicting charges against
both police and radicals. One charge
was that police knew in advance that
there would be an escape attempt at
Marin Courthouse in August, 1970.
—(4) Carr lived quietly in San Jose
in recent months with his wife and son
in the home of his mother-in-law, Joan
Hammer, a veteran activist who knew
Angela Davis and the Jackson family.
—(5) The prosecution in the Davis
case charged that Jackson's younger
brother, Jonathan, borrowed a car
from a woman who lived for a time in
the Hammer house. The prosecution
claims the Marin escape attempt was
planned to lead to San Francisco
airport and that the car was found
there two weeks later.
—(6) Most recently, prosecutors in
the Davis trial said in pretrial hearings
that they possess a document allegedly
including comments by Carr and a
response written by George Jackson at
an undisclosed date. The letter,
allegedly found in Carr's pants pocket
at a Santa Cruz dry cleaners, is
rumored to show Jackson's interest in

prison escape attempts.
Hodge conceded that many of the
recent "fantasies" about Carr involved
speculation that he would tum up as
either a defense or a prosecution
witness in the Davis case.
Several hours after Carr's killing,
Assistant Attorney General Albert
Harris, the prosecutor in the Davis
case, refused to comment on whether
Carr would have been part of his case.
Chief Defense Attorney Howard
Moore similarly refused to say if Carr
might have been a potential defense

witness. But he did reveal that he
talked to Carr only last week.
Moore said that Carr "informed me
he has written no such letter" as that
alleged by Harris. Moore said he was
"by no means confident" that Jackson
wrote his half of the letter, either.
Hodge said yesterday that Carr's
role—informer or revolutionary—may
never be known. He commented that
learning the killer's motives could
reveal one of the many fantasies about
Carr without "coming much closer to
what was really true."
SAN JOSE—James E. Carr, a close
friend and former cellmate of
"Soledad Brother" George Jackson,
was assassinated yesterday morning as
he left his home here.
The victim of the ambush—killed
by rifle and shotgun fire at 7:11
a.m.—was thought to be a "super
radical" by some and a police
provocateur by others.

Whatever his allegience, Carr had an
incredible series of contacts with black
revolutionaries in recent years.
In the tangled web of Carr's
acquaintances, "Some people thought
he was a CIA agent, others thought he
was a super radical," Carr's attorney,
Richard Hodge, said yesterday.
Carr 'Enigmatic'
Hodge called Carr an "enigmatic
man" who was dealt with "on a

fantasy level" by many people. He
added, "I can think of lots of reasons
why someone would want to kill him,
people from the far left, the far right
and in between, because he was a very
controversial leader in prison."
Half an hour after the shooting,
police arrested two suspects for
investigation 25 miles south of here.
They were identified as Chester Duane
Ligons, 48 and black, and Richard
Rodriquez, 24 and a Chicano, both
from the Los Angeles area.

Hodge said that those who believe
Carr was a police agent point out that
the charge was reduced to a
misdemeanor with no prison term
despite Carr's guilty plea.
Advance Notice
—(3) LouisTackwood, the husband of
Carr's sister, alleged this fall that he
had been an undercover agent for the
Los Angeles Police Department, both
there and in the Bay Area. Tackwood
made wildly conflicting charges against
both police and radicals. One charge
was that police knew in advance that
there would be an escape attempt at
Marin Courthouse in August, 1970.
—(4) Carr lived quietly in San Jose
in recent months with his wife and son
in the home of his mother-in-law, Joan
Hammer, a veteran activist who knew
Angela Davis and the Jackson family.
—(5) The prosecution in the Davis
case charged that Jackson's younger
brother, Jonathan, borrowed a car
from a woman who lived for a time in
the Hammer house. The prosecution
claims the Marin escape attempt was
planned to lead to San Francisco
airport and that the car was found
there two weeks later.
—(6) Most recently, prosecutors in
the Davis trial said in pretrial hearings
that they possess a document allegedly
including comments by Carr and a
response written by George Jackson at
an undisclosed date. The letter,
allegedly found in Carr's pants pocket
at a Santa Cruz dry cleaners, is
rumored to show Jackson's interest in

prison escape attempts.
Hodge conceded that many of the
recent "fantasies" about Carr involved
speculation that he would tum up as
either a defense or a prosecution
witness in the Davis case.
Several hours after Carr's killing,
Assistant Attorney General Albert
Harris, the prosecutor in the Davis
case, refused to comment on whether
Carr would have been part of his case.
Chief Defense Attorney Howard
Moore similarly refused to say if Carr
might have been a potential defense

witness. But he did reveal that he
talked to Carr only last week.
Moore said that Carr "informed me
he has written no such letter" as that
alleged by Harris. Moore said he was
"by no means confident" that Jackson
wrote his half of the letter, either.
Hodge said yesterday that Carr's
role—informer or revolutionary—may
never be known. He commented that
learning the killer's motives could
reveal one of the many fantasies about
Carr without "coming much closer to
what was really true."
