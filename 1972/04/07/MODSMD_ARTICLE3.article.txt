# Ex-Cellmate
## Friend Of Jackson Slain 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
SAN JOSE—James E. Carr, a close
friend and former cellmate of
"Soledad Brother" George Jackson,
was assassinated yesterday morning as
he left his home here.
The victim of the ambush—killed
by rifle and shotgun fire at 7:11
a.m.—was thought to be a "super
radical" by some and a police
provocateur by others.

Whatever his allegience, Carr had an
incredible series of contacts with black
revolutionaries in recent years.
In the tangled web of Carr's
acquaintances, "Some people thought
he was a CIA agent, others thought he
was a super radical," Carr's attorney,
Richard Hodge, said yesterday.
Carr 'Enigmatic'
Hodge called Carr an "enigmatic
man" who was dealt with "on a

fantasy level" by many people. He
added, "I can think of lots of reasons
why someone would want to kill him,
people from the far left, the far right
and in between, because he was a very
controversial leader in prison."
Half an hour after the shooting,
police arrested two suspects for
investigation 25 miles south of here.
They were identified as Chester Duane
Ligons, 48 and black, and Richard
Rodriquez, 24 and a Chicano, both
from the Los Angeles area.
But the scant arrest report gave no
clue of why Jimmy Carr was "offed.''
Carr's experiences in radical politics
apparently began in Soledad Prison,
when he was George Jackson's
cellmate during a six-year robbery
term.
Jackson-Carr Relationship
"Jimmy really loved George
Jackson," according to Hodge, who
said that Jackson taught Carr how to
read and write. (Carr, who later was
Huey Newton's prison friend and
"bodyguard," became an outstanding
student at UC Santa Cruz after his
years in jail.)
Since Carr's release from jail two
years ago, he has been involved'in the
following series of incidents and
allegations:
—(1) FBI informer Thomas Mosher,
a former Stanford radical, told a
Senate committee last spring that Carr
killed Black Panther captain Fred
Bennett in January, 1971. Mosher said
the killing was witnessed by James
Johnson, another former Stanford
activist, who allegedly ran a bomb
factory in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
Johnson is now a fugitive.
—(2) Carr was arrested last April for
allegedly assaulting a policeman at a
hearing for Jackson and the other
Soledad Brothers.
