# Agnew In Palo Alto Tomorrow, Demonstrators Announce Plans
## 
### 
Vice-President Spiro T. Agnew will
speak to a California Republican
Assembly convention at the Cabana
Hyatt House in Palo Alto Saturday
night in the face of a demonstration
planned by the so-called "Committee
for Just Rewards."
The conservative Republican organ
ization, meeting Saturday and Sunday
to endorse a candidate for the
Presidency, will also hear former
Deputy Secretary of Defense and
former Stanford trustee David Pack
ard, Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke, and
presidential candidate John Ashbrook,
a conservative congressman from Ohio
who is challenging Nixon in Republi
can primaries nationwide.
Protesters intend to make a
"symbolic attempt" to present a
"Mouthpiece of the Empire Award" to
Agnew, according to Jim Shoch, a
Venceremos member and protest or
ganizer. They "will attempt to see
Agnew as he leaves" after his speech at
an 8 p.m. banquet.
Russo
After a march from the Co-op
Market parking lot at San Antonio

Ave. and El Camino Real, the
demonstrators plan to rally in the
Cabana parking lot to listen to several
speakers, including Tony Russo, co
defendant with Daniel Ellsberg in
litigation surrounding the "Pentagon
Papers," Aaron Manganiello, chairman
of Venceremos, and a representative
from the United Farm Workers Or
ganizing Committee, among others.
The dissidents will state three
demands: "1) U.S. acceptance of the
7-point plan of the provisional revolu
tionary government of South Vietnam
for peace in Indochina; 2) An end to
U.S. political, economic, and military
oppression of foreign—particularly
third world—nations; and 3) An end to
the Nixon administration's domestic
policies of political, economic, and
racial oppression."
New Coalition
A coalition of activist groups,
including the Palo Alto Peace Union,
Venceremos, the Stanford Rehabilita
tion Movement, the U.C. Berkeley
Campus Anti-Imperialist Coalition,
and the Palo Alto Tenants Union will
sponsor the demonstration.

The convention will be held amid
unusually tight security precautions
instituted by the Palo Alto Police
Department and the Secret Service.
Ashbrook, challenging Nixon for
California's 96 delegate votes in the
June 6 primary, does not expect to
obtain the CRA's endorsement. Ac
cording to Rad Dewey, a spokesman
for the Ashbrook campaign, "the best
we could do is to block an endorse
ment of Nixon."
The CRA, which claims 12,500
volunteer worker-members, has criti
cized Nixon's economic policies and
his trip to Communist China, but has
remained loyal to his campaign for
re-election, led in California by Gov.
Ronald Reagan.
Normally, Reagan is the major
speaker at CRA conventions, winning
the group's heartiest applause and
support, but Lt. Gov. Reinecke will
replace him as keynote speaker this
weekend.
Ashbrook partisans claim the con
vention is "stacked" against them, in
part because their candidate speaks
Saturday between Packard and Agnew,
two prominent Nixon supporters.
