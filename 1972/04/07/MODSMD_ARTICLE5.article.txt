# Special Events Board Requests $3 Assessment
## 
### DAVE SULITEANU 
The Special Events Board has
placed a $1 per student per quarter
fee-assessment proposal on next
week's student body election ballot to
replace $20,000 which has been lost
over the last two years.
Two years ago students approved a
similar fee assessment by an
overwhelming vote of 4,072 to 1,186.
The $40,000 Special Events received
from that assessment was to have
supplied the organization with enough
"capital" to bring big name concerts,
lectures and films to campus
indefinitely. The Board did not plan to
ask for more money.
But, according to last year's ASSU
financial manager, Special Events lost
$11,000 due to some poor financial
decisions and this year the Board lost
$7,000 on the Aretha Franklin concert
alone.
Consequently, the Board has only
$20,000 left—an amount termed
insufficient by Chairman Dave Elder
to bring popular concerts to the
Stanford campus.
And this time, Special Events is not
claiming that it will never again have
to ask students for money. If this fee
referendum passes, "I imagine another
referendum will be necessary in two or
three years," Elder, a business student,
said. "I don't know of any other
university that is concerned with
making money on concerts. I wouldn't
mind losing a couple of thousand
dollars on a good show, but I also

wouldn't throw the money away," he
added.
Plagues
The Board has been plagued from
the start by poor management,
inadequate or non-existent records,
and scheduling problems.
Many records, according to Elder,
were either not kept or the
information is presently buried
somewhere in the disarrayed pile of
records that does exist.
Last year, Special Events did
subsidize some lectures and films
although no one knows how much
money that cost because of the
records situation.
And no one knows how much
money was loaned last year by the
Board to needy student organizations
or whether it was paid back. The loans
were discontinued this year when
Elder's staff could not handle the
many requests for loans.
Because a new chairman of Special
Events is chosen every year, Elder can
only make recommendations towards
what will be done next year. "Right
now we've got five applicants for the
job, none of whom has ever put on a
concert before. But I'll work with him
so that he doesn't start out in the dark
as I did."
Stevens, Dead
With a $60,000 capital base Elder
said he could put on two big shows per
quarter with acts like Cat Stevens and
the Grateful Dead. He emphasized that
the money would be used to benefit

students, not the entire community.
"We could lower student ticket prices
to $2 or $2.50 for shows that they
would pay $6 to see at Circle Star."
To provide a regular schedule of
entertainment, Elder proposes smaller
weekly concerts and dances in
Dinkelspiel or the Old Pavilion with an
admission of $1.
Special Events could also buy
equipment which they are presently
renting at high cost, and resume
issuing loans to needy student
organizations.
The $20,000 spent in the last two
years has paid for 28 different acts in
addition to Special Events services
which all students receive: the
quarterly ASSU Special Events
calendar, lunch-time bands in White
Plaza, and free use of a P.A. system for
White Plaza rallies and other functions.

Though two or three concerts are
scheduled for Spring quarter, this has
not been a memorable year for
concerts when compared with last
year, which saw Chicago, Sha-Na-Na,
the Moody Blues, Laura Nyro, and Sly
and The Family Stone all appear.
The shortage of money and Dave
Elder's resulting cautiousness is one
reason. The scarcity of available
groups has made it difficult to arrange
a show that would have a good chance

of financial success and interest a
variety of Stanford students, explained
Elder.
Channels
Perhaps the major problems this
year have centered around
administrative channels, particularly in
obtaining auditoriums. "We had Taj
Mahal all lined up," said Elder, "but
by the time I got a hall lined up, they
had arranged another date."
The Grateful Dead wanted to do a
benefit concert in Frost, but Frost has
been closed to rock concerts since last
summer due to insufficient security
measures. They were turned down.
Bob Young, acting athletic director,
proposes to make Maples Pavilion off
limits to rock concerts. "Maples is not
insured for this type of thing, and if
serious damage were to occur as a
result of a concert, the Athletic
Department would be in serious
financial trouble," said Young. "There
is just as much chance of something
happening in Maples as in Frost."
For two of the concerts held in
Maples, the department charged
money in addition to cleanup fees,
lights, etc. This money—s7so for the
Moody Blues, $1500 for Chicago, but
$0 for Aretha Franklin—went directly
into the department fund. "We feel
that anybody who uses the pavilion
should help us pay for it," said Young.
He explained the discrepancy between
the prices by saying that there was as
yet no fixed price, and that it was
subject to bargaining.

ARETHA LOSS—Last November's Aretha Franklin concert at Maples Pavilion
lost about $7000. The ASSU Special Events Board, which staged the concert, is
on next week's ballot requesting $1 per quarter per student to help fund further
activities.
