## Protest Agnew Speech 
### 
A massive peaceful protest against Vice
President Agnew during his visit to Palo
Alto tomorrow night will be the most
appropriate response of the Stanford
community to President Nixon's escalation
of the bombing in Vietnam and his entire
Vietnam policy.
As obnoxious as war always is, it is
particularly unacceptable for the United
States to kill from the air when we are no
longer willing to risk our own soldiers. It is
also unforgivable that civilians should be
made to suffer through the bombing
because of the troop movement going on
around them.
Should the demonstration against Agnew
be anything less than massive, the Nixon
Administration could interpret this as a sign
that in the future it will be allowed to
embark upon similarly odious ventures with
virtual impunity. We should not miss this
opportunity to inform the chief spokesman
of Administration policies that we oppose
this particular policy.
Stanford must not continue to remain as
silent as it- has been about the manner in
which Nixon has been "winding down the
war."
One should not forget that protests
against the 1970 invasion of Cambodia
helped create a political atmosphere that
forced Nixon to adopt a more cautious
Vietnam policy. Nixon can be forced to end
the bombing.

Let us not be duped into believing that
troop withdrawal is the same as total
withdrawal from the war: we are killing just
as many, if not more, Vietnamese,
Cambodians and Laotians with bombing as
we were in ground combat.
A massive peaceful demonstration against
Agnew will prove to the President that, far
from having disappeared, protest against the
war is as strong as ever. It will also show
that Americans believe that Nixon's
escalation of the bombing is a breach of
faith regarding his promise to bring an end
to the war.
The tremendous escalation of the
bombing should not obscure the fact that
air strikes in the past year and a half have
been far more than what Nixon has been
calling "protective reaction." Since May,
1970 the United States has launched eight
separate air attacks involving up to 250
fighter-bombers and lasting as long as five
days each. We should never have allowed the
Administration to get away with this
bombing in the first place.
When Congressman Pete McCloskey was
here earlier this week, he called on Stanford
to lead a nationwide movement against the
increased bombing.
Participation in the demonstration
against Agnew tomorrow night should only
be the first in a continuing series of actions
against the war and the bombing.
