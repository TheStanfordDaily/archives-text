## The 						Escalating Vietnam Air War 
### 
dan higgins

I spent enough time wandering
around the jungles of Vietnam to
know that "immediate"
withdrawal is nothing more than a
very pleasant dream. Given the
size of our military operations in
Indochina, withdrawal will
necessarily be a slow process.
Such a withdrawal was the
campaign promise of the Nixon
administration, and on the surface
a promise that appears to have
been kept through the
ahead-6f-schedule withdrawal of
American ground forces. In
conjunction with the ground
withdrawal we have had created
for us the image of air power
being used only as a protective
device.
It is an image that war-weary
America wants to believe, and
consequently does.
Unfortunately, it is an image only,
we are doing much more than just
protecting our troops What has
been called a "withdrawal" is in
fact only a different kind, and
much more terrible, offensive. It
is an air war. It is a war of low
visibility to the American public
because fewer Americans .are
directly involved.
Nevertheless, it is a war that is
much more total and
devastatingly more destructive
than the ground war could ever
have been. Most importantly, it is
not 'winding down'. It is only
beginning.
Facts
Here are some facts. More
bombs have been dropped over
Indochina in the three years of
the Nixon administration than
were dropped from 1962-69.
When the war was 'hot' in 1968,
there were under 200,000 tons of
bombs dropped on the Ho Chi
Minh Trail. The 1971 figure is
over 375,000 tons. The number of
civilians killed, wounded, and
refugeed under the Johnson

administration was 95,000 a
month.
The average civilian toll for the
Nixon administration is 130,000 a
month. The number of attack
carriers in the Gulf of Tonkin has
increased from two to three, and a
fourth is on the way, each with a
capacity of 75 combat aircraft.
Two-thirds of Laos, three-fourths
of Cambodia, all of North
Vietnam, and much of South
Vietnam are now what are called
"free-fire zones".
Basically, what that means is
that if anything moves at any time
of the night or day in well over
two-thirds of Indochina it is
subject to American bombing. At
the current rate we are dropping
4000 pounds of bombs a minute
over Indochina.
Replacement
What has happened, in effect,
is a replacement rather than a
withdrawal. We have increased our
involvement in an air war while
publicizing the withdrawal of
ground troops. If anything, our
involvement is deeper. The air war
is not limited to national
boundaries. It was an issue when
ground troops crossed the
Cambodian border, but in 1971
alone bombers flew silently over
the borders to drop 90,000 tons
of bombs in Cambodia.
In the same year they dropped
445,000 tons of bombs on CIA
picked targets in Laos. Most of
those bombers came from our five
air bases in Thailand, which is the
heart of the air war with 32,000
U.S. military personal and over
200 attack bombers (as of
January, 1972).
It is not simply the physical
spread of the air war that steeps
our involvement, it is the way an
air war is fought. No matter what
you might think about American
ground troops, there are not many
who do the kind of thing Calley

was purported to have done. A
man on the ground can
discriminate between a combatant
and a civilian.
A bomber flying at 30,000 feet
cannot, nor does a fighter diving
at 500 miles per hour. Bombers
are not part of the public
conscience. If an infantry platoon
slaughters a village, that's a no-no,
but if an F-4 does it with a
canister of napalm or seething
white phosphorous it's ok.
'Military'
The administration has claimed
that our targets are only
"military". If so, then it is resting
on the assumption that the
two-thirds of Indochina it has
proclaimed to be a free-fire zone
is occupied by only military
personal. That seems to be a
somewhat grandiose estimate of
the size of the communist armies.
Nevertheless, we bomb these
areas constantly. In Laos alone
our bombing has left 100,000
civilians dead, 250,000 wounded,
and a million homeless. In
committing ourselves to this kind
of tactic we have made ourselves
the enemy of the whole society
and culture of Indochina, and not
just the troops and guerrillas.
Likewise, we buy ourselves
more enemies. From 1961-64, the
Viet Cong recruited an average of
a little over 35,000 a year. In
1965, the first year of intensive
U.S. bombing, they recruited
120,000.
Postpone
For every month and year that
the air war continues we increase
the number of American POWs
and postpone their release. Since
the Nixon administration took
office we have had a flier captured
or missing in action at the rate of
one every three days. This will
continue and talk about
negotiating a prisoner release is
only empty rhetoric as long as
America keeps up its

bombardment of Indochina.
The administration is
somewhat less vocal about its
expansion of the air war than it is
about the withdrawal of ground
forces. Before 1969, seventy
percent of the bombing tonnage
fell in South Vietnam. Since then,
two-thirds of the tonnage has
fallen in other Indochinese
countries. To squelch this kind of
publicity newsmen are forbidden
to go on bombing raids outside of
South Vietnam and only a few
journalists are allowed on the big
Thai airbases from which the vast
majority of the strikes against
Laos, Cambodia, and North
Vietnam are flown.
This would not seem so strange
if those same newsmen didn't
have almost free access to bases
and pilots in South Vietnam who
fly only in-country missions. A
great deal of the target picking
and the ground combat role in
Laos has been turned over to the
CIA, which is virtually not
responsible to anyone for their
actions.
Homeless
While the American public has
been told over and over again that
we are bombing only military
targets, we have killed, wounded,
or made homeless well over nine
million civilians â€” not including
North Vietnamese who are
supposed to be our enemies. You
may want to write off those nine
million as only "the fortunes of
war", but a figure like that
doesn't come from bombing only
military targets.
As if the air war needed any
more detriments, here is where
some of your tax money is going.
One B-52 mission costs $41,000.
You pay $100,000 for every truck
destroyed on the Ho Chi Minh
Trail. In 1972, you will give $337
million to maintain the South
Vietnamese air force as the sixth

largest in the world. For 1971, the
air war alone, excluding ground
expenditures, cost you $7.64
million a day.

Nixon administration is 130,000 a
month. The number of attack
carriers in the Gulf of Tonkin has
increased from two to three, and a
fourth is on the way, each with a
capacity of 75 combat aircraft.
Two-thirds of Laos, three-fourths
of Cambodia, all of North
Vietnam, and much of South
Vietnam are now what are called
"free-fire zones".
Basically, what that means is
that if anything moves at any time
of the night or day in well over
two-thirds of Indochina it is
subject to American bombing. At
the current rate we are dropping
4000 pounds of bombs a minute
over Indochina.
Replacement
What has happened, in effect,
is a replacement rather than a
withdrawal. We have increased our
involvement in an air war while
publicizing the withdrawal of
ground troops. If anything, our
involvement is deeper. The air war
is not limited to national
boundaries. It was an issue when
ground troops crossed the
Cambodian border, but in 1971
alone bombers flew silently over
the borders to drop 90,000 tons
of bombs in Cambodia.
In the same year they dropped
445,000 tons of bombs on CIA
picked targets in Laos. Most of
those bombers came from our five
air bases in Thailand, which is the
heart of the air war with 32,000
U.S. military personal and over
200 attack bombers (as of
January, 1972).
It is not simply the physical
spread of the air war that steeps
our involvement, it is the way an
air war is fought. No matter what
you might think about American
ground troops, there are not many
who do the kind of thing Calley

was purported to have done. A
man on the ground can
discriminate between a combatant
and a civilian.
A bomber flying at 30,000 feet
cannot, nor does a fighter diving
at 500 miles per hour. Bombers
are not part of the public
conscience. If an infantry platoon
slaughters a village, that's a no-no,
but if an F-4 does it with a
canister of napalm or seething
white phosphorous it's ok.
'Military'
The administration has claimed
that our targets are only
"military". If so, then it is resting
on the assumption that the
two-thirds of Indochina it has
proclaimed to be a free-fire zone
is occupied by only military
personal. That seems to be a
somewhat grandiose estimate of
the size of the communist armies.
Nevertheless, we bomb these
areas constantly. In Laos alone
our bombing has left 100,000
civilians dead, 250,000 wounded,
and a million homeless. In
committing ourselves to this kind
of tactic we have made ourselves
the enemy of the whole society
and culture of Indochina, and not
just the troops and guerrillas.
Likewise, we buy ourselves
more enemies. From 1961-64, the
Viet Cong recruited an average of
a little over 35,000 a year. In
1965, the first year of intensive
U.S. bombing, they recruited
120,000.
Postpone
For every month and year that
the air war continues we increase
the number of American POWs
and postpone their release. Since
the Nixon administration took
office we have had a flier captured
or missing in action at the rate of
one every three days. This will
continue and talk about
negotiating a prisoner release is
only empty rhetoric as long as
America keeps up its

bombardment of Indochina.
The administration is
somewhat less vocal about its
expansion of the air war than it is
about the withdrawal of ground
forces. Before 1969, seventy
percent of the bombing tonnage
fell in South Vietnam. Since then,
two-thirds of the tonnage has
fallen in other Indochinese
countries. To squelch this kind of
publicity newsmen are forbidden
to go on bombing raids outside of
South Vietnam and only a few
journalists are allowed on the big
Thai airbases from which the vast
majority of the strikes against
Laos, Cambodia, and North
Vietnam are flown.
This would not seem so strange
if those same newsmen didn't
have almost free access to bases
and pilots in South Vietnam who
fly only in-country missions. A
great deal of the target picking
and the ground combat role in
Laos has been turned over to the
CIA, which is virtually not
responsible to anyone for their
actions.
Homeless
While the American public has
been told over and over again that
we are bombing only military
targets, we have killed, wounded,
or made homeless well over nine
million civilians â€” not including
North Vietnamese who are
supposed to be our enemies. You
may want to write off those nine
million as only "the fortunes of
war", but a figure like that
doesn't come from bombing only
military targets.
As if the air war needed any
more detriments, here is where
some of your tax money is going.
One B-52 mission costs $41,000.
You pay $100,000 for every truck
destroyed on the Ho Chi Minh
Trail. In 1972, you will give $337
million to maintain the South
Vietnamese air force as the sixth

largest in the world. For 1971, the
air war alone, excluding ground
expenditures, cost you $7.64
million a day.

I spent enough time wandering
around the jungles of Vietnam to
know that "immediate"
withdrawal is nothing more than a
very pleasant dream. Given the
size of our military operations in
Indochina, withdrawal will
necessarily be a slow process.
Such a withdrawal was the
campaign promise of the Nixon
administration, and on the surface
a promise that appears to have
been kept through the
ahead-6f-schedule withdrawal of
American ground forces. In
conjunction with the ground
withdrawal we have had created
for us the image of air power
being used only as a protective
device.
It is an image that war-weary
America wants to believe, and
consequently does.
Unfortunately, it is an image only,
we are doing much more than just
protecting our troops What has
been called a "withdrawal" is in
fact only a different kind, and
much more terrible, offensive. It
is an air war. It is a war of low
visibility to the American public
because fewer Americans .are
directly involved.
Nevertheless, it is a war that is
much more total and
devastatingly more destructive
than the ground war could ever
have been. Most importantly, it is
not 'winding down'. It is only
beginning.
Facts
Here are some facts. More
bombs have been dropped over
Indochina in the three years of
the Nixon administration than
were dropped from 1962-69.
When the war was 'hot' in 1968,
there were under 200,000 tons of
bombs dropped on the Ho Chi
Minh Trail. The 1971 figure is
over 375,000 tons. The number of
civilians killed, wounded, and
refugeed under the Johnson

administration was 95,000 a
month.

and a civilian.
A bomber flying at 30,000 feet
cannot, nor does a fighter diving
at 500 miles per hour. Bombers
are not part of the public
conscience. If an infantry platoon
slaughters a village, that's a no-no,
but if an F-4 does it with a
canister of napalm or seething
white phosphorous it's ok.
'Military'
The administration has claimed
that our targets are only
"military". If so, then it is resting
on the assumption that the
two-thirds of Indochina it has
proclaimed to be a free-fire zone
is occupied by only military
personal. That seems to be a
somewhat grandiose estimate of
the size of the communist armies.
Nevertheless, we bomb these
areas constantly. In Laos alone
our bombing has left 100,000
civilians dead, 250,000 wounded,
and a million homeless. In
committing ourselves to this kind
of tactic we have made ourselves
the enemy of the whole society
and culture of Indochina, and not
just the troops and guerrillas.
Likewise, we buy ourselves
more enemies. From 1961-64, the
Viet Cong recruited an average of
a little over 35,000 a year. In
1965, the first year of intensive
U.S. bombing, they recruited
120,000.
Postpone
For every month and year that
the air war continues we increase
the number of American POWs
and postpone their release. Since
the Nixon administration took
office we have had a flier captured
or missing in action at the rate of
one every three days. This will
continue and talk about
negotiating a prisoner release is
only empty rhetoric as long as
America keeps up its

bombardment of Indochina.
The administration is
somewhat less vocal about its
expansion of the air war than it is
about the withdrawal of ground
forces. Before 1969, seventy
percent of the bombing tonnage
fell in South Vietnam. Since then,
two-thirds of the tonnage has
fallen in other Indochinese
countries. To squelch this kind of
publicity newsmen are forbidden
to go on bombing raids outside of
South Vietnam and only a few
journalists are allowed on the big
Thai airbases from which the vast
majority of the strikes against
Laos, Cambodia, and North
Vietnam are flown.
This would not seem so strange
if those same newsmen didn't
have almost free access to bases
and pilots in South Vietnam who
fly only in-country missions. A
great deal of the target picking
and the ground combat role in
Laos has been turned over to the
CIA, which is virtually not
responsible to anyone for their
actions.
Homeless
While the American public has
been told over and over again that
we are bombing only military
targets, we have killed, wounded,
or made homeless well over nine
million civilians â€” not including
North Vietnamese who are
supposed to be our enemies. You
may want to write off those nine
million as only "the fortunes of
war", but a figure like that
doesn't come from bombing only
military targets.
As if the air war needed any
more detriments, here is where
some of your tax money is going.
One B-52 mission costs $41,000.
You pay $100,000 for every truck
destroyed on the Ho Chi Minh
Trail. In 1972, you will give $337
million to maintain the South
Vietnamese air force as the sixth

largest in the world. For 1971, the
air war alone, excluding ground
expenditures, cost you $7.64
million a day.

I spent enough time wandering
around the jungles of Vietnam to
know that "immediate"
withdrawal is nothing more than a
very pleasant dream. Given the
size of our military operations in
Indochina, withdrawal will
necessarily be a slow process.
Such a withdrawal was the
campaign promise of the Nixon
administration, and on the surface
a promise that appears to have
been kept through the
ahead-6f-schedule withdrawal of
American ground forces. In
conjunction with the ground
withdrawal we have had created
for us the image of air power
being used only as a protective
device.
It is an image that war-weary
America wants to believe, and
consequently does.
Unfortunately, it is an image only,
we are doing much more than just
protecting our troops What has
been called a "withdrawal" is in
fact only a different kind, and
much more terrible, offensive. It
is an air war. It is a war of low
visibility to the American public
because fewer Americans .are
directly involved.
Nevertheless, it is a war that is
much more total and
devastatingly more destructive
than the ground war could ever
have been. Most importantly, it is
not 'winding down'. It is only
beginning.
Facts
Here are some facts. More
bombs have been dropped over
Indochina in the three years of
the Nixon administration than
were dropped from 1962-69.
When the war was 'hot' in 1968,
there were under 200,000 tons of
bombs dropped on the Ho Chi
Minh Trail. The 1971 figure is
over 375,000 tons. The number of
civilians killed, wounded, and
refugeed under the Johnson

administration was 95,000 a
month.
The average civilian toll for the
Nixon administration is 130,000 a
month. The number of attack
carriers in the Gulf of Tonkin has
increased from two to three, and a
fourth is on the way, each with a
capacity of 75 combat aircraft.
Two-thirds of Laos, three-fourths
of Cambodia, all of North
Vietnam, and much of South
Vietnam are now what are called
"free-fire zones".
Basically, what that means is
that if anything moves at any time
of the night or day in well over
two-thirds of Indochina it is
subject to American bombing. At
the current rate we are dropping
4000 pounds of bombs a minute
over Indochina.
Replacement
What has happened, in effect,
is a replacement rather than a
withdrawal. We have increased our
involvement in an air war while
publicizing the withdrawal of
ground troops. If anything, our
involvement is deeper. The air war
is not limited to national
boundaries. It was an issue when
ground troops crossed the
Cambodian border, but in 1971
alone bombers flew silently over
the borders to drop 90,000 tons
of bombs in Cambodia.
In the same year they dropped
445,000 tons of bombs on CIA
picked targets in Laos. Most of
those bombers came from our five
air bases in Thailand, which is the
heart of the air war with 32,000
U.S. military personal and over
200 attack bombers (as of
January, 1972).
It is not simply the physical
spread of the air war that steeps
our involvement, it is the way an
air war is fought. No matter what
you might think about American
ground troops, there are not many
who do the kind of thing Calley

was purported to have done. A
man on the ground can
discriminate between a combatant
and a civilian.
A bomber flying at 30,000 feet
cannot, nor does a fighter diving
at 500 miles per hour. Bombers

expansion of the air war than it is
about the withdrawal of ground
forces. Before 1969, seventy
percent of the bombing tonnage
fell in South Vietnam. Since then,
two-thirds of the tonnage has
fallen in other Indochinese
countries. To squelch this kind of
publicity newsmen are forbidden
to go on bombing raids outside of
South Vietnam and only a few
journalists are allowed on the big
Thai airbases from which the vast
majority of the strikes against
Laos, Cambodia, and North
Vietnam are flown.
This would not seem so strange
if those same newsmen didn't
have almost free access to bases
and pilots in South Vietnam who
fly only in-country missions. A
great deal of the target picking
and the ground combat role in
Laos has been turned over to the
CIA, which is virtually not
responsible to anyone for their
actions.
Homeless
While the American public has
been told over and over again that
we are bombing only military
targets, we have killed, wounded,
or made homeless well over nine
million civilians â€” not including
North Vietnamese who are
supposed to be our enemies. You
may want to write off those nine
million as only "the fortunes of
war", but a figure like that
doesn't come from bombing only
military targets.
As if the air war needed any
more detriments, here is where
some of your tax money is going.
One B-52 mission costs $41,000.
You pay $100,000 for every truck
destroyed on the Ho Chi Minh
Trail. In 1972, you will give $337
million to maintain the South
Vietnamese air force as the sixth

largest in the world. For 1971, the
air war alone, excluding ground
expenditures, cost you $7.64
million a day.
