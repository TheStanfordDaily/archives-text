Vice-President Spiro T. Agnew
is coming tq Palo Alto tomorrow
to speak to the California
Republican Assembly. To show
why thousands of people are
going to make Agnew answer for
his crimes of justifying,
propounding, and rationalizing
genocide and racism inside and
outside America, it is necessary to
get to the root of those crimes.
A key foreshadowing to the
Nixon Doctrine of pulling out the
troops from Southeast Asia while
heightening the bombing of North
Vietnam and Laos can be seen in
Agnew's statements, "We can't
win a ground war in Asia" (Face
the Nation, May 3, 1970), and
"our policy is neither one of
gradual withdrawal nor of
unwarranted intervention in Asian
affairs.
As a Pacific power we will
remain in the Pacific." (Canberra,
January 14, 1970). It is essential
to understand the actuality of
these remarks, which results in the
use of anti-personnel cluster- and
guava-bombs designed to tear the
limbs off Vietnamese people,
cripple them psychologically,
defeat their morale, and extend
the War as long as possible.
What should be done with
people of color or whites who
oppose the Nixon Doctrine at
home? According to Agnew, they
should be cut off from society
"with no more regret than we
should feel over discarding rotten

apples from a barrel" (Harrisburg,
June 31, 1969). Continuing on
the same line, he stated,
. . we're always going to have a
certain number of people in our
community who have no desire to
acheive or who have no desire to
even fit in an amicable way with
the rest of society.
Separated
And these people should be
separated from the community,
not in a callous way, but they
should be separated as far as any
idea that their opinions should
have any affect on the course we
follow." (London, July 1970).
What is a non-"callous" way of
"discarding rotten apples from a
barrel?" By murdering them, or
sterilizing them and taking their
kids away, or having them kicked
off the faculties of universities
(Bruce Franklin)? According to
Agnew, all of these ways are
justified and even desirable.
Regarding the Attica prisoners'
revolt, Agnew spouted, "To
compare the loss of life by those
who violate society's law with the
loss of life by those whose job it is
to uphold it represents not simply
an assault on human sensibility
but an insult to reason."
(Washington, September 17,
1971).
Spiro T. Agnew is thus largely
responsible for this and other
forms of violence perpetrated
against a people that has been
brutalized for 400 years and will

be no longer.
How should society deal with
the oppressed peoples of the
world? Make sure that they either
never come into existence or that
they grow up in "good homes,"
according to Agnew. Speaking on
"skyrocketing welfare costs"
before the Governors' Conference
in Sacramento, January 14, 1971,
Agnew said that the Government
must decide "sooner or later"
whether it should take away the
children of unfit welfare mothers:
Theory
"I have a theory that these
problems will never be subject to
complete solution until somebody
in public life is willing to take on
the hard social judgments that
very frankly no one that I know
in elective office is willing to even
think about.
"If a woman has not taken care
of her children properly, who is
going to say to that woman, "We
are going to take that child away
from you — the natural mother —
and put that child somewhere
where it will receive proper care.
"Who is going to say to a
welfare mother who has three or
four illegitimate children who are
now charges of the state, "We're
very sorry but we will not be able
to allow you to have any more
children?"
Agnew of course found that
"somebody in public life," — no
less than Governor Ronald
Reagan. Chairman Robert
Mitchell of the California Social
Welfare Board, appointed by
Reagan to serve as an advisory
panel to the State Department of
Social Welfare, asserted that
"... a woman does not have the
right to have as many illegitimate
children as she chooses . . . that is
not normal in our society and it is
not acceptable to our society."
Once again we are faced with a
Governemtn that is supposed to
protect the rights of its citizens,
instead of conceiving ways it can
take away those rights and the
millions spent on welfare (poor
and working people have to pay

out more in taxes to the
Government than they get back in
welfare — see Up Against the
American Myth, p. 136), while at
the same time billions are being
spent on the "defense" of our
foreign investment all over the
world and especially in Southeast
Asia. And once again we find
Agnew's genocidal, racist theories
reaching their endpoint in the
physical and psychological
destruction of Third World
people.
"... when a Panther leader
vows to 'chop off the head' of a
United States Senator, another
threatens to 'slit every throat that
threatens our freedom,' the seeds
of violence are sown and
flourish." (September, 1971).
Agnew pays no attention, of
course, to the real violence of
property laws in the U.S., which
can send a man to prison at five
years to life for stealing 70
dollars. Those laws keep Agnew
and his class in power.
It was for supposedly
advocating (based on no evidence)
violence to property that Bruce
Franklin was fired from the
faculty. But how can two Black
Panthers or Bruce Franklin be
compared with the incitement to
violence provided by Agnew, who
has thousands of police, national
guardsmen, and armed forces at
his disposal?
This article shouldn't be
reduced down to the often-heard
solution of silencing "extremists"
on both sides, however. What it
comes down to is this: either you
side with Agnew's policies of
racism, genocide, and violent
oppression, or you side with the
Peace Union, the Committee for
Just Rewards for Agnew, Bruce
Franklin (Venceremos), and the
United Farm Workers Organizing
Committee, etc.; all those who are
struggling for a world in which
each person is able to develop his
abilities to the fullest.

Venceremos and the Committee
