# Students To Vote On Funds For Public Interest Law Firm
## 
### 
"Stanford students in the past have
demanded the right to affect society,
and now we're giving them the chance
to do it," asserts law student Leslie
Kratter, President of Citizens
Advocates at Stanford.
In order to do this, Citizens
Advocates is asking $15 from each
Stanford student over the next three
years to establish a student-controlled
public interest law firm.
The group's request is the largest of
several fee assessment proposals on the
ballot in Wednesday and Thursday's
ASSU election. The refundable
assessment is $2 for Fall and
Spring quarters and $1 for Winter and
Summer.
A broad definition of a public
interest law firm, according to Kratter,
is one which "brings suits that will
affect large numbers of persons rather
than any individual interest," in such
areas as consumer protection, poverty
law, the environment, civil rights and
sex discrimination.
Kratter is one of about 10 law
students who began to organize
Citizens Advocates last fall. It was
recently established as a corporation in
California with its own bylaws,
independent of any University control.
No Services
Unlike most groups asking for fees
in the upcoming election, Citizens
Advocates does not claim to provide
services of any kind directly to the
student body, legal or otherwise.
Instead the firm aims to draw upon
"the broad-based, concerned and
active constituency" of Stanford to do
research on public interest cases,
according to its campaign literature.

They claim some of the most
"effective, significant, and successful
efforts on behalf of the public
interest," have come from
university-based organizations.
A recent editorial in the Stanford
Chaparral criticized the firm for having
what it called a "miniscule" amount of
student involvement.
Kratter characterizes this criticism
as "not legitimate" and adds that there
is "more than enough room to work"
for a large number of students,
depending on their willingness.
Many projects which require a great
deal of research through sampling
techniques could use the help of many
students, he asserts.
Citizens Advocates should not
develop into a legal aid society,
Kratter thinks, since these groups deal
with the cases of individual persons
and have little time for public interest
or legal reform work.
Mandate
The firm's mandate, he feels, is to
pursue cases that determine a point of
law or change a business or
government agency's policy, when a
large number of people will be
affected.
The firm, however, cannot lobby
on specific political issues at the state
legislature or take part in political
campaigns. There is no hindrance to
taking on Stanford itself, Kratter says,
except that the University is
responsible for collecting the firm's
fees.
Stanford has given the group its
tacit approval, but rejected the
possibility of the firm using a name
such as "Stanford Advocates."

The firm is campaigning heavily on
its promise to make the fees
refundable at the start of each quarter,
but as of last week the means for
giving refunds had not yet been
settled.
Citizens Advocates originally stated
a two-thirds majority was necessary
for passing their proposal, but the
chairman of the ASSU Senate has
ruled that a simple majority is
adequate, since the fee is refundable.
Half Student Fees
A refund mechanism proposed by
the firm was agreed to by the
Administration, but was turned down
by the ASSU Senate which asked the
ASSU financial manager to develop a
method satisfactory to him.
Their proposed budget for next
year is $75,000, and they predict that
about half of this will come from the
student fees, after refunds. They are
placing their faith in support from
foundations and contributors who will
see the student vote as an indication of
student support. But they have no
firm commitments for the outside
money.
Control of the organization and the
choice of cases it will handle will rest
with a board of directors; four
students elected by the student body,
two law students elected by their
peers, as well as five others from
Stanford and the outside community.
Four of these have been chosen.

A favorable vote on the fee
assessment will put candidates for the
board's student seats on the ballot in
the following week's runoff election.

at Legal Aid, in the Law School.
Several other universities have
attempted to organize similar public
interest law firms. A group at the
University of California in Berkeley
has already issued two reports in its
first year, despite a lack of student
funding.
Berkeley students voted to give
$4.50 each year to the organization,
but the funding was not approved by
the U.C. Board of Regents at a recent
meeting. However, Barbara Bourhis,

Co-director of the Public Interest Law
Center, feels there is a "strong
possibility" they will get their money
when the Regents meet this May.
