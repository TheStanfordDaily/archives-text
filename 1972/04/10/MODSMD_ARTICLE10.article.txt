## No Compulsory Assessments 
### 
-Miiichael fancher

We suggest that students vote
No on those proposed fee
assessments, such as ASSU Special
Events and KZSU, which do not
provide the opportunity for those
who do not perceive benefit from
these programs to get their money
back. We oppose them for the
same reasons that we have
opposed other fee assessments this
year: no one should be forced by
majority vote to "give" money to
any organization, no matter who

is involved or the amount of
money they want.
In addition to arguments based
on the principle of voluntarism,
we have specific objections to the
two proposals mentioned above.
Two years ago Special Events was
voted a $1 assessment, supposedly
for one time only, in order to
establish a self-replenishing fund
for financing entertainment
events.
However, Special Events has
1

lost money with its programs, and
now wants more money. In our
opinion, students should find
alternate ways of bringing
entertainment to Stanford
without placing more money in
the less-than-capable hands of
Special Events.
KZSU is more difficult to
criticize, as it has done a generally
creditable job in its broadcasting.
But station management has
accounted for only $15,000 of
the $36,000 they hope for. The
rest, evidently, is gravyâ€”which
should be obtained by soliciting
funds instead of compelling them.
Those assessments with the
negative option clause should and
will be decided by the individual
student. While the current
refunding system is not ideal, it is
a long step toward guaranteeing
individual choice.

Voluntarists.)
