# Conservative Convention Here
## Reagan Praises Nixon 
### LARRY LIEBERT News Analysis 
Governor Ronald Reagan faced
the challenge Saturday night of
convincing some of California's
most conservative Republicans
that there is not really a "New
Nixon."
Along the way, he asserted that
President Nixon would have
defied any attempt by the
Supreme Court to block the
Amchitka nuclear test last
November.
The staunchly conservative
members of the powerful
California Republican Assembly
(CRA) were wildly thrilled to
have the Governor as a surprise
dinner guest at their Palo Alto
convention.
Reagan and former Deputy
Defense Secretary David Packard
substituted at dinner for Spiro
Agnew, who switched his speech
to noon to avoid protests outside
the Cabana Hyatt House Hotel.
But despite a resounding
welcoming ovation, Reagan had to
push hard to convince the crowd
the Nixon who went to China is
the same right-winger he used to
be.
Conservative Secrets
"Many Republicans are
disturbed and in disagreement
with the policies of the last four
years," Reagan conceded. But,
lobbying for the CRA's
endorsement of Nixon, the
Governor let drop a few
conservative secrets which he said
Nixon revealed to him "in the
Oval Office of the White House."
Nixon would have defied the
Supreme Court, Reagan alleged, if
it had ordered a halt to the
Amchitka nuclear test because of
a suit by ecologists.
Reagan said that Nixon told
him before the blast, "Even if the
Supreme Court says I cannot do
it, I have determined it is my duty
as Commander-in-Chief, and I'm

going to do it anyway."
As for controls on the
economy, Reagan said the
President views them as "bitter
medicine" and is determined that
the controls will remain
"jerrybuilt and temporary."
Responding to conservative
fears over the China trip, Reagan
said Nixon told him that if
Taiwan is attacked by force in the
future, "We protect and defend
Taiwan. There is no change."
Minimizing the China trip,
Reagan said that if a Democratic
President is elected in November,
he will go to China to "sell away
rights and freedoms"—not just "to
have a Chinese dish and open
communication."
Massive Air Power
Reagan urged a letter-writing
campaign, asking Nixon to use
massive air power "to the fullest
extent possible on any and all
targets in North Vietnam" in the
face of the current Communist
offensive.
He joked that Democratic
Presidential contender "Muskie
has a two-point plan of his
own—bug out now, and the last
man out shoots Thieu."
Although some of Nixon's
actions may have seemed
"anathema to conservative
ideals," Reagan warned that if
Republicans fail to unite behind
Nixon, "We may get someone
who will cross us on everything."
Reagan's call for unity,
combined with Agnew's
appearance, paid off yesterday
morning in the CRA's
overwhelming endorsement of
Nixon. The only disappointment
in the audience during Reagan's
forceful speech came from
supporters of strongly-conserva
tive Republican candidate John
Ashbrook. The Ashbrook
supporters realized that Reagan
had killed off Ashbrook's last
hopes of blocking a Nixon
endorsement.

An Ashbrook delegate from
Lafayette said in her bitter
Southern drawl, "They had
Reagan speak because they knew
we were doing well. And Agnew
helped too, even though he didn't
say nothing."
But most of the dinner crowd
was cheerful throughout, from the
opening flag salute by a Fremont
Boy Scout troop through the
closing speech by Packard.
Packard, a former Stanford
trustee, has returned to
Hewlett-Packard Electronics after
three years at the Pentagon. As
Nixon's Bay Area campaign
chairman, he made a final pitch
for Nixon support.
He assured the crowd that
Nixon is a strong supporter of
Defense Department projects. He
broke the news that "we no
longer live in a bipolar world" and
said that negotiations with
Communist nations are important
to "blunt as many points of
friction as possible."
But, assuring the conservatives
that Nixon will negotiate from a
position of strength, Packard
added, "Let me make clear that
negotiation is not a code word for
capitulation. It does not suppose
that all Communist states have
metamorphosized into lambs. I
think it is a little silly to imagine
that Richard Nixon could fall
prey to such fantasies."
As Packard justified cuts in
Defense expenditures, the crowd
clapped and whistled
appreciatively when he announced
that electronic sensing devices
have reduced the cost of a $15
million bombing raid to only
$600,000.
In a section of his prepared
text which he failed to read,
Packard applauded "America's
support of Pakistan in the
Indo-Pakistan War." Government
officials have never publicly
conceded that the U.S. backed
Pakistan.

in the audience during Reagan's
forceful speech came from
supporters of strongly-conserva
tive Republican candidate John
Ashbrook. The Ashbrook
supporters realized that Reagan
had killed off Ashbrook's last
hopes of blocking a Nixon
endorsement.

An Ashbrook delegate from
Lafayette said in her bitter
Southern drawl, "They had
Reagan speak because they knew
we were doing well. And Agnew
helped too, even though he didn't
say nothing."
But most of the dinner crowd
was cheerful throughout, from the
opening flag salute by a Fremont
Boy Scout troop through the
closing speech by Packard.
Packard, a former Stanford
trustee, has returned to
Hewlett-Packard Electronics after
three years at the Pentagon. As
Nixon's Bay Area campaign
chairman, he made a final pitch
for Nixon support.
He assured the crowd that
Nixon is a strong supporter of
Defense Department projects. He
broke the news that "we no
longer live in a bipolar world" and
said that negotiations with
Communist nations are important
to "blunt as many points of
friction as possible."
But, assuring the conservatives
that Nixon will negotiate from a
position of strength, Packard
added, "Let me make clear that
negotiation is not a code word for
capitulation. It does not suppose
that all Communist states have
metamorphosized into lambs. I
think it is a little silly to imagine
that Richard Nixon could fall
prey to such fantasies."
As Packard justified cuts in
Defense expenditures, the crowd
clapped and whistled
appreciatively when he announced
that electronic sensing devices
have reduced the cost of a $15
million bombing raid to only
$600,000.
In a section of his prepared
text which he failed to read,
Packard applauded "America's
support of Pakistan in the
Indo-Pakistan War." Government
officials have never publicly
conceded that the U.S. backed
Pakistan.
Governor Ronald Reagan faced
the challenge Saturday night of
convincing some of California's
most conservative Republicans
that there is not really a "New
Nixon."
Along the way, he asserted that
President Nixon would have
defied any attempt by the
Supreme Court to block the
Amchitka nuclear test last
November.
The staunchly conservative
members of the powerful
California Republican Assembly
(CRA) were wildly thrilled to
have the Governor as a surprise
dinner guest at their Palo Alto
convention.
Reagan and former Deputy
Defense Secretary David Packard
substituted at dinner for Spiro
Agnew, who switched his speech
to noon to avoid protests outside
the Cabana Hyatt House Hotel.
But despite a resounding
welcoming ovation, Reagan had to
push hard to convince the crowd
the Nixon who went to China is
the same right-winger he used to
be.
Conservative Secrets
"Many Republicans are
disturbed and in disagreement
with the policies of the last four
years," Reagan conceded. But,
lobbying for the CRA's
endorsement of Nixon, the
Governor let drop a few
conservative secrets which he said
Nixon revealed to him "in the
Oval Office of the White House."
Nixon would have defied the
Supreme Court, Reagan alleged, if
it had ordered a halt to the
Amchitka nuclear test because of
a suit by ecologists.
Reagan said that Nixon told
him before the blast, "Even if the
Supreme Court says I cannot do
it, I have determined it is my duty
as Commander-in-Chief, and I'm

going to do it anyway."
As for controls on the
economy, Reagan said the
President views them as "bitter
medicine" and is determined that
the controls will remain
"jerrybuilt and temporary."
Responding to conservative
fears over the China trip, Reagan
said Nixon told him that if
Taiwan is attacked by force in the
future, "We protect and defend
Taiwan. There is no change."
Minimizing the China trip,
Reagan said that if a Democratic
President is elected in November,
he will go to China to "sell away
rights and freedoms"—not just "to
have a Chinese dish and open
communication."
Massive Air Power
Reagan urged a letter-writing
campaign, asking Nixon to use
massive air power "to the fullest
extent possible on any and all
targets in North Vietnam" in the
face of the current Communist
offensive.
He joked that Democratic
Presidential contender "Muskie
has a two-point plan of his
own—bug out now, and the last
man out shoots Thieu."
Although some of Nixon's
actions may have seemed
"anathema to conservative
ideals," Reagan warned that if
Republicans fail to unite behind
Nixon, "We may get someone
who will cross us on everything."
Reagan's call for unity,
combined with Agnew's
appearance, paid off yesterday
morning in the CRA's
overwhelming endorsement of
Nixon. The only disappointment
