# Ashbrook Accuses Nixon Of 'Move To The Left'
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Rep. John Ashbrook
(R-Ohio), bringing his campaign
for the Republican Presidential
nomination to Stanford Friday
night, accused President Nixon of
"a move to the left" in his
policies.
Ashbrook, the conservative
from Ohio who is Nixon's only
active challenger for the
Republican nomination, told an
audience of about 100 in the
Graduate School of Business that
"I seem to be the only voice
raised in protest" to Nixon.
Ashbrook, in Palo Alto for the
weekend convention of the
California Republican Assembly
(CRA), asserted that he is "a
serious candidate" for the
nomination, and pleaded with the
group to "send a message" of
disapproval to the nation's
leadership.
He told reporters that
"anything in the 25-40 percent
range (in the June 6 California
primary) would be an obvious
signal to the San Diego
convention that the President is in
trouble."
Far to Go
The Ohio congressman
conceded that he has "a long way
to go" to win the nomination,
but, he told the Daily, "I think
it's possible . . . the front-runner
often goes limp. Look at Sen.
Muskie."
In the March New Hampshire
primary, the first in the nation,
Ashbrook and liberal Rep. Paul
McCloskey of California both
challenged Nixon. There,
Ashbrook pulled in just 10
percent of the vote; McCloskey
captured 20 percent, but pulled
out of the race.
Since then, the President has
swept through the primaries,
climaxing with a 97 percent
showing in Wisconsin over
Ashbrook.
Friday night, Ashbrook said
that he was disappointed tht
McCloskey had left the race,
saying that the Califoniian "was
saying many of the same things
I'm saying."
Nixon A Democrat?
In his campus appearance,
sponsored by the Stanford Young
Republicans Club, he scored
Nixon for "doing exactly what
the Democrats would have done"
had they won the 1968 election.
How, he asked, could the GOP
criticize a Democratic
administration for deficit
spending and then "sweep our

differences under the rug" when a
Republican administration
increases the deficit?
He said it was a case of "the
Republicans viewing with alarm
when the Democrats are in power,
and pointing with pride when the
Republicans are in power."
Ashbrook also came down hard
on Nixon's plan for a guaranteed
national income, and advocated
dividing welfare programs into
three categories: 1) aid to the
physically disabled; 2) aid to the
unemployed; and 3) aid to welfare
families.
Welfare Hit
"Something has to be done to
break the welfare cycle of families
that grow and grow," he declared,
adding that he might make "the
government the employer of last
resort" for workers in the second
category.
He said that Nixon's stands
threatened the two-party system
by creating "a Democratic Party
A and a Democratic Party B . . . .
I stand for two distinct parties."
In the area of foreign policy,
Ashbrook likened what he termed
"a spirit of appeasement in this
country" to the spirit of Europe
in the 1930'5, and accused Nixon
of creating a "security gap."
There is no arms race, he said,
because "right now the Soviets are
the only ones running, while we're
standing still. I don't call that a
race ... it's a one-man contest."
He did, however, call for troop
withdrawals from Europe and,
"with some reservations," for an
end to the draft.
Bombing Support
Ashbrook said he supported
Nixon's decision to increase the
bombing of North Vietnam in
response to recent Vietnam
offensive, but blasted the
President's trip to Red China.

"We have undermined our
position by pulling the rug out
from under a friend by
announcing a policy change on
the soil of a sworn enemy," he
told the Daily. He said that the
"direct and honorable way" to
affect such a change would have
been to go to Taiwan and confer
with Chiang Kai-shek before
making any decision.
In response to a question from
the audience, Ashbrook denied
that his candidacy has been tacitly
supported by the White House to
make Nixon look more moderate.
"I am not a dupe of Henry
Kissinger. In no way is my
candidacy supported by anyone in
the Nixon camp. ... I am not a
ploy of anyone."
Later he told the Daily that he
did not feel his candidacy would
split the Republican Party,
because "the split was already
there. The split was brought about
by the policies and actions of the
Nixon administration."
He implied that he might not
support Nixon should the
President win re-nomination.
"When I announced my
candidacy, I said I would not be a
member of a third or fourth party
movement, but I said I would also
not blindly follow Richard
Nixon."
He said that he could foresee
no circumstances under which he
might vote for any Democrat this
year, including Gov. George
Wallace, whom Ashbrook said is
"not a conservative, but a
big-government populist."
He declined to estimate the
number of votes he might receive
in the California primary election,
but said, "It's like everything else:
there's a one-pound hammer, a
five-pound hammer, and a
10-pound hammer."
