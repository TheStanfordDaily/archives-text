The appellate division of the
Santa Clara County Superior
Court recently reversed the
probation revocation of a former
Stanford radical who wrote a
controversial column which
appeared in the Daily two years
ago.
Diarmuid McGuire, a member
of the Bay Area Revolutionary
Union when he wrote the column,
entitled "Snitches and
Oppression," originally was
sentenced to an extra 30 days in
county jail on charges of
disturbing the peace for writing
the column while on probation.
"Snitches and Oppressibn"
seemingly advocated that two
then-students, both well-known
conservatives, be beaten or
"punctured with sharp
instruments" for "snitching"
(informing) on members of the
radical community.
McGuire wrote the column,
which appeared on Oct. 2, 1970,
from the Elmswood
Rehabilitation Center, where he
was working off the original
30-day sentence he received on
charges of malicious mischief and
attempted malicious mischief for

his role in earlier campus
demonstrations.
"Snitches and Oppression,"
which President Richard Lyman
branded a "journalistic atrocity,"
generated widespread debate
within the University community
and, at least indirectly, motivated
the present efforts aimed at
separating the Daily from the
ASSU and the University.
Over 250 members of the
Stanford community, led by
Biology Professor and Advisory
Board Chairman Donald Kennedy,
placed a full-page advertisement in
the Daily to condemn the paper's
publication of the column and to
ask that careful consideration be
given to severing the paper's
connections with the University.
McGuire told the Daily that he
already has served 15 of the
additional 30 days of sentence. He
was released from jail pending
appeal.
Because of the appeals court
ruling, he cannot be returned to
jail on the disturbing the peace
charge. However, his lawyer says
that the ruling leaves open the
possibility that his probation
again may be revoked for other
charges including interfering with
justice, intimidating witnesses and
criminal libel.
The two former students
named in the article never filed
suit against the Daily or McGuire.
David Weinberg, McGuire's
attorney, told the Daily last week
that the district attorney's office
"will be free to proceed on other
grounds" but that he does not
expect further action in the case.
McGuire, who now works as an
odd-jobsman in Redwood City,
said that he left Venceremos,
another revolutionary
organization, about a year ago and
now is trying to resume his career
as a journalist. McGuire was a
student here in the Department of
Communications and formerly
worked for the Daily and
"Newsweek" magazine.

again may be revoked for other
charges including interfering with
justice, intimidating witnesses and
criminal libel.
The two former students
named in the article never filed
suit against the Daily or McGuire.
David Weinberg, McGuire's
attorney, told the Daily last week
that the district attorney's office
"will be free to proceed on other
grounds" but that he does not
expect further action in the case.
McGuire, who now works as an
odd-jobsman in Redwood City,
said that he left Venceremos,
another revolutionary
organization, about a year ago and
now is trying to resume his career
as a journalist. McGuire was a
student here in the Department of
Communications and formerly
worked for the Daily and
"Newsweek" magazine.
The appellate division of the
Santa Clara County Superior
Court recently reversed the
probation revocation of a former
Stanford radical who wrote a
controversial column which
appeared in the Daily two years
ago.
Diarmuid McGuire, a member
of the Bay Area Revolutionary
Union when he wrote the column,
entitled "Snitches and
Oppression," originally was
sentenced to an extra 30 days in
county jail on charges of
disturbing the peace for writing
the column while on probation.
"Snitches and Oppressibn"
seemingly advocated that two
then-students, both well-known
conservatives, be beaten or
"punctured with sharp
instruments" for "snitching"
(informing) on members of the
radical community.
McGuire wrote the column,
which appeared on Oct. 2, 1970,
from the Elmswood
Rehabilitation Center, where he
was working off the original
30-day sentence he received on
charges of malicious mischief and
attempted malicious mischief for

his role in earlier campus
demonstrations.
"Snitches and Oppression,"
which President Richard Lyman
branded a "journalistic atrocity,"
generated widespread debate
within the University community
and, at least indirectly, motivated
the present efforts aimed at
separating the Daily from the
ASSU and the University.
Over 250 members of the
Stanford community, led by
Biology Professor and Advisory
Board Chairman Donald Kennedy,
placed a full-page advertisement in
the Daily to condemn the paper's
publication of the column and to
ask that careful consideration be
given to severing the paper's
connections with the University.
McGuire told the Daily that he
already has served 15 of the
additional 30 days of sentence. He
was released from jail pending
appeal.
Because of the appeals court
ruling, he cannot be returned to
jail on the disturbing the peace
charge. However, his lawyer says
that the ruling leaves open the
possibility that his probation
again may be revoked for other
charges including interfering with
justice, intimidating witnesses and
criminal libel.
