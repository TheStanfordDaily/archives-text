# Golfers Win Two Easy Matches
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford's undefeated golf
team continued its dominance
over dual match opponents this
weekend with two easy victories
on the Stanford course.
The Cards rolled past
University of Pacific 48-6 on
Friday afternoon and defeated a
strong Fresno State team 41-13
on Saturday. The two victories
improved Stanford's record to
5-0.
Captain Tom Keelin paced the
Indians against Pacific with a
scrambling one over par 72.
Keelin was four over par with five
holes to play but made clutch
birdies on three of the remaining

holes.
Dave Baskins carded a 75 while
Denny Colvin shot 76, Pete
Harpster had 78, Jim Dwulet shot
81, and Sandy McCall struggled to
an 84 after a horrendous 10 on
the par four 12th hole. McCall
still managed to win all six points
against his Pacific opponent.
Saturday's Fresno State match
was highlighted by Conrad
Nilmeier's one under par 70.
Nilmeier, whose home town is
Fresno, fashioned six birdies en
route to his second straight
outstanding round. He had fired a
71 earlier in the week in the
Cards' freshman victory over
Menlo College.

Baskins continued his steady
play with a 74 while Gary Vanier
shot 76, Keelin had 77, Bruce
Robertson shot 78, and Colvin
carded a 79
Stanford's vast array of talent
has been making Coach Bud
Finger's job of choosing a lineup
for each match a very difficult
one. Vanier, Keelin, Baskins,
Nilmeier, Robertson, and Aly
Trompas were in the Cards' lineup
for Stanford's first two major
tournaments but they are
currently being pressured by
several strong players.
Harpster Playing Well
Pete Harpster, an honorable

mention Ail-American last year,
has started to play some fine golf,
including a 71 last week against
Hawaii. Other challengers include
Colvin, Dennis Conrad, Dwulet,
McCall, Steve Collins, and
freshmen Mile McGowan and
George Pettinger.
McGowan and Pettinger will be
key players this afternoon as
Stanford's freshmen take on
College of San Mateo at 12:30
p.m. on the Stanford course. The
frosh now have a 5-0 record after
their 38-16 victory over Menlo
College last Tuesday. Menlo's
record dropped to 14-2, with both
losses coming against Stanford.
