# Netters Split In Southland
## 
### DAVID ANTONUCCIO 
The Stanford netmen
conquered defending NCAA
champion UCLA 5-4 on Friday to
break a fifty-three match winning
streak of Bruin tennis teams over
Cardinal squads. However, the
following day Stanford suffered a
disappointing loss at the hands of
Southern Cal by an identical score
of 5-4.
Stanford's premier racketman
Roscoe Tanner initiated a brilliant
weekend by downing Bruin's Jeff
Austin 6-3, 7-6. Sandy Mayer fell
to Junior Wimbledon Champion
Bob Kreiss and Chico Hagey
performed well though losing to
Mike Kreiss in the final set 7-5.
Hagey's match was the only one
requiring a third set all afternoon.
Rick Fisher defeated his
opponent while Paul Sidone lost
to Spencer Segura, son of all time
great, Pancho Segura. Gary
Groslimond won in the number
six position. The whole match
rested on number one doubles,
with the scored tied at four all,
after brothers Rick and Chip
Fisher lost to the duo of Austin
and Cornell, and Hagey and
Delaney defeated the doubles
combination of Segura and
Russell. The pressure was on the
doubles team of Tanner and
Mayer who came through in fine
style by putting away the Kreiss
brothers 7-6, 6-4.
The match against USC has to
rate as one of the most thrilling in
Stanford net history. The contest
consisted of three rounds. In the

first round the number two, four,
and six singles performed.
Sandy Mayer bounced back
from the previous day's defeat
and displayed excellent form as he
crushed the U.S. National Juniors
Champ, Raul Ramirez, 6-3, 6-1.
Rick Fisher lost to Mike Machette
in the third set, 6-2, while Gery
Groslimond fell to former Junior
Champ of India, Sashi Menon.
The score stood at 2-1 in favor of
use.
At this point, round two began
with numbers, one, three, and five
singles players competing. Roscoe
Tanner again showed great poise
while dumping Mexican Davis
Cupper Marcelo Lara 6-3, 6-4,
Card Freshman Chico Hagey
handily defeated the number 43
men's singles player in the U.S.,
Dick Bohrnstedt, 6-3, 6-4.
The Trojan's John Andrews
then downed Paul Sidone. With
the score tied at three all, this set
the stage for the doubles
competition.
The Fisher brothers were
defeated while Hagey and Delaney
triumphed. Again, as at UCLA, it
was all up to the doubles pair of
Tanner and Mayer who were
facing the powerful team of
Marcelo Lara and Raul Ramirez.
Tanner-Mayer split sets with
Lara-Ramirez to bring the match
down to the final set. The score
was 3-2 in this third set, in favor
of USC, when Trojan coach,
George Toley walked over to the
umpire and asked him to make an
announcement. The umpire then
made it known to the gallery that

the match was tied at four all and
the outcome of this set would
determine the winner.
At this announcement the
crowd came alive and began
responding to every point scored,
both good and bad shots, which is
unusual at most tennis matches.
This is where the home court
advantage really took over
although Stanford had a sizeable
crowd of its own. Lara and
Ramirez dropped one game but
won the final three and the
match.
The loss to USC was
disappointing but in no way
discouraging. Coach Dick Gould
was pleased with winning the top
three singles against such renowed
national players. The rematch on
April 21 on the Stanford courts
should prove to be an interesting
battle.

SHUTOUT KING—Bob DiPietro ran his scoreless streak to 28 innings against the Trojans last Friday when
he shut them out 2-0. He held the Trojans to a pair of doubles in what Coach Ray Young termed "as good
an effort as we have had all year."
