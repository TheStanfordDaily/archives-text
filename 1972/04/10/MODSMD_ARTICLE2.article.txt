# Agnew Addresses Luncheon
## CRA Conference Endorses Nixon 
### FRANK MILLER 
At a weekend convention in Palo
Alto, the conservative California
Republican Assembly endorsed
President Richard Nixon for
re-election, fending off supporters of
conservative Ohio Congressman John
Ashbrook's candidacy. The vote was
211-86.
Saturday, as one of the highlights
of the conference, over 500 members
heard Vice President Spiro Agnew
blast the Democratic presidential
candidates and "their editorial allies,"
and ask for the endorsement of Nixon.
Agnew referred to "the intellectual

mandarins of the left elite" and said
that the Democratic party "isn't fit to
govern."
The highly partisan address called
the Democrats "the Party of the Past,
woefully detached from the issues and
concerns of the decade of the 1970'5."
Surprise Appearance
Agnew's noon appearance came as a
surprise to nearly everyone. He was
scheduled to speak at a Saturday
evening banquet, and neither delegates
nor press knew of the Vice President's
presence at the luncheon until he
entered the hall.
Although Agnew's aides vigorously
denied it, the Vice-President was
evidently switched to the luncheon
and former Deputy Defense Secretary
David Packard to the dinner session
because of anti-Agnew demonstrations
planned for the evening.
The demonstrators gathered several
hours after the Vice President had left
the Bay Area for Palm Springs. (See
related story, this page.)
Personal Emergency
Agnew's press secretary said the
switch of speakers was made due to a
personal emergency on Packard's part.
However, Packard was present during
Agnew's address.
The convention press chief later
conceded that "I understand Packard's
(noon) speech was superceded from
above in Washington."
Security was extremely tight during
the Vice President's appearance. The
banquet hall was sealed off while
Agnew was inside, with neither
delegates nor newsmen allowed to
enter or leave.
Packard and Governor Ronald
Reagan addressed the dinner session.
(See story on page three.) Reagan's
appearance at the convention was also
a surprise.
Deviations
The resolution passed by the CRA
yesterday morning endorsing Nixon
applauded his "courageous efforts"
but also criticized him for several
"deviations" from the 1968 GOP
platform.
The "deviations" included support
of a guaranteed annual income, deficit
spending, and revenue sharing. The
resolution was labeled a "compromise
endorsement."
Ashbrook's supporters had sought
to deny Nixon the two-thirds vote
needed for endorsement by the state's
largest grassroots GOP organization.
They fell 14 votes short.
Demagogues
In his Saturday address, Agnew

labeled as "demagogues" those
"political and editorial spokesmen
who pander to the worst instincts of
the leftist radical mob... to those
spokesmen who denigrate our men in
uniform, both in the armed services
and in our law enforcement agencies,
by currying favor with a nest-fouling
constituency of home-grown
anti-Americans who pervert their
Constitutional rights in an effort to
destroy their country's free
institutions."
"And the label 'demogogue'
Agnew continued, "belongs to thosi
who seek to divide Americans along
generational, racial and economic lines
by mindless emotional appeals to bloc
constituencies that they identify by
such labels as 'the young,' 'the black'
and 'the poor.!"
He accused the"Washington-
Manhattan media corps" and the
Democratic Party — the "liberal
elitists" — of being "insensitive" to
what Agnew labeled as the "fact" that
"most Americans are fed up with this

doctrinaire, yes, and cavalier treatment
given their interests by liberal elitist
spokesmen, both in and out of
government." He named the
Washington Post.
"They invoke the name of 'the
people' very freely. But in fact," he
continued, "they are contemptuous of
'the people' because ideological
inbreeding has caused them to think of
people not as having any diversity but
as a monolithic mass."
Accusing these "liberal elitists" of
an "underlying contempt for the
democratic process," he said the
"Democratic leaders bring to the
country this year" a theme of
"Backward Together."
Noting what he termed "a
rightward stampede by the thundering
herd of Democratic presidential
candidates," Agnew blasted the
candidates for emphasis in their
primary campaigns on image, style,
and "a desparate search for something
their media relations experts refer to
as 'charisma'!"
