# Batsmen Upset USC

### MIKE HERMAN 
The Stanford varsity baseball
team journied down to Los
Angeles this past weekend to clash
with the Trojans of the University
of Southern California and came
away with two victories in three
games, winning 2-0 and 2-1 before
bowing in nightcap of Saturday's
doubleheader, 3-2.
In the first game of the series,
Stanford faced the Trojans' best
in righthander Mark Sogge, and
came away with a brilliantly
pitched game themselves, 2-0.
Sogge (2-1), the young brother of
former Trojan football and
baseball star, Steve, had been
bothered much of the season by
tendonitis in his right shoulder.
Nonetheless, he had maintained
his position as the leader of the
SC staff by winning his only two
decisions and failing to allow a
single run in the seventeen innings
he had pitched.
Stanford realized a superlative
pitching gem turned in by
southpaw Bob DiPietro (6-2).
In his complete game effort,
DiPietro allowed only two hits
and successfully stifled a very
potent Trojan lineup to remove
any suspense from the game.
While recording his sixth victory
of the year and his most
important, the sophomore from
Washington struck out four, while
allowing three walks.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal
batters were driving Sogge's
pitches all over the park, racking
up eleven hits to go with their two
run output. Every man in the
batting order hit safely with the
one exception of DiPietro and he
drove in the second Stanford run
with a sacrifice fly in the second
inning. The Cards were retired in
order only in the ninth and were
held hitless only in the fourth and
ninth.
Reece Amazing
The bottom half of the order
provided a majority of the
offensive attack. Catcher Bob
Reece, continuing his amazing
clutch hitting, cracked two
singles, as did the keystone
combination of Joe Lamour and
Dave Edson. And it was the last
five men in the lineup who
provided the only runs of the
game, in the second inning.
All American Rod Boone, who
has dropped off in his average this
year, but who has continued to
hit with power, opened the inning
with a towering drive that sailed
about 200 feet, enough to clear
the short rightfield fence. The
opposite field homerun, Boone's
eighth of the season, broke
Sogge's streak of runless innings at
eighteen.
Reece then followed with a
crisp single to center and, after
Edson flied out to the same field,
Lamoure singled Reece to third.
DiPietro then belted a long fly to
left that was caught by SC's Jeff
Pederson, but Reece tagged up
and scored ahead of the throw.
The Cardinals also threatened
in the fifth, when Aguirre opened
the inning with a double but was
left on third; in the sixth, when
they loaded the bases with one
out only to have Aguirre hit into a
double play; and again in the
eighth, when Reece and Edson
opened with singles, but failed to
score on three infield outs.
Only five Trojans reached base,
one each in the second, third,
fourth, fifth and eighth innings.
SC shortstop Roy Smally, who
walked, was the first baserunner
for the Trojans. One inning later,
Sogge hit a solid smash to left
field for a double.
With his opposite number on
thirdbase, however, DiPietro
induced secondbaseman Milt

Guggia to fly out to right field.
Same on Saturday
On Saturday, the actors might
have been different, but the play
was basically the same. Nick
Peterson started for the Cardinals
and pitched a superb four-hitter,
striking out three. Yet, until the
final inning of the seven inning
game, it appeared as if he would
get the short end of the deal.
Going into the last of the seventh,
SC led 1-0. The run had come on
one of the very few errors made
over the weekend by Stanford.
Peterson began the SC third by
getting Smally and thirdbaseman
Jeff Port. Then singles by Ken
Huizenger and Ed Putman put
runners at first and third. With
Sam Ceci at the plate, Stanford
catcher Reece allowed a pitch to
get away from him for a passed
ball and Huizenger scored.
Peterson then walked Ceci and
was really in a jam. Only a
spectacular diving catch by
shortstop Lamour allowed the
Cards to escape.
Stanford had several chances to
come back, getting a runner on in
the fourth, fifth and sixth, but
failing to score. And so the
bottom of the seventh rolled
around, Stanford down 1-0.
Firstbaseman Mark Lucich led off
by striking out. Rod Boone
singled to left and Kim Hannaford
ran for him. Then Bob Reece hit a
grounder to shortstop which SC's
Smally flipped to his second
baseman Rob Adloph to begin an
apparent double play.
However, the overanxious
Adolph left the bag too quickly
and even failed to get Reece at
first, so everyone was safe. Dave
Edson then followed with a
run-scoring single to right,
followed by another
run-producing single by
pinchhitter Tim Wilson to center.
The Cardinals led 2-1.
Peterson opened the bottom of
the seventh by giving up a walk to
Smally, but then retired three in a
row, including a final strike out of
homerun threat Fred Lynn, to
preserve the victory.
Quick Start
The final match began as if the
Cards were going to run off with
the game. Mickey Aguirre led off
the game with a double and, one

out later, was driven home on a
single smash by Tom Williams.
Mark Lucich singled too, and
Southern California pitcher Tim
Coffin looked as if he might not
make it out of the first inning.
Unfortuntely for Stanford, he
got left fielder Rod Boone to hit
into a double play and escaped
the inning only surrendering
one run.
Meanwhile, Mike Higgins began
where DiPietro and Peterson had
left off, extending Stanford's
streak of unearned run innings to
twenty. In the fourth, however,
he beat himself by allowing
firstbaseman Darrell Arenstein to
get aboard on a single and then
wild pitching him to third. After
striking out Milt Guggia, Higgins
got Coffin to ground out to short,
but on the play, Arenstein scored,
making the score 1-1.
In the next inning, the
forgotten Trojan power finally
burned through. With one out,
centerfielder Fred Lynn doubled
to right. The next hitter, Tim
Steels, Southern California's
leading hitter who had been held
hitless in his first five plate
appearances in the series,
unloaded a tremendous homerun
to rightfield in just about the
same place that Boone had
homered on Friday.
The game entered the ninth
inning with SC leading 3-1.
Centerfielder Tom Williams and
Mark Lucich opened the inning
with infield singles, Lucich's
smash hitting firstbase and
bounding away from SC's
fielders. The fluke play allowed
Williams to move up and
pinchhitter Tim Wilson, once
again coming through in the
clutch, singled to center to score
him. A forceout on a ground ball
by Dave Edson moved Lucich to
third. Then, Joe Lamour, who had
played a brilliant series swung at
and missed a third strike and the
Trojans had their consolation.

with a towering drive that sailed
about 200 feet, enough to clear
the short rightfield fence. The
opposite field homerun, Boone's
eighth of the season, broke
Sogge's streak of runless innings at
eighteen.
Reece then followed with a
crisp single to center and, after
Edson flied out to the same field,
Lamoure singled Reece to third.
DiPietro then belted a long fly to
left that was caught by SC's Jeff
Pederson, but Reece tagged up
and scored ahead of the throw.
The Cardinals also threatened
in the fifth, when Aguirre opened
the inning with a double but was
left on third; in the sixth, when
they loaded the bases with one
out only to have Aguirre hit into a
double play; and again in the
eighth, when Reece and Edson
opened with singles, but failed to
score on three infield outs.
Only five Trojans reached base,
one each in the second, third,
fourth, fifth and eighth innings.
SC shortstop Roy Smally, who
walked, was the first baserunner
for the Trojans. One inning later,
Sogge hit a solid smash to left
field for a double.
With his opposite number on
thirdbase, however, DiPietro
induced secondbaseman Milt

Guggia to fly out to right field.
Same on Saturday
On Saturday, the actors might
have been different, but the play
was basically the same. Nick
Peterson started for the Cardinals
and pitched a superb four-hitter,
striking out three. Yet, until the
final inning of the seven inning
game, it appeared as if he would
get the short end of the deal.
Going into the last of the seventh,
SC led 1-0. The run had come on
one of the very few errors made
over the weekend by Stanford.
Peterson began the SC third by
getting Smally and thirdbaseman
Jeff Port. Then singles by Ken
Huizenger and Ed Putman put
runners at first and third. With
Sam Ceci at the plate, Stanford
catcher Reece allowed a pitch to
get away from him for a passed
ball and Huizenger scored.
Peterson then walked Ceci and
was really in a jam. Only a
spectacular diving catch by
shortstop Lamour allowed the
Cards to escape.
Stanford had several chances to
come back, getting a runner on in
the fourth, fifth and sixth, but
failing to score. And so the
bottom of the seventh rolled
around, Stanford down 1-0.
Firstbaseman Mark Lucich led off
by striking out. Rod Boone
singled to left and Kim Hannaford
ran for him. Then Bob Reece hit a
grounder to shortstop which SC's
Smally flipped to his second
baseman Rob Adloph to begin an
apparent double play.
However, the overanxious
Adolph left the bag too quickly
and even failed to get Reece at
first, so everyone was safe. Dave
Edson then followed with a
run-scoring single to right,
followed by another
run-producing single by
pinchhitter Tim Wilson to center.
The Cardinals led 2-1.
Peterson opened the bottom of
the seventh by giving up a walk to
Smally, but then retired three in a
row, including a final strike out of
homerun threat Fred Lynn, to
preserve the victory.
Quick Start
The final match began as if the
Cards were going to run off with
the game. Mickey Aguirre led off
the game with a double and, one

out later, was driven home on a
single smash by Tom Williams.
Mark Lucich singled too, and
Southern California pitcher Tim
Coffin looked as if he might not
make it out of the first inning.
Unfortuntely for Stanford, he
got left fielder Rod Boone to hit
into a double play and escaped
the inning only surrendering
one run.
Meanwhile, Mike Higgins began
where DiPietro and Peterson had
left off, extending Stanford's
streak of unearned run innings to
twenty. In the fourth, however,
he beat himself by allowing
firstbaseman Darrell Arenstein to
get aboard on a single and then
wild pitching him to third. After
striking out Milt Guggia, Higgins
got Coffin to ground out to short,
but on the play, Arenstein scored,
making the score 1-1.
In the next inning, the
forgotten Trojan power finally
burned through. With one out,
centerfielder Fred Lynn doubled
to right. The next hitter, Tim
Steels, Southern California's
leading hitter who had been held
hitless in his first five plate
appearances in the series,
unloaded a tremendous homerun
to rightfield in just about the
same place that Boone had
homered on Friday.
The game entered the ninth
inning with SC leading 3-1.
Centerfielder Tom Williams and
Mark Lucich opened the inning
with infield singles, Lucich's
smash hitting firstbase and
bounding away from SC's
fielders. The fluke play allowed
Williams to move up and
pinchhitter Tim Wilson, once
again coming through in the
clutch, singled to center to score
him. A forceout on a ground ball
by Dave Edson moved Lucich to
third. Then, Joe Lamour, who had
played a brilliant series swung at
and missed a third strike and the
Trojans had their consolation.
The Stanford varsity baseball
team journied down to Los
Angeles this past weekend to clash
with the Trojans of the University
of Southern California and came
away with two victories in three
games, winning 2-0 and 2-1 before
bowing in nightcap of Saturday's
doubleheader, 3-2.
In the first game of the series,
Stanford faced the Trojans' best
in righthander Mark Sogge, and
came away with a brilliantly
pitched game themselves, 2-0.
Sogge (2-1), the young brother of
former Trojan football and
baseball star, Steve, had been
bothered much of the season by
tendonitis in his right shoulder.
Nonetheless, he had maintained
his position as the leader of the
SC staff by winning his only two
decisions and failing to allow a
single run in the seventeen innings
he had pitched.
Stanford realized a superlative
pitching gem turned in by
southpaw Bob DiPietro (6-2).
In his complete game effort,
DiPietro allowed only two hits
and successfully stifled a very
potent Trojan lineup to remove
any suspense from the game.
While recording his sixth victory
of the year and his most
important, the sophomore from
Washington struck out four, while
allowing three walks.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal
batters were driving Sogge's
pitches all over the park, racking
up eleven hits to go with their two
run output. Every man in the
batting order hit safely with the
one exception of DiPietro and he
drove in the second Stanford run
with a sacrifice fly in the second
inning. The Cards were retired in
order only in the ninth and were
held hitless only in the fourth and
ninth.
Reece Amazing
The bottom half of the order
provided a majority of the
offensive attack. Catcher Bob
Reece, continuing his amazing
clutch hitting, cracked two
singles, as did the keystone
combination of Joe Lamour and
Dave Edson. And it was the last
five men in the lineup who
provided the only runs of the
game, in the second inning.
All American Rod Boone, who
has dropped off in his average this
year, but who has continued to

spectacular diving catch by
shortstop Lamour allowed the
Cards to escape.
Stanford had several chances to
come back, getting a runner on in
the fourth, fifth and sixth, but
failing to score. And so the
bottom of the seventh rolled
around, Stanford down 1-0.
Firstbaseman Mark Lucich led off
by striking out. Rod Boone
singled to left and Kim Hannaford
ran for him. Then Bob Reece hit a
grounder to shortstop which SC's
Smally flipped to his second
baseman Rob Adloph to begin an
apparent double play.
However, the overanxious
Adolph left the bag too quickly
and even failed to get Reece at
first, so everyone was safe. Dave
Edson then followed with a
run-scoring single to right,
followed by another
run-producing single by
pinchhitter Tim Wilson to center.
The Cardinals led 2-1.
Peterson opened the bottom of
the seventh by giving up a walk to
Smally, but then retired three in a
row, including a final strike out of
homerun threat Fred Lynn, to
preserve the victory.
Quick Start
The final match began as if the
Cards were going to run off with
the game. Mickey Aguirre led off
the game with a double and, one

out later, was driven home on a
single smash by Tom Williams.
Mark Lucich singled too, and
Southern California pitcher Tim
Coffin looked as if he might not
make it out of the first inning.
Unfortuntely for Stanford, he
got left fielder Rod Boone to hit
into a double play and escaped
the inning only surrendering
one run.
Meanwhile, Mike Higgins began
where DiPietro and Peterson had
left off, extending Stanford's
streak of unearned run innings to
twenty. In the fourth, however,
he beat himself by allowing
firstbaseman Darrell Arenstein to
get aboard on a single and then
wild pitching him to third. After
striking out Milt Guggia, Higgins
got Coffin to ground out to short,
but on the play, Arenstein scored,
making the score 1-1.
In the next inning, the
forgotten Trojan power finally
burned through. With one out,
centerfielder Fred Lynn doubled
to right. The next hitter, Tim
Steels, Southern California's
leading hitter who had been held
hitless in his first five plate
appearances in the series,
unloaded a tremendous homerun
to rightfield in just about the
same place that Boone had
homered on Friday.
The game entered the ninth
inning with SC leading 3-1.
Centerfielder Tom Williams and
Mark Lucich opened the inning
with infield singles, Lucich's
smash hitting firstbase and
bounding away from SC's
fielders. The fluke play allowed
Williams to move up and
pinchhitter Tim Wilson, once
again coming through in the
clutch, singled to center to score
him. A forceout on a ground ball
by Dave Edson moved Lucich to
third. Then, Joe Lamour, who had
played a brilliant series swung at
and missed a third strike and the
Trojans had their consolation.
The Stanford varsity baseball
team journied down to Los
Angeles this past weekend to clash
with the Trojans of the University
of Southern California and came
away with two victories in three
games, winning 2-0 and 2-1 before
bowing in nightcap of Saturday's
doubleheader, 3-2.
In the first game of the series,
Stanford faced the Trojans' best
in righthander Mark Sogge, and
came away with a brilliantly
pitched game themselves, 2-0.
Sogge (2-1), the young brother of
former Trojan football and
baseball star, Steve, had been
bothered much of the season by
tendonitis in his right shoulder.
Nonetheless, he had maintained
his position as the leader of the
SC staff by winning his only two
decisions and failing to allow a
single run in the seventeen innings
he had pitched.
Stanford realized a superlative
pitching gem turned in by
southpaw Bob DiPietro (6-2).
In his complete game effort,
DiPietro allowed only two hits
and successfully stifled a very
potent Trojan lineup to remove
any suspense from the game.
While recording his sixth victory
of the year and his most
important, the sophomore from
Washington struck out four, while
allowing three walks.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal
batters were driving Sogge's
pitches all over the park, racking
up eleven hits to go with their two
run output. Every man in the
batting order hit safely with the
one exception of DiPietro and he
drove in the second Stanford run
with a sacrifice fly in the second
inning. The Cards were retired in
order only in the ninth and were
held hitless only in the fourth and
ninth.
Reece Amazing
The bottom half of the order
provided a majority of the
offensive attack. Catcher Bob
Reece, continuing his amazing
clutch hitting, cracked two
singles, as did the keystone
combination of Joe Lamour and
Dave Edson. And it was the last
five men in the lineup who
provided the only runs of the
game, in the second inning.
All American Rod Boone, who
has dropped off in his average this
year, but who has continued to
hit with power, opened the inning
with a towering drive that sailed
about 200 feet, enough to clear
the short rightfield fence. The
opposite field homerun, Boone's
eighth of the season, broke
Sogge's streak of runless innings at
eighteen.
Reece then followed with a
crisp single to center and, after
Edson flied out to the same field,
Lamoure singled Reece to third.
DiPietro then belted a long fly to
left that was caught by SC's Jeff
Pederson, but Reece tagged up
and scored ahead of the throw.
The Cardinals also threatened
in the fifth, when Aguirre opened
the inning with a double but was
left on third; in the sixth, when
they loaded the bases with one
out only to have Aguirre hit into a
double play; and again in the
eighth, when Reece and Edson
opened with singles, but failed to
score on three infield outs.
Only five Trojans reached base,
one each in the second, third,
fourth, fifth and eighth innings.
SC shortstop Roy Smally, who
walked, was the first baserunner
for the Trojans. One inning later,
Sogge hit a solid smash to left
field for a double.
With his opposite number on
thirdbase, however, DiPietro
induced secondbaseman Milt

Guggia to fly out to right field.
Same on Saturday
On Saturday, the actors might
have been different, but the play
was basically the same. Nick
Peterson started for the Cardinals
and pitched a superb four-hitter,
striking out three. Yet, until the
final inning of the seven inning
game, it appeared as if he would
get the short end of the deal.
Going into the last of the seventh,
SC led 1-0. The run had come on
one of the very few errors made
over the weekend by Stanford.
Peterson began the SC third by
getting Smally and thirdbaseman
Jeff Port. Then singles by Ken
Huizenger and Ed Putman put
runners at first and third. With
Sam Ceci at the plate, Stanford
catcher Reece allowed a pitch to
get away from him for a passed
ball and Huizenger scored.
Peterson then walked Ceci and
was really in a jam. Only a
spectacular diving catch by
shortstop Lamour allowed the
Cards to escape.
Stanford had several chances to
come back, getting a runner on in
the fourth, fifth and sixth, but
failing to score. And so the
bottom of the seventh rolled

centerfielder Fred Lynn doubled
to right. The next hitter, Tim
Steels, Southern California's
leading hitter who had been held
hitless in his first five plate
appearances in the series,
unloaded a tremendous homerun
to rightfield in just about the
same place that Boone had
homered on Friday.
The game entered the ninth
inning with SC leading 3-1.
Centerfielder Tom Williams and
Mark Lucich opened the inning
with infield singles, Lucich's
smash hitting firstbase and
bounding away from SC's
fielders. The fluke play allowed
Williams to move up and
pinchhitter Tim Wilson, once
again coming through in the
clutch, singled to center to score
him. A forceout on a ground ball
by Dave Edson moved Lucich to
third. Then, Joe Lamour, who had
played a brilliant series swung at
and missed a third strike and the
Trojans had their consolation.
