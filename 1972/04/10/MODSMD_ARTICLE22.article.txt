852 Raids Continue
SAIGON — U.S. 852 bombers are flying sustained raids
over North Vietnam for the first time since before the
bombing halt of 1968, the U.S. Command said today.
Below the demilitarized zone, tank-led Communist forces
renewed massive assaults in a drive on provincial capitals
and key towns.
Official U.S. sources described the use of 852s over
North Vietnam as a "show of force" on the part of
President Nixon.
A brief statement from the command said American
"air and naval operations continue south of, in and north
of the DMZ. These operations include naval gunfire,
tactical aircraft and 852s throughout the battlefield area."
Command spokesmen said North Vietnam is
considered part of the battlefield area.
The statement said the operations were "in response to
the Communist invasion of South Vietnam through the
demilitarized zone."
The command announced the loss of two U.S. aircraft
yesterday.
A command spokesman denied North Vietnamese
claims that three of the eight-jet 852s had been shot down
during the past week, including one yesterday. The
command said yesterday that one 852 was slightly
damaged while operating along the DMZ, but landed
safely at Da Nang.
The South Vietnamese appeared to be holding out
yesterday against the assaults below the DMZ, and the
Saigon command ordered another 20,000 troops into a
showdown battle for An Loc, just 60 miles north of the
capital.
Fighting spread for the first time, in the current enemy
offensive, to the valleys and foothills near Da Nang, where
the United States has a major air base. U.S. troops were
not believed immediately ivolved.
Overcast skies once again forced limitation of U.S. air
strikes in North Vietnam, but heavy air action was
reported in the South. Viet Cong units kept up mortar
and rocket attacks in the Mekong Delta south of Saigon.
Hijack Suspect Arrested
SALT LAKE CITY, Utah — A law enforcement student
and skydiving enthusiast who said he was a Green Beret
and helicopter pilot while in Vietnam was arrested
yesterday and charged with the $500,000
extortion-parachute hijacking of a United Air Lines 727
jet on P'riday.
The FBI would not say last night whether the money
had been recovered, although agents had said earlier in the
day that it had not.
Richard Floyd McCoy Jr., 29, a Brigham Young
University student active in the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints (Mormon), was arrested at his home in
Provo, Utah.
McCoy was held without bail on charges of air piracy
and interfering with flight crewmen. The maximum
penalty is death. A preliminary hearing was set for April
19.
McCoy is accused of commandeering a United flight
from Newark, N.J., to Los Angeles shortly after it made a
scheduled stop in Denver.
The plane was diverted to San Francisco where it
remained on the ground for three hours while four
parchutes and the $500,000 was delivered. Then, the
passengers were let off and the plane began a zig-zag flight
over the Northwest. The hijacker bailed out over Provo,
and the plane went on to land at Salt Lake City.
LBJ Condition Improves
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. - The heart specialist treating
former President Lvndon B. Johnson said yesterday he is

returning to his home in Atlanta, indicating the former
chief executive's condition has greatly improved.
Dr. John Willis Hurst said Johnson, who suffered a
serious heart attack last Friday, now has "few serious
danger signals." The 63-year-old former president, he
added, had a very good day and "now is a safe time to go
or I wouldn't go."
He said he expected there would be some permanent
damage from the heart attack Johnson suffered Friday,
but that he could not tell how extensive it would be.
Johnson is anxious to return to Texas, Hurst said. He
said Johnson would eventually be moved to Texas, but
refused to estimate when that would be.
Johnson suffered a major heart attack in 1955.
Kleindienst -ITT Hearings Resume
WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee
resumes hearings this morning into the nomination of
Acting Atty. Gen. Richard Kleindienst, with a key figure
in San Diego's successful bid for this year's Republican
convention as the first witness.
The leadoff witness will be Rep. Bob Wilson (R-Calif.),
who has been quoted as saying in an interview March 3
that International Telephone & Telegraph lobbyist Dita D.
Beard had told him she wrote a memo linking the
out-of-court settlement of an antitrust suit against ITT
with an ITT pledge to help underwrite the GOP
convention.
Beard has since denied that she wrote the memo, which
led to the current hearings after it \vas published by
columnist Jack Anderson.
Wilson issued a statement last Thursday denying that
Beard had ever told him there was a link between the
antitrust settlement and the convention pledge.
The Republican National Committee yesterday accused
Democratic party fund-raisers of spreading lies about the
Republican party and ITT.
Tar And Feathers In Belfast
BELFAST — Youths dragged a pregnant Roman Catholic
woman from her home last night in front of her screaming
children, beat her and left her painted, feathered and
lashed to a lamppost in the street. The attack came hours
after 30 Catholic priests appealed for peace in Northern
Ireland.
The illegal Irish Republican Army vowed to fight on
against British rule, rejecting mounting calls for an end to
the violence in Ulster.
The assault on Philomena McGuckin, 24, was similar to
punishment applied to girls the IRA has accused of
fraternizing with British troops.
McGuckin's three children—aged 5, 3 and 8
months—shrieked in terror as she was dragged from her
kitchen into the street, beaten with sticks, sheared of her
hair and smeared with red paint and feathers.
Police who questioned her about the motive for the
assault said: "She was too frightened to tell us. She
wouldn't say anything."
They said she was attacked by six youths and two
women.
Nixon Asks Baseball Settlement
WASHINGTON — J. Curtis Counts, director of the
Federal Mediation Service, received a telephone call from
President Nixon yesterday urging that he do everything he
can to get the general baseball strike settled.
Counts is scheduled to meet here today with Marvin
Miller, executive director of the striking Major League
Baseball Players Association, and John Gaherin, the club
owners' representative.
A spokesman for Counts said the President said he was
"very interested in seeing the dispute settled so they can
get the season started."
