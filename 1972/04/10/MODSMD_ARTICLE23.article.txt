# Prison Conference Speakers Call For Substantial Reforms
## 
### BOB BACON 
Speakers at a weekend campus
conference on prisons vehemently
criticized the California prison system
and discussed possible penal reforms.
Activist attorney Faye Stender of
Berkeley described her impressions of
the prison system; state Assemblyman
Willie Brown of San Francisco dwelled
at some length on prison research by
Stanford psychology professor Philip
Zimbardo; and Rep. Ronald Dellums
(D. -Berkeley) discussed prison reforms
that he has proposed.
The conference was sponsored by
the newly-organized Prison Informa
tion Center on the campus. Between
50 and 100 persons attended each
session.
Zimbardo's Research
Brown discussed the experimental
prison established last summer at
Stanford under Zimbardo's direction.
More such research is needed, Brown
said, to drive home to those in
authority the need for substantial
reform.
The experiment received wide
spread publicity centering on the rapid
brutalizing effect that the artificial
prison environment produced.
Carlos Prescott, an ex-convict who
assisted Zimbardo with the study, also
addressed the conference briefly yes
terday.
Soledad Hell
Stender said of Soledad Prison in
Monterey County that "the word
'fascism' doesn't begin to describe the
psychoanalytic hell there."
She accused the California Depart
ment of Corrections of proposing new
"Dachau-like maximum security pri
sons" to replace San Quentin, slated
for closure.
She added that the Department
"tells a continual stream of lies, so
what the public knows about prisons is
what the officials want them to
know . . . The arbitrary administrative
disciplinary procedure in prison is
foreign to the American ideology of
due process and fair play."
She went on, 'The Department is
paranoid; they know they're outside
the mainstream of American life."
Dellums Urges Reform
Dellums, who spoke at the confer
ence's concluding session yesterday
afternoon, discussed provisions of an
Omnibus Penal Reform Act which he
is proposing for the federal prison
system.
He urged youth groups across the
nation to press for action on his
proposals by Congress, noting that
"leadership in the struggle for justice
usually comes from the young."
Reforms discussed included pro
cedural rights for prisoners accused of

rule violations, increasing the number
of felons on parole rather than in
prison, restrictions on the indetermin
ate sentence, increased contact be
tween prisoners and persons and
groups outside prison, and higher
wages "to put an end to slave labor by
prisoners."
Parole Board
Prescott called the California Adult
Authority, the board which passes on
parole applications and sets release
dates for state prisoners, "the most
impressive array of ex-policemen any
where except in the legislature."
Conference organizers stated that
four current inmates of Soledad Prison
were to appear on the program, but
that they had not been permitted to
attend by prison officials after it was
learned that Stender would also be
appearing on the program.
Stender responded by saying "the
prison officials say that all their
problems are caused by three or four
people of whom I'm one."
Public Pressure
All the speakers stressed that
substantial change will not come to

the prison system until the public
demands it. Brown and Dellums noted
the propensity of politicians to re
spond to public pressure.
Brown said he was "totally pessi
mistic" about the chances for mean
ingful penal reform to be enacted by
the state legislature in the near future.
A common theme was that many
so-called "political prisoners" are in
mates who seek to assert their
individuality in prison, and are punish
ed for it.
Panel Discussions
In addition to the speakers, the
program included a panel discussion of
prison experiences by five ex-convicts,
and a series of workshops designed to
develop specific, concrete proposals
for immediate efforts toward prison
reform.
The Prison Information Center,
funded by the Dean of Students'
office and located in the ASSU Offices
in Tresidder Union, is an outgrowth of
a class of "Racism and Law Enforce
ment," taught Winter Quarter by
Frank Bonilla, Professor of Political
Science.

ed for it.
Panel Discussions
In addition to the speakers, the
program included a panel discussion of
prison experiences by five ex-convicts,
and a series of workshops designed to
develop specific, concrete proposals
for immediate efforts toward prison
reform.
The Prison Information Center,
funded by the Dean of Students'
office and located in the ASSU Offices
in Tresidder Union, is an outgrowth of
a class of "Racism and Law Enforce
ment," taught Winter Quarter by
Frank Bonilla, Professor of Political
Science.
Speakers at a weekend campus
conference on prisons vehemently
criticized the California prison system
and discussed possible penal reforms.
Activist attorney Faye Stender of
Berkeley described her impressions of
the prison system; state Assemblyman
Willie Brown of San Francisco dwelled
at some length on prison research by
Stanford psychology professor Philip
Zimbardo; and Rep. Ronald Dellums
(D. -Berkeley) discussed prison reforms
that he has proposed.
The conference was sponsored by
the newly-organized Prison Informa
tion Center on the campus. Between
50 and 100 persons attended each
session.
Zimbardo's Research
Brown discussed the experimental
prison established last summer at
Stanford under Zimbardo's direction.
More such research is needed, Brown
said, to drive home to those in
authority the need for substantial
reform.
The experiment received wide
spread publicity centering on the rapid
brutalizing effect that the artificial
prison environment produced.
Carlos Prescott, an ex-convict who
assisted Zimbardo with the study, also
addressed the conference briefly yes
terday.
Soledad Hell
Stender said of Soledad Prison in
Monterey County that "the word
'fascism' doesn't begin to describe the
psychoanalytic hell there."
She accused the California Depart
ment of Corrections of proposing new
"Dachau-like maximum security pri
sons" to replace San Quentin, slated
for closure.
She added that the Department
"tells a continual stream of lies, so
what the public knows about prisons is
what the officials want them to
know . . . The arbitrary administrative
disciplinary procedure in prison is
foreign to the American ideology of
due process and fair play."
She went on, 'The Department is
paranoid; they know they're outside
the mainstream of American life."
Dellums Urges Reform
Dellums, who spoke at the confer
ence's concluding session yesterday
afternoon, discussed provisions of an
Omnibus Penal Reform Act which he
is proposing for the federal prison
system.
He urged youth groups across the
nation to press for action on his
proposals by Congress, noting that
"leadership in the struggle for justice
usually comes from the young."
Reforms discussed included pro
cedural rights for prisoners accused of

rule violations, increasing the number
of felons on parole rather than in
prison, restrictions on the indetermin
ate sentence, increased contact be
tween prisoners and persons and
groups outside prison, and higher
wages "to put an end to slave labor by
prisoners."
Parole Board
Prescott called the California Adult
Authority, the board which passes on
parole applications and sets release
dates for state prisoners, "the most
impressive array of ex-policemen any
where except in the legislature."
Conference organizers stated that
four current inmates of Soledad Prison
were to appear on the program, but
that they had not been permitted to
attend by prison officials after it was
learned that Stender would also be
appearing on the program.
Stender responded by saying "the
prison officials say that all their
problems are caused by three or four
people of whom I'm one."
Public Pressure
All the speakers stressed that
substantial change will not come to

the prison system until the public
demands it. Brown and Dellums noted
the propensity of politicians to re
spond to public pressure.
Brown said he was "totally pessi
mistic" about the chances for mean
ingful penal reform to be enacted by
the state legislature in the near future.
A common theme was that many
so-called "political prisoners" are in
mates who seek to assert their
individuality in prison, and are punish
ed for it.
