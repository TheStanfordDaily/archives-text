# Nearly 1800 Demonstrate At Republican Dinner
## 
### PHIL REVZIN 
About 1800 demonstrators gather
ed in front of the Cabana Hyatt House
Saturday night to protest the Nixon
Administration's foreign and domestic
policies.
The demonstration occured in the
evening as scheduled despite the
change in plans which saw Vice-
President Spiro Agnew address the
California Republican Assembly that
afternoon.
The crowd reached its peak about 6
p.m., and then dwindled quickly, until
300 people dispersed about 9 p.m. A
large group gathered in the Co-op
parking lot at El Camino and San
Antonio Road, and marched north
along El Camino about four blocks to
the rally site in front of the Cabana
Hyatt House.
About 250 policemen and sheriff's
deputies were on hand, and a line of
about 100 officers encircled the front
of the hotel, keeping the demonstra
tors from entering the front of the
grounds.
Inside the Hyatt House, CRA
delegates viewed the demonstration
with disdain. One delegate comment
ed, "They ought to put up a machine
gun and wipe them all out. This is

anarchy."
Comments included: "This is where
our trouble is. This is Communist
inspired and we can prove this." An
elderly woman accused all the demon
strators of "living off welfare and food
stamps" while her husband said
simply, "We have to work for a
living—they don't."
Several of the delegates did go out
to the crowd for wide-ranging discus
sions.
The demonstration remained peace
ful until the end of the evening as the
crowd listened to speeches and music
from a sound truck in the street.
As the demonstrators began to
disperse back down El Camino to the
Co-op, several rocks, bottles, and
pieces of wood were tossed at police,
but caused no injuries. Five windows
were broken in buildings along El
Camino as the group neared San
Antonio Road. «
The entertainment highlight of the
evening came when the "Red Star
Singers" offered their version of "Pig
Agnew."
Former Ramparts editor Robert
Scheer told the crowd that "this
demonstration is in answer to those
who sav the movement is dead.
