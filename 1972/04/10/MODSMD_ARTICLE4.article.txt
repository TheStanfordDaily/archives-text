# Medical School Dean Seeks Educational Reform
## 
### CRAIG MALLOY SCOTT THACHER 
"Ten years of inducing and curing
metabolic bone diseases in rats: that's my
preparation for this job."
Clayton Rich, who has been dean of
Stanford's Medical School for just nine
months, is speaking somewhat ironically for
the man who was chosen las't summer to do
some re-thinking and shaking up at this 50
million dollar medical complex.
At present the new dean is most concerned
with changing the criteria for faculty promo
tion and hiring, expanding the number of
medical students here, and undertaking a
major review of education at the Med School.
"I have been in academic administration a
short time," the former bone specialist
commented. 'That's a sharp contrast to many
medical school deans that have been doing
this kind of work for a decade or more."
It was only during his last three years at
the University of Washington, where he was
professor of medicine, that Rich worked as a
part-time associate dean, and later full time as
the associate dean for research and clinical
affairs.
Community Health
While many have asked whether Stanford
should become more involved in local
community health problems, Rich stated, "We
should not be attempting to compete" with
other local hospitals "in providing general
care."
He asks "how much of a general
community service hospital is possible," given
Stanford's commitment to research.
He added that while there is a general
nationwide trend for medical schools to
produce more general practitioners, Stanford
is going "in the other direction . . . It's main
emphasis will continue to be on specialized
medical care."
Primary Patient Care
But he says that "we should use the
practical physician in the teaching program,"
as part of an effort to give doctors more
training in primary patient care, sending them
to work with general physicians outside the
Med School.
Rich is also asking a committee to
undertake a careful review of medical
education.

It must deal with such touchy issues at the
Med School as faculty advancement, the
incentive program which gives added funds to
departments doing patient care, and the
relation between clinical work and medical
education.
Undergraduates
Increasing the Stanford undergraduate's
interaction with the Medical School is
important, Rich said, citing the example of
the Human Biology program with approval.
He cited the "national phenomenon," of
increased clinical faculty, as opposed to those
in the basic sciences, and"the very high levels
of specialization needed to carry out patient
care," as one of the problems the committee
will face.
But he admitted that the research into
specialized diseases results in an unbalanced
patient population, referred from different
outside hospitals, which has an "adverse
effect" on student education.
Rare Ailments
The common ailments are not well
represented, and Rich stated, "Many patients
are not the best kind for the students to deal
with," except for the advanced education of
residents and post-doctoral students.
Also because of the specialization that
comes with research into advanced treatment
techniques, teaching in some clinical depart
ments has suffered. "That part [teaching] has
not been strongly built up in past years," Rich
said.
Two years ago, before Rich arrived, an
incentive program for clinical departments
was introduced, which returns to a depart
ment a certain percentage of its patient care
fees. These previously had gone to the school
as a whole.
Efficiency
This incentive program has had "several
striking effects, some of them good, some of
them bad," according to Rich. "Efficiency is
markedly increased."
But, he said, 'This program has created
some tension among faculty. Some of the
departments make money and others work
just as hard and don't."
Cancer Research
One salient possibility for increasing
research work at Stanford would be the
construction of a center devoted to cancer

research. Stanford is at the forefront of cancer
research, Rich said, and has one of the best
programs, "in the whole world."
The National Institute of Health has just
approved a planning grant for studying the
"feasibility and desirability" of such a cancer
center. Rich added, however, that a center
partially independent of the Med School
would be "a terrible mistake."
Federal funding has also encouraged
Stanford to increase the size of next year's
incoming class at the Med School, rising from
77 last year to 87.
Federal Aid
To quality for federal aid which awards
Stanford $1,500 per student each year, as well
as a $2,500 bonus on his or her graduation,
Rich said the class size had to increase ten
percent.
But the federal money was only one of
several reasons why class sizes were increased
Rich says, and a faculty committee is being
formed to study Stanford's ability to enlarge
further.
Rich resents the requirements that come
with the money. "I'd hate to be in the
position of having to receive the money no
matter what strings are attached." If neces
sary, he says, "we plan to budget in such a
way that we could do without it."
Poor But Honest
Compared with the financial picture at
other medical schools in the nation, Rich said
"Stanford is in the middle."
At the present, we are "poor but
honest. . . our budget is balanced ... we
don't have too much flexibility in starting
new programs, and we're deficient in several
badly needed facilities ... we would dearly
love to see a substantial infusion of money,"
the dean added.
As far as expansion of the Medical School
goes, a master plan for the next decade is
being prepared. "A pressing need" exists for
new facilities for anatomy, physiology, and
microbiology, which currently are housed in
old buildings behind the Stanford museum,
Rich said.
New Buildings
Presently an architectural study is under
way to expand the hospital towards the
Stanford Barn to the north, to allow new
laboratories and some other services to be

added.
Rich feels that, "Increasing the number of
women on the faculty has a high priority,"
noting that an affirmative action program for
both minorities and women is directed to this
end. In the past two years the number of
women at the Medical Center has increased
from eight to 13.
Nursing
On the subject of other programs, he feels
that the report on the nursing school,
proposing a Ph.D. program in nursing is

misguided.
Asked if the nursing program was worth
keeping at such a specialized institution, when
money was needed elsewhere, Rich replied,
"absolutely, if we have a high-quality and
exciting program."
Regarding the inclusion of larger numbers
of people in the decision-making process, Rich
said, "By no means do I think that all
members of the Stanford community should
be involved in all decisions. It depends on the
kind of decision."

working on reforms that will better integrate teaching and research and provide for faculty
advancement.
