## KZSU Needs Support 
### 
John broholm

In the upcoming ASSU
election, KZSU will be asking the
student body for support in the
amount of one dollar per quarter
per student. Since this represents
a large sum of money
(approximately $35,000), and
since it is an increase over last
year's assessment, we at KZSU
want to make sure that all the
reasons why we think this money
is needed are known.
With that money we wish to
buy a new transmitter to increase
power, and fund the operation of
the station.
First of all, what will you, the
student, receive back from your
investment? The most immediate
benefit will be a stronger signal
wherever you live, and for the
first time, stereo. It may be the
first time you've ever been able to
receive KZSU if you live off
campus. Money for higher power
and equipment to broadcast in
stereo multiplex will be strictly a
one-shot capital investment.
Continued support of the
station's operating fund this year
will insure continued improving
service to the Stanford
Community, especially when it
needs information fast.
Long Run
For the long run, the
investment in higher power will
mean added legal and financial
stability in the future, with
benefits commencing immediately
in a stronger, more solvent, and
more financially stable station.
For, with a power increase, KZSU

will be able for the first time to
seek significant outside funding
which might make it possible to
become financially independent
of the students of the University.
How do the fee assessment
and the station's budget break
down? First, about $18,500, or
54% of the referendum money,
would go into power increase and
stereo equipment expenditures
much needed by the station. Why
a power increase? To qualify for
Cooperation for Public
Broadcasting and Federal funds
for non-commercial stations, a
minimum of 250 watts station
power is required.
Never Again?
By going up in power, KZSU
might never have to depend on
student fee assessments again for
operating funds. Higher power
would also protect the station
from losing its license due to the
commercial-broadcasting lobby's
desire to take 10-watt stations off
the air to make room in the
crowded FM bandwidth for more
commercial stations. And last but
not least, having a power in the
vicinity of 1000 to 3000 watts (as
high as the station would ever
need to go) would ensure that all
Stanford students could receive
the station, something our
present spotty signal coverage
precludes. This is a capital
investment, and the money will
never have to be raised again.
The second major chunk of
money, $11,500, would go
toward continuing KZSU
operating support (the same
function as last year's money).
This includes paying telephone
and teletype bills, maintenance
costs, and such things as office
supplies. This is not quite all the
operating money we need for a
year, as we can raise a limited
amount of money elsewhere

through donations and the like.
But much of this money is
drying up, and we will need
$3,500 o? assessment money to
cover lost revenue. For example,
the national ad agency which
provides us with AM advertising
income has gone bankrupt, leaving
us with $1000 of bad debts and
slim prospects for future ad
income.
As well, the money we have
been getting for the sale of our
Public Affairs tapes to the
University is an odds-on bet to be
squeezed out of existence by the
University's Budget Adjustment
Program, leaving us in a position
where it would be very difficult in
the future to provide an expensive
and time-consuming service such
as coverage of the Franklin
Hearings. Assuming that the
referendum brings in $35,000,
this leaves us about $1500 for
other important capital and
operating expenses, such as
improved news budget and
facilities.
So far there has been no
mention of staff salaries. They do
exist, but they account for less
than 6 percent of the total
operating budget. We pay our
Business Manager for accounting,
and we pay two secretaries for
such legal assurances as checking
transmitter and program logs. Of a
staff of 75, a grand total of 3 are
paid. The entire rest of the staff is
volunteer.
Of the community media
accessible to Stanford students
and other community members,
by far one of the most responsible
and responsive to student
informational needs has been
KZSU. Help us keep it that way.

as coverage of the Franklin
Hearings. Assuming that the
referendum brings in $35,000,
this leaves us about $1500 for
other important capital and
operating expenses, such as
improved news budget and
facilities.
So far there has been no
mention of staff salaries. They do
exist, but they account for less
than 6 percent of the total
operating budget. We pay our
Business Manager for accounting,
and we pay two secretaries for
such legal assurances as checking
transmitter and program logs. Of a
staff of 75, a grand total of 3 are
paid. The entire rest of the staff is
volunteer.
Of the community media

informational needs has been
KZSU. Help us keep it that way.

In the upcoming ASSU
election, KZSU will be asking the
student body for support in the
amount of one dollar per quarter
per student. Since this represents
a large sum of money
(approximately $35,000), and
since it is an increase over last
year's assessment, we at KZSU
want to make sure that all the
reasons why we think this money
is needed are known.
With that money we wish to
buy a new transmitter to increase
power, and fund the operation of
the station.
First of all, what will you, the
student, receive back from your
investment? The most immediate
benefit will be a stronger signal
wherever you live, and for the
first time, stereo. It may be the
first time you've ever been able to
receive KZSU if you live off
campus. Money for higher power
and equipment to broadcast in
stereo multiplex will be strictly a
one-shot capital investment.
Continued support of the
station's operating fund this year
will insure continued improving
service to the Stanford
Community, especially when it
needs information fast.
Long Run
For the long run, the
investment in higher power will
mean added legal and financial
stability in the future, with
benefits commencing immediately
in a stronger, more solvent, and
more financially stable station.
For, with a power increase, KZSU

will be able for the first time to
seek significant outside funding
which might make it possible to
become financially independent
of the students of the University.
How do the fee assessment
and the station's budget break
down? First, about $18,500, or
54% of the referendum money,
would go into power increase and
stereo equipment expenditures
much needed by the station. Why
a power increase? To qualify for
Cooperation for Public
Broadcasting and Federal funds
for non-commercial stations, a
minimum of 250 watts station
power is required.
Never Again?
By going up in power, KZSU
might never have to depend on
student fee assessments again for
operating funds. Higher power
would also protect the station
from losing its license due to the
commercial-broadcasting lobby's
desire to take 10-watt stations off
the air to make room in the
crowded FM bandwidth for more
commercial stations. And last but
not least, having a power in the
vicinity of 1000 to 3000 watts (as
high as the station would ever
need to go) would ensure that all
Stanford students could receive
the station, something our
present spotty signal coverage
precludes. This is a capital
investment, and the money will
never have to be raised again.
The second major chunk of
money, $11,500, would go
toward continuing KZSU
operating support (the same
function as last year's money).
This includes paying telephone
and teletype bills, maintenance
costs, and such things as office
supplies. This is not quite all the
operating money we need for a
year, as we can raise a limited
amount of money elsewhere

through donations and the like.
But much of this money is
drying up, and we will need
$3,500 o? assessment money to
cover lost revenue. For example,
the national ad agency which
provides us with AM advertising
income has gone bankrupt, leaving
us with $1000 of bad debts and
slim prospects for future ad
income.
As well, the money we have
been getting for the sale of our
Public Affairs tapes to the
University is an odds-on bet to be
squeezed out of existence by the
University's Budget Adjustment
Program, leaving us in a position
where it would be very difficult in
the future to provide an expensive
and time-consuming service such
as coverage of the Franklin
Hearings. Assuming that the
