## Public Interest Law Firm Can Help 
### 
Three basic questions have
been asked frequently since we
proposed the formation of
Citizens Advocates at Stanford.
Why should we be involved in a
public interest law project to
begin with? What does a public
interest law firm do? Finally, why
should Stanford students fund it;
what's in it for them?
The most important reason for
supporting public interest
advocacy is simply that this is
our world and we have to live in it
and pass the remainder, if any,
along to our children. If we
perceive serious social, economic,
and political problems to be
solved, there are essentially two
approaches to take. One is to opt
out, making a non-decision and
leaving the management of our
lives and future welfare to those
who "know best."

In effect, to do this is to
surrender to the notion that the
educational process on the college
level serves in part a baby sitting
function, preparing us for the
"big" world outside. The other
approach is to assume
responsibility for the molding of
our affairs on the hope that what
one does in life can make a
difference.
We should recognize that the
shape of America in the future
depends on our view of what
society should be like, and on
what we are and are not willing to
do. Certainly one can hardly
expect benign results from the
"system" if he always allows
someone else to make the basic
policy choices.
Cynical
The cynical non-doer can
hardly expect others to give
deference to his complaints.
Stanford students in the past,
fortunately, have expressed strong
concern for public problems
outside the immediate academic
community and have sought
viable techniques to affect policy.
Now is the time to match that
concern and desire with efforts
and money.
The best way to explain what a
public interest law firm at
Stanford could do is by example
of what two other California firms
have done. Public Advocates, Inc.,
was established in September in
San Francisco. In February it won

a suit declaring that the qualifying
test for city firemen discriminated
against racial minorities.
Pending suits include three
which charge discrimination
against women and minorities in
hiring and promotion by the
University of California, the Bank
of California and the State
employment service. It is also
bringing a suit to declare the
California 90-day voter residency
requirement invalid. This action
followed the U.S. Supreme Court
striking down a similar
Tennessee regulation.
Public Advocates
Public Advocates works closely
with groups such as the NAACP,
the League of Women Voters and
Mexican-American groups in
bringing these actions. Their
biggest problem, according to
staffer Linda Marquez, is an
inadequate research staff to
provide the technical expertise to
back up their legal work. Student
and faculty research support
would be the greatest asset of
Citizens Advocates at Stanford.
The Center for Law in the
Public Interest began operation
two years ago in Los Angeles. This
firm is supported by the Ford
Foundation as well as student
assessments at the Claremont
Colleges in Pomona.
Student-faculty research teams
investigate problems and
recommend litigation which has
been mostly in the environmental

protection field, including
questioning the ecological impact
of a proposed nuclear generating
plant in the Mojave desert and
challenging the request of the City
of Los Angeles to be excused
from meeting the 1975 pollution
standards under the Clean Air
Act. The Center has also
successfully challenged the lack of
provisions for relocation of
families displaced by the Century
Freeway through south Los
Angeles and Watts.
Despite their success, two firms
will not be able to adequately
represent the interests of
California's citizens. It is unlikely
that two dozen would be able to
completely represent the poor,
the disenfranchised, the minorities
and the isolated citizens in their
struggle against the power
interests and well-paid legal staffs
of large corporations and
impersonal governments. But it's a
beginning which must be made.
Still, what's in-this project for
Stanford students? The project
advocated here is clearly not
designed to be a legal aid office
for students or others in the
community. Nonetheless, students
may expect certain benefits to
themselves as members of the
public.
A roll back in telephone rates
that had been illegally raised, or
fair marketing in food stores, or
suits to prevent sex discrimination
in job opportunities would all

citizen advocates
affect students at Stanford. More
immediately, Citizens Advocates
at Stanford provides an
opportunity for students to
participate in a project which can
achieve worthwhile results.
Through the efforts of public
advocates, a Berkeley student
study on marketing has been
transformed from so much paper
into the officially adopted
position of the state government.
Projects involving Citizens
Advocates, SWOPSI, SCIRE and
volunteers could achieve similar
results. Finally, of course, student
legal problems with broad
implications for public policy will
be within Citizens Advocates'
purposes.
In short, Citizens Advocates at
Stanford presents students with
an opportunity to translate their
hopes for a brighter future into
concrete action. Too often noble
sentiments expressed by students
amount to nothing more than idle
chatter.
Here we have a precise
proposal, with structure and
purpose, which can utilize our
energies and efforts in working for
a more just social system. We
must put up or shut up.
