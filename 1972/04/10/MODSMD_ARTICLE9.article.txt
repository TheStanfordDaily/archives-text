## Workers Need Union Now

According to Friday's article in the Daily, Rudy Tham, Teamster
organizer, is a tough guy who uses scare tactics on racist bosses,
threatens reporters, and will do anything to win a union election. He
wants nothing to do with politics; he only wants a decent wage for
workers. So what else is new?
The Teamsters are not a conscious political organization and never
pretended to be. They are a strong trade union willing to fight rough
to get workers better wages and benefits.
A trade union deals with workers' problems from a strictly
economic viewpoint, thinking that a pay raise and more benefits will
solve everything. This is how they negotiated with the complaints of
black workers at the faculty club. The Teamsters supported John
Patterson, but thought a 30c pay riase and an apology from Leonetti
would solve his problems. It would not.
A trade union operates by making a deal or contract with the
boss. Higher wages, benefits and improved job conditions are traded
for continued work and no strikes over a given period of time. The
Teamster contract for Stanford workers may include more than pay
raises. It may mean free education for workers' children. But it will
not mean that the workers, instead of a group of wealthy trustees,
determine what should be taught at Stanford or who should come
here.
Neither the Teamsters nor any other trade union, including USE,
fight for the right of workers to own and run the companies they
work in. But any group who urges Stanford workers to put off the
benefits of having a recognized trade union now, because they can get
a better, more "progressive" union in a few years, does not
understand the present economic situation or the limits of trade
unions.
Lyman has already announced that BAP has so far only cut the
"fringes." In the next year some hard decisions will have to be made
about where to cut. Without a basic union, workers will be powerless
to influence the cuts if Lyman decides Stanford needs less workers.
And as to trade unions—if USE is implying that they can get more

for workers with their new "bread and butter" analysis than the
Teamsters, it is not true. And if they are saying that they can get the
same things for workers when they get elected in a few years, what's
the advantage of waiting?
Limited
If all trade unions are so limited, why should a revolutionary
organization like Venceremos, which believes that working people
should control the country and that armed struggle is necessary to
achieve this, support the Teamsters? Because we think the interests of
the workers are primary, and we are practical. Venceremos has 5
principles of unity—Number 2 is "power to the people" or
"dictatorship of the proletariat." Under this principle we have 5 basic
demands.
The first is: We demand "decent food, clothing, housing, work,
free medical care, and good education for every person in the U.S. and
throughout all the world." We will fight to win the first demand, and
we support anyone else fighting for the same things—and they do not
have to be revolutionary. We know there are workers at Stanford
getting very low wages who need more money now to meet rising
food costs, health costs, etc. To get those things they must be
organized. The Teamsters will help Stanford workers organize to get
some minimum improvements. With the economic crisis getting worse,
Stanford workers cannot afford another year of isolation.
The Teamsters will fight for wages, but you know that won't solve
all the problems workers have. Venceremos has four other demands
listed under "power to the people":
1. Equal economic, political, and social rights for women. An end
to all forms of sexual oppression.
2. People's justice. An end to the tyranny of the rich minority over
the oppressed majority of color and poor and working white people.
3. An end to a professional standing military in the US as long as it
fights wars like the Vietnamese war.
4. Self-determination for all oppressed nations and peoples.
These demands can only be won when the people have control
over this country. If people at Stanford want to fight for these things,
then a trade union is not enough. But don't give up forming a trade
union because it does not go far enough and don't waste your time
trying to make a trade union something it will not be. Recognize that
workers need a disciplined revolutionary organization that is
committed to waging struggle constantly in their interests.
In the faculty club incident, revolutionary and political groups saw
things much differently than the Teamsters. They understood that the
black workers there wanted the support of other Third-world workers
and students to get Leonetti fired and that racism was as much an
issue as the pay raise. Venceremos, the BSU and Roy Boggs, were
sensitive to those needs and offered support.
So if revolutionary and political organizations can support workers
in their struggles, why do we need a trade union? Because all workers
including non-revolutionary ones need to contact other workers for
support. A union through meetings, committees and mailings will set
up opportunities for workers to reach each other. Stanford workers in
particular are isolated geographically. Has anybody on campus ever
seen or spoken to a worker at SLAC?
The isolation of third world workers is most important. Black and
brown workers here have shown through the hospital sit-in last year,
the Tresidder struggles and now the faculty club, that they have the
most unity, and are the most willing to fight against Stanford.
Third world workers need allies in their own struggles, and would
provide strong leadership for other workers on this campus. The
Teamsters, even with their economic viewpoint, will put Third world
workers in contact with each other and with white workers who
would support them. To win political demands, third world workers
will need allies inside and outside the union.
To sum up, Venceremos strongly supports unionization and urges
workers to vote for the Teamsters if they want to be organized to
fight for immediate economic gains. But we know the workers need
more, and that it takes a revolutionary organization to get it.
