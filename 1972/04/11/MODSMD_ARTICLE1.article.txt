# Project Dulcimer: Build & Play
## 
### DIANE NORBURG News Feature 
Stradivarius he's not. But then, he doesn't make
violins; he makes dulcimers. And, so far, he's only
made one.
David Fylstra reached into a large royal purple
bag, gently eased out the finely crafted rosewood
instrument and cradled it in his lap. His dulcimer
represents about 55 hours of work, $65 and three
units of SCIRE credit.
"Music for me is more than an avocation. It's
part of my life," he says. Fylstra faced the problem
familiar to most university students of squeezing in
what they want to do in with what they have to do.
Unlike most, however, Fylstra managed to turn his
pursuit of pleasure into an academically profitable
effort.
Fylstra, a junior majoring in "a weird
combination of English and psych," organized his
interest and time into a SCIRE project for winter
quarter.
Instrument A Tradition
Under the apprenticeship of master guitar
builder, Jena Nicho, of Mountain View, Fylstra
hand-crafted his dulcimer, a four-stringed
instrument which has played a traditional role in
Appalachian folk music.
Building the instrument was the first part of a
four-faceted course outline which Fylstra presented
to the University.
Professor Herbert Nanney, the University
organist, sponsored Fylstra's proposed course which
included learning to play the dulcimer, mastering

some traditional Appalachian music and researching
the history of the instrument.
Nicho Services
Fylstra, whose only previous handiwork had
been a ventriloquist's dummy and a nine-foot
hammock, engaged the services of Nicho to provide
the material and to explain the process of dulcimer
construction.
Nicho turned out to be Dennis Burges, a
disgruntled Ph.D. candidate who fled Phoenix to
become a part of the Bay Area revival trend in
dulcimers.
He recommended that Fylstra fashion his
dulcimer from Brazilian rosewood, a rare and
beautiful wood believed to allow a better tone than
spruce and walnut, which are also used.
Beginning with raw materials, Fylstra cut the top
and bottom of the instrument, constructed the neck
and boiled the side pieces to make the wood pliable
enough to conform to the desired "fiddle" shape.
Braced and Glued
After cutting the sound holes in the top piece
and pounding metal frets in the neck, Fylstra braced
and glued all parts. The scroll head above the neck
includes a maple inlay and holds the ebony pegs
which tighten the strings.
Fylstra's dulcimer was christened with linseed
oil. "It gives the instrument a great organic smell,"
Fylstra related. Four steel guitar strings—three E's
and one G—were then strung.
Two of the strings function as "drone" strings;
they are never fretted when played. The other two,
however, are fretted together and serve as the

melody strings. They can be tuned to different
scales.
Innovation
The four-stringed dulcimer is an innovation
which Joni Mitchell and a few other "progressive"
dulcimer enthusiasts have adopted because of its
greater flexibility. Traditionally, the dulcimer had
three strings: two remain drones and only one is
used for melody.
Fylstra's playing style is also progressive. The
traditional approach was to fret the melody strings
with a wooden stick and brush across all the strings
with a turkey quill. Thanks to the modern age,
Fylstra uses a Bic pen instead of a stick.
Another playing technique is to fret with his
index finger and pluck the drone and melody strings
separately, much like one would play a guitar.
Dulcimer Heydey
In researching playing techniques, music and the
dulcimer's history, Fylstra discovered the
instrument's heyday was from 1850 to 1930 in
Appalachia. It is theorized that the advent of the
radio caused the dulcimer and its accompanying
folk songs to diminish in popularity.
The word "dulcimer" was reportedly taken from
the book of Daniel in the Bible. The name applied
to another instrument which was the precursor of
the piano.
Fylstra is organizing a performance to be given at
8 p.m. Thursday at Tresidder. He hopes to gather
other dulcimer players from the Bay area. An
illustration of playing styles will accompany the
presentation.

what they want to do in with what they have to do.
Unlike most, however, Fylstra managed to turn his
pursuit of pleasure into an academically profitable
effort.
Fylstra, a junior majoring in "a weird
combination of English and psych," organized his
interest and time into a SCIRE project for winter
quarter.
Instrument A Tradition
Under the apprenticeship of master guitar
builder, Jena Nicho, of Mountain View, Fylstra
hand-crafted his dulcimer, a four-stringed
instrument which has played a traditional role in
Appalachian folk music.
Building the instrument was the first part of a
four-faceted course outline which Fylstra presented
to the University.
Professor Herbert Nanney, the University
organist, sponsored Fylstra's proposed course which
included learning to play the dulcimer, mastering

some traditional Appalachian music and researching
the history of the instrument.
Nicho Services
Fylstra, whose only previous handiwork had
been a ventriloquist's dummy and a nine-foot
hammock, engaged the services of Nicho to provide
the material and to explain the process of dulcimer
construction.
Nicho turned out to be Dennis Burges, a
disgruntled Ph.D. candidate who fled Phoenix to
become a part of the Bay Area revival trend in
dulcimers.
He recommended that Fylstra fashion his
dulcimer from Brazilian rosewood, a rare and
beautiful wood believed to allow a better tone than
spruce and walnut, which are also used.
Beginning with raw materials, Fylstra cut the top
and bottom of the instrument, constructed the neck
and boiled the side pieces to make the wood pliable
enough to conform to the desired "fiddle" shape.
Braced and Glued
After cutting the sound holes in the top piece
and pounding metal frets in the neck, Fylstra braced
and glued all parts. The scroll head above the neck
includes a maple inlay and holds the ebony pegs
which tighten the strings.
Fylstra's dulcimer was christened with linseed
oil. "It gives the instrument a great organic smell,"
Fylstra related. Four steel guitar strings—three E's
and one G—were then strung.
Two of the strings function as "drone" strings;
they are never fretted when played. The other two,
however, are fretted together and serve as the

melody strings. They can be tuned to different
scales.
Innovation
The four-stringed dulcimer is an innovation
which Joni Mitchell and a few other "progressive"
dulcimer enthusiasts have adopted because of its
greater flexibility. Traditionally, the dulcimer had
three strings: two remain drones and only one is
used for melody.
Fylstra's playing style is also progressive. The
traditional approach was to fret the melody strings
with a wooden stick and brush across all the strings
with a turkey quill. Thanks to the modern age,
Fylstra uses a Bic pen instead of a stick.
Another playing technique is to fret with his
index finger and pluck the drone and melody strings
separately, much like one would play a guitar.
Dulcimer Heydey
In researching playing techniques, music and the
dulcimer's history, Fylstra discovered the
instrument's heyday was from 1850 to 1930 in
Appalachia. It is theorized that the advent of the
radio caused the dulcimer and its accompanying
folk songs to diminish in popularity.
The word "dulcimer" was reportedly taken from
the book of Daniel in the Bible. The name applied
to another instrument which was the precursor of
the piano.
Fylstra is organizing a performance to be given at
8 p.m. Thursday at Tresidder. He hopes to gather
other dulcimer players from the Bay area. An
illustration of playing styles will accompany the
presentation.

PLAY IT AGAIN SAM—David Fylstra spent 55 hours and $65 to get three units
of credit and a dulcimer. Fylstra hand-crafted his dulcimer and is researching the
history of the instrument.
Stradivarius he's not. But then, he doesn't make
violins; he makes dulcimers. And, so far, he's only
made one.
David Fylstra reached into a large royal purple
bag, gently eased out the finely crafted rosewood
instrument and cradled it in his lap. His dulcimer
represents about 55 hours of work, $65 and three
units of SCIRE credit.
"Music for me is more than an avocation. It's
part of my life," he says. Fylstra faced the problem
familiar to most university students of squeezing in
what they want to do in with what they have to do.
