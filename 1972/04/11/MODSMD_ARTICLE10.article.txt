# Economist Opposes Price Controls
## 
### 
A nationally prominent
Stanford economist urged the
Price Commission not to extend
price controls to meat and other
farm-food products last week.
In testimony delivered to the
commission, Professor G.L. Bach
said: "Housewives are
understandably upset, and a little
jaw-boning by [Treasury]
Secretary [John] Connally may
be all right.
"Certainly people need to feel
that the government is concerned
about food prices.
"But the main purpose of the
Price Commission is not to
stablize every price in sight, Mr.
Meany [AFL-CIO leader George

Meany ] and Prof. Eckstein
[ Harvard economist Otto
Eckstein ] to the contrary
notwithstanding.
"If you try to do that, you will
fail miserably.
"You cannot fix ail prices and
make your decisions stick. The
resulting failure would also wash
away the chance you now have of
exerting a reasonable drag on the
wage-price spiral and on
inflationary expectations."
Holder of the endowed Frank
Buch chair in economics and
public policy at Stanford,
Professor Bach currently is a
consultant to Connally and to the
board of governors of the Federal

Reserve Board .-.vstem.
Irving to fix prices on
nonprocessed farm products
would load ' *o massive
inefficiencies and to massive
administrative problems," he
warned. For the government to
consider price controls on farm
products at the same time it is
pushing up prices through support
programs is "ridiculous," he
added.
Updated Guideposts
Bach suggested that "a set of
wage-price guideposts, updated
from the Kennedy guideposts of
the early 1960'5, could . . . help
significantly to build a
noni n flationary consensus"

among the public.
'The greatest potential of
wage-price guideposts ... is to
help crystallize a latent, widely
shared feeling that 'reasonable'
wage and price behavior by
individual unions and firms is
needed to achieve continuing
prosperity without inflation. .. .
"Without such a working
consensus, the Federal Reserve,
the Congress and the
Administration in power will
intermittently, or persistently, be
up against the dilemma of
validating inflationary wage and
price increases, or enforcing
unemployment on the economy
as the price of avoiding inflation,
or adopting widespread direct
wage and price controls that will
work only temporarily."
Calling for "plain talk" on
wage and profits, Bach said: "The
argument made by many labor
leaders that profits as well as
prices should be fixed is obviously
wrong.
Bach characterized the Price
Commission's work to date as
"not a great prformance, but a
good one, all things considered."
While the commission cannot
long withstand strong market
forces, he said, it can help slow
down the wage-price spiral and
provide "a sound foundation for
less inflationary expectations"
among all sectors of the public.

down the wage-price spiral and
provide "a sound foundation for
less inflationary expectations"
among all sectors of the public.
A nationally prominent
Stanford economist urged the
Price Commission not to extend
price controls to meat and other
farm-food products last week.
In testimony delivered to the
commission, Professor G.L. Bach
said: "Housewives are
understandably upset, and a little
jaw-boning by [Treasury]
Secretary [John] Connally may
be all right.
"Certainly people need to feel
that the government is concerned
about food prices.
"But the main purpose of the
Price Commission is not to
stablize every price in sight, Mr.
Meany [AFL-CIO leader George

Meany ] and Prof. Eckstein
[ Harvard economist Otto
Eckstein ] to the contrary
notwithstanding.
"If you try to do that, you will
fail miserably.
"You cannot fix ail prices and
make your decisions stick. The
resulting failure would also wash
away the chance you now have of
exerting a reasonable drag on the
wage-price spiral and on
inflationary expectations."

Buch chair in economics and
public policy at Stanford,

consultant to Connally and to the
board of governors of the Federal

Reserve Board .-.vstem.
Irving to fix prices on
nonprocessed farm products
would load ' *o massive
inefficiencies and to massive
administrative problems," he
warned. For the government to
consider price controls on farm
products at the same time it is
pushing up prices through support
programs is "ridiculous," he
added.
Updated Guideposts
Bach suggested that "a set of
wage-price guideposts, updated
from the Kennedy guideposts of
the early 1960'5, could . . . help
significantly to build a
noni n flationary consensus"

among the public.
'The greatest potential of
wage-price guideposts ... is to
help crystallize a latent, widely
shared feeling that 'reasonable'
wage and price behavior by
individual unions and firms is
needed to achieve continuing
prosperity without inflation. .. .
"Without such a working
consensus, the Federal Reserve,
the Congress and the
Administration in power will
intermittently, or persistently, be
up against the dilemma of
validating inflationary wage and
price increases, or enforcing
unemployment on the economy
as the price of avoiding inflation,
or adopting widespread direct
wage and price controls that will
work only temporarily."
Calling for "plain talk" on
wage and profits, Bach said: "The
argument made by many labor
leaders that profits as well as
prices should be fixed is obviously
wrong.
Bach characterized the Price
Commission's work to date as
"not a great prformance, but a
good one, all things considered."
While the commission cannot
long withstand strong market
forces, he said, it can help slow
down the wage-price spiral and
provide "a sound foundation for
less inflationary expectations"
among all sectors of the public.
