Fifteen Stanford faculty

scholars, scientists, and artists
awarded fellowships this year by

number of faculty members
selected as Guggenheim Fellows,

"demonstrated accomplishment in

the past and strong promise for

endowed Max H. Stein
professorship of physics, will
conduct experimental studies in

professor of English, will spend
