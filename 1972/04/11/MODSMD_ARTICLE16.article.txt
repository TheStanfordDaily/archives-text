# Disappointing 'Total Theater'
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
A well defined style is
necessary for any choreographer.
But, when the style rarely changes
in its mode of presentation, the
original excitement is lost in a
sense of vague but disturbing
monotony. This is what happened
last Wednesday night at Alwin
Nikolais' performance in Cal
Berkeley's Zellerbach Auditorium.
Nikolais is definitely unique.
He believes that dance is an art
form which must be heavily
supported by the media of lights
and music in order to create a
sense of "total theater". In order
to create the total theatrical
experience, Nikolais uses light
shows, colored spotlights, films,
electronic music, and of course,
dance. Though at first startling
and at times fascinating, the
performance begins to degenerate
into an almost predictable
consistency that left my
sensibilities lulled to a dull halt.
The first dance,
"Somniloquy", choreographed in
1967, centered around the themes
of reality and illusion. Nikolais
did a superb job in creating this
aura of "illusion". Through the
use of dimmed and changing
lights, Nikolais was able to give to
the choreography a sense of
suspension and arrested
movement.
Reality and Illusion
Through the use of lights, he
would also focus on one dancer
and then suddenly turn the light
off that particular dancer as he
was in the midst of performing a
movement, and would thus create
a sense of falling into space. It
seemed that as each of the
movements came to fruitation, it

fell first into a shadow and then
into nothingness. There was little
logical cohesion or unity in the
choreography. This was
particularly noticeable in one
series of group movements where
all the dancers lay face up on the
floor and at random times would
jump up and down, thus
effectively giving the impression
of popping popcorn.
To heighten the contrast
between reality and illusion,
Nikolais later placed a group of
dancers in bright lights and one
further back in the shadows and
had them dance in opposition to
each other. The effect was
astounding. Also, near the end the
backdrop rose and the whole
performance was carried into the
realms of backstage. The audience
was no longer under the "illusion"
of a "stage show". The dancers
became part of us and we of
them.
The second dance, "Foreplay",
dealt with the inhuman and
mechanized manner in which men
and women communicate or
rather do not communicate with
each other. We were witness to an
impersonal, almost cold
choreography, intensified only at
certain times by a great increase in
tension.
In this dance and throughout
the evening, there was little or no
direct contact between the
dancers. We were forced to view
the performance in a totally
objective fashion with little or no
emotional let-up.
Highpoint of Evening
The only part in the whole
performance with which we could
emotionally identify, and thus the

high-point of the evening, was
when half way through
"Foreplay", the dancers comically
carried each other around as if
they were carrying automatons.
The audience burst into loud
laughter and at the end of the
dance, the applause was
enthusiastic.
In the third dance, "Tent",
choreographed in 1968, Nikolais
presented a tour de force in the
art of "total theater". His basic
prop, a large white tent originally
hung from the ceiling, later
lowered and distended itself to
become several tents, a ceiling, a
wall with holes in it, robes and
sheets which cover ghostlike
figures.
The tent was attached to the
upper regions of the stage by
wires near the end of which were
small silver balls. At one point,
the dancers twirled the wires so
that the balls looked like twirling
planets in space.
Just when the dance began to
get monotonous, dancers dressed
in black and red, faces covered
with masks, glided onstage on
their knees. These "midget
figures" added an effective eerie

quality to the dance.
Nikolais makes good use of
those masks later on in the dance
when the dancers lay on their
backs under the tent so that the
audience saw nothing but an
occasional foot or hand come out
of one of the holes in the sheet,
covered by a mask, and thus
Nikolais throws us into a world
where nothing follows any
preconceived notion or pattern.
The electronic music in this
dance was far too loud. However,
there were interesting sound
effects of breaking glass and
bubbles bursting in water which
added to the sense of vacuousness
that permeated the dance. At the
end, the tent lowered itself again
and smothers the dancers amidst
chaotic sound effects. We had the
feeling that the dancers and the
dance had been destroyed by the
tent itself.
Though Nikolais really does
have some of the most original
choreography to date and though
he does express perfectly the
mechanical impersonality of our
age, three dances of exactly the
same governing concept were too
much to handle in one evening.

each other. The effect was
astounding. Also, near the end the
backdrop rose and the whole
performance was carried into the
realms of backstage. The audience
was no longer under the "illusion"
of a "stage show". The dancers
became part of us and we of
them.
The second dance, "Foreplay",
dealt with the inhuman and
mechanized manner in which men
and women communicate or
rather do not communicate with
each other. We were witness to an
impersonal, almost cold
choreography, intensified only at
certain times by a great increase in
tension.
In this dance and throughout
the evening, there was little or no
direct contact between the
dancers. We were forced to view
the performance in a totally
objective fashion with little or no
emotional let-up.
Highpoint of Evening
The only part in the whole
performance with which we could
emotionally identify, and thus the

high-point of the evening, was
when half way through
"Foreplay", the dancers comically
carried each other around as if
they were carrying automatons.
The audience burst into loud
laughter and at the end of the
dance, the applause was
enthusiastic.
In the third dance, "Tent",
choreographed in 1968, Nikolais
presented a tour de force in the
art of "total theater". His basic
prop, a large white tent originally
hung from the ceiling, later
lowered and distended itself to
become several tents, a ceiling, a
wall with holes in it, robes and
sheets which cover ghostlike
figures.
The tent was attached to the
upper regions of the stage by
wires near the end of which were
small silver balls. At one point,
the dancers twirled the wires so
that the balls looked like twirling
planets in space.
Just when the dance began to
get monotonous, dancers dressed
in black and red, faces covered
with masks, glided onstage on
their knees. These "midget
figures" added an effective eerie

quality to the dance.
Nikolais makes good use of
those masks later on in the dance
when the dancers lay on their
backs under the tent so that the
audience saw nothing but an
occasional foot or hand come out
of one of the holes in the sheet,
covered by a mask, and thus
Nikolais throws us into a world
where nothing follows any
preconceived notion or pattern.
The electronic music in this
dance was far too loud. However,
there were interesting sound
effects of breaking glass and
bubbles bursting in water which
added to the sense of vacuousness
that permeated the dance. At the
end, the tent lowered itself again
and smothers the dancers amidst
chaotic sound effects. We had the
feeling that the dancers and the
dance had been destroyed by the
tent itself.
Though Nikolais really does
have some of the most original
choreography to date and though
he does express perfectly the
mechanical impersonality of our
age, three dances of exactly the
same governing concept were too
much to handle in one evening.
A well defined style is
necessary for any choreographer.
But, when the style rarely changes
in its mode of presentation, the
original excitement is lost in a
sense of vague but disturbing
monotony. This is what happened
last Wednesday night at Alwin
Nikolais' performance in Cal
Berkeley's Zellerbach Auditorium.
Nikolais is definitely unique.
He believes that dance is an art
form which must be heavily
supported by the media of lights
and music in order to create a
sense of "total theater". In order
to create the total theatrical
experience, Nikolais uses light
shows, colored spotlights, films,
electronic music, and of course,
dance. Though at first startling
and at times fascinating, the
performance begins to degenerate
into an almost predictable
consistency that left my
sensibilities lulled to a dull halt.
The first dance,
"Somniloquy", choreographed in
1967, centered around the themes
of reality and illusion. Nikolais
did a superb job in creating this
aura of "illusion". Through the
use of dimmed and changing
lights, Nikolais was able to give to
the choreography a sense of
suspension and arrested
movement.
Reality and Illusion
Through the use of lights, he
would also focus on one dancer
and then suddenly turn the light
off that particular dancer as he
was in the midst of performing a
movement, and would thus create
a sense of falling into space. It
seemed that as each of the
movements came to fruitation, it

fell first into a shadow and then
into nothingness. There was little
logical cohesion or unity in the
choreography. This was
particularly noticeable in one
series of group movements where
all the dancers lay face up on the
floor and at random times would
jump up and down, thus
effectively giving the impression
of popping popcorn.
To heighten the contrast
between reality and illusion,
Nikolais later placed a group of
dancers in bright lights and one
further back in the shadows and
had them dance in opposition to
each other. The effect was
astounding. Also, near the end the
backdrop rose and the whole
performance was carried into the
realms of backstage. The audience
was no longer under the "illusion"

Nikolais makes good use of
those masks later on in the dance
when the dancers lay on their
backs under the tent so that the
audience saw nothing but an
occasional foot or hand come out
of one of the holes in the sheet,
covered by a mask, and thus
Nikolais throws us into a world
where nothing follows any
preconceived notion or pattern.
The electronic music in this
dance was far too loud. However,
there were interesting sound
effects of breaking glass and
bubbles bursting in water which
added to the sense of vacuousness
that permeated the dance. At the
end, the tent lowered itself again
and smothers the dancers amidst
chaotic sound effects. We had the
feeling that the dancers and the
dance had been destroyed by the
tent itself.
Though Nikolais really does
have some of the most original
choreography to date and though
he does express perfectly the
mechanical impersonality of our
age, three dances of exactly the
same governing concept were too
much to handle in one evening.
