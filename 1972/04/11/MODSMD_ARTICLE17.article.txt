U.S. Widens Air War
SAIGON — The 12-day North Viet
namese offensive appeared to have
slowed significantly yesterday after
major weekend battling on the north
em front which brought victory claims
for Saigon's forces.
The United States widened the air
war by sending 852 heavy bombers
deeper into North Vietnam than ever
before in their first strikes around a
major enemy city.
Officials said the raid by Strato
fortresses near Vinh, 145 miles north
of the DMZ, was a calculated show of
strength by President Nixon. None of
the bombers was reported hit in the
strike, but continued 852 strikes
would run a high risk that one or more
of America's mightiest bombers may
be shot down.
U.S. command acknowledged that
while U.S. troop strength inside
Vietnam continued to dwindle, down
5,500 to 90,000 in the last reporting
period, it was swelling outside the
country. The 7th Fleet picked up at
least 3,000 men last week as more
ships steamed into Vietnamese waters.
With the dispatch of whole squad
rons of fighter-bombers to Southeast
Asia, Air Force and Marine strength
also has grown, although official
statistics do not yet show it. The latest
totals of U.S. forces in Vietnam, as of
Thursday, were: Army 64,600, Navy
4,600, Marines 400, Air Force 20,300,
and Coast Guard 100.
Pact Forbids Germ Use
WASHINGTON - The United States,
the Soviet Union and 72 other nations
yesterday signed a treaty prohibiting
the use, manufacture of stockpiling of
germ-warfare weapons and calling for
the destruction of already existing
arms.
In a ceremony at the State
Department witnessed by President
Nixon, Secretary of State William P.
Rogers signed the pact on behalf of
the United States.
The agreement is the first interna
tional accord in more than 25 years
that calls for the destruction of
weapons already in existence.
For the United States the germ
warfare pact formalizes decisions made
three years ago by President Nixon
when he ordered an end to develop
ment of germ-warfare weapons. The
destruction of American stockpile of
such weapons has been under way
since then.
The treaty does not cover chemical
weapons. The United States objected
that methods for adequate enforce
ment that would cover chemical
weapons do not exist at this time.

The germ-warfare treaty will go
into effect after 22 nations ratify the
agreement, including the United
States, Great Britain and the Soviet
Union.
Hijack Money Found
SALT LAKE CITY, Utah - All but
$30 of the half-million dollars which
the government says was paid to the
hijacker of a United Air Lines 727 jet
has been recovered, the FBI told a
U.S. magistrate yesterday.
The FBI said it found the
$499,970, a gun and parachute on the
"premises" of Richard Floyd McCoy
Jr., 29, of Provo, Utah. McCoy has
been charged with air piracy in the
Friday hijacking.
ITT Memo Debated
WASHINGTON — A month after
telling three interviewers that lobbyist
Dita Beard wrote a disputed memo on
International Telephone & Telegraph
Corp. stationery, Rep. Bob Wilson,
R-Calif., quoted her yesterday as
denying its authenticity.
Publication of the memo by col
umnist Jack Anderson precipitated the
tangled hearings now in their seventh
week.
Wilson, an influential Republican
fund-raiser, quoted the ITT lobbyist as
saying, "It's not the memo I wrote."
The memo appears to draw a
connection between an ITT com
mitment of at least $200,000 to
underwrite the Republican National
Convention in August and the out-of
court settlement of an antitrust action
pending against the conglomerate.
Oscars Awarded
HOLLYWOOD - "The French Con
nection" won the Oscar as the best
film of 1971 at the 44th annual
Motion Picture Academy Awards last
night. Gene Hackman of the same
movie won Best Actor while Jane
Fonda received Best Actress for her
role in "Klute."
Davis Jurors Questioned
SAN JOSE — The judge in the Angela
Davis trial questioned jurors yesterday
on whether they had read about the
slaying of a Black Panther here last
week, then sternly instructed them to
forget about it if they had.
The questioning of jurors came
after a half-day of chambers sessions in
which defense attorneys apparently
complained that news media coverage
of the ambush slaying of James Carr
had mentioned Davis.
Superior Court Judge Richard Ar
nason asked several questions to
determine if jurors had been affected
by the stories.

Five jurors and three alternates
raised their hands to indicate that they
had read the stories, but all indicated
they could still be fair.
"You are instructed," the judge
said, "there has been no evidence
offered in this case of any relationship
between James Carr and the defendant
in this case." He added that neither
was there evidence of any link
between the killing and Davis.
Carr, 29, was mowed down by
gunfire as he left his home in San Jose
Thursday morning to go to work. Two
persons have been booked for investi
gation of his murder.
During the weekend recess local
news media reported details of the
ambush slaying, some noting that Can
was an admirer and once a prison
cellmate of the late George Jackson.
(The Daily reported last week that
Carr was believed to be a "super
radical" by some and a police informer
by others because of his wide range of
radical contacts. For example, al
though his wife's family was close to
the Angela Davis defense fund, his
sister's husband is a former Los
Angeles Police Department informer.)
During the afternoon session, a
prosecution witness told of disarming
one of the convicts in the Aug. 7,
1970, gun battle and described the
first shots fired in the violence.
Eugene Fontaine, an assistant coun
ty coroner, said he watched the gun
fight between kidnapers inside a van
and a San Quentin Prison guard
crouched and aiming a rifle at the van.
British Threats?
BELFAST — A pregnant housewife
who was beaten, tarred and feathered
accused the Irish Republican Army
yesterday of ordering her to leave her
home or be shot with her three
children.
Philomena McGuckin, a 24-year-old
Roman Catholic, said she had been
warned at her home in Belfast's
Ballymurphy district: "Get out in 48
hours or you and your children will be
shot."
As she packed family belongings
before moving to a secret new address,
McGuckin, who is five months
pregnant, said: "I have no choice.
They will shoot me if I do not move
and they will shoot my children too."
McGuckin's relatives said the death
threat had been issued by the IRA's
militant provisional wing. They
claimed it was a gang of provisionals
that burst into her home Sunday and
clubbed McGuckin with hockey
sticks in front of her terrified children,
aged eight months to five years.

ITT Memo Debated
WASHINGTON — A month after
telling three interviewers that lobbyist
Dita Beard wrote a disputed memo on
International Telephone & Telegraph
Corp. stationery, Rep. Bob Wilson,
R-Calif., quoted her yesterday as
denying its authenticity.
Publication of the memo by col
umnist Jack Anderson precipitated the
tangled hearings now in their seventh
week.
Wilson, an influential Republican
fund-raiser, quoted the ITT lobbyist as
saying, "It's not the memo I wrote."
The memo appears to draw a
connection between an ITT com
mitment of at least $200,000 to
underwrite the Republican National
Convention in August and the out-of
court settlement of an antitrust action
pending against the conglomerate.
Oscars Awarded
HOLLYWOOD - "The French Con
nection" won the Oscar as the best
film of 1971 at the 44th annual
Motion Picture Academy Awards last
night. Gene Hackman of the same
movie won Best Actor while Jane
Fonda received Best Actress for her
role in "Klute."
Davis Jurors Questioned
SAN JOSE — The judge in the Angela
Davis trial questioned jurors yesterday
on whether they had read about the
slaying of a Black Panther here last
week, then sternly instructed them to
forget about it if they had.
The questioning of jurors came
after a half-day of chambers sessions in
which defense attorneys apparently
complained that news media coverage
of the ambush slaying of James Carr
had mentioned Davis.
Superior Court Judge Richard Ar
nason asked several questions to
determine if jurors had been affected
by the stories.

Five jurors and three alternates
raised their hands to indicate that they
had read the stories, but all indicated
they could still be fair.
"You are instructed," the judge
said, "there has been no evidence
offered in this case of any relationship
between James Carr and the defendant
in this case." He added that neither
was there evidence of any link
between the killing and Davis.
Carr, 29, was mowed down by
gunfire as he left his home in San Jose
Thursday morning to go to work. Two
persons have been booked for investi
gation of his murder.
During the weekend recess local
news media reported details of the
ambush slaying, some noting that Can
was an admirer and once a prison
cellmate of the late George Jackson.
(The Daily reported last week that
Carr was believed to be a "super
radical" by some and a police informer
by others because of his wide range of
radical contacts. For example, al
though his wife's family was close to
the Angela Davis defense fund, his
sister's husband is a former Los
Angeles Police Department informer.)
During the afternoon session, a
prosecution witness told of disarming
one of the convicts in the Aug. 7,
1970, gun battle and described the
first shots fired in the violence.
Eugene Fontaine, an assistant coun
ty coroner, said he watched the gun
fight between kidnapers inside a van
and a San Quentin Prison guard
crouched and aiming a rifle at the van.
British Threats?
BELFAST — A pregnant housewife
who was beaten, tarred and feathered
accused the Irish Republican Army
yesterday of ordering her to leave her
home or be shot with her three
children.
Philomena McGuckin, a 24-year-old
Roman Catholic, said she had been
warned at her home in Belfast's
Ballymurphy district: "Get out in 48
hours or you and your children will be
shot."
As she packed family belongings
before moving to a secret new address,
McGuckin, who is five months
pregnant, said: "I have no choice.
They will shoot me if I do not move
and they will shoot my children too."
McGuckin's relatives said the death
threat had been issued by the IRA's
militant provisional wing. They
claimed it was a gang of provisionals
that burst into her home Sunday and
clubbed McGuckin with hockey
sticks in front of her terrified children,
aged eight months to five years.
U.S. Widens Air War
SAIGON — The 12-day North Viet
namese offensive appeared to have
slowed significantly yesterday after
major weekend battling on the north
em front which brought victory claims
for Saigon's forces.
The United States widened the air
war by sending 852 heavy bombers
deeper into North Vietnam than ever
before in their first strikes around a
major enemy city.
Officials said the raid by Strato
fortresses near Vinh, 145 miles north
of the DMZ, was a calculated show of
strength by President Nixon. None of
the bombers was reported hit in the
strike, but continued 852 strikes
would run a high risk that one or more
of America's mightiest bombers may
be shot down.
U.S. command acknowledged that
while U.S. troop strength inside
Vietnam continued to dwindle, down
5,500 to 90,000 in the last reporting
period, it was swelling outside the
country. The 7th Fleet picked up at
least 3,000 men last week as more
ships steamed into Vietnamese waters.
With the dispatch of whole squad
rons of fighter-bombers to Southeast
Asia, Air Force and Marine strength
also has grown, although official
statistics do not yet show it. The latest
totals of U.S. forces in Vietnam, as of
Thursday, were: Army 64,600, Navy
4,600, Marines 400, Air Force 20,300,
and Coast Guard 100.
Pact Forbids Germ Use
WASHINGTON - The United States,
the Soviet Union and 72 other nations
yesterday signed a treaty prohibiting
the use, manufacture of stockpiling of
germ-warfare weapons and calling for
the destruction of already existing
arms.
In a ceremony at the State
Department witnessed by President
Nixon, Secretary of State William P.
Rogers signed the pact on behalf of
the United States.
The agreement is the first interna
tional accord in more than 25 years
that calls for the destruction of
weapons already in existence.
For the United States the germ
warfare pact formalizes decisions made
three years ago by President Nixon
when he ordered an end to develop
ment of germ-warfare weapons. The
destruction of American stockpile of
such weapons has been under way
since then.
The treaty does not cover chemical
weapons. The United States objected
that methods for adequate enforce
ment that would cover chemical
weapons do not exist at this time.

The germ-warfare treaty will go
into effect after 22 nations ratify the
agreement, including the United
States, Great Britain and the Soviet
Union.
Hijack Money Found
SALT LAKE CITY, Utah - All but
$30 of the half-million dollars which
the government says was paid to the
hijacker of a United Air Lines 727 jet

The FBI said it found the
$499,970, a gun and parachute on the
"premises" of Richard Floyd McCoy
Jr., 29, of Provo, Utah. McCoy has
been charged with air piracy in the

BELFAST — A pregnant housewife
who was beaten, tarred and feathered
accused the Irish Republican Army
yesterday of ordering her to leave her
home or be shot with her three
children.
Philomena McGuckin, a 24-year-old
Roman Catholic, said she had been
warned at her home in Belfast's
Ballymurphy district: "Get out in 48
hours or you and your children will be
shot."
As she packed family belongings
before moving to a secret new address,
McGuckin, who is five months
pregnant, said: "I have no choice.
They will shoot me if I do not move
and they will shoot my children too."
McGuckin's relatives said the death
threat had been issued by the IRA's
militant provisional wing. They
claimed it was a gang of provisionals
that burst into her home Sunday and
clubbed McGuckin with hockey
sticks in front of her terrified children,
aged eight months to five years.
U.S. Widens Air War
SAIGON — The 12-day North Viet
namese offensive appeared to have
slowed significantly yesterday after
major weekend battling on the north
em front which brought victory claims
for Saigon's forces.
The United States widened the air
war by sending 852 heavy bombers
deeper into North Vietnam than ever
before in their first strikes around a
major enemy city.
Officials said the raid by Strato
fortresses near Vinh, 145 miles north
of the DMZ, was a calculated show of
strength by President Nixon. None of
the bombers was reported hit in the
strike, but continued 852 strikes
would run a high risk that one or more
of America's mightiest bombers may
be shot down.
U.S. command acknowledged that
while U.S. troop strength inside
Vietnam continued to dwindle, down
5,500 to 90,000 in the last reporting
period, it was swelling outside the
country. The 7th Fleet picked up at
least 3,000 men last week as more
ships steamed into Vietnamese waters.
With the dispatch of whole squad
rons of fighter-bombers to Southeast
Asia, Air Force and Marine strength
also has grown, although official
statistics do not yet show it. The latest
totals of U.S. forces in Vietnam, as of
Thursday, were: Army 64,600, Navy
4,600, Marines 400, Air Force 20,300,
and Coast Guard 100.
Pact Forbids Germ Use
WASHINGTON - The United States,
the Soviet Union and 72 other nations
yesterday signed a treaty prohibiting
the use, manufacture of stockpiling of
germ-warfare weapons and calling for
the destruction of already existing
arms.
In a ceremony at the State
Department witnessed by President
Nixon, Secretary of State William P.
Rogers signed the pact on behalf of
the United States.
The agreement is the first interna
tional accord in more than 25 years
that calls for the destruction of
weapons already in existence.
For the United States the germ
warfare pact formalizes decisions made
three years ago by President Nixon
when he ordered an end to develop
ment of germ-warfare weapons. The
destruction of American stockpile of
such weapons has been under way
since then.
The treaty does not cover chemical
weapons. The United States objected
that methods for adequate enforce
ment that would cover chemical
weapons do not exist at this time.

The germ-warfare treaty will go
into effect after 22 nations ratify the
agreement, including the United
States, Great Britain and the Soviet
Union.
Hijack Money Found
SALT LAKE CITY, Utah - All but
$30 of the half-million dollars which
the government says was paid to the
hijacker of a United Air Lines 727 jet
has been recovered, the FBI told a
U.S. magistrate yesterday.
The FBI said it found the
$499,970, a gun and parachute on the
"premises" of Richard Floyd McCoy
Jr., 29, of Provo, Utah. McCoy has
been charged with air piracy in the
Friday hijacking.
ITT Memo Debated
WASHINGTON — A month after
telling three interviewers that lobbyist
Dita Beard wrote a disputed memo on
International Telephone & Telegraph
Corp. stationery, Rep. Bob Wilson,
R-Calif., quoted her yesterday as
denying its authenticity.
Publication of the memo by col
umnist Jack Anderson precipitated the
tangled hearings now in their seventh
week.
Wilson, an influential Republican
fund-raiser, quoted the ITT lobbyist as
saying, "It's not the memo I wrote."
The memo appears to draw a
connection between an ITT com
mitment of at least $200,000 to
underwrite the Republican National
Convention in August and the out-of
court settlement of an antitrust action
pending against the conglomerate.
Oscars Awarded
HOLLYWOOD - "The French Con
nection" won the Oscar as the best
film of 1971 at the 44th annual
Motion Picture Academy Awards last
night. Gene Hackman of the same
movie won Best Actor while Jane
Fonda received Best Actress for her
role in "Klute."
Davis Jurors Questioned
SAN JOSE — The judge in the Angela
Davis trial questioned jurors yesterday
on whether they had read about the
slaying of a Black Panther here last
week, then sternly instructed them to
forget about it if they had.
The questioning of jurors came
after a half-day of chambers sessions in
which defense attorneys apparently
complained that news media coverage
of the ambush slaying of James Carr
had mentioned Davis.
Superior Court Judge Richard Ar
nason asked several questions to
determine if jurors had been affected
by the stories.

Five jurors and three alternates
raised their hands to indicate that they
had read the stories, but all indicated
they could still be fair.
"You are instructed," the judge
said, "there has been no evidence
offered in this case of any relationship
between James Carr and the defendant
in this case." He added that neither
was there evidence of any link
between the killing and Davis.
Carr, 29, was mowed down by
gunfire as he left his home in San Jose
Thursday morning to go to work. Two
persons have been booked for investi
gation of his murder.
During the weekend recess local
news media reported details of the
ambush slaying, some noting that Can
was an admirer and once a prison
cellmate of the late George Jackson.
(The Daily reported last week that
Carr was believed to be a "super
radical" by some and a police informer
by others because of his wide range of
radical contacts. For example, al
though his wife's family was close to
the Angela Davis defense fund, his
sister's husband is a former Los
Angeles Police Department informer.)
During the afternoon session, a
prosecution witness told of disarming
one of the convicts in the Aug. 7,
1970, gun battle and described the
first shots fired in the violence.
Eugene Fontaine, an assistant coun
ty coroner, said he watched the gun
fight between kidnapers inside a van
and a San Quentin Prison guard
crouched and aiming a rifle at the van.
