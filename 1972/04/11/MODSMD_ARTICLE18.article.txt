# Barry Lashes Soviets
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Republican Congressional candidate
Bob Barry declared last night that he
wanted to end the Vietnam War "as
fast as we can" as long as the "Soviets
can't go in someplace else."
Barry, who is opposing Rep. Paul
McCloskey and Dr. Royce Cole in the
June 6 Republican primary, made his
remarks to a group of 20 people in the
Junipero lounge.
Despite his claim that he was
"against all war," the former New
York congressman nevertheless said
that he "wouldn't want to violate our
treaties."
Barry conceded that the United
States might have mistakenly bombed
civilians "once or twice," but
expressed doubt that the U.S. is
dropping anti-personnel bombs. Barry
contended that he "would be very
disturbed" if this were true.
Barry told the audience, "It's
amazing that you guys should
complain about that since we're
dropping bombs instead of using

you!"
In berating the Soviet Union, Barry
exclaimed, "Communism is
tyranny . .. over the minds of men."
He continued, "We have emerged
from the Second World War possessing
the only muscle in the free world" and
stated that the U.S. has been called
upon by other nations to use that
muscle to keep those nations "free."
The audience appeared somewhat
surprised when Barry informed them,
"Our adversary in Southeast Asia is
the Soviet Union. It is not North
Vietnam—they're pawns." He warned
the group, "You'll be wiped off the
map if we don't keep up" with the
Soviets.
Barry explained the way certain
campaigns are run by saying that
Congressmen "go out and talk peace"
because they have to get re-elected.
When asked if that wasn't hypocritical,
Barry shrugged and said, "It's
politics."
Asserting that the United States has
"won the cold war," Barry stated,

"Now the Viet Cong can't get
anywhere because the South
Vietnamese are owning their own land
for the first time in their lives."
Answering a question concerning
the recent re-election of South
Vietnamese President Nguyen Van
Thieu, Barry declared, "Democracy is
not something that a country
struggling for power and independence
can afford . .. They're very content to
have a strong-arm government and
they need it."
On other issues, Barry said he
hoped there would be an all-volunteer
army "the sooner .. . the better."
While Barry said he felt he could
not support amnesty which would
restore draft resisters to the same
position "as the guy who had to go
and get his limbs shot off," the
candidate contended that he would
back a plan allowing draft resisters to
serve the United States for an
equivalent amount of time in civilian
work.
Barry, a resident of Woodside, was
defeated for re-election to Congress
from New York in 1964 after serving
three terms. He then moved to
Southern California. In 1966, Barry
challenged the then-Congressman John
V. Tunney and was narrowly defeated.
Barry has previously contested
McCloskey for a Republican
Congressional nomination, being
defeated by a small margin in that
1968 primary. Two years ago Barry
was once again defeated in his try for
the State Senate.
Barry has been the target of
McCloskey on several occasions for
allegedly lying about the amount of
seniority he would carry with him if
elected to Congress.

exclaimed, "Communism is
tyranny . .. over the minds of men."
He continued, "We have emerged
from the Second World War possessing
the only muscle in the free world" and
stated that the U.S. has been called
upon by other nations to use that
muscle to keep those nations "free."
The audience appeared somewhat
surprised when Barry informed them,
"Our adversary in Southeast Asia is
the Soviet Union. It is not North
Vietnam—they're pawns." He warned
the group, "You'll be wiped off the
map if we don't keep up" with the
Soviets.
Barry explained the way certain
campaigns are run by saying that
Congressmen "go out and talk peace"
because they have to get re-elected.
When asked if that wasn't hypocritical,
Barry shrugged and said, "It's
politics."
Asserting that the United States has
"won the cold war," Barry stated,

"Now the Viet Cong can't get
anywhere because the South
Vietnamese are owning their own land
for the first time in their lives."
Answering a question concerning
the recent re-election of South
Vietnamese President Nguyen Van
Thieu, Barry declared, "Democracy is
not something that a country
struggling for power and independence
can afford . .. They're very content to
have a strong-arm government and
they need it."
On other issues, Barry said he
hoped there would be an all-volunteer
army "the sooner .. . the better."
While Barry said he felt he could
not support amnesty which would
restore draft resisters to the same
position "as the guy who had to go
and get his limbs shot off," the
candidate contended that he would
back a plan allowing draft resisters to
serve the United States for an
equivalent amount of time in civilian
work.
Barry, a resident of Woodside, was
defeated for re-election to Congress
from New York in 1964 after serving
three terms. He then moved to
Southern California. In 1966, Barry
challenged the then-Congressman John
V. Tunney and was narrowly defeated.
Barry has previously contested
McCloskey for a Republican
Congressional nomination, being
defeated by a small margin in that
1968 primary. Two years ago Barry
was once again defeated in his try for
the State Senate.
Barry has been the target of
McCloskey on several occasions for
allegedly lying about the amount of
seniority he would carry with him if
elected to Congress.
Republican Congressional candidate
Bob Barry declared last night that he
wanted to end the Vietnam War "as
fast as we can" as long as the "Soviets
can't go in someplace else."
Barry, who is opposing Rep. Paul
McCloskey and Dr. Royce Cole in the
June 6 Republican primary, made his
remarks to a group of 20 people in the
Junipero lounge.
Despite his claim that he was
"against all war," the former New
York congressman nevertheless said
that he "wouldn't want to violate our
treaties."
Barry conceded that the United
States might have mistakenly bombed
civilians "once or twice," but
expressed doubt that the U.S. is
dropping anti-personnel bombs. Barry
contended that he "would be very
disturbed" if this were true.
Barry told the audience, "It's
amazing that you guys should
complain about that since we're
dropping bombs instead of using

you!"
In berating the Soviet Union, Barry
exclaimed, "Communism is
tyranny . .. over the minds of men."
