# New CJP Officers Named
## 
### 
Menlo Park attorney Jack Robert
son and 1971 Stanford law graduate
Carole Greene have been appointed
hearing officers for the Campus
Judicial Panel (CJP).
The two were selected by President
Richard Lyman following recommen
dations of Law Professors Paul Brest,
Jack Friedenthal, Byron Sher and
Gerald Gunther.
Greene now serves as a law clerk to
Federal District Judge Robert Peck
ham. She was recently named to the
UCLA Law School faculty, which she
will join at the end of her clerkship.
Robertson is a member of the firm
of Robertson, Alexander, Luther and
Esselstein. A 1952 Stanford law
graduate, he has been President of the
San Mateo Legal Aid Society and is
currently a trustee of the Sequoia
Union High School District.
Santa Clara University Law profes
sor Lillian Altree has also announced
her resignation as a CJP hearing
officer, citing lack of time for further
work.

Altree heard the so-called "Place
ment Center 4" case, which was
marred by disruptions, closed hearings
and charges of bias against her. The
tires of her car were slashed while she
presided over the hearing.
The full CJP is now considering the
Fundamental Standard violation
charges against Third World Liberation
Front member Kwonping Ho. The
charges arose from a January protest
in the Faculty Club. The CJP is
expected to announce its verdict
shortly.
