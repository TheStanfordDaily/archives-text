# SRM-Backed 'Collective' Slate Pursues Student Presidency
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
(First in a series of articles on the
major presidential candidates.)
According to one of its members,
"The Collective" differs from the
other three slates running for the
ASSU Council of Presidents in that
"we will not compromise our original
political principles to get elected."
"The Collective" is headed by
freshman Rodney Palmer of the Black
Students Union. Running for vice
president on the slate is Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement (SRM) mem
ber Rosie Wolf. Running as members
of the Council are Third World
Liberation Front member Kwonping
Ho and Young Crow Pete Knutson.
Knutson was suspended for three
quarters last month for his role in a
November Placement Center disrup
tion. Ho also faces possible suspension
in two separate cases now in litigation
before the Campus Judicial Panel.
Knutson was an ASSU Senator prior
to his suspension.

Presidential Slate

Contrary to recent speculation,
ASSU rules would allow either Knut
son or Ho to serve on the Council if
elected since the rules only refer to the
presidential and vice presidential can
didates when requiring membership in
good standing in the ASSU, and hence
registration as a student.
"The Collective," which has SRM
backing, claims it "will make student
government confront the following
issues: institutional racism, oppression
of women, (University) complicity in
the war, workers issues."
Dual Power
However, the major point empha
sized by the Palmer-Wolf slate is that
they "can assert community control in
the University only by creating dual
power and neutralizing the Adminis
tration's authority."
Explaining the "dual power" con
cept, Ho said "we will not derive our
legitimacy from the bureaucratic para
meters set by the Administration." He
continued, "The Collective" hopes to
form a check on the Administration
by working within those "parameters"
and then going beyond them if they
consider the original outcome unac
ceptable.
"The Collective" is critical of the
ASSU fee assessments, including the
six being offered in the upcoming

election, since they "get across only if
they affect every single person" in the
student body. Ho explained that they
were in favor of "socialized fee
assessments." which only benefit seg
ments of the community. They also
said such issues were essentially "petty
questions" in light of the more serious
social questions affecting the commun
ity.
The slate has proposed the estab
lishment of a Committee to Investigate
Racism as a "sort of grievance board
that doesn't have to be recognized by
the University." The Committee will
be open to the complaints of "any
student, worker or faculty" and the
complaints will be "duly redressed."
Dissatisfied
Knutson told the Daily that "The
Collective" is already sufficiently dis
satisfied with the Administration's
grievance committee to go beyond the
Administration "parameters" to set up
the Committee to Investigate Racism.
A moratorium on Campus Judicial
Panel (CJP) hearings is another of the
major goals of "The Collective."
Knutson was suspended at the
recommendation of the CJP and Ho is
now on trial before the Panel. The
slate proposes that the CJP morator
ium stay in effect until the University
Judicial System recently approved by
the ASSU Senate is voted on in
referendum by the students.
The slate believes the "emergency
situation" regarding the "unfairness"
of the CJP allows them to once again
request action beyond the University's
"parameters."
End Discrimination
"The Collective" also proposes that
the University's "discriminatory"

admissions quotas for women be
ended. They feel that the University
should "have some accredited
women's classes" starting from the
current base on n on-accredited classes
offered by the Women's Center. There
is one woman on the slate.
The firing of former Associate
English Professor H. Bruce Franklin as
an ASSU Professor is also part of the
slate's platform. "The Collective" is
critical of the current Council of
Presidents, saying "they should have
done everything they could to imple
ment the referendum" in which
students voted 2615 to 2114 against
the Franklin firing.

issues: institutional racism, oppression
of women, (University) complicity in
the war, workers issues."
Dual Power
However, the major point empha
sized by the Palmer-Wolf slate is that
they "can assert community control in
the University only by creating dual
power and neutralizing the Adminis
tration's authority."
Explaining the "dual power" con
cept, Ho said "we will not derive our
legitimacy from the bureaucratic para
meters set by the Administration." He
continued, "The Collective" hopes to
form a check on the Administration
by working within those "parameters"
and then going beyond them if they
consider the original outcome unac
ceptable.
"The Collective" is critical of the
ASSU fee assessments, including the
six being offered in the upcoming

election, since they "get across only if
they affect every single person" in the
student body. Ho explained that they
were in favor of "socialized fee
assessments." which only benefit seg
ments of the community. They also
said such issues were essentially "petty
questions" in light of the more serious
social questions affecting the commun
ity.
The slate has proposed the estab
lishment of a Committee to Investigate
Racism as a "sort of grievance board
that doesn't have to be recognized by
the University." The Committee will
be open to the complaints of "any
student, worker or faculty" and the
complaints will be "duly redressed."
Dissatisfied
Knutson told the Daily that "The
Collective" is already sufficiently dis
satisfied with the Administration's
grievance committee to go beyond the
Administration "parameters" to set up
the Committee to Investigate Racism.
A moratorium on Campus Judicial
Panel (CJP) hearings is another of the
major goals of "The Collective."
Knutson was suspended at the
recommendation of the CJP and Ho is
now on trial before the Panel. The
slate proposes that the CJP morator
ium stay in effect until the University
Judicial System recently approved by
the ASSU Senate is voted on in
referendum by the students.
The slate believes the "emergency
situation" regarding the "unfairness"
of the CJP allows them to once again
request action beyond the University's
"parameters."
End Discrimination
"The Collective" also proposes that
the University's "discriminatory"

admissions quotas for women be
ended. They feel that the University
should "have some accredited
women's classes" starting from the
current base on n on-accredited classes
offered by the Women's Center. There
is one woman on the slate.
The firing of former Associate
English Professor H. Bruce Franklin as
an ASSU Professor is also part of the
slate's platform. "The Collective" is
critical of the current Council of
Presidents, saying "they should have
done everything they could to imple
ment the referendum" in which
students voted 2615 to 2114 against
the Franklin firing.

THE COLLECTIVE—The Stanford Rehabilitation Movement is backing a slate
running for the ASSU Council of Presidents in next week's election. They are (1.
to r.) Pete Knutson, Rosie Wolf, Kwonping Ho and Rodney Palmer.
(First in a series of articles on the
major presidential candidates.)
According to one of its members,
"The Collective" differs from the
other three slates running for the
ASSU Council of Presidents in that
"we will not compromise our original
political principles to get elected."
"The Collective" is headed by
freshman Rodney Palmer of the Black
Students Union. Running for vice
president on the slate is Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement (SRM) mem
ber Rosie Wolf. Running as members
of the Council are Third World
Liberation Front member Kwonping
Ho and Young Crow Pete Knutson.
Knutson was suspended for three
quarters last month for his role in a
November Placement Center disrup
tion. Ho also faces possible suspension
in two separate cases now in litigation
before the Campus Judicial Panel.
Knutson was an ASSU Senator prior
to his suspension.

Presidential Slate

Contrary to recent speculation,
ASSU rules would allow either Knut
son or Ho to serve on the Council if
elected since the rules only refer to the
presidential and vice presidential can
didates when requiring membership in
good standing in the ASSU, and hence
registration as a student.
"The Collective," which has SRM
backing, claims it "will make student
government confront the following
issues: institutional racism, oppression
of women, (University) complicity in
the war, workers issues."
