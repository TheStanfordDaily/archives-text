# Phoenix Suns Pick Terry In Basketball Draft
## 
### 
Claude Terry, Stanford's all-time
scoring leader, was drafted yesterday
by the Phoenix Suns in the National
Basketball Association's annual college
draft.
The 6'5" Terry, who started at

guard on the varsity basketball team
for three years, was picked by the
Suns in the third round.
"I'm really happy," Terry said last
night. Although Phoenix had not
contacted him immediately after the
draft, he said, "I just want to play. I'm
really looking forward to playing pro
basketball.
"My major consideration," Terry
said, "is where I can play the most."
In the American Basketball As
sociation's draft earlier this year, Terry
was chosen by the Denver Rockets in
the first round, as Denver's second
pick. "I've visited Denver," Terry
commented, "and it's a nice city. But
both of them are nice cities."
