### 
Residences participating in the 1972-73 Spring Housing Draw will
be holding Open Houses for interested students today thru Friday.
The Housing Office urges the various residences to hold and to
publicize their Open Houses.
It also encourages students to attend these in order to become
acquainted with each residence. The Housing Office notes that the
preferences listed on the student draw cards should reflect the
student's familiarity and interest in the residences.
