# Ballot Confusion
## Election Postponed One Week 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
ASSU President Doug McHenry
announced yesterday afternoon that
the primary election scheduled to take
place tomorrow and Thursday has
been postponed until April 18 and 19.
At a meeting attended by several
presidential candidates, McHenry said,
"After much deliberation, the Elec
tions Commissioner, the Chairman of
the Senate, and myself are in agree
ment that a fair, well-run election this
week would be impossible."
This is the second election this year
which has had to be re-scheduled for a
later date. Confusion at the polls this
fall forced the Student Senate elec

tions to be postponed.
The presidential candidates at the
meeting were against the postpone
ment of the election. Most wanted to
try to work out the difficulties, at
least with regards to the presidential
election, and go on as scheduled, or
perhaps a day later. Election Commis
sioner Johnny Lawson said there
would still be problems postponing the
election for just a day which could not
be worked out.
Presidential candidate Scott Burke
was visibly angered by the delay. "This
jneans that we have to campaign for
another grueling week. This is just
ridiculous! I think that everyone
responsible should be impeached!"
Presidential hopeful Chris Hocker
showed no surprise at the announce
ment. Hocker said later of the delay,
"I think it's right on."
Several Problems
McHenry cited three reasons for the
delay: late additions to the final
ballot, no workable system for the
polls, and the problem of getting
ballots to the overseas campuses on
time.
According to the ASSU Constitu
tion, petitions to put candidates,
referenda, and amendments should
have been forwarded to Elections
Commissioner Lawson six days before
the election. McHenry said complica
tions arose when the Student Senate
was still putting fee referenda and
Constitutional amendments on the
ballot as late as Thursday night.
McHenry said the Senate's decision
to put the complete text of every
referendum, amendment, and proposal
on each ballot, instead of simply

identifying each one, added to the
difficulties in preparing the ballot.
As of yesterday afternoon, the final
ballot had still not been prepared.
Polling System
As for the polling system, McHenry
said that there were not enough people
to man the polls, and plans for
providing each polling place with a
copy of the Constitution, in accor
dance with the wishes of the Senate,
had not been made.
The Constitution also states that
the Elections Commissioner must
"present to the President for his
approval a detailed plan of operation
for each election not less than five
days before each election." As of
Sunday, three days before the elec
tion, McHenry was still unable to even
find the Elections Commissioner.
McHenry explained the situation
with the overseas campuses was the
most difficult problem. According to
By-law amendments passed by the
Senate March 9, the overseas campuses
should have been informed by the
Elections Commission of the process
for voting in the election by letter two
weeks ago.
The letter to the overseas campuses
is required to include an explanation
of the election, and confirmation of
the receipt of the letter, the method of
sending candidate's names (those per
sons overseas who plan to run for
office), how to send back election
results, and the reimbursement pro
cedure for expenses occured in the
overseas balloting and delivery.
Two-Thirds Majority
It was still unknown yesterday
afternoon whether the final ballot

would be mailed or telegraphed.
McHenry also announced at the
meeting that the Citizens Advocates
referendum which will be voted on
next week must pass by a two-thirds
majority, not a simple majority.
Senate Chairman James Jefferson
previously had interpreted the Consti
tution to mean that the Advocates'
proposal needed only a majority to
pass because of the negative option, or
refund clause, which it includes. The
Citizens Advocates referendum re
quests money for a period of three
years.
According to the Constitution, any
assessment which "requires expendi
tures for longer than one year must
receive a two-thirds vote by the
members of the Association voting in a
general election."
Technical Violation
McHenry admitted that delaying
the elections another week technically
violates the Constitution. The Consti
tution states that the election of the
President and the Vice-president of the
Association must take place during the
second and third weeks of the quarter.
The postponement of the election
means the two officers will be elected
during the third and fourth weeks of
the quarter.
McHenry explained that students
and candidates have the choice of
having a fair election and violating the
Constitution, or going ahead with the
election on scheduleâ€”which will also
violate Constitutional rules.
The student Senate has the power
to overturn the postponement, but it
is unlikely that the Senate will meet
before Thursday.
