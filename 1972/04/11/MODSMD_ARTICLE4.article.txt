# $1 Per Quarter
## KZSU Asks Money For Expansion 
### PATTY FELS 
KZSU is asking students to vote a
$3 fee assessment on April 18, three
times the amount the station received
this year.
The referendum calls for students
to pay $1 per quarter next year, plus
$1 in summer quarter of 1973. There
is no refund option.
About half of the $35,000 from the
assessment will pay for a new transmit
ter which will increase the station's
power from 10 to 750 watts. The
other half is for operating expenses.
KZSU is pushing the power increase
for two major reasons. The staff fears
that the Federal Communications
Commission may begin eliminating

low power stations, and a power
increase would prevent this. It would
also allow KZSU to broadcast for the
first time in stereo."
While the station professes to fear
elimination, Business Manager Will
Pape admitted that the FCC has not
actually threatened KZSU. In fact no
college radio stations have ever been
pushed off the air for being only
10-watt stations.
All Talk
"We have a feeling it's going to
come but it's all talk at this point,"
Pape said. He said that the power
increase is "essentially a safeguard for
the future."
Although a statement distributed
by the station implies immediate
switch-over to stereo, this service is a
year away, according to Pape. A power
increase is the first step but Pape says
"laborious rewiring" will also be
necessary.
KZSU anticipates stereo service
from one studio by spring quarter,
1973. The only obstacle to this, in
Pape's opinion, is another issue like
the Franklin trial since staffers would
be too busy to work on the necessary
remodeling.
The KZSU staff also hopes that
after the increase they will receive
federal funding, unavailable to 10-watt
stations. The KZSU assessment state
ment mentions "new revenues" and
suggests that "higher power would
quite possibly mean the end of

KZSU's reliance upon student assess
ment as a means of support."
Federal Funds
When questioned about the federal
funds, Pape claimed that the Corpora
tion for Public Broadcasting Systems
had praised KZSU and indicated that
KZSU would easily qualify for their
funding, providing that the station
increased its power to at least 250
watts.

Fee Assessment

Pape also hopes that higher power
will increase FM underwriting. Com
mercial advertising is illegal on FM
radio, but underwriting—just begun
last summer-allows a brief announce
ment of sponsorship at the end of each
hour.
Pape maintains that advertisers have
refused to underwrite because KZSU is
only a 10-watt station, "People think
that 10-watt stations are electronic
sandboxes," he said. "They feel that
when you get above 10 watts you're
suddenly responsible."
KZSU raised $3,000 from FM
underwriting last year. "I have great
hopes that FM underwriting will bring
in more money next year," said Pape.
Another result of the power in
crease is that it will fill in the gaps in
KZSU's broadcasting area. While the
station can be picked up as far away as
Berkeley, there are large areas in

between which do not receive the
signal. But Pape admits this improve
ment would not affect on-campus
students.
Budget Surplus
The power increase will cost around
$18,500. Operating expenses are es
timated at $21,000 and income
potentials at about $6,500, according
to a budget report prepared by Pape.
Subtracting the operating costs and
power increase from the income and
the $35,000 from the assessment
leaves a surplus of about $2,000.
The surplus will be used to keep
KZSU on the air this summer. Last
year's summer operating costs were
about $2,200 according to Pape. The
station's downstairs bathroom also
needs remodeling. "That would be our
choice," said Pape, "operating one
summer or having a bathroom."
Will KZSU ask for more money in
fall, 1973? The staff insists that this
will be the last power increase. Pape
hopes that future fee assessments will
be for only $1 for one quarter.
One important question is whether,
with its increased off-campus audi
ence, KZSU will begin to concentrate
less on student affairs and moryon
retaining its new listeners. Station
manager John Broholm insists that
KZSU will remain a student station.
"We have a large off-campus
audience now," he said. "But we still
consider campus coverage our primary
responsibility."

Will KZSU ask for more money in
fall, 1973? The staff insists that this
will be the last power increase. Pape
hopes that future fee assessments will
be for only $1 for one quarter.
One important question is whether,
with its increased off-campus audi
ence, KZSU will begin to concentrate
less on student affairs and moryon
retaining its new listeners. Station
manager John Broholm insists that
KZSU will remain a student station.
"We have a large off-campus
audience now," he said. "But we still
consider campus coverage our primary
responsibility."
KZSU is asking students to vote a
$3 fee assessment on April 18, three
times the amount the station received
this year.
The referendum calls for students
to pay $1 per quarter next year, plus
$1 in summer quarter of 1973. There
is no refund option.
About half of the $35,000 from the
assessment will pay for a new transmit
ter which will increase the station's
power from 10 to 750 watts. The
other half is for operating expenses.
KZSU is pushing the power increase
for two major reasons. The staff fears
that the Federal Communications
Commission may begin eliminating

low power stations, and a power
increase would prevent this. It would
also allow KZSU to broadcast for the
first time in stereo."
While the station professes to fear
elimination, Business Manager Will
Pape admitted that the FCC has not
actually threatened KZSU. In fact no
college radio stations have ever been
pushed off the air for being only
10-watt stations.
All Talk
"We have a feeling it's going to
come but it's all talk at this point,"
Pape said. He said that the power
increase is "essentially a safeguard for
the future."
Although a statement distributed
by the station implies immediate
switch-over to stereo, this service is a
year away, according to Pape. A power
increase is the first step but Pape says
"laborious rewiring" will also be
necessary.
KZSU anticipates stereo service
from one studio by spring quarter,
1973. The only obstacle to this, in
Pape's opinion, is another issue like
the Franklin trial since staffers would
be too busy to work on the necessary
remodeling.
The KZSU staff also hopes that
after the increase they will receive
federal funding, unavailable to 10-watt
stations. The KZSU assessment state
ment mentions "new revenues" and
suggests that "higher power would
quite possibly mean the end of

KZSU's reliance upon student assess
ment as a means of support."
Federal Funds
When questioned about the federal
funds, Pape claimed that the Corpora
tion for Public Broadcasting Systems
had praised KZSU and indicated that
KZSU would easily qualify for their
funding, providing that the station
increased its power to at least 250
watts.

Fee Assessment

Pape also hopes that higher power
will increase FM underwriting. Com
mercial advertising is illegal on FM
radio, but underwriting—just begun
last summer-allows a brief announce
ment of sponsorship at the end of each
hour.
Pape maintains that advertisers have
refused to underwrite because KZSU is
only a 10-watt station, "People think
that 10-watt stations are electronic
sandboxes," he said. "They feel that
when you get above 10 watts you're
suddenly responsible."
KZSU raised $3,000 from FM
underwriting last year. "I have great
hopes that FM underwriting will bring
in more money next year," said Pape.
Another result of the power in
crease is that it will fill in the gaps in
KZSU's broadcasting area. While the
station can be picked up as far away as
Berkeley, there are large areas in

between which do not receive the
signal. But Pape admits this improve
ment would not affect on-campus
students.
Budget Surplus
The power increase will cost around
$18,500. Operating expenses are es
timated at $21,000 and income
potentials at about $6,500, according
to a budget report prepared by Pape.
Subtracting the operating costs and
power increase from the income and
the $35,000 from the assessment
leaves a surplus of about $2,000.
The surplus will be used to keep
KZSU on the air this summer. Last
year's summer operating costs were
about $2,200 according to Pape. The
station's downstairs bathroom also
needs remodeling. "That would be our
choice," said Pape, "operating one
summer or having a bathroom."
