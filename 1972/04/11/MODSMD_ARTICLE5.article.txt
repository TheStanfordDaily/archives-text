## Register To Vote 
### 
This Thursday is the last day on which Californians may register to
vote in the June 6 primary election. The Daily urges all those who
have not already done so to register.
The Daily applauds those responsible for the registration drives on
the campus, who have seen to it that registrars of voters are both
numerous and easy to find. No one at Stanford is entitled to claim
that he or she chould not locate a registrar.
Students who register will have an excellent opportunity to
influence the electorate's decision in at least two crucial races for
office.
Whoever wins the Democratic presidential primary statewide will
garner all of California's 271 convention delegates. Since these
delegates will represent more than one-sixth the number needed to
select the party's nominee, those who vote in the primary will have a
major say regarding who may be the next President.
Local voters in the primary will also have the opportunity to vote
in either party's interesting Congressional race. The Republicans may
choose between incumbent Pete McCloskey, a Stanford alumnus, and
conservatives Royce Cole and Bob Barry.
Running in the Democratic primary are San Jose attorney and
Stanford graduate Jim Stewart, Santa Clara Mayor Gary Gillmor and
two lesser known candidates, Charles Duke and Raymond Chote.
Those failing to register by Thursday will lose their chance to vote in
either of these contests.
Don't be counted among the Silent Majority on June 6. Register to
vote.
