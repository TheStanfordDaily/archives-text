# environmental ethic
## Homo Anthropocentricus

(Author's Note: The following article was submitted for publication
in the Daily two years ago this spring, but never appeared in print.
Immediately following submission, U.S. forces invaded Cambodia. It
promptly became clear that comments regarding human impact on the
remote future could not be thoughtfully received by a readership
whose emotions were saturated with apprehension and concern for
the immediate present. I therefore withdrew the article.
Recent remarks by Pirages and Ehrlich, and by McCarthy relating
to future global technological evolution prompt me to resurrect the
article I submitted at that earlier date.)
Human fertility rates in the United States have fallen rapidly
through most of the past decade. It is to be hoped that current
attention to the population issue will contribute to a quite voluntary
and intentional resumption of this trend, which experienced a slight
reversal last year. Shortly, we may be able to sell the rest of the world
an environmental ethic, along with more common merchandise.
It concerns me, however, that most of the discussion regarding the
carrying capacity of the earth sounds like it emanates from a species
Homo anthropocentricus.
I would like to suggest that if there is an Earth Day next April, we
consider erecting a 5001 foot long display. Its function would be to
graphically illustrate the evolution of life on earth. With careful
research, I am sure we could make a walk through the past quite
fascinating.
Display
Each foot along the display would represent one million years. Our
starting point would be designated -5000 ft., corresponding to 5
billion years in the past. It is my impression that we would observe
something like the following as we proceeded along our walk:
- 5 billion yrs. -5000 ft. Formation of earth & Sun
-4 billion yrs. -4000 ft. Appearance of single
celled organisms
-1 billion yrs. -1000 ft. Appearance of primitive
multi-celled organisms
-300 to -200 million -300 to -200 ft. Amphibians numerous
yrs.
-200 to -60 million -200 to -60 ft. Dinosaurs numerous
yrs.
-55 million yrs. -55 ft. Horse the size of a dog
-20 million yrs. -20 ft. Horse the size of a
Shetland pony
-5 million yrs. -5 ft. Proto-human branches
off from ape
-1 million yrs. -1 ft. Early men (100,000
persons)
-10,000 yrs. -0.1 inch Last ice age (5 million
persons)
April 1971 0 inch "Present" (3.7 billion
persons)
April 2000 +0.0005 inch 29 yrs. in future
(7 billion persons?)
April 1,001,971 +1 foot One million yrs. in
future
A human population curve might be plotted, scaled at one vertical
foot per 100 million human beings. One million years ago (1 foot into
the past) the population curve would be one hundredth of an inch

high. Ten thousand years ago (0.1) inch into the past) the curve would
be half an inch high. At the time of Christ, 0.02 inch into the past, it
would be two feet high. In April 1971 it would be 37 feet high and
climbing vertically upward at a rate of some 37 feet for each
horizontal one-half of a thousandth of an inch.
Evolving
The sun is expected to keep burning pretty much as is for another
billion years or so. It would appear therefore that life could, in
principle, keep evolving for approximately "another mile" into the
future. Perhaps it is too much to expect of us yet that we concern
ourselves with very much of this next mile, even though our present
actions may have an enormous influence upon its character. We might
then only continue the display for one additional foot, or another
million years. Perhaps some likely projection for human population
size might be carried that short step into the future.
On a nearby panel I would suggest identifying all of the non-human
species that man outnumbers by a body count ratio in the
neighborhood or in excess of one million to one. Among the
mammals, we would find listed the Mountain Gorilla, Orangutan,
Pacific Grey Whale, Blue Whale, . . . , Southern Sea Otter, Florida
Cougar, Asiatic Lion, the Javan, Sumatran, and Black Rhinoceros,
several species of tigers, the Wild Asiatic Buffalo, North American
Wood Bison, Grizzly Bear, Timber Wolf, . . . ; not to mention the
plight of any of the endangered smaller mammals, birds, reptiles,
amphibians, fish, and plant species.
Parks
In the United States we have set aside one percent of our land as
National Parks. This measure of our commitment to the continued
evolution of the larger wild creatures can be compared to our
dedication to freeways and their rights of way, which also cover
approximately one percent of the land. The Africans have designated
approximately two percent of their land as wildlife reserves. The
prospects for the continued evolution of the larger wild creatures, and
for a substantial component of wildlife in general, for even a tiny step
into the future would not appear overwhelmingly bright.
If there should be any intelligent inhabitants of this plantet after
travelling one additional "foot" into the future, what will they think
of our having anointed ourselves Homo sapiens, "wise man?"
Time will tell.

whose emotions were saturated with apprehension and concern for
the immediate present. I therefore withdrew the article.
Recent remarks by Pirages and Ehrlich, and by McCarthy relating
to future global technological evolution prompt me to resurrect the
article I submitted at that earlier date.)
Human fertility rates in the United States have fallen rapidly
through most of the past decade. It is to be hoped that current
attention to the population issue will contribute to a quite voluntary
and intentional resumption of this trend, which experienced a slight
reversal last year. Shortly, we may be able to sell the rest of the world
an environmental ethic, along with more common merchandise.
It concerns me, however, that most of the discussion regarding the
carrying capacity of the earth sounds like it emanates from a species
Homo anthropocentricus.
I would like to suggest that if there is an Earth Day next April, we
consider erecting a 5001 foot long display. Its function would be to
graphically illustrate the evolution of life on earth. With careful
research, I am sure we could make a walk through the past quite
fascinating.
Display
Each foot along the display would represent one million years. Our
starting point would be designated -5000 ft., corresponding to 5
billion years in the past. It is my impression that we would observe
something like the following as we proceeded along our walk:
- 5 billion yrs. -5000 ft. Formation of earth & Sun
-4 billion yrs. -4000 ft. Appearance of single
celled organisms
-1 billion yrs. -1000 ft. Appearance of primitive
multi-celled organisms
-300 to -200 million -300 to -200 ft. Amphibians numerous
yrs.
-200 to -60 million -200 to -60 ft. Dinosaurs numerous
yrs.
-55 million yrs. -55 ft. Horse the size of a dog
-20 million yrs. -20 ft. Horse the size of a
Shetland pony
-5 million yrs. -5 ft. Proto-human branches
off from ape
-1 million yrs. -1 ft. Early men (100,000
persons)
-10,000 yrs. -0.1 inch Last ice age (5 million
persons)
April 1971 0 inch "Present" (3.7 billion
persons)
April 2000 +0.0005 inch 29 yrs. in future
(7 billion persons?)
April 1,001,971 +1 foot One million yrs. in
future
A human population curve might be plotted, scaled at one vertical
foot per 100 million human beings. One million years ago (1 foot into
the past) the population curve would be one hundredth of an inch

high. Ten thousand years ago (0.1) inch into the past) the curve would
be half an inch high. At the time of Christ, 0.02 inch into the past, it
would be two feet high. In April 1971 it would be 37 feet high and
climbing vertically upward at a rate of some 37 feet for each
horizontal one-half of a thousandth of an inch.
Evolving
The sun is expected to keep burning pretty much as is for another
billion years or so. It would appear therefore that life could, in
principle, keep evolving for approximately "another mile" into the
future. Perhaps it is too much to expect of us yet that we concern
ourselves with very much of this next mile, even though our present
actions may have an enormous influence upon its character. We might
then only continue the display for one additional foot, or another
million years. Perhaps some likely projection for human population
size might be carried that short step into the future.
On a nearby panel I would suggest identifying all of the non-human
species that man outnumbers by a body count ratio in the
neighborhood or in excess of one million to one. Among the
mammals, we would find listed the Mountain Gorilla, Orangutan,
Pacific Grey Whale, Blue Whale, . . . , Southern Sea Otter, Florida
Cougar, Asiatic Lion, the Javan, Sumatran, and Black Rhinoceros,
several species of tigers, the Wild Asiatic Buffalo, North American
Wood Bison, Grizzly Bear, Timber Wolf, . . . ; not to mention the
plight of any of the endangered smaller mammals, birds, reptiles,
amphibians, fish, and plant species.
Parks
In the United States we have set aside one percent of our land as
National Parks. This measure of our commitment to the continued
evolution of the larger wild creatures can be compared to our
dedication to freeways and their rights of way, which also cover
approximately one percent of the land. The Africans have designated
approximately two percent of their land as wildlife reserves. The
prospects for the continued evolution of the larger wild creatures, and
for a substantial component of wildlife in general, for even a tiny step
into the future would not appear overwhelmingly bright.
If there should be any intelligent inhabitants of this plantet after
travelling one additional "foot" into the future, what will they think
of our having anointed ourselves Homo sapiens, "wise man?"
Time will tell.

through most of the past decade. It is to be hoped that current
attention to the population issue will contribute to a quite voluntary
and intentional resumption of this trend, which experienced a slight
reversal last year. Shortly, we may be able to sell the rest of the world
an environmental ethic, along with more common merchandise.
It concerns me, however, that most of the discussion regarding the
carrying capacity of the earth sounds like it emanates from a species
Homo anthropocentricus.
I would like to suggest that if there is an Earth Day next April, we
consider erecting a 5001 foot long display. Its function would be to
graphically illustrate the evolution of life on earth. With careful
research, I am sure we could make a walk through the past quite
fascinating.
Display
Each foot along the display would represent one million years. Our
starting point would be designated -5000 ft., corresponding to 5
billion years in the past. It is my impression that we would observe
something like the following as we proceeded along our walk:
- 5 billion yrs. -5000 ft. Formation of earth & Sun
-4 billion yrs. -4000 ft. Appearance of single
celled organisms
-1 billion yrs. -1000 ft. Appearance of primitive
multi-celled organisms
-300 to -200 million -300 to -200 ft. Amphibians numerous
yrs.
-200 to -60 million -200 to -60 ft. Dinosaurs numerous
yrs.
-55 million yrs. -55 ft. Horse the size of a dog
-20 million yrs. -20 ft. Horse the size of a
Shetland pony
-5 million yrs. -5 ft. Proto-human branches
off from ape
-1 million yrs. -1 ft. Early men (100,000
persons)
-10,000 yrs. -0.1 inch Last ice age (5 million
persons)
April 1971 0 inch "Present" (3.7 billion
persons)
April 2000 +0.0005 inch 29 yrs. in future
(7 billion persons?)
April 1,001,971 +1 foot One million yrs. in
future
A human population curve might be plotted, scaled at one vertical
foot per 100 million human beings. One million years ago (1 foot into
the past) the population curve would be one hundredth of an inch

high. Ten thousand years ago (0.1) inch into the past) the curve would
be half an inch high. At the time of Christ, 0.02 inch into the past, it
would be two feet high. In April 1971 it would be 37 feet high and
climbing vertically upward at a rate of some 37 feet for each
horizontal one-half of a thousandth of an inch.
Evolving
The sun is expected to keep burning pretty much as is for another
billion years or so. It would appear therefore that life could, in
principle, keep evolving for approximately "another mile" into the
future. Perhaps it is too much to expect of us yet that we concern
ourselves with very much of this next mile, even though our present
actions may have an enormous influence upon its character. We might
then only continue the display for one additional foot, or another
million years. Perhaps some likely projection for human population
size might be carried that short step into the future.
On a nearby panel I would suggest identifying all of the non-human
species that man outnumbers by a body count ratio in the
neighborhood or in excess of one million to one. Among the
mammals, we would find listed the Mountain Gorilla, Orangutan,
Pacific Grey Whale, Blue Whale, . . . , Southern Sea Otter, Florida
Cougar, Asiatic Lion, the Javan, Sumatran, and Black Rhinoceros,
several species of tigers, the Wild Asiatic Buffalo, North American
Wood Bison, Grizzly Bear, Timber Wolf, . . . ; not to mention the
plight of any of the endangered smaller mammals, birds, reptiles,
amphibians, fish, and plant species.
Parks
In the United States we have set aside one percent of our land as
National Parks. This measure of our commitment to the continued
evolution of the larger wild creatures can be compared to our
dedication to freeways and their rights of way, which also cover
approximately one percent of the land. The Africans have designated
approximately two percent of their land as wildlife reserves. The
prospects for the continued evolution of the larger wild creatures, and
for a substantial component of wildlife in general, for even a tiny step
into the future would not appear overwhelmingly bright.
If there should be any intelligent inhabitants of this plantet after
travelling one additional "foot" into the future, what will they think
of our having anointed ourselves Homo sapiens, "wise man?"
Time will tell.
