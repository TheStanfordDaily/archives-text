## Special Events A Positive Service 
### 
David elder

As I read the column on the
Special Events fee-assessment in
Friday's Daily, I found myself
saying I wouldn't vote for such a
losing proposition; however, I
then realized I was reading two
days of interviews condensed into
four columns of selected material.
A few points within that article
must be set straight before the
rest of this will begin to make
sense.
Last year's chairman, Adam
Levin, writer of the original
assessment, assumed he was free
to spend the funds as he saw fit
and in the process left us with
$26,000 to start this school year
rather than the $29,000 implied
by the article. My instructions
when taking this position were to
conserve the capital, try to break
even or, if possible, turn a profit.
The article mentions a one
show $7,000 loss yet fails to
mention a $3,500 profit for the

summer nor the $1,000 made on
our last rock show. In essence, our
operation is paying for itself with
the exception of that
extraordinary $7,000 loss.
(Consider for a moment the
favorably reviewed Don McLean
show of a few weeks ago in Santa
Clara which lost for its
professional promoters some
$12,000).
I am saying that losses in rock
promotion are the rule rather than
the exception for those who are
forced to promote on a one shot
basis. Profits are turned by some
universities, but these are in the
most part by rural institutions.
Bizarre
Secondly, we are competing
for talent in a rather bizarre
market. My undergraduate work
was completed at a midwestern
institution that taxed students $7
per semester for entertainment
events. The resultant $180,000

they have to spend every year
brings them national attractions
on a monthly basis, a full time
director and, when coupled with
similar situations throughout the
country, an inflationary effect
nothing short of fantastic.
We, of course, are the victims
of that effect (the Chicago show
which made $1,000 last year
when the talent cost was $15,000
would face disaster since this
year's price for the same
attraction is $25,000).
I am not saying now, nor was I
saying when the article was
written that Stanford must
present big budget entertainment
attractions. What I am saying is
that by charging a student price of
some $2 to $2.50 per show and
being prepared to take a possible
loss on a show we might be better
able to provide a student service. I
see no benefit in charging prices
similar to those at Winterland or
the Circle Star.
Variety
They have a variety we can't
match and accommodations we
can't duplicate. By bracing
outselves for a possible loss, we
may also plan and present
otherwise marginal shows (you
would be amazed at the effect
local high school attitudes have on
the type of shows presented),
which might well appeal to our
6,000 or so graduate students and
their dependants. There is no
reason to hold ourselves out as the
pop music mecca of the peninsula,
there are alternatives.
As mentioned in the article, 28
name artists have been presented
the past two years. Better than
$20 worth of student discounts
have been offered. You have paid
approximately 20 cents for

quarterly calendars. A public
address system has been made
available for campus groups, a
large number of students have
been employed, loans to assist
groups in raising their own funds
have been made and exposure for
campus and local entertainers has
been provided. Cost to you so far,
$1.50.
Why, you are now likely to
ask, having been swayed by these
paragraphs, does anybody need
$60,000 to carry the program
forward? It would appear that
$20,000 should carry us for
another two years and that an
appeal ought to be made at that
time. The reasons are these.
Deficit promotion is a fools game.
About $29,000 was tied up in the
promotion of Aretha Franklin this
past fall.
Well-Rounded
Should a well rounded program
of two large shows per quarter,
some $1 shows in Dink and some
smaller events in Mem Aud, the
Old Pavillion and Frost be
contemplated at the same time,
the fund would be borrowing
almost immediately against the
funds of the ASSU, your money.
This past fall, the process of
having to place a deposit in
advance for talent, commit money
for stage, lights, ticketing,
promotion, hall, cleanup, security
and sound while trying to collect
(a slow process at best) from
Ticketron left us with no choice
but to cancel Lee Michaels and
the Beach boys for December 3rd.
The first reason for the assessment
is for working capital, not
spending money but working
capital.
We also need a few items of
equipment. We now pay $650 for

a rental stage each time we go into
the pavillion when $1750 would
buy the ASSIJ a stage for use in
the Old and New Pavillion. Had
this been done when the fund
began, it would have already paid
for itself and that cost would have
been saved in the future. Lighting
equipment purchased now could
also result in similar overhead
reductions.
Benefits
Finally, encouraging students
to come with lower prices may
have many benefits. First, if more
students attend, promotional
expenses are reduced (radio
advertising is the largest expense).
Second, a higher percentage of
students will reduce security
problems (Stanford students are
not normally the window breakers
and gate crashers that un-nerve
the athletic department and swell
the payroll of the student police
and the Santa Clara Sheriffs).
Third, attendance by students
serves to establish by presence the
desire on their part to have
entertainment events making hall
procurement procedures with
university officials more
straightforward (their uneasiness
is understandable considering that
their facilities are being sacrificed
with no return benefit for
students) and consequently, less
expensive.
I won't be here to live with the
effects of this referendum. I do,
however, hold the opnion that we
are providing and should continue
to provide a positive service for
the student body. Join us for Van
Morrison, April 22nd at the Old
Pavillion.
