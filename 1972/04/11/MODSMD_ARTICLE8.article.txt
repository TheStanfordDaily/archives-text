Editor, THE DAILY:
I want to urge students to
approve the proposed Citizens
Advocates at Stanford, Inc.
The small personal assessment
involved may well be the most
effective means any citizen has to
effect change in a system of
government which desperately
requires change.
At a time when both the
Administration and Congress put
political benefit ahead of
progressive reform, the Courts are
quite often the most effective
instruments to acquire such
reform.
Today young lawyers all over
the United States are on the
attack — challenging the denial of
due process to farm workers and
minorities — challenging arrogance
and insensitivity in both
government and corporate power
structures — effecting change
through legal action.
At least four major inequities
in our system of government have
been remedied in recent years, not
through the courage of elected
officials, but through
dispassionate judgments in legal
proceedings.
In cases involving school
segregation (Brown v. Board of
Education , 1954),
malapportionment (Baker v. Carr,
1962), environmental concern
{Scenic Hudson Preservation
Conference v. FPC, 1965), court
judgments led the way for
significant legislative action some
years later.
Perhaps the most historic
judicial decision yet may be the
recent California Supreme Court
decision (Serrano v. Priest, 1971)
requiring property tax reform in
order to give equal protection of
the laws to school children in low
income areas. It would have been
years before Congress or any state

legislature would have had the
courage to challenge this problem.
Public interest firms are
currently the most effective
groups pressing for these types of
reforms. The resources of the
Stanford community should make
Citizens Advocates a uniquely
effective public interest firm. It
deserves your support.

Your February 28th issue,
contained an article, submitted by
11 Stanford Law students
soliciting student support for a

solicitation was based on
inaccuracies which should be set
straight.
Dealing with "consumer

article refers to an alleged "recent
California Supreme Court decision
invalidating a rate increase for
Pacific Telephone on grounds that
the company misrepresented the
facts."
That charge is false. The
Supreme Court has not
invalidated a rate increase.
The Supreme Court decision
on an interim order of the Public
Utilities Commission was based on
their interpretation of a new
Internal Revenue Code provision,

Myth
Editor, THE DAILY:
The myth that George
McGovern cannot win the
Democratic nomination for the
presidency was buried in
Wisconsin. It remains for
McGovern supporters in crucial
pre-Convention states to build the
type of organization which carried
the McGovern candidacy to
victory in Wisconsin.
This effort is beginning in
California. The block of 271
Convention votes committed to
the winner of the June 6 primary
makes California a key state for
the McGovern campaign. There
are several levels of commitment
to the McGovern candidacy which
supporters may make; the most
basic of these levels is registering
to vote.
To vote for Senator McGovern,
potential supporters must be
registered Democrats. California
law does not allow voters to cross
party-boundaries in the primary
election. Voters must not be
confused by the recent Wisconsin

election; Republican supporters of
Senator McGovern in California
will not be able to vote for him in
the California primary.
As a Democratic stronghold,
the Stanford-Palo Alto area is very
important to Senator McGovern's.

difference of one or two votes per,
precinct can be absolutely crucial
to the success of the campaign.
McGovern supporters need
Oiiiy look back to McGovern's
original election to the Senate in
1962. Of the quarter-million votes
cast, McGovern won by 504 votes.
The idea that the vote of any
individual is not important in the
face of the massive number of
voters in California is false.
McGovern supporters must*

the Senator, and to the real
possibility for change which he

Editor, THE DAILY:
Next year we will build a new
on-campus cooperative —•
"Synegry House" — people living
and working together to explore
alternative workstyles and ways of
living for themselves and others.
This spring we want to come
together around the work of
laying the foundation of the
house.
Many of us will be involved
with on-campus organizations like
the Bridge, and with people
outside Stanford engaged in
alternatives like free schools, the
Redwood City free clinic, law
collectives, groups working for
cultural freedom.
We hope to have a
guest-in-residence program to
bring in outside people who will
stay with us a while and lead open
rap sessions. We will be in touch
with activities of other groups in
the area, help serve as liaison with
Stanford, and maintain close
relationship with "Synergy," an
alternatives center soon to be
opened in the Old Clubhouse.
Our cooperative will be in the
old Beta Chi house. In the draw,
priority will be given to people
who have had important (to
them) experience with
alternatives, and to those who
want to commit themselves to
create "Synergy House." We plan
an open house this week for
people who want to find out
about joining us, or who just want
to help. The open house will be at
the Clubhouse Center, second

Next year we will build a new

"Synegry House" — people living
and working together to explore
alternative workstyles and ways of
living for themselves and others.
This spring we want to come
together around the work of
laying the foundation of the
house.
Many of us will be involved
with on-campus organizations like
the Bridge, and with people
outside Stanford engaged in
alternatives like free schools, the
Redwood City free clinic, law
collectives, groups working for
cultural freedom.
We hope to have a
guest-in-residence program to
bring in outside people who will
stay with us a while and lead open

with activities of other groups in
the area, help serve as liaison with
Stanford, and maintain close
relationship with "Synergy," an
alternatives center soon to be
opened in the Old Clubhouse.
Our cooperative will be in the
old Beta Chi house. In the draw,
priority will be given to people
who have had important (to
them) experience with
alternatives, and to those who
want to commit themselves to

Editor, THE DAILY:
Next year we will build a new
on-campus cooperative —•
"Synegry House" — people living
and working together to explore
alternative workstyles and ways of
living for themselves and others.
This spring we want to come
together around the work of
laying the foundation of the
house.
Many of us will be involved
with on-campus organizations like
the Bridge, and with people
outside Stanford engaged in
alternatives like free schools, the
Redwood City free clinic, law
collectives, groups working for
cultural freedom.
We hope to have a
guest-in-residence program to
bring in outside people who will
stay with us a while and lead open
rap sessions. We will be in touch
with activities of other groups in
the area, help serve as liaison with
Stanford, and maintain close
relationship with "Synergy," an
alternatives center soon to be
opened in the Old Clubhouse.
Our cooperative will be in the
old Beta Chi house. In the draw,
priority will be given to people
who have had important (to
them) experience with
alternatives, and to those who
want to commit themselves to
create "Synergy House." We plan
an open house this week for
people who want to find out
about joining us, or who just want
to help. The open house will be at
the Clubhouse Center, second
floor, on April 12, 7:30 p.m.

Change
Editor, THE DAILY:
I want to urge students to
approve the proposed Citizens
Advocates at Stanford, Inc.
The small personal assessment
involved may well be the most
effective means any citizen has to
effect change in a system of
government which desperately
requires change.
At a time when both the
Administration and Congress put
political benefit ahead of
progressive reform, the Courts are
quite often the most effective
instruments to acquire such
reform.
Today young lawyers all over
the United States are on the
attack — challenging the denial of
due process to farm workers and
minorities — challenging arrogance
and insensitivity in both
government and corporate power
structures — effecting change
through legal action.
At least four major inequities
in our system of government have
been remedied in recent years, not
through the courage of elected
officials, but through
dispassionate judgments in legal
proceedings.
In cases involving school
segregation (Brown v. Board of
Education , 1954),
malapportionment (Baker v. Carr,
1962), environmental concern
{Scenic Hudson Preservation
Conference v. FPC, 1965), court
judgments led the way for
significant legislative action some
years later.
Perhaps the most historic
judicial decision yet may be the
recent California Supreme Court
decision (Serrano v. Priest, 1971)
requiring property tax reform in
order to give equal protection of
the laws to school children in low
income areas. It would have been
years before Congress or any state

legislature would have had the
courage to challenge this problem.
Public interest firms are
currently the most effective
groups pressing for these types of
reforms. The resources of the
Stanford community should make
Citizens Advocates a uniquely
effective public interest firm. It
deserves your support.

Accuracy
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your February 28th issue,
contained an article, submitted by
11 Stanford Law students
soliciting student support for a
public interest law firms, Citizens
Advocates at Stanford, Inc. That
solicitation was based on
inaccuracies which should be set
straight.
Dealing with "consumer
protection", a portion of the
article refers to an alleged "recent
California Supreme Court decision
invalidating a rate increase for
Pacific Telephone on grounds that
the company misrepresented the
facts."
That charge is false. The
Supreme Court has not
invalidated a rate increase.
The Supreme Court decision
on an interim order of the Public
Utilities Commission was based on
their interpretation of a new
Internal Revenue Code provision,
not on • the grounds of
misrepresentation by the
company.
Citizens Advocates, if it
intends to protect the consumer
interest, would do itself and the
public a greater service by
showing more concern for
accuracy.

The myth that George

California. The block of 271
Convention votes committed to
the winner of the June 6 primary
makes California a key state for
the McGovern campaign. There
are several levels of commitment
to the McGovern candidacy which
supporters may make; the most
basic of these levels is registering
to vote.
