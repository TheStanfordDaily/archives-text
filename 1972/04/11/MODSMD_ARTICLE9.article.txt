ACS Award
To MeConnell
Stanford chemist Harden M.
McConnell received the $5,000
Irving Langmuir Award in
Chemical Physics for 1972 at the
163 rd national meeting of the
American Chemical Society (ACS)
in Boston yesterday.
The award was established by
the ACS under General Electric
Foundation sponsorship to
encourage combined research in
chemistry and physics which was
exemplified by the work of the
famed GE scientist Langmuir.
Those receiving the award "must
have made an outstanding
contribution to chemical physics
or physical chemistry" during the
preceding 10 years.
Professor McConnell is
regarded as one of the world's
leading scientists in the rarely
combined fields of physics and
physical chemistry. He specializes
in studies of the electronic
structure of molecules, their
distribution and interactions.
Medal Conferred
The Optical Society of America
will confer one of its highest
awards, the Adolph Lomb Medal,
upon a young Stanford scientist,
Prof. Robert L. Byer of the
Applied Physics Department.
The presentation will take
place Wednesday evening, April
12, at a banquet during the
society's annual meeting at the
Statler Hilton Hotel in New York
City. Dr. Edwin H. Land, inventor
of the Polaroid camera, also will
be honored during the banquet,
and Prof. William Fastie of Johns
Hopkins University will receive
the society's Richardson Medal.
The Lomb Medal was
established in 1934 in honor of a
founder of the society. It is
awarded every two years to a
scientist under 30 who has made a
"noteworthy contribution to
optics."
Byer's current research is
aimed at using "tunable" laser
light to measure air pollution. He
and a Stanford graduate student,
Helge Kildal of Norway, are
presenting a research paper on the
subject at the society's regular
meeting.
Byer's investigations have been
primarily concerned with
"nonlinear optics" and included
building the first "visible
continuous-wave parametric
oscillator," or tunable laser, which
can produce coherent laser light at
various wavelengths. He also
helped develop the lithium
niobate crystals which make the
device work.
The 29-year-old Stanford
scientist earned the master's and
Ph.D. degrees at Stanford after

graduating from UC-Berkeley. He
is the author or co-author of
numerous scientific articles.
Pauling Award
Stanford chemistry Prof. Linus
Pauling will be a recipient of the
first Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Medical Achievement Award in
Philadelphia Tuesday evening for
his pioneering work in
determining the cause of sickle
cell anemia, a disease that afflicts
mainly blacks and some so-called
Mediterranean people.
He will be one of 25 scientists
from the U.S. and foreign
countries to be honored by the
Philadelphia Chapter of the
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference at a $100-a-plate
awards banquet in Philadelphia's
Convention Hall.
Boxing champion Muhammad
Ali and Pennsylvania Gov. Milton
J. Shapp will be co-chairmen of
the event. Philadelphia Mayor
Frank L. Rizzo and the Rev. Dr.
Ralph Albernathy will attend as
honorary chairmen.
Corretta King, wife of the late
Martin Luther King, Jr., will be
among the guests of honor. Other
notables scheduled to attend
include Bill Cosby, Count Basie,
Aretha Franklin, and Willie
Stargell.
The award will consist of an
engraved bronze statue and a
citation commending the recipient
"for outstanding achievement in
research in sickle cell anemia."
Mayor Rizzo is expected to
proclaim April "Sickle Cell
Anemia Month" in Philadelphia.
Dr. Pauling, twice winner of
the Nobel Prize for chemistry and
for peace, correctly theorized in
1945 that a hemoglobin mutation
might be responsible for the
disease. Dr. Harvey Itano of
UC-San Diego, a co-author of
Pauling's 1949 paper on "Sickle
Cell Anemia, A Molecular
Disease" that presented proof of
this theory, also will be honored
at the awards banquet.
The Pauling research group
showed that sickle cell anemia
involves gene control of the
manufacture of a different form
of hemoglobin molecule than that
produced by other human beings.
It was the first human disorder to
be identified as a "molecular
disease," a term used for the first
time in the 1949 article.
The hemoglobin molecule,
which gives blood its red color is
the principal means of oxygen
transport through the human
vascular system. The detective
molecules can form crystals that
block circulation and may cause
extreme pain, damage to blood
vessels, heart attacks and death.
Many avenues are being
exploited in the search for a cure.

Some show promise, but the final
solution may have to await future
developments in genetic
engineering to correct the
structure of the defective
molecule.
Meantime a recent statement
by Pauling sounds a new note of
hope:
"Most methods of theraphy
have been empirical in origin," he
said. "We might consider that
medicine is now entering a new
stage in which ihe detailed
molecular understanding of the
nature of diseases will be used
effectively in the search for
therapeutic methods."
