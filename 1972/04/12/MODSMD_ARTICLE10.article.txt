## The 						American And Vietnamese Elites 
### 
concerned asian scholars

The year 1945 was marked by
a watershed in the history of
Vietnam, for it was then that
there was manifested an implicit
decision of the great majority of
Vietnamese people not to abide
the reimposition of French
colonial rule, or the social order
that had prevailed under that rule.
The Vietnamese's relative docility
had given way to expectancy and
eager anticipation of
revolutionary change.
Immediately following the
Japanese collapse the
Communist-led Viet Minh stepped
boldly forward to proclaim an
independent Vietnam, and when
by a mixture of popular social
policies, as well as military and
organizational competence,
secured the loyalty of much of
the Vietnamese peasantry and
lower classes.
The French failed to
comprehend the change in
political consciousness of the
Vietnamese, and undertook to
reestablish their rule in Vietnam,
partly by force, partly by working
through a co-opted upper class of
officials, landlords, military
officers, professionals,
businessmen, and others, thereby
effectively guaranteeing the
imposition of reactionary social
policies which maintained not
only upper class wealth and
privilege but also the continued
poverty, oppression,
backwardness, and degradation of
the peasantry.
Unacceptable
These policies were violently
unacceptable to the Viet Minh-led
peasants, who, joined by
anti-colonial nationalists, using
the now-familiar means of
'people's war', brought the French
to military defeat in northern
Vietnam by 1954.
In the years following the 1954
Geneva settlement the United
States acted to secure the
independent, anti-communist
status of the newly-created
political entity of South Vietnam,
although at first only by working
through the upper class
Vietnamese who had previously
cooperated with the French. This
elite group, which, backed by
American money and warplanes,
still holds power in the Republic
of (South) Vietnam, consistently
acted with almost single-minded
determination to preserve its
superordinate position of power
and wealth, even, it seems, at the
not-so-long term risk of its own
neck.
During the years 1954-59,
which were largely free of guerilla
activity, the regime under
President Ngo Dinh Diem devoted
much of its energy to programs
for consolidating its power over
the rural areas, among other
things by re-establishing landlords
in areas that had long been under
Viet Minh control, and by
replacing elected local officials by
others who were Saigon-appointed
and directed, and were often
oppressive and corrupt.

The Diem regime's efforts in
the crucial issues of land reform
and social mobility were grudging,
wholly inadequate, and often
regressive and counterproductive.
When the North Vietnamese
sponsored the renewal of guerrilla
warfare in 1959, the response of
Diem and his class was not to
undertake drastic reforms.
Unwilling or unable to
understand the explosive social
unrest that their policies had
engendered, Diem and his
governing elite, much as the less
witting French before him and
Americans after, strove to
perpetuate the existing social
order by reporting to military
force, to coercion and terror, on
an increasingly large scale. J. Race
qutoes a Vietnamese on the
attitude of the people: "You want
to know how the communists got
into our strategic hamlet? All of
us in the Combat Youth were
poor people. We asked ourselves,
why should we be carrying rifles
and risking our lives when Koai's
son doesn't have to? His family is
rich and has used its power to get
him out of it. When the
communists come in, they never
bother us â€” they go to the homes
of those who got rich by taking
from others. Are we so stupid as
to protect them?" Mr. Race
himself adds: "What was true of
this hamlet was just as true of the
social system as a whole."
Deteriorated
By 1959 the peasant's attitudes
had so far deteriorated that the
Diem regime's attempt to repress
the insurgency by force instead
exacerbated the peasants hatred
of, and resistance to, the
government. Diem's use of ever
greater applications of force,
financed and augmented by
American aid and 'advisors', led to
disastrous results.
In early 1965 the South
Vietnamese regime was near
collapse. The United States
Government decided, in its turn,
that inadequate force had been

applied to the task and elected,
beginning in 1965, to undertake a
gigantic violence program of its
own: invasion of the South
Vietnamese countryside by
American troops, and massive use
of aerial warfare against both
halves of Vietnam and Laos.
The application of force on
such a scale has tended to
submerge the social attitudes and
inequalities that lie at the roots of
the war. The profligate and
indiscriminate use of American
ground forces and air power in
1965-69 held the anti-government
forces to a temporary stalemate,
although at great cost to both
sides and to the bystanders.
Domestic political pressures in
the U.S. have constrained the
Nixon administration to disengage
American ground combat forces
and to hold forth the hope of the
war's ending altogether. At the
same time, however, the U.S. has
chosen to make extensive use of
aerial-technological warfare, a still
more remote and impersonal form
of violence, and has spared no
effort to maintain in power in
South Vietnam the same
priviledged elite whose tyrannical
rule and near-total unwillingness
to reform has persisted to this
day.
Annihilating
Moreover, the U.S. has devoted
considerable effort toward solving
the Indochina problem by
annihilating the peasant socities in
which the communist insurgency
has been nurtured.
Samuel P. Huntington has
rationalized this undertaking as
follows: "In an absent-minded
way the United States in Viet
Nam may well have stumbled
upon the answer to "wars of
national liberation". The effective
response lies neither in the quest
for conventional military victory
nor in the esoteric doctrines and
gimmicks of counter-insurgency
warfare. It is instead in
forced-draft urbanization and
modernization which rapidly
brings the country in question out

of the phase in which a rural
revolutionary movement can hope
to generate sufficient strength to
come to power."
In recent practice this
urbanization has been brought
about by extraordinarily ruthless
means in Indochina, particularly
in Laos, that is by bombing,
shelling or napalming villages in
presently or potentially
enemy-held areas in order to
constrain large numbers of
surviving peasants to forsake their
land for city slums or suburban
refugee camps.
Failures
It is highly probable that these
applications of force will also fail
for the same reasons as the earlier
programs, for under the present
social system the slum-dwellers
and other refugees are no more
likely to become modernized and
prosperous government supporters
than they were as poor peasants,
and it is from these ill-treated
subordinate classes that the
soldiers and defenders of South
Vietnam's present regime must be
conscripted.
There are, then compelling
reasons to disbelieve the American
government's contention that
further Vietnamization of the
ground and air wars, after the
present North Vietnamese
offensive is contained, will permit
the U.S. to wind down its military
involvement to nearly zero.
American influence in Vietnam is
now rigidly welded to the
fortunes of the present South
Vietnamese elite, whose hold on
power depends on the indefinitely
continued appliqation of an
irreducibly large amount of
American airpower and aid.
The U.S. government's
unwillingness to relinquish its
control over the fate of South
Vietnam therefore entails a U.S.
commitment to maintain the
present social system, with all its
weaknesses and instability, by the
continued use of military force.
