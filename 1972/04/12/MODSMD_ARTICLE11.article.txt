Michael Fancher's column in
Monday's Daily entitled "No
Compulsory Assessments" is
fraught with errors with regard to
the upcoming ASSU special
assessment concerning KZSU.
Errors which need to be cleared
up. Mr. Fancher states "the
station management has
accounted for only $15,000 of
the $36,000 they hope for. The

rest is gravy. . This statement is
patently false and I don't know
where Mr. Fanchergot his figures.
$18,500 of this assessment
money will be used by KZSU to
buy a new transmitter and the
other supporting equipment
necessary for KZSU to go to high
power and broadcast in stereo. If
the assessment is voted in KZSU
will be broadcasting in highter
power no later than December of
1972, and broadcasting from one
studio in stereo by Spring Quarter
of next year. This timetable bars
no unforseen occurrences.
$11,500 of this assessment
money will be used by KZSU to
continue the present level of
support given by the students.
This money is used by the various
departments within the station to
pay for operational, maintenance,
and capital expenditures.
$3,400 of this assessment
money will be used by KZSU to
replace revenues which will not be
available to KZSU next year.

$500 of this assessment money
will be used by KZSU to raise the
level of service provided by our
News Department. If you would
like to see a more detailed
breakdown of what this money
will be used for please feel free to

In recent discussions in the
press at Stanford of the
Teamsters' union, the role that
the Teamsters have played in the
building and sustaining of a fascist
political economy in the United
States has not been focused on.
But the Teamsters' union has
been a willing accomplice in the
Nixon administration's policies,
which include the setting of wage
rates by edict from Washington
and threatened and actual
compulsory arbitration. This fact
should not be allowed to pass by
without comment.
Only the Teamsters' union, out
of all organized labor, remains on
the Pay Board, permitting the
board to retain its tripartite
composition. It is decision-making
bodies like the Pay Board with
representatives of big business, big
labor, and big government that
help to give the American
economy its remarkable likeness
to Mussolini's model for Italy.
As long as we have
representatives of the Teamsters
on campus, let's ask them why
their union is co-operating with,
economic fascism.

In recent discussions in the
press at Stanford of the
Teamsters' union, the role that
the Teamsters have played in the
building and sustaining of a fascist
political economy in the United
States has not been focused on.
But the Teamsters' union has
been a willing accomplice in the
Nixon administration's policies,
which include the setting of wage
rates by edict from Washington
and threatened and actual
compulsory arbitration. This fact
should not be allowed to pass by
without comment.
Only the Teamsters' union, out
of all organized labor, remains on
the Pay Board, permitting the
board to retain its tripartite
composition. It is decision-making
bodies like the Pay Board with
representatives of big business, big
labor, and big government that
help to give the American
economy its remarkable likeness
to Mussolini's model for Italy.
As long as we have
representatives of the Teamsters
on campus, let's ask them why
their union is co-operating with,
economic fascism.

Michael Fancher's column in
Monday's Daily entitled "No
Compulsory Assessments" is
fraught with errors with regard to
the upcoming ASSU special
assessment concerning KZSU.
Errors which need to be cleared
up. Mr. Fancher states "the
station management has
accounted for only $15,000 of
the $36,000 they hope for. The

rest is gravy. . This statement is
patently false and I don't know
where Mr. Fanchergot his figures.
$18,500 of this assessment
money will be used by KZSU to
buy a new transmitter and the
other supporting equipment
necessary for KZSU to go to high
power and broadcast in stereo. If
the assessment is voted in KZSU
will be broadcasting in highter
power no later than December of
1972, and broadcasting from one
studio in stereo by Spring Quarter
of next year. This timetable bars
no unforseen occurrences.
$11,500 of this assessment
money will be used by KZSU to
continue the present level of
support given by the students.
This money is used by the various
departments within the station to
pay for operational, maintenance,
and capital expenditures.
$3,400 of this assessment
money will be used by KZSU to
replace revenues which will not be
available to KZSU next year.

$500 of this assessment money
will be used by KZSU to raise the
level of service provided by our
