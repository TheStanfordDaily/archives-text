# Classical Guitarist Thrills Audience
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
The guitar's potential for
evocative delicacy, charm, and
sheer civilization was given a
thorough display by Michael
Lorimer in Dinkelspiel Friday
night. It is no small task to make
an evening of guitar music hold up
without lapsing into dry pedantry
on one hand or a kind of
five-string muzak on the other.
After all, the guitar is in some
respects a severely limited
instrument — most of those
limitations being of the kind all
plucked instruments fall heir to.
The full gamut of human
emotions is simply not open to it.
But the guitar (along with the
lute) is still to me the most
evocative instrument there is, and
Lorimer's performance was made
consistently pleasurable and
engaging simply through his
power to conjure up the many
different worlds represented on
his program.
It took little effort, as each
selection required, to imagine a
scene to complete the musical
picture: something dreamy and
effete a la Poussin or Watteau for
the Dowland "Fantasies", a salon
at the Nymphenburg or Esterhazy
Palace for the Bach suite, or a
warm jasmine-scented evening in a
Spanish garden for the Albeniz
pieces.
Lorimer's easy-going stage
presence and the artless ease with
which he attacked some
extraordinarily difficult pieces
were not enough, however, to
hide his considerable technical
powers (especially for one only 25
years old) and his rigid avoidance
of all potential traps for vulgarity
or over-indulgence. In short,
Lorimer's mastery allowed the
audience to relax almost
immediately and appreciate the
guitar for what it is, the supreme
instrument of elegant, thoughtful
repose. I cannot recall having left
a recital feeling more at ease.
The recital opened pleasantly
(though ill-advisedly I would say)
with two funereal little tombeaux
and passed to a Ponce
arrangement of a theme and
variations by Paganini which
established Lorimer's huge
technical dimensions, if not much
else.

The audience (happily a nearly
full house) responded most
enthusiastically to nearly every
section of the Bach Suite in D
Major (written originally for what
is now the cello). This charming
suite runs the gamut of
Renaissance dance forms —
allemande, courante, sarabande,
gavotte and gigue — and certainly
invites transcription for the guitar,
as Lorimer suggests in his program
notes — especially when played
with Lorimer's light touch and
rhythmic sophistication.
His playing even suggested to
me that no instrument can give
such finesse and clarity to
baroque ornamentation as the
guitar.
A segment featuring a
newly-made lute was highlighted
by three works — two fantasies
and the famous "Lachrymae" —
by John Dowland (1562-1626).
Dowland is doubtless the greatest
English Internist, and his pieces
combine an enervating calm with
just the slightest melancholy into
lovely arabesques that are
irresistible.
After intermission followed a
quartet of brilliantly colored
numbers from the guitar's native
land by Isaac Albeniz
(1860-1909). Lorimer's approach
to these avoided the stilted or
garish and the result was thrilling,
especially in "Asturias" (known
for piano as "Leyenda") and
"Sevilla."
Three encores — a Spanish
piece of surpassing beauty, a Bach
prelude, and a Bach Fugue—closed
the program. I could only have
wished for some representative
20th century' music (two homages
to Segovia by Milhaud and
Roussel announced in the
program were not played) to give
a complete accounting of
Lorimer's capabilities.
Segovia will some day have to
relinquish the recital circuit, and I
should not be surprised to see
Lorimer (a long-time Segovia
student) take his master's place
some day. At any rate, Lorimer's
recital suggests that there is
perhaps a future for
non-electronic, non-ear-crunching
guitar music after all.

piece of surpassing beauty, a Bach
prelude, and a Bach Fugue—closed
the program. I could only have
wished for some representative
20th century' music (two homages
to Segovia by Milhaud and
Roussel announced in the
program were not played) to give
a complete accounting of
Lorimer's capabilities.
Segovia will some day have to
relinquish the recital circuit, and I
should not be surprised to see
Lorimer (a long-time Segovia
student) take his master's place
some day. At any rate, Lorimer's
recital suggests that there is
perhaps a future for
non-electronic, non-ear-crunching
guitar music after all.
The guitar's potential for
evocative delicacy, charm, and
sheer civilization was given a
thorough display by Michael
Lorimer in Dinkelspiel Friday
night. It is no small task to make
an evening of guitar music hold up
without lapsing into dry pedantry
on one hand or a kind of
five-string muzak on the other.
After all, the guitar is in some
respects a severely limited
instrument — most of those
limitations being of the kind all
plucked instruments fall heir to.
The full gamut of human
emotions is simply not open to it.
But the guitar (along with the
lute) is still to me the most
evocative instrument there is, and
Lorimer's performance was made
consistently pleasurable and
engaging simply through his
power to conjure up the many
different worlds represented on
his program.
It took little effort, as each
selection required, to imagine a
scene to complete the musical
picture: something dreamy and
effete a la Poussin or Watteau for
the Dowland "Fantasies", a salon
at the Nymphenburg or Esterhazy
Palace for the Bach suite, or a
warm jasmine-scented evening in a
Spanish garden for the Albeniz
pieces.
Lorimer's easy-going stage
presence and the artless ease with
which he attacked some
extraordinarily difficult pieces
were not enough, however, to
hide his considerable technical
powers (especially for one only 25
years old) and his rigid avoidance
of all potential traps for vulgarity
or over-indulgence. In short,
Lorimer's mastery allowed the
audience to relax almost
immediately and appreciate the
guitar for what it is, the supreme
instrument of elegant, thoughtful
repose. I cannot recall having left
a recital feeling more at ease.
The recital opened pleasantly
(though ill-advisedly I would say)
with two funereal little tombeaux
and passed to a Ponce
arrangement of a theme and
variations by Paganini which
established Lorimer's huge
technical dimensions, if not much
else.

The audience (happily a nearly
full house) responded most
enthusiastically to nearly every
section of the Bach Suite in D
Major (written originally for what
is now the cello). This charming
suite runs the gamut of
Renaissance dance forms —
allemande, courante, sarabande,
gavotte and gigue — and certainly
invites transcription for the guitar,
as Lorimer suggests in his program
notes — especially when played
with Lorimer's light touch and
rhythmic sophistication.
His playing even suggested to
me that no instrument can give
such finesse and clarity to
baroque ornamentation as the
guitar.
A segment featuring a
newly-made lute was highlighted
by three works — two fantasies
and the famous "Lachrymae" —
by John Dowland (1562-1626).
Dowland is doubtless the greatest
English Internist, and his pieces
combine an enervating calm with
just the slightest melancholy into
lovely arabesques that are
irresistible.
After intermission followed a
quartet of brilliantly colored
numbers from the guitar's native
land by Isaac Albeniz
(1860-1909). Lorimer's approach
to these avoided the stilted or
garish and the result was thrilling,
especially in "Asturias" (known
for piano as "Leyenda") and
"Sevilla."
Three encores — a Spanish
piece of surpassing beauty, a Bach
prelude, and a Bach Fugue—closed
the program. I could only have

to Segovia by Milhaud and
