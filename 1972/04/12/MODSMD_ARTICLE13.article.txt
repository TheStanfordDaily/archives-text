# 'Pan' Flies Again

### STU ALLEN 
Peter Pan is a completely successful rock musical now at Lane
Mountain College in the City. The old tale, written by Sir James M.
Barrie and made famous to our generation by Mary Martin, is now a
series of dances, done to the accompaniment of an on stage rock
band.
The actor-dancers bring to the stage an enthusiasm and a delight
that they succeed in imparting to the audience during the course of
the show. Even those who feel uncomfortable with fantasy cannot
escape the happiness communicated so effectively by the cast.
One leaves the theater with a warm smile spread across one's face.
This effect is accomplished by the cast pulling the audience along on
the trip on which Peter Pan and Tinker Bell take the three Darling
children to Never Never Land.
The stage is deep and narrow; at the top of it sits an excellent rock
band, led by Mark Eliot. They play and sing, as the cast dances in
front of them. It is a dream-like experience for the audience, as the
cast, which has no spoken lines, communicates only with movements
and with facial gestures.
Running through the same routines five times each week, the
dancing could easily lose the freshness exhibited last Friday night and
become rather mechanical. That is the danger of the format chosen by
the director, John Pasqualetti.
More than anything else, it is the magical eyes of Peter Pan, Tinker
Bell, and Wendy that seize the audience's attention and make each
dance a new experience, a moment shared by the dancers and the
audience together.
In short, this show is theater at its best. If fantasy needs any
justification in these days of Vice-Presidential visits and renewed
warfare, surely we would be poorly off if we could not ever revisit the
world we lived in once and in which children will continue to live
after us. The reality of fantasy is a proper and engrossing subject for
the theater.
The performances of John Loschmann as Peter. Deborah Frates as
Tinker Bell, and Judy Ehrlich as Wendy are specially noteworthy.
These three dance to the edge of the stage and look out over the
audience, with smiles reflected in their eyes. After captivating the
audience with this move, they flash back upstage to rejoin the action.
Andrew Woodd plays Captain Hook and Mr. Darling with a deft
sternness that strikes a proper balance between a real personality and
a caricature. Warren Whittington is an engaging dog and crocodile,
who is eager for either attention or a meal.
The costumes, designed by Mary Ann Seymour, are leotards
decorated to distinguish between parents and pirates, fairies and
children. The set and the lighting both contribute to the dreamlike
atmosphere of the theater.
The set consists of blue fabric stretched to make smooth walls and
a ceiling, on which are projected slides to help place the action; and
the lighting is all indirect, behind the screens.
This show is also worth seeing for the music. Although several
songs have motifs obviously borrowed from "Tommy," others are
more original and are verv good, such as "Yesterdays" and "Peter
Pan."
Peter Pan is both unique and excellent. See it in the Wabe at Lone
