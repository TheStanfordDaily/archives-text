# Former Rand Head To Teach At GSB
## 
### 
Henry S. Rowen, 46, outgoing
president of the Rand
Corporation, has been appointed
professor of public management
at the Stanford Graduate School
of Business, effective September
1.
Rowen will direct the School's
new course of study in urban
management and provide
leadership in planned future
developments in public
management. He will teach
courses in decision-making in the
public sector and conduct a
year-long workshop in urban
problems.
Business School Dean Arjay
Miller, who announced the
appointment, said, "I am
delighted that Rowen will be
joining our faculty.

"We arc under way on a new
effort in which we are attempting
to train young people to become
problem solvers in the acutely
complex urban area.
"With his high-level
government experience, his
knowledge of problems in
applying analytical techniques in
the public sector, and his
demonstrated concern and
recognition of the need to apply
more resources to the solution of
urgent social problems, we feel he
is uniquely qualified to provide
leadership in training managers for
nonprofit organizations."
Also praising the appointment
was University Provost William F.
Miller, who said, Rowen "will add
great strength to the urban
management program."
