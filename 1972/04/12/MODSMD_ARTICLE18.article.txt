# Baseball Sidelights
## Cards Stop USC 
### Mike Herman 
As in almost all important series, the weekend games between
Stanford and the University of Southern California were garnished by
a whirlwind of statistics, the recurring visitations of celebrities, and
finally, a host of alibis about why the winner won and the loser lost.
All of which makes a classic matchup such as the Indian-Trojan
showdown all the more enjoyable.
Before the first pitch was thrown for the first game, the latest
rankings for college baseball were announced by the only magazine
that deals with college baseball. Its findings had Stanford University
rated number one, followed in order by Arizona State, Florida State
and Texas. Southern California was ranked eighth, a far cry from the
traditional premier rating the the school usually receives. In Coach
Rod Dedeaux's thirty-year tenure at SC, his teams have won seven
national championships, and have finished first in their league on
twenty-two occasions.
The men from Troy entered the series with a composite batting
average of .300. Six of the eight SC starters were batting over that
magic number: Tim Steele (.396), Jeff Pederson (.341), Fred Lynn
(.319), Sam Ceci (.319), Roy Smally (.306), and Jeff Port (.301).
Against Stanford pitching, however, the potent offense of SC was
stifled, only managing a .156 average. Stanford entered the series with
a .291 batting average, only four percentage points of its all-time
record. For the three-game set, the team managed a total .278 average.
During the series, several familiar faces showed up in the crowd
including major league officials, Trojan sporting stars and rising
sports-writers. A 1 Campanis, vice president of the Dodgers, along with
his scouting aide, Ben Wade, visited the first and third games of the
series. Basketball stars, Ron Riley and Mike Westra, along with
football halfback Sam Cunningham were rabid rooters in the first
game.
Perhaps the best of all the celebrities at the series was the official
score keeper, Jackie Lapin, a 20-year-old sophomore at USC,
who is the assistant sports editor of the Daily Trojan, statistician of
the varsity baseball team and a scholarship-winning straight A student
in her journalism major.
Each game provided its memorable moments. In the first game, the
shutout by Bob DiPietro was the first blanking thrown against
Southern California since Cal State Los Angeles turned the trick in
1969. The Stanford victory broke an eight game SC winning streak,
while DiPietro ran his personal string of scoreless innings up to 28.
Much of the crowd interest in the second day's doubleheader
centered around umpire Emmett Ashford, the American League
umpire who was the first black to break the major league umpiring
color line. While not always agreeing with his decisions, which were, at
best, impartial, the crowd went wild over his acrobatic calls, such as a
double spin turn indicating a close foul ball down the baseline. It
appeared at times that he was more a crowd cheerleader than an
umpire, but he did succeed in putting some interest into two
otherwise dull, if brilliant, pitching duels.
Both teams were hit by injuries, Stanford's admittedly more severe.
Before the team left for Los Angeles, rightfielder Mike Nelson
"popped his knee" getting up after hitting the dirt during a practice.
His position was very adequately filled by Glen Johnson during the
entire series. Dan Shaw, regarded by many as the ace pitcher of the
staff, had just a sore enough arm to warrant his resting during the
series, though the decision not to use him was only made minutes
before the beginning of the double header nightcap.
Finally, the continuing controversy of the Stanford nickname was
very much in evidence during the three-game set. The public address
announcer alternated between "Indians" and "Cardinals", while
KUSC, the campus FK station, merely referred to the Farm as the
"what-you-ma-call-its".
