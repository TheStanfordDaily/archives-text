# A 						Year Ago Today

### 
Today is Wednesday, April 12, 1972, and one year ago today, the Daily
made the news as well as published it.
At 5:45 p.m., after most staff members had left the newspaper's offices
for dinner, six uniformed visitors arrived at the Storke Student
Publications Building with a historic piece of paper-a search warrant.
For 45 minutes, four Palo Alto policemen, accompanied by two
members of the Stanford Department of Public Safety, scoured the office
looking for pictures. They searched desks, file cabinets, waste baskets, and
photograph files looking for photos and negatives taken by Daily
photographers that might show a felony had been committed by
participants in the violent Stanford hospital sit-in of three days before.
The search warrant, issued by a Municipal Court judge in Palo Alto, and
its use marked the first time in United States history that a newspaper and
the confidential files of its offices had been searched by law enforcement
agents.
After studying photo contact sheets of previous demonstrations and
examining the contents of editors' desks, the police gave up their search
and left empty-handed.
With the aid of Law School Professor Anthony G. Amsterdam, San
Francisco attorneys Jerome B. Falk and Robert H. Mnookin, and the
moral and financial support of outside journalistic organizations, the Daily
filed suit in federal district court against the searching officers, Chief of
Police James Zurcher, County District Attorney Louis Bergna and his
deputy Craig Brown, and the Palo Alto Municipal Judge J. Barton Phelps.
Constant delays in the proceedings have dragged the suit out, but Daily
lawyers hope a final stipulation of fact can be agreed upon, and a court
hearing in order to request summary judgement can be held before the end
of the quarter.
