# Hug Stars At NCAA
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
Three members of the Stanford Gymastics team
traveled to the NCAA Gymnastics Championships at
lowa State last weekend.
Sophomore, Steve Hug, won the Ail-Around
title with a score of 107.75, an average of 9.0 a
routine. Harold Besson, also a sophomore, placed
sixth in the rings, while frosh Bob Anderson
finished 11th in floor exercise. Both Hug and
Besson received AIl-American honors for placing in
the top six at the championships.
Hug, who had a two year layoff due to a back
injury, showed he has regained the form that
enabled him to make the 1968 Olympic team. Hug's
win waj quiie convincing as the second place
finisher. Gary Morave of Southern Illinois, scored
105.80. A two point win in gymnastics is considered
quite substantial.
For winning the all-around title Hug was selected
to represent the United States at the European
Championships in Russia next week. The best
gymnasts in the world will be competing, including
those from gymnastics powerhouse Japan.
Coach Dan Millman considers Hug a definite
medal possibility at the 1972 Olympic games at
Munich.
Millman states, "Hug is an artist first. — he has
this feeling and drive for creating — he does it well
with a camera and he does it magnificently using his
body as a brush and the air as his canvas."
Millman adds, "Gymnastics is only an external

symptom of Hug's nature. He discovered thah
gymnastics was a thing he could be good at, so he
began doing that."
Millman feels one of Hug's most unique
characteristics is his "apparent contact with
reality." "He has few conflicts, he seems to know
just where he's at and where he's going. Steve is
never half-in-half out of anything. He goes about
things with a single-minded purpose and 112
organization."
While only a junior in high school Hug was on
the receiving end of recruiting drives usually
afforded to only football and basketball players.
It made his next two years less pleasant than
they might have been, because though it was "nice
to feel wanted" and to know he wouldn't have to
worry about money to get through school, there
was always the knowledge that many coaches would
be disappointed because he couldn't go everywhere.
In the end he chose Stanford because of its
liberal policies on education and because he related
to coach Millman.
Hug along with Anderson and Besson will form
the nucleus of a team that will shoot for a NCAA
Championship next year. Only one gymnast will be
lost off this year's squad that just missed representing
the Pacific-Eight at the NCAA's. Millman
confident of landing some of the top high school -
gymnasts in the country for next year to
compliment the excellent talent he will
returning.
