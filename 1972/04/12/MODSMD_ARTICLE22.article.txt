# Room And Board Rate Task Force Report
## 
### 
Summary and Conclusion — A task force of six students
and six staff members has met regularly during winter
quarter and recommends that the basic room and board
rate for 1972-73 be set at $1345, an increase of 3.9%. A
survey of residents conducted by the task force showed
that students are overwhelmingly in favor of some reduc
tion in service in order to keep their room and board
costs down.
Composition & Authority of the Task Force - The task
force is constituted annually as an advisory group to the
Deputy Vice-President for Business and Finance and the
Dean of Students. The task force is charged with recom
mending room and board rates for the following year
and for recommending accompanying changes in opera
tional procedures. Final approval rests with the President
and the Board of Trustees.
Background to Determination of the Rate - Prior to the
meetings of the task force, the tuition for 1972-73 had
been announced. The nine percent increase to $2850
exerted a psychological pressure to keep any increase in
room and board rates as low as possible. Last year's task
force had estimated that a seven percent increase would
be required for 1972-73. However, unusually high occu
pancy during the current year (over 99% thus far) and
operational savings have caused significant improvement
in the financial picture. Consequently, the current task
force estimated that an increase of five percent would
suffice for 1972-73 without any cut in services. This five
percent increase was judged to be necessary to offset
normal inflationary cost increases and higher major re
pair expenses expected in 1972-73.
In the last two years, student/staff task forces had rec
ommended changes resulting in annual cost reductions
totaling $350,000. These included elimination of room
maid service, telephone switchboard, and linen service.
Few major cost-saving steps remained to be considered
by the task force. While upwards of $50,000 might be
saved by eliminating the program for unlimited servings
of food, the task force considered this to be a step
backward, as this program has been one of the most
popular changes in recent years. To obtain a direct
reading of student opinion on other changes, the task
force decided to conduct a survey of residents.
The Survey — A one-page survey was distributed at
dinner in the residence halls on February 28. 2598
surveys were distributed and 60.1% were completed.
Two-thirds favored cutting services to keep the increase
at a minimum, while one-third favored a somewhat
larger increase (to $1360) to maintain current services.
Based upon the survey, the task force made several
preliminary conclusions and published these along with
the survey results in a flyer distributed at dinner on
March 8.
Recommendations — In response to (he concerns ex
pressed by residents in the survey, the task force recom
mends:
I. That the basic room and board rate for 1972-73
be set at $ 1345, an increase of 3.9%.

2. That the residence and food service staffs meet
with residents of Roble and Lagunita Court to
discuss possible changes in food service including
experimentation with cafeteria service using new
improved equipment. The task force strongly be
lieves that a change to cafeteria/buffet service in
Roble and Lagunita Court will result in better
service and will provide cost savings for the entire
system.
3. That brunch be served on Saturdays, instead of
breakfast and lunch, reducing the basic board plan
from 20 to 19 meals per week.
4. That brunch on Saturday and Sunday be served in
only three locations, tentatively designated at Wil
bur, Moore and Lagunita Court. Since only ten
meals are to be served weekly on the Row next
year and in view of the distances involved, we
believe that the Row should be permitted to retain
Sunday brunch in a sufficient number of houses
justified by the attendance. Accompanying this
change, brunch hours should be extended to 2 X A to
3 hours, with some flexibility among the locations.
Also, a more substantial menu, with some lunch
eon type entrees, should be served.
5. That, in order to maintain the financial integrity
of the residence system as a whole, all non-Row
residents be offered only the 14-mealand 19-meal
plans. (Residents of Crothers and Crothers Memor
ial are not required to buy board contracts.) Ex
perience at other colleges and universities has
shown that the offering of additional options such
as 5-day lunch and dinner, has led to severe finan
cial problems and quick return to full-board plans.
We do not think it unreasonable to require 7-day
contracts even though residents of Branner, Stern
and Roble will have to walk a short distance to
obtain certain meals. We do believe that the rela
tive isolation of the Row warrants the requirement
of only a 10-meal contract, since only 10 meals
will be served there.
6. That additional efforts be made by residences and
food service administration to employ students
wherever reasonably possible as job openings occur
for part-time employment.
7. That management cCkrtail or consolidate food ser
vice operations at locations where attendance con
sistently falls below two-thirds of meals contracted
for at those times and locations. For example, if
lunch in a given Row house with an occupancy of
36 consistently attracts less than 24 persons, that
house should be consolidated with a neighboring
house for lunch.
Rate Schedule
1. Quarterly Rates The $1345 basic annual rate
should be broken down into $550 room charges
(up $40 from $510) and board charges.

Daily rates for the 235 operating days in 1972-73
would be $2.34 and $3.38, respectively. Quarterly
rates, based upon the number of days in each
quarter should be: Double room, $192 autumn,
$187 winter, $171 spring, total $550; full board
(19 meals/wk), $277 autumn, $271 winter, $247
spring, total $795; 14 meals/wk (no breakfasts),
$257 autumn, $250 winter, $228 spring, total
$735; 10 meals/wk (5 days; Row only), $222
autumn, $215 winter, $ 199 spring, total $636.
Add $15 per quarter to room charges for single
rooms in Crothers and Crothers Memorial.
2. Manzanita Park — The task force did not make a
study of the Manzanita Park rate. However, in
keeping with the general pattern of residence halls,
it is recommended that the rate there be increased
five percent to reflect cost of living increases. The
new rate for 1972-73 should be $740 per yeaf.
Even at this rate, the Park will operate at a loss of
approximately $60,000 for 1972-73, owing to
high mortgage payments over the expected term of
the project required to pay off the cost of the
trailers. Quarterly rates are: $258 autumn, $252
winter, $230 spring, total $740.
Financial Aid - For the last two years the task force has
recommended several changes in service, making the
service optional and resulting in a direct expense to the
student. Telephone and linen service are examples, add
ing a minimum of $35 and $26, respectively, to the
students' out-of-pocket expense. We recommend that
financial aid packages be increased to take into account
this transfer of expense from a student's room and board
bill to his out-of-pocket living expenses.
Timing — This year's task force met first early in Feb
ruary, not allowing sufficient time for examination of
such other aspects of residence living as the cost and
benefit of counseling programs, student custodial jobs,
and reduction in service personnel. We recommend that
future task forces convene during fall quarter to enhance
the usefulness of their role.
