Senate Debates War Powers
WASHINGTON — The Senate refused yesterday to vote
directly on a move to declare war on North Vietnam or to
make a proposed limitation on presidential war powers
apply to the conflict in Indochina.
The Senate then moved toward passage of the bill
designed to strengthen the hand of Congress in initiating
hostilities, after refusing to sidetrack the measure.
The key vote was the 60-26 decision not to send the
bill to the Judiciary Committee for 45 days for a study of
its constitutionality.
The decision on war declaration on North Vietnam
came on a 78-7 vote tabling a war-declaration amendment
by Sen. Mike Gravel, D-Alaska.
Another Gravel amendment to make the bill applicable
to prevent hostilities unless Congress declares war within
15 days was defeated by a 72-11 roll-call vote.
Pentagon Comments On War
WASHINGTON — Adm. Thomas H. Moorer, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said yesterday the North
Vietnamese thrust into the South has been stabilized by
South Vietnamese forces.
Earlier in the day a Pentagon spokesman said "We face
several more weeks of major engagements" in the North
Vietnamese offensive.
At the same time, Friedheim once again sought to
knock down reports from various places in the United
States suggesting that this country is preparing to
recommit ground troops to Vietnam.
He accused some groups of attempting to sow
confusion.
Meanwhile the U.S. air-naval buildup continued behind
a screen of official silence. #
The White House announced last night that, because of
the latest Indochina crisis, presidential assistant Henry A.
Kissinger is postponing a planned visit to Japan.

Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said Kissinger, who
was to have left for Japan Saturday, will delay his journey
"until probably the first part of May."
Shootout Described At Trial
SAN JOSE - The crack of gunfire filled the tense Angela
Davis trial courtroom yesterday as the prosecutor played a
stark tape recording of the wild shootout two years ago
which took four lives.
The tape, inadvertently taken by a state personnel
consultant, recorded more than a dozen quick, slapping
blasts fired in the Marin County Civic Center on Aug. 7,
1970.
Davis is on trial for murder, kidnapping, and
conspiracy in that incident.
Earlier yesterday, five San Quentin Prison guards
testified that they fired at a van fleeing the scene with
kidnappers and hostages.
U.S. Viet Command Optimistic
SAIGON — Amid widespread reports of new allied
successes including the destruction by U.S. 852 bombers
of a Communist tank batallion, senior U.S. military
officials were reported optimistic yesterday over the
ability of Saigon's soldiers to halt Hanoi's second greatest
offensive.
Reliable sources giving the American military officials'
views said the assessment was based on the carnage
wrought by U.S. air strikes and the ability of South
Vietnamese troops to prevent any meaningful enemy gain
on the ground for the past week.
Such estimates had to be tempered by intelligence that
Hanoi's latest offensive was programed to follow a script
similar to that laid down for the war's biggest Communist
thrust during the Tet holiday season of 1968. That
offensive rolled on in three phases over some seven
months. The current offensive is nearly two weeks old.
