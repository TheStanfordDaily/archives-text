# Disruption Trial Underway
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
The trial of eight persons accused
of disrupting Professor William Shock
ley's quantum mechanics class last
Feb. 3 got underway at Palo Alto's
North County Courthouse yesterday.
The full day was taken up by
examinations of prospective jurors.
Municipal Court Judge Sidney Fein
berg told the panel he expected the
misdemeanor proceedings to last from
two to four weeks.
The eight defendants are John
Hawkes, Barbara Hyland, Enid Hun
keler, Laura King, Elizabeth Elich,
Mary Cummings, Mike Enos, and Jim
Schoch.
All except King are accused of
violating sections 185 (use of a mask
in the commission of a misdemeanor),
415 (disturbing the peace), and 602J
(trespassing with intent to obstruct) of
the California Penal Code. King is
charged only with violating 415 and
602 J.
Deputy Santa Clara County District
Attorney Steve McMorris released a
list of possible prosecution witnesses
which included Electrical Engineering
Professor Ralph Smith, Stanford De
partment of Public Safety photo
graphers Nikita Brunot and Luther
Long, and Shockley.
During the examination of the
jurors, counsel Ronald Romines, who
is defending Hawkes, Elich, and Enos,

offered a few hints as to what his
strategy might be.
At one point, Romines asked a
candidate if he felt that "a newspaper
has the right to go where the action
is." Receiving an affirmative answer,
Romines asked if it made any
difference if the paper was "under
ground," mentioning the radical Penin
sula paper Pamoja Venceremos by
name.

This gave rise to speculation that at
least some of the defendants would
argue that they were at the alleged
disruption not as demonstrators but as
reporters.
Prospective jurors were also ques
tioned by attorney Charles Constan
tinides, representing Hunkeler, King,
Cummings, and Schoch; by Barbara
Hyland, defending herself; and by
prosecutor McMorris.
