# Complex ASSU Ballot Faces Voters
## 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
One of the most complicated
ballots in ASSU history faces students
April 18 and 19, in a primary election
which was postponed earlier this week.
Students will vote on seven presi
dential slates, six fee referenda, three
Constitutional amendments, five can
didates for the Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC), two slates
for Senior Class President and a

Bonfire proposal.
The official ballot lists as candi
dates for ASSU President and Vice
president respectively, James Ander
son and William Chaplin; Rocky
Barber and Chuck Fay; Scott Burke
and Elaine Wong; Chris Hocker and
Robin Friedman; John Kenney and
Barry Porster; Bill Legard and Jeff
Wyden; Rodney Palmer and Rbsy
Wolf; and Dave Rudick and Bruce P.

Douglas.
A recent ASSU by-law amendment
allows persons to write-in candidates
for the offices of ASSU President and
Vice-president. The only requirement
is that write-in candidates must be
registered students in good standing.
Possible Run-Off
If no slate receives a majority of
votes cast, a run-off election will be
held.

There are five candidates for three
student positions on the SCLC. They
arc C. Robert Garcia, "Uncle Bruce"
Kaup, David Pattison, "Zeus" Roesler,
and Kathy Waller.
Only members of the class of '73
are allowed to vote for president,
vice-president, and business manager
positions of the senior class. The
choice is between two slates, Burr
Field, Jane Almas, Randy Barnes, and
Anita Ewing; and Doug Single, Cliff
Nancarrow, Don Mulford, and Rick
Dickinson.
The longest part of the ballot is
composed of six different fee referen
da. Three of the proposed assessments
include for the first time a negative
option clause which says that any
student who desires a refund may do
so for two weeks during fall quarter.
Negative Option
The three fee referenda which
include the negative option clause are
the Afro-American Program which
asks one dollar for fall quarter; the
Daily-Publications Board which is
asking one dollar for fall quarter for
the Pub Board, and one dollar for
