# Complex ASSU Ballot Faces Voters
## 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
One of the most complicated
ballots in ASSU history faces students
April 18 and 19, in a primary election
which was postponed earlier this week.
Students will vote on seven presi
dential slates, six fee referenda, three
Constitutional amendments, five can
didates for the Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC), two slates
for Senior Class President and a

Bonfire proposal.
The official ballot lists as candi
dates for ASSU President and Vice
president respectively, James Ander
son and William Chaplin; Rocky
Barber and Chuck Fay; Scott Burke
and Elaine Wong; Chris Hocker and
Robin Friedman; John Kenney and
Barry Porster; Bill Legard and Jeff
Wyden; Rodney Palmer and Rbsy
Wolf; and Dave Rudick and Bruce P.

Douglas.
A recent ASSU by-law amendment
allows persons to write-in candidates
for the offices of ASSU President and
Vice-president. The only requirement
is that write-in candidates must be
registered students in good standing.
Possible Run-Off
If no slate receives a majority of
votes cast, a run-off election will be
held.

There are five candidates for three
student positions on the SCLC. They
arc C. Robert Garcia, "Uncle Bruce"
Kaup, David Pattison, "Zeus" Roesler,
and Kathy Waller.
Only members of the class of '73
are allowed to vote for president,
vice-president, and business manager
positions of the senior class. The
choice is between two slates, Burr
Field, Jane Almas, Randy Barnes, and
Anita Ewing; and Doug Single, Cliff
Nancarrow, Don Mulford, and Rick
Dickinson.
The longest part of the ballot is
composed of six different fee referen
da. Three of the proposed assessments
include for the first time a negative
option clause which says that any
student who desires a refund may do
so for two weeks during fall quarter.
Negative Option
The three fee referenda which
include the negative option clause are
the Afro-American Program which
asks one dollar for fall quarter; the
Daily-Publications Board which is
asking one dollar for fall quarter for
the Pub Board, and one dollar for
winter, spring, and summer for the
Daily; and the Citizens Advocates
Public Interest Law Project which is
asking for two dollars fall quarter, one
dollar winter, two dollars spring, and
one dollar summer quarter.
The three proposed assessments
without refund clauses are ASSU
Special Events, the ASSU Program
Fee, and KZSU, which are each asking
one dollar for fall, winter, and spring
quarters.
All the proposed fee assessments on
the ballot, except for the Citizens
Advocates proposal, need a simple
majority to pass. Because Citizens
Advocates is asking for money for a
period of three years, it must pass by a
two-thirds majority.
Proposed Amendments
The three proposed Constitutional
Amendments are: (1) an amendment

which would make ASSU Vice
president an ex-officio member of the
student Senate without a vote; (2) an
amendment which would make all
members of a Presidential Council,
other than the President, vice-presi
dents; and the third amendment which
reads, "There shall be from one to
three Vice-presidents. In the event that
the office of president shall become
vacant, they will succeed to the office
of president in the order in which they
were listed on the ballot. Also in the
same order they shall exercise the
powers and duties of the President in
the event of his absence or disability."
The final referendum on the ballot
is a question which reads, "Should
there be a 'Big Game' bonfire this
coming year, as has been held in the
past?" The referendum requires only a
yes or no vote.

asking for two dollars fall quarter, one
dollar winter, two dollars spring, and
one dollar summer quarter.
The three proposed assessments
without refund clauses are ASSU
Special Events, the ASSU Program
Fee, and KZSU, which are each asking
one dollar for fall, winter, and spring
quarters.
All the proposed fee assessments on
the ballot, except for the Citizens
Advocates proposal, need a simple
majority to pass. Because Citizens
Advocates is asking for money for a
period of three years, it must pass by a
two-thirds majority.
Proposed Amendments
The three proposed Constitutional
Amendments are: (1) an amendment

which would make ASSU Vice
president an ex-officio member of the
student Senate without a vote; (2) an
amendment which would make all
members of a Presidential Council,
other than the President, vice-presi
dents; and the third amendment which
reads, "There shall be from one to
three Vice-presidents. In the event that
the office of president shall become
vacant, they will succeed to the office
of president in the order in which they
were listed on the ballot. Also in the
same order they shall exercise the
powers and duties of the President in
the event of his absence or disability."
The final referendum on the ballot
is a question which reads, "Should
there be a 'Big Game' bonfire this
coming year, as has been held in the
past?" The referendum requires only a
yes or no vote.
