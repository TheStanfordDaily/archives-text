# Task Force Hikes Room, Board While Cutting Food Services
## 
### GARY ATKINS 
If you like living in a Stanford dorm and eating
Stanford food, it'll cost you $50 more next year than it
did this year. And you'll find that Saturday lunch has
become Saturday brunch, and you may have to walk
across the street to get it.
Yesterday, acting on the recommendations of a
student-staff committee which has been studying room
and board costs since February, the Board of Trustees
approved an increase of about four percent in room and
board rates for 1972-73. Additionally, the Board accepted
the committee's recommendation that some food services
be reduced in order to keep costs down.
Rates Rise
The basic room rate will rise from $510 to $550 per
year; the basic board rate, from $785 to $795. Apartment
rates in Manzanita Park will rise five percent to $750 per
year.
In addition, the basic board plan will be reduced from
20 to 19 meals per week, with brunch taking the place of
breakfast and lunch on Saturday as it does on Sunday.
Brunches both days will be served only in three locations,
tentatively set at Wilbur Hall, Florence Moore, and
Lagunita Court.
The reductions mark the first time that significant cuts

have been made in food services in order to keep the size
of the rate increase down. In the past, residential services,
such as maid services and grounds maintenance, have been
cut. The cuts made were those favored by students who
responded to a poll taken by the committee last February.
More Effects
According to Edward Scoles, chairman of the
committee and director of housing and food services,
some 3,800 students will be affected by the room
increases, and 2,800 by the board increases.
Some hashers will lose working hours because of the
food service reductions. Scoles said the cuts should
eliminate the full-time equivalent of 10 to 15 hasher jobs.
This year, there were the equivalent of 220 full-time
hashing jobs.
Next year's increase of 3.9 percent in the rates will
apparently be less than predicted. Last year, a similar
Room and Board Task Force predicted that rates would
have to rise seven percent next fall in order to eliminate a
projected $103,000 deficit for this year.
Now, instead of a deficit, the residence office is
predicting a net profit of $71,000 for this year. According
to Scoles, the change is due primarily to a higher
occupancy rate in University residences.

board rates for 1972-73. Additionally, the Board accepted
the committee's recommendation that some food services
be reduced in order to keep costs down.
Rates Rise
The basic room rate will rise from $510 to $550 per
year; the basic board rate, from $785 to $795. Apartment
rates in Manzanita Park will rise five percent to $750 per
year.
In addition, the basic board plan will be reduced from
20 to 19 meals per week, with brunch taking the place of
breakfast and lunch on Saturday as it does on Sunday.
Brunches both days will be served only in three locations,
tentatively set at Wilbur Hall, Florence Moore, and
Lagunita Court.
The reductions mark the first time that significant cuts

have been made in food services in order to keep the size
of the rate increase down. In the past, residential services,
such as maid services and grounds maintenance, have been
cut. The cuts made were those favored by students who
responded to a poll taken by the committee last February.
More Effects
According to Edward Scoles, chairman of the
committee and director of housing and food services,
some 3,800 students will be affected by the room
increases, and 2,800 by the board increases.
Some hashers will lose working hours because of the
food service reductions. Scoles said the cuts should
eliminate the full-time equivalent of 10 to 15 hasher jobs.
This year, there were the equivalent of 220 full-time
hashing jobs.
Next year's increase of 3.9 percent in the rates will
apparently be less than predicted. Last year, a similar
Room and Board Task Force predicted that rates would
have to rise seven percent next fall in order to eliminate a
projected $103,000 deficit for this year.
Now, instead of a deficit, the residence office is
predicting a net profit of $71,000 for this year. According
to Scoles, the change is due primarily to a higher
occupancy rate in University residences.
