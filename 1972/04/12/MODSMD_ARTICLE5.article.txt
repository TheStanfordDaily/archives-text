# Trustees Announce Fund Drive, Seek $300 Million In Five Years
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
SAN FRANCISCO - Stanford
yesterday launched what it called the
largest fund-raising drive ever
attempted by a university â€” a five-year
effort to raise $300 million.
At a press conference here to
launch the drive, Trustee President
Robert Minge Brown said that a single
anonymous donor has already pledged
$15 million, the largest single gift the
University has ever received.
The pledge is part of a $45 million
"nucleus fund" which was lined up in
the last 10 months to start the
campaign.
President Richard Lyman admitted
the high goal to be "a rather audacious
undertaking." But he said the Univer
sity is confident of success after two
years of planning the drive. The PACE
program, a similar four-year effort,
ended in 1964 after raising $114
million.
Lyman said that administrators and
trustees decided that Stanford could
remain a top university "only by a
dramatic increase in private gift
support."
$15 Million Cost
A financial official predicted the
new drive will itself cost 4 to 5 percent
of the amount raised, or $12 or $15
million.
National co-chairmen for the cam
paign will be Trustees Richard E.
Guggenhime, a San Francisco attor
ney, and Chancellor J.E. Wallace
Sterling. Sterling, a veteran fund-raiser,
was Stanford's President during the
PACE campaign. Funds will be solicit
ed by regional campaign committees
across the country.

The $300 million total would be
divided into $125 million in endow
ment funds, $92 million in currently
usable funds, and $83 million for new
and renovated buildings.
The endowment category of $125
million would be added to the
University's current endowment of
$318 million. The new endowment
money would add to reserve funds for
professorships ($42 million), financial
aid ($35 million), and other uses.
Usable Money
The "currently usable money" of
$92 million would be spent on
instruction and research ($53 million),
financial aid ($2l million), libraries
and institutes ($6 million), and general
uses.
The $83 million building fund
would include $12.2 million for
renovation of buildings in the main
Quad. Among major new buildings,
funds would go to a new main library

complex ($19.7 million), medical
education facilities ($l6 million), a
law school ($6.9 million), engineering
$6.6 million), music ($5.7 million),
chemistry ($5.7 million) and other
science facilities.
Lyman said that by 1974 the new
fund drive, combined with a current
$6 million budget-cutting program,
should allow the University to elimi
nate its deficit, which currently is
$900,000.
Tuition Up
But he conceded that tuition will
probably continue to go up annually.
Sterling said he hopes the drive
"will sharpen the nation's awareness of
the value ... of the private sector of
higher education."
He said that the growth of public
colleges is leading to "more centralized
control, which, in time, may entail
greater uniformity." Sterling argued

that "the responsibility for sustaining
diversity" in higher education "rests
more squarely on the shoulders of the
private sector than ever before."
Grind Axe
Lyman, saying he wanted to "grind
the Stanford axe," argued that "there
is some finite limit to the number of
distinguished universities we can ever
hope to have. There are not the human
talents, quite aside from the financial
resources, to have a Stanford or a
Harvard at every crossroad."
Lyman objected that such are often
dismissed as "elitist" in what he called
"this day of rolling egalitarianism."
In response to questions, Lyman
commented that most alumni have
become "more understanding" of
campus protest. But he added, "In any
case, the needs and health of higher
education cannot await on complete
civil peace."
