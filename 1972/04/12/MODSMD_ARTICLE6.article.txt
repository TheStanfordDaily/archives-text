# Money-Raising Plans Outlined
## 
### HEIDI OLSEN BILL EVERS 
Yesterday's announcement of a $15
million donation to Stanford is the
kick-off to the largest single fund
raising drive ever undertaken by any
university.
The Campaign for Stanford is being
run by Kenneth Cuthbertson, the
University's Vice-President for De
velopment, Daryl Pearson, General
Secretary, and David Fulton, com
munications director for the Cam
paign.

The $15 million pledge was given
with stipulations which are designed to
make this pledge a tool for eliciting
money from other donors. Called a
"challenge pledge," the gift has been
structured so that parts of the total
can be used, in combination with
other large, over-$lOO thousand gifts,
to make possible various campus
projects. The $15 million will mostly
be used to match other large gifts on a
l-to-3 basis.
The announcement of the donation
is part of the strategy and tactics for
advertisement of the Campaign, begun
in January 1970. Cuthbertson dis
cussed these campaign tactics with the
Daily yesterday.
He stressed that it is a common
misconception that Stanford's private
funds come mainly from foundations.
He emphasized the financial impor
tance of the individual donor to the
University.
Large Donors
A large-scale donor usually turns
out to be the person who has donated
to Stanford in increasing amounts over
the years, he noted. The Stanford
fund-raising volunteer attempts to
tailor a donation program to suit the
particular needs and interests of a
donor who plans to give over $100
thousand. The large donor is often not
a Stanford alumni, and it is a
fund-raiser's mission to research inter
ests and desires for the donor, who
starts with no particular commitments
to giving to some specific part of the
University.
Cuthbertson said donations some
times come in strange packages, like
the "Clean Shirt" saga of an earlier
campaign. When schools in the Pacific
Eight Conference were investigated
about bribing football prospects, Stan
ford's recruiting practices were ex
amined, and Stanford came out with a
"clean shirt." A potential donor was
impressed, and gave $500 thousand to

a clean-shirted Stanford. The money
was earmarked for a Stanford profes
sorship affectionately known around
the Cuthbertson office as the Clean
Shirt Professorship.
Past Efforts
At the turn of the century a single
philanthropic donation of approxi
mately $21 million from Senator
Leland Stanford gave Stanford Univer
sity the then largest endowment of
any institution of higher learning in
America.
But restrictions placed on the
trustees of the University left them
eventually holding an increasingly less
valuable collection of railroad bonds.
Furthermore, the trustees of the
University in its early years did not
seek to raise more capital but rather
strove to preserve and protect Leland
Stanford's original endowment. During
the first third of the twentieth
century, many Eastern schools stole a
march on Stanford in soliciting funds
from prosperous industrialists.
Stanford began its concerted effort
at annual fund drives just before the
Second World War, but the war
interrupted such fund-raising. In the
early 19505, Stanford was gathering in
only $3 million a year in private gifts
to the University. That figure is now in
the neighborhood of $30 million a
year, and the planners of the new
Campaign hope for a quantum jump in
regular private giving to the University
to the level of $50 million a year by
the time their Campaign work is over
five years from now.
Stanford fund-raisers look in as
tonishment and envy at the tradition
bound Ivy League's extensive alumni
donations. Stanford lacks the en
trenched tradition of alumni donations
that exists in the Ivy League. Student
involvement is seen as essential to
establish some equivalent to the Ivy
League's traditions.

fund-raiser's mission to research inter
ests and desires for the donor, who
starts with no particular commitments
to giving to some specific part of the
University.
Cuthbertson said donations some
times come in strange packages, like
the "Clean Shirt" saga of an earlier
campaign. When schools in the Pacific
Eight Conference were investigated
about bribing football prospects, Stan
ford's recruiting practices were ex
amined, and Stanford came out with a
"clean shirt." A potential donor was
impressed, and gave $500 thousand to

a clean-shirted Stanford. The money
was earmarked for a Stanford profes
sorship affectionately known around
the Cuthbertson office as the Clean
Shirt Professorship.
Past Efforts
At the turn of the century a single
philanthropic donation of approxi
mately $21 million from Senator
Leland Stanford gave Stanford Univer
sity the then largest endowment of
any institution of higher learning in
America.
But restrictions placed on the
trustees of the University left them
eventually holding an increasingly less
valuable collection of railroad bonds.
Furthermore, the trustees of the
University in its early years did not
seek to raise more capital but rather
strove to preserve and protect Leland
Stanford's original endowment. During
the first third of the twentieth
century, many Eastern schools stole a
march on Stanford in soliciting funds
from prosperous industrialists.
Stanford began its concerted effort
at annual fund drives just before the
Second World War, but the war
interrupted such fund-raising. In the
early 19505, Stanford was gathering in
only $3 million a year in private gifts
to the University. That figure is now in
the neighborhood of $30 million a
year, and the planners of the new
Campaign hope for a quantum jump in
regular private giving to the University
to the level of $50 million a year by
the time their Campaign work is over
five years from now.
Stanford fund-raisers look in as
tonishment and envy at the tradition
bound Ivy League's extensive alumni
donations. Stanford lacks the en
trenched tradition of alumni donations
that exists in the Ivy League. Student
involvement is seen as essential to
establish some equivalent to the Ivy
League's traditions.
Yesterday's announcement of a $15
million donation to Stanford is the
kick-off to the largest single fund
raising drive ever undertaken by any
university.
The Campaign for Stanford is being
run by Kenneth Cuthbertson, the
University's Vice-President for De
velopment, Daryl Pearson, General
Secretary, and David Fulton, com
munications director for the Cam
paign.

The $15 million pledge was given
with stipulations which are designed to
make this pledge a tool for eliciting
money from other donors. Called a
"challenge pledge," the gift has been
structured so that parts of the total
can be used, in combination with
other large, over-$lOO thousand gifts,
to make possible various campus
projects. The $15 million will mostly
be used to match other large gifts on a
l-to-3 basis.
The announcement of the donation
is part of the strategy and tactics for
advertisement of the Campaign, begun
in January 1970. Cuthbertson dis
cussed these campaign tactics with the
Daily yesterday.
He stressed that it is a common
misconception that Stanford's private
funds come mainly from foundations.
He emphasized the financial impor
tance of the individual donor to the
University.
Large Donors
A large-scale donor usually turns
out to be the person who has donated
to Stanford in increasing amounts over
the years, he noted. The Stanford
fund-raising volunteer attempts to
tailor a donation program to suit the
particular needs and interests of a
donor who plans to give over $100
thousand. The large donor is often not
a Stanford alumni, and it is a
fund-raiser's mission to research inter
ests and desires for the donor, who
starts with no particular commitments
to giving to some specific part of the
University.
