# Two Nabbed In Pot Bust

### CHRIS PECK 
Two freshmen were arrested for
possession and cultivation of mari
juana early yesterday morning when
Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies,
armed with a search warrant, confis
cated what appeared to be 13
marijuana plants and other contraband
in their dorm room.
Donner residents Haney Armstrong,
19, and Ron Hopkins, 18, were
awakened at 8:24 a.m. Monday to the
knock of two uniformed sheriff's
deputies and a plainclothes officer
who arrested the two students after
spotting 13 suspicious plants on the
window sill.
The two hand-cuffed students were
led away from the dormitory at about
9 a.m. Monday. Later in the day the
two freshmen were released on their
own recognizance and returned to the
Stem Hall dormitory. Arraignment on
the two charges has been set for April
24.
Although the police report on the
incident was not available las night,
the arrests may have come as the result
of a cruising sheriff's deputy spotting
the outline of the plants in the
students' dorm window on Sunday,
according to a Stanford public safety
official. A search warrant was
issued Sunday evening. A number of
Donner residents reported seeing
someone walking in the hallways of
the dorm writing down names and
room numbers that night, according to
the two arrested.
Besides confiscating the plants,
sheriff's deputies also took 12 uniden
tified seeds and a bag of suspected
marijuana from a coat in the room.
"They also took our nasturtiums,"

Armstrong said.
Marijuana Petition Taken
Also reportedly taken during the
search of the room was a petition
being circulated by Hopkins for the
California Marijuana Initiative. Ac
cording to Hopkins, upon finding the
petition on a desk, one of the officers
put it in his pocket and reportedly
remarked, "I'm going to take this
thing and copy down the names on
it." The petition was returned when
the two were released.
Law professor John Kaplan, author
of Marijuana: The New Prohibition
and a consistent critic of present
marijuana laws called the confiscation
of the CMI petition and the threat of
intimidation of those who signed it "a
very serious business."
"Such intimidation by police would
be a clear violation of the basic rights
of the first amendment," Kaplan said
last night, "and it was a very dumb
thing for the sheriffs deputy to say. I
hope the Santa Clara sheriffs know
better than that."
The law professor also expressed
surprise that the bust took place under
the presently tolerant attitude towards
marijuana. "I didn't think that this
sort of thing still could happen at
Stanford," he admitted, "and I can
only comment that these two guys are
terribly unlucky."
Kaplan estimates that more than 70
percent of the current student body
has tried marijuana at some time or
another and that just under 50 percent
are steady users. Speculating on why
the two freshmen were busted, Kaplan
said, "I think because they were
suspected of cultivating that the

Sheriff's office took the case more
seriously."
Not A Crackdown
University officials emphatically
denied that the bust was the beginning
of a crackdown on marijuana use at
Stanford. Police Chief Marv Harring
ton assured students that "this certain
ly is an isolated incident, not indica
tive of any new policy concerning
marijuana."
"When somebody does something
that is flagrantly illegal," Chief Har
rington continued, apparently refer
ring to the fact that the plants were
visible from the street, "it's pretty
logical that you're asking for it."
Assistant to the President John
Schwartz said the University had no
prior knowledge of the raid and did
not authorize it. "While University
policy still states that we will co
operate with law enforcement agencies
in controlling drug abuse, we had no
knowledge of these arrests until we
were notified that the two students
were in custody," Schwartz said.
Second Bust Sunday
Police Chief Harrington noted that
the only other drug arrests in the past
six months at Stanford occurred at
Lake Lagunita just a day before
Monday's raid. At about 1:00 a.m.
Sunday morning, a sheriff's marked
car on a routine patrol around Lake
Lag discovered a car parked on the dirt
road around the lake.
Upon investigation, the deputies
discovered three juveniles in the car
and an unidentified substance re
sembling marijuana. The three were
charged with possession of the drug
and booked in juvenile court today.
