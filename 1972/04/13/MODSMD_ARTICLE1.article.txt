# Zweig Found Not Guilty Of Interview Disruption
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) hear
ing officer Stephen Tennis has recom
mended a not guilty verdict in the
Campus Disruption Policy case of
Stanford Rehabilitation Movement
member Don Zweig.
Zweig, a sophomore, was charged
for the November 4 disruption of
Electrical Engineering student Duane
Linsenbardt's interview with a repre
sentative of the TRW Corporation at
the Placement Center. Four other
students were given three quarter
suspension by the CJP for their role in
the incident.
CJP Chairman John Kaplan told the
Daily last night that "this case, as far
as I'm concerned, is closed." He said
that he had no plans to convene the
Panel to hear the case because of
Tennis' recommendation.
Tennis, an attorney with the San
Francisco firm of Howard, Prim, Rice,
Nemerovski, Canaday and Pollak, said
in his 15 page report that "the
University has failed to sustain its
burden of proving beyond a reasonable
doubt that Mr. Zweig" violated the
Disruption Policy.
The University had charged that
Zweig had joined the four previously
tried students in following Linsenbardt
and the TRW interviewer from Room I
to Room F of the Placement Center
and that he had disrupted the
interview in the latter room.

Tennis was critical of the University
in his findings because its "charge
against Mr. Zweig failed to specify, in
any detail, the facts upon which it was
based." Tennis added that if Zweig
had been "properly charged with
violating the Policy on Campus Disrup
tion by his presence in Room I, I
would recommend that the facts
found" would warrant a guilty verdict.
Kaplan said last night that Tennis
"puts it much more strongly than I
would." Of Tennis' words in the
report Kaplan said "he means 'I might
recommend' " a guilty verdict.
Accompanying his findings, Tennis
included his rejection of Special
Assistant to the President John
Schwartz's motion to strike the
testimony of a defense witness. During
the hearing, Schwartz, who is the
University's prosecutor in CJP cases,
moved that the testimony of Kari
Collins be removed from the record
after she had refused to answer his
questions about her reasons for being
in Room I.
Tennis said that since the testimony
in question was "not addressed to
relevant issues of fact, I felt that
striking her entire testimony was too
severe a sanction." However, Tennis
also said that he took the doubts over
Collins' credibility into account when
considering her testimony that Zweig
was never in Room I on November 4.
Only one of Tennis' 30 findings of

fact mentioned Zweig. The last finding
states that he "was standing just inside
the doorway of Room F at the time"
that Lieutenant Don Tamm of the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's Police
ordered the Center cleared. Tamm's
order came after the incident was
declared a violation of the Policy on
Campus Disruption by Placement
Center Director Ralph Keller. Accord
ing to Tennis, "the University has
failed to establish beyond a reasonable
doubt that Mr. Zweig was in Room F
prior to that time."
Defense counsel Owen Blank, con
tacted late last night, commented on
Tennis' recommendation "it's better
to blow out the candle and curse the
darkness than be fooled by a little
light."
He explained that the result of the
case "is not an indication of any
fairness in the procedures. It's only an
indication of the extreme weaknesses
in the prosecution's case."
