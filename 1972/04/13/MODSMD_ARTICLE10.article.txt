Advocates
Editor, THE DAILY:
The composition and method
of election of the public interest
law firm, Citizens Advocates at
Stanford, as laid down in their
Articles of Incorporation, make it
almost impossible for the
organization to represent the
community. Five of the eleven
members are appointed by the
proceeding board of directors. Of
these appointed members, one is
required to be a law professor,
one a Stanford faculty member,
and of the other three appointed
"community representatives" two
are required to be attorneys.
In addition, two of the six
student-elected members are to be
law students. Thus, five law-type
people are required on the board
of directors and something even
more alarming ten of the eleven
directors are professionals or
would be professionals. The one
and only true non-attorney
community representative is
appointed by a previous board
that is itself dominated by
professional class people. We
understand that the present
composition of the board of
directors is a result of negotiations
with the foundations who are
considering giving their support to
the project.
We think that the board of
directors should be elected from
candidates who come from both
campus and outside communities,
as we feel such a board will be
more responsive to society's
needs. We also urge that
provisions be made for recall of
members for the board and for
changing the Articles of
Incorporation on the basis of
referenda among associate
members, should this become
necessary at any time.
The Articles of Incorporation
as they stand at the present time
do not mention recall of directors
and the only mechanism for
change in the structure of the
organization is by a decision of
three-fourths of the board of
directors.
We urge Stanford students not
to support citizen's advocate firm
in its present form until it is made
more responsible to its electorate.

Racism
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to question the
objectivity of the Daily coverage
of political figures who have
appeared on the Stanford campus.
I would like to use the coverage
given to McCloskey and the lack
of it given to Ronald V. Dellums.
On Monday, April 3, 1972, the
Daily carried a small article on the
front page announcing
McCloskey's visit to the campus.
The Daily stated that McCloskey
is running in the 17th
Congressional District which
include all of Stanford and most
of Palo Alto.
On Tuesday, April 4, 1972, the
Daily headlines stated:
"McCloskey Hits Viet Bombimg,
Urges Republican Registration".
There were two pictures on the

front page of the April 4th edition
of the Daily, one of McCloskey
speaking at the noon rally, the
other speaking in Faison lounge
urging students to register
Republican.
McCloskey also appeared on
KZSU 'Close Up', outlining his
political beliefs. The "Maverick
Republican" as he is called, was
given tremendous coverage in his
campaign for reelection. On April
3, 1972, on page 2, there was
another article on McCloskey
titled, "McCloskey's Drastic
Chance". This article stated that
McCloskey hits hard on four
major campaign issues: the war,
the environment, restoration of
truth in government, and of
course, "racial discrimination".
Enough on McCloskey. Black
Congressman Ronald V. Dellums
of the 7th Congressional District
spoke Sunday, April 9, 1972, at
the Conference on Prisons.
Ronald V. Dellums did not speak
on congressional priorities as they
are called. Dellums spoke on "gut
issues". Congressman Dellums is
introducing a new bill into
Congress. It is the Omnibus Penal
Reform Act. This bill will deal
with reforms in our prison
systems as well as rehabilitation
programs for prisoners.
Congressman Dellums'
presence on campus was covered
in passing on the back page of the
April 10th issue of the Daily. How
loud and how long do we have to
scream racism? How long are we
expected to tolerate such obvious
acts of racism and categorically
classify them as legitimate
mistakes? There have been many
instances of racism, oppression
and suppression on this campus.
If the Daily continues to
suppress the only means of
communication between the
Black community and Black
politicians our only alternative is
to devise methods by which to
react to such policies.
This systematic process of
deletion should not be
overlooked. We are attempting to
deal with one particular instance
of racism on the Stanford campus.
The Daily must expand its level of
consciousness when dealing with
issues which directly effect and
pertain to the aspirations and
needs of the Black community.

McCloskey
Editor, THE DAILY:
As incredible as it seems to
many of us, Rep. Paul McCloskey
stood before a student audience at
White Plaza, April 3, and
suggested that the United States
Government not only end the
Vietnam war entirely on the
Communists' terms, namely their
7-point "peace" plan, but went so
far as to say that we should have
done so last year.
Despite the open invasion of
South Vietnam two weeks ago,
McCloskey apparently clings to
the totally obsolete "civil war"
theory, with its attendant
assumption that somehow the
South rightfully belongs to the
North, and no one should try to
stop them from reclaiming it.
Needless to say, this position is
shared by precious few of his
fellow Republicans, and it is
thinking like that which has sent

many of us scurrying to find a
more rational candidate to
represent the 17th District.
The man we have found is Dr.
Royce Cole of Palo Alto, who
frankly admits that McCloskey is
his major reason for entering the
race. The quiet-spoken member of
the Palo Alto School Board
believes, as we do, that the
two-party system functions best
when the opposing candidates
reasonably represent the
mainstream views of their
respective parties.
