## Iran: Roots Of Repression 
### 
Iranian national front

Trials of the Iranian regime's
opponents are becoming
progressively more frequent and
the sentences turned out to be
increasingly harsh.
There were twenty-one
executions in 1971. Six people
were executed on March Ist of
this year. What is more important,
the military court of appeals had
changed the ten life
imprisonment sentences
pronounced on the 31st of last
January to death penalty. Four of
them were executed on March
2nd. It seemed that the military
tribunals had received orders to
stiffen the sentences first given to
the militants of the opposition.
These decisions came at a time
when the government-controlled
media was creating an atmosphere
reminiscent of the worst
memories of the Stalin period and
of the pre-World War II Nazis.
Just as an example we can
mention the "patriotic women of
Iran" who had asked to be
"allowed to use their nails to tear
out the eyes of the enemies of the
country!"
On March 12, nine others were
executed. This time, not even the
date of their conviction was
announced. The death penalty
will probably hang over several of
the 150 (approximately) people
on trial.
Severity
How has the situation come to
this point? The severity of the
measures taken is an indication of
the growing urban guerrilla
movement. Over the last fifteen
months young Iranians — for the
most part intellectuals — have
gone underground to wage an
armed battle against the Shah's
regime. There has been an
increasing number of strikes
against police stations and rural
militia posts, banks, and
administration buildings.
Ziaddin Farsio, chairman of
Iran's military tribunals, was shot
down by pistol fire on April 7,
1971, and attempts were made to
kidnap the US ambassador in j
Tehran and the Shah's nephew, j
Assassination attempts have also 1
been made against other
prominent persons in the regime.
With such a tally of violent I

incidents, there is room for
surprise that the government does
not give greater publicity to these
trials which for the most part take
place behind closed doors and are
characterized by their remarkable
summariness. Last year thirteen
accused men were actually
executed before the charges
against them were even published
in the press.
Secrecy
Such secrecy on the part of
officials tends only to give
substance to Opposition charges
that torture is routine in Iranian
prisons, that accused persons
frequently die before they are
brought to trial, and that the
authorities are taking advantage of
the situation to send opponents to
jail; even those who have nothing
to do with violence.
From time to time, the
Confederation of Iranian Students
Abroad puts out names of missing
persons, of whom no trace can be
found, in prison or elsewhere. On
more than one occasion,
representatives of foreign
organizations have charged the
Iranian Security Service —
"Savak" — with "violations of the
fundamental rights of human
beings", and of instituting a reign
of terror.
From January 28 to February
6, 1972, two lawyers of the World
Federation of the Rights of Man,
Nouri Albala and Henri Libertalis,
were in Iran as observers of the
trials. They describe the barbaric
methods used to obtain
confessions. Reza Rezai, one of
the 37 persons arrested August
23, and who recently escaped
from prison, in a letter to Le
Monde (February 12, 1972)

describes how American and
Israili advisors work in Iranian
prisons to put forth the most
"efficient" methods of torture.
Electric shocks (by machines
given by the US AID program)
and the injection of drugs are the
most frequently used methods.
Misfortune
How does the United States
dare to impose such misfortune
on the Iranian people by
promoting the Shah's regime so
directly and so actively? Things
began when, for the first time in
history, Iran nationalized its oil
industry under the leadership of
Dr. Mossadegh in 1951. The
imperialist countries evidently
could not stand this move.
What is more, Iran would be a
"bad example" for other oil-rich
countries of the Third World. The
Eisenhower Administration, by
spending $10 million of the ClA's
budget, shamelessly organized a
coup d'etat led by one of the Nazi
collaborators (Yes!!) to overthrow
the national government of Dr.
Mossadegh on August 23, 1953.
(See American Empire, by Claude
Julien.)
Since then, a cruel fascist
regime has been ruling Iran with
the eager aid of the US
government. On June 5,1963, the
Shah's tanks smashed a sudden
nationwide uprising. Associated
Press reported 5,000 killed in one
day in Tehran. The Shah's regime
has tried to keep the peoples'
thoughts occupied with expensive
fantasies like the celebration of
2500 years of monarchy, and with
constant propaganda about the
"flourishing" economic situation,
thanks to its fabulous revenues
from petroleum resources.

According to the government,
the growth rate reached 20
percent last year. The same source
said that the "agrarian reform"
and "worker participation in
profits" have delighted the
working class. Strikes, unrest in
the universities, and a growth of
urban guerrilla movements
demonstrate that Iran has not
solved its most urgent social and
political problems.
The outlawing of all opposition
parties, complemented by pitiless
repression and absence of even the
most fundamental liberties,
deprives the Iranians of an
indispensable safety valve and
serves to accentuate grievances
that a more liberal policy has
tackled more effectively.
Iran is not at all a special case
in today's world situation. It
would be very ignorant if one
does not see the dirty hands of
those who are not only playing
with the lives of the peoples of
the Third World, but are depriving
them of their dignity:
King Hussein of Jordan, after
having massacred ten thousand
Palestinians with napalm bombs
on September 1970, received
more F-5 jets from the US
government because, in Nixon's
words, he has saved his country
just like Lincoln. The Greek Junta
and the new repressive Turkish
government are both expecting
American phantoms. They are
NATO members and, no matter
what is the price for their people,
are contributing to the American
defense. On March 30, eleven
Turkish students and their three
hostages were blown up in a house
because the Turkish government
did not want to talk to them.

Attica is not only in New York.
Once we have finished reading
this article, we put it on the
bookshelf beside other books and
articles about Greece, Turkey, the
Latin American countries, and
South East Asia. The bookshelf
becomes full, and we know
everything. Let us look at our
hands; they are completely empty
and strangely white. Shouldn't the
people of this country decide to
wake up and shake themselves,
use their brains, and stop playing
the stupid game of the Sleeping
Beauty?
