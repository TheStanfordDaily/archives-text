# Candidate Calls For Big Defense Budget
## 
### DAVID SULITEANU 
Republican Congressional
candidate, Dr. Royce Cole, said
Tuesday night that though the
economy was this country's most
critical problem, he would not
balance the budget at the expense
of military spending.
Dr. Cole, who will appear on
the Republican primary ballot
June 6 along with Rep.
McCloskey and Bob Barry,
addressed an audience of 60
people in Junipero lounge.
"If it weren't for Soviet Russia,
which is a dictatorial, imperialistic
power," he commented, "we
wouldn't need a strong military."
When asked whether the U.S.S.R.
wanted "to wipe out" the United
States, Cole replied, "Of course."
In contrasting the two
countries, the Palo Alto School
Board member said, "The United
States does not use its economic
power to influence other
countries throughout the world."
He later asked a member of the
audience which country, the
United States or Russia, "has been
the source of most of the world's
evil since W.W. II?"
In addition to the economy
and the military, Cole listed
education and pollution as his
other major concerns. Despite
numerous requests for an
explanation as to how these
problems were to be solved when
the Dept. of Defense received
such a large portion of the budget,
Cole did not elaborate. He did say
that the amount of defense
spending should be determined
"by those who know best — the
Joint Chiefs of Staff."
In response to a question
concerning whether the
government was spending money
efficiently, Cole answered, "If
you mean are our ends being
accomplished, I would have to say
no.
Cole defended the presence of
United States troops in Vietnam
by saying, "You have to
remember that if there was no
North Vietnam, there would be

no war." There would also be no
war, he added, if the U.S.S.R. and
China were not supporting the
North Vietnamese.
Because the United States has
to do whatever is necessary to aid
the South Vietnamese, explained
the candidate, he supports the
recent increase in U.S. bombing.
Cole commented briefly on
several other issues:
—The government should be
"compassionate" towards draft
evaders who fled the country out
of a sincere conscientious
objection to war by allowing them
to serve alternate service. Those
who left for political reasons
"should not be allowed to
return."
—He favored busing only if it
improved the quality of education
in this country.
Cole, a practicing physician at
the Palo Alto Medical Clinic since
1965, has been a member of the
Board of Education of the Palo
Alto Unified School District since
1969.
He was Chairman of Palo Alto
Young Republicans in 1967;
Chairman of the Santa Clara
County Young Republicans in
1968, and Precinct Chairman for
Assemblyman Richard Hayden in
1970.

ROYCE COLE SPEAKS — Republican Congressional Candidate, Dr.
Royce Cole, spoke to students in Junipero lounge Tuesday evening.
The Palo Alto School Board member stated that we need a strong
military to counter the imperialistic power of Soviet Russia.
Republican Congressional
candidate, Dr. Royce Cole, said
Tuesday night that though the
economy was this country's most
critical problem, he would not
balance the budget at the expense
of military spending.
Dr. Cole, who will appear on
the Republican primary ballot
June 6 along with Rep.
McCloskey and Bob Barry,
addressed an audience of 60
people in Junipero lounge.
"If it weren't for Soviet Russia,
which is a dictatorial, imperialistic
power," he commented, "we
wouldn't need a strong military."
When asked whether the U.S.S.R.
wanted "to wipe out" the United
States, Cole replied, "Of course."
In contrasting the two
countries, the Palo Alto School
Board member said, "The United
States does not use its economic
power to influence other
countries throughout the world."
He later asked a member of the
audience which country, the
United States or Russia, "has been
the source of most of the world's
evil since W.W. II?"
In addition to the economy
and the military, Cole listed
education and pollution as his
other major concerns. Despite
numerous requests for an
explanation as to how these
problems were to be solved when
the Dept. of Defense received
such a large portion of the budget,
Cole did not elaborate. He did say
that the amount of defense
spending should be determined
"by those who know best — the
Joint Chiefs of Staff."
In response to a question
concerning whether the
government was spending money
efficiently, Cole answered, "If
you mean are our ends being
accomplished, I would have to say
no.
Cole defended the presence of
United States troops in Vietnam
by saying, "You have to
remember that if there was no
North Vietnam, there would be

no war." There would also be no
war, he added, if the U.S.S.R. and
China were not supporting the
North Vietnamese.
Because the United States has
to do whatever is necessary to aid
the South Vietnamese, explained
the candidate, he supports the
recent increase in U.S. bombing.
Cole commented briefly on
several other issues:
—The government should be
"compassionate" towards draft
evaders who fled the country out
of a sincere conscientious
objection to war by allowing them
to serve alternate service. Those
who left for political reasons
"should not be allowed to
return."
—He favored busing only if it
improved the quality of education
in this country.
Cole, a practicing physician at
the Palo Alto Medical Clinic since
1965, has been a member of the
Board of Education of the Palo
Alto Unified School District since
1969.
He was Chairman of Palo Alto
Young Republicans in 1967;
Chairman of the Santa Clara
County Young Republicans in
1968, and Precinct Chairman for
Assemblyman Richard Hayden in
1970.
