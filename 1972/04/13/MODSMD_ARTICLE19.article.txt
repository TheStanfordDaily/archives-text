# Stewart Supports Volunteer Army
## 
### LARRY HUMMER 
Democratic Congressional
candidate Jim Stewart scored
Congressman Pete McCloskey's
stand against a volunteer army as
a "nonsense argument." Tuesday
night.
Stewart, a San Jose attorney
who is seeking to wrest the
Democratic nomination from four
opponents, met with students first
in Branner and then in Donner
Hall. In the upcoming June 6
primary, Stewart is running
against Mayor Gary Gillmor of
Santa Clara, Charles Duke, an
electronic "software" specialist
for General Electric, Ray Chote,
an indigent, and Bill Hugle, an
industrialist.
McCloskey has said that a
volunteer army would be manned
by unreasonable men. Stewart
said that decisions in the Army
even now are made by career
officers, not graduates of Cal and
Stanford. He maintained that if a
liberal education is desirable for
officers, "then close down
Annapolis, and West Point."
Stewart believes the funds are
available to support a volunteer
army at an adequate size, which
he says is smaller than the present
army. "The point of an army," he
said, "is to defend this country.
The draft gives you an unlimited
expansion of the Army to fight
undeclared foreign wars."
Stewart said he was troubled
by the argument that a volunteer
army would be manned by the
black and the poor, but he
maintained "that's the same
cannon fodder we have today."
It is necessary to reduce our
troop strength in NATO, Stewart
said, to less than a third of what it
is today. He wants the Europeans
to bear the burden of defending
their soil, "you're not going to do
it by, come on, gang, do your
share. When we withdraw, they'll
do their share."
Stewart called for an end to
the war and amnesty for draft
resistors without requiring
alternate service. "We are a nation
in a great deal of pain at the
present time," he said, blasting
the Nixon administration for its
involvement with ITT, farm

subsidies, a "criminally large oil
depletion allowance," and "wage
control, but no price control."
"The conspicuous consumption
going on by those that do have is
worse than nonconsumption by
those that don't have."
Stewart voiced concern over
the present interest in the
"quality of life." "There's so
much talk about redwoods, but
I'm more concerned with the
problems of blacks in east San
Jose."
Stewart said such job
re-training was not necessary for
unemployed aerospace engineers.
He advocates employing them in
governmentally financed programs
to improve urban areas and
transportation facilities.
Despite similarities between his
and McCloskey's positions on
many issues, Stewart points out
that he disagrees with
McCloskey's votes for preventive
detention and "no-knock" in the
District of Columbia, and the
Congressman's stand against a
national health care program.
Stewart sees his chances for
election as good, but only because
he expects McCloskey to be
defeated in the Republican
primary. "If McCloskey were
nominated," he says, "my chances
of winning would 'be very
difficult. It would be difficult to
raise enough money."
Stewart sees himself as leading
Hugle and Gillmor, his two major
primary opponents, who are less
liberal than he.
After talking with students in
Donner, Stewart went to Junipero
to have a joint discussion with
conservative Republican candidate
Royce Cole, who is opposing
McCloskey in the primary, but
Cole had to leave for a school
board meeting.

do their share."
Stewart called for an end to
the war and amnesty for draft
resistors without requiring
alternate service. "We are a nation
in a great deal of pain at the
present time," he said, blasting
the Nixon administration for its
involvement with ITT, farm

subsidies, a "criminally large oil
depletion allowance," and "wage
control, but no price control."
"The conspicuous consumption
going on by those that do have is
worse than nonconsumption by
those that don't have."
Stewart voiced concern over
the present interest in the
"quality of life." "There's so
much talk about redwoods, but
I'm more concerned with the
problems of blacks in east San
Jose."
Stewart said such job
re-training was not necessary for
unemployed aerospace engineers.
He advocates employing them in
governmentally financed programs
to improve urban areas and
transportation facilities.
Despite similarities between his
and McCloskey's positions on
many issues, Stewart points out
that he disagrees with
McCloskey's votes for preventive
detention and "no-knock" in the
District of Columbia, and the
Congressman's stand against a
national health care program.
Stewart sees his chances for
election as good, but only because
he expects McCloskey to be
defeated in the Republican
primary. "If McCloskey were
nominated," he says, "my chances
of winning would 'be very
difficult. It would be difficult to
raise enough money."
Stewart sees himself as leading
Hugle and Gillmor, his two major
primary opponents, who are less
liberal than he.
After talking with students in
Donner, Stewart went to Junipero
to have a joint discussion with
conservative Republican candidate
Royce Cole, who is opposing
McCloskey in the primary, but
Cole had to leave for a school
board meeting.

DEMO CANDIDATE—Jim Stewart, who is running as a Democrat in
the 17th Congressional district primary election on June 6, is seen
speaking to students during some discussion sessions he held in
dormitories on Tuesday night.
Democratic Congressional
candidate Jim Stewart scored
Congressman Pete McCloskey's
stand against a volunteer army as
a "nonsense argument." Tuesday
night.
Stewart, a San Jose attorney
who is seeking to wrest the
Democratic nomination from four
opponents, met with students first
in Branner and then in Donner
Hall. In the upcoming June 6
primary, Stewart is running
against Mayor Gary Gillmor of
Santa Clara, Charles Duke, an
electronic "software" specialist
for General Electric, Ray Chote,
an indigent, and Bill Hugle, an
industrialist.
McCloskey has said that a
volunteer army would be manned
by unreasonable men. Stewart
said that decisions in the Army
even now are made by career
officers, not graduates of Cal and
Stanford. He maintained that if a
liberal education is desirable for
officers, "then close down
Annapolis, and West Point."
Stewart believes the funds are
available to support a volunteer
army at an adequate size, which
he says is smaller than the present
army. "The point of an army," he
said, "is to defend this country.
The draft gives you an unlimited
expansion of the Army to fight
undeclared foreign wars."
Stewart said he was troubled
by the argument that a volunteer
army would be manned by the
black and the poor, but he
maintained "that's the same
cannon fodder we have today."
It is necessary to reduce our
troop strength in NATO, Stewart
said, to less than a third of what it
is today. He wants the Europeans
to bear the burden of defending
their soil, "you're not going to do
it by, come on, gang, do your
share. When we withdraw, they'll
do their share."
