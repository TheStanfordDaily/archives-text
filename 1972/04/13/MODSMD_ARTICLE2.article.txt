# For ASSU Presidency
## Voluntarist Hocker Runs Again 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Chris Hocker and Robin Friedman's
platform has changed little since last
year when the two lost the ASSU
presidency by only 180 votes.
"The ASSU should be a voluntary
organization," says Hocker. "If you
have a voluntary organization, the
organization has to prove itself worthy
of membership and not just sit there

on its ass."
Hocker claims that this year's
Council of Presidents has further
supported his position that the ASSU
as currently constituted is "really
bullshit."
Friedman puts the issue more
philosophically. "People are meant to
be free," she says,"and therefore you
shouldn't be forced to be the member

of an organization which has someone
trying to get into law school at its
head making statements for you and
telling you what to think."

Presidential Slate

Hocker feels the majority of people
at Stanford probably don't care about
the ASSU. "I personally dislike cam
paigning," he says, "because I always
feel I'm annoying people with some
thing they don't eare about, which is
probably true."
Hocker says he and Robin didn't do
much campaigning last year and that
they were generally "shocked" at how
well they did.
But Hocker feels it was his political
conservatism which in the end was
responsible for his losing. He points to
the fact that he and Robin were the
only candidates campaigning for no
money to be assessed students for the


CHRISTOPHER-ROBlN—Libertarians Chris Hocker and Robin Friedman are
once again trying for the ASSU presidency. The slate came within 200 votes of
winning last year.
