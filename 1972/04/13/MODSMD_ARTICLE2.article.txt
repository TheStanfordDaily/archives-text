# For ASSU Presidency
## Voluntarist Hocker Runs Again 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Chris Hocker and Robin Friedman's
platform has changed little since last
year when the two lost the ASSU
presidency by only 180 votes.
"The ASSU should be a voluntary
organization," says Hocker. "If you
have a voluntary organization, the
organization has to prove itself worthy
of membership and not just sit there

on its ass."
Hocker claims that this year's
Council of Presidents has further
supported his position that the ASSU
as currently constituted is "really
bullshit."
Friedman puts the issue more
philosophically. "People are meant to
be free," she says,"and therefore you
shouldn't be forced to be the member

of an organization which has someone
trying to get into law school at its
head making statements for you and
telling you what to think."

Hocker feels the majority of people
at Stanford probably don't care about
the ASSU. "I personally dislike cam
paigning," he says, "because I always
feel I'm annoying people with some
thing they don't eare about, which is
probably true."
Hocker says he and Robin didn't do
much campaigning last year and that
they were generally "shocked" at how
well they did.
But Hocker feels it was his political
conservatism which in the end was
responsible for his losing. He points to
the fact that he and Robin were the
only candidates campaigning for no
money to be assessed students for the

facilities and counseling aren't there."
As to how the task forces would
work, Burke points to the ASSU
Senate committee he headed this year
which held public hearings and author
ed a report highly critical of the
management of Tresidder Union.
'Voluntary ASSU'
But the Mocker-Friedman slate
charges that there's nothing Burke did
which he couldn't have done without
the title of ASSU Senator.
Burke feels differently. "In my
Tresidder report, being the head of an
ASSU committee allowed me to
burrow in and get information I
couldn't have gotten otherwise. It also
drew more attention to the problems
than if I had merely been a concerned
student. I think if you have organized
student interests you get a lot farther."
"I've always been attracted by the
philosophy of libertarianism," says
Burke. He even confesses he was an
"Ayn Rand freak" in high school.
"But I think it's unrealistic to
expect that on sheer altruism people
are going to devote the time and
energy necessary to work on these
problems.
Concern Not Enough
"I probably wouldn't have spent so
much time on Tresidder as an
individually concerned student, but I
felt I had to pay back those who voted
me into office and do something."
Appel also sees the task forces as
possibly getting credit from SWOPSI
or SCIRE.

Appel himself got three units from
a business school professor last year to
investigate Tresidder Drug Store busi
ness practices which turned out to be
somewhat less than satisfactory.
"The professor had me mark cans
of hairspray to see how fast the
inventory was turning over," he
recalls. "Well, after a year and a half
some of those cans are still sitting
there."
'That's only one example of areas
in the University which are falling
asleep and where task forces could
help," says Appel.
Qualifications
As for the Barber-Fay-Cortez slate,
Burke says,"I was surprised that they
put varsity soccer and golf as qualifi
cations for the office.
"I think it's fine to get involved in
things like that and it shows that
they're well-rounded people, but it
seems they're trying to imitate Pat C.
Shea (a former ASSU President who is
primarily remembered for his surf
ing)."
"You can't be an auxiliary to the
administration if you want to repre
sent student interests," concludes
Burke, "you have to have some
background of speaking up to the
University."
Burke is a junior in philosophy;
Wong, a junior in anthropology;
Appel, a coterminal student in history;
and Van Patten a sophomore in
political science.

facilities and counseling aren't there."
As to how the task forces would
work, Burke points to the ASSU
Senate committee he headed this year
which held public hearings and author
ed a report highly critical of the
management of Tresidder Union.
'Voluntary ASSU'
But the Mocker-Friedman slate
charges that there's nothing Burke did
which he couldn't have done without
the title of ASSU Senator.
Burke feels differently. "In my
Tresidder report, being the head of an
ASSU committee allowed me to
burrow in and get information I
couldn't have gotten otherwise. It also
drew more attention to the problems
than if I had merely been a concerned
student. I think if you have organized
student interests you get a lot farther."
"I've always been attracted by the
philosophy of libertarianism," says
Burke. He even confesses he was an
"Ayn Rand freak" in high school.
"But I think it's unrealistic to
expect that on sheer altruism people
are going to devote the time and
energy necessary to work on these
problems.
Concern Not Enough
"I probably wouldn't have spent so
much time on Tresidder as an
individually concerned student, but I
felt I had to pay back those who voted
me into office and do something."
Appel also sees the task forces as
possibly getting credit from SWOPSI
or SCIRE.

Appel himself got three units from
a business school professor last year to
investigate Tresidder Drug Store busi
ness practices which turned out to be
somewhat less than satisfactory.
"The professor had me mark cans
of hairspray to see how fast the
inventory was turning over," he
recalls. "Well, after a year and a half
some of those cans are still sitting
there."
'That's only one example of areas
in the University which are falling
asleep and where task forces could
help," says Appel.
Qualifications
As for the Barber-Fay-Cortez slate,
Burke says,"I was surprised that they
put varsity soccer and golf as qualifi
cations for the office.
"I think it's fine to get involved in
things like that and it shows that
they're well-rounded people, but it
seems they're trying to imitate Pat C.
Shea (a former ASSU President who is
primarily remembered for his surf
ing)."
"You can't be an auxiliary to the
administration if you want to repre
sent student interests," concludes
Burke, "you have to have some
background of speaking up to the
University."
Burke is a junior in philosophy;
Wong, a junior in anthropology;
Appel, a coterminal student in history;
and Van Patten a sophomore in
political science.
All have served on numerous
University and ASSU committees.
Chris Hocker and Robin Friedman's
platform has changed little since last
year when the two lost the ASSU
presidency by only 180 votes.
"The ASSU should be a voluntary
organization," says Hocker. "If you
have a voluntary organization, the
organization has to prove itself worthy
of membership and not just sit there

on its ass."
Hocker claims that this year's
Council of Presidents has further
supported his position that the ASSU
as currently constituted is "really
bullshit."
Friedman puts the issue more
philosophically. "People are meant to
be free," she says,"and therefore you
shouldn't be forced to be the member

of an organization which has someone
trying to get into law school at its
head making statements for you and
telling you what to think."

Presidential Slate

Hocker feels the majority of people
at Stanford probably don't care about
the ASSU. "I personally dislike cam
paigning," he says, "because I always
feel I'm annoying people with some
thing they don't eare about, which is
probably true."
Hocker says he and Robin didn't do
much campaigning last year and that
they were generally "shocked" at how
well they did.
But Hocker feels it was his political
conservatism which in the end was
responsible for his losing. He points to
the fact that he and Robin were the
only candidates campaigning for no
