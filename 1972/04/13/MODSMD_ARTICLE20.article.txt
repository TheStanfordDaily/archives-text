# Bad Adaptation Of Moliere
## 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
Moliere must be turning over in his grave after the Stanford Drama
Department's presentation of his play, The Doctor In Spite of
Himself.
The production might be better called a burlesque based on the
play. Director Stephen Rosenfield and whoever translated and
adapted the script succeeded in turning a brilliant satire into a Punch
and Judy show.
The basic plot was the same as in the original. Sganarelle, a
woodcutter, poses as a doctor hired to cure Geronte's daughter,
Lucinde, who has suddenly gone dump. It turns out that her silence is
due to her father's refusal for her to marry her lover Leandre. The
situations and characterizations that occur before, during, and after
the discovery provide for refined satire and a few slapstick interludes.
The finesse that characterizes Moliere's work was totally absent.
All the characters except one were turned from parodies of French
society to all-American caricatures.
Gross Caricatures
The role of the doctor's wife, Martine, played by Mary Leydon,
was transformed into a screaming Brooklyn housewife who would
have been more at home on "The Honeymooners" than in a parlor
comedy.
Miss Leyden dressed to fit the part. She spent most of her time in
typical "bitchy housewife" clothes, a pink quilted bathrobe, pink
fuzzy slippers, and a head of curlers. The pitch of her voice never
went below 100 decibels. Even when she was supposed to be sneakily
calculating how to get back at her husband for beating her, her voice
remained at a deafening level.
The other lesser characters were also gross caricatures. Perhaps the
most annoying was Lucas, played by Michael Goldstein. Originally
Lucas was supposed to be a typical French peasant, a hopelessly
stupid yet comic character.
Goldstein played the part as a half-wit cowbody, swaggering and
drooling around doing an ineffective imitation of John Wayne and
Percy Kilbride. Luckily, Carolyn Gillespie, as his wife, made the
perfect mate for him. Loaded down with padding, Miss Gillespie
gawked around the stage with a grin on her face and a baby at her
breast, a true picture of Americana.
Overstated Roles
Of the other characters Moliere meant to be comical, the most
overexaggerated was Valere, Geronte's steward, played by Yorick
Wilks. At first, seeing someone play a soprano English faggot was
funny, but. after the first thirty seconds, the parody got boring.

Wilks tiptoed, giggled and clutched his horsey throughout most of
the play. He was dressed in a middy blouse and wide-brimmed hat. His
wrist was far too limp, his clutches at Lucas far too obvious. If
Moliere actually meant for Valere to be gay, as well as a sycophant, I
am sure he did not mean for him to be so overstated.
Moliere did not want the loversto be completely comic. Certainly,
Leandre is not the ideal romantic hero. He is a nervous young boy,
too caught up in love for Moliere's taste. Lucinde is supposed to be a
spoiled petulant child.
Kathy Hobson and John Caldwell overdid the roles. Mr. Caldwell
was the typical American boy, in the order of Penrod, except even
more naive. He smirked and goofed so much like Andy Hardy that I
expected him to say "Aw, shucks" at every available moment.
Miss Hobson played a perfect Nell Fenwick to his Dudley
Do-Right. When she finally got a chance to talk, she mixed the
spoiled-child chewing out of her father with a drunken flirting with
Leandre. Her mood changes were funny. The audience laughed
constantly. But she was not playing Moliere's heroine.
Good Acting Job
By far the best acting job was turned in by Wes Finlay, as
Sganarelle. He was the only character that came over as more than a
vaudeville put-on. Part of the reason he was good was that Moliere
made Sganarelle overly comic, a combination of slapstick and medical
satire.
Finley played the part with humor, but he didn't overdo it, if there
is any way to overdo that role.
The action fit the characters. Moliere's word play was replaced by
sight gags. Whenever they got the chance, the characters tripped each
other and landed prostrate on the floor, amid screeches, giggles, or
roars, depending on who tripped whom.
Informal Feeling
The set was negligible. There was a three-paneled poster board
backdrop with a scene on either side.To switch scenes, whoever was
on stage would flip the boards over by turning a lever in the center of
the stage.
I guess the idea behind the production was to promote a feeeling of
informality. The characters dressed on stage. Peter Silbert, who played
Geronte, introduced each actor at the start, using a few witty words
to describe each one. The characters laughed at each other's sight gags
and egged the audience on to do the same.
The audience responded. After all, for what it was, the play was
entertaining. As a slapstick farce it was funny. So if you want to see
reincarnated vaudeville, this is the play for you. But if you want to see
Moliere, I suggest you stay on the fourth floor of UGLY.
