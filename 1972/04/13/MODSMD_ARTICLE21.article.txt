# Successful 'Love's Labours'
## 
### DOUG ARTHUR 
Every so often I see a play with
such an aesthetically excellent
production that it seems to make
enduring all the other ones
worthwhile. Just such a
production of Shakespeare's
Love's Labour's Lost is currently
gracing the stage of the Berkeley
Repertory Theatre. Given the
caliber of the show, the minor
directorial faults are hardly worth
mentioning.
The comic situation revolves
around Ferdinand, the King of
Navarre, who, along with three
lords, determines to establish an
intellectual academy where they
will study (or three years. To this
end, they sign an oath forswearing
vain delights and the company of
women in favor of the intellect.
The "scholars" realize that their
decision was too hasty when the
Princess of France, and her ladies,
visit the coujt.
The women have little trouble
humiliating the men and their
academic pretensions. The humor
accrues from the labor the lords
expend in order to win the love of
the ladies, especially a scene
where the lords woo them in
disguise as Muscovites. Just as love
appears to have been won, a
messenger brings news of the
Princess' father's death which
explains the loss, as the women
resolve to postpone love for
twelve months.
Shakespeare's play contains
some fascinating minor characters.
Outstanding in this cast was
Robert Mooney's Holofernes, the
schoolmaster. He wore a long
brown robe (when the lords
decide to be scholars, they too

adopt brown robes) and was
usually accompanied by the
somber curate. His learning
impressed all the other characters.
Scholarly Ingenuity
Robert Mooney's physical
stature — short and very heavy —
accentuated the humor of the
man, as did his mispronunciations
of English and Latin words. His
scholarly ingenuity is put to a
direct use in organizing the court
entertainment for the ladies
before they depart for France.
The open love of Costard, the
clown, for Jacquenetta, a country
wench, contrasted with that of
the lords and ladies with their
secret, and subtle machinations.
Saun Ellis as Jaquenetta managed
to create an interesting character
with a very small part. The
language of these lovers is quite
disparate from the wit of the
court, and when Costard attempts
some witty speech, it only causes
trouble.
Don Adriano de Armado, a
boastful soldier who is also
attracted to Jaquenetta,
burlesques the courtly love
tradition by employing its
conventions (such as writing love
sonnets) and generally confusing
things by doing so. His best scenes
were with Moth, his young page,
whose probing questions and wit
helped him set his course of
action.
Moth, as played by twelve year
old Matthew Goldsby, was the
most intriguing member of the
cast. At one point he invokes wit
to argue with his master, but he
needn't have bothered as his lines
are among the wittiest in the play.
His clever speech and rapid
delivery confirm that he is a
"most acute juvenile."
Rich Dialogue
The rhetorical game between
Don Adriano and Moth is
accompanied by dancing, and
many of the lines are chanted:
this accents the ritualistic
structure of the verbal contest.
Throughout the play, speech is
complemented by musical sounds,
many of them elemental.
Holofernes beats his spoon against
his blackboard when he chants in
Latin. Moth plays the flute, and
Costard strums his guitar. The
French ladies strike chimes to
indicate their emotions. John
Swakhammer did a splendid job
of integrating music into the
entire play: the many sounds

always added variety and richness
to the dialogue.
Angela Paton's competent
direction left little room for
improvement. The pacing of the
show sustained excitement, and
full use was made of every part of
the stage, in the center of a small
auditorium. The "scenery"
consisted of four cushions that
served a number of purposes;
everything else was suggested
bylighting. The absence of scenery
and props focussed interest upon
the actors.
Two partitions at the back of
the stage were constructed of
green strands and served to hidy
the lords for a humorous scene
when each lord, one at a time,
demonstrates his love pangs and
reads his love letters, while being
watched and heard by other lords
behind the partitions.
Great Excitement
The lords decide to break their
vow to the intellect and win over
the ladies. Each lord runs, often
while delivering lines, to begin the
conquest so that the entire
auditorium is filled with
excitement. Indeed, throughout
the play there is a great deal of
physical action, such as climbing
poles and ladders, running and
jumping.
The only quibble I have about
the direction is that in some
scenes, such as the confrontation
of the disguised lords with the
masked ladies, some characters
were hidden from sections of the
audience: more movement would
have alleviated this. This was the
only scene in which the entire
audience could not view all the
characters.
Angela Paton has been involved
in the professional theatre for
twenty six years which might
account for the excellence of the
direction in this production. She's
quite an asset for the Berkeley
Repertory, and the production is
well worth the trip.
