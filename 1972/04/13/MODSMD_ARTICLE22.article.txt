# Disappointing Van Cliburn Recital
## 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
Van Cliburn has perfected a
new technique. He has also lost
much of his old one. Last
Thursday night he gave a concert
at the San Francisco Opera House
which was, in many respects,
excellent, but in many others,
disappointing.
Cliburn opened the program
with two intermezzi, op. 118, by
Brahms. The first one, in A minor,
was unsatisfying. It is a bright
piece with many forte or near
forte chords that can show up the
vitality of the performer. Cliburn
used all the proper dynamics. His
technique in the runs that connect
the chord sections was precise,
but the piece lacked the intensity
and expression that formerly
characterized Cliburn in such
works.
The other intermezzo, in A
major, contained all if not more
of the expression that the first
one lacked.
The piece usually comes off
dramatically, with extended
crescendos building into strong
fortes. Cliburn took his time
building up the first section. He
had the crescendos, but they were
subdued, subtly hinting at a
climax instead of arriving at one.
Balanced Piece
Apparently, he was saving
himself. The first section
reappears at the end of the piece.
Here Cliburn let out all the stops.
His left hand arpeggios came out
more. He fooled around with the
tempo, using a slight rubato that
enhanced his more exaggerated
expressiveness. Yet, despite
dramatic tempo changes and
crescendos, he never lost control.
He juxtaposed his speed-up before
the end with a mild retard in the
last few measures to create a
perfectly balanced ending to a
perfectly balanced piece.
Cliburn followed up the
intermezzi with two rhapsodies by
Brahms. The performance of the
first, op. 79 No. 1 in B minor, in
part resembled the first
intermezzo in that the louder,
faster passages, although
technically precise, lacked
dynamism. The most unsatisfying
part was where there was a large
crescendo leading up to some
brilliant chords in the right hand.
The crescendo was there, but the
top chords didn't live up to the
promise. They sounded thin, as if
Clibum had given up on them
before he got there.
The middle part of the piece
was beautiful. Cliburn seems to
have developed a talent for getting
the most out of lyric passages.
His treble was very pure, like a
bell. He played off the tenor and
treble melodies with a
combination of skill and refined
expression. The passage was not
overly pathetic, as it can be, nor
was it beat-by-beat march-like, as
it might have been. Somehwere,
Cliburn achieved a compromise.
Lyric Abilities
The other rhapsody, No. 2 in C
minor, of the same opus, is a
familiar one. Usually the opening
theme is played thunderously, and
the second theme is performed
pathetically. Cliburn played the

work more slowly than usual. The
opening theme was playful, as if
he weren't taking it seriously.
He performed the secondary
theme of the opening section as if
it were a march. I do not think his
interpretation was justifiable; the
theme should be stealthy, not as
open as he played it. The pleading
theme was, however, excellent.
Cliburn achieved a pathos that
came close to exaggeration, but
luckily just missed. Here he let his
lyric abilities take over, and the
section was wonderful.
Cliburn's next selection was
Beethoven's Sonata in F Minor,
the "Appassionata". The
composition is made for Cliburn.
Since it is so fluid, he never really
has to arrive at a climax before
going on. It is technically taxing,
but Cliburn is quite up to it.
The second movement is rich
and stately, to the point of being
a little stiff. One need not have
the rich-chord dynamism Cliburn
has lost. The third movement is
mostly brilliant arpeggios
intersperesed with lyrical
romantic passages. In short, the
sonata contains all the elements
Cliburn is best at and none of
the ones he's bad at.
Accurate Arpeggios
Cliburn outdid himself. He
started quietly, following
Beethoven's markings and beats
precisely. He filled the first
movement with accurate arpeggios
that contained a world of feeling.
Sometimes they would build up,
promising a resolution that would
not come in a forte arrival; instead
it would come in a sudden,
ominously solemn section.
Sometimes they would sound
like "heavenly" harp arpeggions.
Cliburn made the most of the
recurring repeated notes in the
left hand, to make the audience
feel nervous, as if something
surprising were about to happen.
Then he burst into arpeggios
again. He never paused. There was
no need to arrive, and the
audience was not supposed to
catch its breath.
The second movement is full of
pompous chords, like some royal
procession. It is a good respite
after the troubled first movement.
Even Cliburn seemed relieved. He
relaxed the pained expression on
his face.
The series of variations that the
major theme undergoes are light
and classical in contrast to the
first movement. Cliburn delicately
played the clear runs. The
movement simultaneously exuded
pomp and lightness.
Romantic Passage
The second movement runs
into the third movement without
any pause. Herce, Cliburn didn't
even have to arrive at the end of
his chord. The movement starts
hinting at the subsequent
turbulence in a diminished chord
that reaches all the way up and
down the keyboard.
From there, Cliburn burst into
a brilliant run. His bass line was
excellent, ranging from
thunderous chords to playful
dotted rhythms. The right hand
took up the dotted theme in a
romantic passage which Cliburn

rubatoed as much as anyone
should. While the bass line
dissolved into busy arpegios,
Cliburn continued his melody
rubato in the treble.
The effect was incredible.
Cliburn used the passage to mix
the two contrasting styles of the
piece, romantic stateliness with an
underlying current of disturbance.
After intermission, Cliburn
started with the Ballade No. 4 in
F Minor, op. 52, by Chopin. It is
an excellent composition for
lyrical lines. Cliburn was at his
best. Again he had a singing treble
over an arpeggio bass. The treble
is mostly a single line, allowing for
maximum purity and expression.
Caressing Quality
The best section came early in
the piece, where the melody
ended each phrase with a leap
even higher up the keyboard.
Cliburn waited just long enough
before hitting his top notes. When
he did play them, it was with a
caressing quality, ideal for the
section.
Cliburn treated the major
melodic section as if it were an
aria. He emphasized his right hand
line. He subdued his left hand to
the point that it was there only to
accompany, not to compete.
When the audience had just gotten
used to only one line, Cliburn
paused for a fraction of a second
before going into a melody cum
light bass arpeggios that developed
into clear, crescendoing arpeggios
in both hands.
Again, Cliburn avoided having
to arrive at the top of a phrase.
The arpeggios built up, only to go
into a piano subito of peaceful
chords. Cliburn must have had fun
with the passage, which enabled
him to show off his strengths and
evade his weaknesses.
The second composition he
played was Chopin's Nocture in E
Major, op. 62 No. 2. It is a slow,
dreamy piece, so Cliburn didn't
get much of a chance to show off
his technical prowess, but it
provided an excellent occasion for
him to highlight his melodic
romantic ability.
Melodic Competition
The single treble line sings out
through most of the piece, except
during a few "feathery" arpeggios.
The bass line swells to disturb the
lyric treble. Cliburn focused on
the melodic competition. The
melodies swelled, trying to get the
better of each other, only to drop
off again. His bass line came out
rich and clear. Combined, the two
melodies created multi-colored
dynamics and expression.
Cliburn followed the Chopin
selections with three works by
Debussy. They are hard pieces to
end a concert with. The first, The
Etude No. 5 "Pour les Octaves,"
was dramatic but a little messy on
the top notes. The beginning is
poly-tonal and very striking. From
there, what melody there is
becomes light and bouncy, only
to go into an impressionistic blur
later on.
The piece is full of strange
syncopations and surprise passages
that, although they flow into each
other, have little obvious
connection. It did not enable

Cliburn to show off his
interpretative brilliance. His
technique and mastery of the
strange chords and arpeggios was
obvious, but he could add little of
himself to the piece.
The second Debussy, "La
Terrasse des Audiences au Clair de
Lune," allows for more freedom
of interpretation. Cliburn made
much of it sound even eerier than
usual, as if it came from an old
Lugosi film. He built up and
played with a lonely alto line that
developed into impressionistic
fuzz.
He tried to show up different,
contrasting chords in the second,
oriental sounding section. He used
a gentle rubato and a few dynamic
swells, which was about all the
leeway he had.
The third Debussy, "L'lle
Joyeuse," was fluttery, very
similar to the "Flight of the
Bumble-Bee," in the opening
measure. Cliburn could play more

with this one. He used varying
tones in the gentle chords that
followed to get a good
understated contrast.
His heavily-pedaled harp-like
runs led into a march that built to
a fanfare. Luckily, Cliburn was
assertive on the fanfare, though
from his earlier performance one
would not have expected him to
be. He hit the chords proudly, a
real contrast to what came before.
Cliburn received a
semi-standing ovation and played
four encores afterward. I was not
one of those standing. He did an
admirable job. His Beethoven was
brilliant. Some of his Brahms was
good. His Chopin, his specialty,
was predictably fine. His Debussy
was disappointing, not because of
Cliburn, but because of the
restrictions placed on him by the
music.
But, in general, I left the Opera
House with a lukewarm feeling.
Cliburn is good; he is not genius.

The third Debussy, "L'lle
Joyeuse," was fluttery, very
similar to the "Flight of the
Bumble-Bee," in the opening
measure. Cliburn could play more

with this one. He used varying
tones in the gentle chords that
followed to get a good
understated contrast.
His heavily-pedaled harp-like
runs led into a march that built to
a fanfare. Luckily, Cliburn was
assertive on the fanfare, though
from his earlier performance one
would not have expected him to
be. He hit the chords proudly, a
real contrast to what came before.
Cliburn received a
semi-standing ovation and played
four encores afterward. I was not
one of those standing. He did an
admirable job. His Beethoven was
brilliant. Some of his Brahms was
good. His Chopin, his specialty,
was predictably fine. His Debussy
was disappointing, not because of
Cliburn, but because of the
restrictions placed on him by the
music.
But, in general, I left the Opera
House with a lukewarm feeling.
Cliburn is good; he is not genius.

OPERA SINGER— Leontyne Price, shown above, presented a solo
recital last Sunday at the Opera House in San Francisco. Daily opera
critic Gary Schmidgall critiques her performance.
Van Cliburn has perfected a
new technique. He has also lost
much of his old one. Last
Thursday night he gave a concert
at the San Francisco Opera House
which was, in many respects,
excellent, but in many others,
disappointing.
Cliburn opened the program
with two intermezzi, op. 118, by
Brahms. The first one, in A minor,
was unsatisfying. It is a bright
piece with many forte or near
forte chords that can show up the
vitality of the performer. Cliburn
used all the proper dynamics. His
technique in the runs that connect
the chord sections was precise,
but the piece lacked the intensity
and expression that formerly
characterized Cliburn in such
works.
The other intermezzo, in A
major, contained all if not more
of the expression that the first
one lacked.
The piece usually comes off
dramatically, with extended
crescendos building into strong
fortes. Cliburn took his time
building up the first section. He
had the crescendos, but they were
subdued, subtly hinting at a
climax instead of arriving at one.
Balanced Piece
Apparently, he was saving
himself. The first section
reappears at the end of the piece.
Here Cliburn let out all the stops.
His left hand arpeggios came out
more. He fooled around with the
tempo, using a slight rubato that
enhanced his more exaggerated
expressiveness. Yet, despite
dramatic tempo changes and
crescendos, he never lost control.
He juxtaposed his speed-up before
the end with a mild retard in the
last few measures to create a
perfectly balanced ending to a
perfectly balanced piece.
Cliburn followed up the
intermezzi with two rhapsodies by
Brahms. The performance of the
first, op. 79 No. 1 in B minor, in
part resembled the first
intermezzo in that the louder,
faster passages, although
technically precise, lacked
dynamism. The most unsatisfying
part was where there was a large
crescendo leading up to some
brilliant chords in the right hand.
The crescendo was there, but the
top chords didn't live up to the
promise. They sounded thin, as if
Clibum had given up on them
before he got there.
The middle part of the piece
was beautiful. Cliburn seems to
have developed a talent for getting
the most out of lyric passages.
His treble was very pure, like a
bell. He played off the tenor and
treble melodies with a
combination of skill and refined
expression. The passage was not
overly pathetic, as it can be, nor
was it beat-by-beat march-like, as
it might have been. Somehwere,
Cliburn achieved a compromise.
Lyric Abilities
The other rhapsody, No. 2 in C
minor, of the same opus, is a
familiar one. Usually the opening
theme is played thunderously, and
the second theme is performed
pathetically. Cliburn played the

work more slowly than usual. The
opening theme was playful, as if
he weren't taking it seriously.
He performed the secondary
theme of the opening section as if
it were a march. I do not think his
interpretation was justifiable; the
theme should be stealthy, not as
open as he played it. The pleading
theme was, however, excellent.
Cliburn achieved a pathos that
came close to exaggeration, but
luckily just missed. Here he let his
lyric abilities take over, and the
section was wonderful.
Cliburn's next selection was
Beethoven's Sonata in F Minor,
the "Appassionata". The
composition is made for Cliburn.
Since it is so fluid, he never really
has to arrive at a climax before
going on. It is technically taxing,
but Cliburn is quite up to it.
The second movement is rich
and stately, to the point of being
a little stiff. One need not have
the rich-chord dynamism Cliburn
has lost. The third movement is
mostly brilliant arpeggios
intersperesed with lyrical
romantic passages. In short, the
sonata contains all the elements
Cliburn is best at and none of
the ones he's bad at.
Accurate Arpeggios
Cliburn outdid himself. He
started quietly, following
Beethoven's markings and beats
precisely. He filled the first
movement with accurate arpeggios
that contained a world of feeling.
Sometimes they would build up,
promising a resolution that would
not come in a forte arrival; instead
it would come in a sudden,
ominously solemn section.
Sometimes they would sound
like "heavenly" harp arpeggions.
Cliburn made the most of the
recurring repeated notes in the
left hand, to make the audience
feel nervous, as if something
surprising were about to happen.
Then he burst into arpeggios
again. He never paused. There was
no need to arrive, and the
audience was not supposed to
catch its breath.
The second movement is full of
pompous chords, like some royal
procession. It is a good respite
after the troubled first movement.
Even Cliburn seemed relieved. He
relaxed the pained expression on
his face.
The series of variations that the
major theme undergoes are light
and classical in contrast to the
first movement. Cliburn delicately
played the clear runs. The
movement simultaneously exuded
pomp and lightness.
Romantic Passage
The second movement runs
into the third movement without
any pause. Herce, Cliburn didn't
even have to arrive at the end of
his chord. The movement starts
hinting at the subsequent
turbulence in a diminished chord
that reaches all the way up and
down the keyboard.
From there, Cliburn burst into
a brilliant run. His bass line was
excellent, ranging from
thunderous chords to playful
dotted rhythms. The right hand
took up the dotted theme in a
romantic passage which Cliburn

rubatoed as much as anyone
should. While the bass line
dissolved into busy arpegios,
Cliburn continued his melody
rubato in the treble.
The effect was incredible.
Cliburn used the passage to mix
the two contrasting styles of the
piece, romantic stateliness with an
underlying current of disturbance.
After intermission, Cliburn
started with the Ballade No. 4 in
F Minor, op. 52, by Chopin. It is
an excellent composition for
lyrical lines. Cliburn was at his
best. Again he had a singing treble
over an arpeggio bass. The treble
is mostly a single line, allowing for
maximum purity and expression.
Caressing Quality
The best section came early in
the piece, where the melody
ended each phrase with a leap
even higher up the keyboard.
Cliburn waited just long enough
before hitting his top notes. When
he did play them, it was with a
caressing quality, ideal for the
section.
Cliburn treated the major
melodic section as if it were an
aria. He emphasized his right hand
line. He subdued his left hand to
the point that it was there only to
accompany, not to compete.
When the audience had just gotten
used to only one line, Cliburn
paused for a fraction of a second
before going into a melody cum
light bass arpeggios that developed
into clear, crescendoing arpeggios
in both hands.
Again, Cliburn avoided having
to arrive at the top of a phrase.
The arpeggios built up, only to go
into a piano subito of peaceful
chords. Cliburn must have had fun
with the passage, which enabled
him to show off his strengths and
evade his weaknesses.
The second composition he
played was Chopin's Nocture in E
Major, op. 62 No. 2. It is a slow,
dreamy piece, so Cliburn didn't
get much of a chance to show off
his technical prowess, but it
provided an excellent occasion for
him to highlight his melodic
romantic ability.
Melodic Competition
The single treble line sings out
through most of the piece, except
during a few "feathery" arpeggios.
The bass line swells to disturb the
lyric treble. Cliburn focused on
the melodic competition. The
melodies swelled, trying to get the
better of each other, only to drop
off again. His bass line came out
rich and clear. Combined, the two
melodies created multi-colored
dynamics and expression.
Cliburn followed the Chopin
selections with three works by
Debussy. They are hard pieces to
end a concert with. The first, The
Etude No. 5 "Pour les Octaves,"
was dramatic but a little messy on
the top notes. The beginning is
poly-tonal and very striking. From
there, what melody there is
becomes light and bouncy, only
to go into an impressionistic blur
later on.
The piece is full of strange
syncopations and surprise passages
that, although they flow into each
other, have little obvious
connection. It did not enable

Cliburn to show off his
interpretative brilliance. His
technique and mastery of the
strange chords and arpeggios was
obvious, but he could add little of
himself to the piece.
The second Debussy, "La
Terrasse des Audiences au Clair de
Lune," allows for more freedom
of interpretation. Cliburn made
much of it sound even eerier than
usual, as if it came from an old
Lugosi film. He built up and
played with a lonely alto line that
developed into impressionistic
fuzz.
He tried to show up different,
contrasting chords in the second,
oriental sounding section. He used
a gentle rubato and a few dynamic
swells, which was about all the
leeway he had.
The third Debussy, "L'lle
Joyeuse," was fluttery, very
similar to the "Flight of the
Bumble-Bee," in the opening
measure. Cliburn could play more

with this one. He used varying
tones in the gentle chords that

selections with three works by
Debussy. They are hard pieces to
end a concert with. The first, The
Etude No. 5 "Pour les Octaves,"
was dramatic but a little messy on
the top notes. The beginning is
poly-tonal and very striking. From
there, what melody there is
becomes light and bouncy, only
to go into an impressionistic blur
later on.
The piece is full of strange
syncopations and surprise passages
that, although they flow into each
other, have little obvious
connection. It did not enable

Cliburn to show off his
interpretative brilliance. His
technique and mastery of the
strange chords and arpeggios was
obvious, but he could add little of
himself to the piece.
The second Debussy, "La
Terrasse des Audiences au Clair de
Lune," allows for more freedom
of interpretation. Cliburn made
much of it sound even eerier than
usual, as if it came from an old
Lugosi film. He built up and
played with a lonely alto line that
developed into impressionistic
fuzz.
He tried to show up different,
contrasting chords in the second,
oriental sounding section. He used
a gentle rubato and a few dynamic
swells, which was about all the
leeway he had.
The third Debussy, "L'lle
Joyeuse," was fluttery, very
similar to the "Flight of the
Bumble-Bee," in the opening
measure. Cliburn could play more

with this one. He used varying
tones in the gentle chords that
followed to get a good
understated contrast.
His heavily-pedaled harp-like
runs led into a march that built to
a fanfare. Luckily, Cliburn was
assertive on the fanfare, though
from his earlier performance one
would not have expected him to
be. He hit the chords proudly, a
real contrast to what came before.
Cliburn received a
semi-standing ovation and played
four encores afterward. I was not
one of those standing. He did an
admirable job. His Beethoven was
brilliant. Some of his Brahms was
good. His Chopin, his specialty,
was predictably fine. His Debussy
was disappointing, not because of
Cliburn, but because of the
restrictions placed on him by the
music.
But, in general, I left the Opera
House with a lukewarm feeling.
Cliburn is good; he is not genius.

OPERA SINGER— Leontyne Price, shown above, presented a solo
recital last Sunday at the Opera House in San Francisco. Daily opera
critic Gary Schmidgall critiques her performance.
Van Cliburn has perfected a
new technique. He has also lost
much of his old one. Last
Thursday night he gave a concert
at the San Francisco Opera House
which was, in many respects,
excellent, but in many others,
disappointing.
Cliburn opened the program
with two intermezzi, op. 118, by
Brahms. The first one, in A minor,
was unsatisfying. It is a bright
piece with many forte or near
forte chords that can show up the
vitality of the performer. Cliburn
used all the proper dynamics. His
technique in the runs that connect
the chord sections was precise,
but the piece lacked the intensity
and expression that formerly
characterized Cliburn in such
works.
The other intermezzo, in A
major, contained all if not more
of the expression that the first
one lacked.
The piece usually comes off
dramatically, with extended
crescendos building into strong
fortes. Cliburn took his time
building up the first section. He
had the crescendos, but they were
subdued, subtly hinting at a
climax instead of arriving at one.
Balanced Piece
Apparently, he was saving
himself. The first section
reappears at the end of the piece.
Here Cliburn let out all the stops.
His left hand arpeggios came out
more. He fooled around with the
tempo, using a slight rubato that
enhanced his more exaggerated
expressiveness. Yet, despite
dramatic tempo changes and
crescendos, he never lost control.
He juxtaposed his speed-up before
the end with a mild retard in the
last few measures to create a
perfectly balanced ending to a
perfectly balanced piece.
Cliburn followed up the
intermezzi with two rhapsodies by
Brahms. The performance of the
first, op. 79 No. 1 in B minor, in
part resembled the first
intermezzo in that the louder,
faster passages, although
technically precise, lacked
dynamism. The most unsatisfying
part was where there was a large
crescendo leading up to some
brilliant chords in the right hand.
The crescendo was there, but the
top chords didn't live up to the
promise. They sounded thin, as if
Clibum had given up on them
before he got there.
The middle part of the piece
was beautiful. Cliburn seems to
have developed a talent for getting
the most out of lyric passages.
His treble was very pure, like a
bell. He played off the tenor and
treble melodies with a
combination of skill and refined
expression. The passage was not
overly pathetic, as it can be, nor
was it beat-by-beat march-like, as
it might have been. Somehwere,
Cliburn achieved a compromise.
Lyric Abilities
The other rhapsody, No. 2 in C
minor, of the same opus, is a
familiar one. Usually the opening
theme is played thunderously, and
the second theme is performed
pathetically. Cliburn played the

work more slowly than usual. The
opening theme was playful, as if
he weren't taking it seriously.
He performed the secondary
theme of the opening section as if
it were a march. I do not think his
interpretation was justifiable; the
theme should be stealthy, not as
open as he played it. The pleading
theme was, however, excellent.
Cliburn achieved a pathos that
came close to exaggeration, but
luckily just missed. Here he let his
lyric abilities take over, and the
section was wonderful.
Cliburn's next selection was
Beethoven's Sonata in F Minor,
the "Appassionata". The
composition is made for Cliburn.
Since it is so fluid, he never really
has to arrive at a climax before
going on. It is technically taxing,
but Cliburn is quite up to it.
The second movement is rich
and stately, to the point of being
a little stiff. One need not have
the rich-chord dynamism Cliburn
has lost. The third movement is
mostly brilliant arpeggios
intersperesed with lyrical
romantic passages. In short, the
sonata contains all the elements
Cliburn is best at and none of
the ones he's bad at.
Accurate Arpeggios
Cliburn outdid himself. He
started quietly, following
Beethoven's markings and beats
precisely. He filled the first
movement with accurate arpeggios
that contained a world of feeling.
Sometimes they would build up,
promising a resolution that would
not come in a forte arrival; instead
it would come in a sudden,
ominously solemn section.
Sometimes they would sound
like "heavenly" harp arpeggions.
Cliburn made the most of the
recurring repeated notes in the
left hand, to make the audience
feel nervous, as if something
surprising were about to happen.
Then he burst into arpeggios
again. He never paused. There was
no need to arrive, and the
audience was not supposed to
catch its breath.
The second movement is full of
pompous chords, like some royal
procession. It is a good respite
after the troubled first movement.
Even Cliburn seemed relieved. He
relaxed the pained expression on
his face.
The series of variations that the
major theme undergoes are light
and classical in contrast to the
first movement. Cliburn delicately
played the clear runs. The
movement simultaneously exuded
pomp and lightness.
Romantic Passage
The second movement runs
into the third movement without
any pause. Herce, Cliburn didn't
even have to arrive at the end of
his chord. The movement starts
hinting at the subsequent
turbulence in a diminished chord
that reaches all the way up and
down the keyboard.
From there, Cliburn burst into
a brilliant run. His bass line was
excellent, ranging from
thunderous chords to playful
dotted rhythms. The right hand
took up the dotted theme in a
romantic passage which Cliburn

rubatoed as much as anyone
should. While the bass line
dissolved into busy arpegios,
Cliburn continued his melody
rubato in the treble.
The effect was incredible.
Cliburn used the passage to mix
the two contrasting styles of the
piece, romantic stateliness with an
underlying current of disturbance.
After intermission, Cliburn
started with the Ballade No. 4 in
F Minor, op. 52, by Chopin. It is
an excellent composition for
lyrical lines. Cliburn was at his
best. Again he had a singing treble
over an arpeggio bass. The treble
is mostly a single line, allowing for
maximum purity and expression.
Caressing Quality
The best section came early in
the piece, where the melody
ended each phrase with a leap
even higher up the keyboard.
Cliburn waited just long enough
before hitting his top notes. When
he did play them, it was with a
caressing quality, ideal for the
section.
Cliburn treated the major
melodic section as if it were an
aria. He emphasized his right hand
line. He subdued his left hand to
the point that it was there only to
accompany, not to compete.
When the audience had just gotten
used to only one line, Cliburn
paused for a fraction of a second
before going into a melody cum
light bass arpeggios that developed
into clear, crescendoing arpeggios
in both hands.
Again, Cliburn avoided having
to arrive at the top of a phrase.
The arpeggios built up, only to go
into a piano subito of peaceful
chords. Cliburn must have had fun
with the passage, which enabled
him to show off his strengths and
evade his weaknesses.
The second composition he
played was Chopin's Nocture in E
Major, op. 62 No. 2. It is a slow,
dreamy piece, so Cliburn didn't
get much of a chance to show off
his technical prowess, but it
provided an excellent occasion for
him to highlight his melodic
romantic ability.
Melodic Competition
The single treble line sings out
through most of the piece, except
during a few "feathery" arpeggios.
The bass line swells to disturb the
lyric treble. Cliburn focused on
the melodic competition. The
melodies swelled, trying to get the
better of each other, only to drop
off again. His bass line came out
rich and clear. Combined, the two
melodies created multi-colored
dynamics and expression.
Cliburn followed the Chopin
selections with three works by
Debussy. They are hard pieces to
end a concert with. The first, The
Etude No. 5 "Pour les Octaves,"

paused for a fraction of a second
before going into a melody cum
light bass arpeggios that developed
into clear, crescendoing arpeggios
in both hands.
Again, Cliburn avoided having
to arrive at the top of a phrase.
The arpeggios built up, only to go
into a piano subito of peaceful
chords. Cliburn must have had fun
with the passage, which enabled
him to show off his strengths and
evade his weaknesses.
The second composition he
played was Chopin's Nocture in E
Major, op. 62 No. 2. It is a slow,
dreamy piece, so Cliburn didn't
get much of a chance to show off
his technical prowess, but it
provided an excellent occasion for
him to highlight his melodic
romantic ability.
Melodic Competition
The single treble line sings out
through most of the piece, except
during a few "feathery" arpeggios.
The bass line swells to disturb the
lyric treble. Cliburn focused on
the melodic competition. The
melodies swelled, trying to get the
better of each other, only to drop
off again. His bass line came out
rich and clear. Combined, the two
melodies created multi-colored
dynamics and expression.
Cliburn followed the Chopin
selections with three works by
Debussy. They are hard pieces to
end a concert with. The first, The
Etude No. 5 "Pour les Octaves,"
was dramatic but a little messy on
the top notes. The beginning is
poly-tonal and very striking. From
there, what melody there is
becomes light and bouncy, only
to go into an impressionistic blur
later on.
The piece is full of strange
syncopations and surprise passages
that, although they flow into each
other, have little obvious
connection. It did not enable

Cliburn to show off his
interpretative brilliance. His
technique and mastery of the
strange chords and arpeggios was
obvious, but he could add little of
himself to the piece.
The second Debussy, "La
Terrasse des Audiences au Clair de
Lune," allows for more freedom
of interpretation. Cliburn made
much of it sound even eerier than
usual, as if it came from an old
Lugosi film. He built up and
played with a lonely alto line that
developed into impressionistic
fuzz.
He tried to show up different,
contrasting chords in the second,
oriental sounding section. He used
a gentle rubato and a few dynamic
swells, which was about all the
leeway he had.
The third Debussy, "L'lle
Joyeuse," was fluttery, very
similar to the "Flight of the
Bumble-Bee," in the opening
measure. Cliburn could play more

with this one. He used varying
tones in the gentle chords that
followed to get a good
understated contrast.
His heavily-pedaled harp-like
runs led into a march that built to
a fanfare. Luckily, Cliburn was
assertive on the fanfare, though
from his earlier performance one
would not have expected him to
be. He hit the chords proudly, a
real contrast to what came before.
Cliburn received a
semi-standing ovation and played
four encores afterward. I was not
one of those standing. He did an
admirable job. His Beethoven was
brilliant. Some of his Brahms was
good. His Chopin, his specialty,
was predictably fine. His Debussy
was disappointing, not because of
Cliburn, but because of the
restrictions placed on him by the
music.
But, in general, I left the Opera
House with a lukewarm feeling.
Cliburn is good; he is not genius.

OPERA SINGER— Leontyne Price, shown above, presented a solo
recital last Sunday at the Opera House in San Francisco. Daily opera
critic Gary Schmidgall critiques her performance.
Van Cliburn has perfected a
new technique. He has also lost
much of his old one. Last
Thursday night he gave a concert
at the San Francisco Opera House
which was, in many respects,
excellent, but in many others,
disappointing.
Cliburn opened the program
with two intermezzi, op. 118, by
Brahms. The first one, in A minor,
was unsatisfying. It is a bright
piece with many forte or near
forte chords that can show up the
vitality of the performer. Cliburn
used all the proper dynamics. His
technique in the runs that connect
the chord sections was precise,
but the piece lacked the intensity
and expression that formerly
characterized Cliburn in such
works.
The other intermezzo, in A
major, contained all if not more
of the expression that the first
one lacked.
The piece usually comes off
dramatically, with extended
crescendos building into strong
fortes. Cliburn took his time
building up the first section. He
had the crescendos, but they were
subdued, subtly hinting at a
climax instead of arriving at one.
Balanced Piece
Apparently, he was saving
himself. The first section
reappears at the end of the piece.
Here Cliburn let out all the stops.
His left hand arpeggios came out
more. He fooled around with the
tempo, using a slight rubato that
enhanced his more exaggerated
expressiveness. Yet, despite
dramatic tempo changes and
crescendos, he never lost control.
He juxtaposed his speed-up before
the end with a mild retard in the
last few measures to create a
perfectly balanced ending to a
perfectly balanced piece.
Cliburn followed up the
intermezzi with two rhapsodies by
Brahms. The performance of the
first, op. 79 No. 1 in B minor, in
part resembled the first
intermezzo in that the louder,
faster passages, although
technically precise, lacked
dynamism. The most unsatisfying
part was where there was a large
crescendo leading up to some
brilliant chords in the right hand.
The crescendo was there, but the
top chords didn't live up to the
promise. They sounded thin, as if
Clibum had given up on them
before he got there.
The middle part of the piece
was beautiful. Cliburn seems to
have developed a talent for getting
the most out of lyric passages.
His treble was very pure, like a
bell. He played off the tenor and
treble melodies with a
combination of skill and refined
expression. The passage was not
overly pathetic, as it can be, nor
was it beat-by-beat march-like, as
it might have been. Somehwere,
Cliburn achieved a compromise.
Lyric Abilities
The other rhapsody, No. 2 in C
minor, of the same opus, is a
familiar one. Usually the opening
theme is played thunderously, and
the second theme is performed
pathetically. Cliburn played the

work more slowly than usual. The
opening theme was playful, as if
he weren't taking it seriously.
He performed the secondary
theme of the opening section as if
it were a march. I do not think his
interpretation was justifiable; the
theme should be stealthy, not as
open as he played it. The pleading
theme was, however, excellent.
Cliburn achieved a pathos that
came close to exaggeration, but
luckily just missed. Here he let his
lyric abilities take over, and the
section was wonderful.
Cliburn's next selection was
Beethoven's Sonata in F Minor,
the "Appassionata". The
composition is made for Cliburn.
Since it is so fluid, he never really
has to arrive at a climax before
going on. It is technically taxing,
but Cliburn is quite up to it.
The second movement is rich
and stately, to the point of being
a little stiff. One need not have
the rich-chord dynamism Cliburn
has lost. The third movement is
mostly brilliant arpeggios
intersperesed with lyrical
romantic passages. In short, the
sonata contains all the elements
Cliburn is best at and none of
the ones he's bad at.
Accurate Arpeggios
Cliburn outdid himself. He
started quietly, following
Beethoven's markings and beats
precisely. He filled the first
movement with accurate arpeggios
that contained a world of feeling.
Sometimes they would build up,
promising a resolution that would
not come in a forte arrival; instead
it would come in a sudden,
ominously solemn section.
Sometimes they would sound
like "heavenly" harp arpeggions.
Cliburn made the most of the
recurring repeated notes in the
left hand, to make the audience
feel nervous, as if something
surprising were about to happen.
Then he burst into arpeggios
again. He never paused. There was
no need to arrive, and the
audience was not supposed to
catch its breath.
The second movement is full of
pompous chords, like some royal
procession. It is a good respite
after the troubled first movement.
Even Cliburn seemed relieved. He
relaxed the pained expression on
his face.
The series of variations that the
major theme undergoes are light
and classical in contrast to the
first movement. Cliburn delicately
played the clear runs. The
movement simultaneously exuded
pomp and lightness.
Romantic Passage
The second movement runs
into the third movement without
any pause. Herce, Cliburn didn't
even have to arrive at the end of
his chord. The movement starts
hinting at the subsequent
turbulence in a diminished chord
that reaches all the way up and
down the keyboard.
From there, Cliburn burst into
a brilliant run. His bass line was
excellent, ranging from
thunderous chords to playful
dotted rhythms. The right hand
took up the dotted theme in a
romantic passage which Cliburn

rubatoed as much as anyone
should. While the bass line
dissolved into busy arpegios,
Cliburn continued his melody
rubato in the treble.
The effect was incredible.
Cliburn used the passage to mix
the two contrasting styles of the
piece, romantic stateliness with an
underlying current of disturbance.
After intermission, Cliburn
started with the Ballade No. 4 in
F Minor, op. 52, by Chopin. It is
an excellent composition for
lyrical lines. Cliburn was at his
best. Again he had a singing treble
over an arpeggio bass. The treble
is mostly a single line, allowing for
maximum purity and expression.
Caressing Quality
The best section came early in
the piece, where the melody
ended each phrase with a leap
even higher up the keyboard.
Cliburn waited just long enough
before hitting his top notes. When
he did play them, it was with a
caressing quality, ideal for the
section.
Cliburn treated the major
melodic section as if it were an
aria. He emphasized his right hand
line. He subdued his left hand to
the point that it was there only to
accompany, not to compete.
When the audience had just gotten
used to only one line, Cliburn
paused for a fraction of a second
before going into a melody cum
light bass arpeggios that developed
into clear, crescendoing arpeggios
in both hands.
Again, Cliburn avoided having

rubatoed as much as anyone
should. While the bass line
dissolved into busy arpegios,
Cliburn continued his melody
rubato in the treble.
The effect was incredible.
Cliburn used the passage to mix
the two contrasting styles of the
piece, romantic stateliness with an
underlying current of disturbance.
After intermission, Cliburn
started with the Ballade No. 4 in
F Minor, op. 52, by Chopin. It is
an excellent composition for
lyrical lines. Cliburn was at his
best. Again he had a singing treble
over an arpeggio bass. The treble
is mostly a single line, allowing for
maximum purity and expression.
Caressing Quality
The best section came early in
the piece, where the melody
ended each phrase with a leap
even higher up the keyboard.
Cliburn waited just long enough
before hitting his top notes. When
he did play them, it was with a
caressing quality, ideal for the
section.
Cliburn treated the major
melodic section as if it were an
aria. He emphasized his right hand
line. He subdued his left hand to
the point that it was there only to
accompany, not to compete.
When the audience had just gotten
used to only one line, Cliburn
paused for a fraction of a second
before going into a melody cum
light bass arpeggios that developed
into clear, crescendoing arpeggios
in both hands.
Again, Cliburn avoided having
to arrive at the top of a phrase.
The arpeggios built up, only to go
into a piano subito of peaceful
chords. Cliburn must have had fun
with the passage, which enabled
him to show off his strengths and
evade his weaknesses.
The second composition he
played was Chopin's Nocture in E
Major, op. 62 No. 2. It is a slow,
dreamy piece, so Cliburn didn't
get much of a chance to show off
his technical prowess, but it
provided an excellent occasion for
him to highlight his melodic
romantic ability.
Melodic Competition
The single treble line sings out
through most of the piece, except
during a few "feathery" arpeggios.
The bass line swells to disturb the
lyric treble. Cliburn focused on
the melodic competition. The
melodies swelled, trying to get the
better of each other, only to drop
off again. His bass line came out
rich and clear. Combined, the two
melodies created multi-colored
dynamics and expression.
Cliburn followed the Chopin
selections with three works by
Debussy. They are hard pieces to
end a concert with. The first, The
Etude No. 5 "Pour les Octaves,"
was dramatic but a little messy on
the top notes. The beginning is
poly-tonal and very striking. From
there, what melody there is
becomes light and bouncy, only
to go into an impressionistic blur
later on.
The piece is full of strange
syncopations and surprise passages
that, although they flow into each
other, have little obvious
connection. It did not enable

Cliburn to show off his
interpretative brilliance. His
technique and mastery of the
strange chords and arpeggios was
obvious, but he could add little of
himself to the piece.
The second Debussy, "La
Terrasse des Audiences au Clair de
Lune," allows for more freedom
of interpretation. Cliburn made
much of it sound even eerier than
usual, as if it came from an old
Lugosi film. He built up and
played with a lonely alto line that
developed into impressionistic
fuzz.
He tried to show up different,
contrasting chords in the second,
oriental sounding section. He used
a gentle rubato and a few dynamic
swells, which was about all the
leeway he had.
The third Debussy, "L'lle
Joyeuse," was fluttery, very
similar to the "Flight of the
Bumble-Bee," in the opening
measure. Cliburn could play more

with this one. He used varying
tones in the gentle chords that
followed to get a good
understated contrast.
His heavily-pedaled harp-like
runs led into a march that built to
a fanfare. Luckily, Cliburn was
assertive on the fanfare, though
from his earlier performance one
would not have expected him to
be. He hit the chords proudly, a
real contrast to what came before.
Cliburn received a
semi-standing ovation and played
four encores afterward. I was not
one of those standing. He did an
admirable job. His Beethoven was
brilliant. Some of his Brahms was
good. His Chopin, his specialty,
was predictably fine. His Debussy
was disappointing, not because of
Cliburn, but because of the
restrictions placed on him by the
music.
But, in general, I left the Opera
House with a lukewarm feeling.
Cliburn is good; he is not genius.

OPERA SINGER— Leontyne Price, shown above, presented a solo
recital last Sunday at the Opera House in San Francisco. Daily opera
critic Gary Schmidgall critiques her performance.
Van Cliburn has perfected a
new technique. He has also lost
much of his old one. Last
Thursday night he gave a concert
at the San Francisco Opera House
which was, in many respects,
excellent, but in many others,
disappointing.
Cliburn opened the program
with two intermezzi, op. 118, by
Brahms. The first one, in A minor,
was unsatisfying. It is a bright
piece with many forte or near
forte chords that can show up the
vitality of the performer. Cliburn
used all the proper dynamics. His
technique in the runs that connect
the chord sections was precise,
but the piece lacked the intensity
and expression that formerly
characterized Cliburn in such
works.
The other intermezzo, in A
major, contained all if not more
of the expression that the first
one lacked.
The piece usually comes off
dramatically, with extended
crescendos building into strong
fortes. Cliburn took his time
building up the first section. He
had the crescendos, but they were
subdued, subtly hinting at a
climax instead of arriving at one.
Balanced Piece
Apparently, he was saving
himself. The first section
reappears at the end of the piece.
Here Cliburn let out all the stops.
His left hand arpeggios came out
more. He fooled around with the
tempo, using a slight rubato that
enhanced his more exaggerated
expressiveness. Yet, despite
dramatic tempo changes and
crescendos, he never lost control.
He juxtaposed his speed-up before
the end with a mild retard in the
last few measures to create a
perfectly balanced ending to a
perfectly balanced piece.
Cliburn followed up the
intermezzi with two rhapsodies by
Brahms. The performance of the
first, op. 79 No. 1 in B minor, in
part resembled the first
intermezzo in that the louder,
faster passages, although
technically precise, lacked
dynamism. The most unsatisfying
part was where there was a large
crescendo leading up to some
brilliant chords in the right hand.
The crescendo was there, but the
top chords didn't live up to the
promise. They sounded thin, as if
Clibum had given up on them
before he got there.
The middle part of the piece
was beautiful. Cliburn seems to
have developed a talent for getting
the most out of lyric passages.
His treble was very pure, like a
bell. He played off the tenor and
treble melodies with a
combination of skill and refined
expression. The passage was not
overly pathetic, as it can be, nor
was it beat-by-beat march-like, as
it might have been. Somehwere,
Cliburn achieved a compromise.
Lyric Abilities
The other rhapsody, No. 2 in C
minor, of the same opus, is a
familiar one. Usually the opening
theme is played thunderously, and
the second theme is performed
pathetically. Cliburn played the

work more slowly than usual. The
opening theme was playful, as if
he weren't taking it seriously.
He performed the secondary
theme of the opening section as if
it were a march. I do not think his
interpretation was justifiable; the
theme should be stealthy, not as
open as he played it. The pleading
theme was, however, excellent.
Cliburn achieved a pathos that
came close to exaggeration, but
luckily just missed. Here he let his
lyric abilities take over, and the
section was wonderful.
Cliburn's next selection was
Beethoven's Sonata in F Minor,
the "Appassionata". The
composition is made for Cliburn.
Since it is so fluid, he never really
has to arrive at a climax before
going on. It is technically taxing,
but Cliburn is quite up to it.
The second movement is rich
and stately, to the point of being
a little stiff. One need not have
the rich-chord dynamism Cliburn
has lost. The third movement is
mostly brilliant arpeggios
intersperesed with lyrical
romantic passages. In short, the
sonata contains all the elements
Cliburn is best at and none of
the ones he's bad at.
Accurate Arpeggios
Cliburn outdid himself. He
started quietly, following
Beethoven's markings and beats
precisely. He filled the first
movement with accurate arpeggios
that contained a world of feeling.
Sometimes they would build up,
promising a resolution that would
not come in a forte arrival; instead
it would come in a sudden,
ominously solemn section.
Sometimes they would sound
like "heavenly" harp arpeggions.
Cliburn made the most of the
recurring repeated notes in the
left hand, to make the audience
feel nervous, as if something
surprising were about to happen.
Then he burst into arpeggios
again. He never paused. There was
no need to arrive, and the
audience was not supposed to
catch its breath.
The second movement is full of
pompous chords, like some royal
procession. It is a good respite
after the troubled first movement.
Even Cliburn seemed relieved. He
relaxed the pained expression on
his face.
The series of variations that the
major theme undergoes are light
and classical in contrast to the
first movement. Cliburn delicately
played the clear runs. The
movement simultaneously exuded
pomp and lightness.
Romantic Passage
The second movement runs
into the third movement without
any pause. Herce, Cliburn didn't
even have to arrive at the end of
his chord. The movement starts
hinting at the subsequent
turbulence in a diminished chord
that reaches all the way up and
down the keyboard.
From there, Cliburn burst into
a brilliant run. His bass line was
excellent, ranging from
thunderous chords to playful
dotted rhythms. The right hand
took up the dotted theme in a
romantic passage which Cliburn

rubatoed as much as anyone
should. While the bass line
dissolved into busy arpegios,
Cliburn continued his melody
rubato in the treble.
The effect was incredible.
