# Dry Leontyne Price Concert
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
Leontyne Price's recital at the
Opera House Sunday evening
really began to gain momentum
after it was all over. After sitting
placidly and politely through a
rather dry series of art-songs, the
audience fairly leapt for joy when
Leontyne broke down and sang
two operatic encores. Too bad,
for the audience was obviously all
set to run amuck for her. As it
was, the two arias — one from
Adriana Lecouvreur, the other
Doretta's dream song from
Puccini's Im Rondine — were the
night's best offerings. Here was
the Price we know and admire:
mellow, powerfully arching,
emotionally effusive vocalism.
But the price paid by the
audience for these lovely arias was
high. I suppose it is ungenerous to
criticize a fine operatic soprano
for wishing to get away from her
usual fare and choose
non-operatic items. On the other
hand, the audience is only human;
it wants the genuine article, which
it knows is the operatic Price. So
as it turned out, the recital was a
lengthy matter of "Who is kidding
Whom?" At the least, I would lay
it down as a rule never to be
transgressed that operatic
recitalists should program at least
one section of opera. Simple.
The program itself ranged from
the ill-advised, to the exquisite, to
the interesting (in the arrid
intellectual sense), to the empty.
Sometimes Price and her
selections met on the same
ground; sometimes they didn't.
Most vocal recitalists start off
with a thinly disguised
throat-warmer. Not Price, who
launched directly into
Beethoven's murderous concert
aria "Ah perfido."The result was,
if not murder, assault and battery.
Price tore through the aria like a
bull in a china-shop (if
Beethoven's ponderous piece can
be so described) with virtually no
emotional engagement and little
of the necessary agility required at

certain points. It made the long
aria seem even longer.
Perfect Harmony
Price found herself in perfect
harmony, however, with five
songs by Richard Strauss. His
songs invariably have clever
musical underpinnings and lively
emotion, and Price gave them a
sharp-witted and vocally incisive
run-through in excellently sung
German.
The quintet of Respighi songs
which followed contained little to
recommend them. The insipid
music and the more than usually
silly texts led inevitably to dull
impressions.
A group of delightful Poulenc
songs opened the second half. Had
they been programmed in less
muted company they would have
made a striking impression.
Poulenc's wonderful songs are sly,
parched, simple, and witty — all
marks of the Satie-dominated
French composers of the twenties.
And though a lighter voice and a
more French touch would have
improved them, Price still made
them ingratiating.
The spirituals which came next
hardly lit any fires. Price failed t»
retrieve "He's got the Whole
World in His Hands" from the
odium of best-sellerdom, though
she did give three Psalm settings
some interest — especially Robert

Starer's rhythmically involved
setting of Psalm 31.
Though pianist David Garvey
proved a consistently mercurial
and elegant accompanist,
Leotyne's recital never seemed to
ignite as it should have. Perhaps
her program had too many valleys
and not enough hills. Or perhaps
her Turandot-like aloofness was to
blame (though she did smile
briefly in discomposure when a
fan shouted "We love you.").
Even for such as Leontype Price, I
thought the prima donna-ish
condescension was a bit overdone.
The net effect of the recital
was to suggest Price's vocal
hallmarks — both good and bad —
have not been affected by her
drastic reduction in vocal activity
over the last few years. Her
strength is in the long vocal line,
in the middle two-thirds of her
register, and in a rich full-bodied
tone. Nor have her weaknesses
found a way of disappearing:
occasional huskiness in chest
tones, a lumbering unwieldiness in
tricky passages (noted in the
Beethoven aria especially), and a
maddening tendency to drop all
pretext of emotional
commitment. Still and all, when
Price hits her stride she is beyond
praise — as the happily unhinged
crowd demonstrated after the
encores.

high. I suppose it is ungenerous to
criticize a fine operatic soprano
for wishing to get away from her
usual fare and choose
non-operatic items. On the other
hand, the audience is only human;
it wants the genuine article, which
it knows is the operatic Price. So
as it turned out, the recital was a
lengthy matter of "Who is kidding
Whom?" At the least, I would lay
it down as a rule never to be
transgressed that operatic
recitalists should program at least
one section of opera. Simple.
The program itself ranged from
the ill-advised, to the exquisite, to
the interesting (in the arrid
intellectual sense), to the empty.
Sometimes Price and her
selections met on the same
ground; sometimes they didn't.
Most vocal recitalists start off
with a thinly disguised
throat-warmer. Not Price, who
launched directly into
Beethoven's murderous concert
aria "Ah perfido."The result was,
if not murder, assault and battery.
Price tore through the aria like a
bull in a china-shop (if
Beethoven's ponderous piece can
be so described) with virtually no
emotional engagement and little
of the necessary agility required at

certain points. It made the long
aria seem even longer.
Perfect Harmony
Price found herself in perfect
harmony, however, with five
songs by Richard Strauss. His
songs invariably have clever
musical underpinnings and lively
emotion, and Price gave them a
sharp-witted and vocally incisive
run-through in excellently sung
German.
The quintet of Respighi songs
which followed contained little to
recommend them. The insipid
music and the more than usually
silly texts led inevitably to dull
impressions.
A group of delightful Poulenc
songs opened the second half. Had
they been programmed in less
muted company they would have
made a striking impression.
Poulenc's wonderful songs are sly,
parched, simple, and witty — all
marks of the Satie-dominated
French composers of the twenties.
And though a lighter voice and a
more French touch would have
improved them, Price still made
them ingratiating.
The spirituals which came next
hardly lit any fires. Price failed t»
retrieve "He's got the Whole
World in His Hands" from the
odium of best-sellerdom, though
she did give three Psalm settings
some interest — especially Robert

Starer's rhythmically involved
setting of Psalm 31.
Though pianist David Garvey
proved a consistently mercurial
and elegant accompanist,
Leotyne's recital never seemed to
ignite as it should have. Perhaps
her program had too many valleys
and not enough hills. Or perhaps
her Turandot-like aloofness was to
blame (though she did smile
briefly in discomposure when a
fan shouted "We love you.").
Even for such as Leontype Price, I
thought the prima donna-ish
condescension was a bit overdone.
The net effect of the recital
was to suggest Price's vocal
hallmarks — both good and bad —
have not been affected by her
drastic reduction in vocal activity
over the last few years. Her
strength is in the long vocal line,
in the middle two-thirds of her
register, and in a rich full-bodied
tone. Nor have her weaknesses
found a way of disappearing:
occasional huskiness in chest
tones, a lumbering unwieldiness in
tricky passages (noted in the
Beethoven aria especially), and a
maddening tendency to drop all
pretext of emotional
commitment. Still and all, when
Price hits her stride she is beyond
praise — as the happily unhinged
crowd demonstrated after the
encores.
Leontyne Price's recital at the
Opera House Sunday evening
really began to gain momentum
after it was all over. After sitting
placidly and politely through a
rather dry series of art-songs, the
audience fairly leapt for joy when
Leontyne broke down and sang
two operatic encores. Too bad,
for the audience was obviously all
set to run amuck for her. As it
was, the two arias — one from
Adriana Lecouvreur, the other
Doretta's dream song from
Puccini's Im Rondine — were the
night's best offerings. Here was
the Price we know and admire:
mellow, powerfully arching,
emotionally effusive vocalism.
But the price paid by the
audience for these lovely arias was
high. I suppose it is ungenerous to
criticize a fine operatic soprano

usual fare and choose
