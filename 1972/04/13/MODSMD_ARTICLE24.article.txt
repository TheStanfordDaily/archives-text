# 100 Protest Viet Bombing At Palo Alto City Hall
## 
### 
A crowd of about one hundred
persons met yesterday at noon in the
lobby of the Palo Alto City Hall to
protest the bombing of North Viet
nam.
Among the sponsors of the protest
were Kirke Comstock, Mayor of Palo

Alto, Ira Bonde, Mayor of Menlo Park,
and Gary Gillmor, Mayor of Santa
Clara. Mrs. Richard Lyman was
another sponsor.
Several local religious leaders ad
dressed the group, along with represen
tatives of peace groups and George
McGovern's presidential campaign.
Mrs. Mitch Jones, a POW/MIA wife,
told the group the only way to get the
prisoners back was to end the war.
Palo Alto was urged to set up
symbolic sanctuaries for men deserting
the armed forces by Professor Robert
McAfee Brown. "This itself [the city
hall]," Brown said, "would make a
fine sanctuary building."
