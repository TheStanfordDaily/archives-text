Progress In Baseball Talks Reported
NEW YORK - Baseball's player strike continued through a 12th day yesterday
but Marvin Miller, executive director of the striking players' association reported
the parties were "closer to a settlement."
But the failure to settle the question of how the players would be paid for
made up games seemed to doom any hope that play could begin by the
weekend.
North Vietnamese Attack An Loe
SAIGON — North Vietnamese tanks and hundreds of infantrymen today
launched what appeared to be an all-out assault on the provincial capital of An
Loc, 60 miles north of Saigon. Tanks and heavy street fighting were reported in
and around the city.
Initial reports said nine enemy tanks out of a column of 20 had been knocked
out, two by U.S. fighter-bombers and seven by defenders of the besieged city.
Field reports said the city was still in government hands.
In the air war, 852 bombers, America's most powerful warplanes, attacked
targets inside North Vietnam for the second time in four days. Informants said
the attacks were below the 20th parallel, which runs about 80 miles south of
Hanoi.
Radio Hanoi claimed its gunners shot down a 852 and three other U.S. planes
before dawn today. If true, the 852 would be the first of the eight-jet
Stratofortresses downed in the war.
Sally Stanford Wows fc Em...ln Sausalito
SAUSALITO — Sally Stanford, who has run for Sausalito city council six times
since 1962, won a seat in Tuesday's election.
Now 68, Stanford many years ago operated San Francisco's best known
bordello.
At a victory celebration in the restaurant she operates here, Stanford said she
would "use my one vote to return this city to sanity."

SAN JOSE — A coroner's investigator said at the Angela Davis trial yesterday he
watched 17-year-old Jonathan Jackson die, moaning and rolling his head, as he
lay in a van littered with dead bodies.
Keith C. Craig of the Marin County coroner's office, was the first witness to
say that any of those slain were still alive after the shooting stopped at an
August 1970 courthouse shootout which claimed four lives, including Jackson's.
The defense objected earlier in the day that eyewitness accounts of the
shootout were becoming repetitive and "cumulative."
Jurors in the trial got their first look at the death scene inside the van as large
blown-up pictures of the bodies were exhibited in the courtroom. Jurors studied
the pictures with interest but showed no emotion.
After a lengthy afternoon conference in chambers, it was disclosed that
Superior Court Judge Richard Arnason had imposed new, stricter regulations on
attorneys, forbidding them from making any comments whatsoever concerning
the trial.
Arnason told reporters later that he was not issuing a new "gag order" but
was affirming an order imposed Jan. 5, 1971 by Marin County Judge E. Warren
McGuire.
Charlene Mitchell, executive secretary of the National United Committee to
Free Angela Davis (NUCFAD), claimed in a press conference Monday that
"James Carr has never been associated in any way with NUCFAD and he never
had any personal contact with Angela Davis."
Mitchell referred to published accounts in the Los Angeles Times and the San
Jose Mercury and News which she said were "lies about James Carr, Angela
Davis," and NUCFAD.
Additionally, she claimed, prosecutor Albert Harris has "seized on the Carr
murder in a desperate, last ditch attempt to imply that somehow, sometime,
Angela Davis was guilty of something."
Carr, a one-time cellmate of Soledad brother George Jackson, was slain last
Thursday as he walked to his auto.

Progress In Baseball Talks Reported
NEW YORK - Baseball's player strike continued through a 12th day yesterday
but Marvin Miller, executive director of the striking players' association reported
the parties were "closer to a settlement."
But the failure to settle the question of how the players would be paid for
made up games seemed to doom any hope that play could begin by the
weekend.
North Vietnamese Attack An Loe
SAIGON — North Vietnamese tanks and hundreds of infantrymen today
launched what appeared to be an all-out assault on the provincial capital of An
Loc, 60 miles north of Saigon. Tanks and heavy street fighting were reported in
and around the city.
Initial reports said nine enemy tanks out of a column of 20 had been knocked
out, two by U.S. fighter-bombers and seven by defenders of the besieged city.
Field reports said the city was still in government hands.
In the air war, 852 bombers, America's most powerful warplanes, attacked
targets inside North Vietnam for the second time in four days. Informants said
the attacks were below the 20th parallel, which runs about 80 miles south of
Hanoi.
Radio Hanoi claimed its gunners shot down a 852 and three other U.S. planes
before dawn today. If true, the 852 would be the first of the eight-jet
Stratofortresses downed in the war.

SAUSALITO — Sally Stanford, who has run for Sausalito city council six times
since 1962, won a seat in Tuesday's election.
Now 68, Stanford many years ago operated San Francisco's best known
bordello.
At a victory celebration in the restaurant she operates here, Stanford said she
would "use my one vote to return this city to sanity."

SAN JOSE — A coroner's investigator said at the Angela Davis trial yesterday he
watched 17-year-old Jonathan Jackson die, moaning and rolling his head, as he
lay in a van littered with dead bodies.
Keith C. Craig of the Marin County coroner's office, was the first witness to
say that any of those slain were still alive after the shooting stopped at an
August 1970 courthouse shootout which claimed four lives, including Jackson's.
The defense objected earlier in the day that eyewitness accounts of the
shootout were becoming repetitive and "cumulative."
Jurors in the trial got their first look at the death scene inside the van as large
blown-up pictures of the bodies were exhibited in the courtroom. Jurors studied
the pictures with interest but showed no emotion.
After a lengthy afternoon conference in chambers, it was disclosed that
Superior Court Judge Richard Arnason had imposed new, stricter regulations on
attorneys, forbidding them from making any comments whatsoever concerning
the trial.
Arnason told reporters later that he was not issuing a new "gag order" but
was affirming an order imposed Jan. 5, 1971 by Marin County Judge E. Warren
McGuire.
Charlene Mitchell, executive secretary of the National United Committee to
Free Angela Davis (NUCFAD), claimed in a press conference Monday that
"James Carr has never been associated in any way with NUCFAD and he never
had any personal contact with Angela Davis."
Mitchell referred to published accounts in the Los Angeles Times and the San
Jose Mercury and News which she said were "lies about James Carr, Angela
Davis," and NUCFAD.
Additionally, she claimed, prosecutor Albert Harris has "seized on the Carr
murder in a desperate, last ditch attempt to imply that somehow, sometime,
Angela Davis was guilty of something."
Carr, a one-time cellmate of Soledad brother George Jackson, was slain last
Thursday as he walked to his auto.
