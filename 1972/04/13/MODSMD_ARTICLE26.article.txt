# Dupen, Stephens Win City Council Election
## 
### BOB BACON 
Douglas Dupen, Assistant to the
Director of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC), was elect
ed to the Menlo Park City Council on
Tuesday. He was a member of the
"Menlo Park United" slate which
called itself "established residentialist"
and which was branded as "pro
development" by its opponents.
The election overall was viewed as a
victory for Menlo Park United (MPU).
Robert Stephens, of the opposing
"residentialist" group known as "Men
lo Park Tomorrow," was re-elected to
the other council seat. But the
residentialists failed in their bid to
recall MPU councilman George Liddle.
"Menlo Park Tomorrow" is the
outgrowth of the group which led the
fight against the controversial Willow
Expressway last year. Last September,
the city's voters roundly defeated that
highway project in an advisory referen
dum.
Stephens remains the only "residen-

tialist" on the five-member council.
"Menlo Park Tomorrow" claimed
that the group backing Dupen was
merely a front for business interests
seeking to develop the city's foothill
lands.
Stanford's land development plans,
as reflected in the 1971 Livingston-
Blayney Policy-Plan, have been a
prime target of the residentialist forces
in Menlo Park. Very little of Stan
ford's lands are included within the
city limits, but a sizeable portion of
the foothill land endowment borders
on Menlo Park and has been assigned
to that community's "sphere of
influence."
Tuesday, Billy Ray White of Belle
Haven, Dupen's running mate, narrow
ly missed becoming the city's only
black councilman.
Complete returns gave Stephens
3,772; Dupen, 3,393; and White,
3,336. Four other candidates trailed.
Liddle received a 57 percent vote of
confidence in the recall election.
