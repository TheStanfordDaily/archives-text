# $1 Requested For Afro-American Program

The proposed $1 fee assessment next fall for
A fro-American programs if passed would bring
nationally known blacks to speak on campus as well
as finance the publication of the Black Student
Union newspaper, the Real News, according to a
budget released yesterday by Charles Ogletree, BSU
chairman.
Those organizing the project view it both as an
opportunity to bring black culture to Stanford to
educate the Stanford community as a whole and to
give blacks here a chance to get more out of what
they see as the often barren Stanford environment.
Said Ogletree: "Other students don't understand
what it is to be black ... the only way to bridge this
gap is to show our lifestyles," through films, artistic
productions, and perhaps an Afro-American cultural
festival.
Doug McHenry, a member of the ASSU Council
of Presidents, feels the program would be unique in
that it would be "geared towards the whole
community," rather than a particular interest group.
He added that all the events sponsored with
assessment money will be open to the entire
community.
Students will pay $1 each next Fall Quarter for
these activities if the Afro-American Program
Special Fee Assessment in next Wednesday and
Thursday's election passes with a majority. The
proposed assessment includes a refund option.
There is "no means for the exhibition of black
cultural awareness to the whole community,"
McHenry said. Communication between blacks and

whites has declined recently, he added, and the
program would "institutionalize some time for
interaction," between blacks and the campus as a
whole.
The proposed program differs from previous fee
referenda which asked money for the internal
activities of the BSU and other minority groups.
Last fall students voted down a $1, one quarter fee
assessment to be split between the BSU and three
other minority groups.

Fee Assessment

How money will be spent from the upcoming fee
assessment, and what particular events will be
sponsored, will be decided by a consensus of the
BSU membership within the guidelines of the
proposed budget, said Ogletree.
The BSU itself has operated without funds from
the student body over the past academic year, but
McHenry and Ogletree both state that money from
the Afro-American Program Fee would not be used
to run the BSU. If an ASSU Program Fee for next
year is passed, the BSU would ask for funds from
that source.
The $12,000 proposed budget was prepared
under the assumption that few students would ask
for a refund, although Ogletree maintains that the
budget could be trimmed if more students than
planned took advantage of the negative option
clause.
Four thousand dollars is earmarked for a
speakers program, which could bring such

well-known blacks as comedian Dick Gregory;
Coretta King, wife of the late Martin Luther King;
or Julian Bond, a Georgia state legislator, although
there are no definite plans to bring anyone, yet.
Speakers of this caliber usually ask fees in the
area of one or two thousand dollars, but Ogletree is
confident they will come to campus for
considerably less, and possibly for free.
"We have the contacts" through black students
here, he said, to make this possible. He also
remarked that some speakers "would welcome
coming to campus," if they were in the area.
The Real News, which has appeared only
intermittently during the past year, would come out
on a bi-weekly basis next year supported by $4,000
of the budget. Its press run would increase from
4,000 to around 10,000 next year, said Ogletree.
The Real News, along with a proposed black
student literary magazine, would provide news and
opinion from blacks on campus, as well as publicity
for upcoming events.
The remaining $4,000 of the budget would be
split between cultural activities and a program to
bring black children from the nearby community to
campus to attend events which they would not
normally have the opportunity to see. According to
Ogletree, students here would serve as "big brothers
to our young comrades in the community."
Among the cultural activities which Ogletree
envisions is bringing lesser known films by and
about blacks to campus, such as movies from the
thirties which dealt with black, rather than white
cowboys.
