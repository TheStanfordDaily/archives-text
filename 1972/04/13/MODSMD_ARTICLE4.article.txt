# SRM To Protest Military Recruiting
## 
### PATTY FELS 
Members of the Stanford Rehabili
tation Movement and Columbae House
will try to halt Naval recruiting at the
Placement Center today.
The students will demonstrate and
if necessary physically prevent the

recruiters from entering the Placement
Center, according to Paul Loeb of the
Young Crows. "There are some people
willing to get arrested to keep them
out," he said.
The demonstrators hope to repeat
the events of Feb. 9 when a Navy
recruiter left the Placement Center
after confrontation with students.
Many protestors had thought that
the recruiters would not return. "They
said they wouldn't be back; we're
wondering if the administration asked
them to come," said Columbae House
advisor Dave Josephson. Loeb claimed
that Captain John Duck, head of the
Stanford ROTC, had promised that
the recruiting was over.
A group of demonstrators met with
Duck after the recruiter had left
campus. No one recalls exactly what
was said but the general impression
was that he had promised an end to
recruiting, Loeb said.
No Promises
However, Rosie Wolf, an SRM
member, stated that there were no
promises about recruiting. "That
would be completely against the

Navy's policy," she said.
Duck agreed with Wolf. "I never
said that," he said. "After the last
protest we talked about the War and
other things but never about recruit
mg.
Duck was responsible for cancelling
the second scheduled day of interviews
in February. However, he emphasized
that this did not indicate a change in
recruiting policies. "There simply were
no students signed up for interviews
the second day,"he said. "Anything
we did on that trip has nothing to do
with future trips."
Interview Scheduling
Mrs. Frances Holtslander at the
Placement Center said that interviews
are scheduled a year in advance and
that cancellation was up to the Navy.
"Obviously they feel they have a
commitment," she added.
Duck admitted that on-campus
recruiting was not very profitable. Last
year a large number of Stanford
students joined the Navy but most
joined at the San Francisco office
rather than at the Placement Center,
he said.

Only six people have signed up for
interviews today. Duck noted that
four of the six were SRM members.
"Peter Knutson and Rosie Wolf have
signed up," he said. "I really don't see
Rosie Wolf joining the Waves or Peter
Knutson joining the Navy."
Duck says that the Navy sees
demonstrations as "games people
play." Although he anticipates some
protest from the SRM, he said that he
expects no physical violence.
No Publicity
The SRM has not publicized the
demonstration and people have been
contacted mostly by word of mouth.
They plan to congregate outside the
center at 7 a.m. although the first
interviews are not until 9. "We don't
want to let them sneak in," Loeb said.
Yesterday morning 280 crosses
were planted in lawn areas surrounding
White Plaza and the water in Mem
Claw fountain was dyed red. About 17
students watched as the SRM dedicat
ed the crosses to the protest of the
killing in Asia. "We will continue to
protest against armed escalation," said
spokesman Jeff Wright.

IN MEMORY—The Stanford Rehabilitation Movement planted 280 white crosses in the White Plaza lawns yesterday to
protest the killing in Asia. The water in Mem Claw fountain was also dyed red as SRM served warning of its opposition to
on-campus military recruiting.
