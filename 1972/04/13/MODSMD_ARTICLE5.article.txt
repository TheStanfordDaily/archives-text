# ASSU Not A Government
## Burke-Wong Slate Seeks Lobby 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Scott Burke, Elaine Wong, Brent
Appel, and Peter "Spike" Van Petten
think the ASSU should forget trying
to be a student government because

"it possesses no power and virtually no
money."
"We see the ASSU as a student
lobby speaking up for student interests
in all areas of the University," says
Burke.
To lobby for student interests, the
four envision Ralph Nader-type task
forces which would investigate various
areas that affect Stanford students,
publicize findings and press for
changes.

As an example of the need for this
type of lobby, Wong cites the Trustee
Committee on Academic Affairs which
she and Burke served on this year.
'They were just going to rubber
stamp the tuition increase," says
Wong, "and the Trustees were quite
surprised when we came up with some
hard questions about why the raise
was necessary."
"I think it's really necessary to
force these administrators to justify
what they are doing when it has a

bearing on the life of students," adds
Burke.
"One way of prodding the adminis
tration is to investigate and expose
some of the areas where the adminis
tration is falling asleep."
As an area where the four might
"prod" if elected, Appel cites educa
tion.
"The whole promotion, appoint
ment and tenure thing has to be
looked at," he says, "since it has
nothing to do with the professor's
ability to teach."
Appel suggests that the group could
lobby for student evaluations to be
required in a professor's permanent
file.
Wong feels the group could also
work in areas "where the administra
tion has commitments it hasn't made
good on."
"For example," says Wong,
"they've recruuwd Native Americans,
which is really good, but when the
Native Americans come here, the
ASSU. Although this position passed,
his ticket lost.
'There were definitely overtones in
that campaign of 'You wouldn't want
a conservative to be ASSU president."
But Hocker says he doesn't foresee
his political positions getting involved
with his office. "If I get involved in
anything political," he says,"it will be
as anonymously as possible."
Friedman says that the two's
concept of volunteerism is based on
the fact that "People act because
people want to change things" and not
because they're a part of some
compulsory bureaucracy.
She feels there's nothing the ASSU
does now that couldn't be done by
individually concerned students. Says
Hocker, "Scott Burke claims to have
revamped Tresidder."
(Burke, another presidential can
didate, authored a report as ASSU
senator highly critical of the manage
ment of Tresidder Union.)
Bad Coffee
"In the first place," says Hocker, "I
couldn't tell any changes he brought
about. The coffee is just as bad as ever.
"In the second place, there's
nothing he did he couldn't have done
without the title of ASSU senator.
"Improvements and changes can go

on whether you have an ASSU that's
voluntary or not. And if you have an
ASSU that's voluntary, those who
perceive a benefit from the ASSU can
join, while those who do not don't
have to."
Student Lobby
Hocker also quarrels with the Burke
slate position that the ASSU is
necessary to represent student inter
ests in key areas of the University as a
student body.
"Ideas and changes should be valid
or invalid on their own and you don't
need the illusion of the support of
12,000 people to change things."
Hocker has talked with ASSU
financial manager Tom Huseby and
figures that because of tax problems, it
will take about 10 years to make the
ASSU a voluntary organization. But
Hocker says if he's elected, "unlike
this year's Council of Presidents,
instead of writing idiotic letters to
Lyman, I'll shut up and try to get
through some of this red tape."
Hocker has been editor of The
Arena for two years and served on the
Student Conduct Legislative Council
last year. He's a junior in English.
Friedman is a senior in economics
who has been accepted at the Stanford
Business School.

But Hocker says he doesn't foresee
his political positions getting involved
with his office. "If I get involved in
anything political," he says,"it will be
as anonymously as possible."
Friedman says that the two's
concept of volunteerism is based on
the fact that "People act because
people want to change things" and not
because they're a part of some
compulsory bureaucracy.
She feels there's nothing the ASSU
does now that couldn't be done by
individually concerned students. Says
Hocker, "Scott Burke claims to have
revamped Tresidder."
(Burke, another presidential can
didate, authored a report as ASSU
senator highly critical of the manage
ment of Tresidder Union.)
Bad Coffee
"In the first place," says Hocker, "I
couldn't tell any changes he brought
about. The coffee is just as bad as ever.
"In the second place, there's
nothing he did he couldn't have done
without the title of ASSU senator.
"Improvements and changes can go

on whether you have an ASSU that's
voluntary or not. And if you have an
ASSU that's voluntary, those who
perceive a benefit from the ASSU can
join, while those who do not don't
have to."
Student Lobby
Hocker also quarrels with the Burke
slate position that the ASSU is
necessary to represent student inter
ests in key areas of the University as a
student body.
"Ideas and changes should be valid
or invalid on their own and you don't
need the illusion of the support of
12,000 people to change things."
Hocker has talked with ASSU
financial manager Tom Huseby and
figures that because of tax problems, it
will take about 10 years to make the
ASSU a voluntary organization. But
Hocker says if he's elected, "unlike
this year's Council of Presidents,
instead of writing idiotic letters to
Lyman, I'll shut up and try to get
through some of this red tape."
Hocker has been editor of The
Arena for two years and served on the
Student Conduct Legislative Council
last year. He's a junior in English.
Friedman is a senior in economics
who has been accepted at the Stanford
Business School.
Scott Burke, Elaine Wong, Brent
Appel, and Peter "Spike" Van Petten
think the ASSU should forget trying
to be a student government because

"it possesses no power and virtually no
money."
"We see the ASSU as a student
lobby speaking up for student interests
in all areas of the University," says
Burke.
To lobby for student interests, the
four envision Ralph Nader-type task
forces which would investigate various
areas that affect Stanford students,
publicize findings and press for
changes.

Presidential Slate

As an example of the need for this
type of lobby, Wong cites the Trustee
Committee on Academic Affairs which
she and Burke served on this year.
'They were just going to rubber
stamp the tuition increase," says
Wong, "and the Trustees were quite
surprised when we came up with some
hard questions about why the raise
was necessary."
"I think it's really necessary to
force these administrators to justify
what they are doing when it has a

bearing on the life of students," adds
Burke.
"One way of prodding the adminis
tration is to investigate and expose
some of the areas where the adminis
tration is falling asleep."
As an area where the four might
"prod" if elected, Appel cites educa
tion.
"The whole promotion, appoint
ment and tenure thing has to be
looked at," he says, "since it has
nothing to do with the professor's
ability to teach."
Appel suggests that the group could
lobby for student evaluations to be
required in a professor's permanent
file.
Wong feels the group could also
work in areas "where the administra
tion has commitments it hasn't made
good on."
"For example," says Wong,
"they've recruuwd Native Americans,
which is really good, but when the
Native Americans come here, the
ASSU. Although this position passed,
his ticket lost.
'There were definitely overtones in
that campaign of 'You wouldn't want
a conservative to be ASSU president."
