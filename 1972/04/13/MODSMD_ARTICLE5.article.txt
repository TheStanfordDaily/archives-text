# ASSU Not A Government
## Burke-Wong Slate Seeks Lobby 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Scott Burke, Elaine Wong, Brent
Appel, and Peter "Spike" Van Petten
think the ASSU should forget trying
to be a student government because

"it possesses no power and virtually no
money."
"We see the ASSU as a student
lobby speaking up for student interests
in all areas of the University," says
Burke.
To lobby for student interests, the
four envision Ralph Nader-type task
forces which would investigate various
areas that affect Stanford students,
publicize findings and press for
changes.

As an example of the need for this
type of lobby, Wong cites the Trustee
Committee on Academic Affairs which
she and Burke served on this year.
'They were just going to rubber
stamp the tuition increase," says
Wong, "and the Trustees were quite
surprised when we came up with some
hard questions about why the raise
was necessary."
"I think it's really necessary to
force these administrators to justify
what they are doing when it has a

bearing on the life of students," adds
Burke.
"One way of prodding the adminis
tration is to investigate and expose
some of the areas where the adminis
tration is falling asleep."
As an area where the four might
"prod" if elected, Appel cites educa
tion.
"The whole promotion, appoint
ment and tenure thing has to be
looked at," he says, "since it has
nothing to do with the professor's
ability to teach."
Appel suggests that the group could
lobby for student evaluations to be
required in a professor's permanent
file.
Wong feels the group could also
work in areas "where the administra
tion has commitments it hasn't made
good on."
"For example," says Wong,
"they've recruuwd Native Americans,
which is really good, but when the
Native Americans come here, the
