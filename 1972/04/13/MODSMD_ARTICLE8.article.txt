Editor, THE DAILY:
A letter in Tuesday's Daily
criticized several Stanford law
student supporters of the
proposed public interest law firm
for their inaccurate
characterization of a recent
(November 26, 1971) California
Supreme Court decision involving
Pacific Telephone and the State
Public Utilities Commission. The
decision, which allegedly was not
fairly represented by the students,
deserves further explication.

Beginning in 1954, federal laws
granted public utilities an option
to use accelerated depreciation
accounting methods which would
result in decreased federal tax
payments. Apparently all utilities
in the state except Pacific and
General Telephone adopted the
new procedures and passed the
savings on to their customers.
The PUC ruled in 1968 that
PT&T's failure to use accelerated
depreciation may have cost
customers as much as $450
million in increased rates. The
Commission found that PT&T
management had exercised its
discretion to the detriment of the
public interest and that it would
be reasonable to set telephone
rates as if PT&T were using the
accelerated depreciation methods.
A subsequent PUC decision,
taking into consideration new
federal tax provisions, concluded
that telephone rates would no
longer be set on the basis,
favorable to subscribers, used
since 1968.
In reviewing this subsequent
PUC decision, the Supreme Court

of California noted that its effect
was to reward PT&T for its
imprudent management, and to
cause the customer to contribute
interest-free .capital for the
utility's own use. The Court
ordered the PUC to reconsider its
decision and suggested that the
Commission adopt a compromise
striking a proper balance between
the interest of the subscribers and
PT&T.
This case speaks for itself. Had
there not been interested parties
with the financial resources and
legal expertise to challenge the
PUC's decision in the state
supreme court, California
consumers might be paying
unnecessarily higher telephone
rates.
Citizens Advocates at Stanford,
if approved by students in the
upcoming referendum, will be an
organization with the resources
and expertise to mount such
challenges on behalf of the
consumer.

As a rule Stanford workers
take little interest in student
government elections. Regardless
of who's elected the results to
workers are hardly apparent.
However, the upcoming election is
the exception to this rule. We feel
that "The Collective" slate of
candidates offers workers and
students the best chance to forge

a working coalition.
This united front is vital if we
are to attack and wipe out
Stanford racism, war complicity,
oppression and repression where it
touches both workers and
students. "The Collective"
concept of "Dual Power" is
legitimate and long overdue, but
will not succeed unless workers
and students can find common
ground together in their efforts to
"Rehabilitate Stanford."

Lyman.)
Dear President Lyman,
By this letter I would like to
urge the continuation of the
Placement Services and the
maintenance of open recruiting. I
take this position despite
considerable sympathy for
student opposition to militarism
generally and recruiting for
companies involved in support of
militarism in particular.
I write from the perspective of
over twenty years of research and
teaching in electrical engineering
at Stanford, much of my research
having been supported by DoD
contracts in the past. To my
present regret, over 24 years of
my academic and professional life
have been associated in some way
with militarism. About five years
ago I came to the belated
conclusion that militarism is a
cancerous and overgrown parasitic
monstrosity that threatens our
national and world society, and

will not support it now if I can
avoid it.
Nevertheless, I feel that it is
crucially important for individuals
to retain the freedom to come to
their own conclusions in these
matters without having that
freedom circumscribed by others
regardless of the purity of their
motives or moral position. I feel it
entirely appropriate for potential
Placement Service users to be
made aware of military
involvements where they exist and
even to be urged to adopt a
particular course of action.
I applaud decisions by students
to avoid seeking positions with
organizations engaged in
destructive activities whether
militaristic, environmental,
socially exploitive or whatever.
This should, however, be their
own free decision. I felt much the
same way about the ROTC issue.
I feel that the Placement
Service provides a valuable
opportunity for our students to
contact potential employers and
that it would be very unfortunate
for the service to be terminated or
seriously hampered. It seems an
inappropriate target for student
displeasure with militarism,
however legitimate.
As one who experienced the
AEL debacle directly, I would
hate to see pressures for
immediate and visible results
produce hasty action that would
be regretted at leisure in the
future.

As a rule Stanford workers
take little interest in student
government elections. Regardless
of who's elected the results to
workers are hardly apparent.
However, the upcoming election is
the exception to this rule. We feel
that "The Collective" slate of
candidates offers workers and
students the best chance to forge

a working coalition.
This united front is vital if we
are to attack and wipe out
Stanford racism, war complicity,
oppression and repression where it
touches both workers and
students. "The Collective"
concept of "Dual Power" is
legitimate and long overdue, but
will not succeed unless workers
and students can find common
ground together in their efforts to
"Rehabilitate Stanford."

Dear President Lyman,
By this letter I would like to
urge the continuation of the
Placement Services and the
maintenance of open recruiting. I
take this position despite
considerable sympathy for
student opposition to militarism
generally and recruiting for
companies involved in support of
militarism in particular.
I write from the perspective of
over twenty years of research and
teaching in electrical engineering
at Stanford, much of my research
having been supported by DoD
contracts in the past. To my
present regret, over 24 years of
my academic and professional life
have been associated in some way
with militarism. About five years
ago I came to the belated
conclusion that militarism is a
cancerous and overgrown parasitic
monstrosity that threatens our
national and world society, and

will not support it now if I can
avoid it.
Nevertheless, I feel that it is
crucially important for individuals
to retain the freedom to come to
their own conclusions in these
matters without having that
freedom circumscribed by others
regardless of the purity of their
motives or moral position. I feel it
entirely appropriate for potential
Placement Service users to be
made aware of military
involvements where they exist and
even to be urged to adopt a
particular course of action.
I applaud decisions by students
to avoid seeking positions with
organizations engaged in
destructive activities whether
militaristic, environmental,
socially exploitive or whatever.
This should, however, be their
own free decision. I felt much the
same way about the ROTC issue.
I feel that the Placement
Service provides a valuable
opportunity for our students to
contact potential employers and
that it would be very unfortunate
for the service to be terminated or
seriously hampered. It seems an
inappropriate target for student
displeasure with militarism,
however legitimate.
As one who experienced the
AEL debacle directly, I would
hate to see pressures for
immediate and visible results
produce hasty action that would
be regretted at leisure in the
future.

Editor, THE DAILY:
A letter in Tuesday's Daily
criticized several Stanford law
student supporters of the
proposed public interest law firm
for their inaccurate
characterization of a recent
(November 26, 1971) California
Supreme Court decision involving
Pacific Telephone and the State
Public Utilities Commission. The
decision, which allegedly was not
fairly represented by the students,
deserves further explication.

Beginning in 1954, federal laws
granted public utilities an option
to use accelerated depreciation
accounting methods which would
result in decreased federal tax
payments. Apparently all utilities
in the state except Pacific and
General Telephone adopted the
new procedures and passed the
savings on to their customers.
The PUC ruled in 1968 that
PT&T's failure to use accelerated
depreciation may have cost
customers as much as $450
million in increased rates. The
Commission found that PT&T
management had exercised its
discretion to the detriment of the
public interest and that it would
be reasonable to set telephone
rates as if PT&T were using the
accelerated depreciation methods.
A subsequent PUC decision,
taking into consideration new
federal tax provisions, concluded
that telephone rates would no
longer be set on the basis,
favorable to subscribers, used
since 1968.
In reviewing this subsequent
PUC decision, the Supreme Court

of California noted that its effect
was to reward PT&T for its
imprudent management, and to
cause the customer to contribute
interest-free .capital for the
utility's own use. The Court
ordered the PUC to reconsider its
decision and suggested that the
Commission adopt a compromise

the interest of the subscribers and
PT&T.

(Editor's Note: This letter was
originally sent to President
Lyman.)
Dear President Lyman,
By this letter I would like to
urge the continuation of the
Placement Services and the
maintenance of open recruiting. I
take this position despite
considerable sympathy for
student opposition to militarism
generally and recruiting for
companies involved in support of
militarism in particular.
I write from the perspective of
over twenty years of research and
teaching in electrical engineering
at Stanford, much of my research
having been supported by DoD
contracts in the past. To my
present regret, over 24 years of
my academic and professional life
have been associated in some way
with militarism. About five years
ago I came to the belated
conclusion that militarism is a
cancerous and overgrown parasitic
monstrosity that threatens our
national and world society, and

will not support it now if I can
avoid it.
Nevertheless, I feel that it is
crucially important for individuals
to retain the freedom to come to
their own conclusions in these
matters without having that
freedom circumscribed by others
regardless of the purity of their
motives or moral position. I feel it
entirely appropriate for potential
Placement Service users to be
made aware of military
involvements where they exist and
even to be urged to adopt a
particular course of action.
I applaud decisions by students
to avoid seeking positions with
organizations engaged in
destructive activities whether
militaristic, environmental,
socially exploitive or whatever.
This should, however, be their
own free decision. I felt much the
same way about the ROTC issue.
I feel that the Placement
Service provides a valuable
opportunity for our students to
contact potential employers and
that it would be very unfortunate
for the service to be terminated or
seriously hampered. It seems an
inappropriate target for student
displeasure with militarism,
however legitimate.
As one who experienced the
AEL debacle directly, I would
hate to see pressures for
immediate and visible results
produce hasty action that would
be regretted at leisure in the
future.
