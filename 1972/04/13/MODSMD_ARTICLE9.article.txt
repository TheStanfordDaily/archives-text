# one step beyond
## A 						Modest Mascot Proposal

END OF THE TRAIL—It seems, from what the Stanford Observor
tells me, that the Stanford Indian is about to get the axe. As an
alumnus, I suppose I should become upset and threaten President
Lyman with imminent financial ruin if he dares to tamper with the
sacred symbol of Stanford athletic prowess.
Actually, I seldom used the name "Indians" to refer to the
Stanford team while I was a student, and I can't work up the
adrenalin to demand it be retained, particularly if there are students
who feel that use of the name is demeaning or degrading.
It's a question of image. Stanford's Native Americans feel that
naming the team the "Indians" perpetuates the romantic myth of the
savage redskin who made European conquest of this country so
exciting. Perpetuation of this myth detracts from efforts to alleviate
the horrible condition of the American Indian today. (If anyone
doubts that the Indian's problem is real, I suggest he take a short drive
through Northern Arizona. That should shut him up.)
Since, as everyone in the Administration will agree, the last thing
that Stanford wants to do is perpetuate a myth, we can safely assume
that the Stanford Indian will be banished to the happy hunting
ground north of the women's gym. Which leaves the University with
the sticky problem of finding a new name for the team.
Obvious
The obvious solution is not necessarily the best. As tempting as it
may be, we cannot leave the team nameless, as this is bound to
provoke dissent among Classical scholars who will claim that they are
being held up to ridicule (". .. Out of the cave the mammoth
Polyphemos roared in answer: "Nohbdy, Nohbdy's tricked me,
Nohbdy's ruined me'," The Odyssey, book Nine). In addition, we
would be supplying the more neanderthal of the network sportscasters
with innumerable opportunities to have a laugh at our expense ("And
here Chris, come the Stanford Nothigns onto the field!," "Where,
Curt?").
No, we must find a name.
The next obvious choice is the old "Cardinals," but this is clearly
unacceptable. For one thing, no one is sure what "cardinals" means,
and football is confusing enough without adding unnecessary
ambiguity. For instance, does "cardinal" refer to a color? If so, who
the hell ever names a football team after a color? Okay, there's the
Cleveland Browns, and the Washington Redskins. But the first refers
to "brownies," mythical creatures containing marijuana, and the

second, well, allthings considered, 1 wouldn't advise George Allen to
order any large quantities of letterhead.
St. Louis?
Perhaps "cardinal" refers to a bird that lives in St. Louis? If so,
how can we name a California team after a foreign bird?
Besides, the Pac-8 already has one team named the Ducks,which is
ludicrous enough; to establish a situation in which the cardinals would
battle it out with the ducks would go beyond the limits of good taste,
and probably lay a public relations egg to boot.
No. I cannot live with the concept of "Cardinals." Besides, some
unreconstructed Calvinist would decry the insidious influence of
Rome, and demand we name the basketball team the "Presbyters,"
assuming that he hadn't seen the basketball team.
Considering the difficulty of this problem, I am sure that the
committee investigating the matter will be delighted to hear that I
have generated the ideal solution. The problem, as I have said, and
attempted to illustrate, is one of image. The Stanford Native
Americans are upset that they are being romanticized, that their
contemporary problems are being ignored because non-Native
Americans (those of us whose ancestors have lived here for less than
480 years) have been conditioned to think of the Indian in terms of
frontier warfare rather than rural poverty and alcoholism. Well, I have
a group whose image would be brightened considerably by being
identified with a first rate, tough, grinding, winning football team.
I propose that the university name its team the Stanford Hebrews.
Here is a group that is identified throughout the world with the
concept of losing. Black militants point to the German Jews meekly
tiptoeing up to the ovens and say, "Not us, baby! We ain't gonna be
like those Jews who didn't put up a fight. The Man comes to get us,
he's gonna get his!"
Our Western, Christian culture is replete with the idea that the Jew
not only always loses, it's inconceivable that he should win. Shylock
loses. The Wandering Jew loses. Fagin loses. Portnoy loses.
For a while, it looked like Israel was going to lose, and everybody
loved Israel. Then, Israel turned around and'beat the hell out of all of
its neighbors, and the world was shocked. It was assumed that if Jews
were winning, someone must be cheating, and the Israelis were
immediately branded as aggressors.
Now, if Sam Pekinpah made a movie showing Chief Running Horse
and twenty warriors beating the hell out of the U.S. Cavalry, nobody
would scream "aggressor!" No, clearly, the American Indian doesn't
need the image of a football team nearly as much as does the
American Hebrew.
Stereotype
When a gentile thinks of the Jew, his stereotype usually falls into
one of three molds: he sees the Jew as a scholar, a rabbi with a long
beard bending over a scroll in which are written the equations of
general relativity as applied to advanced surgical techniques; or, he
sees the Jew as a dangerous radical named Rubin or Hoffman or Marx,
threatening the fabric of society, part of an International Jewish
Conspiracy; or, he sees him as a financier and banker, the pinnacle of
the Capitalist elite, a Rothschild or a Baruch secretly financing an
International Jewish Conspiracy. In any case, he doesn't see him as a
fighter, an athlete, a lumberjack — or a football player.
Gearly, naming a football team the Hebrews would do wonders,
indeed one could say miracles, for the image of the Jew as a human
being who occasionally hits back effectively, without breaking a finger
in the process.
The implications for intercollegiate athletics are staggering.lmagine
the chagrin of the Trojans when the Stanford quarterback calls signals
in Aramaic. Painting a small skull cap on the football helmet would
give the team a benign, prayerlike aura that would disconcert the
Spartans. Running blue and white stripes across the back, over the
shoulders and down the front of the jersey would simulate a
prayershawl, making the team seem faintly rabbinical, which would
bother the Bruins, for who but an SS commando would want to be
accused of attacking a rabbi? Imagine the confusion when the rabbi
carrying the ball kicks the cornerback ir. the kidneys!
Scheduling would be a delight. Stanford could play Nortre Dame,
the Hebrew. 1 ; vs. the Fighting Irish, an instant replay of my youth! To
say nothing of when Stanford plays the Arkansas razorbacks and
refuses to step out onto the s field ("Soooeeeee, pig, pig,
UNCLEAN!!"), or when we play bngham Young and the two teams
snarl "Gentile!" at each other, sowing endless confusion.
Horowitz! Horowitz!
Now, there was an Indian!

and twenty warriors beating the hell out of the U.S. Cavalry, nobody
would scream "aggressor!" No, clearly, the American Indian doesn't
need the image of a football team nearly as much as does the
American Hebrew.
Stereotype
When a gentile thinks of the Jew, his stereotype usually falls into
one of three molds: he sees the Jew as a scholar, a rabbi with a long
beard bending over a scroll in which are written the equations of
general relativity as applied to advanced surgical techniques; or, he
sees the Jew as a dangerous radical named Rubin or Hoffman or Marx,
threatening the fabric of society, part of an International Jewish
Conspiracy; or, he sees him as a financier and banker, the pinnacle of
the Capitalist elite, a Rothschild or a Baruch secretly financing an
International Jewish Conspiracy. In any case, he doesn't see him as a
fighter, an athlete, a lumberjack — or a football player.
Gearly, naming a football team the Hebrews would do wonders,
indeed one could say miracles, for the image of the Jew as a human
being who occasionally hits back effectively, without breaking a finger
in the process.
The implications for intercollegiate athletics are staggering.lmagine
the chagrin of the Trojans when the Stanford quarterback calls signals
in Aramaic. Painting a small skull cap on the football helmet would
give the team a benign, prayerlike aura that would disconcert the
Spartans. Running blue and white stripes across the back, over the
shoulders and down the front of the jersey would simulate a
prayershawl, making the team seem faintly rabbinical, which would
bother the Bruins, for who but an SS commando would want to be
accused of attacking a rabbi? Imagine the confusion when the rabbi
carrying the ball kicks the cornerback ir. the kidneys!
Scheduling would be a delight. Stanford could play Nortre Dame,
the Hebrew. 1 ; vs. the Fighting Irish, an instant replay of my youth! To
say nothing of when Stanford plays the Arkansas razorbacks and
refuses to step out onto the s field ("Soooeeeee, pig, pig,
UNCLEAN!!"), or when we play bngham Young and the two teams
snarl "Gentile!" at each other, sowing endless confusion.
Horowitz! Horowitz!
Now, there was an Indian!

END OF THE TRAIL—It seems, from what the Stanford Observor
tells me, that the Stanford Indian is about to get the axe. As an
alumnus, I suppose I should become upset and threaten President
Lyman with imminent financial ruin if he dares to tamper with the
sacred symbol of Stanford athletic prowess.
Actually, I seldom used the name "Indians" to refer to the
Stanford team while I was a student, and I can't work up the
adrenalin to demand it be retained, particularly if there are students
who feel that use of the name is demeaning or degrading.
It's a question of image. Stanford's Native Americans feel that
naming the team the "Indians" perpetuates the romantic myth of the
savage redskin who made European conquest of this country so
exciting. Perpetuation of this myth detracts from efforts to alleviate
the horrible condition of the American Indian today. (If anyone
doubts that the Indian's problem is real, I suggest he take a short drive
through Northern Arizona. That should shut him up.)
Since, as everyone in the Administration will agree, the last thing
that Stanford wants to do is perpetuate a myth, we can safely assume
that the Stanford Indian will be banished to the happy hunting
ground north of the women's gym. Which leaves the University with
the sticky problem of finding a new name for the team.
Obvious
The obvious solution is not necessarily the best. As tempting as it
may be, we cannot leave the team nameless, as this is bound to
provoke dissent among Classical scholars who will claim that they are
being held up to ridicule (". .. Out of the cave the mammoth
Polyphemos roared in answer: "Nohbdy, Nohbdy's tricked me,
Nohbdy's ruined me'," The Odyssey, book Nine). In addition, we
would be supplying the more neanderthal of the network sportscasters
with innumerable opportunities to have a laugh at our expense ("And
here Chris, come the Stanford Nothigns onto the field!," "Where,
Curt?").
No, we must find a name.
The next obvious choice is the old "Cardinals," but this is clearly
unacceptable. For one thing, no one is sure what "cardinals" means,
and football is confusing enough without adding unnecessary
ambiguity. For instance, does "cardinal" refer to a color? If so, who
the hell ever names a football team after a color? Okay, there's the
Cleveland Browns, and the Washington Redskins. But the first refers
to "brownies," mythical creatures containing marijuana, and the

second, well, allthings considered, 1 wouldn't advise George Allen to
order any large quantities of letterhead.
St. Louis?
Perhaps "cardinal" refers to a bird that lives in St. Louis? If so,
how can we name a California team after a foreign bird?
Besides, the Pac-8 already has one team named the Ducks,which is
ludicrous enough; to establish a situation in which the cardinals would
battle it out with the ducks would go beyond the limits of good taste,
and probably lay a public relations egg to boot.
No. I cannot live with the concept of "Cardinals." Besides, some
unreconstructed Calvinist would decry the insidious influence of
Rome, and demand we name the basketball team the "Presbyters,"
assuming that he hadn't seen the basketball team.
Considering the difficulty of this problem, I am sure that the
committee investigating the matter will be delighted to hear that I
have generated the ideal solution. The problem, as I have said, and
attempted to illustrate, is one of image. The Stanford Native
Americans are upset that they are being romanticized, that their
contemporary problems are being ignored because non-Native
Americans (those of us whose ancestors have lived here for less than
480 years) have been conditioned to think of the Indian in terms of
frontier warfare rather than rural poverty and alcoholism. Well, I have
a group whose image would be brightened considerably by being
identified with a first rate, tough, grinding, winning football team.
I propose that the university name its team the Stanford Hebrews.
Here is a group that is identified throughout the world with the
concept of losing. Black militants point to the German Jews meekly
tiptoeing up to the ovens and say, "Not us, baby! We ain't gonna be
like those Jews who didn't put up a fight. The Man comes to get us,
he's gonna get his!"
Our Western, Christian culture is replete with the idea that the Jew
not only always loses, it's inconceivable that he should win. Shylock
loses. The Wandering Jew loses. Fagin loses. Portnoy loses.
For a while, it looked like Israel was going to lose, and everybody
loved Israel. Then, Israel turned around and'beat the hell out of all of
its neighbors, and the world was shocked. It was assumed that if Jews
were winning, someone must be cheating, and the Israelis were
immediately branded as aggressors.

Perhaps "cardinal" refers to a bird that lives in St. Louis? If so,
how can we name a California team after a foreign bird?
Besides, the Pac-8 already has one team named the Ducks,which is
ludicrous enough; to establish a situation in which the cardinals would
battle it out with the ducks would go beyond the limits of good taste,
and probably lay a public relations egg to boot.
No. I cannot live with the concept of "Cardinals." Besides, some
unreconstructed Calvinist would decry the insidious influence of
Rome, and demand we name the basketball team the "Presbyters,"
assuming that he hadn't seen the basketball team.
Considering the difficulty of this problem, I am sure that the
committee investigating the matter will be delighted to hear that I
have generated the ideal solution. The problem, as I have said, and
attempted to illustrate, is one of image. The Stanford Native
Americans are upset that they are being romanticized, that their
contemporary problems are being ignored because non-Native
Americans (those of us whose ancestors have lived here for less than
480 years) have been conditioned to think of the Indian in terms of
frontier warfare rather than rural poverty and alcoholism. Well, I have
a group whose image would be brightened considerably by being
identified with a first rate, tough, grinding, winning football team.
I propose that the university name its team the Stanford Hebrews.
Here is a group that is identified throughout the world with the
concept of losing. Black militants point to the German Jews meekly
tiptoeing up to the ovens and say, "Not us, baby! We ain't gonna be
like those Jews who didn't put up a fight. The Man comes to get us,
he's gonna get his!"
Our Western, Christian culture is replete with the idea that the Jew
not only always loses, it's inconceivable that he should win. Shylock
loses. The Wandering Jew loses. Fagin loses. Portnoy loses.
For a while, it looked like Israel was going to lose, and everybody
loved Israel. Then, Israel turned around and'beat the hell out of all of
its neighbors, and the world was shocked. It was assumed that if Jews
were winning, someone must be cheating, and the Israelis were
immediately branded as aggressors.
Now, if Sam Pekinpah made a movie showing Chief Running Horse
and twenty warriors beating the hell out of the U.S. Cavalry, nobody
would scream "aggressor!" No, clearly, the American Indian doesn't
need the image of a football team nearly as much as does the
American Hebrew.
Stereotype
When a gentile thinks of the Jew, his stereotype usually falls into
one of three molds: he sees the Jew as a scholar, a rabbi with a long
beard bending over a scroll in which are written the equations of
general relativity as applied to advanced surgical techniques; or, he
sees the Jew as a dangerous radical named Rubin or Hoffman or Marx,
threatening the fabric of society, part of an International Jewish
Conspiracy; or, he sees him as a financier and banker, the pinnacle of
the Capitalist elite, a Rothschild or a Baruch secretly financing an
International Jewish Conspiracy. In any case, he doesn't see him as a
fighter, an athlete, a lumberjack — or a football player.
Gearly, naming a football team the Hebrews would do wonders,
indeed one could say miracles, for the image of the Jew as a human
being who occasionally hits back effectively, without breaking a finger
in the process.
The implications for intercollegiate athletics are staggering.lmagine
the chagrin of the Trojans when the Stanford quarterback calls signals
in Aramaic. Painting a small skull cap on the football helmet would
give the team a benign, prayerlike aura that would disconcert the
Spartans. Running blue and white stripes across the back, over the
shoulders and down the front of the jersey would simulate a
prayershawl, making the team seem faintly rabbinical, which would
bother the Bruins, for who but an SS commando would want to be
accused of attacking a rabbi? Imagine the confusion when the rabbi
carrying the ball kicks the cornerback ir. the kidneys!
Scheduling would be a delight. Stanford could play Nortre Dame,
the Hebrew. 1 ; vs. the Fighting Irish, an instant replay of my youth! To
say nothing of when Stanford plays the Arkansas razorbacks and
refuses to step out onto the s field ("Soooeeeee, pig, pig,
UNCLEAN!!"), or when we play bngham Young and the two teams
snarl "Gentile!" at each other, sowing endless confusion.
Horowitz! Horowitz!
Now, there was an Indian!

END OF THE TRAIL—It seems, from what the Stanford Observor
tells me, that the Stanford Indian is about to get the axe. As an
alumnus, I suppose I should become upset and threaten President
Lyman with imminent financial ruin if he dares to tamper with the
sacred symbol of Stanford athletic prowess.
Actually, I seldom used the name "Indians" to refer to the
Stanford team while I was a student, and I can't work up the
adrenalin to demand it be retained, particularly if there are students
who feel that use of the name is demeaning or degrading.
It's a question of image. Stanford's Native Americans feel that
naming the team the "Indians" perpetuates the romantic myth of the
savage redskin who made European conquest of this country so
exciting. Perpetuation of this myth detracts from efforts to alleviate
the horrible condition of the American Indian today. (If anyone
doubts that the Indian's problem is real, I suggest he take a short drive
through Northern Arizona. That should shut him up.)
Since, as everyone in the Administration will agree, the last thing
that Stanford wants to do is perpetuate a myth, we can safely assume
that the Stanford Indian will be banished to the happy hunting
ground north of the women's gym. Which leaves the University with
the sticky problem of finding a new name for the team.
Obvious
The obvious solution is not necessarily the best. As tempting as it
may be, we cannot leave the team nameless, as this is bound to
provoke dissent among Classical scholars who will claim that they are
being held up to ridicule (". .. Out of the cave the mammoth
Polyphemos roared in answer: "Nohbdy, Nohbdy's tricked me,
Nohbdy's ruined me'," The Odyssey, book Nine). In addition, we
would be supplying the more neanderthal of the network sportscasters
with innumerable opportunities to have a laugh at our expense ("And
here Chris, come the Stanford Nothigns onto the field!," "Where,
Curt?").
No, we must find a name.
The next obvious choice is the old "Cardinals," but this is clearly
unacceptable. For one thing, no one is sure what "cardinals" means,
and football is confusing enough without adding unnecessary
ambiguity. For instance, does "cardinal" refer to a color? If so, who
the hell ever names a football team after a color? Okay, there's the
Cleveland Browns, and the Washington Redskins. But the first refers
to "brownies," mythical creatures containing marijuana, and the

second, well, allthings considered, 1 wouldn't advise George Allen to
order any large quantities of letterhead.
