# Recruiters Enter Center Despite Demonstration
## 
### BOB BACON 
Two Naval Aviation recruiters forc
ed their way into the Placement
Center yesterday morning, pushing
aside a crowd of demonstrators. Later
in the morning, vandals attacked their
car.
The two shoved their way into the
Center with the assistance of campus
Public Safety Director Marvin Harring
ton and security officer Donald Lillie.
Earlier, a Coast Guard recruiter
confronted by the 50 protesters left
without attempting to enter the
building.
Inside, the Navy recruiters discussed
the Indochina War with protesters. No
interviews were disrupted.
Shoving Match
Lt. John Erickson and Lt. (j.g.) Ray
Morris arrived about 9:35 a.m. Har
rington met them in the bookstore
parking lot and escorted them to the
Center entrance. As he and Lillie

began to shove their way through the
crowd blocking the door, Harrington
warned the demonstrators that they
were subject to arrest.
With some difficulty the outward
opening doors were opened, and the
recruiters entered, followed immedi
ately by the protesters.
Michael Berkowitz, one of the
demonstrators, was scheduled for a
9:30 a.m. interview, and he invited
others to join him in talking with the
two officers. There were about ten
people in the tiny interview room, and
others listened in the adjacent corri
dor.
Car Attacked
While Erickson and Morris were at
the Center, their car had its windshield
smashed by three projectiles, and had
two tires flattened. It was parked next
to the Free Campus Movement head
quarters on Lane B. A Viet Cong flag
was left on the hood.
The two recruiters, from the Ala
meda Naval Air Station, had five
interviews scheduled. One student met
the recruiters briefly as the protesters
were entering the building.
The remaining four interviews were
with persons associated with the
protest — Berkowitz, Rosie Wolf, Don
Zweig, and Peter Knutson. Berkowitz
and Wolf, at the morning session,
requested "open interviews" at which
fellow protesters could join them in
questioning the recruiters.
Zweig and Knutson were scheduled
for afternoon interviews, but neither
they nor the Navy officers were at the
Center in the afternoon.
The Navy recruiters are slated to
return to the Center today, but as of
last night no students had requested
appointments with them. They had
been informed of this, and Placement
Center Director Ralph Keller and
Frances Holtslander, Supervisor of
Recruitment, were uncertain as to
whether they would appear.
Zweig said that, to his knowledge,
there were no plans for a demonstra
tion at the Center today.
Coast Guard
Yesterday at about 8:45 a.m.,
Ensign Dan Wilson of the Coast Guard
arrived to conduct one interview. Met
by the crowd and informed of last
spring's student referendum against
military recruiting and the Committee
on Student Services (COSS) report

recommending the same, he talked for
a few minutes to demonstrators and
then left the scene.
He declined Harrington's offer to
escort him into the building.
'Expected Protest'
Erickson said he "sort of expected"
a demonstration. Another Naval Avia
tion recruiter, Lt. (j.g.) Kenneth
Santoro, was blocked from entering
the Center last February.
Santoro had made no attempt to
enter after being confronted. "If I
hadn't had support [from Harrington
and Lillie], I wouldn't have tried to
get in either," Erickson said.
He admitted that "I don't think
we'll get much accomplished today."
Vietnam Policy
Despite their protests that "we're
not here to discuss United States
Vietnam policy," the recruiters did
make some comments on it in
answering demonstrators' questions.
"If I didn't believe what we do in
Vietnam was right, in good taste, I
wouldn't be here," Morris said.
Wilson, the Coast Guard recruiter,
said he was not aware of plans for the
demonstration. Protester Kwonping
Ho accused University officials of
"deceiving" recruiters by not telling
them of the referendum and COSS
report recommending against military
recruiting.
The crowd had begun to gather at 7
a.m. By 11 a.m., it had largely
dispersed.
It included members of Columbae
House, the Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement, and the Association of
Young Crows.
Meanwhile, the trial of eight persons
accused of disrupting Professor Wil
liam Shockley's Feb. 3 quantum
mechanics will resume today at 9 a.m.
at the North Santa Clara County
Courthouse in Palo Alto.
Shockley is expected to take the
stand for the prosecution today in the
misdemeanor trial. Municipal Court
Judge Sidney Feinberg will preside.
The eight are charged with disturb
ing the peace, wearing a mask in the
commission of a misdemeanor, and
trespassing with the intent to obstruct.
They allegedly appeared in Shock
ley's class dressed in Ku Klux Klan
hoods and robes, and prevented
Shockley from conducting his class.

others to join him in talking with the
two officers. There were about ten
people in the tiny interview room, and
others listened in the adjacent corri
dor.
Car Attacked
While Erickson and Morris were at
the Center, their car had its windshield
smashed by three projectiles, and had
two tires flattened. It was parked next
to the Free Campus Movement head
quarters on Lane B. A Viet Cong flag
was left on the hood.
The two recruiters, from the Ala
meda Naval Air Station, had five
interviews scheduled. One student met
the recruiters briefly as the protesters
were entering the building.
The remaining four interviews were
with persons associated with the
protest — Berkowitz, Rosie Wolf, Don
Zweig, and Peter Knutson. Berkowitz
and Wolf, at the morning session,
requested "open interviews" at which
fellow protesters could join them in
questioning the recruiters.
Zweig and Knutson were scheduled
for afternoon interviews, but neither
they nor the Navy officers were at the
Center in the afternoon.
The Navy recruiters are slated to
return to the Center today, but as of
last night no students had requested
appointments with them. They had
been informed of this, and Placement
Center Director Ralph Keller and
Frances Holtslander, Supervisor of
Recruitment, were uncertain as to
whether they would appear.
Zweig said that, to his knowledge,
there were no plans for a demonstra
tion at the Center today.
Coast Guard
Yesterday at about 8:45 a.m.,
Ensign Dan Wilson of the Coast Guard
arrived to conduct one interview. Met
by the crowd and informed of last
spring's student referendum against
military recruiting and the Committee
on Student Services (COSS) report

recommending the same, he talked for
a few minutes to demonstrators and
then left the scene.
He declined Harrington's offer to
escort him into the building.
'Expected Protest'
Erickson said he "sort of expected"
a demonstration. Another Naval Avia
tion recruiter, Lt. (j.g.) Kenneth
Santoro, was blocked from entering
the Center last February.
Santoro had made no attempt to
enter after being confronted. "If I
hadn't had support [from Harrington
and Lillie], I wouldn't have tried to
get in either," Erickson said.
He admitted that "I don't think
we'll get much accomplished today."
Vietnam Policy
Despite their protests that "we're
not here to discuss United States
Vietnam policy," the recruiters did
make some comments on it in
answering demonstrators' questions.
"If I didn't believe what we do in
Vietnam was right, in good taste, I
wouldn't be here," Morris said.
Wilson, the Coast Guard recruiter,
said he was not aware of plans for the
demonstration. Protester Kwonping
Ho accused University officials of
"deceiving" recruiters by not telling
them of the referendum and COSS
report recommending against military
recruiting.
The crowd had begun to gather at 7
a.m. By 11 a.m., it had largely
dispersed.
It included members of Columbae
House, the Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement, and the Association of
Young Crows.
Meanwhile, the trial of eight persons
accused of disrupting Professor Wil
liam Shockley's Feb. 3 quantum
mechanics will resume today at 9 a.m.
at the North Santa Clara County
Courthouse in Palo Alto.
Shockley is expected to take the
stand for the prosecution today in the
misdemeanor trial. Municipal Court
Judge Sidney Feinberg will preside.
The eight are charged with disturb
ing the peace, wearing a mask in the
commission of a misdemeanor, and
trespassing with the intent to obstruct.
They allegedly appeared in Shock
ley's class dressed in Ku Klux Klan
hoods and robes, and prevented
Shockley from conducting his class.

SLASHED—WhiIe recruiters from the Alameda Naval Air Station forced their way into the Placement Center to conduct
interviews yesterday, their government automobile was trashed. A Coast Guard recruiter who also appeared yesterday
declined to enter the Center under threat of disruptions.
Two Naval Aviation recruiters forc
ed their way into the Placement
Center yesterday morning, pushing
aside a crowd of demonstrators. Later
in the morning, vandals attacked their
car.
The two shoved their way into the
Center with the assistance of campus
Public Safety Director Marvin Harring
ton and security officer Donald Lillie.
Earlier, a Coast Guard recruiter
confronted by the 50 protesters left
without attempting to enter the
building.
Inside, the Navy recruiters discussed
the Indochina War with protesters. No
interviews were disrupted.
Shoving Match
Lt. John Erickson and Lt. (j.g.) Ray
Morris arrived about 9:35 a.m. Har
rington met them in the bookstore
parking lot and escorted them to the
Center entrance. As he and Lillie

began to shove their way through the
crowd blocking the door, Harrington
warned the demonstrators that they
were subject to arrest.
With some difficulty the outward
opening doors were opened, and the
recruiters entered, followed immedi
ately by the protesters.
Michael Berkowitz, one of the
demonstrators, was scheduled for a
9:30 a.m. interview, and he invited
others to join him in talking with the
two officers. There were about ten

been informed of this, and Placement
Center Director Ralph Keller and
Frances Holtslander, Supervisor of
Recruitment, were uncertain as to
whether they would appear.
Zweig said that, to his knowledge,
there were no plans for a demonstra
tion at the Center today.
Coast Guard
Yesterday at about 8:45 a.m.,
Ensign Dan Wilson of the Coast Guard
arrived to conduct one interview. Met
by the crowd and informed of last
spring's student referendum against
military recruiting and the Committee
on Student Services (COSS) report

recommending the same, he talked for
a few minutes to demonstrators and
then left the scene.
He declined Harrington's offer to
escort him into the building.
'Expected Protest'
Erickson said he "sort of expected"
a demonstration. Another Naval Avia
tion recruiter, Lt. (j.g.) Kenneth
Santoro, was blocked from entering
the Center last February.
Santoro had made no attempt to
enter after being confronted. "If I
hadn't had support [from Harrington
and Lillie], I wouldn't have tried to
get in either," Erickson said.
He admitted that "I don't think
we'll get much accomplished today."
Vietnam Policy
Despite their protests that "we're
not here to discuss United States
Vietnam policy," the recruiters did
make some comments on it in
answering demonstrators' questions.
"If I didn't believe what we do in
Vietnam was right, in good taste, I
wouldn't be here," Morris said.
Wilson, the Coast Guard recruiter,
said he was not aware of plans for the
demonstration. Protester Kwonping
Ho accused University officials of
"deceiving" recruiters by not telling
them of the referendum and COSS
report recommending against military
recruiting.
The crowd had begun to gather at 7
a.m. By 11 a.m., it had largely
dispersed.
It included members of Columbae
House, the Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement, and the Association of
Young Crows.
Meanwhile, the trial of eight persons
accused of disrupting Professor Wil
liam Shockley's Feb. 3 quantum
mechanics will resume today at 9 a.m.
at the North Santa Clara County
Courthouse in Palo Alto.
Shockley is expected to take the
stand for the prosecution today in the
misdemeanor trial. Municipal Court
Judge Sidney Feinberg will preside.
The eight are charged with disturb
ing the peace, wearing a mask in the
commission of a misdemeanor, and
trespassing with the intent to obstruct.
They allegedly appeared in Shock
ley's class dressed in Ku Klux Klan
hoods and robes, and prevented
Shockley from conducting his class.
