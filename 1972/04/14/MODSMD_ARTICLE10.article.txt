## A 						Weekly Presidency fund needed programs 
### 
Many Stanford students are
disillusioned with the ASSU
Presidency. Past ASSU Presidents
have used the office as a platform
to promote their own special
interests and political ideology.
Important student problems have
been ignored by ASSU Presidents;
students with imaginative ideas,
but without the time or charisma
necessary to be elected to an
ASSU office, have had little
prospect of ever seeing their ideas
acted upon by the ASSU
President. Admittedly, the ASSU
President has little constitutional
power, but he is in a position to
promote specific proposals from
the student community.
In order to make the ASSU
Presidency more responsive to the
needs of the student community,
we propose that there be a new
Acting ASSU President each week
of the school year selected from
volunteers for the position. The
"officially-elected" President and

Vice-President would serve as
informational and procedural
advisors to the Acting President
but would not push any
proposals. The office of Acting
President would give many
students with imaginative ideas an
opportunity to implement them.
Students with innovative
proposals, but too busy to run for
an ASSU office and serve for an
entire school year, almost
certainly could find enough time
to serve as Acting President for
one or two weeks.
During his weekly term, the
Acting President would have the
opportunity to negotiate with the
Administration in an official
capacity, to introduce legislation
in the ASSU Senate, and to
appoint ASSU committees
(including himself if he chooses)
whose tenure could extend
beyond the end of his weekly
term. For example, an Acting
President could appoint an ASSU
committee to investigate a
problem affecting the student
community such as inadeauate
on-campus graduate housing or
the unequal male/female
admissions ratio. Or an Acting
President might appoint a
committee to supervise a student
project such as a course review, a
"Nader's Raiders" type
investigation group, or a speaker
series. Of course, any
Presidentially-appointed
committee would have to raise
any funds it needed from sources
other than the ASSU President's
office.
Our detailed proposal follows:
Selection Procedure: Each
Monday an agenda will be
published in the Daily listing
committee appointments,
speaking engagements, etc. for the
following Monday through
Sunday. Any interested student
may sign up to be Acting ASSU
President for that term. If more
than one person signs up, those
signing up will select the Acting
President from among themselves
at a meeting on the Wednesday
preceding the term. The "official"
President will supervise this
meeting, but will not participate
in the actual selection. If more
than 50 students sign up, the
selection will be postponed to
Friday, and notice will be printed

in the Daily stating that ail
registered students may vote at
the ASSU office on this decision
of general importance. Each
individual will be limited to two
weeks in office.
Money: The ASSU Presidency
receives $1500 yearly from the
University and no funds from any
other source. This sum will be
used for office expenses and will
be divided evenly such that each
Acting President receives the same
amount during his term (less than
$50 per week). For project
financing the Acting President
must solicit other sources.
Duties of the Acting President:
The "official" President delegates
to the Acting President all the
powers and duties given to him in
Article 111 of the ASSU
Constitution except the
Presidential veto, which the
"official" President will retain and
never use (to prevent its abuse).

President could appoint an ASSU
committee to investigate a
problem affecting the student
community such as inadeauate
on-campus graduate housing or
the unequal male/female
admissions ratio. Or an Acting
President might appoint a
committee to supervise a student
project such as a course review, a
"Nader's Raiders" type
investigation group, or a speaker
series. Of course, any
Presidentially-appointed
committee would have to raise
any funds it needed from sources
other than the ASSU President's
office.
Our detailed proposal follows:
Selection Procedure: Each
Monday an agenda will be
published in the Daily listing
committee appointments,
speaking engagements, etc. for the
following Monday through
Sunday. Any interested student
may sign up to be Acting ASSU
President for that term. If more
than one person signs up, those
signing up will select the Acting
President from among themselves
at a meeting on the Wednesday
preceding the term. The "official"
President will supervise this
meeting, but will not participate
in the actual selection. If more
than 50 students sign up, the
selection will be postponed to
Friday, and notice will be printed

rudick-douglas

in the Daily stating that ail
registered students may vote at
the ASSU office on this decision
of general importance. Each
individual will be limited to two
weeks in office.
Money: The ASSU Presidency
receives $1500 yearly from the
University and no funds from any
other source. This sum will be
used for office expenses and will
be divided evenly such that each
Acting President receives the same
amount during his term (less than
$50 per week). For project
financing the Acting President
must solicit other sources.
Duties of the Acting President:
The "official" President delegates
to the Acting President all the
powers and duties given to him in
Article 111 of the ASSU
Constitution except the
Presidential veto, which the
"official" President will retain and
never use (to prevent its abuse).

Many Stanford students are
disillusioned with the ASSU
Presidency. Past ASSU Presidents
have used the office as a platform
to promote their own special
interests and political ideology.
Important student problems have
been ignored by ASSU Presidents;
students with imaginative ideas,
but without the time or charisma
necessary to be elected to an
ASSU office, have had little
prospect of ever seeing their ideas
acted upon by the ASSU
President. Admittedly, the ASSU
President has little constitutional
power, but he is in a position to
promote specific proposals from
the student community.
In order to make the ASSU
Presidency more responsive to the
needs of the student community,
we propose that there be a new
Acting ASSU President each week
of the school year selected from
volunteers for the position. The
"officially-elected" President and

Vice-President would serve as
informational and procedural
advisors to the Acting President
but would not push any
proposals. The office of Acting
President would give many
students with imaginative ideas an
opportunity to implement them.
Students with innovative
proposals, but too busy to run for
an ASSU office and serve for an
entire school year, almost
certainly could find enough time
to serve as Acting President for
one or two weeks.
During his weekly term, the
Acting President would have the
opportunity to negotiate with the
Administration in an official
capacity, to introduce legislation
in the ASSU Senate, and to
appoint ASSU committees
(including himself if he chooses)
whose tenure could extend
beyond the end of his weekly
term. For example, an Acting
President could appoint an ASSU
committee to investigate a
problem affecting the student
community such as inadeauate
on-campus graduate housing or
the unequal male/female
admissions ratio. Or an Acting
President might appoint a
committee to supervise a student
project such as a course review, a
