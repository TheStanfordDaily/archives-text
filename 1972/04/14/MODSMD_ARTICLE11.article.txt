# Afro-American Fee Vital
## 
### 
There are several well founded reasons why the
Black Students Union of Stanford University is
seeking a "YES" vote for the Afro-American
Program Special Assessment.
One reason is that never in the history of
Stanford University has any group or organization
attempted to implement a program which would
serve to bring notable, knowledgeable Black
speakers and dignitaries to the Stanford campus for
the benefit of the entire Stanford community.
Never before has any group or organization
attempted to implement a program which would
serve to enlighten the entire Stanford community to
the plight of Black people in America. It is our
intention to educate the entire Stanford community
on such matters as, for instance, understanding our
culture. When speaking of culture, we must not
limit ourselves merely to forms of artistic
achievement.
When we say culture, we mean the values, the
feeling and the life styles as expressed by Black
people in everyday life.
The nature of the Afro-American Program is to
provide the entire Stanford community with a first
hand knowledge of events and activities which
directly relate to the Black experience. The one (1)
dollar fee assessment will be divided into four areas
of activities.
a. The one dollar assessment would enable us to
bring dynamic speakers such as Rev. Jesse Jackson,
Julian Bond, Dick Gregory, Rev. Ralph Abernathy,
Mrs. Coretta Scott King, Angela Davis, Betty
Shabayz, Shirley Chisholm, to speak not only on
issues of relevance to the Black community, but
moreover, the effects of these issues on America as a
whole.
b. The second area in which the money will be
used is to provide Black entertainment as well as
cultural activities for the entire Stanford
community. This would include an Afro-American
Cultural Festival, Black artist, Black musicians,
Black poets, photography, art exhibits, dancers, and
a variety of African foods.
There would be a Black film festival much
different than any ever seen before. Films from the
1930's with Black producers, directors, and actors
will be shown. Contemporary Black films and
documentaries will be shown to the entire Stanford

community. The Assessment would allow us to
bring in Black artists in many fields (drama, music,
art, literature, photography, etc.) to display their
work and perform their skills and to lecture on
subjects related to their work.
Perhaps several of these artists could lead
seminars in their respective areas. Such artists as
Don L. Lee, poet, Larry Neale, writer, Miles Davis,
musician, Ameer Imama Baraka, poet-writer, Bill
Cosby, comedian, Redd Foxx, comedian, and other
talented artists would also be available to the
Stanford Student Body.
c. A third area in which the funds would be used
is that of communications. The Real News would
publicize all coming events and also carry feature
stories of the success of such events.
The publication would be available to all
Stanford students. A Black student literary
magazine would also emerge from this assessment
expressing the feelings of Blacks concerning
situations on campus.
d. The fourth area would be to provide an
opportunity for the children in the Black
community to have mere dreams become realities.
The opportunity for Black children to see such note
worthy Black leaders and artists which I have
mentioned is a dream come true. These children are
faced with hunger, anger, hostilities, and the most
damaging force conceivable, neglect.
A portion of the assessment would be used to
provide transportation for the children to and from
our activities, provide them with hot meals, and to
teach them needed skills in understanding their
culture.
We feel that the educational values of the
Afro-American Program Special Assessment are
tremendous. We feel that such a program is
necessary and very worthwhile. In terms of fee
assessments, ours is the least expensive, one dollar,
one quarter, for one hell of a program.
The Afro-American Program Special Fee
Assessment is also refundable if you want your
money back. Won't you vote YES on the
Afro-American Program Special Fee Assessment?
Remember VOTE YES for one dollar fall quarter
1972-73 for the Afro-American Program Special Fee
Assessment. ,
