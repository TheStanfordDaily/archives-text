## Close Entertainment Gap 
### 
For ASSU-
President: "Wild Bill" Legard
Vice-President: Jeff Wyden
All the other candidates for
ASSU Council of Presidents have
ignored the most important
on-campus issue today: THE
ENTERTAINMENT GAP. How
many wild-and-wooly week-ends
have we seen lately. How many
new people have really met? Face
it. Stanford night life makes
Foothill look like Saturday night
in Vegas. There's just no place
where people can get together and
git-it-on. Let's get out shit
together and do something about
it now.
FREE, LIVE BANDS ON
CAMPUS. We can have live bands
on campus â€” for free! The way
things are now, we chuck out
$5000 to go here, yet you can't
hardly find any live entertainment
unless you crash a private party.
The Sunday Sun-Bursts that
occasionally appear are the best
things I've seen so far, but that's
not nearly enough. It saves a few
afternoons, but doesn't salvage
Friday and Saturday nights.
There's quite a few bands in the
area that are more than willing to
do a free gig for exposure. We can
get something going at TVesidder,
White Plaza, or up at the lake; and
it wouldn't cost a cent. Note: We
wouldn't need any fee

assessments!
REOPEN FROST FOR ROCK
CONCERTS. Since last summer,
rock concerts have been declared
strickly taboo at Frost
Amphitheater. A security problem
has been the excuse. Let's reopen
Frost immediately! It's probably
the finest facility around for
listening to good, live music. Let's
put it to use.
We can get free music going on
Saturday or Sunday afternoons,
and there's more than a fair share
of top-name talent up for playing
there. As you probably know,
Garcia and the Dead wanted to
put on a FREE concert out at
Frost. The University said
forget-it!
And you wonder why we
haven't had much in the way of
concerts this year. Remember the
fine times out at Frost last year?

Santana did a free gig last spring.
Let's get it going again.
OTHER ENTERTAINMENTS
IMPROVEMENTS. There's
actually no limit to the number of
improvements we can make on
campus this upcoming year. First
off, let's establish a 50-50
male-female admissions policy;
incoming freshmen and transfer
students. That's guaranteed
to improve the entertainment
everywhere.
We can bring on campus some
good, popular speakers; and push
for more top-quality lecture series
like the excellent Symposium on
Imperialism. There's many more
possibilities.
Let's close the
ENTERTAINMENT GAP now,
while we can still get-it-on!
("Wild Bill" Legard and Jeff
Wyden.)
