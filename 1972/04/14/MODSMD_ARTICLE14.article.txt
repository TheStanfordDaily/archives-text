Editor, THE DAILY:
When most people think of the
Air War, we think of B-52's,
anti-aircraft guns, bombs, and
rockets. We don't think of
electronics. But "Electronic
Warfare" (EW) is one of the most
important elements of Air War.
Electronic Warfare has one
general purpose—to neutralize
"enemy" anti-aircraft defenses.
The most common types of EW
now in use in Indochina are
devices which deceive and confuse
North Vietnamese radar, and
equipment which directs U.S.
rockets at North Vietnamese
anti-aircraft sites.
Electronic Warfare is a rapidly
advancing science, as both sides
improve their technologies to stay
ahead of their opponent's newest
techniques. The U.S. could not
bomb North Vietnam without the
latest electronic warfare
technologies.
Microwave research—and

specifically microwave acoustics
research—is integral to electronic
warfare. And Stanford houses the
Hansen Labs, the world foremost
center for microwave acoustics
research (if we are to believe
Marvin Chodorow, the lab's
director).
The applied military research
at Hansen, under direction of
Professor Chodorow and
researcher H.J. Shaw, is not
designing actual electronic warfare
equipment. But it is designing
components which the military
needs to reduce the size and
improve the efficiency of its
electronic warfare devices.
Who says so?
For one, the military. The
Defense Documentation Center
describes Shaw's Navy contract:
"Investigations leading to
extending the usefulness of
microwave acoustic surface waves
into new areas likely to produce
new devices for electronic
countermeasures applications."
"Electronic Countermeasures"

means electronic warfare—radar
jamming.
Industry reports the same. The
October, 1971 issue of
Microwaves Magazine contains an
article "Surface Acoustic Waves:
New Processing Tools for EW."
Not only does this article explain
the relevance of microwave
acoustics research to warfare, but
it speci fi cal ly cites
D.0.D.-sponsored research carried
out at Stanford's Hansen Labs.
Hansen researchers are not
warmongers. No doubt they
would prefer to see their work
used for peaceful purposes. But
the military is the primary buyer
of Microwave technology, and
Indochina is a Microwave War.
With the U.S. willing to use
any amount of airpower to delay
defeat—already thp War is
history's heaviest bombing
campaign—the war could go on
indefinitely.
Only if the American people
make it impossible for the
government to wage war will war

stop. Hansen labs would only be a
small step.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Sultan Bhimjee and Bill
Buckland's rvcent letter to the
Daily raises objections to Citizens
Advocates at Stanford on two
counts: first, no provision is made
for recall of Board members in the
event they turn out to be evil; and
second, the Board of Directors as
designed supposedly cannot
represent the community.
While the structure of Citizens
Advocates certainly should receive
close scrutiny from all of us, these
particular criticisms don't stand
up under rudimentary analysis.
Rather, they seem to reflect a
spirit of negativism which
translates into community
paralysis—i.e. you can nit pick
anything to pieces.
On the matter of recall, it
hardly needs to be pointed out

that recall historically has been an
incredibly cumbersome,
ineffective technique of popular
control. Very few recall initiatives
ever succeed, and they are
expensive and time consuming.
When Board members serve
only one year, three months of
which most students aren't
around, the idea of a recall
process looks totally impractical.
More important, however, is that
students have a much, much more
effective method to keep Citizens
Advocates in line. Should the
project turn into a boondoggle,
students simply refund their fees.
No threat of recall could match
this "power of the purse" veto
potential.
Second, the Board of Directors
of Citizens Advocates is designed
to achieve two things: majority
student representation so that the
organization will respond to
student concerns, and enough
technical and professional
knowledge to enable the Board to
make well informed decisions on
legal matters.
Admittedly, there is also a not
unimportant goal of attracting
foundation money to supplement
student contributions, and this
requires a certain amount of
"professional" image. Yet,
professionalism does not mean
that the non-student members are
unable to represent the
community. Those named so far
bring an incredible inventory of
proven contributions in the fields
of civil liberties, consumer
protection, environmental law,
and poverty services. Of course,
there are millions of permutations
possible in arranging a board of
directors. The one proposed
probably satisfies few as the
absolute ideal, but it's not a bad
compromise and it seems to be
workable. What more could you
ask?
However you decide to vote on
Citizens Advocates, don't allow
yourself to be tricked on bogus
issues.
