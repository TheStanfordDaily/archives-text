# Lobster Catches Plummet While Prices Skyrocket
## 
### 
(AP)—The New England lobster,
traditionally the premier specialty
in American seafood restaurants,
has become so scarce that the
resultant skyrocketing prices have
driven it off the menu in many
restaurants and to the top of the

price list in others.
The Hotel Nova Scotia in
Halifax nearly tripled the price of
its lobster dinner to $19 just
before Christmas. Other
restaurants are not r ar behind and
many of those who still carry
lobster insist it's a money-losing
proposition.
Wholesale dealers say they'd be
glad to drop the prices if they 1
could, but there just aren't many
lobsters in captivity now and
demand has driven up the price.
And until lobstermen, who last
week once again began setting
their traps off the New England
coast, start hauling in appreciable
catches, the situation is not likely
to change significantly.
Some restaurant owners accuse
the lobstermen of putting on "the
squeeze."
However if anyone is putting
the "squeeze on," the lobstermen

say it isn't them.
'There's not a pea pickin'
pound in Nova Scotia that has a
lobster in it," said a Halifax
dealer, explaining that the
demand has stripped the storage
oounds.
