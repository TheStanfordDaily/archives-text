# Financial Cutbacks Hurting Archive Of Recorded Sound
## 
### VALERIE TONAT 
A penniless stepchild to the Music Library,
Stanford's Archive of Recorded Sound is largely a
neglected resource.
Located in what was once the banquet kitchen of
the Knoll, the archive is a collection of 100,000 wax
cylinders, discs, rolls and tapes covering the history
of recorded sound.
Besides original recordings of Caruso, Tetrazzini
and Maurice Chevalier in the 1930'5, one can hear
King Edward's abdication speech, David Starr
Jordan's "Spirit of Stanford" address from 1916,
and authentic radio broadcasts of "Inner Sanctum."
However the archive, still uncatalogued, lost all
its funds last December in the University wide
budget cuts.
Lack of Funds
Unopened boxes containing 20,000 discs
donated by radio station KFAC are sitting in the
stacks, since Edward Linotti, the assistant archivist
and only full-time staff member, was forced to
resign last fall due to lack of funds. Edward Colby,
head of the Music Library, manages the archive in
his free time.
The archive must now rely on donations from
outside the university, Colby says. "But it's hard to
find the time to get out to cocktail parties and meet
the right people," he sighed.
Inspiration
The archive was the inspiration of William R.
Moran, vice-president and general manager of
Mineral Exploration Co., who graduated from
Stanford in 1942.
He plans to donate his more than 40,000
recordings to the archive after he dies. "I don't want

my collection scattered or tossed out when I die,"
he explained.
In 1958, after several years of trying to convince
Stanford of the value of an historical collection, the
archive was founded. It is one of five or six major
archives of its kind in the United States.
At this time the archive is termed a "limited
access collection", available only to faculty and
graduate students.
Most of the recordings are music, evenly divided
between popular and classical, but the collection
also includes such things as political speeches,
dramatic readings, and a group of radio broadcasts
from World War II recorded by Roy Pryor of Palo
Alto.
Wide Potential
Colby notes that the collection is quite
comprehensive and has a wide potential.
In the study of classical music it could lend
insight on the effect of time on performances and
interpretation, giving the student a greater
understanding of a specific piece or period, he said.
The archive's recordings of speeches and cultural
details of various periods give a dimension of reality
and understanding to the study of history and
politics that books and other written materials
cannot convey, Colby points out.
The archive has also been used to supply
background music for films. And, of course, it could
obviously be useful in the study of the history of
popular and folk music and the general history of
recordings, Colby adds.
The archive also has an entertainment potential,
but this is a possibility which seems to be a long
way off, he concluded.
