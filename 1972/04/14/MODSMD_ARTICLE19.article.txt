An 18-month planning and
exploratory study of mercury
water pollution in the South San
Francisco Bay area has been
undertaken by scientists here
under a $210,000 grant from the
National Science Foundation.
The investigators, from the
Schools of Earth Sciences and
Engineering, want to find out how
much mercury enters the
environment from natural sources
and how man's activities affect its
quantity and distribution.
'The South San Francisco Bay
region is ideal for the study
because it includes the New
Almaden Mercury Mining district
which has been the most
productive single mercury
producing area in the U. 5.," said
Frank W. Dickson, geology
professor, one of four
investigators contributing to the
project.
"Furthermore, because the
region includes mineralized areas
which are relatively undeveloped
and other mineralized areas now
in the heart of urban
developments, it should be
possible to assess the influence of
man on pollution from natural
sources."
