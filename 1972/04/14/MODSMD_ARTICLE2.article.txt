# Independence Nears
## 'Daily' Pub Board Request Cash 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Promising that complete indepen
dence is just around the corner, the
Daily is asking students for a $1 fee
assessment for winter, spring and
summer quarters of 1973 in next
week's election.
The proposal will be coupled on
next Tuesday's ASSU ballot with a $1
assessment for the ASSU Publications
Board during fall quarter. The Pub
Board money will be used for a two
year period.
The Publications Board is composed
of the Daily, the Chaparral, the
Sequoia, the Blotter, and the Quad.
The Daily has been working for
independence for 18 months, and legal
ties with the University and the ASSU
will be cut this June. Daily editor
Frank Miller says that he hopes for
total financial independence within
two years.
Ad Revenue Increase
"We can't guarantee it, of course,
but unless something catastrophic like
a depression happened, we're pretty
sure of it," Miller said. He added that
independence would require an annual
increase in ad revenue of about 10
percent.
The Daily asked for $3 the last
academic year and $4 this year. Next
year's proposed assessment would
total about $26,000, compared with
$49,000 students paid this year.
The fee assessment has a refund
option each quarter. Since the Pub
Board asks for money for different
quarters than does the Daily, refunds
will be available separately for the
Daily and the Pub Board. For instance,

students who read the Daily but don't
read the other publications can get
their Pub Board money back fall
quarter since the Daily only receives
the money during winter, spring, and
summer.
'The whole key to this assessment
comes in the move for independence,"
Miller said. "The Daily has been asking
for money for two years based on
promises that independence was com
ing, and this is the first concrete move
that they [students] have seen."
$1 In 1974
He said the Daily intends to ask for
$1 for one quarter in 1974, and—
hopefully—no more.

Fee Assessment

"The reason all this money is
necessary is that we have to build up a
reserve fund," Miller said. "It would
be unrealistic to just go independent
with no money to back us up. What if
we lost $5000 one year? We would be
bankrupt."
He said the Daily hopes to have a
$35,000 cash reserve with a yearly
budget just under $200,000 when it
goes financially independent. Right
now, in addition to student money,
the University itself buys 3000 sub
scriptions for faculty and staff at an
annual cost of $16,500. That practice
will end when the Daily goes financial
ly independent.
While the Daily is part of the
Publications Board, none of the
$12,000 the Pub Board collects will go
to the Daily.

The Pub Board intends to use the
money from the assessment over two
years and won't ask for any more
funds until 1974, at the earliest.
Placing Advertisements
About 30 percent of the money will
be used in remodeling parts of the
Storke Student Publications Building
and setting up a common phone line
for placing advertisements with any
Pub Board member.
Another 30 percent will be used as
"seed money" to enable the Chaparral,
the Sequoia, and -if a workable plan is
presented—the Quad to publish on a
regular basis. The rest of the money
will be used to help new publications
get started.
None of the money will go to pay
back debts of any publication, includ
ing the $8000 now owed by the Quad.
* 'Keeps Us Honest'
"We feel we need publications at
this University to keep an eye on the
Daily," Miller said, explaining why the
two assessments were linked. "It keeps
us honest; we can only get better if we
know other people are looking over

our shoulder."
Miller said that he thought the
reason the Pub Board wanted to be on
the ballot with the Daily was "pretty
obvious. They think they stand a
better chance of winning when they
are tie; up with us."
The assessments were nearly severed
yesterday after an angry Pub Board
meeting marked by hot exchanges
between representatives of the Daily
and the Chaparral. Daily reporters had
obtained copies of a large Chaparral
bill, and Miller asked for a full
accounting of debts and assets of the
news magazine. The Chaparral refused,
and Miller threatened to ask the
Student Senate to break apart the two
proposals.
But later in the afternoon he
indicated that the Chaparral had
convinced him of its good faith and
that he was willing to continue to
support the proposal.
'They convinced me that they were
essentially within $100 or so of the
break-even point, and had more
money coming in later," Miller said.

bankrupt."
He said the Daily hopes to have a
$35,000 cash reserve with a yearly
budget just under $200,000 when it
goes financially independent. Right
now, in addition to student money,
the University itself buys 3000 sub
scriptions for faculty and staff at an
annual cost of $16,500. That practice
will end when the Daily goes financial
ly independent.
While the Daily is part of the
Publications Board, none of the
$12,000 the Pub Board collects will go
to the Daily.

The Pub Board intends to use the
money from the assessment over two
years and won't ask for any more
funds until 1974, at the earliest.
Placing Advertisements
About 30 percent of the money will
be used in remodeling parts of the
Storke Student Publications Building
and setting up a common phone line
for placing advertisements with any
Pub Board member.
Another 30 percent will be used as
"seed money" to enable the Chaparral,
the Sequoia, and -if a workable plan is
presented—the Quad to publish on a
regular basis. The rest of the money
will be used to help new publications
get started.
None of the money will go to pay
back debts of any publication, includ
ing the $8000 now owed by the Quad.
* 'Keeps Us Honest'
"We feel we need publications at
this University to keep an eye on the
Daily," Miller said, explaining why the
two assessments were linked. "It keeps
us honest; we can only get better if we
know other people are looking over

our shoulder."
Miller said that he thought the
reason the Pub Board wanted to be on
the ballot with the Daily was "pretty
obvious. They think they stand a
better chance of winning when they
are tie; up with us."
The assessments were nearly severed
yesterday after an angry Pub Board
meeting marked by hot exchanges
between representatives of the Daily
and the Chaparral. Daily reporters had
obtained copies of a large Chaparral
bill, and Miller asked for a full
accounting of debts and assets of the
news magazine. The Chaparral refused,
and Miller threatened to ask the
Student Senate to break apart the two
proposals.
But later in the afternoon he
indicated that the Chaparral had
convinced him of its good faith and
that he was willing to continue to
support the proposal.
'They convinced me that they were
essentially within $100 or so of the
break-even point, and had more
money coming in later," Miller said.
Promising that complete indepen
dence is just around the corner, the
Daily is asking students for a $1 fee
assessment for winter, spring and
summer quarters of 1973 in next
week's election.
The proposal will be coupled on
next Tuesday's ASSU ballot with a $1
assessment for the ASSU Publications
Board during fall quarter. The Pub
Board money will be used for a two
year period.
The Publications Board is composed
of the Daily, the Chaparral, the
Sequoia, the Blotter, and the Quad.
The Daily has been working for
independence for 18 months, and legal
ties with the University and the ASSU
will be cut this June. Daily editor
Frank Miller says that he hopes for
total financial independence within
two years.
Ad Revenue Increase
"We can't guarantee it, of course,
but unless something catastrophic like
a depression happened, we're pretty
sure of it," Miller said. He added that
independence would require an annual
increase in ad revenue of about 10
percent.
The Daily asked for $3 the last
academic year and $4 this year. Next
year's proposed assessment would
total about $26,000, compared with
$49,000 students paid this year.
The fee assessment has a refund
option each quarter. Since the Pub
Board asks for money for different
quarters than does the Daily, refunds
will be available separately for the
Daily and the Pub Board. For instance,

students who read the Daily but don't
read the other publications can get
their Pub Board money back fall
quarter since the Daily only receives
the money during winter, spring, and
summer.
'The whole key to this assessment
comes in the move for independence,"
Miller said. "The Daily has been asking
for money for two years based on
promises that independence was com
ing, and this is the first concrete move
that they [students] have seen."
$1 In 1974
He said the Daily intends to ask for
$1 for one quarter in 1974, and—
hopefully—no more.

Fee Assessment

"The reason all this money is
necessary is that we have to build up a
reserve fund," Miller said. "It would
be unrealistic to just go independent
with no money to back us up. What if
we lost $5000 one year? We would be
bankrupt."
