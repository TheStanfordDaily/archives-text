# Financial, Legal Independence
## Agreement Near On 'Daily' Status 
### FRED MANN 
An agreement is in the works
between the Daily and the
University administration which,
when completed, will make the
Daily an independent student-run
newspaper, legally and financially
separate from Stanford
University, according to Frank
Miller, editor of the Daily.
The legal move to
independence is expected to be
completed by September of this
year when the Daily files
documents with the State
establishing itself as a California
non-profit corporation.
The eventual financial
independence of the Daily will
mean a newspaper existing solely
on advertising revenue and
distributed free on campus. Miller
said. Currently, students pay four
dollars a year for the paper.
The Daily's current "owner
and publisher" is the ASSU but
Miller explains that the Daily is
actually "completely editorially
independent from the ASSU." A
new corporation publishing the
Daily would "free both the ASSU
and the University from any and
all legal obligations and
entanglements with the paper,"
according to Miller.
Financial Ties
But the legal move will not end
all financial ties with the
University and the ASSU. That
will take an estimated three years,
according to Miller and that is
what still needs to be negotiated.
"We have yet to agree on the
specific financial arrangements for
a transition period before the
Daily will be available free to the
Stanford community and
hopefully existing solely on
advertising income," Bill Stone,
assistant to the President said.
Stone said the University and
the Daily had agreed "in
principle" that the Daily can
incorporate with licenses to use
the Stanford name, to use the
building the paper now occupies
for certain fees, and to distribute
the newspaper on campus.
Details Left
"There are many details to be
wrapped up," Stone said. "But I
don't anticipate any problems."
He said he hopes to "put
everything to rest within the next

few weeks" although the financial
arrangements are not yet finalized
and the current plans have to be
circulated more thoroughly
throughout the University
Administration.
Although terms of the
agreement are not yet final, the
Daily has proposed that it will
submit student fee assessments for
the next two years at a decreasing
rate, and continuation of a
University paid fee for publication
of faculty and staff copies of the
Daily for three years, according to
Miller. The administration is
expected to receive this proposal
formally in writing within the
next few days.
Transition Period
According to the Daily's plan,
after the three year transition
period, the newspaper will exist
solely on advertising revenue as a
free distribution paper. "The
continuation of the fees over the
two and three year periods will
enable the Daily to build up its
advertising income while cutting
office expenses and building
financial reserves," Miller said.
Both the ASSU Publications
Board and the Student Senate will
have to approve any new
relationship.
In earlier discussions of
financial independence the Daily
rejected the concept of selling the
newspaper to students and staff.
"We would have to charge well
over $12 per year for a
subscription, if we went that
way," Miller said. "With all the
added costs of individual delivery
and subscription campaigns, it just
didn't seem worth it. In the long
run, the reader would pay much
more for the Daily and the Daily
would have a much lower
readership."
The issue of Daily
independence, which has been
discussed by student editors and
University presidents as long as
nine years ago, began to be
studied in earnest in October,
1970, when a guest opinion
column published by the
newspaper raised the ire of many
on campus because it appeared to
advocate bodily injury to two
named individuals.
Protesting the publication of
the column President Richard W.

Lyman urged total independence
for the Daily by September of
1971, a goal whieh was not
achieved.
Following the University's
lead, Daily staff members
organized a workshop through
SWOPSI to study the feasibility of
independence.
Brian Hardy, Daily business
manager, explained that
"although it will be difficult to

build up our advertising to the
needed level to exist solely on
that income, it can be done."
Before the newspaper can exist
solely on advertising revenue "we
need a cash reserve," Hardy said.
"I would estimate the minimum
reserve to be about $35,000 cash
which is small when you compare
that to our yearly budget of a little
under $200,000." Over the next
three years Daily business
managers will concentrate on

building up those reserves and
advertising revenue, he said.
"We want to maintain our mass
circulation and reach all the
Stanford community," said Miller.
"The ideal situation for us would
be to have all the bills paid by our
advertisers, not the readers. And
our financial projections show
that this is possible within three
years."

don't anticipate any problems."
He said he hopes to "put
everything to rest within the next

few weeks" although the financial
arrangements are not yet finalized
and the current plans have to be
circulated more thoroughly
throughout the University
Administration.
Although terms of the
agreement are not yet final, the
Daily has proposed that it will
submit student fee assessments for
the next two years at a decreasing
rate, and continuation of a
University paid fee for publication
of faculty and staff copies of the
Daily for three years, according to
Miller. The administration is
expected to receive this proposal
formally in writing within the
next few days.
Transition Period
According to the Daily's plan,
after the three year transition
period, the newspaper will exist
solely on advertising revenue as a
free distribution paper. "The
continuation of the fees over the
two and three year periods will
enable the Daily to build up its
advertising income while cutting
office expenses and building
financial reserves," Miller said.
Both the ASSU Publications
Board and the Student Senate will
have to approve any new
relationship.
In earlier discussions of
financial independence the Daily
rejected the concept of selling the
newspaper to students and staff.
"We would have to charge well
over $12 per year for a
subscription, if we went that
way," Miller said. "With all the
added costs of individual delivery
and subscription campaigns, it just
didn't seem worth it. In the long
run, the reader would pay much
more for the Daily and the Daily
would have a much lower
readership."
The issue of Daily
independence, which has been
discussed by student editors and
University presidents as long as
nine years ago, began to be
studied in earnest in October,
1970, when a guest opinion
column published by the
newspaper raised the ire of many
on campus because it appeared to
advocate bodily injury to two
named individuals.
Protesting the publication of
the column President Richard W.

Lyman urged total independence
for the Daily by September of
1971, a goal whieh was not
achieved.
Following the University's
lead, Daily staff members
organized a workshop through
SWOPSI to study the feasibility of
independence.
Brian Hardy, Daily business
manager, explained that
"although it will be difficult to

build up our advertising to the
needed level to exist solely on
that income, it can be done."
Before the newspaper can exist
solely on advertising revenue "we
need a cash reserve," Hardy said.
"I would estimate the minimum
reserve to be about $35,000 cash
which is small when you compare
that to our yearly budget of a little
under $200,000." Over the next
three years Daily business
managers will concentrate on

building up those reserves and
advertising revenue, he said.
"We want to maintain our mass
circulation and reach all the
Stanford community," said Miller.
"The ideal situation for us would
be to have all the bills paid by our
advertisers, not the readers. And
our financial projections show
that this is possible within three
years."

STARTING EARLY—This little girl is starting early preparing meals
in her cooking career. How can she lose?
An agreement is in the works
between the Daily and the
University administration which,
when completed, will make the
Daily an independent student-run
newspaper, legally and financially
separate from Stanford
University, according to Frank
Miller, editor of the Daily.
The legal move to
independence is expected to be
completed by September of this
year when the Daily files
documents with the State
establishing itself as a California
non-profit corporation.
The eventual financial
independence of the Daily will
mean a newspaper existing solely
on advertising revenue and
distributed free on campus. Miller
said. Currently, students pay four
dollars a year for the paper.
The Daily's current "owner
and publisher" is the ASSU but
Miller explains that the Daily is
actually "completely editorially
independent from the ASSU." A
new corporation publishing the
Daily would "free both the ASSU
and the University from any and
all legal obligations and
entanglements with the paper,"
according to Miller.
Financial Ties
But the legal move will not end
all financial ties with the
University and the ASSU. That
will take an estimated three years,
according to Miller and that is
what still needs to be negotiated.
"We have yet to agree on the
specific financial arrangements for
a transition period before the
Daily will be available free to the
Stanford community and
hopefully existing solely on
advertising income," Bill Stone,
assistant to the President said.
Stone said the University and
the Daily had agreed "in
principle" that the Daily can
incorporate with licenses to use
the Stanford name, to use the
building the paper now occupies
for certain fees, and to distribute
the newspaper on campus.

"There are many details to be
wrapped up," Stone said. "But I

column published by the
newspaper raised the ire of many
on campus because it appeared to
advocate bodily injury to two
named individuals.
Protesting the publication of
the column President Richard W.

Lyman urged total independence
for the Daily by September of
1971, a goal whieh was not
achieved.
Following the University's
lead, Daily staff members
organized a workshop through
SWOPSI to study the feasibility of
independence.
Brian Hardy, Daily business
manager, explained that
"although it will be difficult to

build up our advertising to the
needed level to exist solely on
that income, it can be done."
Before the newspaper can exist
solely on advertising revenue "we
need a cash reserve," Hardy said.
"I would estimate the minimum
reserve to be about $35,000 cash
which is small when you compare
that to our yearly budget of a little
under $200,000." Over the next
three years Daily business
managers will concentrate on

building up those reserves and
advertising revenue, he said.
"We want to maintain our mass
circulation and reach all the
Stanford community," said Miller.
"The ideal situation for us would
be to have all the bills paid by our
advertisers, not the readers. And
our financial projections show
that this is possible within three
years."
