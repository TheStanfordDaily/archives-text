# Stanford Psychologist Asks Better Learning Situation

### 
Dr. Alberta Siegel, Stanford
child psychologist, speaking at the
annual meeting of the American
Educational Research Association
in Chicago last week,
remarked that, "American schools
must dramatically improve the
learning environment they provide
for children and help promote
family strength."
Siegel said that our schools
hold the key to how well
individuals will meet the
requirements of the 21st century
and adapt to changing roles for
men and women.
"Females and males will be
more likely to be alive and well in
century 21 if our schools reform
all aspects of the learning
environment they provide for
children, and if they modify all
their practices to bring them into
line with the continuing viability
and strength of the family," she
said.
Emphasizing the significance of
a child's early learning. Siegel said,
"We must recognize that the most
important learning occurs within
the family, from the people with
whom the child has strong
emotional bonds."
Because of this, she continued,
it is vital for other social
institutions to aid children by
aiding the family. Schools, as
"social institutions which can aid
the family or contribute to its
further deterioration," must be in

the forefront of this movement,
she said.
Siegel listed some suggestions
for American schools. These
included: creating more part-time
positions for women so they
could more easily hold jobs and
also adequately fulfill their
responsibilities as wives and
mothers.
She also suggested that schools
avoid sex-role stereotyping in all
employment fields, and minimize
the barriers to the employment of
spouses by making it easier for
husband and wife teams to work

together at the same institution.
Siegel further called for schools
to encourage more students to
consider careers in the health
professions, and to provide better
health care insurance for all
employees.
By following such suggestions,
Siegel said, schools could become
models for other social
institutions and help eliminate
"the pollution of the family"
caused by geographical dispersal,
industrialization, electronic
communication, and other
technological advances.
