# Hersey's Book Avoids Issues

### GLENN GARVIN 
THE CONSPIRACY. By John
Hersey. Alfred A. Knopf, $6.95,
274 pages.
Does repression breed
resistance? Or is it the other way
around — does resistance breed
repression? John Hersey dangles
that question in front of us for
274 pages in The Conspiracy, and
ultimately sidesteps the issue.
Hersey's newest work deals —
very loosely, from a historical
point of view — with a plot by

Roman philosophers and writers
to assassinate Nero in 65 A.D.
Nero's chief advisor and
hatchetman, Tigellinus and
Paenus, head of the secret police,
suspect that a group of the
Roman cultural elite are
conspiring to kill Nero in the
name of democracy.
The two Romans dig deeper,
increase their surveillance of the
writers, plant agents in their
households, listen carefully to the
street gossip, sifting it for grains
of truth. The evidence begins to
mount: It seems that groups of
the writers indeed intend to revolt
and place one of their own
number on the throne.
But did they originally intend a
revolution? Or were they merely a
handful of discontents, spurred to
action by the abhorrent actions of
the secret police who were
watching them, looking for a
plot?
No Answer
Hersey doesn't answer the
question; indeed he leaves the

question of a plot open — Lucan,
one of the leaders of the
intellectual group, tells police as
they carry out the death sentence
assigned to him: "There hasn't
been any conspiracy, you know,
except the one you people
invented.. . . Now you're
destroying us to justify
yourselves."
One of the curious effects of
this book is the odd sympathies it
forces on the reader. Tigellinus
and Paenus are without a doubt
the sorts of brutes who are
completely lacking in moral sense
and seem to lend themselves so
well to police states. But at least
they realize what they are and
make no pretense of being noble
humanitarians. Rather, the
disgusting characters are those
who profess to act for democracy
ahd human dignity:
Seneca, the vain old man who
wantes to be a Socrates, who
preaches simplicity and self-denial
even as he piles up millions of
gold pieces in his cellar; Lucan,
the poet who has lost his ability
to write and nourishes a grudge
against Nero because the emperor
ousted him from the inner social
circle; Piso, who supports the
conspiracy because he hopes to be
emperor.
These men conspire not only
to kill Nero, but to make the
secret police palatable. They
succeed admirably on the second
count if not the first. And that
success,coupled with the
interesting political question
about repression that the book
poses, has produced a moderate
success for John Hersey.

Hersey's newest work deals —
very loosely, from a historical
point of view — with a plot by

Roman philosophers and writers
to assassinate Nero in 65 A.D.
Nero's chief advisor and
hatchetman, Tigellinus and
Paenus, head of the secret police,
suspect that a group of the
Roman cultural elite are
conspiring to kill Nero in the
name of democracy.
The two Romans dig deeper,
increase their surveillance of the
writers, plant agents in their
households, listen carefully to the
street gossip, sifting it for grains
of truth. The evidence begins to
mount: It seems that groups of
the writers indeed intend to revolt
and place one of their own
number on the throne.
But did they originally intend a
revolution? Or were they merely a
handful of discontents, spurred to
action by the abhorrent actions of
the secret police who were
watching them, looking for a
plot?
No Answer
Hersey doesn't answer the
question; indeed he leaves the

question of a plot open — Lucan,
one of the leaders of the
intellectual group, tells police as
they carry out the death sentence
assigned to him: "There hasn't
been any conspiracy, you know,
except the one you people
invented.. . . Now you're
destroying us to justify
yourselves."
One of the curious effects of
this book is the odd sympathies it
forces on the reader. Tigellinus
and Paenus are without a doubt
the sorts of brutes who are
completely lacking in moral sense
and seem to lend themselves so
well to police states. But at least
they realize what they are and
make no pretense of being noble
humanitarians. Rather, the
disgusting characters are those
who profess to act for democracy
ahd human dignity:
Seneca, the vain old man who
wantes to be a Socrates, who
preaches simplicity and self-denial
even as he piles up millions of
gold pieces in his cellar; Lucan,
the poet who has lost his ability
to write and nourishes a grudge
against Nero because the emperor
ousted him from the inner social
circle; Piso, who supports the
conspiracy because he hopes to be
emperor.
These men conspire not only
to kill Nero, but to make the
secret police palatable. They
succeed admirably on the second
count if not the first. And that
success,coupled with the
interesting political question
about repression that the book
poses, has produced a moderate
success for John Hersey.
THE CONSPIRACY. By John
Hersey. Alfred A. Knopf, $6.95,
274 pages.
Does repression breed
resistance? Or is it the other way
around — does resistance breed
repression? John Hersey dangles
that question in front of us for
274 pages in The Conspiracy, and
ultimately sidesteps the issue.
