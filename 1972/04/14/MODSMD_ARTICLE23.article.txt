# 'Slow Dance': Actors Overcome Script
## 
### DOUG ARTHUR 
The production of Slow Dance
on the Killing Ground, currently
playing at the Nitery, deserves to
be seen for the superb acting job
of the cast. The acting alone
sustains whatever interest the play
might have. As an acting exercise,
the production provides an
exciting evening; the play is
something else again.
The play is set in a small candy
store in Brooklyn around 1962.
Shelves of supplies tower above
the small stage in the Nitery. A
dirty window at the rear of the
stage symbolizes the relationship
between the old German
shopkeeper and the world. A
sandwich bar stands in center
stage and a small table and chair
and a magazine rack limit the
downstage area.
As the play opens, we see the
shopkeeper, in baggy, grey pants
and a vest, slowly taking
inventory of his supplies. He
climbs the ladder painfully to
count the boxes, then down again
to record the numbers — the
action was clear enough, but more
of a sense of physical exhaustion
might be conveyed by sounds,
such as sighing.
Suddenly a young black man
runs in, obviously fleeing
someone. He introduces himself as
Randal, and his appearance is
rather unusual: a beige suit with
tennis shoes, a long, black cape
with blue lining, from which he
pulls out an icepick, matches, and
an electric toothbrush among
other things; sunglasses (it is
around ten at night,) and an um
brella that is sharp enough to stick

into the floor when he leans on it.
Randal Stars
A strong contrast is set up
between Randal, who begins
talking about himself, and the
shopkeeper, who mainly listens.
James Symmons' Randal gives a
stunning series of speeches which
assume different identities for the
character: he assumes a number of
personalities. Mr. Symmons'
rapid-fire, ghetto jive was
particularly enjoyable.
The diversity of the character
created excitement and a certain
amount of fear. The violence of
Randal is often stressed: he stabs
the icepick into the counter, rips
out the telephone, and takes the
shopkeeper's gun. On the other
hand, when he removes his glasses,
he becomes quite eloquent and
constantly alludes to literary

works. Most of the time though
his tone is that of sarcasm and
bitterness.
Randal characterizes the world
outside the store as a killing
ground, and he as a representative
of it. The shopkeeper does not
take an interest in anything
outside his store. The conflict is
instigated by Randal, who
challenges the viewpoint of the
shopkeeper.
The stage action parallels the
language: Randal monopolizes the
stage, while the shopkeeper, Mr.
Glas, has few movements. Indeed,
there may have been too many
quick crosses for Randal,
especially at the beginning of the
play.
Rosie — a Problem
Another character enters
abruptly and collapses on the

floor. Her name is Rosie. She
wears a plaid skirt, grey jacket,
glasses and a reddish-blond wig.
Before collapsing, she asks where
the Brooklyn Bridge is. Her Bronx
accent is perfectly authentic and
disgusting.
On first seeing her, and
listening to her simple-minded
lines, we characterize her as a
simpleton. Later, however, we
learn that she's writing a thesis for
NYU — but this is a playwriting,
not an acting problem, about
which more will be said later.
The play proceeds (albeit in a
disorganized manner) to delineate
the three characters and their
relations with one another. Mr.
Glas, convincingly played by
George Burst, confesses to having
been a German war accomplice
and is judged by Randal and Rosie
as the jury. This scene was well
staged with Randal spotlighted on
a ladder, Burst testifying on the
left, and Rosie seated at the table
on the right. Randal explains his
insensitivity to others, and Rosie
(Virginia Drake) demonstrated her
need to help people in some
manner.
Faulty Construction
William Hanley's play contains
several theatrically viable
concepts, yet its construction is
faulty. The actors were struggling
against the inadequacies of the
text. The inconsistency of the
character of Rosie, for example,
created several problems for me as
this was basically a realistic play.
Rosie appears as a clown, then a
serious individual concerned with
the plight of the two men; her
motivation shifted from line to
line.
James Symmons' direction did
everything possible to compensate
for the script. But it's hard to
compensate for a play in which,
for the most part, one character
talks and the two others listen.
I feel some cuts should have
been made: some of the
sentimental lines could have been
dispensed with without damaging
the play, and some of the longer,
gratuitous speeches, like the
shopkeeper's recital of his former
life, could surely have been
shortened. In this manner,
perhaps the construction could
have been more closely knit
and the transitions more clear.


VIRGINIA DRAKE is a member of the cast of "Slow Dance on the
Killing Ground" now playing at the Nitery. The play, a melodrama by
William Hanley, is presented FREE to the public nightly at 8 through
