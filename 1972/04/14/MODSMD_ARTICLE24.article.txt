## Bogdanovich Borrows 'Doc' 
### TODD McCARTHY 
I was prepared to thoroughly
dissect Peter Bogdanovich's
"What's Up, Doc?" and
en u m e rate his numerous
plagiarisms, but after seeing the
film I feel that doing so in depth
would be basically invalid and
hardly worth it. Bogdanovich's
shallowness and studied
calculation in "The Last Picture
Show" bother me even more in
retrospect than they did at the
time. For the most part, however,
the hommage aspect of "What's
Up, Doc?" is relatively
unobtrusive and inoffensive —
there are certain conventions
inherent in almost all romantic
screwball comedies and
Bogdanovich is as entitled to use
them as anyone else.
For the record (and as many
national critics, who have done
some quick homework since "The
Last Picture Show," have pointed
out), Bogdanovich has pilfered
from some comedy classics in
assembling "What's Up, Doc?"
The most obvious source of (dare
I use the word) inspiration is
Howard Hawks' universally
admired "Bringing Up Baby" and
though Bogdanovich openly
acknowledges the influence of
that film, he officially credits
neither Hawks nor scenarists
Dudley Nichols and Hager Wilde.
The premise is basically the
same — a hapless, attractive but
stuffy academician, marginally
engaged to a commandeering
sort-of female, is wooed and won
by a girl whose rampant and
unthinking brashness and
presumption constitute both her
greatest asset and greatest
liability. Specific borrowings from
"Baby" include the coat-ripping
scenes, the ladder in the chase and
the whole of the male character,
in which Ryan O'Neal is prodded
into imitating Cary Grant in a
performance which stops just
short of out-and-out
impersonation.
The well-timed and obviously
very expensive chase sequence
(which did visible damage to the
Alta Plaza steps, since repaired) is
actually fairly funny and
inventive, particularly when
Streisand and O'Neal disrupt a
Chinatown parade ana become

the hapless drivers of a dragon
float. The gag with the giant pane
of glass is, I believe, taken from a
Laurel and Hardy film, but here,
to his credit, Bogdanovich rounds
out the situation well and
smoothly moves on to the next
gag. Even if most of them aren't
terribly funny, the film rarely falls
flat in its individual comic
resolutions.
One of the better predicaments
of the chase has a young man
being pursued down a San
Francisco hill by tumbling garbage
cans but unfortunately, this has
been lifted from one of Buster
Keaton's masterpieces "Seven
Chances," in which the hero
barely escapes being buried by a
virtual avalance of rolling
boulders! It seems like we've seen
the final courtroom scene a
hundred times, though in
inspiration it is closest to the
work of Capra, Sturges and
Mitchell Leisen in "Midnight."
Lack of Showmanship
Enough. What really bothers
me about "What's Up, Doc?" is its
thinness, the lack of a genuine
sense of showmanship and its
transparency, which allows the
mechanics of its construction to
be seen all too clearly.
Bogdanovich knows his stuff, but
he knows it all too well — it's as if
he's studied every genre, chosen
what he thinks is best (in most
cases, he's right) and set out to
conquer each genre with one try.
Since everyone before him has
taken all the chances and made
the necessary mistakes by which
one learns, Bogdanovich is free to
proceed relatively safely.
Ironically, he is praised for being
daring for using black-and-white
in "Picture Show" and for
attempting a screwball comedy in
"What's Up, Doc?" For the
moment, at any rate, Bogdanovich
seems to have adopted what one
might call the masterpiece
approach to film making, which
smacks of the opportunism for
which he is becoming quickly
known.
What was curious about my
response to "What's Up, Doc?"
was that while I knew many
moments were funny, I didn't
laugh much (I must admit that
many audience members did, but

not uncontrollably). Audience
standards for comedy have
probably lowered steadily since
the advent of television sitcoms,
but I think that anyone who
thoroughly knows or remembers
classic silent film comedies or the
crazy masterpieces of the thirties
will recognize the mechanical
thinness of "What's Up, Doc?"
A friend has suggested that we
don't cannonize many modem
plays or playwrights because we
have read Shakespeare and the
rest and can fairly accurately
place modern works in their
proper historical perspective. Even
given the incredibly short time
movies have existed, he insists,
most viewers and some critics are
still woefully ignorant of the
medium's history and are
therefore able to accept and even
praise modern slop as if nothing
better had ever been done.
Bogdanovich, using old blueprints,
may be able to put his work over
to most people, but the
perspective of history will,
perhaps sooner than he thinks,
reveal him coming up short.
Some Good Points
"What's Up, Doc?" is not
without its felicities, however. A
formal dinner party in which
everyone ends up under the table
is flawlessly executed and, like
most other scenes, nicely capped.
Austin Pendleton is marvellous as
a mild-mannered musical bigwig
and Kenneth Mars hams it up in a
part blatantly patterend after
predatory critic John Simon who,
ironically, was one of the few
critics to see "The Last Picture
Show" for what it is. Best of all,
Barbara Streisand is more
appealing here than she has been
at any time since "Funny Girl"
and makes a spirited comeback
from the excruciating abyss that
was "The Owl and the Pussycat."
What must happen is that
Bogdanovich get out of his
hommage stage and the quicker
the better, for at his present rate,
he will soon establish himself as
one of the most unoriginal
directors in film history. French
lovers of the American cinema
such as Truffaut and Chabrol
proved their inate talent before
indulging in tributes and film
quotations but after his
exceptional debut with "Targets,"
Bogdanovich stepped in the wrong
direction and seems headed even
further out with his next project,
an all-star western called 'The
Streets of Laredo" which toplines
John Wayne, James Stewart,
Henry Fonda, Ryan O'Neal and
Cybill Shepherd. After that,
however, his plans seem more
promising: an adaptation of
Galsworthy's moving "The Apple
Tree" and a study of a pioneering
film director during the early days
of the industry. Hopefully then
we will hear from Bogdanovich
the artist rather than the
competant imitator.
