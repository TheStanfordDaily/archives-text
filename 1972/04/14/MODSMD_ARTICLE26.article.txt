# Krips Returns
## 
### DAVID WILLIAMS 
It is always interesting to watch a man return to his old scene, and
Josef Krips's return to conduct the San Francisco Symphony
orchestra was a fairly successful one. The program included the
Schubert Symphony No. 2, Till Bulenspiegel's Merry Pranks of
Richard Strauss, and the Seventh Symphony of Beethoven. The
program, it is true, was old fashioned, i.e. entirely nineteenth century,
but the music was good, and so was the playing.
Thank heavens that Schubert symphonies have come back into
fashion. Until recently only the fifth, eighth, and ninth were usually
performed, but the "little" early symphonies, written in a style similar
to that of Haydn, Mozart, and the "even" Beethoven symphonies
contain much beautiful music.
The Second Symphony, composed in Schubert's eighteenth year is
filled with lovely melodies, much of it, Einstein tells us, in "free
imitation" of Mozart. The most substantial movement is the first,
preceded by a fine Mozartian introduction, largo, both of which Mr.
Krips conducted with tact and sensitivity; the andante, a lovely
Viennese construction, adn the typically Schubertian scherzo-minute,
marked allegro vivance were played with as much understanding as
could be hoped for, and while the concluding allegro was played a
trifle slowly, the over-all effect was more than satisfying.
The Strauss tone poem, completed in 1895, concerned with the
antics of a fourteenth-century practical joker who is hanged for his
pleasure may have been the best played piece on the program.
Canin's solo passages were subtly executed, making up for a certain
clumsiness on the part of the solo horn player.
In the opening bars of the Seventh, problems began to manifest
themselves. The magnificent arpeggios, which a friend of mine once
described as the steps to paradise, were not sharply defined enough,
and indeed legato and staccato seemed confounded throughout the
length of the most sublime of Beethoven's introductions.
The allegro was better played, but here the brass seemed to
dominate, making the music seem clumsy. In the allegretto things
began to improve, and rarely have I heard better interpretations of the
last two movements.
The tempo of the finale was just right, and the playing clear and
vigorous without being heavy footed. In short, no one had just cause
to regret Mr. Krip's return — least of all Mr. Krips.
