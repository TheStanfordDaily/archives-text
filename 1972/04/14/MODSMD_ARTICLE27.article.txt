# Bangladesh Collapses
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
One of the great tragedies of
1971 was the costly and horrible
civil war which erupted in
Pakistan when the government of
West Pakistan refused to let the
residents of East Pakistan secede
and set up the new state of
Bangladesh. Bangladesh finally
was created, but not until
thousands had been killed and
millions had been left homeless.
The lives of millions of
Pakistanis were jeopardized by the
war and many of those who didn't
die in the actual fighting later
starved or are still starving to
death. As frantic pleas for food
and medical supplies came from
Pakistan last summer, former
Beatle George Harrison decided to
organize a benefit concert for
Bangladesh.
Harrison lined up a number of
music's superstars including Ringo
Starr, Eric Clapton, Leon Russell,
Bill Preston, Ravi Shankar and
Bob Dylan and together they
headlined a historic benefit
concert in August at Madison
Square Garden in New York.
Proceeds from that concert and
the record and film which grew
out of it were earmarked for
refugees in Bangladesh.
There have been few musical
benefits of this magnitude for
such an important cause and that
was one reason I was more than a
little upset when, after the album
was released, it was rumored that
the traditional capitalistic motives
of the record industry were
popping up here and there and
causing a problem with the quick
and complete sending of proceeds
to the people who really needed
them.
Directional Incompetence
My anger is made even greater
by the film of the concert. For in
an incredible example of
directorial incompetence and
stupidity, "The Concert for
Bangladesh" almost completely
avoids any mention of the cause
behind the benefit and I dare say
that some youth seeing the film
10 years hence might think that
Bangladesh was some very weird
religious cult.
Except for a short clip of
Harrison announcing the concert
at a press conference and a minute
or two of shots of the refugees
from the war, the film shows
almost nothing but the concert

and never really explores the
reasons behind the benefit.
Naturally most people who see
the film will come to hear the
musicians they love, just as most
people who went to the concert
undoubtedly did so more out of a
desire to hear the artists than out
of compassion for the refugees in
Bangladesh. This doesn't really
bother me as long as the money is
raised and helps these people
survive.
But it does seem irresponsible
that in a movie of nearly two
hour's length, there couldn't have
been at least 10 minutes devoted
to exploration of and comment
about the tragic war which
sparked the concert and the
disastrous situation which still
exists in Bangladesh.
Such an explanation of the
concert could've been interspersed
throughout the concert footage or
lumped all at the beginning or end
of the film. Even if it had been
included though, I am sure many
people would've left the theater
discussing only Harrison's great
voice or Leon Russell's strange
eyes.
Could Be Effective
But if the film had included
some more substantive exposure
of the issue underlying the
concert instead of just a few
fleeting glances of some refugees,
possibly some of the audience
would've come away a bit more
affected by the great tragedy
which still goes on in Bangladesh
today.
Rock documentaries will
probably always live in the
shadow of "Woodstock," and no
one can deny that the nature of
Woodstock made it a much more
suitable event for a thorough
documentary than most rock
events. But even given the
limitations of working with only a
single concert, the makers of 'The
Concert for Bangladesh," missed
many opportunities to make it
into a much better film.
I have already explained my
major objection to the film. But
just the filming of the concert
itself, which makes up almost all
of the movie, is not that well
done. Why is the 30 seconds of
Harrison answering some
questions about the concert the
only discussion of the concert and
Bangladesh issue with any of the
performers?
I was very curious as to what
some of the other artists thought
of both the concert and the
situation in Bangladesh and I
would've loved to hear what they
had to say. It might have also
been nice to ask a few audience

members for their reactions to the
same questions.
Uncreative Shots
I am sure that the makers of
the film can give excuses about
the short notice they were put to
work on, but I dare say many a
freshman film student given 30
minutes notice, would've
probably included the above
things in his filming plan.
Anyone who saw "Woodstock"
will remember the fine use of split
screen technique in the film. In
the beginning of "The Concert for
Bangladesh," that technique is
used very well in some footage of
Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Kahn
performing Indian music. But the
technique, which offers a wide
range of possible uses, is used for
the first and last time during the
10 minute Shankar segment at the
beginning of the movie.
Other real photographic
innovations are also noticeably
lacking from the movie. And the
crowd shots remind me of the
kind an amateur would take:
quick scans across a sea of faces,
with very few close-ups of people
at all. Thrilling.
Music Saves the Day
Luckily the director of the film
had no control over the music,
which thankfully is good enough
to salvage the film. Harrison has
never sounded better than on his
performance of "My Sweet
Lord," "Here Comes The Sun,"
"Beware of Darkness," "While My
Guitar Gently Weeps," and
"Bangladesh."
Dylan is his old lovable nasal
self on "Blowing In the Wind,"
"Just Like A Woman" and "A
Hard Rain's Gonna Fall." Russell
is responsible for a great "Jumpin'
Jack Flash," Preston does a fine
'That's The Way The Lord
Planned It"and Starr even throws
in a good performance of "It
Ain't Easy."
People are always going to say
that the Beatles were greater than
the sum of their parts, but this
film reaffirms the fact that
Harrison is an extremely talented
musician. And he displayed a
commendable amount of
compassion in organizing the
concert.
Unfortunately, the film doesn't
really do justice to the event. The
music is still masterful and with
proceeds headed for such an
important cause, I still suggest
you see the film. Dig the music,
but don't get too upset at the
incompetence the filmmaker
displayed in almost completely
omitting the issue behind the
concert.

"Beware of Darkness," "While My
Guitar Gently Weeps," and
"Bangladesh."
Dylan is his old lovable nasal
self on "Blowing In the Wind,"
"Just Like A Woman" and "A
Hard Rain's Gonna Fall." Russell
is responsible for a great "Jumpin'
Jack Flash," Preston does a fine
'That's The Way The Lord
Planned It"and Starr even throws
in a good performance of "It
Ain't Easy."
People are always going to say
that the Beatles were greater than
the sum of their parts, but this
film reaffirms the fact that
Harrison is an extremely talented
musician. And he displayed a
commendable amount of
compassion in organizing the
concert.
Unfortunately, the film doesn't
really do justice to the event. The
music is still masterful and with
proceeds headed for such an
important cause, I still suggest
you see the film. Dig the music,
but don't get too upset at the
incompetence the filmmaker
displayed in almost completely
omitting the issue behind the
concert.
One of the great tragedies of
1971 was the costly and horrible
civil war which erupted in
Pakistan when the government of
West Pakistan refused to let the
residents of East Pakistan secede
and set up the new state of
Bangladesh. Bangladesh finally
was created, but not until
thousands had been killed and
millions had been left homeless.
The lives of millions of
Pakistanis were jeopardized by the
war and many of those who didn't
die in the actual fighting later
starved or are still starving to
death. As frantic pleas for food
and medical supplies came from
Pakistan last summer, former
Beatle George Harrison decided to
organize a benefit concert for
Bangladesh.
Harrison lined up a number of
music's superstars including Ringo
Starr, Eric Clapton, Leon Russell,
Bill Preston, Ravi Shankar and
Bob Dylan and together they
headlined a historic benefit
concert in August at Madison
Square Garden in New York.
Proceeds from that concert and
the record and film which grew
out of it were earmarked for
refugees in Bangladesh.
There have been few musical
benefits of this magnitude for
such an important cause and that
was one reason I was more than a
little upset when, after the album
was released, it was rumored that
the traditional capitalistic motives
of the record industry were
popping up here and there and
causing a problem with the quick
and complete sending of proceeds
to the people who really needed
them.
Directional Incompetence
My anger is made even greater
by the film of the concert. For in
an incredible example of
directorial incompetence and
stupidity, "The Concert for
Bangladesh" almost completely
avoids any mention of the cause
behind the benefit and I dare say
that some youth seeing the film
10 years hence might think that
Bangladesh was some very weird
religious cult.
Except for a short clip of
Harrison announcing the concert
at a press conference and a minute
or two of shots of the refugees
from the war, the film shows
almost nothing but the concert

and never really explores the
reasons behind the benefit.
Naturally most people who see
the film will come to hear the
musicians they love, just as most
people who went to the concert
undoubtedly did so more out of a
desire to hear the artists than out
of compassion for the refugees in
Bangladesh. This doesn't really
bother me as long as the money is
raised and helps these people
survive.
But it does seem irresponsible
that in a movie of nearly two
hour's length, there couldn't have
been at least 10 minutes devoted
to exploration of and comment
about the tragic war which
sparked the concert and the
disastrous situation which still
exists in Bangladesh.
Such an explanation of the
concert could've been interspersed
throughout the concert footage or
lumped all at the beginning or end
of the film. Even if it had been
included though, I am sure many
people would've left the theater
discussing only Harrison's great
voice or Leon Russell's strange
eyes.
Could Be Effective
But if the film had included
some more substantive exposure
of the issue underlying the
concert instead of just a few
fleeting glances of some refugees,
possibly some of the audience
would've come away a bit more
affected by the great tragedy
which still goes on in Bangladesh
today.
Rock documentaries will
probably always live in the
shadow of "Woodstock," and no
one can deny that the nature of
Woodstock made it a much more
suitable event for a thorough
documentary than most rock
events. But even given the
limitations of working with only a
single concert, the makers of 'The
Concert for Bangladesh," missed
many opportunities to make it
into a much better film.
I have already explained my
major objection to the film. But
just the filming of the concert
itself, which makes up almost all
of the movie, is not that well
done. Why is the 30 seconds of
Harrison answering some
questions about the concert the
only discussion of the concert and
Bangladesh issue with any of the
performers?
I was very curious as to what
some of the other artists thought
of both the concert and the
situation in Bangladesh and I
would've loved to hear what they
had to say. It might have also
been nice to ask a few audience

members for their reactions to the
same questions.
Uncreative Shots
I am sure that the makers of
the film can give excuses about
the short notice they were put to
work on, but I dare say many a
freshman film student given 30
minutes notice, would've
probably included the above
things in his filming plan.
Anyone who saw "Woodstock"
will remember the fine use of split
screen technique in the film. In
the beginning of "The Concert for
Bangladesh," that technique is
used very well in some footage of
Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Kahn
performing Indian music. But the
technique, which offers a wide
range of possible uses, is used for
the first and last time during the
10 minute Shankar segment at the
beginning of the movie.
Other real photographic
innovations are also noticeably
lacking from the movie. And the
crowd shots remind me of the
kind an amateur would take:
quick scans across a sea of faces,
with very few close-ups of people
at all. Thrilling.
Music Saves the Day
Luckily the director of the film
had no control over the music,
which thankfully is good enough
to salvage the film. Harrison has
never sounded better than on his
performance of "My Sweet
Lord," "Here Comes The Sun,"
"Beware of Darkness," "While My
Guitar Gently Weeps," and
"Bangladesh."
Dylan is his old lovable nasal
self on "Blowing In the Wind,"
"Just Like A Woman" and "A
Hard Rain's Gonna Fall." Russell

minutes notice, would've
probably included the above
things in his filming plan.
Anyone who saw "Woodstock"
will remember the fine use of split
screen technique in the film. In
the beginning of "The Concert for
Bangladesh," that technique is
used very well in some footage of
Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Kahn
performing Indian music. But the
technique, which offers a wide
range of possible uses, is used for
the first and last time during the
10 minute Shankar segment at the
beginning of the movie.
Other real photographic
innovations are also noticeably
lacking from the movie. And the
crowd shots remind me of the
kind an amateur would take:
quick scans across a sea of faces,
with very few close-ups of people
at all. Thrilling.
Music Saves the Day
Luckily the director of the film
had no control over the music,
which thankfully is good enough
to salvage the film. Harrison has
never sounded better than on his
performance of "My Sweet
Lord," "Here Comes The Sun,"
"Beware of Darkness," "While My
Guitar Gently Weeps," and
"Bangladesh."
Dylan is his old lovable nasal
self on "Blowing In the Wind,"
"Just Like A Woman" and "A
Hard Rain's Gonna Fall." Russell
is responsible for a great "Jumpin'
Jack Flash," Preston does a fine
'That's The Way The Lord
Planned It"and Starr even throws
in a good performance of "It
Ain't Easy."
People are always going to say
that the Beatles were greater than
the sum of their parts, but this
film reaffirms the fact that
Harrison is an extremely talented
musician. And he displayed a
commendable amount of
compassion in organizing the
concert.
Unfortunately, the film doesn't
really do justice to the event. The
music is still masterful and with
proceeds headed for such an
important cause, I still suggest
you see the film. Dig the music,
but don't get too upset at the
incompetence the filmmaker
displayed in almost completely
omitting the issue behind the
concert.
One of the great tragedies of
1971 was the costly and horrible
civil war which erupted in
Pakistan when the government of
West Pakistan refused to let the
residents of East Pakistan secede
and set up the new state of
Bangladesh. Bangladesh finally
was created, but not until
thousands had been killed and
millions had been left homeless.
The lives of millions of
Pakistanis were jeopardized by the
war and many of those who didn't
die in the actual fighting later
starved or are still starving to
death. As frantic pleas for food
and medical supplies came from
Pakistan last summer, former
Beatle George Harrison decided to
organize a benefit concert for
Bangladesh.
Harrison lined up a number of
music's superstars including Ringo
Starr, Eric Clapton, Leon Russell,
Bill Preston, Ravi Shankar and
Bob Dylan and together they
headlined a historic benefit
concert in August at Madison
Square Garden in New York.
Proceeds from that concert and
the record and film which grew
out of it were earmarked for
refugees in Bangladesh.
There have been few musical
benefits of this magnitude for
such an important cause and that
was one reason I was more than a
little upset when, after the album
was released, it was rumored that
the traditional capitalistic motives
of the record industry were
popping up here and there and
causing a problem with the quick
and complete sending of proceeds
to the people who really needed
them.
Directional Incompetence
My anger is made even greater
by the film of the concert. For in
an incredible example of
directorial incompetence and
stupidity, "The Concert for
Bangladesh" almost completely
avoids any mention of the cause
behind the benefit and I dare say
that some youth seeing the film
10 years hence might think that
Bangladesh was some very weird
religious cult.
Except for a short clip of
Harrison announcing the concert
at a press conference and a minute
or two of shots of the refugees
from the war, the film shows
almost nothing but the concert

and never really explores the
reasons behind the benefit.
Naturally most people who see
the film will come to hear the
musicians they love, just as most
people who went to the concert
undoubtedly did so more out of a
desire to hear the artists than out
of compassion for the refugees in
Bangladesh. This doesn't really
bother me as long as the money is
raised and helps these people
survive.
But it does seem irresponsible
that in a movie of nearly two
hour's length, there couldn't have
been at least 10 minutes devoted
to exploration of and comment
about the tragic war which
sparked the concert and the
disastrous situation which still
exists in Bangladesh.
Such an explanation of the
concert could've been interspersed
throughout the concert footage or
lumped all at the beginning or end
of the film. Even if it had been
included though, I am sure many
people would've left the theater
discussing only Harrison's great
voice or Leon Russell's strange
eyes.
Could Be Effective
But if the film had included
some more substantive exposure
of the issue underlying the
concert instead of just a few
fleeting glances of some refugees,
possibly some of the audience
would've come away a bit more
affected by the great tragedy
which still goes on in Bangladesh
today.
Rock documentaries will
probably always live in the
shadow of "Woodstock," and no
one can deny that the nature of
Woodstock made it a much more
suitable event for a thorough
documentary than most rock
events. But even given the
limitations of working with only a
single concert, the makers of 'The
Concert for Bangladesh," missed
many opportunities to make it
into a much better film.
I have already explained my
major objection to the film. But
just the filming of the concert
itself, which makes up almost all
of the movie, is not that well
done. Why is the 30 seconds of
Harrison answering some
questions about the concert the
only discussion of the concert and
Bangladesh issue with any of the
performers?
I was very curious as to what
some of the other artists thought
of both the concert and the
situation in Bangladesh and I
would've loved to hear what they
had to say. It might have also
been nice to ask a few audience

members for their reactions to the
same questions.
Uncreative Shots
I am sure that the makers of
the film can give excuses about
the short notice they were put to
work on, but I dare say many a
freshman film student given 30

probably included the above
things in his filming plan.
