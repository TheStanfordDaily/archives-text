# THE 						STANFORD DAILY
## Freshmen Expected To Help Basketball 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Nothing much is new right now
in college basketball.
UCLA wrapped up its sixth
straight NCAA championship a
few weeks ago. Coaches all over
the country are spending night
after night in the homes of
promising high school recruits.
And at Stanford, most fans are
glad that basketball has ended so
they can look forward to football
season.
But varsity basketball coach
Howie Dallmar and his assistant
Bub Bowling are not brooding
over the Cards' 10-15 season. In
fact they are filled with optimistic
anticipation as they wait for
October 15, 1972, the magic date
when college teams can start
practicing.
It would seem foolhardy to be
optimistic after five straight losing
seasons, especially since superb
guard Claude Terry will graduate
this June and take his amazing
talents to the pro ranks.
National Prominence
But Stanford may be on the
verge of national basketball
prominence. This year's entire
front line will return, including
such talented performers as Dave
Frost, Mike Mann, Bob Buell, and
Steve Shupe. And these players
will be joined by stars from what
Dallmar calls "Stanford's best
freshman team ever."
Most prominent among the
freshmen who will move up to the
varsity is 7 foot center Rich
Kelley, the first 7 footer to play
basketball here. Kelley had an
outstanding freshman season,
scoring over 18 points a game,
rebounding at a 16 per game clip,
blocking countless enemy shots,
and holding the team together
with his heady play at both ends
of the court.
"With Kelley and Mike Mann
(6-9) we'll have more height than
we've ever had," said Dallmar.
"And we'll also have much more
depth since we have eight men
returning from last year's varsity
plus seven freshmen who are
capable of making the traveling
squad."
Team Depth
But possibly more important
than the team's depth will be its
versatility. Dallmar will be able to
use a variety of offensive setups,
depending on the particular
situation. Stanford could go to a
one guard offense since forwards
Frost, Buell, Scott Trobbe, Mel
Arterberry, and Archie Dean can
all handle the ball well. Kelley can

play in the high or low post and
guards Pat Rusco, Mike Simons,
and John Stratton are strong
enough to take their men inside.
"We'll have a tremendous
amount of flexibility," said
Bowling. "We can run, press, and
handle the ball — things that are
enjoyable to watch and for the
players to do."
Stanford's fast break should be
explosive. "We'll be able to run
more becaue of our board
strength," said Dallmar, referring
to the awesome rebounding power
of Kelley, Mann, and Shupe.
Anyone who saw any freshman
games this year had to be
impressed by the perfectly
executed fast breaks in which
Kelley snared the ball off the
board and passed to versatile
guard Mark Gilberg, who would
flip deft passes to Mel Arterberry,
streaking toward the basket for a
sure two points.
Outstanding Shooters
The Cards should also feature
some outstanding shooters. Dave
Frost was brilliant in the opening
game against Houston and in the
finale against UCLA but didn't see
much action in between because
of a bad back. Frost is now almost
completely recovered and with
two years of eligibility remaining,
could put himself high on the list
of all-time Stanford scorers.
Kelley, Trobbe, Buell, Mann
and Dean are among the other
frontliners with soft shooting
touches and guards Gilberg,
Simons, Rusco, Stratton, and Ben
Bluitt can all toss in shots from
practically anywhere on the court.
Of course Stanford will not be
without its problems. Someone
will have to emerge as the man to
fill the leadership void left by
Terry's graduation. And the team
will still be inexperienced, despite
the valuable playing time gained
by Mann, Shupe, Buell, and Frost
this year.
How good can Stanford be? "I
think we can win anywhere from
14-20 games," predicts Bowling,
"depending on how well we
perform and improve."
It would obviously be a
monumental task to upset
national champs UCLA, which has
four starters returning. But a
second place Pac-8 finish seems
within reach. And if the
conference approves a new rule in
May which woflld allow the
league's runnerup to play in the
NIT at New York Madison Square
Garden, Stanford could possibly
be tournament bound.

STARS OF THE FUTURE—Shown here are some of the freshmen who may help the varsity have its first
winning season in quite a while. Shown above are Scott Trobbe (33), Melvin Arterberry (45), and Mike
Simons (43) awaiting a pass from Rich Kelly. While below the frosh are playing defense with Kelly
proving to be quite an obstacle to an opposing player.
