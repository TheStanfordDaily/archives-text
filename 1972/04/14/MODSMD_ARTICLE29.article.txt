# Athletic Teams Rated High
## Spring Success 
### Mike Chasson 
With the coming of Spring quarter things were looking pretty sad
for the Stanford sports program. Fall quarter had yielded a water polo
team that seemed destined for a NCAA title but finished a
disappointing sixth. A cross-country team that after some fine early
season performances placed a distant sixth at the Pacific-Eight
Championships. Only the Rose Bowl champion football team salvaged
Fall for the Stanford sports fan.
Winter quarter just compounded the misery of those who follow
Stanford athletics. The wrestling team scored only one point at the
Pac-8 championships as it placed last. The rugby team, defending
champions in the Monterey Rugby Tournament, finished sixteenth in
this year's tournament. Swimming suffered two of their worse dual
meet defeats in history to USC and, UCLA and had their worse finish
at the NCAA's in five years.
Basketball completed another losing season with a sixth place finish
in the Pacific-Eight race. The sport that kept the Stanford fan from
completely giving up was gymnastics. A team which the year before
had lost all their dual meets, rebounded to defeat everyone but
perenial power California.
Spring has brought success to the athletic program. NCAA
championships actually appear within reach for tennis, baseball and
golf.
The tennis team has only lost to USC 5-4 on the winners court. As
Sandy Mayer recovers from his leg injury Stanford will only become
stronger. The rematch between these two powers will go a long way in
determing who has the best chance for a NCAA tifle.
Currently ranked number one in the country the baseball team has
conquered defending NCAA champion USC two out of three games.
The Cards have also defeated Arizona State who were formally the
number one team.
The golfers are currently undefeated in dual meet competition, and
they have made strong showings in tournament play. Though they
have not been able to put it together to win a tournament as Coach
Bud Finger finds his top six players, tournament play should improve.
A good indicator of Stanfords NCAA chances will be the U.S.
Collegiate Invitational at Stanford later this month.
Gymnastics which completed its season in the spring just missed
representing the Pacific-Eight at the NCAA's. Coach Dan Millman
loses only one member off this years squad, that had no juniors.
Millman has already convinced some of this years best high school
gymnasts to attend Stanford. It appears the Cards will have a good
shot at a NCAA title for next year.
In the past when a Stanford team lost to UCLA or USC it was
usually blamed on the fact that those schools had more scholarships
and thus could recruit more talent. Stanford's recent successes seem
to refute this argument. It appears that the quality of the program is
more important than anything else. The quality of a program is
usually determined by the coach. He is ultimately responsible for the
success and failure of his team. It is obvious that some coaches are
developing excellent programs as evidence by our spring sports
performing so well. It is hoped other coaches will take note.

shot at a NCAA title for next year.
In the past when a Stanford team lost to UCLA or USC it was
usually blamed on the fact that those schools had more scholarships
and thus could recruit more talent. Stanford's recent successes seem
to refute this argument. It appears that the quality of the program is
more important than anything else. The quality of a program is
usually determined by the coach. He is ultimately responsible for the
success and failure of his team. It is obvious that some coaches are
developing excellent programs as evidence by our spring sports
performing so well. It is hoped other coaches will take note.
With the coming of Spring quarter things were looking pretty sad
for the Stanford sports program. Fall quarter had yielded a water polo
team that seemed destined for a NCAA title but finished a
disappointing sixth. A cross-country team that after some fine early
season performances placed a distant sixth at the Pacific-Eight
Championships. Only the Rose Bowl champion football team salvaged
Fall for the Stanford sports fan.
Winter quarter just compounded the misery of those who follow
Stanford athletics. The wrestling team scored only one point at the
Pac-8 championships as it placed last. The rugby team, defending
champions in the Monterey Rugby Tournament, finished sixteenth in
this year's tournament. Swimming suffered two of their worse dual
meet defeats in history to USC and, UCLA and had their worse finish
at the NCAA's in five years.
Basketball completed another losing season with a sixth place finish
in the Pacific-Eight race. The sport that kept the Stanford fan from
completely giving up was gymnastics. A team which the year before
had lost all their dual meets, rebounded to defeat everyone but
perenial power California.
Spring has brought success to the athletic program. NCAA
championships actually appear within reach for tennis, baseball and
golf.
The tennis team has only lost to USC 5-4 on the winners court. As
Sandy Mayer recovers from his leg injury Stanford will only become
stronger. The rematch between these two powers will go a long way in
determing who has the best chance for a NCAA tifle.
Currently ranked number one in the country the baseball team has
conquered defending NCAA champion USC two out of three games.
The Cards have also defeated Arizona State who were formally the
number one team.
The golfers are currently undefeated in dual meet competition, and
they have made strong showings in tournament play. Though they
have not been able to put it together to win a tournament as Coach
Bud Finger finds his top six players, tournament play should improve.
A good indicator of Stanfords NCAA chances will be the U.S.
Collegiate Invitational at Stanford later this month.
Gymnastics which completed its season in the spring just missed
representing the Pacific-Eight at the NCAA's. Coach Dan Millman
loses only one member off this years squad, that had no juniors.
Millman has already convinced some of this years best high school
gymnasts to attend Stanford. It appears the Cards will have a good
shot at a NCAA title for next year.
