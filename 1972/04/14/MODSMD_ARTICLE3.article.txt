# Election Next Week
## Barber Ticket Seeks Presidency 
### JIM WASCHER 
If elected, an ASSU Council of
Presidents slate led by Rocky Barber
will seejc to restore "the respect and
support of the student body" for the
ASSU.
Barber, junior in political science,
is a member of the ASSU Senate this
year as is his vice presidential candi
date, Chuck Fay, a junior in philoso
phy. Sophomore Rich Cortez, who is
ASSU Publications Board Chairman, is
running as the third member of the
Council. Cortez also serves as the
ASSU's Assistant Financial Manager
and is majoring in communications.
The slate is vocal in its criticism of
the Senate and the incumbent Council
of Presidents. It has been speculated
that Fay was so vocal in his criticism
of black Senators that he caused ASSU

Senators Kathy Waller and Loudin
Beam to drop off the slate. Cortez
joined the slate to replace them.
The two allegedly quit the slate
because of a statement made by Fay.
Waller said she withdrew because she
"didn't like the politics of the
situation." She called Fay's statement
"insensitive to Third World groups."
Beam told the Daily that time
limitations arising from his commit
ment to law school had led to his
withdrawal from the slate.
Fay admits he "did make a critical
comment about certain blacks in the
Senate and student government" and
"specifically about Mike Dawson."
Fay complains that Dawson, who is
also an ASSU Senator, and others "are
dishonest and do not care what their
tactics are."

Fay expands his criticism to include
white former Senators Yale Braunstein
and Owen Blank. Generally, the slate
wants the entire Senate to "get out of
the bag it's in, putting through a lot of
resolutions that don't have any af
fect."

ASSU Presidential Candidates'
Statements - See Pages 2 and 3

Members of the Barber slate say
they wish to continue to offer the
concrete guidance to the Senate that
they said has been given by incumbent
ASSU President Doug McHenry.
Barber is not as favorable to the
current Council of Presidents when he
explains why the slate is not present

ing its views on some of the major
political issues on the campus, such as
recruitment at the Placement Center.
Barber says that the McHenry
Council has "alienated many students
by continually coming out on these
volatile issues with more or less
unpopular stands." Fay says that the
slate doesn't want to be "moral
dictator of the student body."
The Barber slate has come out with
definitive stands on the fee assess
ments facing students on the same
ballot as the presidential contest. The
slate cites the refund option included
on the Daily-Publications Board, Citi
zens Advocates, and Afro-American
Community Center assessments as a
major factor in their support for those
assessments.
Barber, Fay and Cortez also endorse
the KZSU assessment explaining that
the radio station has "offered excel
lent service this year." Finally, the
slate supports the Special Events
Board assessment.
The Barber slate opposes a sixth
assessment, which is requested for the
ASSU Program. The Program Fee is to
be apportioned by the Senate, which a
slate member said was "unable to
handle it fairly and efficiently."
The Barber platform emphasizes
student services, educational reform

and social concern. The slate's major
proposal for student services is the
establishment of an "ASSU Student
Services Commission."
The purposes of the Commission,
according to the Barber campaign
literature, will be the supervision of
existing services such as the Travel
Service, Special Events and the Dupli
cating Center as well as "new student
run services such as a speaker series."
Student Lobby
The Barber slate also intends the
Commission to "act as the student
lobby on University-run services such

as Tresidder Union and the Book
store."
In the field of educational reform,
the Barber slate proposes the establish
ment of an urban campus in San
Francisco. Also planned should the
slate win is a comprehensive course
review as expanded from the incum
bent Council's recently-circulated
"Guerilla."
The Barber slate's major aim in the
social concern field is to involve as
many students as possible in the
electoral process on the national, state
and local level.

major factor in their support for those
assessments.
Barber, Fay and Cortez also endorse
the KZSU assessment explaining that
the radio station has "offered excel
lent service this year." Finally, the
slate supports the Special Events
Board assessment.
The Barber slate opposes a sixth
assessment, which is requested for the
ASSU Program. The Program Fee is to
be apportioned by the Senate, which a
slate member said was "unable to
handle it fairly and efficiently."
The Barber platform emphasizes
student services, educational reform

and social concern. The slate's major
proposal for student services is the
establishment of an "ASSU Student
Services Commission."
The purposes of the Commission,
according to the Barber campaign
literature, will be the supervision of
existing services such as the Travel
Service, Special Events and the Dupli
cating Center as well as "new student
run services such as a speaker series."
Student Lobby
The Barber slate also intends the
Commission to "act as the student
lobby on University-run services such

as Tresidder Union and the Book
store."
In the field of educational reform,
the Barber slate proposes the establish
ment of an urban campus in San
Francisco. Also planned should the
slate win is a comprehensive course
review as expanded from the incum
bent Council's recently-circulated
"Guerilla."
The Barber slate's major aim in the
social concern field is to involve as
many students as possible in the
electoral process on the national, state
and local level.
If elected, an ASSU Council of
Presidents slate led by Rocky Barber
will seejc to restore "the respect and
support of the student body" for the
ASSU.
Barber, junior in political science,
is a member of the ASSU Senate this
year as is his vice presidential candi
date, Chuck Fay, a junior in philoso
phy. Sophomore Rich Cortez, who is
ASSU Publications Board Chairman, is
running as the third member of the
Council. Cortez also serves as the
ASSU's Assistant Financial Manager
and is majoring in communications.
The slate is vocal in its criticism of
the Senate and the incumbent Council
of Presidents. It has been speculated
that Fay was so vocal in his criticism
of black Senators that he caused ASSU

Senators Kathy Waller and Loudin
Beam to drop off the slate. Cortez
joined the slate to replace them.
The two allegedly quit the slate
because of a statement made by Fay.
Waller said she withdrew because she
"didn't like the politics of the
situation." She called Fay's statement
"insensitive to Third World groups."
Beam told the Daily that time
limitations arising from his commit
ment to law school had led to his
withdrawal from the slate.
Fay admits he "did make a critical
comment about certain blacks in the
Senate and student government" and
"specifically about Mike Dawson."
Fay complains that Dawson, who is
also an ASSU Senator, and others "are
dishonest and do not care what their
tactics are."

Fay expands his criticism to include
white former Senators Yale Braunstein
and Owen Blank. Generally, the slate
wants the entire Senate to "get out of
the bag it's in, putting through a lot of
resolutions that don't have any af
fect."

Members of the Barber slate say
they wish to continue to offer the

Barber is not as favorable to the

explains why the slate is not present

ing its views on some of the major

recruitment at the Placement Center.
Barber says that the McHenry

dictator of the student body."
The Barber slate has come out with
