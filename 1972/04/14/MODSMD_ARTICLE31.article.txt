# Frosh Players Star

### DAVE ROBINSON 
If someone had told golf coach
Bud Finger last fall that he would
have four freshmen in the 1972
varsity lineup, Finger probably
would have laughed and
dismissed the thought as
ridiculous.
Of course Finger was counting
on freshmen Aly Trompas and
Bruce Robertson, two of the
nation's premier junior golfers, to
break right into Stanford's varsity
lineup. But two more freshmen?
Last fall that seemed nearly
impossible with such talented
upperclassmen as Gary Vanier,
Tom Keelin, Pete Harpster, Denny
Colvin, Dennis Conrad, and Jim
Dwulet on the squad.
But just six months later two of
Finger's strongest performers are
the "other freshmen," Conrad
Nilmeier and Dave Baskins. So far
this duo has accounted for some
of the most valuable points in
Stanford's dual matches and two
outstanding tournament efforts.
Most surprising is Baskins, who
was never even thought of as a
varsity contender after shooting
unimpressive rounds of
76-78-84-77 in fall qualifying.
While Baskins was struggling
toward his 315 total, Robertson,
Vanier, and Trompas shattered
par for four rounds, pushing
Baskins even farther out of varsity

consideration.
"I enjoy practicing," he says.
"And I know that the only way I
can play a really top calibre of
golf is to practice every day."
Baskins' hard work paid off in
the San Francisco City
championships, his first major
success here. After qualifying
easily with a 151 total, Baskins
upset former Northern California
Open Champion Sandy Galbraith,
4-2, in the first round.
"I think Dave's victory over
Galbraith gave him a real lift,"
said Finger. "When he beat
Galbraith he realized he could
compete with any of the top
amateurs in the country."
Baskins went on to win two
more matches before losing in the
quarterfinals.
Freshman Nilmeier also played
well in the City tourney but the
consistent player from Fresno
caught fire in his home town
when Stanford competed in the
Fresno State Classic. Nilmeier
shot 74-73-68 for a one under par
total of 215, good for second
place in the tournament.
Baskins also pointed to a
specific improvement in his game
while explaining his recent
success. "Earlier in the year my
short irons and chipping were
inconsistent. But now I feel
confident that I can get down in
two from off the green."
Baskins' ability to save pars
from off the green was a major
factor in his excellent showing in
the Western Intercollegiates at
Pasatiempo. He shot 218 on
rounds of 73-74-71 to finish sixth
in the 162 man field.
Nilmeier and Baskins have
continued their outstanding play
in recent dual matches at
Stanford. Nilmeier has shot 71,
70, and 70 in his last three
matches while Baskins has a 70,
74, and two 75s to his credit.
Similar Styles
Most interesting, though, is the
remarkable similarity in the two
players' games. Both have
extremely solid golf swings and
rely on their consistently straight
play from tee to green.
Several times these similar
styles have led to identical scores
in major tournaments. Both shot
151 in the City qualifying. And in
the 1970 U.S. Juniors at Athens,
Georgia, both shot 155 to survive
the 36 hole cut.
The two have also combined
for some incredible best ball
rounds in dual matches. In a
freshman match against Menlo
College they had a best ball score
of 64, destroying Menlo's strong
number one and two players.
Several days later they shot a best
ball 66 in a varsity match against
Fresno State.
Although Baskins admits that
"I have to improve a lot," he
hopes to play professional golf in
five or six years. First, though, his
main goals are to play in the
NCAA tournament this June and
to qualify for the U.S. Open.
Nilmeier has similar
professional aspirations and Coach
Finger has no doubts that the two
players could make it as pros.
"Both golfers certainly have the
potential to play on the tour," he
says, "especially since they're two
of the hardest workers we've ever
had."

specific improvement in his game
while explaining his recent
success. "Earlier in the year my
short irons and chipping were
inconsistent. But now I feel
confident that I can get down in
two from off the green."
Baskins' ability to save pars
from off the green was a major
factor in his excellent showing in
the Western Intercollegiates at
Pasatiempo. He shot 218 on
rounds of 73-74-71 to finish sixth
in the 162 man field.
Nilmeier and Baskins have
continued their outstanding play
in recent dual matches at
Stanford. Nilmeier has shot 71,
70, and 70 in his last three
matches while Baskins has a 70,
74, and two 75s to his credit.
Similar Styles
Most interesting, though, is the
remarkable similarity in the two
players' games. Both have
extremely solid golf swings and
rely on their consistently straight
play from tee to green.
Several times these similar
styles have led to identical scores
in major tournaments. Both shot
151 in the City qualifying. And in
the 1970 U.S. Juniors at Athens,
Georgia, both shot 155 to survive
the 36 hole cut.
The two have also combined
for some incredible best ball
rounds in dual matches. In a
freshman match against Menlo
College they had a best ball score
of 64, destroying Menlo's strong
number one and two players.
Several days later they shot a best
ball 66 in a varsity match against
Fresno State.
Although Baskins admits that
"I have to improve a lot," he
hopes to play professional golf in
five or six years. First, though, his
main goals are to play in the
NCAA tournament this June and
to qualify for the U.S. Open.
Nilmeier has similar
professional aspirations and Coach
Finger has no doubts that the two
players could make it as pros.
"Both golfers certainly have the
potential to play on the tour," he
says, "especially since they're two
of the hardest workers we've ever
had."

BASKING IN GLORY—Dave Baskins has proved to be quite a
pleasant surprise to Coach Bud Finger. After an unimpressive start in
the fall, he has come on strong to make the varsity lineup.
If someone had told golf coach
Bud Finger last fall that he would
have four freshmen in the 1972
varsity lineup, Finger probably
would have laughed and
dismissed the thought as
ridiculous.
Of course Finger was counting
on freshmen Aly Trompas and
Bruce Robertson, two of the
nation's premier junior golfers, to
break right into Stanford's varsity
lineup. But two more freshmen?
Last fall that seemed nearly
impossible with such talented
upperclassmen as Gary Vanier,
Tom Keelin, Pete Harpster, Denny
Colvin, Dennis Conrad, and Jim
Dwulet on the squad.
But just six months later two of
Finger's strongest performers are
the "other freshmen," Conrad
Nilmeier and Dave Baskins. So far
this duo has accounted for some
of the most valuable points in
Stanford's dual matches and two
outstanding tournament efforts.
Most surprising is Baskins, who
was never even thought of as a
varsity contender after shooting
unimpressive rounds of
76-78-84-77 in fall qualifying.
While Baskins was struggling
toward his 315 total, Robertson,
Vanier, and Trompas shattered
par for four rounds, pushing
Baskins even farther out of varsity

consideration.
"I enjoy practicing," he says.
"And I know that the only way I
can play a really top calibre of
golf is to practice every day."
Baskins' hard work paid off in
the San Francisco City
championships, his first major
success here. After qualifying
easily with a 151 total, Baskins
upset former Northern California
Open Champion Sandy Galbraith,
4-2, in the first round.
"I think Dave's victory over
Galbraith gave him a real lift,"
said Finger. "When he beat
Galbraith he realized he could
compete with any of the top
amateurs in the country."
Baskins went on to win two
more matches before losing in the
quarterfinals.
Freshman Nilmeier also played
well in the City tourney but the
consistent player from Fresno
caught fire in his home town
when Stanford competed in the
Fresno State Classic. Nilmeier
shot 74-73-68 for a one under par
total of 215, good for second
place in the tournament.
Baskins also pointed to a
