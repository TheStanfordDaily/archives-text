# Reece Assists Pitchers To Victory
## 
### STAN WILSON 
Two weeks ago the varsity baseball team won the prestigious
Riverside Tournament; last weekend in unfriendly Los Angeles the
team won two of three games from defending champion USC. This
week a major magazine has ranked Stanford number one in the
country, another ranks them third.
One of the major reasons for the team's success has been the
consistent hitting and leadership of catcher Bob Reece.
Bob, a sturdy junior from Rancho Cordova, was named the Most
Valuable Player of the Riverside Tournament. He hit .385 for the
week, collected 11 RBl's, and played an outstanding defensive game.
"That was the biggest thrill I've had," Bob said, referring to his
selection as MVP. Coach Ray Young termed Bob's performance at
Riverside the best he'd seen in Bob's three years of varsity
competition.
But, "Bob's greatest asset is as a leader," according to Coach
Young. "He shows leadership in handling pitchers — he calms them."
And Coach Young attributed much of the success of this year's
pitching staff to Bob's leadership and consistency behind the plate.
In his freshman year Bob led the Pac-8 in hitting, and was named to
the All-Conference team. But he "slumped" last year, and shared
catching duties with Glen Johnson. After a fine season last summer at
Boulder, Colorado, Bob has regained his hitting touch, as well as
strengthened his throwing arm. But most importantly, with his success
last summer, Bob has gained confidence.
cnfidence is a major factor in all parts of the game, according to
Bob. "You have to know you can hit the ball." This confidence
carries over to the team level. "We had trouble getting up for the

weaker teams," Bob said, referring to a few early season losses. "But
we have confidence against the good teams ... we know what we can
do."
After graduation Bob's goal is the pro's, and he knows he will have
to be an excellent defensive catcher in order to make it. Bob
explained that the pro's look for a catcher first, and then look to see
whether or not he can hit. With this in mind, Bob has worked on
strengthening his throwing arm, and the work has paid off. "I like to
throw this year," Bob explained. "When they run I feel I can throw
them out."
Bob's attributes are impressive. He is extremely consistent — he is
experienced at handling pitchers, fields bunts well, and his fine
throwing arm has discouraged man would be base-stealers. But more
importantly, "he comes through with the hit when it's needed,"
explained Coach Young, an asset highly prized by the pro's.
Stanford will need continued clutch performances from Bob if it is
to capture the Pac-8 Southern Division. The Division, which consists
of Stanford, Cal, USC, and UCLA, is one of the strongest in the
country.
This weekend Stanford plays an important series with UCLA,
which is coming off a three game thrashing at the hands of Cal last
weekend. Friday, Coach Young will send soph Bob DiPietro, 6-2 for
the season, against the Bruins. Bob has now pitched 28 consecutive
scoreless innings, owns three shutouts, and has an overall ERA of
1.24.
On Saturday Stanford plays a doubleheader against the Bruins, the
first game starting at noon. Coach Young will probably start Nick
Peterson and, if healthy, Dan Shaw. Mike Higgins, Dave Frost, and
Tom Changnon may also see mound action.
