Fifteen schools, from California
and Arizona, have entered the
Women's Western Intercollegiate
Fencing Conference
Championships, to be held this
Friday and Saturday in Maples
Pavilion.
Approximately fifty women
will be competing in the annual
tournament in two divisions,
individual and team.
The individual tournament will

be held on Friday and the team
competition will be on Saturday.
Representing Stanford will be
senior Linda Chapin, junior Sue
Achor, and sophomore Judy
Green.
Stanford's fencing coach,
Jean Helliwell, is in charge of the
meet, and urges anybody in the
Stanford community to drop by,
as no admission charge will be
made. The fencing will continue
from 9 to 5 on both days.
