Baseball Strike Ends
NEW YORK — The baseball strike has ended, Marvin
Miller, executive director of the Major League Players
Association, announced yesterday.
The end to the strike came in its 13th day at an
estimated cost of $5 million to the owners through
postponements and the cancellation of one national
television game—monies which may or may not be made
up.
Miller made the announcement after one owner at a
meeting in Chicago had told the Associated Press that the
owners had proposed starting the season on Saturday,
without any postponed games made up or any pay for the
players for postponed games.
Agreement not to reschedule postponed games would
skirt the major issue still unresolved between the owners
and players—the issue of whether or not players would be
paid for rescheduled games played as part of a single
admission doubleheader.
Some teams would play more games than others if the
postponed games were not rescheduled, but the ultimate
winners of division championships at the end of the
season would be decided on the basis of won-lost
percentage.
Hijaeker Surrenders
LOS ANGELES — A Mexican man hijacked a Frontier
Airlines 737 jetliner from New Mexico to Los Angeles
yesterday, kept the crew at gunpoint while he was
interviewed on radio and television and then surrendered
his gun to the pilot.
He was taken off the plane in custody of FBI agents.
Authorities said there were no bullets in the gun.
He was identified by the Federal Aviation Administra
tion in Washington as Ricardo Chavez-Ortiz, 37, a
Mexican national with a history of psychiatric problems.
He told newsmen he is the father of eight.
He gave himself up about six hours after the plane was
hijacked.
P'or more than two hours the hijacker, at his insistence
to "tell my story," had been interviewed by three radio
and television newsmen at Los Angeles International
Airport.
To a live audience of thousands around Los Angeles, he
complained about injustices suffered by the poor.
"Thank God, ask God that I die, and I shall come back
and repay them for all that they have done to us," he said.
He talked about injustices to Mexican-Americans,
blacks, Orientals and other minorities. He described his
life as a chef, pilot and mechanic in Mexico, mentioning
low wages and the deteriorating environment.
"What kind of human beings are we?" he asked.

"People throw trash on the ground . . . and no one cleans
it up."
The Spanish-speaking hijacker was interviewed aboard
the plane at an isolated section of the airport, where it
had landed several hours before.
Kleindiensl Bloek Possible
WASHINGTON — Sen. Sam J. Ervin Jr. says he will try
to block the nomination of Richard G. Kleindienst as
attorney general unless White House aides, particularly
Peter Flanigan, are allowed to testify in the Senate
Judiciary Committee's ITT investigation.
Ervin, a committee member, said in an interview:
"I'm adamantly opposed to either the committee or the
Senate taking any action whatsoever until these aides
appear before the committee."
Ervin, regarded as an authority on constitutional law,
said the Nixon administration claim that executive
privilege covers communication between aides and people
outside the White House is absurd.
Executive privilege is the doctrine the Nixon
administration claims bars Congress from forcing execu
tive-branch officials and aides to testify.
The latest to join the growing opposition to the
nomination is Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the
assistant Democratic leader and a member of the
committee.
Sources close to Byrd said Wednesday he would vote
against Kleindienst unless Flanigan testifies in the
Judiciary Committee on his role in the out-of-court
settlement of three antitrust suits against ITT, one of the
biggest corporations in the United States.
Byrd told newsmen he would be influenced by either
Flanigan's refusal to appear before the committee or the
refusal of his superiors to let him testify.
852s Attack An Loc
SAIGON — Wave after wave of U.S. 852 bombers
battered the flaming rubber plantation of An Loc today in
an unprecedented wave of attacks to save the provincnial
capital north of Saigon from falling completely into North
Vietnamese hands. Government troops there are surround
ed and in danger of being overrun.
Nearly a score of the eight-jet Stratofortresses dropped
up to 500 tons of explosives on North Vietnamese troop
concentrations only a mile west of An Loc.
During the night, enemy gunners slammed 49 rockets
and mortars into the provincial headquarters and its
supply depots on the southern side of the city. The North
Vietnamese hold the northern half. Field reports said less
than 10 government troops were killed or wounded.
