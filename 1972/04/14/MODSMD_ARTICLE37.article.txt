# Houses Offer New Options
## 
### JANE BUSSEY 
As in every year, when students
choose housing this spring, they will
find that some old options have passed
out of existence and some new ones
have appeared. The reasons for the
changes are more complex than mere
administrative expediency or student
disinterest in some houses.
Proposals for changing the configu
ration, theme or sex composition of
houses or dormitories were submitted
to the 1972-73 Housing Configuration
Advisory Panel last quarter. As a result
of these proposals, three single sex
houses in Lagunita, Magnolia, Granada
and Olivio, will become co-educational
next year.
The changes instigated for next year
include a name change for a minority
house, two apartment-style houses,
two fraternities entering the draw and
two theme houses replacing the Beta
Chi and Phi Kappa Sigma houses.
Opposition to the sale of Beta Chi
and Phi Kappa Sigma houses to the
University, and to Kappa Sigma and
Phi Kappa Psi entering their houses in
the spring draw has been moderate or
nonexistent.
The Phi Kappa Sigma house was
sold by the building core, composed of
Phi Kap alumni, to the University
because the house has not been full to
its capacity of 30 for several years.
Last fall the members met and "we
decided we wanted to change," said
senior Bill Nolan.
The Phi Kaps originally wanted to
enter the house in the draw, but
alumni were more interested in pre
serving the structure than the frater
nity itself, according to Pete Sylvester,
associate general secretary. The Uni
versity agreed to spend up to $50,000
of a $116,609 donation to the
undergraduate men's housing program
for Phi Kappa Sigma improvements.
Nostalgia
Other than nostalgia, the reaction of
house members has been one of
acceptance, Nolan said. The 25 house
members "really enjoyed living to
gether," he explained, and belonging to
the national fraternity has not been
central for several years.
After renovation this summer, the
Phi Kappa Sigma house will become
the Dag Hammarskjold House. The
house, concentrating on international
culture, will be filled by a special draw
today.
Financial difficulties forced the
Beta Chi Corporation to sell its house
to the University. The University plans
to renovate the house over the summer
to prepare for Synergy House, a
cooperative designed under the guid
ance of Alan Strain, director of the
future Alternative Vocations Center.
When the Beta Chi fraternity was
failing last year, a group of past and
present Beta Chi residents formed a
corporation to continue administering

the hoise. They started with a
$20,000 loan from the University, said
Steve Mantis, former house manager
and former Stanford student.
This year, "the corporation agreed
with the University that the house
wasn't running right," he said. Accord
ing to Sylvester, the corporation itself
broached the subject of selling out.
The house was sold in winter for an
$11,000 outstanding debt; as a Univer
sity house, residents are paying rent to
the University this spring.
No Pressure
According to Mantis, there was no
pressure on the Beta Chi community,
but "a lot of people up here have the
feelings that the University is closing
down the house because it's uncon
trolable." But he added that the
opposition is moderate, any hard
feelings are "hitched up with resigna
tion."
In another change, the Kappa Sigma
and Phi Kappa Psi fraternities are both
entering the spring draw instead of
going through the traditional rush to
fill their houses.
Don Hunt, president of Phi Kappa
Psi, said that last fall "we couldn't get
enough males to fill the house and we
had to take boarders." The national
office did not like having boarders in
an affiliated fraternity, so the house
decided to add girls. Last fall 11 girls
were admitted to the fraternity in a
hand-picked draw.
No Opposition
Kappa Sigma decided to enter the
draw because most house members felt
that "rush is not the best situation"
for filling the house, explained Pete
Harpster, house president. Kappa Sigs
did not want to go co-ed, but "there
was absolutely no opposition to

entering the draw."
Another change which will go into
effect some time this year is changing
the name of Muir, in Stern Hall, to
Zapata. The trustees of Stern will have
no objection to changing the name
after the housing office and Chicano
students explain the name change to
them, according to Jeanne Campbell,
Stanford student in charge of coordi
nating the spring draw.
With the fifth increment of Escon
dido finished next fall, all single
students presently living in Hoskins
will be moved into the new apart
ments. The University is also restoring
Lasuen House, a duplex on Lasuen
which will be available to students on
a room-only basis.

sity house, residents are paying rent to
the University this spring.
No Pressure
According to Mantis, there was no
pressure on the Beta Chi community,
but "a lot of people up here have the
feelings that the University is closing
down the house because it's uncon
trolable." But he added that the
opposition is moderate, any hard
feelings are "hitched up with resigna
tion."
In another change, the Kappa Sigma
and Phi Kappa Psi fraternities are both
entering the spring draw instead of
going through the traditional rush to
fill their houses.
Don Hunt, president of Phi Kappa
Psi, said that last fall "we couldn't get
enough males to fill the house and we
had to take boarders." The national
office did not like having boarders in
an affiliated fraternity, so the house
decided to add girls. Last fall 11 girls
were admitted to the fraternity in a
hand-picked draw.
No Opposition
Kappa Sigma decided to enter the
draw because most house members felt
that "rush is not the best situation"
for filling the house, explained Pete
Harpster, house president. Kappa Sigs
did not want to go co-ed, but "there
was absolutely no opposition to

entering the draw."
Another change which will go into
effect some time this year is changing
the name of Muir, in Stern Hall, to
Zapata. The trustees of Stern will have
no objection to changing the name
after the housing office and Chicano
students explain the name change to
them, according to Jeanne Campbell,
Stanford student in charge of coordi
nating the spring draw.
With the fifth increment of Escon
dido finished next fall, all single
students presently living in Hoskins
will be moved into the new apart
ments. The University is also restoring
Lasuen House, a duplex on Lasuen
which will be available to students on
a room-only basis.
As in every year, when students
choose housing this spring, they will
find that some old options have passed
out of existence and some new ones
have appeared. The reasons for the
changes are more complex than mere
administrative expediency or student
disinterest in some houses.
Proposals for changing the configu
ration, theme or sex composition of
houses or dormitories were submitted
to the 1972-73 Housing Configuration
Advisory Panel last quarter. As a result
of these proposals, three single sex
houses in Lagunita, Magnolia, Granada
and Olivio, will become co-educational
next year.
The changes instigated for next year
include a name change for a minority
house, two apartment-style houses,
two fraternities entering the draw and
two theme houses replacing the Beta
Chi and Phi Kappa Sigma houses.
Opposition to the sale of Beta Chi
and Phi Kappa Sigma houses to the
University, and to Kappa Sigma and
Phi Kappa Psi entering their houses in
the spring draw has been moderate or
nonexistent.
The Phi Kappa Sigma house was
sold by the building core, composed of
Phi Kap alumni, to the University
because the house has not been full to
its capacity of 30 for several years.
Last fall the members met and "we
decided we wanted to change," said
senior Bill Nolan.
The Phi Kaps originally wanted to
enter the house in the draw, but
alumni were more interested in pre
serving the structure than the frater
nity itself, according to Pete Sylvester,
associate general secretary. The Uni
versity agreed to spend up to $50,000
of a $116,609 donation to the
undergraduate men's housing program
for Phi Kappa Sigma improvements.
Nostalgia
Other than nostalgia, the reaction of
house members has been one of
acceptance, Nolan said. The 25 house
members "really enjoyed living to
gether," he explained, and belonging to
the national fraternity has not been
central for several years.
After renovation this summer, the
Phi Kappa Sigma house will become
the Dag Hammarskjold House. The
house, concentrating on international
culture, will be filled by a special draw
today.
Financial difficulties forced the
Beta Chi Corporation to sell its house
to the University. The University plans
to renovate the house over the summer
to prepare for Synergy House, a
cooperative designed under the guid
ance of Alan Strain, director of the
future Alternative Vocations Center.
When the Beta Chi fraternity was
failing last year, a group of past and
present Beta Chi residents formed a
corporation to continue administering

the hoise. They started with a
$20,000 loan from the University, said
Steve Mantis, former house manager
and former Stanford student.
This year, "the corporation agreed
with the University that the house
wasn't running right," he said. Accord
ing to Sylvester, the corporation itself
broached the subject of selling out.
