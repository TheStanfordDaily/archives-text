A group of about 30 protestors,
most of them members of the Black
Student Union, yesterday marched
from a noon rally to the Faculty Club
to demand the firing of Head Chef
Arturo Lionetti for "repeatedly abus
ing Third World and women workers."
As faculty members looked on from
inside the Club, protestors began
picketing the front entrance shouting,
"Fire Lionetti," while a larger group
went to the back entrance and began
pounding on windows.
Three or four demonstrators at
tempted to enter the main dining
room, asking to see either Lionetti or
Prof. William Shockley, who was
eating lunch. However, Club manager,
Forrest Tregea, refused to allow them
in.
"The actions of these people have

been getting more serious recently,"
said Tregea. He alleged that on
Wednesday a Club member received an
elbow in the stomach.
Demonstrators said the picketing
will continue every day during lunch
until April 19, when Personnel Direc
tor Emil Sarpa is expected to decide
whether a hearing will be held as a
result of official grievances filed
against Lionetti by three Faculty Club
workers.
The purpose of the picketing,
according to Venceremos member
Juan Flores, an assistant professor of
German, "is to put pressure on the
administration and to create embar
rassment for faculty members."
Flores said that it remains to be
decided what action will be taken if a
hearing is denied.
