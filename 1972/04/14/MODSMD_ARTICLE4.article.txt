# FCM Members Awarded $1500 From Suit Against University
## 
### 
The University this week granted a
$1,500 settlement to six current or
former members of the conservative
Free Campus Movement (FCM) who
were suing Stanford for $1,050,000 in
damages for "recklessly or negligent
ly" controlling University premises
during a 1969 disruption in which
members of the FCM were attacked by
protesters.
The suit, which was announced on
May 12, 1970, resulted from a Dec. 4,
1969 protest against General Electric
at the Placement Center.
Beneficiaries in the suit are FCM
Chairman Chris Hocker, now a junior;
Ernesto Rael, also a junior; Harvey
Hukari, .Jr., who was then FCM
chairman; Roger Reed, then chairman
of the local Young Republicans and
now enrolled at Duke University Law
School; Craig Ostfeld, a graduate
student in physics at the time of the
incident; and Edward -Jaegls, a 1971
graduate.
The six were represented by Robert
Mosher and John Clark of the Palo

Alto firm of Wilson, Mosher, and
Santini. The two according to Rael,
will receive "somewhere near half" of
the settlement. The suit as filed
claimed $300,000 for general damages
and $750,000 in punitive damages.
After observing and photographing
the protest at the Placement Center
for about 15 minutes, the FCM
members left the area and were
followed by approximately 30 of the
demonstrators.
Several scuffles broke out between
the FCMers and the demonstrators as
the conservatives were chased around
Dinkelspiel Auditorium and into the
ground floor lobby of Tresidder
Union.
The fighting continued in the lobby
for about 20 minutes, according to the
Dec. 5, 1969 Daily, "despite attempts
by two plainclothes Stanford police
officers to calm the crowd." The two
were identified as former Stanford
Police Chief Tom Bell and Capt.
William Wullschleger.
The Stanford Police were specifical

ly mentioned in the suit as having
failed to protect the FCM members
from bodily injury. In a later Daily
article it was revealed that "nearby
squads of both Stanford police and
Santa Clara County Sheriff's Deputies
were not called in during the melee
despite requests from FCM members
for police aid."
At the time of the incident the
Daily said that "no serious injuries"
were sustained, although Reed "•
reported cuts, bruises, a bloody nose,
and a black eye." The suit alleged that
police negligence had resulted in the
six plaintiffs being "severely injured,
bruised and shocked."
The suit was part of a string of
similar legal actions which began with
the Columbia University protests of
1968. Hukari said this week that "the
suit has accomplished its purpose."
He explained that "the feelings of
Stanford administrators have changed.
The status of the Stanford Police
Department has been clarified and the
University is now dealing with violent
students and non-students."

The University this week granted a
$1,500 settlement to six current or
former members of the conservative
Free Campus Movement (FCM) who
were suing Stanford for $1,050,000 in
damages for "recklessly or negligent
ly" controlling University premises
during a 1969 disruption in which
members of the FCM were attacked by
protesters.
The suit, which was announced on
May 12, 1970, resulted from a Dec. 4,
1969 protest against General Electric
at the Placement Center.
Beneficiaries in the suit are FCM
Chairman Chris Hocker, now a junior;
Ernesto Rael, also a junior; Harvey
Hukari, .Jr., who was then FCM
chairman; Roger Reed, then chairman
of the local Young Republicans and
now enrolled at Duke University Law
School; Craig Ostfeld, a graduate
student in physics at the time of the
incident; and Edward -Jaegls, a 1971
graduate.
The six were represented by Robert
Mosher and John Clark of the Palo

Alto firm of Wilson, Mosher, and
Santini. The two according to Rael,
will receive "somewhere near half" of
the settlement. The suit as filed
claimed $300,000 for general damages
and $750,000 in punitive damages.
After observing and photographing
the protest at the Placement Center
for about 15 minutes, the FCM
members left the area and were
followed by approximately 30 of the
demonstrators.
Several scuffles broke out between
the FCMers and the demonstrators as
the conservatives were chased around
Dinkelspiel Auditorium and into the
ground floor lobby of Tresidder
Union.
The fighting continued in the lobby
for about 20 minutes, according to the
Dec. 5, 1969 Daily, "despite attempts
by two plainclothes Stanford police
officers to calm the crowd." The two
were identified as former Stanford
Police Chief Tom Bell and Capt.
William Wullschleger.
The Stanford Police were specifical

ly mentioned in the suit as having
failed to protect the FCM members
from bodily injury. In a later Daily
article it was revealed that "nearby
squads of both Stanford police and
Santa Clara County Sheriff's Deputies
were not called in during the melee
despite requests from FCM members
for police aid."
At the time of the incident the
Daily said that "no serious injuries"
were sustained, although Reed "•
reported cuts, bruises, a bloody nose,
and a black eye." The suit alleged that
police negligence had resulted in the
six plaintiffs being "severely injured,
bruised and shocked."
The suit was part of a string of
similar legal actions which began with
the Columbia University protests of
1968. Hukari said this week that "the
suit has accomplished its purpose."
He explained that "the feelings of
Stanford administrators have changed.
The status of the Stanford Police
Department has been clarified and the
University is now dealing with violent
students and non-students."
