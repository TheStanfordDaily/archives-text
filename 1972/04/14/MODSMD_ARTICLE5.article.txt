## Presidential Choice 
### 
It's not easy to decide who will do the best job of running the
trivia-engulfed ASSU presidency, and we are not overwhelmingly
impressed by any of the slates of candidates. Overall, however, we
believe the Burke-Wong-Appel-Van Petten slate offers the most
acceptable approach to the job.
Among the better-known slates, Chris Hocker and Robin
Friedman's only role as ASSU Presidents would be to schedule a
funeral for student government and to kill the ailing patient. We trust
Chris and Robin will continue to point out the ASSU's weaknesses.
But we would prefer a candidate who would work to maintain the
services still offered by the ASSU.
The Barber-Fay-Cortez slate has an overly narrow view of the ASSU
as a clearinghouse for pizza parlors and speakers' bureaus. Such
student services are crucial, but ASSU Presidents should also provide a
broader leadership for student interests on and off campus.
On the other hand, we fear that the SRM-backed "Collective"
would handle the demands of political protest but neglect the red tape
of student services. We respect the dedication and intelligence of the
Knutson-Wolf-Ho-Palmer ticket and particularly agree that student
funds should be raised to rehire Bruce Franklin. But we do not think
they would find the ASSU office — with all of its committees and
conferences — the most effective outlet for radical activism.
In the end, we recommend election of the Burke-Wong-Appel-Van
Petten ticket. They appear to offer the best prospects, both in
handling the ASSU bureaucracy and in leading broader student
interests. It appears that they still need to decide the delegation of
authority within their Council and to focus on particular projects.
But they have proposed an interesting "Nader's Raiders" approach
- creating task forces which would investigate areas of student
interests.
We think the Burke ticket has been less than honest in promising
that they — or anyone — could eliminate the "bullshit" from the
ASSU. But they appear to stand the best chance of making some
progress.
