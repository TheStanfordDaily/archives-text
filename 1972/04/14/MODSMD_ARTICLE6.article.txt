## An Effective Student Lobby 
### 
Virtually anything which can be written about
the ASSU is a cliche and is thus somewhat offensive.
Nevertheless, this does not alter the fact that there
are legitimate functions for the ASSU to perform,
nor does it in any way obscure the reality of
widespread dissatisfaction and resentment toward
the ASSU among the students.
While much of this resentment is justified by the
inaction, petty bickering, and political infighting
which has nearly always characterized the ASSU,
some of it arises from a fundamental
misunderstanding of the purpose of the ASSU and
of its relation to the students and the University.
This misunderstanding is the notion that the
ASSU is a government and should be judged by the
standards that apply to a government. Clearly, this
is not the case, for the ASSU does not possess the
two prerequisites of government — power and
money.
Because the ASSU is not a government does not
mean that it can do nothing and has no legitimate
function. Its basic purpose is threefold — to lobby
aggressively for student interests, to examine and
question present conditions, and to develop
alternatives to the university administration's
proposals which are counter to student interests and
desires.
Unorganized
The ASSU should not be abolished, for to do so
would only mean that student interests — which
often conflict with the desires of faculty,
administrators, and political groups with special
interests, — would cease to be represented in an
organized fashion.
It should not be made voluntary and converted
into an ineffective private club for student sandbox
politicos and prestige seekers.
It should not be given over to "moderate
conservatives" who will act merely as advisors to or
auxilaries of the administration.
Reform
It should not be given over to those who promise
to devote their attention solely to "student
services" while educational reform, the university's
connection to the military-industrial complex, and
issues of university governance go ignored.
It should take a leading role in bringing changes
beneficial to the students whom this university

ought to serve.
In the field of education, we will pressure for
mandatory use of the Student Evaluation of
Teaching Questionnaires and their inclusion in
tenure files. We will work to expand the student-run
course review, which was begun by the present
Council. We will lobby for inter-departmental
programs and residential education in order to
combat ossified educational structures.
Recycling
We will lobby to institutionalize recycling
throughout the University and to retire land in the
Stanford foothills as an agricultural reserve under
the Williamson Act.
We will push Stanford to effectively follow
through on its commitment to the minorities and
women. Stanford must equalize the male to female
undergraduate student ratio, and provide adequate
staffing and financing for minority programs.
There are crucial issues in University governance.
Students are currently subject to a judicial system
unilaterally established by the administration which
does not have proper safeguards for student rights.
Students are completely shut out of the University
budget-making process, though these decisions
vitally affect all of us.
Isolation
It is still possible for the individual researcher to
commit the University as an institution to
war-related research. This isolation of students from
University decision-making, coupled with the
impersonal bureaucracy, makes students mere
consumers of "education" and prevents the rise of
anything remotely resembling a community at
Stanford.
Not to be neglected is the operation of Tresidder
Union, which is teetering on the brink of
bankruptcy. Scott Burke has already pressured for
extensive changes which have been made in the
Food Service Area, and we will push and prod for
needed reforms.
We don't promise instant changes and
improvements — to do so would be dishonest,
though consistent with other candidates, past and
present. We will seek to fulfill the ASSU's function
with the admittedly limited means at our disposal.
