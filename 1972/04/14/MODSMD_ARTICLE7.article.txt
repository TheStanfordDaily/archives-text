## Improve Student Services 
### 
The ASSU has lost contact
with the student body. Too much
of the ASSU's attention has been
misdirected towards issues of only
marginal interest to Stanford
students, and politicians too often
choose issues that make good
headlines but bring few results.
One of our opponents made
headlines with the Tresidder issue,
but the real work for physical
improvement came from former
Food Service Director Lee
Schafer, and from the university
commissioned report by Carl
Hitchner.
Our opponent's report center
ed around a biting personal attack
on the Tresidder management,
which has only stiffened its
resistance to student-initiated
change. Moreover, his release late
last quarter of confidential finan
cial figures on projected Tresidder
losses accomplished nothing other
than the alienation of key admin
istrators. Results come from con
tinuous hard work, not from such
obvious political ploys for head
lines.
We feel that the ASSU must
produce concrete results next year
to regain the respect and support
of the student body. That means
working on issues that may not
make headlines, but that will
produce real improvements in
student life at Stanford. A Coun
cil of Presidents should earn its
anlarv thronoh harH work for

student interests, not through
personal ego trips.
Two of our Council members
plan to reduce their academic
loads to eight units per quarter
next year to allow them to devote
more time to the programs we
have outlined in our position
papers. We will concentrate on
three areas:
The ASSU presently faces
many opportunities to expand its
services to students. 1) Stanford
lacks a coordinated program of
prominent speakers. We will
initiate a speaker
series to bring important speakers
to campus. 2) Concerning
Tresidder Union, we will lobby
for the Hitchner proposals for
establishing a late-night pizza or
hamburger station, as well as
re-instituting snack truck
operations on campus. We will
continue the drive for additional
Tresidder services, such as the
proposed bank. 3) Stanford
students need a major used-book
outlet, and we will push for the
proposal now being studipd by the
Bookstore.
4) Our mechanism for
implementing these changes will
be the ASSU Student Services
Commission. It will coordinate
new student-run services, such as
the speaker series, and it will
expand existing ones. It will also
serve as the student lobby on
imivprsit.v-run services, such as

barber, cortez, Jay

Tresidder Union and the
Bookstore. 5) All these ideas
might not succeed without
adequate publicity; therefore, we
plan to distribute a bi-weekly
newsletter to increase student
awareness and support of these
services.
In 1969, the Student
Education Council (of which
Chuck Fay was a member), in
conjunction with the Academic
Senate, enacted several major
education reforms, notably
streamlining university-wide
degree requirements, abolishing
"D" and "F" grades, widening the
pass-fail option, and encouraging
inter-disciplinary majors. Student
input into educational reform
since then has dropped seriously.
The ASSU Council of Presidents
can and must rejuvenate student
involvement in • educational
reform.
We plan to work with the
Deans of both Undergraduate and
Graduate Studies to institute a
computerized course evaluation.
The University of Wyoming
presently has such an evaluation
which gives concise statistics for
each class, covering student
opinions on fairness of the exams,
quality and organization of the
lectures, worth of the reading, and
other issues.
A proposal for a San Francisco
Urban Campus to complement the
new Urban Studies major has

gained support in the past year.
Patterned after the Overseas
Campuses, this program would
benefit both San Francisco and
the students involved. As a
Council of Presidents, we will
publicize and push this proposal
to hasten its realization.
In recent years, students have
played an important role in social
action. While it is important that
the ASSU remain non-political,
we feel it should act as a
non-partisan supporter and
coordinator of student
involvement in social action.
Stanford should set an example of
ecological awareness. We are
sponsoring a referendum on the
Big Game Bonfire in this election.
We regard the bonfire as an easily
avoidable source of air pollution.
Moreover, student interest in the
Bonfire has dwindled. We urge all

students to vote against the
Bonfire.
We are also making the effort
to recycle our literature: please
use the recycling boxes we are
providing. Student input into the
national elections is important.
We will push voter registration on
campus, and try to bring the
candidates to campus in our
speaker series. We will push for
resolution of the current campus
judicial crisis through the new
student proposal presently before
the Committee of Fifteen.
Although our platform will not
make headlines, we feel that with
hard work it can be achieved. We
also believe that it deals with the
issues that most students are
concerned with. . . . Think about
it.
