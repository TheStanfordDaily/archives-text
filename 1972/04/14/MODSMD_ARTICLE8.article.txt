## Toward Voluntary ASSU 
### 
It has become increasingly
clear over the past several years
that substantial numbers of
Stanford students derive no
benefit from the activities of the
ASSU. This fact is evidenced by
low voter turnout, Senate
vacancies, botched elections, the
constant clamor of special interest
groups for their dollar, and
student politicians presuming to
speak for the Stanford
community.
Last year, we ran on a platform
of limiting student government to
those who desired it, of ensuring a
complete representation of all
student views at Stanford, and of
affirming the right of the
individual to decide voluntarily
which issues affect him and are
worthy of his time, effort, and
money. Our platform has not
changed since last spring.
As in previous campaigns, the
various candidates are offering
various schemes to bring
Relevance, Involvement, and
Action to Stanford students. If
students were faceless
interchangeable punchcards in a
vast cosmic computer, these
schemes might work.
But students, like everyone
else, are individuals with different

goals, ideals, and lifestyles; it is
absurd to pretend that these can
all be synthesized into a formless
mass, given the label "student
interests," and presented as
Gospel to the Stanford
administration and the world by
self-appointed spokesmen. Every
other serious candidate is calling
for the perpetuation of the
present system, based on the
premise that individuals or
voluntary groups of individuals
are incapable of handling their
own affairs.
Abolish System
We reject this pfemise and we
wish to abolish the present
system. One does not get drunk in
order to cure a hangover, and one
should not pretend to reform
student government by instituting
more of the same.
We include the following
specific points in our program:
1. Vigorous efforts to
encourage private businesses to
provide convenient services to
those students who desire them.
Establishment of such firms on
campus would not involve
subsidies either by the students or
by the University. This year's
Council of Presidents assures us
that a bank will be set up in
Tresidder next year. What other
benefits might have occurred had
not the Council been so eager to
Free Angela, Dump Nixon, and
"speak for student interests"?
0 Dollars
2. Continuation of the $0
option for the ASSU Program
Fee. By voting no money for the
Senate to play with, students have
missed nothing but the deals, the
bickering, and the fighting that
have characterized previous years.
3. Opposition to all
compulsory fee assessments.
Regardless of the sum of money
involved, forced "charity" is no
more than legalized coercion.
Those assessments which include
the negative option clause we
neither support nor oppose, but

hocker -friedman

wish to leave the decisions on
those to the discretion of the
individual student.
4. Absolute refusal to speak
for other Stanford students
regarding political and other
outside issues. We have attacked
the present Council's involvement
on behalf of Angela Davis and
George McGovern, among others,
but we would oppose similar
activities on behalf of any
candidate or issue.
Voluntary
5. Efforts to make the ASSU
voluntary. A Constitutional
amendment to that effect was
scheduled to appear on the ballot
but was killed by the ASSU
Senate on technical and political
grounds. Such an amendment
would have effectively measured
the extent of student discontent
with the ASSU structure, and it is
unfortunate to say the least that
they will not have the chance to
register their opinions on this
important matter.
It has been charged that, if
elected, we would do nothing.
Certainly, we would do nothing to
continue the absurdity that
students "need" a student
government that will gratify their
every wish upon demand. We
would do nothing to superimpose
our views upon 12,000 other
individuals.
But we would and could work
to increase the number of
alternatives in programs and
services that may be chosen and
paid for voluntarily, and we
would and could work to cut to a
minimum the expenses of student
government, over $80,000 of
which is presently subsidized by
the University out of tuition
money.
We believe that Stanford does
not need an ASSU, and that
changes and improvements can be
made without it. 'There is no
government like no government."
