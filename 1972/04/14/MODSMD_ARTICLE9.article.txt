## Issue Orientation 
### 
the collective

We have always been skeptical of Stanford student government
because it has been a rubber stamp of the Administration, a pretense
of student autonomy, or a stage for ambitious politicos. We have been
cynical of "working within the system" because that has too often
co-opted and evaded vital issues and movements. We have also been
critical of ourselves, questioning our own integrity and possible
hypocrisies.
And we have decided to run for the ASSU Council of Presidents
because it would indeed by a hypocrisy not to run, not to exhaust
every legitimate channel of change and to confront in all possible
ways the most vital and pressing issues facing us all: racism, sexism,
Stanford's complicity in the war, the control of the University by a
few men and a very few women and many others.
These are not academic issues. They are radical in the most literal
sense, for they challenge the very basis of our institutions and our
roles as Stanford students.
We will make student government confront these issues:
Issues
RACISM: Institutional racism permeates the University and must be
combatted in a two-fold manner; by fulfilling the needs of minorities
and making the practice of racism intolerable in the University.
SEXISM: Oppression of women in society has been reflected at
Stanford, including discriminatory admission quotas and the lack of
programs and faculty to serve the needs of women.
COMPLICITY IN THE WAR: The use of the Placement Center for
war-related and military recruiting, Dept. of Defense strings to money
grants and the usage of Stanford laboratories for research on how to
improve killing, are vital issues which should not be decided by a few
men who control Stanford in the interests of their war-profiteering
corporations but rather by the entire community.
Workers
WORKERS ISSUES: As a substantial segment of the Stanford
community, the lives, issues, and rights of workers should be of
importance and concern to the student body.
MENTAL ALIENATION: Students have lost control over their
own lives, find their identities at Stanford to be unwhole; we have
become intellectual commodities of the educational process,
socialized and trained, unable to express our humanness by making
the decisions that control our lives.
COMMUNITY CONTROL & DUAL POWER: Referenda of the
student body have been ignored by the
Administration . . . Committees making recommendations contrary to
Administrative interests have been ignored.
Illegitimate judicial systems have been railroaded through and
inquisitions begun. Bruce Franklin has been fired against student
opinion. We can assert community control only by creating dual
power and neutralizing the Administration's authority. This means
people realizing that they have control over their lives by simply
taking control over their lives.
Programs
In contronting these issues, we will use student goveniment to
accomplish as much of the following programs as possible:
—The creation of an ASSU Professorship and rehiring of Bruce
Franklin;
—The end of sexist admission quotas, and the creation of an
accredited Womens' Studies program also open to the community;
—The creation of a Committee to Investigate Racism or other
appropriate grievance mechanism so that charges of racism may be
brought to attention by any student, worker or faculty and be duly
redressed;
—A moratorium on all cases heard by the CJP until the new
University Judicial System (UJS) as proposed by the Student Senate
undergoes a referendum;
—Taking firm stands about the binding character of referendums
and legitimacy of student opinions;
Funding
—Seeking alternative funding for the University while opposing
strings to Federal grants;
—Opposing war-related research and implementing the
recommendations of the student referendum and Committee on
Student Services regarding the Placement Center;
—Supporting and implementing the expansion of the educational
program to provide night classes for workers and community people;
—Continual opposition to the decision-making structure of the
Board of Trustees and finding alternative ways for decisions
concerning the community to be made collectively.
—The creation of a drop-out center to help find viable alternatives
to an education at Stanford.
All the resources of the ASSU Council of Presidents would be used
to accomplish the programs and focus community attention on the
issues.
