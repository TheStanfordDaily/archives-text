# SEA, USE Campaign To Reject Teamsters
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
The two unions which lost the
March 7 election among University
workers to decide who would repre
sent them if any group in collective
bargaining have decided to oppose the
Teamsters Union, the leading vote
getter of the three.
Stanford Employees Association
(SEA) and United Stanford Employees
(USE) are both actively campaigning
against the Teamsters, who must win a
runoff election to represent employees
with the no union proposal this
Wednesday.
SEA is running an anti-Teamster ad
in Tuesday's Daily, and USE has
mailed out leaflets the past few days
urging workers to vote against the
Teamsters.
Promises And Lies
"They [Teamsters] have been put
ting out a lot of junk and propaganda
lately," Jim Berk, USE president, said.
"They're trying to buy the election.
You can win elections quite often with
promises and lies, but you can't
deliver. The Teamsters won't be able
to deliver anything."
"The Teamsters offer at a great cost
to us—employees, I mean—nothing
more than any other union could offer
for less. That's why I prefer home
organized and home-run organiza
tions," Forrest Futtere, SEA acting
president, told the Daily.
Both unions maintain that Stanford
needs a union, but both claim that the
Teamsters are worse than nothing.
"In their latest direct mailing, they
[Teamsters] claimed that they were
pleased with the number of SEA and
USE members changing over to the
Teamsters," Berk said. "Well, they
might have been pleased. But all I can
say is that they are quite easily
pleased. Not very many members of
either union have changed at this
point, and I don't expect that many of
them will."
No Sense Of Unity
Berk said that one of the chief
reasons his group had decided not to
back the Teamsters was that the San
Francisco based union has no "sense
of unity."
"If they do win the election, it will
be with a very narrow margin," Berk
said. "And that would mean that they
couldn't do anything. They would
have 30 or 40 percent of the workers
fighting them. If they wanted to pull a
strike, they couldn't do it, and that
just blows their whole hocus-pocus of
a strong union out the window.
"You can't win an election by
writing nice letters signed 'Sincerely,
Rudy Tham.' [Teamster organizer.]
You have to have some sort of unity
among the workers. If they were really
interested in unity, they would ap
proach us and ask us what we thought
about unity.
"But they won't do that. They're
too stupid to do that," Berk con
tinued. He pointed to Tham's attacks
on USE just after vote-counting on
March B—Tham called USE "destruc
tive" and accused the group of stalling
