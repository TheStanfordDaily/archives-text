The ASSU Program Fee of
$1.00 is a necessity to avoid the
tremendous onslaught of fee
referenda. Each year the student
body is bombarded by fee
referenda from many groups on
campus. Many times, these groups
need the money to carry on their
programs.
The ASSU Program Fee would
again return money to the Senate.
One of its functions is the
dispensing of money for groups
whose activities prove to be
worthwhile. This was the original
intent in providing the legislative
branch of student government
with the power to fund groups.
This alleviates the continual string
of fee assessments.
The program fees in the past
have provided support for a
spectrum of organizations
including theCardinals Board, Axe

Commission, Pom Pon Dollies,
Pre-Reg Board, KZSU, and the
Child Day Care Center.
Many people in the past have
accused the Senate of being
irresponsible concerning the
appropriation of the budget, but
at present there is a bill pending in
the By-laws Committee of the
Senate which would allow the
student body the final say in
appropriations. This bill would
allow a special referendum to be
held requesting the approval of

the budget by the student body.
The budget would not be
appropriated without the consent
of the student body.
We appeal to the common sense
of the student body. The ASSU
program fee would stop the
onslaught of special fee
assessments.
