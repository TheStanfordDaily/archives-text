Vote No
Editor, THE DAILY:
On the ballot Tuesday and Wednesday are three kinds of fee
assessment proposals: the ASSU program fee, special assessments that
will be mandatory if approved by the student body, and special
assessments that will have a refund option.
The ASSU Constitution and By-Laws, and ex-President Pitzer's
letter approving the Constitution on behalf of the Board of Trustees,
contain the following provisions for the program fee:
1. The University will insert with spring registration materials a
notice that (a) the referendum is scheduled for the indicated dates and
that (b) the Controller will consider the referendum results binding on
all students who enroll during the subsequent year. The University did
not insert such a notice in spring registration materials.
2. The ASSU Senate will prepare a detailed report of the mechanics
and program implementation options of the student vote. The
document must be made available to students at least fifteen days
prior to the first day of voting. The Senate has not prepared such a
report.
3. One-half of the program fees shall be remitted on a per capita
basis to divisional graduate and undergraduate student associations as
are recognized in the By-Laws. If a divisional association fails to meet
the requirements of the By-Laws for funding, its share of the fees shall
be immediately transferred to ASSU Underwriting Reserves.
No monies shall be disbursed or transferred from the ASSU
Underwriting Reserves without the approval of the student body.
Since only 20 percent of the student body is currently in divisional
associations, 40 cents of each one dollar fee will not be spent for
anything.
The organizations requesting special assessments and not providing
a refund option have both received special assessments in the past.
These organizations have made promises as to how the money would
be spent and whether they would ask for money again. On the basis of
their broken promises I intend to vote no on both fee assessments.
There is no provision in the ASSU Constitution for refundable fees.
In fact, the Constitution states just the opposite, "All registered
students of Stanford University . . . shall also be liable for such fees as
this association may assess."
However, the organizations requesting special assessments and
providing a refund option can receive money from students, while the
organizations' members pay no fees.
Each such organization, no matter how few students it has, claims
that its programs benefit the entire community. If their fee assessment
passes, students must pay the fees.
Then the task of getting a refund is given to the individual student,
many of them new to Stanford, and most of them unaware of the
organization's history.
On the basis of the fact that such fees are not truly voluntary, I
intend to vote no on all "refundable" fee assessments.
