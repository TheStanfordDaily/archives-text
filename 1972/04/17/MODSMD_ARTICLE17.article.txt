# 10 Hour Match
## Undefeated Golfers Tie SJ State 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
College golf matches are not
usually known for suspense. But
when Stanford and San Jose State
played to a 27-27 tie on the
Stanford course Saturday, there
was enough excitement for even
the rowdiest football fan.
Both teams came into the
match with unblemished records.
Stanford was 6-0 after an easy
49-5 victory over USF Friday
while the Spartans sported an
11-0 mark.
And after 36 holes and nearly
10 hours of competition, the

match came down to the final
putt of the final player on the
final green. Conrad Nilmeier,
playing with Dave Baskins in a
best ball match against San Jose's
Dean May and Phil Barry, had a
three foot putt on the 18th green
to win the match for Stanford.
But the ball slid past the hole and
the Cards had to settle for a 27-27
tie.
Of course, Nilmeier can't be
blamed for the tie. Each player
could remember several missed
three footers over the 36 holes
which would have meant a

Stanford victory.
Individual Matches
Two golfers who didn't have to
make any apologies were Gary
Vanier and Denny Colvin. Both
won individual matches in the
morning and were members of
winning best ball teams in the
afternoon.
Vanier shot 73 in the morning
to defeat San Jose's Roger
Maltbie, the second place finisher
at the Western Intercollegiate
championships three weeks ago.
Vanier later made crucial birdies
on the 10th and 11th holes as he
and Tom Keelin recorded a
comeback victory over Maltbie
and Chuck Eddie of the Spartans.
Vanier's clutch perfmrance,
coupled with a 71 Friday against
USF, proved that he is still
Stanford's number one man.
Colvin also played steady golf
throughout the day. He shot 74
on his morning victory over Phil
Barry and teamed with Bruce
Robertson to score a convincing
triumph over San Jose's Brian
Intester and Frank Mixter in best
ball play. Colvin's outstanding
effort was his second in two days.
He shot 72 against USF despite a
triple bogey 7 on the 18th hole.
Morning Sets
In the unique 36 hole format,
six individual matches were
played in the morning with six
points at stake in each match, two
on the front nine, two on the

back nine, and two for the 18.
Three best ball matches, also
worth six points each, were
played in the afternoon.
Stanford trailed 20-16 after the
morning matches. Vanier won 4-2
while Keelin and Colvin each won
6-0. Baskins, Nilmeier, and Steve
Collins all lost 6-0. Nilmeier shot a
respectable four over par 75 but
couldn't withstand an even par
performance by San Jose's Dean
May.
In the afternoon matches,
Vanier and Keelin won 4-2, Colvin
and Robertson won 5-1, and
Baskins and Nilmeier lost 4-2.
All those points added up to 27
for Stanford and 27 for San Jose
State. There was no winner, but
two of the nation's best golf
teams had produced plenty of fine
golf shots, a lot of
disappointments, and even some
genuine suspense.
