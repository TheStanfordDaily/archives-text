# Netters Crush Cal

The Stanford netmen clash
with UC Santa Barbara this
afternoon at 2:30 on the home
courts, after an eventful weekend
that saw the Cards stifle the
California Golden Bears, 8-1.
Stanford's top three racketmen
were performing in tournaments
across the country, and could not
participate in the Cal match.
Roscoe Tanner was in New York,
while Sandy Mayer and Chico
Hagey were in Seattle. As Coach
Gould put it, "We were pleased to
get out of there 8-1 against such a
fine team."
Stanford's lone loss came when
Rick Fisher, filling in the number
one spot, bowed to Steve
Stefanki, the California State JC
Singles Champion in 1969 and
1970. Freshman Jim Delaney,
who has been improving steadily
all season, squeaked by Peter
Campbell 7-6, 7-5. Delaney may
find himself on the regular
Stanford ladder before long. Gery
Groslimond crushed his opponent
as Chip Fisher easily defeated his
man.
Paul Sidone had some trouble
with Cal's Keith Bardellini, going
ahead 5-1 in the first set only to
have his serve broken twice
successively, bringing the score to
5-4. Paul Eventually won that set
and the match, after taking the
third set, 6-3.
Tim Noonan, dropped his first
set 2-6, but came back in fine
style to down Steve Bartlett,
former Hawaiian Juniors Champ.
Noonan owned the best shot of
the day, displaying a Rod Laver
backhand, as he sprinted full
speed to his left and just barely

glanced over his right shoulder.
The ball nicked the far right hand
corner and was simply
unreturnable.
Rick Fisher and Gery
Groslimond teamed up as a
doubles duo and managed victory
in three sets. Jim Delaney and
Chip Fisher easily dumped the
pair of Bartlett and Prouix. The
doubles combination of Rick
Evans and Mack Claflin defeated
Mike Caro and John Stefanki.
Against UCSB today many of
the regulars will be rested. Singles
will be Tim Noonan, Rick Evans,
Mack Claflin, John Wright, Chris
Chapin, and Brian Hahn.
