# $1 Per Quarter Request
## ASSU Program Fee Revived 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
Students will decide tomorrow and Wednesday whether
they want to pay $0 or $1 fall, winter, spring and summer
quarters to finance the proposed ASSU Program Fee for
next year.
If the proposed assessment passes by the required
majority, the money will be divided equally. Half will go
to the divisional associations and the other half to the
programs of various student organizations.
After hearing the proposed budget submitted by the
ASSU Financial Manager, the student Senate will decide
how much money each student organization is to receive.
The task of dividing this money makes up the main
portion of the Senate's work during spring quarter. In the
past, the allocation of these funds has caused much
controversy about the ability of the Senate to dispense
the money fairly.
Bitter Dispute
Two years ago the Senate became embroiled in a bitter
budget dispute which involved the Black Student Union,
white radical, and conservative senators. At that time both
MEChA,the Chicano student organization on campus,
and white radical senators denounced the BSU and the
conservative senators for banding together to cut the
budget allocations for both the Asian-American Student
Alliance and MEChA.
Last year, the student Senate fell out of favor with the
student body after it transferred funds out of the ASSU

Underwriting Reserve Fund to the ASSU Bail Fund
against student wishes made clear in an earlier
referendum.
Probably in reaction to what some students termed
"power politics", students passed two referenda last spring
which limited the power of the student Senate.
Students voted last year's ASSU Program Fee $0 out of
a choice between $0 to $5 by a vote of 2203 to 1835.
And even if students had voted to support the program
fee the Senate would not have done the budget allocation
as students themselves passed a proposed budget which
divided any amount of money passed to 23 different
student organizations by a fixed percentage.

Fee Assessment

Some problems have already arisen with this year's
proposed program fee budget. The mechanisms for
preparing a proposed budget for next year are already
behind schedule.
According to the Constitution, all student groups which
would like money for next year should have finished
incorporation procedures with the Dean's office by last
December. They also should have submitted a proposed
budget to the ASSU Financial Manager last quarter. As of
April 6,Financial Manager Tom Huseby had received
budgets from only three organizations.
Acting on Huseby's request, the Senate voted to amend
the by-laws for this year and rescind the December
deadline for incorporation and the winter budget deadline
for as long as possible.
Huseby said Friday afternoon that he now has budgets
from more than 10 organizations or student groups. He is
planning to accept budgets as late as possible before he
must present a proposed budget to the Senate. Of course,
if $0 passes again this year, his job becomes simpler right
away.
Potentially Efficient
Huseby is very much in favor of the package program
fee as a way of getting money to student organizations.
He is in favor of it even if it means the student body wants
to draw up the budget by percentage again this year,
rather than having the Senate work it out.
"The program fee is potentially a very efficient tool for
donating money to student organizations that need it,"
said Huseby. "Right now there are three organizations
with proposed special assessments on the ballot who
previously got money through the program fee.
'There are a lot of little groups that simply died out
when the $0 thing passed. The program fee system is
worth reviving. We should clean up the problems with it
and start over again. All these special assessments are
going to end up costing students more in the long run."

they want to pay $0 or $1 fall, winter, spring and summer

After hearing the proposed budget submitted by the
ASSU Financial Manager, the student Senate will decide
how much money each student organization is to receive.
The task of dividing this money makes up the main
portion of the Senate's work during spring quarter. In the
past, the allocation of these funds has caused much
controversy about the ability of the Senate to dispense
the money fairly.
Bitter Dispute
Two years ago the Senate became embroiled in a bitter
budget dispute which involved the Black Student Union,
white radical, and conservative senators. At that time both
MEChA,the Chicano student organization on campus,
and white radical senators denounced the BSU and the
conservative senators for banding together to cut the
budget allocations for both the Asian-American Student
Alliance and MEChA.
Last year, the student Senate fell out of favor with the
student body after it transferred funds out of the ASSU

Underwriting Reserve Fund to the ASSU Bail Fund
against student wishes made clear in an earlier
referendum.
Probably in reaction to what some students termed
"power politics", students passed two referenda last spring
which limited the power of the student Senate.
Students voted last year's ASSU Program Fee $0 out of
a choice between $0 to $5 by a vote of 2203 to 1835.
And even if students had voted to support the program
fee the Senate would not have done the budget allocation
as students themselves passed a proposed budget which
divided any amount of money passed to 23 different
student organizations by a fixed percentage.

Fee Assessment

Some problems have already arisen with this year's
proposed program fee budget. The mechanisms for
preparing a proposed budget for next year are already
behind schedule.
According to the Constitution, all student groups which
would like money for next year should have finished
incorporation procedures with the Dean's office by last
December. They also should have submitted a proposed
budget to the ASSU Financial Manager last quarter. As of
April 6,Financial Manager Tom Huseby had received
budgets from only three organizations.
Acting on Huseby's request, the Senate voted to amend
the by-laws for this year and rescind the December
deadline for incorporation and the winter budget deadline
for as long as possible.
Huseby said Friday afternoon that he now has budgets
from more than 10 organizations or student groups. He is
planning to accept budgets as late as possible before he
must present a proposed budget to the Senate. Of course,
if $0 passes again this year, his job becomes simpler right
away.
Potentially Efficient
Huseby is very much in favor of the package program
fee as a way of getting money to student organizations.
He is in favor of it even if it means the student body wants
to draw up the budget by percentage again this year,
rather than having the Senate work it out.
"The program fee is potentially a very efficient tool for
donating money to student organizations that need it,"
said Huseby. "Right now there are three organizations
with proposed special assessments on the ballot who
previously got money through the program fee.
'There are a lot of little groups that simply died out
when the $0 thing passed. The program fee system is
worth reviving. We should clean up the problems with it
and start over again. All these special assessments are
going to end up costing students more in the long run."
Students will decide tomorrow and Wednesday whether
they want to pay $0 or $1 fall, winter, spring and summer
quarters to finance the proposed ASSU Program Fee for
next year.
If the proposed assessment passes by the required
majority, the money will be divided equally. Half will go
to the divisional associations and the other half to the
programs of various student organizations.
