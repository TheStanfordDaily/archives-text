# Batsmen Take Two From Bruins
## 
### MIKE HERMAN 
Continuing its drive for the
Pacific Eight championship, the
varsity baseball team took a three
game series from UCLA at the
Sunken Diamond this weekend,
defeating the Bruins by scores of
4-3 and 4-2, before dropping the
third game, 3-1, in eleven innings.
With its weekend performance,
Stanford moved into a tie with
the University of Southern
California for temporary control
of first place of the Southern
Division. California was in first
place, but while Stanford was
entertaining UCLA, USC was
sweeping a three game set from
the Golden Bears, a situation that
left both the Cardinals and the
Trojans with identical 4-2 records
in conference action.
UCLA began the first game by
scoring a tally in the opening
inning. Shortstop Luis Comez
opened the game with a walk
from Stanford pitcher Bob
DiPietro and came all the way
around to score on a double to
centerfield by the next batter,
third baseman Ken Egusa.
DiPietro then worked his way out
of the inning without allowing
another run.
The Cards responded in the
bottom of the second inning when
catcher Bob Reece opened with a
single to center. Second baseman
Dave Edson then followed with a
single to left field and, in an
unusual play, Reece and Edson
combined for a double steal, the
stocky catcher sliding into third
ahead of the throw.
With runners in scoring
position, shortstop Joe Lamour
responded with a double to
rightfield, scoring both runners.
After DiPietro grounded out,
third baseman Mickey Aguirre
singled to center, driving home
Lamour. Centerfielder Tom

Williams then lined into a double
play to end the inning.
Fifth Home Run
In the top of the sixth, the
Bruins got one run back when
clean-up hitter, Bob Adams,
belted his fifth home run of the
season. The drive cleared the
left-center field fence just over the
375 foot sign.
DiPietro, whose personal record
of twenty-eight scoreless innings
had been snapped in the first
inning, allowed another run in the
next inning. With two out and the
pitcher at the plate, the Stanford
lefthander permitted Bruin
reliever Steve Smith to line a
double to right. Luis Gomez then
walked and Ken Egusa followed
with a single to left driving in
Smith with the tying run. DiPietro
subsequently induced the Uclans'
leading hitter, Earl Altshuler to
strike out ending the inning.
In the bottom of the inning,
the Cardinals appeared to by
about to break the ballgame wide
open when they had four of the
first five batters single. Aguirre
opened with a single but was
erased on a doubleplay by
Williams. Singles by pinchhitter
Mike Nelson, first baseman Mark
Lucich and left fielder Rod Boone
loaded the bases, only to have
Reece strikeout.
The game entered the ninth
inning tied at 3-3.
Winning Run
With one out Williams singled
sharply to left and was replaced as
a runner by Kim Hannaford.
Andy Bielanski, batting for
rightfielder Mike Nelson, drew a
walk, moving Hannaford to
second. With the Bruin infield in
double play position, Mark Lucich
slashed a hot ground ball to first
baseman Eric Swanson, who
threw the ball toward secondbase
for a force or a possible double
play. The ball apparently slipped
from his hand and ended up in
left field, as Hannaford came
around to score the winning run
on the throwing error.
The Saturday doubleheader
followed very closely the script of
last weekend's series. The Cards
were forced to come from behind
to win the first game and then
were defeated in the nightcap
because of an inability to hit in
clutch situations.
The opener might well have
been termed a one man show.
Pitcher Nick Peterson went all the

way for a five-hit win that
captured the series for Stanford.
However, Peterson also had a
perfect day at bat, getting three
hits in three at bats, while scoring
two runs and driving in another.
The Stanford left hander, who
entered the game with a batting
average below .120, led off the
third inning by belting a 355 foot
homerun over the rightfield fence.
One inning later, he doubled in
second baseman Dave Edson with
a blast to center, only to be
thrown out attempting to stretch
the hit into a triple. To complete
his amazing performance,
Peterson singled in the sixth, once
again following a one-base hit by
Edson, and was driven in himself
on a double by Mickey Aguirre.
Victory Margin
Those last two runs proved to
be the margin of victory in the
seven-inning first game. UCLA
had managed to put two singles
and a walk together to score the
initial run of the ball game in the
first inning. Then, in the top of
the sixth, left fielder Mark
Swedlow tied a 2-1 ball game by
clearing the rightfield barrier with
a 365 foot homerun.
The second game was one of
repeated frustration for the
Cardinals. UCLA was spotted an
unearned run in the third inning
when Ken Egusa reached first base
on an error by Dave Edson, was
singled to second by Eric Swanson
and scored when Edson threw
wildly past first baseman Tim
Wilson in an attempt to complete
an inning-ending doubleplay.
Stanford had several
opportunities to tie the score in
the game, getting at least one
runner on in each of the first eight
innings except the fifth. Yet, until
the bottom of the eighth, they
were unable to score. In the
eighth, the Cards were finally able
to combine their hits to produce a
rally.
Surprise Pinchhitter
Mickey Aguirre opened the
inning with a walk. With one out,
Mike Nelson, pinchhitting for Bob
Hampton, was intentionally
walked. Tom Williams, in a
surprise pinchhitting appearance
for Rod Boone, then singled to
rightfield, scoring Kim Hannaford,
who was running for Aguirre.
With the go-ahead runs on first
and second, Reece struck out.
With two outs, Dave Edson was
walked to load the bases. Joe

Lamour then grounded to
shortstop Luis Gomez, who
dashed to second base ahead of
the sliding Edson.
The game continued into extra
innings with both teams being
retired in the tenth. In the top of
the eleventh, Dan Shaw, the
Stanford ace who was coming
back off a sore arm, apparently
tired as he was roughed up for a
leadoff double down the thirdbase
line by Mark Swedlow.
After getting the next two
batters on infield outs, Shaw
seemingly had escaped the inning
when he got Earl Altshuler to hit
a fly ball to right-center field.
Centerfielder Glen Johnson
appeared to have the ball within
range, but, at the last minute,
dove and missed the ball.
Swedlow scored on the play and
Altschuler wound up at second
with a double. Luis Gomez singled
to left field, scoring Altshuler.
Shaw then retired pitcher Steve
Smith, the eventual winner, to
end the inning.
Trailing by two in the bottom
of the eleventh, Stanford was
unable to generate any offense.
In defeat, there was one bright
spot for Stanford in the fine
comeback pitching of Dan Shaw.
Shaw, who was forced to miss the
USC series because of a sore arm,
was very effective through his first
ten innings, allowing no earned
runs, while striking out four
Bruins. In suffering his first loss
against seven consecutive

victories, the Stanford righthander
played an exceptional fielding
game as well, snagging several
difficult shots back to the box.
The defeat that ended a nine
game UCLA losing streak was
primarily the result of a lack of
clutch hitting by the Cardinals.
Coach Ray Young commented
after the game that, "The way
we're playing right now, our big
guys are killing us; our little guys
are coming through." In the
doubleheader, the fourth, fifth,
and sixth positions in the order,
the heart of the lineup, were
without a single hit in seventeen
official at bats. For the
three-game series, the team, as a
whole batted only .261 compared
with a .290 seasonal average.
During the next week,
Stanford, now 29-9-1, will travel
to Stockton to battle the
University of Pacific, before
meeting California over the
weekend. The Cards will play a
single game on Friday up at
Berkeley, before converging on
the Sunken Diamond again on
Saturday for a doubleheader.

BOPPING THE BEARS—Gery Groslimond, this years number six
singles player teamed with Rick Fisher to win a doubles match against
Cal last Saturday. This weekend Greslimond will be out to avenge a
earlier defeat to USC's Sashi Menon when the Cards face the Trojans.
