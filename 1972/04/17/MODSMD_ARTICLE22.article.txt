Apollo 16 Launched
SPACE CENTER, Houston —
America's Apollo 16 explorers
streaking toward the moon yesterday
were told to board their lunar lander
earlier than planned because
something was causing the outer
coating of the craft to shred away.
They were not immediately able to
determine the reason and no changes
were ordered in the mission. The
astronauts themselves were not
considered by ground control officials
to be in any danger.
Navy Capt. John W. Young, Air
Force Lt. Col. Charles M. Duke Jr. and
Navy Lt. Cmdr. Thomas K. Mattingly
II were smoothly launched into earth
orbit, riding the thrust of a 36-story
Saturn 5 rocket, at 9:54 a.m. PST.
Violence Rocks Belfast
BELFAST — Three British soldiers
were shot to death by gunmen in
Northern Ireland in a Sunday of
rioting.
Two of the soldiers were killed in
Londonderry in separate incidents and
the third died of wounds in a hospital
in Belfast.
The deaths of the three soldiers, one
an officer, raised the fatality toll ot
306 in Ulster's three years of strife
between the rival Protestant and
Roman Catholic communities.
Gun battles and riots raged
throughout most of the day in
Londonderry and Belfast, the capital.
The violence was touched off by

Saturday's shooting of 25-year-old
Joseph McCann, a Belfast commander
of the leftist Official wing of the
outlawed Irish Republican Army.
The shootings and heightened
tension threatened the British policy
of seeking peace in the province by
conciliation.
Princeton ROTC Protest
PRINCETON — Students protesting
the continuation of the ROTC
program at Princeton University
occupied the faculty room in Nassau
Hall for more than 18 hours before
walking out peacefully Saturday.
The 110 students hoped to block a
Saturday meeting of the Board of
Trustees, which had voted January 16
to negotiate with the Army, Navy and
Air Force to renew ROTC contracts.
800 March Against War
WASHINGTON - About 800 antiwar
demonstrators, members of the
People's Coalition for Peace and
Justice, staged a two-mile peaceful
sidewalk march on the White House

Saturday and an estimated 200 were
arrested when they sat down and
refused to leave Lafayette Park, across
the street from the executive mansion.
A half dozen others were arrested
when those who left the park blocked
traffic on 16th St. on the side of
Lafayette Park away from the White
House.
Less Inflation ?
WASHINGTON — Price Commission
Chairman C. Jackson Grayson
predicted yesterday that consumer
price figures to be released later this
week will show that the economic
stabilization program is beginning to
reduce inflation.
But Grayson said that if the
Consumer Price Index is not down, the
commission will take tougher action to
control prices.
He predicted that, with the possible
exception of food, prices included in
the index would show a downward
trend.
