### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
In an announcement Friday, Presi
dent Richard W. Lyman made public
his acceptance of Charles A. (Chuck)
Taylor's surprise resignation as Stan
ford's Director of Athletics.
Taylor asked to be relieved per-

manently of his duties in the midst of
a nine month sabbatical scheduled to
end this September. Acting Athletic
Director Robert Young will continue
to supervise the department until a
successor is named.
Lyman indicated that a search
committee headed by Geology Profes
sor Benjamin Page would be appointed
immediately. The committee will in
clude students, faculty, staff, and
alumni.
Last November, Taylor announced
his intention to take a nine month
leave of office beginning January 1 to
rest up before continuing his work
with the Stanford athletic program.
No indication was given at the time
that Taylor's sabbatical would lead to
his retirement.
No specific reason was given for
Taylor's resignation, but it is antici
pated that he will now devote more
time to his very successful mountain
camp for boys and girls during the
summer months. Taylor will continue
his association with Stanford, how
ever, through volunteer fund raising
work for the capital fund campaign for
a new swimming and handball com
plex. Taylor will also be active in Buck
Club activities.
Having headed the Athletic Depart
ment since 1963, Taylor was respon
sible for the continued success of
Stanford intercollegiate sports. He
brought John Ralston to the Farm and
together they built one of the nation's

top football programs. Lyman stated
that "Chuck Taylor's tenure as athletic
director has been highly successful.
He'll be sorely missed."
Taylor was a consensus All-Ameri
can guard for Stanford in 1942 and
moved into the freshmen coaching
position soon after graduation. Moving
to the San Francisco 49'ers for a brief
stint as line coach, Taylor came back
to Stanford as head football coach in
1951 and took his first varsity to the
Rose Bowl. Taylor moved into an
administrative post at the end of the
1957 season.
