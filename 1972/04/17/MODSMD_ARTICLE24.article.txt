# Firemen To Negotiate Contract
## 
### 
Stanford firefighters, who voted 39-0 in favor of union representation last
month, Friday began negotiating a binding contract with the University
administration.
They apparently are the first firemen in Santa Clara County to begin
negotiating a contract with their employers. Other local firemen work under
"memos of understanding" and "agreements."
The firemen are members of Local 1-12, International Association of Fire
Fighters, AFL-CIO. They have been actively seeking union recognition since
1970.
Local president Dal Brown, a Fire Department captain, said he hoped a
contract could be worked out before June.
Friday's session, which lasted an hour and a half, was attended by 11
peopleâ€”five of the six 1-12 executive board members, the local's attorney, David
W. Leahy, and five people representing the University administration. The group
is slated to meet again next Monday afternoon.
Tony Spitaleri, the group's secretary-treasurer, said that salary is not the main
issue in the negitiations. He told the Daily that most of the issues to be
negotiated revolve around extended insurance for firemen and their families,
revised seniority and retirement plans, and changes in the present probationary
period regulations.
