# Six Vie For School Board
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Voters will go to the polls tomor
row to select one of six candidates for
the Palo Alto Unified School District
Board of Trustees.
The candidates are Doug Garrett,
18, a chartmaker and member of
Venceremos; Gregory Kerber, 28, a
tennis instructor; Eleanor Kraft, 35, an
attorney; Sally Siegel, 61, a housewife;
Ted Vian, 42, an attorney; and
Virginia Williams, 38, a housewife.
Vian, a graduate of Stanford Law
School, is considered the frontrunner.
Desiring "to improve the educational
process at lower per pupil cost," Vian
has called for year-round schools
which he feels would reduce the need
for physical facilities.
'Inequitable Distribution'
Siegel claims that class size can be
reduced because "there is an inequit
able distribution within each school
building" as to the number of students
per class.
In order to reduce costs, Siegel
proposes to get rid of the excess
"hardware. We have wall-to-wall car

peting on top of wall-to-wall carpet
ing," she says.
Regarding the drug problem, Siegel
commented, 'The school district has a
responsibility to every student who
comes to school in a non-educable
state," and added, "We need to have a
closer relationship between the school
and the home over and above academ
ic matters."
'Chop It Off'
Kraft feels that one source for
additional funding would be to "chop
it off the Administration and off the
top."
Kraft also has suggested that parents
be allowed to choose which of the
"drastically" different kinds of schools
they would like their children to
attend. Some parents prefer more
formal structures, she said, and should
be able to decide accordingly.
Conservative
Asserting that "the school should
not be a laboratory where educational
theories are tested," Williams, the only
real conservative in the race, stated
that schools are "not academic enough
and should stress reading, writing, and
math."
On the question of drug abuse,
Williams said, "They need medical
help, not counseling. I would rather
see the school stick to education" and
teaching students about the effects of
drugs.
Williams concluded, "I think a child
who is undisciplined should have
discipline in school. I think you should
tell the kid how to behave, not pat
him on the head and send him back to
do the same thing again ... I think
that a lot of the family problems have
been caused by the schools."
Revamp Curriculum
Garrett, who graduated last year
from Cubberley High School, recom
mends revamping the curriculum so

that it would include "other philoso
phies that are left out." He cited most
history books as claiming to be
objective when they are really not. He
added that "few black authors" and
"no socialist authors" are currently
being studied in the schools.
Contending that "the fundamental
problem in this election is the growing
dissatisfaction and alienation among
students," Kerber feels that anyone
whose life is affected by the schools
"should have power to say what goes
on at the institution." This includes
students, staff, and everyone within
the school district who is interested.
Five polling places will be open
tomorrow from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. The
polling places are located at Tresidder
Union, the Campus Recreation Center
off Bowdoin Ave., Escondido School,
Nixon School, and the residence of
Professor Carl Brand, 433 Gerona Rd.
