# 10 Students Charged In Council 'Disruption'
## 
### 
The University administration Fri
day filed charges against 10 students
with Campus Judicial Panel chairman
John Kaplan, accusing the group of
violations of the Fundamental Stand
ard and the disruption policy by
intruding upon and disrupting a March
31 Academic Council meeting.
The names of the 10 will not be
released until the defendants decide
whether to be tried publicly or in
private, according to Kaplan.
Filed by Special Assistant to the
President John Schwartz, the com
plaints contain specific accusations,
unlike charges in earlier CJP cases,
which Schwartz wrote in more general
language.
The new specificity apparently
resulted from an opinion by Hearing
Officer Stephen Tennis, who requested
more precise charges while recom
mending acquittal for Don Zweig, and
from defense objections to the vague
ness and ambiguity of Schwartz's
charges in a case against Kwonping Ho,
stemming from a Faculty Club disrup
tion.
In three separate counts, Schwartz
accused each of the 10 defendants of
violating the Fundamental Standard
by "intruding upon and refusing to
leave a closed meeting of the Aca
demic Council and University staff."
