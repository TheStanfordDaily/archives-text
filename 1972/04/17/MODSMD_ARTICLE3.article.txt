# 'Minor' Candidates Present Diverse Views
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
The four "minor" ASSU Presidential candidate
slates offer platforms ranging from "entertainment
ism" to Young Socialism. One member of one slate
is currently at a Stanford campus abroad.
The four slates are: James Anderson-William
Chaplin; John Kenney-Barry Porster; Bill Legard
and Jeff Wyden; and Dave Rudick and Bruce
Douglas.
Anderson is a junior in political science and
Chaplin, a sophomore in psychology, is now at
Stanford-in-Germany. Leaflets circulated around the
campus in their behalf call the two "not just
another pretty slate." The literature says that
Anderson and Chaplin take a dim view of "glib
campus politicos who parade long lists of
'qualifications' and more promises than Hubert
Humphrey on slick, expensive campaign literature."
The leaflets go on to say that "the ASSU joke
will not stop with just a new set of comedians." The
statements criticize the past and present ASSU
leadership for using their positions as "pulpits"
from which they "push their own political
philosophies."
The Anderson-Chaplin literature says that the
ASSU "should rather exist as a device to initiate,
maintain and improve student services." The
literature suggests "that all special fee assessments
be made voluntary and refundable."
Kenney-Porster
Kenney, a freshman, and Porster, a graduate in
Slavic Languages, are members of the Stanford

Young Socialists. They state in their platform that
they wish "to drive [Electrical Engineering Profes
sor William] Shockley off campus" and "to
mobilize the entire working class to take power."
The Young Socialists are a predominantly
worker-oriented organization. Asked by the Daily
how they, as student leaders, planned to "mobilize"
workers, Kenney explained that they wished to
"establish revolutionary leadership for the working
class."

Presidential Slates

Kenney went on to say that "all the questions
which workers face are present at Stanford." Porster
says that the slate wants to "force students to take
the side of the working class, to stop thinking of
themselves only as students."
Kenney and Porster expressed concern that
minority student enrollment would suffer as a result
of President Lyman's planned Budget Adjustment
Program (BAP) cuts.
The fourth slate, headed by sophomore "Wild
Bill" Legard, has focused its campaign on "the
major issue on campus: The Entertainment Gap."
The slate also favors reversal of the recently
announced tuition, room and board increases.
Legard and running mate Jeff Wyden also favor
"50-50 ratio for male-female admissions." Wyden
said such a ratio is "guaranteed to improve
entertainment everywhere." The slate also proposes
moratoria on Campus Judicial Panel hearings and on
war-related industries recruiting at the Placement
Center.

The specifics of the Legard-Wyden entertainment
platform include the reopening of Frost Amphi
theater, getting "some good concerts and good
managing of them" and "free live bands on
campus."
Wyden told the Daily that ideological similarities
between his slate and the Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement (SRM) backed "Collective" could cut
into the support of the latter slate. Wyden said that
such an affect was not intentional on his or Legard's
part.
Rudick-Douglas
The efforts of the Rudick-Douglas slate are not
intended to be "a campaign for a candidate. It's a
campaign for an idea." The Rudick-Douglas
platform calls for "a new president every week."
Rudick feels that the current ASSU Presidents
"have done absolutely nothing." He says that the
ASSU should be "used as an experimental theater"
rather than being viewed as a "microcosm of
national government."
Acting Presidents
The specific experimental program which Rudick
and Douglas propose is to have acting presidents
who rotate on a weekly basis and who "have ideas
for projects." The president and vice president
would assist "them in implementing these ideas and
would leave politics to individual organizations
which are better suited for that purpose."
Rudick told the Daily yesterday that it took him
"a couple of months" to devise his proposal, which
he says is aimed at "restructuring the role of the
Presidency into one that's responsive."
