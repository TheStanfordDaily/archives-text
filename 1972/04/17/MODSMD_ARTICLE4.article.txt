# Vietnam War Escalates; Plaza Rally Set Today
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Hundreds of United States bombers
attacked targets in and around the
North Vietnamese cities of Hanoi and
Haiphong yesterday in the heaviest
Vietnam air raids in four years.
Radio Hanoi said last night that
"hundreds of civilians were killed and
hundreds wounded" in the attacks. A
Pentagon official indicated there
would be further raids until the North
Vietnamese offensive in the South was
halted.
A White Plaza rally protesting the
bombing is scheduled for noon today,
with Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich,
Religion Prof. Robert McAfee Brown,
and German Prof. Juan Flores the
principal speakers.
Stanford President Richard W.
Lyman said last night that "I don't
know whether I'm more depressed or
angry" at the new attacks.
"People have been led to believe
that the war was winding down," he

told the Daily. "Now we find ourselves
engaged in a game of you-knock-the
ch ip -off-my-shoulder-I'll-knock-the
chip-off-your-shoulder. It would all be
really childish if meanwhile people
weren't being killed."
Lyman said he expected to do
"more" to oppose the new bombing
than he did during the 1970 Cambodia
crisis, when he authored a highly
critical letter to President Nixon.
"I expect to try to get closer to the
center of the decision-making pro
cess," he said, although he added that
he had "no concrete plans" at the
moment.
Fuel Supplies
The U.S. Command in Saigon said
that yesterday's raids were aimed at
fuel supplies outside the two cities,
but a Defense Department spokesman
in Washington refused to rule out the
possibility that later strikes may be
directed against Haiphong's critical
port facilities.
Radio Hanoi claimed last night that
five planes, including a B-52 Strato
fortress, were downed over the capital,
and that five more smaller planes were
shot down over Haiphong, 55 miles
east.
The U.S. announced losses of two
planes, and claimed that three Rus
sian-built MIG 21's had been destroy
ed by air-to-air missies.
The strikes marked the first time
since 1968 that Haiphong had been
attacked, and the first time that Bs2's
had ever been used against the port
that is the main funnel for military
supplies.
Diverse Group
A group of wide-ranging political
views met yesterday at the home of
Genetics Prof. Leonard Herzenberg to
discuss plans for today's rally.
Ehrlich told the group that the new
bombing strikes represented "a further
escalation of what is already a
world-renowned atrocity."
Brown termed Nixon's stated inten
tion to wind down the war "a
rhetorical lie."
Others at the meeting ranged from
suspended students Pete Knutson and
Paul Loeb of the Association of Young
Crows and ASSU Visiting Professor
Dave Josephson to Dr. Hal Holman,
executive head of the Medical Center,
and Robert Moulton, Jr., associate
director of the Stanford Linear Accele
rator Center.
At a later meeting at Columbae
House, it was decided to hold a mass
meeting tonight at 8 p.m. A location
for the meeting had not been decided
upon as of last night.
Siege Continues
Meanwhile, as American warplanes
pounded the North, the siege of the
South Vietnamese town of An Loc
continued, with conflicting reports
from the scene leaving the situation in
doubt.
The Associated Press reported yes
terday that the South Vietnamese
defenders of the town claimed it was
in "full government control.
However, United Press International

reported yesterday afternoon that a
house-to-house battle was underway in
the town, located near the ancient
imperial capital of Hue.
The U.S. Command reported that a
medical evacuation helicopter had
been downed at An Loc, and that two
fighter-bombers and one helicopter
had been shot down elsewhere in
South Vietnam.
One of the F4 Phantoms was hit by
a surface-to-air missile near Dong Ha,
some 10 miles south of the Demilitar
ized Zone. The other was lost 10 miles
northeast of Saigon.
Meanwhile, Radio Hanoi reported
that several Russian sailors were
injured when a U.S. bomb at Haiphong
damaged a Soviet freighter. There was
no official reply to the accusation,
which, if true, could have severe
implications for President Nixon's
forthcoming visit to Moscow.
Radio Hanoi and the Communist
party newspaper Nhan Dan also
claimed an all-night U.S. Navy bom
bardment of targets preceded yester
day's attacks. They said the Navy
"continually shelled" a stretch of
some 170 miles of North Vietnamese
coastline before the air strikes.
Talks Still Stalled
The Paris Peace Talks remained
stalled through yesterday, with each
side blaming the other for the delay.
The North Vietnamese delegation
charged that the United States had
offered on April 1 to resume the
negotiations in secret, and had then
canceled the offer after North Viet
nam accepted.
U.S. Ambassador William J. Porter
admitted the secret offer, but said that
the "only response to this overture
came in the form of a mushrooming
invasion of the Republic of South
Vietnam by North Vietnamese
troops."
Nixon had ordered the talks sus
pended indefinitely on March 23,
charging that North Vietnam was using
the conference solely for propaganda
purposes.
Senate Majority Leader Mike Mans
field (D-Mont.), on his way to the
People's Republic of China with
Minority Leader Hugh Scott, said in a
Honolulu stopover yesterday that the
renewed bombing "means the war will
be lengthened, rather than shortened."
Democratic presidential hopeful
Sen. Edmund Muskie of Maine an
nounced he would introduce a Senate
resolution today calling for an im
mediate end to "all American military
activity, whether land, sea, or air,
against the territory of North Viet
nam."
Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D.)
termed the bombing "a reckless act,"
while Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D-
Minn.) called the action "very danger
ous."
Sen. Barry Goldwater (R.â€”Ariz.)
expressed support for the decision,
saying, "I've been advocating this for
nine or 10 years. With our accurate
bombing, I feel there's no worry about
hitting civilians."

A White Plaza rally protesting the
bombing is scheduled for noon today,
with Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich,
Religion Prof. Robert McAfee Brown,
and German Prof. Juan Flores the
principal speakers.
Stanford President Richard W.
Lyman said last night that "I don't
know whether I'm more depressed or
angry" at the new attacks.
"People have been led to believe
that the war was winding down," he

told the Daily. "Now we find ourselves
engaged in a game of you-knock-the
ch ip -off-my-shoulder-I'll-knock-the
chip-off-your-shoulder. It would all be
really childish if meanwhile people
weren't being killed."
Lyman said he expected to do
"more" to oppose the new bombing
than he did during the 1970 Cambodia
crisis, when he authored a highly
critical letter to President Nixon.
"I expect to try to get closer to the
center of the decision-making pro
cess," he said, although he added that
he had "no concrete plans" at the
moment.
Fuel Supplies
The U.S. Command in Saigon said
that yesterday's raids were aimed at
fuel supplies outside the two cities,
but a Defense Department spokesman
in Washington refused to rule out the
possibility that later strikes may be
directed against Haiphong's critical
port facilities.
Radio Hanoi claimed last night that
five planes, including a B-52 Strato
fortress, were downed over the capital,
and that five more smaller planes were
shot down over Haiphong, 55 miles
east.
The U.S. announced losses of two
planes, and claimed that three Rus
sian-built MIG 21's had been destroy
ed by air-to-air missies.
The strikes marked the first time
since 1968 that Haiphong had been
attacked, and the first time that Bs2's
had ever been used against the port
that is the main funnel for military
supplies.
Diverse Group
A group of wide-ranging political
views met yesterday at the home of
Genetics Prof. Leonard Herzenberg to
discuss plans for today's rally.
Ehrlich told the group that the new
bombing strikes represented "a further
escalation of what is already a
world-renowned atrocity."
Brown termed Nixon's stated inten
tion to wind down the war "a
rhetorical lie."
Others at the meeting ranged from
suspended students Pete Knutson and
Paul Loeb of the Association of Young
Crows and ASSU Visiting Professor
Dave Josephson to Dr. Hal Holman,
executive head of the Medical Center,
and Robert Moulton, Jr., associate
director of the Stanford Linear Accele
rator Center.
At a later meeting at Columbae
House, it was decided to hold a mass
meeting tonight at 8 p.m. A location
for the meeting had not been decided
upon as of last night.
Siege Continues
Meanwhile, as American warplanes
pounded the North, the siege of the
South Vietnamese town of An Loc
continued, with conflicting reports
from the scene leaving the situation in
doubt.
The Associated Press reported yes
terday that the South Vietnamese
defenders of the town claimed it was
in "full government control.
However, United Press International

reported yesterday afternoon that a
house-to-house battle was underway in
the town, located near the ancient
imperial capital of Hue.
The U.S. Command reported that a
medical evacuation helicopter had
been downed at An Loc, and that two
fighter-bombers and one helicopter
had been shot down elsewhere in
South Vietnam.
One of the F4 Phantoms was hit by
a surface-to-air missile near Dong Ha,
some 10 miles south of the Demilitar
ized Zone. The other was lost 10 miles
northeast of Saigon.
Meanwhile, Radio Hanoi reported
that several Russian sailors were
injured when a U.S. bomb at Haiphong
damaged a Soviet freighter. There was
no official reply to the accusation,
which, if true, could have severe
implications for President Nixon's
forthcoming visit to Moscow.
Radio Hanoi and the Communist
party newspaper Nhan Dan also
claimed an all-night U.S. Navy bom
bardment of targets preceded yester
day's attacks. They said the Navy
"continually shelled" a stretch of
some 170 miles of North Vietnamese
coastline before the air strikes.
Talks Still Stalled
The Paris Peace Talks remained
stalled through yesterday, with each
side blaming the other for the delay.
The North Vietnamese delegation
charged that the United States had
offered on April 1 to resume the
negotiations in secret, and had then
canceled the offer after North Viet
nam accepted.
U.S. Ambassador William J. Porter
admitted the secret offer, but said that
the "only response to this overture
came in the form of a mushrooming
invasion of the Republic of South
Vietnam by North Vietnamese
troops."
Nixon had ordered the talks sus
pended indefinitely on March 23,
charging that North Vietnam was using
the conference solely for propaganda
purposes.
Senate Majority Leader Mike Mans
field (D-Mont.), on his way to the
People's Republic of China with
Minority Leader Hugh Scott, said in a
Honolulu stopover yesterday that the
renewed bombing "means the war will
be lengthened, rather than shortened."
Democratic presidential hopeful
Sen. Edmund Muskie of Maine an
nounced he would introduce a Senate
resolution today calling for an im
mediate end to "all American military
activity, whether land, sea, or air,
against the territory of North Viet
nam."
Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D.)
termed the bombing "a reckless act,"
while Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D-
Minn.) called the action "very danger
ous."
Sen. Barry Goldwater (R.â€”Ariz.)
expressed support for the decision,
saying, "I've been advocating this for
nine or 10 years. With our accurate
bombing, I feel there's no worry about
hitting civilians."
Hundreds of United States bombers
attacked targets in and around the
North Vietnamese cities of Hanoi and
Haiphong yesterday in the heaviest
Vietnam air raids in four years.
Radio Hanoi said last night that
"hundreds of civilians were killed and
hundreds wounded" in the attacks. A
Pentagon official indicated there
would be further raids until the North
Vietnamese offensive in the South was
halted.

told the Daily. "Now we find ourselves
engaged in a game of you-knock-the
ch ip -off-my-shoulder-I'll-knock-the
chip-off-your-shoulder. It would all be
really childish if meanwhile people
weren't being killed."
Lyman said he expected to do
"more" to oppose the new bombing
than he did during the 1970 Cambodia
crisis, when he authored a highly
critical letter to President Nixon.
"I expect to try to get closer to the
center of the decision-making pro
cess," he said, although he added that
he had "no concrete plans" at the
moment.
Fuel Supplies
The U.S. Command in Saigon said
that yesterday's raids were aimed at
fuel supplies outside the two cities,
but a Defense Department spokesman
in Washington refused to rule out the
possibility that later strikes may be
directed against Haiphong's critical
port facilities.
Radio Hanoi claimed last night that
five planes, including a B-52 Strato
fortress, were downed over the capital,
and that five more smaller planes were
shot down over Haiphong, 55 miles
east.
The U.S. announced losses of two
planes, and claimed that three Rus
sian-built MIG 21's had been destroy
ed by air-to-air missies.
The strikes marked the first time
since 1968 that Haiphong had been
attacked, and the first time that Bs2's
had ever been used against the port
that is the main funnel for military
supplies.
Diverse Group
A group of wide-ranging political
views met yesterday at the home of
Genetics Prof. Leonard Herzenberg to
discuss plans for today's rally.
Ehrlich told the group that the new
bombing strikes represented "a further
escalation of what is already a
world-renowned atrocity."
Brown termed Nixon's stated inten
tion to wind down the war "a
rhetorical lie."
Others at the meeting ranged from
suspended students Pete Knutson and
Paul Loeb of the Association of Young
Crows and ASSU Visiting Professor
Dave Josephson to Dr. Hal Holman,
executive head of the Medical Center,
and Robert Moulton, Jr., associate
director of the Stanford Linear Accele
rator Center.
At a later meeting at Columbae
House, it was decided to hold a mass
meeting tonight at 8 p.m. A location
for the meeting had not been decided
upon as of last night.
Siege Continues
Meanwhile, as American warplanes
pounded the North, the siege of the
South Vietnamese town of An Loc
continued, with conflicting reports
from the scene leaving the situation in
doubt.
The Associated Press reported yes
terday that the South Vietnamese
defenders of the town claimed it was
in "full government control.
However, United Press International

reported yesterday afternoon that a
house-to-house battle was underway in
the town, located near the ancient
imperial capital of Hue.
The U.S. Command reported that a
medical evacuation helicopter had
been downed at An Loc, and that two
fighter-bombers and one helicopter
had been shot down elsewhere in
South Vietnam.
One of the F4 Phantoms was hit by
a surface-to-air missile near Dong Ha,
some 10 miles south of the Demilitar
ized Zone. The other was lost 10 miles
northeast of Saigon.
Meanwhile, Radio Hanoi reported
that several Russian sailors were
injured when a U.S. bomb at Haiphong
damaged a Soviet freighter. There was
no official reply to the accusation,
which, if true, could have severe
implications for President Nixon's
forthcoming visit to Moscow.
Radio Hanoi and the Communist
party newspaper Nhan Dan also
claimed an all-night U.S. Navy bom
bardment of targets preceded yester
day's attacks. They said the Navy
"continually shelled" a stretch of
some 170 miles of North Vietnamese
coastline before the air strikes.
Talks Still Stalled
The Paris Peace Talks remained
stalled through yesterday, with each
side blaming the other for the delay.
The North Vietnamese delegation
charged that the United States had
offered on April 1 to resume the
negotiations in secret, and had then
canceled the offer after North Viet
nam accepted.
U.S. Ambassador William J. Porter
admitted the secret offer, but said that
the "only response to this overture
came in the form of a mushrooming
invasion of the Republic of South
Vietnam by North Vietnamese
troops."
Nixon had ordered the talks sus
pended indefinitely on March 23,
charging that North Vietnam was using
the conference solely for propaganda
purposes.
Senate Majority Leader Mike Mans
field (D-Mont.), on his way to the
People's Republic of China with
Minority Leader Hugh Scott, said in a
Honolulu stopover yesterday that the
renewed bombing "means the war will
be lengthened, rather than shortened."
Democratic presidential hopeful
Sen. Edmund Muskie of Maine an
nounced he would introduce a Senate
resolution today calling for an im
mediate end to "all American military
activity, whether land, sea, or air,
against the territory of North Viet
nam."
Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D.)
termed the bombing "a reckless act,"
while Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D-
Minn.) called the action "very danger
ous."
Sen. Barry Goldwater (R.â€”Ariz.)
expressed support for the decision,
saying, "I've been advocating this for
nine or 10 years. With our accurate
bombing, I feel there's no worry about
hitting civilians."
Hundreds of United States bombers
attacked targets in and around the
North Vietnamese cities of Hanoi and
Haiphong yesterday in the heaviest
Vietnam air raids in four years.
Radio Hanoi said last night that
"hundreds of civilians were killed and
hundreds wounded" in the attacks. A
Pentagon official indicated there
would be further raids until the North
Vietnamese offensive in the South was
halted.
A White Plaza rally protesting the
bombing is scheduled for noon today,
with Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich,
Religion Prof. Robert McAfee Brown,
and German Prof. Juan Flores the
principal speakers.
Stanford President Richard W.
Lyman said last night that "I don't
know whether I'm more depressed or
angry" at the new attacks.
"People have been led to believe
that the war was winding down," he

told the Daily. "Now we find ourselves
engaged in a game of you-knock-the
ch ip -off-my-shoulder-I'll-knock-the
