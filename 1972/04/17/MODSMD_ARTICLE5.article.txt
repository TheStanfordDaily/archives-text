## Fee Assessments 
### 
DAILY-PUBLICATIONS BOARD
We urge a YES vote on the Daily-Publications
Board fee assessment.
The assessment will ensure a high quality Daily
next year, will save students money, and is part of
the Daily's plan to become entirely self-supporting
and independent within three years.
The ASSU Publications Board part of the
assessment will help other student publications
publish on a regular basis and will help build up
advertising revenue and staff-all necessary require
ments for viable publications.
AFRO-AMERICAN
We would welcome the influx of black
entertainers and speakers at Stanford which a YES
vote on the $1 Afro-American Program Fee for next
fall would provide.
The events financed by the money would be open
to the whole community and would be an
expansion of the already active black cultural
program now aimed at the black community alone.
The $12,000 budget would give $4,000 to the
Real News, $4,000 to bring well-known black
speakers to campus, $2,000 for entertainers and
films, and $2,000 to give children of the
surrounding black community a chance to come on
campus for these events.
ASSU PROGRAM FEE
We urge a NO vote on the $1 per quarter ASSU
Program fee.
No one in the University knows exactly where
the money will go if the assessment passes. As of
last Thursday's Student Senate meeting, only three
organizations budgets had been submitted to the
ASSU Financial Manager; these allocated 60 percent
of the Program fee to themselves. To permit more
budgets to be submitted, the Student Senate, with
questionable constitutional validity, waived some of
its rules. This fee request is ill-conceived, hastily
organized, and of dubious value.
We are not opposed to an ASSU package fee with
student organization budgets clearly delineated. If
the number of fee requests needing a minimum of
$1 for one quarter on the ballot proliferates, a
program fee may need to be reinstated.
CITIZENS ADVOCATES
The Daily does not take a position on the three
year refundable fee request of Citizens Advocates
Inc. The public interest law firm will affect students
as citizens; it will not be a legal aid society for
students.

Citizens Advocates, with the research support and
ability of the University, would aid the public in the
areas of consumer and environmental protection,
civil rights, and discrimination against the poor.
Students will be encouraged to wofk for the
group but will not directly benefit from any of its
activities.
Students should consider whether they wish to
fund such an organization.
SPECIAL EVENTS
The Daily does not take a position on the
proposed Special Events fee assessment. To have
"name" entertainers here, it has become clear that
students must expect to continually provide
subsidies every few years, a departure to underwrite
concerts on a break-even or profit basis. Poor
management and severe promotional problems here
caused a loss of $20,000 of the $40,000 assessed.
The politics of Bay area music, personified by Bill
Graham, and the wide variety and amount of
entertainment already available to students places
Stanford in an underdog competitive position.
But benefits do exist for students in a
comprehensive entertainment program on campus.
Ticket prices are lower and the time and expense of
traveling are saved with local shows. Entertainment
naturally lends a sense of community to Stanford.
It must be noted that a No vote does not
preclude entertainment next year. The small shows
and dances which broke-even or made profits can be
continued with the $20,000 still remaining in the
fund. A Yes vote may provide more big-name shows
on campus.
KZSU
We urge a YES vote on the proposed KZSU fee
assessment.
KZSU deserves the support of the community on
the basis of its news, entertainment, and public
affairs broadcasts. Half of the requested money will
be used for a larger transmitter, which may enable
the station to receive funding from such agencies as
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the
federal government. The money will also enable the
station to become stereo in the near future.
Since KZSU, in its status as an educational,
non-profit station, is prohibited from carrying
advertising, the money from the assessment will
help meet operating expenses and provide for the
above mentioned improvements in the station's
broadcast range.
We hold KZSU to its promise, however, that it
will not seek more than a one-quarter assessment for
operating expenses next year, an assessment which
will hopefully be phased out.
