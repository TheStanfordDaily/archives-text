For many people, Senior year means off-campus living, finalization
of post-graduate plans, and increased personal independence. By
graduation, whatever sense of community that existed four years
previously has vanished in the wake of the autonomous individual.
We don't plan to recreate Freshman yearâ€”first, it's impossible,
second, we're not so sure that everyone would want to. But we do
believe that the 1500 people who came to Stanford in the Spring of
1969 have much to share with one another.
Whether you were in the streets that Spring or just waiting in your
dorm, whether you were in the stands at Pasadena or listening to the
broadcast on the Armed Forces Overseas Radio, there were people
there with you, members of your class, members of the Stanford
community.
We feel that the Senior class officers have a responsibility to
maintain or increase the integrity of the class, administering the
money individual members have pooled since Freshman year to
provide activities that a greater percentage of the class would want to
attend.
Happy hours would be augmented by "Senior Sunday" barbeques,
a Senior publication to replace the Quad could possibly be funded and
published, and graduation exercises could become more than simply a

role call if a challenging speaker is selected to address a class which has
shared some common experiences in its final year at Stanford.
The offices of the Senior class are positions of service not politics.
As participating members of the community, having participated in
student publications, athletics, the Bonfire committee, and alumni
affairs, we believe ourselves to be both capable and willing and urge
you to vote on Tuesday and Wednesday.

If you will be a senior next year we would like to represent you as
officers of the Class of 1972.
A major objective of ours is not only to organize and inform seniors
of their graduation activities but especially to seek their opinions on
speakers for these programs.
We also hope to expand other class functions beyond the
traditional senior "happy hour" according to opinions expressed by
seniors in a questionnaire.
We plan to provide as much or as little activity as seniors indicate
they would support.
