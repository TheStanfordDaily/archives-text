## Daily Funds Aid Independence

The Stanford Daily-ASSU
Publications fee assessment asks
$1 per student per quarter to
ensure viable, healthy student
publications.
The Daily will receive $1 per
student for winter, spring and
summer quarters (no money for
fall quarter) from the assessment.
For most students that means
they are paying only $2 a year to
read over 130 issues of the
Daily—less than 2c per issue. This
year students are paying double
that for the Daily—4 per year ($2
for fall quarter, and $1 for each
quarter after that).
In many ways the question of
whether students want to support
this fee assessment depends on
whether they think Stanford
needs a daily student newspaper
and want it the cheapest way
possible. In the past, the Daily has
needed student money to produce
a high quality newspaper. This
year the student fee assessment
takes on added meaning since the
money is needed to help the Daily
on its road to independence.
To students independence will
mean one thing—they will stop
paying for the Daily. The Daily
has committed itself to phasing
out its student fee assessment.
The newspaper intends to ask for
only $1 for one quarter (plus
summer quarter) next year and no
money the year after that. The
Daily has requested that the
University maintain its block
assessment at the current level for
three years.
Advertising Revenue
By the 1975-76 school year the
Daily will be existing solely on
advertising income and the
newspaper will continue to be
distributed free. During the three
year transition period the Daily
staff will have to work hard to
build up the necessary cash
reserves and advertising revenue.
This will require an annual 10
percent increase in advertising
revenue—a difficult but, it is
believed, attainable goal.
Furthermore, in this year's fee
assessment plan there is a refund
option. Each quarter, if a student

doesn't read the Daily and doesn't
feel that he should pay for the
Daily, the student will be able to
receive a refund of the money he
paid.
This fee assessment will ensure
a healthy Daily for year's to
come. Without it, the current
independence plans will be
seriously, perhaps fatally,
jeopardized. Two alternative
results are foreseeable: the Daily
would be distributed only to
subscribers (subscriptions would
cost an estimated $12 per year) or
the Daily would be required to
make continued fee assessment
requests in order to continue as at
present.
No Future Charge
The basic choice is therefore
between a $2 assessment next
academic year and $1 for the
following year from each student
and no charge thereafter against
$12 per year forever for those
students wishing to read the
Daily.
In the last year the average
paper size of the Daily has
increased dramatically (from
about 5.5 to about 7.5 pages), the
circulation has increased two

thousand, and such features as
entertainment and Associated
Press news have increased
substantially.
The business management of
the Daily continues to improve. A
very large deficit two years ago
has been turned into a profit
allowing the Daily to ask for half
the money received last year and
to plan to entirely eliminate the
fee assessment within a few years.
Student funds have always been
a significant source of revenue for
the Daily and must be continued
for two more years to ensure that
independence is achieved on a
sound financial basis.
Publications Board
The autumn quarter portion of
the fee assessment (also
refundable) will go to the ASSU
Publications Board, composed of
members of five campus
publications. The Board performs
a general administrative and
coordinating function among the
various publications in the Storke
Student Publications
Building—the Daily, the
Chaparral, the Sequoia, the
Blotter, and the Quad.
In general, these publications

are small and individually require
only small amounts of money.
For this reason, the Publications
Board as a whole is requesting $1
a year from the students to
support these campus publications
other than the Daily until they
become self-sufficient.
The fall quarter mon«y will be
used over a two-year period.
About 20 percent will be used for
basic improvements in the Storke
Publications Building and for
setting up a common business
operation for the publications.
The rest of the money will be
used directly for publication
operations themselves in the form
of subsidies for existing
publications and in an initiative
fund for the use of new
publications.
The money is not designed as a
permanent subsidy or to pay off
past debts, but rather as start-up
capital to ensure regular
publication, a reliable advertising
base, and an experienced staff—all
basic requirements tor a viable
publication.

following year from each student
and no charge thereafter against
$12 per year forever for those
students wishing to read the
Daily.
In the last year the average
paper size of the Daily has
increased dramatically (from
about 5.5 to about 7.5 pages), the
circulation has increased two

thousand, and such features as
entertainment and Associated
Press news have increased
substantially.
The business management of
the Daily continues to improve. A
very large deficit two years ago
has been turned into a profit
allowing the Daily to ask for half
the money received last year and
to plan to entirely eliminate the
fee assessment within a few years.
Student funds have always been
a significant source of revenue for
the Daily and must be continued
for two more years to ensure that
independence is achieved on a
sound financial basis.
Publications Board
The autumn quarter portion of
the fee assessment (also
refundable) will go to the ASSU
Publications Board, composed of
members of five campus
publications. The Board performs
a general administrative and
coordinating function among the
various publications in the Storke
Student Publications
Building—the Daily, the
Chaparral, the Sequoia, the
Blotter, and the Quad.
In general, these publications

are small and individually require
only small amounts of money.
For this reason, the Publications
Board as a whole is requesting $1
a year from the students to
support these campus publications
other than the Daily until they
become self-sufficient.
The fall quarter mon«y will be
used over a two-year period.
About 20 percent will be used for
basic improvements in the Storke
Publications Building and for
setting up a common business
operation for the publications.
The rest of the money will be
used directly for publication
operations themselves in the form
of subsidies for existing
publications and in an initiative
fund for the use of new
publications.
The money is not designed as a
permanent subsidy or to pay off
past debts, but rather as start-up
capital to ensure regular
publication, a reliable advertising
base, and an experienced staff—all
basic requirements tor a viable
publication.

The Stanford Daily-ASSU
Publications fee assessment asks
$1 per student per quarter to
ensure viable, healthy student
publications.
The Daily will receive $1 per
student for winter, spring and
summer quarters (no money for
fall quarter) from the assessment.
For most students that means
they are paying only $2 a year to
read over 130 issues of the
Daily—less than 2c per issue. This
year students are paying double
that for the Daily—4 per year ($2
for fall quarter, and $1 for each
quarter after that).
In many ways the question of
whether students want to support
this fee assessment depends on
whether they think Stanford
needs a daily student newspaper
and want it the cheapest way
possible. In the past, the Daily has
needed student money to produce
a high quality newspaper. This
year the student fee assessment
takes on added meaning since the
money is needed to help the Daily
on its road to independence.
To students independence will
mean one thing—they will stop
paying for the Daily. The Daily
has committed itself to phasing
out its student fee assessment.
The newspaper intends to ask for
only $1 for one quarter (plus
summer quarter) next year and no
money the year after that. The
Daily has requested that the
University maintain its block
assessment at the current level for
three years.
Advertising Revenue
By the 1975-76 school year the
Daily will be existing solely on
advertising income and the
newspaper will continue to be
distributed free. During the three
year transition period the Daily
staff will have to work hard to
build up the necessary cash
reserves and advertising revenue.
This will require an annual 10
percent increase in advertising
revenue—a difficult but, it is
believed, attainable goal.
Furthermore, in this year's fee
assessment plan there is a refund
option. Each quarter, if a student

doesn't read the Daily and doesn't
feel that he should pay for the
Daily, the student will be able to
receive a refund of the money he
paid.
This fee assessment will ensure
a healthy Daily for year's to
come. Without it, the current
independence plans will be
seriously, perhaps fatally,
jeopardized. Two alternative
results are foreseeable: the Daily
would be distributed only to
subscribers (subscriptions would
cost an estimated $12 per year) or
the Daily would be required to
make continued fee assessment
requests in order to continue as at
present.
No Future Charge
The basic choice is therefore
between a $2 assessment next
academic year and $1 for the
following year from each student
and no charge thereafter against
$12 per year forever for those
students wishing to read the
Daily.
In the last year the average
