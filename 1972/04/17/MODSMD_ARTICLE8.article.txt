## The 						Air War Expands 
### 
- loeb and rabine

Saturday, U.S. B-52's and
fighter bombers launched massive
bombing raids on Haiphong and
Hanoi. This is the first time since
1968 that these areas have been
bombed and the bombing has
never been this heavy.
It is not as though we weren't
warned. Qn Friday
"administration officials"
announced that B-52's would be
used for heavy raids throughout
North Vietnam. They described
the bobbing as "a calculated risk,
in view of the possibility that
intensive use of the planes might
create a negative reaction here and
abroad."
There have already been large
protest marches in Paris and
Stockholm. Whether there is any
"negative reaction" here is up to
us.
Nixon is attacking population
centers in North Vietnam because
there is nothing else left for him
to do short of pulling out or using
nuclear weapons. The people's
offensive in South Vietnam is
succeeding everywhere, and the
South Vietnamese army is
obviously helpless and
demoralized. (Estimates of ARVN
desertion rates are as high as
12,000 troops per month.)
American air power has not been
a decisive force in the fighting in
South Vietnam and American
ground forces just won't fight
anymore.
Death
So Nixon is trying to wreak as
much death and destruction on
the Vietnamese as possible,
hoping to force them to call of
their offensive as well as showing
any other country that would
dare to challenge U.S. domination

that the U.S. is willing to destroy
any country on earth to save it for
"the free world" (free to U.S.
trade and investment). They
won't call off their offensive, but
they may have to accept what is,
to us, unimaginable civilian
suffering.
The only force we see which
has the possibility of preventing
that death and destruction is a
massive "negative reaction" right
here at home. In 1968 the
bombing of the North was
stopped by intense political
pressure at home. In 1970 the
invasion of Cambodia was severely
restricted by the most massive
political action this country has
ever seen.
In the years since U.S.
involvement in Indochina became
overt it has been the American
anti-war movement as well as the
struggles of the Indochinese that
has changed the opinions of the
masses of people of this country
about the war. What we must do
now is make people realize that it
still continues and that Nixon's
"peace plan" (which he was
forced into by the outrage of the
nation) means peace on American
terms for the Indochinese people.
The Vietnamese have called on us
many times to support their
struggle and have thanked us for
that support. Now we must do it
again.
Actions
We must convince Nixon
through our actions that he can
continue the wanton destruction
of North Vietnam only at the risk
of seeing his society crumble. All
anti-war forces must move quickly
and visibly, wherever they are and
in whatever manner, to be sure

that he gets the message. Every
lost day means the deaths of
hundreds of Vietnamese people.
We at Stanford can start by
trying to control our own
community. Many of the
technological processes which
make this bombing possible as
well as much of the ideology
which justifies it or tries to
convince us of our importance in
dealing with it (except through
those very electoral channels
which have elected "peace
candidates" like Johnson and
Nixon) have come out of our
university. One example of many
is the Hansen Microwave
Laboratory's.
According to Saturday's
Chronicle "Military planners now
believe, particularly after two
missions this week, that aircraft
can survive without substantial
losses over North Vietnam
through a combination of
electronic countermeasures
devices, fighter support, and
special tactics."
Professors Chodorow and Shaw
of the Hansen Labs are currently
working on components for a new
electronic countermeasures
device, which has possible
applications for future air wars,
within a few years. (Electronic
countermeasures are used to jam
radar so that planes can bomb
more efficiently and with less
risk, i Stopping this research
project is just one of the many
ways in which we must start once
more to stop the bombing and the
war, starting in our own
community.

North Vietnam. They described
the bobbing as "a calculated risk,
in view of the possibility that
intensive use of the planes might
create a negative reaction here and
abroad."
There have already been large
protest marches in Paris and
Stockholm. Whether there is any
"negative reaction" here is up to
us.
Nixon is attacking population
centers in North Vietnam because
there is nothing else left for him
to do short of pulling out or using
nuclear weapons. The people's
offensive in South Vietnam is
succeeding everywhere, and the
South Vietnamese army is
obviously helpless and
demoralized. (Estimates of ARVN
desertion rates are as high as
12,000 troops per month.)
American air power has not been
a decisive force in the fighting in
South Vietnam and American
ground forces just won't fight
anymore.
Death
So Nixon is trying to wreak as
much death and destruction on
the Vietnamese as possible,
hoping to force them to call of
their offensive as well as showing
any other country that would
dare to challenge U.S. domination

that the U.S. is willing to destroy
any country on earth to save it for
"the free world" (free to U.S.
trade and investment). They
won't call off their offensive, but
they may have to accept what is,
to us, unimaginable civilian
suffering.
The only force we see which
has the possibility of preventing
that death and destruction is a
massive "negative reaction" right
here at home. In 1968 the
bombing of the North was
stopped by intense political
pressure at home. In 1970 the
invasion of Cambodia was severely
restricted by the most massive
political action this country has
ever seen.
In the years since U.S.
involvement in Indochina became
overt it has been the American
anti-war movement as well as the
struggles of the Indochinese that
has changed the opinions of the
masses of people of this country
about the war. What we must do
now is make people realize that it
still continues and that Nixon's
"peace plan" (which he was
forced into by the outrage of the
nation) means peace on American
terms for the Indochinese people.
The Vietnamese have called on us
many times to support their
struggle and have thanked us for
that support. Now we must do it
again.
Actions
We must convince Nixon
through our actions that he can
continue the wanton destruction
of North Vietnam only at the risk
of seeing his society crumble. All
anti-war forces must move quickly
and visibly, wherever they are and
in whatever manner, to be sure

that he gets the message. Every
lost day means the deaths of
hundreds of Vietnamese people.
We at Stanford can start by
trying to control our own
community. Many of the
technological processes which
make this bombing possible as
well as much of the ideology
which justifies it or tries to
convince us of our importance in
dealing with it (except through
those very electoral channels
which have elected "peace
candidates" like Johnson and
Nixon) have come out of our
university. One example of many
is the Hansen Microwave
Laboratory's.
According to Saturday's
Chronicle "Military planners now
believe, particularly after two
missions this week, that aircraft
can survive without substantial
losses over North Vietnam
through a combination of
electronic countermeasures
devices, fighter support, and
special tactics."
Professors Chodorow and Shaw
of the Hansen Labs are currently
working on components for a new
electronic countermeasures
device, which has possible
applications for future air wars,
within a few years. (Electronic
countermeasures are used to jam
radar so that planes can bomb
more efficiently and with less
risk, i Stopping this research
project is just one of the many
ways in which we must start once
more to stop the bombing and the
war, starting in our own
community.

Saturday, U.S. B-52's and
fighter bombers launched massive
bombing raids on Haiphong and
Hanoi. This is the first time since
1968 that these areas have been
bombed and the bombing has
never been this heavy.
It is not as though we weren't
warned. Qn Friday
"administration officials"
announced that B-52's would be
used for heavy raids throughout
North Vietnam. They described
the bobbing as "a calculated risk,
