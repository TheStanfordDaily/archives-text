## Build A Youth Movement 
### 
kenny and porster

The Stanford Young Socialists
are running for President and Vice
President of the ASSU on a
socialist program aimed at
constructing a revolutionary
youth movement and a
revolutionary party to mobilize
the entire working class to take
power.
The only alternative to the
struggle for power of the working
class is a fascist dictatorship which
will physically destroy millions of
working people and poor people
on a scale much greater than
Hitler's ovens.
The fascists are today building
a mass movement in the United
States, in a desperate attempt to
solve the problems of a
crisis-ridden system. Wallace's
victories prove that the capitalists
are consciously whipping up the
middle class into a racist, patriotic
frenzy to throw against the trade
unions, the minorities, and the
poor.
Wallace is the American Hitler.
The campuses today become
centers of middle class fascist
tendencies. These tendencies must
be smashed!
1. Drive Shockley and the
Students for Responsible Action
off campus!
Across the country the doors to
higher education are being closed
to minority and working class
youth. Many minority students
will be forced to leave because of
Lyman's BAP cuts.
2. The Young Socialists
demand an end to cutbacks in
education. We demand free higher
education for all.
The administration represents
the interests of the ruling class.
That is why it backs Shockley to
the hilt and works hand in glove
with Hocker's group, while it
conducts a purge of radicals and
militants. The Young Socialists
defend all militants under attack.
3. The Young Socialists
demand an end to Lyman's

persecution of militants. We
defend the democratic rights of all
working class tendencies.
At the same time we
understand the complete
bankruptcy of the student power,
reformist politics of Venceremos
and the Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement. These people
consciously seek to prop up
illusions that the system can be
pressured to make reforms, that
students isolated from the
working class can take up a fight
against the war, racism, and
repression.
This is a monstrous lie. It is a
life and death matter that
students and youth take up the
fight of the working class against
unemployment, the pay board,
and anti-strike legislation. This
means the fight for a party of the
working class against the twin
capitalist parties—the Democrats
and Republicans.
4. For the construction of a
labor party in '72 based on the
unions pledged to jobs for all
through 30 hours work at 40
hours pay and the nationalization
of basic industry.
The Stalinists of the
Communist Party who are
organizing the April 22 anti-war
protest in San Francisco refuse to
raise these issues. They openly
support capitalist politicians here
and abroad in order to defend this
vicious system.
While the Vietnamese liberation
forces are on the verge of
completely annihilating the U.S.
imperialists and their puppet
forces, the Stalinists call for
reopening of the Paris peace talks,
set the date, and a bourgeois
coalition government without
Thieu.
This is a betrayal of the
Vietnamese revolution.
The Young Socialists are
building an independent
contingent of youth and workers
for April 22 to expose the

counterrevolutionary policies of
the Stalinists and to fight for
Victory to the NLF!
5. March with the Young
Socialists on April 22 against
Stalinism and for:
General Strike to smash Nixon's
pay board and provide jobs for all,
an end to all educational
cutbacks, the nationalization of
basic industry, and an end to
racism.
Every demand in this platform
is a revolutionary demand which
cannot be met under capitalism.
Those who understand the
urgency of these demands must
join the Young Socialists and
build the conscious Marxist
leadership in the youth and trade
unions which can lead the
working class to power and win
these demands.

The Stanford Young Socialists
are running for President and Vice
President of the ASSU on a
socialist program aimed at
constructing a revolutionary
youth movement and a
revolutionary party to mobilize
the entire working class to take
power.
The only alternative to the
struggle for power of the working
class is a fascist dictatorship which
will physically destroy millions of
working people and poor people
on a scale much greater than
Hitler's ovens.
The fascists are today building
a mass movement in the United
States, in a desperate attempt to
solve the problems of a
crisis-ridden system. Wallace's
victories prove that the capitalists
are consciously whipping up the
middle class into a racist, patriotic
frenzy to throw against the trade
unions, the minorities, and the
poor.
Wallace is the American Hitler.
The campuses today become
centers of middle class fascist
tendencies. These tendencies must
be smashed!
1. Drive Shockley and the
Students for Responsible Action
off campus!
Across the country the doors to
higher education are being closed
to minority and working class
youth. Many minority students
will be forced to leave because of
Lyman's BAP cuts.
2. The Young Socialists
demand an end to cutbacks in
education. We demand free higher
education for all.
The administration represents
the interests of the ruling class.
That is why it backs Shockley to
the hilt and works hand in glove
with Hocker's group, while it
conducts a purge of radicals and
militants. The Young Socialists
defend all militants under attack.
3. The Young Socialists
demand an end to Lyman's

persecution of militants. We
defend the democratic rights of all
working class tendencies.
At the same time we
understand the complete
bankruptcy of the student power,
reformist politics of Venceremos
and the Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement. These people
consciously seek to prop up
illusions that the system can be
pressured to make reforms, that
students isolated from the
working class can take up a fight
against the war, racism, and
repression.
This is a monstrous lie. It is a
life and death matter that
students and youth take up the
fight of the working class against
unemployment, the pay board,
and anti-strike legislation. This
means the fight for a party of the
working class against the twin
capitalist parties—the Democrats
and Republicans.
4. For the construction of a
labor party in '72 based on the
unions pledged to jobs for all
through 30 hours work at 40
hours pay and the nationalization
of basic industry.
The Stalinists of the
Communist Party who are
organizing the April 22 anti-war
protest in San Francisco refuse to
raise these issues. They openly
support capitalist politicians here
and abroad in order to defend this
vicious system.
While the Vietnamese liberation
forces are on the verge of
completely annihilating the U.S.
imperialists and their puppet
forces, the Stalinists call for
reopening of the Paris peace talks,
set the date, and a bourgeois
coalition government without
Thieu.
This is a betrayal of the
Vietnamese revolution.
The Young Socialists are
building an independent
contingent of youth and workers
for April 22 to expose the

counterrevolutionary policies of
the Stalinists and to fight for
Victory to the NLF!
5. March with the Young
Socialists on April 22 against
Stalinism and for:
General Strike to smash Nixon's
pay board and provide jobs for all,
an end to all educational
cutbacks, the nationalization of
basic industry, and an end to
racism.
Every demand in this platform
is a revolutionary demand which
cannot be met under capitalism.
Those who understand the
urgency of these demands must
join the Young Socialists and
build the conscious Marxist
leadership in the youth and trade
unions which can lead the
working class to power and win
these demands.
