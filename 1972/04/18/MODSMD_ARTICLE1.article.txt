# War Protesters Trash Campus Buildings
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
A group of 350 demonstrators
marched throughout campus last night
for two hours breaking windows and
calling for students to strike in protest
of U.S. bombing in Vietnam.
The trashing followed a meeting at
8 p.m. in Cubberley called by the
Young Crows, Venceremos, and the
Columbae community. The 400
people at the meeting voted nearly
unanimously to organize a student
strike at a noon rally in White Plaza
today.
Police reported no arrests last night
and one minor injury to Stanford
Security Patrol Captain Donald
Wullschleger who was hit in the back
and leg by rocks. Security Patrol

photographers Nick Brunot and
Luther Long, Director of Public Safety
Marvin Herrington, and Special
Assistant to the President John
Schwartz were each reportedly hit by
rocks without injury. Also, student
Roman Buhler was assaulted without
injury.
Neither police nor university
officials had estimates of damages, but
Daily reporters counted at least 30
broken windows.
Concrete Proposal
During the meeting, Merle Rabine,
chairman of the discussion, told the
crowd, "We all know what we
want—to stop the bombing and
support the seven point program of
the PRC (Provisional Revolutionary

Government). There should be no
discussion not connected to a concrete
proposal. I want to hear short succinct
proposals and arguments."
Before the discussion there were
announcements of several anti-war
activities including a speech
tommorow night by Tom Hayden, a
torchlight rally Thursday from Palo
Alto to the Stanford Electronics
Laboratories, and a march Saturday in
San Francisco.
David Josephson began the actual
discussion of tactics suggesting
"stopping the labs immediately, then
moving to Encina to shut down the
finance and land development
departments." He also suggested
closing down the President's and
Provost's offices.
Single Spark
Venceremos member Don Lee said
the primary obligation of the people
was to the Vietnamese people, and he
said the crowd should be "the single
spark to start the prairie fire."
After Lee there were shouts of
Business School, Faculty Club, Hoover
and Hanson Labs.
Jeffery Youdelman, another
Venceremos member, then said, "the
main thing is the spirit, we should have
the spirit of the enormous incredible
military victories of the Vietnamese
Peoples.
"We should get up and march out
of here, over to the labs, if there are
people in there, or windows, we
should hit them."
Vote To Move
At 9 p.m., following Youdelman's
speech, the meeting voted to "move."
The march itself covered about two
miles and included heavy barrages of
rocks against Hanson Microwave
Laboratory, Hoover Institution,
Durand Building, the Placement
Center, Engineering Laboratories, and
several other buildings. One security
patrol car parked near the bookstore
had its windows broken as the group
moved by.
Although the tenor of the crowd
was clearly in favor of the
rock-throwing, some individuals did
discourage it, and most apparently did
not participate themselves.
Small Groups
Many of the crowd formed
themselves into small "affinity"
groups with such names as Melville,
Geronimo, and Z.
Herrington, Wullschleger, and
Schwartz walked alongside the
protesters during most of the march,
but other uniformed police were
notably absent. At 9:45 p.m. the
crowd moved to the Stern and Wilbur
dorms to announce their strike plans.

WAR PROTESTERS—Students protesting President Nixon's escalation of the bombing of North Vietnam pass the Aero
and Astro Building last night on their way to Hansen Labs. More than 40 windows throughout the campus were broken
during the two hours of disturbances. One Stanford policeman was injured.
The demonstrators reception in
dorms was generally cool with little
actual contact made between those
inside and those outside.
As it moved back toward the
Undergraduate Library about 10 p.m.,
the group encountered Santa Clara
Sheriff's Lieutenant Donald Tamm
and ten tactical squad officers who
attempted to block their return to the
central campus.
Tamm announced that the crowd
was an illegal assembly and argued
with several protesters for several
minutes.
A small group of policemen faced
the crowd and Tamm told
demonstrators, "We don't know if we
can hold you, but we're going to try
for a while."
But many demonstrators moved
around the ends of the police line, and
the police eventually moved aside. By
that time, about 70 Sheriffs deputies
had arrived on campus, and the police
followed the line of protesters around
campus.
After about 10 minutes the crowd,
now numbering about 250 moved to
Roble and Lagunita dorms.
At Lagunita Young Crow Pete
Knutson said, "This is a great
beginning. I can't believe it; it's
outrageous. I think the people of
Vietnam will be glad to hear that we're
behind them, that we're going to shut
down Stanford."
After announcing the plans for a

strike the crowd dispersed about 11
p.m.
Several false fire alarms were
reported last night and a dumpster was
set afire near the post office. A bomb
threat was phoned in to KZSU and the
Stanford switchboard reported a
threat that "one of the labs is going to
go up."
President Lyman was unaware of
the events throughout most of the
evening as he spoke to a group of
General Electric executives in San
Jose, according to his wife Jing. When
he was told about the protest he had
no comment, she said.
At a noon rally yesterday in White
Plaza two popular professors, Paul
Ehrlich and Robert McAfee Brown,
spoke on ways to protest the war.
Both suggested peaceful protest and
attempts to use the political channels.
Brown told the crowd of 800 "an
untried way of opposing the war is to
defeat Nixon." He also said, "As long
as this military escalation goes on
moral protest must also escalate."
Ehrlich suggested that students
support the presidential candidacy of
George McGovern and revitalize the
bid of Pete McCloskey. "I hope you'll
do something, because if you don't do
something, I'm afraid for all of us."
Contacted last night ASSU Council
of Presidents member Diane Fields
said the council may endorse a
"constructive strike," adding that "it
would be the best thing students could
be doing."

Former council member Larry
Diamond said "smashing windows at
Stanford doesn't make sense." He
urged students to support the anti-war
march Saturday in San Francisco, and
indicated he would support a one day
student boycott on Friday.
