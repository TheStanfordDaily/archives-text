# War Protesters Trash Campus Buildings
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
A group of 350 demonstrators
marched throughout campus last night
for two hours breaking windows and
calling for students to strike in protest
of U.S. bombing in Vietnam.
The trashing followed a meeting at
8 p.m. in Cubberley called by the
Young Crows, Venceremos, and the
Columbae community. The 400
people at the meeting voted nearly
unanimously to organize a student
strike at a noon rally in White Plaza
today.
Police reported no arrests last night
and one minor injury to Stanford
Security Patrol Captain Donald
Wullschleger who was hit in the back
and leg by rocks. Security Patrol

photographers Nick Brunot and
Luther Long, Director of Public Safety
Marvin Herrington, and Special
Assistant to the President John
Schwartz were each reportedly hit by
rocks without injury. Also, student
Roman Buhler was assaulted without
injury.
Neither police nor university
officials had estimates of damages, but
Daily reporters counted at least 30
broken windows.
Concrete Proposal
During the meeting, Merle Rabine,
chairman of the discussion, told the
crowd, "We all know what we
want—to stop the bombing and
support the seven point program of
the PRC (Provisional Revolutionary

Government). There should be no
discussion not connected to a concrete
proposal. I want to hear short succinct
proposals and arguments."
Before the discussion there were
announcements of several anti-war
activities including a speech
tommorow night by Tom Hayden, a
torchlight rally Thursday from Palo
Alto to the Stanford Electronics
Laboratories, and a march Saturday in
San Francisco.
David Josephson began the actual
discussion of tactics suggesting
"stopping the labs immediately, then
moving to Encina to shut down the
finance and land development
departments." He also suggested
closing down the President's and
Provost's offices.
Single Spark
Venceremos member Don Lee said
the primary obligation of the people
was to the Vietnamese people, and he
said the crowd should be "the single
spark to start the prairie fire."
After Lee there were shouts of
Business School, Faculty Club, Hoover
and Hanson Labs.
Jeffery Youdelman, another
Venceremos member, then said, "the
main thing is the spirit, we should have
the spirit of the enormous incredible
military victories of the Vietnamese
Peoples.
"We should get up and march out
of here, over to the labs, if there are
people in there, or windows, we
should hit them."
Vote To Move
At 9 p.m., following Youdelman's
speech, the meeting voted to "move."
The march itself covered about two
miles and included heavy barrages of
rocks against Hanson Microwave
Laboratory, Hoover Institution,
Durand Building, the Placement
Center, Engineering Laboratories, and
several other buildings. One security
patrol car parked near the bookstore
had its windows broken as the group
moved by.
Although the tenor of the crowd
was clearly in favor of the
rock-throwing, some individuals did
discourage it, and most apparently did
not participate themselves.
Small Groups
Many of the crowd formed
themselves into small "affinity"
groups with such names as Melville,
Geronimo, and Z.
Herrington, Wullschleger, and
Schwartz walked alongside the
protesters during most of the march,
but other uniformed police were
notably absent. At 9:45 p.m. the
crowd moved to the Stern and Wilbur
dorms to announce their strike plans.
