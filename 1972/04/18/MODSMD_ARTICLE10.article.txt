## Ulster Conflict Has Deep Roots 
### 
We shall get nowhere at all in an attempt to understand the Irish
question if we take the position voiced in most American newspapers,
news magazines, and news broadcasts — that the struggle in Ulster is
best viewed as "senseless violence." The Catholics and Protestants in
Ulster are acting in a purposive fashion. Our objective must be to sort
the situation out and to discover where the right course lies.
I am reminded in reading about Ireland's history of an incident
recounted in John Womack's biography of the Mexican revolutionary
Emiliano Zapata.
Francisco I. Madero, in alliance with Zapata, has in 1911 just
overthrown the Porfirio Diaz regime which had ruled Mexico for 35
years. Madero, soon to be officially elected President of Mexico, is
holding an audience in Mexico City with Zapata, who wishes to have
the lands which have been stolen from the peasants in Zapata's native
Morelos province restored to them.
Going Slow
Madero, with the reins of power now in his hands, counsels going
slow, emphasizes the intricacy of the problem, and is evasive, Zapata,
who is armed even here with a carbine, is passionately committed to
the rightfulness of immediately returning the peasants' land.
Zapata notices the watch chain on Madero's vest and asks Madero
how Madero would feel if right now when Zapata is more heavily
armed than Madero, Zapata were to take his watch. Madero replies
that if he were later to meet Zapata, he would demand back the watch
and demand an indemnity. Zapata then says that it is the same with
the peasants and the theft of their land.
The primary importance of conquest and land theft in the Irish
question was recognized by the American constitutional lawyer
Lysander Spooner in his pamphlet replying to an article written by
Windham Thomas Wyndham-Quin, Fourth Earl of Dunraven, in the
New York Herald in 1880.
Spooner's Answer
Spooner gave this answer to Dunraven: "The whole force of your
letter, as a defense of Irish landlords, rests upon the assumption that
they are the real and true owners of the lands they now hold. But this
assumption is a false one.
'These lands, largely or mostly, were originally taken by the
sword, and have ever since been held by the sword. Neither the
original robbers, nor any subsequent holders, have ever had any other
than a robber's title to them. And robbery gives no better title to
lands than it does to any other property.
"No lapse of time can cure this defect in the original title. Every
successive holder not only endorses all the robberies of all his
predecessors, but he commits a new one himself by withholding the
lands, either from the original and true owners, or from those who,
but for those robberies, would have been their legitimate heirs and
assigns."
In 1919, Congressman Bourke Cockran, an anti-imperialist and
libertarian politician and a famous orator, summarized the pattern in
testimony before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee when
he said:
"The history of Ireland since the first Norman invasion has been an
unbroken record of conquests and seizures of lands — first the
devastation of land, always followed by confiscation."
In the province of Ulster, during the reign of James I, the lands in
six counties were confiscated by the Crown and granted to English
and Scottish Protestants, who agreed to make capital improvements
on the land, preference being given to those persons who had served
the King in a civil or military capacity in Ireland.
Ramsay Colles, in his multi-volume work, The History of Ulster,
gives the following evaluation of massive British colonization of
Ulster:
"This was the great injustice upon which the plantation of Ulster
was founded. The land was taken from the people. . . . This was the
great wrong which for more than one generation, rankled in the hearts
of the Ulster Irish, which made them regard the Scottish and English
settlers as robbers maintained in the possession of their plunder by the
strong hand of an overbearing foreign Government."
Justifications
In the first half of the nineteenth century, the Protestant colonists
implanted in northern Ireland came largely to agree upon a set of

£ bill evers

ideological justifications for their status. Under the intellectual
leadership of Henry Cooke, the Protestants adopted the absolutist
formula of orthodox Calvinism in religion and Tory attitudes in
politics. This formula describes the viewpoint of most Ulster
Protestants to this day.
What is happening in Ireland at the present time is a revival of
popular opposition throughout Ireland, north and south, to the
English rule of native Irishmen (the Catholics) which still continues in
Ulster, and to the theft, centuries ago, of the lands of Irishmen by
conquering soldiers under English command.
A solution which establishes justice in Ireland is necessary. The
Heath government's recent re-establishment of direct imperial rule of
Northern Ireland by England is not satisfactory.
Rectify Thefts
In trying to rectify the theft of Irish lands by the British, there is a
major difficulty that Spooner recognized in 1880, namely, "that the
direct descendants of the original holders of these lands cannot now
be individually traced, and reinstated in the property of their
ancestors."
But this does not necessarily mean that their present owners are
entitled to these lands. Titles based on theft are illegitimate. Such land
should be considered unowned and reopened for homesteading.
A redrawing of the present political boundaries of Northern Ireland
is also necessary, incorporating the western part of Northern Ireland,
which is mostly Catholic, into the Irish Republic. At the same time
full civil liberties and religious freedom should be restored and
guaranteed in both predominately Catholic and predominately
Protestant parts of Ireland.
Police forces should be community-controlled. Catholic
neighborhoods should have Catholic policeman; Protestant
neighborhoods, Protestant policemen. This is particularly important
for the safety of the Catholics, whom some of the more militant
Calvinists consider to be agents of Satan.
Finally, it is important to recognize that while the killing of
innocent civilians by anyone is unjustified, the Provisional wing of the
Irish Republican Army has tried to make its activities serve the just
end of squaring accounts with the English, the Ulster Protestants, and
the now-suspended Stormont government; and I believe that the
balance of the IRA Provisionals' activities are necessary to achieve this
end.

lands, either from the original and true owners, or from those who,
but for those robberies, would have been their legitimate heirs and
assigns."
In 1919, Congressman Bourke Cockran, an anti-imperialist and
libertarian politician and a famous orator, summarized the pattern in
testimony before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee when
he said:
"The history of Ireland since the first Norman invasion has been an
unbroken record of conquests and seizures of lands — first the
devastation of land, always followed by confiscation."
In the province of Ulster, during the reign of James I, the lands in
six counties were confiscated by the Crown and granted to English
and Scottish Protestants, who agreed to make capital improvements
on the land, preference being given to those persons who had served
the King in a civil or military capacity in Ireland.
Ramsay Colles, in his multi-volume work, The History of Ulster,
gives the following evaluation of massive British colonization of
Ulster:
"This was the great injustice upon which the plantation of Ulster
was founded. The land was taken from the people. . . . This was the
great wrong which for more than one generation, rankled in the hearts
of the Ulster Irish, which made them regard the Scottish and English
settlers as robbers maintained in the possession of their plunder by the
strong hand of an overbearing foreign Government."
Justifications
In the first half of the nineteenth century, the Protestant colonists
implanted in northern Ireland came largely to agree upon a set of

£ bill evers

ideological justifications for their status. Under the intellectual
leadership of Henry Cooke, the Protestants adopted the absolutist
formula of orthodox Calvinism in religion and Tory attitudes in
politics. This formula describes the viewpoint of most Ulster
Protestants to this day.
What is happening in Ireland at the present time is a revival of
popular opposition throughout Ireland, north and south, to the
English rule of native Irishmen (the Catholics) which still continues in
Ulster, and to the theft, centuries ago, of the lands of Irishmen by
conquering soldiers under English command.
A solution which establishes justice in Ireland is necessary. The
Heath government's recent re-establishment of direct imperial rule of
Northern Ireland by England is not satisfactory.
Rectify Thefts
In trying to rectify the theft of Irish lands by the British, there is a
major difficulty that Spooner recognized in 1880, namely, "that the
direct descendants of the original holders of these lands cannot now
be individually traced, and reinstated in the property of their
ancestors."
But this does not necessarily mean that their present owners are
entitled to these lands. Titles based on theft are illegitimate. Such land
should be considered unowned and reopened for homesteading.
A redrawing of the present political boundaries of Northern Ireland
is also necessary, incorporating the western part of Northern Ireland,
which is mostly Catholic, into the Irish Republic. At the same time
full civil liberties and religious freedom should be restored and
guaranteed in both predominately Catholic and predominately
Protestant parts of Ireland.
Police forces should be community-controlled. Catholic
neighborhoods should have Catholic policeman; Protestant
neighborhoods, Protestant policemen. This is particularly important
for the safety of the Catholics, whom some of the more militant
Calvinists consider to be agents of Satan.
Finally, it is important to recognize that while the killing of
innocent civilians by anyone is unjustified, the Provisional wing of the
Irish Republican Army has tried to make its activities serve the just
end of squaring accounts with the English, the Ulster Protestants, and
the now-suspended Stormont government; and I believe that the
balance of the IRA Provisionals' activities are necessary to achieve this
end.

We shall get nowhere at all in an attempt to understand the Irish
question if we take the position voiced in most American newspapers,
news magazines, and news broadcasts — that the struggle in Ulster is
best viewed as "senseless violence." The Catholics and Protestants in
Ulster are acting in a purposive fashion. Our objective must be to sort
the situation out and to discover where the right course lies.
I am reminded in reading about Ireland's history of an incident
recounted in John Womack's biography of the Mexican revolutionary
Emiliano Zapata.
Francisco I. Madero, in alliance with Zapata, has in 1911 just
overthrown the Porfirio Diaz regime which had ruled Mexico for 35
years. Madero, soon to be officially elected President of Mexico, is
holding an audience in Mexico City with Zapata, who wishes to have
the lands which have been stolen from the peasants in Zapata's native
Morelos province restored to them.
Going Slow
Madero, with the reins of power now in his hands, counsels going
slow, emphasizes the intricacy of the problem, and is evasive, Zapata,
who is armed even here with a carbine, is passionately committed to
the rightfulness of immediately returning the peasants' land.
Zapata notices the watch chain on Madero's vest and asks Madero
how Madero would feel if right now when Zapata is more heavily
armed than Madero, Zapata were to take his watch. Madero replies
that if he were later to meet Zapata, he would demand back the watch
and demand an indemnity. Zapata then says that it is the same with
the peasants and the theft of their land.
The primary importance of conquest and land theft in the Irish
question was recognized by the American constitutional lawyer
Lysander Spooner in his pamphlet replying to an article written by
Windham Thomas Wyndham-Quin, Fourth Earl of Dunraven, in the
New York Herald in 1880.
Spooner's Answer
Spooner gave this answer to Dunraven: "The whole force of your
letter, as a defense of Irish landlords, rests upon the assumption that
they are the real and true owners of the lands they now hold. But this
assumption is a false one.
'These lands, largely or mostly, were originally taken by the
sword, and have ever since been held by the sword. Neither the
original robbers, nor any subsequent holders, have ever had any other
than a robber's title to them. And robbery gives no better title to
lands than it does to any other property.
"No lapse of time can cure this defect in the original title. Every
successive holder not only endorses all the robberies of all his
predecessors, but he commits a new one himself by withholding the
lands, either from the original and true owners, or from those who,
but for those robberies, would have been their legitimate heirs and

should be considered unowned and reopened for homesteading.
A redrawing of the present political boundaries of Northern Ireland
is also necessary, incorporating the western part of Northern Ireland,
which is mostly Catholic, into the Irish Republic. At the same time
full civil liberties and religious freedom should be restored and
guaranteed in both predominately Catholic and predominately
Protestant parts of Ireland.
Police forces should be community-controlled. Catholic
neighborhoods should have Catholic policeman; Protestant
neighborhoods, Protestant policemen. This is particularly important
for the safety of the Catholics, whom some of the more militant
Calvinists consider to be agents of Satan.
Finally, it is important to recognize that while the killing of
innocent civilians by anyone is unjustified, the Provisional wing of the
Irish Republican Army has tried to make its activities serve the just
end of squaring accounts with the English, the Ulster Protestants, and
the now-suspended Stormont government; and I believe that the
balance of the IRA Provisionals' activities are necessary to achieve this
end.

We shall get nowhere at all in an attempt to understand the Irish
question if we take the position voiced in most American newspapers,
news magazines, and news broadcasts — that the struggle in Ulster is
best viewed as "senseless violence." The Catholics and Protestants in
Ulster are acting in a purposive fashion. Our objective must be to sort
the situation out and to discover where the right course lies.
I am reminded in reading about Ireland's history of an incident
recounted in John Womack's biography of the Mexican revolutionary
Emiliano Zapata.
Francisco I. Madero, in alliance with Zapata, has in 1911 just
overthrown the Porfirio Diaz regime which had ruled Mexico for 35
years. Madero, soon to be officially elected President of Mexico, is
holding an audience in Mexico City with Zapata, who wishes to have
the lands which have been stolen from the peasants in Zapata's native
Morelos province restored to them.
Going Slow
Madero, with the reins of power now in his hands, counsels going
slow, emphasizes the intricacy of the problem, and is evasive, Zapata,
who is armed even here with a carbine, is passionately committed to
the rightfulness of immediately returning the peasants' land.
Zapata notices the watch chain on Madero's vest and asks Madero
how Madero would feel if right now when Zapata is more heavily
armed than Madero, Zapata were to take his watch. Madero replies
that if he were later to meet Zapata, he would demand back the watch
and demand an indemnity. Zapata then says that it is the same with
the peasants and the theft of their land.
The primary importance of conquest and land theft in the Irish
question was recognized by the American constitutional lawyer
Lysander Spooner in his pamphlet replying to an article written by
Windham Thomas Wyndham-Quin, Fourth Earl of Dunraven, in the
New York Herald in 1880.
Spooner's Answer
Spooner gave this answer to Dunraven: "The whole force of your
letter, as a defense of Irish landlords, rests upon the assumption that
they are the real and true owners of the lands they now hold. But this
assumption is a false one.
'These lands, largely or mostly, were originally taken by the
sword, and have ever since been held by the sword. Neither the
original robbers, nor any subsequent holders, have ever had any other
than a robber's title to them. And robbery gives no better title to
lands than it does to any other property.
"No lapse of time can cure this defect in the original title. Every
successive holder not only endorses all the robberies of all his
predecessors, but he commits a new one himself by withholding the
lands, either from the original and true owners, or from those who,
but for those robberies, would have been their legitimate heirs and
assigns."
In 1919, Congressman Bourke Cockran, an anti-imperialist and
libertarian politician and a famous orator, summarized the pattern in
testimony before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee when
he said:
"The history of Ireland since the first Norman invasion has been an
unbroken record of conquests and seizures of lands — first the
devastation of land, always followed by confiscation."
In the province of Ulster, during the reign of James I, the lands in
six counties were confiscated by the Crown and granted to English
and Scottish Protestants, who agreed to make capital improvements
on the land, preference being given to those persons who had served
the King in a civil or military capacity in Ireland.
Ramsay Colles, in his multi-volume work, The History of Ulster,
gives the following evaluation of massive British colonization of
Ulster:
"This was the great injustice upon which the plantation of Ulster
was founded. The land was taken from the people. . . . This was the
great wrong which for more than one generation, rankled in the hearts
of the Ulster Irish, which made them regard the Scottish and English
settlers as robbers maintained in the possession of their plunder by the
strong hand of an overbearing foreign Government."
Justifications
In the first half of the nineteenth century, the Protestant colonists
implanted in northern Ireland came largely to agree upon a set of

£ bill evers

ideological justifications for their status. Under the intellectual
leadership of Henry Cooke, the Protestants adopted the absolutist
formula of orthodox Calvinism in religion and Tory attitudes in
politics. This formula describes the viewpoint of most Ulster
Protestants to this day.
What is happening in Ireland at the present time is a revival of
popular opposition throughout Ireland, north and south, to the
English rule of native Irishmen (the Catholics) which still continues in
Ulster, and to the theft, centuries ago, of the lands of Irishmen by
conquering soldiers under English command.
A solution which establishes justice in Ireland is necessary. The
Heath government's recent re-establishment of direct imperial rule of
Northern Ireland by England is not satisfactory.
Rectify Thefts
In trying to rectify the theft of Irish lands by the British, there is a
major difficulty that Spooner recognized in 1880, namely, "that the
direct descendants of the original holders of these lands cannot now
be individually traced, and reinstated in the property of their
ancestors."
But this does not necessarily mean that their present owners are
entitled to these lands. Titles based on theft are illegitimate. Such land
should be considered unowned and reopened for homesteading.
A redrawing of the present political boundaries of Northern Ireland
is also necessary, incorporating the western part of Northern Ireland,
which is mostly Catholic, into the Irish Republic. At the same time
full civil liberties and religious freedom should be restored and
