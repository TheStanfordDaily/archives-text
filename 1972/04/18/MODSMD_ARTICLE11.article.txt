Sex Equality
Editor, THE DAILY:
Readers of the Daily may
advance sex-race equality in
education and employment at
Stanford University by attending
court hearing on Petition-Motion
to vacate judgment entered in
February dismissing our class
action filed April 7, 1971 for the
aforesaid goal. The
Petition-Motion, subscribed by
154 persons, is set for hearing in
San Jose on Friday, April 21, at 2
p.m. in Superior Courts building,
191 North First Street, second
floor, John Smith Mclnerny,
Judge.
In his decision last November
on which he entered judgment in
February, Judge Mclnerny
omitted consideration of our legal
claims and authorities in relation
to relief we sought in the
Complaint filed April 7, 1971,
and expressed his range
psychologically by the following,
quoted from his decision:
"This remains the Court's
feelings. . . .
Homo Sapiens comes in two
basic varieties — male and
female. What has been given to
the male species has sometimes
been denied the female, and
vice-versa. . .. (S)ince the male
basically did the governing,
.. . (s)ociety accepted that he

should be given preference in
being educated, and also in
doing the educating at the
higher levels. . .. The Court
finds the answers to such
questions beyond its limited
skills. . . . For all of the
foregoing reasons, the general
demurrer filed by the Stanford
defendants is sustained without
leave to amend. It is so
ordered.
Dated: November 23, 1971."
You will recall the heritage
Jane Lathrop Stanford and Lei and
Stanford left to us November 11,
1885, in the Grant Founding and
Endowing the Leland Stanford
Junior University includes proviso
at IV, 16:
"(T)he Trustees shall have the
power and it shall be their
Duty: ... to afford equal
facilities and given equal
advantages in the University to
both the sexes."
In salient breach of trust, a few
men wishing to shield personal
disabilities in heterosexual
development cogently related to
absence of women professors
from their experience in college
and/or law school, in 1933
resolved and still refuse to
reconsider — to even receive — a
petition with approximately 2000
signatures therefor!, policy for
distributing admissions and
financial aid to women at less

than their proportion of the most
qualified applicants.
Women comprise half of the
most qualified applicants to the
freshman class at Stanford
University but, over preponderant
will of the Stanford community
and public and otherwise these
few men limit women to
approximately 1/3 of the
freshman class and l/7th of
Stanford Law School first year
class.
Stanford Daily and Law School
Journal articles, most recently the
latter on February 3 and 17,
1972, and other materials on the
court action are available to the
Stanford Community
conveniently in the case file at
Meyer Library, second floor,
Stanford Information Shelf.

Who is it who thought up the

forward and take a bow. Thanks

February, Judge Mclnerny
omitted consideration of our legal
claims and authorities in relation
to relief we sought in the
Complaint filed April 7, 1971,
and expressed his range
psychologically by the following,
quoted from his decision:
"This remains the Court's
feelings. . . .
Homo Sapiens comes in two
basic varieties — male and
female. What has been given to
the male species has sometimes
been denied the female, and
vice-versa. . .. (S)ince the male
basically did the governing,
.. . (s)ociety accepted that he

should be given preference in
being educated, and also in
doing the educating at the
higher levels. . .. The Court
finds the answers to such
questions beyond its limited
skills. . . . For all of the
foregoing reasons, the general
demurrer filed by the Stanford
defendants is sustained without
leave to amend. It is so
ordered.
Dated: November 23, 1971."
You will recall the heritage
Jane Lathrop Stanford and Lei and
Stanford left to us November 11,
1885, in the Grant Founding and
Endowing the Leland Stanford
Junior University includes proviso
at IV, 16:
"(T)he Trustees shall have the
power and it shall be their
Duty: ... to afford equal
facilities and given equal
advantages in the University to
both the sexes."
In salient breach of trust, a few
men wishing to shield personal
disabilities in heterosexual
development cogently related to
absence of women professors
from their experience in college
and/or law school, in 1933
resolved and still refuse to
reconsider — to even receive — a
petition with approximately 2000
signatures therefor!, policy for
distributing admissions and
financial aid to women at less

than their proportion of the most
qualified applicants.
Women comprise half of the
most qualified applicants to the
freshman class at Stanford
University but, over preponderant
will of the Stanford community
and public and otherwise these
few men limit women to
approximately 1/3 of the
freshman class and l/7th of
Stanford Law School first year
class.

Journal articles, most recently the
latter on February 3 and 17,
1972, and other materials on the
court action are available to the
Stanford Community
conveniently in the case file at
Meyer Library, second floor,
Stanford Information Shelf.

Who is it who thought up the
many bicycle ramps leading on
and off sidewalks and similar
obstructions, that have sprung up
all over the campus recently? Step
forward and take a bow. Thanks
for a really constructive idea!
