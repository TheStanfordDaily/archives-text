## The 						Tyranny Of Ideas 
### 
Barry wood

There is a tyranny afoot in the
world, more dangerous than
anything in ancient times, more
dangerous for human freedom
than anything Machiavelli ever
dreamed of. It is the tyranny of
thoughts and ideas, and it enslaves
men to symbols, abstractions and
ideologies.
The tyranny of ideas resides in
a fundamental confusion between
ideas and the reality they
represent. If you care to look into
it you 11 find that more human
energy is wasted, more talent
dissipated, more money washed
down the drain, more people
murdered, burned and bombed
for ideas than any other reason.
Other people are never valued or

evaluated for what they are, but
according to what we think.
When we teach our children to
defecate by the clock rather than
according to a movement in the
bowels, the tyranny of concepts
begins. Have you ever wondered
why most children draw a
Christmas tree the same way —
the old familiar cut-cut with
branches slanting down — when
very few trees look that way? A
concept has usurped reality. When
thousands of people live in
identical boxes in suburbia, it is
certain that they have been
channeled by the ideas of others
rather than their own inner
impulses.
The tyranny of ideas
eventually leads men to devalue
the real world. Plato started this
by saying that the Real World was
the World of Ideas, and nature
was just a clumsy copy. It is but a
small step to the bulldozer
mentality, whcih seeks to shape
up the copy into something less
clumsy and more ideal. Plato had
a lot of boosting from religion.
Words
God was He who made the
world by words ("Let there be
light!"), and we have never got
beyond the belief that God's
words, plans and ideas are more
important than what we see in the
real world. So blind are some that
they think evil is an illusion
because it was not God's idea!
I've been reading a book by a
Hungarian refugee called
The Rules of Chaos. It starts out
by saying: "What happens in the
next moment is never as certain as
it appears before or after."
Existence is not a neat thing but a
very messy business. The universe
is full of loose ends and runny
edges.
Only in the abstract world of
ideas is everything in order. This is
why everything seems certain —
until it fails to happen — and why
yesterday's surprise looks
inevitable today.
Nonsense
There has always been a lot of

sheer nonsense done for ideas.
Some people think that sin, evil
and corruption was not in the
original plan, and so they go
about trying to obliterate all such
ugly black things. I suppose they
wantauniversethat is all highlights
and no shadows, and doubtless
they will be content with the
completely whitewashed reality
that results.
Most revolutions are staged in
the belief that the world will go
the way that theory predicts. It
doesn't, and most revolutions fail,
and even the apparent successes
have to be qualified. We live in a
universe that generally just
bumbles along. Even the stars are
either collapsing or blowing up.
But our ideas, ideologies and
theories are based on the
assumption that reality works one
way, and that it is always clear.
There is only one sure answer
for anyone who thinks reality
works one way: if there were only
one way for things to be done
then obviously everything would
be done that way. The fact is,
however, that the Absolutely
Final Theory About How
Everything Works is going to have
to include either a random loop or
a surprise button, just as the
original heaven included a
skulking traitor with the
improbable name of Lucifer
("The Light Bearer").
Freaks
For the universe keeps
throwing out psychic freaks and
cripples, mongolians, geniuses,
six-toed cats and nectarines. No

theory includes these things
because all philosophers lack the
guts to incorporate what everyone
fears and hates: uncertainty. So
they play it pink, and the funds
keep coming in.
To be free in a universe where
ideas don't always fit means
simply to be free of ideas. When
ideologies lead men astray, then
freedom means jettisoning the
ideologies. When symbols blind us
to facts, then freedom means
burning the symbols. When an
institution starts to freeze and
ossify life, it is time to leave the
institution.
All of this means dethroning
the gods in our heads — the
abstractions, systems, beliefs,
expectations, and conceptual
nonsense out of which come war,
racism, inequality, exploitation,
imperialism, and ecocatastrophe.
The universe changes, rushes
ahead, like a river at full flood.
Those who desperately cling to a
few certainties find themselves
trying to stand on a rock in

midstream.
The water makes them dizzy,
and they fall off. This is why
those people who manage to stand
fast on their Rock of Ages are
those who have closed their eyes
to the the flood. Those who are
blind can stand up in midstream.
Ideas lead to a kind of
blindness. The man who is certain
has already begun to die. Even
with eyes wide open, his brain
screens out contradictory
evidence. But those who are
willing to grow are willing to let
all their ideas go. They can throw
out all the divinities, because they
know that even without all their
ideas the same world will still be
staring them in the face.
Moreover, those whose eyes are
backed up with a full head are
rarely able to really see, but
looking at the world without
having any ideas about it is to find
that the same world begins to
look very different.
