In a wild game at Monterey last
Saturday the Stanford lacrosse
team scored six times in the
fourth period to defeat the Naval
Post Graduate School 12-11.
Going into the fourth quarter
the Cards trailed 8-6, following a
third quarter let-down where
Navy tallied five goals. Stanford
then began an offensive assault
that led the way for four quick
goals followed later by two more,
enabling the Cards to lead 12-6
with 8:20 gone in the period.
Navy then scored once to close
the gap 12-9, and with less than a
minute remaining scored two
more quick goals, but time ran
out with them not being able to
score again.
The Stanford victory was led
by Attackmen Chip Loveman and
Ted Suen who combined for seven
goals and three assists.
Coach Bill Eakland considers
this the Cards finest performance
of the season and hopes it will
provide momentum for the team
in the crucial battle against the
Palo Alto Lacrosse Club this

Saturday.
Currently Stanford and Palo
Alto are tied for first place in the
Northern California Lacrosse
Association and Saturday's match
will determine the leader in the
Southern Division standings.
This is a must game for both
teams as each is looking towards a
number one seed in the league
play-offs in June. Palo Alto has

enjoyed large margins of victory
over opponents as they lead the
league in scoring and defense.
Stanford, on the other hand,
has assembled an 8-1 record by
having won five of its eight
victories by only one goal — and
four of these games were decided
in overtime play. Stanford's lone
loss was to Air Force while Palo
Alto is undefeated.

weekend by UCLA.
