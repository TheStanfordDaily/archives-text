# From Reserve To Starter
## Williams Leads The Card Hitters 
### MIKE HERMAN 
If the varsity baseball team wins the Southern Division crown, the
Pacific Eijht title, and finally, the National championship, as many
observers feel they will, much of the credit must go to the Cardinals'
centerfielder, Tom Williams, the leading hitter on a team of hitters.
Perhaps his story typifies the success story that has involved the entire
team this year.
Last year, Tom Williams played in only 40 of the team's 60 games,
batting a relatively poor .229. Known mostly as a streak hitter who
was platooned in the Stanford outfield, he was rarely used in
situations other than those exclusively for lefthanders. As
demonstrated in his average of 2.4 at bats per game, he was often used
as a pinchhitter, an occupation in which he responded with several
key hits, and as a defensive replacement because of his fine throwing
arm. Yet, he never really came alive offensively and spent most of a
frustrating season on the bench.
This year, however, all has been different. Following the UCLA
series of this weekend, Williams was batting a resounding .440, nearly
twice his average of last year. He leads the team in games hit safely
(28 of 39), in hits (55), in total bases (71), and in runs scored (26). In
addition, he is second in the club in doubles (5), triples (3) and
home runs (3).
The key to such a tremendous transformation has been more
mental than physical. "I'm the same player physically," Tom says."I
am a little stronger, have a little more power. I think confidence is
perhaps the most important thing, but also, until the SC series, I had
strictly gone for singles, exclusively. I'd hit a few home runs, but I
always went for singles."
The enormity of his improvement may also come from an obvious
shift in his own philosophy from himself to his team. "One of the
things that really helped me was that, last year, I was a kind of
borderline starter. It's really hard — if you think just about playing —
to be a borderline player, because you're always fearing that if you
have a bad day, you're not going to be in the lineup again. I felt that
this year the team was the most important thing and whatever I could
do to contribute was all I could hope for."
"It's a funny thing," he continued. "If you just don't worry about
playing and you're in there — every minute that you're in there — just
to help out the team, it's alot easier to play good baseball."
When one considers the time-consuming value that baseball is, it is
amazing that anyone could find time to do anything else but practice
and study. Yet Williams is involved in a great deal of activities, though
he modestly plays down this diversification. Besides playing baseball,
he is also a straight "A" student, majoring in electrical engineering, a
serious candidate for medical school, a member of the ROTC, and
president of his house, Sigma Chi. Each of these takes up a prominent
role in his life.
Between his obligation to ROTC and his medical aspirations, Tom
will most likely be committed to his present activities for the next 15
to 20 years. If everything works out right, he will serve four years in
the Navy, a possible five years in the navy medical program, four
additional service following the program and a three years span of
internship and residency.
For the moment, however, Williams' list of priorities has baseball
first and his house responsibility second. "A human being can do a
phenomenal amount if he really has the discipline to do it," Tom said.
There are few students at Stanford who are more qualified to make
such a statement and fewer examples of its truth.
The chance of playing for a national champion, let alone starring
on one, is, at present the controlling interest in his life. "From the
beginning of the year I strongly believed not only that we'd win the
Pac-Eight but that we'd win in Omaha (the site of the NCAA
championships). I see this year as my opportunity to be on a
championship team. I really think we have a chance and that is
something I'll be able to look back on for the test of my life."

Williams emphasized repeatedly that the finest part about this
team, compared to others he has played on, is that it is a real team
effort, with someone different coming through all the time. "There is
so much depth and everyone on the team is so good that there is
really no one that is really that important. Last year, Rod (Boone)
was the star; he carried the ball club. But this year, he's not having
that great a year. I'm having a good year, but I'm not doing that much
better than anyone else either. Everyone's the same on this team and I
think that's one of the reasons we're doing so well. The pressure is not
on any one player."
He went on to illustrate this phenomenum by referring to the USC
showdown of two weeks ago. "One of the biggest moments in the
series, as far as I was concerned, was when one of my closest friends,
Timmy Wilson, who has not been playing very much at all, came in
and got two critical pinchhits."
It says alot about Tom Williams that his favorite momemts relate
to his friends and to other people besides himself. His modest nature
further defines his involvement with life and, more specifically for
him, with his team. Sometimes early in June of this year, his dream
may well be realized. For now, however, there's USC, UCLA and
California. Beyond that, well, ". . . The No. 1 ranking isn't all that
significant to the players. I think we all just want to go back to
Omaha."
