# Demonstrations Erupt Before Bombing Halt

Violence erupted at several spots
across the nation yesterday as
opposition mounted to new American
bombing of North Vietnam.
Most of yesterday's protest had
ended when President Nixon,
according to U.S. military sources last
night, suspended the bombing over
Hanoi and Haiphong, and it was
unclear how the suspension would
affect protests scheduled for the rest
of the week.
Sixteen members of the Vietnam
Veterans Against the War were
arrested after they occupied an Air
Force recruiting office in San
Francisco while over 2000
demonstrators milled about outside.
Those outside slashed the tires of
official cars and set fire to a Navy car.
A KPFA radio newscaster was
clubbed by police and then arrested as
officials pocketed her press
credentials.
The 16 demonstrators were charged
with disorderly conduct.
Another 41 protestors were arrested
when they tried to block traffic at the
Alameda Naval Air Station. They were
part of a larger group of about 75 that
included folksinger Joan Baez, who led
the crowd in singing "We Shall
Overcome."
The National Student Association
(NSA) last night called for a strike on
Friday, and included a list of 21
colleges currently considering a strike.
The NSA also announced that
Amherst College has decided to go on
strike today, and that in Rochester,
New York, Colgate and Grinnell
Colleges have started hunger strikes.

The NSA is asking colleges to hold
referendums on Friday on whether
students want the strike prolonged
past Friday. The groups have set up a
National Strike Coordinating and
Communications Center in
Washington, D.C.
The Harvard Crimson ran an
editorial this morning asking for a
national student strike and 15 other
campus newspapers—including the
Stanford Daily—urged similar action.
Every Ivy League school, along with
a group of five other college papers
which supported the Crimson
editorial, demanding that the
presidents of their colleges call off
class on Friday as part of a
moratorium to determine the direction
of the protests.
1000 At Columbia
At Columbia University in New
York, 1000 students marched to the
home of the University president and
demanded that he close the school
down. He indicated that he would take
the matter to the University Senate on
Friday, but strike groups were already
forming on campus to take some
action tomorrow.
The only damage on the Columbia
campus was to a New York Daily
News car.
At the University of Wisconsin in
Madison, a crowd of 3500 set out to
occupy the state capitol building, only
two miles from the Wisconsin campus,
but dissolved when the protestors ran
into 50 riot-ready police.
Earlier the group marched a mile
from the center of campus to the
ROTC building and threw balloons full
of red paint at the structure.
