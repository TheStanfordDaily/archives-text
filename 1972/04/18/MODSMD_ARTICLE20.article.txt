# 'Robin': Multi-Media Extravaganza

What is 1134 years old, 311'8"
lall, 7859 lbs., and has lots of
hair? Answer: the cast of the
multi-media musical celebration
ROBIN. The cast might be
familiar to some Stanford people;
t,he play ran in Palo Alto for
several weeks last summer, but the
new home for ROBIN is the
Friends and Relations Theatre on
'the Great Highway, a building
Which used to be a rock palace,
the Family Dog.
y The theatre itself presents an
attractive wrapping for an
attractive play. Located at the end
of Playland toward the ocean side
of Golden Gate Park, the theatre
sports a carefully designed and
teolorfully painted exterior. Inside
flies a thrust stage, creating an
acting area about three fourths in
the round. About four hundred
people can fit into the theatre,
but Saturday's crowd was
;nowhere near that size and was
well balanced by the enormous
cast.
),-> The play concerns the
development and life of an
All-American boy, Robin, the son
of Joe and Mary Iveland. Joe is
a butcher who gets drafted and
killed in the second world war,
and the action follows how Robin

is raised from swaddling clothes in
the 1930's to fringed vests in the
1970'5. While the action is a
biographical odyssey much like
other current rock musicals
including Jesus Christ Superstar
and Tommy, much of the action
relates not directly to Robin, but
rather the changes in the world
around him as he grows.
And what action! The biggest
problem for the audience is trying
to catch all the things going on.
The cast includes over twenty-five
actors, most of whom are on stage
at any given moment, or in the
audience, or standing to one side
of the stage, or even sitting down
next to you. Despite the size of
the theatre, the actors who used
acting areas distant from the main
stage kept in tune with the central
action despite its fast pace, thus
creating an intense milieu
everywhere the audience turned.
The technical ensemble
contributed immensely to the
total environment. Screen ring the
entire oval shaped theatre and
throughout the play are
constantly embellished with
projected slides and films relating
to the action. The light cue sheet
must have read like the New York.
City phonebook, and it was a
small miracle that the technical

crew managed to keep a dozen or
so projectors and the battery of
other stage lights under such
tightly coordinated control.
Further adding to the depth of
the production was a pit orchestra
of six musicians reinforced by a
large arsenal of recorded music.
Despite the large distance between
the orchestra and the rest of the
cast, the two managed to stay
together nicely on all musical
numbers which ranged in tempo
from the slow swing beat of the
thirties to the amplified rock of
the sixties. While the music was
not terribly memorable, a few
numbers such as "Born to Roam,"
and the finale "Let This Day,"
were unusually nice.
The actors, crew, and
musicians blended their talents in
an occasionally unpolished but
always enthusiastic mixture of
music, drama, comedy, and visual
sensation. ROBIN was one part
music, one part drama, one part
dance, and one part technical
genius, all cemented together with
a barrel of love and enthusiasm.
The performance of any
individual cast member is difficult
to discuss. First the members of
the cast were all equally talented,
and second the cast works as an
ensemble with actors rotating the

roles with each performance. The
play is constructed so each actor
plays many roles anyway during
the course of the play, giving a
picture pf tremendous
adaptability and versatility for
every one of the performers.
Outstanding at Saturday
night's performance were Robin
at the age of six years, Robin at
the age of fourteen years, and
Robin's Rocking Horse, Silver,
played by a mime. The
performance of Robin at six years
was particularly captivating, the
very young actor stole the scene,
if such a thing were possible in
such a broadly based production.
As the play progressed, cast
members moved through a variety
of roles, adding new costumes as
they went; never removing old
ones. The finale includes a
beautifully done scene akin to the
peeling of an onion where the
actors shed their layers of
costumes giving the audience a

visual re-cap of the entire play.
The play is complex enough to
warrant such a review, and it is
equisitely done.
Like any multi-media
production, ROBIN occasionally
slips into a slight technical overkill
where the play is obscured by
many of the things going on on
the stage and walls of the theatre.
Nonetheless, the cast manages to
construct what is an often
confusing but generally
challenging and enjoyable evening
of theatre.
ROBIN continues at the
Friends and Relations Theatre at
660 the Great Highway,
Wednesday through Sunday nights
at 8:30 with two shows on
Saturday night at 7:30 and 10:30.
Tickets are $3.50 and $4.50

song this Saturday at 8:30. They will repeat their performance the
next night at 8 at Flint Center.

if such a thing were possible in
such a broadly based production.
As the play progressed, cast
members moved through a variety
of roles, adding new costumes as
they went; never removing old
ones. The finale includes a
beautifully done scene akin to the
peeling of an onion where the
actors shed their layers of
costumes giving the audience a

visual re-cap of the entire play.
The play is complex enough to
warrant such a review, and it is
equisitely done.
Like any multi-media
production, ROBIN occasionally
slips into a slight technical overkill
where the play is obscured by
many of the things going on on
the stage and walls of the theatre.
Nonetheless, the cast manages to
construct what is an often
confusing but generally
challenging and enjoyable evening
of theatre.
ROBIN continues at the
Friends and Relations Theatre at
660 the Great Highway,
Wednesday through Sunday nights
at 8:30 with two shows on
Saturday night at 7:30 and 10:30.
Tickets are $3.50 and $4.50
Wednesday, Thursday, and
Sunday; and $4.50 and $5.50
Friday and Saturday. Student
rush tickets may be available at

What is 1134 years old, 311'8"
lall, 7859 lbs., and has lots of
hair? Answer: the cast of the
multi-media musical celebration
ROBIN. The cast might be
familiar to some Stanford people;
t,he play ran in Palo Alto for
several weeks last summer, but the
new home for ROBIN is the
Friends and Relations Theatre on
'the Great Highway, a building
Which used to be a rock palace,
the Family Dog.
y The theatre itself presents an
attractive wrapping for an
attractive play. Located at the end
of Playland toward the ocean side
of Golden Gate Park, the theatre
sports a carefully designed and
teolorfully painted exterior. Inside
flies a thrust stage, creating an
acting area about three fourths in
the round. About four hundred
people can fit into the theatre,
but Saturday's crowd was
;nowhere near that size and was
well balanced by the enormous
cast.
),-> The play concerns the
development and life of an
All-American boy, Robin, the son
of Joe and Mary Iveland. Joe is
a butcher who gets drafted and
killed in the second world war,
and the action follows how Robin

is raised from swaddling clothes in
the 1930's to fringed vests in the
1970'5. While the action is a
biographical odyssey much like
other current rock musicals
including Jesus Christ Superstar
and Tommy, much of the action
relates not directly to Robin, but
rather the changes in the world
around him as he grows.
And what action! The biggest
problem for the audience is trying
to catch all the things going on.
The cast includes over twenty-five
actors, most of whom are on stage
at any given moment, or in the
audience, or standing to one side
of the stage, or even sitting down
next to you. Despite the size of
the theatre, the actors who used
acting areas distant from the main
stage kept in tune with the central
action despite its fast pace, thus
creating an intense milieu
everywhere the audience turned.
The technical ensemble
contributed immensely to the
total environment. Screen ring the
entire oval shaped theatre and
throughout the play are
constantly embellished with
projected slides and films relating
to the action. The light cue sheet
must have read like the New York.
City phonebook, and it was a
small miracle that the technical

crew managed to keep a dozen or
so projectors and the battery of
other stage lights under such
tightly coordinated control.
Further adding to the depth of
the production was a pit orchestra
of six musicians reinforced by a
large arsenal of recorded music.
Despite the large distance between
the orchestra and the rest of the
cast, the two managed to stay
together nicely on all musical
numbers which ranged in tempo
from the slow swing beat of the
thirties to the amplified rock of
the sixties. While the music was
not terribly memorable, a few
numbers such as "Born to Roam,"
and the finale "Let This Day,"
were unusually nice.
The actors, crew, and
musicians blended their talents in
an occasionally unpolished but
always enthusiastic mixture of
music, drama, comedy, and visual
sensation. ROBIN was one part
music, one part drama, one part
dance, and one part technical
genius, all cemented together with
a barrel of love and enthusiasm.
The performance of any
individual cast member is difficult
to discuss. First the members of
the cast were all equally talented,
and second the cast works as an
ensemble with actors rotating the

roles with each performance. The
play is constructed so each actor
plays many roles anyway during
the course of the play, giving a
picture pf tremendous
adaptability and versatility for
every one of the performers.
Outstanding at Saturday
night's performance were Robin
at the age of six years, Robin at
the age of fourteen years, and
Robin's Rocking Horse, Silver,
played by a mime. The
performance of Robin at six years
was particularly captivating, the
very young actor stole the scene,

the production was a pit orchestra
of six musicians reinforced by a
large arsenal of recorded music.
Despite the large distance between
the orchestra and the rest of the
cast, the two managed to stay
together nicely on all musical
numbers which ranged in tempo
from the slow swing beat of the
thirties to the amplified rock of
the sixties. While the music was
not terribly memorable, a few
numbers such as "Born to Roam,"
and the finale "Let This Day,"
were unusually nice.
The actors, crew, and
musicians blended their talents in
an occasionally unpolished but
always enthusiastic mixture of
music, drama, comedy, and visual
sensation. ROBIN was one part
music, one part drama, one part
dance, and one part technical
genius, all cemented together with
a barrel of love and enthusiasm.
The performance of any
individual cast member is difficult
to discuss. First the members of
the cast were all equally talented,
and second the cast works as an
ensemble with actors rotating the

roles with each performance. The
play is constructed so each actor
plays many roles anyway during
the course of the play, giving a
picture pf tremendous
adaptability and versatility for
every one of the performers.
Outstanding at Saturday
night's performance were Robin
at the age of six years, Robin at
the age of fourteen years, and
Robin's Rocking Horse, Silver,
played by a mime. The
performance of Robin at six years
was particularly captivating, the
very young actor stole the scene,
if such a thing were possible in
such a broadly based production.
As the play progressed, cast
members moved through a variety
of roles, adding new costumes as
they went; never removing old
ones. The finale includes a
beautifully done scene akin to the
peeling of an onion where the
actors shed their layers of
costumes giving the audience a

visual re-cap of the entire play.
The play is complex enough to
warrant such a review, and it is
equisitely done.
Like any multi-media
production, ROBIN occasionally
slips into a slight technical overkill
where the play is obscured by
many of the things going on on
the stage and walls of the theatre.
Nonetheless, the cast manages to
construct what is an often
confusing but generally
challenging and enjoyable evening
of theatre.

What is 1134 years old, 311'8"
lall, 7859 lbs., and has lots of
hair? Answer: the cast of the
multi-media musical celebration
ROBIN. The cast might be
familiar to some Stanford people;
t,he play ran in Palo Alto for
several weeks last summer, but the
new home for ROBIN is the
Friends and Relations Theatre on
'the Great Highway, a building
Which used to be a rock palace,
the Family Dog.
y The theatre itself presents an
attractive wrapping for an
attractive play. Located at the end
of Playland toward the ocean side
of Golden Gate Park, the theatre
sports a carefully designed and
teolorfully painted exterior. Inside
flies a thrust stage, creating an
acting area about three fourths in
the round. About four hundred
people can fit into the theatre,
but Saturday's crowd was
;nowhere near that size and was
well balanced by the enormous
cast.
),-> The play concerns the
development and life of an
All-American boy, Robin, the son
of Joe and Mary Iveland. Joe is
a butcher who gets drafted and
killed in the second world war,
and the action follows how Robin

is raised from swaddling clothes in
the 1930's to fringed vests in the
1970'5. While the action is a
biographical odyssey much like
other current rock musicals
including Jesus Christ Superstar
and Tommy, much of the action
relates not directly to Robin, but
rather the changes in the world
around him as he grows.
And what action! The biggest
problem for the audience is trying
to catch all the things going on.
The cast includes over twenty-five
actors, most of whom are on stage
at any given moment, or in the
audience, or standing to one side
of the stage, or even sitting down
next to you. Despite the size of
the theatre, the actors who used
acting areas distant from the main
stage kept in tune with the central
action despite its fast pace, thus
creating an intense milieu
everywhere the audience turned.
The technical ensemble
contributed immensely to the
total environment. Screen ring the
entire oval shaped theatre and
throughout the play are
constantly embellished with
projected slides and films relating
to the action. The light cue sheet
must have read like the New York.
City phonebook, and it was a
small miracle that the technical

crew managed to keep a dozen or
so projectors and the battery of
other stage lights under such
tightly coordinated control.
