# Mtn. View Fire
## 
### 
A fire of undetermined origin
completely gutted the Mountain View
recruiting offices of the Army, Navy,
Air Force, and Marine Corp at about
2:30 a.m. this morning.
The fire burned fiercely for about
20 minutes before six Mountain View
Fire Department units extinguished it.
Other offices in the building at 655
West Evelyn Street suffered smoke
damage.
According to a fire marshall at the
scene, a preliminary investigation does
not definitely indicate arson as the
cause of the fire.
The offices have been fire-bombed
before.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation
was notified immediately of the blaze
and will investigate it, in addition to a
routine investigation by the fire
marshall.
