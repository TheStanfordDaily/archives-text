# Proposals Include Refunds
## 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
Students voting in today's ASSU
election on whether to give money to
six different fee assessments are facing
a new feature included in half of the
proposals—the negative option clause.
The three proposed fee requests on
the ballot include refund clauses which
state that if the proposition passes,
any student who wishes to get his
money back may do so.
The proposed assessments which
include the negative option plan are
those of Citizens Advocates, the
Stanford Daily-Publications Board,
and the Afro-American fee request.
The concept of making fee
assessments refundable is new to
Stanford. According to ASSU
Financial Manager Tom Huseby,
"There are no provisions in the ASSU

Constitution for fee refunds. However,
one of the advantages the ASSU does
have in handling this option is that the
ASSU can hold collected funds until
we make sure that the negative option
groups follow student Senate
instructions on refunds."
At their April 6 meeting, the
student Senate established a
centralized procedure for refunding
money voted to the three groups. For
a two-week period during each
quarter, any student who wishes to
have his money refunded from one or
all of the three groups can collect his
money in cash in the ASSU offices in
Tresidder Union.
According to Huseby, this two week
period will begin as soon as the ASSU
gets the fee assessment money from
the University.

The proposed Citizens Advocates
fee assessment, which, if passed by a
two-thirds majority will partially fund
a public interest law firm, was the first
fee referendum to offer the negative
option clause.
Les Kratter, one of the proposal's
sponsors, explained the decision to
include the refund, "We originally got
the idea from Berkeley, which had a
similar public interest law firm
proposed there. That fee assessment
included a negative option plan.
"That proposal was passed three to
one by the students there. The
problem with that assessment is the
UC Regents have refused to collect the
money."
Kratter also said they decided to
include the refund option because the
project's sponsors think that there are
some people who could not afford to
pay the amount of money they are
asking for. Said Kratter, "We also
know that there may be those who
would be widely opposed to such a
proposal."
The Stanford Daily-Publications
Board is also including the negative
option plan in their referendum. Daily
Editor, Frank Miller said, "We
included the negative option clause in
our fee assessment because we don't
think that someone who doesn't read
the Daily should have to pay for it.
There were also some legal
considerations.
"I estimate that since over 90
percent of the student body reads the
Daily more than twice a week, I
estimate no more than 1000 and
probably more like 500, will ask for
their money back."
Three of the proposed fee
assessments on the ballot do not
include the negative option clause.
These are the proposed assessments of
KZSU, Special Events, and the ASSU
Program Fee.
John Broholm explained KZSU's
decision not to include a refund
clause, "We didn't feel we had an
option. We don't pay salaries here, so
it's not as if we can cut salaries to
make up the difference. All our money
goes toward equipment and
maintenance. We have to know exactly
how much money we are going to have
in order to operate—in order to put a
down payment on a transmitter."
Chairman of Special Events, Dave
Elder, gave several reasons for not
including the refund option in that
proposal. "I guess it's because I'm an
economist. I see huge administrative
problems in trying to regulate who
gets a discount on their tickets and
who doesn't.
"It therefore becomes a matter of
public good, like highways, and
therefore something everyone should
support."

a two-week period during each
quarter, any student who wishes to
have his money refunded from one or
all of the three groups can collect his
money in cash in the ASSU offices in
Tresidder Union.
According to Huseby, this two week
period will begin as soon as the ASSU
gets the fee assessment money from
the University.

The proposed Citizens Advocates
fee assessment, which, if passed by a
two-thirds majority will partially fund
a public interest law firm, was the first
fee referendum to offer the negative
option clause.
Les Kratter, one of the proposal's
sponsors, explained the decision to
include the refund, "We originally got
the idea from Berkeley, which had a
similar public interest law firm
proposed there. That fee assessment
included a negative option plan.
"That proposal was passed three to
one by the students there. The
problem with that assessment is the
UC Regents have refused to collect the
money."
Kratter also said they decided to
include the refund option because the
project's sponsors think that there are
some people who could not afford to
pay the amount of money they are
asking for. Said Kratter, "We also
know that there may be those who
would be widely opposed to such a
proposal."
The Stanford Daily-Publications
Board is also including the negative
option plan in their referendum. Daily
Editor, Frank Miller said, "We
included the negative option clause in
our fee assessment because we don't
think that someone who doesn't read
the Daily should have to pay for it.
There were also some legal
considerations.
"I estimate that since over 90
percent of the student body reads the
Daily more than twice a week, I
estimate no more than 1000 and
probably more like 500, will ask for
their money back."
Three of the proposed fee
assessments on the ballot do not
include the negative option clause.
These are the proposed assessments of
KZSU, Special Events, and the ASSU
Program Fee.
John Broholm explained KZSU's
decision not to include a refund
clause, "We didn't feel we had an
option. We don't pay salaries here, so
it's not as if we can cut salaries to
make up the difference. All our money
goes toward equipment and
maintenance. We have to know exactly
how much money we are going to have
in order to operate—in order to put a
down payment on a transmitter."
Chairman of Special Events, Dave
Elder, gave several reasons for not
including the refund option in that
proposal. "I guess it's because I'm an
economist. I see huge administrative
problems in trying to regulate who
gets a discount on their tickets and
who doesn't.
"It therefore becomes a matter of
public good, like highways, and
therefore something everyone should
support."
Students voting in today's ASSU
election on whether to give money to
six different fee assessments are facing
a new feature included in half of the
proposals—the negative option clause.
The three proposed fee requests on
the ballot include refund clauses which
state that if the proposition passes,
any student who wishes to get his
money back may do so.
The proposed assessments which
include the negative option plan are
those of Citizens Advocates, the
Stanford Daily-Publications Board,
and the Afro-American fee request.
The concept of making fee
assessments refundable is new to
Stanford. According to ASSU
Financial Manager Tom Huseby,
"There are no provisions in the ASSU

Constitution for fee refunds. However,
one of the advantages the ASSU does
have in handling this option is that the
ASSU can hold collected funds until
we make sure that the negative option
groups follow student Senate
instructions on refunds."
At their April 6 meeting, the
student Senate established a
centralized procedure for refunding
money voted to the three groups. For
a two-week period during each
quarter, any student who wishes to
have his money refunded from one or
all of the three groups can collect his
money in cash in the ASSU offices in
Tresidder Union.
According to Huseby, this two week
