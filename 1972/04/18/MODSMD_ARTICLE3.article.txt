# Nixon 'Suspends' Bombing, Awaits North Viet Response
## 
### 
SAIGON (AP) - President Nixon has
ordered U.S. bombing of North
Vietnam suspended in the
Hanoi-Haiphong area and greatly
reduced in the southern panhandle
while awaiting a political response
from Hanoi, U.S. military sources
disclosed today.
The suspension order applied to all
territory above the 20th parallel of
latitude, 60 miles south of Hanoi.
"The President is deliberately
holding off after Sunday's strikes in
the Hanoi and Haiphong areas to see
what North Vietnam is going to do,"
said one source. "But further bombing
of Hanoi and Haiphong has not been
ruled out. It depends on what North
Vietnam does."
In Washington, State Department
officials said they had no knowledge
of a bombing cutback.

Yesterday, the U.S. Command had
reported that new raids in the Hanoi
and Haiphong areas were expected.
In Washington yesterday, Secretary
of State William Rogers defended the
new bombing offensive before the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
White House sources said Rogers was
speaking for President Nixon.
The State Department responded to
a Soviet claim that four Russian ships
in Haiphong harbor were damaged in
bombing raids Sunday with a note
which did not concede that the ships
were hit, but said that if they were, "it
was inadvertent and regrettable."
This morning, the U.S. Command
reported that two guided missiles
destroyers were damaged in separate
actions off the coast of North Vietnam
during the weekend and that there
were casualties on both ships.

In the ground war, U.S. officers in
An Loc said the Communists still held
15 percent of the provincial capital 60
miles north of Saigon and had set up a
quasi-govemment in the part they
control.
A government division sent to
relieve the encircled town was diverted
to meet elements of a North
Vietnamese division on the march
apparently for attacks nearer Saigon.
A 1,000-man Cambodian force was
reported cut off in fighting near the
ruins of Angkor Wat. In two days of
fighting, government forces had lost
75 killed and wounded, the high
command reported. No Pathet Lao
casualties were given.
Rogers was the first high
administration official to comment
publicly on the weekend bombings. He
told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee the President had three
purposes in mind in sending the
bombers north:
—"To protect American troops in
South Vietnam and protect the lives of
those troops while the withdrawal
program continues."
—To continue the U.S. withdrawal
program.
-To insure that the South Vietnamese
will be able to defend themselves.
The secretary told the committee
the United States has "no intention of
permitting North Vietnam to take over
South Vietnam by force."
In this line, he said, "I'm not going
to make any announcement about
what we're not going to do," adding
two exceptions:
There will be no reintroduction of
U.S. ground combat troops and there
will be no use of nuclear weapons in
Vietnam.
Otherwise, the President will take
whatever action necessary to meet the
three conditions that brought about
the weekend bombing, Rogers said.
The air raids, the secretary went on,
represented no change of policy and
followed the pattern Nixon has
constantly set out: to take necessary
action to protect American troops.
In the face of hostile questions by
committee chairman Sen. J.W.
Fulbright, D-Ark., and Sen. Frank
Church, D-Idaho, the secretary said
the air raids were confined to military
targets.

Defense Secretary Melvin Laird goes
before the panel this morning.
Until Sunday, the U.S. aerial
campaign against the North, which
began April 6, had been limited to the
southern part of North Vietnam, well
to the south of Hanoi and its port city,
Haiphong.
The official U.S. source here said
yesterday that "I think that if the
North continues the offensive in the
South, Nixon will go back to Hanoi
and Haiphong. He means business. He
has no intention of demolishing the
North, but he wants to let them know
what he will do."
He declined to estimate how big an
aerial campaign it would take now to
seriously affect Hanoi's current general
offensive.
U.S. military sources said the thrust
of yesterday's air strikes had shifted
back to enemy troop concentrations
and base areas in South Vietnam.
The State Department did not
concede that Soviet ships had been hit
at Haiphong, but said "it was
inadvertent and regrettable" if they
were. It added that "countries which
supply offensive equipment to the
North Vietnamese . . . share
responsibility."
The command said the American
destroyers attacked were the Worden,
which the Pentagon announced earlier
was attacked Sunday, apparently by a
North Vietnamese gunboat, and the
Buchanan. It gave no details on the
attack on the Buchanan.
The Pentagon said one crewman was
killed and several others were
wounded in the attack on the Worden.
A spokesman said the ship was
operating about 50 miles off the coast
at the time.
