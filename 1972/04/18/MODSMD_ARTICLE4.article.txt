# NLRB Election
## Stanford Fights Union 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Controversy over a Teamster
publicity booklet heated up yesterday
when the Union questioned the
propriety of the University hiring a
former National Labor Relations
Board employee who officiated when
the Teamsters petitioned the NLRB to
allow Stanford workers to unionize.
Sixteen hundred Stanford
employees vote tomorrow on whether
the Teamsters should represent them
as a collective bargaining agent.
The employee in question is
Counsel for Employee Relations Doug
Barton, who was hearing officer in the
fall of 1970 when the Teamsters
petitioned for a bargaining unit of 196
physical plant workers to choose a
union for collective bargaining
purposes.
Barton, hired last September by the
University, was one of the authors of a
full-page ad in yesterday's Daily that
claimed the booklet, mailed to
University workers last week,
contained false statements. The
booklet and ensuing advertisement are
subjects of growing debate between
Stanford and the Teamsters.
Request Denied
The national office of the NLRB
denied the Teamster petition this
January, granting instead a petition by
the California School Employees
Association-Stanford Employees

Association that provided for a much
larger unit of 1600 workers. The unit
must vote Wednesday on whether it
wants to be represented by the
Teamsters.
Teamster organizer Rudy Tham did
not specifically say that the University
violated any laws by hiring Barton, but
said he considered it "very serious"
and that the Teamster attorneys were
looking into the matter.
"The rule speaks in terms of
representing the University before the
NLRB," Barton said. "And I have not
done that."
Section 102.119 of the NLRB Rules
says that no former NLRB employee
"shall engage in practice before the
Board or its agent in any respect or in
any capacity in connection with any
case or proceeding which was pending
in any regional office to which he was
attorney during the time of his
employment with the Board."
"That's very broad," Tham said.
"He's been working on the case. And
he gave you |the Daily] the copy for
that ad in your office."
"The newspaper isn't the NLRB,"
observed Barton.
He said that the University was
aware of his past employment with the
NLRB at the time he was hired, and
that the entire question was hashed
out then. "I was not privy to any
information that anyone not in my

position would not have had access
to," Barton said of his job as hearing
officer."I was a neutral hearing
officer." He pointed out that he was
hired by Stanford last fall, five months
before the NLRB ruling on the
Teamster petition.
Settled
"Actually, when I was hired, we
thought the whole thing would have
been settled much before this," Barton
said.
Tham also took issue with the
contents of the ad the University took
out, entitled "Does The Truth Hurt?"
He gave the Daily a point-by-point
rebuttal last night. The ad was printed
in an attempt to show alleged
inaccuracies in the Teamster Booklet,
"Brighten Your Economic Future."
The University's argument was that
Teamster claims that Stanford
employees will have their own local
union were untrue, unless a new
petition was presented to the NLRB.
"Going through our legal
department we can turn around and if
the people wish to have local 860
[Tham's local is 856] we could turn it
over to them," Tham said. "Initially,
856 is going to do their bargaining,
and then if they want their own local,
we'll give it to them."
"That's just not right," Barton told
the Daily. "What the NLRB is
concerned with is continuity of
representation ... There might be
employees who don't want to make a
change."
No Law
The advertisement also said there
was no law requiring the Teamsters to
accept any employee into the union,
"It's a Teamster International
Constitution law," Tham said. "It's
stupid to say there is no federal or
state law (as the ad did). We didn't
quote any federal or state law."
"Then I guess it wasn't so stupid to
say there was no federal or state law,
was it?" responded Barton. "The
Teamster literature implies that there
is a law that cannot be overturned by
the Teamsters themselves."
The University advertisement said
that government offices in San
Francisco have no copies of local 856
bylaws as required by the
Landrum-Griffin Act. But Tham
claimed that the bylaws were filed
with the Department of Labor in
Washington, D.C. in 1957, and again in

1963 and 1967 when they were
revised.
Barton couldn't rebut Tham's claim,
saying only that thy purpose of the
lawâ€”to have bylaws available to
anyone who might want to see
them -isn't served if the documents
are in Washington.
The next charge in the
advertisement was that only members
of the union are allowed to participate
in strike votes, and that, as previously
claimed, there is nothing requiring the
Teamsters to accept all employees into
the union.
"If we negotiate a union shop
contract, evervone would be a member
of the union, wouldn't they?" Tham
said. 'This is misleading on their
part."
But Barton pointed out: "It's not a
violation of the Taft-Hartley for a
union to expel a man on grounds other
than not paying dues . . . It's entirely
possible for an employee to not be a
member in good voting standing, but
still have to pay dues and initiation
fees. It has happened."

The ad also disputed Teamster
claims that no dues must be paid to
the union until a contract is ratified.
Tham quoted Article XVII of the local
856 bylaws to the effect that
"initiation fees and dues may be
waived or reduced in connection with
the organizing of unorganized
employees at the discretion of the
local Executive Board." He said that
the 856 Executive Board had already
done that.
Barton said he hadn't seen the local
bylaws, but added he thought the dues
waiver might be in conflict with the
Teamster International Constitution.
"I didn't see any loopholes in there,
but there might have been one," he
told the Daily.
The ad said that the Teamsters
International Constitution has a
provision for fines for local members if
the national treasury falls below $20
million. Tham admitted that, but
pointed out his local has never levied
any fines. "We've got $96 million in
the treasury," he said. "How in the

hell can you do that? How can the
international union lose $76 million?"
Barton said he had no idea what was in
the Teamster treasury, and couldn't
respond.
The ad also said that pensions,
insurance plans, and health plans could
not, as a rule, be negotiated in excess
of 2.2 percent, according to the
Federal Pay Board. Tham said the
union could get around that by
proving how "substandard" current
University programs in that area are.
Barton had no comment.
The rest of the ad concerned
salaries from private industry
compared to salaries for similar jobs at
Stanford. Tham claimed that the
figures given by the University in the
ad w?re not fair because they
represented an average of salaries from
both union and non-union businesses.
"It lowers their rates considerably,"
Tham claimed.
Barton said the figures the
University cited in the ad were
compiled from surveys he considered
'fair and accurate."
