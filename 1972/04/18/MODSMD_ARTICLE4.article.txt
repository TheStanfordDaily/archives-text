# NLRB Election
## Stanford Fights Union 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Controversy over a Teamster
publicity booklet heated up yesterday
when the Union questioned the
propriety of the University hiring a
former National Labor Relations
Board employee who officiated when
the Teamsters petitioned the NLRB to
allow Stanford workers to unionize.
Sixteen hundred Stanford
employees vote tomorrow on whether
the Teamsters should represent them
as a collective bargaining agent.
The employee in question is
Counsel for Employee Relations Doug
Barton, who was hearing officer in the
fall of 1970 when the Teamsters
petitioned for a bargaining unit of 196
physical plant workers to choose a
union for collective bargaining
purposes.
Barton, hired last September by the
University, was one of the authors of a
full-page ad in yesterday's Daily that
claimed the booklet, mailed to
University workers last week,
contained false statements. The
booklet and ensuing advertisement are
subjects of growing debate between
Stanford and the Teamsters.
Request Denied
The national office of the NLRB
denied the Teamster petition this
January, granting instead a petition by
the California School Employees
Association-Stanford Employees

Association that provided for a much
larger unit of 1600 workers. The unit
must vote Wednesday on whether it
wants to be represented by the
Teamsters.
Teamster organizer Rudy Tham did
not specifically say that the University
violated any laws by hiring Barton, but
said he considered it "very serious"
and that the Teamster attorneys were
looking into the matter.
"The rule speaks in terms of
representing the University before the
NLRB," Barton said. "And I have not
done that."
Section 102.119 of the NLRB Rules
says that no former NLRB employee
"shall engage in practice before the
Board or its agent in any respect or in
any capacity in connection with any
case or proceeding which was pending
in any regional office to which he was
attorney during the time of his
employment with the Board."
"That's very broad," Tham said.
"He's been working on the case. And
he gave you |the Daily] the copy for
that ad in your office."
"The newspaper isn't the NLRB,"
observed Barton.
He said that the University was
aware of his past employment with the
NLRB at the time he was hired, and
that the entire question was hashed
out then. "I was not privy to any
information that anyone not in my

position would not have had access
to," Barton said of his job as hearing
officer."I was a neutral hearing
officer." He pointed out that he was
hired by Stanford last fall, five months
before the NLRB ruling on the
Teamster petition.
Settled
"Actually, when I was hired, we
thought the whole thing would have
been settled much before this," Barton
said.
Tham also took issue with the
contents of the ad the University took
out, entitled "Does The Truth Hurt?"
He gave the Daily a point-by-point
rebuttal last night. The ad was printed
in an attempt to show alleged
inaccuracies in the Teamster Booklet,
"Brighten Your Economic Future."
The University's argument was that
Teamster claims that Stanford
employees will have their own local
union were untrue, unless a new
petition was presented to the NLRB.
"Going through our legal
department we can turn around and if
the people wish to have local 860
[Tham's local is 856] we could turn it
over to them," Tham said. "Initially,
856 is going to do their bargaining,
and then if they want their own local,
we'll give it to them."
"That's just not right," Barton told
the Daily. "What the NLRB is
