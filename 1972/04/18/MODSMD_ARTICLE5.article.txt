# Presidency, Assessments
## ASSU Election Begins Today 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
Students go to the polls today and
tomorrow in the annual ASSU Spring
primary elections and they will vote
on the issues of the "Big Game"
bonfire, fee assessments, constitutional
amendments, and will elect an ASSU
Council of Presidents, Student
Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC)
members and senior class officers.
This year's primary election
includes some new election
procedures. All polling places will be
open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and
students will be able to vote both
today and tomorrow during lunch and
dinner hours in some dorms.
Regular polling places are located at
the Med School, the Business School,
the Post Office, the Law School
Lounge, Engineering Corner, and the
Physics Tank.
Students may vote during lunch in
the Wilbur, Stern and Lagunita Court
dormitories, and during dinner in
Roble, Florence Moore, and Branner
Hall.
Eight Slates
Eight slates are listed as candidates
for the offices of ASSU president and
vice-president, respectively, James
Anderson and William Chaplin; Rocky
Barber and Chuck Fay; Scott Burke
and Elaine Wong; Chris Hocker and
Robin Friedman; John Kenney and
Barry Porster; Bill Legard and Jeff
Wyden; Rodney Palmer and Rosie

Wolf; and Dave Rudick and Bruce P.
Douglas.
A recent by-law amendment allows
students to write-in candidates for the
offices of ASSU president and
vice-president. The only requirement is
that write-in candidates must be
registered students in good standing.
If no slate receives a majority of
votes cast, a run-off election will be
held on April 25 and 26.

(See back page for related story on
negative option fee assessments.)

There are five candidates for the
three student positions on the SCLC.
They are C. Robert Garcia, "Uncle
Bruce" Kaup, David Pattison, and
Kathy Waller.
Class Presidents
Members of the class of 73 are
allowed to vote for the president,
vice-president, and business manager
positions of the senior class. The
choice is between two slates, Burr
Field, Jane Almas, Randy Bames, and
Anita Ewing; and Doug Single, Cliff
Nancarrow, Don Mulford, and Rick
Dickinson.
There are six different fee referenda
on the ballot. Three of the proposed
assessments include, for the first time,
a negative option clause which says
that any student who desires a refund

clause may do so for two weeks during
fall quarter.
The three fee referenda which
include the negative option clause are
the Afro-American Program which
asks $1 for fall quarter; the
Daily-Publications Board which is
asking $1 for fall quarter for the Pub
Board, and $1 each for winter, spring,
and summer for tfte Daily; and the
Citizens Advocates Public Interest Law
Project which is asking for $2 for fall
quarter, $1 for winter, $2 for spring,
and $1 for summer quarter.
No Refund
The three proposed assessments
without refund clauses are ASSU
Special Events, the ASSU Program
Fee, and KZSU, which are each asking
$1 for fall, winter, and spring quarter.
All the proposed fee assessments on
the ballot, except for the Citizens
Advocates proposal, need only a
simple majority to pass. Because
Citizens Advocates is asking for money
for a period of three years, it must
pass by a two-thirds majority.
The three constitutional questions
on the ballot deal with the status of
the vice-president on a Council of
Presidents.
The final referendum on the ballot
is a question which reads, "Should
there be a 'Big Game' bonfire this
coming year, as had been held in the
past?" The referendum requires only a
yes or no vote.
