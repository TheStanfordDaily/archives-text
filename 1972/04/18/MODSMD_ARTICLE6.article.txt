## Build A National Student Strike 
### 
Community response to the latest insane escalation of the
Indochina war must be quick, clear, and strong.
President Nixon's suspension of the bombing of Hanoi and
Haiphong late last night, at best a conditional, political gimmick, does
not change the central issue of an escalating conflict which more than
ever displays the moral bankruptcy of American foreign policy for
the last 20 years.
The events of the last weeks-and the fact that bombing of Hanoi
and Haiphong may resume at any time as long as we remain involved
in the war-make a domestic response critical to bring pressure to bear
on the decision makers.
Two years ago, in response to an escalation in the war-the invasion
of Cambodia—anti-war feeling coalesced into a national student strike.
The pressure of this nationwide effort was an undeniable factor in the
withdrawal of the invasion.
To say that a unified, national student protest can end the war is
obviously an overstatement. However, the potential for influence
among public leaders and the American people must be neither
underestimated nor ignored.

The initial response of this community should be a strike—the
abandonment of normal classroom activities in favor of concerned
action to deliver the unmistakeable message that university
communities will not accept the continuation of action
must be the beginning of wider community action made possible by
the freeing of energy from regular classroom work.
Once we leave the classrooms, our work should take the form of
helping to crystallize and mobilize antiwar sentiment in the
community.
A memorandum prepared by Admiral Thomas H. Moorer,
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and released last week by Rep.
Michael Harrington (D-Mass.) clarifies our importance as students
opposed to the war. If the United States were released from
"domestic restraints" says the memorandum, it might undertake
amphibious operations against the North or bombing of irrigation
ditches in the quest for victory. The only restraint on Nixon's policies
is that imposed by the American people. Ana it is our task as
students, who have come this way before, to ensure that domestic
restraints remain firm.
It is depressing to find ourselves once again in a position where a
student strike is a major recourse at home to protest American policy
in Indochina. But a strike, freeing energies for the necessary work of
providing an unmistakeable message to the politicians who continue
to kill the people of Indochina, must begin immediately.
We are divided on the effects and morality-or at least the
inevitability-of the trashing last night. But we agree unanimously that
a broad-based strike, working both here and in the community, will
make such actions unquestionably unnecessary and unwise.
We join more than 20 campus newspapers across the country in this
call for a unified national strike. Many of these papers advocate a
moratorium on classes Friday, asking that University Presidents cancel
classes that day. These schools urge that the strike be tied in to
proposed nationwide community demonstrations Saturday. To this
end we urge support of Saturday's Kezar Stadium anti-war
demonstration.
We feel that our community must now decide the length and nature
of a strike, to begin the mobilization of domestic forces necessary to
bring about the end of the killing in Indochina.

classes that day. These schools urge that the strike be tied in to
proposed nationwide community demonstrations Saturday. To this
end we urge support of Saturday's Kezar Stadium anti-war
demonstration.
We feel that our community must now decide the length and nature
of a strike, to begin the mobilization of domestic forces necessary to
bring about the end of the killing in Indochina.
Community response to the latest insane escalation of the
Indochina war must be quick, clear, and strong.
President Nixon's suspension of the bombing of Hanoi and
Haiphong late last night, at best a conditional, political gimmick, does
not change the central issue of an escalating conflict which more than
ever displays the moral bankruptcy of American foreign policy for
the last 20 years.
The events of the last weeks-and the fact that bombing of Hanoi
and Haiphong may resume at any time as long as we remain involved
in the war-make a domestic response critical to bring pressure to bear
on the decision makers.
Two years ago, in response to an escalation in the war-the invasion
of Cambodia—anti-war feeling coalesced into a national student strike.
The pressure of this nationwide effort was an undeniable factor in the
withdrawal of the invasion.
To say that a unified, national student protest can end the war is
obviously an overstatement. However, the potential for influence
among public leaders and the American people must be neither
underestimated nor ignored.

The initial response of this community should be a strike—the
abandonment of normal classroom activities in favor of concerned
action to deliver the unmistakeable message that university
communities will not accept the continuation of action
must be the beginning of wider community action made possible by
the freeing of energy from regular classroom work.
Once we leave the classrooms, our work should take the form of
helping to crystallize and mobilize antiwar sentiment in the
community.
A memorandum prepared by Admiral Thomas H. Moorer,
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and released last week by Rep.
Michael Harrington (D-Mass.) clarifies our importance as students
opposed to the war. If the United States were released from
"domestic restraints" says the memorandum, it might undertake
amphibious operations against the North or bombing of irrigation
ditches in the quest for victory. The only restraint on Nixon's policies
is that imposed by the American people. Ana it is our task as
students, who have come this way before, to ensure that domestic
restraints remain firm.
It is depressing to find ourselves once again in a position where a
student strike is a major recourse at home to protest American policy
in Indochina. But a strike, freeing energies for the necessary work of
providing an unmistakeable message to the politicians who continue
to kill the people of Indochina, must begin immediately.
We are divided on the effects and morality-or at least the
inevitability-of the trashing last night. But we agree unanimously that
a broad-based strike, working both here and in the community, will
make such actions unquestionably unnecessary and unwise.
We join more than 20 campus newspapers across the country in this
call for a unified national strike. Many of these papers advocate a
moratorium on classes Friday, asking that University Presidents cancel
classes that day. These schools urge that the strike be tied in to
proposed nationwide community demonstrations Saturday. To this
end we urge support of Saturday's Kezar Stadium anti-war
demonstration.
