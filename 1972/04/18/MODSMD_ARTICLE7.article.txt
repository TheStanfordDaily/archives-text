# Vote NO Teamsters
## 
### 
Last month, before the first NLRB election, the Daily editorialized
in favor of unions at Stanford. We still believe that Stanford
employees need a union, but we do not think the Teamsters is that
union. We recommend a no vote in tomorrow's NLRB election, with
the hope that, in a year, Stanford workers will choose some union
other than the Teamsters.
Rudy Tham, a Teamster organizer, has said that "we don't
understand campus politics, and we're learning the hard way ... All
we want is a better wage for the working man." A better wage is, of
course, one of the things a union should obtain for its members.
But a union which admittedly does not understand the nuances of
campus politics, and apparently is not prepared to learn, cannot
effectively or usefully represent Stanford's workers.
We recognize the strength of Teamster strikes and strike threats-a
strength essential to any effective union-and regret that workers will
not be able to bargain collectively for another year if the Teamsters
are defeated. However, if the Teamster's lose the election, other
campus unions will continue to represent workers in grievance
hearings and protect the interests of minorities and women-services
the Teamsters do not emphasize.
The Teamsters are a trade union of the old school—they know how
to deal with longshoremen and truck drivers (and we respect their
skills in these areas) but do not comprehend the different
environment on a university campus.
Although several incidents come to mind, the Teamsters' lack of
principles was demonstrated most recently last week when the Daily
prepared to report information Teamster organizer Rudy Tham
believed unfavorable to his union. When he learned of the Daily's
plans, Tham called the newspaper office and angrily told the reporter
covering the story:
"You don't print that. If you print that, your journalistic career is
going to end very quickly . . . We've got a staff of three dozen lawyers
and if you print that, they're going to stuff a lawsuit up your ass
tomorrow morning." Later in this conversation, he offered the
reporter a job with the Teamsters.
We do not object only because Tham threatened the Daily, or
offered the reporter what appears to be a bribe. We also worry
because the Teamsters seem ready to threaten or bribe others, with no
end in sight. Stanford and its workers do not need a union which, as a
theory of bargaining, believes that everyone can be either bribed or
intimidated.
In a year (or less, if the composition of the voting units changes)
Stanford employees may vote again, and we hope will confer upon
some union other than the Teamsters the right to represent workers in
collective bargaining.
Stanford workers should vote against the Teamsters tomorrow.
They can surely do better than the Teamsters next year.

strength essential to any effective union-and regret that workers will
not be able to bargain collectively for another year if the Teamsters
are defeated. However, if the Teamster's lose the election, other
campus unions will continue to represent workers in grievance
hearings and protect the interests of minorities and women-services
the Teamsters do not emphasize.
The Teamsters are a trade union of the old school—they know how
to deal with longshoremen and truck drivers (and we respect their
skills in these areas) but do not comprehend the different
environment on a university campus.
Although several incidents come to mind, the Teamsters' lack of
principles was demonstrated most recently last week when the Daily
prepared to report information Teamster organizer Rudy Tham
believed unfavorable to his union. When he learned of the Daily's
plans, Tham called the newspaper office and angrily told the reporter
covering the story:
"You don't print that. If you print that, your journalistic career is
going to end very quickly . . . We've got a staff of three dozen lawyers
and if you print that, they're going to stuff a lawsuit up your ass
tomorrow morning." Later in this conversation, he offered the
reporter a job with the Teamsters.
We do not object only because Tham threatened the Daily, or
offered the reporter what appears to be a bribe. We also worry
because the Teamsters seem ready to threaten or bribe others, with no
end in sight. Stanford and its workers do not need a union which, as a
theory of bargaining, believes that everyone can be either bribed or
intimidated.
In a year (or less, if the composition of the voting units changes)
Stanford employees may vote again, and we hope will confer upon
some union other than the Teamsters the right to represent workers in
collective bargaining.
Stanford workers should vote against the Teamsters tomorrow.
They can surely do better than the Teamsters next year.
