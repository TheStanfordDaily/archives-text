# narrow student role
## Improved Student Services

Several campus pundits have
likened our candidacy to Sen.
Vance Hartke's abortive try for
the Democratic presidential
nomination. While the comparison
is unflattering, there are certain
similarities. Like Hartke, we are
hardly "front runners" and we are
dismissed by the press as "minor
candidates." But we wouldn't be
running if we didn't believe that
we have at least a chance; that
ours is a widely-held view of the
ASSU that no other candidates
express.
First look at our opponents.
Nearly all seem to be graduates of
the Hubert Humphrey school of
campaigning: the way to win an
election is to out-promise your
opponents. Thus, this campaign
has seen the Burke slate, the
Barber slate and the SRM slate
locked in a furious struggle to
promise more and promise it first.

True, the Hocker ticket has made
just one main promise, but
abolition of the ASSU or
rendering membership completely
voluntary is too drastic a cure for
the problem.
Student dissatisfaction with
the ASSU is wide and nearly every
candidate has been perceptive
enough to notice this. Thus, most
campaigns are based on
opposition to the current state of
ASSU affairs. Yet, for most
candidates this is a curiously
contradictory position. They
condemn the current ASSU, yet
they run the ASSU; they sit on
the ASSU committees and in the
Senate. And they're all so serious,
too, as if ASSU politics is a life or
death matter. They pretend that
they can solve so many evils from
the second floor of Tresidder.

We don't believe these
candidates embody what students
want from the ASSU or ASSU
officials. Students don't want
crusaders who will attempt to slay
every conceivable dragon in the
name of "students' interests."
ASSU leaders can't solve every
problem confronting this country
or this University from the ASSU
office. Candidates promise more
commissions, more investigations,
more confrontations, yet they fail
to see that all students expect of
the ASSU is a device to provide
student services.
The ASSU is inherently unable
to solve every possible problem;
we shouldn. pretend it can.
Instead, we should concentrate on
what it can do — provide student
services. This is a narrow view of
the ASSU, perhaps what the Daily

would call an "overly narrow"
view, but it is, we believe, the
correct view. We intend to
concentrate on STUDENT
SERVICES (like an improved
concert series, improvements in
Tresidder, an on-campus bank,
etc.) instead of using the ASSU to
push our favorite political projects
in the name of the student body.
The petty bickering, the
political in-fighting, the very
things that disgust students most
have come when ASSU officers
have tried to push beyond the
limited role of ASSU and focused
instead on their own political
goals. And, from the statements
of the other candidates, we have
no indication that things will be
any different next year.
We have been faced this year
with an inordinate number of
special fee assessment referenda;
six in this election alone. We
suggest that ALL special fee
assessments be made voluntary
and refundable. This would enable
each student to determine for
himself which assessments he
supports and prevent anyone
being coerced into paying
assessments he wouldn't otherwise
support.
We have said before that the
ASSU joke won't stop with just a
new set of comedians. That is why
we are running. From he
statements and campaigns of the
other candidates we know
the ASSU won't be much
different next year; we'll have the
same ambitious campus politics
pushing their projects in our name
and we'll have the same bickering
in the Senate. Things won't be
any different, that is unless we
elect ASSU officials with
"narrow" or limited view of the <
ASSU; officials who will resist the
temptation to glorify themselves
in our name.
No matter what the size of our
vote, we intend to claim a "moral
victory" since any votes will be
more than the campus pundits
were willing to concede us.
Perhaps too we'll hold a final
press conference and tell the Daily
they won't have Anderson and
Chaplin to kick around anymore.
Who knows, that could lead to a
political rebirth.

campaigning: the way to win an
election is to out-promise your
opponents. Thus, this campaign
has seen the Burke slate, the
Barber slate and the SRM slate
locked in a furious struggle to
promise more and promise it first.

True, the Hocker ticket has made
just one main promise, but
abolition of the ASSU or
rendering membership completely
voluntary is too drastic a cure for
the problem.
Student dissatisfaction with
the ASSU is wide and nearly every
candidate has been perceptive
enough to notice this. Thus, most
campaigns are based on
opposition to the current state of
ASSU affairs. Yet, for most
candidates this is a curiously
contradictory position. They
condemn the current ASSU, yet
they run the ASSU; they sit on
the ASSU committees and in the
Senate. And they're all so serious,
too, as if ASSU politics is a life or
death matter. They pretend that
they can solve so many evils from
the second floor of Tresidder.

We don't believe these
candidates embody what students
want from the ASSU or ASSU
officials. Students don't want
crusaders who will attempt to slay
every conceivable dragon in the
name of "students' interests."
ASSU leaders can't solve every
problem confronting this country
or this University from the ASSU
office. Candidates promise more
commissions, more investigations,
more confrontations, yet they fail
to see that all students expect of
the ASSU is a device to provide
student services.
The ASSU is inherently unable
to solve every possible problem;
we shouldn. pretend it can.
Instead, we should concentrate on
what it can do — provide student
services. This is a narrow view of
the ASSU, perhaps what the Daily

would call an "overly narrow"
view, but it is, we believe, the
correct view. We intend to
concentrate on STUDENT
SERVICES (like an improved
concert series, improvements in
Tresidder, an on-campus bank,
etc.) instead of using the ASSU to
push our favorite political projects
in the name of the student body.
The petty bickering, the
political in-fighting, the very
things that disgust students most
have come when ASSU officers
have tried to push beyond the
limited role of ASSU and focused
instead on their own political
goals. And, from the statements
of the other candidates, we have
no indication that things will be
any different next year.
We have been faced this year
with an inordinate number of
special fee assessment referenda;
six in this election alone. We
suggest that ALL special fee
assessments be made voluntary
and refundable. This would enable
each student to determine for
himself which assessments he
supports and prevent anyone
being coerced into paying
assessments he wouldn't otherwise
support.
We have said before that the
ASSU joke won't stop with just a
new set of comedians. That is why
we are running. From he
statements and campaigns of the
other candidates we know
the ASSU won't be much
different next year; we'll have the
same ambitious campus politics
pushing their projects in our name
and we'll have the same bickering
in the Senate. Things won't be
any different, that is unless we
elect ASSU officials with
"narrow" or limited view of the <
ASSU; officials who will resist the
temptation to glorify themselves
in our name.
No matter what the size of our
vote, we intend to claim a "moral
victory" since any votes will be
more than the campus pundits
were willing to concede us.
Perhaps too we'll hold a final
press conference and tell the Daily
they won't have Anderson and
Chaplin to kick around anymore.
Who knows, that could lead to a
political rebirth.

Several campus pundits have
likened our candidacy to Sen.
Vance Hartke's abortive try for
the Democratic presidential
nomination. While the comparison
is unflattering, there are certain
similarities. Like Hartke, we are
hardly "front runners" and we are
dismissed by the press as "minor
candidates." But we wouldn't be
running if we didn't believe that
we have at least a chance; that
ours is a widely-held view of the
ASSU that no other candidates
express.

the Hubert Humphrey school of
