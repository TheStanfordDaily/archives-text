# vote today, tomorrow
## Council Election Choices

Today and tomorrow the
student body will be voting on
various issues — fee assessments,
constitutional amendments,
presidential slates, and other
representative positions. Because
we have researched the various
issues and candidates, we feel that
it is important to inform the
student body of our position.
ASSU Presidential and
Vice-Presidential Candidates: No
endorsement until the run-off
election.
ASSU Proposed Constitutional
Amendments: We feel that there
are structural deficiencies inherent
in them. Although the first
proposed Amendment provides
for the Vice-Presidents to be
ex-officio members of the Senate
without vote, it does not provide
for the other duties of the
Vice-President which are outlined
in the ASSU Constitution and
By-laws. If there is going to be
more than one Vice-President, all
said duties should be clarified
before such an amendment is
placed before the students.
We oppose the proposed
Constitutional Amendments and
urge students to vote NO.
ASSU Referenda: For the past
few years, students have been in
the forefront of the ecology
movement. For Stanford to be
immune from the tenets of

environmentalism is hypocritical.
For Stanford students to cry in
outrage about pollution and then
to allow pollution can only be
seen as the typical position which
"intellectuals" take. We feel that a
better environment is essential
and that efforts toward that goal
can begin here.
We oppose the continuation of
the Big Game bonfire and urge
students to vote NO.
Student Conduct Legislative
Council Candidates: No
Endorsement.
ASSU Senior Class Officers
Candidates: No Endorsement.
Afro-American Program
Special Assessment: We feel that
the proposed Afro-American
Program Special Assessment is the
kind of program which promotes
better understanding through the
sponsoring of educational and
cutural events and therefore is
worthy of every student's
support.
Some of the positive aspects of
this program are as follows:
a. It is not expensive, yet it
would provide dynamic
speakers, musicians, artists, and
the continuation of a
newspaper for the enjoyment
of all students;
b. All of the programs
supported by the fee
» assessment are open to the
en tire student body, and thus
not just a few students benefit,
but the whole community;
c. Although the refundable
nature of the assessment is not
emphasized, it is clear that
those who cannot afford the
program can get their money
back.
We strongly feel that a one
dollar refundable assessment for
only one quarter is not too much
to ask for an improved campus
cultural environment; in fact it is
a good investment for a greatly
needed program — a program
creating greater community
awareness and understanding.
We support the Afro-American
Program Special Assessment and
urge students to vote YES.
ASSU Program Fee: The
Program Fee is the Constitutional
method for distributing
assessments to ASSU
organizations. It includes not only
those particular organizations, but
also divisional organizations which
are generally composed of
graduate students. We feel that
the Program Fee is a more
efficient way to allocate money
than the onslaught of Special
Assessments and movies: more
people get some of the money and
it is cheaper for the student body.
A budget of the Program Fee
is recommended not only by the
Senate's Finance Committee, but
also by the Financial Manager.
Their recommendations are
studied by the Senate as a whole.
The Program Fee, in accordance
with the ASSU Constitution, is
mandatory and non-refundable.
We support the ASSU Program
Fee and urge students to vote
YES.
ASSU Special Events: We
support this assessment because
the concerts provided by Special
Events are accessible to all
students at prices which are
tailored for students. It is
imperative that this branch of the
ASSU maintain sufficient capital
»to allow it to bring top quality
entertainment to campus.
Special Events also aids other
campus groups, on a consulting
basis, in producing their own
shows. Further, this assessment
would allow Special Events
greater independence from
University control. The control
has, in the past, been not only
discouraging, but also costly.
We support the ASSU Special
Events Assessment and urge
students to vote YES.
Daily-Publications Board Fee
Assessment Proposal: We cannot
support this assessment because
we feel that it is inappropriate to
fuse the question of a Daily

assessment with an assessment for
the Storke building renovation
and support for other publications
such asl the Chaparral. The Pub
Board assessment is excessive for
the other publications, and should
be .divided from the question of
an independent Daily. The Pub
Board publications were
encouraged to place themselves
under the Program Fee, but they
felt their chances were better if
they rode the coattails of the
Daily request. Such collusion is
not, in our opinion, in the best
interests of the student body.
We oppose the
Daily-Publications Board Fee
Assessment Proposal and urge
students to vote NO.
Furthermore, we urge the Daily to
present its case for a fee
assessment and independence in
an election to be held later this
quarter and separate from any
other issues.
KZSU SPECIAL
ASSESSMENT: We feel that
KZSU as a student orgranization
should continue to exist as such.
Although we still question the
assumption that it will, we do feel
that there are merits to KZSU's
request. Increased power will
consolidate the signal to the
Stanford commur, ty area in
which many places cannot now
get KZSU; the estimated cost of
increasing power is $125,000 but
KZSU with voluntary man-hours,
can"do it with $15,000.
If the Commission on Public
Broadcasting Bill passes the
congress, there are strong
possibilities for financing KZSU
from the Commission.
We also feel, on the other
hand, that regardless of the
improvements and operational
expenses needed by KZSU, they
are asking for a very large amount
of money. If they find a need for
money after this year, we feel that
they should seek that money
through the regular program fee.
Although we do not state a
particular position on this issue,
we urge students to study the
issues involved in this request and
to vote according to its merits.
Public Interest Law Project:
Although this assessment has been
supported by such youthful gurus
as Pete McCloskey and Ralph
Nader, we feel that students
should not support it. This group
is asking the student body to foot
the bill for an agency which will
be tackling highly political issues.
The agency will be directed by
a board of directors which will be
composed of students and
individual off-campus. The
selection of the off campus
persons was done in a mysterious
fashion with little participation by
the general student body. Further
although 50 percent of the money
spent by the board will be from
the student body, the board will
be comprised of less than 50
percent students selected by the
student body at large. We feel that
this is inadequate control of
political expenditure of student
monies.
We feel very strongly that this
group should seek outside funding
and voluntary student gifts. It is
inappropriate for student money
to flow off-campus in this way.
We also feel that it would be
unfair for students to commit the
student body to this assessment
for three years. The refundable
nature of this assessment does not
change the fundamental question
involved here.
We oppose the Public Interest
Law Project and urge students to
vote NO.
We feel that the issues and
candidates in the upcoming
election are very important.
Although we do not endorse any
particular candidates for
representative positions, we urge
all students to study their
campaign material and to talk to
them in order to make a fair
decision. Above all, we urge
students to VOTE.

Council of Presidents.)
