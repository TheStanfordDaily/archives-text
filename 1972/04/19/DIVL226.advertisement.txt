By DOROTHY NELKIN. The events leading up to
M I.T.'s decision to divest its controversial Instru
mentation Laboratory are vividly set forth in this en
grossing case study. The decision, announced on
May 20, 1970. followed a year of efforts to cope with
dissent focused on the question of weapons-related
research on campus. Several key issues are illumi
nated in the narrative: the problems of defining ap
propriate research and public service policy in uni
versities; the social responsibility of scientists and
engineers; and the complicated relationship between
government sponsorship and university research.
