# Ballot Errors, Heavy Voting Mark First Day Of Election
## 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
Several errors on the ballot and a
very heavy voter turnout marked the
first day of the problem-plagued ASSU
primary election. Voting ends today in
the election.
Two of the errors on the ballot are
technical mistakes involving the six
proposed fee assessments. The errors
make voting on the proposals
confusing but Elections Commissioner,
Johnny Lawson said he did not feel
the mistakes were serious enough to
warrant the invalidation of that
section of the ballot.
One error on the ballot, however,
which involves the election of students
to the Student Conduct Legislative
Council (SCLC) violates a section of
the ASSU Constitution and will
probably result in the invalidation of
the votes for those positions.
These errors on the ballot only add
to the problems which have plagued
this election from the beginning. The
election was originally postponed for
one week due to confusion about what
was to be included in the ballot.
The ballot lists five people running
for three positions on the SCLC.
According to the Constitution, in cases
which call for the election of more

than one candidate for the same
office, the Hare system of
proportional representation, rather
than a raw vote system, must be used.
The ballot does not instruct people
to vote in order of preference, which is
necessary in the Hare system. It says
only to vote for three persons.
Candidates OK Vote
Lawson said he contacted each of
the five candidates for SCLC yesterday
and they all consented to being elected
by a raw vote system, instead of the
prescribed Hare system.
As of yesterday, Lawson also said
he had no plans to invalidate the SCLC
vote and re-run theu section on the

final ballot next week unless the vote
for the three positions is close.
However, ASSU President, Doug
McHenry said that Lawson's decision
not to invalidate the SCLC vote would
probably not stand. "Only theStudent
Senate can make a decision like that."
McHenry said he expects the Senate
to hold its regular meeting tomorrow
night.
Referenda Mistakes
The mistakes on the fee referenda
section of the ballot involve
distinctions between the fee requests
which include the negative option
clause and those which are
