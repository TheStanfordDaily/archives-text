# Ballot Errors, Heavy Voting Mark First Day Of Election
## 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
Several errors on the ballot and a
very heavy voter turnout marked the
first day of the problem-plagued ASSU
primary election. Voting ends today in
the election.
Two of the errors on the ballot are
technical mistakes involving the six
proposed fee assessments. The errors
make voting on the proposals
confusing but Elections Commissioner,
Johnny Lawson said he did not feel
the mistakes were serious enough to
warrant the invalidation of that
section of the ballot.
One error on the ballot, however,
which involves the election of students
to the Student Conduct Legislative
Council (SCLC) violates a section of
the ASSU Constitution and will
probably result in the invalidation of
the votes for those positions.
These errors on the ballot only add
to the problems which have plagued
this election from the beginning. The
election was originally postponed for
one week due to confusion about what
was to be included in the ballot.
The ballot lists five people running
for three positions on the SCLC.
According to the Constitution, in cases
which call for the election of more

than one candidate for the same
office, the Hare system of
proportional representation, rather
than a raw vote system, must be used.
The ballot does not instruct people
to vote in order of preference, which is
necessary in the Hare system. It says
only to vote for three persons.
Candidates OK Vote
Lawson said he contacted each of
the five candidates for SCLC yesterday
and they all consented to being elected
by a raw vote system, instead of the
prescribed Hare system.
As of yesterday, Lawson also said
he had no plans to invalidate the SCLC
vote and re-run theu section on the

final ballot next week unless the vote
for the three positions is close.
However, ASSU President, Doug
McHenry said that Lawson's decision
not to invalidate the SCLC vote would
probably not stand. "Only theStudent
Senate can make a decision like that."
McHenry said he expects the Senate
to hold its regular meeting tomorrow
night.
Referenda Mistakes
The mistakes on the fee referenda
section of the ballot involve
distinctions between the fee requests
which include the negative option
clause and those which are

non-refundable.
The titles of the three referenda
which include the negative option plan
should have been underlined on the
ballot, but are not.
Lawson said that since the text of
each fee referenda is included on the
ballot, a clear distinction between
refundable and non-refundable
assessments can be made and the error
therefore, presents no real problem.
There is also a confusing addition
to the ASSU Program Fee referendum.
At the end of that proposal's text, the
ballot lists not only the choice
between $0 and $1, but also the
choice between yes and no. The yes
and no, said Lawson, is extraneous,
and votes for yes or no will not be
counted.
This year's ballot contains one

other potential problem: none of the
ballots are numbered. Unmarked
ballots leave open the possibility that
fraudulent ballots will be turned in.
Lawson said he is aware of this
possibility, and said he plans to check
each ballot when they are counted.
Lawson also reported that the
Austria and Italy overseas campuses
wired that they had not received
ballots due to interruptions in the mail
systems in the two countries. Lawson
says he cabled the entire ballot to both
campuses yesterday, in order to
remedy the problem.
McHenry said yesterday that he
changed plans to have polling places in
some dorms after one presidential slate
expressed concern that dorm residents
would have an unfair advantage over
off-campus and fraternity students.

yesterday's voting. The election continues today.
non-refundable.
The titles of the three referenda
which include the negative option plan
should have been underlined on the
ballot, but are not.
Lawson said that since the text of
each fee referenda is included on the
ballot, a clear distinction between
refundable and non-refundable
assessments can be made and the error
therefore, presents no real problem.
There is also a confusing addition
to the ASSU Program Fee referendum.
At the end of that proposal's text, the
ballot lists not only the choice
between $0 and $1, but also the
choice between yes and no. The yes
and no, said Lawson, is extraneous,
and votes for yes or no will not be
counted.
This year's ballot contains one

other potential problem: none of the
ballots are numbered. Unmarked
ballots leave open the possibility that
fraudulent ballots will be turned in.
Lawson said he is aware of this
possibility, and said he plans to check
each ballot when they are counted.
Lawson also reported that the
Austria and Italy overseas campuses
wired that they had not received
ballots due to interruptions in the mail
systems in the two countries. Lawson
says he cabled the entire ballot to both
campuses yesterday, in order to
remedy the problem.
McHenry said yesterday that he
changed plans to have polling places in
some dorms after one presidential slate
expressed concern that dorm residents
would have an unfair advantage over
off-campus and fraternity students.
Several errors on the ballot and a
very heavy voter turnout marked the
first day of the problem-plagued ASSU
primary election. Voting ends today in
the election.
Two of the errors on the ballot are
technical mistakes involving the six
proposed fee assessments. The errors
make voting on the proposals
confusing but Elections Commissioner,
Johnny Lawson said he did not feel
the mistakes were serious enough to
warrant the invalidation of that
section of the ballot.
One error on the ballot, however,
which involves the election of students
to the Student Conduct Legislative
Council (SCLC) violates a section of
the ASSU Constitution and will
probably result in the invalidation of
the votes for those positions.
These errors on the ballot only add
to the problems which have plagued
this election from the beginning. The
election was originally postponed for
one week due to confusion about what
was to be included in the ballot.
The ballot lists five people running
for three positions on the SCLC.
According to the Constitution, in cases
which call for the election of more

than one candidate for the same
office, the Hare system of
proportional representation, rather
than a raw vote system, must be used.
The ballot does not instruct people
to vote in order of preference, which is
necessary in the Hare system. It says
only to vote for three persons.
Candidates OK Vote
Lawson said he contacted each of
the five candidates for SCLC yesterday
and they all consented to being elected
by a raw vote system, instead of the
prescribed Hare system.
As of yesterday, Lawson also said
he had no plans to invalidate the SCLC
vote and re-run theu section on the

final ballot next week unless the vote
for the three positions is close.
However, ASSU President, Doug
McHenry said that Lawson's decision
not to invalidate the SCLC vote would
probably not stand. "Only theStudent
Senate can make a decision like that."
McHenry said he expects the Senate
to hold its regular meeting tomorrow
night.
