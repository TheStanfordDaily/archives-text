Open Letter
(Editor's Note: The following is an open letter to Stanford students
from President Richard Lyman.)
To Stanford Students:
The Stanford Board of Trustees has approved the Campaign for
Stanford, a five-year program to raise $300,000,000. This is an
ambitious undertaking — apparently the largest of its kind ever set by
an American university. The dollar goal was settled upon after more
than two years of intensive analysis of Stanford's needs, the general
economic situation, and our gift potential. We are confident of
success.
I would like briefly to suggest that this development has a
relevance to the lives of students at Stanford.

First, to get at a question that is probably uppermost in many of
your minds, the campaign will not mean an end to tuition increases.
We do anticipate that increases will be smaller, approximately the
same as the annual, inflation-spurred rise in the cost of living.
Stanford tuition next year will still be about $150 below our Eastern
counterparts; and, as many of you know, tuition covers less than half
of the average cost of a Stanford education. Also, we have no plans
for increasing income from tuition by enlarging the student body.
There are several ways in which funds raised by the Campaign for
Stanford will benefit students directly, some in the near-term.
The whole development of student-initiated courses, for which
Stanford has become noted in the academic world, will be put on a
firmer footing and expanded.
The Campaign seeks $56,000,000 in endowment and expendable
funds for student aid — scholarships, fellowships, and loan funds. We
all gain when our student body is more diverse; we wish especially to
increase support for minority students at the graduate level.
Book collections will be increased and the single largest building
project will be for the new University Library.
New recreational and competitive athletic facilities will replace
some of our antiquated ones, and we will be able to proceed with at
least some of the ideas for undergraduate residences that are now
under study.
There are other examples, but I think the direct connection
between the Campaign and student should be clear. Because of it we
are pleased to have a group of student volunteers, headed by Robert
Ducommun, working with us.
In a way, money questions are always an intrusion upon the life of
an educational institution. But it is essential for us to resolve them so
thattheeducation offered here can continue to thrive and improve in
the years to come.
Richard W. Lyman
