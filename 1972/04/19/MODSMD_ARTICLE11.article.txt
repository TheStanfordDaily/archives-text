Waller Responds
Editor, THE DAILY;
It is necessary to publicly
correct some misinterpretations
which have arisen from the Daily's
Friday article on the
Barber-Fay-Cortez presidential
slate.
The article gives the impression
that Kathy Waller left the
Barber-Fay ticket primarily
because of a statement by Fay
about the tactics of certain black
student senators. That impression
is inaccurate. The statement itself
was only one of many factors
involved in her decision to leave
the ticket. Far more important
was her decision not to become
involved in the personal vendettas
which arise in campaigning for the
ASSU Presidency.
This type of political infighting
has long prevented the ASSU
from dealing effectively with
issues of student concern. Some
ASSU politicians have been so
interested in furthering only their
own personal careers that the
general student body has grown
cynical about the entire system.
