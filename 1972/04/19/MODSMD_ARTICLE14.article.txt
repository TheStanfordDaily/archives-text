# Unemployment Down
## Demands For Engineers Rising 
### 
Demand for engineering
graduates will increase very
sharply by 1975-76, according to
the School of Engineering and the
Career Planning and Placement
Center, with the job market
requiring about 42,000 new
engineers a year all during this
decade.
Reports of unemployment
among engineers during the last
four years have caused a sharp
drop ntionally in the number of
students studying for engineering
degrees.
Although engineering graduates
here have not met the job
resistance experienced at other
institutions during the past few
years, it appears that even more
recruiters will be courting
graduates during the next decade.
A 1 Kirkland, assistant dean of
the School of Engineering, said
the increase is expected regardless
of any drop in aerospace or
defense programs.
"We expect that more and
more graduates will enter the
environmental field," Kirkland
said. "Society is fully aware of

needs in relation to ecology, and
more engineers will be needed in
planning and building sewage
treatment and power plants,
transportation, and with other
expertise related to the
environment.
Excellent Background
"In addition," he said,
"engineering is an excellent
background for a student going
into law, medicine, business, and
education."
Kirkland says that Stanford
engineering graduates did not have
difficulty in obtaining jobs during
the employment slump of the past
four years because of this
flexibility and two other factors:
"First, the program always has
been regarded as being of the
highest caliber. Second, the record
of our graduates' work on the job
has encouraged industry to seek
additional Stanford engineers."
Enrollment Drop
The assistant dean said the
Univesity's peak in total
engineering enrollment at the
graduate and undergraduate levels
was 2,200 in 1965. The total

enrollment figure dropped to
1,950 in 1968, but it now has
increased to 2,000.
William L. Whitsett, assistant
director of the Placement Center,
echoed Kirkland's views, saying
that last year 125 students
received their B.S. degree in
engineering, 595 were awarded
the M.S., and 166 obtained
Ph.D.'s. About the same number
are expected this June.
These figures are unusual
because nationwide reports of
unemployment among engineers
have caused a sharp drop in the
number of engineering students.
Just a year ago, cutbacks in
aerospace and defense programs
produced 50,000 to 65,000
unemployed engineers.
At that time, then Dean Joseph
Pettit predicted a substantial
shortage of engineers by the end
of the 1970'5.
Adequate Supply
Adding substance to Pettit's
remarks, Dr. Frederick E. Terman,
emeritus provost and
vice-president of the University,
wrote in the July 1971 issue of

Science magazine: "The total
supply of scientists and engineers
with the B.S. ... seems to be
adequate for meeting the nation's
minimum needs, provided that
these individuals are appropriately
distributed among different fields.
"However, if the nation is to
have enough scientists and
engineers of good quality to meet
its basic needs, then a greater
proportion of these students
motivated to follow professional
careers in science and engineering
must continue their formal studies
to the master's level.
"While an engineer with a B.S.
can readily obtain employment at
a good initial salary (over $10,000
in 1970), he is not adequately
equipped to deal with the
technology of more interesting
and challenging contemporary
problems in engineering
development, design, and so on."
The School of Engineering is
making a concerted effort in the
latter fields by offering an
undergraduate and graduate level
program in environmental
engineering and design.

treatment and power plants,
transportation, and with other
expertise related to the
environment.
Excellent Background
"In addition," he said,
"engineering is an excellent
background for a student going
into law, medicine, business, and
education."
Kirkland says that Stanford
engineering graduates did not have
difficulty in obtaining jobs during
the employment slump of the past
four years because of this
flexibility and two other factors:
"First, the program always has
been regarded as being of the
highest caliber. Second, the record
of our graduates' work on the job
has encouraged industry to seek
additional Stanford engineers."
Enrollment Drop
The assistant dean said the
Univesity's peak in total
engineering enrollment at the
graduate and undergraduate levels
was 2,200 in 1965. The total

enrollment figure dropped to
1,950 in 1968, but it now has
increased to 2,000.
William L. Whitsett, assistant
director of the Placement Center,
echoed Kirkland's views, saying
that last year 125 students
received their B.S. degree in
engineering, 595 were awarded
the M.S., and 166 obtained
Ph.D.'s. About the same number
are expected this June.
These figures are unusual
because nationwide reports of
unemployment among engineers
have caused a sharp drop in the
number of engineering students.
Just a year ago, cutbacks in
aerospace and defense programs
produced 50,000 to 65,000
unemployed engineers.
At that time, then Dean Joseph
Pettit predicted a substantial
shortage of engineers by the end
of the 1970'5.
Adequate Supply
Adding substance to Pettit's
remarks, Dr. Frederick E. Terman,
emeritus provost and
vice-president of the University,
wrote in the July 1971 issue of

Science magazine: "The total
supply of scientists and engineers
with the B.S. ... seems to be
adequate for meeting the nation's
minimum needs, provided that
these individuals are appropriately
distributed among different fields.
"However, if the nation is to
have enough scientists and
engineers of good quality to meet
its basic needs, then a greater
proportion of these students
motivated to follow professional
careers in science and engineering
must continue their formal studies
to the master's level.
"While an engineer with a B.S.
can readily obtain employment at
a good initial salary (over $10,000
in 1970), he is not adequately
equipped to deal with the
technology of more interesting
and challenging contemporary
problems in engineering
development, design, and so on."
The School of Engineering is
making a concerted effort in the
latter fields by offering an
undergraduate and graduate level
program in environmental
engineering and design.
Demand for engineering
graduates will increase very
sharply by 1975-76, according to
the School of Engineering and the
Career Planning and Placement
Center, with the job market
requiring about 42,000 new
engineers a year all during this
decade.
Reports of unemployment
among engineers during the last
four years have caused a sharp
drop ntionally in the number of
students studying for engineering
degrees.
Although engineering graduates
here have not met the job
resistance experienced at other
institutions during the past few
years, it appears that even more
recruiters will be courting
graduates during the next decade.
A 1 Kirkland, assistant dean of
the School of Engineering, said
the increase is expected regardless
of any drop in aerospace or
defense programs.
"We expect that more and
more graduates will enter the
environmental field," Kirkland
said. "Society is fully aware of

needs in relation to ecology, and
more engineers will be needed in
planning and building sewage
treatment and power plants,
transportation, and with other
expertise related to the
environment.
