Japanese-Americans were
warned last weekend that they
may face the same "concentration
camps" their parents did in 1942.
These warnings were voiced by
four members of a panel which
concluded Stanford's two week
long Japanese Relocation
Symposium.
"Those of you who feel
accepted and inconspicuous in the
great American middle class, let
me assure you the security you
enjoy can be shattered overnight,"
stated Edison Uno of the
Japanese-American Citizens
League.
"What is happening today is
very similar to the hysteria and
hate accumulating in the war
clouds of 1942."
Uno also noted that the
constitutionality of Executive
Order 9066, which ordered the
forced relocation of West Coast
Japanese-Americans, was upheld
by the Supreme Court.
Another panelist, Pal Sumi,
advised third generation

Japanese-Americans not to
condemn the Nisei for failing to
fight the relocation before
examining the historical context
of the events.
Uno said the Japanese-
Americans cooperated with the
government because the only
alternative would have been a
bloodbath. Once in camp, many
Nisei volunteered to fight to prove
their loyalty to the United States.
