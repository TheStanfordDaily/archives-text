# Entertaining 'Carey Treatment'
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Blake Edwards' three most
recent films have all been playing
in the area over the past couple of
weeks and seeing them in quick
succession constituted a small but
highly pleasurable revelation. Just
when I thought that visual wit,
grace and sophistication had all
but disappeared from the
American cinema, I was reminded
that Edwards, over a career of
nineteen films in seventeen years,
has always been and still is one of
the most reliably entertaining
artists ever to have worked in
Hollywood.
Edwards has not enjoyed a
solid commercial and critical
success since "The Pink Panther"
and "A Shot in the Dark" in 1964
but, since he works as his own

producer, he has persisted in
making films on a yearly basis
which, if nothing else, have
confirmed his stature among
cultists and connoisseurs of
personal commercial cinema.
"Darling Lili," which went
appallingly over budget and nearly
sank the currently thriving
Paramount, was made on the crest
of big studio spending and must
unfortunately be classified as a
box-office catastrophe on the
level of "Star" and "Sweet
Charity." Actually, the film is
uncommonly personal for a
musical and constitutes a lovely
valentine to Julie Andrews.
During the first part of the film,
the star's primness and denial of
sexuality is as evident as ever but
in a marvellous scene half-way
through, Rock Hudson bluntly
accuses her of being a virgin and
presumably does something about
it. We instantly realize that the
joke had been on us all the time,
that Edwards is acutely aware of
his wife's screen image and is
more than willing to break it.
Marvel of Economy
"Wild Rovers" was Edwards'
first western and may be his most
impressive visual achievement.
However, as in his urban dramas
"Experiment in Terror" and
"Days of Wine and Roses," a few

too many sour notes are
introduced and sympathy for the
generally frolicsome William
Holden and Ryan O'Neal is
undercut at least once too often.
Again, Edwards went over
budget and perhaps in nasty
revenge, MGM allegedly interfered
with the director's own version of
his latest film, "The Carey
Treatment". This time, though,
there's no need to cry butcher,
since the finished film is
thoroughly satisfying and is a
minor marvel of economy.
Outside cutting may even have
eliminated the excesses of length
that have slightly marred
Edwards' two previous projects.
So much for speculation."The
Carey Treatment" concerns a
so-called swinging medic from
Palo Alto who moves to Boston
and a job that earns him in the
vicinity of $50,000 a year. The
hospital's top surgeon's daughter
dies from a careless abortion and a
resident Chinese doctor, a
convenient victim, is charged with
manslaughter. The tough Dr.
Carey spends the rest of the film
more private investigating than
doctoring in an attempt to clear
his friend of a crime he knows he
didn't commit.
Engaging Vignettes
Although the plot can be
followed reasonably and generates
adequate interest, by far more
engaging are individual vignettes
which have peripheral bearing on
the story but allow the actors and
director to excel by drawing on
their own charming
idiosyncracies. These vignettes
consist invariably of two-character
duels between James Coburn as
Dr. Carey and a tough adversary,
whether it be Elizabeth Allen in a
marvellous appearance as the head
surgeon's wife, Regis Toomey as
Coburn's superior in the hospital
lab, Alex Drier as a meticulous
gourmet cook, Michael Blodgett
as a sado-masochistic masseur or a
provocative teen-age actress who
at first marvellously conveys the
repression of a lonely Catholic girl
but then, under coercion from
Coburn, reveals the actual
depravity which lies immediately
below the surface.
Actually, the further removed
these incidents are from any close
relevance to the story, the more
charming they prove to be. Thus,
perhaps the least satisfactory
scene in the picture is devoted to
the sob-studded confession of the
murderer, while the most moving
scene is the very last one in which
James Coburn finally wins the
heart of Jennifer O'Neill with a

gesture that ought to prove
instructive to hesitant and shy
males everywhere.
Coburn looks better here than
ever before, capitalizes to the
utmost on his curious charm and,
in every way, is successful with a
role the way he hasn't been since
his supporting days in John
Sturges and Budd Boetticher
films. As for Jennifer O'Neill, I
suppose there are just so many
times she can be called one of the
most impossibly beautiful girls on
the screen today. In this film, she
even reveals quite a few
prematurely gray hairs, which,
frankly, intensify her allure. As
Catherine Deneuve told Belmondo
in "Mississippi Mermaid," men
can be additionally attractive as
they begin to grow bald. I'm sure
it's a variation on this sentiment
that makes Jennifer more
beautiful in "The Carey
Treatment" than in any of her
previous films. In the final scene,
she is, for the first time in her
career, called upon to act and she
rises to the occasion splendidly.
James Bonner's terse, funny
screenplay is based on a book
which, I'm told, may be one of
many which Michael Crichton
wrote under a pseudonymn.
Throughout, Edwards direction
could most easily be called very
slick but there is a method to his
extreme professionalism.
Edwards' many camera
movements are more graceful and
purposefully used than Kubrick's
and, through his confidence in his
actors and genial irrelevancies,
Edwards proves once again that he
knows what good movie-making is
all about.
Playing with "Darling Lili" at
the Varsity is Bryan Forbes' latest
film, "Long Ago, Tomorrow."
The film's subject, that of a love
story between paraplegics, is
really not as depressing as it
sounds and the convincing and
spirited acting of Malcolm
McDowell and Nanette Newman
in the film's middle section make
the emotions real and extremely
sympathetic.
Forbes' screenplay is, as usual,
quite sound, although his
direction is occasionally sloppy
and nowhere more so than in the
film's silent final minutes. It is
when Forbes opts for reliance on
the image instead of the words he
uses so well that his work falls
somewhat flat, denying the film a
final emotional thrust that might
have made it more than of
moderate interest.

along the Charles River in Boston and, thank God, Erich Segal and
Francis Lai are nowhere in sight. Coburn has come all the way from
Palo Alto to capture Jennifer's heart in "The Carey Treatment," Blake
Edwards' highly engaging sophisticated thriller which is currently
making the rounds.
