# Sailing In Season Finale
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity sailing team
can capture the Northern
California Intercollegiate Yacht
Racing Association's 1971-72
small boat series by winning two
out of four races in the final
regatta of the season this
weekend.
The regatta, to be sailed on San
Francisco bay, is sponsored by the
California Maritime Academy.
Nine schools from northern
California will participate
including such sailing powers as
U.C. Davis, U.C. Santa Cruz, and
Berkeley.
Last year's champion, the
College of Alameda, is expected
to give the Stanford team its
hardest competition. After 38
races completed this season
Stanford and Alameda are within
a quarter point followed far
behind by San Jose State.
The NCIYRA series is sailed in
13 foot Hying junior class sloops
raced with a crew of two.
Throughout the series the courses
have ranged from Olympic size of
about three miles to shorter
courses of a mile. Wind conditions
have been equally as variable,
from zephyrs to gales.
"It's going to blow like hell
this weekend and that will make it
harder for us," says Susie
Salisbury, a team skipper. "We
usually do our best in light air.
Alameda has the advantage in
hard wind because they've got the
heavy team members with the
beer bellies to help keep their
boats from going over," she adds.
Ben Fisher, another flying
junior skipper believes "we're so
close that the last race will
probably determine the
champion. You can bet we're
going all out to win it. After all,

Stanford hasn't had the title for
over seven years."
Regardless of the outcome of
the flying junior series, Stanford
has clinched this season's
NCIYRA's large boat series.
Though not yet as extensive as the
small boat program, the sailing
team is building an active program
in intercollegiate keel boat racing.
Currently Stanford's team
races in 30 foot shields class
sloops on San Francisco and
Monterey bays. Stanford amassed
a commanding lead in the shields
division primarily through the
expert helmsmanship of Jeff
Justice. Stanford will defend their
league lead on April 28 and 29
against a strong field of
contenders. In addition to all the
NCIYRA competition, Stanford
has challenged, USC, UCLA, U.C.
San Diego, U.C. Irvine, and
Pomona in this final shields
regatta of the season.

Justice feels that "we have the
personnel and the strategy to
sweep the series and bring the
division title to Stanford, but it
won't be easy. USC and UCLA are
ranked among the top ten sailing
teams in the nation."
"We've undergone a major
re-organization this year," says
team captain Peter Bohr. "We've
added more team members,
participated in more races, and
most important, we've received
varsity status from the
Department of Athletics.
"Next season we have plans to
attend the Douglas Cup, the Sugar
Bowl, as well as the Kennedy
Cup," says Bohr.
The Kennedy Cup is
intercollegiate sailing's most
prestigious event. The regatta is
sailed at Annapolis, Maryland in
44 foot yawls. Stanford has won
the Kennedy Cup twice in the last
four years.

GETTING READY—Members of the Stanford sailing team in boat number 4225 jockey into position at
the start of a recent Northern California Intercollegiate Yacht Racing Association Shields class race on San „
Francisco Bay.
Stanford's varsity sailing team
can capture the Northern
California Intercollegiate Yacht
Racing Association's 1971-72
small boat series by winning two
out of four races in the final
regatta of the season this
weekend.
The regatta, to be sailed on San
Francisco bay, is sponsored by the
California Maritime Academy.
Nine schools from northern
California will participate
including such sailing powers as
U.C. Davis, U.C. Santa Cruz, and
Berkeley.
Last year's champion, the
College of Alameda, is expected
to give the Stanford team its
hardest competition. After 38
races completed this season
Stanford and Alameda are within
a quarter point followed far
behind by San Jose State.
The NCIYRA series is sailed in
13 foot Hying junior class sloops
raced with a crew of two.
Throughout the series the courses
have ranged from Olympic size of
about three miles to shorter
courses of a mile. Wind conditions
have been equally as variable,
from zephyrs to gales.
"It's going to blow like hell
this weekend and that will make it
harder for us," says Susie
Salisbury, a team skipper. "We
usually do our best in light air.
Alameda has the advantage in
hard wind because they've got the
heavy team members with the
beer bellies to help keep their
boats from going over," she adds.
Ben Fisher, another flying
junior skipper believes "we're so
close that the last race will
probably determine the
champion. You can bet we're
going all out to win it. After all,

Stanford hasn't had the title for
over seven years."
Regardless of the outcome of
the flying junior series, Stanford
has clinched this season's
NCIYRA's large boat series.
Though not yet as extensive as the
small boat program, the sailing
team is building an active program
in intercollegiate keel boat racing.
Currently Stanford's team
races in 30 foot shields class
sloops on San Francisco and
Monterey bays. Stanford amassed
a commanding lead in the shields
division primarily through the
expert helmsmanship of Jeff
Justice. Stanford will defend their
league lead on April 28 and 29
against a strong field of
contenders. In addition to all the
NCIYRA competition, Stanford
has challenged, USC, UCLA, U.C.
San Diego, U.C. Irvine, and
Pomona in this final shields
regatta of the season.

Justice feels that "we have the
personnel and the strategy to
sweep the series and bring the
division title to Stanford, but it
won't be easy. USC and UCLA are
ranked among the top ten sailing
teams in the nation."
"We've undergone a major
re-organization this year," says
team captain Peter Bohr. "We've
added more team members,
participated in more races, and
most important, we've received
varsity status from the
Department of Athletics.
"Next season we have plans to
attend the Douglas Cup, the Sugar
Bowl, as well as the Kennedy
Cup," says Bohr.
The Kennedy Cup is
intercollegiate sailing's most
prestigious event. The regatta is
sailed at Annapolis, Maryland in
44 foot yawls. Stanford has won
the Kennedy Cup twice in the last
four years.
