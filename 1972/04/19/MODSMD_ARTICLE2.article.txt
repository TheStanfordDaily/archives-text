# Forced Out?
## Business Manager Leaves TMU 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Philip Duffy, business manager of
debt-ridden Tresidder Memorial
Union, will leave his post in the near
future, the Daily has learned.
According to Acting Dean of

Students Robert Freelen, Duffy asked
to be relieved of his duties. However,
several informed sources claim that
Duffy was forced out of the Union's
number two job.
Both Duffy and Union Director
Forrest Tregea have long been the
targets for accusations of
mismanagement. An ASSU report
issued last year blamed them for the
Union's sizable financial problems,
while a study ordered by the
University Internal Audit Office last
summer stopped just short of calling
for their outright dismissal.
Both Duffy and Tregea refused to
discuss the matter with the Daily.
Sources predicted some six weeks
ago that Duffy would not last out the
academic year at TMU. Those same
sources claimed that Tregea himself
would be dismissed within six months.
No Changes Contemplated
On March 2, Freelen told the Daily
that no changes in TMU were being
contemplated beyond the hiring of a

new food services director to replace
the fired Lee Schaefer. Howard
Marquis has since been hired to fill the
vacancy.
The Stanford Personnel Office says
it has been advertising for applicants
for Duffy's job "for at least three
weeks to a month." Monday,
Freelen admitted that he had hr.O
indications "for some time before
that" that Duffy would be leaving the
TMU position.
However, Freelen claimed that the
decision to quit was Duffy's, and told
the Daily that "all this developed after
I talked with you [on March 2]."
He said that Duffy "had looked at
several other jobs within the
University that he was interested in,"
and decided to quit his Tresidder job.
Sources said Sunday and Monday,
however, that Duffy would instead
retire completely from the University,
and would be granted a generous
pension.
Freelen said that Duffy "hasn't

really given us a definite date" when
his resignation will be effective. One
TMU observor claimed that he was
given four to six weeks advance notice
of the decision to relieve him, while
another said that he was given a month
to decide whether he wished to look
for another job or to retire.
Freelen said he and Tregea had
discussed Duffy's decision with him
after learning of it, but that "we
talked very generally about Phil's
future, and no specific detail?, were
discussed."
Some 12 persons have applied for
the newly-restructured position of
TMU financial manager, says F/eelen
(Duffy's title was business manager).
Of the 12, the most likely successor
may be Gordon Starr, a financial
analyst in the University Comptroller's
Office, who is in thy process of
completing an audit of the debt-ridden
Union. Preliminary figures from his
report which showed a deficit of some
