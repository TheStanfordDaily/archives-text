# Goes All Out
## Arvid Kretzâ€”A Real Competitor 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
Track and Field News listed Arvid Kretz as one of the top
three-milers in the country last year. Despite running behind people of
such caliber as Oregon's Steve Prefontaine and Stanford's own Don
Kardong, he managed to take fourth in the Pac-8 Championships last
year. Although he was disappointed by not placing in the NCAA
meet, he came back this year ready to try again.
Physically, he doesn't strike one as a champion athlete. He is 5'9"
and 125 lbs. The coaches call him "the monster." "You should have
seen me before I filled out." When he puts on his glasses he looks
more like a music major than a runner.
Arvid grew up back east, but moved to California when he was in
eighth grade. He didn't start track until his freshman year at Mills
High School in Millbrae. He tried distance running because, "the only
thing I was good at in gym class was running laps."
He was not exactly an instant success. It wasn't until his senior
year that he became a force to be reckoned with. That year he ran a
9:11 and received national recognition, although he only placed sixth
in the state meet.
Kretz was offered scholarships by other schools, but came to
Stanford even though he wasn't offered one here. "My parents wanted
me to get the best education possible, and they were willing to pay
the difference."
He has run cross-country and track here for four years now. Of the
two sports, he likes track better. "You get more of a feeling of
competition in track." Competition is nothing new to Arvid. He has
been running in the shadows of Duncan Mac Donald and Don Kardong
for the past three years. This year, it's his turn to lead the Stanford
pack.
His first two years here he did well, but nothing spectacular. It was
during his junior year that he really came into his own. He clocked a
4:07.0 mile in a time trial early in the year. Later on, he ran an 8:49
two mile. In the dual meet against Oregon, a team famous for its
distance runners, he ran the 13:32 three mile which gave him national
recognition. At the end of the season, he was named Northern
California Track Athlete of the Year by the Northern California Track
and Field Association.
He had a disappointing cross-country season this year, but was in
good shape just before track season started. Before the opening meet
against Fresno, however, he injured his ankle and had to scratch the
meet. He was running again against Occidental and won there, but his
injury still bothered him.
On April 8 against USC, he was one of only two event winners for
Stanford. His victory came in the two mile with a season's best of
8:58.4.
The ankle injury this season is just one more obstacle in the
running career of Arvid Kretz. The last few years setbacks for Kretz
have occurred with astounding regularity. "I always seem to be sick
and injured at key times." After awhile, this would discourage most
people, but not Arvid.
His tenacity lies in his deep religious confictions. "I think the

reasons I run are different from the reasons most people run. I run to
display and reflect the character of my Lord, Jesus Christ. I want t<
emphasize this ... my body is not mine, but God's."
When he first started, he was not as sincere about his running as he
is now. "I ran in high school out of selfish ambition. I wanted to make
friends and impress other people. During my senior year I had plenty
of friends and a steady girl, but there didn't seem to be a purpose to
any of it I thought about it a lot and one day just asked Christ to
come and take over my life."
Arvid says he realizes that there are many times when he doesn't
live up to these high ideals. "Sometimes 1 get discouraged when I'm
sick or injured, but Christ gives me the ability to hang in there. He
gives me the willingness to work hard and encourage my team mates."
There are times when he feels inadequate as messenger of Christ.
"Sometimes 1 cop out and don't explain my purposes for running."
This summer, however, he plans to go over to Africa and share Jesus
with the people over there. He is going as part of a group of Christian
athletes who will compete against the Olympic teams of some of the
African nations.
Besides track and his religious work, Arvid spends his time getting
through school as a music major, though he doesn't really know what
he's going to do with the degree once he graduates. He is an
accomplished saxophone player and has played with the wind
ensemble here for the past few years.
Coach Payton Jordan has nothing but praise for Kretz. "He's a real
team man and a fierce competitor." Jordan adds, "When he has a
suggestion that he thinks will help the team, or if he thinks he has a
reason to criticize us, he'll come out and say so with respect. I admire
him for that."
Coach Marshall Clark handles the distance runners and has gotten
to know Kretz fairly well in the past few years. "He's undoubtedly
one of the best competitors we've had at Stanford. He doesn't have
the strength or speed. His greatest asset is to meet the challenge. His
smoothness and carriage are also great assets. There's no lost motion
when he runs."
Kretz has no complaints about the coaches either. "They hung in
there with me even when I was hurt... 1 really appreciated that." He
thinks the team will finish the season well this year. "They are getting
together because the coaches really care."
There are still two more dual meets left in the season, and then the
Pac-8 Championships. If his ankle is well by then, Arvid should do
better than his fourth place last year. "If he's running at his best,"
said Clark, "he should be in the top three in the Pac-8 three mile." His
opponents include NCAA champion Steve Prefontaine and Randy
James from Oregon, Mark Heifield and Danny Murphy from WSU,
and Ron Johnson of UCLA.
For the NCAA meet, Clark hopes to run Kretz in the six mile. The
qualifying time is 29:15, and Arvid ran better than that last year.
One of his fellow runners remarked, "Arvid does the best he can
with what he has. He's not that fast, but he puts out 100 percent all
the time, and that's what makes him a champion."

High School in Millbrae. He tried distance running because, "the only
thing I was good at in gym class was running laps."
He was not exactly an instant success. It wasn't until his senior
year that he became a force to be reckoned with. That year he ran a
9:11 and received national recognition, although he only placed sixth
in the state meet.
Kretz was offered scholarships by other schools, but came to
Stanford even though he wasn't offered one here. "My parents wanted
me to get the best education possible, and they were willing to pay
the difference."
He has run cross-country and track here for four years now. Of the
two sports, he likes track better. "You get more of a feeling of
competition in track." Competition is nothing new to Arvid. He has
been running in the shadows of Duncan Mac Donald and Don Kardong
for the past three years. This year, it's his turn to lead the Stanford
pack.
His first two years here he did well, but nothing spectacular. It was
during his junior year that he really came into his own. He clocked a
4:07.0 mile in a time trial early in the year. Later on, he ran an 8:49
two mile. In the dual meet against Oregon, a team famous for its
distance runners, he ran the 13:32 three mile which gave him national
recognition. At the end of the season, he was named Northern
California Track Athlete of the Year by the Northern California Track
and Field Association.
He had a disappointing cross-country season this year, but was in
good shape just before track season started. Before the opening meet
against Fresno, however, he injured his ankle and had to scratch the
meet. He was running again against Occidental and won there, but his
injury still bothered him.
On April 8 against USC, he was one of only two event winners for
Stanford. His victory came in the two mile with a season's best of
8:58.4.
The ankle injury this season is just one more obstacle in the
running career of Arvid Kretz. The last few years setbacks for Kretz
have occurred with astounding regularity. "I always seem to be sick
and injured at key times." After awhile, this would discourage most
people, but not Arvid.
His tenacity lies in his deep religious confictions. "I think the

reasons I run are different from the reasons most people run. I run to
display and reflect the character of my Lord, Jesus Christ. I want t<
emphasize this ... my body is not mine, but God's."
When he first started, he was not as sincere about his running as he
is now. "I ran in high school out of selfish ambition. I wanted to make
friends and impress other people. During my senior year I had plenty
of friends and a steady girl, but there didn't seem to be a purpose to
any of it I thought about it a lot and one day just asked Christ to
come and take over my life."
Arvid says he realizes that there are many times when he doesn't
live up to these high ideals. "Sometimes 1 get discouraged when I'm
sick or injured, but Christ gives me the ability to hang in there. He
gives me the willingness to work hard and encourage my team mates."
There are times when he feels inadequate as messenger of Christ.
"Sometimes 1 cop out and don't explain my purposes for running."
This summer, however, he plans to go over to Africa and share Jesus
with the people over there. He is going as part of a group of Christian
athletes who will compete against the Olympic teams of some of the
African nations.
Besides track and his religious work, Arvid spends his time getting
through school as a music major, though he doesn't really know what
he's going to do with the degree once he graduates. He is an
accomplished saxophone player and has played with the wind
ensemble here for the past few years.
Coach Payton Jordan has nothing but praise for Kretz. "He's a real
team man and a fierce competitor." Jordan adds, "When he has a
suggestion that he thinks will help the team, or if he thinks he has a
reason to criticize us, he'll come out and say so with respect. I admire
him for that."
Coach Marshall Clark handles the distance runners and has gotten
to know Kretz fairly well in the past few years. "He's undoubtedly
one of the best competitors we've had at Stanford. He doesn't have
the strength or speed. His greatest asset is to meet the challenge. His
smoothness and carriage are also great assets. There's no lost motion
when he runs."
Kretz has no complaints about the coaches either. "They hung in
there with me even when I was hurt... 1 really appreciated that." He
thinks the team will finish the season well this year. "They are getting
together because the coaches really care."
There are still two more dual meets left in the season, and then the
Pac-8 Championships. If his ankle is well by then, Arvid should do
better than his fourth place last year. "If he's running at his best,"
said Clark, "he should be in the top three in the Pac-8 three mile." His
opponents include NCAA champion Steve Prefontaine and Randy
James from Oregon, Mark Heifield and Danny Murphy from WSU,
and Ron Johnson of UCLA.
For the NCAA meet, Clark hopes to run Kretz in the six mile. The
qualifying time is 29:15, and Arvid ran better than that last year.
One of his fellow runners remarked, "Arvid does the best he can
with what he has. He's not that fast, but he puts out 100 percent all
the time, and that's what makes him a champion."
Track and Field News listed Arvid Kretz as one of the top
three-milers in the country last year. Despite running behind people of
such caliber as Oregon's Steve Prefontaine and Stanford's own Don
Kardong, he managed to take fourth in the Pac-8 Championships last
year. Although he was disappointed by not placing in the NCAA
meet, he came back this year ready to try again.
Physically, he doesn't strike one as a champion athlete. He is 5'9"
and 125 lbs. The coaches call him "the monster." "You should have
seen me before I filled out." When he puts on his glasses he looks
more like a music major than a runner.

for the past three years. This year, it's his turn to lead the Stanford
pack.
His first two years here he did well, but nothing spectacular. It was
during his junior year that he really came into his own. He clocked a
4:07.0 mile in a time trial early in the year. Later on, he ran an 8:49
two mile. In the dual meet against Oregon, a team famous for its
distance runners, he ran the 13:32 three mile which gave him national
recognition. At the end of the season, he was named Northern
California Track Athlete of the Year by the Northern California Track
and Field Association.
He had a disappointing cross-country season this year, but was in
good shape just before track season started. Before the opening meet
against Fresno, however, he injured his ankle and had to scratch the
meet. He was running again against Occidental and won there, but his
injury still bothered him.
On April 8 against USC, he was one of only two event winners for
Stanford. His victory came in the two mile with a season's best of
8:58.4.
The ankle injury this season is just one more obstacle in the
running career of Arvid Kretz. The last few years setbacks for Kretz
have occurred with astounding regularity. "I always seem to be sick
and injured at key times." After awhile, this would discourage most
people, but not Arvid.
His tenacity lies in his deep religious confictions. "I think the

reasons I run are different from the reasons most people run. I run to
display and reflect the character of my Lord, Jesus Christ. I want t<
emphasize this ... my body is not mine, but God's."
When he first started, he was not as sincere about his running as he
is now. "I ran in high school out of selfish ambition. I wanted to make
friends and impress other people. During my senior year I had plenty
of friends and a steady girl, but there didn't seem to be a purpose to
any of it I thought about it a lot and one day just asked Christ to
come and take over my life."
Arvid says he realizes that there are many times when he doesn't
live up to these high ideals. "Sometimes 1 get discouraged when I'm
sick or injured, but Christ gives me the ability to hang in there. He
gives me the willingness to work hard and encourage my team mates."
There are times when he feels inadequate as messenger of Christ.
"Sometimes 1 cop out and don't explain my purposes for running."
This summer, however, he plans to go over to Africa and share Jesus
with the people over there. He is going as part of a group of Christian
athletes who will compete against the Olympic teams of some of the
African nations.
Besides track and his religious work, Arvid spends his time getting
through school as a music major, though he doesn't really know what
he's going to do with the degree once he graduates. He is an
accomplished saxophone player and has played with the wind
ensemble here for the past few years.
Coach Payton Jordan has nothing but praise for Kretz. "He's a real
team man and a fierce competitor." Jordan adds, "When he has a
suggestion that he thinks will help the team, or if he thinks he has a
reason to criticize us, he'll come out and say so with respect. I admire
him for that."
Coach Marshall Clark handles the distance runners and has gotten
to know Kretz fairly well in the past few years. "He's undoubtedly
one of the best competitors we've had at Stanford. He doesn't have
the strength or speed. His greatest asset is to meet the challenge. His
smoothness and carriage are also great assets. There's no lost motion
when he runs."
Kretz has no complaints about the coaches either. "They hung in
there with me even when I was hurt... 1 really appreciated that." He
thinks the team will finish the season well this year. "They are getting
together because the coaches really care."
There are still two more dual meets left in the season, and then the
Pac-8 Championships. If his ankle is well by then, Arvid should do
better than his fourth place last year. "If he's running at his best,"
said Clark, "he should be in the top three in the Pac-8 three mile." His
opponents include NCAA champion Steve Prefontaine and Randy
James from Oregon, Mark Heifield and Danny Murphy from WSU,
and Ron Johnson of UCLA.
For the NCAA meet, Clark hopes to run Kretz in the six mile. The
qualifying time is 29:15, and Arvid ran better than that last year.
One of his fellow runners remarked, "Arvid does the best he can
with what he has. He's not that fast, but he puts out 100 percent all
the time, and that's what makes him a champion."
Track and Field News listed Arvid Kretz as one of the top
three-milers in the country last year. Despite running behind people of
such caliber as Oregon's Steve Prefontaine and Stanford's own Don
Kardong, he managed to take fourth in the Pac-8 Championships last
year. Although he was disappointed by not placing in the NCAA
meet, he came back this year ready to try again.
Physically, he doesn't strike one as a champion athlete. He is 5'9"
and 125 lbs. The coaches call him "the monster." "You should have
seen me before I filled out." When he puts on his glasses he looks
more like a music major than a runner.
Arvid grew up back east, but moved to California when he was in
eighth grade. He didn't start track until his freshman year at Mills
High School in Millbrae. He tried distance running because, "the only
thing I was good at in gym class was running laps."
He was not exactly an instant success. It wasn't until his senior
year that he became a force to be reckoned with. That year he ran a
9:11 and received national recognition, although he only placed sixth
in the state meet.
Kretz was offered scholarships by other schools, but came to
Stanford even though he wasn't offered one here. "My parents wanted
me to get the best education possible, and they were willing to pay
the difference."
He has run cross-country and track here for four years now. Of the
two sports, he likes track better. "You get more of a feeling of
competition in track." Competition is nothing new to Arvid. He has
been running in the shadows of Duncan Mac Donald and Don Kardong
for the past three years. This year, it's his turn to lead the Stanford
pack.
