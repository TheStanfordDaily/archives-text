Davis Letters Presented
SAN JOSE — Three "Dear George" letters allegedly
written by Angela Davis to convict George Jackson were
introduced at her trial yesterday as the state sought to
link her to the Marin County Courthouse escape plot.
Jurors were kept out of the courtroom while defense
attorneys fought admission of the so-called love letters
into evidence. They sought to prove through questioning
of an FBI agent who found the letters that they were
illegally seized from Miss Davis' Los Angeles apartment in
August, 1970.
Asst. Atty. Gen. Alert Harris marked as exhibits the
three letters—all addressed "Dear George." Two were
signed "Angela," and one was unsigned but handwritten
in red ink on yellow notebook paper. He also presented
search warrants issued when Miss Davis was sought by the
FBI on a charge of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.
"What we were looking for and what we found might
have been two different things," he said. ".. . it was a
very comprehensive search."
The introduction of the letters came at the start of the
prosecution's efforts to link Miss Davis to a Marin County
courthouse shootout which claimed four lives.
Aide To Testify On ITT
WASHINGTON — Presidential assistant Peter M. Flanigan
offered yesterday to give limited testimony to the Senate
Judiciary- Committee in its ITT inquiry, apparently
removing a roadblock to confirmation of Richard G.
Kleindienst as attorney general.
But a White House spokesman promptly cautioned the
committee against trying to carry questioning beyond
limits set by Flanigan, indicating this could lead President
Nixon to invoke the doctrine of executive privilege and
cut off his aide's testimony.
Asked at a news briefing what would happen if some
committee members should attempt to broaden their
questioning, White House press secretary Ronald L.

Ziegler replied, "We assume they're all gentlemen and
would abide by" the terms of Flanigan's offer to testify
solely about two matters related to the International
Telephone & Telegraph Corp.
In the letter, Flanigan said he would talk willingly
about how he arranged for preparation of a key financial
analysis which Justice Department officials say played a
major role in their decision not to carry the ITT cases to
the Supreme Court.
Flanigan said he would discuss also a meeting he
attended with a number of businessmen including ITT
president Harold S. Geneen where administration policies
were generally discussed.
Apollo Nears Moon
SPACE CENTER, Houston — Apollo 16 astronauts
heading toward a moon landing worked with ground
controllers yesterday and overcame a guidance problem
that briefly froze their spaceship in one position and an
antenna problem that affected radio communications.
Astronauts John W. Young and Charles M. Duke Jr.
will guide the lunar lander, Orion, to a landing on a
crater-scarred volcanic plateau high in the southern
mountains of the moon tomorrow. Touchdown is
scheduled for 12:41 p.m. PST.
They are to be the ninth and tenth Americans to walk
on the moon and the only ones ticketed to land in the
mountainous highlands.
Marijuana Bill Passed
SACRAMENTO — A key Assembly committee passed a
bill yesterday making mere possession of marijuana no
longer a felony but a misdemeanor. It killed a broader
measure completely legalizing possession.

Aide To Testify On ITT
WASHINGTON — Presidential assistant Peter M. Flanigan
offered yesterday to give limited testimony to the Senate
Judiciary- Committee in its ITT inquiry, apparently
removing a roadblock to confirmation of Richard G.
Kleindienst as attorney general.
But a White House spokesman promptly cautioned the
committee against trying to carry questioning beyond
limits set by Flanigan, indicating this could lead President
Nixon to invoke the doctrine of executive privilege and
cut off his aide's testimony.
Asked at a news briefing what would happen if some
committee members should attempt to broaden their
questioning, White House press secretary Ronald L.

Ziegler replied, "We assume they're all gentlemen and
would abide by" the terms of Flanigan's offer to testify
solely about two matters related to the International
Telephone & Telegraph Corp.
In the letter, Flanigan said he would talk willingly
about how he arranged for preparation of a key financial
analysis which Justice Department officials say played a
major role in their decision not to carry the ITT cases to
the Supreme Court.
Flanigan said he would discuss also a meeting he
attended with a number of businessmen including ITT
president Harold S. Geneen where administration policies
were generally discussed.
Apollo Nears Moon
SPACE CENTER, Houston — Apollo 16 astronauts
heading toward a moon landing worked with ground
controllers yesterday and overcame a guidance problem
that briefly froze their spaceship in one position and an
antenna problem that affected radio communications.
Astronauts John W. Young and Charles M. Duke Jr.
will guide the lunar lander, Orion, to a landing on a
crater-scarred volcanic plateau high in the southern
mountains of the moon tomorrow. Touchdown is
scheduled for 12:41 p.m. PST.
They are to be the ninth and tenth Americans to walk
on the moon and the only ones ticketed to land in the
mountainous highlands.
Marijuana Bill Passed
SACRAMENTO — A key Assembly committee passed a
bill yesterday making mere possession of marijuana no
longer a felony but a misdemeanor. It killed a broader
measure completely legalizing possession.

Davis Letters Presented
SAN JOSE — Three "Dear George" letters allegedly
written by Angela Davis to convict George Jackson were
introduced at her trial yesterday as the state sought to
link her to the Marin County Courthouse escape plot.
Jurors were kept out of the courtroom while defense
attorneys fought admission of the so-called love letters
into evidence. They sought to prove through questioning
of an FBI agent who found the letters that they were
illegally seized from Miss Davis' Los Angeles apartment in
August, 1970.
Asst. Atty. Gen. Alert Harris marked as exhibits the
three letters—all addressed "Dear George." Two were
signed "Angela," and one was unsigned but handwritten
in red ink on yellow notebook paper. He also presented
search warrants issued when Miss Davis was sought by the
FBI on a charge of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.
"What we were looking for and what we found might
have been two different things," he said. ".. . it was a
very comprehensive search."
The introduction of the letters came at the start of the
prosecution's efforts to link Miss Davis to a Marin County
courthouse shootout which claimed four lives.
