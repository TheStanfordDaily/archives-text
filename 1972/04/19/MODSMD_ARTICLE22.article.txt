# Radicals Finish Poorly
## Vian Wins School Board Vote 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Attorney Theodore Vian, a graduate of Stanford Law
School, easily won the election to the Palo Alto Unified
School District Board of Trustees yesterday with a
convincing 45 percent of the vote.
Housewife Sally Siegel ran a poor second, polling 21
percent of the vote.
With all precincts reporting, the final election returns
show:
Theodore Vian 4,705 45%
Sally Siegel 2,134 21%
Virginia Williams 1,371 13%
Eleanor Kraft 1,311 13%
Doug Garrett 602 6%
Gregory Kerber 183 2%
Vian said he was "very satisfied" that the margin of
victory "came out as high as it did."
Williams, considered the only conservative in the race,
announced she was "disappointed." She said that electing
Vian is "just like putting Dr. Santee on the board." Dr.
Harold Santee is the Palo Alto School Superintendent.
Garrett, the Venceremos candidate, commented on his

poor showing that he was "sure" the results would have
been different had Palo Alto students been eligible to
vote. He cited a recent straw election held at Gunn High
School in which he received 47 percent of the vote with
Kerber, considered the other radical 'n the race, receiving
32 percent.
Kraft stated that she was not surprised by Vian's
victory. She claimed that she "expected" Vian to win
because "he had the financial backing" plus the support
of the "establishment of Palo Alto and the Palo Alto
Times. It's hard to beat the establishment," she
commented.
Kraft said the small vote for Garrett "surprises" her.
"It means the young people could care less," she asserted.
She said the most "discouraging" aspect of the election
was the small turnout of only 10,000 voters.
Kerber felt "not much is going to change" as a result of
Vian's election, and contended that if things continue as
they are in the Palo Alto school system, "kids are going to
get more pissed off." He felt that "in the
future ... people with our views" will get an increasingly
large number of votes.
