# Lyman Writes Nixon, Protests Viet Bombing; Opposes Strike
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
President Richard Lyman has once
again written President Richard Nixon
urging an end to all U.S. involvement
in the Indochina War.
The letter, which Lyman read at
the opening of a KZSU press
conference yesterday, condemned the
current escalation in bombing as "a
return to the discredited policies of
the 1966-67 period. Massive bombing
from the air," wrote Lyman, "only
reinforces the will to win of the enemy
against whom it is practiced."
During the conference, Lyman
strongly condemned Monday night's
window-breaking by 250 protesting
the Vietnam bombing. "It drowns out
the potential voice of mass protest and
diminishes the voice of all University
people, including people writing the
President," he said. "The issue
becomes campus vandalism instead of
the bombing and the escalation of the
war," Lyman argued.
Lyman also seemed to discourage a
student strike as a means of protest.
He took issue with a Harvard Crimson
editorial which proposed "a strike
against the war, not against the
University."
Shutdown Effects
"If the word strike is meant in the
labor sense of a shutdown, it cannot
help but be against the University,"
Lyman stated. "A shutdown costs the
University hundreds of thousands of
dollars for every day it is closed."
However, Lyman encouraged
political action by students to protest
the bombing. "It is silly to say there is
nothing we can do against the war
politically when, less than two months
away, we have in our state what is held
by all accounts to be the most
influential presidential primary," he
said.
"If people want to do something
against the war," Lyman continued,
"there is no lack of opportunity at this
time in the history of California and
the nation."
The argument that peace candidates
elected in 1964 and 1968 did not end
the war is invalid, according to Lyman.
"We haven't had peace candidates in
the past in the same sense as we do
now," he noted.
In concluding his comments on war
protest, Lyman remarked, "Unless
you're convinced that there is no
alternative to a violent revolution
which would overthrow the system in
its entirety, I can't find much
credibility in the argument that we're

not going to work within the system."
Turning to the upcoming NLRB
election, Lyman stated that he "had
nothing to do" with the University
sponsored advertisement which
attacked alleged inaccuracies in a
Teamsters pamphlet. "I did not dream
it up and did not see it before it
appeared," he added.
But Lyman defended the right of
the University to counter "flat
mistatements of fact" made by the

Union.
Lyman sought to discredit
conflict-of-interest charges rising from
the hiring of Doug Barton as Counsel
for Employee Relations.
Lyman noted that there have been
"no complaints from anyone as to the
fairness of the NLRB hearing," which
he said, "went on interminably, often
allowing delays so that additional
parties could present evidence."
