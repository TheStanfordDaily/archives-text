# Employees Vote Today On Unionization Choice
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Three months of heavy
campaigning for unionization of
Stanford workers comes to an end
today when 1600 employees go to the
polls to decide whether they want to
be represented by the Teamsters
Union.
The Teamsters won 354 of 1303
votes cast in the March 7 National
Labor Relations Board election,
beating out two other unions. The no
union proposition came in first on the
ballot in March, drawing 483 votes.
But none of the options on the
ballot received a majority of the vote,
so the NLRB called a runoff election
for tomorrow.
The polling places and times are the
same as the last election:
The SLAC Auditorium Foyer,
Maples Pavilion Room 14 and Geology
Comer Room 321 from 6:30 a.m. to
10:30 a.m., and from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.,
and Medical Center Room Ml 14 from
11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Results will be
available Thursday afternoon and
printed in Friday's Daily.
Polling Places
Employees have been assigned to
vote at specific polling places, but a
worker may vote a challenged ballot at
a different location if he wishes.
The NLRB requires that each
worker voting have some
identification—a driver's license or
social security card, for
instance-—when he goes to the polls.
The ballot simply asks if employees
want to be represented by the
Teamsters, making no mention of "no
union." If the Teamsters lose the
election, no other union may represent
employees for at least a year.
President Lyman, in a full-page
advertisement by the University in
yesterday's Daily, urged workers to go
to the polls and vote.
'Please Vote'
"An 80 percent turnout, which we
had in March, is good, but not good
enough. I hope that it is closer to 100

percent this time . . . Whether you
vote yes or no on April 19, please
vote," Lyman said.
The last days of the campaign have
been among the bitterest since January
20, when the NLRB directed that
Stanford workers vote on the union
question.
The University, in a full page ad
published Monday and Tuesday,
accused the Teamsters of giving
employees inaccurate information in a
booklet entitled "Brighten Your
Economic Future" that was mailed to
every worker eligible to vote in the
election. The Teamsters denied the
inaccuracies.
Officiated Hearing
The Teamsters, in turn, pointed out
that the University counsel who wrote
most of the text of the ad was working
for the NLRB when the Teamsters
petitioned for an election at Stanford,
and officiated at the hearing for
evidence and arguments on the
petition.
The Teamster petition was denied
in favor of a different petition from
California School Employees
Association-Stanford Employees

Association.
Brad Wells of the San Francisco
NLRB today told the Daily that he
knew of no wrong-doing in the hiring
of counsel Doug Barton by the
University. Barton is the lawyer the
Teamsters object to.
Can File Objection
"If the Teamsters want to file an
objection with us, they can," he said.
"But I don't know of anything illegal
going on right now."
Opposition to the Teamsters from
sources other than the University has
also stiffened the last few days. United
Stanford Employees and Stanford
Employees Association, the two
unions that lost the March election,
have both announced that they oppose
the Teamsters, and have distributed
leaflets and taken out newspaper ads
against the larger union.
Officials of both groups predict
that the Teamsters will lose by a
substantial margin. But Rudy Tham,
the man who has engineered the
Teamster campaign at Stanford,
disagrees. He is predicting the
Teamsters will carry 70 percent of the
vote in the election today.

The SLAC Auditorium Foyer,
Maples Pavilion Room 14 and Geology
Comer Room 321 from 6:30 a.m. to
10:30 a.m., and from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.,
and Medical Center Room Ml 14 from
11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Results will be
available Thursday afternoon and
printed in Friday's Daily.
Polling Places
Employees have been assigned to
vote at specific polling places, but a
worker may vote a challenged ballot at
a different location if he wishes.
The NLRB requires that each
worker voting have some
identification—a driver's license or
social security card, for
instance-—when he goes to the polls.
The ballot simply asks if employees
want to be represented by the
Teamsters, making no mention of "no
union." If the Teamsters lose the
election, no other union may represent
employees for at least a year.
President Lyman, in a full-page
advertisement by the University in
yesterday's Daily, urged workers to go
to the polls and vote.
'Please Vote'
"An 80 percent turnout, which we
had in March, is good, but not good
enough. I hope that it is closer to 100

percent this time . . . Whether you
vote yes or no on April 19, please
vote," Lyman said.
The last days of the campaign have
been among the bitterest since January
20, when the NLRB directed that
Stanford workers vote on the union
question.
The University, in a full page ad
published Monday and Tuesday,
accused the Teamsters of giving
employees inaccurate information in a
booklet entitled "Brighten Your
Economic Future" that was mailed to
every worker eligible to vote in the
election. The Teamsters denied the
inaccuracies.
Officiated Hearing
The Teamsters, in turn, pointed out
that the University counsel who wrote
most of the text of the ad was working
for the NLRB when the Teamsters
petitioned for an election at Stanford,
and officiated at the hearing for
evidence and arguments on the
petition.
The Teamster petition was denied
in favor of a different petition from
California School Employees
Association-Stanford Employees

Association.
Brad Wells of the San Francisco
NLRB today told the Daily that he
knew of no wrong-doing in the hiring
of counsel Doug Barton by the
University. Barton is the lawyer the
Teamsters object to.
Can File Objection
"If the Teamsters want to file an
objection with us, they can," he said.
"But I don't know of anything illegal
going on right now."
Opposition to the Teamsters from
sources other than the University has
also stiffened the last few days. United
Stanford Employees and Stanford
Employees Association, the two
unions that lost the March election,
have both announced that they oppose
the Teamsters, and have distributed
leaflets and taken out newspaper ads
against the larger union.
Officials of both groups predict
that the Teamsters will lose by a
substantial margin. But Rudy Tham,
the man who has engineered the
Teamster campaign at Stanford,
disagrees. He is predicting the
Teamsters will carry 70 percent of the
vote in the election today.
Three months of heavy
campaigning for unionization of
Stanford workers comes to an end
today when 1600 employees go to the
polls to decide whether they want to
be represented by the Teamsters
Union.
The Teamsters won 354 of 1303
votes cast in the March 7 National
Labor Relations Board election,
beating out two other unions. The no
union proposition came in first on the
ballot in March, drawing 483 votes.
But none of the options on the
ballot received a majority of the vote,
so the NLRB called a runoff election
for tomorrow.
The polling places and times are the
same as the last election:
The SLAC Auditorium Foyer,
Maples Pavilion Room 14 and Geology
Comer Room 321 from 6:30 a.m. to
10:30 a.m., and from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.,
