# Laird Denies Reports Of Bombing Limits
## 
### 
United States air raids over
Vietnam were sharply curtailed
yesterday, but Defense Secretary
Melvin Laird said in Washington there
was "no substance" to rumors that the
bombing was restricted to targets more
than 60 miles south of Hanoi.
The Associated Press had reported
Monday that President Nixon had
ordered bombing halted above the
20th parallel while awaiting reaction
from Hanoi to the latest bombings.
Huge U.S. air raids Sunday struck
targets in and around Hanoi and the

vital port of Haiphong for the first
time in almost four years.
Likely To Resume
The AP said yesterday that it had
learned from U.S. military sources that
bombing would be temporarily
restricted, but that the sources
emphasized the President was likely to
resume full-scale operations if no
positive response was forthcoming
from Vietnam.
Secreatary of State William Rogers
also backed up Laird's testimony in
another appearance before the Foreign
Relations panel.
Rogers told the senators, "There
are only two announcements about
what we are going to do. We are not
going to re-introduce American
ground-combat troops and we are not
going to introduce nuclear weapons
into North or South Vietnam."
But he added lhat there would be
no resumption of peace talks until
North Vietnamese withdraw from the
South.
After Rogers' testimony, the
committee passed by a 9-1 vote a
resolution calling for an end to money
for the war after Dec. 31.
Highest Level
While the situation was relatively
quiet in North Vietnam, U.S. bombing
in South Vietnam reached its highest
level since 1966, logging over 1000 air
strikes yesterday and today.
The L.3. Command in Saigon
announced losses of three aircraft,
with six killed and two injured.
In Cambodia, North Vietnamese
troops appeared to be gaining in
fighting centered around the temple
ruins of Angkor Wat. Latest reports
said that North Vietnamese troops had
apparently surrounded a relief column
of Cambodian troops trying to reach a
1000-man government force trapped
near the ruins.
