# Hayden To Speak Tonight
## Student Anti-War Protests Increase 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Tom Hayden, a defendant in the
1970 Chicago Conspiracy Trial and
co-founder of the Students for a
Democratic Society, will speak at
Cubberley Auditorium tonight at
7:30, as anti-war activities on campus
continue to mount in protest to
increased bombing of North Vietnam.
An "organizational meeting" to
discuss means of implementing a
student strike will follow Hayden's
speech, according to a spokesman for
meeting organizers.
Another "organizational meeting"
sponsored by the Columbae
community yesterday afternoon
brought an estimated 325 people to
White Plaza to discuss the proposed
strike.
The ASSU Council of Presidents
yesterday added its voice to calls for a
campus strike. In a prepared
statement, the Council declared that
"student effort should be
concentrated in endorsing and
participating in that strike," and asked
the University to "re-examine" its
activities in research and military
recruiting.

University President Richard W.
Lyman has written a letter to
President Nixon strongly opposing the
new bombing, but says he has "no
intention" of closing down the campus
(for related story, see back page).
Other Strikes
Similar strikes were either in the
planning or implementation stages at
some 45 other campuses across the
country, a spokesman for the National
Student Association told the Daily last
night.
At Columbia University in New
York City, where about 1500 persons
blocked traffic on Broadway Monday
night, a crowd of 1200 met yesterday
at Barnard College and voted to stage
an immediate shut-down of the
University until the United States
ceased all military activities in
Southeast Asia.
The Columbia Senate will take up a
proposal to close down the campus
when it meets Friday, but indications
are that the strike will continue with
or without faculty and administration
support.
The Columbia Daily Spectator told
the Daily last night that pickets had

blocked doorways to some classes
yesterday.
University President William McGill
has declared himself opposed to any
shutdown of the college.
At Cambridge, Mass., protesters
yesterday stoned the Harvard Center
for International Studies, then entered
the building and set fire to parts of the
three-story structure.
Firemen quickly extinguished the
blaze, and 200 protestors left the
scene. No arrests were made.
Earlier in the day, about 1200
persons gathered in Boston Common
to oppose the escalated bombing.
Route Blocked
About 100 Maryland State
policemen used tear gas and dogs to
break up a demonstration of about
500 University of Maryland students
that was blocking traffic on U.S.
Route 1.
The National Student Association
reported that some students at
Amherst College in Amherst, Mass.,
had decided to strike until the United
States ceased military operations in
Indochina.
At the University of California at

Berkeley, a meeting is planned for
Thursday to decide on a course of
action.
Students at a mass meeting at
Princeton University last night voted
by better than a 3-1 margin to go on
an immediate open-ended strike.
Torch-Light Parade
A Palo Alto torch-light parade is
scheduled for 7:30 p.m. tomorrow
night. The procession will march from
Lytton Plaza on University Ave. in
Palo Alto to Hansen Labs on the
Stanford campus.
Stanford authorities fear another
outbreak of trashing later this week
like Monday night's, in which one
Stanford Security Patrol officer was
injured and some 50 windows were
broken. No official damage estimate
was available.
Stanford Security Director Marvin
Herrington told radio station KZSU
last night that "three or four tac
units" from the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Office were patrolling the
campus on foot last night.
"Given the events of Monday night,
this is just a precautionary measure,"
he said.
