Policy }n Names
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Daily should not exist if it does not serve the
interests of the Stanford community. With an
A.S.S.U. fee assessment at hand, it is mandator)'
that the people of the community evaluate the
responsibility of the Daily. As a student-run,
student-funded newspaper, its policies must be
determined by those in whose name the Daily
publishes, not by an appeal to journalistic
principles. The publication last week of a student's
name against his will, in connection with a
marijuana arrest in Donner House calls into question
the Daily's responsibility.
During the day and night before publication, the
individual involved, as well as most of Donner's
residents, attempted to dissuade the Daily from
publishing his name. We think it is vital for the
community to know this, because a large portion of
it potentially stands in a similar position.
It is not essential that the individual's name be

used if it is to his detriment and to no one's benefit.
Certainly it is only out of curiosity that we think we
need to know his name. With 70 percent of us
potentially vulnerable in a drug-related context
alone, and all of us in any number of other
contexts, the implications of this recent indiscretion
are frightening for all of us.
If a student-run publication does not serve the
interests of the community, and in fact threatens a
large portion of the community, it should not exist.

(EDITOR'S NOTE: The Daily's policy, decided by
its staff of students, is to publish names of arrested
students when their arrests are part of a news story.
We believe it would be irresponsible to censor such
information, to keep so basic a fact out of a story.
The arrest of the Donner students —already on the
public record and almost certain to be printed in
other newspapers — was neither caused nor
aggravated by the Daily's reporting.)
