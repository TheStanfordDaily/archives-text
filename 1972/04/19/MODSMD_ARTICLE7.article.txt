# Teamsters, No Union: Pro And Con
## 
### 
Teamsters' Accomplishments
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the University-published and
-edited Staff News of April 12 are
questions, purportedly by
employees, and the
administration's answers regarding
the union election.
As an employee, I would like
to ask a question and give some
answers: What improvements have
been made in wages, hours, and
working conditions since the
Teamsters became active on the
campus?
1. The job classification
project, begun in December 1969,
and the accompanying job
classification and pay plan.
2. $400/ month minimum
salary for regular staff employees
working a forty-hour week.
3. Staff pension plan improved
to require no employee
contribution (only accomplished
last September 1).

4. Base health insurance plan
coverage for regular staff
employees paid by the University.
(What about my dependents?)
I have talked to hundreds of
people since the beginning of the
Teamsters campaign and have had
several grievances brought to my
attention. Among them is a
Chicano worker who was earning
$314/ month for a forty-hour
week. Last week the grievance was
settled and the employee is now
being paid $530/ month with
retroactivity being considered.
There would have been no
problem if the Teamsters'
grievance procedure had been in
effect.
During the last "Support the
Teamsters" campaign I met
people who were saying two
months ago "WE NEED A
UNION NOW!" Now they say,
"Wait till next year," or the next
or the next!
How soon they forget the
problems at Tresidder Union!
How soon they forget the
attempted layoffs of seventeen
people at the Physical Plant!
If we needed a union then, we
need a union now.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The University administration,
USE, and SEA have ended up in a
coalition to stop the workers at
Stanford from unionizing.
Why?
For USE and SEA it's sour
grapes. To hell with the workers,
they say. If we can't be the union,
we don't want the workers to
have any union now.
USE and SEA gloss over the
fact that if we workers don't win
this election it will probably be
years till we do win. They forget
that with President Lyman
announcing that he's just cut
"around the fringes" we can't
afford to wait any longer to be

protected by a union.
What do we tell the people
who have to hold down two jobs
to survive? What do we tell the
hundreds of people who have to
pay for rent and groceries on
$450 a month? Or the
"temporary" workers who we
have found earning between $250
and $300/ month for full-time
work. Wait? For what? So USE
and SEA who have been around
for many years and have failed to
gain support can try again next
year? and then the next? That
won't help pay the bills in the
meanwhile.
For the administration, the
motive for stopping a union is
self-interest. If we win this
election, for the first time in
Stanford's history workers may
win some basic protections and
rights, and decent wages and
benefits.
The administration has been
laying out hundreds of dollars in
last minute ads full of distorted
"facts." Obviously they consider a
no-union vote a good investment
which will save them a lot of
money later. Remember, Stanford
is one of the wealthiest
institutions in the area, and yet
many of its workers are the most
poorly paid.
Remember too, without a
union, we workers have
nothing—no representation, no
protection, and no say. VOTE
UNION.

Teamsters Mean Layoffs
Editor, THE DAILY:
We who work at Stanford have
reached a point where a majority
agree we will have a union. The
next question we should be
considering — is what kind of
union. The first NLRB election
said 'NO' to no-union and CSEA.
It would make a lot more sense if
the next election was between a
Teamster type outside union and
a USE type local controlled and
local led union. We regret that in
Wednesday's election the current
choice is Teamster 856 'YES' or
'NO'.
The Teamsters have done their
best to keep us in the dark about
themselves. A year ago, they
refused to help Stanford workers
stop layoffs at Tresidder Union
and the Physical Plant. Now they
flood us with keychains, mirrors,
junk mail and questionable
promises. Finally in the last week
of campaigning, they've gotten
down to a few concrete proposals.
Instead of blindly swallowing
the Teamsters honeymoon in the
sky promises, USE took a hard
look at three dozen of the forty
odd contracts that 856 now holds.

Since the Teamster contracts are
far from uniform — for example,
pension withholding currently
varies from $60.55/ month to
nothing — we averaged them out.
The comparison led USE to
suspect that the Teamsters are
promising more than they intend
to deliver.
Layoffs
There is a loophole in the
Teamster Model Contract
Proposal big enough to drive a
circus truck full of gorillas
through. All though the proposal
covers everything from traffic
citations to lie detector tests —
there's no mention of a no layoff
policy. That's because they
haven't got one. The Teamsters
say layoffs are the bosses' business.
Thus when the Teamster
proposal compares the top
Stanford wage of $1006/ month to
a 'sample private industry rate', of
$1534/ month — a whopping
$528/ month difference — you
might begin to suspect how that
$18,000 steamfitter is going to get
paid. It's simple. Lay off a single
$12,000 steamfitter and work the
devil out of the $18,000 man.
Stanford saves $6,000. The
Teamsters boast about their'high'
contract.
About 1/3 of unit'C'are Black
or Brown. About 1/4 are women.
These groups are the lowest paid,
the first laid off, and the last
rehired. So two minority
apprentices are BAPed from their
$8500/ year training program
because the senior man receives a
bloated $17,000 from the
Teamsters. They may be inclined
to bad mouth the Teamsters —
while cooling their heels in the
unemployment lines.
A lot of solid union people will
be voting 'NO' on the Teamsters.
Their reasons may vary. Some say
the Teamsters don't know number
one about Stanford needs. Others
don't like Teamster sweetheart
contracts with the Salinas lettuce
growers. Many have no use for
two bosses — they say Teamster
boss Tham has about as much in
common with union democracy as
Hermann Goering. Enough said.
Vote the rascals down.

Union Racism
(Editor's Note: This letter was
addressed to black workers at
Stanford.)
Dear Brothers and Sisters:
1 am a Black employee at
Stanford. My purpose in writing
to you is to state my belief that if
you vote April 19th for the
Teamsters you will be voting
against yourself and other Black
people.
I have been actively involved in
attempting to solve grievances and
improve employment
opportunities for Black people on
the Peninsula for approximately
10 years. Therefore, I am
somewhat familiar with some of
the problems they face locally and
nationally.
Charges of racism have been
just, as numerous and serious
against unions as they have been
against employers — if not more
so. Those charges include racism
in electing union officers, union
refusal to pursue grievances of
Black employees against
management, and refusal to
consider the general interests of
Black members and the Black
community.
As you well know, unions have
not aided in advancing
employment opportunities for
Black people. As a matter of fact,
they have been fairly successful in
stopping or slowing progress in
this area. (For example, they have
opposed plans like the
"Philadelphia Plan," where
definite employment goals for
Black people are required.)
Therefore, there are no
guarantees that unionization at
Stanford will help Black people.
Unions will first aid their own "in
group," then they MIGHT help
Black people! Why, then, should
Black people vote for an
organization that has historically
and systematically worked against
them!?
If the Teamsters are voted in
on April 19th, more than likely a
"union security agreement" will
eventually come about. If this
happens, ALL employees in the
bargaining union will be required
to pay union dues and fees —
whether they want to or not,
whether they voted for unions or
not. This-is the kind of slavery
from which Black people have
been trying to get away from for
years. But more importantly, why
should you vote to pay to be
further enslaved!?
There is another fact you
should know about the Teamsters.
They are also attempting to
unionize prison guards. You
should also know that the
Teamsters' battlecry is that the
death penalty should be
continued. I guess you know who
represents a large percentage of
those who are on death row and
who have been executed. So the
dues you will be paying to the
Teamsters here, if you vote them
in, may be used to bring the death
penalty back.
There has been little
improvement in the employment
opportunities of Black people at
Stanford over the last few years.
The little progress that has been
realized has been because of the
demands of Black students and
staff. The rights and interests of
Black people have never been
represented in any organization in
which they are small in number,
and unions are, and will be, no
exception.
Black people are a definite
minority at Stanford and
probably will remain such. Do
you believe that a union, with a
majority of white members is
going to demand that Stanford
hire more Black people and fewer
non-Blacks? Do you believe a
union will insist that Black people
be fairly promoted? Not likely!
I urge fellow Black employees
to not tax themselves to be
further victims of racism.
Management is already doing this
well enough. If anything, Black
people should form their own
"perfect union." I would be most
happy to help toward that end.
Vote "NO UNION!" on April
19 th.

probably will remain such. Do
you believe that a union, with a
majority of white members is
going to demand that Stanford
hire more Black people and fewer
non-Blacks? Do you believe a
union will insist that Black people
be fairly promoted? Not likely!
I urge fellow Black employees
to not tax themselves to be
further victims of racism.
Management is already doing this
well enough. If anything, Black
people should form their own
"perfect union." I would be most
happy to help toward that end.

Teamsters' Accomplishments
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the University-published and
-edited Staff News of April 12 are
questions, purportedly by
employees, and the
administration's answers regarding
the union election.
As an employee, I would like
to ask a question and give some
answers: What improvements have
been made in wages, hours, and
working conditions since the
Teamsters became active on the
campus?
1. The job classification
project, begun in December 1969,
and the accompanying job
classification and pay plan.
2. $400/ month minimum
salary for regular staff employees
working a forty-hour week.
3. Staff pension plan improved
to require no employee
contribution (only accomplished
last September 1).

4. Base health insurance plan
coverage for regular staff
employees paid by the University.
(What about my dependents?)
I have talked to hundreds of
people since the beginning of the
Teamsters campaign and have had
several grievances brought to my
attention. Among them is a
Chicano worker who was earning
$314/ month for a forty-hour
week. Last week the grievance was
settled and the employee is now
being paid $530/ month with
retroactivity being considered.
There would have been no
problem if the Teamsters'
grievance procedure had been in
effect.
During the last "Support the
Teamsters" campaign I met
people who were saying two
months ago "WE NEED A
UNION NOW!" Now they say,
"Wait till next year," or the next
or the next!
How soon they forget the
problems at Tresidder Union!
How soon they forget the
attempted layoffs of seventeen
people at the Physical Plant!
If we needed a union then, we
need a union now.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The University administration,
USE, and SEA have ended up in a
coalition to stop the workers at
Stanford from unionizing.
Why?
For USE and SEA it's sour
grapes. To hell with the workers,
they say. If we can't be the union,
we don't want the workers to
have any union now.
USE and SEA gloss over the
fact that if we workers don't win
this election it will probably be
years till we do win. They forget
that with President Lyman
announcing that he's just cut
"around the fringes" we can't
afford to wait any longer to be

protected by a union.
What do we tell the people
who have to hold down two jobs
to survive? What do we tell the
hundreds of people who have to
pay for rent and groceries on
$450 a month? Or the
"temporary" workers who we
have found earning between $250
and $300/ month for full-time
work. Wait? For what? So USE
and SEA who have been around
for many years and have failed to
gain support can try again next
year? and then the next? That
won't help pay the bills in the
meanwhile.
For the administration, the
motive for stopping a union is
self-interest. If we win this
election, for the first time in
Stanford's history workers may
win some basic protections and
rights, and decent wages and
benefits.
The administration has been
laying out hundreds of dollars in
last minute ads full of distorted
"facts." Obviously they consider a
no-union vote a good investment
which will save them a lot of
money later. Remember, Stanford
is one of the wealthiest
institutions in the area, and yet
many of its workers are the most
poorly paid.
Remember too, without a
union, we workers have
nothing—no representation, no
protection, and no say. VOTE
UNION.

Teamsters Mean Layoffs
Editor, THE DAILY:
We who work at Stanford have
reached a point where a majority
agree we will have a union. The
next question we should be
considering — is what kind of
union. The first NLRB election
said 'NO' to no-union and CSEA.
It would make a lot more sense if
the next election was between a
Teamster type outside union and
a USE type local controlled and
local led union. We regret that in
Wednesday's election the current
choice is Teamster 856 'YES' or
'NO'.
The Teamsters have done their
best to keep us in the dark about
themselves. A year ago, they
refused to help Stanford workers
stop layoffs at Tresidder Union
and the Physical Plant. Now they
flood us with keychains, mirrors,
junk mail and questionable
promises. Finally in the last week
of campaigning, they've gotten
down to a few concrete proposals.
Instead of blindly swallowing
the Teamsters honeymoon in the
sky promises, USE took a hard
look at three dozen of the forty
odd contracts that 856 now holds.

Since the Teamster contracts are
far from uniform — for example,
pension withholding currently
varies from $60.55/ month to
nothing — we averaged them out.
The comparison led USE to
suspect that the Teamsters are
promising more than they intend
to deliver.
Layoffs
There is a loophole in the
Teamster Model Contract
Proposal big enough to drive a
circus truck full of gorillas
through. All though the proposal
covers everything from traffic
citations to lie detector tests —
there's no mention of a no layoff
policy. That's because they
haven't got one. The Teamsters
say layoffs are the bosses' business.
Thus when the Teamster
proposal compares the top
Stanford wage of $1006/ month to
a 'sample private industry rate', of
$1534/ month — a whopping
$528/ month difference — you
might begin to suspect how that
$18,000 steamfitter is going to get
paid. It's simple. Lay off a single
$12,000 steamfitter and work the
devil out of the $18,000 man.
Stanford saves $6,000. The
Teamsters boast about their'high'
contract.
About 1/3 of unit'C'are Black
or Brown. About 1/4 are women.
These groups are the lowest paid,
the first laid off, and the last
rehired. So two minority
apprentices are BAPed from their
$8500/ year training program
because the senior man receives a
bloated $17,000 from the
Teamsters. They may be inclined
to bad mouth the Teamsters —
while cooling their heels in the
unemployment lines.
A lot of solid union people will
be voting 'NO' on the Teamsters.
Their reasons may vary. Some say
the Teamsters don't know number
one about Stanford needs. Others
don't like Teamster sweetheart
contracts with the Salinas lettuce
growers. Many have no use for
two bosses — they say Teamster
boss Tham has about as much in
common with union democracy as
Hermann Goering. Enough said.
Vote the rascals down.

Union Racism
(Editor's Note: This letter was
addressed to black workers at
Stanford.)
Dear Brothers and Sisters:
1 am a Black employee at
Stanford. My purpose in writing
to you is to state my belief that if
you vote April 19th for the
Teamsters you will be voting
against yourself and other Black
people.
I have been actively involved in
attempting to solve grievances and
improve employment
opportunities for Black people on
the Peninsula for approximately
10 years. Therefore, I am
somewhat familiar with some of
the problems they face locally and
nationally.
Charges of racism have been
just, as numerous and serious
against unions as they have been
against employers — if not more
so. Those charges include racism
in electing union officers, union
refusal to pursue grievances of
Black employees against
management, and refusal to
consider the general interests of
Black members and the Black
community.
As you well know, unions have
not aided in advancing
employment opportunities for
Black people. As a matter of fact,
they have been fairly successful in
stopping or slowing progress in
this area. (For example, they have
opposed plans like the
"Philadelphia Plan," where
definite employment goals for
Black people are required.)
Therefore, there are no
guarantees that unionization at
Stanford will help Black people.
Unions will first aid their own "in
group," then they MIGHT help
Black people! Why, then, should
Black people vote for an
organization that has historically
and systematically worked against
them!?
If the Teamsters are voted in
on April 19th, more than likely a
"union security agreement" will
eventually come about. If this
happens, ALL employees in the
bargaining union will be required
to pay union dues and fees —
whether they want to or not,
whether they voted for unions or
not. This-is the kind of slavery
from which Black people have
been trying to get away from for
years. But more importantly, why
should you vote to pay to be
further enslaved!?
There is another fact you
should know about the Teamsters.
They are also attempting to
unionize prison guards. You
should also know that the
Teamsters' battlecry is that the
death penalty should be
continued. I guess you know who
represents a large percentage of
those who are on death row and
who have been executed. So the
dues you will be paying to the
Teamsters here, if you vote them
in, may be used to bring the death
penalty back.
There has been little
improvement in the employment
opportunities of Black people at
Stanford over the last few years.
The little progress that has been
realized has been because of the
demands of Black students and
staff. The rights and interests of
Black people have never been
represented in any organization in
which they are small in number,
and unions are, and will be, no
exception.
Black people are a definite
minority at Stanford and
probably will remain such. Do
you believe that a union, with a
majority of white members is
going to demand that Stanford
hire more Black people and fewer
non-Blacks? Do you believe a
union will insist that Black people

represents a large percentage of
those who are on death row and
who have been executed. So the
dues you will be paying to the
Teamsters here, if you vote them
in, may be used to bring the death
penalty back.
There has been little
improvement in the employment
opportunities of Black people at
Stanford over the last few years.
The little progress that has been
realized has been because of the
demands of Black students and
staff. The rights and interests of
Black people have never been
represented in any organization in
which they are small in number,
and unions are, and will be, no
exception.
Black people are a definite
minority at Stanford and
probably will remain such. Do
you believe that a union, with a
majority of white members is
going to demand that Stanford
hire more Black people and fewer
non-Blacks? Do you believe a
union will insist that Black people
be fairly promoted? Not likely!
I urge fellow Black employees
to not tax themselves to be
further victims of racism.
Management is already doing this
well enough. If anything, Black
people should form their own
"perfect union." I would be most
happy to help toward that end.

Teamsters' Accomplishments
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the University-published and
-edited Staff News of April 12 are
questions, purportedly by
employees, and the
administration's answers regarding
the union election.
As an employee, I would like
to ask a question and give some
answers: What improvements have
been made in wages, hours, and
working conditions since the
Teamsters became active on the
campus?
1. The job classification
project, begun in December 1969,
and the accompanying job
classification and pay plan.
2. $400/ month minimum
salary for regular staff employees
working a forty-hour week.
3. Staff pension plan improved
to require no employee
contribution (only accomplished
last September 1).

4. Base health insurance plan
coverage for regular staff
employees paid by the University.
(What about my dependents?)
I have talked to hundreds of
people since the beginning of the
Teamsters campaign and have had
several grievances brought to my
attention. Among them is a
Chicano worker who was earning
$314/ month for a forty-hour
week. Last week the grievance was
settled and the employee is now
being paid $530/ month with
retroactivity being considered.
There would have been no
problem if the Teamsters'
grievance procedure had been in
effect.
During the last "Support the
Teamsters" campaign I met
people who were saying two
months ago "WE NEED A
UNION NOW!" Now they say,
"Wait till next year," or the next
or the next!
How soon they forget the
problems at Tresidder Union!
How soon they forget the
attempted layoffs of seventeen
people at the Physical Plant!
If we needed a union then, we
need a union now.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The University administration,
USE, and SEA have ended up in a
coalition to stop the workers at
Stanford from unionizing.
Why?
For USE and SEA it's sour
grapes. To hell with the workers,
they say. If we can't be the union,
we don't want the workers to
have any union now.
USE and SEA gloss over the
fact that if we workers don't win
this election it will probably be
years till we do win. They forget
that with President Lyman
announcing that he's just cut
"around the fringes" we can't
afford to wait any longer to be

protected by a union.
What do we tell the people
who have to hold down two jobs
to survive? What do we tell the
hundreds of people who have to
pay for rent and groceries on
$450 a month? Or the
"temporary" workers who we
have found earning between $250
and $300/ month for full-time
work. Wait? For what? So USE
and SEA who have been around
for many years and have failed to
gain support can try again next
year? and then the next? That
won't help pay the bills in the
meanwhile.
For the administration, the
motive for stopping a union is
self-interest. If we win this
election, for the first time in
Stanford's history workers may
win some basic protections and
rights, and decent wages and
benefits.
The administration has been
laying out hundreds of dollars in
last minute ads full of distorted
"facts." Obviously they consider a
no-union vote a good investment
which will save them a lot of
money later. Remember, Stanford
is one of the wealthiest
institutions in the area, and yet
many of its workers are the most
poorly paid.
Remember too, without a
union, we workers have
nothing—no representation, no
protection, and no say. VOTE
UNION.

Teamsters Mean Layoffs
Editor, THE DAILY:
We who work at Stanford have
reached a point where a majority
agree we will have a union. The
next question we should be
considering — is what kind of
union. The first NLRB election
said 'NO' to no-union and CSEA.
It would make a lot more sense if
the next election was between a
Teamster type outside union and
a USE type local controlled and
local led union. We regret that in
Wednesday's election the current
choice is Teamster 856 'YES' or
'NO'.
The Teamsters have done their
best to keep us in the dark about
themselves. A year ago, they
refused to help Stanford workers
stop layoffs at Tresidder Union
and the Physical Plant. Now they
flood us with keychains, mirrors,
junk mail and questionable
promises. Finally in the last week
of campaigning, they've gotten
down to a few concrete proposals.
Instead of blindly swallowing
the Teamsters honeymoon in the
sky promises, USE took a hard
look at three dozen of the forty
odd contracts that 856 now holds.

Since the Teamster contracts are
far from uniform — for example,
pension withholding currently
varies from $60.55/ month to
nothing — we averaged them out.
The comparison led USE to
suspect that the Teamsters are
promising more than they intend
to deliver.
Layoffs
There is a loophole in the
Teamster Model Contract
Proposal big enough to drive a
circus truck full of gorillas
through. All though the proposal
covers everything from traffic
citations to lie detector tests —
there's no mention of a no layoff
policy. That's because they
haven't got one. The Teamsters
say layoffs are the bosses' business.
Thus when the Teamster
proposal compares the top
Stanford wage of $1006/ month to
a 'sample private industry rate', of
$1534/ month — a whopping
$528/ month difference — you
might begin to suspect how that
$18,000 steamfitter is going to get
paid. It's simple. Lay off a single
$12,000 steamfitter and work the
devil out of the $18,000 man.
Stanford saves $6,000. The
Teamsters boast about their'high'
contract.
About 1/3 of unit'C'are Black
or Brown. About 1/4 are women.
These groups are the lowest paid,
the first laid off, and the last
rehired. So two minority
apprentices are BAPed from their
$8500/ year training program
because the senior man receives a
bloated $17,000 from the
Teamsters. They may be inclined
to bad mouth the Teamsters —
while cooling their heels in the
unemployment lines.
A lot of solid union people will
be voting 'NO' on the Teamsters.
Their reasons may vary. Some say
the Teamsters don't know number
one about Stanford needs. Others
don't like Teamster sweetheart
contracts with the Salinas lettuce
growers. Many have no use for
two bosses — they say Teamster
boss Tham has about as much in
common with union democracy as
Hermann Goering. Enough said.

Union Racism
(Editor's Note: This letter was
addressed to black workers at
Stanford.)
Dear Brothers and Sisters:
1 am a Black employee at
Stanford. My purpose in writing
to you is to state my belief that if
you vote April 19th for the
Teamsters you will be voting
against yourself and other Black
people.
I have been actively involved in
attempting to solve grievances and
improve employment
opportunities for Black people on
the Peninsula for approximately
10 years. Therefore, I am
somewhat familiar with some of
the problems they face locally and
nationally.
Charges of racism have been
just, as numerous and serious
against unions as they have been
against employers — if not more
so. Those charges include racism
in electing union officers, union
refusal to pursue grievances of
Black employees against
management, and refusal to
consider the general interests of
Black members and the Black
community.
As you well know, unions have
not aided in advancing
employment opportunities for
Black people. As a matter of fact,
they have been fairly successful in
stopping or slowing progress in
this area. (For example, they have
opposed plans like the
"Philadelphia Plan," where
definite employment goals for
Black people are required.)
Therefore, there are no
guarantees that unionization at
Stanford will help Black people.
Unions will first aid their own "in
group," then they MIGHT help
Black people! Why, then, should
Black people vote for an
organization that has historically
and systematically worked against
them!?
If the Teamsters are voted in
on April 19th, more than likely a
"union security agreement" will
eventually come about. If this
happens, ALL employees in the
bargaining union will be required
to pay union dues and fees —
whether they want to or not,
whether they voted for unions or
not. This-is the kind of slavery
from which Black people have
been trying to get away from for
years. But more importantly, why
should you vote to pay to be
further enslaved!?
There is another fact you
should know about the Teamsters.
They are also attempting to
unionize prison guards. You
should also know that the
Teamsters' battlecry is that the
death penalty should be
continued. I guess you know who
represents a large percentage of
those who are on death row and
who have been executed. So the
dues you will be paying to the
Teamsters here, if you vote them
in, may be used to bring the death
penalty back.

"union security agreement" will
eventually come about. If this
happens, ALL employees in the
bargaining union will be required
to pay union dues and fees —
whether they want to or not,
whether they voted for unions or
not. This-is the kind of slavery
from which Black people have
been trying to get away from for
years. But more importantly, why
should you vote to pay to be
further enslaved!?
There is another fact you
should know about the Teamsters.
They are also attempting to
unionize prison guards. You
should also know that the
Teamsters' battlecry is that the
death penalty should be
continued. I guess you know who
represents a large percentage of
those who are on death row and
who have been executed. So the
dues you will be paying to the
Teamsters here, if you vote them
in, may be used to bring the death
penalty back.
There has been little
improvement in the employment
opportunities of Black people at
Stanford over the last few years.
The little progress that has been
realized has been because of the
demands of Black students and
staff. The rights and interests of
Black people have never been
represented in any organization in
which they are small in number,
and unions are, and will be, no
exception.
Black people are a definite
minority at Stanford and
probably will remain such. Do
you believe that a union, with a
majority of white members is
going to demand that Stanford
hire more Black people and fewer
non-Blacks? Do you believe a
union will insist that Black people
be fairly promoted? Not likely!
I urge fellow Black employees
to not tax themselves to be
further victims of racism.
Management is already doing this
well enough. If anything, Black
people should form their own
"perfect union." I would be most
happy to help toward that end.

Teamsters' Accomplishments
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the University-published and
-edited Staff News of April 12 are
questions, purportedly by
employees, and the
administration's answers regarding
the union election.
As an employee, I would like
to ask a question and give some
answers: What improvements have
been made in wages, hours, and
working conditions since the
Teamsters became active on the
campus?
1. The job classification
project, begun in December 1969,
and the accompanying job
classification and pay plan.
2. $400/ month minimum
salary for regular staff employees
working a forty-hour week.
3. Staff pension plan improved
to require no employee
contribution (only accomplished
last September 1).

4. Base health insurance plan
coverage for regular staff
employees paid by the University.
(What about my dependents?)
I have talked to hundreds of
people since the beginning of the
Teamsters campaign and have had
several grievances brought to my
attention. Among them is a
Chicano worker who was earning
$314/ month for a forty-hour
week. Last week the grievance was
settled and the employee is now
being paid $530/ month with
retroactivity being considered.
There would have been no
problem if the Teamsters'
grievance procedure had been in
effect.
During the last "Support the
Teamsters" campaign I met
people who were saying two
months ago "WE NEED A
UNION NOW!" Now they say,
"Wait till next year," or the next
or the next!
How soon they forget the
problems at Tresidder Union!
How soon they forget the
attempted layoffs of seventeen
people at the Physical Plant!
If we needed a union then, we
need a union now.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The University administration,
USE, and SEA have ended up in a
coalition to stop the workers at
Stanford from unionizing.
Why?
For USE and SEA it's sour
grapes. To hell with the workers,
they say. If we can't be the union,
we don't want the workers to
have any union now.
USE and SEA gloss over the
fact that if we workers don't win
this election it will probably be
years till we do win. They forget
that with President Lyman
announcing that he's just cut
"around the fringes" we can't
afford to wait any longer to be

protected by a union.
What do we tell the people
who have to hold down two jobs
to survive? What do we tell the
hundreds of people who have to
pay for rent and groceries on
$450 a month? Or the
"temporary" workers who we
have found earning between $250
and $300/ month for full-time
work. Wait? For what? So USE
and SEA who have been around
for many years and have failed to
gain support can try again next
year? and then the next? That
won't help pay the bills in the
meanwhile.
For the administration, the
motive for stopping a union is
self-interest. If we win this
election, for the first time in
Stanford's history workers may
win some basic protections and
rights, and decent wages and
benefits.
The administration has been
laying out hundreds of dollars in
last minute ads full of distorted
"facts." Obviously they consider a
no-union vote a good investment
which will save them a lot of
money later. Remember, Stanford
is one of the wealthiest
institutions in the area, and yet
many of its workers are the most
poorly paid.
Remember too, without a
union, we workers have
nothing—no representation, no
protection, and no say. VOTE
UNION.

Teamsters Mean Layoffs
Editor, THE DAILY:
We who work at Stanford have
reached a point where a majority
agree we will have a union. The
next question we should be
considering — is what kind of
union. The first NLRB election
said 'NO' to no-union and CSEA.
It would make a lot more sense if
the next election was between a
Teamster type outside union and
a USE type local controlled and
local led union. We regret that in
Wednesday's election the current
choice is Teamster 856 'YES' or
'NO'.
The Teamsters have done their
best to keep us in the dark about
themselves. A year ago, they
refused to help Stanford workers
stop layoffs at Tresidder Union
and the Physical Plant. Now they
flood us with keychains, mirrors,
junk mail and questionable
promises. Finally in the last week
of campaigning, they've gotten
down to a few concrete proposals.
Instead of blindly swallowing
the Teamsters honeymoon in the
sky promises, USE took a hard
look at three dozen of the forty
odd contracts that 856 now holds.

Since the Teamster contracts are
far from uniform — for example,
pension withholding currently
varies from $60.55/ month to
nothing — we averaged them out.
The comparison led USE to
suspect that the Teamsters are
promising more than they intend
to deliver.
Layoffs
There is a loophole in the
Teamster Model Contract
Proposal big enough to drive a
circus truck full of gorillas
through. All though the proposal
covers everything from traffic
citations to lie detector tests —
there's no mention of a no layoff
policy. That's because they
haven't got one. The Teamsters
say layoffs are the bosses' business.
Thus when the Teamster
proposal compares the top
Stanford wage of $1006/ month to
a 'sample private industry rate', of
$1534/ month — a whopping
$528/ month difference — you
might begin to suspect how that
$18,000 steamfitter is going to get
paid. It's simple. Lay off a single
$12,000 steamfitter and work the
devil out of the $18,000 man.
Stanford saves $6,000. The
Teamsters boast about their'high'
contract.
About 1/3 of unit'C'are Black
or Brown. About 1/4 are women.
These groups are the lowest paid,
the first laid off, and the last
rehired. So two minority
apprentices are BAPed from their
$8500/ year training program
because the senior man receives a
bloated $17,000 from the
Teamsters. They may be inclined
to bad mouth the Teamsters —
while cooling their heels in the
unemployment lines.
A lot of solid union people will
be voting 'NO' on the Teamsters.
Their reasons may vary. Some say
the Teamsters don't know number
one about Stanford needs. Others
don't like Teamster sweetheart
contracts with the Salinas lettuce
growers. Many have no use for
two bosses — they say Teamster
boss Tham has about as much in
common with union democracy as
Hermann Goering. Enough said.

Union Racism
(Editor's Note: This letter was
addressed to black workers at
Stanford.)
Dear Brothers and Sisters:
1 am a Black employee at
Stanford. My purpose in writing
to you is to state my belief that if
you vote April 19th for the
Teamsters you will be voting
against yourself and other Black
people.
I have been actively involved in
attempting to solve grievances and
improve employment
opportunities for Black people on
the Peninsula for approximately
10 years. Therefore, I am
somewhat familiar with some of
the problems they face locally and
nationally.
Charges of racism have been
just, as numerous and serious
against unions as they have been
against employers — if not more
so. Those charges include racism
in electing union officers, union
refusal to pursue grievances of
Black employees against
management, and refusal to
consider the general interests of
Black members and the Black
community.
As you well know, unions have
not aided in advancing
employment opportunities for
Black people. As a matter of fact,
they have been fairly successful in
stopping or slowing progress in
this area. (For example, they have
opposed plans like the
"Philadelphia Plan," where
definite employment goals for
Black people are required.)
Therefore, there are no
guarantees that unionization at
Stanford will help Black people.
Unions will first aid their own "in
group," then they MIGHT help
Black people! Why, then, should
Black people vote for an
organization that has historically
and systematically worked against
them!?
If the Teamsters are voted in
on April 19th, more than likely a
"union security agreement" will
eventually come about. If this
happens, ALL employees in the
bargaining union will be required
to pay union dues and fees —

As you well know, unions have
not aided in advancing
employment opportunities for
Black people. As a matter of fact,
they have been fairly successful in
stopping or slowing progress in
this area. (For example, they have
opposed plans like the
"Philadelphia Plan," where
definite employment goals for
Black people are required.)
Therefore, there are no
guarantees that unionization at
Stanford will help Black people.
Unions will first aid their own "in
group," then they MIGHT help
Black people! Why, then, should
Black people vote for an
organization that has historically
and systematically worked against
them!?
If the Teamsters are voted in
on April 19th, more than likely a
"union security agreement" will
eventually come about. If this
happens, ALL employees in the
bargaining union will be required
to pay union dues and fees —
whether they want to or not,
whether they voted for unions or
not. This-is the kind of slavery
from which Black people have
been trying to get away from for
years. But more importantly, why
should you vote to pay to be
further enslaved!?
There is another fact you
should know about the Teamsters.
They are also attempting to
unionize prison guards. You
should also know that the
Teamsters' battlecry is that the
death penalty should be
continued. I guess you know who
represents a large percentage of
those who are on death row and
who have been executed. So the
dues you will be paying to the
Teamsters here, if you vote them
in, may be used to bring the death
penalty back.
There has been little
improvement in the employment
opportunities of Black people at
Stanford over the last few years.
The little progress that has been
realized has been because of the
demands of Black students and
staff. The rights and interests of
Black people have never been
represented in any organization in
which they are small in number,
and unions are, and will be, no
exception.
Black people are a definite
minority at Stanford and
probably will remain such. Do
you believe that a union, with a
majority of white members is
going to demand that Stanford
hire more Black people and fewer
non-Blacks? Do you believe a
union will insist that Black people
be fairly promoted? Not likely!
I urge fellow Black employees
to not tax themselves to be
further victims of racism.
Management is already doing this
well enough. If anything, Black
people should form their own
"perfect union." I would be most
happy to help toward that end.
Vote "NO UNION!" on April
19 th.

Teamsters' Accomplishments
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the University-published and
-edited Staff News of April 12 are
questions, purportedly by
employees, and the
administration's answers regarding
the union election.
As an employee, I would like
to ask a question and give some
answers: What improvements have
been made in wages, hours, and
working conditions since the
Teamsters became active on the
campus?
1. The job classification
project, begun in December 1969,
and the accompanying job
classification and pay plan.
2. $400/ month minimum
salary for regular staff employees
working a forty-hour week.
3. Staff pension plan improved
to require no employee
contribution (only accomplished
last September 1).

4. Base health insurance plan
coverage for regular staff
employees paid by the University.
(What about my dependents?)
I have talked to hundreds of
people since the beginning of the
Teamsters campaign and have had
several grievances brought to my
attention. Among them is a
Chicano worker who was earning
$314/ month for a forty-hour
week. Last week the grievance was
settled and the employee is now
being paid $530/ month with
retroactivity being considered.
There would have been no
problem if the Teamsters'
grievance procedure had been in
effect.
During the last "Support the
Teamsters" campaign I met
people who were saying two
months ago "WE NEED A
UNION NOW!" Now they say,
"Wait till next year," or the next
or the next!
How soon they forget the
problems at Tresidder Union!
How soon they forget the
attempted layoffs of seventeen
people at the Physical Plant!
If we needed a union then, we
need a union now.

Vote Teamsters
Editor, THE DAILY:
The University administration,
USE, and SEA have ended up in a
coalition to stop the workers at
Stanford from unionizing.
Why?
For USE and SEA it's sour
grapes. To hell with the workers,
they say. If we can't be the union,
we don't want the workers to
have any union now.
USE and SEA gloss over the
fact that if we workers don't win
this election it will probably be
years till we do win. They forget
that with President Lyman
announcing that he's just cut
"around the fringes" we can't
afford to wait any longer to be

protected by a union.
What do we tell the people
who have to hold down two jobs
to survive? What do we tell the
hundreds of people who have to
pay for rent and groceries on
$450 a month? Or the
"temporary" workers who we
have found earning between $250
and $300/ month for full-time
work. Wait? For what? So USE
and SEA who have been around
for many years and have failed to
gain support can try again next
year? and then the next? That
won't help pay the bills in the
meanwhile.
For the administration, the
motive for stopping a union is
self-interest. If we win this
election, for the first time in
Stanford's history workers may
win some basic protections and
rights, and decent wages and
benefits.
The administration has been
laying out hundreds of dollars in
last minute ads full of distorted
"facts." Obviously they consider a
no-union vote a good investment
which will save them a lot of
money later. Remember, Stanford
is one of the wealthiest
institutions in the area, and yet
many of its workers are the most
poorly paid.
Remember too, without a
union, we workers have
nothing—no representation, no
protection, and no say. VOTE
UNION.

Teamsters Mean Layoffs
Editor, THE DAILY:
We who work at Stanford have
reached a point where a majority
agree we will have a union. The
next question we should be
considering — is what kind of
union. The first NLRB election
said 'NO' to no-union and CSEA.
It would make a lot more sense if
the next election was between a
Teamster type outside union and
a USE type local controlled and
local led union. We regret that in
Wednesday's election the current
choice is Teamster 856 'YES' or
'NO'.
The Teamsters have done their
best to keep us in the dark about
themselves. A year ago, they
refused to help Stanford workers
stop layoffs at Tresidder Union
and the Physical Plant. Now they
flood us with keychains, mirrors,
junk mail and questionable
promises. Finally in the last week
of campaigning, they've gotten
down to a few concrete proposals.
Instead of blindly swallowing
the Teamsters honeymoon in the
sky promises, USE took a hard
look at three dozen of the forty
odd contracts that 856 now holds.

Since the Teamster contracts are
far from uniform — for example,
pension withholding currently
varies from $60.55/ month to
nothing — we averaged them out.
The comparison led USE to
suspect that the Teamsters are
promising more than they intend
to deliver.
Layoffs
There is a loophole in the
Teamster Model Contract
Proposal big enough to drive a
circus truck full of gorillas
through. All though the proposal
covers everything from traffic
citations to lie detector tests —
there's no mention of a no layoff
policy. That's because they
haven't got one. The Teamsters
say layoffs are the bosses' business.
Thus when the Teamster
proposal compares the top
Stanford wage of $1006/ month to
a 'sample private industry rate', of
$1534/ month — a whopping
$528/ month difference — you
might begin to suspect how that
$18,000 steamfitter is going to get
paid. It's simple. Lay off a single
$12,000 steamfitter and work the
devil out of the $18,000 man.
Stanford saves $6,000. The
Teamsters boast about their'high'
contract.
About 1/3 of unit'C'are Black
or Brown. About 1/4 are women.
These groups are the lowest paid,
the first laid off, and the last
rehired. So two minority
apprentices are BAPed from their
$8500/ year training program
because the senior man receives a
bloated $17,000 from the
Teamsters. They may be inclined
to bad mouth the Teamsters —
while cooling their heels in the
unemployment lines.
A lot of solid union people will
be voting 'NO' on the Teamsters.
Their reasons may vary. Some say
the Teamsters don't know number
one about Stanford needs. Others
don't like Teamster sweetheart
contracts with the Salinas lettuce
growers. Many have no use for
two bosses — they say Teamster
boss Tham has about as much in
common with union democracy as
Hermann Goering. Enough said.
Vote the rascals down.

Union Racism
(Editor's Note: This letter was
addressed to black workers at
Stanford.)
Dear Brothers and Sisters:
1 am a Black employee at
Stanford. My purpose in writing
to you is to state my belief that if
you vote April 19th for the
Teamsters you will be voting
against yourself and other Black
people.
I have been actively involved in
attempting to solve grievances and
improve employment
opportunities for Black people on
the Peninsula for approximately
10 years. Therefore, I am
somewhat familiar with some of
the problems they face locally and
nationally.
Charges of racism have been
just, as numerous and serious
against unions as they have been
against employers — if not more
so. Those charges include racism
in electing union officers, union
refusal to pursue grievances of
Black employees against
management, and refusal to
consider the general interests of
Black members and the Black
community.
As you well know, unions have
not aided in advancing
employment opportunities for
Black people. As a matter of fact,
they have been fairly successful in
stopping or slowing progress in
this area. (For example, they have
opposed plans like the
"Philadelphia Plan," where
definite employment goals for
Black people are required.)
Therefore, there are no
guarantees that unionization at
Stanford will help Black people.
Unions will first aid their own "in
group," then they MIGHT help
Black people! Why, then, should
Black people vote for an
organization that has historically
and systematically worked against
