Police and Pot
Editor, THE DAILY:
I am forced by the
circumstances of the recent
marijuana bust on campus to
complain about the treatment
police, especially the Santa Clara
County Sheriffs, are giving the
people of this campus. Until a few
months ago, most of us knew that
the use and possession of pot was
"safe" in the dorms, trailers, and
Row houses. People could openly
smoke, not flauntingly, but
comfortably, without paranoia, in
their own room or in front of the
union, by the fountain, in the
Quad, just before an evening
campus movie; in short, where
they pleased. I myself felt that
this was an enlightened and
mature attitude on the matter.
But the patrols and general
"snooping" around that the Santa
Clara Sheriffs have been doing, at
least to my admittedly
un-professional eye, has increased
in the past few months. I believe
that the bust of two freshmen
(dangerous criminals!) in Stern
Hall on April 11 was a direct
result of this increased
surveillance. The spectre of
plainclothesmen literally "taking
names" the night before the bust
and the seized Marijuana petition
during the arrest add a true
police-state efficiency to the
entire affair.
1 think there is no doubt,
despite the administration's
assurances, that if future
investigations by Santa Clara
Deputies uncover possessors and
users of marijuana or hashish,
more photographs of Stanford
freaks, hands cuffed behind them
(in my opinion, obviously piggish
and unnecessary), will adorn the
front page of the Stanford Daily.
1 have three proposals to make
on this matter of campus
marijuana freedom:
1. Haney Armstrong and Ron
Hopkins receive the full support
of the University in this matter.
We all know how much
"influence" Stanford has in this
county and I think that the
charges could be negotiated, if not
dropped.
2.Curtail if not eliminate the
Santa Clara Sheriffs'existence on
this campus. We already have the
campus security officers. I trust
them more than the "Green
Meanies", an actual term that
Stanford officers use among
themselves to refer to their Santa
Clara brethren.
3. End the University policy
"that we will cooperate with law
enforcement agencies in
controlling drug abuse." Why
should we? They are bad laws,
made by men with feeble minds.
We should all sign this
Marijuana Petition so we can vote
on it in November. Once, many
years ago, my friends and I used
to smoke dope freely in the
Donner Lounge. We even had a
stash under the couch there, for
anyone to get high on when he
wanted. 1 bet no one in Donner is
going to do that this quarter, and
it's too bad. Perhaps with a few
changes, we can all become more
relaxed around here.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I can recall clearly the pride I
felt at graduation and ROTC
commissioning ceremonies in
1960. Later I served as Executive
Officer and then reserve Battery
Commander of the California
National Guard Nike Hercules
Sites in Castro Valley and Pacifica
until 1964 when I resigned from
the Guard. For three years I
worked in nuclear weapons design
at U.C., Livermore, and remain
employed at Stanford today as an
engineering physicist.
Beginning with the Cambodian
adventure and now symbolised by
the latest bombing atrocities, that
pride has been totally twisted into
a deeply searing shame, a remorse
and disgust combined with
outrage at the calculated
brainwashing which was heaped
upon me in my years as a young
adult by my elders, teachers,

counselors, business and
government leaders whom I had
been taught to respect.
This deception persists today,
in particular with regard to the
bombing's likely results. Ask
yourself:
1. Why has the U.S. not
bombed civilian and military
targets in populated and port
areas before? It is because the
Soviet Union has made it clear
that they will not tolerate
destruction of their equipment or
the North Vietnamese ability to
survive. This explains why
Congressional leaders are referring
to the bombing as "god-damn
dangerous". They know things the
rest of us don't.
2. Why have the North
Vietnamese not turned a battery of
missiles onto American warships
just off their coast? It is common
knowledge that surface-to-air
missiles can often be converted
easily to this use. North Vietnam
has not because they knew the
U.S. would make heavy bombing
responses to the loss of American
sailors. Now Nixon has foreclosed
much of the need for their
restraint. The chips in Nixon's
poker game are thousands of
American seamen at the very next
level of response.
3. If American warships are
lost, will Nixon use nuclear
weapons or "bomb North
Vietnam back to the stone age?"
4. Will the Soviets allow that
humiliation to their commitment?
Would they destroy our entire
fleet with nuclear armed missiles
or submarines? It should be
pointed out that the reasons given
in the Congressional committee
for sharply curtailing construction
of massive new warships is that
they are indefensible against a
coordinated attack.
5. Finally, given a
missile/naval battle off the North
Vietnamese coast, are the
Pentagon or the Soviets willing to
transfer Nixon's policy of civilian
bombing into intercontinental
nuclear terms? It makes little
difference to the North
Vietnamese now whether the
"advanced" world destroys itself.
I believe that we are closer
today to incineration by nuclear
i

fire than ever before in history,
and that the Peninsula's
contribution to automated
warfare would make it a logical
enemy target by the same
reasoning that we used to destroy
German heavy industry. Whether
or not we make it through this
episode, we have all suffered a
crippling loss of respect for our
inert, numbed, impotent citizenry
and for ourselves. We take this
damage every day, brought on us
by a paranoid egomaniac
concerned only about his
re-election.
