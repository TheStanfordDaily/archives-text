# Group Plans Strike For Friday Morning
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
A group of over 600 crowded into
Cubberley Auditorium last night and
made plans to shut Stanford down
Friday morning as part of a national
student strike against the war in
Indochina.
The crowd, composed of students,
faculty, and some community people,
decided that they would make Encina
Hall, major classes, and Hansen Labs
primary targets for the Friday strike.
The strike will start with a mass
meeting in White Plaza at 6:30 a.m.
and the demonstrators will move out
from there.
Earlier, Tom Hayden, co-founder of
the Students for a Democratic Society
and one of the "Chicago Seven" who
were convicted on conspiracy charges
for inciting riots at the Democratic
Convention in 1968, showed slides of
the war in Vietnam. After the meeting,
95 protesters walked to the Hansen
Labs and back without incident.
About 30 riot-clad Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Deputies were
scattered around the campus last
night, and the marchers encountered
six of them at the Hansen Labs.
Nothing happened, though.
There was very little argument at
the meeting; whenever a dissident view
was put forth, the most general
response was to ignore it. Only one
person spoke against the general strike
and what little debate there was
centered around when the action
would begin.
At one point a speaker told the
crowd "The thing to be done to
show that we're against the war is to
move out. People should do their own
thing ... do some creative things with
windows." But he was met with a
resounding shout of "No!" from
almost everyone in the auditorium.
The group decided to have a
meeting of the Strike Coordinating
Committee at 9 this morning in the
Women's Center, and a teach-in at
noon in White Plaza that will move to
Hansen Labs later on.
One speaker announced a group
would try and shut down the Law
School at 12:15 p.m.
Today's strike activities will
conclude when students hook up with

a march from Palo Alto in the Wilbur
Hall parking lot at 7 p.m. The march is
scheduled to wind up at the Hansen
Labs.
Former ASSU Senate Chairman
Mike Dawson cautioned the crowd
that "a strike is not a voluntary
boycott. It is compulsory. We shut it
down even if some people don't want
it shut down."
There was never any question that
the group would endorse the strike
called by the National Student
Association and over 20 college
newspapers. At the end of Hayden's
slide show, there was two minutes'
worth of rhythmic clapping and
chanting "Strike! Strike! Strike!"
Royce was followed by a series of
speakers endorsing the strike.
Representatives from the Women's
Center, the Faculty Political Action
Group, the International Center,
Donner House, Muir House, and the
English Department claimed they
would support a strike on Friday.

scattered around the campus last
night, and the marchers encountered
six of them at the Hansen Labs.
Nothing happened, though.
There was very little argument at
the meeting; whenever a dissident view
was put forth, the most general
response was to ignore it. Only one
person spoke against the general strike
and what little debate there was
centered around when the action
would begin.
At one point a speaker told the
crowd "The thing to be done to
show that we're against the war is to
move out. People should do their own
thing ... do some creative things with
windows." But he was met with a
resounding shout of "No!" from
almost everyone in the auditorium.
The group decided to have a
meeting of the Strike Coordinating
Committee at 9 this morning in the
Women's Center, and a teach-in at
noon in White Plaza that will move to
Hansen Labs later on.
One speaker announced a group
would try and shut down the Law
School at 12:15 p.m.
Today's strike activities will
conclude when students hook up with

a march from Palo Alto in the Wilbur
Hall parking lot at 7 p.m. The march is
scheduled to wind up at the Hansen
Labs.
Former ASSU Senate Chairman
Mike Dawson cautioned the crowd
that "a strike is not a voluntary
boycott. It is compulsory. We shut it
down even if some people don't want
it shut down."
There was never any question that
the group would endorse the strike
called by the National Student
Association and over 20 college
newspapers. At the end of Hayden's
slide show, there was two minutes'
worth of rhythmic clapping and
chanting "Strike! Strike! Strike!"
Royce was followed by a series of
speakers endorsing the strike.
Representatives from the Women's
Center, the Faculty Political Action
Group, the International Center,
Donner House, Muir House, and the
English Department claimed they
would support a strike on Friday.

CHICAGO ONE—Tom Hayden, found guilty on conspiracy charges in the
Chicago Seven Case, spoke to an overflow crowd of 600 in Cubberley
Auditorium last night.
A group of over 600 crowded into
Cubberley Auditorium last night and
made plans to shut Stanford down
Friday morning as part of a national
student strike against the war in
Indochina.
The crowd, composed of students,
faculty, and some community people,
decided that they would make Encina
Hall, major classes, and Hansen Labs
primary targets for the Friday strike.
The strike will start with a mass
meeting in White Plaza at 6:30 a.m.
and the demonstrators will move out
from there.
Earlier, Tom Hayden, co-founder of
the Students for a Democratic Society
and one of the "Chicago Seven" who
were convicted on conspiracy charges
for inciting riots at the Democratic
Convention in 1968, showed slides of
the war in Vietnam. After the meeting,
95 protesters walked to the Hansen
Labs and back without incident.
About 30 riot-clad Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Deputies were
scattered around the campus last
night, and the marchers encountered
six of them at the Hansen Labs.
Nothing happened, though.
