## U.S. Pursues No-Compromise Policy

The recent deployments of
some 300 additional US planes
and of 14,000 more US troops
into combat in Vietnam follow a
long established pattern of US war
policy: when the military position
of the Republic of Vietnam(RVN)
government deteriorates, the US
steps up the war effort; when the
RVN seems to be holding up, the
US pursues aggressive diplomacy
and - takes an uncompromising
stand on negotiations.
Hence, it is clear that the US
Government is determined not to
seek a compromise solution in
Vietnam. Why? Daniel Ellsberg
has asserted that the prime
motivating factor in every
decision of the presidency
throughout the war is how to
avoid losing Indochina each year
or before the next congressional
and presidential election. The
problem with this formula is that
it doesn't tell the president when

to lose Vietnam and
consequently, he is forced to
juggle options long since tried and
failed. For this reason, Nixon
continues to support the
Vietnamization policy, though
clearly it is not succeeding.
The Peoples Liberation Armed
Forces (PLAF) have maintained a
three month effort in a series of
victories which has forced Thieu
to dispatch his best troops from
the Saigon region to the northern
front, to move the key ARVN
force defending the Mekong Delta
to the battle northwest of Saigon,
and to call up half the Presidential
Guard, designed for protection
against coups, for the battle
northwest of Saigon. All 60,000
of Thieu's forces are now involved
in the battle for Saigon. What
Nixon fears is that the Vietnamese
army cannot hold its own in the
south and so, his Vietnamized
army will fail.
As Nixon, cannot, due to
public dissent, commit sizeable
numbers of US ground troops in
the South and as the US forces do
not have sufficient power to give
tactical support to the ARVN's in
the South and to bomb the North
at the same time, Nixon has no
alternative but to use bombing as
a terror tactic in the North. Were
the Vietnamese dissidents not
terrorized, it is believed that such
dissident forces could assume
enough solidarity to overthrow
the Thieu regime and set up a
government of "national
concord" which would call for a
return to negotiation and peaceful
settlement. In the eyes of the
President and his "National
Security Managers" such
negotiation means defeat.
Political Effort
The current military effort is
political, not only abroad but also
within the US. The emphasis on a
short-run victory or the continued
postponement of the "loss" of
Vietnam and Indochina can be
understood briefly as Daniel
Ellsberg has put it: "A certain
faction of the Republican Party
seized on the vulnerability of the
Democratic administration that
happened to be in office during
the takeover of China by the
Communists. The results of that
taught a generation of bureaucrats
and politicians what could happen
to an administration that
happened to be in power when
Indochina fell to the
communists." (Ravenal, Peace
with China?, p. 130).
Richard Nixon, having been
one of the hounds at the backs of
the Democrats knows too well
what would be said and done were
he to fail in respect to Indochina
as Truman faltered with respect to
China. Further, the politics of
remaining in office force the
President to consider the
postponement of defeat ahead of
considerations for securing long
term goals which would involve
measures beyond deemed
"safe" in light of domestic
political constraints. Though
intelligence analyses tell the
president that he can't avoid
loosing the short-run effort
without investing much money
and effort, the president at the

same time realizes he can't tell
Congress that he is postponing the
loss until next November.
Hence, in asking for aid from
Congress, he must lie and say that
this much will be enough and at
the same time cross his fingers
that he can play the same game
when the next installment comes
due. Year after year it continues
to work. Such presidents and
"National Security Managers,"
believing they would be in bad
trouble with the American public
were they to lose Asia to
communism, have killed large
numbers of Asians and Americans,
destroyed Asian societies and
imperiled American society.
American Bureaucracy
Another reason for the
continued effort to escalate the
war lies in the nature of the
American bureaucratic system in
which contingency plans
continually set the terms for
debate. As Richard J. Barnet
indicates: "It is most unlikely that
President Nixon would have
ordered the sudden invasion of
Cambodia had the Joint Chiefs of
Staff not already worked out
detailed contingency plans. In a
crisis, real or imagined, the
President reaches for a plan."
(Washington Plans An Aggressive
War, p. 204)
Such contingency plans are the
systematic result of the personal
interests and intentions of the
National Security Managers. The
plans create a model of reality,
static, calculated, and objectively
removed from its personal
proponents, which prevents its
advocates from being able to
conceptually deal with
spontaneous political feeling or
the phenomenon of national
independence. Not only does this
model of reality mistake the facts
and prevent the understanding of
the politics of revolution but it
also necessitates two kinds of
commitments in order that it
work as a solution: 1) a
commitment to the sacrifice of
American lives as a concerete tool
for accomplishing militarily the
rationalized ends for what Nixon
calls "a generation of peace"; and
2) an identification of national
leaders with the national interest
to the extent that conflict is
understood as a personal joust
between leaders.
The ideological model of
reality does not allow the
President to act for reasons of his
own; rather, he acts in accordance
with the role cut out for him as
the defender of the national
interest. A leader develops an
egocentric view of the world
considering other contries to be
largely America's sparring
partners. Hence, the presidency
announces "I will not be defeated
in Vietnam." The meaning of the
phrasp"Youdonotwanttobe the
first President to lose a war" is all
too clear as the foretelling of

political disaster beyond
comprehension to one * who
believes he alone guides the
interests of the US and so, the
world.
Absolves Responsibility
Finally, the bureaucratic model
of reality envelopes the violence
and pride of its leaders in language
and ideology designed to absolve
them from personal responsibility.
The President is all too aware that
he will never know but a fraction
of what his subordinate agents do
in the name of the administration
every day. But such subordinates
know that their positions depend
on their advising and reinforcing
the president's prejudices. Loyalty
to the nation is loyalty to the
President.
To inculcate this kind of
loyalty, the US spends years of
training the actors in the Vietnam
tragedy what they have been
payed and praised for doing.
Acting under duty, the actors use
terms such as "surgical strike" for
mowing down peasants from the
air by spraying them with 8,000
bullets a minute, and "nukes" for
instruments that kill and mutilate
millions of human beings. Such
terms relieve one from the pain of
his violent decision. A systematic
lethal technology looks for the
simplest means to achieve its
ends: it takes much less time to
kill a man than to change his mind
or change one's own mind.
Further, by keeping a leader's
eye on the facts interpreted by
the bureaucratic model of reality,
men like McNamara are never able
to get close enough to another
society to feel a relationship with
it; they can only count things in
it.
As long as the President and
other such "global managers"
envision their power as resting on
their reputation for being able to
manipulate events in accordance
with the available theories put
forth by the bureaucracy, violence
will increase in an effort to hold
the weaker countries. But
ultimately, violence cannot
substitute for real power that
must be based on political
understanding. This violent
mistake on the part of American
leaders will undo the imperial
game, for no grand design put
forward by the great documents
of the Cold War can posit a
way to victory without paying too
high a price.
The game is not over, it is
simply obsolete. In the current
escalation effort the options of
bombing the harbor at Haiphong
through which comes Russian aid
and the direct attack on Hanoi
have both been discussed publicly
in Washington. Because both
options would involve the US in a
wider war with Russia and China,
these plans have been rejected in

I the past, according to the
Pentagon Papers.
Nixon Desperate
But Nixon is desperate. He has
bombed Haiphong. Having gone
to China, he will go to Moscow in
May. In both places he looks for a
Vietnamese compromise. But
though the Vietnamese have
accepted aid from both China and
Russia when they needed it, they
are still determined, according to
Peggy Duff, editor of the Vietnam
International who has just
returned from North Vietnam,
not to be involved in another
international peace conference.
The Vietnamese now refuse to
have others decide for them.
The Peoples Liberation Armed
Forces have the guns and the
POW's; Nixon can't go to Russia
or China to negotiate the war, he
must go to the Vietnamese. This
he has done with the message that
any towns in South Vietnam
which are liberated can expect to
suffer the same fat as Vinh, Ben
Tre and Squol did during the
1968 Tet offensive: "we had to
destroy it to save it." The price
the Vietnamese will pay according
to plan is total destruction if
Thieu and Vietnamization are
defeated.
But the cold fact that doesn't
fit into "the grand design" is that
in order to destroy Vietnam, the
presidency and his "National
Security Managers" will have to
kill every single peasant in
Vietnam. And behind them stand
the peasants of Laos, Cambodia
and the rest of Indochina. The
Vietnamese have been fighting
foreign invaders for almost 2,000
years and it is plain that the US
planned escalation can be no more
effective now against the depth of
nationalist feeling than it has in
the past.
Power Politics
Finally, it is also time for the
American public to show that this
kind of power politics will not
work at home either, that
consensus-from-above according
to a bureaucratic model of reality
is a form of politics Americans are
no longer willing to accept, that
Americans are tired of "systems
of absolution which serve to stand
ordinary principles of private
morality on their head and to
transform reasonably law abiding
professors and bankers into
killers." (Barnet, p. 245)
American bombing and
American aid hold up Nixon's
Vietnamization program.
American citizens must launch
campaigns against both. The
Thieu regime cannot survive
without them. If the Thieu regime
falls there is a chance for a
peaceful negotiation with the
Vietnamese.
