# Lyman Writes Nixon On Indochina War
## 
### 
Mr. President:
May I add one more citizen's voice to the expressions of dismay
and outrage at seeing you return to the discredited policies of the
1966-67 period, in which it was expected that heavy bombing of
North Vietnam would bring the war closer to a conclusion?
The lessons of every war since massive bombings from the air
became a technological possibility point in the same direction: it does
not provide a conclusive weapon militarily, and it tends to reinforce
the will-to-win of the enemy against whom it is practiced.
Today's paper carries the following: " 'There's a heavy dose of
diplomacy involved in the Hanoi-Haiphong strikes,' one Pentagon
official said." (San Francisco Chronicle, 4/17/72)
I wonder why, given past failures of this strategy of bludgeoning
the enemy into showing up for meaningful negotiations, anyone in the
Administration sees promise in such a policy. I also wonder how the
civilians in those cities feel about such methods of "diplomacy."
The most charitable explanation of the return to bombing of North
Vietnam is fear for the safety of American soldiers in the South in the
event of a South Vietnamese collapse. The only way that we are going
to bring such fear to an end is to withdraw those troops immediately.
At present they constitute hostages for the safety of the Thieu regime.
The danger, inhumanity, and folly of putting American troops into
such a role could hardly be more starkly exposed than by current
developments in Vietnam.
