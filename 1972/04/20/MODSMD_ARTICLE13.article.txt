## Campus A Feudal Estate

Given the robber-baron cultural tastes of the
Stan fords, their son's memorial could not have
resulted in anything but a feudal estate. From the
monstrous arch to the garish church, the original
Stanford quad was an attempt to bring European
grandiosity to the mid-Peninsula.
It is ironic that the quad's design was inspired
somewhat by the Alhambra in Granada, Spain.One
of the most spectacular edifices in Spain, the
Alhambra was a last ditch attempt by a harried
Moorish dynasty to maintain a tenuous foothold in
a once glorious and lucrative kingdom. Similarly,
the Stanford quad was designed to exhibit wealth
and thereby command respect.
As the original architects would have it, one first
enters Stanford along Palm Drive, and is forced to
stare at what appears to be the palace of His Royal
Highness. As one nears the quad, one expects to see
large black limousines circling the oval discharging
passengers for an audience with the reincarnated
Leland Sr. Fortunately the earthquake rid us of the
Imperial Gateway, the Triumphal Arch and the
spires of Saint Leland's, but the aspect of a palatial
facade still greets the visitor to Stanford.
In recognition of the divine right of kings, the
church mosaic bears a curious resemblance to the
photo of Leland Sr. driving the last spike on the
Union Pacific and gives the impression of being an
evangelical billboard. On each corner of the quad
stands a cylindrical tower, wherein conspiring and
disruptive professors await the guillotine.
Approaching the quad and strolling through it, a

visitor might think that the developers of Lake
Havasu City have transplanted not only London
Bridge to Arizona, but St. George's castle to Palo
Alto as well.
As the kingdom has built up around the palace
quad, so has the aspect of feudal architecture. To
the southeast stands the domain of Merlin and his
libraries of black books. One library employs the
use of an enormous phallic tower to facilitate
communication with heavenly spirits, while another
library appears to have wings and houses the
volumes on witchcraft. Merlin's largest library is
square, dumpy and houses a thousand tiny trolls
who scurry about its narrow passageways and dusty
shelves researching herbicidal potions.
To the northwest of the palace sits the War
Minister and his domain of generals and weapons
scientists. The Army barracks are long, low
buildings bordering the palace. In the center there
appears to be a petroleum storage tank, but in
reality it is a camouflaged debriefing room. At the
end of the barracks area is the new glass and steel
nerve center of military operations. Placed
strategically around a paved courtyard (to prevent
tunneling infilitrators) the three buildings are close
enough to that valiant swordsmen may jump from
one to another should the center be attacked.
And of course surround the entire kingdom are
the closely packed quarters of the serfs who daily
converge for arduous labors in the glory of the
deceased prince.
