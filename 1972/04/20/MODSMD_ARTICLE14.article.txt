## Recruitment Policy Defended 
### 
Steven g. ungar

March 28, 1972, the Daily
printed excerpts of a letter that I
wrote to President Lyman on the
issue of Placement Center policy.
The letter was run under the
headline "Open Recruiting
Important." The fact that it had
been rather severely edited was
not mentioned.
While I do not wish to drag this
out forever, I feel that the editing,
although in the main judicious
and proper, did tend to
misrepresent my opinions to a
certain extent. Since at least one
reader, Visiting Professor Philip K.
Bock, felt strongly enough about
the contents as printed to respond
with a letter of his own, I should
like to set the record straight
about certain ambiguities which
may exist.
Deletion of the penultimate
paragraph of my original letter
may have left the reader with the
impression that I had been forced
by circumstances to take
employment with a company
whose "social policies, politics
and products I found very
disagreeable." This is not the case.
I am in independent research at a
NASA laboratory, supported by a
grant from the National Academy
of Sciences, working on a project
of my own choosing
Trust Judgment
The thrust of my argument,
which may have been obscured by
the deletions, was that we must
trust the student seeking

employment to offer his services
to organizations which he feels are
moraJly suitable. The shortage of
job opportunities may result in his
stretching the definition of
"morally suitable," as indeed I
found to be the case for myself
when I was suddenly threatened
with imminent unemployment.
This is a perfectly natural, and
I would hope understandable,
human weakness. But it is one
that we must live with, for to
allow a group of politically
commited activists to arbitrate the
moral standards of presumably
mature individuals is not only
insulting but dangerous, for it
establishes a precedent for ethical
bullying that can easily spread to
other areas of community life.
I may be an insufferable elitist,
but I feel it is safer to trust the
judgment of an individual holding
an advanced degree to decide how
to go about his own business, than
to allow Venceremos or Columbae
House or any other group of
highly motivated but
technologically incompetent
persons to decide it for him.
Ignore ASSU
In response to the letter of
Professor Bock, which appeared in
the Daily on March 31: I admire
the graduate science and
engineering students for their
political sophistication in ignoring
the ASSU. The Senate and
Council of Presidents are as
politically potent as any other

financially bankrupt government;
graduate students have better
things to do.
Professor Bock states that "if
recruiting highly trained technical
personnel is not part of 'business'
for a corporation, 1 don't know
what is."
I tend to have a more restricted
definition of "business" than does
Professor Bock. Recruiting is
certainly no more "business" than
is sending a public relations expert
to debate with protesters. If we
allow the latter, and Placement
Center demonstrators say they
would, then we cannot exclude
the former solely on the grounds
of not permitting a corporation to
carry on "business" on University
property.
If we stretch the meaning of
the word to cover recruiting, it
must also cover other secondary
activities, such as public relations;
if we then ban recruiting on the
ground, we are also forced to ban
company representatives from
debating company policy on
University property.
Sense of Humor
Finally, I should like to assure
Professor Bock that I have not
lost my sense of humor or my

moral perspective since leaving
Stanford. I know that my sense of
humor is intact because I read an
interview with Doug McHenry in
The New York 77mes last week
and I am still giggling. As for my
moral perspective, I am still trying
to accept the Code of
Hammurabi, after which I hope to
tackle the Ten Commandments,
one at a time.
Professor Bock says he was
"very sad" to read my letter.
Don't be. Cheer up, old fellow.
The forces of Good shall triumph,
and with any luck we shall figure
out who they are before it's too
late to change sides.
