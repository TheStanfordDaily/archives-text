April 22 March
The time has come for the
mass of people at Stanford —
faculty, students and workers (the
administration is probably too far
gone) ~ to begin taking actions to
stop the continuing U.S. war in
Asia. What can we do?
On April 22 there will be a
march in San Francisco and a rally
at Kezar Stadium. Rember that
one day and one town filled to
the brim with people could make
the difference. The term "masses"
means little except when suddenly
from everywhere people come
together under one banner. On
the 22nd, that banner will be U.S.
acceptance of the 7-point
National liberation Front peace
proposal and an end to the
domestic economic consequences
of the war. This is the only way
the war can end; only by the war
ending will the conomic situation
even have a chance of getting
better.
This is a critical moment in
U.S. policy. Though everyone is
disillusioned and cynical and
defeatist, we must shake it off and
examine what's to be done. We
can all begin by taking part —

helping organize, making financial
contributions, or simply attending
the April 22 mass
demonstration. The more people
who make a committment to
attend, the more limitless the
possibilities for success. In politics
people count and have the final
say. Help organize your friends
(or at least talk about it) and
make the April 22 demonstration
a powerful weapon in attacking
the U.S. war in Asia.

Strike
Editor, THE DAILY:
Needless to say, the bombing
of North Vietnam is an
international as well as a domestic
concern. This is not a time to
condemn the tactics of those who
are concerned about the
escalation. There has been a call
for a national student strike and
we feel that student effort should
be concentrated in endorsing and
participating in that strike. That is
the only way that the U.S.
government will realize that a
mass of people not only protest
the escalation, but also protest the
existence of the war.
Although we feel that the
national student strike should not
be one directed against the
University, we do feel that during
the strike the administration of
the University should re-examine
the activities within the
University. We urge President
Lyman to recognize that the
research and war recruiting going
on at Stanford are directly related
to, and contributed to, the war
and that their cessation can be
proof that neither Stanford nor its
administration suppport the war
effort.
Although we would hope that
all those connected with Stanford
University — workers, staff,
administration, and faculty — will
support the student strike we
specifically urge all students to do
so.

Outraged
Editor,THE DAILY:
We an? outraged by the vicious
escalation of the war by the
Nixon administration and are
ashamed that, in our name, our
government has unleased the most
destructive war machine in the
history of the world upon a small
nation fighting for its freedom.
We condemn especially the
bombing of the civilian
populations of Hanoi and
Haiphong.
We support a strike of the
University Friday to stop the war
business of Stanford University
and to free Stanford workers,
students, and faculty to take
direct action against the war. We
urge that the strike continue as
long as it is productive.

Indefinite Strike
Editor,THE DAILY:
In a house meeting on
Tuesday, April 18, Serra House
(Stern Hall) voted to support the
following statement: "A majority
of Serra residents support the
student strike in response to the
bombing of North Vietnam."
Two alternatives were then
offered. One supported the strike
but did not offer a time limit. The
latter passed by a margin of thirty
votes. (35-5)
We urge other houses to
support the strike and to post the
results of house or living group
meetings in the Women's Center
which is located in the Women's
Clubhouse and is now serving as
Strike Headquarters.

No Justification
Editor, THE DAILY:
The behavior of the

demonstrators who trashed
campus buildings Monday night
upsets me a great deal. There is no
philosophical justification for this
behavior, for by embracing
violence and destruction these
demonstrators have sunk to the
same moral level as President
Nixon. There is no tactical
justification for this behavior, for
surely no politician will ever be
influenced by broken windowns.
There is no strategic justification
for this behavior since it only
serves to alienate potential
converts to radical (or even
liberal) ideas.
The only justification for this
behavior is psychological; if a
person feels anxious, frustrated,
tense, or restless; then throwing a
rock through a window may give
him a temporary feeling of
satisfaction.

Follow Jesus
Editor,THE DAILY:
We believe that the basic iss.ue
of the war in Southeast Asia and
the campus demonstration against
it cannot be dealt with fully until
one point is made clear. The root
of the problem is not in that
nebulous designation "the United
States of America" but in the
hearts of each one of us.
We follow Jesus, not angry
crowds. We follow .Jesus because
we know that He offers the
solution to our world's problems.
It is not until we have heeded the
imperative to follow Him that we
can reach out to the world around
us, a world we all can see is in
desperate need of help.
"To follow Jesus" — what does
this imply? It means that we
boastful, self-centered persons
have recognized God's love and
claim Him as Lord of our lives.
It is not until each of us is
cleansed inside that we can be
effective instruments of change in
society. Ultimately it will not be
we who do the changing, but the
love of Christ shining through us.
