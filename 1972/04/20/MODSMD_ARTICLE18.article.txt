# Class Of '76 Reacts To Admission
## 
### ELLEN SWANBERG 
On Saturday, April 15, many
high school seniors found out
whether they will be going to
Stanford next year. But those
who are accepted may not know
what they're getting into.
Most high school seniors are
confident of Stanford's virtues.
They are eager to enjoy the
"liberal atmosphere," the "good
setting," and the "superior
reputation" which await them.
The high school seniors are
certain of the high quality of the
student body. "Stanford takes
only the best students," one
Woodside High School senior
affirmed, "mostly the
intellectuals."
Most current Stanford
freshmen, though, admit they had
their fellow students stereotyped
before they came. A local student
expected "more freaks,
more bohemians, and more rads. I

thought there'd be more creative
intellectuals and artistic types."
She finds the student population
"pretty straight."
Another freshman had
anticipated "a more conservative
and bookwormish" student body.
Students Open-Minded
The freshman year involves a
closer evaluation of fellow
students. "Students are more
open than I thought they'd be.
They're not so snobbish,"
reflected a Flo Mo resident.
While most high school seniors
aiming for Stanford envision a
highly intelligent, sophisticated
student body, at least one group
of freshmen has more severe
critical insight into their fellow
students.
"They are much less mature
than I expected," said one. "A lot
of them behave like 12-year olds."
Aspiring seniors are not

discouraged upon hearing that
"freshmen get stuck with a lot of
inexperienced TAs." But they're
sure that "Stanford has lots of
money, and lots of money can
buy good professors."
One freshman expressed a
popular view: "The professors are
not quite as elite and intelligent as
I thought they'd be. But they are
not as friendly as they should be,
not to freshmen, anyway."
That outstanding professors
operate on a remotely elevated
academic level is cited as reason
for anylack of faculty-student
interrelationships.
Experts Talk Down
"It's hard for most of the
Nobel laureates in the science
departments to talk down to our
level," a student observed.
Another described professors as
simply "out in their own world."
One popular attitude of the
high school hopefuls is that classes
are not demanding. "I've heard
they're fairly easy," one testified.
"Besides, if you can get in, you
have a good chance of not having
too hard a time."
Another Woodside senior
claimed, "You don't have to do a
lot of work there. You can't flunk
out. Just be alive to graduate." He
summarized Stanford as "the
easiest of the hard schools."
A majority of freshmen agree
that classes are not too difficult.
"We had harder papers and harder
teachers in high school" is a
frequent remark.
However, one student
expressed relief that "the classes
weren't any harder than they
were." He added, "not one
minute of time is wasted."
Dreamworld In Bulletin
High school students read in
their University Bulletin that the
school atmosphere is "competitive
and challenging but at the same
time unstructured and informal.
Students share in the
achievements of their professors
and of each other. The
encouragement and the challenge
is there ... the Stanford student
normally responds in a positive,

self-fulfilling way, not as a result
of external pressure but of inner
motivation and desire."
But freshmen sense the strong
external significance of the grade.
"It's true that people are more
concerned with grades than I
thought," noted one. "There's a
lot of competition."
Some found they had an
overly-idealistic image of classes.
One student from the Bay area
felt he "had the usual visions —
that classes would always be great
here, that every course would be a
challenging one to just fire you up
and make you want more." He
estimated that in the past two
quarters, he had one such course.
One Wilbur resident said he
took the college catalogues
literally and expected to see
"around 15" in more of his
classes. "But first quarter I had
some pretty big classes. There
were 250 in my Chem class."
Concerning campus politics,
the Bulletin states: "Like citizens
outside the University, the
students and faculty at Stanford
are concerned about national and
international issues and crises and
given expression to their concern
by voting, attending meetings,
knocking on doors, and endorsing
candidates or causes."
But many freshmen sense a
lack of political activity on
campus. "I'm surprised that
people aren't as active as I
thought," said one. "I didn't
think it would be this bad."
Some felt this is a
characteristic of their class, or
that of the general mass of
younger dollege students. "We
were told it was a more
conservative group," confirmed a
freshman.
Said another freshman, "I
wouldn't want it any more
political than it is, or I'd have to
get a bayonet out."
Freshmen hold differing views
as to the extent of campus
diversity.
The Bulletin explains that "the
University is a unique experience;
it is more than red tile roofs and

sandstone buildings. It is a blend
of opportunities, a combination
of resources, a smorgasbord of
events, lectures, discussions,
buildings and people."
Many students expected the
campus to be "a lot more lively."
Said one, "I envisioned students
doing a lot more different things.
There isn't much going on."
Howeve:, others do notice a
smorgasboard of opportunity.
"There are more choices for
things to do. There is so much
here, and it all contributes to your
education," applauded one
freshman.
Reasons for Applying
There are more specific
considerations than the quality
and variety of Stanford which
lead high school seniors to apply.
"Both my brothers went; both
my parents went" is justification
enough for one student.
These remarks are made
without the knowledge of the
trivial but influential niceties of
campus life. "The food is lousy,"
"the school costs too much," and
"you can't study in the dorm with
all that music going" are
comments that can only emerge
from practical experience.
Ideas about the opposite sex,
too, can be overblown. Some
disenchanted men felt
shortchanged after expecting to
find the "California blondes —
you know, the real nice blondes"
adorning Stanford. Apparently
they don't exist, "at least not
here," one still-hopeful male said.
The freshmen students'
composite view of the University
is generally favorable. One student
described her first impression: "I
thought it was really a far-out
place. I couldn't find anything
wrong with it at all."
But her outlook sobered as "I
saw that the basis of the
University is far away from what
it should be. Money is coming
from the wrong places, and its
being run by people it shouldn't
be run by." However, she
concluded, "it's still really a
beautiful sort of paradise."

for anylack of faculty-student
interrelationships.
Experts Talk Down
"It's hard for most of the
Nobel laureates in the science
departments to talk down to our
level," a student observed.
Another described professors as
simply "out in their own world."
One popular attitude of the
high school hopefuls is that classes
are not demanding. "I've heard
they're fairly easy," one testified.
"Besides, if you can get in, you
have a good chance of not having
too hard a time."
Another Woodside senior
claimed, "You don't have to do a
lot of work there. You can't flunk
out. Just be alive to graduate." He
summarized Stanford as "the
easiest of the hard schools."
A majority of freshmen agree
that classes are not too difficult.
"We had harder papers and harder
teachers in high school" is a
frequent remark.
However, one student
expressed relief that "the classes
weren't any harder than they
were." He added, "not one
minute of time is wasted."
Dreamworld In Bulletin
High school students read in
their University Bulletin that the
school atmosphere is "competitive
and challenging but at the same
time unstructured and informal.
Students share in the
achievements of their professors
and of each other. The
encouragement and the challenge
is there ... the Stanford student
normally responds in a positive,

self-fulfilling way, not as a result
of external pressure but of inner
motivation and desire."
But freshmen sense the strong
external significance of the grade.
"It's true that people are more
concerned with grades than I
thought," noted one. "There's a
lot of competition."
Some found they had an
overly-idealistic image of classes.
One student from the Bay area
felt he "had the usual visions —
that classes would always be great
here, that every course would be a
challenging one to just fire you up
and make you want more." He
estimated that in the past two
quarters, he had one such course.
One Wilbur resident said he
took the college catalogues
literally and expected to see
"around 15" in more of his
classes. "But first quarter I had
some pretty big classes. There
were 250 in my Chem class."
Concerning campus politics,
the Bulletin states: "Like citizens
outside the University, the
students and faculty at Stanford
are concerned about national and
international issues and crises and
given expression to their concern
by voting, attending meetings,
knocking on doors, and endorsing
candidates or causes."
But many freshmen sense a
lack of political activity on
campus. "I'm surprised that
people aren't as active as I
thought," said one. "I didn't
think it would be this bad."
Some felt this is a
characteristic of their class, or
that of the general mass of
younger dollege students. "We
were told it was a more
conservative group," confirmed a
freshman.
Said another freshman, "I
wouldn't want it any more
political than it is, or I'd have to
get a bayonet out."
Freshmen hold differing views
as to the extent of campus
diversity.
The Bulletin explains that "the
University is a unique experience;
it is more than red tile roofs and

sandstone buildings. It is a blend
of opportunities, a combination
of resources, a smorgasbord of
events, lectures, discussions,
buildings and people."
Many students expected the
campus to be "a lot more lively."
Said one, "I envisioned students
doing a lot more different things.
There isn't much going on."
Howeve:, others do notice a
smorgasboard of opportunity.
"There are more choices for
things to do. There is so much
here, and it all contributes to your
education," applauded one
freshman.
Reasons for Applying
There are more specific
considerations than the quality
and variety of Stanford which
lead high school seniors to apply.
"Both my brothers went; both
my parents went" is justification
enough for one student.
These remarks are made
without the knowledge of the
trivial but influential niceties of
campus life. "The food is lousy,"
"the school costs too much," and
"you can't study in the dorm with
all that music going" are
comments that can only emerge
from practical experience.
Ideas about the opposite sex,
too, can be overblown. Some
disenchanted men felt
shortchanged after expecting to
find the "California blondes —
you know, the real nice blondes"
adorning Stanford. Apparently
they don't exist, "at least not
here," one still-hopeful male said.
The freshmen students'
composite view of the University
is generally favorable. One student
described her first impression: "I
thought it was really a far-out
place. I couldn't find anything
wrong with it at all."
But her outlook sobered as "I
saw that the basis of the
University is far away from what
it should be. Money is coming
from the wrong places, and its
being run by people it shouldn't
be run by." However, she
concluded, "it's still really a
beautiful sort of paradise."

SAN FRANCISCO FlRE—Smoke pours from an apartment house fire
in downtown San Francisco yesterday. The fire, visible for miles, did
major damage to the building.
On Saturday, April 15, many
high school seniors found out
whether they will be going to
Stanford next year. But those
who are accepted may not know
what they're getting into.
Most high school seniors are
confident of Stanford's virtues.
They are eager to enjoy the
"liberal atmosphere," the "good
setting," and the "superior
reputation" which await them.
The high school seniors are
certain of the high quality of the
student body. "Stanford takes
only the best students," one
Woodside High School senior
affirmed, "mostly the
intellectuals."
Most current Stanford
freshmen, though, admit they had
their fellow students stereotyped
before they came. A local student
expected "more freaks,
more bohemians, and more rads. I

thought there'd be more creative
intellectuals and artistic types."
She finds the student population
"pretty straight."
Another freshman had
anticipated "a more conservative
and bookwormish" student body.
Students Open-Minded
The freshman year involves a
closer evaluation of fellow
students. "Students are more
open than I thought they'd be.
They're not so snobbish,"
reflected a Flo Mo resident.
While most high school seniors
aiming for Stanford envision a
highly intelligent, sophisticated
student body, at least one group
of freshmen has more severe
critical insight into their fellow
students.
"They are much less mature
than I expected," said one. "A lot
of them behave like 12-year olds."
Aspiring seniors are not

discouraged upon hearing that
"freshmen get stuck with a lot of
inexperienced TAs." But they're
sure that "Stanford has lots of
money, and lots of money can
buy good professors."
One freshman expressed a
popular view: "The professors are
not quite as elite and intelligent as
I thought they'd be. But they are
not as friendly as they should be,
not to freshmen, anyway."
That outstanding professors
operate on a remotely elevated
academic level is cited as reason
for anylack of faculty-student
interrelationships.

took the college catalogues
literally and expected to see
"around 15" in more of his
classes. "But first quarter I had
some pretty big classes. There
were 250 in my Chem class."
Concerning campus politics,
the Bulletin states: "Like citizens
outside the University, the
students and faculty at Stanford
are concerned about national and
international issues and crises and
given expression to their concern
by voting, attending meetings,
knocking on doors, and endorsing
candidates or causes."
But many freshmen sense a
lack of political activity on
campus. "I'm surprised that
people aren't as active as I
thought," said one. "I didn't
think it would be this bad."
Some felt this is a
characteristic of their class, or
that of the general mass of
younger dollege students. "We
were told it was a more
conservative group," confirmed a
freshman.
Said another freshman, "I
wouldn't want it any more
political than it is, or I'd have to
get a bayonet out."
Freshmen hold differing views
as to the extent of campus
diversity.
The Bulletin explains that "the
University is a unique experience;
it is more than red tile roofs and

sandstone buildings. It is a blend
of opportunities, a combination
of resources, a smorgasbord of
events, lectures, discussions,
buildings and people."
Many students expected the
campus to be "a lot more lively."
Said one, "I envisioned students
doing a lot more different things.
There isn't much going on."
Howeve:, others do notice a
smorgasboard of opportunity.
"There are more choices for
things to do. There is so much
here, and it all contributes to your
education," applauded one
freshman.
Reasons for Applying
There are more specific
considerations than the quality
and variety of Stanford which
lead high school seniors to apply.
"Both my brothers went; both
my parents went" is justification
enough for one student.
These remarks are made
without the knowledge of the
trivial but influential niceties of
campus life. "The food is lousy,"
"the school costs too much," and
"you can't study in the dorm with
all that music going" are
comments that can only emerge
from practical experience.
Ideas about the opposite sex,
too, can be overblown. Some
disenchanted men felt
shortchanged after expecting to
find the "California blondes —
you know, the real nice blondes"
adorning Stanford. Apparently
they don't exist, "at least not
here," one still-hopeful male said.
The freshmen students'
composite view of the University
is generally favorable. One student
described her first impression: "I
thought it was really a far-out
place. I couldn't find anything
wrong with it at all."
But her outlook sobered as "I
saw that the basis of the
University is far away from what
it should be. Money is coming
from the wrong places, and its
being run by people it shouldn't
be run by." However, she
concluded, "it's still really a
beautiful sort of paradise."

SAN FRANCISCO FlRE—Smoke pours from an apartment house fire
in downtown San Francisco yesterday. The fire, visible for miles, did
major damage to the building.
On Saturday, April 15, many
high school seniors found out
whether they will be going to
Stanford next year. But those
who are accepted may not know
what they're getting into.
Most high school seniors are
confident of Stanford's virtues.
They are eager to enjoy the
"liberal atmosphere," the "good
setting," and the "superior
reputation" which await them.
The high school seniors are
certain of the high quality of the
student body. "Stanford takes
only the best students," one
Woodside High School senior
affirmed, "mostly the
intellectuals."
Most current Stanford
freshmen, though, admit they had
their fellow students stereotyped
before they came. A local student
expected "more freaks,
more bohemians, and more rads. I

thought there'd be more creative
intellectuals and artistic types."
She finds the student population
"pretty straight."
Another freshman had
anticipated "a more conservative
and bookwormish" student body.
Students Open-Minded
The freshman year involves a
closer evaluation of fellow
students. "Students are more
open than I thought they'd be.
They're not so snobbish,"
reflected a Flo Mo resident.
While most high school seniors
aiming for Stanford envision a
highly intelligent, sophisticated
student body, at least one group
of freshmen has more severe
critical insight into their fellow
students.
"They are much less mature
than I expected," said one. "A lot
of them behave like 12-year olds."
Aspiring seniors are not

discouraged upon hearing that
"freshmen get stuck with a lot of
inexperienced TAs." But they're
sure that "Stanford has lots of
money, and lots of money can
buy good professors."
One freshman expressed a
popular view: "The professors are
not quite as elite and intelligent as
I thought they'd be. But they are
not as friendly as they should be,
not to freshmen, anyway."
That outstanding professors
operate on a remotely elevated
academic level is cited as reason
for anylack of faculty-student
interrelationships.
Experts Talk Down
"It's hard for most of the
Nobel laureates in the science
departments to talk down to our
level," a student observed.
Another described professors as
simply "out in their own world."
One popular attitude of the
high school hopefuls is that classes
are not demanding. "I've heard
they're fairly easy," one testified.
"Besides, if you can get in, you
have a good chance of not having
too hard a time."
Another Woodside senior
claimed, "You don't have to do a
lot of work there. You can't flunk
out. Just be alive to graduate." He
summarized Stanford as "the
easiest of the hard schools."
A majority of freshmen agree
that classes are not too difficult.
"We had harder papers and harder
teachers in high school" is a
frequent remark.
However, one student
expressed relief that "the classes
weren't any harder than they
were." He added, "not one
minute of time is wasted."
Dreamworld In Bulletin
High school students read in
their University Bulletin that the
school atmosphere is "competitive
and challenging but at the same
time unstructured and informal.
Students share in the
achievements of their professors
and of each other. The
encouragement and the challenge
is there ... the Stanford student
normally responds in a positive,

self-fulfilling way, not as a result
of external pressure but of inner
motivation and desire."
But freshmen sense the strong
external significance of the grade.
"It's true that people are more
concerned with grades than I
thought," noted one. "There's a
lot of competition."
Some found they had an
overly-idealistic image of classes.
One student from the Bay area
felt he "had the usual visions —
that classes would always be great
here, that every course would be a
challenging one to just fire you up
and make you want more." He
estimated that in the past two
quarters, he had one such course.
One Wilbur resident said he
took the college catalogues
literally and expected to see
"around 15" in more of his
classes. "But first quarter I had
some pretty big classes. There
were 250 in my Chem class."

trivial but influential niceties of
campus life. "The food is lousy,"
"the school costs too much," and
"you can't study in the dorm with
all that music going" are
comments that can only emerge
from practical experience.
Ideas about the opposite sex,
too, can be overblown. Some
disenchanted men felt
shortchanged after expecting to
find the "California blondes —
you know, the real nice blondes"
adorning Stanford. Apparently
they don't exist, "at least not
here," one still-hopeful male said.
The freshmen students'
composite view of the University
is generally favorable. One student
described her first impression: "I
thought it was really a far-out
place. I couldn't find anything
wrong with it at all."
But her outlook sobered as "I
saw that the basis of the
University is far away from what
it should be. Money is coming
from the wrong places, and its
being run by people it shouldn't
be run by." However, she
concluded, "it's still really a
beautiful sort of paradise."
