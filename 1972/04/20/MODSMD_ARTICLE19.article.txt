# Pre-Meds Build MD Contacts

### ANDY ISRAEL 
Stanford pre-meds need no
longer ask "What's up Doc?"
They can find out for themselves.
The Stanford University School
of Medicine, in conjunction with
the Academic Information Center,
has established a program allowing
pre-meds to spend time with
doctors to better understand the
nature of medicine and what a
doctor does in his daily routine.
While students have always
been able to spend time with
doctors, either through personal
contacts or the pre-medical
society's "Day with a Doctor"
program, the new opportunities
for pre-meds represent the first
ongoing program of medical
school contact available to
pre-meds.
Bob Debs a graduate in
Humanities Special Programs, was
the moving force behind
establishing the new program.
A post-graduation job writing
reports for the Provost's office
brought Debs into contact with
doctors at the Medical Center who
were often willing to take him
along during their daily work.
Personal Insight
His interest in medicine grew as
a result of these personal insights
into the nature of medical
practice, and Debs has now gone
back and completed his pre-med
requirements in anticipation of
applying to medical school next
year.
In the course of these

encounters with doctors, Debs
decided that pre-meds would
benefit from such contacts and
contacted the Academic
Information Center about the
possibility of setting up a new
program.
The rationale for establishing
such an opportunity according to
Debs is that "if people want to see
what medicine is, they have to
come where medicine is
practiced."
Provide Incentive
He observed that v "pre-med
currieulums can really destroy
motivation, and that contact with
the actual practice of medicine
can re-kindle flagging spirits and
provide a new reason to work."
In addition, pre-meds
confrontations with doctors tend
to "eliminate the alienation of the
medical person and the pre-med,"
says Debs.
Presently the Departments of
Pa thology, Neurology, and
Medicine at the Stanford Medical
School and the Department of
Radiology at the Veteran's
Administration Hospital are
participating in the program.
Students are welcome to attend
Surgical Pathological Conferences,
A u to ps y Demonstrations
Research Seminars, and
Fundamentals of Laboratory
Medicine Rounds in the
Department of Pathology.
The Department of Medicine
offers General Medical Clinic and
Patient Workup Experiences.

Grand Rounds and Ward
rounds in the Department of
Neurology are open to students,
and group tours in the
Department of Radiology at the
VA Hospital are also available.
Signups for any of these
opportunities are made through
the Academic Information Center
in the Old Union, where students
can inquire about times and
locations of the meetings.
Strong Reaction
The reaction to the program
has been strong but not
overwhelming. Seven hundred
flyers were sent out last quarter to
people who had registered with
the AIC as pre-meds.
By this time in the year,
however, many pre-meds have
already made personal contacts
though which they visit the
hospital or participate in the
pre-med society's "Day With A
Doctor," program.
The doctors involved in the
program have been very pleased
with the interest and conduct of
the students.
Useful Opportunity
Dr. Henry Jones of the
Department of Radiology at the
VA Hospital noted the experience
is "a very useful thing to do for
people who think they have any
interest in being a doctor or going
into any para-medical fields."
Peter Pansing, assistant director
of the AIC, commented that the
program was "an opportunity not
to be missed," but also

acknowledged that many of the
programs are scheduled on
weekday mornings, in direct
conflict with classes and labs.
Diane Herlinger, administrative
assistant at the AIC pointed out
the variety of offerings is so great
that any truly interested student
can fit one into his or her
schedule.
She noted that autopsies "had
been a big seller," but interest so
far had been spread over all fields.
The opportunity now exists for
those heading toward medicine or
thinking about medicine to
examine the field first hand by
following doctors into the wards,
conferences, laboratories, and
perhaps even into the operating
room.
Doctors involved in the
program have already proven to
be "very interested in pre-meds,"
according to several students,
providing an excellent
opportunity for students to
examine their career goals first
hand.
