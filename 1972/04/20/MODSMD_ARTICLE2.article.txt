# CJP Drops Charges Against Kwonping Ho
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
The Campus Judicial Panel decided
unanimously yesterday to acquit
Kwonping Ho of all charges stemming
from a demonstration at the Faculty
Club January 24, because the original
fact-finding hearing was "not a fair
one."
In its extensive 20-page decision,
the CJP wrote that the hearing
officer's report showed that Ho did
indeed violate the Fundamental
Standard, by forcing his way through
doors which Faculty Club employees
were trying to close.
The original charges were slightly
different—specifying only that Ho
assaulted Faculty Club chef Arturo
Lionetti and forced his way into the
kitchen to steal food.
The defense had argued that since
Ho's pushing through the doors to a
hallway leading to the kitchen was a
"lesser included offense" and not
specifically charged, it should not be
considered.
Nearly Harassment
Since Ho presented no defense
against this particular charge, the CJP

considered remanding the case—i.e.
sending it back—to the hearing officer,
but decided that would "border upon
harassment" because Ho is already
being prosecuted in two other cases.
Citing the fact that the judicial
system is a new one, the report also
said the defense could not have known
that they would have to defend against
this lesser charge.
The two other charges against Ho
stem from alleged disruptions of Prof.
William Shockley's quantum
mechanics class Jan. 18 and a meeting
of the Academic Council on March 31.
The CJP stated that since the
defense counsel believed they had won
by proving that Ho's intention was not
to steal food, "the defense felt they
did not need to try very hard to show
that the defendant was not guilty of
the other element charged—forcing his
way through the doors."
Lesser Included Offenses
For future reference, the GJP ruled
that such lesser included offenses
would be permissible in CJP cases, but
added that defendants who give

self-incriminating testimony have the
right to have their testimony stricken.
Members of the panel, chaired by
Law Professor John Kaplan, are
professors Richard Brody, David
Nivison, and Robert White, and
students Terrence Pape, Charles Stiver,
and Victor Vilaplana.
Special Assistant to the President
John Schwartz, who prosecuted the
case for the Administration, termed
the decision "fair," but added, "it
would have been fairer if it had been
remanded." "
Witchhunts
Defense co-counsel Zach Wasserman
told the Daily he was happy with the
findings, but he berated the opinion as
"obtuse—it does not make sense."
Claiming that the panel was asked
to decide whether or not the CJP was
going to conduct "fair trials or
witchhunts," Wasserman claimed,
'The opinion makes it clear that the

panel prefers witchhunts."
He concluded, "I think they were
very candid in saying that they're
being generous here because they're
going to crucify Kwonping later on."
Kaplan said, "If we find a similar
unfairness in any other case, we'll
reverse it. . . We're breaking our backs
to be fair to everybody."
Meanwhile the hearing officer's
report in the case of four persons
charged with disrupting Shockley's
class is due April 23.
Furthermore, the names of all
persons charged with disrupting the
Academic Council meeting will be
released except for those who desire
private hearings.
Kaplan said he has already
appointed San Francisco attorney
Stephen Tennis as hearing officer for
the Academic Council hearings. Last
week, Tennis recommended acquittal
for Don Zweig in a Placement Center
disruption case.
