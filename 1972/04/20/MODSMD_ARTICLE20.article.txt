# 'Hits' Save joe Cocker Concert
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Watching Joe Cocker perform is not a
very pleasant visual sensation. Cocker's
eyes often seem like they're going to jump
out of their sockets and his overall facial
expressions often resemble those of an
insane person. Add to these his famous
spastic arm movements and you begin to
wonder just what Mr. Cocker consumed
before coming on stage.
But Cocker is not up on stage before
thousands of people because of his eyes or
his facial expressions or his gestures. He is
up there because of a voice which is quite
singular in its rough-scratching-pleading
grunting kind of way. It's definitely not
the kind of voice you'd confuse with
Wayne Newton's.
And when Joe's really cooking and
pounding out one of his better songs, you
can overlook the somewhat grotesque
physical presence he projects.
Unfortunately in his concert at the
Oakland Coliseum Sunday night, it took
half of a set for him to really get going.
As soon as Cocker and his band of
about a dozen members came on stage, it
was fairly obvious that at least a couple of
the musicians had been dropping
something stronger than Chocks or at least
smoking something other than Dorals
before showtime. Whatever it was they had
consumed, it must have been a bit
somnolent, for after a few minutes of
singing, Cocker looked like he might fall
asleep.
Enjoyable Dancing
The only real highlights of the first half
of his set were provided by three black
female singers whose dancing was quite
enjoyable. Their singing wasn't that bad,
but they had a problem synchronizing their
clapping at the same rhythm.
Cocker's opening numbers were strong
testaments to the fact that just because
something is new, doesn't necessarily mean

it's good. Joe's new material just didn't
make it. The lyrics were eminently
forgettable, the instrumental work wasn't
too distinguished and all in all, the songs
just weren't very enjoyable.
But slowly Joe got moving. On a
number called "Black-eyed Blues," some of
the real Cocker began to show through.
And then he announced "Feeling Alright"
and the capacity crowd exploded and
Cocker began to cook.
Next came his version of "The Letter,"
which is infinitely preferable to the original
45 hit by The Boxtopsand which featured
on Sunday night, a very fine trumpet solo.
After a good, "hard" piano lead, Joe
moved into "High Time We Went," and by
now the crowd was beginning to get pretty
excited.
Overanxious Fan
During "High Time," one of Cocker's
overanxious fans got into a scuffle with
some of the ushers and had to be dragged
out by a couple of Bill Graham's burly
security men, who did their usually
excellent job of crowd control.
"She Don't Mind," featured some nice
piano and steel guitar work and then Joe
returned to his hit parade with "Cry Me A
River." He was really working on "Cry
Me," and his eyes looked like he'd just seen
the devil himself.
After "Cry Me," the female chorus
members flashed the customary peace
symbols and Joe and his band left the
stage. If they hadn't returned for an
encore, I would've hated to have been one
of the Oakland policemen who would have
had to face a very frenzied crowd leaving
the coliseum.
Cocker did return though and did a
rousing encore of "Hitchcock Railway,"
and when it had ended, a large number of
fans charged the luckily highly-elevated
stage and clamored for more. But Cocker
had performed for an hour and a half and

he wasn't going to return.
Hard To Judge
Cocker's overall performance was a bit
hard to judge. The first half of his set was
trite and quite annoying and disappointing.
But once he got going, he amply
demonstrated why he is considered one of
England's real superstars. All performers
have to move on to new material sooner or
later, but one would hope that Joe can
come up with some better new stuff, more
in the hard-driving, rocking tradition of his
well-received earlier material which
sounded so good in the second half of his
set.
The preliminary group for Sunday
night's show was supposed to have been
Free, an English group which received
some American exposure with a single
called "All Right Now." But they had to
cancel out and The Elvin Bishop Group did
an outstanding job of filling in. Thankfully,
Elvin has begun to play some worthwhile
new material including a fast blues number
called "Rock Bottom" and a slower thing
called "Rock My Soul."
Even their old numbers, which sounded
a bit stale at the "Jailhouse Rock" at
Winterland a few weeks ago, worked well.
"Crazy 'Bout You Baby" and "Higher and
Higher" were both vehicles for the usually
fine vocal work of Jo Baker.
Elvin's theme song, "Party Till The
Cows Come Home," recently never reaches
the level it was at on their "Feel It" album,
but it is still a classic, good-time, boogie
song.
The real major problem of concerts in
the Coliseum is naturally the size of the
massive arena. Concert Close-Up closed
circuit TV did a fine job of transmitting
pictures of the performers onto two large
screens above the stage, but there's
something a bit plastic about going to a
concert and only being able to see
performer's faces on a screen if you're

sitting more than halfway back from the
stage. But until high-priced performers and
their managers begin to lower their prices,
Bill Graham can really only afford to book
big acts like Cocker into the Coliseum. And
seeing big-names at the Coliseum is still
preferable to not seeing them at all.
