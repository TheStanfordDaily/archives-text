McCloskey Backs McGovern
BOSTON — Rep. Paul N. McCloskey, antiwar rival of
President Nixon before dropping out of the presidential
race, skipped over party lines yesterday and endorsed
Democrat George McGovern.
McCloskey's endorsement of the South Dakota
Democrat in the April 25 Massachusetts primary was
made in a question-and-answer session following a speech
by McCloskey in Boston denouncing Nixon's war policies.
"I'm expressing the hope that the citizens of
Massachusetts in both parties vote for the leading peace
candidates," McCloskey said. "I don't think there is any
question that Senator McGovern is the leading peace
candidate."
McCloskey has been the only Republican peace
candidate. His name remains on the ballot although he has
declared an end to his campaign. Since Massachusetts
voters cannot crocc party lines, McCloskey urged
Republicans to vott L r hi'" and Democrats to vote for
McGovern.
Apollo 16 In Orbit
SPACE CENTER, Houston — Apollo 16 astronauts
rocketed into orbit of the moon yesterday and began a
six-day scientific exploration. The spacemen and their
craft were fit and ready for the challenge after a
240,000-mile voyage from earth.
The series of problems that started almost from the
hour of launch last Sunday were all corrected and no
longer concerned the astronauts as they poised for their
descent to the moon Thursday.
But first Apollo 16's crew will spend a day orbiting the
moon, checking their spacecraft systems.
Presidential Aide Will Testify
WASHINGTON — Presidential aide Peter M. Flanigan said
yesterday he'll allow members of the Senate Judiciary
Committee to question him on what he knows about
locating the Republican national convention in San Diego.
In a concession to Democrats on the committee, the
close confidant to the President cleared the way for a
precedent-setting appearance today at hearings called to
reconsider the nomination of Richard G. Kleindienst for
attorney general.
Flanigan will also answer questions about the
out-of-court settlement of three antitrust suits against the
International Telephone & Telegraph Corp.
Production Gains, Inflation Soars
WASHINGTON — The nation's economy scored a strong
production gain during the first three months of the year,
but inflation soared to the highest rate in more than a
year, the government said yesterday.
The Gross National Product, output of the nation's
goods and services, increased by 11.8 percent or $30.3
billion in the January-March quarter. However, more than
half of the increase, 6.2 percent, resulted from higher
prices.
"I would acknowledge that the toughest challenge
we're facing is the inflation part of it," said Secretary of
Commerce Peter G. Peterson.
Peterson also said the high price rise resulted from
what he called an anticipated post-freeze bulge in
inflation. He added that the bulge should disappear when
statistics for the current quarter come in. Meanwhile, the
Price Commission is reportedly ready to tighten its
control system to try to slow the inflationary surge.
Senate Argues In High Court
WASHINGTON — For the first time in history the Senate
went before the Supreme Court to argue a case. It made a
plea to keep a federal grand jury from questioning Sen.
Mike Gravel about publication of the Pentagon Papers.
The Senate was represented in the historic argument
Wednesday by Democrat Sam J. Ervin Jr. of North
Carolina and Republican William B. Saxbe of Ohio.
Neither said they liked what Gravel did and Saxbe called
his conduct "outrageous."
But, without qualification, the two senators said the
Constitution flatly forbids the grand jury in Boston to
subpoena either Gravel's assistants, even one hired for the
project itself, or "third parties" about arrangements for
the publication of the once-secret study of the origins of
the Vietnam war.

Ervin said both the "speech and debate" clause of the
Constitution and the First Amendment's free speech
provisions protect not only Gravel, an Alaska Democrat,
from being questioned by either the executive or judicial
branches about his "legislative duties," but prohibit
questioning anyone who helped him do his job.
Misleading Advertising Claimed
WASHINGTON — The Federal Trade Commission
yesterday accused the nation's top three manufacturers of
painkillers of unfair and misleading advertising.
The proposed complaint challenges claims made by
each of the manufacturers of the leading nonprescription
analgesics that its products are superior to others'.
Named in the proposed complaint were American
Home Products Corp. makers of Anacin and Arthritis Pain
Formula; Bristol Myers Co., manufacturers of Bufferin,
Excedrin and Excedrin PM, and Sterling Drug Inc., makers
of Bayer Aspirin, Bayer Children's Aspirin, Cope,
Vanquish and Midol.
"The commission is not going to attempt to prove in
this case that the claims are untrue," said Robert Pitofsky,
director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection.
Rather, he said, the commission is charging the
advertisements for the products create the
"misimpression there are significant therapeutic
differences between these products."
The FTC action came a few hours before the National
Academy of Sciences reported to the Food and Drug
Administration that it can judge effective only 12 percent
of a labeling claim of a representative group of leading
non-prescription stomach antacids and pain relievers.
Among the differences cited in the FTC complaints are
such items as whether Bufferin relieves pain faster than
aspirin, that Anacin is more effective for pain relief than
any other nonprescription internal analgesic or that Bayer
Aspirin is superior in terms of therapeutic effects to other
aspirin.

Apollo 16 In Orbit
SPACE CENTER, Houston — Apollo 16 astronauts
rocketed into orbit of the moon yesterday and began a
six-day scientific exploration. The spacemen and their
craft were fit and ready for the challenge after a
240,000-mile voyage from earth.
The series of problems that started almost from the
hour of launch last Sunday were all corrected and no
longer concerned the astronauts as they poised for their
descent to the moon Thursday.
But first Apollo 16's crew will spend a day orbiting the
moon, checking their spacecraft systems.
Presidential Aide Will Testify
WASHINGTON — Presidential aide Peter M. Flanigan said
yesterday he'll allow members of the Senate Judiciary
Committee to question him on what he knows about
locating the Republican national convention in San Diego.
In a concession to Democrats on the committee, the
close confidant to the President cleared the way for a
precedent-setting appearance today at hearings called to
reconsider the nomination of Richard G. Kleindienst for
attorney general.
Flanigan will also answer questions about the
out-of-court settlement of three antitrust suits against the
International Telephone & Telegraph Corp.
Production Gains, Inflation Soars
WASHINGTON — The nation's economy scored a strong
production gain during the first three months of the year,
but inflation soared to the highest rate in more than a
year, the government said yesterday.
The Gross National Product, output of the nation's
goods and services, increased by 11.8 percent or $30.3
billion in the January-March quarter. However, more than
half of the increase, 6.2 percent, resulted from higher
prices.
"I would acknowledge that the toughest challenge
we're facing is the inflation part of it," said Secretary of
Commerce Peter G. Peterson.
Peterson also said the high price rise resulted from
what he called an anticipated post-freeze bulge in
inflation. He added that the bulge should disappear when
statistics for the current quarter come in. Meanwhile, the
Price Commission is reportedly ready to tighten its
control system to try to slow the inflationary surge.
Senate Argues In High Court
WASHINGTON — For the first time in history the Senate
went before the Supreme Court to argue a case. It made a
plea to keep a federal grand jury from questioning Sen.
Mike Gravel about publication of the Pentagon Papers.
The Senate was represented in the historic argument
Wednesday by Democrat Sam J. Ervin Jr. of North
Carolina and Republican William B. Saxbe of Ohio.
Neither said they liked what Gravel did and Saxbe called
his conduct "outrageous."
But, without qualification, the two senators said the
Constitution flatly forbids the grand jury in Boston to
subpoena either Gravel's assistants, even one hired for the
project itself, or "third parties" about arrangements for
the publication of the once-secret study of the origins of
the Vietnam war.

Ervin said both the "speech and debate" clause of the
Constitution and the First Amendment's free speech
provisions protect not only Gravel, an Alaska Democrat,
from being questioned by either the executive or judicial
branches about his "legislative duties," but prohibit
questioning anyone who helped him do his job.
Misleading Advertising Claimed
WASHINGTON — The Federal Trade Commission
yesterday accused the nation's top three manufacturers of
painkillers of unfair and misleading advertising.
The proposed complaint challenges claims made by
each of the manufacturers of the leading nonprescription
analgesics that its products are superior to others'.
Named in the proposed complaint were American
Home Products Corp. makers of Anacin and Arthritis Pain
Formula; Bristol Myers Co., manufacturers of Bufferin,
Excedrin and Excedrin PM, and Sterling Drug Inc., makers
of Bayer Aspirin, Bayer Children's Aspirin, Cope,
Vanquish and Midol.
"The commission is not going to attempt to prove in
this case that the claims are untrue," said Robert Pitofsky,
director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection.
Rather, he said, the commission is charging the
advertisements for the products create the
"misimpression there are significant therapeutic
differences between these products."
The FTC action came a few hours before the National
Academy of Sciences reported to the Food and Drug
Administration that it can judge effective only 12 percent
of a labeling claim of a representative group of leading
non-prescription stomach antacids and pain relievers.
Among the differences cited in the FTC complaints are
such items as whether Bufferin relieves pain faster than
aspirin, that Anacin is more effective for pain relief than
any other nonprescription internal analgesic or that Bayer
Aspirin is superior in terms of therapeutic effects to other
aspirin.

Production Gains, Inflation Soars
WASHINGTON — The nation's economy scored a strong
production gain during the first three months of the year,
but inflation soared to the highest rate in more than a
year, the government said yesterday.
The Gross National Product, output of the nation's
goods and services, increased by 11.8 percent or $30.3
billion in the January-March quarter. However, more than
half of the increase, 6.2 percent, resulted from higher
prices.
"I would acknowledge that the toughest challenge
we're facing is the inflation part of it," said Secretary of
Commerce Peter G. Peterson.
Peterson also said the high price rise resulted from
what he called an anticipated post-freeze bulge in
inflation. He added that the bulge should disappear when
statistics for the current quarter come in. Meanwhile, the
Price Commission is reportedly ready to tighten its
control system to try to slow the inflationary surge.
Senate Argues In High Court
WASHINGTON — For the first time in history the Senate
went before the Supreme Court to argue a case. It made a
plea to keep a federal grand jury from questioning Sen.
Mike Gravel about publication of the Pentagon Papers.
The Senate was represented in the historic argument
Wednesday by Democrat Sam J. Ervin Jr. of North
Carolina and Republican William B. Saxbe of Ohio.
Neither said they liked what Gravel did and Saxbe called
his conduct "outrageous."
But, without qualification, the two senators said the
Constitution flatly forbids the grand jury in Boston to
subpoena either Gravel's assistants, even one hired for the
project itself, or "third parties" about arrangements for
the publication of the once-secret study of the origins of
the Vietnam war.

Ervin said both the "speech and debate" clause of the
Constitution and the First Amendment's free speech
provisions protect not only Gravel, an Alaska Democrat,
from being questioned by either the executive or judicial
branches about his "legislative duties," but prohibit
questioning anyone who helped him do his job.
Misleading Advertising Claimed
WASHINGTON — The Federal Trade Commission
yesterday accused the nation's top three manufacturers of
painkillers of unfair and misleading advertising.
The proposed complaint challenges claims made by
each of the manufacturers of the leading nonprescription
analgesics that its products are superior to others'.
Named in the proposed complaint were American
Home Products Corp. makers of Anacin and Arthritis Pain
Formula; Bristol Myers Co., manufacturers of Bufferin,
Excedrin and Excedrin PM, and Sterling Drug Inc., makers
of Bayer Aspirin, Bayer Children's Aspirin, Cope,
Vanquish and Midol.
"The commission is not going to attempt to prove in
this case that the claims are untrue," said Robert Pitofsky,
director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection.
Rather, he said, the commission is charging the
advertisements for the products create the
"misimpression there are significant therapeutic
differences between these products."
The FTC action came a few hours before the National
Academy of Sciences reported to the Food and Drug
Administration that it can judge effective only 12 percent
of a labeling claim of a representative group of leading
non-prescription stomach antacids and pain relievers.
Among the differences cited in the FTC complaints are
such items as whether Bufferin relieves pain faster than
aspirin, that Anacin is more effective for pain relief than
any other nonprescription internal analgesic or that Bayer
Aspirin is superior in terms of therapeutic effects to other
aspirin.
