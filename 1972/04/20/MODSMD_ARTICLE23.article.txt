# Davis Defense Asks Judge To Ban 'Tainted' Letters
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
SAN JOSE—The judge in the Angela
Davis case is expected to rule today on
defense attempts to ban from the trial
a series of letters allegedly written by
Davis to "Soledad Brother" George
Jackson. Davis' lawyers charge the
letters were "illegally seized" and are
"tainted" as evidence.
One of the letters, marked to
"George" from "Angela," pledged to
"free George Jackson and the Soledad
Brothers" and to achieve "liberation
by any means necessary."
The letter, allegedly confiscated in
the Soledad Prison mail room in June,
1970, continued, "If I'm serious about
my love for you, about black people, I
should be ready to go all the way. I
am."
The jury was sent home for the day
yesterday, while Judge Richard E.
Arnason heard lawyers debate whether
the letters should be presented to the
jury as evidence. He plans to rule
today, after hearing prosecution
rebuttal to the defense motions.
In addition to the letter seized at
Soledad, the defense challenged
alleged letters which were found in
Davis' Los Angeles apartment and an
18-page document found in George
Jackson's cell after he was killed in a
San Quentin shootout last August.
Letters Crucial
The letters are crucial to the case of
the prosecution, which argues that
they show Davis' love for George
Jackson and her interest in helping
him escape from prison. Davis is
charged with providing weapons used
by Jackson's younger brother in the
August, 1970, Marin Courthouse
escape attempt, which the state
describes as an attempt to bargain for
George Jackson's freedom.
The letter from "Angela"
purportedly seized at Soledad said she
was devoting all of her efforts to
freeing the Soledad Brothers and
added: "Man, I have gotten into a lot
of trouble, but I don't give a damn. I
love you. I love my people. That is all
that matters, liberation by any means
necessary."
The defense moved to bar that
letter from evidence, charging that
prison officials "illegally seized" it
from correspondence sent to Jackson
by his lawyer, John Thorne. Defense
attorney Leo Branton charged that
reading and seizing a document
enclosed in the lawyer's letter was a
"violation of one of the most valued
privileges under the law—the
lawyer-client relationship."
But Soledad officer Charles Moody,
who said he kept an extensive personal
file on Jackson, told the court that the
letter was removed from Thome's
correspondence as "contraband"
because it was not written by the
lawyer and because there was no
"Angela" on the list of those allowed
to write to Jackson.
Apartment Searched
Three other letters were allegedly
seized in a search of Davis' Los
Angeles apartment August 18, 1970,
after the Marin shootout. The defense
lawyers charged that federal agents
went on a "fishing expedition" at the
apartment and "rummaged at will

through Miss Davis' personal letters
and her belongings." They said the
letters were illegally seized because
they were not covered by a search
warrant allowing the agents to seek
"evidence and instrumentalities" that
showed Miss Davis had unlawfully fled
California.
They also suggested that the agents
planted the letters the day before they
were taken while visiting the
apartment under a "spurious" arrest
warrant. Former federal agent James
McCord denied the allegation.
Objecting that two of the letters
found were photocopies, defense
lawyer Doris Brin Walker said that
raised the questions: "Where are the
originals? Where were the photocopies
made?"
In another seizure, a single-spaced,
18-page letter was allegedly found in
George Jackson's cell after his death.
The defense moved that the long

document is illegal because it was
taken from Jackson's cell without a
search warrant.
Typewriten Sample
The defense also objected to the
prosecution's methods in obtaining a
sample from Davis' personal
typewriter to link it to the 18-page
letter.
The prosecution revealed that a
Marin County Sheriff's Deputy
secretly took Davis' typewriter out of
her "work room" in the Marin jail last
August just long enough to take a
sample of its print.
Branton called the action a
"deliberate, conspiratorial, illegal act
by the Attorney General's office." He
said that Davis was working in the cell,
under court approval, as her own
lawyer and that the seizure amounted
to illegally seizing documents from a
law office.
