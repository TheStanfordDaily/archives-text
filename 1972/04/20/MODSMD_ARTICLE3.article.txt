# Campus War Protests Continue
## 
### DAVID SULITEANU 
Yesterday was a day of heavy
anti-war activity on college campuses
around the nation, including a serious
confrontation with police on one
campus and two attempts to bomb
ROTC buildings.
The number of universities and
colleges which have planned strikes or
various other forms of action for
Friday rose to 62, a spokesman for the
National Student Association told the
Daily last night. Thirty-four other
schools have scheduled meetings for
today to decide whether to strike.
In Maryland, an estimated 250
state, local, and campus police
continued firing tear gas late into the
night to try to clear portions of U.S.
Route 1, blocked for the second day
by a group of protesters from the
University of Maryland. According to
one source, so much tear gas was fired
that clouds of it drifted over the
campus, forcing students to leave their
dormitories.
The protesters, numbering over

1000, moved to the highway after
failing to set fire to the campus ROTC
armory. Administration building
windows were broken and several
bushes set afire.
At the University of Oregon in
Eugene, police found two liquor
bottles filled with gasoline with a
partly-burned rag as a wick.
Authorities said it was an attempt to
firebomb the University's ROTC
building.
Fire In San Francisco
In an incident of a somewhat
different nature, the San Francisco
office of the National Peace Action
Coalition was the scene of an arson
that resulted in $4000 damage,
according to a fire official. The
organization has scheduled peace
rallies in Los Angeles and New York
for next Saturday.
At Columbia University in New
York, about 500 students succeeded in
cancelling a number of classes by
barricading buildings and picketing.
University President William McGill,

after "symbolically" attempting to
enter one of the buildings and being
refused issued about 100
copies of a temporary restraining order
granted by a State Supreme Court.
Demonstrators eittier ignored the
orders or burned them.
Adding to a growing number of
written protestations to the increase in
bombing, the presidents of the eight
Ivy League schools issued a joint
statement Wednesday condemning
renewed bombing in North Vietnam;
at the same time they criticized
coercive student strikes.
Foothill College Occupation
Locally, a speaker at last night's
Cubberley rally said that a group of
students from Foothill College will
attempt to occupy the administration
building at 8 this morning.
In Wisconsin, 2000 anti-war
protesters massed at the University of
Wisconsin in Madison and marched to
the state capitol several blocks away.
About 20 of them stalked out of a
meeting with Gov. Patrick J. Lucey

after he refused to call a special
legislative session to shut off the
state's war resources and open the
capitol to all demonstrators.
In addition to strikes, a number of
campuses have scheduled other
activities for Friday.
Oberlin Renamed
At Oberlin College in Ohio students
and faculty said that on Friday they
will rename the town of Oberlin, An
Loc. They will then turn the town into a big guerrila
theater, and symbolically devastate it.
Several members of the Oberlin faculty in caps and
gowns will travel to Washington, D.C. to lobby for
anti-war legislation.
Thirty Vietnamese students at Southern Illinois
University will invade the Center for Southeastern Asian
Studies, which they have renamed "American Strategic
Hamlet One."
In Los Angeles Friday night Jane Fonda and the Rev.
Ralph Abiernathy will be the main speakers at a rally to
drum up interest for Saturday's peace march on the west
side of the city.
According to the National Student Association, 15
North Carolina schools will march to the capital on
Friday. In Ohio, 15 schools, led by Antioch, will attempt
to shut down Wright Patterson Air Force base, a Strategic
Air Command base.
