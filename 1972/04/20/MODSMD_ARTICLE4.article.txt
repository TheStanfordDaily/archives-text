# Burke, Hocker Make Runoff, Four Of Six Fee Requests Lose
## 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
First tally results released last night
indicate that the slate of
Burke-Wong-Appel-Van Petten and the
Chris Hocker-Robin Friedman ticket
will oppose each other in the ASSU
run-off election scheduled for next
week.
Of the six proposed fee assessments
on the ballot, only two passed. The
Stanford Daily-Publications Board
proposal passed by a vote of 2662 to
1780, and the KZSU referendum
passed 2667 to 1818. The four other
assessments all failed.
The run-off election will take place
Tuesday and Wednesday, April 25 and
26.
Elections Commissioner Johnny
Lawson stressed last night that all
tabulations so far were preliminary
ones, and he said that the final results
will not be ready until sometime this
afternoon.
Counted Once
With all of the ballots counted at
least once, returns showed
Burke-Wong led the presidential race
with 1118 votes; Hocker-Friedman
with 985; Palmer-Wolf 525;
Barber-Fay 403; Anderson-Chaplain
188; Legard-Wyden 112;
Kenney-Porster 46; and
Rudick-Douglas with 41 votes.
The ASSU Program fee received
2981 votes for $0, and 1534 for $1;
the Afro-American fee proposal
received 2019 votes for yes and 2458
no votes; Special Events got 1850 yes
votes and 2519 for no; and Citizens
Advocates, which needed a two-thirds
majority to pass, received only a
simple majority with 2395 votes cast
for yes, to 2074 for no.
More people voted on the proposed
fee assessments than on the
presidential contest. Lawson estimated
that approximately 4500 students
voted on the six fee referenda.
There were 3,422 votes cast for
president, which is more than lar.t
year, but is not a record.
Tabulation on the bonfire proposal
wiil not be ready until sometime
tomorrow.

Lawson said last night, that he is
not releasing the number of votes cast
for either the senior class officers, or
the positions on the Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC) due to
anticipated protests which may
invalidate all votes cast in those
contests.
Illegal Voting
In the case of the senior class
officers, Lawson said that he received
reports that students who were not
eligible to vote for senior class officers,
did in fact vote.
The votes cast for the positions on
the SCLC face invalidation due to an
error in the type of voting system used
on the ballot.
The ASSU Constitution requires

that the Hare system of proportional
representation must be used to elect
more than one candidate for the same
office.
The ballot did not instruct people
to vote in order of preference, which is
necessary in the Hare system.
Valid Election?
Ultimately, the student Senate
must decide the validity of the SCLC
vote, as well as the validity of the
election in general. The Senate is
meeting tonight at 7:30 p.m.
The run-off election ballot will
probably include not only the two
presidential slates, but the two slates
running for the offices of the senior
class, and the five candidates running
for the three positions open on the

SCLC.
This will be the second time in two
years that the slate of Chris Hocker
and Robin Friedman has made the
presidential run-off election.
