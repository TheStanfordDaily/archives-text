# U.S. Destroyers Attacked By North Viet Jet Fighters
## 
### DAVE THIEMANN 
North Vietnamese MIG jet fighters
and several torpedo boats yesterday
attacked U.S. destroyers bombarding
the North Vietnamese coast, while
Communist ground troops renewed
their mortar and rocket barrage against
An Loc, a South Vietnamese
provincial capital 60 miles north of
Saigon.
The U.S. command in Saigon
reported one MIG shot down, and at
least two torpedo boats sunk. Four
sailors aboard the destroyer Higbee,
which suffered an undetermined
amount of damage in the attack, were
reported wounded.
Meanwhile, in Washington, House
Democrats moved toward a resolution
calling for a specific date for American
air and ground forces to cease their
involvement in Indochina, subject only
to the release of U.S. prisoners of war.
Opponents of the party caucus
resolution delayed final action on the
measure yesterday, but the party

leadership quickly scheduled another
caucus meeting for today. The caucus
normally meets once a month.
Boycott Possible
Antiwar Democrats expect the
resolution to be adopted if a majority
of the 256 caucus members attend
today's meeting. Opponents may
boycott the meeting in an attempt to
prevent a quorum from being
established.
Also in Washington, the White
House said that President Nixon has
not decided when he will announce
the pace of the next stage of American
troop withdrawals. The announcement
will be made before May 1, however,
when American troop strength is
targeted to fall to 69,000 men.
Nixon has requested television time
next week for a broadcast on the
North Vietnamese offensive and
American bombing in Indochina.
In the Senate, Republicans and
Democrats conducted a five-hour
"debate" in which senators made short
speeches on the Southeast Asian war.

Republicans endorsed the President's
policies and blamed the Soviet Union
for the Communist offensive, while
Democrats urged an immediate end to
the bombing and an accelerated
withdrawal of all American forces.
On the ground in Vietnam, North
Vietnamese gunners shot 1,600 rounds
of mortar and rocket fire into An Loc
in the heaviest bombardment since the
city was besieged April 7.
After the bombardment, probes by
an infantry and an armored column
were repulsed by the city's defenders,
according to the South Vietnamese
command, and four tanks were
destroyed.
North Vietnamese troops also seized
a battalion base camp and a district
town in the central coastal plane, and
cut Highway 13, about 40 miles north
of Saigon, and Highway 1 on the
coast.
Air Strikes
In U.S. air action, the American
command reported 500 air strikes in
South Vietnam and about 150 above
the demilitarized zone in the southern
quarter of North Vietnam. U.S. B-52
bombers struck within 50 miles of
Saigon for the first time in several
months.
Radio Hanoi claimed three U.S.
planes were shot down over the north,
but the U.S. command did not
confirm the reports.
The air-sea battle off the North
Vietnamese coast about 25 miles
above the demilitarized zone was the
third incident involving U.S. warships
in four days.
The U.S. command reported that
the torpedo boats which were sunk did
not open fire, but "posed a threat to
U.S. ships in the area."

a battalion base camp and a district
town in the central coastal plane, and
cut Highway 13, about 40 miles north
of Saigon, and Highway 1 on the
coast.
Air Strikes
In U.S. air action, the American
command reported 500 air strikes in
South Vietnam and about 150 above
the demilitarized zone in the southern
quarter of North Vietnam. U.S. B-52
bombers struck within 50 miles of
Saigon for the first time in several
months.
Radio Hanoi claimed three U.S.
planes were shot down over the north,
but the U.S. command did not
confirm the reports.
The air-sea battle off the North
Vietnamese coast about 25 miles
above the demilitarized zone was the
third incident involving U.S. warships
in four days.
The U.S. command reported that
the torpedo boats which were sunk did
not open fire, but "posed a threat to
U.S. ships in the area."
North Vietnamese MIG jet fighters
and several torpedo boats yesterday
attacked U.S. destroyers bombarding
the North Vietnamese coast, while
Communist ground troops renewed
their mortar and rocket barrage against
An Loc, a South Vietnamese
provincial capital 60 miles north of
Saigon.
The U.S. command in Saigon
reported one MIG shot down, and at
least two torpedo boats sunk. Four
sailors aboard the destroyer Higbee,
which suffered an undetermined
amount of damage in the attack, were
reported wounded.
Meanwhile, in Washington, House
Democrats moved toward a resolution
calling for a specific date for American
air and ground forces to cease their
involvement in Indochina, subject only
to the release of U.S. prisoners of war.
Opponents of the party caucus
resolution delayed final action on the
measure yesterday, but the party

leadership quickly scheduled another
caucus meeting for today. The caucus
normally meets once a month.
Boycott Possible
Antiwar Democrats expect the
resolution to be adopted if a majority
of the 256 caucus members attend
today's meeting. Opponents may
boycott the meeting in an attempt to
prevent a quorum from being
established.
Also in Washington, the White
House said that President Nixon has
not decided when he will announce
the pace of the next stage of American
troop withdrawals. The announcement
will be made before May 1, however,
when American troop strength is
targeted to fall to 69,000 men.
Nixon has requested television time
next week for a broadcast on the
North Vietnamese offensive and
American bombing in Indochina.
In the Senate, Republicans and
Democrats conducted a five-hour
"debate" in which senators made short
speeches on the Southeast Asian war.

Republicans endorsed the President's
policies and blamed the Soviet Union
for the Communist offensive, while
Democrats urged an immediate end to
the bombing and an accelerated
withdrawal of all American forces.
On the ground in Vietnam, North
Vietnamese gunners shot 1,600 rounds
of mortar and rocket fire into An Loc
in the heaviest bombardment since the
city was besieged April 7.
After the bombardment, probes by
an infantry and an armored column
were repulsed by the city's defenders,
according to the South Vietnamese
command, and four tanks were
destroyed.
North Vietnamese troops also seized
a battalion base camp and a district
town in the central coastal plane, and
cut Highway 13, about 40 miles north
of Saigon, and Highway 1 on the
coast.
