# Air War Vote Petitioners Violate California Laws
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
Persons circulating the Southeast
Asia Air War petitions have violated a
state law regarding the collection of
signatures.
The petition states that the people
of California are opposed to the
bombing of Southeast Asia and calls
for "the immediate withdrawal of all
United States military, logistical and
financial support from the
governments of these countries."
Petitions from other counties have
been circulated within Santa Clara
County. This violates Section 3512 of
the California State Election Code
which states that an elector can

circulate petitions only within his own
county.
The circulators also falsely signed
the Declaration of the Circulator
which states, "I have circulated said
section within the above-named
county."
Chester Adams, the Northern
California Coordinator of the Air War
Vote drive, said that he has instructed
the Santa Clara County Air War Vote
office to send all out-of-county
circulating petitions to San Francisco,
where he plans to destroy them.
Unaware Of Violations
Adams stated that he was unaware
of the violations until last Saturday.
He said that he had informed all
offices of the specifications of the
election code rules but "apparently
somebody didn't get the word or they
disregarded it."
Circulators of Marijuana Initiative
petitions have violated the same rules,
according to Laura Lee Wells, Air War
Vote volunteer. She said that some of
the Marijuana Initiative petitions were
in the Air War Vote office.
When asked whether she knew the
violations constituted election fraud
Wells replied, "I really don't know."
However she conceded later "I
suppose you're lying if you are doing
it." Stanford Law Professor Robert
Girard believes that the violations fall
under the "general catch-all category
of general misdemeanors."

The petition also demands that "the
representatives of the State of
California shall do all in their power to
prevent the utilization of the
manpower, tax monies and resources
of the state" to support U.S. presence
in North and South Vietnam,
Cambodia, Laos and Thailand.
x'he petitioners estimate that they
have collected 60,000-80,000
signatures. The> need 300,000
signatures by June 16thâ€”the state's
deadline.
Adams feels they have a 40 percent
chance of collecting the required
number of signatures. He emphasized
that "what the government does in
Asia pretty much governs the reaction
we get in the streets. We've been
helped and hurt by the recent
bombing of North Vietnam. A lot of
middle of the road people have turned
into hawks."
