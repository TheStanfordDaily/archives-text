# Air War Vote Petitioners Violate California Laws
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
Persons circulating the Southeast
Asia Air War petitions have violated a
state law regarding the collection of
signatures.
The petition states that the people
of California are opposed to the
bombing of Southeast Asia and calls
for "the immediate withdrawal of all
United States military, logistical and
financial support from the
governments of these countries."
Petitions from other counties have
been circulated within Santa Clara
County. This violates Section 3512 of
the California State Election Code
which states that an elector can

circulate petitions only within his own
county.
The circulators also falsely signed
the Declaration of the Circulator
which states, "I have circulated said
section within the above-named
county."
Chester Adams, the Northern
California Coordinator of the Air War
Vote drive, said that he has instructed
the Santa Clara County Air War Vote

circulating petitions to San Francisco,
where he plans to destroy them.
