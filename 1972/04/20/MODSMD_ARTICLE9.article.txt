While the Senate was debating
draft extension last June, the
Pentagon announced a quota of
16,000 men for July and August.
These draftees, it turned out, were
not needed the announcement
was propaganda to make draft
extension seem essential, both to
Senators and the general public. It
was quietly cancelled a few weeks
later even though the Senate went
into summer recess without voting
on the draft bill.
Under extraordinary lobbying
pressure from the Pentagon and
the Executive, the Senate finally
voted on September 21 to extend
the draft. The President said he
just couldn't think of anything
more irresponsible than toying
further with national security.
Reduce Army Size
Faced with the need to reduce

the size of the Army from
1,074,431 to a monthly average
of 892,000 during 1972, the
Pentagon is having to scramble to
figure out how to draft anyone.
However, the military seems
determined to use the draft.
First-term enlistees can obtain
discharge two months early.
Servicemen in the U.S., Puerto
Rico, and the Virgin Islands can
obtain up to five months early;
4,400 officers are to be released.
This is expected to reduce the
total by 65,000, but does not
mean that 65,000 new men can be
drafted, because of the lowered
ceiling.
The Pentagon announced a
quota of 10,000 for the last six
months of 1971, presumably
because they felt obliged to
announce a quota after having
insisted upon the urgency of the
draft's extension. Men were
volunteering at the rate of about
14,000 per month even before the
substantial pay increases could go
into effect, increasing the problem
of how to keep on drafting men.
But the Army insists it will need

at least 40,000 draftees in 1972, if
only to "prevent the dismantling
of training bases" for which the
Army claims to have a continuing
need. It is a sad state of affairs.
The sizes of draft calls during
an election year always have
political overtones, but 1972 draft
calls will be solely for political
purposes, manipulated to put the
President in he best posture for
re-election. This suggests to me
the unnecessary drafting of from
25,000 to 60,000 men during the
first half of the year, with a
triumphant announcement from
the White House — rather than the
Pentagon or Selective Service —
about July, 1972, that zero draft
calls have been reached a year
early. I should think there will
also be an announcement that all
U.S. ground troops are out of
Vietnam. What Democratic
hopeful could defeat for
re-election Richard Milhous
Nixon, the peace candidate?
After Elections
After elections it may be quite
a different story. The Selective
Service System will still be there,
tempting any President to become
impatient with diplomacy when
he can send thousands of
conscripts somewhere — anywhere
— to deal with whatever situation
he finds unsatisfactory. The
reason the "stand-by" draft is
wanted by the President is the
same reason there should not be
one, namely that it could be
reactivated without the need to
persuade the public that it was
necessary or for a valid cause.
Only if the draft is repealed
outright are we safe-guarded
j against such sudden massive
military intervention by the U.S.
! government as was done in
Vietnam. A President intent on
peace would throw the draft into
the junk heap, to join the
stand-by concentration camps.

While the Senate was debating
draft extension last June, the
Pentagon announced a quota of
16,000 men for July and August.
These draftees, it turned out, were
not needed the announcement
was propaganda to make draft
extension seem essential, both to
Senators and the general public. It
was quietly cancelled a few weeks
later even though the Senate went
into summer recess without voting
on the draft bill.
Under extraordinary lobbying
pressure from the Pentagon and
the Executive, the Senate finally
voted on September 21 to extend
the draft. The President said he
just couldn't think of anything
more irresponsible than toying
further with national security.
Reduce Army Size
Faced with the need to reduce

the size of the Army from
1,074,431 to a monthly average
of 892,000 during 1972, the
Pentagon is having to scramble to
figure out how to draft anyone.
However, the military seems
determined to use the draft.
First-term enlistees can obtain
discharge two months early.
Servicemen in the U.S., Puerto
Rico, and the Virgin Islands can
obtain up to five months early;
4,400 officers are to be released.
This is expected to reduce the
total by 65,000, but does not
mean that 65,000 new men can be
drafted, because of the lowered
ceiling.
The Pentagon announced a
quota of 10,000 for the last six
months of 1971, presumably
because they felt obliged to
announce a quota after having
insisted upon the urgency of the
draft's extension. Men were
volunteering at the rate of about
14,000 per month even before the
substantial pay increases could go
into effect, increasing the problem
of how to keep on drafting men.
But the Army insists it will need

at least 40,000 draftees in 1972, if
only to "prevent the dismantling
of training bases" for which the
Army claims to have a continuing
need. It is a sad state of affairs.
The sizes of draft calls during
an election year always have
political overtones, but 1972 draft
calls will be solely for political
purposes, manipulated to put the
President in he best posture for
re-election. This suggests to me
the unnecessary drafting of from
25,000 to 60,000 men during the
first half of the year, with a
triumphant announcement from
the White House — rather than the
Pentagon or Selective Service —
about July, 1972, that zero draft
calls have been reached a year
early. I should think there will
also be an announcement that all
U.S. ground troops are out of
Vietnam. What Democratic
hopeful could defeat for
re-election Richard Milhous
Nixon, the peace candidate?
After Elections
After elections it may be quite
a different story. The Selective
Service System will still be there,
tempting any President to become
impatient with diplomacy when
he can send thousands of
conscripts somewhere — anywhere
— to deal with whatever situation
he finds unsatisfactory. The
reason the "stand-by" draft is
wanted by the President is the
same reason there should not be
one, namely that it could be
reactivated without the need to
persuade the public that it was
necessary or for a valid cause.
Only if the draft is repealed
outright are we safe-guarded
j against such sudden massive
military intervention by the U.S.
! government as was done in
Vietnam. A President intent on
peace would throw the draft into
