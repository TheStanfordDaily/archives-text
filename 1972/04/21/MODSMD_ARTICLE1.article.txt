# Police, Crowd Clash In Anti-War March
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
A torch-bearing crowd of 700
marching south on Palm Drive was
forced around the campus by 60
police tactical officers last night. The
60 officers were part of a 128-man
force on campus.
The destination of the march,
which began in Lytton Plaza on
University Ave., was the Hansen
Microwave Laboratory, but few of the
demonstrators made their way that far
into the campus.
Last night the Cowell Health Center
reported it had admitted three
Stanford students after they had been
treated in the Stanford Hospital
Emergency Room for head lacerations.
The Stanford Hospital said that it had
also treated and released a San
Francisco State student with similar
injuries. The Hospital also admitted a
patient who had suffered a broken arm
in the rioting.
The arrest of James Joseph
McDonald, 22, of Redwood City was
the only one reported as resulting
from last night's action. McDonald, a
non-student, was charged with assault
and battery on a police officer,
resisting arrest and failure to disperse.

Five hundred demonstrators left
Lytton Plaza at 7:45 p.m. and were
joined at Palm and Campus Drives by
another group of about 200 which had
marched from the Wilbur parking lot.
Both groups had been informed by
police officers before they began their
marches that carrying such torches was
a violation of the California Uniform
Fire Code. Torches were confiscated
by police at Lytton Plaza.
Despite these precautions, about 50
torches were produced and lighted as

the two groups joined. At 8:15 the
crowd was told by Lieutenant Don
Tamm of the Santa Clara County
Sheriffs Department that "this is a
hazard to public safety. Use your
heads and drop those torches." He
then declared the crowd an illegal
assembly and ordered it to disperse.
As the demonstrators began to drop
their torches, 50 tac officers formed a
skirmish line and charged the crowd.
The demonstrators were forced south
and southeast onto Campus Drive. At
least three demonstrators were beaten
in the charge.
Soon there were cries of "back
onto University" and the crowd again,
gathered at Palm and Campus. Tamm
again warned them that they
constituted an illegal assembly, saying,
"If you do not go in the direction I
tell you, you may be subject to arrest.
You may go up Palm Drive back
towards Palo Alto."
Apparently there was some
disagreement between Tamm and
officers of the Stanford Deprtment of
Public Safety as to whether the
demonstrators should be allowed on
the campus after they had dropped
their torches. Reportedly, a Stanford
officer told Tamm "I won't take any
more of that," apparently referring to
Tamm's dispersal order.
Skirmish Line
At 8:40, the 60 tac officers again
formed into a skirmish line which
charged the crowd, now numbering
approximately 200. This crowd then
split into two groups, the larger of
which was followed by 20 tac officers
and seven Palo Alto Police cars to the
Stanford Shopping Center and then to
the corner of Palm and Arboretum.

There they broke into small groups
and returned to Palo Alto. Several of
them were seen driving back on
campus shortly afterward.
The other of the two large groups
moved north on Palm Drive and into
the central campus. Once it reached
White Plaza the group divided once
again. According to Pacific Studies
Center researcher Lenny Siegel one of
these groups was "really chased hard."
Siegel said of the police that "they
were really hitting people."
The second new group was forced
around the Old Union towards Santa
Theresa Street by police.
McDonald was a member of this
group, which eventually met in the
Roble Lounge and then dispersed.

The Stanford Hospital said that it had
also treated and released a San
Francisco State student with similar
injuries. The Hospital also admitted a
patient who had suffered a broken arm
in the rioting.
The arrest of James Joseph
McDonald, 22, of Redwood City was
the only one reported as resulting
from last night's action. McDonald, a
non-student, was charged with assault
and battery on a police officer,
resisting arrest and failure to disperse.

Five hundred demonstrators left
Lytton Plaza at 7:45 p.m. and were
joined at Palm and Campus Drives by
another group of about 200 which had
marched from the Wilbur parking lot.
Both groups had been informed by
police officers before they began their
marches that carrying such torches was
a violation of the California Uniform
Fire Code. Torches were confiscated
by police at Lytton Plaza.
Despite these precautions, about 50
torches were produced and lighted as

the two groups joined. At 8:15 the
crowd was told by Lieutenant Don
Tamm of the Santa Clara County
Sheriffs Department that "this is a
hazard to public safety. Use your
heads and drop those torches." He
then declared the crowd an illegal
assembly and ordered it to disperse.
As the demonstrators began to drop
their torches, 50 tac officers formed a
skirmish line and charged the crowd.
The demonstrators were forced south
and southeast onto Campus Drive. At
least three demonstrators were beaten
in the charge.
Soon there were cries of "back
onto University" and the crowd again,
gathered at Palm and Campus. Tamm
again warned them that they
constituted an illegal assembly, saying,
"If you do not go in the direction I
tell you, you may be subject to arrest.
You may go up Palm Drive back
towards Palo Alto."
Apparently there was some
disagreement between Tamm and
officers of the Stanford Deprtment of
Public Safety as to whether the
demonstrators should be allowed on
the campus after they had dropped
their torches. Reportedly, a Stanford
officer told Tamm "I won't take any
more of that," apparently referring to
Tamm's dispersal order.
Skirmish Line
At 8:40, the 60 tac officers again
formed into a skirmish line which
charged the crowd, now numbering
approximately 200. This crowd then
split into two groups, the larger of
which was followed by 20 tac officers
and seven Palo Alto Police cars to the
Stanford Shopping Center and then to
the corner of Palm and Arboretum.

There they broke into small groups
and returned to Palo Alto. Several of
them were seen driving back on
campus shortly afterward.
The other of the two large groups
moved north on Palm Drive and into
the central campus. Once it reached
White Plaza the group divided once
again. According to Pacific Studies
Center researcher Lenny Siegel one of
these groups was "really chased hard."
Siegel said of the police that "they
were really hitting people."
The second new group was forced
around the Old Union towards Santa
Theresa Street by police.
McDonald was a member of this
group, which eventually met in the
Roble Lounge and then dispersed.

A torch-bearing crowd of 700
marching south on Palm Drive was
forced around the campus by 60
police tactical officers last night. The
60 officers were part of a 128-man
force on campus.
The destination of the march,
which began in Lytton Plaza on
University Ave., was the Hansen
Microwave Laboratory, but few of the
demonstrators made their way that far
into the campus.
Last night the Cowell Health Center
reported it had admitted three
Stanford students after they had been
treated in the Stanford Hospital
Emergency Room for head lacerations.
The Stanford Hospital said that it had
