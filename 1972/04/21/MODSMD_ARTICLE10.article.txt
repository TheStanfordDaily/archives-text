## University Traditions Eroding 
### 
(Editor's note: A copy of the
following letter has been sent by
members of the Faculty Political
Action Group Steering Committee
to President Lyman.)
Dear President Lyman:
Your recent letter to Richard
Nixon expressing "dismay and
outrage" at the renewed bombing
of North Vietnam expresses our
own sentiments. We thank you for
making this statement. The sense
of frustration your letter conveys
gives us reason to hope that you
may understand the dismay that
we felt in hearing or reading your
Report of March 3d to the
Academic Council.
Should you receive a response
from the White House, we believe
you may encounter the kinds of
arguments that you yourself
presented to the Academic
Council.
In the letter to President Nixon
you "wonder how civilians in
Hanoi and Haiphong feel about
such methods of 'diplomacy' "
(this last word your ironic touch).
But in your own statements
regarding the policies that should
govern our University, the
civilians of North Vietnam never
figure.
Is it possible that the crisis of
leadership and legitimacy we now
experience may have its roots in
confusion about the purposes of
the institutions of this nation?
One searches vainly in your
remarks for the suggestion of a
concern that the bases of the
authority of universities — in a
tradition of truth-searching
inspired by opposition to deceit
and cruelty in every form — may
be rapidly eroding.
Appropriate?
And is it appropriate to
recommend that political channels
be used to protest actions in
which Stanford participates
through research funding,
investment, and the provision of
facilities?
It is understandable, in times
like these, that one would wish to
"get to the centers of decision."
But our society is like the

University you described to the
council: there are many such
centers. Stanford is one of these
centers: decisions important to
the continued conduct of this
hateful war are made right here.
You are already at the center.
If you wish to get beyond the
"symbolic gesture" (as you say in
the Report), would it not be more
effective to address your letter to
members of the Board of Stanford
Trustees than to Nixon?; we
ought to be able to expect more
from the trustees of a major
institution of learning than from a
man like Richard Nixon.
Redirect
We write to request that you
redirect the letter which states
your thinking about the war (even
if you continue to speak as a

private citizen), and that, echoing
(almost) your words in the letter
to the New York Times, you urge
that a target date be set for
Stanford's total withdrawal from
the war, and that you also invite
the trustees and chief
administrators to join with faculty
and students in discussing
Stanford's military involvements.
"Far too often," you say,
"people speak as if the rights of
the institution and those of the
individual were polar opposites."
Right on, we say, and trust that
your remark indicates a rejection
of the lethal laissez-faire that finds
expression in the idea that every
faculty member should be free to
undertake whatever research he
chooses, regardless of where it
leads.
The research of some of our
colleagues, research which cannot
be defended as disinterested
search for truth, has made
hypocrites of the rest of us. When
such research denies life, the
continued conceptual
development of science is
threatened. You say, in the
Report, that we must accept
responsibility to future

generations and, again, right on.
That is the idea of the university.
Responsibility
The university exists because
society is prepared to accept this
responsibility; and, because some
men have understood that the
needs of tomorrow may conflict
with the interests of today,
societies have institutionalized
universities as critics.
What society doesn't always
admit — and here the critical role
of the university and its
commitment to certain traditions
of civilization may conflict with
what the business community and
those other constituencies you
mention may regard as loyalty —
is that men everywhere share in a
common destiny: the university is
as responsible for men elsewhere

.. .in your own statements regarding the policies that
should govern our university, dr. lyman, the civilians of
north Vietnam never figi'-e... .

on this planet as it is for
Americans.
Here again the truth of your
remarks about the social context
of rights is revealed. Men work
within institutions, and
institutions, in turn, are a part of
society. They are not neutral and
cannot be without sacrificing the
principles of their legitimacy.
Higher Loyalty
Your letter and the Report
indicate your awareness of this
higher loyalty, but you are
unwilling to exclude
representatives of the military or
war contractors (no matter how
genocidal the consequences of
their production) from use of
recruitment facilities. Such
discriminations, you say, would
be too difficult to make. This is
puzzling to us because you are
evidently prepared to support
mechanisms for handling much
more difficult problems, such as
the matter of faculty
self-discipline.
On the latter project, if we
may be permitted a brief
digression, we trust that you will
insist that the rights of the
university be considered in a

3 fpag steering committee

context that includes the rights of
the peoples of the world — just as
you insist that the rights of
individuals be related to the rights
of the institution. After you
mention the difficulty of
workable mechanisms vis a vis
selective recruitment, you move
to the issue of financial support
for the University, remarking,
along the way, that we must avoid
"policies that would increase the
degree to which the University
tries to run people's individual
lives for them."
This is unexceptionable. ("I
also wonder how civilians in these
cities feel about such methods of
'diplomacy'.") But we remind you
of your discussion of rights and
the many levels on which this
matter of rights must operate.
Bias
An end to NASA and Defense
contracts would be a $16 million
blow — not much more than the
first gift in the current
fund-raising campaign. Does
anybody really know that there
are not sources of financial
support from segments of the
community, heretofore not well
served by the University but who
might conceivably have an interest
in a rehabilitated Stanford?
Or from more recent alumni,
now disappointed by the direction
Stanford has taken? The loss of
contracts will be costly, but if we
are joined by others doing what
they can to block this destructive
policy in Indochina, the long-run
costs will be less than they
otherwise would be. Costs are
moral as well as financial.
You ask, in the Report, how
"Southeast Asian mankind"
(which is one with the rest of
mankind) "can be served by the
spectacle of a great univesity hung
up over issues . . . which will be
negligible." But they are issues
that we can do something about.
And we must. It is likely that
Southeast Asia will be better
served by Stanford's
disengagement from the war than
by our letters to Richard Nixon.
