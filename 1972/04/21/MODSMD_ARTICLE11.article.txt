## Stanford-In-The-Caribbean 
### 
You may remember in my last column (months ago — but then
that's the fault of this newspaper, not me) I revealed a plan presently
under consideration which would create 'disruption proof' lecture
halls.
(To refresh your memory, pour yourself a drink and curl up in
your favorite easy chair with a copy of a February 18 Daily.)
Now, let us jump two years into the future to a day when the plan
has long been implemented, and see what the logical result would
be. . . .
An alarming letter has arrived on campus from John Q. Senior, a
Human Bio major presently studying primate behavior at the field lab
on Puerto Rico.
In the letter to his roommate, John notes: "The other day, I made
a most curious observation. As I peeked out at the beach from the
cover of the semi-tropical brush, I saw a small sailboat land.
"From the boat stepped two familiar-looking men. They shook
hands with two more men reclining on the beach. After a friendly
conversational exchange which I could not make out, all four men,
whom I'm sure I have seen before, climbed aboard the boat and sailed
away.
Professors
"That night I couldn't sleep as I tried to remember where I had last
met the odd quartet. Then, it hit me! The falling cocoanut had
knocked me out cold, but when I regained consciousness, I realized
that the four men were all Stanford Professors! But why were they here,
and in the middle of the quarter?"
John's roommate, Skip, asked himself that same question. Could
he have only foreseen the tangled web of intrigue in which he would
soon be enmeshed, he would have wished he had never laid eyes on
that letter.
The next day in class, Skip could not concentrate on the face of
the professor flashing on the giant screen above. Turning to his buddy,
Sammy, he whispered, "Hey — you ever seen this prof around campus
lately?"
"Un unhh;" came the answer. "I even tried to make an
appointment with the guy once, but his secretary said he'd be busy
for the next six weeks and couldn't see me."
"You know, Skip — that happened to me too. I'm beginning to
think those secretaries know a little more than they'd care to tell,"
added Skip's girlfriend, Lucille.
"What does it all mean, Skip?" asked Sammy earnestly.
"I just don't quite know, Sammy. I've got an idea but my... my
mind is so cloudy. This thing's just getting too big. .. ."
Urgent Meeting
That evening Skip called an urgent meeting of representatives from
all major student groups. Radicals of all persuasions were there, as
well as jocks, red hots, dollies, and assorted apathetic masses.
Everyone agreed that few professors had been seen lately and that
secretaries in all the departments were uncooperative in making
appointments for students with faculty members. Skip addressed the
crowd:
"I move that there be a moratorium on all radical attempts to
destroy the TV screens in our classrooms until we get to the bottom
of this mystery."
"Right on, man;" answered someone, "But how are we gonna
make the secretaries talk?"
"I could pose as one and infiltrate their ranks," answered Lucille.
"Sorry, honey, but you're a bit young. They'd never fall for it. We
need a grad student skilled in the art of disguise," replied Sammy.
Finally a 7th ear female English post doctoral student was
persuaded into putting her hair into a short, simple bun, lower her
hemline 5 inches, put on a bra, and apply for a job as a secretary of
one of the departments.
A week later, she rushed into Skip's room, breathless, and grasping
a bundle of envelopes. "Skip .. . gasp ... look! These envelopes!
They're ... gasp ... the professors' answers to our questions. But
they're all postmarked from the Caribbean!"
The mist cleared from Skip's mind as the professors' nefarious plan
was revealed in its crystal clarity. The lecturers had pre-recorded their
presentations 6 months in advance and then had run off to the
Bahamas.
Action!
Stanford's entire student body instantly galvanized into action.
Events took place in a whirlwind flash of activity, events that were to
affect thousands of lives.
Every departmen I secretary was rounded up, herded into Stern
Hall, and placed under "house arrest." Before going into the other,
more important, student actions, this one demands a closer look.

The last issue of the Daily, published the day after the arrests, ran a
feature on the secretaries confined at Stern. One secretary was quoted
as saying, "Now I see why they call it the prison."
A force of 100 students was selected to patrol Stern Hall, making
sure no one attempted to escape. Another 100 students were sent to
all the academic departments to replace the arrested secretaries.
Mass Exodus
Meanwhile, most of the other students began packing their bags.
Within hours, they were on eastward-bound iets.
The students replacing the secretaries had the job of thinking up
meaningless questions to lectures and sending them periodically to the
vacationing professors. In this way, no suspicions were aroused in the
minds of the scholars.
Both these secretary surrogates and the Stern guard were on a
rotating basis; some of the departed students were to return every
quarter to relieve them.
The overwhelming majority of the students ended up on Caribbean
islands. What joy, what feelings of liberation they experienced amidst
the tropic breeze and the swaying palms!
Occasionally, a small band of loin cloth-clad former students would
run across a group of similarly-clad former professors. Then, the group
would share a true educational experience: an informal outdoor
seminar without pressure, grades, or competition — a meeting of open
minds.
It wasn't until a visiting accreditation team came to the farm and
discovered scores of hollow TV screens lecturing to empty classrooms,
that the full story finally leaked out.

A week later, she rushed into Skip's room, breathless, and grasping
a bundle of envelopes. "Skip .. . gasp ... look! These envelopes!
They're ... gasp ... the professors' answers to our questions. But
they're all postmarked from the Caribbean!"
The mist cleared from Skip's mind as the professors' nefarious plan
was revealed in its crystal clarity. The lecturers had pre-recorded their
presentations 6 months in advance and then had run off to the
Bahamas.
Action!
Stanford's entire student body instantly galvanized into action.
Events took place in a whirlwind flash of activity, events that were to
affect thousands of lives.
Every departmen I secretary was rounded up, herded into Stern
Hall, and placed under "house arrest." Before going into the other,
more important, student actions, this one demands a closer look.

The last issue of the Daily, published the day after the arrests, ran a
feature on the secretaries confined at Stern. One secretary was quoted
as saying, "Now I see why they call it the prison."
A force of 100 students was selected to patrol Stern Hall, making
sure no one attempted to escape. Another 100 students were sent to
all the academic departments to replace the arrested secretaries.
Mass Exodus
Meanwhile, most of the other students began packing their bags.
Within hours, they were on eastward-bound iets.
The students replacing the secretaries had the job of thinking up
meaningless questions to lectures and sending them periodically to the
vacationing professors. In this way, no suspicions were aroused in the
minds of the scholars.
Both these secretary surrogates and the Stern guard were on a
rotating basis; some of the departed students were to return every
quarter to relieve them.
The overwhelming majority of the students ended up on Caribbean
islands. What joy, what feelings of liberation they experienced amidst
the tropic breeze and the swaying palms!
Occasionally, a small band of loin cloth-clad former students would
run across a group of similarly-clad former professors. Then, the group
would share a true educational experience: an informal outdoor
seminar without pressure, grades, or competition — a meeting of open
minds.
It wasn't until a visiting accreditation team came to the farm and
discovered scores of hollow TV screens lecturing to empty classrooms,
that the full story finally leaked out.

You may remember in my last column (months ago — but then
that's the fault of this newspaper, not me) I revealed a plan presently
under consideration which would create 'disruption proof' lecture
halls.

Now, let us jump two years into the future to a day when the plan
has long been implemented, and see what the logical result would
be. . . .
An alarming letter has arrived on campus from John Q. Senior, a
Human Bio major presently studying primate behavior at the field lab
on Puerto Rico.
In the letter to his roommate, John notes: "The other day, I made
a most curious observation. As I peeked out at the beach from the
cover of the semi-tropical brush, I saw a small sailboat land.
"From the boat stepped two familiar-looking men. They shook
hands with two more men reclining on the beach. After a friendly
conversational exchange which I could not make out, all four men,
whom I'm sure I have seen before, climbed aboard the boat and sailed
away.
Professors
"That night I couldn't sleep as I tried to remember where I had last
met the odd quartet. Then, it hit me! The falling cocoanut had
knocked me out cold, but when I regained consciousness, I realized
that the four men were all Stanford Professors! But why were they here,
and in the middle of the quarter?"
John's roommate, Skip, asked himself that same question. Could
he have only foreseen the tangled web of intrigue in which he would
soon be enmeshed, he would have wished he had never laid eyes on
that letter.
The next day in class, Skip could not concentrate on the face of
the professor flashing on the giant screen above. Turning to his buddy,
Sammy, he whispered, "Hey — you ever seen this prof around campus
lately?"
"Un unhh;" came the answer. "I even tried to make an
appointment with the guy once, but his secretary said he'd be busy
for the next six weeks and couldn't see me."
"You know, Skip — that happened to me too. I'm beginning to
think those secretaries know a little more than they'd care to tell,"
added Skip's girlfriend, Lucille.
"What does it all mean, Skip?" asked Sammy earnestly.
"I just don't quite know, Sammy. I've got an idea but my... my
mind is so cloudy. This thing's just getting too big. .. ."
Urgent Meeting
That evening Skip called an urgent meeting of representatives from
all major student groups. Radicals of all persuasions were there, as
well as jocks, red hots, dollies, and assorted apathetic masses.
Everyone agreed that few professors had been seen lately and that
secretaries in all the departments were uncooperative in making
appointments for students with faculty members. Skip addressed the
crowd:
"I move that there be a moratorium on all radical attempts to
destroy the TV screens in our classrooms until we get to the bottom
of this mystery."
"Right on, man;" answered someone, "But how are we gonna
make the secretaries talk?"
"I could pose as one and infiltrate their ranks," answered Lucille.
"Sorry, honey, but you're a bit young. They'd never fall for it. We
need a grad student skilled in the art of disguise," replied Sammy.
Finally a 7th ear female English post doctoral student was
persuaded into putting her hair into a short, simple bun, lower her
hemline 5 inches, put on a bra, and apply for a job as a secretary of
one of the departments.
A week later, she rushed into Skip's room, breathless, and grasping
a bundle of envelopes. "Skip .. . gasp ... look! These envelopes!
They're ... gasp ... the professors' answers to our questions. But
they're all postmarked from the Caribbean!"
The mist cleared from Skip's mind as the professors' nefarious plan

knocked me out cold, but when I regained consciousness, I realized
that the four men were all Stanford Professors! But why were they here,
and in the middle of the quarter?"
John's roommate, Skip, asked himself that same question. Could
he have only foreseen the tangled web of intrigue in which he would
soon be enmeshed, he would have wished he had never laid eyes on
that letter.
The next day in class, Skip could not concentrate on the face of
the professor flashing on the giant screen above. Turning to his buddy,
Sammy, he whispered, "Hey — you ever seen this prof around campus
lately?"
"Un unhh;" came the answer. "I even tried to make an
appointment with the guy once, but his secretary said he'd be busy
for the next six weeks and couldn't see me."
"You know, Skip — that happened to me too. I'm beginning to
think those secretaries know a little more than they'd care to tell,"
added Skip's girlfriend, Lucille.
"What does it all mean, Skip?" asked Sammy earnestly.
"I just don't quite know, Sammy. I've got an idea but my... my
mind is so cloudy. This thing's just getting too big. .. ."
Urgent Meeting
That evening Skip called an urgent meeting of representatives from
all major student groups. Radicals of all persuasions were there, as
well as jocks, red hots, dollies, and assorted apathetic masses.
Everyone agreed that few professors had been seen lately and that
secretaries in all the departments were uncooperative in making
appointments for students with faculty members. Skip addressed the
crowd:
"I move that there be a moratorium on all radical attempts to
destroy the TV screens in our classrooms until we get to the bottom
of this mystery."
"Right on, man;" answered someone, "But how are we gonna
make the secretaries talk?"
"I could pose as one and infiltrate their ranks," answered Lucille.
"Sorry, honey, but you're a bit young. They'd never fall for it. We
need a grad student skilled in the art of disguise," replied Sammy.
Finally a 7th ear female English post doctoral student was
persuaded into putting her hair into a short, simple bun, lower her
hemline 5 inches, put on a bra, and apply for a job as a secretary of
one of the departments.
A week later, she rushed into Skip's room, breathless, and grasping
a bundle of envelopes. "Skip .. . gasp ... look! These envelopes!
They're ... gasp ... the professors' answers to our questions. But
they're all postmarked from the Caribbean!"
The mist cleared from Skip's mind as the professors' nefarious plan
was revealed in its crystal clarity. The lecturers had pre-recorded their
presentations 6 months in advance and then had run off to the
Bahamas.
Action!
Stanford's entire student body instantly galvanized into action.
Events took place in a whirlwind flash of activity, events that were to
affect thousands of lives.
Every departmen I secretary was rounded up, herded into Stern
Hall, and placed under "house arrest." Before going into the other,
more important, student actions, this one demands a closer look.

The last issue of the Daily, published the day after the arrests, ran a
feature on the secretaries confined at Stern. One secretary was quoted
as saying, "Now I see why they call it the prison."
A force of 100 students was selected to patrol Stern Hall, making
sure no one attempted to escape. Another 100 students were sent to
all the academic departments to replace the arrested secretaries.
Mass Exodus
Meanwhile, most of the other students began packing their bags.
Within hours, they were on eastward-bound iets.
The students replacing the secretaries had the job of thinking up
meaningless questions to lectures and sending them periodically to the
vacationing professors. In this way, no suspicions were aroused in the
minds of the scholars.
Both these secretary surrogates and the Stern guard were on a
rotating basis; some of the departed students were to return every
quarter to relieve them.
The overwhelming majority of the students ended up on Caribbean
islands. What joy, what feelings of liberation they experienced amidst
the tropic breeze and the swaying palms!
Occasionally, a small band of loin cloth-clad former students would
run across a group of similarly-clad former professors. Then, the group
would share a true educational experience: an informal outdoor
seminar without pressure, grades, or competition — a meeting of open
minds.
It wasn't until a visiting accreditation team came to the farm and
discovered scores of hollow TV screens lecturing to empty classrooms,
that the full story finally leaked out.

You may remember in my last column (months ago — but then
that's the fault of this newspaper, not me) I revealed a plan presently
under consideration which would create 'disruption proof' lecture
halls.
(To refresh your memory, pour yourself a drink and curl up in
your favorite easy chair with a copy of a February 18 Daily.)
Now, let us jump two years into the future to a day when the plan
has long been implemented, and see what the logical result would
be. . . .
An alarming letter has arrived on campus from John Q. Senior, a
Human Bio major presently studying primate behavior at the field lab
on Puerto Rico.
In the letter to his roommate, John notes: "The other day, I made
a most curious observation. As I peeked out at the beach from the
cover of the semi-tropical brush, I saw a small sailboat land.
"From the boat stepped two familiar-looking men. They shook
hands with two more men reclining on the beach. After a friendly
conversational exchange which I could not make out, all four men,
whom I'm sure I have seen before, climbed aboard the boat and sailed
away.
