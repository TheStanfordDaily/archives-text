Editor, THE DAILY:
Wednesday, in an editorial
characterizing the tremendous
international protest of the
bomb\ig of Hanoi-Haiphong as
"Pi.re formented strife" and not
"peace prompting" the Palo Alto
Times quoted me as saying that
"we should get up and march out
of here over to the labs; if there
are people in there, or windows,
we should hit them."
Since this quote originated in
Tuesday's Daily, I must correct a
basic inaccuracy. People who
work in Hansen Labs have asked
me what I meant by "people in
there." 1 didn't mean anything,
since it was never said. No
member of Venceremos would
ever talk about attacking the
people.
I spoke, instead, about the
"people" who might be outside. I
was referring to the riot-geared
agents of the state who usually
appear at anti-war demonstrations
to protect the machinery of
Imperialist war and tromp on the

people. If \*e have to shut down a
lab, we have to shut down a lab,
and the police have no right to
interfere. My purpose was to
remind people of their obligation
to shut down those labs in
solidarity with the incredible
victories of the Vietnamese; not
to be intimidated or deterred from
that purpose by the presence of
the police, and if necessary to
march right through.
Anyone who was at that
Monday meeting knows no one
needed to be "incited." On
campuses all across the country,
there is a militancy, a class
consciousness and degree of
political unity such as we haven't
seen before.
We have learned from the
Vietnamese people that this is a
protracted war and that no single
action in peoples' war insures
quick victory. The victory of the
Vietnamese people has been a
long time coming. They have
chosen this period to launch an

offensive. We can do no less than
have a peoples' offensive in this
country.
The Times calls for "restraint"
by which they mean that the
American people should adopt a
policy of appeasement towards
the brutal oppressors of other
men. They mean to split the
"peace" groups off from the
revolutionaries, but they are blind
to unity we now have â€” a unity
which will grow.
The labs at Stanford must no
longer be allowed to aid the
oppressors. And we shouldn't let
anyone stand in the way.
We should stand, with courage,
shoulder to shoulder with the
Vietnamese.

(Editor's Note: We apologize to
Youdelman and to our readers for
having misquoted him in
Tuesday's Daily. The actual
quotation, as recorded by KZSU
radio, was as follows: "We should
get up, we should march out of
here, we should march across that
field to the labs, and if we can get
in the labs let's get in the labs, and
if there are people standing in
front of those labs, or if there are
windows in those labs, let's hit
that. But we should move as
soldiers, as liberation fighters, to
knock out enemy installations.
That's what we should do, and we
should do it right now. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.")
