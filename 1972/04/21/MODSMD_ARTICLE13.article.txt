## Irresponsible 'Party Line' 
### 
The Daily, as the only daily
campus newspaper, has as its
responsibility the reporting of
news in an unbiased neutral
manner as well as serving as an
efficient forum for idea exchange.
It has become abundantly clear in
recent weeks that the publications
of the Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement are at best
unencumbered by such a
responsibility of either neutrality
or the willingness to even admit
the existence of inner dissent, i.e.
dissent within the dissent.
The biased attitude can be
excused because the one page and
oversize pamphlets that exhibit
the so-called party line are, after
all, the expressions of a narrow
interest group. The unwillingness
to either debate rationally or
admit dissent is a far greater
danger than many realize.
Mad Bomber
A good example of this misuse
of the power of the press is the
"David Packard: Mad Bomber of
the Year" leaflet, printed by a
"Committee for Just Rewards."
Its general tone reminds one of
the articles of another great
propagandist of several years ago.
His name was Dr. Goebbels. The
leaflet stated: The Palo Alto
downtown hospital, the Bank of
America Superblock, and the
Willow Expressway were all
buried under "the power of
people's opposition."
The quote attributes all of the

magical deeds to the people. This
in itself is a deliberate misuse of
terminology since each group of
people concerned in the three
incidents mentioned were power
interest groups, in much the same
manner as both the SRM and the
John Birch Society, although all
three of the interest groups
seemed to have valid arguments,
something which seems to be in
short supply in both the SRM and
the John Birch Society.
The hospital was not built
because of rising costs and
insufficient funds.
The Superblock has to a very
large degree become a reality in
the manner in which the designers
originally conceived. (The
physical structures have, in some
instances given way to realities,
but the concept remains.)
The Willow Expressway was an
idea turned down because of the
efforts of the "capitalistic" Menlo
Park citizens who wished to keep
Menlo Park a nice quiet, clean
area. i-' !'••
Hewlett-Packard
Hewlett-Packard is apparently
more a component supplier than a
war-machine-builder. It would be
unrealistic for them to demand
that the electronics they build be
used only for civilian uses,
although to a large degree they
are. And then the SRM is able to
state that Packard considers "the
people are their deadly enemies."

('Their' referring to the
manufacturers.)
The term "the people" is just
being misused. It would be better
if the text of the speech referred
to would have at least been
quoted by SRM. After all, what
should there be to hide behind a
facade of exaggerations and
untruths?
This is not a defense of
Packard, it is merely a protest
against the lies and hate which are
all too common. The freedom to
dissent is jeopardized when groups

such as SRM are so recalcitrant in
their responsibilities.
It is a price everyone will have
to pay, because egotistical and
malicious rumor as printed by
SRM reflect our own inability to
hear the truth. The even greater
danger is that if this continues,
there may be no more truth to
hear, but merely lies and
exaggerations, too much of which
is exhibited by the SRM and
similar organizations.

freshman.)
