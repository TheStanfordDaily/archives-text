## McGovern Seeks Ideal America 
### 
"Each time a man stands up
for an ideal," said Robert
Kennedy, "or acts to improve the
lot of others, he sends forth a tiny
ripple of hope, and those ripples
can send forth a current so strong
it can sweep down the mightiest
walls of oppression and tyranny."
For the last three years, in this
country, one man, above all
others, has been standing up for
an ideal. Often, he has stood
alone. The ideal has been an
America that feeds the hungry
and the helpless rather than
bombing them into the ground.
The Ideal America
The ideal has been an America
that used its energy and treasure
to meet the human needs of its
own people, rather than to
stockpile nuclear arsenals and
military forces large enough to
intervene wherever we thought
the preservation of our national
powel- and prestige required it.
The ideal has been an America

in which no corporation was too
large and powerful to pay a fair share
of taxes, and in which no single
person was too small and
powerless to have decent radical
care, decent housing, an adequate
income, and a chance at the best
educational and vocational
opportunities in the country.
The ideal has been an America
in which all men and women are
equals, with an equal stake in the
society, and an equal chance to
profit from its social, material,
and spiritual riches, an America
which reached out to the world
with its ploughshares rather than
its swords, with love instead of
hate, with hope instead of fear.
One man, more than any other,
has pursued that vision of
America with unrelenting passion
and faith. It drove him to oppose
our involvement in Indochina
years before most Americans ever
were aware of the extent of it. It
drove him to lead the battle in the
Senate against hunger in America.
It drove him to fight the draft,
and the erosion of our civil
liberties, and the web of
institutional racism in America
that has kept people of color with
fewer jobs, fewer opportunities,
worse schools, worse housing, and
removed from any positions of
real power.
A Full Year Ahead
A full year before any other
contender, that vision that burns
inside him drove him to announce
his candidacy for President of the
United States.
Then, George McGovern was
laughed at. He was the Don
Quixote of American politics. The
press dismissed him. He was a one
issue candidate, they said. The
party pros dismissed him. He was
too radical to be President, they
said. His colleagues in the House
and Senate dismissed him. He was
too decent, too honest, a man to
be President, they said.
Only the people did not
dismiss him, for there were those
ripples of hope, those currents of
truth that he kept speaking when
no one else would, and people had
been touched by them.
With nothing to build on but
grass-roots support, with no
charisma, no glamour, no
endorsements, and not much
money, he went about
constructing a campaign to be
President. u
While building, he kept
speaking his mind: on Vietnam,
on amnesty, on the military
budget, on the wage-price freeze.
Though everytime he broke new
ground on an issue someone
decided that he had committed
political suicide, he was
unaffected.
Harold Hughes, Birch Bayh,
Fred Harris and John Lindsay,

came and went. Ed Muskie started
reeling fast, and Hubert
Humphrey started rising fast.
George Wallace picked up where
he left off in 1968, attaching to
his racist, demagogic appeal, an
articulation of the honest
frustrations of middle and
lower-middle class whites.
Unconditional Amnesty
Undaunted through it all,
George McGovern continued
building. When he became the
first major political figure to call
for unconditional amnesty for
those who had resisted the draft,
he was regarded as somewhat nuts
— until, finally, other "liberals"
were forced to start talking about
amnesty too, though not all of
them unconditionally.
When he called for a $34
billion cut in the military budget
and a conversion of those funds

toward peacetime needs, skeptics
dismissed it as more vague
rhetoric about re-ordering
priorities — until he produced a
detailed breakdown of how he
would spend that money to tackle
the problems of urban and rural
poverty, bad housing, bad schools,
degenerate health care, crime, and
environmental decay.
When he produced that
domestic program, less progressive
political leaders accused him of
pie in the sky, challenging him to
identify where he was going to get
these 34 billion dollars out of the
Defense budget — and, lo and
behold, George McGovern
produced a 56 page line by line
account of precisely which $34
billion worth of military research
and hardware could be eliminated
with no loss to our military
security.

Finally, New Hampshire came,
and Edmund Muskie found that
you cannot ask people to trust
you when you do not tell them
where you stand or what you
believe in. McGovern didn't need
to ask for people's trust; he told
the Granite State voters where he
stood, and they believed him, and
with an army of volunteers behind
him, he scored an astounding 37%
of the vote.
Florida came, and Wallace
swept it clean. While Muskie, now
clearly sinking fast, was angrily
calling every Wallace vote a vote
for racism, and Humphrey was
gleefully jumping on the

anti-busing, anti-welfare
bandwagon, prostituting himself
and whatever good instincts might
have remained to him, and
Lindsay was ruefully wondering
why all that TV time had failed to
buy him the election, George
McGovern moved into Wisconsin,
the only candidate to the left of
Wallace understanding what the
Wallace vote was all about.
While party hacks were calling
Humphrey and Jackson the
party's only hope for stopping
George Wallace, McGovern started
talking in Wisconsin about the tax
structure in America, and about
how a federal government that
paid its first allegiance to the
super corporations had sold out
the working man in its economic
policies.
What was so impressive about
McGovern's showing in Wisconsin

...he has a unique capacity
to speak the truth about
what is happening to America

was that he won in every part of
the state, in almost every kind of
constituency. And, to the surprise
of everyone, he emerged as the
second choice of Wallace voters.
Very Awesome
Something very awesome is
happening. The most radical
candidate running for President is
appealing to George Wallace's
natural constituency in the North.
The least glamorous candidate is
beginning to turn on armies of
young people to carry his message
to the people. The campaign of a
Senator from South Dakota is
being transformed into a national
cause.
There is a revolution brewing
in this election year. The crisis of
confidence in not only
government, but in the political
process itself, is severe and
pervasive. The crisis of frustration
among decent working people
who are willing to turn to George
Wallace to get a government that
will care about them and their set
of problems is severe and

larry diamond

pervasive. And the level of
mistrust in both political parties
on the part of black and brown
people who are determined not to
be used again, not to be lied to
again, has never been higher.
Out of the chaos and confusion
of 1972, one candidate is
emerging who has a unique
capacity to unite these bases of
frustration, and show these
opposing constituencies that their
enemies are not each other, but
the rich and powerful corporate
few who now run and control
America.
This is a candidate who has a
unique capacity to speak the truth
about what is happening to
America, and what America is
doing to the world, and be
believed and respected for it.
This is a candidate who can get
America to dream again about the
promise of peace and freedom and
justice and equality of
opportunity for every man
woman and child in this country,
a promise that we have lost, but
can reclaim.
A year ago, most of us would
have said that for a flat-toned,
balding professor of history from
South Dakota, with nothing to
offer but his conviction that war
is wrong, that racial hatred and
injustice is wrong, that poverty
ahd hunger and unemployment
and urban and environmental rot
are needless and senseless and
wrong — for this man to be
elected President of the United
States we would have declared an
impossibility.
But now, not even David
Brinkley or Time magazine will call
it impossible, and if we love
America, if we are as pained as
George McGovern is by all the
death and suffering and neglect
that this nation has wreaked not
only upon its own people, but on
helpless people and nations
around the world, if we are
touched by George McGovern's
ripple of hope that America could
be something so much better —
than it is time to pour our energy,
our money and our lives in the
next six months into making him
our President.

member of the ASSU Council of
Presidents.)

Finally, New Hampshire came,
and Edmund Muskie found that
you cannot ask people to trust
you when you do not tell them
where you stand or what you
believe in. McGovern didn't need
to ask for people's trust; he told
the Granite State voters where he
stood, and they believed him, and
with an army of volunteers behind
him, he scored an astounding 37%
of the vote.
Florida came, and Wallace
swept it clean. While Muskie, now
clearly sinking fast, was angrily
calling every Wallace vote a vote
for racism, and Humphrey was
gleefully jumping on the

anti-busing, anti-welfare
bandwagon, prostituting himself
and whatever good instincts might
have remained to him, and
Lindsay was ruefully wondering
why all that TV time had failed to
buy him the election, George
McGovern moved into Wisconsin,
the only candidate to the left of
Wallace understanding what the
Wallace vote was all about.
While party hacks were calling
Humphrey and Jackson the
party's only hope for stopping
George Wallace, McGovern started
talking in Wisconsin about the tax
structure in America, and about
how a federal government that
paid its first allegiance to the
super corporations had sold out
the working man in its economic
policies.
What was so impressive about
McGovern's showing in Wisconsin

...he has a unique capacity
to speak the truth about
what is happening to America

was that he won in every part of
the state, in almost every kind of
constituency. And, to the surprise
of everyone, he emerged as the
second choice of Wallace voters.
Very Awesome
Something very awesome is
happening. The most radical
candidate running for President is
appealing to George Wallace's
natural constituency in the North.
The least glamorous candidate is
beginning to turn on armies of
young people to carry his message
to the people. The campaign of a
Senator from South Dakota is
being transformed into a national
cause.
There is a revolution brewing
in this election year. The crisis of
confidence in not only
government, but in the political
process itself, is severe and
pervasive. The crisis of frustration
among decent working people
who are willing to turn to George
Wallace to get a government that
will care about them and their set
of problems is severe and

larry diamond

pervasive. And the level of
mistrust in both political parties
on the part of black and brown
people who are determined not to
be used again, not to be lied to
again, has never been higher.
Out of the chaos and confusion
of 1972, one candidate is
emerging who has a unique
capacity to unite these bases of
frustration, and show these
opposing constituencies that their
enemies are not each other, but
the rich and powerful corporate
few who now run and control
America.
This is a candidate who has a
unique capacity to speak the truth
about what is happening to
America, and what America is
doing to the world, and be
believed and respected for it.
This is a candidate who can get
America to dream again about the
promise of peace and freedom and
justice and equality of
opportunity for every man
woman and child in this country,
a promise that we have lost, but
can reclaim.
A year ago, most of us would
have said that for a flat-toned,
balding professor of history from
South Dakota, with nothing to
offer but his conviction that war
is wrong, that racial hatred and
injustice is wrong, that poverty
ahd hunger and unemployment
and urban and environmental rot
are needless and senseless and
wrong — for this man to be
elected President of the United
States we would have declared an
impossibility.
But now, not even David
Brinkley or Time magazine will call
it impossible, and if we love
America, if we are as pained as
George McGovern is by all the
death and suffering and neglect
that this nation has wreaked not
only upon its own people, but on
helpless people and nations
around the world, if we are
touched by George McGovern's
ripple of hope that America could
be something so much better —
than it is time to pour our energy,
our money and our lives in the
next six months into making him
our President.
(Larry Diamond is a former
member of the ASSU Council of
Presidents.)


"The world will little note nor long remember what we say
here. ..
"Each time a man stands up
for an ideal," said Robert
Kennedy, "or acts to improve the
lot of others, he sends forth a tiny
ripple of hope, and those ripples
can send forth a current so strong
it can sweep down the mightiest
walls of oppression and tyranny."
For the last three years, in this
country, one man, above all
others, has been standing up for
an ideal. Often, he has stood
alone. The ideal has been an
America that feeds the hungry
and the helpless rather than
bombing them into the ground.
The Ideal America
The ideal has been an America
that used its energy and treasure
to meet the human needs of its
own people, rather than to
stockpile nuclear arsenals and
military forces large enough to
intervene wherever we thought
the preservation of our national
powel- and prestige required it.
The ideal has been an America

in which no corporation was too
large and powerful to pay a fair share
of taxes, and in which no single
person was too small and
powerless to have decent radical
care, decent housing, an adequate
income, and a chance at the best
educational and vocational
opportunities in the country.
The ideal has been an America
in which all men and women are
equals, with an equal stake in the
society, and an equal chance to
profit from its social, material,
and spiritual riches, an America
which reached out to the world
with its ploughshares rather than
its swords, with love instead of
hate, with hope instead of fear.
One man, more than any other,
has pursued that vision of
America with unrelenting passion
and faith. It drove him to oppose
our involvement in Indochina
years before most Americans ever
were aware of the extent of it. It
drove him to lead the battle in the
Senate against hunger in America.
It drove him to fight the draft,
and the erosion of our civil
liberties, and the web of
institutional racism in America
that has kept people of color with
fewer jobs, fewer opportunities,
worse schools, worse housing, and
removed from any positions of
real power.
A Full Year Ahead
A full year before any other
contender, that vision that burns
inside him drove him to announce
his candidacy for President of the
United States.
Then, George McGovern was
laughed at. He was the Don
Quixote of American politics. The
press dismissed him. He was a one
issue candidate, they said. The
party pros dismissed him. He was
too radical to be President, they
said. His colleagues in the House
and Senate dismissed him. He was
too decent, too honest, a man to
be President, they said.
Only the people did not
dismiss him, for there were those
ripples of hope, those currents of
truth that he kept speaking when
no one else would, and people had
been touched by them.
With nothing to build on but
grass-roots support, with no
charisma, no glamour, no
endorsements, and not much
money, he went about
constructing a campaign to be
President. u
While building, he kept
speaking his mind: on Vietnam,
on amnesty, on the military
budget, on the wage-price freeze.
Though everytime he broke new
ground on an issue someone
decided that he had committed
political suicide, he was
unaffected.
Harold Hughes, Birch Bayh,
Fred Harris and John Lindsay,

came and went. Ed Muskie started
reeling fast, and Hubert
Humphrey started rising fast.
George Wallace picked up where
he left off in 1968, attaching to
his racist, demagogic appeal, an
articulation of the honest
frustrations of middle and
lower-middle class whites.
Unconditional Amnesty
Undaunted through it all,
George McGovern continued
building. When he became the
first major political figure to call
for unconditional amnesty for
those who had resisted the draft,
he was regarded as somewhat nuts
— until, finally, other "liberals"
were forced to start talking about
amnesty too, though not all of
them unconditionally.
When he called for a $34
billion cut in the military budget
and a conversion of those funds

toward peacetime needs, skeptics
dismissed it as more vague
rhetoric about re-ordering
priorities — until he produced a
detailed breakdown of how he
would spend that money to tackle
the problems of urban and rural
poverty, bad housing, bad schools,
degenerate health care, crime, and
environmental decay.

South Dakota, with nothing to
offer but his conviction that war
is wrong, that racial hatred and
injustice is wrong, that poverty
ahd hunger and unemployment
and urban and environmental rot
are needless and senseless and
wrong — for this man to be
elected President of the United
States we would have declared an
impossibility.
But now, not even David
Brinkley or Time magazine will call
it impossible, and if we love
America, if we are as pained as
George McGovern is by all the
death and suffering and neglect
that this nation has wreaked not
only upon its own people, but on
helpless people and nations
around the world, if we are
touched by George McGovern's
ripple of hope that America could
be something so much better —
than it is time to pour our energy,
our money and our lives in the
next six months into making him
our President.

"The world will little note nor long remember what we say
here. ..
"Each time a man stands up
for an ideal," said Robert
Kennedy, "or acts to improve the
lot of others, he sends forth a tiny
ripple of hope, and those ripples
can send forth a current so strong
it can sweep down the mightiest
walls of oppression and tyranny."
For the last three years, in this
country, one man, above all
others, has been standing up for
an ideal. Often, he has stood
alone. The ideal has been an
America that feeds the hungry
and the helpless rather than
bombing them into the ground.
The Ideal America
The ideal has been an America
that used its energy and treasure
to meet the human needs of its
own people, rather than to
stockpile nuclear arsenals and
military forces large enough to
intervene wherever we thought
the preservation of our national
powel- and prestige required it.
The ideal has been an America

in which no corporation was too
large and powerful to pay a fair share
of taxes, and in which no single
person was too small and
powerless to have decent radical
care, decent housing, an adequate
income, and a chance at the best
educational and vocational
opportunities in the country.
The ideal has been an America
in which all men and women are
equals, with an equal stake in the
society, and an equal chance to
profit from its social, material,
and spiritual riches, an America
which reached out to the world
with its ploughshares rather than
its swords, with love instead of
hate, with hope instead of fear.
One man, more than any other,
has pursued that vision of
America with unrelenting passion
and faith. It drove him to oppose
our involvement in Indochina
years before most Americans ever
were aware of the extent of it. It
drove him to lead the battle in the
Senate against hunger in America.
It drove him to fight the draft,
and the erosion of our civil
liberties, and the web of
institutional racism in America
that has kept people of color with
fewer jobs, fewer opportunities,
worse schools, worse housing, and
removed from any positions of
real power.
A Full Year Ahead
A full year before any other
contender, that vision that burns
inside him drove him to announce
his candidacy for President of the
United States.
Then, George McGovern was
laughed at. He was the Don
Quixote of American politics. The
press dismissed him. He was a one
issue candidate, they said. The
party pros dismissed him. He was
too radical to be President, they
said. His colleagues in the House
and Senate dismissed him. He was
too decent, too honest, a man to
be President, they said.
Only the people did not
dismiss him, for there were those
ripples of hope, those currents of
truth that he kept speaking when
no one else would, and people had
been touched by them.
With nothing to build on but
grass-roots support, with no
charisma, no glamour, no
endorsements, and not much
money, he went about
constructing a campaign to be
President. u
While building, he kept
speaking his mind: on Vietnam,
on amnesty, on the military
budget, on the wage-price freeze.
Though everytime he broke new
ground on an issue someone
decided that he had committed
political suicide, he was
unaffected.
Harold Hughes, Birch Bayh,
Fred Harris and John Lindsay,

came and went. Ed Muskie started
reeling fast, and Hubert
Humphrey started rising fast.
George Wallace picked up where
he left off in 1968, attaching to
his racist, demagogic appeal, an
articulation of the honest
frustrations of middle and
lower-middle class whites.
Unconditional Amnesty
Undaunted through it all,
George McGovern continued
building. When he became the
first major political figure to call
for unconditional amnesty for
those who had resisted the draft,
he was regarded as somewhat nuts
— until, finally, other "liberals"
were forced to start talking about
amnesty too, though not all of
them unconditionally.
When he called for a $34
billion cut in the military budget
and a conversion of those funds

toward peacetime needs, skeptics
dismissed it as more vague
rhetoric about re-ordering
priorities — until he produced a
detailed breakdown of how he
would spend that money to tackle
the problems of urban and rural
poverty, bad housing, bad schools,
degenerate health care, crime, and
environmental decay.
When he produced that
domestic program, less progressive
political leaders accused him of
pie in the sky, challenging him to
identify where he was going to get
these 34 billion dollars out of the
Defense budget — and, lo and
behold, George McGovern
produced a 56 page line by line
account of precisely which $34
billion worth of military research
and hardware could be eliminated
with no loss to our military
security.

Finally, New Hampshire came,
and Edmund Muskie found that
you cannot ask people to trust
you when you do not tell them
where you stand or what you
believe in. McGovern didn't need
to ask for people's trust; he told
the Granite State voters where he
stood, and they believed him, and
with an army of volunteers behind
him, he scored an astounding 37%
of the vote.
Florida came, and Wallace
swept it clean. While Muskie, now
clearly sinking fast, was angrily
calling every Wallace vote a vote
for racism, and Humphrey was
gleefully jumping on the

anti-busing, anti-welfare
bandwagon, prostituting himself
and whatever good instincts might
have remained to him, and
Lindsay was ruefully wondering
why all that TV time had failed to
buy him the election, George
McGovern moved into Wisconsin,
the only candidate to the left of
Wallace understanding what the
Wallace vote was all about.
While party hacks were calling
Humphrey and Jackson the
party's only hope for stopping
George Wallace, McGovern started
talking in Wisconsin about the tax
structure in America, and about
how a federal government that
paid its first allegiance to the
super corporations had sold out
the working man in its economic
policies.
What was so impressive about
McGovern's showing in Wisconsin

...he has a unique capacity
to speak the truth about
what is happening to America

was that he won in every part of
the state, in almost every kind of
constituency. And, to the surprise
of everyone, he emerged as the
second choice of Wallace voters.
Very Awesome
Something very awesome is
happening. The most radical
candidate running for President is
appealing to George Wallace's
natural constituency in the North.
The least glamorous candidate is
beginning to turn on armies of
young people to carry his message
to the people. The campaign of a
Senator from South Dakota is
being transformed into a national
cause.
There is a revolution brewing
in this election year. The crisis of
confidence in not only
government, but in the political
process itself, is severe and
pervasive. The crisis of frustration
among decent working people
who are willing to turn to George
Wallace to get a government that
will care about them and their set
of problems is severe and

larry diamond

pervasive. And the level of
mistrust in both political parties
on the part of black and brown
people who are determined not to
be used again, not to be lied to
again, has never been higher.
Out of the chaos and confusion
of 1972, one candidate is
emerging who has a unique
capacity to unite these bases of
frustration, and show these
opposing constituencies that their
enemies are not each other, but
the rich and powerful corporate
few who now run and control
America.
This is a candidate who has a
unique capacity to speak the truth
about what is happening to
America, and what America is
doing to the world, and be
believed and respected for it.
This is a candidate who can get
America to dream again about the
promise of peace and freedom and
justice and equality of
opportunity for every man
woman and child in this country,
a promise that we have lost, but
can reclaim.
A year ago, most of us would
have said that for a flat-toned,
balding professor of history from
South Dakota, with nothing to
offer but his conviction that war
is wrong, that racial hatred and
injustice is wrong, that poverty

on amnesty, on the military
budget, on the wage-price freeze.
Though everytime he broke new
ground on an issue someone
decided that he had committed
political suicide, he was
unaffected.
Harold Hughes, Birch Bayh,
Fred Harris and John Lindsay,

came and went. Ed Muskie started
reeling fast, and Hubert
Humphrey started rising fast.
George Wallace picked up where
he left off in 1968, attaching to
his racist, demagogic appeal, an
articulation of the honest
frustrations of middle and
lower-middle class whites.
Unconditional Amnesty
Undaunted through it all,
George McGovern continued
building. When he became the
first major political figure to call
for unconditional amnesty for
those who had resisted the draft,
he was regarded as somewhat nuts
— until, finally, other "liberals"
were forced to start talking about
amnesty too, though not all of
them unconditionally.
When he called for a $34
billion cut in the military budget
and a conversion of those funds

toward peacetime needs, skeptics
dismissed it as more vague
rhetoric about re-ordering
priorities — until he produced a
detailed breakdown of how he
would spend that money to tackle
the problems of urban and rural
poverty, bad housing, bad schools,
degenerate health care, crime, and
environmental decay.
When he produced that
domestic program, less progressive
political leaders accused him of
pie in the sky, challenging him to
identify where he was going to get
these 34 billion dollars out of the
Defense budget — and, lo and
behold, George McGovern
produced a 56 page line by line
account of precisely which $34
billion worth of military research
and hardware could be eliminated
with no loss to our military
security.

Finally, New Hampshire came,
and Edmund Muskie found that
you cannot ask people to trust
you when you do not tell them
where you stand or what you
believe in. McGovern didn't need
to ask for people's trust; he told
the Granite State voters where he
stood, and they believed him, and
with an army of volunteers behind
him, he scored an astounding 37%
of the vote.
Florida came, and Wallace
swept it clean. While Muskie, now
clearly sinking fast, was angrily
calling every Wallace vote a vote
for racism, and Humphrey was
gleefully jumping on the

anti-busing, anti-welfare
bandwagon, prostituting himself
and whatever good instincts might
have remained to him, and
Lindsay was ruefully wondering
why all that TV time had failed to
buy him the election, George
McGovern moved into Wisconsin,
the only candidate to the left of
Wallace understanding what the
Wallace vote was all about.
While party hacks were calling
Humphrey and Jackson the
party's only hope for stopping
George Wallace, McGovern started
talking in Wisconsin about the tax
structure in America, and about
how a federal government that
paid its first allegiance to the
super corporations had sold out
the working man in its economic
policies.
What was so impressive about
McGovern's showing in Wisconsin

...he has a unique capacity
to speak the truth about
what is happening to America

was that he won in every part of
the state, in almost every kind of
constituency. And, to the surprise
of everyone, he emerged as the
second choice of Wallace voters.
Very Awesome
Something very awesome is
happening. The most radical
candidate running for President is
appealing to George Wallace's
natural constituency in the North.
The least glamorous candidate is
beginning to turn on armies of
young people to carry his message
to the people. The campaign of a
Senator from South Dakota is
being transformed into a national
cause.
There is a revolution brewing
in this election year. The crisis of
confidence in not only
government, but in the political
process itself, is severe and
pervasive. The crisis of frustration
among decent working people
who are willing to turn to George
Wallace to get a government that
will care about them and their set
of problems is severe and

larry diamond

pervasive. And the level of
mistrust in both political parties
on the part of black and brown
people who are determined not to
be used again, not to be lied to
again, has never been higher.
Out of the chaos and confusion
of 1972, one candidate is
emerging who has a unique
capacity to unite these bases of
frustration, and show these
opposing constituencies that their
enemies are not each other, but
the rich and powerful corporate
few who now run and control
America.
This is a candidate who has a
unique capacity to speak the truth
about what is happening to
America, and what America is
doing to the world, and be
believed and respected for it.
This is a candidate who can get
America to dream again about the
promise of peace and freedom and
justice and equality of
opportunity for every man
woman and child in this country,
a promise that we have lost, but
can reclaim.
A year ago, most of us would
have said that for a flat-toned,
balding professor of history from
South Dakota, with nothing to
offer but his conviction that war
is wrong, that racial hatred and
injustice is wrong, that poverty
ahd hunger and unemployment
and urban and environmental rot
are needless and senseless and
wrong — for this man to be
elected President of the United
States we would have declared an
impossibility.
But now, not even David
Brinkley or Time magazine will call
it impossible, and if we love
America, if we are as pained as
George McGovern is by all the
death and suffering and neglect
that this nation has wreaked not
only upon its own people, but on
helpless people and nations
around the world, if we are
touched by George McGovern's
ripple of hope that America could
be something so much better —
than it is time to pour our energy,
our money and our lives in the
next six months into making him
our President.
(Larry Diamond is a former
member of the ASSU Council of
Presidents.)


"The world will little note nor long remember what we say
here. ..
"Each time a man stands up
for an ideal," said Robert
Kennedy, "or acts to improve the
lot of others, he sends forth a tiny
ripple of hope, and those ripples
can send forth a current so strong
it can sweep down the mightiest
walls of oppression and tyranny."
For the last three years, in this
country, one man, above all
others, has been standing up for
an ideal. Often, he has stood
alone. The ideal has been an
America that feeds the hungry
and the helpless rather than
bombing them into the ground.
The Ideal America
The ideal has been an America
that used its energy and treasure
to meet the human needs of its
own people, rather than to
stockpile nuclear arsenals and
military forces large enough to
intervene wherever we thought
the preservation of our national
powel- and prestige required it.
The ideal has been an America

in which no corporation was too
large and powerful to pay a fair share
of taxes, and in which no single
person was too small and
powerless to have decent radical
care, decent housing, an adequate
income, and a chance at the best
educational and vocational
opportunities in the country.
The ideal has been an America
in which all men and women are
equals, with an equal stake in the
society, and an equal chance to
profit from its social, material,
and spiritual riches, an America
which reached out to the world
with its ploughshares rather than
its swords, with love instead of
hate, with hope instead of fear.
One man, more than any other,
has pursued that vision of
America with unrelenting passion
and faith. It drove him to oppose
our involvement in Indochina
years before most Americans ever
were aware of the extent of it. It
drove him to lead the battle in the
Senate against hunger in America.
It drove him to fight the draft,
and the erosion of our civil
liberties, and the web of
institutional racism in America
that has kept people of color with
fewer jobs, fewer opportunities,
worse schools, worse housing, and
removed from any positions of
real power.
A Full Year Ahead
A full year before any other
contender, that vision that burns
inside him drove him to announce
his candidacy for President of the
United States.
Then, George McGovern was
laughed at. He was the Don
Quixote of American politics. The
press dismissed him. He was a one
issue candidate, they said. The
party pros dismissed him. He was
too radical to be President, they
said. His colleagues in the House
and Senate dismissed him. He was
too decent, too honest, a man to
be President, they said.
Only the people did not
dismiss him, for there were those
ripples of hope, those currents of
truth that he kept speaking when
no one else would, and people had
been touched by them.
With nothing to build on but
grass-roots support, with no
charisma, no glamour, no
endorsements, and not much
money, he went about
constructing a campaign to be
President. u
While building, he kept
speaking his mind: on Vietnam,
on amnesty, on the military
budget, on the wage-price freeze.
Though everytime he broke new
ground on an issue someone
decided that he had committed
political suicide, he was
unaffected.
