## FPAG Endorses Strike 
### 
The Stanford Faculty Political Action Group
supports the national movement for strike action to
protest the bombing of North Vietnam.
America's destruction of Indochina must end.
Naval and air forces as well as ground troops must
be brought home. President Nixon's criminal
policies must be reversed.
Universities are not impotent, nor are they lonely
islands of dissent. There is profound national
dissatisfaction with the corrupt, cynical,
imperialistic Nixon regime. We must speak out. We
will be heard.
Speeches, however, are not enough. There must
be action. It is time for our universities to devote
themselves to peace and learning, to disentangle
themselves from the web that binds their economic
future to their support of perpetual warfare.
Military recruitment on campus must stop. Stanford
must end its official role as a supplier of young men
available for murder and for participation in war
crimes. That we can have educated young men to
serve such ends is in itself a great failure of our
institution.
There must also be a firm commitment to phase
out war research — first and foremost those
contracts for developing instruments of electronic
and air warfare. The Department of Defense funds
projects it believes can be utilized to accomplish its
mission, the exportation of death, destruction and

faculty political action group

genocide beyond the borders of the U.S. The
Pentagon's chief enemy is not the Soviet Union. It is
not even China. It is the poor, exploited, oppressed
peoples of the Third World who are struggling in
Asia, Africa and Latin America, and even here in the
U.S.A., in movements of national liberation.
We do not seek the destruction of our university,
but its regeneration. It is those who have turned it
into an arm of industrial and military imperialism
who have corrupted it. That is what we seek to
change.
To that end, the Steering Committee of FPAG
decided on Wednesday:
1) To reaffirm that protest here against the
bombing which does not also protest the
involvement of Stanford in the war is not credible;
2) To support strike action, not necessarily
limited to Friday, and urge that strike activities pay
particular attention to war-related activities at
Stanford;
3) To invite, and also to urge President Lyman to
invite, trustees and administrators and principal
investigators of Defense Department projects to a
public discussion with us next week concerning
war-related activities at Stanford. Should the
invitation be declined, we intend to visit individuals
in this group in their offices to hold the discussions.
