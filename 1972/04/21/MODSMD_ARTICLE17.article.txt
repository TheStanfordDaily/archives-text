# Campus Judicial Panel Opinion In the Case of Kwonping Ho
## 
### 
For the reasons we state below at some length, we
feel that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case should be
dismissed. Under the circumstances of this case, Mr. Ho
cannot be convicted of the violation of the Fundamental
Standard found in the hearing examiner's report, and a
remand to the hearing examiner for the cure of the
defect in the hearing before him is, under the facts of
this case, not a fair alternative.
The defendant, Mr. Ho, was charged before the Cam
pus Judicial Panel by the University administration with
a violation of the Fundamental Standard in two particu
lars: that he committed an assault and that he "together
with others, forced his way into the kitchen of the
Stanford Faculty Club for the purpose of stealing food
from that kitchen." The hearing examiner acquitted Mr.
Ho of the first charge, the assault. As to the second
charge, the hearing examiner found, in essence, that
though Mr. Ho had no purpose to steal food from the
kitchen, he had nonetheless helped force his way into
the kitchen. The specific findings of the hearing exam
iner (with their contexts in brackets) are:
3. 1 find that Mr. Ho was informed by responsible
officials of the Faculty Club, whose position of re
sponsibility was known to him, that he was not
allowed in the rear of the Club. [Past the doors which
led to the kitchen]
4. I find that Mr. Ho by words and gestures, encour
aged the persons in the dining area to assist him in
gaining access to the hallway [on the other side of
the doors]
5. I find that the double doors leading to the hallway
were opened in response to physical force exerted by
Mr. Ho and others, [and against the resistance of two
faculty club employees]
In short, Mr. Ho was found to have forced his way into
an area where he had been told by legitimate authority
that he had no business.
No justification for Mr. Ho's acts appearing, we have
no doubt that the hearing examiner's report makes out
what, at least in our opinion, is a clear violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The issue before us, however, is
not whether Mr. Ho is guilty, but whether he has been
properly and fairly found guilty under our procedures.
LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES IN GENERAL
The threshold issue in the determination of this case
is whether the Fundamental Standard violation proven
against Mr. Ho is one of which he could be convicted,
despite the failure of the prosecution to prove its allega
tion that Mr. Ho had committed his act with a purpose
to steal food. If it was not, we need proceed no further.
The prosecution alleges that defendant was properly
convicted under a "lesser included offense" theory. It is,
indeed, a general principle of law in criminal prosecu
tions that, if the prosecution charges that the defendant
did act A with an intent to accomplish Band the
prosecution proves that the defendant did act A but
cannot meet its burden of proof on the defendant's
intent to do B, the defendant may nonetheless be con
victed of doing act A-if that act is also, in itself, an
offense. Thus, if a defendant is charged with assault with
intent to kill and the prosecution cannot sustain its
burden as to the intent, the defendant may nonetheless
be convicted of the lesser included offense of assault
assuming, of course, that assault is an offense within the
legal system in question.
Indeed, the principle covers more than simply cases
where the prosecution is unable to prove an intent it has
charged. A defendant may be convicted of assault where
the prosecution has charged him with assault with a
deadly weapon. And if a defendant is charged with
drunken driving but the prosecution cannot prove that
he was actually driving, (either because he might have
been merely a passenger or because the car might have
been motionless) the defendant may, nonetheless, be
convicted of being drunk in an automobile-assuming, of
course, that under the law of that jurisdiction, (as is the
case in California), being drunk in an automobile is also
a punishable offense.
In short, in the criminal system at large, where a
defendant is charged with all the elements of an offense,
he is on notice that he must defend against any combina
tion of these factual elements which also is punishable.
One of the issues before us in this case is whether this is
the proper rule before the CJP, as well.
THE BURGLARY ANALOGY
Defense counsel make two basic arguments on this
issue. First, they argue that the original charge at issue
here, entering a room with intent to commit an offense
therein, is very much like the charges lodged in the local
courts for violation of the California burglary statute.
Since, under California law, burglary has no lesser
included offenses (except, of course, attempted bur
glary), defendant argues that the same rule should pre
vail before the CJP. In other words, since we are reason
ing by analogy here, defendant claims that the analogy
to the specific California burglary rule should prevail
before the CJP over the more general analogy to the
failure to prove an intent charged.
We do not find this argument persuasive. The reason
why the California burglary statute has no lesser
included offense is simply that the act of entering a
room or building is not illegal at all, unless it occurs
together with the forbidden intent. Hence, unless the
prosecution can show that intent, the defendant is guilty
of no wrongful conduct whatsoever. Interestingly, in
most states, where burglary requires a breaking and
entering as well as an intent, the crime does have a lesser
included offense, "breaking and entering." Here, where
entirely apart from any purpose to steal, the act of the
defendant, under the circumstances of this case, would
seem to us to be a clear violation of the Fundamental
Standard, the analogy to the California burglary statute
appears inapposite.

LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES
IN FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD CASES
The second contention of the defendant on this issue
is more troublesome The defendant would have us hold,
on much broader grounds, that the lesser included offen
se doctrine can never apply to Fundamental Standard
violations. Defense counsel contend that where the pros
ecution charges facts amounting to a Fundamental Stan
dard violation, but does not prove all of those facts, the
prosecution cannot prevail, even though the lesser facts
it has proven also amount to Fundamental Standard
violation.
THE PROBLEM OF SURPRISE
Defendant's argument is premised in part on the lact
that the Fundamental Standard is so broad that a defen
dant attempting to meet a charge of its violation is
vulnerable to surprise at the hearing through the intro
duction of facts and issues he is unprepared to meet.
Defendant recognizes, as he must, that no frontal attack
upon the Fundamental Standard is possible. After all, it
has been a part of University law since the time of David
Starr Jordan. The defense earnestly contends, however,
that the allowance of a lesser included offense within a
Fundamental Standard charge compounds unduly what
is a built-in problem in the administration of such a
broad rule.
This facet of the defense argument is considerably
weakened by the alternative remedy available to defen
dants under the CJP procedures. Indeed, the CJP proce
dures can be far better adapted to protecting a defen
dant against surprise than can those of the outside soci
ety. In the criminal trial, a defendant who is surprised by
the prosecution's introduction of an issue cannot have
the jury kept together for an appreciable time while he
attempts to find new evidence to meet the prosecution's
evidence. Under the CJP system, the remedy to avoid
any surprise is simply the right of the party to ask the
hearing officer for sufficient time to produce his evi
dence. We cannot conceive of any reasonable continu
ance being denied by a hearing officer in a situation
where a claim of surprise or lack of notice is made in
good faith. And, if such a request for reasonable contin
uance is denied, the claim of prejudice due to lack of
notice is raisable before this Panel, as well.
Defendant's complaint as to the Fundamental Stan
dard, however, is broader than merely that its vagueness
offers insufficient protection against surprise at trial.
The defense's complaint is that uncertainty in exactly
what constitutes a Fundamental Standard violation
places the defense in jeopardy in other ways.
First of all, we should distinguish this argument from
another quite different one which sounds somewhat
similar. The defendant is not here contending that he
should be acquitted because the Fundamental Standard
is so vague that he did not know that what he was doing
in the Faculty Club was in violation of University law.
To be sure, at its outer edges the Fundamental Standard
is extremely murky, but a defendant whose acts are a
clear violation cannot raise the fact that others might
violate the Standard unwittingly. Indeed, the issue is not
whether the defendant knew his actions were in viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard, but whether he
should have known.
THE RIGHT NOT TO HELP THE PROSECUTION
However, it is in part because of the fact that a
student can be guilty of a Fundamental Standard viola
tion even though he believes he is correct and the com
munity judgment wrong, that we must pay particular
attention to defense counsel's argument on this issue.
The claim in essence is that the minimal limits of the
Fundamental Standard are so indefinite that a defendant
may be unable to meet a charge of Fundamental Stand
ard violation without, perhaps, helping the prosecution
prove some lesser included offense.
It is not a complete answer to this to say that in order
for discipline to be imposed, the Fundamental Standard
violation must be clear to us. It is quite conceivable that
a defense attorney, with values similar to those of his
client, might not appreciate that certain actions did
constitute a Fundamental Standard violation clear to the
rest of the community. In such a case, he might indeed
unwittingly help the prosecution prove its case.
For the most part, however, we do not apprehend
that this difficulty faced by a defendant is a sympathetic
one considering the structure of our proceedings and the
protections the defendant does have. The basic purpose
of the hearing before the examiner is to find out the
facts—who did what, when and where, with what state
of mind. Certainly, the hearing examiner must perform
his function in a way fair to the defendant and giving
full effect to any specific rights provided by our rules.
The hearing before the hearing examiner, however, is not
a game. The defendant certainly has the right to put the
prosecution to its proof, but if he helps prow the facts
which actually exist, we cannot regard this as a disadvan
tage of the CJP procedures.
In one situation, however, the defendant's fear of
helping the prosecution prove its case is entitled to
recognition. Our rules give a defendant a specific right
not to testify and we should give this right a broad
scope. Part of such a scope is to make sure that a
defendant, in exercising his right, fully appreciates the
consequences to himself. Accordingly, should a defen
dant admit at the hearing facts which he may not appre
ciate constitute a violation, he should be warned that
this is the case and be given an opportunity to withdraw
his statement before his conviction can be founded on
his testimony. If he does withdraw his admission and
does not within the scope of cross examination repeat it,
his statement may not be considered against him by the
hearing officer or this Panel.
This rule, however, is not determinative of this case.
The (act is that, rather than admitting the lesser included
offense alleged by the prosecutor here as a basis for
conviction, Mr. Ho denied that he had exerted any force
on the door.
THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE ALL FACTS
Another facet ot defendant's argument is also related
to the possibility of failure to appreciate facts showing a
Fundamental Standard violation. Defendant argues that

because a defendant and his counsel might not recognize
the significance of facts which amounted to a Funda
mental Standard violation, these facts might not be fully
and tairly litigatej. As a result, the hearing examiner
might find untrae, misleading or incomplete facts. We
recognize this problem, but feel the solution is not to
prevent the finding of lesser included offenses in Funda
mental Standard cases. Rather, it is to give the defendant
full opportunity and notice to litigate any fact which
may be important to the disposition of his case-a mat
ter to which we will return shortly.
THE PLEADING REQUIREMENTS OF THE CJP
Finally, our decision that lesser included offenses can
be shown in Fundamental Standard cases is buttressed
by another consideration. The major operative effect of
accepting defendant's position would be to force the
prosecutor, in drafting his charges in the future, to join
all of the possible factual elements he thought he might
be able to prove, separately and in combination as sepa
rate charges. This would be complicated enough in sim
ple Fundamental Standard cases. It would be even more
so where Disruption charges and Fundamental Standard
violations are joined-as they might have been in this
case. Disruptions, most of which—when they are not
within a justification defense—are probably also Funda
mental Standard violations, can overlap in complex ways
with Fundamental Standard violations.
There is not sufficient reason to place such a burden
of drafting upon the prosecutor, especially since in those
jurisdictions which have attempted to guarantee com
plete notice through pleading, the pleadings have be
come so prolix and confusing that they became an
obstruction to rational fact finding. Moreover, though
the vagueness of the Fundamental Standard may work
against the defense, the lack of weaponry given to the
prosecutor in our system works against him even more,
in attempting to learn with a high degree of precision the
facts of the events leading to his charge. Unlike the
prosecutor in the civil courts, the University administra
tion has no equivalent of a grand jury subpoena (indeed
it cannot even subpoena witnesses at trial). Moreover,
the prosecutor in the university system has no right to a
preliminary hearing which can permit the prosecutor in
the civil society to determine, to a much greater extent,
which facts he can and which he cannot prove at trial,
and hence to shape his charges better.
Indeed the issue of whether to allow lesser included
offenses in Fundamental Standard violations is only one
facet of a much larger problem—the purpose of the
charge in the CJP procedures. Although there are obvi
ously many analogies to the criminal law in our proce
dures—most obviously the requirement of a reasonable
doubt standard—these are not criminal cases. This is
made clear by the relatively limited nature of our sanc
tions, which-though we regard them as quite severe—are
hardly equal to those of the criminal courts; the fact
that consequences and procedures similar to ours are
used in obviously civil cases such as those involving
industrial relations and faculty discipline; and the prin
ciple that the major purpose of society is, in a sense to
enforce its law, while the major purposes for which the
University exists, and which control its allocations of
resources, are education and the advancement of know
ledge.
The purpose of the charge in our system is analogous
to that under the more modern civil rules. It is not what
is called "fact" or "issue" pleading, but is "notice"
pleading where the purpose of the charge is to specify
the general area for litigation while other devices are
relied upon to permit full and fair litigation of the facts.
In a civil case, it is quite common for one side or the
other to move at the end of trial to amend its pleadings
to conform to the evidence produced. This motion is
generally granted where no prejudice to the other party
is shown. Indeed, even in criminal cases prosecuted by
information (in which, as in the University, the prosecu
tor rather than a grand jury brings the charges) the
prosecutor may amend his pleading during trial to cover
any offense shown by the evidence.
It should be made clear that our view of the CJP
pleading requirements is as likely to benefit the defen
dant as the prosecutor. We must remember that the CJP
system recognizes within itself the concept of double
jeopardy and a defendant, once acquitted of a charge
before the CJP, cannot be retried on the same charge in
our system regardless of what new evidence of his guilt
the prosecutor can discover. Since that is the case, a
narrow construction of the charge will permit the prose
cutor to retry the defendant on a closely related but
different charge, while the view that the charge before us
is broader than that in the criminal law will more nar
rowly restrict the prosecutor in subsequent charges.
In the criminal system, the more narrowly defined
relationship between the words of the charge and the
crimes of which the defendant may be convicted can
have severe consequences to the defendant. In a criminal
case, where the defendant has burned down a building,
killing several of its occupants, the prosecutor can, in
almost all jurisdictions, convict him of one murder after
another based on the same fact situation, until the jury
returns the death sentence that the prosecutor desires.
Our rule prevents the vices of a narrow construction of
charges, and, if a consequence of preventing such abuse
is a broadening of the relation between the charge and
the evidence, we think that both in terms of fairness to
the defendant and accuracy in the fact-finding process, it
is the better choice.
THE REASON FOR REVERSAL
Our disagreement with the defendants on the allow
ance of lesser included offenses in Fundamental Stan
dard cases by no means settles this case, however. All we
have thus far held is that, if the hearing is a fair one, a
defendant charged with forcing one's way into a room
with a purpose to steal can be convicted of simply
forcing his way into the room-where the circumstances
are such that that act is also a violation of the Funda
mental Standard.
However, in this case, we feel that the hearing, insofar
as it purported to determine that Mr. Ho did in fact
force his way through the doors leading to the Faculty
Club kitchen, was not a fair one. We believe defense
counsels' assertions that, at the trial, they did not think

that Mr. Ho could be convicted of any lesser included
offense. It is likely, therefore that they did not attempt
fully to contest the facts which might support his con
viction on such an offense. Defense counsel claim, and
we believe, that they felt that they had the case won on
the issue of the defendant's purpose, and hence, that
they did not need to try very hard to show that the
defendant was not guilty of the other element charged—
forcing his way through the doors. Certainly, on this
record, we cannot assume that the defendants did not
have several witnesses whom they could have called to
raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the hearing
officer as to whether the defendant applied force to the
doors or aided or encouraged anyone else to do so.
In this case, we cannot say that the defense attorneys,
without the benefit of hindsight, were obviously wrong
on the rules as to lesser included offense in our system.
This is a new judicial system. It contains, inevitably,
many unclear points-at least until the Panel itself clari
fies them (and even then they become clear, not because
we are correct, but because it is our position in the
system to say what the rules should be). We note also
that even though we rule today that he had no such
duty, the prosecutor could in fact have obviated the
whole problem by additionally charging the forcing into
the kitchen as a separate offense or by joining a charge
of disruption along with that of the Fundamental Stan
dard violation. Moreover he could have simply stated
clearly his theory of the case to the defense counsel at
any point before the end of the hearing. Similarly,
though the hearing officer seems to have believed that
the lesser included offense doctrine was applicable in
this case, he, too, made no effort to make his opinion
clear to the defense.
THE POSSIBILITY OF A REMAND
Our decision that Mr. Ho cannot be convicted on this
record because of the possible prejudice to him in the
litigation of the facts, by no means determines the
disposition of this case The CJP procedures provide that
we may remand a case back to the hearing examiner for
additional findings should they be necessary, and cer
tainly this implies a right to remand the matter to him if
any of the findings which he actually made were not
properly litigated.
Indeed, this will be the proper course in most cases
assuming there are any such cases where the particular
facts and theories justifying conviction have not been
made clear to the defense during the hearing. The only
reason it cannot be done in the criminal courts is that
once the jury has rendered its verdict, the jurors cannot
be reassembled for further findings—both because of the
practical difficulties involved and because, in the inter
im, they may have been exposed to improper influences.
Interestingly enough, where a judge sits without a jury, a
procedure more analogous to ours, an appellate court
can return a case for further findings, or indeed, for the
reception of further evidence on the findings already
made.
This is the preferable means of disposition before the
CJP in any case where it is alleged that, for one reason or
another, there was not fair notice and that there was
such surprise to the defendants that they could not
properly litigate a question which turned out to be
important. This procedure protects the legitimate right
of the defendant to a proper and accurate finding of
fact; and insofar as a defendant may have been misled
into producing evidence, other than his own testimony,
which is in fact true, we do not regard this as a suffi
ciently unfortunate consequence of our decision to de
part from what, in every other way, is clearly the better
rule.
This is not to say that, in all cases, a difference
between the charge and the proof will make a remand to
the hearing officer the proper course. First, if the proof
bears absolutely no relation to the charge, the demands
of procedural regularity would require an acquittal of
the charge as the only proper course-leaving the prose
cutor to start all over again with the charge supported by
his evidence. Second, a remand may be prevented by a
showing or permanent prejudice to the defendant caused
by events subsequent to the surprise to him. If, for
instance, witnesses available-to the defendant at the first
hearing have, before a remand, disappeared or left the
area, the first issue may not be susceptible of fair litiga
tion, and a remand might not be proper.
THE REASONS FOR ACQUITTAL HERE
In the case at issue here, there is a very different, and
we trust quite unusual, reason not to remand the case to
the hearing officer. In this case, Mr. Ho has already
undergone eight hearings before the hearing examiner
and one before us. In another case involving an alleged
classroom disruption, he has undergone eleven hearings
before the hearing examiner and, so far as we can tell,
may have to endure another before us. Moreover, he has
recently been charged, together with nine others, with
disrupting a meeting of the Academic Council, a matter
which if our past experience is any guide, will consume a
great many hearings before the hearing examiner.
In this situation, a remand of this case to the hearing
examiner might well consume several more hearings at a
time when Mr. Ho was more than merely busy with
other cases against him. This would border upon harass
ment and our reluctance to inflict this upon Mr. Ho is
fortified by the fact that the remand would have been
necessitated without fault on his or his counsels' part,
and in a situation where the possibility of a remand to
the hearing examiner was, most likely, one which they
had never contemplated. Now that our procedures are
clearer in this matter, it is most unlikely that this parti
cular equity, presently working in Mr. Ho's behalf, will
occur again.
In any event, it is working in this particular case and
this is enough to make the difference. Accordingly, we
recommend that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case
be dropped.

For the reasons we state below at some length, we
feel that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case should be
dismissed. Under the circumstances of this case, Mr. Ho
cannot be convicted of the violation of the Fundamental
Standard found in the hearing examiner's report, and a
remand to the hearing examiner for the cure of the
defect in the hearing before him is, under the facts of
this case, not a fair alternative.
The defendant, Mr. Ho, was charged before the Cam
pus Judicial Panel by the University administration with
a violation of the Fundamental Standard in two particu
lars: that he committed an assault and that he "together
with others, forced his way into the kitchen of the
Stanford Faculty Club for the purpose of stealing food
from that kitchen." The hearing examiner acquitted Mr.
Ho of the first charge, the assault. As to the second
charge, the hearing examiner found, in essence, that
though Mr. Ho had no purpose to steal food from the
kitchen, he had nonetheless helped force his way into
the kitchen. The specific findings of the hearing exam
iner (with their contexts in brackets) are:
3. 1 find that Mr. Ho was informed by responsible
officials of the Faculty Club, whose position of re
sponsibility was known to him, that he was not
allowed in the rear of the Club. [Past the doors which
led to the kitchen]
4. I find that Mr. Ho by words and gestures, encour
aged the persons in the dining area to assist him in
gaining access to the hallway [on the other side of
the doors]
5. I find that the double doors leading to the hallway
were opened in response to physical force exerted by
Mr. Ho and others, [and against the resistance of two
faculty club employees]
In short, Mr. Ho was found to have forced his way into
an area where he had been told by legitimate authority
that he had no business.
No justification for Mr. Ho's acts appearing, we have
no doubt that the hearing examiner's report makes out
what, at least in our opinion, is a clear violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The issue before us, however, is
not whether Mr. Ho is guilty, but whether he has been
properly and fairly found guilty under our procedures.
LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES IN GENERAL
The threshold issue in the determination of this case
is whether the Fundamental Standard violation proven
against Mr. Ho is one of which he could be convicted,
despite the failure of the prosecution to prove its allega
tion that Mr. Ho had committed his act with a purpose
to steal food. If it was not, we need proceed no further.
The prosecution alleges that defendant was properly
convicted under a "lesser included offense" theory. It is,
indeed, a general principle of law in criminal prosecu
tions that, if the prosecution charges that the defendant
did act A with an intent to accomplish Band the
prosecution proves that the defendant did act A but
cannot meet its burden of proof on the defendant's
intent to do B, the defendant may nonetheless be con
victed of doing act A-if that act is also, in itself, an
offense. Thus, if a defendant is charged with assault with
intent to kill and the prosecution cannot sustain its
burden as to the intent, the defendant may nonetheless
be convicted of the lesser included offense of assault
assuming, of course, that assault is an offense within the
legal system in question.
Indeed, the principle covers more than simply cases
where the prosecution is unable to prove an intent it has
charged. A defendant may be convicted of assault where
the prosecution has charged him with assault with a
deadly weapon. And if a defendant is charged with
drunken driving but the prosecution cannot prove that
he was actually driving, (either because he might have
been merely a passenger or because the car might have
been motionless) the defendant may, nonetheless, be
convicted of being drunk in an automobile-assuming, of
course, that under the law of that jurisdiction, (as is the
case in California), being drunk in an automobile is also
a punishable offense.
In short, in the criminal system at large, where a
defendant is charged with all the elements of an offense,
he is on notice that he must defend against any combina
tion of these factual elements which also is punishable.
One of the issues before us in this case is whether this is
the proper rule before the CJP, as well.
THE BURGLARY ANALOGY
Defense counsel make two basic arguments on this
issue. First, they argue that the original charge at issue
here, entering a room with intent to commit an offense
therein, is very much like the charges lodged in the local
courts for violation of the California burglary statute.
Since, under California law, burglary has no lesser
included offenses (except, of course, attempted bur
glary), defendant argues that the same rule should pre
vail before the CJP. In other words, since we are reason
ing by analogy here, defendant claims that the analogy
to the specific California burglary rule should prevail
before the CJP over the more general analogy to the
failure to prove an intent charged.
We do not find this argument persuasive. The reason
why the California burglary statute has no lesser
included offense is simply that the act of entering a
room or building is not illegal at all, unless it occurs
together with the forbidden intent. Hence, unless the
prosecution can show that intent, the defendant is guilty
of no wrongful conduct whatsoever. Interestingly, in
most states, where burglary requires a breaking and
entering as well as an intent, the crime does have a lesser
included offense, "breaking and entering." Here, where
entirely apart from any purpose to steal, the act of the
defendant, under the circumstances of this case, would
seem to us to be a clear violation of the Fundamental
Standard, the analogy to the California burglary statute
appears inapposite.

LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES
IN FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD CASES
The second contention of the defendant on this issue
is more troublesome The defendant would have us hold,
on much broader grounds, that the lesser included offen
se doctrine can never apply to Fundamental Standard
violations. Defense counsel contend that where the pros
ecution charges facts amounting to a Fundamental Stan
dard violation, but does not prove all of those facts, the
prosecution cannot prevail, even though the lesser facts
it has proven also amount to Fundamental Standard
violation.
THE PROBLEM OF SURPRISE
Defendant's argument is premised in part on the lact
that the Fundamental Standard is so broad that a defen
dant attempting to meet a charge of its violation is
vulnerable to surprise at the hearing through the intro
duction of facts and issues he is unprepared to meet.
Defendant recognizes, as he must, that no frontal attack
upon the Fundamental Standard is possible. After all, it

uance is denied, the claim of prejudice due to lack of
notice is raisable before this Panel, as well.
Defendant's complaint as to the Fundamental Stan
dard, however, is broader than merely that its vagueness
offers insufficient protection against surprise at trial.
The defense's complaint is that uncertainty in exactly
what constitutes a Fundamental Standard violation
places the defense in jeopardy in other ways.
First of all, we should distinguish this argument from
another quite different one which sounds somewhat
similar. The defendant is not here contending that he
should be acquitted because the Fundamental Standard
is so vague that he did not know that what he was doing
in the Faculty Club was in violation of University law.
To be sure, at its outer edges the Fundamental Standard

clear violation cannot raise the fact that others might
violate the Standard unwittingly. Indeed, the issue is not
whether the defendant knew his actions were in viola

should have known.
THE RIGHT NOT TO HELP THE PROSECUTION
However, it is in part because of the fact that a
student can be guilty of a Fundamental Standard viola
tion even though he believes he is correct and the com
munity judgment wrong, that we must pay particular
attention to defense counsel's argument on this issue.
The claim in essence is that the minimal limits of the

unwittingly help the prosecution prove its case.
For the most part, however, we do not apprehend
that this difficulty faced by a defendant is a sympathetic
one considering the structure of our proceedings and the
protections the defendant does have. The basic purpose
of the hearing before the examiner is to find out the
facts—who did what, when and where, with what state
of mind. Certainly, the hearing examiner must perform
his function in a way fair to the defendant and giving
full effect to any specific rights provided by our rules.
The hearing before the hearing examiner, however, is not
a game. The defendant certainly has the right to put the
prosecution to its proof, but if he helps prow the facts
which actually exist, we cannot regard this as a disadvan
tage of the CJP procedures.
In one situation, however, the defendant's fear of
helping the prosecution prove its case is entitled to
recognition. Our rules give a defendant a specific right
not to testify and we should give this right a broad
scope. Part of such a scope is to make sure that a
defendant, in exercising his right, fully appreciates the
consequences to himself. Accordingly, should a defen
dant admit at the hearing facts which he may not appre
ciate constitute a violation, he should be warned that
this is the case and be given an opportunity to withdraw
his statement before his conviction can be founded on
his testimony. If he does withdraw his admission and
does not within the scope of cross examination repeat it,
his statement may not be considered against him by the
hearing officer or this Panel.
This rule, however, is not determinative of this case.
The (act is that, rather than admitting the lesser included
offense alleged by the prosecutor here as a basis for
conviction, Mr. Ho denied that he had exerted any force
on the door.
THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE ALL FACTS
Another facet ot defendant's argument is also related
to the possibility of failure to appreciate facts showing a
Fundamental Standard violation. Defendant argues that

because a defendant and his counsel might not recognize
the significance of facts which amounted to a Funda
mental Standard violation, these facts might not be fully
and tairly litigatej. As a result, the hearing examiner
might find untrae, misleading or incomplete facts. We
recognize this problem, but feel the solution is not to
prevent the finding of lesser included offenses in Funda
mental Standard cases. Rather, it is to give the defendant
full opportunity and notice to litigate any fact which
may be important to the disposition of his case-a mat
ter to which we will return shortly.
THE PLEADING REQUIREMENTS OF THE CJP
Finally, our decision that lesser included offenses can
be shown in Fundamental Standard cases is buttressed
by another consideration. The major operative effect of
accepting defendant's position would be to force the
prosecutor, in drafting his charges in the future, to join
all of the possible factual elements he thought he might
be able to prove, separately and in combination as sepa
rate charges. This would be complicated enough in sim
ple Fundamental Standard cases. It would be even more
so where Disruption charges and Fundamental Standard
violations are joined-as they might have been in this
case. Disruptions, most of which—when they are not
within a justification defense—are probably also Funda
mental Standard violations, can overlap in complex ways
with Fundamental Standard violations.
There is not sufficient reason to place such a burden
of drafting upon the prosecutor, especially since in those
jurisdictions which have attempted to guarantee com
plete notice through pleading, the pleadings have be
come so prolix and confusing that they became an
obstruction to rational fact finding. Moreover, though
the vagueness of the Fundamental Standard may work
against the defense, the lack of weaponry given to the
prosecutor in our system works against him even more,
in attempting to learn with a high degree of precision the
facts of the events leading to his charge. Unlike the
prosecutor in the civil courts, the University administra
tion has no equivalent of a grand jury subpoena (indeed
it cannot even subpoena witnesses at trial). Moreover,
the prosecutor in the university system has no right to a
preliminary hearing which can permit the prosecutor in
the civil society to determine, to a much greater extent,
which facts he can and which he cannot prove at trial,
and hence to shape his charges better.
Indeed the issue of whether to allow lesser included
offenses in Fundamental Standard violations is only one
facet of a much larger problem—the purpose of the
charge in the CJP procedures. Although there are obvi
ously many analogies to the criminal law in our proce
dures—most obviously the requirement of a reasonable
doubt standard—these are not criminal cases. This is
made clear by the relatively limited nature of our sanc
tions, which-though we regard them as quite severe—are
hardly equal to those of the criminal courts; the fact
that consequences and procedures similar to ours are
used in obviously civil cases such as those involving
industrial relations and faculty discipline; and the prin
ciple that the major purpose of society is, in a sense to
enforce its law, while the major purposes for which the
University exists, and which control its allocations of
resources, are education and the advancement of know
ledge.
The purpose of the charge in our system is analogous
to that under the more modern civil rules. It is not what
is called "fact" or "issue" pleading, but is "notice"
pleading where the purpose of the charge is to specify
the general area for litigation while other devices are
relied upon to permit full and fair litigation of the facts.
In a civil case, it is quite common for one side or the
other to move at the end of trial to amend its pleadings
to conform to the evidence produced. This motion is
generally granted where no prejudice to the other party
is shown. Indeed, even in criminal cases prosecuted by
information (in which, as in the University, the prosecu
tor rather than a grand jury brings the charges) the
prosecutor may amend his pleading during trial to cover
any offense shown by the evidence.
It should be made clear that our view of the CJP
pleading requirements is as likely to benefit the defen
dant as the prosecutor. We must remember that the CJP
system recognizes within itself the concept of double
jeopardy and a defendant, once acquitted of a charge
before the CJP, cannot be retried on the same charge in
our system regardless of what new evidence of his guilt
the prosecutor can discover. Since that is the case, a
narrow construction of the charge will permit the prose
cutor to retry the defendant on a closely related but
different charge, while the view that the charge before us
is broader than that in the criminal law will more nar
rowly restrict the prosecutor in subsequent charges.
In the criminal system, the more narrowly defined
relationship between the words of the charge and the
crimes of which the defendant may be convicted can
have severe consequences to the defendant. In a criminal
case, where the defendant has burned down a building,
killing several of its occupants, the prosecutor can, in
almost all jurisdictions, convict him of one murder after
another based on the same fact situation, until the jury
returns the death sentence that the prosecutor desires.
Our rule prevents the vices of a narrow construction of
charges, and, if a consequence of preventing such abuse
is a broadening of the relation between the charge and
the evidence, we think that both in terms of fairness to
the defendant and accuracy in the fact-finding process, it
is the better choice.
THE REASON FOR REVERSAL
Our disagreement with the defendants on the allow
ance of lesser included offenses in Fundamental Stan
dard cases by no means settles this case, however. All we
have thus far held is that, if the hearing is a fair one, a
defendant charged with forcing one's way into a room
with a purpose to steal can be convicted of simply
forcing his way into the room-where the circumstances
are such that that act is also a violation of the Funda
mental Standard.
However, in this case, we feel that the hearing, insofar
as it purported to determine that Mr. Ho did in fact
force his way through the doors leading to the Faculty
Club kitchen, was not a fair one. We believe defense
counsels' assertions that, at the trial, they did not think

that Mr. Ho could be convicted of any lesser included
offense. It is likely, therefore that they did not attempt
fully to contest the facts which might support his con
viction on such an offense. Defense counsel claim, and
we believe, that they felt that they had the case won on
the issue of the defendant's purpose, and hence, that
they did not need to try very hard to show that the
defendant was not guilty of the other element charged—
forcing his way through the doors. Certainly, on this
record, we cannot assume that the defendants did not
have several witnesses whom they could have called to
raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the hearing
officer as to whether the defendant applied force to the
doors or aided or encouraged anyone else to do so.
In this case, we cannot say that the defense attorneys,
without the benefit of hindsight, were obviously wrong
on the rules as to lesser included offense in our system.
This is a new judicial system. It contains, inevitably,
many unclear points-at least until the Panel itself clari
fies them (and even then they become clear, not because
we are correct, but because it is our position in the
system to say what the rules should be). We note also
that even though we rule today that he had no such
duty, the prosecutor could in fact have obviated the
whole problem by additionally charging the forcing into
the kitchen as a separate offense or by joining a charge
of disruption along with that of the Fundamental Stan
dard violation. Moreover he could have simply stated
clearly his theory of the case to the defense counsel at
any point before the end of the hearing. Similarly,
though the hearing officer seems to have believed that
the lesser included offense doctrine was applicable in
this case, he, too, made no effort to make his opinion
clear to the defense.
THE POSSIBILITY OF A REMAND
Our decision that Mr. Ho cannot be convicted on this
record because of the possible prejudice to him in the
litigation of the facts, by no means determines the
disposition of this case The CJP procedures provide that
we may remand a case back to the hearing examiner for
additional findings should they be necessary, and cer
tainly this implies a right to remand the matter to him if
any of the findings which he actually made were not
properly litigated.
Indeed, this will be the proper course in most cases
assuming there are any such cases where the particular
facts and theories justifying conviction have not been
made clear to the defense during the hearing. The only
reason it cannot be done in the criminal courts is that
once the jury has rendered its verdict, the jurors cannot
be reassembled for further findings—both because of the
practical difficulties involved and because, in the inter
im, they may have been exposed to improper influences.
Interestingly enough, where a judge sits without a jury, a
procedure more analogous to ours, an appellate court
can return a case for further findings, or indeed, for the
reception of further evidence on the findings already
made.
This is the preferable means of disposition before the
CJP in any case where it is alleged that, for one reason or
another, there was not fair notice and that there was
such surprise to the defendants that they could not
properly litigate a question which turned out to be
important. This procedure protects the legitimate right
of the defendant to a proper and accurate finding of
fact; and insofar as a defendant may have been misled
into producing evidence, other than his own testimony,
which is in fact true, we do not regard this as a suffi
ciently unfortunate consequence of our decision to de
part from what, in every other way, is clearly the better
rule.
This is not to say that, in all cases, a difference
between the charge and the proof will make a remand to
the hearing officer the proper course. First, if the proof
bears absolutely no relation to the charge, the demands
of procedural regularity would require an acquittal of
the charge as the only proper course-leaving the prose
cutor to start all over again with the charge supported by
his evidence. Second, a remand may be prevented by a
showing or permanent prejudice to the defendant caused
by events subsequent to the surprise to him. If, for
instance, witnesses available-to the defendant at the first
hearing have, before a remand, disappeared or left the
area, the first issue may not be susceptible of fair litiga
tion, and a remand might not be proper.
THE REASONS FOR ACQUITTAL HERE
In the case at issue here, there is a very different, and
we trust quite unusual, reason not to remand the case to
the hearing officer. In this case, Mr. Ho has already
undergone eight hearings before the hearing examiner
and one before us. In another case involving an alleged
classroom disruption, he has undergone eleven hearings
before the hearing examiner and, so far as we can tell,
may have to endure another before us. Moreover, he has
recently been charged, together with nine others, with
disrupting a meeting of the Academic Council, a matter
which if our past experience is any guide, will consume a
great many hearings before the hearing examiner.
In this situation, a remand of this case to the hearing
examiner might well consume several more hearings at a
time when Mr. Ho was more than merely busy with
other cases against him. This would border upon harass
ment and our reluctance to inflict this upon Mr. Ho is
fortified by the fact that the remand would have been
necessitated without fault on his or his counsels' part,
and in a situation where the possibility of a remand to
the hearing examiner was, most likely, one which they
had never contemplated. Now that our procedures are
clearer in this matter, it is most unlikely that this parti
cular equity, presently working in Mr. Ho's behalf, will
occur again.
In any event, it is working in this particular case and
this is enough to make the difference. Accordingly, we
recommend that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case
be dropped.

Robert L. White
For the reasons we state below at some length, we
feel that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case should be
dismissed. Under the circumstances of this case, Mr. Ho
cannot be convicted of the violation of the Fundamental
Standard found in the hearing examiner's report, and a
remand to the hearing examiner for the cure of the
defect in the hearing before him is, under the facts of
this case, not a fair alternative.
The defendant, Mr. Ho, was charged before the Cam
pus Judicial Panel by the University administration with
a violation of the Fundamental Standard in two particu
lars: that he committed an assault and that he "together
with others, forced his way into the kitchen of the
Stanford Faculty Club for the purpose of stealing food
from that kitchen." The hearing examiner acquitted Mr.
Ho of the first charge, the assault. As to the second
charge, the hearing examiner found, in essence, that
though Mr. Ho had no purpose to steal food from the
kitchen, he had nonetheless helped force his way into
the kitchen. The specific findings of the hearing exam
iner (with their contexts in brackets) are:
3. 1 find that Mr. Ho was informed by responsible
officials of the Faculty Club, whose position of re
sponsibility was known to him, that he was not
allowed in the rear of the Club. [Past the doors which
led to the kitchen]
4. I find that Mr. Ho by words and gestures, encour
aged the persons in the dining area to assist him in
gaining access to the hallway [on the other side of
the doors]
5. I find that the double doors leading to the hallway
were opened in response to physical force exerted by
Mr. Ho and others, [and against the resistance of two
faculty club employees]
In short, Mr. Ho was found to have forced his way into
an area where he had been told by legitimate authority
that he had no business.
No justification for Mr. Ho's acts appearing, we have
no doubt that the hearing examiner's report makes out
what, at least in our opinion, is a clear violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The issue before us, however, is
not whether Mr. Ho is guilty, but whether he has been
properly and fairly found guilty under our procedures.
LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES IN GENERAL
The threshold issue in the determination of this case
is whether the Fundamental Standard violation proven
against Mr. Ho is one of which he could be convicted,
despite the failure of the prosecution to prove its allega
tion that Mr. Ho had committed his act with a purpose
to steal food. If it was not, we need proceed no further.
The prosecution alleges that defendant was properly
convicted under a "lesser included offense" theory. It is,
indeed, a general principle of law in criminal prosecu
tions that, if the prosecution charges that the defendant
did act A with an intent to accomplish Band the
prosecution proves that the defendant did act A but
cannot meet its burden of proof on the defendant's
intent to do B, the defendant may nonetheless be con
victed of doing act A-if that act is also, in itself, an
offense. Thus, if a defendant is charged with assault with
intent to kill and the prosecution cannot sustain its
burden as to the intent, the defendant may nonetheless
be convicted of the lesser included offense of assault
assuming, of course, that assault is an offense within the
legal system in question.
Indeed, the principle covers more than simply cases
where the prosecution is unable to prove an intent it has
charged. A defendant may be convicted of assault where
the prosecution has charged him with assault with a
deadly weapon. And if a defendant is charged with
drunken driving but the prosecution cannot prove that
he was actually driving, (either because he might have
been merely a passenger or because the car might have
been motionless) the defendant may, nonetheless, be
convicted of being drunk in an automobile-assuming, of
course, that under the law of that jurisdiction, (as is the
case in California), being drunk in an automobile is also
a punishable offense.
In short, in the criminal system at large, where a
defendant is charged with all the elements of an offense,
he is on notice that he must defend against any combina
tion of these factual elements which also is punishable.
One of the issues before us in this case is whether this is
the proper rule before the CJP, as well.
THE BURGLARY ANALOGY
Defense counsel make two basic arguments on this
issue. First, they argue that the original charge at issue
here, entering a room with intent to commit an offense
therein, is very much like the charges lodged in the local
courts for violation of the California burglary statute.
Since, under California law, burglary has no lesser
included offenses (except, of course, attempted bur
glary), defendant argues that the same rule should pre
vail before the CJP. In other words, since we are reason
ing by analogy here, defendant claims that the analogy
to the specific California burglary rule should prevail
before the CJP over the more general analogy to the
failure to prove an intent charged.
We do not find this argument persuasive. The reason
why the California burglary statute has no lesser
included offense is simply that the act of entering a
room or building is not illegal at all, unless it occurs
together with the forbidden intent. Hence, unless the
prosecution can show that intent, the defendant is guilty
of no wrongful conduct whatsoever. Interestingly, in
most states, where burglary requires a breaking and
entering as well as an intent, the crime does have a lesser
included offense, "breaking and entering." Here, where
entirely apart from any purpose to steal, the act of the
defendant, under the circumstances of this case, would
seem to us to be a clear violation of the Fundamental
Standard, the analogy to the California burglary statute
appears inapposite.

LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES
IN FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD CASES
The second contention of the defendant on this issue
is more troublesome The defendant would have us hold,
on much broader grounds, that the lesser included offen
se doctrine can never apply to Fundamental Standard
violations. Defense counsel contend that where the pros
ecution charges facts amounting to a Fundamental Stan
dard violation, but does not prove all of those facts, the
prosecution cannot prevail, even though the lesser facts
it has proven also amount to Fundamental Standard
violation.
THE PROBLEM OF SURPRISE
Defendant's argument is premised in part on the lact
that the Fundamental Standard is so broad that a defen
dant attempting to meet a charge of its violation is
vulnerable to surprise at the hearing through the intro
duction of facts and issues he is unprepared to meet.
Defendant recognizes, as he must, that no frontal attack
upon the Fundamental Standard is possible. After all, it
has been a part of University law since the time of David
Starr Jordan. The defense earnestly contends, however,
that the allowance of a lesser included offense within a
Fundamental Standard charge compounds unduly what
is a built-in problem in the administration of such a
broad rule.
This facet of the defense argument is considerably
weakened by the alternative remedy available to defen
dants under the CJP procedures. Indeed, the CJP proce
dures can be far better adapted to protecting a defen
dant against surprise than can those of the outside soci
ety. In the criminal trial, a defendant who is surprised by
the prosecution's introduction of an issue cannot have
the jury kept together for an appreciable time while he
attempts to find new evidence to meet the prosecution's
evidence. Under the CJP system, the remedy to avoid
any surprise is simply the right of the party to ask the
hearing officer for sufficient time to produce his evi
dence. We cannot conceive of any reasonable continu
ance being denied by a hearing officer in a situation
where a claim of surprise or lack of notice is made in
good faith. And, if such a request for reasonable contin
uance is denied, the claim of prejudice due to lack of
notice is raisable before this Panel, as well.
Defendant's complaint as to the Fundamental Stan
dard, however, is broader than merely that its vagueness
offers insufficient protection against surprise at trial.
The defense's complaint is that uncertainty in exactly
what constitutes a Fundamental Standard violation
places the defense in jeopardy in other ways.
First of all, we should distinguish this argument from
another quite different one which sounds somewhat
similar. The defendant is not here contending that he
should be acquitted because the Fundamental Standard
is so vague that he did not know that what he was doing
in the Faculty Club was in violation of University law.
To be sure, at its outer edges the Fundamental Standard
is extremely murky, but a defendant whose acts are a
clear violation cannot raise the fact that others might
violate the Standard unwittingly. Indeed, the issue is not
whether the defendant knew his actions were in viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard, but whether he
should have known.
THE RIGHT NOT TO HELP THE PROSECUTION
However, it is in part because of the fact that a
student can be guilty of a Fundamental Standard viola
tion even though he believes he is correct and the com
munity judgment wrong, that we must pay particular
attention to defense counsel's argument on this issue.
The claim in essence is that the minimal limits of the
Fundamental Standard are so indefinite that a defendant
may be unable to meet a charge of Fundamental Stand
ard violation without, perhaps, helping the prosecution
prove some lesser included offense.
It is not a complete answer to this to say that in order
for discipline to be imposed, the Fundamental Standard
violation must be clear to us. It is quite conceivable that
a defense attorney, with values similar to those of his
client, might not appreciate that certain actions did
constitute a Fundamental Standard violation clear to the
rest of the community. In such a case, he might indeed
unwittingly help the prosecution prove its case.
For the most part, however, we do not apprehend
that this difficulty faced by a defendant is a sympathetic
one considering the structure of our proceedings and the
protections the defendant does have. The basic purpose
of the hearing before the examiner is to find out the
facts—who did what, when and where, with what state
of mind. Certainly, the hearing examiner must perform
his function in a way fair to the defendant and giving
full effect to any specific rights provided by our rules.
The hearing before the hearing examiner, however, is not
a game. The defendant certainly has the right to put the
prosecution to its proof, but if he helps prow the facts
which actually exist, we cannot regard this as a disadvan
tage of the CJP procedures.
In one situation, however, the defendant's fear of
helping the prosecution prove its case is entitled to
recognition. Our rules give a defendant a specific right
not to testify and we should give this right a broad
scope. Part of such a scope is to make sure that a
defendant, in exercising his right, fully appreciates the
consequences to himself. Accordingly, should a defen
dant admit at the hearing facts which he may not appre
ciate constitute a violation, he should be warned that
this is the case and be given an opportunity to withdraw
his statement before his conviction can be founded on
his testimony. If he does withdraw his admission and
does not within the scope of cross examination repeat it,
his statement may not be considered against him by the
hearing officer or this Panel.
This rule, however, is not determinative of this case.
The (act is that, rather than admitting the lesser included
offense alleged by the prosecutor here as a basis for
conviction, Mr. Ho denied that he had exerted any force
on the door.
THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE ALL FACTS
Another facet ot defendant's argument is also related
to the possibility of failure to appreciate facts showing a
Fundamental Standard violation. Defendant argues that

because a defendant and his counsel might not recognize
the significance of facts which amounted to a Funda
mental Standard violation, these facts might not be fully
and tairly litigatej. As a result, the hearing examiner
might find untrae, misleading or incomplete facts. We
recognize this problem, but feel the solution is not to
prevent the finding of lesser included offenses in Funda
mental Standard cases. Rather, it is to give the defendant
full opportunity and notice to litigate any fact which
may be important to the disposition of his case-a mat
ter to which we will return shortly.
THE PLEADING REQUIREMENTS OF THE CJP
Finally, our decision that lesser included offenses can
be shown in Fundamental Standard cases is buttressed
by another consideration. The major operative effect of
accepting defendant's position would be to force the
prosecutor, in drafting his charges in the future, to join
all of the possible factual elements he thought he might
be able to prove, separately and in combination as sepa
rate charges. This would be complicated enough in sim
ple Fundamental Standard cases. It would be even more
so where Disruption charges and Fundamental Standard
violations are joined-as they might have been in this
case. Disruptions, most of which—when they are not
within a justification defense—are probably also Funda
mental Standard violations, can overlap in complex ways
with Fundamental Standard violations.
There is not sufficient reason to place such a burden
of drafting upon the prosecutor, especially since in those
jurisdictions which have attempted to guarantee com
plete notice through pleading, the pleadings have be
come so prolix and confusing that they became an
obstruction to rational fact finding. Moreover, though
the vagueness of the Fundamental Standard may work
against the defense, the lack of weaponry given to the
prosecutor in our system works against him even more,
in attempting to learn with a high degree of precision the
facts of the events leading to his charge. Unlike the
prosecutor in the civil courts, the University administra
tion has no equivalent of a grand jury subpoena (indeed
it cannot even subpoena witnesses at trial). Moreover,
the prosecutor in the university system has no right to a
preliminary hearing which can permit the prosecutor in
the civil society to determine, to a much greater extent,
which facts he can and which he cannot prove at trial,
and hence to shape his charges better.
Indeed the issue of whether to allow lesser included
offenses in Fundamental Standard violations is only one
facet of a much larger problem—the purpose of the
charge in the CJP procedures. Although there are obvi
ously many analogies to the criminal law in our proce
dures—most obviously the requirement of a reasonable
doubt standard—these are not criminal cases. This is
made clear by the relatively limited nature of our sanc
tions, which-though we regard them as quite severe—are
hardly equal to those of the criminal courts; the fact
that consequences and procedures similar to ours are
used in obviously civil cases such as those involving
industrial relations and faculty discipline; and the prin
ciple that the major purpose of society is, in a sense to
enforce its law, while the major purposes for which the
University exists, and which control its allocations of
resources, are education and the advancement of know
ledge.
The purpose of the charge in our system is analogous
to that under the more modern civil rules. It is not what
is called "fact" or "issue" pleading, but is "notice"
pleading where the purpose of the charge is to specify
the general area for litigation while other devices are
relied upon to permit full and fair litigation of the facts.
In a civil case, it is quite common for one side or the
other to move at the end of trial to amend its pleadings
to conform to the evidence produced. This motion is
generally granted where no prejudice to the other party
is shown. Indeed, even in criminal cases prosecuted by
information (in which, as in the University, the prosecu
tor rather than a grand jury brings the charges) the
prosecutor may amend his pleading during trial to cover
any offense shown by the evidence.
It should be made clear that our view of the CJP
pleading requirements is as likely to benefit the defen
dant as the prosecutor. We must remember that the CJP
system recognizes within itself the concept of double
jeopardy and a defendant, once acquitted of a charge
before the CJP, cannot be retried on the same charge in
our system regardless of what new evidence of his guilt
the prosecutor can discover. Since that is the case, a
narrow construction of the charge will permit the prose
cutor to retry the defendant on a closely related but
different charge, while the view that the charge before us
is broader than that in the criminal law will more nar
rowly restrict the prosecutor in subsequent charges.
In the criminal system, the more narrowly defined
relationship between the words of the charge and the
crimes of which the defendant may be convicted can
have severe consequences to the defendant. In a criminal
case, where the defendant has burned down a building,
killing several of its occupants, the prosecutor can, in
almost all jurisdictions, convict him of one murder after
another based on the same fact situation, until the jury
returns the death sentence that the prosecutor desires.
Our rule prevents the vices of a narrow construction of
charges, and, if a consequence of preventing such abuse
is a broadening of the relation between the charge and
the evidence, we think that both in terms of fairness to
the defendant and accuracy in the fact-finding process, it
is the better choice.
THE REASON FOR REVERSAL
Our disagreement with the defendants on the allow
ance of lesser included offenses in Fundamental Stan
dard cases by no means settles this case, however. All we
have thus far held is that, if the hearing is a fair one, a
defendant charged with forcing one's way into a room
with a purpose to steal can be convicted of simply
forcing his way into the room-where the circumstances
are such that that act is also a violation of the Funda
mental Standard.
However, in this case, we feel that the hearing, insofar
as it purported to determine that Mr. Ho did in fact
force his way through the doors leading to the Faculty
Club kitchen, was not a fair one. We believe defense
counsels' assertions that, at the trial, they did not think

that Mr. Ho could be convicted of any lesser included
offense. It is likely, therefore that they did not attempt
fully to contest the facts which might support his con
viction on such an offense. Defense counsel claim, and
we believe, that they felt that they had the case won on
the issue of the defendant's purpose, and hence, that
they did not need to try very hard to show that the
defendant was not guilty of the other element charged—
forcing his way through the doors. Certainly, on this
record, we cannot assume that the defendants did not
have several witnesses whom they could have called to
raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the hearing
officer as to whether the defendant applied force to the
doors or aided or encouraged anyone else to do so.
In this case, we cannot say that the defense attorneys,
without the benefit of hindsight, were obviously wrong
on the rules as to lesser included offense in our system.
This is a new judicial system. It contains, inevitably,
many unclear points-at least until the Panel itself clari
fies them (and even then they become clear, not because
we are correct, but because it is our position in the
system to say what the rules should be). We note also
that even though we rule today that he had no such
duty, the prosecutor could in fact have obviated the
whole problem by additionally charging the forcing into
the kitchen as a separate offense or by joining a charge
of disruption along with that of the Fundamental Stan
dard violation. Moreover he could have simply stated
clearly his theory of the case to the defense counsel at
any point before the end of the hearing. Similarly,
though the hearing officer seems to have believed that
the lesser included offense doctrine was applicable in
this case, he, too, made no effort to make his opinion
clear to the defense.
THE POSSIBILITY OF A REMAND
Our decision that Mr. Ho cannot be convicted on this
record because of the possible prejudice to him in the
litigation of the facts, by no means determines the
disposition of this case The CJP procedures provide that
we may remand a case back to the hearing examiner for
additional findings should they be necessary, and cer
tainly this implies a right to remand the matter to him if
any of the findings which he actually made were not
properly litigated.
Indeed, this will be the proper course in most cases
assuming there are any such cases where the particular
facts and theories justifying conviction have not been
made clear to the defense during the hearing. The only
reason it cannot be done in the criminal courts is that
once the jury has rendered its verdict, the jurors cannot
be reassembled for further findings—both because of the
practical difficulties involved and because, in the inter
im, they may have been exposed to improper influences.
Interestingly enough, where a judge sits without a jury, a
procedure more analogous to ours, an appellate court
can return a case for further findings, or indeed, for the
reception of further evidence on the findings already
made.
This is the preferable means of disposition before the
CJP in any case where it is alleged that, for one reason or
another, there was not fair notice and that there was
such surprise to the defendants that they could not
properly litigate a question which turned out to be
important. This procedure protects the legitimate right
of the defendant to a proper and accurate finding of
fact; and insofar as a defendant may have been misled
into producing evidence, other than his own testimony,
which is in fact true, we do not regard this as a suffi
ciently unfortunate consequence of our decision to de
part from what, in every other way, is clearly the better
rule.
This is not to say that, in all cases, a difference
between the charge and the proof will make a remand to
the hearing officer the proper course. First, if the proof
bears absolutely no relation to the charge, the demands
of procedural regularity would require an acquittal of
the charge as the only proper course-leaving the prose
cutor to start all over again with the charge supported by
his evidence. Second, a remand may be prevented by a
showing or permanent prejudice to the defendant caused
by events subsequent to the surprise to him. If, for
instance, witnesses available-to the defendant at the first
hearing have, before a remand, disappeared or left the
area, the first issue may not be susceptible of fair litiga
tion, and a remand might not be proper.
THE REASONS FOR ACQUITTAL HERE
In the case at issue here, there is a very different, and
we trust quite unusual, reason not to remand the case to
the hearing officer. In this case, Mr. Ho has already
undergone eight hearings before the hearing examiner
and one before us. In another case involving an alleged
classroom disruption, he has undergone eleven hearings
before the hearing examiner and, so far as we can tell,
may have to endure another before us. Moreover, he has
recently been charged, together with nine others, with
disrupting a meeting of the Academic Council, a matter
which if our past experience is any guide, will consume a
great many hearings before the hearing examiner.
In this situation, a remand of this case to the hearing
examiner might well consume several more hearings at a
time when Mr. Ho was more than merely busy with
other cases against him. This would border upon harass
ment and our reluctance to inflict this upon Mr. Ho is
fortified by the fact that the remand would have been
necessitated without fault on his or his counsels' part,
and in a situation where the possibility of a remand to
the hearing examiner was, most likely, one which they
had never contemplated. Now that our procedures are
clearer in this matter, it is most unlikely that this parti
cular equity, presently working in Mr. Ho's behalf, will
occur again.
In any event, it is working in this particular case and
this is enough to make the difference. Accordingly, we
recommend that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case
be dropped.

For the reasons we state below at some length, we
feel that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case should be
dismissed. Under the circumstances of this case, Mr. Ho
cannot be convicted of the violation of the Fundamental
Standard found in the hearing examiner's report, and a
remand to the hearing examiner for the cure of the
defect in the hearing before him is, under the facts of
this case, not a fair alternative.
The defendant, Mr. Ho, was charged before the Cam
pus Judicial Panel by the University administration with
a violation of the Fundamental Standard in two particu
lars: that he committed an assault and that he "together
with others, forced his way into the kitchen of the
Stanford Faculty Club for the purpose of stealing food
from that kitchen." The hearing examiner acquitted Mr.
Ho of the first charge, the assault. As to the second
charge, the hearing examiner found, in essence, that
though Mr. Ho had no purpose to steal food from the
kitchen, he had nonetheless helped force his way into
the kitchen. The specific findings of the hearing exam
iner (with their contexts in brackets) are:
3. 1 find that Mr. Ho was informed by responsible
officials of the Faculty Club, whose position of re
sponsibility was known to him, that he was not
allowed in the rear of the Club. [Past the doors which
led to the kitchen]
4. I find that Mr. Ho by words and gestures, encour
aged the persons in the dining area to assist him in
gaining access to the hallway [on the other side of
the doors]
5. I find that the double doors leading to the hallway
were opened in response to physical force exerted by
Mr. Ho and others, [and against the resistance of two
faculty club employees]
In short, Mr. Ho was found to have forced his way into
an area where he had been told by legitimate authority
that he had no business.
No justification for Mr. Ho's acts appearing, we have
no doubt that the hearing examiner's report makes out
what, at least in our opinion, is a clear violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The issue before us, however, is
not whether Mr. Ho is guilty, but whether he has been
properly and fairly found guilty under our procedures.
LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES IN GENERAL
The threshold issue in the determination of this case
is whether the Fundamental Standard violation proven
against Mr. Ho is one of which he could be convicted,
despite the failure of the prosecution to prove its allega
tion that Mr. Ho had committed his act with a purpose
to steal food. If it was not, we need proceed no further.
The prosecution alleges that defendant was properly
convicted under a "lesser included offense" theory. It is,
indeed, a general principle of law in criminal prosecu
tions that, if the prosecution charges that the defendant
did act A with an intent to accomplish Band the
prosecution proves that the defendant did act A but
cannot meet its burden of proof on the defendant's
intent to do B, the defendant may nonetheless be con
victed of doing act A-if that act is also, in itself, an
offense. Thus, if a defendant is charged with assault with
intent to kill and the prosecution cannot sustain its
burden as to the intent, the defendant may nonetheless
be convicted of the lesser included offense of assault
assuming, of course, that assault is an offense within the
legal system in question.
Indeed, the principle covers more than simply cases
where the prosecution is unable to prove an intent it has
charged. A defendant may be convicted of assault where
the prosecution has charged him with assault with a
deadly weapon. And if a defendant is charged with
drunken driving but the prosecution cannot prove that
he was actually driving, (either because he might have
been merely a passenger or because the car might have
been motionless) the defendant may, nonetheless, be
convicted of being drunk in an automobile-assuming, of
course, that under the law of that jurisdiction, (as is the
case in California), being drunk in an automobile is also
a punishable offense.
In short, in the criminal system at large, where a
defendant is charged with all the elements of an offense,
he is on notice that he must defend against any combina
tion of these factual elements which also is punishable.
One of the issues before us in this case is whether this is
the proper rule before the CJP, as well.
THE BURGLARY ANALOGY
Defense counsel make two basic arguments on this
issue. First, they argue that the original charge at issue
here, entering a room with intent to commit an offense
therein, is very much like the charges lodged in the local
courts for violation of the California burglary statute.
Since, under California law, burglary has no lesser
included offenses (except, of course, attempted bur
glary), defendant argues that the same rule should pre
vail before the CJP. In other words, since we are reason
ing by analogy here, defendant claims that the analogy
to the specific California burglary rule should prevail
before the CJP over the more general analogy to the
failure to prove an intent charged.
We do not find this argument persuasive. The reason
why the California burglary statute has no lesser
included offense is simply that the act of entering a
room or building is not illegal at all, unless it occurs
together with the forbidden intent. Hence, unless the
prosecution can show that intent, the defendant is guilty
of no wrongful conduct whatsoever. Interestingly, in
most states, where burglary requires a breaking and
entering as well as an intent, the crime does have a lesser
included offense, "breaking and entering." Here, where
entirely apart from any purpose to steal, the act of the
defendant, under the circumstances of this case, would
seem to us to be a clear violation of the Fundamental
Standard, the analogy to the California burglary statute
appears inapposite.

LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES
IN FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD CASES
The second contention of the defendant on this issue
is more troublesome The defendant would have us hold,
on much broader grounds, that the lesser included offen
se doctrine can never apply to Fundamental Standard
violations. Defense counsel contend that where the pros
ecution charges facts amounting to a Fundamental Stan
dard violation, but does not prove all of those facts, the
prosecution cannot prevail, even though the lesser facts
it has proven also amount to Fundamental Standard
violation.
THE PROBLEM OF SURPRISE
Defendant's argument is premised in part on the lact
that the Fundamental Standard is so broad that a defen
dant attempting to meet a charge of its violation is
vulnerable to surprise at the hearing through the intro
duction of facts and issues he is unprepared to meet.
Defendant recognizes, as he must, that no frontal attack
upon the Fundamental Standard is possible. After all, it
has been a part of University law since the time of David
Starr Jordan. The defense earnestly contends, however,
that the allowance of a lesser included offense within a
Fundamental Standard charge compounds unduly what
is a built-in problem in the administration of such a
broad rule.
This facet of the defense argument is considerably
weakened by the alternative remedy available to defen
dants under the CJP procedures. Indeed, the CJP proce
dures can be far better adapted to protecting a defen
dant against surprise than can those of the outside soci
ety. In the criminal trial, a defendant who is surprised by
the prosecution's introduction of an issue cannot have
the jury kept together for an appreciable time while he
attempts to find new evidence to meet the prosecution's
evidence. Under the CJP system, the remedy to avoid
any surprise is simply the right of the party to ask the
hearing officer for sufficient time to produce his evi
dence. We cannot conceive of any reasonable continu
ance being denied by a hearing officer in a situation
where a claim of surprise or lack of notice is made in
good faith. And, if such a request for reasonable contin
uance is denied, the claim of prejudice due to lack of
notice is raisable before this Panel, as well.
Defendant's complaint as to the Fundamental Stan
dard, however, is broader than merely that its vagueness
offers insufficient protection against surprise at trial.
The defense's complaint is that uncertainty in exactly
what constitutes a Fundamental Standard violation
places the defense in jeopardy in other ways.
First of all, we should distinguish this argument from
another quite different one which sounds somewhat
similar. The defendant is not here contending that he
should be acquitted because the Fundamental Standard
is so vague that he did not know that what he was doing
in the Faculty Club was in violation of University law.
To be sure, at its outer edges the Fundamental Standard
is extremely murky, but a defendant whose acts are a
clear violation cannot raise the fact that others might
violate the Standard unwittingly. Indeed, the issue is not
whether the defendant knew his actions were in viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard, but whether he
should have known.
THE RIGHT NOT TO HELP THE PROSECUTION
However, it is in part because of the fact that a
student can be guilty of a Fundamental Standard viola
tion even though he believes he is correct and the com
munity judgment wrong, that we must pay particular
attention to defense counsel's argument on this issue.
The claim in essence is that the minimal limits of the
Fundamental Standard are so indefinite that a defendant
may be unable to meet a charge of Fundamental Stand
ard violation without, perhaps, helping the prosecution
prove some lesser included offense.
It is not a complete answer to this to say that in order
for discipline to be imposed, the Fundamental Standard
violation must be clear to us. It is quite conceivable that
a defense attorney, with values similar to those of his
client, might not appreciate that certain actions did
constitute a Fundamental Standard violation clear to the
rest of the community. In such a case, he might indeed
unwittingly help the prosecution prove its case.
For the most part, however, we do not apprehend
that this difficulty faced by a defendant is a sympathetic
one considering the structure of our proceedings and the
protections the defendant does have. The basic purpose
of the hearing before the examiner is to find out the
facts—who did what, when and where, with what state
of mind. Certainly, the hearing examiner must perform
his function in a way fair to the defendant and giving
full effect to any specific rights provided by our rules.
The hearing before the hearing examiner, however, is not
a game. The defendant certainly has the right to put the
prosecution to its proof, but if he helps prow the facts
which actually exist, we cannot regard this as a disadvan
tage of the CJP procedures.
In one situation, however, the defendant's fear of
helping the prosecution prove its case is entitled to
recognition. Our rules give a defendant a specific right
not to testify and we should give this right a broad
scope. Part of such a scope is to make sure that a
defendant, in exercising his right, fully appreciates the
consequences to himself. Accordingly, should a defen
dant admit at the hearing facts which he may not appre
ciate constitute a violation, he should be warned that
this is the case and be given an opportunity to withdraw
his statement before his conviction can be founded on
his testimony. If he does withdraw his admission and
does not within the scope of cross examination repeat it,
his statement may not be considered against him by the
hearing officer or this Panel.
This rule, however, is not determinative of this case.
The (act is that, rather than admitting the lesser included
offense alleged by the prosecutor here as a basis for
conviction, Mr. Ho denied that he had exerted any force
on the door.
THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE ALL FACTS
Another facet ot defendant's argument is also related
to the possibility of failure to appreciate facts showing a
Fundamental Standard violation. Defendant argues that

because a defendant and his counsel might not recognize
the significance of facts which amounted to a Funda
mental Standard violation, these facts might not be fully
and tairly litigatej. As a result, the hearing examiner
might find untrae, misleading or incomplete facts. We
recognize this problem, but feel the solution is not to
prevent the finding of lesser included offenses in Funda
mental Standard cases. Rather, it is to give the defendant
full opportunity and notice to litigate any fact which
may be important to the disposition of his case-a mat
ter to which we will return shortly.
THE PLEADING REQUIREMENTS OF THE CJP
Finally, our decision that lesser included offenses can
be shown in Fundamental Standard cases is buttressed
by another consideration. The major operative effect of
accepting defendant's position would be to force the
prosecutor, in drafting his charges in the future, to join
all of the possible factual elements he thought he might
be able to prove, separately and in combination as sepa
rate charges. This would be complicated enough in sim
ple Fundamental Standard cases. It would be even more
so where Disruption charges and Fundamental Standard
violations are joined-as they might have been in this
case. Disruptions, most of which—when they are not
within a justification defense—are probably also Funda
mental Standard violations, can overlap in complex ways
with Fundamental Standard violations.
There is not sufficient reason to place such a burden
of drafting upon the prosecutor, especially since in those
jurisdictions which have attempted to guarantee com
plete notice through pleading, the pleadings have be
come so prolix and confusing that they became an
obstruction to rational fact finding. Moreover, though
the vagueness of the Fundamental Standard may work
against the defense, the lack of weaponry given to the
prosecutor in our system works against him even more,
in attempting to learn with a high degree of precision the
facts of the events leading to his charge. Unlike the
prosecutor in the civil courts, the University administra
tion has no equivalent of a grand jury subpoena (indeed
it cannot even subpoena witnesses at trial). Moreover,
the prosecutor in the university system has no right to a
preliminary hearing which can permit the prosecutor in
the civil society to determine, to a much greater extent,
which facts he can and which he cannot prove at trial,
and hence to shape his charges better.
Indeed the issue of whether to allow lesser included
offenses in Fundamental Standard violations is only one
facet of a much larger problem—the purpose of the
charge in the CJP procedures. Although there are obvi
ously many analogies to the criminal law in our proce
dures—most obviously the requirement of a reasonable
doubt standard—these are not criminal cases. This is
made clear by the relatively limited nature of our sanc
tions, which-though we regard them as quite severe—are
hardly equal to those of the criminal courts; the fact
that consequences and procedures similar to ours are
used in obviously civil cases such as those involving
industrial relations and faculty discipline; and the prin
ciple that the major purpose of society is, in a sense to
enforce its law, while the major purposes for which the
University exists, and which control its allocations of
resources, are education and the advancement of know
ledge.
The purpose of the charge in our system is analogous
to that under the more modern civil rules. It is not what
is called "fact" or "issue" pleading, but is "notice"
pleading where the purpose of the charge is to specify
the general area for litigation while other devices are
relied upon to permit full and fair litigation of the facts.
In a civil case, it is quite common for one side or the
other to move at the end of trial to amend its pleadings
to conform to the evidence produced. This motion is
generally granted where no prejudice to the other party
is shown. Indeed, even in criminal cases prosecuted by
information (in which, as in the University, the prosecu
tor rather than a grand jury brings the charges) the
prosecutor may amend his pleading during trial to cover
any offense shown by the evidence.
It should be made clear that our view of the CJP
pleading requirements is as likely to benefit the defen
dant as the prosecutor. We must remember that the CJP
system recognizes within itself the concept of double
jeopardy and a defendant, once acquitted of a charge
before the CJP, cannot be retried on the same charge in
our system regardless of what new evidence of his guilt
the prosecutor can discover. Since that is the case, a
narrow construction of the charge will permit the prose
cutor to retry the defendant on a closely related but
different charge, while the view that the charge before us
is broader than that in the criminal law will more nar
rowly restrict the prosecutor in subsequent charges.
In the criminal system, the more narrowly defined
relationship between the words of the charge and the
crimes of which the defendant may be convicted can
have severe consequences to the defendant. In a criminal
case, where the defendant has burned down a building,
killing several of its occupants, the prosecutor can, in
almost all jurisdictions, convict him of one murder after
another based on the same fact situation, until the jury
returns the death sentence that the prosecutor desires.
Our rule prevents the vices of a narrow construction of
charges, and, if a consequence of preventing such abuse
is a broadening of the relation between the charge and
the evidence, we think that both in terms of fairness to
the defendant and accuracy in the fact-finding process, it
is the better choice.
THE REASON FOR REVERSAL
Our disagreement with the defendants on the allow
ance of lesser included offenses in Fundamental Stan
dard cases by no means settles this case, however. All we
have thus far held is that, if the hearing is a fair one, a
defendant charged with forcing one's way into a room
with a purpose to steal can be convicted of simply
forcing his way into the room-where the circumstances
are such that that act is also a violation of the Funda
mental Standard.
However, in this case, we feel that the hearing, insofar
as it purported to determine that Mr. Ho did in fact
force his way through the doors leading to the Faculty
Club kitchen, was not a fair one. We believe defense
counsels' assertions that, at the trial, they did not think

that Mr. Ho could be convicted of any lesser included
offense. It is likely, therefore that they did not attempt
fully to contest the facts which might support his con
viction on such an offense. Defense counsel claim, and
we believe, that they felt that they had the case won on
the issue of the defendant's purpose, and hence, that
they did not need to try very hard to show that the
defendant was not guilty of the other element charged—
forcing his way through the doors. Certainly, on this
record, we cannot assume that the defendants did not
have several witnesses whom they could have called to
raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the hearing
officer as to whether the defendant applied force to the
doors or aided or encouraged anyone else to do so.
In this case, we cannot say that the defense attorneys,
without the benefit of hindsight, were obviously wrong
on the rules as to lesser included offense in our system.
This is a new judicial system. It contains, inevitably,
many unclear points-at least until the Panel itself clari
fies them (and even then they become clear, not because
we are correct, but because it is our position in the
system to say what the rules should be). We note also
that even though we rule today that he had no such
duty, the prosecutor could in fact have obviated the
whole problem by additionally charging the forcing into
the kitchen as a separate offense or by joining a charge
of disruption along with that of the Fundamental Stan
dard violation. Moreover he could have simply stated
clearly his theory of the case to the defense counsel at
any point before the end of the hearing. Similarly,
though the hearing officer seems to have believed that
the lesser included offense doctrine was applicable in
this case, he, too, made no effort to make his opinion
clear to the defense.
THE POSSIBILITY OF A REMAND
Our decision that Mr. Ho cannot be convicted on this
record because of the possible prejudice to him in the
litigation of the facts, by no means determines the
disposition of this case The CJP procedures provide that
we may remand a case back to the hearing examiner for
additional findings should they be necessary, and cer
tainly this implies a right to remand the matter to him if
any of the findings which he actually made were not
properly litigated.
Indeed, this will be the proper course in most cases
assuming there are any such cases where the particular
facts and theories justifying conviction have not been
made clear to the defense during the hearing. The only
reason it cannot be done in the criminal courts is that
once the jury has rendered its verdict, the jurors cannot
be reassembled for further findings—both because of the
practical difficulties involved and because, in the inter
im, they may have been exposed to improper influences.
Interestingly enough, where a judge sits without a jury, a
procedure more analogous to ours, an appellate court
can return a case for further findings, or indeed, for the
reception of further evidence on the findings already
made.
This is the preferable means of disposition before the
CJP in any case where it is alleged that, for one reason or
another, there was not fair notice and that there was
such surprise to the defendants that they could not
properly litigate a question which turned out to be
important. This procedure protects the legitimate right
of the defendant to a proper and accurate finding of
fact; and insofar as a defendant may have been misled
into producing evidence, other than his own testimony,
which is in fact true, we do not regard this as a suffi
ciently unfortunate consequence of our decision to de
part from what, in every other way, is clearly the better
rule.
This is not to say that, in all cases, a difference
between the charge and the proof will make a remand to
the hearing officer the proper course. First, if the proof
bears absolutely no relation to the charge, the demands
of procedural regularity would require an acquittal of
the charge as the only proper course-leaving the prose
cutor to start all over again with the charge supported by
his evidence. Second, a remand may be prevented by a
showing or permanent prejudice to the defendant caused
by events subsequent to the surprise to him. If, for
instance, witnesses available-to the defendant at the first
hearing have, before a remand, disappeared or left the
area, the first issue may not be susceptible of fair litiga
tion, and a remand might not be proper.
THE REASONS FOR ACQUITTAL HERE
In the case at issue here, there is a very different, and
we trust quite unusual, reason not to remand the case to
the hearing officer. In this case, Mr. Ho has already
undergone eight hearings before the hearing examiner
and one before us. In another case involving an alleged
classroom disruption, he has undergone eleven hearings
before the hearing examiner and, so far as we can tell,
may have to endure another before us. Moreover, he has
recently been charged, together with nine others, with
disrupting a meeting of the Academic Council, a matter
which if our past experience is any guide, will consume a
great many hearings before the hearing examiner.
In this situation, a remand of this case to the hearing
examiner might well consume several more hearings at a
time when Mr. Ho was more than merely busy with
other cases against him. This would border upon harass
ment and our reluctance to inflict this upon Mr. Ho is
fortified by the fact that the remand would have been
necessitated without fault on his or his counsels' part,
and in a situation where the possibility of a remand to
the hearing examiner was, most likely, one which they
had never contemplated. Now that our procedures are
clearer in this matter, it is most unlikely that this parti
cular equity, presently working in Mr. Ho's behalf, will
occur again.
In any event, it is working in this particular case and
this is enough to make the difference. Accordingly, we
recommend that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case
be dropped.

For the reasons we state below at some length, we
feel that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case should be
dismissed. Under the circumstances of this case, Mr. Ho
cannot be convicted of the violation of the Fundamental
Standard found in the hearing examiner's report, and a
remand to the hearing examiner for the cure of the
defect in the hearing before him is, under the facts of
this case, not a fair alternative.
The defendant, Mr. Ho, was charged before the Cam
pus Judicial Panel by the University administration with
a violation of the Fundamental Standard in two particu
lars: that he committed an assault and that he "together
with others, forced his way into the kitchen of the
Stanford Faculty Club for the purpose of stealing food
from that kitchen." The hearing examiner acquitted Mr.
Ho of the first charge, the assault. As to the second
charge, the hearing examiner found, in essence, that
though Mr. Ho had no purpose to steal food from the
kitchen, he had nonetheless helped force his way into
the kitchen. The specific findings of the hearing exam
iner (with their contexts in brackets) are:
3. 1 find that Mr. Ho was informed by responsible
officials of the Faculty Club, whose position of re
sponsibility was known to him, that he was not
allowed in the rear of the Club. [Past the doors which
led to the kitchen]
4. I find that Mr. Ho by words and gestures, encour
aged the persons in the dining area to assist him in
gaining access to the hallway [on the other side of
the doors]
5. I find that the double doors leading to the hallway
were opened in response to physical force exerted by
Mr. Ho and others, [and against the resistance of two
faculty club employees]
In short, Mr. Ho was found to have forced his way into
an area where he had been told by legitimate authority
that he had no business.
No justification for Mr. Ho's acts appearing, we have
no doubt that the hearing examiner's report makes out
what, at least in our opinion, is a clear violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The issue before us, however, is
not whether Mr. Ho is guilty, but whether he has been
properly and fairly found guilty under our procedures.
LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES IN GENERAL
The threshold issue in the determination of this case
is whether the Fundamental Standard violation proven
against Mr. Ho is one of which he could be convicted,
despite the failure of the prosecution to prove its allega
tion that Mr. Ho had committed his act with a purpose
to steal food. If it was not, we need proceed no further.
The prosecution alleges that defendant was properly
convicted under a "lesser included offense" theory. It is,
indeed, a general principle of law in criminal prosecu
tions that, if the prosecution charges that the defendant
did act A with an intent to accomplish Band the
prosecution proves that the defendant did act A but
cannot meet its burden of proof on the defendant's
intent to do B, the defendant may nonetheless be con
victed of doing act A-if that act is also, in itself, an
offense. Thus, if a defendant is charged with assault with
intent to kill and the prosecution cannot sustain its
burden as to the intent, the defendant may nonetheless
be convicted of the lesser included offense of assault
assuming, of course, that assault is an offense within the
legal system in question.
Indeed, the principle covers more than simply cases
where the prosecution is unable to prove an intent it has
charged. A defendant may be convicted of assault where
the prosecution has charged him with assault with a
deadly weapon. And if a defendant is charged with
drunken driving but the prosecution cannot prove that
he was actually driving, (either because he might have
been merely a passenger or because the car might have
been motionless) the defendant may, nonetheless, be
convicted of being drunk in an automobile-assuming, of
course, that under the law of that jurisdiction, (as is the
case in California), being drunk in an automobile is also
a punishable offense.
In short, in the criminal system at large, where a
defendant is charged with all the elements of an offense,
he is on notice that he must defend against any combina
tion of these factual elements which also is punishable.
One of the issues before us in this case is whether this is
the proper rule before the CJP, as well.
THE BURGLARY ANALOGY
Defense counsel make two basic arguments on this
issue. First, they argue that the original charge at issue
here, entering a room with intent to commit an offense
therein, is very much like the charges lodged in the local
courts for violation of the California burglary statute.
Since, under California law, burglary has no lesser
included offenses (except, of course, attempted bur
glary), defendant argues that the same rule should pre
vail before the CJP. In other words, since we are reason
ing by analogy here, defendant claims that the analogy
to the specific California burglary rule should prevail
before the CJP over the more general analogy to the
failure to prove an intent charged.
We do not find this argument persuasive. The reason
why the California burglary statute has no lesser
included offense is simply that the act of entering a
room or building is not illegal at all, unless it occurs
together with the forbidden intent. Hence, unless the
prosecution can show that intent, the defendant is guilty
of no wrongful conduct whatsoever. Interestingly, in
most states, where burglary requires a breaking and
entering as well as an intent, the crime does have a lesser
included offense, "breaking and entering." Here, where
entirely apart from any purpose to steal, the act of the
defendant, under the circumstances of this case, would
seem to us to be a clear violation of the Fundamental
Standard, the analogy to the California burglary statute
appears inapposite.

LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES
IN FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD CASES
The second contention of the defendant on this issue
is more troublesome The defendant would have us hold,
on much broader grounds, that the lesser included offen
se doctrine can never apply to Fundamental Standard
violations. Defense counsel contend that where the pros
ecution charges facts amounting to a Fundamental Stan
dard violation, but does not prove all of those facts, the
prosecution cannot prevail, even though the lesser facts
it has proven also amount to Fundamental Standard
violation.
THE PROBLEM OF SURPRISE
Defendant's argument is premised in part on the lact
that the Fundamental Standard is so broad that a defen
dant attempting to meet a charge of its violation is
vulnerable to surprise at the hearing through the intro
duction of facts and issues he is unprepared to meet.
Defendant recognizes, as he must, that no frontal attack
upon the Fundamental Standard is possible. After all, it
has been a part of University law since the time of David
Starr Jordan. The defense earnestly contends, however,
that the allowance of a lesser included offense within a
Fundamental Standard charge compounds unduly what
is a built-in problem in the administration of such a
broad rule.
This facet of the defense argument is considerably
weakened by the alternative remedy available to defen
dants under the CJP procedures. Indeed, the CJP proce
dures can be far better adapted to protecting a defen
dant against surprise than can those of the outside soci
ety. In the criminal trial, a defendant who is surprised by
the prosecution's introduction of an issue cannot have
the jury kept together for an appreciable time while he
attempts to find new evidence to meet the prosecution's
evidence. Under the CJP system, the remedy to avoid
any surprise is simply the right of the party to ask the
hearing officer for sufficient time to produce his evi
dence. We cannot conceive of any reasonable continu
ance being denied by a hearing officer in a situation
where a claim of surprise or lack of notice is made in
good faith. And, if such a request for reasonable contin
uance is denied, the claim of prejudice due to lack of
notice is raisable before this Panel, as well.
Defendant's complaint as to the Fundamental Stan
dard, however, is broader than merely that its vagueness
offers insufficient protection against surprise at trial.
The defense's complaint is that uncertainty in exactly
what constitutes a Fundamental Standard violation
places the defense in jeopardy in other ways.
First of all, we should distinguish this argument from
another quite different one which sounds somewhat
similar. The defendant is not here contending that he
should be acquitted because the Fundamental Standard
is so vague that he did not know that what he was doing
in the Faculty Club was in violation of University law.
To be sure, at its outer edges the Fundamental Standard
is extremely murky, but a defendant whose acts are a
clear violation cannot raise the fact that others might
violate the Standard unwittingly. Indeed, the issue is not
whether the defendant knew his actions were in viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard, but whether he
should have known.
THE RIGHT NOT TO HELP THE PROSECUTION
However, it is in part because of the fact that a
student can be guilty of a Fundamental Standard viola
tion even though he believes he is correct and the com
munity judgment wrong, that we must pay particular
attention to defense counsel's argument on this issue.
The claim in essence is that the minimal limits of the
Fundamental Standard are so indefinite that a defendant
may be unable to meet a charge of Fundamental Stand
ard violation without, perhaps, helping the prosecution
prove some lesser included offense.
It is not a complete answer to this to say that in order
for discipline to be imposed, the Fundamental Standard
violation must be clear to us. It is quite conceivable that
a defense attorney, with values similar to those of his
client, might not appreciate that certain actions did
constitute a Fundamental Standard violation clear to the
rest of the community. In such a case, he might indeed
unwittingly help the prosecution prove its case.
For the most part, however, we do not apprehend
that this difficulty faced by a defendant is a sympathetic
one considering the structure of our proceedings and the
protections the defendant does have. The basic purpose
of the hearing before the examiner is to find out the
facts—who did what, when and where, with what state
of mind. Certainly, the hearing examiner must perform
his function in a way fair to the defendant and giving
full effect to any specific rights provided by our rules.
The hearing before the hearing examiner, however, is not
a game. The defendant certainly has the right to put the
prosecution to its proof, but if he helps prow the facts
which actually exist, we cannot regard this as a disadvan
tage of the CJP procedures.
In one situation, however, the defendant's fear of
helping the prosecution prove its case is entitled to
recognition. Our rules give a defendant a specific right
not to testify and we should give this right a broad
scope. Part of such a scope is to make sure that a
defendant, in exercising his right, fully appreciates the
consequences to himself. Accordingly, should a defen
dant admit at the hearing facts which he may not appre
ciate constitute a violation, he should be warned that
this is the case and be given an opportunity to withdraw
his statement before his conviction can be founded on
his testimony. If he does withdraw his admission and
does not within the scope of cross examination repeat it,
his statement may not be considered against him by the
hearing officer or this Panel.
This rule, however, is not determinative of this case.
The (act is that, rather than admitting the lesser included
offense alleged by the prosecutor here as a basis for
conviction, Mr. Ho denied that he had exerted any force
on the door.
THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE ALL FACTS
Another facet ot defendant's argument is also related
to the possibility of failure to appreciate facts showing a
Fundamental Standard violation. Defendant argues that

because a defendant and his counsel might not recognize
the significance of facts which amounted to a Funda
mental Standard violation, these facts might not be fully
and tairly litigatej. As a result, the hearing examiner
might find untrae, misleading or incomplete facts. We
recognize this problem, but feel the solution is not to
prevent the finding of lesser included offenses in Funda
mental Standard cases. Rather, it is to give the defendant
full opportunity and notice to litigate any fact which
may be important to the disposition of his case-a mat
ter to which we will return shortly.
THE PLEADING REQUIREMENTS OF THE CJP
Finally, our decision that lesser included offenses can
be shown in Fundamental Standard cases is buttressed
by another consideration. The major operative effect of
accepting defendant's position would be to force the
prosecutor, in drafting his charges in the future, to join
all of the possible factual elements he thought he might
be able to prove, separately and in combination as sepa
rate charges. This would be complicated enough in sim
ple Fundamental Standard cases. It would be even more
so where Disruption charges and Fundamental Standard
violations are joined-as they might have been in this
case. Disruptions, most of which—when they are not
within a justification defense—are probably also Funda
mental Standard violations, can overlap in complex ways
with Fundamental Standard violations.
There is not sufficient reason to place such a burden
of drafting upon the prosecutor, especially since in those
jurisdictions which have attempted to guarantee com
plete notice through pleading, the pleadings have be
come so prolix and confusing that they became an
obstruction to rational fact finding. Moreover, though
the vagueness of the Fundamental Standard may work
against the defense, the lack of weaponry given to the
prosecutor in our system works against him even more,
in attempting to learn with a high degree of precision the
facts of the events leading to his charge. Unlike the
prosecutor in the civil courts, the University administra
tion has no equivalent of a grand jury subpoena (indeed
it cannot even subpoena witnesses at trial). Moreover,
the prosecutor in the university system has no right to a
preliminary hearing which can permit the prosecutor in
the civil society to determine, to a much greater extent,
which facts he can and which he cannot prove at trial,
and hence to shape his charges better.
Indeed the issue of whether to allow lesser included
offenses in Fundamental Standard violations is only one
facet of a much larger problem—the purpose of the
charge in the CJP procedures. Although there are obvi
ously many analogies to the criminal law in our proce
dures—most obviously the requirement of a reasonable
doubt standard—these are not criminal cases. This is
made clear by the relatively limited nature of our sanc
tions, which-though we regard them as quite severe—are
hardly equal to those of the criminal courts; the fact
that consequences and procedures similar to ours are
used in obviously civil cases such as those involving
industrial relations and faculty discipline; and the prin
ciple that the major purpose of society is, in a sense to
enforce its law, while the major purposes for which the
University exists, and which control its allocations of
resources, are education and the advancement of know
ledge.
The purpose of the charge in our system is analogous
to that under the more modern civil rules. It is not what
is called "fact" or "issue" pleading, but is "notice"
pleading where the purpose of the charge is to specify
the general area for litigation while other devices are
relied upon to permit full and fair litigation of the facts.
In a civil case, it is quite common for one side or the
other to move at the end of trial to amend its pleadings
to conform to the evidence produced. This motion is
generally granted where no prejudice to the other party
is shown. Indeed, even in criminal cases prosecuted by
information (in which, as in the University, the prosecu
tor rather than a grand jury brings the charges) the
prosecutor may amend his pleading during trial to cover
any offense shown by the evidence.
It should be made clear that our view of the CJP
pleading requirements is as likely to benefit the defen
dant as the prosecutor. We must remember that the CJP
system recognizes within itself the concept of double
jeopardy and a defendant, once acquitted of a charge
before the CJP, cannot be retried on the same charge in
our system regardless of what new evidence of his guilt
the prosecutor can discover. Since that is the case, a
narrow construction of the charge will permit the prose
cutor to retry the defendant on a closely related but
different charge, while the view that the charge before us
is broader than that in the criminal law will more nar
rowly restrict the prosecutor in subsequent charges.
In the criminal system, the more narrowly defined
relationship between the words of the charge and the
crimes of which the defendant may be convicted can
have severe consequences to the defendant. In a criminal
case, where the defendant has burned down a building,
killing several of its occupants, the prosecutor can, in
almost all jurisdictions, convict him of one murder after
another based on the same fact situation, until the jury
returns the death sentence that the prosecutor desires.
Our rule prevents the vices of a narrow construction of
charges, and, if a consequence of preventing such abuse
is a broadening of the relation between the charge and
the evidence, we think that both in terms of fairness to
the defendant and accuracy in the fact-finding process, it
is the better choice.
THE REASON FOR REVERSAL
Our disagreement with the defendants on the allow
ance of lesser included offenses in Fundamental Stan
dard cases by no means settles this case, however. All we
have thus far held is that, if the hearing is a fair one, a
defendant charged with forcing one's way into a room
with a purpose to steal can be convicted of simply
forcing his way into the room-where the circumstances
are such that that act is also a violation of the Funda
mental Standard.
However, in this case, we feel that the hearing, insofar
as it purported to determine that Mr. Ho did in fact
force his way through the doors leading to the Faculty
Club kitchen, was not a fair one. We believe defense
counsels' assertions that, at the trial, they did not think

that Mr. Ho could be convicted of any lesser included
offense. It is likely, therefore that they did not attempt
fully to contest the facts which might support his con
viction on such an offense. Defense counsel claim, and
we believe, that they felt that they had the case won on
the issue of the defendant's purpose, and hence, that
they did not need to try very hard to show that the
defendant was not guilty of the other element charged—
forcing his way through the doors. Certainly, on this
record, we cannot assume that the defendants did not
have several witnesses whom they could have called to
raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the hearing
officer as to whether the defendant applied force to the
doors or aided or encouraged anyone else to do so.
In this case, we cannot say that the defense attorneys,
without the benefit of hindsight, were obviously wrong
on the rules as to lesser included offense in our system.
This is a new judicial system. It contains, inevitably,
many unclear points-at least until the Panel itself clari
fies them (and even then they become clear, not because
we are correct, but because it is our position in the
system to say what the rules should be). We note also
that even though we rule today that he had no such
duty, the prosecutor could in fact have obviated the
whole problem by additionally charging the forcing into
the kitchen as a separate offense or by joining a charge
of disruption along with that of the Fundamental Stan
dard violation. Moreover he could have simply stated
clearly his theory of the case to the defense counsel at
any point before the end of the hearing. Similarly,
though the hearing officer seems to have believed that
the lesser included offense doctrine was applicable in
this case, he, too, made no effort to make his opinion
clear to the defense.
THE POSSIBILITY OF A REMAND
Our decision that Mr. Ho cannot be convicted on this
record because of the possible prejudice to him in the
litigation of the facts, by no means determines the
disposition of this case The CJP procedures provide that
we may remand a case back to the hearing examiner for
additional findings should they be necessary, and cer
tainly this implies a right to remand the matter to him if
any of the findings which he actually made were not
properly litigated.
Indeed, this will be the proper course in most cases
assuming there are any such cases where the particular
facts and theories justifying conviction have not been
made clear to the defense during the hearing. The only
reason it cannot be done in the criminal courts is that
once the jury has rendered its verdict, the jurors cannot
be reassembled for further findings—both because of the
practical difficulties involved and because, in the inter
im, they may have been exposed to improper influences.
Interestingly enough, where a judge sits without a jury, a
procedure more analogous to ours, an appellate court
can return a case for further findings, or indeed, for the
reception of further evidence on the findings already
made.
This is the preferable means of disposition before the
CJP in any case where it is alleged that, for one reason or
another, there was not fair notice and that there was
such surprise to the defendants that they could not
properly litigate a question which turned out to be
important. This procedure protects the legitimate right
of the defendant to a proper and accurate finding of
fact; and insofar as a defendant may have been misled
into producing evidence, other than his own testimony,
which is in fact true, we do not regard this as a suffi
ciently unfortunate consequence of our decision to de
part from what, in every other way, is clearly the better
rule.
This is not to say that, in all cases, a difference
between the charge and the proof will make a remand to
the hearing officer the proper course. First, if the proof
bears absolutely no relation to the charge, the demands
of procedural regularity would require an acquittal of
the charge as the only proper course-leaving the prose
cutor to start all over again with the charge supported by
his evidence. Second, a remand may be prevented by a
showing or permanent prejudice to the defendant caused
by events subsequent to the surprise to him. If, for
instance, witnesses available-to the defendant at the first
hearing have, before a remand, disappeared or left the
area, the first issue may not be susceptible of fair litiga
tion, and a remand might not be proper.
THE REASONS FOR ACQUITTAL HERE
In the case at issue here, there is a very different, and
we trust quite unusual, reason not to remand the case to
the hearing officer. In this case, Mr. Ho has already
undergone eight hearings before the hearing examiner
and one before us. In another case involving an alleged
classroom disruption, he has undergone eleven hearings
before the hearing examiner and, so far as we can tell,
may have to endure another before us. Moreover, he has
recently been charged, together with nine others, with
disrupting a meeting of the Academic Council, a matter
which if our past experience is any guide, will consume a
great many hearings before the hearing examiner.
In this situation, a remand of this case to the hearing
examiner might well consume several more hearings at a
time when Mr. Ho was more than merely busy with
other cases against him. This would border upon harass
ment and our reluctance to inflict this upon Mr. Ho is
fortified by the fact that the remand would have been
necessitated without fault on his or his counsels' part,
and in a situation where the possibility of a remand to
the hearing examiner was, most likely, one which they
had never contemplated. Now that our procedures are
clearer in this matter, it is most unlikely that this parti
cular equity, presently working in Mr. Ho's behalf, will
occur again.
In any event, it is working in this particular case and
this is enough to make the difference. Accordingly, we
recommend that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case
be dropped.

Terrence Edward Pape
Charles Ellwood Stiver
Victor Vilaplana
Robert L. White
For the reasons we state below at some length, we
feel that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case should be
dismissed. Under the circumstances of this case, Mr. Ho
cannot be convicted of the violation of the Fundamental
Standard found in the hearing examiner's report, and a
remand to the hearing examiner for the cure of the
defect in the hearing before him is, under the facts of
this case, not a fair alternative.
The defendant, Mr. Ho, was charged before the Cam
pus Judicial Panel by the University administration with
a violation of the Fundamental Standard in two particu
lars: that he committed an assault and that he "together
with others, forced his way into the kitchen of the
Stanford Faculty Club for the purpose of stealing food
from that kitchen." The hearing examiner acquitted Mr.
Ho of the first charge, the assault. As to the second
charge, the hearing examiner found, in essence, that
though Mr. Ho had no purpose to steal food from the
kitchen, he had nonetheless helped force his way into
the kitchen. The specific findings of the hearing exam
iner (with their contexts in brackets) are:
3. 1 find that Mr. Ho was informed by responsible
officials of the Faculty Club, whose position of re
sponsibility was known to him, that he was not
allowed in the rear of the Club. [Past the doors which
led to the kitchen]
4. I find that Mr. Ho by words and gestures, encour
aged the persons in the dining area to assist him in
gaining access to the hallway [on the other side of
the doors]
5. I find that the double doors leading to the hallway
were opened in response to physical force exerted by
Mr. Ho and others, [and against the resistance of two
faculty club employees]
In short, Mr. Ho was found to have forced his way into
an area where he had been told by legitimate authority
that he had no business.
No justification for Mr. Ho's acts appearing, we have
no doubt that the hearing examiner's report makes out
what, at least in our opinion, is a clear violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The issue before us, however, is
not whether Mr. Ho is guilty, but whether he has been
properly and fairly found guilty under our procedures.
LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES IN GENERAL
The threshold issue in the determination of this case
is whether the Fundamental Standard violation proven
against Mr. Ho is one of which he could be convicted,
despite the failure of the prosecution to prove its allega
tion that Mr. Ho had committed his act with a purpose
to steal food. If it was not, we need proceed no further.
The prosecution alleges that defendant was properly
convicted under a "lesser included offense" theory. It is,
indeed, a general principle of law in criminal prosecu
tions that, if the prosecution charges that the defendant
did act A with an intent to accomplish Band the
prosecution proves that the defendant did act A but
cannot meet its burden of proof on the defendant's
intent to do B, the defendant may nonetheless be con
victed of doing act A-if that act is also, in itself, an
offense. Thus, if a defendant is charged with assault with
intent to kill and the prosecution cannot sustain its
burden as to the intent, the defendant may nonetheless
be convicted of the lesser included offense of assault
assuming, of course, that assault is an offense within the
legal system in question.
Indeed, the principle covers more than simply cases
where the prosecution is unable to prove an intent it has
charged. A defendant may be convicted of assault where
the prosecution has charged him with assault with a
deadly weapon. And if a defendant is charged with
drunken driving but the prosecution cannot prove that
he was actually driving, (either because he might have
been merely a passenger or because the car might have
been motionless) the defendant may, nonetheless, be
convicted of being drunk in an automobile-assuming, of
course, that under the law of that jurisdiction, (as is the
case in California), being drunk in an automobile is also
a punishable offense.
In short, in the criminal system at large, where a
defendant is charged with all the elements of an offense,
he is on notice that he must defend against any combina
tion of these factual elements which also is punishable.
One of the issues before us in this case is whether this is
the proper rule before the CJP, as well.
THE BURGLARY ANALOGY
Defense counsel make two basic arguments on this
issue. First, they argue that the original charge at issue
here, entering a room with intent to commit an offense
therein, is very much like the charges lodged in the local
courts for violation of the California burglary statute.
Since, under California law, burglary has no lesser
included offenses (except, of course, attempted bur
glary), defendant argues that the same rule should pre
vail before the CJP. In other words, since we are reason
ing by analogy here, defendant claims that the analogy
to the specific California burglary rule should prevail
before the CJP over the more general analogy to the
failure to prove an intent charged.
We do not find this argument persuasive. The reason
why the California burglary statute has no lesser
included offense is simply that the act of entering a
room or building is not illegal at all, unless it occurs
together with the forbidden intent. Hence, unless the
prosecution can show that intent, the defendant is guilty
of no wrongful conduct whatsoever. Interestingly, in
most states, where burglary requires a breaking and
entering as well as an intent, the crime does have a lesser
included offense, "breaking and entering." Here, where
entirely apart from any purpose to steal, the act of the
defendant, under the circumstances of this case, would
seem to us to be a clear violation of the Fundamental
Standard, the analogy to the California burglary statute
appears inapposite.

LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES
IN FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD CASES
The second contention of the defendant on this issue
is more troublesome The defendant would have us hold,
on much broader grounds, that the lesser included offen
se doctrine can never apply to Fundamental Standard
violations. Defense counsel contend that where the pros
ecution charges facts amounting to a Fundamental Stan
dard violation, but does not prove all of those facts, the
prosecution cannot prevail, even though the lesser facts
it has proven also amount to Fundamental Standard
violation.
THE PROBLEM OF SURPRISE
Defendant's argument is premised in part on the lact
that the Fundamental Standard is so broad that a defen

vulnerable to surprise at the hearing through the intro

uance is denied, the claim of prejudice due to lack of
notice is raisable before this Panel, as well.
Defendant's complaint as to the Fundamental Stan
dard, however, is broader than merely that its vagueness
offers insufficient protection against surprise at trial.
The defense's complaint is that uncertainty in exactly
what constitutes a Fundamental Standard violation
places the defense in jeopardy in other ways.
First of all, we should distinguish this argument from
another quite different one which sounds somewhat
similar. The defendant is not here contending that he
should be acquitted because the Fundamental Standard

To be sure, at its outer edges the Fundamental Standard

clear violation cannot raise the fact that others might
violate the Standard unwittingly. Indeed, the issue is not
whether the defendant knew his actions were in viola

should have known.
THE RIGHT NOT TO HELP THE PROSECUTION
However, it is in part because of the fact that a
student can be guilty of a Fundamental Standard viola
tion even though he believes he is correct and the com
munity judgment wrong, that we must pay particular
attention to defense counsel's argument on this issue.
The claim in essence is that the minimal limits of the
Fundamental Standard are so indefinite that a defendant
may be unable to meet a charge of Fundamental Stand

prove some lesser included offense.
It is not a complete answer to this to say that in order

In one situation, however, the defendant's fear of
helping the prosecution prove its case is entitled to
recognition. Our rules give a defendant a specific right
not to testify and we should give this right a broad
scope. Part of such a scope is to make sure that a
defendant, in exercising his right, fully appreciates the
consequences to himself. Accordingly, should a defen
dant admit at the hearing facts which he may not appre
ciate constitute a violation, he should be warned that
this is the case and be given an opportunity to withdraw
his statement before his conviction can be founded on
his testimony. If he does withdraw his admission and
does not within the scope of cross examination repeat it,
his statement may not be considered against him by the
hearing officer or this Panel.
This rule, however, is not determinative of this case.
The (act is that, rather than admitting the lesser included
offense alleged by the prosecutor here as a basis for
conviction, Mr. Ho denied that he had exerted any force
on the door.
THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE ALL FACTS
Another facet ot defendant's argument is also related
to the possibility of failure to appreciate facts showing a
Fundamental Standard violation. Defendant argues that

because a defendant and his counsel might not recognize
the significance of facts which amounted to a Funda
mental Standard violation, these facts might not be fully

might find untrae, misleading or incomplete facts. We
recognize this problem, but feel the solution is not to
prevent the finding of lesser included offenses in Funda
mental Standard cases. Rather, it is to give the defendant
full opportunity and notice to litigate any fact which
may be important to the disposition of his case-a mat
ter to which we will return shortly.
THE PLEADING REQUIREMENTS OF THE CJP
Finally, our decision that lesser included offenses can
be shown in Fundamental Standard cases is buttressed
by another consideration. The major operative effect of
accepting defendant's position would be to force the
prosecutor, in drafting his charges in the future, to join
all of the possible factual elements he thought he might
be able to prove, separately and in combination as sepa
rate charges. This would be complicated enough in sim
ple Fundamental Standard cases. It would be even more
so where Disruption charges and Fundamental Standard
violations are joined-as they might have been in this
case. Disruptions, most of which—when they are not
within a justification defense—are probably also Funda
mental Standard violations, can overlap in complex ways
with Fundamental Standard violations.
There is not sufficient reason to place such a burden
of drafting upon the prosecutor, especially since in those
jurisdictions which have attempted to guarantee com

come so prolix and confusing that they became an
obstruction to rational fact finding. Moreover, though
the vagueness of the Fundamental Standard may work

in attempting to learn with a high degree of precision the

it cannot even subpoena witnesses at trial). Moreover,
the prosecutor in the university system has no right to a
preliminary hearing which can permit the prosecutor in
the civil society to determine, to a much greater extent,
which facts he can and which he cannot prove at trial,
and hence to shape his charges better.
Indeed the issue of whether to allow lesser included
offenses in Fundamental Standard violations is only one
facet of a much larger problem—the purpose of the
charge in the CJP procedures. Although there are obvi
ously many analogies to the criminal law in our proce

pleading where the purpose of the charge is to specify
the general area for litigation while other devices are
relied upon to permit full and fair litigation of the facts.
In a civil case, it is quite common for one side or the
other to move at the end of trial to amend its pleadings
to conform to the evidence produced. This motion is
generally granted where no prejudice to the other party
is shown. Indeed, even in criminal cases prosecuted by
information (in which, as in the University, the prosecu
tor rather than a grand jury brings the charges) the
prosecutor may amend his pleading during trial to cover
any offense shown by the evidence.
It should be made clear that our view of the CJP
pleading requirements is as likely to benefit the defen
dant as the prosecutor. We must remember that the CJP
system recognizes within itself the concept of double
jeopardy and a defendant, once acquitted of a charge
before the CJP, cannot be retried on the same charge in
our system regardless of what new evidence of his guilt
the prosecutor can discover. Since that is the case, a
narrow construction of the charge will permit the prose
cutor to retry the defendant on a closely related but
different charge, while the view that the charge before us
is broader than that in the criminal law will more nar
rowly restrict the prosecutor in subsequent charges.
In the criminal system, the more narrowly defined
relationship between the words of the charge and the
crimes of which the defendant may be convicted can
have severe consequences to the defendant. In a criminal
case, where the defendant has burned down a building,
killing several of its occupants, the prosecutor can, in
almost all jurisdictions, convict him of one murder after
another based on the same fact situation, until the jury
returns the death sentence that the prosecutor desires.
Our rule prevents the vices of a narrow construction of
charges, and, if a consequence of preventing such abuse
is a broadening of the relation between the charge and
the evidence, we think that both in terms of fairness to
the defendant and accuracy in the fact-finding process, it
is the better choice.
THE REASON FOR REVERSAL
Our disagreement with the defendants on the allow
ance of lesser included offenses in Fundamental Stan
dard cases by no means settles this case, however. All we
have thus far held is that, if the hearing is a fair one, a
defendant charged with forcing one's way into a room
with a purpose to steal can be convicted of simply
forcing his way into the room-where the circumstances
are such that that act is also a violation of the Funda
mental Standard.
However, in this case, we feel that the hearing, insofar
as it purported to determine that Mr. Ho did in fact
force his way through the doors leading to the Faculty
Club kitchen, was not a fair one. We believe defense
counsels' assertions that, at the trial, they did not think

that Mr. Ho could be convicted of any lesser included
offense. It is likely, therefore that they did not attempt
fully to contest the facts which might support his con
viction on such an offense. Defense counsel claim, and
we believe, that they felt that they had the case won on
the issue of the defendant's purpose, and hence, that
they did not need to try very hard to show that the
defendant was not guilty of the other element charged—
forcing his way through the doors. Certainly, on this
record, we cannot assume that the defendants did not
have several witnesses whom they could have called to
raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the hearing
officer as to whether the defendant applied force to the
doors or aided or encouraged anyone else to do so.
In this case, we cannot say that the defense attorneys,
without the benefit of hindsight, were obviously wrong
on the rules as to lesser included offense in our system.
This is a new judicial system. It contains, inevitably,
many unclear points-at least until the Panel itself clari
fies them (and even then they become clear, not because
we are correct, but because it is our position in the
system to say what the rules should be). We note also
that even though we rule today that he had no such
duty, the prosecutor could in fact have obviated the
whole problem by additionally charging the forcing into
the kitchen as a separate offense or by joining a charge
of disruption along with that of the Fundamental Stan
dard violation. Moreover he could have simply stated
clearly his theory of the case to the defense counsel at
any point before the end of the hearing. Similarly,
though the hearing officer seems to have believed that
the lesser included offense doctrine was applicable in
this case, he, too, made no effort to make his opinion
clear to the defense.
THE POSSIBILITY OF A REMAND
Our decision that Mr. Ho cannot be convicted on this
record because of the possible prejudice to him in the
litigation of the facts, by no means determines the
disposition of this case The CJP procedures provide that
we may remand a case back to the hearing examiner for
additional findings should they be necessary, and cer
tainly this implies a right to remand the matter to him if
any of the findings which he actually made were not
properly litigated.
Indeed, this will be the proper course in most cases
assuming there are any such cases where the particular
facts and theories justifying conviction have not been
made clear to the defense during the hearing. The only
reason it cannot be done in the criminal courts is that
once the jury has rendered its verdict, the jurors cannot
be reassembled for further findings—both because of the
practical difficulties involved and because, in the inter
im, they may have been exposed to improper influences.
Interestingly enough, where a judge sits without a jury, a
procedure more analogous to ours, an appellate court
can return a case for further findings, or indeed, for the
reception of further evidence on the findings already
made.
This is the preferable means of disposition before the
CJP in any case where it is alleged that, for one reason or
another, there was not fair notice and that there was
such surprise to the defendants that they could not
properly litigate a question which turned out to be
important. This procedure protects the legitimate right
of the defendant to a proper and accurate finding of
fact; and insofar as a defendant may have been misled
into producing evidence, other than his own testimony,
which is in fact true, we do not regard this as a suffi
ciently unfortunate consequence of our decision to de
part from what, in every other way, is clearly the better
rule.
This is not to say that, in all cases, a difference
between the charge and the proof will make a remand to
the hearing officer the proper course. First, if the proof
bears absolutely no relation to the charge, the demands
of procedural regularity would require an acquittal of
the charge as the only proper course-leaving the prose
cutor to start all over again with the charge supported by
his evidence. Second, a remand may be prevented by a
showing or permanent prejudice to the defendant caused
by events subsequent to the surprise to him. If, for
instance, witnesses available-to the defendant at the first
hearing have, before a remand, disappeared or left the
area, the first issue may not be susceptible of fair litiga
tion, and a remand might not be proper.
THE REASONS FOR ACQUITTAL HERE
In the case at issue here, there is a very different, and
we trust quite unusual, reason not to remand the case to
the hearing officer. In this case, Mr. Ho has already
undergone eight hearings before the hearing examiner
and one before us. In another case involving an alleged
classroom disruption, he has undergone eleven hearings
before the hearing examiner and, so far as we can tell,
may have to endure another before us. Moreover, he has
recently been charged, together with nine others, with
disrupting a meeting of the Academic Council, a matter
which if our past experience is any guide, will consume a
great many hearings before the hearing examiner.
In this situation, a remand of this case to the hearing
examiner might well consume several more hearings at a
time when Mr. Ho was more than merely busy with
other cases against him. This would border upon harass
ment and our reluctance to inflict this upon Mr. Ho is
fortified by the fact that the remand would have been
necessitated without fault on his or his counsels' part,
and in a situation where the possibility of a remand to
the hearing examiner was, most likely, one which they
had never contemplated. Now that our procedures are
clearer in this matter, it is most unlikely that this parti
cular equity, presently working in Mr. Ho's behalf, will
occur again.
In any event, it is working in this particular case and
this is enough to make the difference. Accordingly, we
recommend that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case
be dropped.

For the reasons we state below at some length, we
feel that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case should be
dismissed. Under the circumstances of this case, Mr. Ho
cannot be convicted of the violation of the Fundamental
Standard found in the hearing examiner's report, and a
remand to the hearing examiner for the cure of the
defect in the hearing before him is, under the facts of
this case, not a fair alternative.
The defendant, Mr. Ho, was charged before the Cam
pus Judicial Panel by the University administration with
a violation of the Fundamental Standard in two particu
lars: that he committed an assault and that he "together
with others, forced his way into the kitchen of the
Stanford Faculty Club for the purpose of stealing food
from that kitchen." The hearing examiner acquitted Mr.
Ho of the first charge, the assault. As to the second
charge, the hearing examiner found, in essence, that
though Mr. Ho had no purpose to steal food from the
kitchen, he had nonetheless helped force his way into
the kitchen. The specific findings of the hearing exam
iner (with their contexts in brackets) are:
3. 1 find that Mr. Ho was informed by responsible
officials of the Faculty Club, whose position of re
sponsibility was known to him, that he was not
allowed in the rear of the Club. [Past the doors which
led to the kitchen]
4. I find that Mr. Ho by words and gestures, encour
aged the persons in the dining area to assist him in
gaining access to the hallway [on the other side of
the doors]
5. I find that the double doors leading to the hallway
were opened in response to physical force exerted by
Mr. Ho and others, [and against the resistance of two
faculty club employees]
In short, Mr. Ho was found to have forced his way into
an area where he had been told by legitimate authority
that he had no business.
No justification for Mr. Ho's acts appearing, we have
no doubt that the hearing examiner's report makes out
what, at least in our opinion, is a clear violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The issue before us, however, is
not whether Mr. Ho is guilty, but whether he has been
properly and fairly found guilty under our procedures.
LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES IN GENERAL
The threshold issue in the determination of this case
is whether the Fundamental Standard violation proven
against Mr. Ho is one of which he could be convicted,
despite the failure of the prosecution to prove its allega
tion that Mr. Ho had committed his act with a purpose
to steal food. If it was not, we need proceed no further.
The prosecution alleges that defendant was properly
convicted under a "lesser included offense" theory. It is,
indeed, a general principle of law in criminal prosecu
tions that, if the prosecution charges that the defendant
did act A with an intent to accomplish Band the
prosecution proves that the defendant did act A but
cannot meet its burden of proof on the defendant's
intent to do B, the defendant may nonetheless be con
victed of doing act A-if that act is also, in itself, an
offense. Thus, if a defendant is charged with assault with
intent to kill and the prosecution cannot sustain its
burden as to the intent, the defendant may nonetheless
be convicted of the lesser included offense of assault
assuming, of course, that assault is an offense within the
legal system in question.
Indeed, the principle covers more than simply cases
where the prosecution is unable to prove an intent it has
charged. A defendant may be convicted of assault where
the prosecution has charged him with assault with a
deadly weapon. And if a defendant is charged with
drunken driving but the prosecution cannot prove that
he was actually driving, (either because he might have
been merely a passenger or because the car might have
been motionless) the defendant may, nonetheless, be
convicted of being drunk in an automobile-assuming, of
course, that under the law of that jurisdiction, (as is the
case in California), being drunk in an automobile is also
a punishable offense.
In short, in the criminal system at large, where a
defendant is charged with all the elements of an offense,
he is on notice that he must defend against any combina
tion of these factual elements which also is punishable.
One of the issues before us in this case is whether this is
the proper rule before the CJP, as well.
THE BURGLARY ANALOGY
Defense counsel make two basic arguments on this
issue. First, they argue that the original charge at issue
here, entering a room with intent to commit an offense
therein, is very much like the charges lodged in the local
courts for violation of the California burglary statute.
Since, under California law, burglary has no lesser
included offenses (except, of course, attempted bur
glary), defendant argues that the same rule should pre
vail before the CJP. In other words, since we are reason
ing by analogy here, defendant claims that the analogy
to the specific California burglary rule should prevail
before the CJP over the more general analogy to the
failure to prove an intent charged.
We do not find this argument persuasive. The reason
why the California burglary statute has no lesser
included offense is simply that the act of entering a
room or building is not illegal at all, unless it occurs
together with the forbidden intent. Hence, unless the
prosecution can show that intent, the defendant is guilty
of no wrongful conduct whatsoever. Interestingly, in
most states, where burglary requires a breaking and
entering as well as an intent, the crime does have a lesser
included offense, "breaking and entering." Here, where
entirely apart from any purpose to steal, the act of the
defendant, under the circumstances of this case, would
seem to us to be a clear violation of the Fundamental
Standard, the analogy to the California burglary statute
appears inapposite.

LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES
IN FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD CASES
The second contention of the defendant on this issue
is more troublesome The defendant would have us hold,
on much broader grounds, that the lesser included offen
se doctrine can never apply to Fundamental Standard
violations. Defense counsel contend that where the pros
ecution charges facts amounting to a Fundamental Stan
dard violation, but does not prove all of those facts, the
prosecution cannot prevail, even though the lesser facts
it has proven also amount to Fundamental Standard
violation.
THE PROBLEM OF SURPRISE
Defendant's argument is premised in part on the lact
that the Fundamental Standard is so broad that a defen
dant attempting to meet a charge of its violation is
vulnerable to surprise at the hearing through the intro
duction of facts and issues he is unprepared to meet.
Defendant recognizes, as he must, that no frontal attack
upon the Fundamental Standard is possible. After all, it
has been a part of University law since the time of David
Starr Jordan. The defense earnestly contends, however,
that the allowance of a lesser included offense within a
Fundamental Standard charge compounds unduly what
is a built-in problem in the administration of such a
broad rule.
This facet of the defense argument is considerably
weakened by the alternative remedy available to defen
dants under the CJP procedures. Indeed, the CJP proce
dures can be far better adapted to protecting a defen
dant against surprise than can those of the outside soci
ety. In the criminal trial, a defendant who is surprised by
the prosecution's introduction of an issue cannot have
the jury kept together for an appreciable time while he
attempts to find new evidence to meet the prosecution's
evidence. Under the CJP system, the remedy to avoid
any surprise is simply the right of the party to ask the
hearing officer for sufficient time to produce his evi
dence. We cannot conceive of any reasonable continu
ance being denied by a hearing officer in a situation
where a claim of surprise or lack of notice is made in
good faith. And, if such a request for reasonable contin
uance is denied, the claim of prejudice due to lack of
notice is raisable before this Panel, as well.
Defendant's complaint as to the Fundamental Stan
dard, however, is broader than merely that its vagueness
offers insufficient protection against surprise at trial.
The defense's complaint is that uncertainty in exactly
what constitutes a Fundamental Standard violation
places the defense in jeopardy in other ways.
First of all, we should distinguish this argument from
another quite different one which sounds somewhat
similar. The defendant is not here contending that he
should be acquitted because the Fundamental Standard
is so vague that he did not know that what he was doing
in the Faculty Club was in violation of University law.
To be sure, at its outer edges the Fundamental Standard
is extremely murky, but a defendant whose acts are a
clear violation cannot raise the fact that others might
violate the Standard unwittingly. Indeed, the issue is not
whether the defendant knew his actions were in viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard, but whether he
should have known.
THE RIGHT NOT TO HELP THE PROSECUTION
However, it is in part because of the fact that a
student can be guilty of a Fundamental Standard viola
tion even though he believes he is correct and the com
munity judgment wrong, that we must pay particular
attention to defense counsel's argument on this issue.
The claim in essence is that the minimal limits of the
Fundamental Standard are so indefinite that a defendant
may be unable to meet a charge of Fundamental Stand
ard violation without, perhaps, helping the prosecution
prove some lesser included offense.
It is not a complete answer to this to say that in order
for discipline to be imposed, the Fundamental Standard
violation must be clear to us. It is quite conceivable that
a defense attorney, with values similar to those of his
client, might not appreciate that certain actions did
constitute a Fundamental Standard violation clear to the
rest of the community. In such a case, he might indeed
unwittingly help the prosecution prove its case.
For the most part, however, we do not apprehend
that this difficulty faced by a defendant is a sympathetic
one considering the structure of our proceedings and the
protections the defendant does have. The basic purpose
of the hearing before the examiner is to find out the
facts—who did what, when and where, with what state
of mind. Certainly, the hearing examiner must perform
his function in a way fair to the defendant and giving
full effect to any specific rights provided by our rules.
The hearing before the hearing examiner, however, is not
a game. The defendant certainly has the right to put the
prosecution to its proof, but if he helps prow the facts
which actually exist, we cannot regard this as a disadvan
tage of the CJP procedures.
In one situation, however, the defendant's fear of
helping the prosecution prove its case is entitled to
recognition. Our rules give a defendant a specific right
not to testify and we should give this right a broad
scope. Part of such a scope is to make sure that a
defendant, in exercising his right, fully appreciates the
consequences to himself. Accordingly, should a defen
dant admit at the hearing facts which he may not appre
ciate constitute a violation, he should be warned that
this is the case and be given an opportunity to withdraw
his statement before his conviction can be founded on
his testimony. If he does withdraw his admission and
does not within the scope of cross examination repeat it,
his statement may not be considered against him by the
hearing officer or this Panel.
This rule, however, is not determinative of this case.
The (act is that, rather than admitting the lesser included
offense alleged by the prosecutor here as a basis for
conviction, Mr. Ho denied that he had exerted any force
on the door.
THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE ALL FACTS
Another facet ot defendant's argument is also related
to the possibility of failure to appreciate facts showing a
Fundamental Standard violation. Defendant argues that

because a defendant and his counsel might not recognize
the significance of facts which amounted to a Funda
mental Standard violation, these facts might not be fully
and tairly litigatej. As a result, the hearing examiner
might find untrae, misleading or incomplete facts. We
recognize this problem, but feel the solution is not to
prevent the finding of lesser included offenses in Funda
mental Standard cases. Rather, it is to give the defendant
full opportunity and notice to litigate any fact which
may be important to the disposition of his case-a mat
ter to which we will return shortly.
THE PLEADING REQUIREMENTS OF THE CJP
Finally, our decision that lesser included offenses can
be shown in Fundamental Standard cases is buttressed
by another consideration. The major operative effect of
accepting defendant's position would be to force the
prosecutor, in drafting his charges in the future, to join
all of the possible factual elements he thought he might
be able to prove, separately and in combination as sepa
rate charges. This would be complicated enough in sim
ple Fundamental Standard cases. It would be even more
so where Disruption charges and Fundamental Standard
violations are joined-as they might have been in this
case. Disruptions, most of which—when they are not
within a justification defense—are probably also Funda
mental Standard violations, can overlap in complex ways
with Fundamental Standard violations.
There is not sufficient reason to place such a burden
of drafting upon the prosecutor, especially since in those
jurisdictions which have attempted to guarantee com
plete notice through pleading, the pleadings have be
come so prolix and confusing that they became an
obstruction to rational fact finding. Moreover, though
the vagueness of the Fundamental Standard may work
against the defense, the lack of weaponry given to the
prosecutor in our system works against him even more,
in attempting to learn with a high degree of precision the
facts of the events leading to his charge. Unlike the
prosecutor in the civil courts, the University administra
tion has no equivalent of a grand jury subpoena (indeed
it cannot even subpoena witnesses at trial). Moreover,
the prosecutor in the university system has no right to a
preliminary hearing which can permit the prosecutor in
the civil society to determine, to a much greater extent,
which facts he can and which he cannot prove at trial,
and hence to shape his charges better.
Indeed the issue of whether to allow lesser included
offenses in Fundamental Standard violations is only one
facet of a much larger problem—the purpose of the
charge in the CJP procedures. Although there are obvi
ously many analogies to the criminal law in our proce
dures—most obviously the requirement of a reasonable
doubt standard—these are not criminal cases. This is
made clear by the relatively limited nature of our sanc
tions, which-though we regard them as quite severe—are
hardly equal to those of the criminal courts; the fact
that consequences and procedures similar to ours are
used in obviously civil cases such as those involving
industrial relations and faculty discipline; and the prin
ciple that the major purpose of society is, in a sense to
enforce its law, while the major purposes for which the
University exists, and which control its allocations of
resources, are education and the advancement of know
ledge.
The purpose of the charge in our system is analogous
to that under the more modern civil rules. It is not what
is called "fact" or "issue" pleading, but is "notice"
pleading where the purpose of the charge is to specify
the general area for litigation while other devices are
relied upon to permit full and fair litigation of the facts.
In a civil case, it is quite common for one side or the
other to move at the end of trial to amend its pleadings
to conform to the evidence produced. This motion is
generally granted where no prejudice to the other party
is shown. Indeed, even in criminal cases prosecuted by
information (in which, as in the University, the prosecu
tor rather than a grand jury brings the charges) the
prosecutor may amend his pleading during trial to cover
any offense shown by the evidence.
It should be made clear that our view of the CJP
pleading requirements is as likely to benefit the defen
dant as the prosecutor. We must remember that the CJP
system recognizes within itself the concept of double
jeopardy and a defendant, once acquitted of a charge
before the CJP, cannot be retried on the same charge in
our system regardless of what new evidence of his guilt
the prosecutor can discover. Since that is the case, a
narrow construction of the charge will permit the prose
cutor to retry the defendant on a closely related but
different charge, while the view that the charge before us
is broader than that in the criminal law will more nar
rowly restrict the prosecutor in subsequent charges.
In the criminal system, the more narrowly defined
relationship between the words of the charge and the
crimes of which the defendant may be convicted can
have severe consequences to the defendant. In a criminal
case, where the defendant has burned down a building,
killing several of its occupants, the prosecutor can, in
almost all jurisdictions, convict him of one murder after
another based on the same fact situation, until the jury
returns the death sentence that the prosecutor desires.
Our rule prevents the vices of a narrow construction of
charges, and, if a consequence of preventing such abuse
is a broadening of the relation between the charge and
the evidence, we think that both in terms of fairness to
the defendant and accuracy in the fact-finding process, it
is the better choice.
THE REASON FOR REVERSAL
Our disagreement with the defendants on the allow
ance of lesser included offenses in Fundamental Stan
dard cases by no means settles this case, however. All we
have thus far held is that, if the hearing is a fair one, a
defendant charged with forcing one's way into a room
with a purpose to steal can be convicted of simply
forcing his way into the room-where the circumstances
are such that that act is also a violation of the Funda
mental Standard.
However, in this case, we feel that the hearing, insofar
as it purported to determine that Mr. Ho did in fact
force his way through the doors leading to the Faculty
Club kitchen, was not a fair one. We believe defense
counsels' assertions that, at the trial, they did not think

that Mr. Ho could be convicted of any lesser included
offense. It is likely, therefore that they did not attempt
fully to contest the facts which might support his con
viction on such an offense. Defense counsel claim, and
we believe, that they felt that they had the case won on
the issue of the defendant's purpose, and hence, that
they did not need to try very hard to show that the
defendant was not guilty of the other element charged—
forcing his way through the doors. Certainly, on this
record, we cannot assume that the defendants did not
have several witnesses whom they could have called to
raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the hearing
officer as to whether the defendant applied force to the
doors or aided or encouraged anyone else to do so.
In this case, we cannot say that the defense attorneys,
without the benefit of hindsight, were obviously wrong
on the rules as to lesser included offense in our system.
This is a new judicial system. It contains, inevitably,
many unclear points-at least until the Panel itself clari
fies them (and even then they become clear, not because
we are correct, but because it is our position in the
system to say what the rules should be). We note also
that even though we rule today that he had no such
duty, the prosecutor could in fact have obviated the
whole problem by additionally charging the forcing into
the kitchen as a separate offense or by joining a charge
of disruption along with that of the Fundamental Stan
dard violation. Moreover he could have simply stated
clearly his theory of the case to the defense counsel at
any point before the end of the hearing. Similarly,
though the hearing officer seems to have believed that
the lesser included offense doctrine was applicable in
this case, he, too, made no effort to make his opinion
clear to the defense.
THE POSSIBILITY OF A REMAND
Our decision that Mr. Ho cannot be convicted on this
record because of the possible prejudice to him in the
litigation of the facts, by no means determines the
disposition of this case The CJP procedures provide that
we may remand a case back to the hearing examiner for
additional findings should they be necessary, and cer
tainly this implies a right to remand the matter to him if
any of the findings which he actually made were not
properly litigated.
Indeed, this will be the proper course in most cases
assuming there are any such cases where the particular
facts and theories justifying conviction have not been
made clear to the defense during the hearing. The only
reason it cannot be done in the criminal courts is that
once the jury has rendered its verdict, the jurors cannot
be reassembled for further findings—both because of the
practical difficulties involved and because, in the inter
im, they may have been exposed to improper influences.
Interestingly enough, where a judge sits without a jury, a
procedure more analogous to ours, an appellate court
can return a case for further findings, or indeed, for the
reception of further evidence on the findings already
made.
This is the preferable means of disposition before the
CJP in any case where it is alleged that, for one reason or
another, there was not fair notice and that there was
such surprise to the defendants that they could not
properly litigate a question which turned out to be
important. This procedure protects the legitimate right
of the defendant to a proper and accurate finding of
fact; and insofar as a defendant may have been misled
into producing evidence, other than his own testimony,
which is in fact true, we do not regard this as a suffi
ciently unfortunate consequence of our decision to de
part from what, in every other way, is clearly the better
rule.
This is not to say that, in all cases, a difference
between the charge and the proof will make a remand to
the hearing officer the proper course. First, if the proof
bears absolutely no relation to the charge, the demands
of procedural regularity would require an acquittal of
the charge as the only proper course-leaving the prose
cutor to start all over again with the charge supported by
his evidence. Second, a remand may be prevented by a
showing or permanent prejudice to the defendant caused
by events subsequent to the surprise to him. If, for
instance, witnesses available-to the defendant at the first
hearing have, before a remand, disappeared or left the
area, the first issue may not be susceptible of fair litiga
tion, and a remand might not be proper.
THE REASONS FOR ACQUITTAL HERE
In the case at issue here, there is a very different, and
we trust quite unusual, reason not to remand the case to
the hearing officer. In this case, Mr. Ho has already
undergone eight hearings before the hearing examiner
and one before us. In another case involving an alleged
classroom disruption, he has undergone eleven hearings
before the hearing examiner and, so far as we can tell,
may have to endure another before us. Moreover, he has
recently been charged, together with nine others, with
disrupting a meeting of the Academic Council, a matter
which if our past experience is any guide, will consume a
great many hearings before the hearing examiner.
In this situation, a remand of this case to the hearing
examiner might well consume several more hearings at a
time when Mr. Ho was more than merely busy with
other cases against him. This would border upon harass
ment and our reluctance to inflict this upon Mr. Ho is
fortified by the fact that the remand would have been
necessitated without fault on his or his counsels' part,
and in a situation where the possibility of a remand to
the hearing examiner was, most likely, one which they
had never contemplated. Now that our procedures are
clearer in this matter, it is most unlikely that this parti
cular equity, presently working in Mr. Ho's behalf, will
occur again.
In any event, it is working in this particular case and
this is enough to make the difference. Accordingly, we
recommend that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case
be dropped.

For the reasons we state below at some length, we
feel that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case should be
dismissed. Under the circumstances of this case, Mr. Ho
cannot be convicted of the violation of the Fundamental
Standard found in the hearing examiner's report, and a
remand to the hearing examiner for the cure of the

the kitchen. The specific findings of the hearing exam
iner (with their contexts in brackets) are:
3. 1 find that Mr. Ho was informed by responsible
officials of the Faculty Club, whose position of re
sponsibility was known to him, that he was not
allowed in the rear of the Club. [Past the doors which
led to the kitchen]
4. I find that Mr. Ho by words and gestures, encour
aged the persons in the dining area to assist him in
gaining access to the hallway [on the other side of
the doors]
5. I find that the double doors leading to the hallway
were opened in response to physical force exerted by
Mr. Ho and others, [and against the resistance of two
faculty club employees]
In short, Mr. Ho was found to have forced his way into
an area where he had been told by legitimate authority
that he had no business.
No justification for Mr. Ho's acts appearing, we have
no doubt that the hearing examiner's report makes out
what, at least in our opinion, is a clear violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The issue before us, however, is
not whether Mr. Ho is guilty, but whether he has been
properly and fairly found guilty under our procedures.
LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES IN GENERAL
The threshold issue in the determination of this case
is whether the Fundamental Standard violation proven
against Mr. Ho is one of which he could be convicted,
despite the failure of the prosecution to prove its allega
tion that Mr. Ho had committed his act with a purpose
to steal food. If it was not, we need proceed no further.
The prosecution alleges that defendant was properly
convicted under a "lesser included offense" theory. It is,
indeed, a general principle of law in criminal prosecu
tions that, if the prosecution charges that the defendant
did act A with an intent to accomplish Band the
prosecution proves that the defendant did act A but
cannot meet its burden of proof on the defendant's
intent to do B, the defendant may nonetheless be con
victed of doing act A-if that act is also, in itself, an
offense. Thus, if a defendant is charged with assault with
intent to kill and the prosecution cannot sustain its
burden as to the intent, the defendant may nonetheless
be convicted of the lesser included offense of assault
assuming, of course, that assault is an offense within the
legal system in question.
Indeed, the principle covers more than simply cases
where the prosecution is unable to prove an intent it has
charged. A defendant may be convicted of assault where
the prosecution has charged him with assault with a
deadly weapon. And if a defendant is charged with
drunken driving but the prosecution cannot prove that
he was actually driving, (either because he might have
been merely a passenger or because the car might have
been motionless) the defendant may, nonetheless, be
convicted of being drunk in an automobile-assuming, of
course, that under the law of that jurisdiction, (as is the
case in California), being drunk in an automobile is also
a punishable offense.
In short, in the criminal system at large, where a
defendant is charged with all the elements of an offense,
he is on notice that he must defend against any combina
tion of these factual elements which also is punishable.
One of the issues before us in this case is whether this is
the proper rule before the CJP, as well.
THE BURGLARY ANALOGY
Defense counsel make two basic arguments on this
issue. First, they argue that the original charge at issue
here, entering a room with intent to commit an offense
therein, is very much like the charges lodged in the local
courts for violation of the California burglary statute.
Since, under California law, burglary has no lesser
included offenses (except, of course, attempted bur
glary), defendant argues that the same rule should pre
vail before the CJP. In other words, since we are reason
ing by analogy here, defendant claims that the analogy
to the specific California burglary rule should prevail
before the CJP over the more general analogy to the
failure to prove an intent charged.
We do not find this argument persuasive. The reason
why the California burglary statute has no lesser
included offense is simply that the act of entering a
room or building is not illegal at all, unless it occurs
together with the forbidden intent. Hence, unless the
prosecution can show that intent, the defendant is guilty
of no wrongful conduct whatsoever. Interestingly, in
most states, where burglary requires a breaking and
entering as well as an intent, the crime does have a lesser
included offense, "breaking and entering." Here, where
entirely apart from any purpose to steal, the act of the
defendant, under the circumstances of this case, would
seem to us to be a clear violation of the Fundamental
Standard, the analogy to the California burglary statute
appears inapposite.

LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES
IN FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD CASES
The second contention of the defendant on this issue
is more troublesome The defendant would have us hold,
on much broader grounds, that the lesser included offen
se doctrine can never apply to Fundamental Standard
violations. Defense counsel contend that where the pros
ecution charges facts amounting to a Fundamental Stan
dard violation, but does not prove all of those facts, the
prosecution cannot prevail, even though the lesser facts
it has proven also amount to Fundamental Standard
violation.
THE PROBLEM OF SURPRISE
Defendant's argument is premised in part on the lact
that the Fundamental Standard is so broad that a defen
dant attempting to meet a charge of its violation is
vulnerable to surprise at the hearing through the intro
duction of facts and issues he is unprepared to meet.
Defendant recognizes, as he must, that no frontal attack
upon the Fundamental Standard is possible. After all, it
has been a part of University law since the time of David
Starr Jordan. The defense earnestly contends, however,
that the allowance of a lesser included offense within a
Fundamental Standard charge compounds unduly what
is a built-in problem in the administration of such a
broad rule.
This facet of the defense argument is considerably
weakened by the alternative remedy available to defen
dants under the CJP procedures. Indeed, the CJP proce
dures can be far better adapted to protecting a defen
dant against surprise than can those of the outside soci
ety. In the criminal trial, a defendant who is surprised by
the prosecution's introduction of an issue cannot have
the jury kept together for an appreciable time while he
attempts to find new evidence to meet the prosecution's
evidence. Under the CJP system, the remedy to avoid
any surprise is simply the right of the party to ask the
hearing officer for sufficient time to produce his evi
dence. We cannot conceive of any reasonable continu
ance being denied by a hearing officer in a situation
where a claim of surprise or lack of notice is made in
good faith. And, if such a request for reasonable contin
uance is denied, the claim of prejudice due to lack of
notice is raisable before this Panel, as well.
Defendant's complaint as to the Fundamental Stan
dard, however, is broader than merely that its vagueness
offers insufficient protection against surprise at trial.
The defense's complaint is that uncertainty in exactly
what constitutes a Fundamental Standard violation
places the defense in jeopardy in other ways.
First of all, we should distinguish this argument from
another quite different one which sounds somewhat
similar. The defendant is not here contending that he
should be acquitted because the Fundamental Standard
is so vague that he did not know that what he was doing
in the Faculty Club was in violation of University law.
To be sure, at its outer edges the Fundamental Standard
is extremely murky, but a defendant whose acts are a
clear violation cannot raise the fact that others might
violate the Standard unwittingly. Indeed, the issue is not
whether the defendant knew his actions were in viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard, but whether he
should have known.
THE RIGHT NOT TO HELP THE PROSECUTION
However, it is in part because of the fact that a
student can be guilty of a Fundamental Standard viola
tion even though he believes he is correct and the com
munity judgment wrong, that we must pay particular
attention to defense counsel's argument on this issue.
The claim in essence is that the minimal limits of the
Fundamental Standard are so indefinite that a defendant
may be unable to meet a charge of Fundamental Stand
ard violation without, perhaps, helping the prosecution
prove some lesser included offense.
It is not a complete answer to this to say that in order
for discipline to be imposed, the Fundamental Standard
violation must be clear to us. It is quite conceivable that
a defense attorney, with values similar to those of his
client, might not appreciate that certain actions did
constitute a Fundamental Standard violation clear to the
rest of the community. In such a case, he might indeed
unwittingly help the prosecution prove its case.
For the most part, however, we do not apprehend
that this difficulty faced by a defendant is a sympathetic
one considering the structure of our proceedings and the
protections the defendant does have. The basic purpose
of the hearing before the examiner is to find out the
facts—who did what, when and where, with what state
of mind. Certainly, the hearing examiner must perform
his function in a way fair to the defendant and giving
full effect to any specific rights provided by our rules.
The hearing before the hearing examiner, however, is not
a game. The defendant certainly has the right to put the
prosecution to its proof, but if he helps prow the facts
which actually exist, we cannot regard this as a disadvan
tage of the CJP procedures.
In one situation, however, the defendant's fear of
helping the prosecution prove its case is entitled to
recognition. Our rules give a defendant a specific right
not to testify and we should give this right a broad
scope. Part of such a scope is to make sure that a
defendant, in exercising his right, fully appreciates the
consequences to himself. Accordingly, should a defen
dant admit at the hearing facts which he may not appre
ciate constitute a violation, he should be warned that
this is the case and be given an opportunity to withdraw
his statement before his conviction can be founded on
his testimony. If he does withdraw his admission and
does not within the scope of cross examination repeat it,
his statement may not be considered against him by the
hearing officer or this Panel.
This rule, however, is not determinative of this case.
The (act is that, rather than admitting the lesser included
offense alleged by the prosecutor here as a basis for
conviction, Mr. Ho denied that he had exerted any force
on the door.
THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE ALL FACTS
Another facet ot defendant's argument is also related
to the possibility of failure to appreciate facts showing a
Fundamental Standard violation. Defendant argues that

because a defendant and his counsel might not recognize
the significance of facts which amounted to a Funda
mental Standard violation, these facts might not be fully
and tairly litigatej. As a result, the hearing examiner
might find untrae, misleading or incomplete facts. We
recognize this problem, but feel the solution is not to
prevent the finding of lesser included offenses in Funda
mental Standard cases. Rather, it is to give the defendant
full opportunity and notice to litigate any fact which
may be important to the disposition of his case-a mat
ter to which we will return shortly.
THE PLEADING REQUIREMENTS OF THE CJP
Finally, our decision that lesser included offenses can
be shown in Fundamental Standard cases is buttressed
by another consideration. The major operative effect of
accepting defendant's position would be to force the
prosecutor, in drafting his charges in the future, to join
all of the possible factual elements he thought he might
be able to prove, separately and in combination as sepa
rate charges. This would be complicated enough in sim
ple Fundamental Standard cases. It would be even more
so where Disruption charges and Fundamental Standard
violations are joined-as they might have been in this
case. Disruptions, most of which—when they are not
within a justification defense—are probably also Funda
mental Standard violations, can overlap in complex ways
with Fundamental Standard violations.
There is not sufficient reason to place such a burden
of drafting upon the prosecutor, especially since in those
jurisdictions which have attempted to guarantee com
plete notice through pleading, the pleadings have be
come so prolix and confusing that they became an
obstruction to rational fact finding. Moreover, though
the vagueness of the Fundamental Standard may work
against the defense, the lack of weaponry given to the
prosecutor in our system works against him even more,
in attempting to learn with a high degree of precision the
facts of the events leading to his charge. Unlike the
prosecutor in the civil courts, the University administra
tion has no equivalent of a grand jury subpoena (indeed
it cannot even subpoena witnesses at trial). Moreover,
the prosecutor in the university system has no right to a
preliminary hearing which can permit the prosecutor in
the civil society to determine, to a much greater extent,
which facts he can and which he cannot prove at trial,
and hence to shape his charges better.
Indeed the issue of whether to allow lesser included
offenses in Fundamental Standard violations is only one
facet of a much larger problem—the purpose of the
charge in the CJP procedures. Although there are obvi
ously many analogies to the criminal law in our proce
dures—most obviously the requirement of a reasonable
doubt standard—these are not criminal cases. This is
made clear by the relatively limited nature of our sanc
tions, which-though we regard them as quite severe—are
hardly equal to those of the criminal courts; the fact
that consequences and procedures similar to ours are
used in obviously civil cases such as those involving
industrial relations and faculty discipline; and the prin
ciple that the major purpose of society is, in a sense to
enforce its law, while the major purposes for which the
University exists, and which control its allocations of
resources, are education and the advancement of know
ledge.
The purpose of the charge in our system is analogous
to that under the more modern civil rules. It is not what
is called "fact" or "issue" pleading, but is "notice"
pleading where the purpose of the charge is to specify
the general area for litigation while other devices are
relied upon to permit full and fair litigation of the facts.
In a civil case, it is quite common for one side or the
other to move at the end of trial to amend its pleadings
to conform to the evidence produced. This motion is
generally granted where no prejudice to the other party
is shown. Indeed, even in criminal cases prosecuted by
information (in which, as in the University, the prosecu
tor rather than a grand jury brings the charges) the
prosecutor may amend his pleading during trial to cover
any offense shown by the evidence.
It should be made clear that our view of the CJP
pleading requirements is as likely to benefit the defen
dant as the prosecutor. We must remember that the CJP
system recognizes within itself the concept of double
jeopardy and a defendant, once acquitted of a charge
before the CJP, cannot be retried on the same charge in
our system regardless of what new evidence of his guilt
the prosecutor can discover. Since that is the case, a
narrow construction of the charge will permit the prose
cutor to retry the defendant on a closely related but
different charge, while the view that the charge before us
is broader than that in the criminal law will more nar
rowly restrict the prosecutor in subsequent charges.
In the criminal system, the more narrowly defined
relationship between the words of the charge and the
crimes of which the defendant may be convicted can
have severe consequences to the defendant. In a criminal
case, where the defendant has burned down a building,
killing several of its occupants, the prosecutor can, in
almost all jurisdictions, convict him of one murder after
another based on the same fact situation, until the jury
returns the death sentence that the prosecutor desires.
Our rule prevents the vices of a narrow construction of
charges, and, if a consequence of preventing such abuse
is a broadening of the relation between the charge and
the evidence, we think that both in terms of fairness to
the defendant and accuracy in the fact-finding process, it
is the better choice.
THE REASON FOR REVERSAL
Our disagreement with the defendants on the allow
ance of lesser included offenses in Fundamental Stan
dard cases by no means settles this case, however. All we
have thus far held is that, if the hearing is a fair one, a
defendant charged with forcing one's way into a room
with a purpose to steal can be convicted of simply
forcing his way into the room-where the circumstances
are such that that act is also a violation of the Funda
mental Standard.
However, in this case, we feel that the hearing, insofar
as it purported to determine that Mr. Ho did in fact
force his way through the doors leading to the Faculty
Club kitchen, was not a fair one. We believe defense
counsels' assertions that, at the trial, they did not think

that Mr. Ho could be convicted of any lesser included
offense. It is likely, therefore that they did not attempt
fully to contest the facts which might support his con
viction on such an offense. Defense counsel claim, and
we believe, that they felt that they had the case won on
the issue of the defendant's purpose, and hence, that
they did not need to try very hard to show that the
defendant was not guilty of the other element charged—
forcing his way through the doors. Certainly, on this
record, we cannot assume that the defendants did not
have several witnesses whom they could have called to
raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the hearing
officer as to whether the defendant applied force to the
doors or aided or encouraged anyone else to do so.
In this case, we cannot say that the defense attorneys,
without the benefit of hindsight, were obviously wrong
on the rules as to lesser included offense in our system.
This is a new judicial system. It contains, inevitably,
many unclear points-at least until the Panel itself clari
fies them (and even then they become clear, not because
we are correct, but because it is our position in the
system to say what the rules should be). We note also
that even though we rule today that he had no such
duty, the prosecutor could in fact have obviated the
whole problem by additionally charging the forcing into
the kitchen as a separate offense or by joining a charge
of disruption along with that of the Fundamental Stan
dard violation. Moreover he could have simply stated
clearly his theory of the case to the defense counsel at
any point before the end of the hearing. Similarly,
though the hearing officer seems to have believed that
the lesser included offense doctrine was applicable in
this case, he, too, made no effort to make his opinion
clear to the defense.
THE POSSIBILITY OF A REMAND
Our decision that Mr. Ho cannot be convicted on this
record because of the possible prejudice to him in the
litigation of the facts, by no means determines the
disposition of this case The CJP procedures provide that
we may remand a case back to the hearing examiner for
additional findings should they be necessary, and cer
tainly this implies a right to remand the matter to him if
any of the findings which he actually made were not
properly litigated.
Indeed, this will be the proper course in most cases
assuming there are any such cases where the particular
facts and theories justifying conviction have not been
made clear to the defense during the hearing. The only
reason it cannot be done in the criminal courts is that
once the jury has rendered its verdict, the jurors cannot
be reassembled for further findings—both because of the
practical difficulties involved and because, in the inter
im, they may have been exposed to improper influences.
Interestingly enough, where a judge sits without a jury, a
procedure more analogous to ours, an appellate court
can return a case for further findings, or indeed, for the
reception of further evidence on the findings already
made.
This is the preferable means of disposition before the
CJP in any case where it is alleged that, for one reason or
another, there was not fair notice and that there was
such surprise to the defendants that they could not
properly litigate a question which turned out to be
important. This procedure protects the legitimate right
of the defendant to a proper and accurate finding of
fact; and insofar as a defendant may have been misled
into producing evidence, other than his own testimony,
which is in fact true, we do not regard this as a suffi
ciently unfortunate consequence of our decision to de
part from what, in every other way, is clearly the better
rule.
This is not to say that, in all cases, a difference
between the charge and the proof will make a remand to
the hearing officer the proper course. First, if the proof
bears absolutely no relation to the charge, the demands
of procedural regularity would require an acquittal of
the charge as the only proper course-leaving the prose
cutor to start all over again with the charge supported by
his evidence. Second, a remand may be prevented by a
showing or permanent prejudice to the defendant caused
by events subsequent to the surprise to him. If, for
instance, witnesses available-to the defendant at the first
hearing have, before a remand, disappeared or left the
area, the first issue may not be susceptible of fair litiga
tion, and a remand might not be proper.
THE REASONS FOR ACQUITTAL HERE
In the case at issue here, there is a very different, and
we trust quite unusual, reason not to remand the case to
the hearing officer. In this case, Mr. Ho has already
undergone eight hearings before the hearing examiner
and one before us. In another case involving an alleged
classroom disruption, he has undergone eleven hearings
before the hearing examiner and, so far as we can tell,
may have to endure another before us. Moreover, he has
recently been charged, together with nine others, with
disrupting a meeting of the Academic Council, a matter
which if our past experience is any guide, will consume a
great many hearings before the hearing examiner.
In this situation, a remand of this case to the hearing
examiner might well consume several more hearings at a
time when Mr. Ho was more than merely busy with
other cases against him. This would border upon harass
ment and our reluctance to inflict this upon Mr. Ho is
fortified by the fact that the remand would have been
necessitated without fault on his or his counsels' part,
and in a situation where the possibility of a remand to
the hearing examiner was, most likely, one which they
had never contemplated. Now that our procedures are
clearer in this matter, it is most unlikely that this parti
cular equity, presently working in Mr. Ho's behalf, will
occur again.
In any event, it is working in this particular case and
this is enough to make the difference. Accordingly, we
recommend that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case
be dropped.

Robert L. White
For the reasons we state below at some length, we
feel that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case should be
dismissed. Under the circumstances of this case, Mr. Ho
cannot be convicted of the violation of the Fundamental
Standard found in the hearing examiner's report, and a
remand to the hearing examiner for the cure of the
defect in the hearing before him is, under the facts of
this case, not a fair alternative.
The defendant, Mr. Ho, was charged before the Cam
pus Judicial Panel by the University administration with
a violation of the Fundamental Standard in two particu
lars: that he committed an assault and that he "together
with others, forced his way into the kitchen of the
Stanford Faculty Club for the purpose of stealing food
from that kitchen." The hearing examiner acquitted Mr.
Ho of the first charge, the assault. As to the second
charge, the hearing examiner found, in essence, that
though Mr. Ho had no purpose to steal food from the
kitchen, he had nonetheless helped force his way into
the kitchen. The specific findings of the hearing exam
iner (with their contexts in brackets) are:
3. 1 find that Mr. Ho was informed by responsible
officials of the Faculty Club, whose position of re
sponsibility was known to him, that he was not
allowed in the rear of the Club. [Past the doors which
led to the kitchen]
4. I find that Mr. Ho by words and gestures, encour
aged the persons in the dining area to assist him in
gaining access to the hallway [on the other side of
the doors]
5. I find that the double doors leading to the hallway
were opened in response to physical force exerted by
Mr. Ho and others, [and against the resistance of two
faculty club employees]
In short, Mr. Ho was found to have forced his way into
an area where he had been told by legitimate authority
that he had no business.
No justification for Mr. Ho's acts appearing, we have
no doubt that the hearing examiner's report makes out
what, at least in our opinion, is a clear violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The issue before us, however, is
not whether Mr. Ho is guilty, but whether he has been
properly and fairly found guilty under our procedures.
LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES IN GENERAL
The threshold issue in the determination of this case
is whether the Fundamental Standard violation proven
against Mr. Ho is one of which he could be convicted,
despite the failure of the prosecution to prove its allega
tion that Mr. Ho had committed his act with a purpose
to steal food. If it was not, we need proceed no further.
The prosecution alleges that defendant was properly
convicted under a "lesser included offense" theory. It is,
indeed, a general principle of law in criminal prosecu
tions that, if the prosecution charges that the defendant
did act A with an intent to accomplish Band the
prosecution proves that the defendant did act A but
cannot meet its burden of proof on the defendant's
intent to do B, the defendant may nonetheless be con
victed of doing act A-if that act is also, in itself, an
offense. Thus, if a defendant is charged with assault with
intent to kill and the prosecution cannot sustain its
burden as to the intent, the defendant may nonetheless
be convicted of the lesser included offense of assault
assuming, of course, that assault is an offense within the
legal system in question.
Indeed, the principle covers more than simply cases
where the prosecution is unable to prove an intent it has
charged. A defendant may be convicted of assault where
the prosecution has charged him with assault with a
deadly weapon. And if a defendant is charged with
drunken driving but the prosecution cannot prove that
he was actually driving, (either because he might have
been merely a passenger or because the car might have
been motionless) the defendant may, nonetheless, be
convicted of being drunk in an automobile-assuming, of
course, that under the law of that jurisdiction, (as is the
case in California), being drunk in an automobile is also
a punishable offense.
In short, in the criminal system at large, where a
defendant is charged with all the elements of an offense,
he is on notice that he must defend against any combina
tion of these factual elements which also is punishable.
One of the issues before us in this case is whether this is
the proper rule before the CJP, as well.
THE BURGLARY ANALOGY
Defense counsel make two basic arguments on this
issue. First, they argue that the original charge at issue
here, entering a room with intent to commit an offense
therein, is very much like the charges lodged in the local
courts for violation of the California burglary statute.
Since, under California law, burglary has no lesser
included offenses (except, of course, attempted bur
glary), defendant argues that the same rule should pre
vail before the CJP. In other words, since we are reason
ing by analogy here, defendant claims that the analogy
to the specific California burglary rule should prevail
before the CJP over the more general analogy to the
failure to prove an intent charged.
We do not find this argument persuasive. The reason
why the California burglary statute has no lesser
included offense is simply that the act of entering a
room or building is not illegal at all, unless it occurs
together with the forbidden intent. Hence, unless the
prosecution can show that intent, the defendant is guilty
of no wrongful conduct whatsoever. Interestingly, in
most states, where burglary requires a breaking and
entering as well as an intent, the crime does have a lesser
included offense, "breaking and entering." Here, where
entirely apart from any purpose to steal, the act of the
defendant, under the circumstances of this case, would
seem to us to be a clear violation of the Fundamental
Standard, the analogy to the California burglary statute
appears inapposite.

LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES
IN FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD CASES
The second contention of the defendant on this issue
is more troublesome The defendant would have us hold,
on much broader grounds, that the lesser included offen
se doctrine can never apply to Fundamental Standard
violations. Defense counsel contend that where the pros
ecution charges facts amounting to a Fundamental Stan
dard violation, but does not prove all of those facts, the
prosecution cannot prevail, even though the lesser facts
it has proven also amount to Fundamental Standard
violation.
THE PROBLEM OF SURPRISE
Defendant's argument is premised in part on the lact
that the Fundamental Standard is so broad that a defen
dant attempting to meet a charge of its violation is
vulnerable to surprise at the hearing through the intro
duction of facts and issues he is unprepared to meet.

Defendant's complaint as to the Fundamental Stan
dard, however, is broader than merely that its vagueness
offers insufficient protection against surprise at trial.
The defense's complaint is that uncertainty in exactly
what constitutes a Fundamental Standard violation
places the defense in jeopardy in other ways.
First of all, we should distinguish this argument from
another quite different one which sounds somewhat
similar. The defendant is not here contending that he
should be acquitted because the Fundamental Standard

whether the defendant knew his actions were in viola

should have known.
THE RIGHT NOT TO HELP THE PROSECUTION
However, it is in part because of the fact that a
student can be guilty of a Fundamental Standard viola
tion even though he believes he is correct and the com
munity judgment wrong, that we must pay particular
attention to defense counsel's argument on this issue.
The claim in essence is that the minimal limits of the

recognition. Our rules give a defendant a specific right
not to testify and we should give this right a broad
scope. Part of such a scope is to make sure that a
defendant, in exercising his right, fully appreciates the
consequences to himself. Accordingly, should a defen
dant admit at the hearing facts which he may not appre
ciate constitute a violation, he should be warned that
this is the case and be given an opportunity to withdraw
his statement before his conviction can be founded on
his testimony. If he does withdraw his admission and
does not within the scope of cross examination repeat it,
his statement may not be considered against him by the
hearing officer or this Panel.
This rule, however, is not determinative of this case.
The (act is that, rather than admitting the lesser included
offense alleged by the prosecutor here as a basis for
conviction, Mr. Ho denied that he had exerted any force
on the door.
THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE ALL FACTS
Another facet ot defendant's argument is also related
to the possibility of failure to appreciate facts showing a
Fundamental Standard violation. Defendant argues that

because a defendant and his counsel might not recognize
the significance of facts which amounted to a Funda
mental Standard violation, these facts might not be fully
and tairly litigatej. As a result, the hearing examiner
might find untrae, misleading or incomplete facts. We
recognize this problem, but feel the solution is not to
prevent the finding of lesser included offenses in Funda
mental Standard cases. Rather, it is to give the defendant
full opportunity and notice to litigate any fact which
may be important to the disposition of his case-a mat
ter to which we will return shortly.
THE PLEADING REQUIREMENTS OF THE CJP
Finally, our decision that lesser included offenses can
be shown in Fundamental Standard cases is buttressed
by another consideration. The major operative effect of
accepting defendant's position would be to force the
prosecutor, in drafting his charges in the future, to join
all of the possible factual elements he thought he might
be able to prove, separately and in combination as sepa
rate charges. This would be complicated enough in sim
ple Fundamental Standard cases. It would be even more
so where Disruption charges and Fundamental Standard
violations are joined-as they might have been in this
case. Disruptions, most of which—when they are not
within a justification defense—are probably also Funda
mental Standard violations, can overlap in complex ways
with Fundamental Standard violations.
There is not sufficient reason to place such a burden
of drafting upon the prosecutor, especially since in those
jurisdictions which have attempted to guarantee com
plete notice through pleading, the pleadings have be
come so prolix and confusing that they became an
obstruction to rational fact finding. Moreover, though
the vagueness of the Fundamental Standard may work
against the defense, the lack of weaponry given to the
prosecutor in our system works against him even more,
in attempting to learn with a high degree of precision the
facts of the events leading to his charge. Unlike the
prosecutor in the civil courts, the University administra
tion has no equivalent of a grand jury subpoena (indeed
it cannot even subpoena witnesses at trial). Moreover,
the prosecutor in the university system has no right to a
preliminary hearing which can permit the prosecutor in
the civil society to determine, to a much greater extent,
which facts he can and which he cannot prove at trial,
and hence to shape his charges better.
Indeed the issue of whether to allow lesser included
offenses in Fundamental Standard violations is only one
facet of a much larger problem—the purpose of the
charge in the CJP procedures. Although there are obvi
ously many analogies to the criminal law in our proce
dures—most obviously the requirement of a reasonable
doubt standard—these are not criminal cases. This is
made clear by the relatively limited nature of our sanc
tions, which-though we regard them as quite severe—are
hardly equal to those of the criminal courts; the fact
that consequences and procedures similar to ours are
used in obviously civil cases such as those involving
industrial relations and faculty discipline; and the prin
ciple that the major purpose of society is, in a sense to
enforce its law, while the major purposes for which the
University exists, and which control its allocations of
resources, are education and the advancement of know
ledge.
The purpose of the charge in our system is analogous
to that under the more modern civil rules. It is not what
is called "fact" or "issue" pleading, but is "notice"
pleading where the purpose of the charge is to specify
the general area for litigation while other devices are
relied upon to permit full and fair litigation of the facts.
In a civil case, it is quite common for one side or the
other to move at the end of trial to amend its pleadings
to conform to the evidence produced. This motion is
generally granted where no prejudice to the other party
is shown. Indeed, even in criminal cases prosecuted by
information (in which, as in the University, the prosecu
tor rather than a grand jury brings the charges) the
prosecutor may amend his pleading during trial to cover
any offense shown by the evidence.
It should be made clear that our view of the CJP
pleading requirements is as likely to benefit the defen
dant as the prosecutor. We must remember that the CJP
system recognizes within itself the concept of double
jeopardy and a defendant, once acquitted of a charge
before the CJP, cannot be retried on the same charge in
our system regardless of what new evidence of his guilt
the prosecutor can discover. Since that is the case, a
narrow construction of the charge will permit the prose
cutor to retry the defendant on a closely related but
different charge, while the view that the charge before us
is broader than that in the criminal law will more nar
rowly restrict the prosecutor in subsequent charges.
In the criminal system, the more narrowly defined
relationship between the words of the charge and the
crimes of which the defendant may be convicted can
have severe consequences to the defendant. In a criminal
case, where the defendant has burned down a building,
killing several of its occupants, the prosecutor can, in
almost all jurisdictions, convict him of one murder after
another based on the same fact situation, until the jury
returns the death sentence that the prosecutor desires.
Our rule prevents the vices of a narrow construction of
charges, and, if a consequence of preventing such abuse
is a broadening of the relation between the charge and
the evidence, we think that both in terms of fairness to
the defendant and accuracy in the fact-finding process, it
is the better choice.
THE REASON FOR REVERSAL
Our disagreement with the defendants on the allow
ance of lesser included offenses in Fundamental Stan
dard cases by no means settles this case, however. All we
have thus far held is that, if the hearing is a fair one, a
defendant charged with forcing one's way into a room
with a purpose to steal can be convicted of simply
forcing his way into the room-where the circumstances
are such that that act is also a violation of the Funda
mental Standard.
However, in this case, we feel that the hearing, insofar
as it purported to determine that Mr. Ho did in fact
force his way through the doors leading to the Faculty
Club kitchen, was not a fair one. We believe defense
counsels' assertions that, at the trial, they did not think

that Mr. Ho could be convicted of any lesser included
offense. It is likely, therefore that they did not attempt
fully to contest the facts which might support his con
viction on such an offense. Defense counsel claim, and
we believe, that they felt that they had the case won on
the issue of the defendant's purpose, and hence, that
they did not need to try very hard to show that the
defendant was not guilty of the other element charged—
forcing his way through the doors. Certainly, on this
record, we cannot assume that the defendants did not
have several witnesses whom they could have called to
raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the hearing
officer as to whether the defendant applied force to the
doors or aided or encouraged anyone else to do so.
In this case, we cannot say that the defense attorneys,
without the benefit of hindsight, were obviously wrong
on the rules as to lesser included offense in our system.
This is a new judicial system. It contains, inevitably,
many unclear points-at least until the Panel itself clari
fies them (and even then they become clear, not because
we are correct, but because it is our position in the
system to say what the rules should be). We note also
that even though we rule today that he had no such
duty, the prosecutor could in fact have obviated the
whole problem by additionally charging the forcing into
the kitchen as a separate offense or by joining a charge
of disruption along with that of the Fundamental Stan
dard violation. Moreover he could have simply stated
clearly his theory of the case to the defense counsel at
any point before the end of the hearing. Similarly,
though the hearing officer seems to have believed that
the lesser included offense doctrine was applicable in
this case, he, too, made no effort to make his opinion
clear to the defense.
THE POSSIBILITY OF A REMAND
Our decision that Mr. Ho cannot be convicted on this
record because of the possible prejudice to him in the
litigation of the facts, by no means determines the
disposition of this case The CJP procedures provide that
we may remand a case back to the hearing examiner for
additional findings should they be necessary, and cer
tainly this implies a right to remand the matter to him if
any of the findings which he actually made were not
properly litigated.
Indeed, this will be the proper course in most cases
assuming there are any such cases where the particular
facts and theories justifying conviction have not been
made clear to the defense during the hearing. The only
reason it cannot be done in the criminal courts is that
once the jury has rendered its verdict, the jurors cannot
be reassembled for further findings—both because of the
practical difficulties involved and because, in the inter
im, they may have been exposed to improper influences.
Interestingly enough, where a judge sits without a jury, a
procedure more analogous to ours, an appellate court
can return a case for further findings, or indeed, for the
reception of further evidence on the findings already
made.
This is the preferable means of disposition before the
CJP in any case where it is alleged that, for one reason or
another, there was not fair notice and that there was
such surprise to the defendants that they could not
properly litigate a question which turned out to be
important. This procedure protects the legitimate right
of the defendant to a proper and accurate finding of
fact; and insofar as a defendant may have been misled
into producing evidence, other than his own testimony,
which is in fact true, we do not regard this as a suffi
ciently unfortunate consequence of our decision to de
part from what, in every other way, is clearly the better
rule.
This is not to say that, in all cases, a difference
between the charge and the proof will make a remand to
the hearing officer the proper course. First, if the proof
bears absolutely no relation to the charge, the demands
of procedural regularity would require an acquittal of
the charge as the only proper course-leaving the prose
cutor to start all over again with the charge supported by
his evidence. Second, a remand may be prevented by a
showing or permanent prejudice to the defendant caused
by events subsequent to the surprise to him. If, for
instance, witnesses available-to the defendant at the first
hearing have, before a remand, disappeared or left the
area, the first issue may not be susceptible of fair litiga
tion, and a remand might not be proper.
THE REASONS FOR ACQUITTAL HERE
In the case at issue here, there is a very different, and
we trust quite unusual, reason not to remand the case to
the hearing officer. In this case, Mr. Ho has already
undergone eight hearings before the hearing examiner
and one before us. In another case involving an alleged
classroom disruption, he has undergone eleven hearings
before the hearing examiner and, so far as we can tell,
may have to endure another before us. Moreover, he has
recently been charged, together with nine others, with
disrupting a meeting of the Academic Council, a matter
which if our past experience is any guide, will consume a
great many hearings before the hearing examiner.
In this situation, a remand of this case to the hearing
examiner might well consume several more hearings at a
time when Mr. Ho was more than merely busy with
other cases against him. This would border upon harass
ment and our reluctance to inflict this upon Mr. Ho is
fortified by the fact that the remand would have been
necessitated without fault on his or his counsels' part,
and in a situation where the possibility of a remand to
the hearing examiner was, most likely, one which they
had never contemplated. Now that our procedures are
clearer in this matter, it is most unlikely that this parti
cular equity, presently working in Mr. Ho's behalf, will
occur again.
In any event, it is working in this particular case and
this is enough to make the difference. Accordingly, we
recommend that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case
be dropped.

Robert L. White
For the reasons we state below at some length, we
feel that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case should be
dismissed. Under the circumstances of this case, Mr. Ho
cannot be convicted of the violation of the Fundamental
Standard found in the hearing examiner's report, and a
remand to the hearing examiner for the cure of the
defect in the hearing before him is, under the facts of
this case, not a fair alternative.
The defendant, Mr. Ho, was charged before the Cam
pus Judicial Panel by the University administration with
a violation of the Fundamental Standard in two particu
lars: that he committed an assault and that he "together
with others, forced his way into the kitchen of the
Stanford Faculty Club for the purpose of stealing food
from that kitchen." The hearing examiner acquitted Mr.
Ho of the first charge, the assault. As to the second
charge, the hearing examiner found, in essence, that
though Mr. Ho had no purpose to steal food from the
kitchen, he had nonetheless helped force his way into
the kitchen. The specific findings of the hearing exam
iner (with their contexts in brackets) are:
3. 1 find that Mr. Ho was informed by responsible
officials of the Faculty Club, whose position of re
sponsibility was known to him, that he was not
allowed in the rear of the Club. [Past the doors which
led to the kitchen]
4. I find that Mr. Ho by words and gestures, encour
aged the persons in the dining area to assist him in
gaining access to the hallway [on the other side of
the doors]
5. I find that the double doors leading to the hallway
were opened in response to physical force exerted by
Mr. Ho and others, [and against the resistance of two
faculty club employees]
In short, Mr. Ho was found to have forced his way into
an area where he had been told by legitimate authority
that he had no business.
No justification for Mr. Ho's acts appearing, we have
no doubt that the hearing examiner's report makes out
what, at least in our opinion, is a clear violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The issue before us, however, is
not whether Mr. Ho is guilty, but whether he has been
properly and fairly found guilty under our procedures.
LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES IN GENERAL
The threshold issue in the determination of this case
is whether the Fundamental Standard violation proven
against Mr. Ho is one of which he could be convicted,
despite the failure of the prosecution to prove its allega
tion that Mr. Ho had committed his act with a purpose
to steal food. If it was not, we need proceed no further.
The prosecution alleges that defendant was properly
convicted under a "lesser included offense" theory. It is,
indeed, a general principle of law in criminal prosecu
tions that, if the prosecution charges that the defendant
did act A with an intent to accomplish Band the
prosecution proves that the defendant did act A but
cannot meet its burden of proof on the defendant's
intent to do B, the defendant may nonetheless be con
victed of doing act A-if that act is also, in itself, an
offense. Thus, if a defendant is charged with assault with
intent to kill and the prosecution cannot sustain its
burden as to the intent, the defendant may nonetheless
be convicted of the lesser included offense of assault
assuming, of course, that assault is an offense within the
legal system in question.
Indeed, the principle covers more than simply cases
where the prosecution is unable to prove an intent it has
charged. A defendant may be convicted of assault where
the prosecution has charged him with assault with a
deadly weapon. And if a defendant is charged with
drunken driving but the prosecution cannot prove that
he was actually driving, (either because he might have
been merely a passenger or because the car might have
been motionless) the defendant may, nonetheless, be
convicted of being drunk in an automobile-assuming, of
course, that under the law of that jurisdiction, (as is the
case in California), being drunk in an automobile is also
a punishable offense.
In short, in the criminal system at large, where a
defendant is charged with all the elements of an offense,
he is on notice that he must defend against any combina
tion of these factual elements which also is punishable.
One of the issues before us in this case is whether this is
the proper rule before the CJP, as well.
THE BURGLARY ANALOGY
Defense counsel make two basic arguments on this
issue. First, they argue that the original charge at issue
here, entering a room with intent to commit an offense
therein, is very much like the charges lodged in the local
courts for violation of the California burglary statute.
Since, under California law, burglary has no lesser
included offenses (except, of course, attempted bur
glary), defendant argues that the same rule should pre
vail before the CJP. In other words, since we are reason
ing by analogy here, defendant claims that the analogy
to the specific California burglary rule should prevail
before the CJP over the more general analogy to the
failure to prove an intent charged.
We do not find this argument persuasive. The reason
why the California burglary statute has no lesser
included offense is simply that the act of entering a
room or building is not illegal at all, unless it occurs
together with the forbidden intent. Hence, unless the
prosecution can show that intent, the defendant is guilty
of no wrongful conduct whatsoever. Interestingly, in
most states, where burglary requires a breaking and
entering as well as an intent, the crime does have a lesser
included offense, "breaking and entering." Here, where
entirely apart from any purpose to steal, the act of the
defendant, under the circumstances of this case, would
seem to us to be a clear violation of the Fundamental
Standard, the analogy to the California burglary statute
appears inapposite.

LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES
IN FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD CASES
The second contention of the defendant on this issue
is more troublesome The defendant would have us hold,
on much broader grounds, that the lesser included offen
se doctrine can never apply to Fundamental Standard
violations. Defense counsel contend that where the pros
ecution charges facts amounting to a Fundamental Stan
dard violation, but does not prove all of those facts, the
prosecution cannot prevail, even though the lesser facts
it has proven also amount to Fundamental Standard
violation.
THE PROBLEM OF SURPRISE
Defendant's argument is premised in part on the lact
that the Fundamental Standard is so broad that a defen
dant attempting to meet a charge of its violation is
vulnerable to surprise at the hearing through the intro
duction of facts and issues he is unprepared to meet.
Defendant recognizes, as he must, that no frontal attack
upon the Fundamental Standard is possible. After all, it
has been a part of University law since the time of David
Starr Jordan. The defense earnestly contends, however,
that the allowance of a lesser included offense within a
Fundamental Standard charge compounds unduly what
is a built-in problem in the administration of such a
broad rule.
This facet of the defense argument is considerably
weakened by the alternative remedy available to defen
dants under the CJP procedures. Indeed, the CJP proce
dures can be far better adapted to protecting a defen
dant against surprise than can those of the outside soci
ety. In the criminal trial, a defendant who is surprised by
the prosecution's introduction of an issue cannot have
the jury kept together for an appreciable time while he
attempts to find new evidence to meet the prosecution's
evidence. Under the CJP system, the remedy to avoid
any surprise is simply the right of the party to ask the
hearing officer for sufficient time to produce his evi
dence. We cannot conceive of any reasonable continu
ance being denied by a hearing officer in a situation
where a claim of surprise or lack of notice is made in
good faith. And, if such a request for reasonable contin
uance is denied, the claim of prejudice due to lack of
notice is raisable before this Panel, as well.
Defendant's complaint as to the Fundamental Stan
dard, however, is broader than merely that its vagueness
offers insufficient protection against surprise at trial.
The defense's complaint is that uncertainty in exactly
what constitutes a Fundamental Standard violation
places the defense in jeopardy in other ways.
First of all, we should distinguish this argument from
another quite different one which sounds somewhat
similar. The defendant is not here contending that he
should be acquitted because the Fundamental Standard
is so vague that he did not know that what he was doing
in the Faculty Club was in violation of University law.
To be sure, at its outer edges the Fundamental Standard
is extremely murky, but a defendant whose acts are a
clear violation cannot raise the fact that others might
violate the Standard unwittingly. Indeed, the issue is not
whether the defendant knew his actions were in viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard, but whether he
should have known.
THE RIGHT NOT TO HELP THE PROSECUTION
However, it is in part because of the fact that a
student can be guilty of a Fundamental Standard viola
tion even though he believes he is correct and the com
munity judgment wrong, that we must pay particular
attention to defense counsel's argument on this issue.
The claim in essence is that the minimal limits of the
Fundamental Standard are so indefinite that a defendant
may be unable to meet a charge of Fundamental Stand
ard violation without, perhaps, helping the prosecution
prove some lesser included offense.
It is not a complete answer to this to say that in order
for discipline to be imposed, the Fundamental Standard
violation must be clear to us. It is quite conceivable that
a defense attorney, with values similar to those of his
client, might not appreciate that certain actions did
constitute a Fundamental Standard violation clear to the
rest of the community. In such a case, he might indeed
unwittingly help the prosecution prove its case.
For the most part, however, we do not apprehend
that this difficulty faced by a defendant is a sympathetic
one considering the structure of our proceedings and the
protections the defendant does have. The basic purpose
of the hearing before the examiner is to find out the
facts—who did what, when and where, with what state
of mind. Certainly, the hearing examiner must perform
his function in a way fair to the defendant and giving
full effect to any specific rights provided by our rules.
The hearing before the hearing examiner, however, is not
a game. The defendant certainly has the right to put the
prosecution to its proof, but if he helps prow the facts
which actually exist, we cannot regard this as a disadvan
tage of the CJP procedures.
In one situation, however, the defendant's fear of
helping the prosecution prove its case is entitled to
recognition. Our rules give a defendant a specific right
not to testify and we should give this right a broad
scope. Part of such a scope is to make sure that a
defendant, in exercising his right, fully appreciates the
consequences to himself. Accordingly, should a defen
dant admit at the hearing facts which he may not appre
ciate constitute a violation, he should be warned that
this is the case and be given an opportunity to withdraw
his statement before his conviction can be founded on
his testimony. If he does withdraw his admission and
does not within the scope of cross examination repeat it,
his statement may not be considered against him by the
hearing officer or this Panel.
This rule, however, is not determinative of this case.
The (act is that, rather than admitting the lesser included
offense alleged by the prosecutor here as a basis for
conviction, Mr. Ho denied that he had exerted any force
on the door.
THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE ALL FACTS
Another facet ot defendant's argument is also related
to the possibility of failure to appreciate facts showing a
Fundamental Standard violation. Defendant argues that

because a defendant and his counsel might not recognize
the significance of facts which amounted to a Funda
mental Standard violation, these facts might not be fully
and tairly litigatej. As a result, the hearing examiner
might find untrae, misleading or incomplete facts. We
recognize this problem, but feel the solution is not to
prevent the finding of lesser included offenses in Funda
mental Standard cases. Rather, it is to give the defendant
full opportunity and notice to litigate any fact which
may be important to the disposition of his case-a mat
ter to which we will return shortly.
THE PLEADING REQUIREMENTS OF THE CJP
Finally, our decision that lesser included offenses can
be shown in Fundamental Standard cases is buttressed
by another consideration. The major operative effect of
accepting defendant's position would be to force the
prosecutor, in drafting his charges in the future, to join
all of the possible factual elements he thought he might
be able to prove, separately and in combination as sepa
rate charges. This would be complicated enough in sim
ple Fundamental Standard cases. It would be even more
so where Disruption charges and Fundamental Standard
violations are joined-as they might have been in this
case. Disruptions, most of which—when they are not
within a justification defense—are probably also Funda
mental Standard violations, can overlap in complex ways
with Fundamental Standard violations.
There is not sufficient reason to place such a burden
of drafting upon the prosecutor, especially since in those
jurisdictions which have attempted to guarantee com
plete notice through pleading, the pleadings have be
come so prolix and confusing that they became an
obstruction to rational fact finding. Moreover, though
the vagueness of the Fundamental Standard may work
against the defense, the lack of weaponry given to the
prosecutor in our system works against him even more,
in attempting to learn with a high degree of precision the
facts of the events leading to his charge. Unlike the
prosecutor in the civil courts, the University administra
tion has no equivalent of a grand jury subpoena (indeed
it cannot even subpoena witnesses at trial). Moreover,
the prosecutor in the university system has no right to a
preliminary hearing which can permit the prosecutor in
the civil society to determine, to a much greater extent,
which facts he can and which he cannot prove at trial,
and hence to shape his charges better.
Indeed the issue of whether to allow lesser included
offenses in Fundamental Standard violations is only one
facet of a much larger problem—the purpose of the
charge in the CJP procedures. Although there are obvi
ously many analogies to the criminal law in our proce
dures—most obviously the requirement of a reasonable
doubt standard—these are not criminal cases. This is
made clear by the relatively limited nature of our sanc
tions, which-though we regard them as quite severe—are
hardly equal to those of the criminal courts; the fact
that consequences and procedures similar to ours are
used in obviously civil cases such as those involving
industrial relations and faculty discipline; and the prin
ciple that the major purpose of society is, in a sense to
enforce its law, while the major purposes for which the
University exists, and which control its allocations of
resources, are education and the advancement of know
ledge.
The purpose of the charge in our system is analogous
to that under the more modern civil rules. It is not what
is called "fact" or "issue" pleading, but is "notice"
pleading where the purpose of the charge is to specify
the general area for litigation while other devices are
relied upon to permit full and fair litigation of the facts.
In a civil case, it is quite common for one side or the
other to move at the end of trial to amend its pleadings
to conform to the evidence produced. This motion is
generally granted where no prejudice to the other party
is shown. Indeed, even in criminal cases prosecuted by
information (in which, as in the University, the prosecu
tor rather than a grand jury brings the charges) the
prosecutor may amend his pleading during trial to cover
any offense shown by the evidence.
It should be made clear that our view of the CJP
pleading requirements is as likely to benefit the defen
dant as the prosecutor. We must remember that the CJP
system recognizes within itself the concept of double
jeopardy and a defendant, once acquitted of a charge
before the CJP, cannot be retried on the same charge in
our system regardless of what new evidence of his guilt
the prosecutor can discover. Since that is the case, a
narrow construction of the charge will permit the prose
cutor to retry the defendant on a closely related but
different charge, while the view that the charge before us
is broader than that in the criminal law will more nar
rowly restrict the prosecutor in subsequent charges.
In the criminal system, the more narrowly defined
relationship between the words of the charge and the
crimes of which the defendant may be convicted can
have severe consequences to the defendant. In a criminal
case, where the defendant has burned down a building,
killing several of its occupants, the prosecutor can, in
almost all jurisdictions, convict him of one murder after
another based on the same fact situation, until the jury
returns the death sentence that the prosecutor desires.
Our rule prevents the vices of a narrow construction of
charges, and, if a consequence of preventing such abuse
is a broadening of the relation between the charge and
the evidence, we think that both in terms of fairness to
the defendant and accuracy in the fact-finding process, it
is the better choice.
THE REASON FOR REVERSAL
Our disagreement with the defendants on the allow
ance of lesser included offenses in Fundamental Stan
dard cases by no means settles this case, however. All we
have thus far held is that, if the hearing is a fair one, a
defendant charged with forcing one's way into a room
with a purpose to steal can be convicted of simply
forcing his way into the room-where the circumstances
are such that that act is also a violation of the Funda
mental Standard.
However, in this case, we feel that the hearing, insofar
as it purported to determine that Mr. Ho did in fact
force his way through the doors leading to the Faculty
Club kitchen, was not a fair one. We believe defense
counsels' assertions that, at the trial, they did not think

that Mr. Ho could be convicted of any lesser included
offense. It is likely, therefore that they did not attempt
fully to contest the facts which might support his con
viction on such an offense. Defense counsel claim, and
we believe, that they felt that they had the case won on
the issue of the defendant's purpose, and hence, that
they did not need to try very hard to show that the
defendant was not guilty of the other element charged—
forcing his way through the doors. Certainly, on this
record, we cannot assume that the defendants did not
have several witnesses whom they could have called to
raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the hearing
officer as to whether the defendant applied force to the
doors or aided or encouraged anyone else to do so.
In this case, we cannot say that the defense attorneys,
without the benefit of hindsight, were obviously wrong
on the rules as to lesser included offense in our system.
This is a new judicial system. It contains, inevitably,
many unclear points-at least until the Panel itself clari
fies them (and even then they become clear, not because
we are correct, but because it is our position in the
system to say what the rules should be). We note also
that even though we rule today that he had no such
duty, the prosecutor could in fact have obviated the
whole problem by additionally charging the forcing into
the kitchen as a separate offense or by joining a charge
of disruption along with that of the Fundamental Stan
dard violation. Moreover he could have simply stated
clearly his theory of the case to the defense counsel at
any point before the end of the hearing. Similarly,
though the hearing officer seems to have believed that
the lesser included offense doctrine was applicable in
this case, he, too, made no effort to make his opinion
clear to the defense.
THE POSSIBILITY OF A REMAND
Our decision that Mr. Ho cannot be convicted on this
record because of the possible prejudice to him in the
litigation of the facts, by no means determines the
disposition of this case The CJP procedures provide that
we may remand a case back to the hearing examiner for
additional findings should they be necessary, and cer
tainly this implies a right to remand the matter to him if
any of the findings which he actually made were not
properly litigated.
Indeed, this will be the proper course in most cases
assuming there are any such cases where the particular
facts and theories justifying conviction have not been
made clear to the defense during the hearing. The only
reason it cannot be done in the criminal courts is that
once the jury has rendered its verdict, the jurors cannot
be reassembled for further findings—both because of the
practical difficulties involved and because, in the inter
im, they may have been exposed to improper influences.
Interestingly enough, where a judge sits without a jury, a
procedure more analogous to ours, an appellate court
can return a case for further findings, or indeed, for the
reception of further evidence on the findings already
made.
This is the preferable means of disposition before the
CJP in any case where it is alleged that, for one reason or
another, there was not fair notice and that there was
such surprise to the defendants that they could not
properly litigate a question which turned out to be
important. This procedure protects the legitimate right
of the defendant to a proper and accurate finding of
fact; and insofar as a defendant may have been misled
into producing evidence, other than his own testimony,
which is in fact true, we do not regard this as a suffi
ciently unfortunate consequence of our decision to de
part from what, in every other way, is clearly the better
rule.
This is not to say that, in all cases, a difference
between the charge and the proof will make a remand to
the hearing officer the proper course. First, if the proof
bears absolutely no relation to the charge, the demands
of procedural regularity would require an acquittal of
the charge as the only proper course-leaving the prose
cutor to start all over again with the charge supported by
his evidence. Second, a remand may be prevented by a
showing or permanent prejudice to the defendant caused
by events subsequent to the surprise to him. If, for
instance, witnesses available-to the defendant at the first
hearing have, before a remand, disappeared or left the
area, the first issue may not be susceptible of fair litiga
tion, and a remand might not be proper.
THE REASONS FOR ACQUITTAL HERE
In the case at issue here, there is a very different, and
we trust quite unusual, reason not to remand the case to
the hearing officer. In this case, Mr. Ho has already
undergone eight hearings before the hearing examiner
and one before us. In another case involving an alleged
classroom disruption, he has undergone eleven hearings
before the hearing examiner and, so far as we can tell,
may have to endure another before us. Moreover, he has
recently been charged, together with nine others, with
disrupting a meeting of the Academic Council, a matter
which if our past experience is any guide, will consume a
great many hearings before the hearing examiner.
In this situation, a remand of this case to the hearing
examiner might well consume several more hearings at a
time when Mr. Ho was more than merely busy with
other cases against him. This would border upon harass
ment and our reluctance to inflict this upon Mr. Ho is
fortified by the fact that the remand would have been
necessitated without fault on his or his counsels' part,
and in a situation where the possibility of a remand to
the hearing examiner was, most likely, one which they
had never contemplated. Now that our procedures are
clearer in this matter, it is most unlikely that this parti
cular equity, presently working in Mr. Ho's behalf, will
occur again.
In any event, it is working in this particular case and
this is enough to make the difference. Accordingly, we
recommend that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case
be dropped.

For the reasons we state below at some length, we
feel that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case should be
dismissed. Under the circumstances of this case, Mr. Ho
cannot be convicted of the violation of the Fundamental
Standard found in the hearing examiner's report, and a
remand to the hearing examiner for the cure of the
defect in the hearing before him is, under the facts of
this case, not a fair alternative.
The defendant, Mr. Ho, was charged before the Cam
pus Judicial Panel by the University administration with
a violation of the Fundamental Standard in two particu
lars: that he committed an assault and that he "together
with others, forced his way into the kitchen of the
Stanford Faculty Club for the purpose of stealing food
from that kitchen." The hearing examiner acquitted Mr.
Ho of the first charge, the assault. As to the second
charge, the hearing examiner found, in essence, that
though Mr. Ho had no purpose to steal food from the
kitchen, he had nonetheless helped force his way into
the kitchen. The specific findings of the hearing exam
iner (with their contexts in brackets) are:
3. 1 find that Mr. Ho was informed by responsible
officials of the Faculty Club, whose position of re
sponsibility was known to him, that he was not
allowed in the rear of the Club. [Past the doors which
led to the kitchen]
4. I find that Mr. Ho by words and gestures, encour
aged the persons in the dining area to assist him in
gaining access to the hallway [on the other side of
the doors]
5. I find that the double doors leading to the hallway
were opened in response to physical force exerted by
Mr. Ho and others, [and against the resistance of two
faculty club employees]
In short, Mr. Ho was found to have forced his way into
an area where he had been told by legitimate authority
that he had no business.
No justification for Mr. Ho's acts appearing, we have
no doubt that the hearing examiner's report makes out
what, at least in our opinion, is a clear violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The issue before us, however, is
not whether Mr. Ho is guilty, but whether he has been
properly and fairly found guilty under our procedures.
LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES IN GENERAL
The threshold issue in the determination of this case
is whether the Fundamental Standard violation proven
against Mr. Ho is one of which he could be convicted,
despite the failure of the prosecution to prove its allega
tion that Mr. Ho had committed his act with a purpose
to steal food. If it was not, we need proceed no further.
The prosecution alleges that defendant was properly
convicted under a "lesser included offense" theory. It is,
indeed, a general principle of law in criminal prosecu
tions that, if the prosecution charges that the defendant
did act A with an intent to accomplish Band the
prosecution proves that the defendant did act A but
cannot meet its burden of proof on the defendant's
intent to do B, the defendant may nonetheless be con
victed of doing act A-if that act is also, in itself, an
offense. Thus, if a defendant is charged with assault with
intent to kill and the prosecution cannot sustain its
burden as to the intent, the defendant may nonetheless
be convicted of the lesser included offense of assault
assuming, of course, that assault is an offense within the
legal system in question.
Indeed, the principle covers more than simply cases
where the prosecution is unable to prove an intent it has
charged. A defendant may be convicted of assault where
the prosecution has charged him with assault with a
deadly weapon. And if a defendant is charged with
drunken driving but the prosecution cannot prove that
he was actually driving, (either because he might have
been merely a passenger or because the car might have
been motionless) the defendant may, nonetheless, be
convicted of being drunk in an automobile-assuming, of
course, that under the law of that jurisdiction, (as is the
case in California), being drunk in an automobile is also
a punishable offense.
In short, in the criminal system at large, where a
defendant is charged with all the elements of an offense,
he is on notice that he must defend against any combina
tion of these factual elements which also is punishable.
One of the issues before us in this case is whether this is
the proper rule before the CJP, as well.
THE BURGLARY ANALOGY
Defense counsel make two basic arguments on this
issue. First, they argue that the original charge at issue
here, entering a room with intent to commit an offense
therein, is very much like the charges lodged in the local
courts for violation of the California burglary statute.
Since, under California law, burglary has no lesser
included offenses (except, of course, attempted bur
glary), defendant argues that the same rule should pre
vail before the CJP. In other words, since we are reason
ing by analogy here, defendant claims that the analogy
to the specific California burglary rule should prevail
before the CJP over the more general analogy to the
failure to prove an intent charged.
We do not find this argument persuasive. The reason
why the California burglary statute has no lesser
included offense is simply that the act of entering a
room or building is not illegal at all, unless it occurs
together with the forbidden intent. Hence, unless the
prosecution can show that intent, the defendant is guilty
of no wrongful conduct whatsoever. Interestingly, in
most states, where burglary requires a breaking and
entering as well as an intent, the crime does have a lesser
included offense, "breaking and entering." Here, where
entirely apart from any purpose to steal, the act of the
defendant, under the circumstances of this case, would
seem to us to be a clear violation of the Fundamental
Standard, the analogy to the California burglary statute
appears inapposite.

LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES
IN FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD CASES
The second contention of the defendant on this issue
is more troublesome The defendant would have us hold,
on much broader grounds, that the lesser included offen
se doctrine can never apply to Fundamental Standard
violations. Defense counsel contend that where the pros
ecution charges facts amounting to a Fundamental Stan
dard violation, but does not prove all of those facts, the
prosecution cannot prevail, even though the lesser facts
it has proven also amount to Fundamental Standard
violation.
THE PROBLEM OF SURPRISE
Defendant's argument is premised in part on the lact
that the Fundamental Standard is so broad that a defen
dant attempting to meet a charge of its violation is
vulnerable to surprise at the hearing through the intro
duction of facts and issues he is unprepared to meet.
Defendant recognizes, as he must, that no frontal attack
upon the Fundamental Standard is possible. After all, it
has been a part of University law since the time of David
Starr Jordan. The defense earnestly contends, however,
that the allowance of a lesser included offense within a
Fundamental Standard charge compounds unduly what
is a built-in problem in the administration of such a
broad rule.
This facet of the defense argument is considerably
weakened by the alternative remedy available to defen
dants under the CJP procedures. Indeed, the CJP proce
dures can be far better adapted to protecting a defen
dant against surprise than can those of the outside soci
ety. In the criminal trial, a defendant who is surprised by
the prosecution's introduction of an issue cannot have
the jury kept together for an appreciable time while he
attempts to find new evidence to meet the prosecution's
evidence. Under the CJP system, the remedy to avoid
any surprise is simply the right of the party to ask the
hearing officer for sufficient time to produce his evi
dence. We cannot conceive of any reasonable continu
ance being denied by a hearing officer in a situation
where a claim of surprise or lack of notice is made in
good faith. And, if such a request for reasonable contin
uance is denied, the claim of prejudice due to lack of
notice is raisable before this Panel, as well.
Defendant's complaint as to the Fundamental Stan
dard, however, is broader than merely that its vagueness
offers insufficient protection against surprise at trial.
The defense's complaint is that uncertainty in exactly
what constitutes a Fundamental Standard violation
places the defense in jeopardy in other ways.
First of all, we should distinguish this argument from
another quite different one which sounds somewhat
similar. The defendant is not here contending that he
should be acquitted because the Fundamental Standard
is so vague that he did not know that what he was doing
in the Faculty Club was in violation of University law.
To be sure, at its outer edges the Fundamental Standard
is extremely murky, but a defendant whose acts are a
clear violation cannot raise the fact that others might
violate the Standard unwittingly. Indeed, the issue is not
whether the defendant knew his actions were in viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard, but whether he
should have known.
THE RIGHT NOT TO HELP THE PROSECUTION
However, it is in part because of the fact that a
student can be guilty of a Fundamental Standard viola
tion even though he believes he is correct and the com
munity judgment wrong, that we must pay particular
attention to defense counsel's argument on this issue.
The claim in essence is that the minimal limits of the
Fundamental Standard are so indefinite that a defendant
may be unable to meet a charge of Fundamental Stand
ard violation without, perhaps, helping the prosecution
prove some lesser included offense.
It is not a complete answer to this to say that in order
for discipline to be imposed, the Fundamental Standard
violation must be clear to us. It is quite conceivable that
a defense attorney, with values similar to those of his
client, might not appreciate that certain actions did
constitute a Fundamental Standard violation clear to the
rest of the community. In such a case, he might indeed
unwittingly help the prosecution prove its case.
For the most part, however, we do not apprehend
that this difficulty faced by a defendant is a sympathetic
one considering the structure of our proceedings and the
protections the defendant does have. The basic purpose
of the hearing before the examiner is to find out the
facts—who did what, when and where, with what state
of mind. Certainly, the hearing examiner must perform
his function in a way fair to the defendant and giving
full effect to any specific rights provided by our rules.
The hearing before the hearing examiner, however, is not
a game. The defendant certainly has the right to put the
prosecution to its proof, but if he helps prow the facts
which actually exist, we cannot regard this as a disadvan
tage of the CJP procedures.
In one situation, however, the defendant's fear of
helping the prosecution prove its case is entitled to
recognition. Our rules give a defendant a specific right
not to testify and we should give this right a broad
scope. Part of such a scope is to make sure that a
defendant, in exercising his right, fully appreciates the
consequences to himself. Accordingly, should a defen
dant admit at the hearing facts which he may not appre
ciate constitute a violation, he should be warned that
this is the case and be given an opportunity to withdraw
his statement before his conviction can be founded on
his testimony. If he does withdraw his admission and
does not within the scope of cross examination repeat it,
his statement may not be considered against him by the
hearing officer or this Panel.
This rule, however, is not determinative of this case.
The (act is that, rather than admitting the lesser included
offense alleged by the prosecutor here as a basis for
conviction, Mr. Ho denied that he had exerted any force
on the door.
THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE ALL FACTS
Another facet ot defendant's argument is also related
to the possibility of failure to appreciate facts showing a
Fundamental Standard violation. Defendant argues that

because a defendant and his counsel might not recognize
the significance of facts which amounted to a Funda
mental Standard violation, these facts might not be fully
and tairly litigatej. As a result, the hearing examiner
might find untrae, misleading or incomplete facts. We
recognize this problem, but feel the solution is not to
prevent the finding of lesser included offenses in Funda
mental Standard cases. Rather, it is to give the defendant
full opportunity and notice to litigate any fact which
may be important to the disposition of his case-a mat
ter to which we will return shortly.
THE PLEADING REQUIREMENTS OF THE CJP
Finally, our decision that lesser included offenses can
be shown in Fundamental Standard cases is buttressed
by another consideration. The major operative effect of
accepting defendant's position would be to force the
prosecutor, in drafting his charges in the future, to join
all of the possible factual elements he thought he might
be able to prove, separately and in combination as sepa
rate charges. This would be complicated enough in sim
ple Fundamental Standard cases. It would be even more
so where Disruption charges and Fundamental Standard
violations are joined-as they might have been in this
case. Disruptions, most of which—when they are not
within a justification defense—are probably also Funda
mental Standard violations, can overlap in complex ways
with Fundamental Standard violations.
There is not sufficient reason to place such a burden
of drafting upon the prosecutor, especially since in those
jurisdictions which have attempted to guarantee com
plete notice through pleading, the pleadings have be
come so prolix and confusing that they became an
obstruction to rational fact finding. Moreover, though
the vagueness of the Fundamental Standard may work
against the defense, the lack of weaponry given to the
prosecutor in our system works against him even more,
in attempting to learn with a high degree of precision the
facts of the events leading to his charge. Unlike the
prosecutor in the civil courts, the University administra
tion has no equivalent of a grand jury subpoena (indeed
it cannot even subpoena witnesses at trial). Moreover,
the prosecutor in the university system has no right to a
preliminary hearing which can permit the prosecutor in
the civil society to determine, to a much greater extent,
which facts he can and which he cannot prove at trial,
and hence to shape his charges better.
Indeed the issue of whether to allow lesser included
offenses in Fundamental Standard violations is only one
facet of a much larger problem—the purpose of the
charge in the CJP procedures. Although there are obvi
ously many analogies to the criminal law in our proce
dures—most obviously the requirement of a reasonable
doubt standard—these are not criminal cases. This is
made clear by the relatively limited nature of our sanc
tions, which-though we regard them as quite severe—are
hardly equal to those of the criminal courts; the fact
that consequences and procedures similar to ours are
used in obviously civil cases such as those involving
industrial relations and faculty discipline; and the prin
ciple that the major purpose of society is, in a sense to
enforce its law, while the major purposes for which the
University exists, and which control its allocations of
resources, are education and the advancement of know
ledge.
The purpose of the charge in our system is analogous
to that under the more modern civil rules. It is not what
is called "fact" or "issue" pleading, but is "notice"
pleading where the purpose of the charge is to specify
the general area for litigation while other devices are
relied upon to permit full and fair litigation of the facts.
In a civil case, it is quite common for one side or the
other to move at the end of trial to amend its pleadings
to conform to the evidence produced. This motion is
generally granted where no prejudice to the other party
is shown. Indeed, even in criminal cases prosecuted by
information (in which, as in the University, the prosecu
tor rather than a grand jury brings the charges) the
prosecutor may amend his pleading during trial to cover
any offense shown by the evidence.
It should be made clear that our view of the CJP
pleading requirements is as likely to benefit the defen
dant as the prosecutor. We must remember that the CJP
system recognizes within itself the concept of double
jeopardy and a defendant, once acquitted of a charge
before the CJP, cannot be retried on the same charge in
our system regardless of what new evidence of his guilt
the prosecutor can discover. Since that is the case, a
narrow construction of the charge will permit the prose
cutor to retry the defendant on a closely related but
different charge, while the view that the charge before us
is broader than that in the criminal law will more nar
rowly restrict the prosecutor in subsequent charges.
In the criminal system, the more narrowly defined
relationship between the words of the charge and the
crimes of which the defendant may be convicted can
have severe consequences to the defendant. In a criminal
case, where the defendant has burned down a building,
killing several of its occupants, the prosecutor can, in
almost all jurisdictions, convict him of one murder after
another based on the same fact situation, until the jury
returns the death sentence that the prosecutor desires.
Our rule prevents the vices of a narrow construction of
charges, and, if a consequence of preventing such abuse
is a broadening of the relation between the charge and
the evidence, we think that both in terms of fairness to
the defendant and accuracy in the fact-finding process, it
is the better choice.
THE REASON FOR REVERSAL
Our disagreement with the defendants on the allow
ance of lesser included offenses in Fundamental Stan
dard cases by no means settles this case, however. All we
have thus far held is that, if the hearing is a fair one, a
defendant charged with forcing one's way into a room
with a purpose to steal can be convicted of simply
forcing his way into the room-where the circumstances
are such that that act is also a violation of the Funda
mental Standard.
However, in this case, we feel that the hearing, insofar
as it purported to determine that Mr. Ho did in fact
force his way through the doors leading to the Faculty
Club kitchen, was not a fair one. We believe defense
counsels' assertions that, at the trial, they did not think

that Mr. Ho could be convicted of any lesser included
offense. It is likely, therefore that they did not attempt
fully to contest the facts which might support his con
viction on such an offense. Defense counsel claim, and
we believe, that they felt that they had the case won on
the issue of the defendant's purpose, and hence, that
they did not need to try very hard to show that the
defendant was not guilty of the other element charged—
forcing his way through the doors. Certainly, on this
record, we cannot assume that the defendants did not
have several witnesses whom they could have called to
raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the hearing
officer as to whether the defendant applied force to the
doors or aided or encouraged anyone else to do so.
In this case, we cannot say that the defense attorneys,
without the benefit of hindsight, were obviously wrong
on the rules as to lesser included offense in our system.
This is a new judicial system. It contains, inevitably,
many unclear points-at least until the Panel itself clari
fies them (and even then they become clear, not because
we are correct, but because it is our position in the
system to say what the rules should be). We note also
that even though we rule today that he had no such
duty, the prosecutor could in fact have obviated the
whole problem by additionally charging the forcing into
the kitchen as a separate offense or by joining a charge
of disruption along with that of the Fundamental Stan
dard violation. Moreover he could have simply stated
clearly his theory of the case to the defense counsel at
any point before the end of the hearing. Similarly,
though the hearing officer seems to have believed that
the lesser included offense doctrine was applicable in
this case, he, too, made no effort to make his opinion
clear to the defense.
THE POSSIBILITY OF A REMAND
Our decision that Mr. Ho cannot be convicted on this
record because of the possible prejudice to him in the
litigation of the facts, by no means determines the
disposition of this case The CJP procedures provide that
we may remand a case back to the hearing examiner for
additional findings should they be necessary, and cer
tainly this implies a right to remand the matter to him if
any of the findings which he actually made were not
properly litigated.
Indeed, this will be the proper course in most cases
assuming there are any such cases where the particular
facts and theories justifying conviction have not been
made clear to the defense during the hearing. The only
reason it cannot be done in the criminal courts is that
once the jury has rendered its verdict, the jurors cannot
be reassembled for further findings—both because of the
practical difficulties involved and because, in the inter
im, they may have been exposed to improper influences.
Interestingly enough, where a judge sits without a jury, a
procedure more analogous to ours, an appellate court
can return a case for further findings, or indeed, for the
reception of further evidence on the findings already
made.
This is the preferable means of disposition before the
CJP in any case where it is alleged that, for one reason or
another, there was not fair notice and that there was
such surprise to the defendants that they could not
properly litigate a question which turned out to be
important. This procedure protects the legitimate right
of the defendant to a proper and accurate finding of
fact; and insofar as a defendant may have been misled
into producing evidence, other than his own testimony,
which is in fact true, we do not regard this as a suffi
ciently unfortunate consequence of our decision to de
part from what, in every other way, is clearly the better
rule.
This is not to say that, in all cases, a difference
between the charge and the proof will make a remand to
the hearing officer the proper course. First, if the proof
bears absolutely no relation to the charge, the demands
of procedural regularity would require an acquittal of
the charge as the only proper course-leaving the prose
cutor to start all over again with the charge supported by
his evidence. Second, a remand may be prevented by a
showing or permanent prejudice to the defendant caused
by events subsequent to the surprise to him. If, for
instance, witnesses available-to the defendant at the first
hearing have, before a remand, disappeared or left the
area, the first issue may not be susceptible of fair litiga
tion, and a remand might not be proper.
THE REASONS FOR ACQUITTAL HERE
In the case at issue here, there is a very different, and
we trust quite unusual, reason not to remand the case to
the hearing officer. In this case, Mr. Ho has already
undergone eight hearings before the hearing examiner
and one before us. In another case involving an alleged
classroom disruption, he has undergone eleven hearings
before the hearing examiner and, so far as we can tell,
may have to endure another before us. Moreover, he has
recently been charged, together with nine others, with
disrupting a meeting of the Academic Council, a matter
which if our past experience is any guide, will consume a
great many hearings before the hearing examiner.
In this situation, a remand of this case to the hearing
examiner might well consume several more hearings at a
time when Mr. Ho was more than merely busy with
other cases against him. This would border upon harass
ment and our reluctance to inflict this upon Mr. Ho is
fortified by the fact that the remand would have been
necessitated without fault on his or his counsels' part,
and in a situation where the possibility of a remand to
the hearing examiner was, most likely, one which they
had never contemplated. Now that our procedures are
clearer in this matter, it is most unlikely that this parti
cular equity, presently working in Mr. Ho's behalf, will
occur again.
In any event, it is working in this particular case and
this is enough to make the difference. Accordingly, we
recommend that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case
be dropped.

For the reasons we state below at some length, we
feel that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case should be
dismissed. Under the circumstances of this case, Mr. Ho
cannot be convicted of the violation of the Fundamental
Standard found in the hearing examiner's report, and a
remand to the hearing examiner for the cure of the
defect in the hearing before him is, under the facts of
this case, not a fair alternative.
The defendant, Mr. Ho, was charged before the Cam
pus Judicial Panel by the University administration with
a violation of the Fundamental Standard in two particu
lars: that he committed an assault and that he "together
with others, forced his way into the kitchen of the
Stanford Faculty Club for the purpose of stealing food
from that kitchen." The hearing examiner acquitted Mr.
Ho of the first charge, the assault. As to the second
charge, the hearing examiner found, in essence, that
though Mr. Ho had no purpose to steal food from the
kitchen, he had nonetheless helped force his way into
the kitchen. The specific findings of the hearing exam
iner (with their contexts in brackets) are:
3. 1 find that Mr. Ho was informed by responsible
officials of the Faculty Club, whose position of re
sponsibility was known to him, that he was not
allowed in the rear of the Club. [Past the doors which
led to the kitchen]
4. I find that Mr. Ho by words and gestures, encour
aged the persons in the dining area to assist him in
gaining access to the hallway [on the other side of
the doors]
5. I find that the double doors leading to the hallway
were opened in response to physical force exerted by
Mr. Ho and others, [and against the resistance of two
faculty club employees]
In short, Mr. Ho was found to have forced his way into
an area where he had been told by legitimate authority
that he had no business.
No justification for Mr. Ho's acts appearing, we have
no doubt that the hearing examiner's report makes out
what, at least in our opinion, is a clear violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The issue before us, however, is
not whether Mr. Ho is guilty, but whether he has been
properly and fairly found guilty under our procedures.
LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES IN GENERAL
The threshold issue in the determination of this case
is whether the Fundamental Standard violation proven
against Mr. Ho is one of which he could be convicted,
despite the failure of the prosecution to prove its allega
tion that Mr. Ho had committed his act with a purpose
to steal food. If it was not, we need proceed no further.
The prosecution alleges that defendant was properly
convicted under a "lesser included offense" theory. It is,
indeed, a general principle of law in criminal prosecu
tions that, if the prosecution charges that the defendant
did act A with an intent to accomplish Band the
prosecution proves that the defendant did act A but
cannot meet its burden of proof on the defendant's
intent to do B, the defendant may nonetheless be con
victed of doing act A-if that act is also, in itself, an
offense. Thus, if a defendant is charged with assault with
intent to kill and the prosecution cannot sustain its
burden as to the intent, the defendant may nonetheless
be convicted of the lesser included offense of assault
assuming, of course, that assault is an offense within the
legal system in question.
Indeed, the principle covers more than simply cases
where the prosecution is unable to prove an intent it has
charged. A defendant may be convicted of assault where
the prosecution has charged him with assault with a
deadly weapon. And if a defendant is charged with
drunken driving but the prosecution cannot prove that
he was actually driving, (either because he might have
been merely a passenger or because the car might have
been motionless) the defendant may, nonetheless, be
convicted of being drunk in an automobile-assuming, of
course, that under the law of that jurisdiction, (as is the
case in California), being drunk in an automobile is also
a punishable offense.
In short, in the criminal system at large, where a
defendant is charged with all the elements of an offense,
he is on notice that he must defend against any combina
tion of these factual elements which also is punishable.
One of the issues before us in this case is whether this is
the proper rule before the CJP, as well.
THE BURGLARY ANALOGY
Defense counsel make two basic arguments on this
issue. First, they argue that the original charge at issue
here, entering a room with intent to commit an offense
therein, is very much like the charges lodged in the local
courts for violation of the California burglary statute.
Since, under California law, burglary has no lesser
included offenses (except, of course, attempted bur
glary), defendant argues that the same rule should pre
vail before the CJP. In other words, since we are reason
ing by analogy here, defendant claims that the analogy
to the specific California burglary rule should prevail
before the CJP over the more general analogy to the
failure to prove an intent charged.
We do not find this argument persuasive. The reason
why the California burglary statute has no lesser
included offense is simply that the act of entering a
room or building is not illegal at all, unless it occurs
together with the forbidden intent. Hence, unless the
prosecution can show that intent, the defendant is guilty
of no wrongful conduct whatsoever. Interestingly, in
most states, where burglary requires a breaking and
entering as well as an intent, the crime does have a lesser
included offense, "breaking and entering." Here, where
entirely apart from any purpose to steal, the act of the
defendant, under the circumstances of this case, would
seem to us to be a clear violation of the Fundamental
Standard, the analogy to the California burglary statute
appears inapposite.

LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES
IN FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD CASES
The second contention of the defendant on this issue
is more troublesome The defendant would have us hold,
on much broader grounds, that the lesser included offen
se doctrine can never apply to Fundamental Standard
violations. Defense counsel contend that where the pros
ecution charges facts amounting to a Fundamental Stan
dard violation, but does not prove all of those facts, the
prosecution cannot prevail, even though the lesser facts
it has proven also amount to Fundamental Standard
violation.
THE PROBLEM OF SURPRISE
Defendant's argument is premised in part on the lact
that the Fundamental Standard is so broad that a defen
dant attempting to meet a charge of its violation is
vulnerable to surprise at the hearing through the intro
duction of facts and issues he is unprepared to meet.
Defendant recognizes, as he must, that no frontal attack
upon the Fundamental Standard is possible. After all, it
has been a part of University law since the time of David
Starr Jordan. The defense earnestly contends, however,
that the allowance of a lesser included offense within a
Fundamental Standard charge compounds unduly what
is a built-in problem in the administration of such a
broad rule.
This facet of the defense argument is considerably
weakened by the alternative remedy available to defen
dants under the CJP procedures. Indeed, the CJP proce
dures can be far better adapted to protecting a defen
dant against surprise than can those of the outside soci
ety. In the criminal trial, a defendant who is surprised by
the prosecution's introduction of an issue cannot have
the jury kept together for an appreciable time while he
attempts to find new evidence to meet the prosecution's
evidence. Under the CJP system, the remedy to avoid
any surprise is simply the right of the party to ask the
hearing officer for sufficient time to produce his evi
dence. We cannot conceive of any reasonable continu
ance being denied by a hearing officer in a situation
where a claim of surprise or lack of notice is made in
good faith. And, if such a request for reasonable contin
uance is denied, the claim of prejudice due to lack of
notice is raisable before this Panel, as well.
Defendant's complaint as to the Fundamental Stan
dard, however, is broader than merely that its vagueness
offers insufficient protection against surprise at trial.
The defense's complaint is that uncertainty in exactly
what constitutes a Fundamental Standard violation
places the defense in jeopardy in other ways.
First of all, we should distinguish this argument from
another quite different one which sounds somewhat
similar. The defendant is not here contending that he
should be acquitted because the Fundamental Standard
is so vague that he did not know that what he was doing
in the Faculty Club was in violation of University law.
To be sure, at its outer edges the Fundamental Standard
is extremely murky, but a defendant whose acts are a
clear violation cannot raise the fact that others might
violate the Standard unwittingly. Indeed, the issue is not
whether the defendant knew his actions were in viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard, but whether he
should have known.
THE RIGHT NOT TO HELP THE PROSECUTION
However, it is in part because of the fact that a
student can be guilty of a Fundamental Standard viola
tion even though he believes he is correct and the com
munity judgment wrong, that we must pay particular
attention to defense counsel's argument on this issue.
The claim in essence is that the minimal limits of the
Fundamental Standard are so indefinite that a defendant
may be unable to meet a charge of Fundamental Stand
ard violation without, perhaps, helping the prosecution
prove some lesser included offense.
It is not a complete answer to this to say that in order
for discipline to be imposed, the Fundamental Standard
violation must be clear to us. It is quite conceivable that
a defense attorney, with values similar to those of his
client, might not appreciate that certain actions did
constitute a Fundamental Standard violation clear to the
rest of the community. In such a case, he might indeed
unwittingly help the prosecution prove its case.
For the most part, however, we do not apprehend
that this difficulty faced by a defendant is a sympathetic
one considering the structure of our proceedings and the
protections the defendant does have. The basic purpose
of the hearing before the examiner is to find out the
facts—who did what, when and where, with what state
of mind. Certainly, the hearing examiner must perform
his function in a way fair to the defendant and giving
full effect to any specific rights provided by our rules.
The hearing before the hearing examiner, however, is not
a game. The defendant certainly has the right to put the
prosecution to its proof, but if he helps prow the facts
which actually exist, we cannot regard this as a disadvan
tage of the CJP procedures.
In one situation, however, the defendant's fear of
helping the prosecution prove its case is entitled to
recognition. Our rules give a defendant a specific right
not to testify and we should give this right a broad
scope. Part of such a scope is to make sure that a
defendant, in exercising his right, fully appreciates the
consequences to himself. Accordingly, should a defen
dant admit at the hearing facts which he may not appre
ciate constitute a violation, he should be warned that
this is the case and be given an opportunity to withdraw
his statement before his conviction can be founded on
his testimony. If he does withdraw his admission and
does not within the scope of cross examination repeat it,
his statement may not be considered against him by the
hearing officer or this Panel.
This rule, however, is not determinative of this case.
The (act is that, rather than admitting the lesser included
offense alleged by the prosecutor here as a basis for
conviction, Mr. Ho denied that he had exerted any force
on the door.
THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE ALL FACTS
Another facet ot defendant's argument is also related
to the possibility of failure to appreciate facts showing a
Fundamental Standard violation. Defendant argues that

because a defendant and his counsel might not recognize
the significance of facts which amounted to a Funda
mental Standard violation, these facts might not be fully
and tairly litigatej. As a result, the hearing examiner
might find untrae, misleading or incomplete facts. We
recognize this problem, but feel the solution is not to
prevent the finding of lesser included offenses in Funda
mental Standard cases. Rather, it is to give the defendant
full opportunity and notice to litigate any fact which
may be important to the disposition of his case-a mat
ter to which we will return shortly.
THE PLEADING REQUIREMENTS OF THE CJP
Finally, our decision that lesser included offenses can
be shown in Fundamental Standard cases is buttressed
by another consideration. The major operative effect of
accepting defendant's position would be to force the
prosecutor, in drafting his charges in the future, to join
all of the possible factual elements he thought he might
be able to prove, separately and in combination as sepa
rate charges. This would be complicated enough in sim
ple Fundamental Standard cases. It would be even more
so where Disruption charges and Fundamental Standard
violations are joined-as they might have been in this
case. Disruptions, most of which—when they are not
within a justification defense—are probably also Funda
mental Standard violations, can overlap in complex ways
with Fundamental Standard violations.
There is not sufficient reason to place such a burden
of drafting upon the prosecutor, especially since in those
jurisdictions which have attempted to guarantee com
plete notice through pleading, the pleadings have be
come so prolix and confusing that they became an
obstruction to rational fact finding. Moreover, though
the vagueness of the Fundamental Standard may work
against the defense, the lack of weaponry given to the
prosecutor in our system works against him even more,
in attempting to learn with a high degree of precision the
facts of the events leading to his charge. Unlike the
prosecutor in the civil courts, the University administra
tion has no equivalent of a grand jury subpoena (indeed
it cannot even subpoena witnesses at trial). Moreover,
the prosecutor in the university system has no right to a
preliminary hearing which can permit the prosecutor in
the civil society to determine, to a much greater extent,
which facts he can and which he cannot prove at trial,
and hence to shape his charges better.
Indeed the issue of whether to allow lesser included
offenses in Fundamental Standard violations is only one
facet of a much larger problem—the purpose of the
charge in the CJP procedures. Although there are obvi
ously many analogies to the criminal law in our proce
dures—most obviously the requirement of a reasonable
doubt standard—these are not criminal cases. This is
made clear by the relatively limited nature of our sanc
tions, which-though we regard them as quite severe—are
hardly equal to those of the criminal courts; the fact
that consequences and procedures similar to ours are
used in obviously civil cases such as those involving
industrial relations and faculty discipline; and the prin
ciple that the major purpose of society is, in a sense to
enforce its law, while the major purposes for which the
University exists, and which control its allocations of
resources, are education and the advancement of know
ledge.
The purpose of the charge in our system is analogous
to that under the more modern civil rules. It is not what
is called "fact" or "issue" pleading, but is "notice"
pleading where the purpose of the charge is to specify
the general area for litigation while other devices are
relied upon to permit full and fair litigation of the facts.
In a civil case, it is quite common for one side or the
other to move at the end of trial to amend its pleadings
to conform to the evidence produced. This motion is
generally granted where no prejudice to the other party
is shown. Indeed, even in criminal cases prosecuted by
information (in which, as in the University, the prosecu
tor rather than a grand jury brings the charges) the
prosecutor may amend his pleading during trial to cover
any offense shown by the evidence.
It should be made clear that our view of the CJP
pleading requirements is as likely to benefit the defen
dant as the prosecutor. We must remember that the CJP
system recognizes within itself the concept of double
jeopardy and a defendant, once acquitted of a charge
before the CJP, cannot be retried on the same charge in
our system regardless of what new evidence of his guilt
the prosecutor can discover. Since that is the case, a
narrow construction of the charge will permit the prose
cutor to retry the defendant on a closely related but
different charge, while the view that the charge before us
is broader than that in the criminal law will more nar
rowly restrict the prosecutor in subsequent charges.
In the criminal system, the more narrowly defined
relationship between the words of the charge and the
crimes of which the defendant may be convicted can
have severe consequences to the defendant. In a criminal
case, where the defendant has burned down a building,
killing several of its occupants, the prosecutor can, in
almost all jurisdictions, convict him of one murder after
another based on the same fact situation, until the jury
returns the death sentence that the prosecutor desires.
Our rule prevents the vices of a narrow construction of
charges, and, if a consequence of preventing such abuse
is a broadening of the relation between the charge and
the evidence, we think that both in terms of fairness to
the defendant and accuracy in the fact-finding process, it
is the better choice.
THE REASON FOR REVERSAL
Our disagreement with the defendants on the allow
ance of lesser included offenses in Fundamental Stan
dard cases by no means settles this case, however. All we
have thus far held is that, if the hearing is a fair one, a
defendant charged with forcing one's way into a room
with a purpose to steal can be convicted of simply
forcing his way into the room-where the circumstances
are such that that act is also a violation of the Funda
mental Standard.
However, in this case, we feel that the hearing, insofar
as it purported to determine that Mr. Ho did in fact
force his way through the doors leading to the Faculty
Club kitchen, was not a fair one. We believe defense
counsels' assertions that, at the trial, they did not think

that Mr. Ho could be convicted of any lesser included
offense. It is likely, therefore that they did not attempt
fully to contest the facts which might support his con
viction on such an offense. Defense counsel claim, and
we believe, that they felt that they had the case won on
the issue of the defendant's purpose, and hence, that
they did not need to try very hard to show that the
defendant was not guilty of the other element charged—
forcing his way through the doors. Certainly, on this
record, we cannot assume that the defendants did not
have several witnesses whom they could have called to
raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the hearing
officer as to whether the defendant applied force to the
doors or aided or encouraged anyone else to do so.
In this case, we cannot say that the defense attorneys,
without the benefit of hindsight, were obviously wrong
on the rules as to lesser included offense in our system.
This is a new judicial system. It contains, inevitably,
many unclear points-at least until the Panel itself clari
fies them (and even then they become clear, not because
we are correct, but because it is our position in the
system to say what the rules should be). We note also
that even though we rule today that he had no such
duty, the prosecutor could in fact have obviated the
whole problem by additionally charging the forcing into
the kitchen as a separate offense or by joining a charge
of disruption along with that of the Fundamental Stan
dard violation. Moreover he could have simply stated
clearly his theory of the case to the defense counsel at
any point before the end of the hearing. Similarly,
though the hearing officer seems to have believed that
the lesser included offense doctrine was applicable in
this case, he, too, made no effort to make his opinion
clear to the defense.
THE POSSIBILITY OF A REMAND
Our decision that Mr. Ho cannot be convicted on this
record because of the possible prejudice to him in the
litigation of the facts, by no means determines the
disposition of this case The CJP procedures provide that
we may remand a case back to the hearing examiner for
additional findings should they be necessary, and cer
tainly this implies a right to remand the matter to him if
any of the findings which he actually made were not
properly litigated.
Indeed, this will be the proper course in most cases
assuming there are any such cases where the particular
facts and theories justifying conviction have not been
made clear to the defense during the hearing. The only
reason it cannot be done in the criminal courts is that
once the jury has rendered its verdict, the jurors cannot
be reassembled for further findings—both because of the
practical difficulties involved and because, in the inter
im, they may have been exposed to improper influences.
Interestingly enough, where a judge sits without a jury, a
procedure more analogous to ours, an appellate court
can return a case for further findings, or indeed, for the
reception of further evidence on the findings already
made.
This is the preferable means of disposition before the
CJP in any case where it is alleged that, for one reason or
another, there was not fair notice and that there was
such surprise to the defendants that they could not
properly litigate a question which turned out to be
important. This procedure protects the legitimate right
of the defendant to a proper and accurate finding of
fact; and insofar as a defendant may have been misled
into producing evidence, other than his own testimony,
which is in fact true, we do not regard this as a suffi
ciently unfortunate consequence of our decision to de
part from what, in every other way, is clearly the better
rule.
This is not to say that, in all cases, a difference
between the charge and the proof will make a remand to
the hearing officer the proper course. First, if the proof
bears absolutely no relation to the charge, the demands
of procedural regularity would require an acquittal of
the charge as the only proper course-leaving the prose
cutor to start all over again with the charge supported by
his evidence. Second, a remand may be prevented by a
showing or permanent prejudice to the defendant caused
by events subsequent to the surprise to him. If, for
instance, witnesses available-to the defendant at the first
hearing have, before a remand, disappeared or left the
area, the first issue may not be susceptible of fair litiga
tion, and a remand might not be proper.
THE REASONS FOR ACQUITTAL HERE
In the case at issue here, there is a very different, and
we trust quite unusual, reason not to remand the case to
the hearing officer. In this case, Mr. Ho has already
undergone eight hearings before the hearing examiner
and one before us. In another case involving an alleged
classroom disruption, he has undergone eleven hearings
before the hearing examiner and, so far as we can tell,
may have to endure another before us. Moreover, he has
recently been charged, together with nine others, with
disrupting a meeting of the Academic Council, a matter
which if our past experience is any guide, will consume a
great many hearings before the hearing examiner.
In this situation, a remand of this case to the hearing
examiner might well consume several more hearings at a
time when Mr. Ho was more than merely busy with
other cases against him. This would border upon harass
ment and our reluctance to inflict this upon Mr. Ho is
fortified by the fact that the remand would have been
necessitated without fault on his or his counsels' part,
and in a situation where the possibility of a remand to
the hearing examiner was, most likely, one which they
had never contemplated. Now that our procedures are
clearer in this matter, it is most unlikely that this parti
cular equity, presently working in Mr. Ho's behalf, will
occur again.
In any event, it is working in this particular case and
this is enough to make the difference. Accordingly, we
recommend that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case
be dropped.

Robert L. White
For the reasons we state below at some length, we
feel that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case should be
dismissed. Under the circumstances of this case, Mr. Ho
cannot be convicted of the violation of the Fundamental
Standard found in the hearing examiner's report, and a
remand to the hearing examiner for the cure of the
defect in the hearing before him is, under the facts of
this case, not a fair alternative.
The defendant, Mr. Ho, was charged before the Cam
pus Judicial Panel by the University administration with
a violation of the Fundamental Standard in two particu
lars: that he committed an assault and that he "together
with others, forced his way into the kitchen of the
Stanford Faculty Club for the purpose of stealing food
from that kitchen." The hearing examiner acquitted Mr.
Ho of the first charge, the assault. As to the second
charge, the hearing examiner found, in essence, that
though Mr. Ho had no purpose to steal food from the
kitchen, he had nonetheless helped force his way into
the kitchen. The specific findings of the hearing exam
iner (with their contexts in brackets) are:
3. 1 find that Mr. Ho was informed by responsible
officials of the Faculty Club, whose position of re
sponsibility was known to him, that he was not
allowed in the rear of the Club. [Past the doors which
led to the kitchen]
4. I find that Mr. Ho by words and gestures, encour
aged the persons in the dining area to assist him in
gaining access to the hallway [on the other side of
the doors]
5. I find that the double doors leading to the hallway
were opened in response to physical force exerted by
Mr. Ho and others, [and against the resistance of two
faculty club employees]
In short, Mr. Ho was found to have forced his way into
an area where he had been told by legitimate authority
that he had no business.
No justification for Mr. Ho's acts appearing, we have
no doubt that the hearing examiner's report makes out
what, at least in our opinion, is a clear violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The issue before us, however, is
not whether Mr. Ho is guilty, but whether he has been
properly and fairly found guilty under our procedures.
LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES IN GENERAL
The threshold issue in the determination of this case
is whether the Fundamental Standard violation proven
against Mr. Ho is one of which he could be convicted,
despite the failure of the prosecution to prove its allega
tion that Mr. Ho had committed his act with a purpose
to steal food. If it was not, we need proceed no further.
The prosecution alleges that defendant was properly
convicted under a "lesser included offense" theory. It is,
indeed, a general principle of law in criminal prosecu
tions that, if the prosecution charges that the defendant
did act A with an intent to accomplish Band the
prosecution proves that the defendant did act A but
cannot meet its burden of proof on the defendant's
intent to do B, the defendant may nonetheless be con
victed of doing act A-if that act is also, in itself, an
offense. Thus, if a defendant is charged with assault with
intent to kill and the prosecution cannot sustain its
burden as to the intent, the defendant may nonetheless
be convicted of the lesser included offense of assault
assuming, of course, that assault is an offense within the
legal system in question.
Indeed, the principle covers more than simply cases
where the prosecution is unable to prove an intent it has
charged. A defendant may be convicted of assault where
the prosecution has charged him with assault with a
deadly weapon. And if a defendant is charged with
drunken driving but the prosecution cannot prove that
he was actually driving, (either because he might have
been merely a passenger or because the car might have
been motionless) the defendant may, nonetheless, be
convicted of being drunk in an automobile-assuming, of
course, that under the law of that jurisdiction, (as is the
case in California), being drunk in an automobile is also
a punishable offense.
In short, in the criminal system at large, where a
defendant is charged with all the elements of an offense,
he is on notice that he must defend against any combina
tion of these factual elements which also is punishable.
One of the issues before us in this case is whether this is
the proper rule before the CJP, as well.
THE BURGLARY ANALOGY
Defense counsel make two basic arguments on this
issue. First, they argue that the original charge at issue
here, entering a room with intent to commit an offense
therein, is very much like the charges lodged in the local
courts for violation of the California burglary statute.
Since, under California law, burglary has no lesser
included offenses (except, of course, attempted bur
glary), defendant argues that the same rule should pre
vail before the CJP. In other words, since we are reason
ing by analogy here, defendant claims that the analogy
to the specific California burglary rule should prevail
before the CJP over the more general analogy to the
failure to prove an intent charged.
We do not find this argument persuasive. The reason
why the California burglary statute has no lesser
included offense is simply that the act of entering a
room or building is not illegal at all, unless it occurs
together with the forbidden intent. Hence, unless the
prosecution can show that intent, the defendant is guilty
of no wrongful conduct whatsoever. Interestingly, in
most states, where burglary requires a breaking and
entering as well as an intent, the crime does have a lesser
included offense, "breaking and entering." Here, where
entirely apart from any purpose to steal, the act of the
defendant, under the circumstances of this case, would
seem to us to be a clear violation of the Fundamental
Standard, the analogy to the California burglary statute
appears inapposite.

LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES
IN FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD CASES
The second contention of the defendant on this issue
is more troublesome The defendant would have us hold,
on much broader grounds, that the lesser included offen
se doctrine can never apply to Fundamental Standard
violations. Defense counsel contend that where the pros
ecution charges facts amounting to a Fundamental Stan
dard violation, but does not prove all of those facts, the
prosecution cannot prevail, even though the lesser facts
it has proven also amount to Fundamental Standard
violation.
THE PROBLEM OF SURPRISE
Defendant's argument is premised in part on the lact
that the Fundamental Standard is so broad that a defen
dant attempting to meet a charge of its violation is
vulnerable to surprise at the hearing through the intro
duction of facts and issues he is unprepared to meet.
Defendant recognizes, as he must, that no frontal attack
upon the Fundamental Standard is possible. After all, it
has been a part of University law since the time of David
Starr Jordan. The defense earnestly contends, however,
that the allowance of a lesser included offense within a
Fundamental Standard charge compounds unduly what
is a built-in problem in the administration of such a
broad rule.
This facet of the defense argument is considerably
weakened by the alternative remedy available to defen
dants under the CJP procedures. Indeed, the CJP proce
dures can be far better adapted to protecting a defen
dant against surprise than can those of the outside soci
ety. In the criminal trial, a defendant who is surprised by
the prosecution's introduction of an issue cannot have
the jury kept together for an appreciable time while he
attempts to find new evidence to meet the prosecution's
evidence. Under the CJP system, the remedy to avoid
any surprise is simply the right of the party to ask the
hearing officer for sufficient time to produce his evi
dence. We cannot conceive of any reasonable continu
ance being denied by a hearing officer in a situation
where a claim of surprise or lack of notice is made in
good faith. And, if such a request for reasonable contin
uance is denied, the claim of prejudice due to lack of
notice is raisable before this Panel, as well.
Defendant's complaint as to the Fundamental Stan
dard, however, is broader than merely that its vagueness
offers insufficient protection against surprise at trial.
The defense's complaint is that uncertainty in exactly
what constitutes a Fundamental Standard violation
places the defense in jeopardy in other ways.
First of all, we should distinguish this argument from
another quite different one which sounds somewhat
similar. The defendant is not here contending that he
should be acquitted because the Fundamental Standard
is so vague that he did not know that what he was doing
in the Faculty Club was in violation of University law.
To be sure, at its outer edges the Fundamental Standard
is extremely murky, but a defendant whose acts are a
clear violation cannot raise the fact that others might
violate the Standard unwittingly. Indeed, the issue is not
whether the defendant knew his actions were in viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard, but whether he
should have known.
THE RIGHT NOT TO HELP THE PROSECUTION
However, it is in part because of the fact that a
student can be guilty of a Fundamental Standard viola
tion even though he believes he is correct and the com
munity judgment wrong, that we must pay particular
attention to defense counsel's argument on this issue.
The claim in essence is that the minimal limits of the
Fundamental Standard are so indefinite that a defendant
may be unable to meet a charge of Fundamental Stand
ard violation without, perhaps, helping the prosecution
prove some lesser included offense.
It is not a complete answer to this to say that in order
for discipline to be imposed, the Fundamental Standard
violation must be clear to us. It is quite conceivable that
a defense attorney, with values similar to those of his
client, might not appreciate that certain actions did
constitute a Fundamental Standard violation clear to the
rest of the community. In such a case, he might indeed
unwittingly help the prosecution prove its case.
For the most part, however, we do not apprehend
that this difficulty faced by a defendant is a sympathetic
one considering the structure of our proceedings and the
protections the defendant does have. The basic purpose
of the hearing before the examiner is to find out the
facts—who did what, when and where, with what state
of mind. Certainly, the hearing examiner must perform
his function in a way fair to the defendant and giving
full effect to any specific rights provided by our rules.
The hearing before the hearing examiner, however, is not
a game. The defendant certainly has the right to put the
prosecution to its proof, but if he helps prow the facts
which actually exist, we cannot regard this as a disadvan
tage of the CJP procedures.
In one situation, however, the defendant's fear of
helping the prosecution prove its case is entitled to
recognition. Our rules give a defendant a specific right
not to testify and we should give this right a broad
scope. Part of such a scope is to make sure that a
defendant, in exercising his right, fully appreciates the
consequences to himself. Accordingly, should a defen
dant admit at the hearing facts which he may not appre
ciate constitute a violation, he should be warned that
this is the case and be given an opportunity to withdraw
his statement before his conviction can be founded on
his testimony. If he does withdraw his admission and
does not within the scope of cross examination repeat it,
his statement may not be considered against him by the
hearing officer or this Panel.
This rule, however, is not determinative of this case.
The (act is that, rather than admitting the lesser included
offense alleged by the prosecutor here as a basis for
conviction, Mr. Ho denied that he had exerted any force
on the door.
THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE ALL FACTS
Another facet ot defendant's argument is also related
to the possibility of failure to appreciate facts showing a
Fundamental Standard violation. Defendant argues that

because a defendant and his counsel might not recognize
the significance of facts which amounted to a Funda
mental Standard violation, these facts might not be fully
and tairly litigatej. As a result, the hearing examiner
might find untrae, misleading or incomplete facts. We
recognize this problem, but feel the solution is not to
prevent the finding of lesser included offenses in Funda
mental Standard cases. Rather, it is to give the defendant
full opportunity and notice to litigate any fact which
may be important to the disposition of his case-a mat
ter to which we will return shortly.
THE PLEADING REQUIREMENTS OF THE CJP
Finally, our decision that lesser included offenses can
be shown in Fundamental Standard cases is buttressed
by another consideration. The major operative effect of
accepting defendant's position would be to force the
prosecutor, in drafting his charges in the future, to join
all of the possible factual elements he thought he might
be able to prove, separately and in combination as sepa
rate charges. This would be complicated enough in sim
ple Fundamental Standard cases. It would be even more
so where Disruption charges and Fundamental Standard
violations are joined-as they might have been in this
case. Disruptions, most of which—when they are not
within a justification defense—are probably also Funda
mental Standard violations, can overlap in complex ways
with Fundamental Standard violations.
There is not sufficient reason to place such a burden
of drafting upon the prosecutor, especially since in those
jurisdictions which have attempted to guarantee com
plete notice through pleading, the pleadings have be
come so prolix and confusing that they became an
obstruction to rational fact finding. Moreover, though
the vagueness of the Fundamental Standard may work
against the defense, the lack of weaponry given to the
prosecutor in our system works against him even more,
in attempting to learn with a high degree of precision the
facts of the events leading to his charge. Unlike the
prosecutor in the civil courts, the University administra
tion has no equivalent of a grand jury subpoena (indeed
it cannot even subpoena witnesses at trial). Moreover,
the prosecutor in the university system has no right to a
preliminary hearing which can permit the prosecutor in
the civil society to determine, to a much greater extent,
which facts he can and which he cannot prove at trial,
and hence to shape his charges better.
Indeed the issue of whether to allow lesser included
offenses in Fundamental Standard violations is only one
facet of a much larger problem—the purpose of the
charge in the CJP procedures. Although there are obvi
ously many analogies to the criminal law in our proce
dures—most obviously the requirement of a reasonable
doubt standard—these are not criminal cases. This is
made clear by the relatively limited nature of our sanc
tions, which-though we regard them as quite severe—are
hardly equal to those of the criminal courts; the fact
that consequences and procedures similar to ours are
used in obviously civil cases such as those involving
industrial relations and faculty discipline; and the prin
ciple that the major purpose of society is, in a sense to
enforce its law, while the major purposes for which the
University exists, and which control its allocations of
resources, are education and the advancement of know
ledge.
The purpose of the charge in our system is analogous
to that under the more modern civil rules. It is not what
is called "fact" or "issue" pleading, but is "notice"
pleading where the purpose of the charge is to specify
the general area for litigation while other devices are
relied upon to permit full and fair litigation of the facts.
In a civil case, it is quite common for one side or the
other to move at the end of trial to amend its pleadings
to conform to the evidence produced. This motion is
generally granted where no prejudice to the other party
is shown. Indeed, even in criminal cases prosecuted by
information (in which, as in the University, the prosecu
tor rather than a grand jury brings the charges) the
prosecutor may amend his pleading during trial to cover
any offense shown by the evidence.
It should be made clear that our view of the CJP
pleading requirements is as likely to benefit the defen
dant as the prosecutor. We must remember that the CJP
system recognizes within itself the concept of double
jeopardy and a defendant, once acquitted of a charge
before the CJP, cannot be retried on the same charge in
our system regardless of what new evidence of his guilt
the prosecutor can discover. Since that is the case, a
narrow construction of the charge will permit the prose
cutor to retry the defendant on a closely related but
different charge, while the view that the charge before us
is broader than that in the criminal law will more nar
rowly restrict the prosecutor in subsequent charges.
In the criminal system, the more narrowly defined
relationship between the words of the charge and the
crimes of which the defendant may be convicted can
have severe consequences to the defendant. In a criminal
case, where the defendant has burned down a building,
killing several of its occupants, the prosecutor can, in
almost all jurisdictions, convict him of one murder after
another based on the same fact situation, until the jury
returns the death sentence that the prosecutor desires.
Our rule prevents the vices of a narrow construction of
charges, and, if a consequence of preventing such abuse
is a broadening of the relation between the charge and
the evidence, we think that both in terms of fairness to
the defendant and accuracy in the fact-finding process, it
is the better choice.
THE REASON FOR REVERSAL
Our disagreement with the defendants on the allow
ance of lesser included offenses in Fundamental Stan
dard cases by no means settles this case, however. All we
have thus far held is that, if the hearing is a fair one, a
defendant charged with forcing one's way into a room
with a purpose to steal can be convicted of simply
forcing his way into the room-where the circumstances
are such that that act is also a violation of the Funda
mental Standard.
However, in this case, we feel that the hearing, insofar
as it purported to determine that Mr. Ho did in fact
force his way through the doors leading to the Faculty
Club kitchen, was not a fair one. We believe defense
counsels' assertions that, at the trial, they did not think

that Mr. Ho could be convicted of any lesser included
offense. It is likely, therefore that they did not attempt
fully to contest the facts which might support his con
viction on such an offense. Defense counsel claim, and
we believe, that they felt that they had the case won on
the issue of the defendant's purpose, and hence, that
they did not need to try very hard to show that the
defendant was not guilty of the other element charged—
forcing his way through the doors. Certainly, on this
record, we cannot assume that the defendants did not
have several witnesses whom they could have called to
raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the hearing
officer as to whether the defendant applied force to the
doors or aided or encouraged anyone else to do so.
In this case, we cannot say that the defense attorneys,
without the benefit of hindsight, were obviously wrong
on the rules as to lesser included offense in our system.
This is a new judicial system. It contains, inevitably,
many unclear points-at least until the Panel itself clari
fies them (and even then they become clear, not because
we are correct, but because it is our position in the
system to say what the rules should be). We note also
that even though we rule today that he had no such
duty, the prosecutor could in fact have obviated the
whole problem by additionally charging the forcing into
the kitchen as a separate offense or by joining a charge
of disruption along with that of the Fundamental Stan
dard violation. Moreover he could have simply stated
clearly his theory of the case to the defense counsel at
any point before the end of the hearing. Similarly,
though the hearing officer seems to have believed that
the lesser included offense doctrine was applicable in
this case, he, too, made no effort to make his opinion
clear to the defense.
THE POSSIBILITY OF A REMAND
Our decision that Mr. Ho cannot be convicted on this
record because of the possible prejudice to him in the
litigation of the facts, by no means determines the
disposition of this case The CJP procedures provide that
we may remand a case back to the hearing examiner for
additional findings should they be necessary, and cer
tainly this implies a right to remand the matter to him if
any of the findings which he actually made were not
properly litigated.
Indeed, this will be the proper course in most cases
assuming there are any such cases where the particular
facts and theories justifying conviction have not been
made clear to the defense during the hearing. The only
reason it cannot be done in the criminal courts is that
once the jury has rendered its verdict, the jurors cannot
be reassembled for further findings—both because of the
practical difficulties involved and because, in the inter
im, they may have been exposed to improper influences.
Interestingly enough, where a judge sits without a jury, a
procedure more analogous to ours, an appellate court
can return a case for further findings, or indeed, for the
reception of further evidence on the findings already
made.
This is the preferable means of disposition before the
CJP in any case where it is alleged that, for one reason or
another, there was not fair notice and that there was
such surprise to the defendants that they could not
properly litigate a question which turned out to be
important. This procedure protects the legitimate right
of the defendant to a proper and accurate finding of
fact; and insofar as a defendant may have been misled
into producing evidence, other than his own testimony,
which is in fact true, we do not regard this as a suffi
ciently unfortunate consequence of our decision to de
part from what, in every other way, is clearly the better
rule.
This is not to say that, in all cases, a difference
between the charge and the proof will make a remand to
the hearing officer the proper course. First, if the proof
bears absolutely no relation to the charge, the demands
of procedural regularity would require an acquittal of
the charge as the only proper course-leaving the prose
cutor to start all over again with the charge supported by
his evidence. Second, a remand may be prevented by a
showing or permanent prejudice to the defendant caused
by events subsequent to the surprise to him. If, for
instance, witnesses available-to the defendant at the first
hearing have, before a remand, disappeared or left the
area, the first issue may not be susceptible of fair litiga
tion, and a remand might not be proper.
THE REASONS FOR ACQUITTAL HERE
In the case at issue here, there is a very different, and
we trust quite unusual, reason not to remand the case to
the hearing officer. In this case, Mr. Ho has already
undergone eight hearings before the hearing examiner
and one before us. In another case involving an alleged
classroom disruption, he has undergone eleven hearings
before the hearing examiner and, so far as we can tell,
may have to endure another before us. Moreover, he has
recently been charged, together with nine others, with
disrupting a meeting of the Academic Council, a matter
which if our past experience is any guide, will consume a
great many hearings before the hearing examiner.
In this situation, a remand of this case to the hearing
examiner might well consume several more hearings at a
time when Mr. Ho was more than merely busy with
other cases against him. This would border upon harass
ment and our reluctance to inflict this upon Mr. Ho is
fortified by the fact that the remand would have been
necessitated without fault on his or his counsels' part,
and in a situation where the possibility of a remand to
the hearing examiner was, most likely, one which they
had never contemplated. Now that our procedures are
clearer in this matter, it is most unlikely that this parti
cular equity, presently working in Mr. Ho's behalf, will
occur again.
In any event, it is working in this particular case and
this is enough to make the difference. Accordingly, we
recommend that the charge against Mr. Ho in this case
be dropped.
