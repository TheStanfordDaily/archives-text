# Encina Shutdown Planned
## Strike Action Starts Today 
### SCOTT THACHER 
Many students will be striking on
campus today to protest the escalated
bombing of North Vietnam. Plans have
been made to block the entrances of
Encina Hall, several research labs, and
several large classes.
Demonstrators planned to stop
employees from entering Encina this
morning at 6:30 a.m., while several
dormitories and student groups in
academic departments have proposed
less militant tactics. Planned activities
range from political campaigning to
teach-ins. A rally will be held at noon
at White Plaza.
A memorandum advised employees
in Durand and the Electronics
Research Laboratories to take today
off if they were blocked from their
offices by protesters and could not
enter peacefully.
'Defend Decisions'
President Richard Lyman, who
recently voiced strong opposition to
any strike which would close the
University, said yesterday that
Stanford will "do everything it can to
defend people's decisions and personal
choices about going to classes."
A few professors of large lecture
classes announced plans to give no
formal lectures today.
At the largest departmental meeting
on campus yesterday, a majority of
175 law students endorsed a series of
"non-coercive" protests at the Law

School, while political science
graduate students voted to halt the
normal functioning of their
department.
Columbae residents pledged to stop
"the war business of Stanford
University," while meetings at other
dorms, including Roble, Toyon, Serra,
Muir, Burbank, and Donner voted
support of the strike.
Bail Fund
While the ASSU Senate endorsed
the upcoming strike at its weekly
meeting last night, the Council of
Presidents announced it is making
available a bail fund for those Stanford
students who might be arrested today.
Twenty library employees met
yesterday at noon to plan
informational pickets today, while the
Faculty Political Action Group
decided to support the strike without
taking a position on preventing
students from going to class.
Members of several departments
indicated support of the strike,
including the History, Mathematics,
French and Italian, English, Latin
American Studies, East Asian Studies,
and Asian Languages departments.
Supporters of Sen. George
McGovern, a contender in California's
June presidential primary, have 15,000
leaflets, explaining his most recent
attack on the bombing of North
Vietnam, ready to pass out at the gates
of local plants today.

Anticipating a possible closing of
Encina Hall today, payroll checks for
this period were delivered to the
different departments in Encina
yesterday afternoon. Other employees
will receive their checks this morning.
A group of first-year law students
have begun a petition drive to all of
the nation's 148 law schools to protest
the increased bombing in Vietnam.
Stanford Law Professors Herbert
Packer and Anthony Amsterdam are
co-chairmen of the drive, which has
received the endorsement of Law
School Dean Thomas Ehrlich, as well
as deans at Harvard, Yale,
Pennsylvania, Arizona, UCLA, and
U.C. Davis.
