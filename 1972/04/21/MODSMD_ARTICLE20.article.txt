# Laury Claims Harassment
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
When the highway patrolman
stepped on his head, as Chris
Laury tells it, it became obvious
that the officer "had some
indication who I was."
The black activist charges that
during the last year other
policemen who "knew who I was"
have stopped his car and ticketed
him for everything from bald tires
to the wrong address on his
driver's license.
"If you make enough waves,
they'll try to rip you off," Laury
says, and he charges he is the
victim of a police harassment
campaign aimed at keeping him in
jail and courts and "away from
doing work in the community."
One San Mateo Sheriff's
deputy confirmed that police have
stopped Laury "all over the
county," although he insisted the
"routine checks" may well stem
from suspicious driving behavior.
Laury, 22, has already lost his
driver's license because of the long
list of vehicle charges. But he also
insists that more serious charges
against him are false — including,
most recently, a burglary charge
stemming from the Jan. 24
Faculty Club "eat-in."
Laury admits he and four black
friends briefly visited the Faculty

Club protest. But he denies the
charge that he stole $1,100 in
silverware, china, and candlelabras
from the building.
Faced with a possible one to
five year prison sentence on the
charge, Laury explains that he
cannot afford a lawyer and that
he refuses to use a public defender
because they "have a habit of
getting clients convicted." Laury
and his supporters are mounting a
fund-drive at Stanford to support
his defense.
Active in "Black Action" and
other radical groups pledged to
"self-determination," Laury has a
tough style brought from the
Harlem Streets where he grew up.
Beneath a wide-brimmed hat and
behind sunglasses, the tired look
on his face is a sign of the heroin
addiction he overcame before
leaving New York two years ago.
Now, using the group methods
which others used to cure his
addiction, Laury works as a
counselor in a Redwood City drug
rehabilitation program.
Laury said that middle-class
whites view him through
"stereotypes" because even his
clothes are a "reflection of
another class background. They
say that I look like a hoodlum or
gangster or whatever, without any

investigation of what I'm doing."
Although Laury has been
active in black radical
organizations in East Palo Alto
and Redwood City, he said his
police troubles are all "a direct
result of being involved in the
hospital thing." He was a
well-known activist in last spring's
protests at Stanford Hospital, and
he says he came on campus
because "black workers were
getting jammed out here."
In December, Laury and
former BSU leader Leo Bazile
were acquitted on charges that
they had beaten a white hospital
worker in May, during the
hospital protests. The trial went
on even though the alleged victim
was unable to identify Laury in
the courtroom.
Soon after Laury's arrest on
the beating charge, police seized
an arsenal of guns and
ammunition in a raid on his home,
which also served as headquarters
for the militant Black Liberation
Front.
A week later, Laury and Sam
Bridges, the black worker whose
firing touched off the hospital
protests, were arrested in Santa
Rosa on marijuana possession
charges. Laury pleaded guilty,

although he maintains that he did
so only because he was freed on
probation in return for the guilty
plea.
In August, Laury was arrested
by San Mateo Sheriff's Deputies
in East Palo Alto — he says

because he declined to approve an
illegal search of his car. He charges
he was beaten by police during his
arrest and in a jailhouse elevator.
Sheriff's spokesmen said they
have received no formal complaint
on that allegation.
