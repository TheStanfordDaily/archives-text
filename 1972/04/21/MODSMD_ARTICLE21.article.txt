# 'Such Good Friends'
## High Quality Preminger 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Generally overlooked during its
brief initial engagements and
currently on the Market Street
circuit is Otto Preminger's "Such
Good Friends." I've alwavo had
decidedly mixed feelings about
Otto, as I never really thought
"Hurry Sundown" and "Junie
Moon" to be all that bad but
never regarded "Laura" and
"Bunny Lake Is Missing" as all
that great. However, "Bonjour
Tristesse" and "Anatomy of a
Murder" are minor masterpieces
of atmosphere, form and
behavioral charm and "Such Good
Friends" may even be my favorite
Preminger yet.
This film deals with a world
that the director may know better
than any other, the upper-middle
class of the so-called beautiful and
swinging people who inhabit the
East and now West side of New
York's Central Park. The men are
doctors, writers, advertising
executives and photographers and
the women are generally as
fucked-up as can be, betraying
their probable previous careers as
Vassar students and fashion
models.
Apparently, Lois Gould's novel
was written from the highly
subjective point of view of Julie
Messenger, an approaching
middle-age wife who, while her
husband slowly deteriorates and
dies from absurd malpractice in
the hospital, learns of her mate's
rampant infidelity with all her

close friends. The implied
subjectivity and sympathy of the
situation, combined with
Preminger's intimate knowledge
of the milieu, might suggest that
"Such Good Friends" is an
intensely subjective work.
Personal it may be, but not for
the expected reasons that the
director imposes his feelings,
thoughts and biases on the action.
Rather, Preminger imposes his
impartiality and unblinking eye
on everyone and everything and
thus tells what is essentially a
subjective story from an
unyieldingly objective point of
view. This approach, of course,
has its limitations, if only in the
realm of psychological complexity
and character identification, but
in this case it creates a mature
distance on the often adolescent
behavior of the characters while at
the same time making that
behavior extremely funny for the
audience.
While clearly belonging to the
world he exposes, Preminger also
disengages himself enough from it
so as not to implicate himself in
all of its vices. A mammy-style
black maid and the blatant sexism
of a Madison Avenue ad agency
can be matter-of-factly presented
and escape uncondemned simply
because these are facts of life, like
all the rest, that happen to rest
within Preminger's field of vision.
"Such Good Friends" is most
successful in its humor. The
opening scene with a writer
(played by a sagging Burgess
Meredith) prancing around during

a rooftop cocktail party covered
by nothing but his latest book in
front of his crotch, has been
ridiculed by some, but it is
actually a very funny surreal
fantasy presented in a very
straightforward fashion.
Only a fraction of the film
takes place in the hospital, but all
these scenes are devastatingly
good and contain more laughs
than the whole of "The Hospital."
Perhaps best of all is the sequence
in which Julie's a la mode friends,
having rushed to the hospital to
donate blood for her husband,
turn the occasion into yet another
cocktail party.
Preminger's most remarkable
accomplishment in "Such Good
Friends" is the result he achieves
from an attractive but essentially
limited cast. As Julie, Dyan
Cannon appears in almost every
scene and, had Preminger persued
the psychological approach, this
would have proved a major
liability. As it stands, she is
merely adequate, although
occasionally effective in scenes
such as the bed-time talk she has
with her husband on the last night
she spends with him. For the most
part, however, Preminger
recognizes that her greatest asset
is not to be found in her acting.
Jennifer O'Neill is beautiful
again and Ken Howard is better
than he was in "Junie Moon" but
real honors go to James Coco and
especially Laurence Luckinbill.
Luckinbill, who was so finely
understated in"Boys in the
Band," is, like Brando in "The

Godfather," laid up out of sight in
a hospital for most of the film.
Yet he makes such a strong
impression in his few scenes that
his presence looms over the rest of
the action and somehow everyone
seems a little less important after
he has died. As for Coco, he draws
praise even from the film's
detractors for a scene in which,
anticipating seduction by Dyan
Cannon, he tries to slip out of his
girdle wihtout her noticing.
(A local note on "Such Good
Friends" is that Cindy Weber,
who wrote some film criticism for
the Daily a couple of years back,
left for New York last spring
intending to work as an assistant
to Preminger on the production.
She receives no screen credit and
no one here has heard of her
since. If any readers have, we'd
appreciate a note.)
