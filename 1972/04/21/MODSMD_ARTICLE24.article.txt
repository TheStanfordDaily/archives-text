GEORGE CARLIN
m
FM & AM — George Carlin —
Little David — LD7214
Ji, George Cariin is not the kind
)(Of comedian most grandmothers
j,would enjoy. But this album isn't
~aimed at little old ladies. It is
H aimed at the so-called "hip,"
under-30 crowd which Carlin has
quite a following in, and this
•album is bound to swell the ranks
, of his fans.
The "AM" side includes much
of the material Carlin has done in
his many television appearances.
Included here are his take-off on
"Let's Make A Deal," and his
classic parody of game shows in
"Divorce Game." He
continues his assault on the
content of electronic media with
'The 11 O'Clock News," and a
parody of Top-40 radio called "Son
of Wino."
The "FM" side is made up of
some of George's more
pieces. One
routine which he will probably
never perform on TV or AM radio
is a cut on the use of the word
?'shit" in our society. He also does
a great piece on sex in
commercials, drugs in general and
birth control pills.
On "Birth Control," Carlin
talks about the day when birth
control pills will be sold at the
corner drug store and he suggests
some possible trademarks
including "Embry-No," "Papa
Stopper," "Mom Bomb,"
"Inconceivable," "Nay Family
Way," and for those with a sense
of chance, "Maybe Baby."
Carlin is undeniably one of the
brightest new stars in the area of
sophisticated comedy, an area
which has been becoming quite
stale recently. He takes timely,
sharp and very satiric, but most
importantly, very funny, shots at
everyday things which reflect our
society quite well.
His insights into some of the
farcical aspects of television, radio,
advertising and the drug industry
are quite acute. And his parody
on the use of the word "shit" in
our society is sure to become a
classic comedy piece. To sum up
my opinion of this album, I'll
have to quote something George
says in that very parody, "It's
good shit."

DELANEY & BONNIE
D&B Together — Delaney &

Bonnie and Friends — Columbia —
KC31377
This is a very fine,
easy-listening kind of rock and
roll album. Almost every cut on it
is good. I kind of doubt the
wisdom of including "Superstar,"
the Carpenter's 45 hit, but
Bonnie's obviously satirical
attempt at an over-sexy and
over-sultry voice is kind of funny.
Other than that, it is a
completely well-done album.
Bonnie is the better vocalist of the
two and her range is quite wide as
she moves easily from a Tina
Turner type-voice on a rocker
called "Sound Of The City," to a
very sad, blues voice on "I Know
How It Feels To Be Lonely."
Delaney also has a fairly good
voice and when they are singing
together, as on their 45 hit "Move
'Em Out," their voices blend
together nicely.
Delaney and Bonnie are good
singers, but what really makes this
album outstanding is the
instrumental work backing up
their vocals. Most of you have
probably heard their other 45 hit
on the album, "Only You Know
and I Know,"and you'll probably
remember the talented organ and
horn work on this cut.
That high instrumental quality
is maintained throughout the
album with a number of good
horn and organ passages which
stand out, as well as some very
good guitar and percussions work.
An appropriate gauge to the range
of this album is the final cut,
"Country Life," a Country &
Western song which features some
nice singing by Delaney and some
fine steel guitar and fiddle work
by the Friends. All in all, it's a
most enjoyable album.

JIMMIE SPHEERIS
Isle of View — Jimmie Spheeris —
Columbia — C 30988
Will the real Jimmie Spheeris'
voice please sing a few bars? It's
obvious that a folk singer won't
be too successful singing in a
monotone, but Spheeris tries so
many different styles of vocal
delivery that it greatly detracts
from this album.
Spheeris wrote most of the
cuts and the lyrics are by and
large quite good. But his constant
attempts to try different vocal
styles doesn't work and it greatly
lessens the impact of the material.

On two cuts, "Let It Flow"
and "Seven Virgins," he sings in a
natural way, as he should all the
time. "Let It Flow" is a beautiful
love song which really does gently
flow over you. And "Virgins" is a
very good folk-rocker.
But on almost all the other
cuts, Spheeris variates from the
sound vocal style he demonstrates
on these two cuts. At times he
sounds like an over-nasalized
Harry Nillson. And all too often
he begins to breath heavily or gasp

for air, like an asthmatic. On one
cut, I even detect a hint of Neil
Diamond.
Singers always face the
temptation of trying very hard to
imitate other artists. Spheeris
unfortunately seems to have
yielded to this temptation and it's
too bad since on "Let It Flow"
and "Virgins" he shows that he
has a good voice and style of his
own. Hopefully in future recorded
efforts, he'll just "Let It Flow."

)(Of comedian most grandmothers
j,would enjoy. But this album isn't
~aimed at little old ladies. It is
H aimed at the so-called "hip,"
under-30 crowd which Carlin has
quite a following in, and this
•album is bound to swell the ranks
, of his fans.
The "AM" side includes much
of the material Carlin has done in
his many television appearances.
Included here are his take-off on
"Let's Make A Deal," and his
classic parody of game shows in
"Divorce Game." He
continues his assault on the
content of electronic media with
'The 11 O'Clock News," and a
parody of Top-40 radio called "Son
of Wino."
The "FM" side is made up of
some of George's more
pieces. One
routine which he will probably
never perform on TV or AM radio
is a cut on the use of the word
?'shit" in our society. He also does
a great piece on sex in
commercials, drugs in general and
birth control pills.
On "Birth Control," Carlin
talks about the day when birth
control pills will be sold at the
corner drug store and he suggests
some possible trademarks
including "Embry-No," "Papa
Stopper," "Mom Bomb,"
"Inconceivable," "Nay Family
Way," and for those with a sense
of chance, "Maybe Baby."
Carlin is undeniably one of the
brightest new stars in the area of
sophisticated comedy, an area
which has been becoming quite
stale recently. He takes timely,
sharp and very satiric, but most
importantly, very funny, shots at
everyday things which reflect our
society quite well.
His insights into some of the
farcical aspects of television, radio,
advertising and the drug industry
are quite acute. And his parody
on the use of the word "shit" in
our society is sure to become a
classic comedy piece. To sum up
my opinion of this album, I'll
have to quote something George
says in that very parody, "It's
good shit."

DELANEY & BONNIE
D&B Together — Delaney &

Bonnie and Friends — Columbia —
KC31377
This is a very fine,
easy-listening kind of rock and
roll album. Almost every cut on it
is good. I kind of doubt the
wisdom of including "Superstar,"
the Carpenter's 45 hit, but
Bonnie's obviously satirical
attempt at an over-sexy and
over-sultry voice is kind of funny.
Other than that, it is a
completely well-done album.
Bonnie is the better vocalist of the
two and her range is quite wide as
she moves easily from a Tina
Turner type-voice on a rocker
called "Sound Of The City," to a
very sad, blues voice on "I Know
How It Feels To Be Lonely."
Delaney also has a fairly good
voice and when they are singing
together, as on their 45 hit "Move
'Em Out," their voices blend
together nicely.
Delaney and Bonnie are good
singers, but what really makes this
album outstanding is the
instrumental work backing up
their vocals. Most of you have
probably heard their other 45 hit
on the album, "Only You Know
and I Know,"and you'll probably
remember the talented organ and
horn work on this cut.
That high instrumental quality
is maintained throughout the
album with a number of good
horn and organ passages which
stand out, as well as some very
good guitar and percussions work.
An appropriate gauge to the range
of this album is the final cut,
"Country Life," a Country &
Western song which features some
nice singing by Delaney and some
fine steel guitar and fiddle work
by the Friends. All in all, it's a
most enjoyable album.

JIMMIE SPHEERIS
Isle of View — Jimmie Spheeris —
Columbia — C 30988
Will the real Jimmie Spheeris'
voice please sing a few bars? It's
obvious that a folk singer won't
be too successful singing in a
monotone, but Spheeris tries so
many different styles of vocal
delivery that it greatly detracts
from this album.
Spheeris wrote most of the
cuts and the lyrics are by and
large quite good. But his constant
attempts to try different vocal
styles doesn't work and it greatly
lessens the impact of the material.

On two cuts, "Let It Flow"
and "Seven Virgins," he sings in a
natural way, as he should all the
time. "Let It Flow" is a beautiful
love song which really does gently
flow over you. And "Virgins" is a
very good folk-rocker.
But on almost all the other
cuts, Spheeris variates from the
sound vocal style he demonstrates
on these two cuts. At times he
sounds like an over-nasalized
Harry Nillson. And all too often
he begins to breath heavily or gasp

for air, like an asthmatic. On one
cut, I even detect a hint of Neil
Diamond.
Singers always face the
temptation of trying very hard to
imitate other artists. Spheeris
unfortunately seems to have
yielded to this temptation and it's
too bad since on "Let It Flow"
and "Virgins" he shows that he
has a good voice and style of his
own. Hopefully in future recorded
efforts, he'll just "Let It Flow."

H aimed at the so-called "hip,"
under-30 crowd which Carlin has
quite a following in, and this
•album is bound to swell the ranks
, of his fans.
The "AM" side includes much
of the material Carlin has done in
his many television appearances.
Included here are his take-off on
"Let's Make A Deal," and his
classic parody of game shows in
"Divorce Game." He
continues his assault on the
content of electronic media with
'The 11 O'Clock News," and a
parody of Top-40 radio called "Son
of Wino."
The "FM" side is made up of
some of George's more
pieces. One
routine which he will probably
never perform on TV or AM radio
is a cut on the use of the word
?'shit" in our society. He also does
a great piece on sex in
commercials, drugs in general and
birth control pills.
On "Birth Control," Carlin
talks about the day when birth
control pills will be sold at the
corner drug store and he suggests
some possible trademarks
including "Embry-No," "Papa
Stopper," "Mom Bomb,"
"Inconceivable," "Nay Family
Way," and for those with a sense
of chance, "Maybe Baby."
Carlin is undeniably one of the
brightest new stars in the area of
sophisticated comedy, an area
which has been becoming quite
stale recently. He takes timely,
sharp and very satiric, but most
importantly, very funny, shots at
everyday things which reflect our
society quite well.
His insights into some of the
farcical aspects of television, radio,
advertising and the drug industry
are quite acute. And his parody
on the use of the word "shit" in
our society is sure to become a
classic comedy piece. To sum up
my opinion of this album, I'll
have to quote something George
says in that very parody, "It's
good shit."

DELANEY & BONNIE
D&B Together — Delaney &

Bonnie and Friends — Columbia —
KC31377
This is a very fine,
easy-listening kind of rock and
roll album. Almost every cut on it
is good. I kind of doubt the
wisdom of including "Superstar,"
the Carpenter's 45 hit, but
Bonnie's obviously satirical
attempt at an over-sexy and
over-sultry voice is kind of funny.
Other than that, it is a
completely well-done album.
Bonnie is the better vocalist of the
two and her range is quite wide as
she moves easily from a Tina
Turner type-voice on a rocker
called "Sound Of The City," to a
very sad, blues voice on "I Know
How It Feels To Be Lonely."
Delaney also has a fairly good
voice and when they are singing
together, as on their 45 hit "Move
'Em Out," their voices blend
together nicely.
Delaney and Bonnie are good
singers, but what really makes this
album outstanding is the
instrumental work backing up
their vocals. Most of you have
probably heard their other 45 hit
on the album, "Only You Know
and I Know,"and you'll probably
remember the talented organ and
horn work on this cut.
That high instrumental quality
is maintained throughout the
album with a number of good
horn and organ passages which
stand out, as well as some very
good guitar and percussions work.
An appropriate gauge to the range
of this album is the final cut,
"Country Life," a Country &
Western song which features some
nice singing by Delaney and some
fine steel guitar and fiddle work
by the Friends. All in all, it's a
most enjoyable album.

JIMMIE SPHEERIS
Isle of View — Jimmie Spheeris —
Columbia — C 30988
Will the real Jimmie Spheeris'
voice please sing a few bars? It's
obvious that a folk singer won't
be too successful singing in a
monotone, but Spheeris tries so
many different styles of vocal
delivery that it greatly detracts
from this album.
Spheeris wrote most of the
cuts and the lyrics are by and
large quite good. But his constant
attempts to try different vocal
styles doesn't work and it greatly
lessens the impact of the material.

On two cuts, "Let It Flow"
and "Seven Virgins," he sings in a
natural way, as he should all the
time. "Let It Flow" is a beautiful
love song which really does gently
flow over you. And "Virgins" is a
very good folk-rocker.
But on almost all the other
cuts, Spheeris variates from the
sound vocal style he demonstrates
on these two cuts. At times he
sounds like an over-nasalized
Harry Nillson. And all too often
he begins to breath heavily or gasp

for air, like an asthmatic. On one
cut, I even detect a hint of Neil
Diamond.
Singers always face the
temptation of trying very hard to
imitate other artists. Spheeris
unfortunately seems to have
yielded to this temptation and it's
too bad since on "Let It Flow"
and "Virgins" he shows that he
has a good voice and style of his
own. Hopefully in future recorded
efforts, he'll just "Let It Flow."
