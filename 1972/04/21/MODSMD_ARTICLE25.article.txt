# Hard-Assed Rock & Roll
## 
### DONTOLLEFSON 
Some hard-working drummers
have a tendency to pound their
drums so vigorously that their
drumsticks often go flying out
into the audience and they end up
going through a couple of pairs of
drumsticks during a concert. But
have you ever seen a rock singer
who through a couple of
mi'.e stands a night? Let me
introduce Peter Wolf, the lead
singer with the J. Geils band.
To say that Wolf is energetic is
a classic understatement. From
the moment he runs on stage until
the moment he runs off, Wolf is
go-go-go-go. He's like a 33 1/3 lp
moving at 78 rpm. It's a bit
cliched to say it, but a lot of
people would probably get
exhausted just watching this guy.
Don't get the impression that
Wolf's some kind of crazy speed
freak who just keeps running
around the stage. His voice
definitely isn't the world's most
beautiful, but with the kind of
band he's in, it shouldn't be. Wolf
sings in a powerful distinctive
manner, and his lyrics are almost
always intelligible. His voice is
perfect for the constant hard rock
sounds this band pours out.
But Wolf does a lot more than
just sing. His latest stage fetish
seems to be frong jumps. At
Winterland last Saturday, Wolf
kept jumping in and out of a
squatting position. At other times
he knelt or lay prone on the stage.
But all the time he kept right on
singing and singing well.
Extra Mike Stands
He also loves to take his entire
mike stand with him wherever he
goes. He kept jerking the stand
back and forth and every once in
awhile, he throws it onto the
floor, all of which isn't terribly
good for the microphone stands
and this is why an equipment man
had to stand ready at the side of
the stage with extra mike stands.
Wolf can get by with all his
theatrics and harmonica player
Magic Dick can at times play flat
on his back, because these things
don't detract from the quality of
the band's music. For almost the
entire set, the J. Geils band kept
playing some of the finest hard
rock around.
The namesake of the band is
lead guitarist J. Geils, who looks
like something right out of a
1950's "grease" movie. He has
short greasy black hair and on
Saturday night he was dressed in a
black silk or satin shirt, pegged,
but flared pants and high-heeled
boots. He looked like somebody

right off the set of "West Side
Story."
Much of J. Geils' material is
outstanding original stuff like
"Gonna Find Me A New Love,"
"Gotta Have Your Love,""Floyd's
Hotel" and "Whammer Jammer,"
which features Magic Dick in one
of the most incredible harmonica
solos I have ever heard.
They also did a lot of old
rhythm and blues material. My
favorite of all their songs is the
old R&B classic, "First I Look At
The Purse." This was originally a
very funny hit single and J. Geils
makes it into a classic rocker in
which Wolf performs at his very
best.
Last weekend was the fourth
time I've heard J. Geils in the last
year and a half. Although they
played material which comes
primarily from their two albums,
and this material isn't as exciting
as it once was, it is not yet
worn-out.
Basically, J. Geils is one of the
finest hard-assed, shit-kicking,
rockin' and rollin' bands I've ever
heard. I've heard quite a few
bands of this type, but this
Boston based band is possibly the
finest new hard rock group to
come along in quite awhile.
The night's show opened with
Merry Clayton, who is the woman
who sung lead on the Rolling

Stones "Gimme Shelter" single.
Anybody who has heard that 45
knows that Clayton has a very
powerful voice. Unfortunately, I
only caught the last half of her
s set, but in that short time she was
still able to amply demonstrate
her great vocal power and range.
Vocal Prowess *
Clayton, has sung with Joe
Cocker as well as the Stones and is
now out on her own with her own
group, but she isn't a polished
performer quite yet. On the other
hand her band demonstrated a
good amount of talent and with
her vocal prowess, I'm sure they
should improve in the coming
months.
Clayton was followed by The
Elvin Bishop Group, which did
almost as fine a set as they did the
following night on the Cocker bill
at the Oakland Coliseum.
Especially good was a 15 minute
blues riff in which Elvin lived up
to his reputation as one of the
better white blues guitarists in the
country.
But the night belonged to J.
Geils. Their recorded material was
very good, but they are another of
an ever-growing list of bands that
really have to be seen in person to
be appreciated. Next time they
return to this area, go see them,
but make sure you're well rested.
They'll really take it out of you.

a classic understatement. From
the moment he runs on stage until
the moment he runs off, Wolf is
go-go-go-go. He's like a 33 1/3 lp
moving at 78 rpm. It's a bit
cliched to say it, but a lot of
people would probably get
exhausted just watching this guy.
Don't get the impression that
Wolf's some kind of crazy speed
freak who just keeps running
around the stage. His voice
definitely isn't the world's most
beautiful, but with the kind of
band he's in, it shouldn't be. Wolf
sings in a powerful distinctive
manner, and his lyrics are almost
always intelligible. His voice is
perfect for the constant hard rock
sounds this band pours out.
But Wolf does a lot more than
just sing. His latest stage fetish
seems to be frong jumps. At
Winterland last Saturday, Wolf
kept jumping in and out of a
squatting position. At other times
he knelt or lay prone on the stage.
But all the time he kept right on
singing and singing well.
Extra Mike Stands
He also loves to take his entire
mike stand with him wherever he
goes. He kept jerking the stand
back and forth and every once in
awhile, he throws it onto the
floor, all of which isn't terribly
good for the microphone stands
and this is why an equipment man
had to stand ready at the side of
the stage with extra mike stands.
Wolf can get by with all his
theatrics and harmonica player
Magic Dick can at times play flat
on his back, because these things
don't detract from the quality of
the band's music. For almost the
entire set, the J. Geils band kept
playing some of the finest hard
rock around.
The namesake of the band is
lead guitarist J. Geils, who looks
like something right out of a
1950's "grease" movie. He has
short greasy black hair and on
Saturday night he was dressed in a
black silk or satin shirt, pegged,
but flared pants and high-heeled
boots. He looked like somebody

right off the set of "West Side
Story."
Much of J. Geils' material is
outstanding original stuff like
"Gonna Find Me A New Love,"
"Gotta Have Your Love,""Floyd's
Hotel" and "Whammer Jammer,"
which features Magic Dick in one
of the most incredible harmonica
solos I have ever heard.
They also did a lot of old
rhythm and blues material. My
favorite of all their songs is the
old R&B classic, "First I Look At
The Purse." This was originally a
very funny hit single and J. Geils
makes it into a classic rocker in
which Wolf performs at his very
best.
Last weekend was the fourth
time I've heard J. Geils in the last
year and a half. Although they
played material which comes
primarily from their two albums,
and this material isn't as exciting
as it once was, it is not yet
worn-out.
Basically, J. Geils is one of the
finest hard-assed, shit-kicking,
rockin' and rollin' bands I've ever
heard. I've heard quite a few
bands of this type, but this
Boston based band is possibly the
finest new hard rock group to
come along in quite awhile.
The night's show opened with
Merry Clayton, who is the woman
who sung lead on the Rolling

Stones "Gimme Shelter" single.
Anybody who has heard that 45
knows that Clayton has a very
powerful voice. Unfortunately, I
only caught the last half of her
s set, but in that short time she was
still able to amply demonstrate
her great vocal power and range.
Vocal Prowess *
Clayton, has sung with Joe
Cocker as well as the Stones and is
now out on her own with her own
group, but she isn't a polished
performer quite yet. On the other
hand her band demonstrated a
good amount of talent and with
her vocal prowess, I'm sure they
should improve in the coming
months.
Clayton was followed by The
Elvin Bishop Group, which did
almost as fine a set as they did the
following night on the Cocker bill
at the Oakland Coliseum.
Especially good was a 15 minute
blues riff in which Elvin lived up
to his reputation as one of the
better white blues guitarists in the
country.
But the night belonged to J.
Geils. Their recorded material was
very good, but they are another of
an ever-growing list of bands that
really have to be seen in person to
be appreciated. Next time they
return to this area, go see them,
but make sure you're well rested.
They'll really take it out of you.
Some hard-working drummers
have a tendency to pound their
drums so vigorously that their
drumsticks often go flying out
into the audience and they end up
going through a couple of pairs of
drumsticks during a concert. But
have you ever seen a rock singer
who through a couple of
mi'.e stands a night? Let me
introduce Peter Wolf, the lead
singer with the J. Geils band.

around the stage. His voice
definitely isn't the world's most
beautiful, but with the kind of
band he's in, it shouldn't be. Wolf
sings in a powerful distinctive
manner, and his lyrics are almost
always intelligible. His voice is
perfect for the constant hard rock
sounds this band pours out.
But Wolf does a lot more than
just sing. His latest stage fetish
seems to be frong jumps. At
Winterland last Saturday, Wolf
kept jumping in and out of a
squatting position. At other times
he knelt or lay prone on the stage.
But all the time he kept right on
singing and singing well.
Extra Mike Stands
He also loves to take his entire
mike stand with him wherever he
goes. He kept jerking the stand
back and forth and every once in
awhile, he throws it onto the
floor, all of which isn't terribly
good for the microphone stands
and this is why an equipment man
had to stand ready at the side of
the stage with extra mike stands.
Wolf can get by with all his
theatrics and harmonica player
Magic Dick can at times play flat
on his back, because these things
don't detract from the quality of
the band's music. For almost the
entire set, the J. Geils band kept
playing some of the finest hard
rock around.
The namesake of the band is
lead guitarist J. Geils, who looks
like something right out of a
1950's "grease" movie. He has
short greasy black hair and on
Saturday night he was dressed in a
black silk or satin shirt, pegged,
but flared pants and high-heeled
boots. He looked like somebody

right off the set of "West Side
Story."
Much of J. Geils' material is
outstanding original stuff like
"Gonna Find Me A New Love,"
"Gotta Have Your Love,""Floyd's
Hotel" and "Whammer Jammer,"
which features Magic Dick in one
of the most incredible harmonica
solos I have ever heard.
They also did a lot of old
rhythm and blues material. My
favorite of all their songs is the
old R&B classic, "First I Look At
The Purse." This was originally a
very funny hit single and J. Geils
makes it into a classic rocker in
which Wolf performs at his very
best.
Last weekend was the fourth
time I've heard J. Geils in the last
year and a half. Although they
played material which comes
primarily from their two albums,
and this material isn't as exciting
as it once was, it is not yet
worn-out.
Basically, J. Geils is one of the
finest hard-assed, shit-kicking,
rockin' and rollin' bands I've ever
heard. I've heard quite a few
bands of this type, but this
Boston based band is possibly the
finest new hard rock group to
come along in quite awhile.
The night's show opened with
Merry Clayton, who is the woman
who sung lead on the Rolling

Stones "Gimme Shelter" single.
Anybody who has heard that 45
knows that Clayton has a very
powerful voice. Unfortunately, I
only caught the last half of her
s set, but in that short time she was
still able to amply demonstrate
her great vocal power and range.
Vocal Prowess *
Clayton, has sung with Joe
Cocker as well as the Stones and is
now out on her own with her own
group, but she isn't a polished
performer quite yet. On the other
hand her band demonstrated a
good amount of talent and with
her vocal prowess, I'm sure they
should improve in the coming
months.
Clayton was followed by The
Elvin Bishop Group, which did
almost as fine a set as they did the
following night on the Cocker bill
at the Oakland Coliseum.
Especially good was a 15 minute
blues riff in which Elvin lived up
to his reputation as one of the
better white blues guitarists in the
country.
But the night belonged to J.
Geils. Their recorded material was
very good, but they are another of
an ever-growing list of bands that
really have to be seen in person to
be appreciated. Next time they
return to this area, go see them,
but make sure you're well rested.
They'll really take it out of you.
