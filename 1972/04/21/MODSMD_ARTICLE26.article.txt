# Stanford Sports Action
## The 						Big Weekend 
### Mike Chasson 
Today begins one of the
biggest sports weekends that
Stanford has had in quite a while.
All of Stanford's spring sports are
in action at home. This includes
the nationally ranked tennis,
baseball, and golf teams.
Tennis faces Southern
California today and UCLA
tomorrow in two tough matches.
USC coming off a defeat to UCLA
last weekend is without its
number one singles player
Marcello Lara. This will enable
the Cards to have a much easier
time with the Trojans than in Los
Angeles. However, both coaches
still believe the match will be
close. The competition will not be
any easier on Saturday when the
netters face a fired up UCLA
team. The Bruins defeated USC
5-4 and Lara played in both
singles and doubles. Both matches
will be close and will exhibit some

of the finest collegiate tennis ir
the country.
In the finest outdoor track
meet of the season Stanford will
face UCLA while California meets
USC in Stanford Stadium. While
Stanford and Cal are not among
the nation's track powers, UCLA
and USC are two of the finest
teams in the country. Both UCLA
and USC have numerous Olympic
hopefuls on their squads.
Baseball Action
Stanford's number one ranked
baseball team takes on the Golden
Bears in adouble header Saturday
on Sunken Diamond. The Bears
coming off three losses to USC
last weekend need to win at least
two games to stay in contention
for the Pacific-Eight title. The
Cards currently tied with USC for
the conference lead can't afford
to lose two games and expect to
keep pace with the Trojans.
The golfers face Cal in their
final tune-up before the U.S.
Collegiate Invitational next week
while Lacrosse will play an
important match with the Palo
Alto Lacrosse Club. Stanford and
Palo Alto are tied for the league
lead.

Impossible Task

For the Stanford sports fan to
attend all these events would be
nearly impossible. The USC tennis
match is on Friday afternoon. It is
hoped as many people as possible
will attend the tennis match to
give the Cards the best home
court advantage possible. On
Saturday one will have to choose
according to his interests though
it is hoped everyone the least bit
interested in track will attend
some part of the meet which will
last most of the day.

THE BIG BAT—Rod Boone had three hits as the Cards narrowly defeated the University of the Pacific 5-4
at Stockton last Tuesday. Boone currently leads the team in home runs with eight and in runs batted in
with 29.

TENNIS, ANYONE?—Gary Groslimond (above) will be teamed up in
doubles competition with Rick Fisher when the Cardinals face USC
today and UCLA tomorrow in tennis matches on the Stanford courts.
Both matches begin at 1 p.m. and prospective fans are urged to arrive
early to avoid disappointment. There are only 1500 seats and tickets
go on sale both days at noon.
