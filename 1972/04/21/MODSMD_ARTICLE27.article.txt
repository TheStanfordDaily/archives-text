### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford's varsity and freshman golf teams will try to keep their
undefeated records intact this weekend when they host California
today at 12:30 p.m. and the Stanford alumni tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.
The varsity, coming off a frustrating tie with San Jose State last
Saturday, now has a 7-0-1 record. But the Cards have yet to show
their potential as at least two important players have played poorly in
each match.
Coach Bud Finger hopes that his golfers can pull their games
together this weekend as they approach a crucial point in the season.
Stanford's U.S. Collegiate Invitational will be played on the Stanford
course next Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, while a rematch with
San Jose State and the Pacific Eight tournament at Los Angeles are
just a few weeks away.
"We're going to have to start playing much better golf if we expect
to do anything the rest of the year," said Finger. "We can't afford to
play like we did against San Jose State."
Today's match against Cal will be Stanford's first Pacific Eight test.
Last year the Cards tied USC for the Pac-8 Southern Division dual
match championship with a 3-1 record and became Southern Division

champions on the basis of their victory over the Trojans.
(JSC will be Stanford's strongest rival in Pacific-Eight play again
this year, both in the Southern Division dual matches and the more
important Pacific-Eight tournament.
In this weekend's play, senior Gary Vanier will head the Stanford
lineup for both matches. Vanier, the 1970 U.S. Collegiate Invitational
champion and the 1971 San Francisco City titleholder, played
excellent golf last weekend against USF and San Jose State and
appears to have his game ready for the Cards' important upcoming
matches and tournaments.
Joining Vanier in today's lineup are captain Tom Keelin, Denny
Colvin, Bruce Robertson, Dave Baskins, and Aly Trompas. Conrad
Nilmeier will be sidelined this weekend because of a cut on his hand
he suffered in an accident at his dorm.
Stanford's freshmen team, now 8-0 for the season, will be counting
on number one man George Pettinger to lead them past Cal and the
alumni. Pettinger tied for medalist honors in last Sunday's
varsity-frosh match against the Stanford Golf Club with a three over
par 74.
