# Bunce Signs Contract
## 
### 
Stanford's Rose Bowl
quarterback Don Bunce formally
signed a two-year contract with
the British Columbia Lions of the
Canadian Football League, for an
undisclosed amount. The third
year of the contract is negotiable.
"I didn't want a no-cut clause
because the way some contracts
are designed this might mean you

get less of a salary or bonus. I
honestly didn't want one," Bunce
said.
Bunce plans to apply to the
University of British Columbia
Medical School, and if accepted,
the Lions will pay some of the
costs for Bunce's education. "I'm
really happy with that part of it,"
explained Bunce.
