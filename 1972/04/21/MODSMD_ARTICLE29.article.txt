# Spikers Host UCLA In Olympic Preview
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
Two weeks ago, track fans got a chance to see four top track teams
in the same place at the same time as Stanford took on USC, and Cal
opposed UCLA in a double duel down in Los Angeles. This week, the
teams invade Stanford Stadium in what promises to be one of the
most thrilling performances of the year. This time it will be Stanford
against UCLA' while the Bears take on the Trojans.
In the meet two weeks ago, UCLA downed Cal 95-50, while USC
ran over the Cards 114-31. In that contest, Stanford won only two
events when Arvid Kretz took the two mile, and Jim Royer led a
sweep of the discus. The UCLA team that they face tomorrow is
essentially the same one that won the NCAA crown last year.
At the Stanford-UCLA duel in Los Angeles last year, the Bruins
came out well on top, 108-37. In fact, they have beaten the Cards in
every meet since 1965. On the basis of the results from two weeks
ago, UCLA should have an easy time of it again this year.
In the 100, UCLA'S Edmonson and Gibson took first and third
against Cal at 9.6 and 9.9, while Stanford's lone placer was Ken Curl
(9.9) in the USC meet. Bob Barmeyer and Forrie Martin may also run
Saturday. Smith and Gibson ran 21.2's in the 220 two weeks ago,
while Stanford had Ken Curl (21.6), John Anderson (21.7), and Bob
Barmeyer (21.9) behind a USC sweep of the event.
In the 440, it will be Smith and Benny Brown, who both ran 47.1
two weeks ago against John Anderson and John Kessel, who both
equalled their personal bests against USC at 47.8 and 48.5
respectively. Williams was the lone placer against Cal with a 1:52.8 in
the 880. For Stanford, Dave Whiteing ran a 1:53 against the Trojans,
but was disqualified. Behind him were Brian Mittelstaedt (1:57.2) and
Dave Hustwick (1:58.7).
In the 120 yard high hurdles, it was Rich (14.0) and Johnson
(15.0) placing 1-2 against Cal. Facing them are Dave Bagshaw, who
equalled his personal best two weeks ago with a 14.4, Tom Long
(14.8), and Mark Haight (15.1). In the intermediates, it will be Long
and Haight, who finished 2-3 against the Trojans in 53.2 and 54.3
against UCLA's Corval, who scratched from the last meet because of
illness.
In the mile, Chapins ran 4:11.8 for UCLA, and his teammate
Balasco went 4:13.3 against Berkeley. Stanford's Brian Mittelstaedt
and Les McFadden both had personal bests against the Trojans at
4:08.0 and 4:09.8. This should be one of the Cardinals' strongest
events. In the two mile, Arvid Kretz will be coming into the meet off
of his season's best of 8:58.4. Behind him is Kurt Schoenrock, who
had trouble in the last meet and could only manage 9:32.0. UCLA's
Balasco and Chappins ran 9:04.8 and 9:08.0 in taking 1-2 against Cal.
In the 440 relay two weeks ago, the Stanford team of Marin,
Barmeyer, Anderson, and Curl ran 41.4, while UCLA ran Rich,
Gibson, Gaddis, and Edmonson in defeating Cal with a 42.3. In the
mile relay, Stanford's team of Long, Kessel, Anderson, and Bagshaw
could manage only 3:16.4, while the UCLA squad of Gaddis,
Williams, Edmonson, and Brown took their meet in 3:12.2.
The field events hold more of the same, with Stanford fighting for
a few places. In the discus, which Stanford swept in the last meet with
Jim Royer (160'6"), Jim Howard (155'5"), and Pete Dreissigacker
(153'6"), UCLA Has FReberg (177'1") and Gordon (171'2").
Rick Larson (208') and injured Steve Hopkins (194'6") will have
their hands full in the javelin against Kotinek. who threw 225'4"
against Cal. UCLA's Pagel and Gordon were 1-3 against Berkeley at
57'6'/2" and 55'1014". Against USC, Ralph Bakkensen threw 51'5V&"
and Pete Dreissigacker threw 45'8 l / 2" for the Cards.
In the pole vault, Mooers went 16' for UCLA while injured
17-footer Tracanelli failed at the opening height. Stanford's Tom
Lindsay went 14'6" against USC, but inured himself yesterday and is
probably out for the rest of the season. In the high jump Stones and
Fletcher both cleared 7'W' for the Bruins while Skip Grodahl had a
lifetime best of 6'10" against the Trojans.
In the long jump two weeks ago, it was Bendixen (24'3 1 4") and
Kotinen (23'9 1 /2") placing 1-2 for UCLA. John Anderson led Stanford
at 23'8" while Mike Hall leaped 21'10". In the triple jump, Stanford's
Rod Utley who jumped 48'll'/2" against use will face UCLA's Butts,
who jumped a meet record 53'5-3/4" against Cal and Freeman, who
went 49'10'/4".
The USC-CAI meet should be a little closer, but barring a miracle,
the Trojans will still win by a substantial margin. Some of the events
to watch in that meet will be the 100 and 220, where Cal stars Burns
and Bommarito take on SC's Deckard, Garrison, and Quarrie; the 120
high hurdles, which will feature USC's trio of Wilson, Coffman, and
Babb; the javelin duel between Cal's Bruce Kennedy, and SC's Andy
Barnett; Cal's Jim Penrose (192') in the discus, and the fine relay
teams of Southern California.
The meet will begin at 1:15 tomorrow. Many of the athletes
competing will also be Olympic Games performers in Munich later this
year. If you aren't doing anything else tomorrow afternoon, you
might take this opportunity to see these stars at popular prices.

Balasco went 4:13.3 against Berkeley. Stanford's Brian Mittelstaedt

of his season's best of 8:58.4. Behind him is Kurt Schoenrock, who
had trouble in the last meet and could only manage 9:32.0. UCLA's

(153'6"), UCLA Has FReberg (177'1") and Gordon (171'2").

Fletcher both cleared 7'W' for the Bruins while Skip Grodahl had a
lifetime best of 6'10" against the Trojans.

the Trojans will still win by a substantial margin. Some of the events
to watch in that meet will be the 100 and 220, where Cal stars Burns
and Bommarito take on SC's Deckard, Garrison, and Quarrie; the 120

Kotinen (23'9 1 /2") placing 1-2 for UCLA. John Anderson led Stanford
at 23'8" while Mike Hall leaped 21'10". In the triple jump, Stanford's
Rod Utley who jumped 48'll'/2" against use will face UCLA's Butts,
who jumped a meet record 53'5-3/4" against Cal and Freeman, who

The USC-CAI meet should be a little closer, but barring a miracle,
the Trojans will still win by a substantial margin. Some of the events
to watch in that meet will be the 100 and 220, where Cal stars Burns
and Bommarito take on SC's Deckard, Garrison, and Quarrie; the 120
high hurdles, which will feature USC's trio of Wilson, Coffman, and
Babb; the javelin duel between Cal's Bruce Kennedy, and SC's Andy
Barnett; Cal's Jim Penrose (192') in the discus, and the fine relay
teams of Southern California.
The meet will begin at 1:15 tomorrow. Many of the athletes
competing will also be Olympic Games performers in Munich later this
year. If you aren't doing anything else tomorrow afternoon, you
might take this opportunity to see these stars at popular prices.
Two weeks ago, track fans got a chance to see four top track teams
in the same place at the same time as Stanford took on USC, and Cal
opposed UCLA in a double duel down in Los Angeles. This week, the

most thrilling performances of the year. This time it will be Stanford
against UCLA' while the Bears take on the Trojans.

ran over the Cards 114-31. In that contest, Stanford won only two
events when Arvid Kretz took the two mile, and Jim Royer led a
sweep of the discus. The UCLA team that they face tomorrow is
essentially the same one that won the NCAA crown last year.

came out well on top, 108-37. In fact, they have beaten the Cards in

Balasco went 4:13.3 against Berkeley. Stanford's Brian Mittelstaedt
and Les McFadden both had personal bests against the Trojans at
4:08.0 and 4:09.8. This should be one of the Cardinals' strongest
events. In the two mile, Arvid Kretz will be coming into the meet off
of his season's best of 8:58.4. Behind him is Kurt Schoenrock, who
had trouble in the last meet and could only manage 9:32.0. UCLA's
Balasco and Chappins ran 9:04.8 and 9:08.0 in taking 1-2 against Cal.

could manage only 3:16.4, while the UCLA squad of Gaddis,

a few places. In the discus, which Stanford swept in the last meet with
Jim Royer (160'6"), Jim Howard (155'5"), and Pete Dreissigacker
(153'6"), UCLA Has FReberg (177'1") and Gordon (171'2").

57'6'/2" and 55'1014". Against USC, Ralph Bakkensen threw 51'5V&"

Fletcher both cleared 7'W' for the Bruins while Skip Grodahl had a
lifetime best of 6'10" against the Trojans.
In the long jump two weeks ago, it was Bendixen (24'3 1 4") and
