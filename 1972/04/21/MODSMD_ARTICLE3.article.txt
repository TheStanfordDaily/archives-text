# Workers Vote Down Teamsters As Long NLRB Campaign Ends
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Stanford workers gave the
Teamsters a resounding "no" Tuesday,
voting 894 to 372 to refuse a bid from
Local 856 to represent them in
collective bargaining.
The results, released yesterday
afternoon by the San Francisco office
of the National Labor Relations
Board, mean that the 1600 workers
eligible to vote in the election will not
be represented by a union for at least a
year.
It was a surprisingly lopsided defeat
for the Teamsters, who poured

thousands of dollars into a
three-month campaign to win over
University employees.
The Teamsters beat out two other
unions in a March election, garnering
354 votes out of 1303 cast. The no
union option that appeared on the
ballot won 483 votes, United Stanford
Employees (USE) 268, Stanford
Employees Association 197, and the
defunct Workers Action Caucus one in
the earlier election.
The fact that the Teamsters picked
up only 18 more votes in this week's
election came as a surprise to nearly
everyone.
40 Percent?
"I thought they would get more
like 40 percent of the vote," Jim Berk,
president of USE, said, "I was sure
they would lose, but I had no idea it
would be this big. We must have
worked harder than we thought."
Both USE and SEA actively
opposed the Teamsters in the last stage
of the campaign, taking out newspaper
advertising and mailing literature to
workers in an attempt to beat them.
The Teamsters also had their
problems elsewhere. They held secret
meetings with Venceremos, a
revolutionary organization, that didn't
remain secret. They tried to help three
workers in their grievance proceedings
against a chef at the Faculty Club, and
were charged with using "two-bit
mobster tactics" and refusing to back
the workers all the way.
And only two days before the
election the University joined the

fight, publishing a full-page ad that
attacked various statements made in a
Teamster election pamphlet as
untruthful.
Lobby
Teamsters Executive Secretary
Rudy Tham, in a statement issued to
the Daily last night, said that the
Teamsters would stay on campus to
lobby for better working conditions
and help represent employees in
grievance cases, as SEA and USE
already do.
He said that he intended to file an
objection to the election, but refused
to reveal on what grounds. He said the
Teamsters lost "because of the
opposition of the newspaper, the
Daily, USE, SEA, and the University."
Tham had predicted that the
Teamsters would sweep 70 percent of
the vote, which prompted Berk to say,
"His arithmetic was good. He just got
the parties reversed." The Teamsters
actually won about 28 percent.
Two ballots cast were voided, and
another 25 were voted under
challenge. The challenge ballots
probably won't be considered since
they won't make any difference in the
outcome one way or another.
SEA Reacts
Forrest Futtere, president of SEA,
said that there was a simple reason
that accounted for the Teamster
lossâ€”"People don't like being
intimidated and they don't like being
lied to. The Teamsters did both." He
said SEA would stay on campus, and
try and organize workers with an eye

to next April when the NLRB could
authorize another election.
Berk said that USE was opening a
campaign to improve employee wages
and benefits by next September.
"We're going to let the University
worry about how to recognize us," he
said. "If the law won't let them do it
formally, then they can do it
informally. They can non-sign a
n on-con tract."
'Easy Votes'
Berk said he believed that the
Teamsters "picked up the easy votes
the first time around, the people who
would support any union. But they
couldn't get anyone on the second
try."
John Dolly, hospital worker and
member of Venceremos, issued a
statement for the group last night
claiming that "the Stanford
administration, the Stanford Daily and
the leadership of USE have
successfully teamed up in making
Rudy Tamm's [sic] personality the
primary' issue in the union election at
Stanford. In doing so, they've divided
the working people on campus, and
delayed for at least a year the
beginning of any real power for
workers on this campus."
The Daily opposed the Teamsters
editorially.
Dolly's statement also urged
"black, brown, and poor white
working people" to form a new campus
union.
