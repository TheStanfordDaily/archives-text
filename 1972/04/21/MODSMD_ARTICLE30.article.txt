# Batsmen To Entertain Bears
## 
### MIKE HERMAN 
The Stanford varsity baseball
team completes the first half of its
conference season this weekend
when it returns to action to play a
three-game series against the
Golden Bears of California. The
Indians will travel to Berkeley
today to play a single game
beginning at 2:30 p.m., before
engaging the Bears in a
doubleheader on Saturday,
commencing at 12:00 p.m.
Already UC has had a large
impact on the conference race.
Two weeks ago, an aroused Cal
team travelled to Los Angeles and
swept a three-game set from the
nationally ranked UCLA Bruins.
The three victories thrust the
Bears temporarily into first place
in the Southern Division, as well
as giving them a ranking of
sixteenth nationally.
Last week, however, California
met Southern California and lost
all three games, thus reviving the
Trojan's hopes after their two
losses to Stanford.
The Bears have three
consistently brilliant performers
who will see action in the series:
pitcher Ray Del Carlo, first
baseman Gary Hernandez and
centerfielder Roy Meisner.
Del Carlo, a senior from Castro
Valley, has had a disillusioning
career at California. Last season,
for instance, he had the seventh
best earned run average in the
conference (2.79), yet was able to
win but one game in seven
decisions.
Hernandez is a genuine
All-American, who, last year was
the top batter in the Pacific Eight
(.459). In addition, the junior first
baseman was the conference

leader in runs batted in. In a
recent exhibition game against the
Oakland Athletics, Hernandez got
three hits in four at bats,
including a double and a triple.
Meisner leads a potent Cal
outfield. Overshadowed last year
by All Conference Steve Ohland,
Meisner, a senior from Los Gatos,
managed to hit at a .324 clip.
Against the Athletics, he had one
single and drove in two runs.

UC has a large lead in the series
record, having won 141 games in
the 240 contests between the two
schools, Most of the lead was
compiled early in the series,
especially during the years of
1939-1947 when Cal won
eighteen consecutive games. In
recent years however, Stanford
has won fifteen out of the last
seventeen matches, including a
series sweep last year.
