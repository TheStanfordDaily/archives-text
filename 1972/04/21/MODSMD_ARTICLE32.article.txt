# Netters Face UCLA, SC In Crucial Series
## 
### DAVID ANTONUCCIO 
The Stanford net team is looking forward to a challenging weekend
as they play host to southland rivals, USC on Friday and UCLA on
Saturday.
According to tennis mentor, Dick Gould, "We're anxious and we're
ready. There's going to be a lot of pressure out there, but our guys are
veterans under pressure."
These matches are very important as they determine seeding for
the Pac-8 Championship. A sweep of both matches would give
Stanford top seeding which means UCLA and USC would have to
battle each other in the semi-finals.
The last time Stanford tangled with these LA powers was two
weeks ago in Los Angeles. The Indians emerged with a split, defeating
UCLA 5-4, but falling the next day 4-5 to the SC Trojans. Both
matches went down to the wire and that will probably be the case in
the upcoming contests. Since then, UCLA conquered USC in another
5-4 thriller, so all three teams presently have one conference loss.
USC coach, George Toley believes Stanford will gain victory in the
second meeting of these teams. "In LA the match was even. I figured
before hand that one team would win 5-4. We were lucky. At
Stanford the home court advantage will be only a small factor. The
big difference will be Marcelo Lara who won't play because of
tendonitis in his wrist."
According to Toley, Lara has been suffering from tendonitis for
over a month. "A week before the Stanford match Marcelo didn't
play much because it was hurting. It felt good for Stanford but was
sore after the match and sore against UCLA. The doctors have tried
everything and now rest is the best thing."
If top man Lara doesn't play, the coach would have to shift his
whole roster up a notch. And since Lara normally teams with Raul
Ramirez in doubles competition, their top doubles team would be out
of action.
Gould feels that "Any match is a toss-up and the home crowd
could turn the tables against USC. I think if the same match in LA
had been played up here we would have won. If Marcelo Lara doesn't
play that will hurt them but they have a lot of depth and they'll be
good anyway."
When the Stanford racketmen clash with UCLA they will have
their work cut out for them. Since Sandy Mayer is healthy now, he
may reverse his previous loss to Bob Kreiss, but in the aftermath of
their impressive victory over USC, the Bruins are overflowing with
confidence and will be gunning for revenge against Stanford.
Spencer Segura has been performing brilliantly of late and the
Uclans have strengthened their depth with the addition of Tom Kreiss
in the number six position. Tom's brothers, Bob and Mike, play at
two and three on the squad. Another strongpoint of the club is their
powerful doubles teams. "The second doubles team of Jeff Austin and
Ron Cornell is much better than they're given credit," said Gould.
Gould's lineup will see Roscoe Tanner, Sandy Mayer, and Chico
Hagey occupying the top three spots. Either Jim Delaney or Rick
Fisher will be at number four, followed by Gery Groslimond. Tanner
and Mayer will be the first doubles team. Rick Fisher and Groslimond
will pair up as will Delaney and Hagey. Chip Fisher and Paul Sidone
will be ready to step in if necessary.
Stanford, UCLA, and USC all have a shot at the NCAA
Championship. Perhaps this weekend will be a preview of who will
face the top team in the nation. Trinity University.
Both weekend matches start at 1:00. Tickets go on sale at 12:00
and it would be wise to arrive early.

play much because it was hurting. It felt good for Stanford but was
sore after the match and sore against UCLA. The doctors have tried
everything and now rest is the best thing."
If top man Lara doesn't play, the coach would have to shift his
whole roster up a notch. And since Lara normally teams with Raul
Ramirez in doubles competition, their top doubles team would be out
of action.
Gould feels that "Any match is a toss-up and the home crowd
could turn the tables against USC. I think if the same match in LA
had been played up here we would have won. If Marcelo Lara doesn't
play that will hurt them but they have a lot of depth and they'll be
good anyway."
When the Stanford racketmen clash with UCLA they will have
their work cut out for them. Since Sandy Mayer is healthy now, he
may reverse his previous loss to Bob Kreiss, but in the aftermath of
their impressive victory over USC, the Bruins are overflowing with
confidence and will be gunning for revenge against Stanford.
Spencer Segura has been performing brilliantly of late and the
Uclans have strengthened their depth with the addition of Tom Kreiss
in the number six position. Tom's brothers, Bob and Mike, play at
two and three on the squad. Another strongpoint of the club is their
powerful doubles teams. "The second doubles team of Jeff Austin and
Ron Cornell is much better than they're given credit," said Gould.
Gould's lineup will see Roscoe Tanner, Sandy Mayer, and Chico
Hagey occupying the top three spots. Either Jim Delaney or Rick
Fisher will be at number four, followed by Gery Groslimond. Tanner
and Mayer will be the first doubles team. Rick Fisher and Groslimond
will pair up as will Delaney and Hagey. Chip Fisher and Paul Sidone
will be ready to step in if necessary.
Stanford, UCLA, and USC all have a shot at the NCAA
Championship. Perhaps this weekend will be a preview of who will
face the top team in the nation. Trinity University.
Both weekend matches start at 1:00. Tickets go on sale at 12:00
and it would be wise to arrive early.
The Stanford net team is looking forward to a challenging weekend
as they play host to southland rivals, USC on Friday and UCLA on
Saturday.
According to tennis mentor, Dick Gould, "We're anxious and we're
ready. There's going to be a lot of pressure out there, but our guys are
veterans under pressure."
These matches are very important as they determine seeding for
the Pac-8 Championship. A sweep of both matches would give
Stanford top seeding which means UCLA and USC would have to
battle each other in the semi-finals.
The last time Stanford tangled with these LA powers was two
weeks ago in Los Angeles. The Indians emerged with a split, defeating
UCLA 5-4, but falling the next day 4-5 to the SC Trojans. Both
matches went down to the wire and that will probably be the case in
the upcoming contests. Since then, UCLA conquered USC in another
5-4 thriller, so all three teams presently have one conference loss.
USC coach, George Toley believes Stanford will gain victory in the
second meeting of these teams. "In LA the match was even. I figured
before hand that one team would win 5-4. We were lucky. At
Stanford the home court advantage will be only a small factor. The
big difference will be Marcelo Lara who won't play because of
tendonitis in his wrist."
According to Toley, Lara has been suffering from tendonitis for
over a month. "A week before the Stanford match Marcelo didn't
play much because it was hurting. It felt good for Stanford but was
sore after the match and sore against UCLA. The doctors have tried
everything and now rest is the best thing."
