# Shockley Lecture Disrupted
## 
### 
Two women disrupted Prof.
William Shockley's 11 a.m. lecture in
the McCullough Building yesterday.
They passed out leaflets, one each to
Shockley and his three students, and
then left after Shockley told them
they were disrupting his class.
The leaflet claimed Shockley
"proposed a benevolent control of
inferior populations through voluntary
sterilization programs for black
welfare mothers.
The leaflet further stated that
"eugenic programs—genocide—are
necessarily connected with
antifeminist legislation. Shockley's
plans if not challenged would lead not
only to the genocide of black people
but to the complete subjugation of
women."
In a letter received yesterday by
CJP Chairman John Kaplan, Hearing
Officer Henry Ramsey found that the
University had failed to prove its case
against defendant Geri Foote. Foote
had been charged with disrupting
Shockley's class on Jan. 18.
Ramsey stated that "the University
has failed to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that Ms. Foote was
present at any time in the room where
Prof. Shockley's class was being held.
Eight defendants are presently
being tried in municipal court on
charges stemming from a disruption of
Shockley's class on Feb. 4. The trial
started last week. Closing arguments
are expected today.
