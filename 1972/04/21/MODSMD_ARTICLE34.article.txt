Apollo Lands Safely
SPACE CENTER, Houston - Two
American astronauts landed safely on
the moon last night to begin an
expedition that was temporarily
threatened by a failure in the main
engine of the Apollo 16 command
ship, Casper.
The landing was only possible,
officials said, because engineers were
rapidly mobilized on "the east and
west coasts and points in between" to
study and solve the engine problem in
less than six hours.
"Orion is finally here, Houston,"
exclaimed Charles M. Duke Jr.
moments after he and John W. Young
achieved man's fifth landing on the
moon and began a scientific
exploration of a plateau high in the
lunar mountains. They became the 9th
and 10th Americans to make the lunar
landing.
The six-hour delay of the landing
caused a likely cancellation of the
third moon walk, originally scheduled
for Saturday, and forced
postponement of the first walk until
Friday morning.
Letters Admissable
SAN JOSE - Angela Davis'

impassioned letters of love and
political fervor — including one
described as a personal diary — were
ruled admissible evidence at her
m urder-kidnap-conspiracy trial
yesterday.
Superior Court Judge Richard
Arnason's ruling came after two days
of a bitter defense fight to keep jurors
from reading the letters sent to the
late George Jackson in prison.
After the ruling, a fingerprint
expert testified that he found Davis'
right thumbprint on a page of the
diary-type letter found in Jackson's
cell. He also said her prints appear on a
book found in the van where four
persons died in a wild shootout.
Cal Strikers To Court
OAKLAND — A judge ordered a
contempt of court hearing yesterday
for 33 pickets and more than 20 labor
unions in picketing at the University
of California campus and other UC
facilities.
Superior Court Judge Robert I.
Bostick set a hearing for next Monday
on a contempt citation filed on behalf
of UC regents. The citation said the
picketing had continued in the face of
a temporary restraining order granted
by Bostick last Tuesday.
