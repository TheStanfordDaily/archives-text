# For Strike Duty
## Police Call Extra Photogs 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Campus police and administrators
attempted to hire freelance news and
portrait photographers yesterday to
take pictures of any disruptions during
today's campus strike, the Daily has
learned.
But Stanford Security Captain
William Wullschleger insisted he was
unsuccessful in his efforts to
supplement the University's usual
plainclothes photographers.
Acting at the request of Special
Assistant to the President John
Schwartz, Wullschleger telephoned a
number of photographers in the Bay
Area. He said he chose them from the
Yellow Pages and from a list of
prospects collected by Schwartz'
office.
The police official alleged that he
gave up on the project after receiving
"no-answers" and rejections from
photographers who said they were
already busy.
Franklin Witness
The recruitment effort became
public after Wullschleger tried to hire
Howard Harrison, a freelance news
photographer who was a witness for
Bruce Franklin in the revolutionary

professor's dismissal hearing.
Charles Painter, a photographer for
the University's News Service, said he
supplied a list of four possible
photographers—including Harrison,
who Painter knows as a fellow officer
of the American Society of Magazine
Photographers.
Painter, Schwartz, and Wullschleger
all denied knowing that Harrison
considers himself a "Movement
photographer" or that he testified for
Franklin.
Harrison argued that hiring him
would have had the effect of using him
"as an undercover agent" because he is
known as a news photographer. He
said that using a news photographer
for police work damages his
credibility.
'Working Journalist'
"The photographer has established
himself in the community, and people
will trust him because they assume he
is working as a journalist," Harrison
argued.
Harrison suggested that
demonstrators today should ask
photographers to show their press
credentials, "to sort out who are
police agents."

The Daily policy is to never give
unpublished photographs to police or
to parties in a legal action.
A woman employee of the campus
security force first contacted Harrison.
When Harrison called back soon after,
Wullschleger told him, "Tomorrow
they're having a demonstration, and
the students are going to close down
the University."
The policeman told Harrison that
he and other photographers would "be
assigned to an area... If anything
happens in that area, any sort of
disruption, then start shooting." But
he added, "Maybe nothing will
happen."
Identification
Harrison asked Wullschleger if the
photographers would carry any
identification showing they were
working for the police. The captain
answered, "I don't think you'd have
any kind of police identification."
Harrison said the lack of any police
credentials confirmed his suspicions he
would work as an "undercover agent."
Schwartz denied the cameramen
would be working "undercover," and
he said there was no reason why they
should not "wear whatever they
usually wear."
He pointed out that the regular
police photographers wear street
clothes.
In their conversation, Wullschleger
conceded to Harrison that the
photographer would "possibly have to
testify" in prosecutions based on the
pictures he took.
While shooting an educational
filmstrip on confrontations, Harrison
witnessed the Computation Center
occupation in February, 1970. During
the Franklin hearings, he testified that
Franklin did not incite the crowd at
the Comp Center, as was charged.

Wullschleger told him, "Tomorrow
they're having a demonstration, and
the students are going to close down
the University."
The policeman told Harrison that
he and other photographers would "be
assigned to an area... If anything
happens in that area, any sort of
disruption, then start shooting." But
he added, "Maybe nothing will
happen."
Identification
Harrison asked Wullschleger if the
photographers would carry any
identification showing they were
working for the police. The captain
answered, "I don't think you'd have
any kind of police identification."
Harrison said the lack of any police
credentials confirmed his suspicions he
would work as an "undercover agent."
Schwartz denied the cameramen
would be working "undercover," and
he said there was no reason why they
should not "wear whatever they
usually wear."
He pointed out that the regular
police photographers wear street
clothes.
In their conversation, Wullschleger
conceded to Harrison that the
photographer would "possibly have to
testify" in prosecutions based on the
pictures he took.
While shooting an educational
filmstrip on confrontations, Harrison
witnessed the Computation Center
occupation in February, 1970. During
the Franklin hearings, he testified that
Franklin did not incite the crowd at
the Comp Center, as was charged.
Campus police and administrators
attempted to hire freelance news and
portrait photographers yesterday to
take pictures of any disruptions during
today's campus strike, the Daily has
learned.
But Stanford Security Captain
William Wullschleger insisted he was
unsuccessful in his efforts to
supplement the University's usual
plainclothes photographers.
Acting at the request of Special
Assistant to the President John
Schwartz, Wullschleger telephoned a
number of photographers in the Bay
Area. He said he chose them from the
Yellow Pages and from a list of
prospects collected by Schwartz'
office.
The police official alleged that he
gave up on the project after receiving
"no-answers" and rejections from
photographers who said they were
already busy.
Franklin Witness
The recruitment effort became
public after Wullschleger tried to hire
Howard Harrison, a freelance news
photographer who was a witness for
Bruce Franklin in the revolutionary

professor's dismissal hearing.
Charles Painter, a photographer for
the University's News Service, said he
supplied a list of four possible
photographers—including Harrison,
who Painter knows as a fellow officer
of the American Society of Magazine
Photographers.
Painter, Schwartz, and Wullschleger
all denied knowing that Harrison
considers himself a "Movement
photographer" or that he testified for
Franklin.
Harrison argued that hiring him
would have had the effect of using him
"as an undercover agent" because he is
known as a news photographer. He
said that using a news photographer
for police work damages his
credibility.
'Working Journalist'
"The photographer has established
himself in the community, and people
will trust him because they assume he
is working as a journalist," Harrison
argued.
Harrison suggested that
demonstrators today should ask
photographers to show their press
credentials, "to sort out who are
police agents."

The Daily policy is to never give
unpublished photographs to police or
to parties in a legal action.
A woman employee of the campus
security force first contacted Harrison.
When Harrison called back soon after,
Wullschleger told him, "Tomorrow
they're having a demonstration, and
the students are going to close down
the University."
The policeman told Harrison that
he and other photographers would "be
assigned to an area... If anything
happens in that area, any sort of
