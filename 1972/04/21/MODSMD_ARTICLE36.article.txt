# ASSU Runoff Election Delayed One Day
## 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
The Student Senate voted last night
to change the date of the ASSU
presidential run-off election to
Wednesday and Thursday, April 26
and 27.
The Senate originally set the date

of the final election for the 25th and
26th of next week. The date was
moved back at the request of Elections
Commissioner Johnny Lawson, who
said it was a matter of "personal
time."
Lawson also announced at the
meeting that the ballots for the
primary election have not all been
counted yet. The ballots from the
overseas campuses have not all been
received and Lawson reported that
there had not been enough volunteers
to finish counting the ballots today as
had been planned.
He said he is going to try to finish
counting all the ballots on Saturday.
Lawson did announce the unofficial
results of the voting for next year's
senior class officers. Slate A of Bun-
Field, Jane Almas, Randy Barnes, and
Anita Ewing received the most votes
with 280. Doug Single, Cliff
Nancarrow, Don Mulford and Rick
Dickinson received 189.

The results of the entire primary
election are all unofficial. The results
will not be final until all the ballots,
including the overseas ballots, are
counted twice.
Lawson still did not have the
preliminary results of the bonfire
proposal or the proposed
constitutional amendments.
At the meeting, the Senate took no
action on the fate of the Student

Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC)
voting. The SCLC vote has come into
question over a violation of the voting
procedure.
Lawson told the Senate that he was
not sure what will be included on the
run-off ballot next week. He also said
he had not been given the petition
signed by 400 students to put a
question about the Indian mascot on
the ballot.
