## Nationwide Anti-War Protests Mount 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
Campus protests against the
renewed bombing of North Vietnam
occurred at several colleges across the
nation yesterday, including Berkeley,
Columbia, the University of Maryland
and Antioch. The National Student
Association reports that there will be
strikes at 72 colleges and universities
today.
Hampshire College, Amherst
College, Mt. Holyoake, the University
of Massachusetts and Smith also plan
to block traffic on U.S. Route 91.
Gov. Marvin Mandel of Maryland
ordered National Guardsmen onto the
University of Maryland campus
yesterday, following three consecutive
days of student protests against the
renewed bombing of North Vietnam.
About 500 students attempted to
block traffic on U.S. Route 1 while
2000 cheering students looked on.
Police, with the aid of tear gas, cleared
the road.
"I'm fed up with this violence and
destruction of public and private
property, and 1 fully intend to see that
it ends," said Mandel.
The Maryland campus was reported
as fairly quiet yesterday afternoon. An
anti-war rally scheduled for noon

never took place. About 140 persons
were arrested last night for violating a
9 p.m. curfew.
Over 126 demonstrators were
arrested yesterday at Fairborn, Ohio,
where Antioch students attempted to
block two of the five gates at the
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
Estimates of the number present ran as
high as 500.
Approximately 2500 students
attended a noon rally at Sproul Plaza
at the Berkeley UC campus yesterday,
and voted to support a student strike
scheduled for today.
Following the noon rally about 700
demonstrators marched across the
campus to attempt to present a list of
demands, that included an end of the
bombing of North Vietnam, to
Chancellor Albert Bowker.
Later, another 400 demonstrators
ransacked bookcases at the UC
Institute of International Studies.
Yesterday, several hundred students
broke into an emergency session of the
Columbia University Senate in order
to protest the decision to bring
policemen onto the campus. The
meeting was disrupted before it was
able to vote on the approval of a
moratorium being declared for today.

University President William J.
McGill then announced that he was
calling a moratorium himself, closing
the campus today.
The presidents of eight Ivy league
colleges and of MIT issued a joint
statement Wednesday, denouncing the
renewed bombing of North Vietnam.
They indicated that they approved
of campus demonstrations as long as
"they are not at the expense of the
rights of others."
The college presidpnts' statement
also stated that "although none of us
can speak for his institution, all of us
personally oppose a national policy

which seems to be based on the belief
that the U.S. must at almost any cost
win the war in which it is engaged in
Indochina.
"The cost of such a war in human
life and suffering are appalling and
unjustified. We therefore deplore the
bombing of North Vietnam and its
civilian population."
The statement went on to advocate
"full disengagement" of American
military forces from Indochina. The
statement was signed by the presidents
of Cornell, Columbia, Dartmouth,
Harvard, Princeton, Yale,
Pennsylvania, MIT, and Brown.

"full disengagement" of American
military forces from Indochina. The
statement was signed by the presidents
of Cornell, Columbia, Dartmouth,
Harvard, Princeton, Yale,
Pennsylvania, MIT, and Brown.
Campus protests against the
renewed bombing of North Vietnam
occurred at several colleges across the
nation yesterday, including Berkeley,
Columbia, the University of Maryland
and Antioch. The National Student
Association reports that there will be
strikes at 72 colleges and universities
today.
Hampshire College, Amherst
College, Mt. Holyoake, the University
of Massachusetts and Smith also plan
to block traffic on U.S. Route 91.
Gov. Marvin Mandel of Maryland
ordered National Guardsmen onto the
University of Maryland campus
yesterday, following three consecutive
days of student protests against the
renewed bombing of North Vietnam.
About 500 students attempted to
block traffic on U.S. Route 1 while
2000 cheering students looked on.
Police, with the aid of tear gas, cleared
the road.
"I'm fed up with this violence and
destruction of public and private
property, and 1 fully intend to see that
it ends," said Mandel.
The Maryland campus was reported
as fairly quiet yesterday afternoon. An
anti-war rally scheduled for noon

never took place. About 140 persons
were arrested last night for violating a
9 p.m. curfew.
Over 126 demonstrators were
arrested yesterday at Fairborn, Ohio,
where Antioch students attempted to
block two of the five gates at the
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
Estimates of the number present ran as
high as 500.
Approximately 2500 students
attended a noon rally at Sproul Plaza
at the Berkeley UC campus yesterday,
and voted to support a student strike
scheduled for today.
Following the noon rally about 700
demonstrators marched across the
campus to attempt to present a list of
demands, that included an end of the
bombing of North Vietnam, to
Chancellor Albert Bowker.
Later, another 400 demonstrators
ransacked bookcases at the UC
Institute of International Studies.
Yesterday, several hundred students
broke into an emergency session of the
Columbia University Senate in order
to protest the decision to bring
policemen onto the campus. The
meeting was disrupted before it was
able to vote on the approval of a
moratorium being declared for today.

University President William J.
McGill then announced that he was
calling a moratorium himself, closing
the campus today.
The presidents of eight Ivy league
colleges and of MIT issued a joint
statement Wednesday, denouncing the
renewed bombing of North Vietnam.
They indicated that they approved
of campus demonstrations as long as
"they are not at the expense of the
rights of others."
The college presidpnts' statement
also stated that "although none of us
can speak for his institution, all of us
personally oppose a national policy

which seems to be based on the belief
that the U.S. must at almost any cost
win the war in which it is engaged in
Indochina.
"The cost of such a war in human
life and suffering are appalling and
unjustified. We therefore deplore the
bombing of North Vietnam and its
civilian population."
