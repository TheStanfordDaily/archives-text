# North Vietnam Gains; Demos Want Peace

WASHINGTON (AP) - As the
military situation in Indochina
deteriorated yesterday, the House
Democratic Caucus passed a resolution
144 to 58 demanding the drafting of a
bill requiring the complete withdrawal
of American forces from Southeast
Asia.
The Caucus resolution specifically
directs the House Foreign Affairs
Committee to draft a bill to end the
war. This is a radical departure from
the caucus' normal procedure of
merely making recommendations.
The House Democrats' new stand is
significant in that previous anti-war
legislation has passed the Senate only
to be killed in the more conservative
House. The Foreign Affairs Committee
has never allowed any anti-war
measures to reach the House floor.
In war action yesterday, the North
Vietnamese captured a 50-mile section
of Highway 1 in eastern Cambodia
only 40 miles from Saigon. Cambodian

officials speculated that the enemy
wants to control all of Svay Rieng
province in eastern Cambodia in
preparation for an all-out assault on
Saigon.
The Viet Cong also launched a
renewed attack on the besieged
provincial capital, An Loc, 60 miles
north of Saigon. American B-52
bombers dropped 500 tons of bombs
around the perimeter of An Loc in an
effort to drive back the North
Vietnamese attackers.
In Washington, President Nixon
received support from Teamsters
President Frank Fitzsimmons, who
scored Hanoi for having a "callous
disregard for an honorable
settlement." However, anti-war
sentiment was running high yesterday
in the nation's capital as a broad-based
coalition of peace groups announced
plans for a May 4 demonstration
patterned on the Oct. 15, 1969
Moratorium.
