## See War In Context 
### 
The increased activity in the Indochina War must
be seen in the context of the entire war, particularly
in the context of Johnson's escalation of the war in
1964-65, and Nixon's troop withdrawal program.
The reaction of the anti-war forces in this
country should be made only after those opposed to
the war undersand how current events appear not
unlike past events, and only after we make a
judgement about what we should reasonably expect
Nixon to do.
The reports of American ships being attacked
and the increased retaliation bombing of North
Vietnam remind me of earlier incidents in the
Indochina War.
Tonkin Gulf
On August 4, 1964 President Johnson ordered
reprisal raids against North Vietnam PT boat
installations and oil storage tanks. On August 5 he
sent an additional aircraft carrier to waters off
Vietnam; deployed fighter-bombers to South
Vietnam, Thailand, and advance bases in the Pacific;
and alerted and readied Army and Marine forces for
movement. These actions were in response to two
North Vietnamese attacks on American destroyers.
We now know from The Pentagon Papers that
the following sequence of events preceded
Johnson's actions in August 1964.
On July 30, 1964 South Vietnamese under
General Westmoreland's command raided two North
Vietnamese islands in the Gulf of Tonkin. On
August 1 and 2, T-28 aircraft apparently attacked
North Vietnamese villages near the Laotian border.
Following these attacks on August 2, North
Vietnamese PT boats attacked a U.S. destroyer.
On August 3, South Vietnamese attacked two
North Vietnamese installations near the Gulf of
Tonkin. On August 4 the second PT boat attack
occurred. Johnson's retaliation attacks and troop
movements followed the second attack, as did the
Tonkin Gulf resolution.
The retaliatory air attacks were made on targets
selected from a list of targets drawn up in response
to a National Security Action Memorandum of May
17, 1964. The first draft of the Tonkin Gulf
resolution was dated May 25, 1964.
Now President Nixon has announced that U.S.
ships have been attacked by North Vietnamese
boats and planes, after South Vietnamese have
reportedly attacked north of the DMZ. Meanwhile,
without waiting for the North Vietnamese attacks as
excuses, Nixon has ordered the bombing of oil
storage installations in North Vietnam; sent
additional aircraft carriers to waters off Vietnam;
deployed fighter-bombers to South Vietnam,
Thailand, and advance bases in the Pacific; and
apparently alerted and readied Army and Marine
forces for movement.
Air War
On February 8, 1965 President Johnson started
the air war allegedly in response to NLF attacks on
Pleiku. Then, on February 13 he gave the order for
the sustained bombing of North Vietnam.
The Pentagon Papers tell us that the Johnson

5 herb borock

Administration reached a consensus on September
7, 1964 that such air attacks would have to be
launched. The consensus was reached during the
height of a Presidential campaign and at a time that
the situation in South Vietnam was deteriorating
(from the U.S. point of view).
Now President Nixon has resumed the air war in
North Vietnam allegedly in response to North
Vietnamese attacks across the DMZ. He has
apparently given the order for the sustained
bombing of North Vietnam. Nixon's actions take
place during a Presidential campaign and at a time
when the Nixon-Thieu position in South Vietnam is
deteriorating.
Similarities
The apparent similarity between the actions of
the Johnson and Nixon administrations in regard to
two key incidents in the war (naval engagements
and attacks on North Vietnam) should not be
disregarded. We should examine our responses to
Johnson's past policies so that we can more
effectively counter Nixon's policies, which upon
examination appear ,to be Johnson's policies. Past
effective actions should be repeated and improved;
past ineffective actions should be abandoned or
modified.
Our actions should also depend upon Nixon's
so-called Vietnamization policy. Whereas Johnson
was sending troops to South Vietnam, Nixon is
supposed to be withdrawing them. We should hold
Nixon to his promise to withdraw all troops this
year and, if he does not, we should respond to what
he does do.
Troop Withdrawals
Sometime before May 1 President Nixon will
announce the rate of the next stage of American
troop withdrawals from Vietnam. On May 1 the
authorized ceiling of American troops is supposed
to be 69,000 men.
In the past, troops have been withdrawn in
several stages at increasing rates of withdrawal. The
approximate withdrawal rates per month during
four stages of withdrawal have been:
A. 10,000
B. 12,000
C. 14,300
D. 23,000
What should we reasonably expect Nixon to do
now? I think we should expect him to announce the
withdrawal of the remaining troops at a rate
consistent with past withdrawals. If he uses one of
the above rates of withdrawal, all troops will be
withdrawn by these dates:
D. August 1
C. October 1.
B. November 1.
A. December 1.
I am looking forward to the President's
announcement. You might wish to listen to his
speech with a few of your friends and then decide
what you want to do as a response to that speech.
That's what I intend to do.

be seen in the context of the entire war, particularly
in the context of Johnson's escalation of the war in
1964-65, and Nixon's troop withdrawal program.
The reaction of the anti-war forces in this
country should be made only after those opposed to
the war undersand how current events appear not
unlike past events, and only after we make a
judgement about what we should reasonably expect
Nixon to do.
The reports of American ships being attacked
and the increased retaliation bombing of North
Vietnam remind me of earlier incidents in the
Indochina War.
Tonkin Gulf
On August 4, 1964 President Johnson ordered
reprisal raids against North Vietnam PT boat
installations and oil storage tanks. On August 5 he
sent an additional aircraft carrier to waters off
Vietnam; deployed fighter-bombers to South
Vietnam, Thailand, and advance bases in the Pacific;
and alerted and readied Army and Marine forces for
movement. These actions were in response to two
North Vietnamese attacks on American destroyers.
We now know from The Pentagon Papers that
the following sequence of events preceded
Johnson's actions in August 1964.
On July 30, 1964 South Vietnamese under
General Westmoreland's command raided two North
Vietnamese islands in the Gulf of Tonkin. On
August 1 and 2, T-28 aircraft apparently attacked
North Vietnamese villages near the Laotian border.
Following these attacks on August 2, North
Vietnamese PT boats attacked a U.S. destroyer.
On August 3, South Vietnamese attacked two
North Vietnamese installations near the Gulf of
Tonkin. On August 4 the second PT boat attack
occurred. Johnson's retaliation attacks and troop
movements followed the second attack, as did the
Tonkin Gulf resolution.
The retaliatory air attacks were made on targets
selected from a list of targets drawn up in response
to a National Security Action Memorandum of May
17, 1964. The first draft of the Tonkin Gulf
resolution was dated May 25, 1964.
Now President Nixon has announced that U.S.
ships have been attacked by North Vietnamese
boats and planes, after South Vietnamese have
reportedly attacked north of the DMZ. Meanwhile,
without waiting for the North Vietnamese attacks as
excuses, Nixon has ordered the bombing of oil
storage installations in North Vietnam; sent
additional aircraft carriers to waters off Vietnam;
deployed fighter-bombers to South Vietnam,
Thailand, and advance bases in the Pacific; and
apparently alerted and readied Army and Marine
forces for movement.
Air War
On February 8, 1965 President Johnson started
the air war allegedly in response to NLF attacks on
Pleiku. Then, on February 13 he gave the order for
the sustained bombing of North Vietnam.
The Pentagon Papers tell us that the Johnson

5 herb borock

Administration reached a consensus on September
7, 1964 that such air attacks would have to be
launched. The consensus was reached during the
height of a Presidential campaign and at a time that
the situation in South Vietnam was deteriorating
(from the U.S. point of view).
Now President Nixon has resumed the air war in
North Vietnam allegedly in response to North
Vietnamese attacks across the DMZ. He has
apparently given the order for the sustained
bombing of North Vietnam. Nixon's actions take
place during a Presidential campaign and at a time
when the Nixon-Thieu position in South Vietnam is
deteriorating.
Similarities
The apparent similarity between the actions of
the Johnson and Nixon administrations in regard to
two key incidents in the war (naval engagements
and attacks on North Vietnam) should not be
disregarded. We should examine our responses to
Johnson's past policies so that we can more
effectively counter Nixon's policies, which upon
examination appear ,to be Johnson's policies. Past
effective actions should be repeated and improved;
past ineffective actions should be abandoned or
modified.
Our actions should also depend upon Nixon's
so-called Vietnamization policy. Whereas Johnson
was sending troops to South Vietnam, Nixon is
supposed to be withdrawing them. We should hold
Nixon to his promise to withdraw all troops this
year and, if he does not, we should respond to what
he does do.
Troop Withdrawals
Sometime before May 1 President Nixon will
announce the rate of the next stage of American
troop withdrawals from Vietnam. On May 1 the
authorized ceiling of American troops is supposed
to be 69,000 men.
In the past, troops have been withdrawn in
several stages at increasing rates of withdrawal. The
approximate withdrawal rates per month during
four stages of withdrawal have been:
A. 10,000
B. 12,000
C. 14,300
D. 23,000
What should we reasonably expect Nixon to do
now? I think we should expect him to announce the
withdrawal of the remaining troops at a rate
consistent with past withdrawals. If he uses one of
the above rates of withdrawal, all troops will be
withdrawn by these dates:
D. August 1
C. October 1.
B. November 1.
A. December 1.
I am looking forward to the President's
announcement. You might wish to listen to his
speech with a few of your friends and then decide
what you want to do as a response to that speech.
That's what I intend to do.

be seen in the context of the entire war, particularly
in the context of Johnson's escalation of the war in
1964-65, and Nixon's troop withdrawal program.
The reaction of the anti-war forces in this
country should be made only after those opposed to
the war undersand how current events appear not
unlike past events, and only after we make a
judgement about what we should reasonably expect
Nixon to do.
The reports of American ships being attacked
and the increased retaliation bombing of North
Vietnam remind me of earlier incidents in the
Indochina War.
Tonkin Gulf
On August 4, 1964 President Johnson ordered
reprisal raids against North Vietnam PT boat
installations and oil storage tanks. On August 5 he
sent an additional aircraft carrier to waters off
Vietnam; deployed fighter-bombers to South
Vietnam, Thailand, and advance bases in the Pacific;
and alerted and readied Army and Marine forces for
movement. These actions were in response to two
North Vietnamese attacks on American destroyers.
We now know from The Pentagon Papers that
the following sequence of events preceded
Johnson's actions in August 1964.
On July 30, 1964 South Vietnamese under
General Westmoreland's command raided two North
Vietnamese islands in the Gulf of Tonkin. On
August 1 and 2, T-28 aircraft apparently attacked
North Vietnamese villages near the Laotian border.
Following these attacks on August 2, North
Vietnamese PT boats attacked a U.S. destroyer.
On August 3, South Vietnamese attacked two
North Vietnamese installations near the Gulf of
Tonkin. On August 4 the second PT boat attack
occurred. Johnson's retaliation attacks and troop
movements followed the second attack, as did the
Tonkin Gulf resolution.
The retaliatory air attacks were made on targets
selected from a list of targets drawn up in response
to a National Security Action Memorandum of May
17, 1964. The first draft of the Tonkin Gulf
resolution was dated May 25, 1964.
Now President Nixon has announced that U.S.
ships have been attacked by North Vietnamese
boats and planes, after South Vietnamese have
reportedly attacked north of the DMZ. Meanwhile,
without waiting for the North Vietnamese attacks as
excuses, Nixon has ordered the bombing of oil
storage installations in North Vietnam; sent
additional aircraft carriers to waters off Vietnam;
deployed fighter-bombers to South Vietnam,
Thailand, and advance bases in the Pacific; and
apparently alerted and readied Army and Marine
forces for movement.
Air War
On February 8, 1965 President Johnson started
the air war allegedly in response to NLF attacks on
Pleiku. Then, on February 13 he gave the order for
the sustained bombing of North Vietnam.
The Pentagon Papers tell us that the Johnson

Administration reached a consensus on September
7, 1964 that such air attacks would have to be
launched. The consensus was reached during the
height of a Presidential campaign and at a time that
the situation in South Vietnam was deteriorating
(from the U.S. point of view).
Now President Nixon has resumed the air war in
North Vietnam allegedly in response to North
Vietnamese attacks across the DMZ. He has
apparently given the order for the sustained
bombing of North Vietnam. Nixon's actions take
place during a Presidential campaign and at a time
when the Nixon-Thieu position in South Vietnam is
deteriorating.
Similarities
The apparent similarity between the actions of
the Johnson and Nixon administrations in regard to
two key incidents in the war (naval engagements
and attacks on North Vietnam) should not be
disregarded. We should examine our responses to
Johnson's past policies so that we can more
effectively counter Nixon's policies, which upon
examination appear ,to be Johnson's policies. Past
effective actions should be repeated and improved;
past ineffective actions should be abandoned or
modified.
Our actions should also depend upon Nixon's
so-called Vietnamization policy. Whereas Johnson
was sending troops to South Vietnam, Nixon is
supposed to be withdrawing them. We should hold
Nixon to his promise to withdraw all troops this
year and, if he does not, we should respond to what
he does do.
Troop Withdrawals
Sometime before May 1 President Nixon will
announce the rate of the next stage of American
troop withdrawals from Vietnam. On May 1 the
authorized ceiling of American troops is supposed
to be 69,000 men.
In the past, troops have been withdrawn in
several stages at increasing rates of withdrawal. The
approximate withdrawal rates per month during
four stages of withdrawal have been:
A. 10,000
B. 12,000
C. 14,300
D. 23,000
What should we reasonably expect Nixon to do
now? I think we should expect him to announce the
withdrawal of the remaining troops at a rate
consistent with past withdrawals. If he uses one of
the above rates of withdrawal, all troops will be
withdrawn by these dates:
D. August 1
C. October 1.
B. November 1.
A. December 1.
I am looking forward to the President's
announcement. You might wish to listen to his
speech with a few of your friends and then decide
what you want to do as a response to that speech.
That's what I intend to do.
