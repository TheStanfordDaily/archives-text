Senate
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the front page article of last
Friday's Daily, certain allegations
were made about a member of our
ASSU presidential ticket. Now
that the election is over we feel
that these allegations can be
cleared up without people
thinking that we were politically
motivated.
The Barber-Fay-Cortez slate has
never been "vocal in its criticism
of the Senate." Indeed, contrary
to what the Daily said, we feel
that the Senate has improved
greatly this past year. It still has
problems, but we ran for and
served on the Senate this year

because we felt those problems
could be worked out. The one
private criticism that Chuck Fay
made of the Senate was meant
only to apply to those members
whose records have reflected
badly on the Senate as a whole.
Among these is black
ex-senator Mike Dawson, who had
just resigned the evening the
criticism was made because it was
found that Dawson had not been a
student since March 1971. Fay
felt that persons such as this
lacked honesty and did not care
what tactics they used. It was
never Fay's intention or belief to
include all black Senators in the
statement as Loudin Beam,
another black Senator,

unfortunately understood them to
include. Indeed Barber and Fay
had asked Beam to run on the
slate with them because of his
excellent record on the issues in
the Senate and his hard work in
the ASSU. Beam had, however,
dropped off the ticket previous to
this comment because he felt his
law studies required more
attention.
We feel that it is unfortunate
that the Daily printed the
allegations without thoroughly
researching the incident or giving
a balanced picture of the facts and
the statements that were made.
