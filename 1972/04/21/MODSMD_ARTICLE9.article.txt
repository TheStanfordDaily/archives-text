Bewildered
Editor, THE DAILY:
It bewilders me to find that
white students at Stanford
University are not concerned
about Black student supported
assessments. After the outcome of
the election yesterday, with the
defeat of the Afro-American Fee
Assessment, it is quite clear to

Black Students that any support
we may ask of white students
cannot be relied on in any way.
It is even more upsetting to
know that support is lacking only
in Black initiated programs. The
fact that both tne xJaily
Assessment and the KZSU
Assessment (both hav : ng to do
with communication among white
students here on campus) were
passed overwhelmingly, while the
Afro-American Fee Assessment,
whose purpose was to set up some
form of communication not only
among Blacks but among Blacks
and whites as well, was defeated, is
just another example of the overt
racism which exists on this campus,
as well as in the United States.
Such action shows the white
students' hesitancy in wanting to
learn or participate in anything
having to do with Black culture.
White students at Stanford must
learn that the world is not lily
white without anything of other
importance. They must begin to
realize that unless they have some
knowledge of Black culture their
education can in no way be
considered complete.

Strike!
At a meeting yesterday of the
Political Science Graduate
Students Association, the
following resolution was passed
unanimously:
1. We support the three strike
demands of the National Student
Association and the student strike
called for, but not necessarily
limited to Friday.
As a group we intend to picket
our own department with the
objective of closing it down. In
addition, we are collecting funds
to be sent to the American
Friends Service Committee to
provide medical care for
Indo-Chinese victims of American
bombing — bombs which have
already been purchased with our
tax money.
We ask all political science
faculty and graduate and
undergraduate students to join us
in our efforts.
2. We call upon President
Lyman to employ here the same
principle he enunciated in his
April 18 letter to Richard Nixon
— specifically, that a firm deadline
be set for the elimination of war
research and all other activities
that contribute to the war effort.

Strike Today
Editor, THE DAILY:
At a noon meeting yesterday
workers from different parts of
the campus came together in
support of a University-wide work
stoppage to protest:
1) The escalation by Nixon of
the air-war that now includes
urban and populated sections of
North Vietnam.
2) University complicity by
making the air-war both possible
and profitable (Hansen Labs,
David Packard).
3) The "bread and butter"
results at home (8.A.P.) of a
war-related economy that must
attempt to spread around the
world — or die.
Today beginning at 6:30 a.m.
at Encina Hall, workers will meet
with students and move towards
setting up picket lines across
campus. This will include the
Med. Center, Libraries, Old
Union, Tresidder, Plant Services
and wherever else large numbers
of workers can be found. All
workers are urged to join this
work stoppage and also to join in
Saturday's demonstration at
Kezar Stadium in San Francisco.
Saturday's demonstration will
be in support of: 1) The N.L.F.
7-point peace proposal; 2) An
end to U.S. interference in the
internal affairs of other nations;
3) An end to oppression: racist,
sexist, and economic, here at
home.
Saturday's demonstration also
deserves your support because we
can't depend on Congress or
anyone else to stop the war. Only
massive public protest and direct
action at a community level can
ever succeed. Students, Workers
and Faculty can shut the
University down. STRIKE

Unwarranted
Editor, THE DAILY:
We would like to comment on
Mr. Peter Knutson's remarks made
last night about his judgment of
the allegedly unwholesome nature
of the Hansen Laboratories
research activity. We would like to
repeat what has previously been
pointed out, that our work is
open, is of general scientific
interest, and that any one who
understands the nature of the
research is aware of the fact that
Mr. Knutson's statements are
totally unwarranted.
Blue sky speculations picked

up in semi-popular trade journals
of conceivably possible
applications of particular areas of
research, do not in any way
justify the kinds of far-fetched
statements Mr. Knutson has been
making.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Once again, the cries of
"Trash!" have arisen from the
hordes of collectivist vermin. But
before they riot prematurely,
there are a few things that they
should remember:
With respect to foreign affairs—
The colossal failure of United
States foreign policy is due to a
lack of national self-interest. It is
not in the interests of the
American people to perpetuate
dictatorships, such as that of
South Vietnam. (In this respect,
the recognitioa of the totalitarian

government of Mainland China as
a "legitimate" government — one
which protects individual rights —
is an obscenity beyond degree.)
United States foreign policy is
ultimately the jurisdiction of the
Congress, and not the President.
The President is merely exercising
those powers and in the manner
rendered him by the Congress.
With respect to domestic
affairs—
If some students wish to
"strike" in order to engage in the
somewhat fruitless activity cf
trying to change the President s
execution of foreign policy, they
have every right to do so. Of
course, they will miss some of
their classes, but that is a choice
they will have to make.
Those students do not,
however, have the "right" to
forcibly prevent other students
from attending the classes that
they have paid tuition in order to
attend, nor to bar the professors
who have been paid to instruct
those classes.
