# Police Clear El Camino Real, Arrest 205
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Some 205 persons were arrested en
masse Friday afternoon when police
without warning charged a group of
650 anti-war protesters blocking traf
fic at the corner of El Camino Real
and Embarcadero Road. At least 116
of the arrested were Stanford students,
and 46 were juveniles.
About 70 tactical squad officers
from several area police agencies to<?k
part in the massive arrests, largest in
Stanford history.
Those arrested were cut off from
the rest of the marchers and encircled
by riot-equipped Palo Alto Police.
After most of the arrests were made,
two police and several demonstrators
were injured in clashes.
Most arrestees were taken to the
Elmwood Correctional Facility in
Milpitas, where they were booked on
misdemeanor charges of obstructing
traffic.
About four persons were charged
with assaulting a policeman, a felony,
for hurling sticks and rocks at officers.
Injured
Capt. Wesley Johnson of the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's office, the tac
squad commander, was struck in the
face by a stick but did not require
immediate medical attention.
Another unidentified officer was
also slightly injured.
As of 4:30 p.m. Friday, Cowell
Health Center reported treating and
releasing three students for minor
injuries. The Stanford Hospital Emer
gency Room reported that it had not
treated any injured protesters.
Palo Alto Police Capt. Gary Tatum
said he ordered the mass arrests after
deciding there was no other way to
clear El Camino (State Highway 82).
Police Chief James Zurcher was
participating in a celebrity golf tour
nament, and was not on the scene.
The protesters marched to the busy
El Camino intersection after police
drove about 900 persons from Encina
Hall at 2:20 p.m. After pausing briefly
to regroup at the Graduate School of
Business, Venceremos member Don
Lee suggested that he had heard talk
of two options for the group: either they
could enter the GSB or "we can take
El Camino."
On The March
The protesters voted overwhelm
ingly for the latter option and, swollen
by stragglers and latecomers to an
estimated 1000, headed for the high
way.
The march crossed Campus Drive,
cut through a grove of eucaluptus
trees, and headed down Galvez Street
to El Camino. About 650 persons
actually entered the intersection where
Galvez, El Camino, and Embarcadero
meet, linking arms and singing "We
Shall Overcome" as they swung into
the northbound lanes of the highway,
blocking all traffic in that direction.
About 12 tac squad men ran

single-file down the sidewalk past the
marchers. Then, at Encina Avenue, a
narrow side street that marks the
northern boundary of the Town and
Country shopping center, the police
men swung out into the street to face
the demonstrators. They charged the
crowd without warning at 2:50 p.m.,
scattering the protesters on both sides
of the street.
More Arrests
Demonstrators crossing the south
bound lanes trampled a cyclone fence,
and many of them escaped into the
eucalyptus grove on Stanford land.
However, several were caught and
arrested, including one girl who was
beaten while her hand was impaled on
the fence.
Dozens of tac squad officers poured
into the street and forced those
demonstrators still on the northbound
side of the highway up against the side
of Stickney's Restaraunt, where they
were surrounded and held for arrest.
Demonstrators first began throwing
rocks and sticks after the main police
charge. The barrage of missiles angered
the policemen, and they pursued the
crowd more forcefully.
Several persons were beaten as
police attempted to round up pro
testers missed in the first sweep. Alan
English, 20, a Stanford sophomore,
was knocked unconscious and dragged
over to join the other arrestees,
bleeding profusely from a gash in his
cheek.
Santa Clara County Sheriff's office
sources complained that Palo Alto
officers transporting English to the
Stanford Hospital Emergency Room
released him from custody. The
sources claimed he had been arrested
for obstructing movement on a street
and resisting arrest.
Subdued
Another man was subdued near the
center divider of the highway by three
policemen, one of them choking the
protester with a night stick and
dragging him across the street. Demon
strators unleashed a hail of rocks and
sticks at the struggling officers, also
hitting, but not injuring, Sheriff's Lt.
Don Tamm, who had been telling
them over a loudspeaker to "stop,
stop. . .you're only hurting your
friends. . .it's a stupid thing to do."
Many demonstrators later com
plained of alleged police brutality.
Michael S. Berkowitz, a graduate
student in Education, said he was
"obeying the orders that were given"
when he was "hit in the ribs and face"
in what he termed "an unprovoked
assault." He said that "my nose may
be broken and my teeth are chipped
. . .my glasses were knocked off and
the policeman who did it tried to
break them."
At a Friday night meeting in
Donner House, freshmen led by Ken
Zwick met to protest alleged acts of
police brutality, including the denial
of first aid treatment for an injured

protester and several incidents where
police cars chased demonstrators
through the eucalyptus grove. The
group hopes to amass evidence of the
alleged acts to turn over to the Palo
Alto City Council.
Other demonstrators alleged that
one tac squad officer pulled his gun
while chasing a suspect near Encina
Gym, but holstered the gun when tho
suspect wouldn't halt.
One man was pulled from the
shower at the Men's Gym on campus,
and arrested for assault with a deadly
weapon. According to witnesses, the
man was taken naked into a police car
by Sheriff's Deputies. The man was
apparently identified as one of the
rock throwers during the El Camino
arrests.
Escapes
One arrestee, library worker Geoff
White, managed to escape from police
by jumping over a parked car, but was
recaptured and shoved roughly against
the trunk of a car, where he was
handcuffed.
Another arrestee made his way
through the police lines and escaped
down Encina Avenue, where he
apparently hid from pursuing police.
He was spotted crossing El Camino
about 15 minutes later, having success
fully eluded his would-be captors.
The police allowed food to be
passed in to the arrestees while

awaiting transportation to detention
facilities, but confiscated all bottles
and other glass objects.
Buses
Santa Clara and San Mateo County
buses arrived on the scene at 3:24 and
3:42 p.m. to begin transporting the
prisoners to detention facilities. Each
one was photographed and frisked
before being allowed on the bus, and
all potential weapons, including pens
and matches, were confiscated.
About 170 were taken to the
Elmwood facility in Milpitas; the other
40 were scattered among other facili
ties, including the North County Jail
in Palo Alto.
At Elmwood, the men were detain
ed in an auditorium for about eight
hours, while women remained on the
buses for approximately six hours.
Neither group was given any food
during the period of incarceration.
Own Recognizance
Students with Stanford identifica

tion cards were released on their own
recognizance, some on the condition
that they sign an agreement saying
they would not participate in any
protest or demonstration declared
illegal until their trial. Those who refused or
were unable to obtain OR had bail set
at $315.
Trial dates were tentatively set for
May 1 and 2.
According to the Sheriff's Com
mand Post press officer yesterday,
three females were arrested at Elm
wood on felony charges of bringing
alcohol onto jail grounds when they
arrived to bail out five women arrested
earlier.
Traffic on El Camino was re-routed
around the demonstration scene for
several hours Friday afternoon, and
tie-ups were reported in the area as
late as 4:30 p.m.
