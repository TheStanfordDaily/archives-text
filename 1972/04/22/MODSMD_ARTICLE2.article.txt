# Strikers Interrupt Morning Classes, Some Business Continues Normally
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
Reaction to Friday's anti war strike
on campus was widespread but mostly
quiet. Many classes had low atten
dance or were not held at all, while
officials at Hansen Labs remained
watchful for renewed demonstrations.
The atmosphere at Stanford, aside
from the many marchers, did not
match the frenetic mood of the
week-long strike two years ago, follow
ing the incursion of American troops
into Cambodia.
Demonstrators halted classes, pro
fessors decided not to hold others, and
some promised to repeat their Friday
lectures sometime next week for
students who boycotted classes.
While the percentage of students
who stayed away from classes was
hard to estimate, very few were
physically prevented from going to
lectures, and the teaching activities of
the campus did not suffer a major
shutdown.
Monitors Posted
At the Hansen Labs, however, the
doors were locked, and two monitors
posted at each after a crowd on White
Plaza announced its intention to
march on the building around 1 p.m.
Encina Hall reported little disruption
of work despite a large crowd which
moved through the personnel offices
in the afternoon.
Large undergraduate lecture classes
were a prime target for the strikers,
especially the Biology and Human
Biology courses held Friday morning
in Dinkelspiel (see related story this
Elsewhere on campus, when 30 to
40 de' nstrators entered a Biology 23
lectun with some 200 students, Prof.

Michael Johnson gave his class two
minutes to decide whether they
wished to leave, stating he was willing
to repeat the lecture again. Only about
20 students walked out.
'Political Decision'
Johnson was later asked to talk
about his "political decision" in
holding class, and the students re
sponded overwhelmingly with hisses to
the demand.
Geology 1, with only one-third of
its students in attendance, was ter
minated by Prof. Konrad Krauskopf
when demonstrators made their way
into the class.
Oceanography, also held in geology
comer, had just one-half to three
quarters attendance, but continued
without incident.
At the Law School, where about 40
held a non-coercive picket outside, a
popular course on Criminal Procedure,
taught by Prof. Anthony Amsterdam,
was attended by only about one
quarter of its normal enrollment. Law
faculty as well as students indicated
support for the strike, which featured
a noon rally and teach-ins during the
afternoon.
Leaflets
In some areas, for example the
Math corner where classes were gener
ally well-attended, strikers went from
class to class passing out leaflets,
without disrupting lectures.
But at Richard Eastman's Chemis
try 3 class Friday morning, 10
protesters who walked in on a normal
crowd of 125 heard one student call
out, "Why don't you shut up and
listen?"
Biology 1 was virtually empty when
the class met at 9 a.m. in Cubberley

Auditorium. Prof. Paul Ehrlich went
ahead with his lecture, although only
about 25 out of 100 students were
there. Demonstrators tried briefly to
disrupt the lecture, but gave up when
they met with heavy resistance from
students.
Movie
About 60 demonstrators tried to
block students at Psychology 1 in
Jordan Hall, but were largely unsuc
cessful. About 100 students showed
up for a movie. Prof. Daryl Bern
refused to teach, telling the class "I'm
beginning to feel old when I realize
that the war has been going for half
the lifetime of most of my students."
Bern put the movie on the projector,
and then walked out.
Only 45 students came to Political
Science 10, taught by Prof. Robert
Horn. The class enrollment is about
120. Demonstrators chanted obsceni
ties outside the class, and opened the
door twice, but didn't really make
much of an effort to close the class.
The doors of the Political Science
Department were locked all day.
Richard Brody's Political Science
131 met—with a smaller attendance
than usual—but discussed the war
rather than usual class material.
Class Moved
A group of about 20 demonstrators
entered a German class on the outer
Quad. The class -only 10 or 12
students were there -moved upstairs to
the professor's office when the demon
strators refused to leave.
The same group moved into a
discussion section of Economics 52
meeting in the basement of the
History Department. Paul Loeb, made
a brief speech asking students to leave

the class, and three of the 25 did.
The crowd moved over to the
Graduate School of Business and
entered four classes, where they met
with 100 percent attendance and 100
percent disapproval. All of the profes
sors involved invited Loeb to give a
quick speech, and he did, always
asking that students walk out of the
classes. But not one did, and several
argued the morality of the war and the
morality of the strike with demon
strators. There was often applause
from the students when someone won
a vocal duel with Loeb.
Leave
The final stop of the group was an
Art History class in Annenburg Audi
torium, where the professor told them,
"You are taking up my time and you
had better leave." They did, tripping a
fire alarm as they trailed out.
A "day of protest" announced by
the departmental council of French
and Italian caused many classes there
to be cancelled.
Physics 53, taught by Professor
Walter Meyerhof did not meet. In
stead, about 50 people attended a
teach-in on the social responsibility of
sciences, at the Physics lecture hall.
Economics 1, Anthropology 18,
and Psychology 60 did not meet. A
number of smaller classes were either
postponed or canceled.
Outside of Humanities and
Sciences, however, most classes pro
ceeded normally. Professors in the
Department of Aeronautics and Astro
nautics commented that class atten
dance was "as good, if not better, than
usual."
The University news service report
ed that classes in the Business School
continued as normal with approxi
mately the usual attendance although
one class was disrupted.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Robert
Grey noticed that a number of
students absent during the Cambodia
strike two years ago were in class
Friday.
His students, he thought, found the
strike "understandable but counter
productive," and added, "people don't
take it so seriously as a method of
protest now."
Atmosphere Calm
Secretaries on Quad, quizzed about
activities in their departments, found
the atmosphere calm. One said, it was
"very quiet compared to the last
strike.. .not a lot of people buzzing
around." Some added, however, that
Fridays are normally quiet, with fewer
classes scheduled to meet than on
other weekdays.
The atmosphere at Hansen Labs,
where strikers claim work on elec
tronic countermeasure directly ap
plicable to the Vietnam War is being
done, was not so relaxed. One
employee joked, "You're in an armed
fort here."
Marshall O'Neill, associate director
of Hansen, has seen to is that
personnel have been at the labs at
night recently, and added that "people
are working here during the evening
normally."
'Temporarily Closed'
Signs Friday on the doors of the
buildings of the labs stated "Building
Temporarily Closed to Public."
The arrival of demonstrators Friday
morning was "unexpected," O'Neill
said, and added that he had been told
plenty of police would be one hand.
The sizeable group which entered
Hansen far outnumbered the police,
O'Neill added.
Despite the deployment of lab staff
around noon to watch the doors,
many continued their working day
uninterrupted. Some secretaries said
that they were even able to hold a
bridal shower for a co-worker.
Behind locked doors in Building 10,
where strikers appeared outside to
chant during the morning, members of
the Presidential Staff, including
Robert Rosensweig, James Siena, and
John Schwartz listened to KZSU to
keep informed of the day's develop
ments. President Richard Lyman
worked at home.
ASSU Council of Presidents mem
ber Ann Kimball accused Lyman of
perpetrating the morning's violence by
calling police on campus, at a noon
rally on White Plaza.

Lyman responded that the Univer
sity has no control of police tactics
"because it's legally impossible." He
added that "without the police the
University would not have been kept
open."
Schwartz said the outside police
were forewarned of possible trouble
on campus, but added that he had had
virtually no contact with them once
on campus. A call was made in the
afternoon, he said, to ask if Santa
Clara deputies would be deployed
Friday night on campus, however.
In the wake of the morning's
demonstrations, before the mass ar
rests took place, Provost William Miller
issued a statement saying in part that
despite strong anti-war feelings on
campus, "The vast majority of faculty,
students, and staff do not believe that
opposition to the war should be
demonstrated by closing the Univer
sity.
"Some efforts have been made to
disrupt a few large lecture classes this
morning, with limited success. Other
classes are being conducted as sched
uled, and all University offices and
laboratories are open and function
ing," Miller's statement read.
Off campus, about 150 student
supporters of Sen. George McGovern
passed out 12,000 leaflets in the
Stanford Industrial Park and nearby
shopping centers, according to Larry

Diamond, a former member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents.
He described the main activities of
the strike as "people talking to
themselves and not doing shit."
At the Stanford Medical School,
some students claimed to have skipped
classes in support of the strike, and a
noon rally was held there to express
feeling against the Vietnam War.
Engineering Corner, the target of
large groups of protesters two years
*go, received little attention from the
strikers. Instead a placard reading "on
strike for more picnics" was displayed
outside.
In Encina Hall, a secretary describ
ed a 10 to 15 minute march of
protesters through the Personnel Of
fices as noisy, but said, "Most people
continued with their work to a large
degree," behind locked doors.
Pete Knutson said there will be a
rally at 4:00 on Sunday in White Plaza
"to decide whether to strike" on
Monday. He added, "it looks pretty
likely right now."
Knutson also said he was trying to
organize a Legal Defense Fund benefit
dance Saturday night.
There will be a meeting on the
Columbae House Lawn at 1 p.m.
Sunday, to discuss the future of the
strike, and ways to relate non-violently
to the events of the last few days,
according to David Josephson.
