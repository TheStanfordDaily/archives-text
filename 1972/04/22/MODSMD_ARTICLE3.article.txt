# 15 Arrested For Door Blocking, Large Crowd Roams Labs, Encina
## 
### GLENN GARVIN JIM WASCHER 
Scattered acts of violence—from
police and demonstrators alike—took
place across campus Friday morning as
350 protesters tried to close the
University as part of a nationwide
student strike against the war in
Indochina.
There were 15 arrests, several
clubbings, broken windows and scat
tered class disruptions between 6:30
a.m., when the strike began and 2:30
p.m. when the demonstrators marched
to El Camino Real, where 210 of them
were arrested.
Over 100 police dotted the campus,
including Tactical Squads from Santa
Clara County, the City of Santa Clara
and Palo Alto, and regular police from
such diverse places as Sunnyvale and
San Mateo County.
Police officials claimed that 15
Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies
were injured by rocks, four or five
requiring treatment. None of the
officers were admitted to a hospital.

By the time the strike was two
hours old, it had already produced 15
arrests.
Twelve persons were arrested at
7:40 a.m. when Santa Clara County
and Palo Alto Tactical Squads cleared
a sit-in on the front steps of Encina
Hall.
Only 40 minutes later, the twoTac
Squads arrested three more demon
strators behind the annex of the
Hansen Microwave Laboratories, in
cluding ASSUGuestProfessor of Social
Thought Dave Josephson.
Illegal
About 260 demonstrators were
blocking entrance ways to Encina
before 8 a.m., after an early morning
meeting in White Plaza, and sat on the
steps around the building for about 40
minutes before Lt. Don Tamm of the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's Depart
ment declared the group an illegal
assembly.
Tamm's men advanced toward the
70 demonstrators standing by the
front doors of Encina, and most the of

protesters sat down. The police began
grabbing demonstrators by their necks
and hauling them away.
One or two scuffles broke out when
the protesters tried to resist; some
bystanders claimed that a number of
those the police dragged off had not
been blocking doorways.
The 11 people that the police
removed from the steps were pulled
across the lawn and frisked against
police cars in front of the building.
Most the demonstrators scattered
when the police reached the steps. A
crowd of about 200 surrounded the
police autos, shouting "You fucking
pigs" and "Off the pigs."
At 7:47 a.m. the crowd started a
moving picket line, circling around the
police cars. Some of the protesters
tried to get the names of those who
were being arrested, with varying
degrees of success. All 11 were
eventually put into a police van, which
they began to rock back and forth
from inside, to loud cheering from the
crowd outside.
Moments later, police began to
clear a path through the crowd so the
van could leave. Another demonstrator
-was arrested when she apparently
failed to move fast enought to suit the
police.
Trespass
All of those arrested were charged
with trespassing; one had additional
charges of resisting arrest or assault

and battery placed against her.
At 7:55 a.m. the police left, and
the crowd of demonstrators, which
had swelled to 300, began a march
across campus to the Hansen Labs,
where they say war-related electronics
research is conducted.
As the demonstrators left, em
ployees began to filter into Encina
from across the street where many of
them had been watching the action.
At least three windows were broken
as the crowd marched through the
Quad.
The crowd arrived at the Labs at
8:05 to find eight Tac Squad members
waiting for them. Suspended student
Pete Knutson led a dash past the main
Labs to the annex in the rear, which
he opened with a key. Nearly 100 of
the protesters managed to squeeze
inside, and Daily reporters heard the
sound of glass breaking on at least two
occasions.
The demonstrators tipped over a
laser inside the building, damaging but
not destroying it. The laser, worth
from $10,000 to $12,000 will be
returned to the manufacturer, accord
ing to Marshall O'Neill, associate
director of the lab.
The crowd started a picket line
moving in one end of the annex and
out the other. By 8:20 a.m. there were
44 police on the scene.

arrests on El Camino and appears to be ill shock.
Tamrn and Stanford Security Chief
Marvin Herrington conferred for a
moment, and then five Tac Squad men
moved into the crowd, and snatched
Josephson, who, using a bullhorn, had
just taken a vote of the crowd that
indicated they would leave when the
picket line was declared an illegal
assembly.
Josephson, who was booked for
inciting to riot and trespassing, shout
ed "I am dangerous because I have a
mouth!" as he was frisked. (He was
released on $440 bail Friday after
noon.)
Seconds after Josephson's arrest,
the Tac Squads charged with clubs
swinging, and arrested two more
demonstrators—Gini Faller, a junior,
and Nancy Fraas, a non-student. Fraas
was semiconcious after being clubbed,
and was dragged into the waiting
police van.
No Charge
After the charge, police seized
another student who refused to let
them make a detailed examination of
his Stanford ID card, but he was
released later without being charged.
Tamm argued for several minutes
with Knutson and freshman Mark Rich
over what the demonstrators could do
and where they could do it, but
without much success for either side.
A number of students were yelling
"Don't talk to that pig" and several of
Tamm's men asked him "What are you

rapping to these people for? Don't rap
with them, Don."
The crowd moved back to White
Plaza, with a side trip through the
Electronic Research Lab, where they
chanted slogans and scuffled with a
worker who tried to take pictures of
them.
In White Plaza the group began to
split up and go to large classes to try
and shut them down.
Probably the biggest disruption of a
class all day was at 10 a.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, where demon
strators tried to close Biology 1. A
number of fights broke out when the
crowd of 50 forcibly tried to prevent
anyone from entering the class.
Aaron Mangianello, chairman of the
Central Committee of Venceremos,
fought with several people who tried
to enter the class, and broke a door
during the scuffles. Mangianello, who
was on campus in defiance of a year-old
restraining order, was being sought
later in the day by police with a
warrent for assault and battery.
Tim Gadus, a long-time Palo Alto
activist, also engaged in slugging
matches in the lobby, and later hit a
student inside the auditorium.
Complaint
Finally, student Forrest Martin
complained to police that he couldn't
get inside, and Tamm declared the
sit-in an illegal assembly at 10:43 a.m.
The Tac Squad cleared the entrances,
and five minutes later police withdrew
from the doors.

Dinkelspiel remained the scene of
confrontation when Human Biology 1
met in the building at 11 a.m. It was
vocal rather than physical, however, as
Prof. Colin Pittendrigh exchanged
sharp words with strikers.
Pittendrigh declared he is firmly
opposed to the war but denounced
coercive strikes. He encountered heck
ling, which prompted him to tell the
demonstrators to "get out." When
they continued to shout, Pittendrigh
observed that "This display of intel
lectual power from the back over
whelms me." Later he said: "I'm so
tempted to debate you powerful
intellects in the back, but I refuse to
take advantage of you."
Dance
When the demonstrators started
chanting "On strike," Pittendrigh
dance in rhythm, and won prolonged
applause from the students who had
come to class.
Several times during the two classes
the Dinkelspiel fire alarm went off,
and it was finally disconnected and
put under guard by a Stanford
fireman.
Earlier there was a disturbance at
President Lyman's office in the Quad
when demonstrators spotted a confer
ence between Stanford security officer
William Wullschleger, presidental legal
advisor James Siena, presidnetial assist
ant John Schwartz, and Security Chief
Herrington in a room on the second
floor.
The protesters shouted "you little

lizard" and "y° u rat " an d two of
them made an abortive attempt to
scale the wall and get in an open
window on the second floor.
In back of the office, a striker
knocked away the earner of police
photographer Luther Long, who
wrestled with him briefly and tried to
place him under arrest, while two
Stanford security guards looked on
and argued about who should try and
help him. Law professor John Merry
man also grappled with the demon
strator and ripped his shirt. The crowd
of 80 followed Long around Building
10 until Herrington appeared from
inside and broke up the shoving
match.
Demonstrators remained outside
Building 10 all morning. A number of
times speakers in White Plaza said that
Lyman was being held under "house
arrest," but he wasn't actually in the
office.
At 9 a.m. there was a scuffle in
White Plaza when demonstrators tried
to take down the American flag in
front of the Post Office. Herrington
battled with several protestors, and
someone finally cut the rope to the
flagpole.
Two law students made a citizen's
arrest about noon after a photographer
working for campus police lied to
them. Students Andrew Lipps and
Mick Goldstein arrested Nick Outen
because he misrepresented himself as a
San Francisco Chronicle cameraman.
Outen, who had lied to Daily

reporters as well as others who asked
about his identity, was stopped by the
law students under a law against false
impersonation, which carries a possible
two-year prison sentence. When the
students brought Outen to Sheriff's
deputies, they frisked the students but
not Outen.
Sue?
After some discussion, Deputy
District Attorney Dennis Lempert
decided not to charge Outen and
suggested that Outen might be able to
sue the students for false arrest.
The two students arrested Outen
after he told them he was "Bob
Keeley" of the Chronicle. The two
called the Chronicle and discovered
that the real Keeley worked in the
advertising department and was in the
office at the time.
Security chief Herrington conceded
that his office, acting under orders
from presidential assistant Schwartz,
"got a couple" of outside photo
graphers to work in plainclothes for
the day.
Police spokesmen later claimed that
Outen and a partner were told to stop
lying about their identities soon after
the arrests were made.
Nearly 1200 people attended a
noon rally at White Plaza as strikers
returned from their visits to morning
classes. As the rally began, 150 Palo
Alto High School students marched up
to the Plaza along the Outer Quad.
During the march to Stanford, two
Paly High students were arrested. One
female marcher reportedly was arrest
ed after she spit on a policeman and
was clubbed when she cursed him. A
male demonstrator was arrested after
he came to her assistance.
At the rally, Diane Fields of the
ASSU Council of Presidents told the
crowd "the Council endorses the strike
and supports your actions." Citing the
effectiveness of picketing classes,
Fields said, "We will support the
strike's continuance beyond one day if
that is the consensus."
Fields also told of a rumor she had
heard regarding a black man becoming
isolated from the main group of
demonstrators Thursday night and
being shot at four times by police. The
report has been denied by KZSU
reporters at the scene and by police.
Ann Kimball, another member of
the Council, also referred to the
Thursday night rioting, saying, "It's
very important to see where the
real violence comes from. They club
bed one woman unconscious and
dragged her off to the station. That is
violence."

Kimball asked "Are we responsi
ble" for the violence "or is it the
responsibility of John Schwartz and
Richard Lyman who called these
police on campus?" She said she was
"asking the Faculty Senate and the
Academic Council to condemn the real
violence on this campus: the violence
done by the police."
At 1:15, 10 minutes after Vencere
mos member Don Lee, who is under
three quarter suspension from Stan
ford, proposed that "we march to
Hansen and then on to who knows
where," the crowd left for Hansen.
Wooden Gate
The crowd circled Hansen, clapping
and chanting. As they neared the front
entrance several protesters, apparently
high school students, broke down a
wooden gate leading to a courtyard in
Hansen, but no one followed them in.
The crowd then moved back along
Via Pueblo and up Via Palou past the
Stanford Electronics Laboratories
(SEL). As the demonstrators moved
along Panama Street, three rocks
thrown from the group broke windows
in the Durand (Aeronautics and
Astronautics) Building. As the win
dows broke, many in the crowd booed
and shouted "No!"
Continuing on Panama and past
UGLY, the demonstrators appraoched
Encina Hall once again. At the rear of
Encina, a protester broke the window
in a door to gain access to the locked
building. A large number of people
entered through the rear door and at
2:05 opened the Employment Office
door at the front to those waiting
outside. About 200 people ended up
inside Encina. At 2:07, the breaking
of a glass door leading to what used to
be the Cashier's Office provoked 10
Sunnyvale police officers to rush the
steps and porch to clear them of
demonstrators. Having decided not to
hold the building, most of the
protesters had left. Only 50 remained
inside at the time of the charge.
Rocks
During their sweep, several police
clubbed protesters. Some police were
hit by rocks thrown from the crowd
watching on the lawn in front of
Encina. Arrested were Jens P. Chris
tiansen, a graduate in economics and
Grant Thompson, apparently a non
student.
(Other Daily reporters working on
this story included Patty Fels, Kevin
Smith, Larry Liebert, Larry Hummer,
Scott Thacher, Dave Thiemann, and
Ed Kohn.)
