### GLENN GARVIN JIM WASCHER 
Scattered acts of violence—from
police and demonstrators alike—took
place across campus Friday morning as
350 protesters tried to close the
University as part of a nationwide
student strike against the war in
Indochina.
There were 15 arrests, several
clubbings, broken windows and scat
tered class disruptions between 6:30
a.m., when the strike began and 2:30
p.m. when the demonstrators marched
to El Camino Real, where 210 of them
were arrested.
Over 100 police dotted the campus,
including Tactical Squads from Santa
Clara County, the City of Santa Clara
and Palo Alto, and regular police from
such diverse places as Sunnyvale and
San Mateo County.
Police officials claimed that 15
Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies
were injured by rocks, four or five
requiring treatment. None of the
officers were admitted to a hospital.

By the time the strike was two
hours old, it had already produced 15
arrests.
Twelve persons were arrested at
7:40 a.m. when Santa Clara County
and Palo Alto Tactical Squads cleared
a sit-in on the front steps of Encina
Hall.
Only 40 minutes later, the twoTac
Squads arrested three more demon
strators behind the annex of the
Hansen Microwave Laboratories, in
cluding ASSUGuestProfessor of Social
Thought Dave Josephson.
Illegal
About 260 demonstrators were
blocking entrance ways to Encina
before 8 a.m., after an early morning
meeting in White Plaza, and sat on the
steps around the building for about 40
minutes before Lt. Don Tamm of the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's Depart
ment declared the group an illegal
assembly.
Tamm's men advanced toward the
70 demonstrators standing by the
front doors of Encina, and most the of

protesters sat down. The police began
grabbing demonstrators by their necks
and hauling them away.
One or two scuffles broke out when
the protesters tried to resist; some
bystanders claimed that a number of
those the police dragged off had not
been blocking doorways.
The 11 people that the police
removed from the steps were pulled
across the lawn and frisked against
police cars in front of the building.
Most the demonstrators scattered
when the police reached the steps. A
crowd of about 200 surrounded the
police autos, shouting "You fucking
pigs" and "Off the pigs."
At 7:47 a.m. the crowd started a
moving picket line, circling around the
police cars. Some of the protesters
tried to get the names of those who
were being arrested, with varying
degrees of success. All 11 were
eventually put into a police van, which
they began to rock back and forth
from inside, to loud cheering from the
crowd outside.
Moments later, police began to
clear a path through the crowd so the
van could leave. Another demonstrator
-was arrested when she apparently
failed to move fast enought to suit the
police.
Trespass
All of those arrested were charged
with trespassing; one had additional
charges of resisting arrest or assault

and battery placed against her.
At 7:55 a.m. the police left, and
the crowd of demonstrators, which
had swelled to 300, began a march
across campus to the Hansen Labs,
where they say war-related electronics
research is conducted.
As the demonstrators left, em
ployees began to filter into Encina
from across the street where many of
them had been watching the action.
At least three windows were broken
as the crowd marched through the
Quad.
The crowd arrived at the Labs at
8:05 to find eight Tac Squad members
waiting for them. Suspended student
Pete Knutson led a dash past the main
Labs to the annex in the rear, which
he opened with a key. Nearly 100 of
the protesters managed to squeeze
inside, and Daily reporters heard the
sound of glass breaking on at least two
occasions.
The demonstrators tipped over a
laser inside the building, damaging but
not destroying it. The laser, worth
from $10,000 to $12,000 will be
returned to the manufacturer, accord
ing to Marshall O'Neill, associate
director of the lab.
The crowd started a picket line
moving in one end of the annex and
out the other. By 8:20 a.m. there were
44 police on the scene.
