# Rallies, Violence Mark Strike On Campuses Around Nation
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
The National Student Association
reported at least 169 anti-war strikes
at college campuses across the nation
yesterday. The Student Mobilization
Committee headquarters in New York
City called for an Emergency Air War
Student Conference to be held at New
York University on Sunday. They
invited 120 schools.
In Chicopee, Mass., 95 demon
strators were arrested when a crowd of
250—largely students from Amherst,
University of Massachussets, and
Hampshire College—attempted to
block the entrances to the Westover
Air Force Base. General William
Westmoreland was reportedly hit by a
tomato in that protest.
In Providence, Rhode Island, about
500 demonstrators attended a memor
ial religous service for those who have
died in Indochina, conducted on the
steps of the state capitol building.
After the service about 200 of the
demonstrators entered the capitol
building where they were addressed by
Governor Frank Licht, who told them
that they had every 7 right to be there,
stating, "The state house belongs to
you." After Licht's speech some of the
protestors entered the Senate galleries
where a resolution was under consider
ation condemning the renewed bomb
ing of North Vietnam and demanding
the withdrawl of American forces
from Vietnam within 30 days.
Associated Press estimates the num
ber of demonstrators marching in
downtown Austin, Texas, ranged from
from 700 to 2,000 people. The
marchers, mainly University of Texas
students, were prevented from enter
ing the downtown area by riot police
who used tear gas and nightsticks to
turn back the crowd. Eight persons
were reported arrested.
Between 5,000 and 8,000 people
gathered at a rally on Boston Com
mons. Several hundred of these dem
onstrators left the rally for Boston
University where they forced their
way into the office of the dean of
students.
Harvard Marchers
The Boston Commons rally was
also joined by approximately 300

Harvard students who marched to the
commons from Harvard Square. Class
attendance at Harvard was reportedly
about half that of usual.
About 300 students at Princeton
marched across the campus to demand
that the ROTC program on campus be
eliminated.
At the University of Michigan over
1000 demonstrators marched to a
downtown Ann Arbor Air Force-Navy
recruiting office where several win
dows were broken. Michigan students
also trashed the university ROTC
building, causing an estimated $3000
to $5000 worth of damage.
Another 750 Michigan student
demonstrators confronted riot police
on U.S. Route 73 about three miles
from campus. Police used tear gas to
disperse the crowd.
A New Haven anti-war rally drew
about 2000 Yale students who were
addressed by former Connecticut
Senatorial candidate Joseph Duffy.
Duffy urged the students to maintain
their "sense of outrage through May,
through June, through July, and
through November."
Duffy also urged students to
support the nationwide moratorium to
protest the war that was announced by
a coalition of Washington anti-war
leaders yesterday. The moratorium,
already endorsed by more than 20
Senators and Representatives, is
scheduled for May 4, the second
anniversary of the Kent State Univer
sity shootings.
Recruitment Stopped
President Robert Wood of the
University of Massachusetts ordered
suspension of military recruitment as a
gesture of opposition to the air
attacks.
A rally at the University of
Maryland drew about 2,000 students.
National Guardsmen patrolled the
reportedly calm campus throughout
the day.
Classes were officially suspended at
Columbia University in N.Y. yester
day, and although about 50 demon
strators maintained a picket line
around the university's School of
International Affairs, the campus was
almost totally deserted.

Bruce Franklin, ousted Stanford
English professor, called the Daily
yesterday (collect) from Columbia
University to report that 120 colleges
were on strike in the New England and
Mid-Atlantic states, reported that "a
lot of schools people didn't expect"
were on strike.
He said that at Yale University
three unions representing workers
there called a "partial work stoppage"
in sympathy with the student strike.
He said that a member of the Central
Labor Council for New Haven was one
of the main speakers at a rally there
yesterday. He said the labor leader
supported an anti-war strike.
Although about 2,000 students
voted at an early morning rally to
strike at the University of Washington,
classes proceeded fairly normally at
the 33,000 student campus.
California Protests
A rally of between 1,000 and 1,500
people at the UC Davis campus, which
voted to strike, also proved ineffective
in cutting down class attendance.
After the rally 600 students marched
downtown in a manner described by
the police as peaceful and orderly.
At Berkeley, despite an attempted
strike, most students were attending
classes yesterday. Student volunteers
spent much of the morning cleaning
up the litter strewn across the campus
during Thursday's anti-war rally.
Five persons, three of them Berk
eley students were banned for varying
lengths of time from the UC campus
under a 1969 law which gives the
Chancellor of each campus the right to
exclude individuals for a certain length
of time.
Car pools took some Berkeley
students to the Alemeda Naval Sta
tion, where an aircraft carrier was
scheduled to return from a tour of
duty in Vietnam. Alemeda county
deputies reported that only about 20
students showed up. Another 50
students went to the San Francisco
Federal Building, the site of an earlier
confrontation this week.
At the UC Santa Barbara campus
about 800 people took part in a
peaceful rally and candlelight proces

sion. Some 150 to 200 demonstrators
also marched to the campus ROTC
building where they encountered a
dozen riot-equipped policemen. No
incidents occurred, however, and the
protestors left of their own accord
after a brief sit-in.
About 50 students took over the
administration building at Foothill
College in Los Altos Hills yesterday,
but they left voluntarily after an hour.
Overall, the strike appeared success
ful in mounting a nationwide anti-war
protest. However, the protests were
less intense and participation was less
widespread than in the strike protest
ing the Cambodian invasion two years
ago.
The National Student Association
reported at least 169 anti-war strikes

about half that of usual.
About 300 students at Princeton
marched across the campus to demand

voted to strike, also proved ineffective
in cutting down class attendance.
After the rally 600 students marched
downtown in a manner described by
the police as peaceful and orderly.
At Berkeley, despite an attempted

protestors left of their own accord
after a brief sit-in.
About 50 students took over the
administration building at Foothill
College in Los Altos Hills yesterday,
but they left voluntarily after an hour.

widespread than in the strike protest
ing the Cambodian invasion two years
ago.
The National Student Association
reported at least 169 anti-war strikes

ation condemning the renewed bomb
ing of North Vietnam and demanding
the withdrawl of American forces
from Vietnam within 30 days.
Associated Press estimates the num

University where they forced their
way into the office of the dean of

Harvard students who marched to the
commons from Harvard Square. Class
attendance at Harvard was reportedly
about half that of usual.
About 300 students at Princeton
marched across the campus to demand
that the ROTC program on campus be
eliminated.
At the University of Michigan over
1000 demonstrators marched to a
downtown Ann Arbor Air Force-Navy

from campus. Police used tear gas to
disperse the crowd.
A New Haven anti-war rally drew
about 2000 Yale students who were
addressed by former Connecticut
Senatorial candidate Joseph Duffy.

their "sense of outrage through May,
through June, through July, and
through November."
Duffy also urged students to
support the nationwide moratorium to
protest the war that was announced by
a coalition of Washington anti-war
leaders yesterday. The moratorium,
already endorsed by more than 20
Senators and Representatives, is
scheduled for May 4, the second
anniversary of the Kent State Univer
sity shootings.

the 33,000 student campus.
California Protests
A rally of between 1,000 and 1,500
people at the UC Davis campus, which
voted to strike, also proved ineffective
in cutting down class attendance.
After the rally 600 students marched
downtown in a manner described by
the police as peaceful and orderly.
At Berkeley, despite an attempted
strike, most students were attending
classes yesterday. Student volunteers
spent much of the morning cleaning
up the litter strewn across the campus
during Thursday's anti-war rally.
Five persons, three of them Berk
eley students were banned for varying
lengths of time from the UC campus
under a 1969 law which gives the

exclude individuals for a certain length
of time.
Car pools took some Berkeley
students to the Alemeda Naval Sta
tion, where an aircraft carrier was
