I cannot go anymore to the marshes
Where the gatekeeper smiles at the poisons

For my heart belongs to the one on the

Where the doves build their nests

Looking for shelter in this thunder and pain
And you, like some windmill,
Weaves light where it's storming
Let it rain, let it rain,

I cannot go anymore to the marshes
Where the gatekeeper smiles at the poisons

For my heart belongs to the one on the

Where the doves build their nests

Looking for shelter in this thunder and pain
And you, like some windmill,
Weaves light where it's storming
Let it rain, let it rain,

I cannot go anymore to the marshes
Where the gatekeeper smiles at the poisons
he's made.
For my heart belongs to the one on the
mountain
Where the doves build their nests
in the sunripened glade.
For I am the mercury, light of the morning
Looking for shelter in this thunder and pain
And you, like some windmill,
Weaves light where it's storming
Let it rain, let it rain,
Ijet,'f ra ' n on the mountain.
