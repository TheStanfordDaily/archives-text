# SLAC Energy Boost Planned
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
The Stanford Linear Accelerator
will double the energy of its electron
beams in the next few years, provided
that the Atomic Energy Commission
approves a $17 million addition to
SLAC's budget for the project.
The method for increasing SLAC's
power--recirculating the electrons
through the two-mile accelerator for a
second energy boost—was the most
economical of several possibilities
which planners at SLAC have consider
ed in recent years.
The plans for the recirculating
apparatus were developed at SLAC
with the encouragement of the AEC.
Already the world's largest linear
accelerator by far, SLAC would
accelerate electrons to an energy of 40
billion electron volts (GeV), compared
to the present 20 GeV.
To recirculate the electrons requires
two huge bending magnets at each end
of the accelerator, and drift tubes
which will allow the electrons to make
122 round trips back and forth along
the length of SLAC before they are

re-injected into the accelerator itself.
Short Rests
Because SLAC does not operate
continuously, but rests for approxi
mately three thousands of a second
between each short burst (about two
millionths of a second) of high-energy
electrons, these particles must be
stored for the comparatively long
period between bursts before they can
be re-injected.
Travelling at the speed of light, the
electrons make up this time lag of
three thousandths of a second by
travelling about 500 miles through the
drift tubes.
But besides the production of more
energetic electrons, it will be possible
to make the electrons available at
shorter intervals, by peeling them off
from the recirculating apparatus each
time they make a round trip. This
would vastly improve what is called
the "duty cycle."
According to SLAC physicist Dr.
William Hermansfeldt, who developed
plans for the project, the increase of
the duty cycle is just as useful for

experimental work as the doubling of
energy. Many experiments which pro
duce a significant event only rarely
would produce data 100 times faster
with the proposed apparatus.
Selling Point
Nevertheless the higher energy will
be SLAC's selling point when the U.S.
Congress looks over the proposal.
While the A EC has expressed "strong
interest" in the project, according to
Hermansfeldt, the Congress must also
give its approval.
The claim to be made is that SLAC
will double its value for a fraction of
its appraised value by this small
addition to double the energy of its
electron beams. The accelerator's ori
ginal cost was $114 million compared
to the estimated $17 million cost for
the recirculating apparatus.
The physical addition to the exist
ing structure will consist mainly of
two loops, 100 yards wide, at each end
of SLAC, which use magnets to curve
the high energy electrons back in the
opposite direction. The loops, hidden
underground, will require only a small
addition to SLAC's leasehold boundar
ies.
In addition, a 1000 foot accelerator
section will be added along the drift
tubes to maintain the energy of the
circulating electrons.
Range Of Experiments
The range of experiments which
could be done at SLAC should greatly
increase, according to Wolfgang Panof
sky SLAC director. Some of these
include "those in electron scattering
(which have recently revealed that the
neutron and proton appear to have a
granular substructure), the ability to
study particle reactions produced by
exceedingly high energy X-rays, and
studies using SLAC's beams of second
ary particles. All will be greatly
extended in terms of the range of
scientific questions that can be answer
ed," Panofsky said.
While the higher energy beam is
paradoxically described as "sensitive,"
its chief benefit comes from probing
into smaller and smaller structures, the
neutron and proton for example.
However, officials claim that SLAC
could hold off on adding the recircu

lating apparatus without danger of
lotting the machine become out
moded.
But Hermansfeldt feels that despite
SLAC's prominence, "You don't just
try to do the same things better and
invent reasons for existing. We are
literally on a frontier of high-energy
physics and you don't want to beat it
to death. You must establish a new
frontier."
Tentative 1973 Start
If approved, work on the addition
would begin in the fall of 1973 and
would require three years to build and
check out. By the time the drift tubes
and loops are added, SLAC's energy on
its own will have been increased from
20 to 25 GeV (billion electron volts).
This will be done in the next two
years by replacing the original 20
megawatt klystron tubes which supply
power to the accelerator with 30
megawatt klystrons as the others wear
out. With recirculation the total power
would be at least 42.5 GeV.
Further energy increases would
require adding 40 or 60 megawatt
klystrons, although the technology for
the 60 megawatt tube is still some
ways away.
A more outlandish possibility is the
installation of a superconducting ac
celerator section along the drift tubes,
similar to one being developed at the
Stanford High Energy Physics Labora
tory.
A combination of the super
conducting section and the 60 mega
watt klystrons might put the total
energy of SLAC at 60 GeV, an
eventuality that is still very far iri the
future.
