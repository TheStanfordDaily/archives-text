# Zoning Hearing
## 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council will
consider tonight the controversial
office b u i I d in g -Y MCA
development being proposed for

the Mayfield School site on El
Carnino Real.
Stanford and a private
development firm have requested
a zone change to permit
construction of the two high-rise
office towers, a YMCA building,
and a parking structure on a
parcel of Stanford land now
occupied by a school building.
The city planning commission
recommended against the zone
change. A similar decision by the
city council would kill the
project.
The meeting begins at 7:30
p.m. at the City Hall, 250
Hamilton Avenue.
