# Golfers Win Easily As Colvin Stars
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Three subpar rounds —
highlighted another victorious
weekend for Stanford's golf team
as the Cards rolled past California
and the alumni on the Stanford
course.
Stanford defeated Cal 33-21 on
Friday and recorded a 44-10
victory over the alumni Saturday.
Meanwhile the frosh crushed Cal
41-12 and beat the alumni 36-24.
Denny Colvin fired the
weekend's first subpar round, a 68
in Friday's victory over Cal.
Colvin, who just broke into the
varsity lineup a few weeks ago,
carded four birdies and an eagle
enroute to his three under par
performance. He also combined
with Bruce Robertson for an
amazing nine under par 62 in the
simultaneous best-ball
competition.
Stanford's other starters
couldn't match Colvin's 68 but all

five played solid golf in their final
intercollegiate match before next
week's U.S. Collegiate Invitational
at Stanford. Gary Vanier and
Dave Baskins each shot 73, Tom
Keelin and Robertson shot 75,
and Aly Trompas had 76.
In Saturday's matches against
the alumni, Stanford came up
with two more subpar rounds.
Dennis Conrad fired a two under
par 69 while Robertson broke out
of a recent slump with a 70.
Colvin, Peter Fox, and Mike
McGowan also played well, each
carding 73's. Other leading scores
included Baskins with 74, Vanier
and Trompas with 75's, and Mike
Mcßride with 76.
Kent Winton led the grads with
a strong 73 while Wheeler Farrish,
Bob Bauchier, and Rich Harris
contributed 75's.
Stanford's varsity record is
now 9-0-1 and the frosh have a
perfect 10-0 mark.
