# Bear Batsmen Defeat Cards In Two Games
## 
### MIKE HERMAN 
The Stanford varsity baseball team was dealt a serious blow to its
championship hopes this past weekend as they lost two of three games
to the California Golden Bears in a home-and-away series, winning the
first game 9-0, before losing both ends of a doubleheader, 9-8 and 5-3.
Coupled with Southern California's sweep over UCLA, the
Cardinals dropped two full games off the pace in the race for the
Southern Division championship. USC now has a record of 7-2, with
Stanford and Cal tied for second with identical 5-4 records. UCLA
remains far back with a 1-8 record.
The pivotal game of the series was the first game of the Saturday
doubleheader. For six of the game's seven innings, Stanford had just
about overwhelmed the Bears in every facet of the game and led 8-1
going into the final inning.
Lucich Homers
Mark Lucich, who had been benched in the first game of the series
because of his poor hitting in the UCLA series, hit two homeruns, a
three-run smash in the third inning and a two-run drive in the fifth.
Nick Peterson had pitched well, scattering four hits through the
first six innings and maintaining a shutout for the first four.
The top of the seventh started with Peterson retiring the first man
he faced. Pete Burman, the California left fielder, then singled.
Secondbaseman Bobby Tulk then popped out and, with two outs in
the final inning and a seven run lead, Stanford appeared to have the
game well in hand.
Rightfielder Dave Alderete then walked and Neil Cummings, a
seasonal .240 hitter, belted one of Peterson's pitches for a homerun.
All American Gary Hernandex singled as did John Haro.
Thirdbaseman Don Thomas then drove in -Hernandez when his
infield grounder took a bad bounce and got away from shortstop Joe
Lamoure for an error.
Randy Hooper then provided the key blow of the inning when he
drove in both Haro and Thomas with the tying runs. He later scored
when catcher Brad Brian, batting for the second time in the inning,
singled. Peterson was finally relieved and Tom Changnon managed to
get the final out.
Peterson Bombed
According to catcher Bob Reece, Peterson never lost his control in
the inning and that he was pitching with the same speed as the first six
innings. Yet, Cal managed to get eight runs and six hits off him and
there was some question after the game as to why Coach Ray Young
had allowed his lefthander to stay in.
For much of the inning, there wasn't even anyone throwing in the
Stanford bullpen. After the game, Young said, "If he had been yild,
we would have had someone up. We were up by seven and we seemed
to have the game under control."
The loss seemed to take alot of spirit away from the Cards in the
nightcap. Young hinted at this when he remarked, "If we had won the
first game, we would have taken the nightcap."
Stanford, who has yet to take the second game of a doubleheader
against any of their divisional foes, managed to leave fifteen runners
on base in nine innings, while being frustrated time after time in their
numerous rallies.
Stanford opened the second game by loading the bases in the
bottom of the first, yet they were unable to score as Cal pitcher Ken
Nelson retired the next three batters on two line outs and a strike out.
Cards Load Bases
In the second, the Cards again loaded the bases, this time with one
out, and managed to score one run when Cal catcher Brad Brian
overthrew first base on a pickoff attempt.
In the third, Mark Lucich attempted to gain his third homerun of
the day, when he smashed a drive to deep left-center. Roy Meisner,
Cal's star hitter who had missed the first game due to an injury, raced
back and hit the fence in full stride as he caught the ball. The fence
collapsed and the actual location that Meisner caught the ball was two
feet beyond the barrier.
Cal scored two runs in the fifth inning when Brad Brian cleared the
left field fence with a homerun and Don Thomas scored later on a bad
hop single and a passed ball.
In the sixth, the Bears put the game away when three singles and
an error were coupled with a run-producing doubleplay to provide Cal
with a 4-2 lead. They were never headed.
The disaster of the Saturday doubleheader overshadowed the fine
performance of Bob DiPietro, who Young termed "our best pitcher
right now", in the first game of the series at Berkeley.
DiPietro Wins Seventh
DiPietro scattered five hits without allowing a run in recording his
seventh victory of the season with only two losses. The fireballing
lefthander struck out one man in each of the first six innings and
added two more in the seventh for a total of eight. He walked only
one man.
DiPietro was in trouble only in the third and fourth innings, and
then seemed to get stronger as the game wore on. He allowed only one
hit in the last four innings.
In the third Brad Brian doubled to leftfield for the first Cal hit, but
DiPietro was able to escape the inning on a sensational line drive out
handled by Dave Edson.
In the fourth, the Bears got runners to second and third with one
out on a double by Gary Hernandez, but were again stifled by an
incredible defensive play, as leftfielder Rod Boone slid across the foul
line to spear a sinking drive by Dave Alderete.
Despite the benching of Lucich and the absence of Tom Williams,
due to a leg injury, the Cardinal hitting came alive with its biggest
offensive output of the conference season.
Scoring a run in third inning, two in the fourt, four in the seventh
and two more in the ninth, Stanford cracked fourteen hits. Unlike the
UCLA series of last week, many of those hits came in clutch
situations.
Yet, while Friday's results were bright, the entire weekend may
have taken Stanford out of the divisional race. Coach Young
expressed the present situation in a post-game interview. "We play
well against USC, but we have a tendency to do poorly against
everyone else. We've just got to go after every game now to stay in."
