# U.S. Planes Resume Bombing North
## 
### DAVID SULITEANU 
Despite the most intense U.S.
bombings of the war, including the
resumption of raids over North Viet
nam, North Vietnamese forces cut
Highway 14 in the central highlands
before dawn this morning and overran
a government base camp at Tan Canh.
The U.S. 852s struck undisclosed
targets in the North this morning for
the first time since Friday, when they
attacked the Thanh Hoa military
complex. One plane was damaged by
anti-aircraft fire, but returned safely to
base, military sources reported.
Yesterday, in an attempt to stop the
surging North Vietnamese army, U.S.
planes launched more than 300 strikes
over the Central Highlands, including
about 50 by the giant 852s which
carry about 30 tons of explosives each.
Tan Canh, considered critical to the
defenses of Kontum and Pleiku, the
area's two largest cities, was the first
division headquarters reported lost in
the 26-day North Vietnamese offen
sive. The U.S. Air Force's biggest
aunship was unable to stop the column

of 20 tanks from entering the village.
Field reports said at least seven tanks
were destroyed.
Offensive Imminent
Meanwhile, thousands of South
Vietnamese soldiers were shifted into
the Saigon area to shore up govern
ment defenses against a Communist
offensive which U.S. officers have
been saying is imminent.
Much of the ARVN command's
strategic reserves have been employed
to combat the present offensive.
Military sources said yesterday that
the South Vietnamese have suffered at
least 10,000 military casualties, includ
ing 3,000 men killed since the
beginning of the March 30 offensive.
Communist command losses, accord
ing to estimates by senior allied
officials, are 13,000 killed and an
unknown number wounded and miss
ing.
On Sunday, President Nguyen Van
Thieu told the nation that the
Communist offensive so far had failec'
and would be defeated in the end

"They will be defeated again as they
were back in 1968 and in the past 17
years," said Thieu.
An Loc Shelled
As the President spoke, North
Vietnamese troops continued their
artillery barrage of An Loc, 60 miles
north of Saigon, and supported by
tanks, launched ground attacks from
four directions against the devistated
provincial capital. The town, which
has been besieged for over three
weeks, has been the target of over
3,000 rounds of rockets, mortars, and
artillery over the past three days.

North Vietnamese units captured
three more military bases on Saturday.
The three included two artillery bases,
Delta and Yankee, and the town of
Dau Tieng, 40 miles southwest of
Saigon.
Firebases Delta and Yankee art 1 two
of a half dozen artillery bases on
"Rocket Ridge" south of Dak To,
sitting along the northern approaches
to Kontum, believed to be a major
objective in the North Vietnamese
offensive. All have been surrounded by
elements of the North Vietnamese
320 th Division.

MASS ARREST—Riot-equipped police officers (risk several of the more than 200 demonstrators arrested Friday
afternoon for blockage of El Camino, before ordering them onto a bus fortransportationto jail.
Despite the most intense U.S.
bombings of the war, including the
resumption of raids over North Viet
nam, North Vietnamese forces cut
Highway 14 in the central highlands
before dawn this morning and overran
a government base camp at Tan Canh.
The U.S. 852s struck undisclosed
targets in the North this morning for
the first time since Friday, when they
attacked the Thanh Hoa military
complex. One plane was damaged by
anti-aircraft fire, but returned safely to
base, military sources reported.
Yesterday, in an attempt to stop the
surging North Vietnamese army, U.S.
planes launched more than 300 strikes
over the Central Highlands, including
about 50 by the giant 852s which
carry about 30 tons of explosives each.
Tan Canh, considered critical to the
defenses of Kontum and Pleiku, the
area's two largest cities, was the first
division headquarters reported lost in
the 26-day North Vietnamese offen
sive. The U.S. Air Force's biggest
aunship was unable to stop the column

of 20 tanks from entering the village.
Field reports said at least seven tanks
were destroyed.
Offensive Imminent
Meanwhile, thousands of South
Vietnamese soldiers were shifted into
the Saigon area to shore up govern
ment defenses against a Communist
offensive which U.S. officers have
been saying is imminent.
Much of the ARVN command's
strategic reserves have been employed
to combat the present offensive.
Military sources said yesterday that
the South Vietnamese have suffered at
least 10,000 military casualties, includ
ing 3,000 men killed since the
beginning of the March 30 offensive.
Communist command losses, accord
ing to estimates by senior allied
officials, are 13,000 killed and an
unknown number wounded and miss
ing.
On Sunday, President Nguyen Van
Thieu told the nation that the
Communist offensive so far had failec'
and would be defeated in the end

"They will be defeated again as they
were back in 1968 and in the past 17
years," said Thieu.
An Loc Shelled
As the President spoke, North
Vietnamese troops continued their
artillery barrage of An Loc, 60 miles
north of Saigon, and supported by
tanks, launched ground attacks from
four directions against the devistated
provincial capital. The town, which
has been besieged for over three
weeks, has been the target of over
3,000 rounds of rockets, mortars, and
artillery over the past three days.
