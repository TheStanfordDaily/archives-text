# Tanner Wins Twice
## Letters Crush L.A. Foes 
### DAVID ANTONUCCIO 
The weather was almost as hot
as the Stanford tennis team this
weekend as the Card racketman
demolished their L.A. opponents,
USC and UCLA, before a capacity
home crowd.
Stanford more than avenged its
54 loss to USC of two weeks ago,
by blanking Southern California
on Friday, 9-0, the Trojan's first
tennis shutout in over a dozen
years. Led by stroke-master
Roscoe Tanner, the Indians nearly
gave a repeat performance the
following day as they clobbered a
very strong UCLA squad, 8-1.
Coach Dick Gould was as
excited as anyone about the wins.
"When you win seventeen out of
eighteen matches against two of
the top teams in the country, it
has to be the greatest single
weekend in Stanford tennis
history. There was great weather,
great crowds, and great tennis. We
have to be respected as the team
that will give Trinity the toughest
time in the NCAA
Championship."
With their weekend victories,
the Stanford netmen once again
asserted themselves as a potential
national champion, but right now
are looking ahead hungrily to the
Pacific-8 Championships at
Berkeley on May 18-20. As a
results of the sweep, UCLA and
USC will meet in the semi-finals,
while Stanford will face a lesser
foe.
Hie Trojans had to do without
the services of their number one
man, Marcelo Lara, who is nursing
a bad wrist, but obviously his
presence could not have reversed
the defeat.
Raul Ramirez stepped into
Lara's place to face Roscoe
Tanner as the whole SC ladder
moved up a notch. Tanner had a
faulty start dropping the first set
to the Mexican Davis Cupper 5-7,
but took out his frustration on
Ramirez to easily win the next
two sets 6-1, 6-4.
Sandy Mayer performed
brilliantly as he stifled Dick
Bohmstedt, 6-1, 7-6. Sandy fell
behind in his second set 3-5 but

was tough in the clutch and went
on to win the tie-breaker 5-3.
Freshman Chico Hagey had
little trouble defeating Mike
Machette while another freshman
Jim Delaney had his hands full
with SC's John Andrews. Andrews
went through three rackets but
that wasn't enough as Delaney put
him away in the final set 6-3,
dishing up both unbelievable and
unreturnable shots.
Rick Fisher played well
en route to his victory over Sashi
Menon of India and Gery
Groslimond crushed his opponent.
Delaney expressed the
sentiments of his teammates on
defeating the number two ranked
team in the nation, "We didn't let
down even though Marcelo Lara
wasn't there. Teams have a
tendency to let down at times like
this. Of course, we would have
rather played them at full
strength, but we played well and
deserved the win."
The lively atmosphere at the
SC match prevailed on Saturday
when Stanford tangled with
UCLA, as the Incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band offered pregame
entertainment to the overflowing
throng of tennis fans. If one
looked close enough he would
have noticed that the long haired
clarinet player was definitely
female.
Coach Gould used the same
singles lineup for the Bruins
contest as he had for USC.
Everyone repeated their victories
except for Chicao Hagey who was
handcuffed by Mike Kreiss.
Tanner displayed superior form in
downing Jeff Austin as Mayer
crushed 1971 Wimbledon Junior
Champion, Bob Kreiss.
Jim Delaney again showed
himself worthy of the number
four spot on the Stanford ladder
by dumping senior Ron Cornell,
6-0, 6-4. Rick Fisher defeated
Spencer Segura in three sets while
Gery Groslimond downed Tom
Kreiss, who at 16 years of age has
to be the youngest college player
in the country.
The Stanford doubles teams

dominated play against the
Uclan's highly touted doubles.
Roseoe Tanner and Sandy Mayer
trounced Bob and Mike Kreiss.
The other victorious doubles
combinations were Rick Fisher
and Groslimond along with Paul
Sidone and Chip Fisher.
"The guys played really well
and I was especially impressed
with our second doubles", added
Gould. "Rick Fisher and Gery
Groslimond had two fine wins this
weekend and the development of
our second doubles will be a key
to the national championship."
The next dates on the Stanford
calendar are April 27-30 when the
Ojai Intercollegiate Tournament is
held, in Ojai, Calif. Stanford
tennis players will be competing
in the Pac-8 division for the
Thatcher Cup, a prize that has
eluded previous Stanford net
squads. The following week the
California State Championships
take place.

Coach Gould used the same
singles lineup for the Bruins
contest as he had for USC.
Everyone repeated their victories
except for Chicao Hagey who was
handcuffed by Mike Kreiss.
Tanner displayed superior form in
downing Jeff Austin as Mayer
crushed 1971 Wimbledon Junior
Champion, Bob Kreiss.
Jim Delaney again showed
himself worthy of the number
four spot on the Stanford ladder
by dumping senior Ron Cornell,
6-0, 6-4. Rick Fisher defeated
Spencer Segura in three sets while
Gery Groslimond downed Tom
Kreiss, who at 16 years of age has
to be the youngest college player
in the country.
The Stanford doubles teams

dominated play against the
Uclan's highly touted doubles.
Roseoe Tanner and Sandy Mayer
trounced Bob and Mike Kreiss.
The other victorious doubles
combinations were Rick Fisher
and Groslimond along with Paul
Sidone and Chip Fisher.
"The guys played really well
and I was especially impressed
with our second doubles", added
Gould. "Rick Fisher and Gery
Groslimond had two fine wins this
weekend and the development of
our second doubles will be a key
to the national championship."
The next dates on the Stanford
calendar are April 27-30 when the
Ojai Intercollegiate Tournament is
held, in Ojai, Calif. Stanford
tennis players will be competing
in the Pac-8 division for the
Thatcher Cup, a prize that has
eluded previous Stanford net
squads. The following week the
California State Championships
take place.
The weather was almost as hot
as the Stanford tennis team this
weekend as the Card racketman
demolished their L.A. opponents,
USC and UCLA, before a capacity
home crowd.
Stanford more than avenged its
54 loss to USC of two weeks ago,
by blanking Southern California
on Friday, 9-0, the Trojan's first
tennis shutout in over a dozen
years. Led by stroke-master
Roscoe Tanner, the Indians nearly
gave a repeat performance the
following day as they clobbered a
very strong UCLA squad, 8-1.
Coach Dick Gould was as
excited as anyone about the wins.
"When you win seventeen out of
eighteen matches against two of
the top teams in the country, it
has to be the greatest single
weekend in Stanford tennis
history. There was great weather,
great crowds, and great tennis. We
have to be respected as the team
that will give Trinity the toughest
time in the NCAA
Championship."
With their weekend victories,
the Stanford netmen once again
asserted themselves as a potential
national champion, but right now
are looking ahead hungrily to the
Pacific-8 Championships at
Berkeley on May 18-20. As a
results of the sweep, UCLA and
USC will meet in the semi-finals,
while Stanford will face a lesser
foe.
Hie Trojans had to do without
the services of their number one
man, Marcelo Lara, who is nursing
a bad wrist, but obviously his
presence could not have reversed
the defeat.
Raul Ramirez stepped into
Lara's place to face Roscoe
Tanner as the whole SC ladder
moved up a notch. Tanner had a
faulty start dropping the first set
to the Mexican Davis Cupper 5-7,
but took out his frustration on
Ramirez to easily win the next
two sets 6-1, 6-4.
Sandy Mayer performed
brilliantly as he stifled Dick
Bohmstedt, 6-1, 7-6. Sandy fell
behind in his second set 3-5 but

was tough in the clutch and went
on to win the tie-breaker 5-3.
Freshman Chico Hagey had
little trouble defeating Mike
Machette while another freshman
Jim Delaney had his hands full
with SC's John Andrews. Andrews
went through three rackets but
that wasn't enough as Delaney put
him away in the final set 6-3,
dishing up both unbelievable and
unreturnable shots.
Rick Fisher played well
en route to his victory over Sashi
Menon of India and Gery
Groslimond crushed his opponent.
Delaney expressed the
sentiments of his teammates on
defeating the number two ranked
team in the nation, "We didn't let
down even though Marcelo Lara
wasn't there. Teams have a
tendency to let down at times like
this. Of course, we would have
rather played them at full
strength, but we played well and
deserved the win."
The lively atmosphere at the
SC match prevailed on Saturday
when Stanford tangled with
UCLA, as the Incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band offered pregame
entertainment to the overflowing
throng of tennis fans. If one
looked close enough he would
have noticed that the long haired
clarinet player was definitely
female.
