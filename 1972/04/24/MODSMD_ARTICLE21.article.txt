# Sailing Wins Regatta
## 
### 
The Stanford Sailing Team
captured three firsts and the
Northern California
Intercollegiate Yacht Racing
Association crown last Saturday
at Vallejo.
Coming into the last regatta of
the season l A point out of first
place, the yachters squelched their
competition b> winning three out
of four races and thereby bringing
another division title to Stanford.
After a disappointing first race
of the afternoon, Susie Salsbury
skippered her FJ class sloop to a
first place finish over Alameda,
S.F. State, U.C. Santa Cruz,
California Maritime Academy,

U.C. Davis and Humbolt College.
As the winds faded, Stanford
turned to their light wind
specialist Brooks Martin to pull
off the desperately needed final
two victories of the afternoon.
Martin managed to force his
craft forward while other skippers
floundered in the zephyrs and
could only watch helplessly as
Stanford sailed awav with the
N.C.I.Y.R.A. trophy. '
With this title behind them, the
sailors are now looking forward to
this weekend when they get the
chance to capture the Shields class
division title for both Northern
and Southern California.
