Astronauts Blast Off For Earth
SPACE CENTER, Houston — Apollo 16 explorers
rocketed away from the moon yesterday with rocks
geologists believe were formed by early lunar volcanoes,
thus achieving their primary goal. The men then linked
with the command ship and began preparing for the long
trip home.
With astronauts John W. Young and Charles M. Duke
Jr. at her controls, Orion, the lunar module, blasted
upward into the black lunar sky at 5:26 p.m. PST, and
sped into moon orbit. They rejoined their crewmate,
Thomas K. Mattingly 11, who had been orbiting alone
since Thursday.
The astronauts gathered 245 pounds of rock and soil,
including one small boulder weighing 40 pounds.
Scientists at the Manned Spacecraft Center believe the
samples include rocks of volcanic origin, formed at or near
the time of the original lunar crust.
A failure in the command ship's back up control rocket
engine control system forced officials to cut one day out
of the mission.
Davis Prosecution To Commence
SAN JOSE — The Angela Davis trial takes a new turn
today as the prosecution attempts to link Davis to
the bloody shootout at the Marin County civic center.
For the past four weeks, 40 prosecution witnesses have
recreated the abortive escape attempt which claimed the
lives of four persons on Aug. 7, 1970. Now, as the state
enters the second phase of its case, prosecutor Albert
Harris Jr. will attempt to prove that Miss Davis helped
plan the escape and furnished the guns used for the job.
Harris contends that although Miss Davis was not at the
scene of the shootout the day Judge Harold Haley and
three kidnapers were slain, she triggered the violence by
conspiring with one kidnaper — 17-year old Jonathan
.Jackson — and supplying him guns. The motive, Harris
alleges, was Davis' love for Jonathan's brother,
George Jackson, a San Quentin convict later killed in an
alleged escape attempt. Harris claims the hostages taken at
the courthouse were to be exchanged for Jackson, one of
three unrelated black convicts known as the "Soledad
Brothers."
French Voters Accept Britain
PARIS - French voters gave Britain a lukewarm welcome
into the European Common Market yesterday and dealt
President Georges Pompidou a stinging rebuke by refusing
his request for a massive vote.
Final official returns showed 67.86 percent in favor of
Britain's entry and 32.14 percent against. But more than
46 percent of the registered voters stayed home or cast
blank blalots, a record high for national elections since
World War 11. The yes vote amounted to only about 36.5
percent of France's more than 29 million registered
voters.
The result of the referendum was to ratify the treaties
bringing Britain, Norway, Denmark and Ireland into the
European Economic Community—EEC—alongside France,
West Germany, Italy, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg.

When the four countries become members Jan. 1, 1973,
the Common Market will include a population of 256.6
million persons in 10 nations and be the second largest
economic power in the world after the United States.
Two Key Primaries Held Tomorrow
Sens. Hubert H. Humphrey and George S. McGovem hope
to deal Sen. Edmund S. Muskie's faltering presidential
campaign a one-two knockout blow tomorrow in
Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, two states where the
Maine senator once hoped to flatten his two major
opponents.
In Pennsylvania, even Muskie supporters believe
Humphrey will run first in the nonbinding presidential
preference race. They insist, however, that the support of
Gov. Milton J. Shapp and Philadelphia Democratic
Chairman Peter J. Camiel will enable Muskie to win a
majority of the 137 delegates to be elected.
Humphrey, who has never won a primary in three bids
for the presidency, needs a Pennsylvania victory badly
after a third place finish in Wisconsin.
Politicians feel the results Tuesday, especially in the
large industrial state of Pennsylvania, will strongly
influence future Democratic primaries, including those
May 2 in Ohio and Indiana, May 16 in Michigan, June 6 in
California and June 20 in New York.
In Massachusetts, McGovern supporters talk of
sweeping most of the 102 delegates. They are
concentrating their efforts in Boston and working class
areas, rather than his campus and suburban strongholds, in
hopes of using the primary to show his broad electoral
appeal.
President Nixon is expected to be an easy winner
tomorrow in Massachusetts. There is no GOP presidential
primary in Pennsylvania this year.
Ireland Fighting Recommences
&ELFAST — Fighting broke out between Protestants and
Roman Catholics in Londonderry yesterday and bomb
blasts caused widespread damage in other areas of
Northern Ireland. No casualties were reported from the
two explosions, but 20 buildings in Dungannon in County
Tyrone were hit.
Meanwhile a political row broke out in Britain over a
demand by Enoch Powell, outspoken maverick
Conservative legislator, that the Heath government send
troops in to occupy various Catholic districts.
Donors Must Reveal Identities
LOS ANGELES — Large donors to campaigns for or
against state ballot propositions will face criminal
penalties if they hide their identities, Secretary of State
Edmund G. Brown Jr. warned yesterday.
"Two years ago three large oil companies gave a total of
$95,000 in secret contributions to the campaign against
Proposition 18," Brown stated in a news release. "This
kind of action will no longer be permitted."
Brown said any individual or agency donating more
than $1,000 must file a financial report with his office.
Anyone receiving such a donation also must file a report,
he added.
