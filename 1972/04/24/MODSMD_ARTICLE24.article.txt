W. GLENN CAMPBELL CALL YOUR OFFICE —Over 1200 people gathered in White Plaza Friday noon after a
morning of blocking doorways and other strike activity. Much of this group later marched around campus, and finally to
El Camino Real. •
An estimated 25,000 persons at
tended a three-hour rally in San
Francisco's Kezar Stadium Saturday to
protest the United States' military
policy in Indochina.
Immediately before the rally, an
estimated 8000 persons marched from
the Golden Gate Panhandle to the
stadium in the southeast corner of
Gold Gate Park led by two Vietnam
Veterans in wheelchairs.

Dick Gregory, comedian and former
Peace and Freedom Party presidential
candidate, told the crowd he has not
eaten any solid food since April 24,
1971 and will not eat "until the war
ends." As a renewed protest, Gregory
announced his plans to subsist on
water alone for 40 days.
Stating that certain industries
should be boycotted, Gregory said,
"You can talk about imperialists and
hold rallies, but unless you take
economic action, you won't be able to
do a damn thing for 90 years."
Bobby Seale
Black Panther Party chairman Bob
by Seale declared that President Nixon
must accept North Vietnam's seven
point peace program to end the war.
A telephone message recorded in
Paris by Madame Nguyen Thi Binh,
the chief Viet Cong negotiator, was
broadcast over the stadium sound
system in Vietnamese. In her trans
lated words, Binh declared that
"Nixon has refused to enter into
serious negotiations for peace."
Other speakers at the rally included
actress Jane Fonda, singer Country Joe
McDonald, and San Francisco Sheriff
Richard Hongisto. In addition, there
was a tape from Angela Davis con

demning the increased bombing.
12,000 At Los Angeles Rally
An estimated 12,000 people attend
ed a similar rally at Mac Arthur Park in
Los Angeles after about 10,000 people
marched two miles down Wilshire
Boulevard. The march was to have
been led by the Rev. Ralph David
Abernathy, head of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, but
he was not on hand.
In New York City, approximately
30,000 people, the largest group of
antiwar demonstrators in more than
two years, marched in cold, rainy
weather down Fifth Avenue carrying
banners and chanting slogans for a
rally at Bryant Park beside the New
York Public Library.
Meanwhile overseas, a group of
about 10,000 protesters carried Viet
Cong flags through downtown West
Berlin and halted at the Kaiser
Wilhelm Memorial church where
youths climbed the ruins of the
bomb-blackened main tower, which
was left standing as a memorial against
war.
In Tel Aviv, about 100 Israeli
Communists, mostly middle-aged,
chanted "Yankee, go home" outside
the U.S. Embassy.
