# Lyman Condemns Demo; Protesters Plan Strike
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
President Richard Lyman yesterday
condemned protesters' attempts to
block El Camino Real Friday as not
having any "constructive influence on
the course of American politics." The
attempted obstruction resulted in the
arrests of 205, including 116 Stanford
students.
Lyman added that "a good many
people seem still unaware of the fact
that Stanford does not control the
police. If they have cause to anticipate
that the law will be broken, they can
come on campus without invitation.
Once they are here, we cannot direct
their tactics."
Lyman questioned whether "there
are some for whom police confronta
tions, not effective work for peace, are
the real objectives." He said that
working for candidates in the June 6
California primary was "the one
overwhelmingly obvious and construc
tive response to what is happening in
the world."
Meanwhile at a 4 p.m. rally in White
Plaza yesterday, 350 people planned
further strike activities for today.
Demonstrators plan to meet back at
White Plaza at 6:30 a.m. and march to
close down the Physical Plant. Protes
ters will also gather at Lyman's office
at 9 a.m. to "place him under house

arrest." A noon rally is scheduled for
White Plaza.
Saturday Meeting
On Saturday, key administrators
met for three hours with faculty dorm
residents to clarify University policy
on demonstrators. Special Assistant to
the President John Schwartz, Legal
Adviser to the President James Siena,
and Assistant to the President Bill
Stone represented the administration
at the meeting. Acting Dean of
Students Bob Freelan, Associate Dean
Dan Williams and Assistant Dean Larry
Horton also attended the meeting.
According to Associate Industrial
Engineering Professor Dave Thomp
son, the Faculty Coordinating Fellow
at Florence Moore, the administrators
told those at the meeting that "police
would have as much access to dorm
hallways as private citizens would."
A number of the administrators and
faculty residents agreed with Siena,
Thompson said, when Siena stated
that it is "difficult to establish that the
University is private property." Re
portedly, the dorm residents question
ed how people could be arrested for
trespassing, as they were Friday
morning at Encina, if the University is
not private property.
Portion Of Code
However, inspection of the charges
against the 12 arrested at Encina
shows that they were charged with the
portion of the trespassing section of
the Penal Code which prohibits "inter
fering with obstructing, or injuring any
lawful business or occupation."
Thompson also said that the ad
ministrators were "getting flak for
their complicity in bringing the police
on" the campus. Thompson said that
Freelan and Horton "were as critical
of the Administration as the rest of us
were."
Freelen told the Daily last night
that "I was concerned with the fact
that 200 people were arrested as a
result of the fact that police were on
campus."
Williams said that Schwartz had
called him Friday afternoon to arrange
the meeting because of student in
quiries on the relationship between the

University and the police. He said that
a number of faculty residents had
expressed their dismay regarding the
University's lack of control over the
police once they were on campus.
Trespassing Arrests
On Friday, 12 persons were arrested
for trespassing as they attempted to
block the doors of Encina Hall early in
the morning. Several of the 12 were
also charged with resisting arrest and
assault and battery on police officers.
Approximately 350 demonstrators had
participated in blocking the doors.

After the arrests at Encina, a crowd
of 300 marched to the Hansen
Microwave Laboratory and gained
access to the rear of the building.
When the police arrived, most of the
group gathered at the back door. The
police charged without warning and
without apparent provocation and
three persons, including ASSU Guest
Professor Dave .Josephson, were arrest
ed for incitement to riot.
After a noon rally at White Plaza
attended by 1,200, the crowd returned
to Hansen and then to Encina. After
the demonstrators had broken into
Encina, police charged and cleared the
building. Two persons were arrested
there.
Once they had been routed from
Encina, 900 moved to the Graduate
School of Business where they voted
to "take El Camino Real." The 900
were met at the corner of El Camino
and Embarcadero by 90 riot-equipped
police from two counties and at least
three communities. The police charg
ed, divided the crowd into two groups
and surrounded and arrested the 200
who were nearest to the Town and
Country shopping center. A large
portion of the other group was chased
through the eucalyptus grove west of
El Camino. Officers gave chase both
on foot and in at least one car.

At Hansen Microwave Laboratory: Dave
Josephson, ASSU Guest Professor of Social
Thought; Virginia Faller, a junior in political

Each was charged with trespassing and
inciting to riot.
President Richard Lyman yesterday
condemned protesters' attempts to
block El Camino Real Friday as not
having any "constructive influence on
the course of American politics." The
attempted obstruction resulted in the
arrests of 205, including 116 Stanford
students.
Lyman added that "a good many
people seem still unaware of the fact
that Stanford does not control the
police. If they have cause to anticipate
that the law will be broken, they can
come on campus without invitation.
Once they are here, we cannot direct
their tactics."
Lyman questioned whether "there
are some for whom police confronta
tions, not effective work for peace, are
the real objectives." He said that
working for candidates in the June 6
California primary was "the one
overwhelmingly obvious and construc
tive response to what is happening in
the world."
Meanwhile at a 4 p.m. rally in White
Plaza yesterday, 350 people planned
further strike activities for today.
Demonstrators plan to meet back at
White Plaza at 6:30 a.m. and march to
close down the Physical Plant. Protes
ters will also gather at Lyman's office
at 9 a.m. to "place him under house

arrest." A noon rally is scheduled for
White Plaza.
Saturday Meeting
On Saturday, key administrators
met for three hours with faculty dorm
residents to clarify University policy
on demonstrators. Special Assistant to
the President John Schwartz, Legal
Adviser to the President James Siena,
and Assistant to the President Bill
Stone represented the administration
at the meeting. Acting Dean of
Students Bob Freelan, Associate Dean
Dan Williams and Assistant Dean Larry
Horton also attended the meeting.
According to Associate Industrial
Engineering Professor Dave Thomp
son, the Faculty Coordinating Fellow
at Florence Moore, the administrators
told those at the meeting that "police
would have as much access to dorm
hallways as private citizens would."
A number of the administrators and
faculty residents agreed with Siena,
Thompson said, when Siena stated
that it is "difficult to establish that the
University is private property." Re
portedly, the dorm residents question
ed how people could be arrested for
trespassing, as they were Friday
morning at Encina, if the University is
not private property.
Portion Of Code
However, inspection of the charges
against the 12 arrested at Encina
shows that they were charged with the
portion of the trespassing section of
the Penal Code which prohibits "inter
fering with obstructing, or injuring any
lawful business or occupation."
Thompson also said that the ad
ministrators were "getting flak for
their complicity in bringing the police
on" the campus. Thompson said that
Freelan and Horton "were as critical
of the Administration as the rest of us
were."
Freelen told the Daily last night
that "I was concerned with the fact
that 200 people were arrested as a
result of the fact that police were on
campus."
Williams said that Schwartz had
called him Friday afternoon to arrange
the meeting because of student in
quiries on the relationship between the

University and the police. He said that
a number of faculty residents had
expressed their dismay regarding the
University's lack of control over the
police once they were on campus.
Trespassing Arrests
On Friday, 12 persons were arrested
for trespassing as they attempted to
block the doors of Encina Hall early in
the morning. Several of the 12 were
also charged with resisting arrest and
assault and battery on police officers.
Approximately 350 demonstrators had
participated in blocking the doors.

After the arrests at Encina, a crowd
of 300 marched to the Hansen
Microwave Laboratory and gained
access to the rear of the building.
When the police arrived, most of the
group gathered at the back door. The
police charged without warning and
without apparent provocation and
three persons, including ASSU Guest
Professor Dave .Josephson, were arrest
ed for incitement to riot.
After a noon rally at White Plaza
attended by 1,200, the crowd returned
to Hansen and then to Encina. After
the demonstrators had broken into
Encina, police charged and cleared the
building. Two persons were arrested
there.
Once they had been routed from
Encina, 900 moved to the Graduate
School of Business where they voted
to "take El Camino Real." The 900
were met at the corner of El Camino
and Embarcadero by 90 riot-equipped
police from two counties and at least
three communities. The police charg
ed, divided the crowd into two groups
and surrounded and arrested the 200
who were nearest to the Town and
Country shopping center. A large
portion of the other group was chased
through the eucalyptus grove west of
El Camino. Officers gave chase both
on foot and in at least one car.

the morning. Several of the 12 were
also charged with resisting arrest and
assault and battery on police officers.
Approximately 350 demonstrators had
participated in blocking the doors.

After the arrests at Encina, a crowd
of 300 marched to the Hansen
Microwave Laboratory and gained
access to the rear of the building.
When the police arrived, most of the
group gathered at the back door. The
police charged without warning and
without apparent provocation and
three persons, including ASSU Guest
Professor Dave .Josephson, were arrest
ed for incitement to riot.
After a noon rally at White Plaza
attended by 1,200, the crowd returned
to Hansen and then to Encina. After
the demonstrators had broken into
Encina, police charged and cleared the
building. Two persons were arrested
there.
Once they had been routed from
Encina, 900 moved to the Graduate
School of Business where they voted
to "take El Camino Real." The 900
were met at the corner of El Camino
and Embarcadero by 90 riot-equipped
police from two counties and at least
three communities. The police charg
ed, divided the crowd into two groups
and surrounded and arrested the 200
who were nearest to the Town and
Country shopping center. A large
portion of the other group was chased
through the eucalyptus grove west of
El Camino. Officers gave chase both
on foot and in at least one car.

At Hansen Microwave Laboratory: Dave

Thought; Virginia Faller, a junior in political

Each was charged with trespassing and
inciting to riot.
President Richard Lyman yesterday
condemned protesters' attempts to
block El Camino Real Friday as not
having any "constructive influence on
the course of American politics." The
attempted obstruction resulted in the
arrests of 205, including 116 Stanford
students.
Lyman added that "a good many
people seem still unaware of the fact
that Stanford does not control the
police. If they have cause to anticipate
that the law will be broken, they can
come on campus without invitation.
Once they are here, we cannot direct
their tactics."
Lyman questioned whether "there
are some for whom police confronta
tions, not effective work for peace, are
the real objectives." He said that
working for candidates in the June 6
California primary was "the one
overwhelmingly obvious and construc
tive response to what is happening in
the world."
Meanwhile at a 4 p.m. rally in White
Plaza yesterday, 350 people planned
further strike activities for today.
Demonstrators plan to meet back at
White Plaza at 6:30 a.m. and march to
close down the Physical Plant. Protes
ters will also gather at Lyman's office
at 9 a.m. to "place him under house

arrest." A noon rally is scheduled for
White Plaza.
Saturday Meeting
On Saturday, key administrators
met for three hours with faculty dorm
residents to clarify University policy
on demonstrators. Special Assistant to
the President John Schwartz, Legal
Adviser to the President James Siena,
and Assistant to the President Bill
Stone represented the administration
at the meeting. Acting Dean of
Students Bob Freelan, Associate Dean
Dan Williams and Assistant Dean Larry
Horton also attended the meeting.
According to Associate Industrial
Engineering Professor Dave Thomp
son, the Faculty Coordinating Fellow
at Florence Moore, the administrators
told those at the meeting that "police
would have as much access to dorm
hallways as private citizens would."
A number of the administrators and
faculty residents agreed with Siena,
Thompson said, when Siena stated
that it is "difficult to establish that the
University is private property." Re
portedly, the dorm residents question
ed how people could be arrested for
trespassing, as they were Friday
morning at Encina, if the University is
not private property.
Portion Of Code
However, inspection of the charges
against the 12 arrested at Encina
shows that they were charged with the
portion of the trespassing section of
the Penal Code which prohibits "inter
fering with obstructing, or injuring any
lawful business or occupation."
Thompson also said that the ad
ministrators were "getting flak for
their complicity in bringing the police
on" the campus. Thompson said that
Freelan and Horton "were as critical
of the Administration as the rest of us
were."
Freelen told the Daily last night
that "I was concerned with the fact
that 200 people were arrested as a
result of the fact that police were on
campus."
Williams said that Schwartz had
called him Friday afternoon to arrange
the meeting because of student in
quiries on the relationship between the

University and the police. He said that
a number of faculty residents had
expressed their dismay regarding the
University's lack of control over the
police once they were on campus.
