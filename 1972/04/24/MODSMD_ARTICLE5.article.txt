# SPECIAL ISSUE
## 
### 
The Daily published a special
four-page issue Saturday on Fri
day's mass arrest, the effects of
the strike, and the blocking by
demonstrators of some offices and
classes.
For details and pictures of
those events please see that issue.
Some copies of that paper were
distributed Saturday, the rest are
being distributed in the normal
places today. If any reader has
trouble getting a copy of the
special edition, extra copies are
available as long as they last at the
Daily office.
