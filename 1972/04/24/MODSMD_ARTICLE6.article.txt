## Violent Spectacle 
### 
The Stanford administration, the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Office, the Palo Alto Police De
partment, and student strikers combined Thursday
and Friday to create a series of brutal, violent spec
tacles.
The day's events degenerated into a power strug
gle in which the forces of institutionalized violence
residing in the University administration and "law
enforcement" agencies easily prevailed.
By Sunday night, about 225 people had been ar
rested, an unknown number of others terrorized by
undisciplined hordes of policemen and Sheriff's dep
uties, and more than 15 demonstrators and deputies
injured seriously enough to require medical treat
ment-and apparently the violence has not yet end
ed, as deputies in riot gear continue to patrol the
campus in four-man cars.
Most obvious were atrocities perpetrated by a few
frightened, barbaric deputies and policemen, who
choked arrestees into unconsciousness, beat and
kicked people who were already prostrate on the
ground, refused to provide medical aid to people
knocked senseless or into convulsions by police
clubs, attacked medical aid people attending those
already injured by police charges, and changed Stan
ford into something resembling a war zone, where
tactical squad deputies appear from unmarked cars,
bushes, and "bicycle safety" vans.
Police and deputies charged without warning,
with clubs swinging, when dispersing the crowd on
El Camino and arresting 207 people.
The Palo Alto Police Department has allowed
demonstrators to "take" El Camino several times
before, most recently at Rickey's Hyatt House and
the California Republican Assembly convention at
the Cabana Hotel earlier this month. The police
themselves blocked the highway for three hours,
which they apparently believed was less "intolera
ble" than allowing protesters to march or to sym
bolically "take" the highway for an hour.
However, police and deputies acted in response to
some provocation on Thursday night and Friday af
ternoon. On El Camino, after police charged, dem

onstrators barraged law enforcement officers with
rocks in a frustrated, depersonalized, and potential
ly lethal display of senseless violence. Although
some may doubt that "peace" officers are people
after their behavior last week, they are human. Un
der no circumstances should people attempt to in
flict massive, senseless injury on other people. Just
as we abhor beatings administered by policemen and
deputies, we condemn rock-throwing at people by
demonstrators.
In addition, a few demonstrators threw rocks at
occupied buildings Friday. While this destruction
was fortunately minor and condemned by most
demonstrators, it should not be repeated at all â€”
people inside the buildings could easily have been
cut by flying glass or seriously hurt by the rocks.
Finally, although he pretends to have no control
over deputies, President Lyman and the administra
tion do in both law and practice exercise a consider
able amount of control over the Sheriff's Office.
Most criminal violations cannot be prosecuted with
out a complainant, and the University as complain
ant could control deputies. In fact, the Sheriff's Of
fice consults Department of Public Safety Director
Marvin Herrington before it takes action against
people blocking doorways or entering buildings. In
almost all of Friday's on-campus actions, Stanford
could have controlled deputies to some extent with
out interfering with tactical decisions or obstructing
a peace officer. Instead, Lyman chose to give the
Sheriff's Office a blank check -a license for violence
which it still holds.
The University, even with its desire to remain
open, could have allowed a one-day shutdown of
selected activities, rather than establishing a police
state on campus, radicalizing students, and counter
ing peaceful (albeit coercive) strikers with violent
(and even more coercive) deputies. And the Palo
Alto police, even with the callous disregard of duty
demonstrated by their chief, could have cleared El
Camino with a warning to the demonstrators, with
out mass arrests, and without injuries.
