A Letter to Those who Throw
Rocks, In Thought or In Deed:
In the 1960's rock-throwers
were common on the college
campus. They hurled their
limestone projectiles with the
fierce dedication that can come
only from absolute certainty that
one is correct. These were the
"infallible ones". They threw
their stones in the name of racism,
in the name of police brutality,

and in the name of Vietnam.
Either because of, or in spite of
these infallible ones (I tend to
believe "because of") our country
has vastly changed its attitude
toward minority groups, toward
citizens' rights, and toward that
proverbial thorn in the side,
Vietnam. Admittedly, those who
have tried to cast down the
establishment by and large have
failed to achieve this goal, but
their past efforts have not been
completely in vain.
In my opinion, the American
public is now in a frame of mind
which will make it possible for a
liberal, hard-core-anti-war
candidate to be elected President.
In addition I doubt that
rock-throwing demonstrations
can, at this time, do very much to
awaken the American public to
the horrors of Vietnam, simply
because the people of this country
are just about as "awake" as they

are going to get!
I believe that further violence
on the campus can do very little
other than to excite cries for law
and order from the greater
portion of the American public.
To throw public sentiment into a
demand for law and order would
be to partially obscure Vietnam,
and, worse, would be to improve
the chances of President Nixon's
reelection.
I am fully aware that you will
scoff at me when I suggest that
you support McGovern and
McCloskey. You will call these
men pseudo-liberals or you will
object that they are not
revolutionaries. But, let me ask
you this: Do you truly believe
that you have any hope of
electing candidates whose views
come any closer to your ideas
than those of McGovern and
McCloskey?
Your predecessors in the

]960's worked hard to change
American opinions so that there
might eventually be candidates
like McGovern and McCloskey
who actually have a good chance
of being elected. Please don't
throw their work away!
By attacking the labs here at
Stanford, you aren't attacking evil
at its source. There is no evil in
inventing devices which improve
communications, devices which
improve data processing, and
devices which improve data
collection. The evil exists in those
who use these devices to murder. I
believe we should work, not
against scientists, but against
those politicians who would kill
without batting an eyelash.
Accomplished Nothing
For the past week, those of
you who have thrown rocks on
the Stanford campus have
accomplished nothing. You
encouraged a strike, but you used
the day of the strike for no good
purpose. You have wasted very
valuable time.
Therefore, I encourage you to
put down your rocks, to put on a
tie, and to volunteer your mind
and body as active participants in
the campaigns for McGovem and
McCloskey. If you work for them
with the same dedication you
have shown in your marches
around the Stanford campus, 1
have no doubt that you will be
rewarded in November.
