## Imperialism Begins Here 
###

During the Cambodia strike I
spoke with several people who
explained to me that we were
fighting in Vietnam in order to
bring democracy to the
Vietnamese people who were too
stupid to govern themselves.
The U.S. government has tried
to convince us all that the
Vietnamese are less human and
less civilized that we are, in spite
of massive and obvious evidence
to the contrary.
Tony Russo reports that when
he worked for the Rand
Corporation, an interviewing team
in Vietnam published a report
"characterizing the Vietcong as
idealistic people whose cadre
often had a monkish quality of
devotion." When a U.S. Defense
Department official was briefed
on the report, he said, "If what
you say is true, we are fighting on
the wrong side."
Rejected
Of course the Pentagon
ridiculed and rejected this study.
Russo says that Rand was
supposed to have made the study
public, but never did because
"1) The interviews contain
embarrassing stories of atrocities
and crimes against humanity; and
2) They reveal the identity and
therefore the humanity of the
Vietnamese."
The bombings of Vietnam
show that American imperialists
are so desperate to control
Southeast Asia, that they do

everything to blind themselves
and us to the humanity of the
Vietnamese. This blindness
prevents the U.S. from
understanding their brilliant
political and military strategy. All
this country can do is commit
more and more atrocious crimes
against the land and people of
Asia.
Imperialism begins at home,
because in order to expand its
power to other countries, the
mother country has to accumulate
enough wealth within its borders.
The U.S. could not have
accumulated this wealth without
the institution of Black slavery,
and later the cheap labor of Black
people.
Subhuman
In order to justify the barbaric
treatment of Black people,
Americans convinced themselves
that Blacks were subhuman.
Because of such people as
Malcolm X. George Jackson,
Angela Davis, Kathleen Cleaver,
and the hundreds of Black
prisoners and freedom fighters
who act and write, fewer and
fewer people believe the racist
ideology.
The problem for men like the
Stanford trustees and William
Shockley is not so much that
Black people have proven
themselves thoroughly intelligent
and human, but that they have
proven it according to their own
standards rather than according to

white-male standards.
Intensify
So now the guardians of
white-male society have to
intensify their racism and at the
same time prove the worth of
their badly battered standards.
Simple, old-fashioned racism is
being replaced by "scientific"
racism.
To the random brutalization
and murder that Third World
people have always faced in this
country, Shockley is adding
systematic genocide by sterilizing
Black women.
This is the beginning stage of
the systematic genocide now
reaching unimaginable horror in
Vietnam. Just as the U.S. is
murdering a whole population in
Vietnam in order to bring
"progress" and "democracy" to
the "poor, benighted" peasants,
so Shockley proposes "benevolent

genocide" to "save" the "poor,
unfortunate" Black people.
Many people do not take
Shockley seriously and think he is
just a foolish oid man. But in
several states, bills are being
introduced to sterilize welfare
mothers.
We are now engaged in
protesting some of the most
inhuman bombings that have
occurred in Vietnam. But
remember that atrocities against
the Vietnamese have escalated in
proportion to their success in
gaining liberation.
Third World people in this
country are beginning a liberation
struggle. The more successes they
win, the more men like Shockley
will escalate their plans for
exterminating Third World people.
