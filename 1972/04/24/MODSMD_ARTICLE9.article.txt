## Trashing Safer 
### 
Nathan a. therien

Wishy-washy liberals such as myself have argued against trashing in
the past for a variety of reasons. We said it was "counter-productive"
in that it alientated middle Americans. We said it was wrong because it
was violent and we were against violence. We said it only hurt the
University, which, although undeniably complicitous in the war, is
also a force for rationality and freedom in a generally more repressive
society, and therefore should be spared as an institution.
I at least was always a little embarassed when my objections to
trashing came under very close scrutiny by my more radically inclined
friends. The argument that trashing is counter-productive falls apart
when it becomes clear — as it certainly has by now — that "the
people" cannot influence the White House and the Pentagon anyway.
Although nothing is really lost by alienating voters (When was the
last election that really made any difference, at least as far as this war
is concerned?), trashing can be effective in so far as it frightens the
government into believing society might be disintegrating, and in so
far as it threatens a valuable part of society.
Violence and Violence
No one can hold to the objection against trashing as violence per se
with much integrity for long when confronted with the simple
rebuttal that violence against property at Stanford and violence
against people in Vietnam (a violence that goes on and on and on) are
hardly comparable.
If breaking windows has even the slightest chance of contributing
in the smallest way to the end of the far greater violence which is the
Vietnam war, then it seems an intelligent tactic. It is facile in the
extreme to lump window breaking and killing together, and then on
the basis of this inane categorization to dismiss trashing's potential to
help halt the killing.
The objection against trashing on the grounds that it only hurts the
University, and that the University ought to be spared because on
balance it is a force for good, is an argument I have yet to abandon
entirely. However, this objection, too, seems much weaker to me now
than it did before. The damage to the University seems a small price
to pay for the smashing of the complacent smirk it is easy to imagine
Nixon wearing as he dismisses the possibility of domestic
repercussions as a serious consideration in such policy decisions as the
renewed bombing. I begin to feel that another $300,000 window
replacement bill for Stanford (maybe even if it does endanger that
$300 million fund drive) might be worth it.
Weakness of Marches
Of course there are alternative ways to inform Nixon of continued
opposition to the war, and I am not speaking of such "efforts" as
President Lyman's embarrassingly pallid letter. In the past, peaceful
mass marches have nroven effective as dramatic expressions of
discontent. But this tactic has very definite — perhaps over-riding
weaknesses compared to trashing. Trashing has always had the
noteworthy advantage of attracting more publicity for less effort than
most peaceful marches.
And as of Thursday night, the tactic of peaceful marches has been
even more seriously compromised, and the tactic of trashing made
considerably more attractive. Trashing can be accomplished by small
mobile groups with relative impunity, while a peaceful march masses
hundreds of unarmed people together in the open where they can
easily be set upon and beaten by rampaging hoodlums in uniform
operating with the sanction of society.
Clearly, along with its many other advantages, trashing is now a
safer mode of political protest than the traditional democratic forms
formally protected under the United States Constitution, or, at least
at Stanford, by respect for the right of peaceful protest.

far as it threatens a valuable part of society.
Violence and Violence
No one can hold to the objection against trashing as violence per se
with much integrity for long when confronted with the simple
rebuttal that violence against property at Stanford and violence
against people in Vietnam (a violence that goes on and on and on) are
hardly comparable.
If breaking windows has even the slightest chance of contributing
in the smallest way to the end of the far greater violence which is the
Vietnam war, then it seems an intelligent tactic. It is facile in the
extreme to lump window breaking and killing together, and then on
the basis of this inane categorization to dismiss trashing's potential to
help halt the killing.
The objection against trashing on the grounds that it only hurts the
University, and that the University ought to be spared because on
balance it is a force for good, is an argument I have yet to abandon
entirely. However, this objection, too, seems much weaker to me now
than it did before. The damage to the University seems a small price
to pay for the smashing of the complacent smirk it is easy to imagine
Nixon wearing as he dismisses the possibility of domestic
repercussions as a serious consideration in such policy decisions as the
renewed bombing. I begin to feel that another $300,000 window
replacement bill for Stanford (maybe even if it does endanger that
$300 million fund drive) might be worth it.
Weakness of Marches
Of course there are alternative ways to inform Nixon of continued
opposition to the war, and I am not speaking of such "efforts" as
President Lyman's embarrassingly pallid letter. In the past, peaceful
mass marches have nroven effective as dramatic expressions of
discontent. But this tactic has very definite — perhaps over-riding
weaknesses compared to trashing. Trashing has always had the
noteworthy advantage of attracting more publicity for less effort than
most peaceful marches.
And as of Thursday night, the tactic of peaceful marches has been
even more seriously compromised, and the tactic of trashing made
considerably more attractive. Trashing can be accomplished by small
mobile groups with relative impunity, while a peaceful march masses
hundreds of unarmed people together in the open where they can
easily be set upon and beaten by rampaging hoodlums in uniform
operating with the sanction of society.
Clearly, along with its many other advantages, trashing is now a
safer mode of political protest than the traditional democratic forms
formally protected under the United States Constitution, or, at least
at Stanford, by respect for the right of peaceful protest.

Wishy-washy liberals such as myself have argued against trashing in
the past for a variety of reasons. We said it was "counter-productive"
in that it alientated middle Americans. We said it was wrong because it
was violent and we were against violence. We said it only hurt the
University, which, although undeniably complicitous in the war, is
also a force for rationality and freedom in a generally more repressive
society, and therefore should be spared as an institution.
I at least was always a little embarassed when my objections to
trashing came under very close scrutiny by my more radically inclined
friends. The argument that trashing is counter-productive falls apart
when it becomes clear — as it certainly has by now — that "the
people" cannot influence the White House and the Pentagon anyway.
Although nothing is really lost by alienating voters (When was the
last election that really made any difference, at least as far as this war
is concerned?), trashing can be effective in so far as it frightens the
government into believing society might be disintegrating, and in so
far as it threatens a valuable part of society.
