# Protesters Talk With Researchers; Physical Plant Blockade Fizzles
## 
### DAVE SPECTOR BOB BACON 
Appro ximately 75 demonstrators
entered the Durand (Aero and Astro)
Building yesterday and engaged grad
uate students and professors in discus
sions on the possible war-related uses
of their research.
The discussions and a subsequent
march to Hansen Lab, which was
temporarily closed, and the Computa
tion Center followed a noon rally
attended by 225 people. Young Crow
Fred Royce proposed that the group

"march to the Labs and stop at
Durand . . . nonviolently and peace
fully enter and talk to people."
Early yesterday morning, a planned
shut down of the Physical Plant fizzled
out when no more than 35 demon
strators appeared. The group later met
again in front of President Lyman's
office. Lyman is presently in Chicago.
When the demonstrators reached
Durand, the building was closed. But
while the group of 100 people were
marching around it, students inside
opened the doors to the demon

strators. Inside most of the demon
strators questioned a third year grad
student, admittedly nervous, on his
feelings about the war in Indochina.
Responding to a question by Jeff
Youdelman of Palo Alto Venceremos
on the material connection between
Stanford and the war, the student
replied, "Certainly there is a war in
Southeast Asia, I'm definitely against
the war; I'm against all war."
Demonstrators attempted to talk
with Electrical Engineering professor
Alan Waterman, Jr., whose work in
microwave research has been claimed
to be essential for army communica
tions, but he was supposedly not in.
Small groups remained speaking
with grad students and professors
about the reasons for their doing
claimed war-related work. Under close
scrutiny by three Santa Clara Sheriff's
cars filled with tactical police, 55
demonstrators marched to the tem
porarily closed Hansen Labs and then
to the Computation Center. The main
computer section was closed although
the building remained open. The group
soon broke up.
A report is being filed with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation be
cause of damage to a government
owned pulse generator during Friday
morning's "mill-in" of Hansen Labs.
According to Marshall O'Neill, as
sociate director of the lab, the pulse
generator is being used in an Office of
Naval Research contract on an acous
tic microscope. The work is being
done for the Hartford Foundation.
In the morning's activities, demon
strators placed an informational picket
line at the Physical Plant yards near
the security compound, then met in
front of President Lyman's office.
The group at the Physical Plant
stopped trucks briefly to speak to the
drivers, and urged workers going on

duty to "slow it down today."
No trucks were stopped and no
employees were prevented from going
to their jobs. The demonstrators
claimed that the Indochina War causes
layoffs and inflation; hence workers
ought to join their so-called "anti-war"
activities.
About 50 people gathered outside
Lyman's office at 9 a.m. The doors
were locked and Lyman was not there
and the demonstrators shouted at
presidential aide John Schwartz and
vice-provost Robert Rosenzweig in
second story windows.
The group, led by Don Lee, asked
questions of Stanford security officers
and Santa Clara County Sheriff's
deputies, then met on the Inner Quad
to discuss future tactics.
Riot-equipped deputies were on the
scene at both incidents, but did not
leave their cars.
At 7:30 tonight, there will be a
meeting at Serra House in Wilbur for
the people who were arrested Friday
and to collect witness statements.
