## Women Blast Shockley 
### 
s women's union

On Thursday, April 20, members of the Women's
Union marched into William Shockley's "Physics of
Semiconductor Devices" class to demonstrate their
solidarity with Third World women who are direct
targets of Shockley's theories. While most of the
demonstrators chanted "Free our sisters, free
ourselves!", two women passed the following
statement out to Shockley and his students:
"For women, Shockley's "racial science"
represents a real and immediate danger. Eugenics
has never been anything other than a justification
for genocidal practices. Shockley is no exception to
the rule. He proposes a benevolent control of
inferior populations through voluntary sterilization
programs for black welfare mothers. What does this
really mean? It means that women who are
economically deprived are forced to submit to the
control of the white ruling class in order to receive
the benefits that are rightfully theirs.
Lack of Control
'The threat of Shockley's theories may not be
immediately evident. But we too have never directly
determined the economic and personal conditions
of our lives. Many white women have become aware
of their own lack of control through the refusal of
national and state legislature to repeal abortion
laws.

"Eugenic programs — genocide — are necessarily
connected with anti-feminist legislation. Shockley's
plans, if not challenged, would lead not only to the
genocide of black people but to the complete
subjugation of women."
While the sisters passed out the statement
Shockley switched on his tape recorder and started
putting his camera together while saying, "I will
remark that you are now disrupting a class." One of
the women responded, "Tough, we are now
leaving." All the tape recorder caught was the loud
chanting of the women as they marched out of the
room.
Many people counter protests against Shockley
with: "He's a sick man; nobody listens to him; leave
him alone and he'll die and everyone will forget his
ideas." Many states are now considering legislation
based on Shockley's theories and those of his
cronies. Men from Hoover Institution have argued
for the institution of his ideas on a state level. One
extension of his theories is the bill now before the
California legislature urging that illegitimate
children of welfare mothers be taken away from
them For these reasons we must act decisively
against Shockley on all possible fronts. He is a
threat to all of us.
