Cruel and Unusual
Editor, THE DAILY:
On behalf of the
impressionable young people of
your university, who are entitled
to both sides of any question, I
would appreciate having the
following letter, the original of
which was sent by me to six
justices of the Supreme Court of
California, published in the
; Stanford Daily.
If yours is a free press, some
i rebuttal should be permitted to
! the theories of Professor
| Amsterdam — which were rather
j ruthlessly forced on the people of
California against the will of the

majority.
To remember the agonizing
death of a young pregnant mother
and then profess attacks of
conscience because Manson and
his ilk might be "dehumanized" is
asinine to a degree that strongly
suggests that there is something at
work here far more insidious and
dangerous to the future of our
country than the hypocrites and
maudlin sentimentalists who
merely deserve our scorn.
The letter follows:
Gentlemen:
Speaking of "cruel and unusual
punishment," let me tell you
about my brother.
He was a mentally confused,
but gentle and unfailingly
courteous 72-year-old veteran of
World War I — given to taking
long walks through city streets to
break the monotony of existence
in the nursing home, to which he
had been transferred by the
Veterans Administration Hospital

with a recommendation to me
that he be permitted considerable
freedom.
On the evening of February 4,
1972 he took his last walk.
Around 11 that night he was
found burning in the street,
having been doused with gasoline
and set afire following a beating
so savage his face and body were
battered and there was blood on a
nearby building. > Rushed by
helicopter to the USC-County
bum vard, with his clothing in
cinders, he died at 3:45 a.m. Had
he been given a choice, I think he
would have regarded the gas
chamber or electric chair as very
mild punishment by comparison.
In addition to the thrill of their
fun and games, his killers received
an unexpected bonus two weeks
later — when any lingering vestige
of guilt or fear that might have
been plaguing them was swept
away by the boxcar headlines of

February 18th: DEATH
PENALTY KILLED! Now, in the
unlikely event they are
apprehended and convicted, the
worst that could happen will leave
them eligible for parole in 7 years.
Thanks to you gentlemen, no
serious deterrrent now stands in
the way of their further excesses
and macabre thrills.
The duty of protecting society
from the occasional vicious misfit
who has been adjudged a
continuing and lethal danger to
others, falls heaviest on a Judge
when the death penalty must be
imposed. It is no task for
weaklings. In scanning your
photographs, gentlemen, I am
impelled to the conclusion that
the only bench you are fit to sit
on may be found in the nearest
public park — to which I hope
you will have the grace to retire at
an early date. In that appropriate
setting you can exchange
"enlightened" views with the
American Civil Liberties Union,
the "intellectuals" of the
entertainment and literary worlds,
and other social hypocrites who
piously yearn "to make our
country better" by the
(personally profitable) promotion
of more pornography, more
degenerate violence, more
interracial hate, and easy access to
drugs.

and then profess attacks of
conscience because Manson and
his ilk might be "dehumanized" is
asinine to a degree that strongly
suggests that there is something at
work here far more insidious and
dangerous to the future of our
country than the hypocrites and
maudlin sentimentalists who
merely deserve our scorn.
The letter follows:
Gentlemen:
Speaking of "cruel and unusual
punishment," let me tell you
about my brother.
He was a mentally confused,
but gentle and unfailingly
courteous 72-year-old veteran of
World War I — given to taking
long walks through city streets to
break the monotony of existence
in the nursing home, to which he
had been transferred by the
Veterans Administration Hospital

with a recommendation to me
that he be permitted considerable
freedom.
On the evening of February 4,
1972 he took his last walk.
Around 11 that night he was
found burning in the street,
having been doused with gasoline
and set afire following a beating
so savage his face and body were
battered and there was blood on a
nearby building. > Rushed by
helicopter to the USC-County
bum vard, with his clothing in
cinders, he died at 3:45 a.m. Had
he been given a choice, I think he
would have regarded the gas
chamber or electric chair as very
mild punishment by comparison.
In addition to the thrill of their
fun and games, his killers received
an unexpected bonus two weeks
later — when any lingering vestige
of guilt or fear that might have
been plaguing them was swept
away by the boxcar headlines of

February 18th: DEATH
PENALTY KILLED! Now, in the
unlikely event they are
apprehended and convicted, the
worst that could happen will leave
them eligible for parole in 7 years.
Thanks to you gentlemen, no
serious deterrrent now stands in
the way of their further excesses
and macabre thrills.
The duty of protecting society
from the occasional vicious misfit
who has been adjudged a
continuing and lethal danger to
others, falls heaviest on a Judge
when the death penalty must be
imposed. It is no task for
weaklings. In scanning your
photographs, gentlemen, I am
impelled to the conclusion that
the only bench you are fit to sit
on may be found in the nearest
public park — to which I hope
you will have the grace to retire at
an early date. In that appropriate
setting you can exchange
"enlightened" views with the
American Civil Liberties Union,
the "intellectuals" of the
entertainment and literary worlds,
and other social hypocrites who
piously yearn "to make our
country better" by the
(personally profitable) promotion
of more pornography, more
degenerate violence, more
interracial hate, and easy access to
drugs.

On behalf of the
impressionable young people of
your university, who are entitled
to both sides of any question, I
would appreciate having the
following letter, the original of
which was sent by me to six
justices of the Supreme Court of
California, published in the
; Stanford Daily.
If yours is a free press, some
i rebuttal should be permitted to
! the theories of Professor
| Amsterdam — which were rather
j ruthlessly forced on the people of
California against the will of the

majority.
To remember the agonizing
death of a young pregnant mother
and then profess attacks of
conscience because Manson and
his ilk might be "dehumanized" is
asinine to a degree that strongly
suggests that there is something at
work here far more insidious and
dangerous to the future of our
country than the hypocrites and
