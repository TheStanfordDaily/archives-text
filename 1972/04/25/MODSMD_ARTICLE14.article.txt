# Marlboro's Brevity Problem
## 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
The Music from Marlboro ensemble gave a
generally good performance last Friday in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, considering what
they played. Three of their four selections
consisted of short, vignette-like pieces. At first
refreshing because of their brevity, they soon
became monotonous. In a short work there is
little room for doing anything but exposing a
theme. Unfortunately,therewasusually little or
no development of the basic theme.
The concert began badly. The first
selection was "Fourteen Variations in
Major for Paino, Violin, and Cello", by
Beethoven. The sections are very precise and
classical, often sounding more like Mozart
than Beethoven.
The real problem did not lie in the
selection, but in the performers. Violinist
Felix Galimir squeaked on the higher passages,
His tone was too thin. Granted, the pieces are
delicate, but there is enough of Beethoven's
emotion understated to require a stronger
violin.
Galimir played with technical precision in
most places, except where he had to combine
a high passage with a fast arpeggio, as in the
tenth variation, where he sounded out of
tune. Occasionally, as in the third variation,
Galimir executed a rapid arpeggio that was
precise but cold. He was never able to put the
necessary expression in.
Cellist James Kreger came off even worse.
He started out plagued by a cello that was
about a quarter tone flat. He then aggravated
the situation. He played jarring double-toned
notes. His arpeggios were poor, filled with the
kinds of squeaks and slides one does not
expect from a professional.
Expressive Playing
Kreger was at his comparative best in the
slower, more melodic parts. He has a strong
feel for pathos. He was especially expressive in
the eighth variation. He used a broad vibrato
that milked every emotion out of the section.
He played so movingly that I expected him, if
not the audience, to be in tears at the end.
By far the best performer in the selection
was David Golub, the pianist. Granted, the
piano part is not too taxing, but it does
require a combination of technique,
expression and humor.
Golub fulfilled every demand. In the
second variation, the piano should sound like
a music box. Golub was as clear as a machine,
but he substituted expression in tiny dynamic
swells and humor in carefully-timed beat
changes for mechanical woodenness.
His arpeggios were always clear, his
dynamics always convincing. It was he who
saved the selection from failing completely.

The next group they played was Haydn's
"Six Scottish Songs". Mezzo soprano Mary
Burgess joined the three men who had just
performed.
A Beautiful Voice
Burgess has a beautiful voice, perfect for
the songs. It is not so heavy that singing a
folk-type song was like trying to cram a size
11 foot into a size 6 shoe, but it is full and
rich enough to manage ably Haydn's
"unfolk-like" turns and arpeggios.
Burgess mixed skill with a feeling for the
music. She really conveyed the ideas
expressed in the words. She was outstanding
in the last two songs. The fifth song, "Mary's
Dream," is quiet and hymn-like. It speaks of a
young girl who, on dreaming of her far-off
lvoer, hears a voice telling her not to weep for
him.
The music begins describing the rising
moon and the night. Burgess' voice was
reassuring, the kind one would expect in an
angel or a dream figure.
In an abrupt patriotic turn around came
the last song, "Scots Who Hae Wi' Wallace
Bled." Burgess sounded proud, singing in a
crisp, strong forte and increasing her
heretofore subtle Scottish accent in a broad
burr. The piece was an excellent ending to the
first half of the program.
The instrumentalists improved when
Burgess came on the scene. The light violin,
serving as background, was as effective here as
it had not been before. The fourth song
allowed Galimir to display his technical
abilities in rapid scales which he did well. His
expressiveness in more melodic passages were
understated, but good in context.
Crisp Scales
Kreger also improved, although not as
much. He must have tuned up between
groups. His fast scales in the third song were
crisp, proving he did have good, if not great,
technique. He still was unclear on his octave
jumps in the fifth piece, if anyone was
listening to anything but Burgess.
After intermission, Galimir, Kreger, and
Graham, the violist, and Miriam Fried,
violinist, played "Six Bagatelles, op. 9" by
Webem.
All the dances are terribly short, even for
Webern. The artists successfully achieved
Webern's style. The first bagatelle consisted of
a constant piano, smooth and gentle, except
for a few surprise forte outbursts. The
performers gave no hint of the subitos. They
played the piece very straight, just as Webern
wrote it.
The group retained the flavor of Webern in
the rest of the pieces as well. Graham stood
out as the best performer in the group,

especially in the fourth bagatelle. The viola
ticked like a clock. The impression remained
long after the piece, a tribute to both
Webern's composing and Graham's
understanding of the number.
The final selection of the program was
Dvorak's "Quintet in A Major, op. 81", for
which Golub rejoined the group. This was the
only full-bodied chamber group they did. It
was a great one with which to end the
program.
Peasant Flavor
The piece combines romantic devices with a
distinctly peasant flavor. Only an Eastern
European composer could have written such
authentic folk-like music. A group of Czech
peasants would have been perfectly at home.
Luckily, so were the performers.
Fried was amazing. Her technique in
arpeggios was consummate. Her interpretation
of the boisterous melodies was earthy, of the
peaceful melodies, pastoral.
In the second movement there is a
trade-off of themes among the instruments.
When Fried got a hold of the theme, she
played it for all it had, putting in as much
expression, playing as freely as possible with
tempo and dynamics.
Graham was her match on the viola. It's
too bad the two of them did not play in the
first half of the program; whatever Fried
could do on the violin, Graham could do on
the viola.
Technical Skill
The first movement focuses on the viola in
many areas. There is a viola "solo,"
accompanied softly by the other instruments.
Graham put all of himself into it. He
displayed a technical skill surpassed only by
his interpretative skill.
The second movement is the cello's
movement. Here Kremer played beautifully.
One of his bow strings broke in the midst of
it; he sounded better afterwards. His vibrato
created a richness rarely heard, even on the
cello. His pathos was enormous, yet there was
no way he could have overdone it.
Galimir and Golub were mostly peripheral
players. Whenever they got the chance,
however, they made the most of their talents.
Galimir's thin tone was still disturbing, but he
was able to overshadow it with technique and
feeling. Golub was, as before, excellent in
every way.
The most depressing thing about the
concert was not the lack of genius in the
performers, but the lack of people in the
audience. The auditorium was about half-full,
mostly with older people, not students. It is
truly pathetic that such a performance drew
such a small crowd.
