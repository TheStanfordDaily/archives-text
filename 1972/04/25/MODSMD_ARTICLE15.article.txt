# Van Comes Through In The End
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Van Morrison waited a
dangerously long time, but still
managed to send his audience
rocking out of the Old Pavilion
Saturday night.
The first three quarters of the
concert were absolute dreck. Not
until the last three numbers of his
regular set did he really unwind
and blow the roof off the
building.
A good-sized crowd sat on its
hands for about two and a half
hours until Morrison brought
them onto their feet for his last
three numbers and two encores.
Delta Wires opened the bill,
apparently revealing part of Van's
strategy: if you're coupled with
an atrocious group, you look good
by comparison. Delta Wires
played a seemingly interminable
set, in which every number
sounded like a cheap imitation of
Boz Scaggs. The only time I
applauded was when they finally
left the stage.
However, there were two good
things about that first set. First,
Lt. Don Tamm of the Sheriff's
office did NOT appear to declare
the gathering an illegal assembly.
And second, the gy rations of the
lead singer-harmonica player were
incredibly funny to watch.
Unfortunately, I don't think he
MEANT to be funny.
The crowd was extremely
young, most undoubtedly drawn
to the concert on the basis of
Morrison's several hit singles. One
of the more fascinating vignettes
occurered directly in front of me,

when a high school (or younger)
girl, already slightly swacked on
Boone's Farm (God help us!) was
handed her first joint by a worldly
older man of about 20. Her first
drag sounded like she was having
an asthma attack.
The air inside the Pavilion
quickly went stale, and the
acoustics were nothing short of
terrible. No place on campus
could possibly be worse for rock
concerts, and it was almost a
crime to charge up to $4 for the
privilege of not being able to
distinguish any lyrics. No wonder
ASSU Special Events is so deeply
in the red.
The Belfast Cowboy
Anyway, by the time Morrison
came out, it appeared as though
the concert were completely
doomed, and for awhile the
Belfast Cowboy did nothing to
contradict that assumption. His
version of "Moondance" was the
worst I have ever heard anywhere,
and his next several numbers, with
the exception of "Tupelo
Honey," were just as bad. At this
point several persons walked out
of the concert.
Then, finally, Morrison broke
loose. With his excellent back-up
band and a three-member chorus
cooking, he broke into
"Domino," the crowd cheering in
recognition and perhaps relief. He
followed it up with another
rocker, "Wild Night," by the
conclusion of which there was not
a person on the floor still seated.
The he broke into a much
faster "Blue Money" than his

recorded version, and left the
stage amid cheers and calls for
more.
Before slipping out for good,
he played two excellent encores,
first "Brown-Eyed Girl" and then
"Into the Mystic."
The last five songs left most of
the crowd happy, but could not
disguise the fact that most of the
concert had been seriously flawed.
Besides the atrocious opening
band and the terrible acoustics,
there was Morrison himself, who

spent most of his set rooted to
one place and staring blankly
straight ahead as he sang, looking
either terribly frightened or
terribly bored by the whole thing.
It was not until his final encore,
"Into the Mystic," that he
allowed his eyes to roam around
the Pavilion and managed to
create a little rapport with his
audience.
But despite the problems,
Morrison's last few songs almost
made up for everything.

came out, it appeared as though
the concert were completely
doomed, and for awhile the
Belfast Cowboy did nothing to
contradict that assumption. His
version of "Moondance" was the
worst I have ever heard anywhere,
and his next several numbers, with
the exception of "Tupelo
Honey," were just as bad. At this
point several persons walked out
of the concert.
Then, finally, Morrison broke
loose. With his excellent back-up
band and a three-member chorus
cooking, he broke into
"Domino," the crowd cheering in
recognition and perhaps relief. He
followed it up with another
rocker, "Wild Night," by the
conclusion of which there was not
a person on the floor still seated.
The he broke into a much
faster "Blue Money" than his

recorded version, and left the
stage amid cheers and calls for
more.
Before slipping out for good,
he played two excellent encores,
first "Brown-Eyed Girl" and then
"Into the Mystic."
The last five songs left most of
the crowd happy, but could not
disguise the fact that most of the
concert had been seriously flawed.
Besides the atrocious opening
band and the terrible acoustics,
there was Morrison himself, who

spent most of his set rooted to
one place and staring blankly
straight ahead as he sang, looking
either terribly frightened or
terribly bored by the whole thing.
It was not until his final encore,
"Into the Mystic," that he
allowed his eyes to roam around
the Pavilion and managed to
create a little rapport with his
audience.
But despite the problems,
Morrison's last few songs almost
made up for everything.


BUILDING A TENT—ACT Actors (left to right) Herbert Foster, Marc Singer, Scott Thomas and E. Kerrigan Prescott portray a group of
workmen who erect on stage a giant marquee tent for their employer's daughter's wedding in the ACT production of 'The Contractor." 'The
Contractor" will be performed tonight, Thursday and Friday nights at 8:30 p.m. at the Geary Theater in San Francisco. Tickets are priced at
$ 4.9 0-$ 6.9 oon weeknights and $5.90-$7.90 on Friday night. $3 student rush tickets are sold 15 minutes before curtain if available.
Van Morrison waited a
dangerously long time, but still
managed to send his audience
rocking out of the Old Pavilion
Saturday night.
The first three quarters of the
concert were absolute dreck. Not
until the last three numbers of his
regular set did he really unwind
and blow the roof off the
building.
A good-sized crowd sat on its
hands for about two and a half
hours until Morrison brought
them onto their feet for his last
three numbers and two encores.
Delta Wires opened the bill,
apparently revealing part of Van's
strategy: if you're coupled with
an atrocious group, you look good
by comparison. Delta Wires
played a seemingly interminable
set, in which every number
sounded like a cheap imitation of
Boz Scaggs. The only time I
applauded was when they finally
left the stage.
However, there were two good
things about that first set. First,
Lt. Don Tamm of the Sheriff's
office did NOT appear to declare
the gathering an illegal assembly.
And second, the gy rations of the
lead singer-harmonica player were
incredibly funny to watch.
Unfortunately, I don't think he
MEANT to be funny.
The crowd was extremely
young, most undoubtedly drawn
to the concert on the basis of
Morrison's several hit singles. One
of the more fascinating vignettes
occurered directly in front of me,

when a high school (or younger)
girl, already slightly swacked on
Boone's Farm (God help us!) was
handed her first joint by a worldly
older man of about 20. Her first
drag sounded like she was having
an asthma attack.
The air inside the Pavilion
quickly went stale, and the
acoustics were nothing short of
terrible. No place on campus
could possibly be worse for rock
concerts, and it was almost a
crime to charge up to $4 for the
privilege of not being able to
distinguish any lyrics. No wonder
ASSU Special Events is so deeply
in the red.
