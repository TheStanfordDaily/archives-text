# Severe Flaws Mar 'USA'
## 
### STU ALLEN 
Most striking of the many
changes which occurred in
America in the turbulent years
from 1890 to 1917 was the shift
in values as America's conception
of itself moved from the
individual entrepeneur of the
small town or city to the large,
urban corporation, with a wealthy
chieftain at its head. "USA," a
dramatic review based on the
novel by John Dos Passos, focuses
on this period and on this
transformation to depict "the rise
of fascist America in story, song,
and dance."
The current Lone Mountain
College production,
unfortunately, is marred by severe
flaws of acting and directing, not
the least of which is that it is very
often boring. The major defects
involve acting that is frequently
awkward and unconvincing, and
cuts that weren't made and should
have been, which drag the middle
of the show on to a
disproportionate length and
render the conclusion a lurching,
undeveloped ending.
As in the novels, the best parts
of the show are the ten
"commemorative tributes," or
biographies, of such luminaries
as Andrew Carnegie, J.P. Morgan,
and Henry Ford. These tributes
are fascinating accounts of the

careers and philosophies of these
people, and two in particular are
splendidly well acted.
Tragic Contrast
Cynthia Splatt offers an
absorbing impression of Isadora
Duncan that combines both the
intensity that endeared Ms.
Duncan to millions of fans and
the empty hatred that drove her
on. Robert Behling portrays a
lanky, inspiring Eugene V. Debs,
and frames the whole show in the
tragic contrast between the
support Debs won as a labor
leader in the 1890's and the
ostracism to which he was
relegated by his former brothers
for speaking out against the war in
1918.
What happened to transform
the 1890 vision of a new society
based on social equality into a
Hun-hating acceptance of the ever
more-stratified American society
is shown in the career of John
Ward Morehouse, also played by
Behling. A small-city, middle-class
youth with the archetypal values
of innocence, purity, integrity,
and ambition, Morehouse marries
into a wealthy Pittsburgh
bessemer steel family. We see him
throw over his old values of
innocence and purity, and rise to
the top as a public relations
consultant.
On the war, his wife becomes

schizophrenic, a condition which
is not helped by his lack of
affection for her, and yet, which
does not visibly upset him, except
when she calls him a cold fish,"
and an "empty man." As he lives
out his lonely, joyless life, he
counsels his young associate that
managing the public's mind is one
of the most important functions
of society's leaders. Furthermore,
he makes public speeches
emphasizing the opportunity open
in America to young men, willing
to work hard and willing to leam,
despite his own experience of not
getting anywhere until his
marriage into the upper class.
A compelling Story
Morehouse's career is the
metaphor used by Dos Passos to
depict the ideology of America's
ruling class and how that ideology
was accepted, in his view, by the
middle and working classes, partly
in the process of fighting World
War I, and partly in seeking the
fortunes they saw being amassed
by the industrial elite. It is a
compelling and radicalizing story,
and one certainly feels contempt
for Morehouse and the corrupt
dass around him by the end of
the play.
The role of Morehouse is
played by Behling in an uneven
manner that reflects the difficulty
of giving life to such a shallow
character. Behling is not up to the
challenge, as he is overly stiff in
his movement and speech. To
some degree Morehouse is meant
to be awkward, however, and one
can readily forgive Behling's
interpretation.
The show doesn't hold
together, because too much of it
is superfluous to this story.
Several long scenes are devoted to
Morehouse's secretary, her
brother, and his friend. These
scenes do not advance the story,
and should have been cut. There is
a romance, for example, between
the friend and the secretary
(to-be), which is acted with an
almost embarrassingly
unconvincing attempt at teen-age
emotions.
An Unbalanced Form
Similarly, World War I occupies
too much of the show, for no
good reason. The effect of the war
on the society is not shown:
instead the cast sings and dances
to the various songs that emerged
from the era, such as "Over
There," "Good Morning, Mr.
Zip-Zip-Zip!," and "How Ya
Gonna Keep 'Em Down on the
Farm?." This is entertaining, but
the show develops an unbalanced
form as it switches from a long
focus on the war to a short
picture of a deteriorating society
of the Twenties, and concludes
with the full cast singing 'The
Internationale."
One loses the thread of the
idea in the confusion: one is left
wondering how, for example, the
socialist vision of Dos Passos in
the thirties is going to resolve the
problems created by humans' lust
for money and status. What was a
story and a metaphor becomes
little more than a review by the
end of the first act.
The music is generally quite
good, an achievement for both the
student directors, Jeanie Scolini
and DeDe Myland, who are also in
the cast. The music, which at the
start served to integrate the story
and the theme into a unified view
of America's past, by the end gets
in the way. The review loses its
unity and also, unfortunately, the
interest of the audience.
(USA will play at 8:30 p.m. on
April 27th, 28th, and 29th in the
Main Theater of Lone Mountain
College, 2800 Turk Blvd., in the
City. Tickets are $2.50 general
and $ 1.50 for students.)
