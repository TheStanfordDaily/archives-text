# Excellent Job By Dixon

### DAVID W. WILLIAMS 
It would not be unfair to suggest that Dean
Dixon, who conducted the San Francisco symphony
orchestra so well last Wednesday evening, is a most
conspicuous example of the harm the society does
to black men. He left this country in 1948 to seek
wider opportunities in Europe, and in his absence
things have improved very little for black men
interested in creating or interpreting "European"
music.
Even Henry Lewis has had to "play second
fiddle" to a number of second rank and second rate
conductors. It was thus good for the soul to see Mr.
Dixon conduct; his power, precision, intelligence,
and control were supremely manifest as he guided
the orchestra through the Brahms 'Tragic
Overture," Petr Eben's "Vox clamatis," and the
Third Symphony of Bruckner.
Dixon's tempo in the Brahms overture was quite
deliberate; there was indeed a conscious effort on
the part of the conductor to emphasize the
variations of tempo and texture in this magnificent
composition. This work is quite different from the
"Academic Festival Overture," which directly
precedes it in the Brahms catalogue, and it achieves
its effect by contrasts of strength as represented by
the tutti and sorrow presented in fairly extended
concertante passages and at least through an
extended use of muted strings. I have rarely heard
the overture sound more "heroic," and the
orchestra seemed to play with particular grace and
clarity.
The Eben composition, essentially a musical
description of the life of John the Baptist, in which
the forty-four year old Czech composer attempts to
picture the clash of two worlds, i.e., that of the Old
Testament and that of the New, was yet another
West Coast premiere, which was generally
successful. The writing is very clear, profoundly

melodic, and highly constructed. Most noteworthy
were the trumpet writing, and the brilliant use of
the Gregorian "Sanctus" motif. The composition
never seemed to lag, the tempos were apparently
just right, and the orchestra very much atuned to
what they were doing. In short, this premiere was an
absolute triumph both for Mr. Dixon and Mr. Eben.
Everyone has his blind spots, and I have to admit
that except in a very few cases I find the music of
Anton Bruckner little more than dull. His Motets,
choral works, and a few of his symphonies arouse
some interest, but I cannot say I enjoyed the last
two movements of the Third Symphony very much.
Yes, yes, I understand that he is quite the thing
from Amsterdam to Warsaw these days, and
"specialists" like Haitink, Jochum, and Dixon are in
a large measure responsible for his coming back into
fashion. Still Brahms is melodically more
interesting, Mahler is much the finer craftsman and
Wagner is infinitely more exciting.
The first movement of the Third symphony,
marked Moderate; is more quickly misterioso,
contains an enormous main theme that seems to
lack anything resembling grace, with a working-out
section that is a bit obvious. The second movement,
adagio, is sweet as only Bruckner can be, and indeed
seems the most interesting movement of the four.
Here the orchestra seemed really first rate as the
mood went from serious to more serious. The
Scherzo is clumsy and the finale would have put
Orpheus to sleep. It is true that this symphony is
not often played, but as we approach the bottom of
the nineteenth-century barrel, such neglect seems
almost just. Still one left grateful for the Eben "Vox
clamatis," and new insights into the tragic overture,
and hoping that the American musical establishment
will have something for this black conductor, and
indeed a dozen others still waiting in the wings, to
do.
