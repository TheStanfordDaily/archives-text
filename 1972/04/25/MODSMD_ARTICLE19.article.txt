Demos Continue
Escalated U.S. bombing in
Southeast Asia inspired continued
antiwar protest rallies yesterday at the
University of California at Berkeley,
Columbia University, Westover Air
Force Base in Massachusetts and the
McDonnell Douglas Corp. in St. Louis,
Mo.
In Berkeley, between 300 and 400
persons gathered for a noon rally, then
picketed at the main entrance to the
campus later in the afternoon. At
Columbia, demonstrators closed eight
buildings yesterday morning, refusing
entry to faculty or students.
Approximately 225 persons
assembled in a ballpark near the
McDonnell-Douglas Company
property to hear antiwar speakers,
while at Westover, 35 persons were
arrested for blocking traffic going into
the Strategic Air Command Base.
Apollo Heads Home
SPACE CENTER, Houston - Apollo
16 astronauts rocketed out of lunar
orbit last night aboard their command
ship, Casper and started the 66-hour,
240,000-mile voyage home with a
record cargo of rocks.
The men of Apollo 16—John W.
Young, Charles M. Duke Jr. and
Thomas K. Mattingly ll—fired the
once bothersome command ship
rocket engine, which had delayed the
moon landing last Thursday, to pull
out of the moon's gravity and speed
toward a splashdown in the South
Pacific this Thursday.
In another space development
yesterday, officials at the Manned
Spacecraft Center announced that
American and Soviet space experts
have agreed to construct a scale model
of a proposed common space docking
system. The move is viewed as a
forerunner to a possible U.S.-Russian
joint manned space flight in 1975.
The agreement came in a set of
reports springing from a meeting last
year in Moscow of American and
Soviet space engineers. It was the third

such meeting and another is planned
for this summer.
Davis Letters Disputed
SAN JOSE — Angela Davis' prosecutor
demanded yesterday that he be
allowed to show jurors letters in which
he said Davis declared herself married
to convict George Jackson and urged
him to "rejoice when pigs' blood is
spilled."
Prosecutor Albert Harris Jr. told
the trial judge that if jurors don't get a
look at the letters"the truth will never
come out in this courtroom."
He argued vehemently, following
defense efforts to suppress the letters,
and read portions of them, attempting
to show their relevance to
murder-kidnap-conspiracy charges
against Davis.
Davis' defense attorney, Leo
Branton, acknowledged earlier that she
wrote convict George Jackson love
letters, but sought to suppress two of
them as "totally irrelevant" to her trial
on murder, kidnap and conspiracy
charges.
The dispute over the letters was in
open court but with the jury excused
for the day.
Food Laws Violated
WASHINGTON - A Stanford
University researcher said yesterday
that secret food-safety files opened by
his lawsuit show the Food and Drug
Administration "has consistently and
routinely countenanced violations of
the law which have endangered the
public health."
"Both scientifically and legally,
bureaucratic secrecy has made actions
possible which could never stand the
light of public review," said Dale B.
Hattis, a graduate student in genetics.
FDA officials were not immediately
available for comment.
Hattis' 78-page report lists a series
of actions culminating, he said, in
smoked-fish processors being allowed
to add sodium nitrite, a preservative,
after the FDA learned many firms
were ignoring federal regulations and
using additive illegally.
Price Cuts Ordered
NEW YORK — Price Commission
Chairman C. Jackson Grayson Jr. said
yesterday some of the nation's largest
companies will be ordered in the next
few weeks to make price rollbacks and
customer refunds totaling "hundreds
of millions of dollars."
The action will serve as "a lock, a
second line of defense" in an attempt

to hold down profit-margin increase,
he told the annual luncheon of The
Associated Press.
Flanigan Statement
WASHINGTON — Presidential aide
Peter Flanigan said yesterday that
shortly before settlement of antitrust
suits against International Telephone
& Telegraph Corp. he told Richard G.
Kleindienst that the company would
make a last-ditch fight in the Supreme
Court.
Kleindienst, then deputy attorney
general, has testified before the Senate
Judiciary Committee that he had no
memory of conversations with White
House aides about the ITT affair
settled out of court in the summer of
1971.
