A slashing North Vietnamese attack
yesterday drove South Vietnamese
forces 15 miles back from their central
highlands position north of Kontum
City. The 20-tank offensive crumbled
the highlands defense line and scatter
ed the South Vietnamese 22nd Infan
try Division.
A new defense line was being
formed 10 miles north of the provin
cial capital. Kontum is said to be the
ultimate objective of this portion of
the 27 day old North Vietnamese
offensive.
Some South Vietnamese troops
were trapped at the Tan Canh base on
the old defense line. They were
reported hiding in bunkers. The U.S.
advisors were lifted by helicopter to
another base, Dak To, which fell later.
At last report, U.S. helicopters were
scouring the mountainous jungles
south of Dak To in a search for the
Americans and several hundred South
Vietnamese troops.
The evacuation of the nine U.S.
advisors from Tan Canh was one of the
most daring helicopter rescues of the
war. A third chopper completed the
operation after the first two were lost
under heavy enemy fire.
Reports indicated the second heli

copter may have crashed while taking
off from Tan Canh due to South
Vietnamese troops hanging on the
skids.
John Paul Vann, senior U.S. advisor
in the central highlands, and the
Helicopter pilot, identified as Captain
Todd, completed the evacuation with
out being wounded. They intended to
return to Dak To to pick up the
Americans they had dropped off there,
but the base fell before they could get
there.
Vann told newsmen that he re
gretted that the attempt to save the
Vietnamese soldiers who clung to the
skids led to the greater risk to the
Americans who were dropped off in a
more dangerous position than he had
planned.
Elsewhere, North Vietnamese
troops continued their artillery siege
of An Loc, the provincial capital 60
miles north of Saigon. A surface calm
was reported at the U.S. Command
headquarters in Saigon.
Although fighting built up in the
highlands, the front in the northern
provinces south of the demilitarized
zone was described as static. Enemy
rockets, however, hit Da Nang, wound
ing nine persons.
