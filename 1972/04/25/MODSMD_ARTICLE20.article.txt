## Two Primaries Today 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
With the name of the Democratic
nominee for president still a mystery,
Sens. Hubert Humphrey, George
McGovem, and Edmund Muskie col
lide today in two important primaries.
In both cases, Muskie will probably
come out on the short end, if recent
indications are correct.
In Pennsylvania, 1968 running
mates Humphrey and Muskie will
battle for that state's 182-person
delegation, third largest at the Miami
Beach convention.
And in Massachusetts, McGovern
has reversed the early odds, and polls
now show him the overwhelming

favorite to capture most of the 102
delegates at stake in the primary.
Pennsylvania
Muskie has deemphasized his Mas
sachusetts campaign to concentrate on
his head-to-head match-up with Hum
phrey in Pennsylvania, while McGov
em has done just the opposite,
concentrating most of his fire on the
Bay State.
Muskie has not won a primary since
Illinois, where his only opposition
came from former Sen. Eugene McCar
thy. The only other primary' Muskie
has won was in his "backyard" of New
Hampshire. After successive fourth
place finishes in Florida and Wiscon

sin, a double defeat today could knock
him out of the race for good.
In Pennsylvania, Humphrey looks
like he may have his first primary
victory in three tries for the presi
dency. In 1960, John Kennedy knock
ed him out of the race with victories in
Wisconsin and West Virginia; in 1968
he was defeated in the few primaries
he entered by Robert Kennedy and
McCarthy.
Humphrey
However, Pennsylvania, a state
which gave Humphrey a solid victory
over Richard Nixon in the 1968
election, looks good for him, unless
Muskie can make sizable inroads in
Humphrey's labor support. Muskie has
the backing of most of the state party
organization, including Gov. Milton
Shapp, so it may be a battle of
intra-party factions.
McGovem will also be on the
ballot, although he has done little
campaigning.
In Massachusetts, a Boston Globe
poll published Sunday showed McGov
em leading Muskie 43 percent to 19
percent in that state. McGovern is
expected to benefit from strong
anti-war sentiment there. The Massa
chusetts legislature has been on record
for several years as opposing the
Vietnam War, and Sen. Edward Ken
nedy is one of the Nixon administra
tion's strongest critics.
Once again, the wild card in the
campaign is Alabama Gov. George
Wallace, who has done little campaign
ing in either state, but appears on both
ballots.
