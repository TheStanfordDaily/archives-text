# City Council Meeting
## 
### 
Many speakers, mainly high school students, castigated the PaloAlto Police at
a City Council meeting last night for their treatment of marchers in last week's
protests.
"Child beating is illegal," one high school girl told the Council. "Our parents
are not allowed to beat us. Why should the police be allowed to beat us?"
Several people who had been arrested at El Camino complained that the
police had not told them they were under arrest nor what the charges were.
However, Daily reporters on the scene last Friday heard police announce from a
sound truck that the protesters were under arrest for violation of section 647 C
of the Penal Code (obstruction of traffic).
One speaker, to much applause from the high school students asked the
Council to endorse the Provisionary Revolutionary Government (Viet Cong)
negotiating points, keep war industries out of Palo Alto, and order the police
"not to interfere with anti-war demonstrations."
The protesters comments came during the public forum period at the end of
the meeting. The Council declined to engage in a dialogue with the protesters.
Opposing speakers were heckled.
