# C-15 Split On Judicial Reforms
## 
### JIM WASCHER First of two parts 
The University committee respon
sible for devising a new student
judicial system this year expects to
have its proposal ready by the end of
the quarter in spite of serious divisions
already developing over key issues.
Once they have completed several
months of deliberation, members of
the Committee of 15 (C-15) expect
that there will be close votes on the
issues of: 1) the University President's
ultimate authority over any judicial
system; 2) students' individual rights
under such a system; 3) alternatives
for a new system.
Committee Chairman Frederick
Crawford, an Electrical Engineering
Professor, told the Daily that starting
last week C-15 would "step up the
number of meetings we're having to
two a week" for the rest of the
quarter. Throughout the year, the
C-15 has averaged only one meeting
per month.
Three subcommittees worked since
the fall on reports which present
action alternatives for the C-15 on
these issues.
There are six faculty members on
C-15, six students and three adminis
trators.
According to University literature,
the C-15's "primary responsibility is
review of the Charter o'J 1968
governing the Stanford Legislative and
Judicial System. C-15 receive! sugges

tions from students, faculty and the
administration, reviews them, and
prepares formal amendments for pos
sible adoption."
The Legislative and Judicial Charter
(LJC) of 1968 specifies that in the
event of the "termination" of the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC), the
C-15 would "adopt the problem of
establishing an acceptable judiciary
body as its first order of business."
SJC Collapse
The SJC collapsed early this fall
when the ASSU Senate refused to
appoint members to a committee
which was to select student members
of the SJC. Following the Senate's
refusal, President Lyman established
the current Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) as an interim system.
In spite of C-15's reputation as
perhaps one of the most unwieldy of
the major University committees, most
of the current members say that C-15
has worked well this year.
Committee member Luis Nogales,
Assistant to the President, said the
C-15 has "met earlier and many more
times" thai ir past years. Nogales also
said that vHtre have been "more
organized deliN rations" this year.
'Co Deration'
KimMcCall,i .ophomore, said that
in spite of the difficulty presented by
the discussion of as important a
question as a new judicial system,
there had been "a lot of cooperation
in general."

Law Professor Jack Friedenthal, a
faculty member of the Committee,
said that C-15 is "somewhat bulky
because of its size," but added that the
"cooperation level has been going up."
Friedenthal is a former chairman of
the SJC.
The Residual Authority Subcom
mittee, considering the President's
ultimate control over the judicial
system, was formed by the C-15 in
response to a section of an April 1971
ASSU referendum. The section pro
posed that "the President of the
University shall be strictly limited to
granting amnesty or commuting sen
tences," in any system. The referen
dum was passed by a vote of 1929 to
1186. The subcommittee is chaired by
McCall.
Residual Authority
Currently, Article IV of the LJC
provides that "nothing in these articles
shall be deemed to contravene or limit
the authority of the President to
promulgate and enforce regulations
governing student conduct." This is
known as the "Residual Authority of
the President."
It was by virtue of this residual
authority that Lyman promulgated the
CJP.
The subcommittee report, com
pleted February 17, presented four
major alternatives for the full commit
tee's consideration: acceptance of the
student referendum; repeal of Article
IV; creation of a committee to advise

or bind the President's actions under
his authority; and a proposal of no
change at all.
Advisory Committee
Subcommittee members concede
that only the latter two alternatives
have any real chance of being adopted
by the full C-15. Specifically, McCall
said that a presidential advisory
committee is "the limit that we can
get a majority for."
Nogales, also a member of the
subcommittee, said he is certain that
"residual authority will remain as one
of the characteristics of the University
judicial system." Both McCall and
Nogales expect "many close votes" on
the first two alternatives, which

one Peter Van Petten, Brent Appel, Chris Hocker and Robin Friedman. The Burke slate faces Hocker-Friedman in the
in-off election to be held Wednesday and Thursday.
McCall calls "progressive changes."
McCall predicted that the vote
would go 8-7 against any such
"reforms," with the six students and
Mathematics and Philosophy Professor
Solomon Feferman voting against the
five remaining faculty members and
the three Administrative members.
No Block Vote
However, Nogales says he doesn't
feel "there's going to be a block vote
on every issue." Assistant Religion
Professor Lee Yearley, also a member
of the Residual Authority Subcom
mittee, says "it's very hard to know
where people stand on things" at this
point.
In any case, it appears at this point
that the President's residual authority
over the judicial system will not suffer
any significant curtailment as a result
of C-15's recommendations.
The report of the Subcommittee on
Individual Rights, submitted March 8,
was prepared by acting co-chairmen
Friedenthal and Carl Ingram, a senior
in political science. This subcommittee
was also formed by the full C-15 in
response to a portion of the April
1971 referendum.
Individual Rights
The portion in question proposed
that "no proceedings be undertaken
which contravene in any way the
guarantee of individual rights con
tained in the Constitutions of the
United States and the State of
California."
The subcommittee report is divided
into three sections: "individual rights

clearly not applicable to the University
community"; "individual rights clearly
required"; and "individual rights under
question in 4 our' University communi
ty."
The "clearly not applicable" rights
include such items as the privilege of
the writ of habeas corpus, the
avoidance of excessive bail and the
right to keep and bear arms.
'Required Rights'
Among the "clearly required"
rights are the freedoms of religion,
speech, press, assembly and petition.
Also deemed necessary were the rights
to due process of law, to be informed
of charges, to confront hostile witnes
ses, to have defense counsel, to appeal
on rules of law and to equal protection
under the law.
The rights "under question" in
clude trial by a jury of one's peers;
freedom from double jeopardy; free
dom from self-incrimination; right to a
speedy and public trial; right to
compulsory process for defense wit
nesses; and void from vagueness
doctrine.
Friedenthal says there will be "a
very close division" on these rights
"under question." The law professor
says the split will come "generally
between those peophe who are inter
ested primarily in having an effective
system that can enforce the present
law and those who think the present
law is unsatisfactory." Friedenthal
says the latter group is interested in
devising "a judicial system that can't
convict people."

Sophomore Paul Wolf, a member of
the Individual Rights Subcommittee,
says he expects 9-6 or 8-7 votes against
the alternatives which students would
be most likely to favor. He, like
McCall, included Feferman in the
student voting block. Generally, Wolf
complained that the "committee is not
being run for students."
Other members of the C-15 are:
John Schwartz, Special Assistant to
the President; Gene Franklin, As
sociate Provost for Computing; As
sistant Surgery Professor William Fair;
Assistant English Professor Nancy
Packer; law-business grad student
Steve Heiser; Pete Hanlon, junior in
English; and Steve Nissen, senior in
political science.
