# Lee, Furumoto, And Ho
## Shockley Disrupters Guilty 
### JIM WASCHER 
Hearing Officer Henry Ramsey, Jr.,
Law Professor at Boalt Hall (UC
Berkeley), recommended Sunday that
three students be found guilty by the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) of violat
ing the Policy on Campus Disruption.
The three, Don Lee, Alice Furu
moto and Kwonping Ho, were charged
with having "prevented and disrupted
the effective carrying out of an
examination being taken by the
members" of an electrical engineering

class taught by Professor William
Shockley. The class interruption took
place Jan. 18. It was the first of three
such interruptions by persons protest
ing against Shockley's theories on race
and intelligence.
The 18th of Ramsey's 72 findings
of fact in the case, however, states that
"the sole purpose of the intruders in
entering" the class "was to (1)
condemn Shockley's views on eugenics
and dysgenics as a prologue to (2) a
demand that Shockley debate Cedric
Clark in a public debate by February
28." Clark is an Assistant Psychology
Professor here.
However, Ramsey said "no reason
has been given, nor has it been
indicated, why the demand for a
debate could not have been presented
during his [Shockley's] office hours or
by mailing such a demand to his
campus address."
Sanctions
Ramsey found that "while the
evidence tendered by the University
only proves minimal participation" by
Lee and Ho "beyond a reasonable
doubt, such should more properly be
considered on the issue of sanction
rather than the issue of the violation
of the policy against disruption."
It is up to the full CJP to decide
upon the penalty against the three.
Lee's and Ho's penalty may be heavier
than Furumoto's since CJP Procedures
require the Panel to "take into
account prior violations of University

regulations and the likelihood, or lack
thereof, of similar misconduct by the
student in the future." Lee was
suspended for his role in the disrup
tion of an interview at the Placement
Center on November 4, 1971.
Charges against a fourth defendant,
Gerry Foote, were dropped recently at
Ramsey's recommendation. Ramsey
said that the University prosecutor,
Special Assistant to the President John
Schwartz, had not proved his case
against Foote beyond a reasonable
doubt.
New Charges
Also released over the weekend
were the names of ten students
charged by the Administration with
violation of both the Policy on
Campus Disruption and the Funda
mental Standard for interrupting the
Spring Quarter meeting of the Aca
demic Council on March 31.
The ten are: Helen Chauncey, a
graduate in East Asian Regional
Studies; Steve Downey, a sophomore
under three-quarter suspension; Betsy
Elich, a graduate in German Studies;
Ho, a sophomore in Economics; Peter
Knutson, a sophomore also under
three-quarter suspension;
Lee, a senior also under three
quarter suspension; Paul Loeb, a
sophomore under three-quarter sus
pension; Leslie Rabine, a terminal
graduate in French; Rosie Wolf, a
freshman in Music; and Don Zweig, a
sophomore.

28." Clark is an Assistant Psychology
Professor here.
However, Ramsey said "no reason
has been given, nor has it been
indicated, why the demand for a
debate could not have been presented
during his [Shockley's] office hours or
by mailing such a demand to his
campus address."
Sanctions
Ramsey found that "while the
evidence tendered by the University
only proves minimal participation" by
Lee and Ho "beyond a reasonable
doubt, such should more properly be
considered on the issue of sanction
rather than the issue of the violation
of the policy against disruption."
It is up to the full CJP to decide
upon the penalty against the three.
Lee's and Ho's penalty may be heavier
than Furumoto's since CJP Procedures
require the Panel to "take into
account prior violations of University

regulations and the likelihood, or lack
thereof, of similar misconduct by the
student in the future." Lee was
suspended for his role in the disrup
tion of an interview at the Placement
Center on November 4, 1971.
Charges against a fourth defendant,
Gerry Foote, were dropped recently at
Ramsey's recommendation. Ramsey
said that the University prosecutor,
Special Assistant to the President John
Schwartz, had not proved his case
against Foote beyond a reasonable
doubt.
New Charges
Also released over the weekend
were the names of ten students
charged by the Administration with
violation of both the Policy on
Campus Disruption and the Funda
mental Standard for interrupting the
Spring Quarter meeting of the Aca
demic Council on March 31.
The ten are: Helen Chauncey, a
graduate in East Asian Regional
Studies; Steve Downey, a sophomore
under three-quarter suspension; Betsy
Elich, a graduate in German Studies;
Ho, a sophomore in Economics; Peter
Knutson, a sophomore also under
three-quarter suspension;
Lee, a senior also under three
quarter suspension; Paul Loeb, a
sophomore under three-quarter sus
pension; Leslie Rabine, a terminal
graduate in French; Rosie Wolf, a
freshman in Music; and Don Zweig, a
sophomore.
Hearing Officer Henry Ramsey, Jr.,
Law Professor at Boalt Hall (UC
Berkeley), recommended Sunday that
three students be found guilty by the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) of violat
ing the Policy on Campus Disruption.
The three, Don Lee, Alice Furu
moto and Kwonping Ho, were charged
with having "prevented and disrupted
the effective carrying out of an
examination being taken by the
members" of an electrical engineering

class taught by Professor William
Shockley. The class interruption took
place Jan. 18. It was the first of three
such interruptions by persons protest
ing against Shockley's theories on race
and intelligence.
The 18th of Ramsey's 72 findings
of fact in the case, however, states that
"the sole purpose of the intruders in
entering" the class "was to (1)
condemn Shockley's views on eugenics
and dysgenics as a prologue to (2) a
demand that Shockley debate Cedric
Clark in a public debate by February
28." Clark is an Assistant Psychology
