# Burke, Hocker Slates Debate
## 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
In a debate broadcast over KZSU
last night, both slates running for
ASSU president pledged to serve the
interests of the student body—Burke-
Wong-Appel-Van Petten by making the
ASSU stronger, Hocker-Fried man by
abolishing it.
In their opening statement, read by
Scott Burke, the Burke-Wong slate
blasted their opponents for what was
termed "the absolute denial of student
interests. To say that student Interests
do not exist, and that students should
not be represented is simplistic non
sense!
"We are going to work hard at
finding out which issues do have a
broad interest, such as the problems of
women and minorities, and we plan to
form task forces, and utilize the
resources of the ASSU to solve
problems whenever possible."
Chris Hocker made the opening
statement for himself and Robin
Friedman in which he stressed that a
compulsory ASSU was both illegiti
mate, and unnecessary. Hocker said,
"The race for ASSU president tends to
appear insignificant in comparison to
the issues which face us today. But
this is because ASSU itself is a waste
of time . . . over half the student body
poohs on ASSU every year (by not
voting in the elections).
'Dishonest'
"It is dishonest for the Burke slate
to say they represent the views of the
student body. We only represent our
own views, and if we are elected we
intend to shut up and begin putting an
end to ASSU."
Much of the debate was in the form
of questions asked by KZSU's Pete
Williams, and Daily reporter Larry
Liebert. Much of the questioning was
over the difficulties of not only
making student government work, but,

also, in the case of the Hocker-
Friedman ticket, the problems in
volved in putting an end to it.
Burke said he felt that the ASSU
and the student Senate really had only
a "pseudo-legitimacy," but he felt that
what legitimacy they did have could
be used to help students in bargaining
with the Administration, and investi
gations of student services.
Private Club
"The idea of a voluntary ASSU is
not so bad," said Burke, "but it might
just turn into a private club for
politicians .. . There are problems
with the banking and auditing services
performed by the ASSU which simply
cannot be abolished right away due to
problems with federal tax questions."
Friedman said that the ASSU could
be done away with in spite of the
difficulties. "You've got the resources,
the people and the office to get it
worked out and out of the way once
and for all. It can be done."
"What we are saying is that those
students who favor bureaucracies
should take advantage of them, but
people who do not want any part of
them should not have to pay for
them," said Hocker. He also said that
if elected, the first thing he would do
was to talk to the financial manager to
see where the ASSU's money is being
spent, and to find ways in which some
of the expenditures could be limited.
Some of this money could be returned
to the University, Hocker said.
Refunds
"It was pointed out," said Hocker,
"that it would be grossly unfair to
accept the salary paid to the ASSU
president. If we are elected, our salary
is hereby refundable." This would
come to 17 cents per student,
according to Hocker.
The Burke slate said that they saw
their role as a "countervailing force to

the administration and conservative
faculty." Appel said, "We feel that the
quality of education at Stanford is a
legitimate student interest.
"There is a lot of opposition to
mandatory course reviews by the
conservative faculty, for instance."
Both slates criticized the present
ASSU council for using the resources
of the ASSU, such as office space, for
issues which did not involve Stanford
students directly.
Projects
Burke said he did not agree with
the Council's use of ASSU resources
for projects like getting McGovem
elected, or Angela Davis freed.
"I think that you have to concen
trate on things that are happening on
campus," he said.
Said Hocker, "We are running,
quite honestly, partly out of ego, but
we also feel that the evils of ASSU can
only be corrected if we are elected.
"We intend to revolutionize student
government."

to say they represent the views of the
student body. We only represent our
own views, and if we are elected we
intend to shut up and begin putting an
end to ASSU."
Much of the debate was in the form
of questions asked by KZSU's Pete
Williams, and Daily reporter Larry
Liebert. Much of the questioning was
over the difficulties of not only
making student government work, but,

also, in the case of the Hocker-
Friedman ticket, the problems in
volved in putting an end to it.
Burke said he felt that the ASSU
and the student Senate really had only
a "pseudo-legitimacy," but he felt that
what legitimacy they did have could
be used to help students in bargaining
with the Administration, and investi
gations of student services.
Private Club
"The idea of a voluntary ASSU is
not so bad," said Burke, "but it might
just turn into a private club for
politicians .. . There are problems
with the banking and auditing services
performed by the ASSU which simply
cannot be abolished right away due to
problems with federal tax questions."
Friedman said that the ASSU could
be done away with in spite of the
difficulties. "You've got the resources,
the people and the office to get it
worked out and out of the way once
and for all. It can be done."
"What we are saying is that those
students who favor bureaucracies
should take advantage of them, but
people who do not want any part of
them should not have to pay for
them," said Hocker. He also said that
if elected, the first thing he would do
was to talk to the financial manager to
see where the ASSU's money is being
spent, and to find ways in which some
of the expenditures could be limited.
Some of this money could be returned
to the University, Hocker said.
Refunds
"It was pointed out," said Hocker,
"that it would be grossly unfair to
accept the salary paid to the ASSU
president. If we are elected, our salary
is hereby refundable." This would
come to 17 cents per student,
according to Hocker.
The Burke slate said that they saw
their role as a "countervailing force to

the administration and conservative
faculty." Appel said, "We feel that the
quality of education at Stanford is a
legitimate student interest.
"There is a lot of opposition to
mandatory course reviews by the
conservative faculty, for instance."
Both slates criticized the present
ASSU council for using the resources
of the ASSU, such as office space, for
issues which did not involve Stanford
students directly.
Projects
Burke said he did not agree with
the Council's use of ASSU resources
for projects like getting McGovem
elected, or Angela Davis freed.
"I think that you have to concen
trate on things that are happening on
campus," he said.
Said Hocker, "We are running,
quite honestly, partly out of ego, but
we also feel that the evils of ASSU can
only be corrected if we are elected.
"We intend to revolutionize student
government."
In a debate broadcast over KZSU
last night, both slates running for
ASSU president pledged to serve the
interests of the student body—Burke-
Wong-Appel-Van Petten by making the
ASSU stronger, Hocker-Fried man by
abolishing it.
In their opening statement, read by
Scott Burke, the Burke-Wong slate
blasted their opponents for what was
termed "the absolute denial of student
interests. To say that student Interests
do not exist, and that students should
not be represented is simplistic non
sense!
"We are going to work hard at
finding out which issues do have a
broad interest, such as the problems of
women and minorities, and we plan to
form task forces, and utilize the
resources of the ASSU to solve
problems whenever possible."
Chris Hocker made the opening
statement for himself and Robin
Friedman in which he stressed that a
compulsory ASSU was both illegiti
mate, and unnecessary. Hocker said,
"The race for ASSU president tends to
appear insignificant in comparison to
the issues which face us today. But
this is because ASSU itself is a waste
of time . . . over half the student body
poohs on ASSU every year (by not
voting in the elections).
