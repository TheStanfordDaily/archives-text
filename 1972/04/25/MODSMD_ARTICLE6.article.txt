## Lyman Discusses Friday Events 
### 
Richard lyman

Last Tuesday, in our KZSU
press conference, I was recalling
how easily the issue of the war
can get forgotten, if the issue of
the nature of the protest against
the war becomes paramount.
Instead of people around the
country asking themselves why,
after all these years, we are once
again raining death and
destruction on Southeast Asia,
they are asking themselves why
students (and non-students) throw
rocks at police. And people on
campus are embroiled in
arguments over whether and how
and in what instances the police
behaved unfairly to
demonstrators.
That's pretty much what we've
got to show for the events of last
Friday.
The ironies in the situation are
many. I want to stess just two
points.

First, for a good many years
now a lot of people have been
working to eliminate the in loco
parentis role of the University —
in a social sense by abolition of
dormitory rules, in an academic
sense by loosening curricular
requirements, and in a political
sense encouraging political
involvement by lowering the
voting age to 18. More and more
college students are being
recognized as adults.
But I wonder if it isn't time to
face a few facts of life about the
responsibilities involved in all of
this. Adulthood has its price.
Adults do not have a warm,
protective mother-institution to
go to bat for them when they get
in trouble by breaking the law.
Adults are responsible for their
actions, and do not get the
privilege, once enjoyed by
students here and elsewhere, of

being turned over to the college
authorities when they got
arrested. The police and the
courts used to step aside
obligingly, in all but the most
serious cases such as attempted
murder, and they used to be
pleased to leave the matter in the
hands of that great surrogate
mother, the University.
This isn't true any longer, and
it will not and cannot be true as
long as 18-year olds are treated in
other respects as adults. Even if it
wished to do so, the University
could not intervene and restore
the ancient customs, on behalf of
and in protection of those who
carry their protest to the point of
breaking the law.
Police
A good many people seem still
unaware of the fact that Stanford
does not control the police. This
is surprising, considering how
often we've been asked about this
and how totally consistent have
been our replies. But apparently
there are still many who believe
that some University officer can
direct the police to charge or not
to charge, to make arrests or to
refrain from making arrests, to use
their clubs or not to use their
clubs, and so forth. In fact, if they
have cause to anticipate that the
law will be broken, they can come
on campus without invitation.
Once they are here, we cannot
direct their tactics.
When we point out that the
police are under the authority of
the Sheriff of Santa Clara County,
an elected official, and further
that they are legally bound not to
overlook breaches of the law that

they see taking place or have
strong reason to believe are about
to take place — when all this is
made clear, then there are many
who conclude that police ought to
be kept off the campus at all
costs, that they ought not to be
called upon to keep the University
open, or to protect the rights of
individuals within the University
who don't want to do what the
protesters want them to do.
Bargain Away Rights
It is always tempting to argue
that cutting off the rights of those
who want to get to work or go to
class is less important in the short
run than keeping the police out.
That isn't the way the people feel
whose rights it is proposed to
bargain away. And once one starts
down that path of reasoning,
where does one stop?
By all the evidence available, a
vast majority of people at
Stanford last Friday did not think
that, by leaving their jobs or their
classes, they could exercise an
effective influence on the
stopping of the bombing in North
Viet Nam. Can anyone seriously
question the fact that there are
many, many more people at
Stanford who are thoroughly fed
up with the war, and disgusted by
its recent escalation, than turned
out for any of Friday's activities?
Why was the protest not aimed at
demonstrating those larger
number?
Why, instead, did it obscure
that vital fact, the fact of massive
opposition to President Nixon's
moves in Southeast Asia, by
seeking to divide the Stanford
community between those who

wanted to keep the University
functioning and those who
wanted it to close? And not only
wanted it to close, but were
willing to attempt that closing by
physical force? Can it be that
there are some for whom police
confrontations, not effective work
for peace, are the real objectives?
Stopping Traffic
Stopping the traffic on El
Camino has one, and only one,
certain consequence: the people
who choose to do that are
going to encounter law
enforcement quickly. They run
serious risks of arrest, as scores of
people discovered on Friday.
Did stopping the traffic have
any constructive influence on the
course of American politics? I
should think none whatever —
unless it was to annoy whatever
motorists chanced to be
obstructed by the protest.
What makes this so particularly
poignant, and worth talking
about, is that for the next six and
a half weeks, there is an
opportunity to work politically
that comes only too rarely.
Working hard on the California
primary election — not just on
June 6th, but between now and
then — may not be especially
exciting or glamorous. But it
seems to me the one
overwhelmingly obvious and
constructive response to what is
happening in the world. I would
challenge those who want to
desperately to "do something" to
try it.

long as 18-year olds are treated in
other respects as adults. Even if it
wished to do so, the University
could not intervene and restore
the ancient customs, on behalf of
and in protection of those who
carry their protest to the point of
breaking the law.
Police
A good many people seem still
unaware of the fact that Stanford
does not control the police. This
is surprising, considering how
often we've been asked about this
and how totally consistent have
been our replies. But apparently
there are still many who believe
that some University officer can
direct the police to charge or not
to charge, to make arrests or to
refrain from making arrests, to use
their clubs or not to use their
clubs, and so forth. In fact, if they
have cause to anticipate that the
law will be broken, they can come
on campus without invitation.
Once they are here, we cannot
direct their tactics.
When we point out that the
police are under the authority of
the Sheriff of Santa Clara County,
an elected official, and further
that they are legally bound not to
overlook breaches of the law that

they see taking place or have
strong reason to believe are about
to take place — when all this is
made clear, then there are many
who conclude that police ought to
be kept off the campus at all
costs, that they ought not to be
called upon to keep the University
open, or to protect the rights of
individuals within the University
who don't want to do what the
protesters want them to do.
Bargain Away Rights
It is always tempting to argue
that cutting off the rights of those
who want to get to work or go to
class is less important in the short
run than keeping the police out.
That isn't the way the people feel
whose rights it is proposed to
bargain away. And once one starts
down that path of reasoning,
where does one stop?
By all the evidence available, a
vast majority of people at
Stanford last Friday did not think
that, by leaving their jobs or their
classes, they could exercise an
effective influence on the
stopping of the bombing in North
Viet Nam. Can anyone seriously
question the fact that there are
many, many more people at
Stanford who are thoroughly fed
up with the war, and disgusted by
its recent escalation, than turned
out for any of Friday's activities?
Why was the protest not aimed at
demonstrating those larger
number?
Why, instead, did it obscure
that vital fact, the fact of massive
opposition to President Nixon's
moves in Southeast Asia, by
seeking to divide the Stanford
community between those who

wanted to keep the University
functioning and those who
wanted it to close? And not only
wanted it to close, but were
willing to attempt that closing by
physical force? Can it be that
there are some for whom police
confrontations, not effective work
for peace, are the real objectives?
Stopping Traffic
Stopping the traffic on El
Camino has one, and only one,
certain consequence: the people
who choose to do that are
going to encounter law
enforcement quickly. They run
serious risks of arrest, as scores of
people discovered on Friday.
Did stopping the traffic have
any constructive influence on the
course of American politics? I
should think none whatever —
unless it was to annoy whatever
motorists chanced to be
obstructed by the protest.
What makes this so particularly
poignant, and worth talking
about, is that for the next six and
a half weeks, there is an
opportunity to work politically
that comes only too rarely.
Working hard on the California
primary election — not just on
June 6th, but between now and
then — may not be especially
exciting or glamorous. But it
seems to me the one
overwhelmingly obvious and
constructive response to what is
happening in the world. I would
challenge those who want to
desperately to "do something" to
try it.

The Agony and the Ecstacy
Richard lyman

Last Tuesday, in our KZSU
press conference, I was recalling
how easily the issue of the war
can get forgotten, if the issue of
the nature of the protest against
the war becomes paramount.
Instead of people around the
country asking themselves why,
after all these years, we are once
again raining death and
destruction on Southeast Asia,
they are asking themselves why
students (and non-students) throw
rocks at police. And people on
campus are embroiled in
arguments over whether and how
and in what instances the police
behaved unfairly to
demonstrators.
That's pretty much what we've
got to show for the events of last
Friday.
The ironies in the situation are
many. I want to stess just two
points.

First, for a good many years
now a lot of people have been
working to eliminate the in loco
parentis role of the University —
in a social sense by abolition of
dormitory rules, in an academic
sense by loosening curricular
requirements, and in a political
sense encouraging political
involvement by lowering the
voting age to 18. More and more
college students are being
recognized as adults.
But I wonder if it isn't time to
face a few facts of life about the
responsibilities involved in all of
this. Adulthood has its price.
Adults do not have a warm,
protective mother-institution to
go to bat for them when they get
in trouble by breaking the law.
Adults are responsible for their
actions, and do not get the
privilege, once enjoyed by
students here and elsewhere, of

being turned over to the college
authorities when they got
arrested. The police and the
courts used to step aside
obligingly, in all but the most
serious cases such as attempted
murder, and they used to be
pleased to leave the matter in the
hands of that great surrogate
mother, the University.
This isn't true any longer, and
it will not and cannot be true as
long as 18-year olds are treated in
other respects as adults. Even if it
wished to do so, the University
could not intervene and restore
the ancient customs, on behalf of

that, by leaving their jobs or their
classes, they could exercise an
effective influence on the
stopping of the bombing in North
Viet Nam. Can anyone seriously
question the fact that there are
many, many more people at
Stanford who are thoroughly fed
up with the war, and disgusted by
its recent escalation, than turned
out for any of Friday's activities?
Why was the protest not aimed at
demonstrating those larger
number?
Why, instead, did it obscure
that vital fact, the fact of massive
opposition to President Nixon's
moves in Southeast Asia, by
seeking to divide the Stanford
community between those who

wanted to keep the University
functioning and those who
wanted it to close? And not only
wanted it to close, but were
willing to attempt that closing by
physical force? Can it be that
there are some for whom police
confrontations, not effective work
for peace, are the real objectives?
Stopping Traffic
Stopping the traffic on El
Camino has one, and only one,
certain consequence: the people
who choose to do that are
going to encounter law
enforcement quickly. They run
serious risks of arrest, as scores of
people discovered on Friday.
Did stopping the traffic have
any constructive influence on the
course of American politics? I
should think none whatever —
unless it was to annoy whatever
motorists chanced to be
obstructed by the protest.
What makes this so particularly
poignant, and worth talking
about, is that for the next six and
a half weeks, there is an
opportunity to work politically
that comes only too rarely.
Working hard on the California
primary election — not just on
June 6th, but between now and
then — may not be especially
exciting or glamorous. But it
seems to me the one
overwhelmingly obvious and
constructive response to what is
happening in the world. I would
challenge those who want to
desperately to "do something" to
try it.

The Agony and the Ecstacy
Richard lyman

Last Tuesday, in our KZSU
press conference, I was recalling
how easily the issue of the war
can get forgotten, if the issue of
the nature of the protest against
the war becomes paramount.
Instead of people around the
country asking themselves why,
after all these years, we are once
again raining death and
destruction on Southeast Asia,
they are asking themselves why
students (and non-students) throw
rocks at police. And people on
campus are embroiled in
arguments over whether and how
and in what instances the police
behaved unfairly to
demonstrators.
That's pretty much what we've
got to show for the events of last
Friday.
The ironies in the situation are
many. I want to stess just two
points.

First, for a good many years
now a lot of people have been
working to eliminate the in loco
parentis role of the University —
in a social sense by abolition of
dormitory rules, in an academic
sense by loosening curricular
requirements, and in a political
sense encouraging political
involvement by lowering the
voting age to 18. More and more
college students are being
recognized as adults.
But I wonder if it isn't time to
face a few facts of life about the
responsibilities involved in all of
this. Adulthood has its price.
Adults do not have a warm,
protective mother-institution to
go to bat for them when they get
in trouble by breaking the law.
Adults are responsible for their
actions, and do not get the
privilege, once enjoyed by
students here and elsewhere, of

being turned over to the college
authorities when they got
arrested. The police and the
courts used to step aside
obligingly, in all but the most
serious cases such as attempted
murder, and they used to be
pleased to leave the matter in the
hands of that great surrogate
mother, the University.
This isn't true any longer, and
it will not and cannot be true as
long as 18-year olds are treated in
other respects as adults. Even if it
wished to do so, the University
could not intervene and restore
the ancient customs, on behalf of
and in protection of those who
carry their protest to the point of
breaking the law.
Police
A good many people seem still
unaware of the fact that Stanford
does not control the police. This
is surprising, considering how
often we've been asked about this
and how totally consistent have
been our replies. But apparently
there are still many who believe
that some University officer can
direct the police to charge or not
to charge, to make arrests or to
refrain from making arrests, to use
their clubs or not to use their
clubs, and so forth. In fact, if they
have cause to anticipate that the
law will be broken, they can come
on campus without invitation.
Once they are here, we cannot
direct their tactics.
When we point out that the
police are under the authority of
the Sheriff of Santa Clara County,
an elected official, and further
that they are legally bound not to
overlook breaches of the law that

they see taking place or have
strong reason to believe are about
to take place — when all this is
made clear, then there are many
who conclude that police ought to
be kept off the campus at all
costs, that they ought not to be
called upon to keep the University
open, or to protect the rights of
individuals within the University
who don't want to do what the
protesters want them to do.
Bargain Away Rights
It is always tempting to argue
that cutting off the rights of those
who want to get to work or go to
class is less important in the short
run than keeping the police out.
That isn't the way the people feel
whose rights it is proposed to
bargain away. And once one starts
down that path of reasoning,
where does one stop?
By all the evidence available, a
vast majority of people at
Stanford last Friday did not think
that, by leaving their jobs or their
classes, they could exercise an
effective influence on the
stopping of the bombing in North
Viet Nam. Can anyone seriously
question the fact that there are
many, many more people at
Stanford who are thoroughly fed

its recent escalation, than turned
