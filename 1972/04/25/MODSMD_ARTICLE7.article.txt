## Exclude War Recruiters 
### 
®babcock et. al.

(Editor's note: This letter was
sent to President Richard
Lyman.) We are writing in
response to a letter by Ralph W.
Keller, your director of career
planning and placement.
Mr. Keller asks not the opinion
of his "friends" on the subject of
"open recruiting" but, in panic at
the apparent student unanimity
on this question, and believing
firmly, no doubt, in democracy,
he solicits instead letters that
support his own view in order
that, in his words, we may "save
the day."
If the choice is between no
recruiting on campus and
recruiting tht freely permits war

contractors or the military to
hussle on campus, clearly
Stanford must opt for no
recruiting.
Mr. Keller maintains that
"every student has the right to
decide for himself with whom he
will discuss employment." Of
course one can't stop a person
from perfecting gas ovens to kill
Jews — if he or she insists on
doing so. One can't stop a person
from perfecting bombs that look
like leaves and are dropped on
villages so as to explode when a
child steps on them. One can't
stop a person from perfecting
radar equipment so that a man in
air-conditioned cockpit may rain

more destruction on an unseen
fellow of his than any of us can
imagine.
But, if people insist on
behaving in this way, surely our
task is to discourage them. Surely
our task is not to say them. What
you propose to do is normal and
routine, and we'll make an
appointment for you on Friday at
four in one of our own offices.
Somehow Mr. Keller has come
to believe that if we don't make
way for people to sign up for the
death factory right there in the
room next to his, we're violating
basic human rights. He seems to
have arrived at the uncanny
position that the important thing,

the primary thing, is that people
who wish to kill others, or wish to
help to kill others by means of
technology, should not be
interfered with. We can't imagine
why, given these views, the man
has chosen to work in a
university.
Center Can't Survive
Mr. Keller concludes on an
ominous note: the placement
center, he says, can't survive if
men and women who make little
pellets that explode under the
skin and stick inside like burrs are
not allowed unimpeded access to
Stanford grounds and buildings.
Now here at the University of
Massachusetts in Boston, you will
be interested to learn the director
of career planning and placement,
speaking to the University Senate
on this very subject, said that
on-campus recruiting was such a
minimal part of the job that his
office performed that it would
make no difference if all such
recruiting were stopped. And this
is the position our Senate has
adopted. If here, where the
student body is not so sought
after as at Stanford, career
planning and placement can be
conducted without on-campus
recruiting, why is this not also the
case at Stanford?
The issue of recruiting is one of
many issues that the
administration of the US
international empire have raised
for the nation's universities. The
question is political and direct,
and we should respond directly:
by closing our doors to the
military and to war contractors.

support his own view in order
that, in his words, we may "save
the day."
If the choice is between no
recruiting on campus and
recruiting tht freely permits war

contractors or the military to
hussle on campus, clearly
Stanford must opt for no
recruiting.
Mr. Keller maintains that
"every student has the right to
decide for himself with whom he
will discuss employment." Of
course one can't stop a person
from perfecting gas ovens to kill
Jews — if he or she insists on
doing so. One can't stop a person
from perfecting bombs that look
like leaves and are dropped on
villages so as to explode when a
child steps on them. One can't
stop a person from perfecting
radar equipment so that a man in
air-conditioned cockpit may rain

more destruction on an unseen
fellow of his than any of us can
imagine.
But, if people insist on
behaving in this way, surely our
task is to discourage them. Surely
our task is not to say them. What
you propose to do is normal and
routine, and we'll make an
appointment for you on Friday at
four in one of our own offices.
Somehow Mr. Keller has come
to believe that if we don't make
way for people to sign up for the
death factory right there in the
room next to his, we're violating
basic human rights. He seems to
have arrived at the uncanny
position that the important thing,

the primary thing, is that people
who wish to kill others, or wish to
help to kill others by means of
technology, should not be
interfered with. We can't imagine
why, given these views, the man
has chosen to work in a
university.
Center Can't Survive
Mr. Keller concludes on an
ominous note: the placement
center, he says, can't survive if
men and women who make little
pellets that explode under the
skin and stick inside like burrs are
not allowed unimpeded access to
Stanford grounds and buildings.
Now here at the University of
Massachusetts in Boston, you will
be interested to learn the director
of career planning and placement,
speaking to the University Senate
on this very subject, said that
on-campus recruiting was such a
minimal part of the job that his
office performed that it would
make no difference if all such
recruiting were stopped. And this
is the position our Senate has
adopted. If here, where the
student body is not so sought
after as at Stanford, career
planning and placement can be
conducted without on-campus
recruiting, why is this not also the
case at Stanford?
The issue of recruiting is one of
many issues that the
administration of the US
international empire have raised
for the nation's universities. The
question is political and direct,
and we should respond directly:
by closing our doors to the
military and to war contractors.

Mr. Keller asks not the opinion
of his "friends" on the subject of
"open recruiting" but, in panic at
the apparent student unanimity
on this question, and believing
firmly, no doubt, in democracy,
he solicits instead letters that
support his own view in order
that, in his words, we may "save
the day."
