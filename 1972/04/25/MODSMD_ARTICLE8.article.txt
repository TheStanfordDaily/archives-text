## Overseas Finances

(Editor's Note: This letter was
sent to Dr. Robert Walker,
Director of Overseas Campuses.)
Each week students here at the
campus in Tours are requested to
indicate in writing which meals
they will be present for, as many
students are away from the
campus part of the week
(travelling, etc.). We have been
told that this head count is taken
each week because the food
service works with a budget
geared toward lower counts due
to student travel. Prior to coming
overseas, however, every student
was required to pay for a board
plan which, presumably, would
cover every meal, every day of the
week.
Every student has paid for
every meal, yet the food service
seeks to prepare meals for a
fraction of the entire group.
Travel Encouraged
And undeniably, the Stanford
Overseas Program encourages
student travel — the four-day
class-week allows longer weekends
for students to get away, and the
organized field trips require that
students travel. If this worthy
policy is to be continued, it seems
only fair that the overseas campus
board plans reflect an expectation
that students will be away from
campus at least part of the time.
The room & board fees which
we were assessed are comparable
to — in fact, a bit higher than —

the fees at the home campus.
At the same time, we have
been told that living expenses,
particularly for food, are cheaper
in France. We also understand
that the French government owns
the building which houses the
French campus, and finances part
of the room & board fee here. In
light of these things the fees here
seem a bit mysterious to us.
We realize that the overseas
program is under severe financial
strain, and has a number of
economic problems to deal with.
We also realize that there are
several special expenses which our
fees cover — the carter flight to
Europe, maid and maintenance
fees at the campus, field trip
expenses, and so on. Yet the
precise cost distribution and
allocation of our money toward
these things has never been
revealed to us. Instead, we are
assessed one large, unexplained

lump sum. It is rather like buying
a bag of groceries without
examining its contents.
Two Proposals
As a result of these concerns
we wish to make two proposals:
1) That alternatives to the
present board plan be made
available to students at the
overseas campuses:
a) that several board plans be
established, allowing each
student to pay only for the
meals he intends to eat, or
b) that a sufficient rebate be
given to students for meals not
eaten on campus
2) that a detailed, itemized
breakdown of the room & board
bill for students at the overseas
campuses be published and mailed
to those students.
