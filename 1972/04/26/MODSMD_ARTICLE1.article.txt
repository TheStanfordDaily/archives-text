# McGovern, Humphrey Score Important Victories
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Sens. George McGovern and Hubert
Humphrey scored important victories
in separate presidential primaries yes
terday.
McGovern, following up his Wiscon
sin triumph of three weeks ago,
defeated Sen. Edmund Muskie by a
better than 2-1 margin.
And Humphrey won the first
primary of his political career by
outdistancing a large field in Pennsyl
vania.
In the all-important delegate count,
the Associated Press reported last
night that McGovern was on his way
to sweeping all 102 votes at the
Democratic National Convention from
Massachusetts.
In Pennsylvania, however, the race
appeared much tighter, with Humph
rey leading for 51 delegates, Muskie
for 36, McGovern for 29, Wallace for
2, and the rest either uncommitted or
undecided.

In the Massachusetts popular vote,
with 28 percent of the 1964 precincts
reporting, McGovern was scoring a
lopsided victory over New Englander
Muskie, taking 68,833 (48 percent) to
30,003 (21 percent). Alabama Gov.
George Wallace had 10 percent, while
Humphrey had 8 percent.
With 73 percent of the Pennsyl
vania popular vote tallied, Humphrey
had 336,046 (35 percent), McGovern
205,784 (22 percent), Muskie 202,828
(21 percent), and Wallace 188,820 (19
percent).
It was a bad day all the way around
for Muskie, who concentrated most of
his campaigning in Pennsylvania
against his 1968 running mate,
Humphrey. McGovern, who hardly
campaigned at all in the Keystone
State, appeared to be leading the
Maine senator in a nip-and-tuck battle
for second place.
There was no Pennsylvania Republi
can Primary. In Massachusetts, how

ever, President Nixon was winning
easily with 80 percent, as opposed to
Rep. Paul McCloskey's 14 percent and
Rep. John Ashbrook's 6 percent.
Muskie Still Confident
Speaking last night, Muskie said he
still expected to capture the Demo
cratic nomination at the Miami Beach
convention in July, despite his recent
election set-backs. He said that "when
the going gets tough, the tough get
going," and added that he expected to
"get going."
Muskie had the backing of Pennsyl
vania Gov. Milton Shapp and most of
the state political organization, but it
wasn't enough to win in what had
been billed as the first major head-to
head battle between he and Humph
rey.
Humphrey drew most of his
strength from organized labor and
from the heavily black wards of larger
cities such as Philadelphia.
In Massachusetts, McGovern manag
ed to dramatically reverse polls taken
early in the campaign that gave Muskie
a commanding lead. A poll released
Sunday by the Boston Globe predicted
that McGovern would win 43 percent
to Muskie's 19.
Pennsylvania marked Humphrey's
first primary victory in three tries for
the presidency. In 1960, John Ken
nedy knocked him out of the race
early in the campaign, while in 1968
he entered the race too late for most

of the primaries.
With Pennsylvania and Massachu
setts out of the way, attention shifts
to next Tuesday's Ohio primary,
which threatens to become a free-for
all among Muskie, McGovern, Humph
rey and Wallace.
Ohio Gov. John Gilligan endorsed
Muskie's campaign several months ago,
abandoning his own anticipated favor
ite son campaign in favor of what
looked like a sure thing. Now with the
possibility of major efforts from three
others, Muskie looks like anything but
a sure thing to capture that state's
sizable delegation.
Humphrey and McGovern both
claimed last night that they were the
only two viable candidates left in the
race for the Democratic nomination,
claiming that Muskie set-backs in
Florida, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and
Massachusetts had knocked him out of
the front ranks.
Muskie, meanwhile, claimed that
his campaign had "turned a corner"
with last night's results.
Wallace, who scarcely campaigned
in either Massachusetts or Pennsyl
vania, was elated with his showing in
both races. He said the results show
that "we are going to win in Indiana."
He finished ahead of Humphrey in
Massachusetts, and appeared to have
come very close to both Muskie and
McGovern in Pennsylvania.

night that McGovern was on his way
to sweeping all 102 votes at the
Democratic National Convention from
Massachusetts.
In Pennsylvania, however, the race
appeared much tighter, with Humph
rey leading for 51 delegates, Muskie
for 36, McGovern for 29, Wallace for
2, and the rest either uncommitted or
undecided.

In the Massachusetts popular vote,
with 28 percent of the 1964 precincts
reporting, McGovern was scoring a
lopsided victory over New Englander
Muskie, taking 68,833 (48 percent) to
30,003 (21 percent). Alabama Gov.
George Wallace had 10 percent, while
Humphrey had 8 percent.
With 73 percent of the Pennsyl
vania popular vote tallied, Humphrey
had 336,046 (35 percent), McGovern
205,784 (22 percent), Muskie 202,828
(21 percent), and Wallace 188,820 (19
percent).
It was a bad day all the way around
for Muskie, who concentrated most of
his campaigning in Pennsylvania
against his 1968 running mate,
Humphrey. McGovern, who hardly
campaigned at all in the Keystone
State, appeared to be leading the
Maine senator in a nip-and-tuck battle
for second place.
There was no Pennsylvania Republi
can Primary. In Massachusetts, how

ever, President Nixon was winning
easily with 80 percent, as opposed to
Rep. Paul McCloskey's 14 percent and
Rep. John Ashbrook's 6 percent.
Muskie Still Confident
Speaking last night, Muskie said he
still expected to capture the Demo
cratic nomination at the Miami Beach
convention in July, despite his recent
election set-backs. He said that "when
the going gets tough, the tough get
going," and added that he expected to
"get going."
Muskie had the backing of Pennsyl
vania Gov. Milton Shapp and most of
the state political organization, but it
wasn't enough to win in what had
been billed as the first major head-to
head battle between he and Humph
rey.
Humphrey drew most of his
strength from organized labor and
from the heavily black wards of larger
cities such as Philadelphia.
In Massachusetts, McGovern manag
ed to dramatically reverse polls taken
early in the campaign that gave Muskie
a commanding lead. A poll released
Sunday by the Boston Globe predicted
that McGovern would win 43 percent
to Muskie's 19.
Pennsylvania marked Humphrey's
first primary victory in three tries for
the presidency. In 1960, John Ken
nedy knocked him out of the race
early in the campaign, while in 1968
he entered the race too late for most

of the primaries.
With Pennsylvania and Massachu
setts out of the way, attention shifts
to next Tuesday's Ohio primary,
which threatens to become a free-for
all among Muskie, McGovern, Humph
rey and Wallace.
Ohio Gov. John Gilligan endorsed
Muskie's campaign several months ago,
abandoning his own anticipated favor
ite son campaign in favor of what
looked like a sure thing. Now with the
possibility of major efforts from three
others, Muskie looks like anything but
a sure thing to capture that state's
sizable delegation.
Humphrey and McGovern both
claimed last night that they were the
only two viable candidates left in the
race for the Democratic nomination,
claiming that Muskie set-backs in
Florida, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and
Massachusetts had knocked him out of
the front ranks.
Muskie, meanwhile, claimed that
his campaign had "turned a corner"
with last night's results.
Wallace, who scarcely campaigned
in either Massachusetts or Pennsyl
vania, was elated with his showing in
both races. He said the results show
that "we are going to win in Indiana."
He finished ahead of Humphrey in
Massachusetts, and appeared to have
come very close to both Muskie and
McGovern in Pennsylvania.
Sens. George McGovern and Hubert
Humphrey scored important victories
in separate presidential primaries yes
terday.
McGovern, following up his Wiscon
sin triumph of three weeks ago,
defeated Sen. Edmund Muskie by a
better than 2-1 margin.
And Humphrey won the first
primary of his political career by
outdistancing a large field in Pennsyl
vania.
In the all-important delegate count,
the Associated Press reported last
night that McGovern was on his way
to sweeping all 102 votes at the
