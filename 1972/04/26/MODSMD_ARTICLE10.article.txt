Finance Charge
Editor, THE DAILY:
I am a third year student at the
law school. Since July last I have
been a participant in the law
school's operational training
program in Washington, D.C. I
registered in absentia last fall.
The controller's office mailed
me a bill for $1309.00 for tuition
and student fees. I remitted a
check for $1305.00, in full
payment of my tuition. I refused,
however, to pay the $4.00 student
fee, because my absence from the
campus prevented me from
enjoying any of the student
services which the student fee
funds.
Soon after remittance of my
payment I received a statement
acknowledging receipt of my
payment. Some weeks later I
received another statement, which
indicated that I still owed $4.00,

as well as a $35.00 "finance
charge."
I contest my obligation to pay
the $4.00 student fee. But even if
I do owe the $4.00, I can hardly
conceive that I must pay an extra
$35.00 for being three months
late in paying $4.00. According to
my rough calculations, this
"finance charge" amounts to an
annual rate of interest of 3600
percent on my late account. I do
not see how Stanford in good
conscience could charge its
students this much interest.
I strongly suggest that Stanford
reassess its policy of charging
students late fees of this
magnitude. These fees may or
may not come under the strict
letter of California's usury statute,
but they certainly violate its
spirit.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Today and tomorrow, Stanford
students will be faced with an
important decision. They will be
asked to choose between two
slates running for the ASSU
executive. The choice is not, as
many students feel, for or against
the ASSU as an institution. It is
rather a choice which should be
based on priorities.
This year, we have tried to
streamline student government to
make it an effective force for
reform within the University. We
promised to secure a greater
student voice, which we did
through an Intern program. We
promised to get a bank in TMU;
that will be a reality in the Fall.
We promised to address ourselves
to the issues which most affect
students. We have tried to speak
out on those things which affect
students. We also attempted to
present different issues to the
students such as our debates on
the Franklin case. A course review
was also part of our program.
The question will be whether
the students wish to have such
efforts continued. It is our
opinion that Student Government
must remain a creative and
progressive force in the
University. Scott Burke, Elaine
Wong, Brent Appel, and Peter Van
Petten offer such an assurance.
Their opponents offer only
reactionary politics, and inaction.
To claim that their approach
would be apolitical is to succumb
to folly. Inaction in student
government is a vote of
confidence in the status quo. We
urge students to vote for progress
— vote Burke and Wong for ASSU
Council of Presidents.

slates running for the ASSU
executive. The choice is not, as
many students feel, for or against
the ASSU as an institution. It is
rather a choice which should be
based on priorities.
This year, we have tried to
streamline student government to
make it an effective force for
reform within the University. We
promised to secure a greater
student voice, which we did
through an Intern program. We
promised to get a bank in TMU;
that will be a reality in the Fall.
We promised to address ourselves
to the issues which most affect
students. We have tried to speak
out on those things which affect
students. We also attempted to
present different issues to the
students such as our debates on
the Franklin case. A course review
was also part of our program.
The question will be whether
the students wish to have such
efforts continued. It is our
opinion that Student Government
must remain a creative and
progressive force in the
University. Scott Burke, Elaine
Wong, Brent Appel, and Peter Van
Petten offer such an assurance.
Their opponents offer only
reactionary politics, and inaction.
To claim that their approach
would be apolitical is to succumb
to folly. Inaction in student
government is a vote of
confidence in the status quo. We
urge students to vote for progress
— vote Burke and Wong for ASSU
Council of Presidents.

I am a third year student at the
law school. Since July last I have
been a participant in the law
school's operational training
program in Washington, D.C. I
registered in absentia last fall.
The controller's office mailed
me a bill for $1309.00 for tuition
and student fees. I remitted a
check for $1305.00, in full
payment of my tuition. I refused,
however, to pay the $4.00 student
fee, because my absence from the
campus prevented me from
enjoying any of the student
services which the student fee
funds.
Soon after remittance of my
payment I received a statement
acknowledging receipt of my
payment. Some weeks later I
received another statement, which
indicated that I still owed $4.00,

as well as a $35.00 "finance
charge."
I contest my obligation to pay
the $4.00 student fee. But even if
I do owe the $4.00, I can hardly
conceive that I must pay an extra
$35.00 for being three months
late in paying $4.00. According to
my rough calculations, this
"finance charge" amounts to an
annual rate of interest of 3600
percent on my late account. I do
not see how Stanford in good
conscience could charge its
students this much interest.
I strongly suggest that Stanford
reassess its policy of charging
students late fees of this
magnitude. These fees may or
may not come under the strict
letter of California's usury statute,
but they certainly violate its
spirit.

Today and tomorrow, Stanford
students will be faced with an
important decision. They will be
asked to choose between two
slates running for the ASSU
executive. The choice is not, as
