# Assistant Dean Picked
## 
### 
B. Michael Closson, now a
Cornell research specialist
involved in a study of two-year
colleges in New York State, has
been appointed assistant dean of
undergraduate studies here.
In his new post, Closson will
provide administrative liaison and
guidance for the Student
Workshops on Political and Social
Issues (SWOPSI), the Urban
Studies Program, and the Student
Center for Innovation and
Research in Education (SCIRE).
He will also work with the
undergraduate special program,
which offers extradepartment
courses, and the program of
individually designed
interdepartmental majors.
Closson, who will take up his
new duties on Aug. 1, assumes the

post formerly held by Alberta
Siegel, professor of psychology in
psychiatry.
"1 can see that iny work will
involve attempting to mediate
between students' needs and
interests, and academic
constraints, financial and
otherwise. There are valid student
concerns that need to be met,
while sustaining the integrity of
the academic programs," Closson
commented.
Closson has been a consultant
to the Cornell Center for the
Improvement of Undergraduate
Education. He served as
coordinator of an experimental
school program in Ithaca, N.Y.,in
which Cornell undergraduates
taught in collaboration with
regular school faculty.
