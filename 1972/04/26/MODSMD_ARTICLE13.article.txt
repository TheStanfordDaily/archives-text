# Perfection Comes To Opera House
## 
### TIM TOOHEY 
It seems that composers near
their deathbeds have been inclined
to choose their texts in a way that
points to their most intimate
thoughts. Mozart, raised as a
Catholic, perhaps felt a need to
return to his faith, as he wrote his
own requiem mass. Similarly,
Gustav Mahler's eclectic spirit,
which encompassed both intimacy
and grandiose mysticism, could
combine a medieval Latin hymn
with the closing scene of Goethe's
Faust (in his Eighth Symphony)
or use Chinese poetry (in Das
Lied) to express his personal view
of a death that was to come.
Schubert's Winterreise, is very
much such a personal document.
Schubert set this group of poems
by the otherwise secondary
German poet, Wilhelm Mueller, to
the music of his last song sycle in
1827, the year before his death. It
remains his most touching
statement in his most
characteristic genre, the "Lied",
which he brought to its highest
point of artistic development.
Death Instinct
Die Winterreise is virtually a
theme and variations on the death
instinct. From first to last it is a
journey which transcends any
earthly landscape to approach
death itself, not a hereafter of
bliss or joy, but one only of sleep
and quiet from the sorrow and

activity of this earth.
In contrast to Die Schoene
Muellerin (The Beautiful
Mill-Maid) it lacks an immediate
kind of contrast that life — with
its sorrows, lusts, and joys — can
provide to a healthy young man.
It instead moves in the
pathological realms of a journey
around despair, death, and
darkness.
Schubert's confrontation with
his own mortality has a much
greater range than even life itself
can have — it explores every kind
of association of external
surrounding and internal emotion
that a man faced with death can
show.
The pattern of this cycle
procedes from the less morbid
feeling of the wanderer as he
leaves Spring and his love behind
through his loneliness and
rejection by the world, to his final
desires of death and rest in the
last song of the work, "The Organ
Grinder".
Sums Up Worlds
In this last song, the musician
stands alone in the Winter playing
his own dirge on his hand organ
with an "empty plate". This is not
the place to explore the entire
range of this work, with its many
associations of weather, hopes,
dreams, and unearthly lights, but
it must be further mentioned that
Schubert's art as a composer is

seen at its height here — capable
of summoning-up not only whole
worlds in the space of a
three-minute song, but also all of
his techniques and feelings in a
cycle of these songs.
Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau
totally captured the profundity of
this masterpiece in his moving
performance on Monday night in
the Opera House. One could have
possibly yearned for a slightly
smaller auditorium than the
cavern of the Opera House for
such an intimate evening, but
Fischer-Dieskau's art transcended
this limitation. He sang so
perfectly and his accord with his
accompanist, Norman Schelter,
was so complete, that all this
reviewer can do is laud his
accomplishment.
His identification with the
work was so complete that one
almost expected him to be
confronted by a Berman-like
Death figure after his final curtain
call. Although I must confess that
I have been reared on
Fischer-Dieskau's Schubert
interpretations, the artist
exceeded whatever I could have
expected of him from his many
recordings. His dramatic
command and vocal resources
completely amazed me.
Perfect Lieder Singer
What are the makings of a
perfect "Lieder Singer"? I feel
that above all, even more than in
the operas of Strauss, Debussy or
Wagner, the singer must be on the
lookout for the close connections
of text and music — he must
interpret both the poem and the
musical line that make up the
song.
It would be foolish for anyone
to maintain that this is an easier
task than the interpretation of the
beautiful, empty-headed warblings
of the "bel canto art".

This is the reason thai
Fischer-Dieskau represents a very
rare combination of intellect and
art, of technique and
understanding. When he interprets
a song, not only does the hearer
know that he understands it, but
that he has reached the heart of
its art.
This was the case Monday
evening especially in
Fischer-Dieskau's interpretations
of the schizophrenic emotions of
"A Dream of Springtime", his
expectant and exciting
interpretation of "The Post", the
subline lyricism of "The Linden
Tree" and the determination and
desperation he conveyed in
"Pluck".
Fischer-Dieskau knows how to
use not only his voice to
emphasize his interpretations, but
also his body. His arm and hand
movements and his facial
expressions were an enormous
factor in the success of his
performances.
His voice is nearly as
phenomenal as it was twenty
years ago, as heard in his earliest
Schubert recordings. It is a voice
both smooth in its range from
bottom to top and yet infinitely
variable — able to express every
sort of emotion without resorting
to exaggeration. It is beautiful and
haunting giving emphasis to the
words of a song.
This reviewer will remember its
tone in the lines from "Pluck"
especially where the words
express the fundamental
loneliness of this work: "If there
is no God on earth, we ourselves
are gods."
Fischer-Dieskau is a singer who
can not really produce an ugly
sound — a fact that may even at
times be a slight liability to his
art. His was a concert that for
once deserved a standing ovation.

recordings. His dramatic
command and vocal resources
completely amazed me.
Perfect Lieder Singer
What are the makings of a
perfect "Lieder Singer"? I feel
that above all, even more than in
the operas of Strauss, Debussy or
Wagner, the singer must be on the
lookout for the close connections
of text and music — he must
interpret both the poem and the
musical line that make up the
song.
It would be foolish for anyone
to maintain that this is an easier
task than the interpretation of the
beautiful, empty-headed warblings
of the "bel canto art".

This is the reason thai
Fischer-Dieskau represents a very
rare combination of intellect and
art, of technique and
understanding. When he interprets
a song, not only does the hearer
know that he understands it, but
that he has reached the heart of
its art.
This was the case Monday
evening especially in
Fischer-Dieskau's interpretations
of the schizophrenic emotions of
"A Dream of Springtime", his
expectant and exciting
interpretation of "The Post", the
subline lyricism of "The Linden
Tree" and the determination and
desperation he conveyed in
"Pluck".
Fischer-Dieskau knows how to
use not only his voice to
emphasize his interpretations, but
also his body. His arm and hand
movements and his facial
expressions were an enormous
factor in the success of his
performances.
His voice is nearly as
phenomenal as it was twenty
years ago, as heard in his earliest
Schubert recordings. It is a voice
both smooth in its range from
bottom to top and yet infinitely
variable — able to express every
sort of emotion without resorting
to exaggeration. It is beautiful and
haunting giving emphasis to the
words of a song.
This reviewer will remember its
tone in the lines from "Pluck"
especially where the words
express the fundamental
loneliness of this work: "If there
is no God on earth, we ourselves
are gods."
Fischer-Dieskau is a singer who
can not really produce an ugly
sound — a fact that may even at
times be a slight liability to his
art. His was a concert that for
once deserved a standing ovation.
It seems that composers near
their deathbeds have been inclined
to choose their texts in a way that
points to their most intimate
thoughts. Mozart, raised as a
Catholic, perhaps felt a need to
return to his faith, as he wrote his
own requiem mass. Similarly,
Gustav Mahler's eclectic spirit,
which encompassed both intimacy
and grandiose mysticism, could
combine a medieval Latin hymn
with the closing scene of Goethe's
Faust (in his Eighth Symphony)
or use Chinese poetry (in Das
Lied) to express his personal view
of a death that was to come.
Schubert's Winterreise, is very
much such a personal document.
Schubert set this group of poems
by the otherwise secondary
German poet, Wilhelm Mueller, to
the music of his last song sycle in
1827, the year before his death. It
remains his most touching
statement in his most
characteristic genre, the "Lied",
which he brought to its highest
point of artistic development.
Death Instinct
Die Winterreise is virtually a
theme and variations on the death
instinct. From first to last it is a
journey which transcends any
earthly landscape to approach
death itself, not a hereafter of
bliss or joy, but one only of sleep
and quiet from the sorrow and

activity of this earth.
In contrast to Die Schoene
Muellerin (The Beautiful
Mill-Maid) it lacks an immediate
kind of contrast that life — with
its sorrows, lusts, and joys — can
provide to a healthy young man.
It instead moves in the
pathological realms of a journey
around despair, death, and
darkness.
Schubert's confrontation with
his own mortality has a much
greater range than even life itself
can have — it explores every kind
of association of external
surrounding and internal emotion
that a man faced with death can
show.
The pattern of this cycle
procedes from the less morbid
feeling of the wanderer as he
leaves Spring and his love behind
through his loneliness and
rejection by the world, to his final
desires of death and rest in the
last song of the work, "The Organ
Grinder".
Sums Up Worlds
In this last song, the musician
stands alone in the Winter playing
his own dirge on his hand organ
with an "empty plate". This is not
the place to explore the entire
range of this work, with its many
associations of weather, hopes,
dreams, and unearthly lights, but
it must be further mentioned that
Schubert's art as a composer is

seen at its height here — capable
of summoning-up not only whole
worlds in the space of a
three-minute song, but also all of
his techniques and feelings in a
cycle of these songs.
Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau
totally captured the profundity of
this masterpiece in his moving
performance on Monday night in
the Opera House. One could have
possibly yearned for a slightly
smaller auditorium than the
cavern of the Opera House for
such an intimate evening, but
Fischer-Dieskau's art transcended
this limitation. He sang so
perfectly and his accord with his
accompanist, Norman Schelter,
was so complete, that all this
reviewer can do is laud his
accomplishment.
His identification with the
work was so complete that one
almost expected him to be
confronted by a Berman-like
Death figure after his final curtain
call. Although I must confess that
I have been reared on
Fischer-Dieskau's Schubert
interpretations, the artist
exceeded whatever I could have
expected of him from his many
recordings. His dramatic
command and vocal resources
completely amazed me.

Mill-Maid) it lacks an immediate
kind of contrast that life — with
its sorrows, lusts, and joys — can
provide to a healthy young man.
It instead moves in the
pathological realms of a journey
around despair, death, and
darkness.
Schubert's confrontation with
his own mortality has a much
greater range than even life itself
can have — it explores every kind
of association of external
surrounding and internal emotion
that a man faced with death can
show.
The pattern of this cycle
procedes from the less morbid
feeling of the wanderer as he
leaves Spring and his love behind
through his loneliness and
rejection by the world, to his final
desires of death and rest in the
last song of the work, "The Organ
Grinder".
Sums Up Worlds
In this last song, the musician
stands alone in the Winter playing
his own dirge on his hand organ
with an "empty plate". This is not
the place to explore the entire
range of this work, with its many
associations of weather, hopes,
dreams, and unearthly lights, but
it must be further mentioned that
Schubert's art as a composer is

seen at its height here — capable
of summoning-up not only whole
worlds in the space of a
three-minute song, but also all of
his techniques and feelings in a
cycle of these songs.
Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau
totally captured the profundity of
this masterpiece in his moving
performance on Monday night in
the Opera House. One could have
possibly yearned for a slightly
smaller auditorium than the
cavern of the Opera House for
such an intimate evening, but
Fischer-Dieskau's art transcended
this limitation. He sang so
perfectly and his accord with his
accompanist, Norman Schelter,
was so complete, that all this
reviewer can do is laud his
accomplishment.
His identification with the
work was so complete that one
almost expected him to be
confronted by a Berman-like
Death figure after his final curtain
call. Although I must confess that
I have been reared on
Fischer-Dieskau's Schubert
interpretations, the artist
exceeded whatever I could have
expected of him from his many
recordings. His dramatic
command and vocal resources
completely amazed me.
Perfect Lieder Singer
What are the makings of a
perfect "Lieder Singer"? I feel
that above all, even more than in
the operas of Strauss, Debussy or
Wagner, the singer must be on the
lookout for the close connections
of text and music — he must
interpret both the poem and the
musical line that make up the
song.
It would be foolish for anyone
to maintain that this is an easier
task than the interpretation of the
beautiful, empty-headed warblings
of the "bel canto art".

This is the reason thai
Fischer-Dieskau represents a very
rare combination of intellect and
art, of technique and
understanding. When he interprets
a song, not only does the hearer
know that he understands it, but
that he has reached the heart of
its art.
This was the case Monday
evening especially in
Fischer-Dieskau's interpretations
of the schizophrenic emotions of
"A Dream of Springtime", his
expectant and exciting
interpretation of "The Post", the
subline lyricism of "The Linden
Tree" and the determination and
desperation he conveyed in
"Pluck".
Fischer-Dieskau knows how to
use not only his voice to
emphasize his interpretations, but
also his body. His arm and hand
movements and his facial
expressions were an enormous
factor in the success of his
performances.
His voice is nearly as
phenomenal as it was twenty
years ago, as heard in his earliest
Schubert recordings. It is a voice
both smooth in its range from
bottom to top and yet infinitely
variable — able to express every
sort of emotion without resorting
to exaggeration. It is beautiful and
haunting giving emphasis to the
words of a song.
This reviewer will remember its
tone in the lines from "Pluck"
especially where the words
express the fundamental
loneliness of this work: "If there
is no God on earth, we ourselves
are gods."
Fischer-Dieskau is a singer who
can not really produce an ugly
sound — a fact that may even at
times be a slight liability to his
art. His was a concert that for
once deserved a standing ovation.
It seems that composers near
their deathbeds have been inclined
to choose their texts in a way that
points to their most intimate
thoughts. Mozart, raised as a
Catholic, perhaps felt a need to
return to his faith, as he wrote his
own requiem mass. Similarly,
Gustav Mahler's eclectic spirit,
which encompassed both intimacy
and grandiose mysticism, could
combine a medieval Latin hymn
with the closing scene of Goethe's
Faust (in his Eighth Symphony)
or use Chinese poetry (in Das
Lied) to express his personal view
of a death that was to come.
Schubert's Winterreise, is very
much such a personal document.
Schubert set this group of poems
by the otherwise secondary
German poet, Wilhelm Mueller, to
the music of his last song sycle in
1827, the year before his death. It
remains his most touching
statement in his most
characteristic genre, the "Lied",
which he brought to its highest
point of artistic development.
Death Instinct
Die Winterreise is virtually a
theme and variations on the death
instinct. From first to last it is a
journey which transcends any
earthly landscape to approach
death itself, not a hereafter of
bliss or joy, but one only of sleep
and quiet from the sorrow and

activity of this earth.
In contrast to Die Schoene
Muellerin (The Beautiful
Mill-Maid) it lacks an immediate
kind of contrast that life — with
its sorrows, lusts, and joys — can
