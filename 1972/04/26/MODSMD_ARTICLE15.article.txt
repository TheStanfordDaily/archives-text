# Falco: New Dimensions In Dance
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
In a performance last Friday at
Cal Berkeley's Zellerbaeh
Auditorium, the Louis Falco
Dance Co. clearly demonstrated
why Falco is one of the most
interesting choreographers
around. Unlike many
choreographers, Falco hits upon a
broad range of the music
spectrum, refusing to let the
audience slip into a simplistic
understanding of movement.
He forces us to do away with
any preconceived notions not
only about dance movement, but
also about the gamut of human
experience. All conventional order
is thrown to the winds and the
audience is confronted only with
straightforward honest movement.
One dance number,
"Nostalgia," choreographed by
Falco's associate director Jennifer
Muller in 1971, showed influences
of Falco's natural movement
quality. However it lacked the
true artistry of Falco's
choreography in that Muller had
not chiselled her movements
down to the most urgent and
essential.
"Nostalgia" brought back the
era of the 30's with all its duality
of romance and raunchiness. The
three dancers, Jennifer Muller,
Georgiana Holmes and Mary Jane
Eisenberg, were dressed in 1930's
garb, with their hair flowing down
their backs.
Excellent Contrasts
The dance became comical
with juxtapositions of the small
Mary Jane Eisenberg with the
other two tall women. Also Muller
made excellent contrasts between
the sentimental qualities of the
background music and the
pointed sexuality of the
choreography.
There was no scenery for this
dance, just a bare wall in the back.
This is one of the few times when
lack of scenery aided rather than
detracted from a dance. The

absence of scenery deepened the
barren crass mood of the piece.
Occasionally, flickering lights
would skim the back wall giving
the sensation that these dancers
were lost in the middle of a large
and lonely city.
The next piece, "Sleepers,"
choreographed by Falco in 1971,
bowled me over in the originality
of its governing concept. Falco
deals with man's relations as an
outgrowth of childish needs and
desires.
As the dance begins, lights
come up on a group of dancers
dressed in white leotards and
tights, huddled in a hump on the
floor. The scene seems very staid
and contained. Suddenly we hear
grunts, groans and complaints like
"Get out of my way."
The sleepers begin to fight and
bicker in an effort to find a
comfortable sleeping position.
Meanwhile, they hum lullaby
music, which as they fight each
other for space to lie in, adds an
eerie note to the whole
performance.
Violent Movement
Then they slowly move out of
the heap and go their own ways to
various parts of the stage. As the
dance develops, the movement
becomes increasingly violent. It
seems that the only way these
dancers can relate is through
violence which at times breaks out
of its conventional expression into
an untamed outburst which at
times left me utterly stunned.
At certain points in the piece,
Falco deals with the perverted
roles men and women assume in
dealing with each other. At one
point, a woman dancer plays
"mommy" with her male partner.
At another point in the dance, a
woman chatters at great length
with her partner about how "you

aren't as good as my Daddy ".
Falco also pokes fun at the
way in which "civilized" society
teaches people to hate their
bodies. After a series of heavy
movements, one dancer yells
disgustedly, I'm all sweaty", Falco
criticizes our haired of the very
medium through which he
expresses himself — the human
body. According to him, we think
we are alive, but in reality we are
just "sleepers", existing unaware
of ourselves and those around us.
This dance's particular strength
was its exploration of the
potential of human sound as an
integral part of dance. The
dancers provide the singing and
gutteral noise which make up the
"music" of the dance. They
become not only bodies in space,
but whole people with whom the
audience can readily identify.
The last piece "Caviar",
choreographed by Falco in 1970,
was the most original "social
statement" dance I have seen yet.
Exploitation of Nature
The basic image for society's
exploitation of nature as well as
of oppressed people was the fish.
Throughout the dance, Falco used
five styrofoam fish as props. The
dancers carried them in soaring
motions across the stage, lied near
them, danced between them and
threw them around.
This dance avoided the usual
quagmires of ecology and anti war
cliches by at several points fading
out of a pessimistic view of the
world and society into a joyous
one, expressed by the dancers'
sudden lithe leaps into the air to
the music of cheerful rock songs.
Thus the audience was given
perspective, seeing both the good
and the bad sides of today's
situation, and , with this
perspective, the pleas for social
change became very real.
Swimming Fish
The dancers wore green
leotards and tights. At certain
times they came to look like fish
swimming under water. There
were several astounding
movements, which gave one the
sensation of ripples moving over
water.
At the end of the dance, Falco
lay down on the ground in the
same position as the styrofoam
fishes around him, thus driving
home his basic message that all
nature is one.
I heard people say they
thought Falco's dances were too
long. That to me simply indicates
that these people didn't
understand what Falco was trying
to accomplish. If these people
want to see a series of circus tricks
or a dance with a straightforward
plot line, let them go to the ballet.
Falco is not interested in short
abortive attempts at glitter and
glamour. He wants to integrate all
aspects of human expression, be it
music, words, drama or
movement, into a total unified
outburst of energy.
We must not try to understand
Falco in terms of conventionally
structured movement. To say
Falco's dances were too long is to
say that one did not look closely
enough at his work. For he is
truly a pioneer in the widening of
dance horizons.

of Falco's natural movement
quality. However it lacked the
true artistry of Falco's
choreography in that Muller had
not chiselled her movements
down to the most urgent and
essential.
"Nostalgia" brought back the
era of the 30's with all its duality
of romance and raunchiness. The
three dancers, Jennifer Muller,
Georgiana Holmes and Mary Jane
Eisenberg, were dressed in 1930's
garb, with their hair flowing down
their backs.
Excellent Contrasts
The dance became comical
with juxtapositions of the small
Mary Jane Eisenberg with the
other two tall women. Also Muller
made excellent contrasts between
the sentimental qualities of the
background music and the
pointed sexuality of the
choreography.
There was no scenery for this
dance, just a bare wall in the back.
This is one of the few times when
lack of scenery aided rather than
detracted from a dance. The

absence of scenery deepened the
barren crass mood of the piece.
Occasionally, flickering lights
would skim the back wall giving
the sensation that these dancers
were lost in the middle of a large
and lonely city.
The next piece, "Sleepers,"
choreographed by Falco in 1971,
bowled me over in the originality
of its governing concept. Falco
deals with man's relations as an
outgrowth of childish needs and
desires.
As the dance begins, lights
come up on a group of dancers
dressed in white leotards and
tights, huddled in a hump on the
floor. The scene seems very staid
and contained. Suddenly we hear
grunts, groans and complaints like
"Get out of my way."
The sleepers begin to fight and
bicker in an effort to find a
comfortable sleeping position.
Meanwhile, they hum lullaby
music, which as they fight each
other for space to lie in, adds an
eerie note to the whole
performance.
Violent Movement
Then they slowly move out of
the heap and go their own ways to
various parts of the stage. As the
dance develops, the movement
becomes increasingly violent. It
seems that the only way these
dancers can relate is through
violence which at times breaks out
of its conventional expression into
an untamed outburst which at
times left me utterly stunned.
At certain points in the piece,
Falco deals with the perverted
roles men and women assume in
dealing with each other. At one
point, a woman dancer plays
"mommy" with her male partner.
At another point in the dance, a
woman chatters at great length
with her partner about how "you

aren't as good as my Daddy ".
Falco also pokes fun at the
way in which "civilized" society
teaches people to hate their
bodies. After a series of heavy
movements, one dancer yells
disgustedly, I'm all sweaty", Falco
criticizes our haired of the very
medium through which he
expresses himself — the human
body. According to him, we think
we are alive, but in reality we are
just "sleepers", existing unaware
of ourselves and those around us.
This dance's particular strength
was its exploration of the
potential of human sound as an
integral part of dance. The
dancers provide the singing and
gutteral noise which make up the
"music" of the dance. They
become not only bodies in space,
but whole people with whom the
audience can readily identify.
The last piece "Caviar",
choreographed by Falco in 1970,
was the most original "social
statement" dance I have seen yet.
Exploitation of Nature
The basic image for society's
exploitation of nature as well as
of oppressed people was the fish.
Throughout the dance, Falco used
five styrofoam fish as props. The
dancers carried them in soaring
motions across the stage, lied near
them, danced between them and
threw them around.
This dance avoided the usual
quagmires of ecology and anti war
cliches by at several points fading
out of a pessimistic view of the
world and society into a joyous
one, expressed by the dancers'
sudden lithe leaps into the air to
the music of cheerful rock songs.
Thus the audience was given
perspective, seeing both the good
and the bad sides of today's
situation, and , with this
perspective, the pleas for social
change became very real.
Swimming Fish
The dancers wore green
leotards and tights. At certain
times they came to look like fish
swimming under water. There
were several astounding
movements, which gave one the
sensation of ripples moving over
water.
At the end of the dance, Falco
lay down on the ground in the
same position as the styrofoam
fishes around him, thus driving
home his basic message that all
nature is one.
I heard people say they
thought Falco's dances were too
long. That to me simply indicates
that these people didn't
understand what Falco was trying
to accomplish. If these people
want to see a series of circus tricks
or a dance with a straightforward
plot line, let them go to the ballet.
Falco is not interested in short
abortive attempts at glitter and
glamour. He wants to integrate all
aspects of human expression, be it
music, words, drama or
movement, into a total unified
outburst of energy.
We must not try to understand
Falco in terms of conventionally
structured movement. To say
Falco's dances were too long is to
say that one did not look closely
enough at his work. For he is
truly a pioneer in the widening of
dance horizons.
In a performance last Friday at
Cal Berkeley's Zellerbaeh
Auditorium, the Louis Falco
Dance Co. clearly demonstrated
why Falco is one of the most
interesting choreographers
around. Unlike many
choreographers, Falco hits upon a
broad range of the music
spectrum, refusing to let the
audience slip into a simplistic
understanding of movement.
He forces us to do away with
any preconceived notions not
only about dance movement, but
also about the gamut of human
experience. All conventional order
is thrown to the winds and the
audience is confronted only with
straightforward honest movement.
One dance number,

choreography.
There was no scenery for this
dance, just a bare wall in the back.
This is one of the few times when
lack of scenery aided rather than
detracted from a dance. The

absence of scenery deepened the
barren crass mood of the piece.
Occasionally, flickering lights
would skim the back wall giving
the sensation that these dancers
were lost in the middle of a large
and lonely city.
The next piece, "Sleepers,"
choreographed by Falco in 1971,
bowled me over in the originality
of its governing concept. Falco
deals with man's relations as an
outgrowth of childish needs and
desires.
As the dance begins, lights
come up on a group of dancers
dressed in white leotards and
tights, huddled in a hump on the
floor. The scene seems very staid
and contained. Suddenly we hear
grunts, groans and complaints like
"Get out of my way."
The sleepers begin to fight and
bicker in an effort to find a
comfortable sleeping position.
Meanwhile, they hum lullaby
music, which as they fight each
other for space to lie in, adds an
eerie note to the whole
performance.
Violent Movement
Then they slowly move out of
the heap and go their own ways to
various parts of the stage. As the
dance develops, the movement
becomes increasingly violent. It
seems that the only way these
dancers can relate is through
violence which at times breaks out
of its conventional expression into
an untamed outburst which at
times left me utterly stunned.
At certain points in the piece,
Falco deals with the perverted
roles men and women assume in
dealing with each other. At one
point, a woman dancer plays
"mommy" with her male partner.
At another point in the dance, a
woman chatters at great length
with her partner about how "you

aren't as good as my Daddy ".
Falco also pokes fun at the
way in which "civilized" society
teaches people to hate their
bodies. After a series of heavy
movements, one dancer yells
disgustedly, I'm all sweaty", Falco
criticizes our haired of the very
medium through which he
expresses himself — the human
body. According to him, we think
we are alive, but in reality we are
just "sleepers", existing unaware
of ourselves and those around us.
This dance's particular strength
was its exploration of the
potential of human sound as an
integral part of dance. The
dancers provide the singing and
gutteral noise which make up the
"music" of the dance. They
become not only bodies in space,
but whole people with whom the
audience can readily identify.
The last piece "Caviar",
choreographed by Falco in 1970,
was the most original "social
statement" dance I have seen yet.
Exploitation of Nature
The basic image for society's
exploitation of nature as well as
of oppressed people was the fish.
Throughout the dance, Falco used
five styrofoam fish as props. The
dancers carried them in soaring
motions across the stage, lied near
them, danced between them and
threw them around.
This dance avoided the usual
quagmires of ecology and anti war
cliches by at several points fading
out of a pessimistic view of the
world and society into a joyous
one, expressed by the dancers'
sudden lithe leaps into the air to
the music of cheerful rock songs.
Thus the audience was given
perspective, seeing both the good
and the bad sides of today's
situation, and , with this
perspective, the pleas for social
change became very real.
Swimming Fish
The dancers wore green
leotards and tights. At certain
times they came to look like fish
swimming under water. There
were several astounding
movements, which gave one the
sensation of ripples moving over
water.
At the end of the dance, Falco
lay down on the ground in the
same position as the styrofoam
fishes around him, thus driving
home his basic message that all
nature is one.
I heard people say they
thought Falco's dances were too
long. That to me simply indicates
that these people didn't
understand what Falco was trying
to accomplish. If these people
want to see a series of circus tricks
or a dance with a straightforward
plot line, let them go to the ballet.
Falco is not interested in short
abortive attempts at glitter and
glamour. He wants to integrate all
aspects of human expression, be it
music, words, drama or
movement, into a total unified
outburst of energy.
We must not try to understand
Falco in terms of conventionally
structured movement. To say
Falco's dances were too long is to
say that one did not look closely
enough at his work. For he is
truly a pioneer in the widening of
dance horizons.
In a performance last Friday at
Cal Berkeley's Zellerbaeh
Auditorium, the Louis Falco
Dance Co. clearly demonstrated
why Falco is one of the most
interesting choreographers
around. Unlike many
choreographers, Falco hits upon a
broad range of the music
spectrum, refusing to let the
audience slip into a simplistic
understanding of movement.
He forces us to do away with
any preconceived notions not
only about dance movement, but
also about the gamut of human
experience. All conventional order
is thrown to the winds and the
audience is confronted only with
straightforward honest movement.
One dance number,
"Nostalgia," choreographed by
Falco's associate director Jennifer
Muller in 1971, showed influences
of Falco's natural movement
quality. However it lacked the
true artistry of Falco's
choreography in that Muller had
not chiselled her movements
down to the most urgent and
essential.
"Nostalgia" brought back the
era of the 30's with all its duality
of romance and raunchiness. The
three dancers, Jennifer Muller,
Georgiana Holmes and Mary Jane
Eisenberg, were dressed in 1930's
garb, with their hair flowing down
their backs.
Excellent Contrasts
The dance became comical
with juxtapositions of the small
Mary Jane Eisenberg with the
other two tall women. Also Muller
made excellent contrasts between
the sentimental qualities of the
background music and the
pointed sexuality of the
choreography.
There was no scenery for this
dance, just a bare wall in the back.
This is one of the few times when
lack of scenery aided rather than
detracted from a dance. The

absence of scenery deepened the
