## The 						Indian Diedâ€”Quietly 
### Charlie Hoffman 
Stanford's Indian symbol
passed away quietly last
Thursday The official
announcement by Presidential
Assistant William Stone made
hardly a ripple in the news media
or in the Stanford community.
The lack of reaction is due to
the fact that for weeks people
have been resigned to the Indian's
inevitable fate. From the
beginning of the controversy last
February, President Lyman and
student "leaders" have firmly
expressed their opposition to the
symbol.
Lyman set up a committee to
study the question of the Indian
symbol, stating that the offensive
mascot would surely be dropped.
There was really no need for the
committee since the President
already had his mind made up.
The Student Senate and the
ASSU Council of Presidents
agreed with Lyman that the
symbol was demeaning and should

be eliminated. With .this united
front of campus politicians
clamoring for the eradication of
the American Indian as the
school's symbol, it could be
assumed that a new mascot would
be in the best interests of the
community.
This assumption, however,
cannot easily be made by the
powers of the campus. There are
rumblings among the students
indicating that they feel
misrepresented by their student
leaders. A petition with sufficient
signatures on it to force the ASSU
to hold a referendum on the
question of eliminating the Indian
as the school's symbol has been
produced by the students.
The petition was handed in in
time to place the question on
today and tomorrow's ASSU
Presidential election, but the
present presidents have stalled and
the symbol referendum will not
appear on the ballot today. Doug

McHenry is aware of the petition's
existence, but he has to officially
"accept" the signatures and has
not done so yet. The Council of
Presidents can at best only stall
the issue, and the referendum will
probably be held before the end
of the quarter.
It is likely that a vast majority
of students will vote to reinstate
the Indian as Stanford's symbol.
Student leaders have been
operating under this assumption
throughout the spring. The
sentiment behind the Senate's
vote to abolish the Indian mascot
was that that august
representative body must protect
the students from perpetuating a
racist institution.
Moreover, the men that
represent the school's mascot
more than any other, the Stanford
athletes, have tried to speak out
for the retention of the Indian.
No one in the decision making
process has thought to seek out

their opinions, however. Jack
Christiansen remarked that "No
one has come around to talk to
us. You would think that we
would have something to say in
the decision "
Support for the Indian symbol
has come from many quarters.
Native Americans from all over
the west have expressed their
dismay over the threat to the
Indian symbol posed by their 55
brothers and sisters on the
Stanford campus.
Thursday's announcement does
nothing to change the status of
the symbol controversy. The
campus powers oppose the Indian
symbol and the rest of the
community is still trying to find a
way to express itself. The issue is
not dead and the controversy will
be settled when the governed are
finally able to confront their
governors.

announcement by Presidential
Assistant William Stone made
hardly a ripple in the news media
or in the Stanford community.
The lack of reaction is due to
the fact that for weeks people
have been resigned to the Indian's
inevitable fate. From the
beginning of the controversy last
February, President Lyman and
student "leaders" have firmly
expressed their opposition to the
symbol.
Lyman set up a committee to
study the question of the Indian
symbol, stating that the offensive
mascot would surely be dropped.
There was really no need for the
committee since the President
already had his mind made up.
The Student Senate and the
ASSU Council of Presidents
agreed with Lyman that the
symbol was demeaning and should

be eliminated. With .this united
front of campus politicians
clamoring for the eradication of
the American Indian as the
school's symbol, it could be
assumed that a new mascot would
be in the best interests of the
community.
This assumption, however,
cannot easily be made by the
powers of the campus. There are
rumblings among the students
indicating that they feel
misrepresented by their student
leaders. A petition with sufficient
signatures on it to force the ASSU
to hold a referendum on the
question of eliminating the Indian
as the school's symbol has been
produced by the students.
The petition was handed in in
time to place the question on
today and tomorrow's ASSU
Presidential election, but the
present presidents have stalled and
the symbol referendum will not
appear on the ballot today. Doug

McHenry is aware of the petition's
existence, but he has to officially
"accept" the signatures and has
not done so yet. The Council of
Presidents can at best only stall
the issue, and the referendum will
probably be held before the end
of the quarter.
It is likely that a vast majority
of students will vote to reinstate
the Indian as Stanford's symbol.
Student leaders have been
operating under this assumption
throughout the spring. The
sentiment behind the Senate's
vote to abolish the Indian mascot
was that that august
representative body must protect
the students from perpetuating a
racist institution.
Moreover, the men that
represent the school's mascot
more than any other, the Stanford
athletes, have tried to speak out
for the retention of the Indian.
No one in the decision making
process has thought to seek out

their opinions, however. Jack
Christiansen remarked that "No
one has come around to talk to
us. You would think that we
would have something to say in
the decision "
Support for the Indian symbol
has come from many quarters.
Native Americans from all over
the west have expressed their
dismay over the threat to the
Indian symbol posed by their 55
brothers and sisters on the
Stanford campus.
Thursday's announcement does
nothing to change the status of
the symbol controversy. The
campus powers oppose the Indian
symbol and the rest of the
community is still trying to find a
way to express itself. The issue is
not dead and the controversy will
be settled when the governed are
finally able to confront their
governors.
