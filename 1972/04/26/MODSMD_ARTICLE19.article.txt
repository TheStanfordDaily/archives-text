### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
Dominating the first half with
excellent passing, shooting, and
positioning the Stanford Lacrosse
team then fell apart in the last
two quarters and lost to the Palo
Alto Lacrosse Club, 11-8, last
Saturday.
The victory gave Palo Alto
undisputed possession of first
place in the Bay Area League.
Stanford jumped into a 4-2
lead before the end of the first
quarter. Ted Suen, Shelley
Gordon, and Chip Lovemann were
the marksmen for the Cards as
they were moving the ball well
around the Palo Alto defense
always keeping them off guard.
The Palo Alto club, on the
other hand, was disorganized and
was passing poorly especially in
their own zone, as the Cards were
forcing mistakes with their
aggressive play.
The Cards started off quickly
in the second period increasing
the lead to 6-2. Stanford was
getting a lot of penalties, but their
defense held up on all but one
rush by the visitors who tallied
just before the half. At this point
it appeared Coach Eakland's
squad had a secure lead.
The third quarter was a
disaster, as the whole team was
obviously tired from their trying
first half. Palo Alto scored five
times in the quarter as their

offense simply beat the Stanford
defense on one-on-one situations
and passing. By the end of the
quartei Stanford trailed 9-7.
The fourth quarter was mostly
ho-hum as Palo Alto scored twice
more before allowing Stanford a
meaningless tally late in the
quarter.
The loss was a disappointing
one for the Cards. But Coach
Eakland was not overly
pessimistic. His team played some

of its best lacrosse ever in the first
half. The passing and maneuvering
in the offensive zone and the
positioning in the defensive zone
were quite impressive.
The Cards' play in the first half
is indicative of their steady
improvement in teamwork. If the
team keeps this pace of
improvement and if they can
avoid second half letdowns they
stand a good chance of defeating
Palo Alto in their next encounter.
