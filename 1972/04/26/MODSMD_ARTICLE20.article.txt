# On The Stanford Course
## U.S. Collegiate Golf To Open 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford's golf team will try to join national
powers like Houston, Texas, Wake Forest, Florida,
Brigham Young, and Arizona State in the elite
group of 1972 major tournament champions when
the fifth annual U.S. Collegiate Invitational golf
tournament opens tomorrow on the Stanford
course.
174 players from 29 teams are entered in the
three day, 54 hole event. Stanford, San Jose State,
and San Diego State are most prominent among
those entrants but Stanford coach Bud Finger
predicts a wide open race for the title. "There are a
lot of teams capable of winning," he said. "Besides
San Jose State, San Diego State, and ourselves, you
can't count out teams like Fresno State, California,
Arizona, or Washington State."
Finger's Stanford teams have won the tourney
three out of the four times it has been played and
the Cards badly need a victory again this weekend.
Stanford is unbeaten in dual matches but the Cards
have played inconsistent golf throughout the year.
"It's about time we snapped out of it," said Finger.
"I know we have the material to win if we play
well."
Most of the Card golfers showed signs of
"snapping out of it" last weekend against California
and the alumni. The weekend's worst varsity score

was 76 and three subpar rounds were recorded.
Stanford should play a major role in the
individual as well as the team competition. Senior
Gary Vanier won the tournament as a sophomore in
1970 and will try to become the first two time
winner of the event.
Finger also believes that all six Stanford entrants
can be regarded as favorites, referring to the
talented Card lineup of Vanier, Tom Keelin, Denny
Colvin, Dave Baskins, Bruce Robertson, and Aly
Trompas. "Any one of those players is capable of
winning the tournament," he said.
Of course Stanford's main goal is a varsity
victory to give the Cards some much needed ;
momentum going into the Pacific Eight and NCAA
tournaments. Stanford's third and fourth place
finishes in the Fresno State Classic and the Western
Intercollegiates were disappointing but a victory
here would firmly establish the Cards as a national
power.
Play will begin tomorrow at 6:30 a.m. with
starting times continuing until 2:00 p.m. Second
round action will be Friday at the same times and
the low 16 teams and all individuals within 10 shots ;
of the 36 hole leader will play the final round on
Saturday. There will be no admission charge for
spectators any of the three days.

GONE FOREVER?—President Lyman announced the end of the
Indian symbol last week and apparently Prince Lightfoot is out of a
job. This may not be the end, however, as students turned in a
petition with enough signatures to force a referendum on the Indian
question. Last night in ASSU Senate action President Doug McHenry
declared he couldn't "morally" put the issue on the ballot as long as he
was President.
