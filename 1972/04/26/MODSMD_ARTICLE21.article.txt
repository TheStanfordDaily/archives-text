# Judge Rules In Favor Of Davis
## 
### FRED MANN 
The defense in the Angela Davis trial won a
stunning victory yesterday, when evidence and
testimony the prosecution had termed "crucial" to
its case was ruled inadmissable by presiding Judge
Richard E. Arnason.
After hearing emotional arguments from both
sides on Monday, Aranson announced his decision
as court began yesterday morning, granting a
defense motion to suppress an 18-page letter-diary
allegedly written by Davis to Soledad Brother
George Jackson. The document, found in Jackson's
San Quentin jail cell after his death in an alleged
escape attempt last summer, "shows her [Davis]
willingness to use violence to help Jackson and the
callousness and disregard for human life evidenced
months before (in the Marin Civic Center shoot-out
for which she faces murder-kidnap-conspiracy
charges)," Assistant Attorney General Albert Harris
argued.
But the judge agreed with the pleas of defense
attorney Leo Branton, who called much of the
document (written a year after the Marin
shoot-out), "totally irrelevant," and referred to any
attempt to determine its relevant and irrelevent
parts "a Herculean task." Arnason ruled that
recognition of the entire 18 pages as evidence might
prejudice and confuse the jury.
Plea Granted
Also granted was the defense plea to bar W.R.
Sellmer, a lieutenant at the San Quentin prison from
testifying. Sellmer claims to have observed the only
meeting between Davis, Jackson and their lawyers.
He also claims to have overheard their
conversations.
In this meeting at the Marin County Jail on July
8, 1971, the prosecution claims that Davis revealed
her passionate feelings for Jackson.

The state has based its case on the belief that
Davis' love and affection for Jackson, a fellow black
revolutionary, prompted her to furnish Jackson's
younger brother Jonathan with guns and to conspire
with him in an elaborate prisoner-hostage escape
plot to free the Soledad Brothers.
Finding that "a defendant's constitutional right
to [confidential relations with] counsel would be
seriously and unlawfully proscribed if testimony of
this type would be permissible," Arnason ruled
against any such testimony by Sellmer.
The prosecution was successful however, in its
attempt to enter three other so-called love letters
from Davis to Jackson into evidence. Overruling
defense objections, the judge termed the letters
"relevant, probative, and competent."
Although the three letters, all written in June of
1970, were admitted into evidence, and Arnason's
ruling on the important 18 page diary-letter was
"without prejudice to the prosecution," (meaning
the state would be allowed to attempt to introduce
portions of the document at a later date),
courtroom observers saw the rulings as a serious
blow to the prosecution's case.
Letters
In his opening statement to the jury last month,
Harris said the letters (including the diary-letter)
would show "how in detail and why it was possible
for Angela Davis, a professor at UCLA, to become
involved and to commit the crimes that we charge
that she did commit."
Obviously shaken by the decision, prosecutor
Harris proceeded to read aloud the three admitted
letters. In them, Davis wrote philosophically and
vividly of revolutionary goals, "the Black
Bourgeoise," the role of black women, and her
personal feelings about Jackson and all black
people.

Emphasizing those parts which related to their
personal relationship, Harris read from a letter dated
June 2, 1970: "I have come to love you very
deeply. I count on you to believe me, George. I have
used these words very seldom in my 26
years—because I could not have meant them very
often .. .My love—your love—reinforces my
fighting instincts, it tells me to go to war."
Ending a letter from June 10, 1970, Davis wrote:
"George—my feelings for you run very deep. My
memory fails me when I search in the past for an
encounter with a human being as strong, as
beautiful, as you. Something in you has managed to
smash through the fortress I long ago erected
around my soul. I wonder what it is. I'm very glad. I
love you. Hasta la Victoria Siempre, Angela."
Revolt
Most of the letters, however, dealt with her views
of blacks and revolution. Calling Leroi Jones and
Ron Karenga "pig agents" who ''demand the total
submission of the black female as rectification for
the century-long wrongs she has done to the black
male," Davis urges that "women's liberation in the
revolution is inseparable from the liberation of the
male. We [women) too must pick up the sword . ."

But the judge agreed with the pleas of defense
attorney Leo Branton, who called much of the
document (written a year after the Marin
shoot-out), "totally irrelevant," and referred to any
attempt to determine its relevant and irrelevent
parts "a Herculean task." Arnason ruled that
recognition of the entire 18 pages as evidence might
prejudice and confuse the jury.
Plea Granted
Also granted was the defense plea to bar W.R.
Sellmer, a lieutenant at the San Quentin prison from
testifying. Sellmer claims to have observed the only
meeting between Davis, Jackson and their lawyers.
He also claims to have overheard their
conversations.
In this meeting at the Marin County Jail on July
8, 1971, the prosecution claims that Davis revealed
her passionate feelings for Jackson.

The state has based its case on the belief that
Davis' love and affection for Jackson, a fellow black
revolutionary, prompted her to furnish Jackson's
younger brother Jonathan with guns and to conspire
with him in an elaborate prisoner-hostage escape
plot to free the Soledad Brothers.
Finding that "a defendant's constitutional right
to [confidential relations with] counsel would be
seriously and unlawfully proscribed if testimony of
this type would be permissible," Arnason ruled
against any such testimony by Sellmer.
The prosecution was successful however, in its
attempt to enter three other so-called love letters
from Davis to Jackson into evidence. Overruling
defense objections, the judge termed the letters
"relevant, probative, and competent."
Although the three letters, all written in June of
1970, were admitted into evidence, and Arnason's
ruling on the important 18 page diary-letter was
"without prejudice to the prosecution," (meaning
the state would be allowed to attempt to introduce
portions of the document at a later date),
courtroom observers saw the rulings as a serious
blow to the prosecution's case.
Letters
In his opening statement to the jury last month,
Harris said the letters (including the diary-letter)
would show "how in detail and why it was possible
for Angela Davis, a professor at UCLA, to become
involved and to commit the crimes that we charge
that she did commit."
Obviously shaken by the decision, prosecutor
Harris proceeded to read aloud the three admitted
letters. In them, Davis wrote philosophically and
vividly of revolutionary goals, "the Black
Bourgeoise," the role of black women, and her
personal feelings about Jackson and all black
people.

Emphasizing those parts which related to their
personal relationship, Harris read from a letter dated
June 2, 1970: "I have come to love you very
deeply. I count on you to believe me, George. I have
used these words very seldom in my 26
years—because I could not have meant them very
often .. .My love—your love—reinforces my
fighting instincts, it tells me to go to war."
Ending a letter from June 10, 1970, Davis wrote:
"George—my feelings for you run very deep. My
memory fails me when I search in the past for an
encounter with a human being as strong, as
beautiful, as you. Something in you has managed to
smash through the fortress I long ago erected
around my soul. I wonder what it is. I'm very glad. I
love you. Hasta la Victoria Siempre, Angela."
Revolt
Most of the letters, however, dealt with her views
of blacks and revolution. Calling Leroi Jones and
Ron Karenga "pig agents" who ''demand the total
submission of the black female as rectification for
the century-long wrongs she has done to the black
male," Davis urges that "women's liberation in the
revolution is inseparable from the liberation of the
male. We [women) too must pick up the sword . ."
The defense in the Angela Davis trial won a
stunning victory yesterday, when evidence and
testimony the prosecution had termed "crucial" to
its case was ruled inadmissable by presiding Judge
Richard E. Arnason.
After hearing emotional arguments from both
sides on Monday, Aranson announced his decision
as court began yesterday morning, granting a
defense motion to suppress an 18-page letter-diary
allegedly written by Davis to Soledad Brother
George Jackson. The document, found in Jackson's
San Quentin jail cell after his death in an alleged
escape attempt last summer, "shows her [Davis]
willingness to use violence to help Jackson and the
callousness and disregard for human life evidenced
months before (in the Marin Civic Center shoot-out
for which she faces murder-kidnap-conspiracy
charges)," Assistant Attorney General Albert Harris
argued.
