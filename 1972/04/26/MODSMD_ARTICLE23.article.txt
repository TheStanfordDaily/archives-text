# Anti-War Petition
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
"It's rare for law schools to take a
stand, and it's rare that they take it
together," Frederick Baron comment
ed.
Baron, a first-year law student here,
is the initiator of a nationwide
campaign of law schools protesting the
U.S. escalation of air attacks in
Indochina.
Petitions expressing "outrage at the
current massive bombing attacks" have
been sent to 148 law schools through
out the country. In about a week, the
Law School Coalition for Peace
expects to announce the results and
relay them to politicians and the press.
Baron said he started the petition
because initial law school "reaction to
the renewal of the bombing was
silence—just like they were sleep
walking."
Law Professors Anthony Amster
dam and Herbert Packer are serving as
co-chairmen of the petition effort,
which started with more than 325
signatures from students, faculty, and
staff at the law school here.
Cessation of Bombing
The petition calls "simply for
cessation of bombing throughout Viet
nam and for resumption of peace
negotiations in Paris." It decries "this
senseless renewal of brutality upon a
people entrapped in a political, mili
tary, and moral vacuum."
The effort has been endorsed by
Law School deans at Stanford, Har

var«l Yale, Pennsylvania, Arizona, UC
Davis, and UCLA.
Student leaders at each law school
have been sent the petition and a
three-page manual explaining the best
methods to recruit endorsements,
circulate petitions, and publicize the
effort.
Communication Network
The leaflet also pledges to "estab
lish an ongoing law school communi
cation network to continue the work
for peace." Some of the more than 20
Stanford law students working on the
project talk of a nationwide class
boycott or coordinated work in
political campaigns as future efforts.
But right now, the Coalition is
concentrating on the broad support a
petition can bring, what it calls "an
attempt to force an immediate con
sensus of opposition, to focus dissent
at its common denominator."
Although he is not certain what
effect a petition can have, Baron
considers the effort an important
protest from the law schools because
they are usually considered "very staid
centers of resources for power in
America."
Baron said that political candidates
depend on law professors and students
for campaign help. "We are trying to
say that they will not be able to come
to law schools for resources unless
they are aware of the stands law
schools have taken and make clear
their views on the war."
