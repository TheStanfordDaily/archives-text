# Paris Talks Reopened; Kissinger Trip Disclosed
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
The Paris Peace Talks will resume
tomorrow after a one month's suspen
sion, the White House announced
yesterday.
It was also revealed yesterday that
foreign-affairs adviser Henry Kissinger
was secretly dispatched to Moscow last
week and spent four days in talks with
Soviet Leaders on Vietnam.
In publicizing the reopening of the
Paris talks, White House Press Secre
tary Ronald L. Ziegler said: "It is the
United States' view that the first item
of business in these talks must be the
discussion of measures which will put
an end to the flagrant North Vietnam
ese invasion of South Vietnam ... We
are not interested in sterile debate."
Ziegler added that the United
States "will take a dim view of keeping
the Paris forum open" if Hanoi seeks
to use it for such purposes.
President Richard Nixon will make
a nationwide television and radio
address on the Indochina War tonight
at 7 P.S.T.
Test Intentions
Nixon ordered the peace talks
suspended on March 23 and the North
Vietnamese have demanded repeatedly
that they be resumed. "We are willing
to test the other side ... to test their
intentions," Ziegler said.
The spokesman refused to say when
Nixon decided to resume the talks.
When asked whether Nixon had agreed
to halt bombing of North Vietnam in
order to resume the talks, he respond
ed that the United States is deter
mined to assist South Vietnam "to
prevent Hanoi from imposing its
will . . . through force."
"We will take whatever military
steps are necessary . . . including the
bombing of military targets in North
Vietnam."
This unusual night-time announce
ment came less than eight hours after

the disclosure of Kissinger's clandes
tine journey, the latest in a series of
secret foreign missions he has under
taken for Nixon.
False Report
He made the Thursday-to-Monday
visit to the Soviet capital while White
House officials falsely reported that
Kissinger was at the Camp Davis
presidential retreat in Maryland con
ferring with Nixon. The secrecy was
necessary, Kissinger told newsmen
yesterday, because "we are at the
moment in a very delicate phase of
international relations."
A joint announcement by the White
House and the Kremlin yesterday said
that Kissinger's talks with Communist
party head Leonid I. Breshnev and
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
"dealt with important international
problems as well as with bilateral
matters preparatory to talks between
President Nixon and Soviet leaders in
May."
Kissinger described the sessions as
"useful . . . frank ... satisfactory,"
but would not divulge the specific
issues discussed.
There were clear signs, however,
that Kissinger relayed Nixon's unhap
piness over Soviet- shipment to North
Vietnam of arms being used in the
current North Vietnamese thrust into
South Vietnam—a flow of weapons
Nixon has twice criticfzed.
After meeting with Kissinger fol
lowing that adviser's return from
Moscow, Nixon decided on his nation
wide address. It will be carried tonight
on closed circuit television in Memor
ial Church. Nixon Dlans to discuss the
situation in South Vietnam and to
announce his decision on U.S. troop
levels there after May 1.
Ziegler also said that the with
drawal rate Nixon had set which
would bring the troop level to 69,000
by May 1 would be met.

Meanwhile, in combat action yes
terday, President Nguyen Van Thieu
has ordered a counter-attack to recap
ture two key fire bases lost Monday
north of Kontum. A U.S. air strike
wrecked a bridge behind the tank-led
main force of North Vietnamese
advancing down Highway 14 toward
Kontum, but South Vietnamese troops
are still falling back before the
onslaught. B-52 Stratofortresses con
tinued their pounding of enemy
positions from Southwest of Kontum
to 29 miles northwest of the provincial
capital, dropping about 900 tons of
bombs, the Associated Press reported
yesterday.
Nationally, anti-war protests con
tinued on a less intensive level
yesterday. Violence occured at Colum
bia University in New York City,
however, when policemen forcefully
evicted demonstrators from Hamilton
Hall. Six students and four policemen
were injured. Plans for a local
demonstration against the war on
April 29 continue in New York. The
American Federation of State,
County, and Municipal Employees,
one of the most powerful unions in
New York, has endorsed Saturday's
anti-war activity. Several other signifi
cant unions, including the New York
Meat-Cutters Union, have also agreed
to support the demonstrations.
Locally, organizers of a noon rally
today in White Plaza plan to burn
Richard Nixon in effigy. Stanford
anti-war activists are also preparing for
the May 4th nationwide student strike.
They have announced a planning
meeting tomorrow at 10 a.m. in the
Women's Center. The Palo Alto City
Council Monday night voiced its
anti-war sentiment by voting five to
three to condemn renewed U.S.
bombing in North Vietnam and calling
for immediate withdrawal of all U.S.
forces from Southeast Asia.

visit to the Soviet capital while White
House officials falsely reported that
Kissinger was at the Camp Davis
presidential retreat in Maryland con
ferring with Nixon. The secrecy was
necessary, Kissinger told newsmen
yesterday, because "we are at the
moment in a very delicate phase of
international relations."
A joint announcement by the White
House and the Kremlin yesterday said
that Kissinger's talks with Communist
party head Leonid I. Breshnev and
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
"dealt with important international
problems as well as with bilateral
matters preparatory to talks between
President Nixon and Soviet leaders in
May."
Kissinger described the sessions as
"useful . . . frank ... satisfactory,"
but would not divulge the specific
issues discussed.
There were clear signs, however,
that Kissinger relayed Nixon's unhap
piness over Soviet- shipment to North
Vietnam of arms being used in the
current North Vietnamese thrust into
South Vietnam—a flow of weapons
Nixon has twice criticfzed.
After meeting with Kissinger fol
lowing that adviser's return from
Moscow, Nixon decided on his nation
wide address. It will be carried tonight
on closed circuit television in Memor
ial Church. Nixon Dlans to discuss the
situation in South Vietnam and to
announce his decision on U.S. troop
levels there after May 1.
Ziegler also said that the with
drawal rate Nixon had set which
would bring the troop level to 69,000
by May 1 would be met.

Meanwhile, in combat action yes
terday, President Nguyen Van Thieu
has ordered a counter-attack to recap
ture two key fire bases lost Monday
north of Kontum. A U.S. air strike
wrecked a bridge behind the tank-led
main force of North Vietnamese
advancing down Highway 14 toward
Kontum, but South Vietnamese troops
are still falling back before the
onslaught. B-52 Stratofortresses con
tinued their pounding of enemy
positions from Southwest of Kontum
to 29 miles northwest of the provincial
capital, dropping about 900 tons of
bombs, the Associated Press reported
yesterday.
Nationally, anti-war protests con
tinued on a less intensive level
yesterday. Violence occured at Colum
bia University in New York City,
however, when policemen forcefully
evicted demonstrators from Hamilton
Hall. Six students and four policemen
were injured. Plans for a local
demonstration against the war on
April 29 continue in New York. The
American Federation of State,
County, and Municipal Employees,
one of the most powerful unions in
New York, has endorsed Saturday's
anti-war activity. Several other signifi
cant unions, including the New York
Meat-Cutters Union, have also agreed
to support the demonstrations.
Locally, organizers of a noon rally
today in White Plaza plan to burn
Richard Nixon in effigy. Stanford
anti-war activists are also preparing for
the May 4th nationwide student strike.
They have announced a planning
meeting tomorrow at 10 a.m. in the
Women's Center. The Palo Alto City
Council Monday night voiced its
anti-war sentiment by voting five to
three to condemn renewed U.S.
bombing in North Vietnam and calling
for immediate withdrawal of all U.S.
forces from Southeast Asia.
The Paris Peace Talks will resume
tomorrow after a one month's suspen
sion, the White House announced
yesterday.
It was also revealed yesterday that
foreign-affairs adviser Henry Kissinger
was secretly dispatched to Moscow last
week and spent four days in talks with
Soviet Leaders on Vietnam.
In publicizing the reopening of the
Paris talks, White House Press Secre
tary Ronald L. Ziegler said: "It is the
United States' view that the first item
of business in these talks must be the
discussion of measures which will put
an end to the flagrant North Vietnam
ese invasion of South Vietnam ... We
are not interested in sterile debate."
Ziegler added that the United
States "will take a dim view of keeping
the Paris forum open" if Hanoi seeks
to use it for such purposes.
President Richard Nixon will make
a nationwide television and radio
address on the Indochina War tonight
at 7 P.S.T.
Test Intentions
Nixon ordered the peace talks
suspended on March 23 and the North
Vietnamese have demanded repeatedly
that they be resumed. "We are willing
to test the other side ... to test their
intentions," Ziegler said.
The spokesman refused to say when
Nixon decided to resume the talks.
When asked whether Nixon had agreed
to halt bombing of North Vietnam in
order to resume the talks, he respond
ed that the United States is deter
mined to assist South Vietnam "to
prevent Hanoi from imposing its
will . . . through force."
"We will take whatever military
steps are necessary . . . including the
bombing of military targets in North
Vietnam."
This unusual night-time announce
ment came less than eight hours after

the disclosure of Kissinger's clandes
tine journey, the latest in a series of
secret foreign missions he has under
taken for Nixon.
