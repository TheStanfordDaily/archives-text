# One Destroyed
## Two University Vehicles Set On Fire 
### 
One University vehicle was destroy
ed and another scorched by fires set
by arsonists at 1:37 yesterday morn
ing, the Stanford Fire Department
reported yesterday.
The cars, both 1972 Chevrolet
Impalas, were parked on the south side
of Encina Hall when arsonists broke
windows in each vehicle, and tossed a
burning highway flare into each.
One flare scorched the floorboards
of the car, but did not ignite it, while
the other began a fire that totally

involved the vehicle before firemen
arrived.
The fires were reported by a Wells
Fargo security guard. A janitor, who
heard breaking glass, saw two suspects
fleeing toward Toyon Hall, and watch
ed flames begin to engulf one vehicle.
Quickly Extinguished
The fires were quickly extinguished
by the Stanford Fire Department. The
two units had been returning from a
minor 1:07 a.m. fire at the Delta
Upsilon fraternity, when they were
dispatched to the vehicle fire at
Encina.
Fire Chief Frank Jurian also reveal
ed that his department responded to
22 false alarms last Friday, including
six in one half-hour period.
Because of the number of false
alarms, the fire department used its
administrative vehicles to check the
alarms, without rolling engines to each
report. It also used fewer than the
normal four engines to respond to
alarms, and instructed those engines
responding to drive without red lights
and sirens.
Commenting on an unsigned leaflet
distributed in dormitories Tuesday
night, which included instructions on
how to make incendiary devices and
molotov cocktails, Jurian observed
that the authors "knew what they
were doing."

The one-page mimeographed sheet
exhorted students to "intensify the
struggle," and provided detailed in
structions on how to construct "spi
ders," a device made from construc
tion staples which are designed to
puncture tires.
Stink Bombs
The broadsheet also described the
manufacture of stink bombs from
sulphur, hydrated lime, and ammonia.
The authors claimed that stink bombs
made from these ingredients are "a
guaranteed hit at any CJP hearing,
Academic Council meeting, etc."

In addition, the leaflet recom
mended using liquid steel or aluminum
to freeze locks, forcing the University
to replace them, pouring sugar into the
gas tanks of University vehicles, and
flushing cherry bombs into plumbing
to destroy it.
The leaflet also included informa
tioii on the production of a primitive
jellied gasoline which will stick to
anything it is thrown against, and of
well-designed molotov cocktails.
Both Jurian and Stanford Director
of Public Safety Marvin Herrington
deplored the leaflets.

heard breaking glass, saw two suspects
fleeing toward Toyon Hall, and watch
ed flames begin to engulf one vehicle.
Quickly Extinguished
The fires were quickly extinguished
by the Stanford Fire Department. The
two units had been returning from a
minor 1:07 a.m. fire at the Delta
Upsilon fraternity, when they were
dispatched to the vehicle fire at
Encina.
Fire Chief Frank Jurian also reveal
ed that his department responded to
22 false alarms last Friday, including
six in one half-hour period.
Because of the number of false
alarms, the fire department used its
administrative vehicles to check the
alarms, without rolling engines to each
report. It also used fewer than the
normal four engines to respond to
alarms, and instructed those engines
responding to drive without red lights
and sirens.
Commenting on an unsigned leaflet
distributed in dormitories Tuesday
night, which included instructions on
how to make incendiary devices and
molotov cocktails, Jurian observed
that the authors "knew what they
were doing."

The one-page mimeographed sheet
exhorted students to "intensify the
struggle," and provided detailed in
structions on how to construct "spi
ders," a device made from construc
tion staples which are designed to
puncture tires.
Stink Bombs
The broadsheet also described the
manufacture of stink bombs from
sulphur, hydrated lime, and ammonia.
The authors claimed that stink bombs
made from these ingredients are "a
guaranteed hit at any CJP hearing,
Academic Council meeting, etc."

In addition, the leaflet recom
mended using liquid steel or aluminum
to freeze locks, forcing the University
to replace them, pouring sugar into the
gas tanks of University vehicles, and
flushing cherry bombs into plumbing
to destroy it.
The leaflet also included informa
tioii on the production of a primitive
jellied gasoline which will stick to
anything it is thrown against, and of
well-designed molotov cocktails.
Both Jurian and Stanford Director
of Public Safety Marvin Herrington
deplored the leaflets.
