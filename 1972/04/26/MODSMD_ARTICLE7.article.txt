# University States It Won't Hire Any More Outside Photographers
## 
### ED KOHN 
University officials said yesterday
that outside photographers probably
will not be hired in the future to cover
campus demonstrations.
"I think the question is moot," said
Special Assistant to the President John
Schwartz. "It will probably be a long
time before the University hires
outside photographers again."

The University hired two people
from San Francisco—one of whom
falsely identified himself as a San
Francisco Chronicle ohotographer and
later was placed under citizen's arrest
by two law students—to photograph
Friday's demonstrations for the Stan
ford Department of Public Safety.
"When the University hires outside
people to do a specific task, it is
difficult to establish limits on that
individual's activities on an ad hoc
basis," Schwartz, who prosecutes stu
dents before the Campus Judicial
Panel, said.
What to Photograph?
He said that "to do otherwise is
fraught with an awful lot of prob
lems." Schwartz noted that outside
photographers would not be familiar
with Stanford disruption policies and
would not know what to photograph.
Schwartz told the Daily that he had
asked the Public Safety Department
Thursday to hire additional outside
photographers because of the large
number of classroom disruptions anti
war demonstrators were planning for
Friday morning.
According to Public Safety Depart
ment Chief Marvin Herrington, the
two photographers—Michael W. Mur
phy, a San Francisco private detective,
and an associate, Nick Outin, a San
Francisco electrician who Murphy says
"takes pictures"—were hired late
Thursday afternoon after numerous
other photographers, including some
with working press credentials, de
clined to accept the assignment.
Herrington said the two worked
Friday morning but took only two or
three rolls of film, "mostly crowd
shots."
No Guards Available
"We didn't give them any instruc
tions," Herrington said. He stated that
he had planned to have a Stanford
guard accompany each off-campus
photographer, but he "ran out of
men" before the assigned 7 a.m.
starting hour for the pair. He said the
guards would have "guided" the
photographers around campus.
Herrington said that outside photo

graphers are useless in situations such
as Friday's demonstrations because
they "don't really know what they're
after. People have to know what goes
on in the University" to serve as
effective police photographers, he said.
During the course of the morning
demonstrations on Quad. Outin told
demonstrators and Daily reporters that
he was Bob Keeley, a Chronicle
photographer. Keeley is an advertising
salesman for the San Francisco News
paper Printing Co., which prints and
handles advertising for the Chronicle
and the San Francisco Examiner.
Two law students made a citizen's
arrest of Outin at midday, charging
him with violation of Section 529 of
the California Penal Code (acting in
assumed character). A deputy Santa
Clara County district attorney, how
ever, failed to press charges, leaving
the two students, Michael Goldstein
and Andrew Lipps, liable for false
arrest.
Doubtful Grounds for Suit
Lipps said yesterday that he had an
appointment with the district attor
ney's office this afternoon to discuss
the case. He said he doubted that there
are grounds to support a false arrest
suit against him or Goldstein.
Outin apparently was hired for the
day by Murphy, who advertises that he
is a licensed private detective who
specializes in "shadowing," "tracing,"
and "photography." Murphy yester
day apologized to the Chronicle for
Outin's conduct. Outin could not be
reached for comment.
When contacted by the Daily
yesterday, Murphy became flustered
and refused to discuss the matter,
telling a reporter that he had to talk
"to some people at Stanford" before
he could answer any questions.
However, Herrington said that Mur
phy had been hired only to photo
graph Friday's events. He also indicat
ed that once he had learned that Outin
was impersonating a Chronicle photo
grapher, he asked him to cease the
practice. He said he sent Outin and
Murphy home after working only half
the day.

Francisco Chronicle ohotographer and
later was placed under citizen's arrest
by two law students—to photograph
Friday's demonstrations for the Stan
ford Department of Public Safety.
"When the University hires outside
people to do a specific task, it is
difficult to establish limits on that
individual's activities on an ad hoc
basis," Schwartz, who prosecutes stu
dents before the Campus Judicial
Panel, said.
What to Photograph?
He said that "to do otherwise is
fraught with an awful lot of prob
lems." Schwartz noted that outside
photographers would not be familiar
with Stanford disruption policies and
would not know what to photograph.
Schwartz told the Daily that he had
asked the Public Safety Department
Thursday to hire additional outside
photographers because of the large
number of classroom disruptions anti
war demonstrators were planning for
Friday morning.
According to Public Safety Depart
ment Chief Marvin Herrington, the
two photographers—Michael W. Mur
phy, a San Francisco private detective,
and an associate, Nick Outin, a San
Francisco electrician who Murphy says
"takes pictures"—were hired late
Thursday afternoon after numerous
other photographers, including some
with working press credentials, de
clined to accept the assignment.
Herrington said the two worked
Friday morning but took only two or
three rolls of film, "mostly crowd
shots."
No Guards Available
"We didn't give them any instruc
tions," Herrington said. He stated that
he had planned to have a Stanford
guard accompany each off-campus
photographer, but he "ran out of
men" before the assigned 7 a.m.
starting hour for the pair. He said the
guards would have "guided" the
photographers around campus.
Herrington said that outside photo

graphers are useless in situations such
as Friday's demonstrations because
they "don't really know what they're
after. People have to know what goes
on in the University" to serve as
effective police photographers, he said.
During the course of the morning
demonstrations on Quad. Outin told
demonstrators and Daily reporters that
he was Bob Keeley, a Chronicle
photographer. Keeley is an advertising
salesman for the San Francisco News
paper Printing Co., which prints and
handles advertising for the Chronicle
and the San Francisco Examiner.
Two law students made a citizen's
arrest of Outin at midday, charging
him with violation of Section 529 of
the California Penal Code (acting in
assumed character). A deputy Santa
Clara County district attorney, how
ever, failed to press charges, leaving
the two students, Michael Goldstein
and Andrew Lipps, liable for false
arrest.
Doubtful Grounds for Suit
Lipps said yesterday that he had an
appointment with the district attor
ney's office this afternoon to discuss
the case. He said he doubted that there
are grounds to support a false arrest
suit against him or Goldstein.
Outin apparently was hired for the
day by Murphy, who advertises that he
is a licensed private detective who
specializes in "shadowing," "tracing,"
and "photography." Murphy yester
day apologized to the Chronicle for
Outin's conduct. Outin could not be
reached for comment.
When contacted by the Daily
yesterday, Murphy became flustered
and refused to discuss the matter,
telling a reporter that he had to talk
"to some people at Stanford" before
he could answer any questions.
However, Herrington said that Mur
phy had been hired only to photo
graph Friday's events. He also indicat
ed that once he had learned that Outin
was impersonating a Chronicle photo
grapher, he asked him to cease the
practice. He said he sent Outin and
Murphy home after working only half
the day.

NICK BRUNOT'S NAMESAKE—Nick Outin, a San Francisco electrician hired by the Stanford Department of Public
Safety to photograph classroom disruptions Friday, is confronted by Mick Goldstein and Andrew Lipps, two law
students who attempted to place him under citizen's arrest. Outin is at the left, wearing a white hat; behind him is his
partner, Richard Murphy, a San Francisco detective; Lipps is on the foreground, wearing glasses; and Goldstein is behind
him, with a goatee.
University officials said yesterday
that outside photographers probably
will not be hired in the future to cover
campus demonstrations.
"I think the question is moot," said
Special Assistant to the President John
Schwartz. "It will probably be a long
time before the University hires
outside photographers again."

The University hired two people
from San Francisco—one of whom
falsely identified himself as a San
Francisco Chronicle ohotographer and
later was placed under citizen's arrest
by two law students—to photograph
Friday's demonstrations for the Stan
ford Department of Public Safety.
