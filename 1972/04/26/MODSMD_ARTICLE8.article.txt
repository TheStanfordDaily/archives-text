## Free The Milpitas Brothers!

Even though I was supporting
the student strike, I attended,
reluctantly, Professor Donald
Tamm's course on "The Bust"
Friday afternoon.
Here's my student evaluation
of the course, which seemed
definitely over-enrolled.
As I stood encircled by tac
squad outside Stickney's at Town
and Country Village the first thing
that entered my head was almost
a rock. "Crazies!" I thought.
Then I had my first reaction to
police repression: "Boy, am I ever
stupid letting this happen."
I took a recently purchased
bumper sticker out of my pocket
and gazed at the big orange
letters. McCloskey. "Ain't it great
to be working through the
system?" I thought to myself.
I noticed a big trash pile at the
center of our group where people
were depositing things they didn't
want cluttering their pockets
while in jail. A bullet. Two hash
pipes. A joint.
National Anthem
When people started singing
the national anthem with their
fists in the air, although this
sounds corny, it was as if our
insides became interlocked against
the encirclement and poured over
the helmets and riot sticks to our
supporters.
I suppose it was a mixture of
the emotional intensity of the
confrontation combined with a
frightening feeling of power that
while under arrest you had
reclaimed a song of liberty and
resistance.
When we got done with the
anthem, we were drained of the
heavy emotionality, but it seemed
to have cauterized our spirits. We
seemed almost to bounce with
buoyant resiliency.
Busing
We were led onto the bus and
locked in.
"Okay," one guy yelled,
"when we get there, let's win this
one for the Gipper."
Soon everybody was clapping,
yelling, and laughing, "Beat Cal!
Beat Cal!"
Someone came up with "Don't
Bus Schoolchildren" which also
quickly became a favorite.
One guy suggested we make
200 reservations for a reunion at
Stickney's the next night. He
added that we should drive, since
blocking a thoroughfare with your
car is the American way.
The bus ride to Milpitas
consisted of anti-war cheers,
bewildered motorists wondering
what the hell 25 fists were
sticking out a bus window for,
and one giant "Fuck Lockheed"
as we passed their plant.
Inside the Elmwood parking
lot our driver and officer left.
"We've taken the bus!"
"What should we do with it?"

"Let's live on it!"
Pandemonium.
Women
A bus of arrested women also
rolled into the compound. A
matronly matron strolled out
from the jail.
People began whistling until
one more-liberated guy told us if
we were going to feed her shit to
at least do it in a non-chauvinist
manner. So we just oinked.
As more buses rolled into the
parking lot, we realized the
number of arrests and started a
"Beat Maryland" cheer referring
to the numerous arrests at their
campus.
For reasons only known to the
police, the women were
transferred from their bus to
another, one by one. Each got a
standing ovation from us,
although I must confess it was not
only for being a sister in struggle.
After an hour and a half on the
bus, people were still cheering and
yelling and chanting and pounding
the roof of our bus until our
hands felt like overcooked
spaghetti.
The only problem was our
bladders.
Interior Decoration
Finally we were led out for
booking into a beautiful empty
auditorium with pale green walls.
You know, the color of the faded
plastic plants in Denny's. They
went great with the
chocolate-fudge colored curtains.
Of course, prisons aren't build for
aesthetics.
At dingy brown desks, 12
officers sat in front of typewriters
with long lines of people. Another
three lines were having their

fingerprints taken. There was
another line on the stage getting
their mugshots taken, with
another just sitting along the wall
doing nothing.
It looked familiar. "Hey Bill!"
I called out to a friend, "I thought
you pre-reged."
Along the wall people were
starting to sing "We Shall
Overcome". A sergeant came up
who looked like a seedy Jack
Webb. "Okay, you guys you play
ball with us, we'll play ball with
you; you want to make it tough,
we can make it tough."
Kids
We shut up. Then they
rounded up the juveniles and led
them out. We gave them a
standing ovation. One of us
looked at an officer and asked,
"What's the matter with kids
these days?"
There were six doors to the
auditorium and with incredible
efficiency an officer being paid
time and a half overtime manned
each one so us heavy rads
wouldn't escape.
We moved in a circle. First we
waited. Then we had our mugshot
taken. Then we waited. Then we
waited some more. Then we were
taken to a typewriter where they
asked probing questions about
your nicknames and tattoos. Then
we waited, waited some more, and
waited even more. Then we were
fingerprinted.
Then we had an interview with
a guy who got you out on your
own recognizance. We waited
about an hour to see him and then
he just took down your Student
I.D. number. Just like cashing a
check at the bookstore, huh?

They began taking names in
order from the bottom of the pile.
These were the people who had
waited the longest. Then for some
reason they began taking people's
names from the top so that the
people in the middle really got
screwed.
Democracy?
"Hey, 1 thought I was next,"
one guy near me said.
"What do you think this is, a
democracy?" I asked.
A detective was asked what the
tac squad did when they weren't
busting up riots.
"They hang," he replied doing
a great gorilla impersonation.
Most police seemed as friendly
as they could in an overworked
bureaucracy. Of course, receiving
time and a half couldn't have hurt
their spirits. But that was the
only real downer. Here were these
guys helpfully working for law
and order in a country that makes
Juan Corona and Charlie Manson
look like jaywalkers.
If you want to imagine what
the whole thing was like (which
I'm not sure you really want to
do), think of taking eight hours to
register the old way at the Old
Pavilion while being locked in
with no food. Say, how about
Harvey Hall for Sheriff?
As we were released after
midnight, the crowd across the
street with the car pool sure
seemed great. But I still have the
feeling it would have seemed even
greater if I had been in it from the
start.

bladders.

Finally we were led out for
booking into a beautiful empty
auditorium with pale green walls.
You know, the color of the faded
plastic plants in Denny's. They
went great with the
chocolate-fudge colored curtains.
Of course, prisons aren't build for
aesthetics.
At dingy brown desks, 12
officers sat in front of typewriters
with long lines of people. Another
three lines were having their

fingerprints taken. There was
another line on the stage getting
their mugshots taken, with
another just sitting along the wall
doing nothing.
It looked familiar. "Hey Bill!"
I called out to a friend, "I thought
you pre-reged."
Along the wall people were
starting to sing "We Shall
Overcome". A sergeant came up
who looked like a seedy Jack
Webb. "Okay, you guys you play
ball with us, we'll play ball with
you; you want to make it tough,
we can make it tough."
Kids
We shut up. Then they
rounded up the juveniles and led
them out. We gave them a
standing ovation. One of us
looked at an officer and asked,
"What's the matter with kids
these days?"
There were six doors to the
auditorium and with incredible
efficiency an officer being paid
time and a half overtime manned
each one so us heavy rads
wouldn't escape.
We moved in a circle. First we
waited. Then we had our mugshot
taken. Then we waited. Then we
waited some more. Then we were
taken to a typewriter where they
asked probing questions about
your nicknames and tattoos. Then
we waited, waited some more, and
waited even more. Then we were
fingerprinted.
Then we had an interview with
a guy who got you out on your
own recognizance. We waited
about an hour to see him and then
he just took down your Student
I.D. number. Just like cashing a
check at the bookstore, huh?

They began taking names in
order from the bottom of the pile.
These were the people who had
waited the longest. Then for some
reason they began taking people's
names from the top so that the
people in the middle really got
screwed.
Democracy?
"Hey, 1 thought I was next,"
one guy near me said.
"What do you think this is, a
democracy?" I asked.
A detective was asked what the
tac squad did when they weren't
busting up riots.
"They hang," he replied doing
a great gorilla impersonation.
Most police seemed as friendly
as they could in an overworked
bureaucracy. Of course, receiving
time and a half couldn't have hurt
their spirits. But that was the
only real downer. Here were these
guys helpfully working for law
and order in a country that makes
Juan Corona and Charlie Manson
look like jaywalkers.
If you want to imagine what
the whole thing was like (which
I'm not sure you really want to
do), think of taking eight hours to
register the old way at the Old
Pavilion while being locked in
with no food. Say, how about
Harvey Hall for Sheriff?
As we were released after
midnight, the crowd across the
street with the car pool sure
seemed great. But I still have the
feeling it would have seemed even
greater if I had been in it from the
start.

Even though I was supporting
the student strike, I attended,
reluctantly, Professor Donald
Tamm's course on "The Bust"
Friday afternoon.
Here's my student evaluation
of the course, which seemed
definitely over-enrolled.
As I stood encircled by tac
squad outside Stickney's at Town
and Country Village the first thing
that entered my head was almost
a rock. "Crazies!" I thought.
Then I had my first reaction to
police repression: "Boy, am I ever
stupid letting this happen."
I took a recently purchased
bumper sticker out of my pocket
and gazed at the big orange
letters. McCloskey. "Ain't it great
to be working through the
system?" I thought to myself.
I noticed a big trash pile at the
center of our group where people
were depositing things they didn't
want cluttering their pockets
while in jail. A bullet. Two hash
pipes. A joint.
National Anthem
When people started singing
the national anthem with their
fists in the air, although this
sounds corny, it was as if our
insides became interlocked against
the encirclement and poured over
the helmets and riot sticks to our
supporters.
I suppose it was a mixture of
the emotional intensity of the
confrontation combined with a
frightening feeling of power that
while under arrest you had
reclaimed a song of liberty and
resistance.
When we got done with the
anthem, we were drained of the
heavy emotionality, but it seemed
to have cauterized our spirits. We
seemed almost to bounce with
buoyant resiliency.
Busing
We were led onto the bus and
locked in.
"Okay," one guy yelled,
"when we get there, let's win this
one for the Gipper."
Soon everybody was clapping,
yelling, and laughing, "Beat Cal!
Beat Cal!"
Someone came up with "Don't
Bus Schoolchildren" which also
quickly became a favorite.
One guy suggested we make
200 reservations for a reunion at
Stickney's the next night. He
added that we should drive, since
blocking a thoroughfare with your
car is the American way.
The bus ride to Milpitas
consisted of anti-war cheers,
bewildered motorists wondering
what the hell 25 fists were
sticking out a bus window for,
and one giant "Fuck Lockheed"
as we passed their plant.
Inside the Elmwood parking
lot our driver and officer left.
"We've taken the bus!"
"What should we do with it?"

"Let's live on it!"
Pandemonium.
Women
A bus of arrested women also
rolled into the compound. A
matronly matron strolled out
from the jail.
People began whistling until
one more-liberated guy told us if
we were going to feed her shit to
at least do it in a non-chauvinist
manner. So we just oinked.
As more buses rolled into the
parking lot, we realized the
number of arrests and started a
"Beat Maryland" cheer referring
to the numerous arrests at their
campus.
For reasons only known to the
police, the women were
transferred from their bus to
another, one by one. Each got a
standing ovation from us,
although I must confess it was not
only for being a sister in struggle.
After an hour and a half on the
bus, people were still cheering and
yelling and chanting and pounding
the roof of our bus until our
hands felt like overcooked
spaghetti.
The only problem was our
bladders.

the student strike, I attended,
reluctantly, Professor Donald
Tamm's course on "The Bust"
Friday afternoon.
Here's my student evaluation
of the course, which seemed
definitely over-enrolled.
As I stood encircled by tac
squad outside Stickney's at Town
and Country Village the first thing
that entered my head was almost
a rock. "Crazies!" I thought.
Then I had my first reaction to
police repression: "Boy, am I ever
stupid letting this happen."
I took a recently purchased
bumper sticker out of my pocket
and gazed at the big orange
letters. McCloskey. "Ain't it great
to be working through the
system?" I thought to myself.
I noticed a big trash pile at the
center of our group where people
were depositing things they didn't
want cluttering their pockets
while in jail. A bullet. Two hash
pipes. A joint.
National Anthem
When people started singing
the national anthem with their
fists in the air, although this
sounds corny, it was as if our
insides became interlocked against
the encirclement and poured over
the helmets and riot sticks to our
supporters.
I suppose it was a mixture of
the emotional intensity of the
confrontation combined with a
frightening feeling of power that
while under arrest you had
reclaimed a song of liberty and
resistance.
When we got done with the
anthem, we were drained of the
heavy emotionality, but it seemed
to have cauterized our spirits. We
seemed almost to bounce with
buoyant resiliency.
Busing
We were led onto the bus and
locked in.
"Okay," one guy yelled,
"when we get there, let's win this
one for the Gipper."
Soon everybody was clapping,
yelling, and laughing, "Beat Cal!
Beat Cal!"
Someone came up with "Don't
Bus Schoolchildren" which also
quickly became a favorite.
One guy suggested we make
200 reservations for a reunion at
Stickney's the next night. He
added that we should drive, since
blocking a thoroughfare with your
car is the American way.
The bus ride to Milpitas
consisted of anti-war cheers,
bewildered motorists wondering
what the hell 25 fists were
sticking out a bus window for,
and one giant "Fuck Lockheed"
as we passed their plant.
Inside the Elmwood parking
lot our driver and officer left.
"We've taken the bus!"
"What should we do with it?"

"Let's live on it!"
Pandemonium.
Women
A bus of arrested women also
rolled into the compound. A
matronly matron strolled out
from the jail.
People began whistling until
one more-liberated guy told us if
we were going to feed her shit to
at least do it in a non-chauvinist
manner. So we just oinked.
As more buses rolled into the
parking lot, we realized the
number of arrests and started a
"Beat Maryland" cheer referring
to the numerous arrests at their
campus.
For reasons only known to the
police, the women were
transferred from their bus to
another, one by one. Each got a
standing ovation from us,
although I must confess it was not
only for being a sister in struggle.
After an hour and a half on the
bus, people were still cheering and
yelling and chanting and pounding
the roof of our bus until our
hands felt like overcooked
spaghetti.
The only problem was our
bladders.
Interior Decoration
Finally we were led out for
booking into a beautiful empty
auditorium with pale green walls.
You know, the color of the faded
plastic plants in Denny's. They
went great with the
chocolate-fudge colored curtains.
Of course, prisons aren't build for
aesthetics.
At dingy brown desks, 12
officers sat in front of typewriters
with long lines of people. Another
three lines were having their

fingerprints taken. There was
another line on the stage getting
their mugshots taken, with
another just sitting along the wall
doing nothing.
It looked familiar. "Hey Bill!"
I called out to a friend, "I thought
you pre-reged."
Along the wall people were
starting to sing "We Shall
Overcome". A sergeant came up
who looked like a seedy Jack
Webb. "Okay, you guys you play
ball with us, we'll play ball with
you; you want to make it tough,
we can make it tough."
Kids
We shut up. Then they
rounded up the juveniles and led
them out. We gave them a
standing ovation. One of us
looked at an officer and asked,
"What's the matter with kids
these days?"
There were six doors to the
auditorium and with incredible
efficiency an officer being paid
time and a half overtime manned
each one so us heavy rads
wouldn't escape.
We moved in a circle. First we
waited. Then we had our mugshot
taken. Then we waited. Then we
waited some more. Then we were
taken to a typewriter where they
asked probing questions about
your nicknames and tattoos. Then
we waited, waited some more, and
waited even more. Then we were
fingerprinted.
Then we had an interview with
a guy who got you out on your
own recognizance. We waited
about an hour to see him and then
he just took down your Student
I.D. number. Just like cashing a
check at the bookstore, huh?

They began taking names in
order from the bottom of the pile.
These were the people who had
waited the longest. Then for some
reason they began taking people's
names from the top so that the
people in the middle really got
screwed.
Democracy?
"Hey, 1 thought I was next,"
one guy near me said.
"What do you think this is, a
democracy?" I asked.
A detective was asked what the
tac squad did when they weren't
busting up riots.
"They hang," he replied doing
a great gorilla impersonation.
Most police seemed as friendly
as they could in an overworked
bureaucracy. Of course, receiving
time and a half couldn't have hurt
their spirits. But that was the
only real downer. Here were these
guys helpfully working for law
and order in a country that makes
Juan Corona and Charlie Manson
look like jaywalkers.
If you want to imagine what
the whole thing was like (which
I'm not sure you really want to
do), think of taking eight hours to
register the old way at the Old
Pavilion while being locked in
with no food. Say, how about
Harvey Hall for Sheriff?
As we were released after
midnight, the crowd across the
street with the car pool sure
seemed great. But I still have the
feeling it would have seemed even
greater if I had been in it from the
start.
