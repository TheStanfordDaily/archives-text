John "Babbacombe Lee was taken to the
gallows three times and three tunes survived
the attempts to hang him.
1 he story that surrounds i his tact was
written as an autobiography in Lloyd's
Weekly News. 1907.
Dave Swarbnck found a curled, yellowing
bundle of these papers buried in a Ware
antique shop; they vvi're hound and signed by
John Lec.himseit.
Now the story of' Ihe Man I hjjy Could
Not Hang has been brought to life again In c
FAIRPORTCONVkN'iION i thCir new
album Babbacombe Lee. A photograph of
John Ie and his mother has been used for
the front cover.
Songs on Side I cover John's reflections
on his boyhood; his introduction to Miss
Keyse and I he Glen; his life in the Navy, by
tar his happiest period; and his illness, which
finally resulted in his return to the service of
Miss Keyse. I his side ends with the
beginning of tragedy : the brutal senselessness
of the apparent criminal who slays his kind
old mistress.
Side 2 continues the tragedy. John was
hardly more than a bewildered observer at his
own trial. He waits three sad weeks in the
'condemned cell for his last night on earth.
When arrives, a strange, prophetic dream
jromes to him. helping him to bear the strain
of the next days ordeal, as scaffold and its
crew try in vain three to take Ins hie.
