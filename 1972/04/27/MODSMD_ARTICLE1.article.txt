# Nixon Refuses To Halt Air Raids Over North
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
President Nixon announced on
nationwide television last night that he
would continue U.S. air and naval
bombardment of North Vietnam until
that country ends its "naked and
unprovoked aggression" upon South
Vietnam.
The President also revealed that
another 20,000 American troops
would be withdrawn from Vietnam by
July 1, bringing the total number of
troops down to 49,000 from a high of
534,000 three years ago.
Speaking from the Oval Room at
the White House, Nixon said that U.S.
Ambassador William C. Porter would
be returning to the Paris Peace Talks
today "to get on with the constructive
business of making peace." He added

that "we are not resuming the Paris
talks simply in order to hear more
enemy propaganda and bombast from
the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
delegates."
In discussing the talks, Nixon said
"we have offered extremely generous
terms for peace." He called for "peace
with honor for both sides." He also
said that the priority item for the U.S.
at the talks "will be to get the enemy
to halt his invasion of South Vietnam,
and to return the American prisoners
of-war."
Impending Invasion
Nixon said that even though intel
ligence reports had warned last month
of the impending North Vietnamese
offensive, the U.S. had "deliberately
refrained" from responding militarily
to the build-up for what he called a
"massive invasion."
The President called continued
bombing of the North "essential" to
protect the American troops remaining
in Vietnam and "to prevent the
imposition of a Communist regime"
on an "unwilling" South Vietnam.
He warned that "if one country,
armed with the most modern weapons
by other countries, can invade another
nation and succeed in conquering it,
other countries will be encouraged to
do exactly the same thing."
Nixon said that "the South Viet
namese are fighting courageously and
well in their self-defense and have
made great progress, and are now
bearing the brunt of the battle." He
also said that there are "no United
States ground troops involved" in
combating the North Vietnamese of
fensive.
Based on reports from the U.S.
military commander in Vietnam, Gen.
Creighton Abrams, the President said
"Vietnamization has proved itself

sufficiently that we can continue our
program of withdrawing American
forces." He expressed hope that draft
calls would be reduced "to zero by
next year."
Hard Fighting
Nixon said that while Abrams'
cable predicts that there will be
"several more weeks of very hard
fighting ... he is convinced that if we
continue to provide air and naval
support, the enemy will fail in its
desperate gamble."
According to Nixon, Abrams re
ported that the South Vietnamese
forces are inflicting "very heavy
casualties on the invading force." The
President compalined that the North
Vietnamese had "indiscriminately
shelled civilian population centers."
Although he did not specifically
mention bombing strikes against Hanoi
and Haiphong, the President said that
recent air and naval bombing of the
North has "been directed only against
military targets supporting the inva
sion of the South. They will not stop
until that invasion stops."
Nixon said, "We will not be
defeated and we will not surrender our
friends to Communist aggression." He
added that "if we now let down our
friends, we shall surely be letting down
ourselves and our future as well. If we
persist, history will thank America for
her courage and her vision at this
testing time."
No Bomb Halt
The President rejected proposals
that the U.S. stop its bombing as a
condition for a North Vietnamese
return to the Peace Talks, saying that
"they sold that package to the United
States once before, in 1968. We are
not going to buy it again in 1972." He
had been referring to a November
1968 agreement that led then-
President Lyndon Johnson to suspend
the bombing of the North.
A crowd of some 200 people
watched the President's speech on two
portable televisions in Memorial
Church. Frequent heckling of the
speech was quieted by the more
earnest listeners in the auduence.
As soon as Nixon's speech con
cluded, Earl Martin of the Concerned
Asian Scholars delivered a parody of
the speech. Shortly afterward, a crowd
of 50-75 moved out of Mem Chu and
carried an effigy of Nixon to the front
of President Lyman's office. As the
effigy was set afire, one woman in the
audience cried out that "this is for all
the women and children who have
been burned" by the bombing.
The crowd then rushed through the
Quad, past the Durand (Aero and
Astro) Building and into White Plaza,
where they dispersed. A fire was set in
a trash dumpster at the rear of
Building 120 (Sociology) but was
extinguished without damage to the
building. No windows were reported
broken.
A meeting will be held at 10 a.m.
today in the Women's Center to plan
for Stanford's part in a nationwide
moratorium called for May 4 to
protest the continued escalation of the
Vietnam War. The moratorium will be
held on the second anniversary of the
killing of four students at Kent State.
