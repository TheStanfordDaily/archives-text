## Chicken-Head Down On The Farm 
###

There was once a boy who went to Stanford, but he
was different from everyone else there because he
walked around wearing a chicken head.
This chicken head was the boy's prize. He had found
it discarded in a dumpster, and with a little work, had
made its colored neoprene-rubber feathers, comb, and
beak look like new.
Everywhere the boy went, whatever he did, he always
wore the chicken head. But he was never happy. People
madefunofhim; they called him names.
"Enough of this foolishness!" said the boy's advisor.
"You are beginning to tire me with this chicken head
business."
The boy went into a classroom but few people paid
him much attention, so busy were they with their
notetaking. The professor looked up from his lecture
and addressed the boy: "Is this a disruption?"
"Not really," replied the boy, "I'm just here to get an
education."
"Why don't you leave us alone so we can leani and
study and go to graduate school?" screamed another.
"It seems," commented the professor, "that you're
out of place here. Try the Political Science department
— they may be more used to chicken heads."
Political Science
So the boy went into Poly Sci. He made chicken head
comments in class and wrote chicken head papers and
finals. But he was soon called into the Department
Chairman's office.
"Young man," the Chairman began, "I think I can
respect you for your chicken-headed attitudes, but
Political Science has no use for you. We are a serious
discipline. Why don't you explore your life style through
the drama? That is all the help I can give you."

With renewed hope, the boy set out to gain
recognition and appreciation in drama. But again he met
resistance, derision, and antagonism.
Drama students called him childish. "He's such a
simpleton!" they said. "Ignore him; let us get back to
our work," they said.
Dusk was apprt aching as the boy passed by the office
of the Stanford Daily. He went inside on the off chance
that he could find acceptance here.
'There's no place for chicken heads here!" came the
reply. "Our readers want quality news reporting, timely
features, and astute political analyses."
The long, slender shadow depicting a hunched-over
figure marked the presence of the boy as he sadly made
his way up White Plaza.
There he stumbled into an evening political rally and
immediately became the target of harsh criticism, as
speaker after speaker pointed and said: "Here is an
example of the apathetic masses concerned only with
personal frivolity and not the collective struggle!"
Dazed and fighting a battle within himself, the boy
staggered into UGLY and sank wearily into an armchair.
Looking up, he saw an old high school buddy.
"Too much studying getting you down?" the friend
asked. "I get a little looney too this time of
year . . . helps to let off steam."
"No. . . . you . . . you don't understand," stammered
the boy. "This is ME."
The friend's compassion melted into confusion, then
anger: "You can't be a chicken head all the time. You've
got to work within the system . . . integrate your
personality with all the others on campus. Selfish fool —
you'll get nowhere like that."
Late that night, the boy sat in his darkened room.

Slowly, he removed his chicken head and looked al his
real face in the mirror.
Waves of shame engulfed him. "Can't you live with
yourself?" his id seemed to ask. "But which self is really
you?" queried his superego.
"I've got to work within the system." the boy said
aloud, then repeated somewhat more firmly.
That was the start of a new life for the boy. New,
because nobody recognized him without his chicken
head.
He studied, took tests, went to rallies, joined KZSU,
the Daily, and A Phi O. Masters degree followed BA,
then a doctorate. Success seemed imminent.
Yet all this time, some unspoken shame forced the
boy to keep hir. chicken head, locked away safely in an
old trunk.
At last, he was given a teaching position at Stanford,
after spending 15 years there in various academic
pursuits.
"I think the time has come," thought the boy/now
Assistant Professor, "to throw my old chicken head
away." Not wanting to jeopardize his new career, he
waited till dark, then moved furtively to a dumpster and
parted from his unhappy past.
The following day, while giving his first lecture in
class, he was interrupted by the arrival of a student
wearing a chicken head . . . his old chicken head.
Quickly recovering his composure, the Assistant
Professor cleared his throat and spoke: "Young man,
you do not belong here. I cannot tolerate such an
interruption. Please leave immediately."
The change was complete, but what was gained?
