# Correction

### 
In a front-page story printed
in the Daily's Saturday, April
22, special issue, the Daily
incorrectly wrote that "Police
Chief James Zurcher was
participating in a celebrity golf
tournament, and was not pn
the scene" of the 207 arrests
on Friday, April 21 at El
Camino Real and
Embarcadero.
While Zurcher was golfing
between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. on
Friday, he had arrived at the
police command post in the
Palo Alto Civic Center before
the mass arrests were made,
and concurred in the decision
to make the arrests.
Before printing the golf
information, the Daily called
the Palo Alto police watch
commander on Friday night,

asked him to inform Zurcher
of the information the Daily
possed, and left instructions
for Zurcher to call the
newspaper if he had any denial,
addition, or correction to the
printed information.
When Zurcher, who
acknowledges receipt of a
message from the Daily, failed
to reply, the Daily published
the story without his
comments on Saturday night.
