# Three Faculty Members Elected To National Academy Of Sciences
## 
### 
Three Stanford faculty
members were among 75 scientists
elected to the nation's most
distinguished scientific society,
the National Academy of
Sciences.
The election of radiologist
Henry S. Kaplan, mathematician
Samuel Karlin, and biologist
Donald Kennedy was announced
by the academy Tuesday, April
25. Also included were two
former Stanford faculty members,
psychologist Leon Festinger of
the New School for Social
Research, and biologist Reed
Rollins of Harvard.
The newly elected faculty
members bring to 42 the total

number of Stanford professors in
the 950-member academy. The
academy now elects 75 new
members instead of 50 each year
with the object of increasing its
membership in the medical and
behavioral sciences.
Professor Kaplan heads the
Radiology Department of the
School of Medicine, a post he has
held since joining the University
in 1948. He received the M.D.
degree from the University of
Chicago's Rush Medical College.
He was recently named to the
endowed D'Amrogio
professorship for faculty members
engaged in cancer research.
Dr. Kaplan conceived and

pioneered the use of linear
accelerators for medical purposes.
The technique has resulted in
dramatic gains in cancer
treatment, particularly Hodgkin's
Disease and other malignant
lymphomas. Among numerous
honors for his work he received
the 1969 Atoms for Peace Award.
Polish-born mathematician
Professor Karlin specializes in
applications of probability theory
to inventory and production
problems, and to physical and
biological models. He is the
author or coauthor of several
books on mathematics and
statistics. A graduate of the
Illinois Institute of Technology

with a doctoral degree from
Princeton, he joined the Stanford
faculty in 1956 after teaching at
Calteeh and Princeton.
Professor Kennedy has headed
Stanford's Department of
Biological Sciences since 1965
after joining the faculty in 1960.
He earned the A.B. and Ph.D.
degrees at Harvard. He has
coauthored a textbook on The
Biology of Organisms and has
written numerous papers for
scientific journals on the
physiology of the nervous system
and sense organs.
Chairman of the faculty's
Advisory Board, he is a member
of the Faculty Senate.
