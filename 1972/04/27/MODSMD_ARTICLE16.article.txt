# Student Senate Reroutes Funds; Vote On Mascot Petition Debated
## 
### 
The Student Senate voted
Tuesday night to give $380 of
previously budgeted money to
ASSU President Doug McHenry
and Senate Chairman James
Jefferson so that they may attend
a black student leaders conference
in Washington D.C. on Friday.
At the meeting which was
attended by only eight senators,
the Senate voted to transfer
money from the Committee Fund
into the Administration Fund in
order to finance the trip.
A roll call vote was taken on
the issue after the Senate voted to
reconsider the first vote by show
of hands. The roll call vote was
tied four to four, and Jefferson
then voted yes to break the tie.
McHenry explained that the
conference has been called by
black congressmen for black
student leaders from

predominately white schools. The
student leaders will discuss mutual
problems and then make
recommendations for change
upon their return.
The Senate could vote to
reconsider its decision to give
McHenry and Jefferson the
money, but it would take a
two-thirds majority to do so. The
Senate is meeting tonight
however, and McHenry and
Jefferson will already be on their
way to Washington.
The Senate also debated the
fate of the mascot referendum.
McHenry reported he received a
petition with 600 hundred
signatures which asks that the
question "Do you favor the
retention of the Indian as the
official Stanford mascot?" be
placed on an election ballot.
Several senators wanted to

know why the referendum would
not be on today's runoff election
ballot. McHenry said that putting
the mascot referendum on the
ballot would violate an earlier
agreement made by the Senate
with Native American students
not to put the question to a
student vote.
McHenry said "I will not put
this referendum on any
ballot ... as long as I am in office
there will be no motherfucking
election on this question."

McHenry is required to put
valid petitions on the ballot of a
regular election, or he must call a
special election for it. Several
senators felt the Constitution
should be upheld.
Student senator Dan
Cummings said, "The alumni, the
Athletic Department, the Council
of Presidents, the Student Senate,
and the administration have all
had a say in the future of the
Indian Mascot. I don't see why
students shouldn't have a say."
