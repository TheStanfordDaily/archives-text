# P.A. Council Delays Rezoning Of May field School Site
## 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council has delayed action again on the
controversial office-YMCA construction at the Mayfield Sciiool
site.
Monday night the Council deferred action on Stanford's request
for a zone change to permit the construction. It set June 19 as the
new date for the public hearing on the question.
The development, on Stanford land, at the intersection of Page
Mill Road and El Camino Real, would replace the Mayfield
continuation high school with two high-rise offibe buildings, a
YMCA, and a parking structure.
Liberals and radicals have vigorously opposed the proposal on a
variety of grounds, and the Planning Commission has
recommended against the project.
