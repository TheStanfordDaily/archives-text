### 
Robert E. Freelen, 37, acting
dean of students, has been named
associate director of University
relations and director of
governmental relations, effective
May 8.
His selection was announced
by University Relations Director
Frank Newman.
A former student bodv
president, Freelen earned his
bachelor of arts degree in political
science here in 1957 and his
master si n business
administration two years later.
Freelen came to Stanford in
1961 as associate general secretary
and director of the Stanford
Annual Fund, then served as
director of programs for the
Alumni Association.
He was named associate dean
of students in 1969 and director
of student services in September
1970.
His new position formerly was
held by Newman.
Robert E. Freelan has been
acting dean of students for over a
year and was one of the main
candidates for the permanent
position of dean of students.
However, James W. Lyons, Dean
of students at Haverford College,
was chosen for the post beginning
in July. This left Freelan without
a University post.
University President Richard
W. Lyman is expected to appoint
an acting dean of students in the
near future to serve until Lyons
becomes dean of student affairs in
July.
