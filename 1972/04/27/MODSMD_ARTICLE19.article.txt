# Fine Arts Quartet: Truly Magnificent
## 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
An audience at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium was treated to a great
performance Tuesday night when
The Fine Arts Quartet gave the
first of three concerts here. If it
was any indication of how the
other performances will be, you'd
better buy tickets now.
The first piece they played was
Haydn's "Quartet in E" Major",
op. 76 No. 6. It is one of Haydn's
most romantic compositions.
Although it retains the clarity of
classical music, it adds a flavor of
romantic expression.
The performers managed both
facets of the piece beautifully.
Leonard Sorkin, first violinist,
began with a clear, but sensitive
series of runs and arpeggios. His
turns were graceful. He used a
subtle rubato, changing only a
little from the beat, but enough to
add feeling.
Abram Loft, second violinist,
then came in in a contra-puntal
line, filled with showy runs which
he did crisply. The high point of
the movement was in the fugato
passage near the end. All four
instruments swelled gradually, yet
completely together, to a brilliant
forte. Each part had a different
line; each melody came out
distinctly. Yet they all fit
together.
Extra Expressiveness
The second movement was
even better. It is a fantasia, an
adagio that lends itself to extra
expressiveness. It's the kind of
music you'd expect to hear as the
Little Match Girl trudged through
the snow in the evening. The
cellist, George Sokin, had a
pathetic melody underlying
Sorkin's. He wrung every bit of
emotion he could out of the line,
while still keeping close to the
beat. Even his scales, which
gathered momentum as they
ascended, were perfect both
interpretatively and technically.
What was most amazing
throughout the piece was the
remarkable synchronization. Even
where the emotion sounded
spontaneous, obviously the
performers had carefully worked
out their waits, accelerandos, and
dynamics. The parallel thirds in
the second movement between
the two violins never went skew.

In the many small erescendos
and diminuendos in the fourth
movement, each instrument
changed its tone at the same rate,
so no performer ever stuck out.
The dynamics were never
over-stated, but the performers
still put in expression necessary to
show how they felt.
The next selection by Charles
Wuorinen was interesting, if not
enjoyable. His quartet verges on
atonal, but every once in a while
there is a recognizable chord or
key. The only things that really
keep the selection unified are the
motifs which reappear at
unpredictable times in different
voices. Unfortunately, the piece is
too long to hang together, as it
seems to go nowhere between
motifs.
Terribly Taxing
It must, however, be a terribly
taxing piece to play. Because of
the different tones, ranging from
atonal to harmonic to nonsensical,
the notes must always be clear to
give the proper feeling. The piece
is full of fast pizzicatos bursting in
after and during smooth passages.
There are even note slides where
the performer has to sli-i-de down
a string.
The quartet did a brilliant job.
Bernard Zaslav, the violist, stood
out in the first movement. His fast
pizzicato passage suddenly
changed to a hurried run, full of
precise double stops.
The second movement was, for
me, the most boring. It is long,
and although it contains
appropriate motifs, it does not
hold together. Much of it was
tedious, even if one listened only
to hear the skill of the performers.
There were several good
moments. At one point, all the
strings landed on one note, a
different one in each case, and
"buzzed" on it, gradually
crescendoing to create a terribly
suspense-filled moment.
Unfortunately, the moment never
came, nor did a sudden let-down
from it. The music just petered
off again.
Later in the movement, each
instrument took up a different
motif to create a strange kind of
counterpoint. They were working
at odds, yet they were together. It
took consummate skill for them

to retain the unity they did.
The third movement was more
conventional in style, with several
distinct melodies. The performers
kept the audience tense
throughout. There was always a
feeling of rushing, like a busy city
street.
The movement let the players
show off their techniques in the
rapid passages. Sorkin was
especially precise in his runs. He
was the best of the performers in
the movement.
The high point in the program
came after intermission, when
clarinetist Mitchell Lurie joined
the group for the Brahms
"Quintet in B Minor", op. 115.
The selection is a beautiful one. It
combines the richness of Brahms
with at times a quasi-classical
preciseness.
The performers matched the
brilliance of the composition.
Their technique was flawless, their
interpretation exquisite. The first
movement was the most
enjoyable; the players covered a
spectrum of emotion and
technical tricks.
Again what struck me the most
about the strings' technique was
their remarkable precision.
Especially in Brahms, where the
emotion in the composition
demands broad rubatos and
impetuous dynamics, the

musicians remained synchronized.
The parallel violins crescendoed
together, waited together at the
tops of phrases, and played
together with the tempo.
Lurie did justice to the group.
His tones were pure. He was at
once gentle and forceful. He
dexterously switched between
being the focal instrument and
melting into the group, to the
point that it was hard to pick out
a woodwind sound.
The second movement was the
best for Lurie. He had both a
beautiful melodic line and showy
arpeggios to play with. His
melodic line was filled with
pathos. He used small
accelerandos and split-second
pauses to give a brilliant effect.
Then he would go into several
measures of arpeggios and turns
that he executed perfectly.
Although his technique stood
out in those passages, he never
lost the emotion he held in the
melodic line. His turns were
flirtatious but never flippant. His
jumps were clear but never
wooden.
The third movement was an
abrupt change from the romantic
second. The performers played it
lightly, with a grace and
refinement one would expect in
Haydn, not Brahms. Their
interpretation created a new

dimension for the movement.
They traded off melodies as
playfully as the Globetrotters
trade off a basketball, and with
three times the grace.
The final movement is a series
of pictures of melodies, with
pauses between each new theme
and development. Although the
images varied, the beauty of the
playing remained constant. Sokin
was especially good. His arpeggios
were sharp. They gathered
momentum without substantially
speeding up. He paused just
before the end of his passages,
leaving the audience hanging on
his next note.
Each voice took up different
themes. Each one did them
wonderfully. To describe such a
performance is hard. Any reader is
bound to get sick of too many
"brilliants" and "fantastics." The
only way to understand really
how fine the Fine Arts Quartet is
is to see them. There will be two
more performances in Dinkelspiel,
one on Friday at 8, and one on
Sunday at 2:30. It'll be well
worth your while to take a few
hours to hear them.
(Tickets for the two remaining
Fine Arts Quartet concerts are

for students. Student rush tickets
at $2 each will be sold 15 minutes
