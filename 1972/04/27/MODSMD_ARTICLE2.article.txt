# C—15 Report Due Soon
## All—Student Judicial System Possible 
### JIM WASCHER Second of two parts 
The Committee of 15 (C-15) may
soon recommend that students alone
should set the penalties for their
fellow students' violations of Univer
sity policies. This would be the fust
time since 1966 that an all-student
panel would decide such sanctions.
Hearing officers similar to those of
the current Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) are also a probable part of any
proposed system.
This is the consensus of members of
the C-15's Subcommittee on Alterna
tive Systems, which has been consider
ing options for the new system the
Committee is expected to propose this
quarter.
A system incorporating both an
all-student penalty-setting panel, and
hearing officers would be a compro
mise between student and administra
tion proposals.
Twice A Week
The C-15 is now meeting twice a
week in its attempts to have a proposal
ready by June for consideration by the
president, the Faculty Senate, and the
student body. Committee Chairman
Frederick Crawford, professor of elec
trical engineering, says the C-15 had
previously been averaging two meet
ings per month.
The Alternative Systems Subcom
mittee, which submitted its report
this month, was formed by the full
committee in response to a January 10
letter from President Richard Lyman
and an April 7-8, 1971 ASSU referen
dum.
Lyman's letter asked that C-15
"provide a judicial system which is
capable of processing typical current
caseloads, and which, while not
excluding student participation, elimi
nates the necessity for the cooperation
of student government in constituting
the judicial system."
Special Assistant to the President
John Schwartz, a member of the
subcommittee, said that both requests
resulted from Lyman's displeasure
with what he saw as major defects in
the Stanford Judicial Council (SJC).

Schwartz said Lyman felt that the
SJC was "incapable of handling the
caseload typically generated" and
complained that it had been "totally
emasculated" when the ASSU Senate
had refused last fall to co-operate in
the selection of the SJC's student
members.
Students Only
The ASSU referendum, which pass
ed 1929 - 1186, called for establish
ment of a judicial panel "composed
only of students, or of both students
and faculty if and only if full
reciprocation exists with respect to the
promulgation or enforcement of regu
lation concerning faculty conduct."
Although the subcommittee report
gives considerable attention to the
pros and cons of including the faculty
within the system's jurisdiction, Chair
man Solomon Feferman, mathematics
and philosophy professor, concedes
that "I don't think there's a chance for
a reciprocal system."
Hearing Officers
Several subcommittee members
mentioned the likelihood of "incor
porating hearing officers" into a new
system. The subcommittee report says
that "in the CJP procedures, efficiency
is much increased by the use of
hearing officers," thus meeting one of
Lyman's criteria.
Among the specific judicial systems
considered by the subcommittee were:
the present CJP, the ASSU Senate's
University Judicial System (UJS), and
contrasting disciplinary systems at five
universities.
In fashioning a system from these
and other options, the subcommittee
report states that the C-15 "must try
to create a new system which meets
the students and administration pro
posals as far as seems reasonable."
The UJS plan was prepared for the
ASSU Senate by Edward Hayes of the
Law School, John Bradley, a sopho
more, and John McNeece, a senior.
The UJS would be overseen by a
University Judicial Panel (UJP), which
"shall consist of a presiding judge and
two associate judges."
The presiding judge "shall be a

lawyer, who shall neither be enrolled
at nor employed by Stanford." One
associate judge would be a student
"chosen in general election of the
student body." The other would be a
faculty member chosen by the Aca
demic Council.
Both a panel of hearing officers and
a University Trial Court would come
under the supervision of the UJP.
Those charged would choose either
method. The hearing officers would
decide upon the guilt or innocence of
a defendant after a confidential
hearing and would then determine the
penalty for those found guilty.
The UJP would rule on procedural
questions for the University Trial
Court, while findings of guilt or

innocence would be left up to a jury
of seven members chosen from a pool
of 20 students. The jury pool would
be randomly selected from the student
body as a whole by the President's
Office.
Guilt or innocence would have to
be decided "by a vote of not fewer
than five of the seven Jury members,"
after a public trial. Penalty, if any,
would be set by the three-judge UJP.
McNeece says that "we believe that
this system [the UJS] is fair, reason
able and workable. We are certainly
not trying to form a system which
would never hand down a conviction.
It bothers me that some members of
the C-15 show such over-concern for
simple, cold efficiency."

letter from President Richard Lyman
and an April 7-8, 1971 ASSU referen
dum.
Lyman's letter asked that C-15
"provide a judicial system which is
capable of processing typical current
caseloads, and which, while not
excluding student participation, elimi
nates the necessity for the cooperation
of student government in constituting
the judicial system."
Special Assistant to the President
John Schwartz, a member of the
subcommittee, said that both requests
resulted from Lyman's displeasure
with what he saw as major defects in
the Stanford Judicial Council (SJC).

Schwartz said Lyman felt that the
SJC was "incapable of handling the
caseload typically generated" and
complained that it had been "totally
emasculated" when the ASSU Senate
had refused last fall to co-operate in
the selection of the SJC's student
members.
Students Only
The ASSU referendum, which pass
ed 1929 - 1186, called for establish
ment of a judicial panel "composed
only of students, or of both students
and faculty if and only if full
reciprocation exists with respect to the
promulgation or enforcement of regu
lation concerning faculty conduct."
Although the subcommittee report
gives considerable attention to the
pros and cons of including the faculty
within the system's jurisdiction, Chair
man Solomon Feferman, mathematics
and philosophy professor, concedes
that "I don't think there's a chance for
a reciprocal system."
Hearing Officers
Several subcommittee members
mentioned the likelihood of "incor
porating hearing officers" into a new
system. The subcommittee report says
that "in the CJP procedures, efficiency
is much increased by the use of
hearing officers," thus meeting one of
Lyman's criteria.
Among the specific judicial systems
considered by the subcommittee were:
the present CJP, the ASSU Senate's
University Judicial System (UJS), and
contrasting disciplinary systems at five
universities.
In fashioning a system from these
and other options, the subcommittee
report states that the C-15 "must try
to create a new system which meets
the students and administration pro
posals as far as seems reasonable."
The UJS plan was prepared for the
ASSU Senate by Edward Hayes of the
Law School, John Bradley, a sopho
more, and John McNeece, a senior.
The UJS would be overseen by a
University Judicial Panel (UJP), which
"shall consist of a presiding judge and
two associate judges."
The presiding judge "shall be a

lawyer, who shall neither be enrolled
at nor employed by Stanford." One
associate judge would be a student
"chosen in general election of the
student body." The other would be a
faculty member chosen by the Aca
demic Council.
Both a panel of hearing officers and
a University Trial Court would come
under the supervision of the UJP.
Those charged would choose either
method. The hearing officers would
decide upon the guilt or innocence of
a defendant after a confidential
hearing and would then determine the
penalty for those found guilty.
The UJP would rule on procedural
questions for the University Trial
Court, while findings of guilt or

innocence would be left up to a jury
of seven members chosen from a pool
of 20 students. The jury pool would
be randomly selected from the student
body as a whole by the President's
Office.
Guilt or innocence would have to
be decided "by a vote of not fewer
than five of the seven Jury members,"
after a public trial. Penalty, if any,
would be set by the three-judge UJP.
McNeece says that "we believe that
this system [the UJS] is fair, reason
able and workable. We are certainly
not trying to form a system which
would never hand down a conviction.
It bothers me that some members of
the C-15 show such over-concern for
simple, cold efficiency."
The Committee of 15 (C-15) may
soon recommend that students alone
should set the penalties for their
fellow students' violations of Univer
sity policies. This would be the fust
time since 1966 that an all-student
panel would decide such sanctions.
Hearing officers similar to those of
the current Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) are also a probable part of any
proposed system.
This is the consensus of members of
the C-15's Subcommittee on Alterna
tive Systems, which has been consider
ing options for the new system the
Committee is expected to propose this
quarter.
A system incorporating both an
all-student penalty-setting panel, and
hearing officers would be a compro
mise between student and administra
tion proposals.
Twice A Week
The C-15 is now meeting twice a
week in its attempts to have a proposal
ready by June for consideration by the
president, the Faculty Senate, and the
student body. Committee Chairman
Frederick Crawford, professor of elec
trical engineering, says the C-15 had
previously been averaging two meet
ings per month.
The Alternative Systems Subcom

within the system's jurisdiction, Chair
man Solomon Feferman, mathematics
and philosophy professor, concedes
that "I don't think there's a chance for
a reciprocal system."
Hearing Officers
Several subcommittee members
mentioned the likelihood of "incor
porating hearing officers" into a new
system. The subcommittee report says
that "in the CJP procedures, efficiency
is much increased by the use of
hearing officers," thus meeting one of
Lyman's criteria.
Among the specific judicial systems
considered by the subcommittee were:
the present CJP, the ASSU Senate's
University Judicial System (UJS), and
contrasting disciplinary systems at five
universities.
In fashioning a system from these
and other options, the subcommittee
report states that the C-15 "must try
to create a new system which meets
the students and administration pro
posals as far as seems reasonable."
The UJS plan was prepared for the
ASSU Senate by Edward Hayes of the
Law School, John Bradley, a sopho
more, and John McNeece, a senior.
The UJS would be overseen by a
University Judicial Panel (UJP), which
"shall consist of a presiding judge and
two associate judges."
The presiding judge "shall be a

lawyer, who shall neither be enrolled
at nor employed by Stanford." One
associate judge would be a student
"chosen in general election of the
student body." The other would be a
faculty member chosen by the Aca
demic Council.
Both a panel of hearing officers and
a University Trial Court would come
under the supervision of the UJP.
Those charged would choose either
method. The hearing officers would
decide upon the guilt or innocence of
a defendant after a confidential
hearing and would then determine the
penalty for those found guilty.
The UJP would rule on procedural
questions for the University Trial
Court, while findings of guilt or

innocence would be left up to a jury
of seven members chosen from a pool
of 20 students. The jury pool would
be randomly selected from the student
body as a whole by the President's
Office.
Guilt or innocence would have to
be decided "by a vote of not fewer
than five of the seven Jury members,"
after a public trial. Penalty, if any,
would be set by the three-judge UJP.
McNeece says that "we believe that
this system [the UJS] is fair, reason
able and workable. We are certainly
not trying to form a system which
would never hand down a conviction.
It bothers me that some members of
the C-15 show such over-concern for
simple, cold efficiency."
