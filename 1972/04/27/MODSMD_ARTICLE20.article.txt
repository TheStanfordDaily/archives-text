# TV & Violence
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
Crime in the streets has risen
steadily since television programs
were first broadcast into
American homes and Stanford
psychologist Alberta Siegel
believes that television violence is
still contributing to aggressive
tendencies in children.
According to a study made by
a committee sponsored by the
Surgeon General of the United
States, the most violent shows
currently on television are "Mod
Squad" and "Mannix". Critics,
and a random sample of the
public were polled by the
committee, (consisting of Siegel
and eleven other behavioral and
social psychologists). In March,
the committee testified before a
Senate subcommittee on
communication headed by
Senator John Pastore (D-R.1.).
The committee had finished its
official report in January, but at
this hearing, members presented
personal opinions.
Siegel believes that although
television violence is not the
major cause of hostility in
children, it is "an important
contributor. The single most
important cause of violence in
children is child neglect and
abuse." Siegel claims that the
public often ignores television's
effect on people because the
effect goes unnoticed most of the
time.
Negative Effect
"My guess," she states, "is that
TV violence has a negative effect
on all child viewers, but that
countervailing forces overcome
these effects in the majority of
cases." Siegel notes that the
children affected by television
violence "are the very children
who have been predisposed to
aggression by other influences in
their lives." She says that
television may not cause violence
in children, but it can act as a
catalyst for existing violent
proclivities.
Siegel states that eliminating all
television violence is an
impractical notion, but she does
wish to see violence dealt with
more realistically. "When violence
occurs on TV," she explains,
"television ought to show the
consequences of it. If you see
death, you don't see a family
that's lost a source of support —
violence is merely done for the
sake of violence."
Television is currently
presenting children with a
distorted picture of the world:
"Children have got to learn that
there are other ways to solve
problems; this continuous use of
violence gives them a warped

notion of how people behave
toward each other," Siegel says.
Siegel, the former editor of the
Journal of Child Development,
labels television programs making
use of superfluous violence
"vulgar solutions to the problem
of entertaining the American
people." She adds: "There must
be a better way to entertain
people than by using this
incessant theme of violence."
Effects On Adults
Siegel advises thwt television
violence does not affect adults but
notes that "children become
adults soon enough. I don't think
the effects on adults are positive,
but I don't think the influence on
adults is as destructive as it is to
children. Unfortunately, it can
lead us to stereotype various
people by presenting the same
repetitious points week after
week."
The only network promising to
examine and attempt to control
the use of violence on television
was ABC. According to Siegel, the
other networks attempted to
justify their use of violence.
"They tend to say that conflict is
inherent in life and we can't have
drama without conflict," says
Siegel. "They justify some shows
as teaching respect for law and
order because, in the end, the bad
guy is punished. The networks act
as if they are showing morality
plays. Unfortunately, there's no
indication that children make any
connection between the violence
in the second minute of the show
and the punishment in the
twenty-ninth minute."
The psychologist feels that the
television industry has never been
able to regulate itself; she also
believes that the Federal
Communications Commission
"has a long way to go."
Siegel's Proposals
Siegel presented five proposals
aimed at controlling violence to
the committee: construction of an
organization independent of the
FCC to monitor TV violence,
which would issue monthly "smog
bulletins" to the public; public
boycotting of corporations
sponsoring violent television
programming; increased support
for public TV.; fellowships to be
granted to television writers and
producers to allow them traveling
privileges in Europe, Canada and
Israel in order to view the small
amount of TV violence in those
countries; and a child advocate to
be appointed to the FCC. The
child advocate would be a person
acquainted with social scientific
research who would continually
be in contact with psychologists,
educators and the public to
determine what type of television
is appropriate for children.
Siegel is apprehensive about
future television programming. "I
would expect some changes," she
says, "but I think they'll be most
evident in so-called children's TV.
Networks think that when you
talk about TV and violence,
you're referring to children's
programming. We are talking
about all programs that children
watch. Much more needs to be
done than just cleaning up the
children's hour."
The committee sampled
televisions' effect on children
from pre-school through age 10.
Siegel believes that Hollywood
affects each age group similarly: in
a negative fashion. "I'm not too
optimistic about television
programming," she sadly warns."
Television relies too heavily on
Hollywood and Hollywood is
terribly violent — this could cause
TV to be more violent because so
much television is given to films
made in Hollywood."
Perhaps Siegel has cause for
alarm. Last week, television
networks announced their new
programming for the fall;
"Mannix", "Mod Squad",
"Mission: Impossible", and
I "Hawaii Five-O" all were renewed
for another season.

for public TV.; fellowships to be
granted to television writers and
producers to allow them traveling
privileges in Europe, Canada and
Israel in order to view the small
amount of TV violence in those
countries; and a child advocate to
be appointed to the FCC. The
child advocate would be a person
acquainted with social scientific
research who would continually
be in contact with psychologists,
educators and the public to
determine what type of television
is appropriate for children.
Siegel is apprehensive about
future television programming. "I
would expect some changes," she
says, "but I think they'll be most
evident in so-called children's TV.
Networks think that when you
talk about TV and violence,
you're referring to children's
programming. We are talking
about all programs that children
watch. Much more needs to be
done than just cleaning up the
children's hour."
The committee sampled
televisions' effect on children
from pre-school through age 10.
Siegel believes that Hollywood
affects each age group similarly: in
a negative fashion. "I'm not too
optimistic about television
programming," she sadly warns."
Television relies too heavily on
Hollywood and Hollywood is
terribly violent — this could cause
TV to be more violent because so
much television is given to films
made in Hollywood."
Perhaps Siegel has cause for
alarm. Last week, television
networks announced their new
programming for the fall;
"Mannix", "Mod Squad",
"Mission: Impossible", and
I "Hawaii Five-O" all were renewed
for another season.
Crime in the streets has risen
steadily since television programs
were first broadcast into
American homes and Stanford
psychologist Alberta Siegel
believes that television violence is
still contributing to aggressive
tendencies in children.
According to a study made by
a committee sponsored by the
Surgeon General of the United
States, the most violent shows
currently on television are "Mod
Squad" and "Mannix". Critics,
and a random sample of the
public were polled by the
committee, (consisting of Siegel
and eleven other behavioral and
social psychologists). In March,
the committee testified before a
Senate subcommittee on
communication headed by
Senator John Pastore (D-R.1.).
The committee had finished its
official report in January, but at
this hearing, members presented
personal opinions.
Siegel believes that although
television violence is not the
major cause of hostility in
children, it is "an important
contributor. The single most
important cause of violence in
children is child neglect and
abuse." Siegel claims that the
public often ignores television's
effect on people because the
effect goes unnoticed most of the
time.
Negative Effect
"My guess," she states, "is that
TV violence has a negative effect
on all child viewers, but that
countervailing forces overcome
these effects in the majority of
cases." Siegel notes that the
children affected by television
violence "are the very children
who have been predisposed to
aggression by other influences in
their lives." She says that
television may not cause violence
in children, but it can act as a
catalyst for existing violent
proclivities.
Siegel states that eliminating all
television violence is an
impractical notion, but she does
wish to see violence dealt with
more realistically. "When violence
occurs on TV," she explains,
"television ought to show the
consequences of it. If you see
death, you don't see a family
that's lost a source of support —
violence is merely done for the
sake of violence."
Television is currently
presenting children with a
distorted picture of the world:
"Children have got to learn that
there are other ways to solve
problems; this continuous use of
violence gives them a warped

notion of how people behave
toward each other," Siegel says.
Siegel, the former editor of the
Journal of Child Development,
labels television programs making
use of superfluous violence
"vulgar solutions to the problem
of entertaining the American
people." She adds: "There must
be a better way to entertain
people than by using this
incessant theme of violence."
Effects On Adults
Siegel advises thwt television
violence does not affect adults but
notes that "children become
adults soon enough. I don't think
the effects on adults are positive,
but I don't think the influence on
adults is as destructive as it is to
children. Unfortunately, it can
lead us to stereotype various
people by presenting the same
repetitious points week after
week."
The only network promising to
examine and attempt to control
the use of violence on television
was ABC. According to Siegel, the
other networks attempted to
justify their use of violence.
"They tend to say that conflict is
inherent in life and we can't have
drama without conflict," says
Siegel. "They justify some shows
as teaching respect for law and
order because, in the end, the bad
guy is punished. The networks act
as if they are showing morality
plays. Unfortunately, there's no
indication that children make any
connection between the violence
in the second minute of the show
and the punishment in the
twenty-ninth minute."
The psychologist feels that the
television industry has never been
able to regulate itself; she also
believes that the Federal
Communications Commission
"has a long way to go."
Siegel's Proposals
Siegel presented five proposals
aimed at controlling violence to
the committee: construction of an
organization independent of the
FCC to monitor TV violence,
which would issue monthly "smog
bulletins" to the public; public
boycotting of corporations
sponsoring violent television
programming; increased support
for public TV.; fellowships to be
granted to television writers and
producers to allow them traveling
privileges in Europe, Canada and
Israel in order to view the small
amount of TV violence in those
countries; and a child advocate to
be appointed to the FCC. The

Effects On Adults
Siegel advises thwt television
violence does not affect adults but
notes that "children become
adults soon enough. I don't think
the effects on adults are positive,
but I don't think the influence on
adults is as destructive as it is to
children. Unfortunately, it can
lead us to stereotype various
people by presenting the same
repetitious points week after
week."
The only network promising to
examine and attempt to control
the use of violence on television
was ABC. According to Siegel, the
other networks attempted to
justify their use of violence.
"They tend to say that conflict is
inherent in life and we can't have
drama without conflict," says
Siegel. "They justify some shows
as teaching respect for law and
order because, in the end, the bad
guy is punished. The networks act
as if they are showing morality
plays. Unfortunately, there's no
indication that children make any
connection between the violence
in the second minute of the show
and the punishment in the
twenty-ninth minute."
The psychologist feels that the
television industry has never been
able to regulate itself; she also
believes that the Federal
Communications Commission
"has a long way to go."
Siegel's Proposals
Siegel presented five proposals
aimed at controlling violence to
the committee: construction of an
organization independent of the
FCC to monitor TV violence,
which would issue monthly "smog
bulletins" to the public; public
boycotting of corporations
sponsoring violent television
programming; increased support
for public TV.; fellowships to be
granted to television writers and
producers to allow them traveling
privileges in Europe, Canada and
Israel in order to view the small
amount of TV violence in those
countries; and a child advocate to
be appointed to the FCC. The
child advocate would be a person
acquainted with social scientific
research who would continually
be in contact with psychologists,
educators and the public to
determine what type of television
is appropriate for children.
Siegel is apprehensive about
future television programming. "I
would expect some changes," she
says, "but I think they'll be most
evident in so-called children's TV.
Networks think that when you
talk about TV and violence,
you're referring to children's
programming. We are talking
about all programs that children
watch. Much more needs to be
done than just cleaning up the
children's hour."
The committee sampled
televisions' effect on children
from pre-school through age 10.
Siegel believes that Hollywood
affects each age group similarly: in
a negative fashion. "I'm not too
optimistic about television
programming," she sadly warns."
Television relies too heavily on
Hollywood and Hollywood is
terribly violent — this could cause
TV to be more violent because so
much television is given to films
made in Hollywood."
Perhaps Siegel has cause for
alarm. Last week, television
networks announced their new
programming for the fall;
"Mannix", "Mod Squad",
"Mission: Impossible", and
I "Hawaii Five-O" all were renewed
for another season.
Crime in the streets has risen
steadily since television programs
were first broadcast into
American homes and Stanford
psychologist Alberta Siegel
believes that television violence is
still contributing to aggressive
tendencies in children.
According to a study made by
a committee sponsored by the
Surgeon General of the United
States, the most violent shows
currently on television are "Mod
Squad" and "Mannix". Critics,
and a random sample of the
public were polled by the
committee, (consisting of Siegel
and eleven other behavioral and
social psychologists). In March,
the committee testified before a
Senate subcommittee on
communication headed by
Senator John Pastore (D-R.1.).
The committee had finished its
official report in January, but at
this hearing, members presented
personal opinions.
Siegel believes that although
television violence is not the
major cause of hostility in
children, it is "an important
contributor. The single most
important cause of violence in
children is child neglect and
abuse." Siegel claims that the
public often ignores television's
effect on people because the
effect goes unnoticed most of the
time.
Negative Effect
"My guess," she states, "is that
TV violence has a negative effect
on all child viewers, but that
countervailing forces overcome
these effects in the majority of
cases." Siegel notes that the
children affected by television
violence "are the very children
who have been predisposed to
aggression by other influences in
their lives." She says that
television may not cause violence
in children, but it can act as a
catalyst for existing violent
proclivities.
Siegel states that eliminating all
television violence is an
impractical notion, but she does
wish to see violence dealt with
more realistically. "When violence
occurs on TV," she explains,
"television ought to show the
consequences of it. If you see
death, you don't see a family
that's lost a source of support —
violence is merely done for the
sake of violence."
Television is currently
presenting children with a
distorted picture of the world:
"Children have got to learn that
there are other ways to solve
problems; this continuous use of
violence gives them a warped

notion of how people behave
toward each other," Siegel says.
Siegel, the former editor of the
Journal of Child Development,
labels television programs making
use of superfluous violence
"vulgar solutions to the problem
of entertaining the American
people." She adds: "There must
be a better way to entertain
people than by using this
incessant theme of violence."
