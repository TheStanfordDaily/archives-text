# Worthwhile Animation Flicks
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
I had the good fortune to catch
the International Toumee of
Animation in Los Angeles last
weekend and thus can strongly
recommend in advance the
program which will be presented
in Memorial Auditorium on
Saturday at 7:00 and 9:00.
Anyone who has attended the
San Francisco Film Festival or
seen some of the shorts making
the rounds in theatres these days
might well hesitate to attend a
whole program of shorts, since the
best films in this field seem to be
those most kept from sight.
However, virtually all of the films
in this collection are noteworthy
and some are entirely remarkable.
Of the 19 shorts on the
program, close to half are from
the United States, the rest coming
from England, France, Canada,
Switzerland, Japan and the
Eastern European countries,
where the most innovative
contemporary animation is being
created. If nothing else, the
program serves as a reminder that
animation is still a vital and
growing branch of the cinema,
even if one wouldn't think so
from the evidence furnished by
television and the few animated
feature films.
Keynote of Humor
The keynote of the program is
undoubtedly humor. The
Oscar-nominated "Evolution"
from Canada most successfully
overlays its hilarity on a serious
subject somewhat, I suppose, in

the manner of the "8.C." comic
strip. "Henry Nine to Five"
magnificently continues the
tradition of Britain's deadpan
comics of the fifties and early
sixties who made their mark in
theatres and recordings.
"Funeral" is so brilliantly
gruesome it could have been
inspired by Playboy's master of the
macabre, Gahan Wilson.
On the purely visual level, the
most astonishing are "Animated
Painting," which shows, in a quick
succession of continuous images,
the process of visual creation,
"Dream of the Sphinx," which
demonstrates the very essence of
animation, and "Spotlight,"
drawn in the style of an oriental
water-color.
"Apel" ("Roll-Call") is by far
the most harrowing film on the
program, as it depicts in stark
charcoal drawings the horror of
the camps as it has not been
conveyed since Resnais' classic
"Night and Fog."
Disastrous Pied Piper
It is sad to have to report that
Jacques' Demy's latest film, "The
Pied Piper," is nearly total
disaster. Due to my general
affection for Demy, I really don't

have the heart to attack the film
too mercilously but since neither
the Chronicle nor the Examiner
saw fit even to review it, I feel the
film should not be allowed to die
without a brief obituary.
As with Demy's only previous
English-language film "Model
Shop," both the conception and
execution are embarrassing to the
exclusion of any other factor save
boredom. In "Model Shop,"
however, there was at least the
compensation for Demy
afficianados of sharing the
director's reaction to Los Angeles
and learning what happened to his
original creation Lola, even if no
news in this case would have been
better news than what we find
out.
In "The Pied Piper" the only
recognizable Demy-ism is the
opening iris shot. From that point
on, the camera work is abysmal,
as the tracking shots are awkward,
the exposure jumps from too light
to too dark, the color is grainy
and unattractive and the camera
seems permanently set up 50 feet
away from the action. Even more
surprisingly, the pace and staging
are lethargically lax.
I've never cared for Donovan

except for "Hurdy Gurdy Man"
and the first part of "Atlantis"
and there is nothing here to
encourage me to revise my
opinion. Not only the fact that
leads Jack Wild, John Hurt, and
Donovan as the Piper all wear
their hair so far in front of their
face, but also Demy's apparent
anathema to close-ups make it
impossible to tell them apart.
Only Michael Hodern, Roy
Kinnear and Keith Buckley in
supporting roles manage to briefly
relieve the tedium.
Ever since I first heard it, I've
thought "The Pied Piper of
Hamelin" to be a rather perverse
story. I even remember a time
when I was five years old when I
refused to go to a "Pied Piper
Party" in Aspen for fear that he'd
lead me up into the mountains
never to return. Unfortunately,
Demy captures little of this
perversity save for one marvellous
moment where, during an
aristocratic wedding party taking
place in the face of the threat of
the black plague, a huge rat pops
out of the elaborate wedding
cake. If only the film had been a
little more ratty and considerably
less tackv.

The Vampires," which is one of the many films in the "Tournee of
Animation," which will be shown here Saturday night in Memorial

It is sad to have to report that
Jacques' Demy's latest film, "The
Pied Piper," is nearly total
disaster. Due to my general
affection for Demy, I really don't

have the heart to attack the film
too mercilously but since neither
the Chronicle nor the Examiner
saw fit even to review it, I feel the
film should not be allowed to die
without a brief obituary.
As with Demy's only previous
English-language film "Model
Shop," both the conception and
execution are embarrassing to the
exclusion of any other factor save
boredom. In "Model Shop,"
however, there was at least the
compensation for Demy
afficianados of sharing the
director's reaction to Los Angeles
and learning what happened to his
original creation Lola, even if no
news in this case would have been
better news than what we find
out.
In "The Pied Piper" the only
recognizable Demy-ism is the
opening iris shot. From that point
on, the camera work is abysmal,
as the tracking shots are awkward,
the exposure jumps from too light
to too dark, the color is grainy
and unattractive and the camera
seems permanently set up 50 feet
away from the action. Even more
surprisingly, the pace and staging
are lethargically lax.
I've never cared for Donovan

except for "Hurdy Gurdy Man"
and the first part of "Atlantis"
and there is nothing here to
encourage me to revise my
opinion. Not only the fact that
leads Jack Wild, John Hurt, and
Donovan as the Piper all wear
their hair so far in front of their
face, but also Demy's apparent
anathema to close-ups make it
impossible to tell them apart.
Only Michael Hodern, Roy
Kinnear and Keith Buckley in
supporting roles manage to briefly
relieve the tedium.
Ever since I first heard it, I've
thought "The Pied Piper of
Hamelin" to be a rather perverse
story. I even remember a time
when I was five years old when I
refused to go to a "Pied Piper
Party" in Aspen for fear that he'd
lead me up into the mountains
never to return. Unfortunately,
Demy captures little of this
perversity save for one marvellous
moment where, during an
aristocratic wedding party taking
place in the face of the threat of
the black plague, a huge rat pops
out of the elaborate wedding
cake. If only the film had been a
little more ratty and considerably
less tackv.


ANIMATED CEMETERY — A graveyard is background for "Time Of
The Vampires," which is one of the many films in the "Tournee of
Animation," which will be shown here Saturday night in Memorial
Auditorium.
I had the good fortune to catch
the International Toumee of
Animation in Los Angeles last
weekend and thus can strongly
recommend in advance the
program which will be presented
in Memorial Auditorium on
Saturday at 7:00 and 9:00.
Anyone who has attended the
San Francisco Film Festival or
seen some of the shorts making
the rounds in theatres these days
might well hesitate to attend a
whole program of shorts, since the
best films in this field seem to be
those most kept from sight.
However, virtually all of the films
in this collection are noteworthy
and some are entirely remarkable.
Of the 19 shorts on the
program, close to half are from
the United States, the rest coming
from England, France, Canada,
Switzerland, Japan and the
Eastern European countries,
where the most innovative
contemporary animation is being
created. If nothing else, the
program serves as a reminder that
animation is still a vital and
growing branch of the cinema,
even if one wouldn't think so
from the evidence furnished by
television and the few animated
feature films.
Keynote of Humor
The keynote of the program is
undoubtedly humor. The
Oscar-nominated "Evolution"
from Canada most successfully
overlays its hilarity on a serious
subject somewhat, I suppose, in

the manner of the "8.C." comic
strip. "Henry Nine to Five"
magnificently continues the
tradition of Britain's deadpan
comics of the fifties and early
sixties who made their mark in
theatres and recordings.
"Funeral" is so brilliantly
gruesome it could have been
inspired by Playboy's master of the
macabre, Gahan Wilson.
On the purely visual level, the
most astonishing are "Animated
Painting," which shows, in a quick
succession of continuous images,
the process of visual creation,
"Dream of the Sphinx," which
demonstrates the very essence of
animation, and "Spotlight,"
drawn in the style of an oriental
water-color.
"Apel" ("Roll-Call") is by far
the most harrowing film on the
program, as it depicts in stark
charcoal drawings the horror of
the camps as it has not been
conveyed since Resnais' classic
"Night and Fog."
