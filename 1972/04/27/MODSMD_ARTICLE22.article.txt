# Colorful Fiesta Mexicana On Tour
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
Javier de Leon's Fiesta
Mexicana, currently on its fifth
tour of North America, gave a
lively performance last Friday
night at the Flint Center of
DeAnza College. Javier de Leon
went all out in recreating ancient
rituals as well as the music and
dances of Hispanic Mexico.
The evening opened with a
series of dances called "The

Dances of the Mayans and
Aztecs". The most notable of
these dances were the second,
fifth and last.
In the second dance, the
Mayans danced before the
chieftain in what is the oldest
ritual dance. This dance really
gave me a feel for the ceremonial
aspects of court life. Though he
hardly moved throughout the
piece, the chieftain remained the
focal point around which the
whole dance revolved. He wore
long luminous robes and an
enormous head-dress which
though perhaps a bit garish,
symbolized the great respect
traditionally accorded to a
chieftain.
The fifth dance, called "Dance
to the God of Fire", is the most
important Aztec ritual. In it the
High Priest offers the sacrifice. A
male dancer, wearing mysterious
black and grey colors, danced
around and through a flame set in
the middle of the stage, seeming
at some points to narrowly escape
a bum. It was almost as if he were
playing with the elements of
death and danger and thus he
provided a good contrast to the
light mood of the rest of the
performance.
Interesting Choreography
In the sixth dance, "Dance of
the Queztals", the dancers
wearing enormous fan-shaped
multi-colored head-dresses, do
honor to Queztal, the sacred bird.
This dance provided some of the
evening's most interesting
choreography. The dancers split

into two groups and stood at
opposite ends of the stage. Then
they wove in and out of each
other so that we saw only the
moving and meeting of several
large blocks of color.
Another highlight of the
evening was the comical "Dance
of the Old Men", one of the best
known dances in Mexico. Wearing
masks and carrying canes, the
dancers imitate the movements of
old men as they court and try to
inspire love in beautiful girls. The
dancers took clumsy falls, knees
chattering and bodies shaking.
The audience laughed alot and at
the end, the dancers were given
more applause than at almost any
time during the performance.
The applause for the old men
was topped only by the applause
for floreador Charro Valentino,
who performed a series of
astounding lasso stunts in which
he encircled first himself and then
another dancer as well. Later he
performed under a black light, so
that his flourescent lasso became a
beautiful pattern of vibrating light
waves.
In between the "Dance of the
Old Men" and the floreador
stunts, the Mariachi Orchestra
"Embajadores", directed bv
Aurelio Rodriguez, played
Mexican music. This was the weak
spot of 4he performance. The
music went on too long. The
orchestra was a letdown after all
the activity which preceded it.
Grande Finale
In the Grand Finale, the color
and life of the evening came to a

peak. The dancers came out one
by one, each sporting a different
beautiful Mexican costume. Then
the entire company danced the El
Jarabe.
The costumes throughout this
dance were extremely colorful.
The word "color" characterized
the whole performance. The
vibrancy not only of costume, but
also of movement in Mexican
dancing is noticeably lacking in
American dance.
After the curtain fell, I jumped

to my feet to give these dancers a
well deserved standing ovation.
The rest of what was a very stilted
audience remained seated. The
indifference on the audience's
part dampened the spirit of fun
which emanated from the dancers.
I pictured the evening's
performance in a village square,
not in a formal theater. If there
was anything wrong with the
performance, the blame was with
the surroundings, not the dancers
themselves.

wearing enormous fan-shaped
multi-colored head-dresses, do
honor to Queztal, the sacred bird.
This dance provided some of the
evening's most interesting
choreography. The dancers split

into two groups and stood at
opposite ends of the stage. Then
they wove in and out of each
other so that we saw only the
moving and meeting of several
large blocks of color.
Another highlight of the
evening was the comical "Dance
of the Old Men", one of the best
known dances in Mexico. Wearing
masks and carrying canes, the
dancers imitate the movements of
old men as they court and try to
inspire love in beautiful girls. The
dancers took clumsy falls, knees
chattering and bodies shaking.
The audience laughed alot and at
the end, the dancers were given
more applause than at almost any
time during the performance.
The applause for the old men
was topped only by the applause
for floreador Charro Valentino,
who performed a series of
astounding lasso stunts in which
he encircled first himself and then
another dancer as well. Later he
performed under a black light, so
that his flourescent lasso became a
beautiful pattern of vibrating light
waves.
In between the "Dance of the
Old Men" and the floreador
stunts, the Mariachi Orchestra
"Embajadores", directed bv
Aurelio Rodriguez, played
Mexican music. This was the weak
spot of 4he performance. The
music went on too long. The
orchestra was a letdown after all
the activity which preceded it.
Grande Finale
In the Grand Finale, the color
and life of the evening came to a

peak. The dancers came out one
by one, each sporting a different
beautiful Mexican costume. Then
the entire company danced the El
Jarabe.
The costumes throughout this
dance were extremely colorful.
The word "color" characterized
the whole performance. The
vibrancy not only of costume, but
also of movement in Mexican
dancing is noticeably lacking in
American dance.
After the curtain fell, I jumped

to my feet to give these dancers a
well deserved standing ovation.
The rest of what was a very stilted
audience remained seated. The
indifference on the audience's
part dampened the spirit of fun
which emanated from the dancers.
I pictured the evening's
performance in a village square,
not in a formal theater. If there
was anything wrong with the
performance, the blame was with
the surroundings, not the dancers
themselves.

Javier de Leon's Fiesta
Mexicana, currently on its fifth
tour of North America, gave a
lively performance last Friday
night at the Flint Center of
DeAnza College. Javier de Leon
went all out in recreating ancient
rituals as well as the music and
dances of Hispanic Mexico.
The evening opened with a
series of dances called "The

Dances of the Mayans and
Aztecs". The most notable of
these dances were the second,
fifth and last.
In the second dance, the
Mayans danced before the
chieftain in what is the oldest
ritual dance. This dance really
gave me a feel for the ceremonial
aspects of court life. Though he
hardly moved throughout the
piece, the chieftain remained the
focal point around which the
whole dance revolved. He wore
long luminous robes and an
enormous head-dress which
though perhaps a bit garish,
symbolized the great respect
traditionally accorded to a
chieftain.
The fifth dance, called "Dance
to the God of Fire", is the most
important Aztec ritual. In it the
High Priest offers the sacrifice. A
male dancer, wearing mysterious
black and grey colors, danced
around and through a flame set in
the middle of the stage, seeming
at some points to narrowly escape
a bum. It was almost as if he were
playing with the elements of
death and danger and thus he
provided a good contrast to the
light mood of the rest of the
performance.
