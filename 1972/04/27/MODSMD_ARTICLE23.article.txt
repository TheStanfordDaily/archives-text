N. Viets Attack Quang Tri
SAIGON — North Vietnamese forces using Soviet-built
tanks and heavy weapons Thursday launched major
attacks against South Vietnamese defenders on four sides
of Quang Tri City in renewed assaults below the
demilitarized zone.
Brig. Gen. Vu Van Giai, commander of the South
Vietnamese 3rd Infantry Division defending Quang Tri
province, termed the situation "extremely critical."
Senior U.S. advisers from Da Nang rushed to the battle
area in helicopters.
South Vietnamese casualties were said to range from
light to moderate.
Attacks also were launched on other fronts, including
the district towns of Bong Son on South Vietnam's
central coast and Dau Tieng, north of Saigon. At the
provincial capital of An Loc, also north of Saigon, 10
South Vietnamese were reported killed and 65 wounded
in a 1,500/ound,artillery barrage.
Quang Tri city, South Vietnam's northernmost
provincial capital, is 19 miles below the demilitarized
zone, and was among the earliest targets of the 29-day-old
enemy offensive.
U.S. 7th Fleet destroyers were called in to aid the
South Vietnamese from offshore.
In the central highlands, South Korean troops cleared
the enemy from a vital pass, opening a possible convoy
route to the imperiled highland cities.
But behind the Koreans, North Vietnamese swarmed
out of the hills into coastal Binh Dinh Province. They
seized a base, pushed into three populous districts and
opened up with rocket and mortar fire on Bong Son, a
district headquarters where an attack has long been
expected.
Columbia, Kent Protests
NEW YORK - Anti-war demonstrators at Columbia
University occupied a sixth University building last night
after President Nixon's speech on the Vietnam situation.
Some 400 persons reportedly smashed windows in a
New York City bank as the Columbia protests entered
their second week.
Some 200 persons were arrested at Kent State
University in Ohio after entering the ROTC Building on
campus yesterday. Kent State was the site of
demonstrations which took the lives of four students in
1970.
Apollo Returns Today
SPACE CENTER, Houston - Apollo 16 streaks toward a
splashdown in the South Pacific today, its commander
proclaiming: "We've seen as much in 10 days as most
people see in 10 lifetimes."
Astronauts John W. Young, Charles M. Duke Jr. and
Thomas K. Mattingly 11, aboard their command ship
Casper, will parachute to earth at 2:44 p.m. EST, 178
miles southeast of Christmas Island.
The prime recovery ship, aircraft carrier Ticonderoga,
is cruising in the splashdown zone. Weather forecasts for
the area-which is just south of the equator-call for
gentle seas, light winds, balmy temperatures and almost
unlimited visibility.
Apollo 16 is coming home with a record load of moon
rocks. Young and Duke collected 245 pounds of lunar
samples during more than 20 hours of exploring the
moon's Descartes Mountain area, a part of the
never-before visited lunar highlands. The astronauts
deployed a nuclear-powered science station which is now
sending data to earth. They also took miles of color and
black and white film during their adventure.
Amendment In Danger
SACRAMENTO — The women's equal rights amendment
to the U.S. Constitution was rejected again yesterday by a

key Senate committee after labor lobbyists argued that it
would "bring back the sweatshops" for women.
The Senate Rules Committee voted 4-0 to take under
submission a resolution ratifying the amendment. Sen.
Robert Stevens, R-Los Angeles, said he made the motion
not to ratify the amendment today "in order to keep it
alive." The same committee rejected the amendment on a
2-2 vote April 6.
Last Thursday the Assembly overwhelmingly approved
a different resolution for ratification of the amendment
on a 56-11 vote. That resolution will also go to the Rules
Committee.
John F. Henning, chief lobbyist for the AFL-CIO, led a
list of leaders from 10 labor unions who opposed the
amendment because, they said, it would in effect abolish
all of California's protective laws on wages and working
conditions for women and children.
"The employers will work these women until they
drop. We know what the realities are. We need these
laws," Henning said.
He urged shelving the amendment until the legislature
extends all so-called women's protective laws and wage
laws to men.
Muskie To Withdraw?
WASHINGTON — Sen. Edmund S. Muskie has decided to
withdraw from all presidential primaries and concentrate a
less-expensive, small-scale campaign on the search for
delegates to the Democratic convention, a source said last
night.
There were reports—denied by the Muskie camp—that
the Senator would quit the race altogether.
"Ed Muskie will withdraw from all primaries," a
Democratic office holder said. The source said Muskie,
who suffered a twin defeat in Massachusetts and
Pennsylvania primaries Tuesday, will maintain a smaller
campaign operation aimed at recruiting Muskie supporters
as convention delegates in non-primary states.
"He has recognized the gravity of the situation and is
making a rational decision based on it,"the source said.
The Maine senator, who was considered frontrunner
for the Democratic nomination until the April 4
Wisconsin primary, canceled a scheduled trip to Ohio and
called a news conference for this morning to discuss his
political plans. The Ohio primary is next Tuesday.
Muskie's press secretary, Richard Stewart, flatly
contradicted reports by the Mutual Broadcasting System
that the Maine senator had decided to get out.
"I categorically deny any statements that he's decided
to withdraw," Stewart said.
Muskie himself met with top aides at his home in
suburban Washington, and his campaign headquarters said
he was "evaluating the political situation" and would hold
a news conference today.
Muskie said Tuesday night, after his defeat in the
Massachusetts and Pennsylvania primaries, that he intends
to stay in the race for the Democratic nomination.
Muskie had been scheduled to speak last night in
Toledo, Ohio, and the state's governor, John J. Gilligan,
was already on the way there to introduce him when word
came that the trip was canceled.
A statement from Muskie's campaign headquarters in
Washington issued shortly before 6 p.m. said, "He has
been consulting with his family, with friends and his
supporters throughout the day. And he will continue to
do so throughout the evening."
Some of those supporters in Congress, asked about the
report, said they hadn't heard Muskie would get out.
Some said they thought it more likely he would merely
withdraw from some or all of the remaining primaries, but
remain in the race for the nomination.
