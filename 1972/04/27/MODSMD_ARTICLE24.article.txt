# Lawyer Refuses To Testify
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
SAN JOSE — The late George
Jackson's lawyer refused to answer
prosecution questions in the Angela
Davis trial yesterday. Attorney John
Thome argued that he could not
testify because he has a "confidential
lawyer-client relationship" with Davis.
The prosecutor, Assistant Attorney
General Albert Harris Jr., asked that
Thorne be ordered to answer questions
about a phone call he allegedly
received from Davis, August 5, 1970.
Judge Richard E. Arnason said he
will rule Monday on whether Thorne
must testify. With the jury removed
from the courtroom, lawyers argued
bitterly for two hours about Thome's
position.
Harris called the claim that Thorne
was Davis' lawyer "a fabrication . . .
created to suppress relevant evidence
in this case."
The prosecutor said he will show
that Davis told Thorne that she and
Jonathan Jackson were about to make
a trip to Santa Cruz for important
supplies.
Two Days Before
The alleged call would have taken
place two days before the Marin
courthouse shootout, allegedly initiat
ed by Jackson. The prosecution
charges that Davis planned the escape
and gave weapons to Jonathan in an
effort to free his older brother, convict
George Jackson.
The defense said any call from
Davis to Thorne would have taken
place in mid-July, when he was trying
to obtain a court order permitting
Davis to visit George Jackson's cell.
The tiny courtroom seemed over
whelmed by lawyers as the two
prosecution lawyers and Davis' four
defense lawyers were joined by attor
ney Thorne and his own counsel,

well-known radical lawyer Charles
Garry.
Ticket
Garry directed Thorne to refrain
from answering even the most minor
questions from Harris. At one point,
Garry said, "I have told Mr. Thorne
that if he testifies in this case, he may
as well turn in his ticket to practice
law in this state."
Garry insisted that Thome was one
of Davis' lawyers as early as May, 1970
and pointed out that he was given
lawyer's visiting privileges to her cell
after she was jailed for the Marin
shootout.
Garry also argued that Thorne and
Davis had a confidential relationship
because Davis "was a clerk for the
defense" in Thome's legal work for
George Jackson and the "Soledad
Brothers."
When Arnason ordered Thorne to
answer several questions, the bearded
lawyer answered, "I don't remember."
No Recall
Thorne said he did not recall where
he was on August 5 nor what he had
said when Harris subpoenaed Thorne
to his office in September, 1970.
The session was tense. Harris' hands
were shaking as he accused Thorne of
"fabricating" a lawyer's relationship
with Davis. Garry and Thorne were
equally angry as they demanded to
know if Harris was accusing Thome of
lying. At one point, Thome threatened
to "fire" Garry for not making the
right objections.
Through it all, Judge Aranson
maintained his usual calm, occasional
ly asking the lawyers to "be polite" or
to speak "one at a time."
Testimony
In other testimony yesterday, wit
nesses described seeing Davis and
Jonathan Jackson together a number

of times the month before the Marin
incident—buying an Ml Carbine, cash
ing checks, and crossing the border
from Mexico.
Defense lawyers shrugged and im
mediately "stipulated" that each of
those events were true. They have
insisted such circumstantial evidence
proves nothing against Davis.
There will be no court session
today, while lawyers and Arnason
meet in chambers to discuss the fate of
"the 18-page letter" allegedly sent by
Davis to George Jackson. Arnason has
agreed with defense objection that
the long letter includes much "irrele
vant material." But the prosecution
will argue today that certain excerpts
are "critical," and should be placed in
evidence.
East German reporter Klaus Stein
iger spent his last day at the Davis trial
yesterday. The Communist reporter,
who enthusiastically supports the
defense, said that U.S. immigration
officials have refused to extend his visa
past the nine weeks he has spent here.
Steiniger charged he is being sent
home because foreign reporters are in
agreement that "the Angela Davis trial
is a classic frameup."

said when Harris subpoenaed Thorne
to his office in September, 1970.
The session was tense. Harris' hands
were shaking as he accused Thorne of
"fabricating" a lawyer's relationship
with Davis. Garry and Thorne were
equally angry as they demanded to
know if Harris was accusing Thome of
lying. At one point, Thome threatened
to "fire" Garry for not making the

Testimony
In other testimony yesterday, wit
nesses described seeing Davis and
Jonathan Jackson together a number

of times the month before the Marin
incident—buying an Ml Carbine, cash
ing checks, and crossing the border
from Mexico.
Defense lawyers shrugged and im
mediately "stipulated" that each of
those events were true. They have
insisted such circumstantial evidence
proves nothing against Davis.
There will be no court session
today, while lawyers and Arnason
meet in chambers to discuss the fate of
"the 18-page letter" allegedly sent by
Davis to George Jackson. Arnason has
agreed with defense objection that
the long letter includes much "irrele
vant material." But the prosecution
will argue today that certain excerpts
are "critical," and should be placed in
evidence.
East German reporter Klaus Stein
iger spent his last day at the Davis trial
yesterday. The Communist reporter,
who enthusiastically supports the
defense, said that U.S. immigration
officials have refused to extend his visa
past the nine weeks he has spent here.
Steiniger charged he is being sent
home because foreign reporters are in
agreement that "the Angela Davis trial
is a classic frameup."
SAN JOSE — The late George
Jackson's lawyer refused to answer
prosecution questions in the Angela
Davis trial yesterday. Attorney John
Thome argued that he could not
testify because he has a "confidential
lawyer-client relationship" with Davis.
The prosecutor, Assistant Attorney
General Albert Harris Jr., asked that
Thorne be ordered to answer questions
about a phone call he allegedly
received from Davis, August 5, 1970.
Judge Richard E. Arnason said he
will rule Monday on whether Thorne
must testify. With the jury removed
from the courtroom, lawyers argued
bitterly for two hours about Thome's
position.
Harris called the claim that Thorne
was Davis' lawyer "a fabrication . . .
created to suppress relevant evidence
in this case."
The prosecutor said he will show
that Davis told Thorne that she and
Jonathan Jackson were about to make
a trip to Santa Cruz for important
supplies.
Two Days Before
The alleged call would have taken
place two days before the Marin
courthouse shootout, allegedly initiat
ed by Jackson. The prosecution
charges that Davis planned the escape
and gave weapons to Jonathan in an
effort to free his older brother, convict
George Jackson.
The defense said any call from
Davis to Thorne would have taken
place in mid-July, when he was trying
to obtain a court order permitting
Davis to visit George Jackson's cell.
The tiny courtroom seemed over
whelmed by lawyers as the two
prosecution lawyers and Davis' four
defense lawyers were joined by attor
ney Thorne and his own counsel,

well-known radical lawyer Charles
Garry.
Ticket
Garry directed Thorne to refrain
from answering even the most minor
questions from Harris. At one point,
Garry said, "I have told Mr. Thorne
that if he testifies in this case, he may
as well turn in his ticket to practice
law in this state."
Garry insisted that Thome was one
of Davis' lawyers as early as May, 1970
and pointed out that he was given
lawyer's visiting privileges to her cell
after she was jailed for the Marin
shootout.
Garry also argued that Thorne and
Davis had a confidential relationship
because Davis "was a clerk for the
defense" in Thome's legal work for
George Jackson and the "Soledad
Brothers."
When Arnason ordered Thorne to
answer several questions, the bearded
lawyer answered, "I don't remember."
No Recall
Thorne said he did not recall where
he was on August 5 nor what he had
said when Harris subpoenaed Thorne
to his office in September, 1970.
