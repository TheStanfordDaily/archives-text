# Berkeley Students Aid Walk-Out By 900 University Employees
## 
### JANE BUSSEY 
About 450 building tradesmen and
possibly 500 other employees at the
University of California Berkeley cam
pus walked off their jobs a week ago
last Tuesday. While at most only 2,000
out of 16,000 university employees
are currently staying away, the walk
out has had some major effects at the
Berkeley campus.
Striking by public employees is
illegal in California, so union leaders
have called the stoppage by other
names. The picket lines are being
honored by the American Federation
of State, County and Municipal
Empioyees, food workers, the Ameri
can Federation of Teachers (AFT),
and some students.
The Alameda County Central Labor
Council, representing 13 labor unions
including printing, clerical, library and
stationary unions, and the Building
Trades Council have coordinated the
strike. Richard Groulx, Alameda
Council secretary and spokesman for
the strike, listed three reasons for the

strike. The building tradesmen have
not been given raises in two years, the
grievance procedure does not work to
the advantage of employees and the
university administration has not
responded to • union overtures to
discuss the prevailing wage agreement.
Bound
The grievance procedure dissatis
faction is central, according to Groulx.
While the university maintains that
the faculty members who arbitrate on
grievance panels are qualified to act in
that position, unions leaders counter
that the faculty members cannot be
impartial while bound to the institu
tion. The decisions by the arbitrators
are also not binding on the adminis
tration.
Building tradesmen, currently paid
construction worker wages, are de
manding that the university maintain
wage parity with outside industry.
Also, the university is trying to shift
their wage-scale to maintenance wage
scale range, which union spokesmen
claim would require working three to

four hours more per week to keep
salaries at the same level.
On Friday, a San Francisco Super
ior Court judge issued a temporary
restraining order to prohibit striking
activities by union members.
Police handed out about 80 copies
of the temporary restraining order to
picketers, and gave out 33 contempt
of court citations when picketers
failed to honor the restraining order.
Hearings have been held for the 33
union members since Monday in
Alameda County Superior Court. A
decision on the contempt citations is
expected this morning.
Second Week
With the strike entering its second
week, no meetings between university
administration and union leaders are in
sight. Both sides express willingness to
meet for discussion and accuse the
other side of jeopardizing settlement
by refusing to talk. The union leaders
have said they will not return to work
until their demands are met, and the
