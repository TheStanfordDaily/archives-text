# First Arrests Fail To Dampen Freshmen Spirits
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
Freshmen accounted for nearly 40
percent of those Stanford students
arrested in Friday's demonstration at
El Camino Real.
Few of them had ever been arrested
before. Most say they had no qualms
about telling their parents, whose
reactions were generally described as
sympathetic and concerned but not
angry. One freshman said his parents
"were more upset that I woke them
with my phone call than anything
else." Martha Gates, a freshman in
Donner, said that her mother "is very
worried that there is going to be
another Kent State thing."
Many of those arrested were asked
to sign a statement pledging that they
would not participate in any further
demonstrations in which violence or
illegal acts were likely, before they
could be released on their own
recognizance (no bail required). Many
who agreed to sign stated flatly that
they did not intend to honor the
pledge. Almost all of the arrested
students interviewed stated their belief
that such a pledge was unconstitu
tional. Arrestee John Malo believes
that the pledge "is fairly meaningless,"
and does not intend to honor it at all.
Others stated that although they
did not sign a specific statement
concerning future demonstrations,
they were told by police clerks that

signing the OR (Own Recognizance)
release form meant the same thing. "It
was explained to me, but I didn't
specifically sign a paper saying so,"
said Diane Waller.
Ron Obert, director of the OR
program, stated that the signing of the
release form alone did not place any
restrictions on future protest actions.
He said that a student who had signed
the pledge not to participate in violent
demonstrations would lose his OR
privileges if arrested again, and would
have to post bail for his first arrest as
well as his second. However, he said
that the 'likelihood' of violent or
illegal acts in any given situation could
only be established by court decision.
A member of the OR program
stated that he doubted the legality of
the pledge, and that "I don't think any
judge would find it binding."
The pledge requirement for release
on one's own recognizance was order
ed by Municipal Court Judge James B.
O'Grady. However, this requirement
was discontinued after a few hours
because, according to Obert, so many
arrestees refused to sign it.
Most of those arrested for blocking
traffic conceded that they knew they
could be arrested for their actions but,
as one student said, "I didn't really
think about it. I've been in roads
before and never gotten busted for it."

Although some expressed surprise
at what they considered 'police brutal
ity,' many others did not. 'Thursday
night's actions primed me for Friday,"
said one. Those interviewed who had
also been present at Thursday's torch
light parade expressed general agree
ment that there had been more
unwarranted police violence that even
ing than at El Camino the next day.
"I was aware of what the police
could do," said another, "I'd seen it
on TV at Chicago. It was like seeing
yourself in a movie that you've seen
before."
Among those who were shocked at
police actions, one girl said, "I never
realized that the police were anything
but protectors of the people." Robert
Moulton 111 stated that some of his
friends "were almost nailed" by police
cars. "I was very much surprised that
they were trying to run people down,"
he said.
"My beliefs [concerning police)
were pretty much proven correct,"
said Moulton. "I probably have more
animosity toward the police now. I
had been in similar situations before,
but the police had never been so
brutal. I'm really highly critical of the
way they reacted. It was really
frightening. They didn't wait for any
order [to charge]. They just wanted to
beat the shit out of anyone they could
nail."
Another student said that he had

benefited from the experience, for he
had formerly "suffered under the
illusion that there was justice in the
system. But the main violence came
from the police."
But at least one arrestee was also
highly critical of student actions.
Freshman Chris Gray agreed that the
police were unnecessarily violent, but
in his words, "so were the actions of
the students. It was a case of reality
coming home. I was disappointed in
the students. Unfortunately, my arrest
precipitated a lot of rock throwing
that made matters worse.
"The main effect of the incident
has been to convince me that it is
completely hypocritical to associate
with people who will use violence to
end the war. I was well aware of what
the police were capable of. But now I
see that apparently at Stanford it is
impossible to have large peaceful
demonstrations. The best thing to do
is campaign for McCloskey and
McGovern."
In general, however, police actions
seemed to have hardened the resolve
of most arrestees to continue to take
part in anti-war demonstrations. "The
weekend as a whole probably swung
me a little to the left," said Philip
Bartsch. "My eyes have been opened
in several ways," another student said,
"I don't intend to curtail my activities
at all, but I'm going to be cautious
about getting arrested again."

FREE THE MILPITAS BROTHERSâ€”PoIice arrested some 205 persons on El
Camino Real last week. About 40 percent of the Stanford students arrested were
freshmen, who were unfazed by their experience.
Freshmen accounted for nearly 40
percent of those Stanford students
arrested in Friday's demonstration at
El Camino Real.
Few of them had ever been arrested
before. Most say they had no qualms
about telling their parents, whose
reactions were generally described as
sympathetic and concerned but not
angry. One freshman said his parents
"were more upset that I woke them
with my phone call than anything
else." Martha Gates, a freshman in
Donner, said that her mother "is very
worried that there is going to be
another Kent State thing."
Many of those arrested were asked
to sign a statement pledging that they
would not participate in any further
demonstrations in which violence or
illegal acts were likely, before they
could be released on their own
recognizance (no bail required). Many
who agreed to sign stated flatly that
they did not intend to honor the
pledge. Almost all of the arrested
students interviewed stated their belief
that such a pledge was unconstitu
tional. Arrestee John Malo believes
that the pledge "is fairly meaningless,"
and does not intend to honor it at all.
Others stated that although they
did not sign a specific statement
concerning future demonstrations,
they were told by police clerks that

signing the OR (Own Recognizance)
release form meant the same thing. "It
was explained to me, but I didn't
specifically sign a paper saying so,"
said Diane Waller.
Ron Obert, director of the OR
program, stated that the signing of the
release form alone did not place any
restrictions on future protest actions.
He said that a student who had signed
the pledge not to participate in violent
demonstrations would lose his OR
privileges if arrested again, and would
have to post bail for his first arrest as
well as his second. However, he said
that the 'likelihood' of violent or
illegal acts in any given situation could
only be established by court decision.
A member of the OR program
stated that he doubted the legality of
the pledge, and that "I don't think any
judge would find it binding."
The pledge requirement for release
on one's own recognizance was order
ed by Municipal Court Judge James B.
O'Grady. However, this requirement
was discontinued after a few hours
because, according to Obert, so many
arrestees refused to sign it.
Most of those arrested for blocking
traffic conceded that they knew they
could be arrested for their actions but,
as one student said, "I didn't really
think about it. I've been in roads
before and never gotten busted for it."

Although some expressed surprise
at what they considered 'police brutal
ity,' many others did not. 'Thursday
night's actions primed me for Friday,"
said one. Those interviewed who had
also been present at Thursday's torch
light parade expressed general agree
ment that there had been more
unwarranted police violence that even
ing than at El Camino the next day.
"I was aware of what the police
could do," said another, "I'd seen it
on TV at Chicago. It was like seeing
yourself in a movie that you've seen
before."
Among those who were shocked at
police actions, one girl said, "I never
realized that the police were anything
but protectors of the people." Robert
Moulton 111 stated that some of his
friends "were almost nailed" by police
cars. "I was very much surprised that
they were trying to run people down,"
he said.
"My beliefs [concerning police)
were pretty much proven correct,"
said Moulton. "I probably have more
animosity toward the police now. I
had been in similar situations before,
but the police had never been so
brutal. I'm really highly critical of the
way they reacted. It was really
frightening. They didn't wait for any
order [to charge]. They just wanted to
beat the shit out of anyone they could
nail."
Another student said that he had

benefited from the experience, for he
had formerly "suffered under the
illusion that there was justice in the
system. But the main violence came
from the police."
But at least one arrestee was also
highly critical of student actions.
Freshman Chris Gray agreed that the
police were unnecessarily violent, but
in his words, "so were the actions of
the students. It was a case of reality
coming home. I was disappointed in
the students. Unfortunately, my arrest
precipitated a lot of rock throwing
that made matters worse.
"The main effect of the incident
has been to convince me that it is
completely hypocritical to associate
with people who will use violence to
end the war. I was well aware of what
the police were capable of. But now I
see that apparently at Stanford it is
impossible to have large peaceful
demonstrations. The best thing to do
is campaign for McCloskey and
McGovern."
In general, however, police actions
seemed to have hardened the resolve
of most arrestees to continue to take
part in anti-war demonstrations. "The
weekend as a whole probably swung
me a little to the left," said Philip

coming home. I was disappointed in
the students. Unfortunately, my arrest
precipitated a lot of rock throwing
that made matters worse.
"The main effect of the incident

impossible to have large peaceful
demonstrations. The best thing to do
is campaign for McCloskey and
McGovern."
In general, however, police actions
seemed to have hardened the resolve
of most arrestees to continue to take
part in anti-war demonstrations. "The
weekend as a whole probably swung
me a little to the left," said Philip
Bartsch. "My eyes have been opened
in several ways," another student said,
"I don't intend to curtail my activities
at all, but I'm going to be cautious
about getting arrested again."

FREE THE MILPITAS BROTHERSâ€”PoIice arrested some 205 persons on El
Camino Real last week. About 40 percent of the Stanford students arrested were
freshmen, who were unfazed by their experience.
Freshmen accounted for nearly 40
percent of those Stanford students
arrested in Friday's demonstration at
El Camino Real.
Few of them had ever been arrested
before. Most say they had no qualms
about telling their parents, whose
reactions were generally described as
sympathetic and concerned but not
angry. One freshman said his parents
"were more upset that I woke them
with my phone call than anything
else." Martha Gates, a freshman in
Donner, said that her mother "is very
worried that there is going to be
another Kent State thing."
Many of those arrested were asked
to sign a statement pledging that they
would not participate in any further
demonstrations in which violence or
illegal acts were likely, before they
could be released on their own
recognizance (no bail required). Many
who agreed to sign stated flatly that
they did not intend to honor the
pledge. Almost all of the arrested
students interviewed stated their belief
that such a pledge was unconstitu
tional. Arrestee John Malo believes
that the pledge "is fairly meaningless,"
and does not intend to honor it at all.
Others stated that although they
did not sign a specific statement
concerning future demonstrations,
they were told by police clerks that

signing the OR (Own Recognizance)
release form meant the same thing. "It
was explained to me, but I didn't
specifically sign a paper saying so,"
said Diane Waller.
Ron Obert, director of the OR
program, stated that the signing of the
release form alone did not place any
restrictions on future protest actions.
He said that a student who had signed
the pledge not to participate in violent
demonstrations would lose his OR
privileges if arrested again, and would
have to post bail for his first arrest as
well as his second. However, he said
that the 'likelihood' of violent or
illegal acts in any given situation could
only be established by court decision.
A member of the OR program
stated that he doubted the legality of
the pledge, and that "I don't think any
judge would find it binding."
The pledge requirement for release
on one's own recognizance was order
ed by Municipal Court Judge James B.
O'Grady. However, this requirement
was discontinued after a few hours
because, according to Obert, so many
arrestees refused to sign it.
Most of those arrested for blocking
traffic conceded that they knew they
could be arrested for their actions but,
as one student said, "I didn't really
think about it. I've been in roads
before and never gotten busted for it."

Although some expressed surprise
at what they considered 'police brutal
ity,' many others did not. 'Thursday
night's actions primed me for Friday,"
said one. Those interviewed who had
also been present at Thursday's torch
light parade expressed general agree
ment that there had been more
unwarranted police violence that even
ing than at El Camino the next day.
"I was aware of what the police
could do," said another, "I'd seen it
on TV at Chicago. It was like seeing
yourself in a movie that you've seen
before."
Among those who were shocked at
police actions, one girl said, "I never
realized that the police were anything
but protectors of the people." Robert
Moulton 111 stated that some of his
friends "were almost nailed" by police
cars. "I was very much surprised that
they were trying to run people down,"
he said.
"My beliefs [concerning police)
were pretty much proven correct,"
said Moulton. "I probably have more
animosity toward the police now. I
had been in similar situations before,
but the police had never been so
brutal. I'm really highly critical of the
way they reacted. It was really
frightening. They didn't wait for any
order [to charge]. They just wanted to
beat the shit out of anyone they could
nail."
Another student said that he had

benefited from the experience, for he
had formerly "suffered under the
illusion that there was justice in the
system. But the main violence came
from the police."
But at least one arrestee was also
highly critical of student actions.
Freshman Chris Gray agreed that the
police were unnecessarily violent, but
in his words, "so were the actions of
the students. It was a case of reality
coming home. I was disappointed in
the students. Unfortunately, my arrest
precipitated a lot of rock throwing
that made matters worse.
"The main effect of the incident
has been to convince me that it is
completely hypocritical to associate
with people who will use violence to
end the war. I was well aware of what
the police were capable of. But now I
see that apparently at Stanford it is
impossible to have large peaceful
demonstrations. The best thing to do
is campaign for McCloskey and
McGovern."
