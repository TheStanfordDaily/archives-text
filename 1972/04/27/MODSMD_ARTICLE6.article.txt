## Neo-Fascists Rule Greece 
###

Five years ago, in April 1967, a
military coup, engineered by
officers of the CIA-controlled
Greek Intelligence Service, took
place in Greece. Martial law was
immediately decreed and to still in
effect. The military coup was the
last resort of U.S. imperialists and
their allies the Greek ruling class.
It took a civil war in the 1940'5,
in order to drown in blood the

desire of the Greek people to live
free in an independeht Greece
governed by the people for the
people.
The right, which ruled since
then, found itself unable to
contain the growing movement of
the democratic and leftist forces
in Greece, after 20 years of
anticommunist propaganda and
repression of the working classes.
The military coup of 1967 took
place in order to secure the
continuation of U.S. hegemony in
Greece and the exploitation of the
Greek people by a privileged
segment of the bourgeoisie. Thus,
the Greek people were deprived of
democratic liberties won with
untold sacrifices over a 20 year
period following the defeat of the
popular anti-imperialist struggle
against British and, later,
American (Truman Doctrine)
intervention during the Civil War
of 1944-1949.
Neo-Fascism
The advent of neo-fascism in
Greece affected all aspects of the
life of the nation.
All political parties and
democratic organizations were
banned. Labor Unions and
student organizations were
dissolved. Seven major Athens
dailies ceased publication. The
rest were obliged to abide by
strict censorship regulations.
Anti-regime journalists were
persecuted and many were forced
into exile. 16,000 people were
rounded up during the night of
the coup. Most of them were sent
to concentration camps on remote
Aegean islands. Since then, more
than 200,000 patriots have been
detained and interrogated by
Security and military police for
alleged anti-regime activities. The
persecution of trade union
leaders, communists and other
leftists has been particularly
Tierce. Thousands of persons have
been tried and sentenced by
court-martial. During those trails
it was established that torture was
a standard means of interrogation
of political prisoners. 250 cases of
torture were documented by the
Sub-Committee for Human Rights
of the Council of Europe. This led
to the expulsion of Greece from

the Council in December 1969.
Torture
Torture was especially directed
against University students. Those
who actively demonstrated their
opposition to the regime were
expelled from all institutions of
higher learning. At the head of the
Universities were placed Army
Generals enjoying the absolute
confidence of the regime. Paid
police agents infiltrated the
institutions posing as ordinary
students. Many of the professors
were fired for political reasons.
Among these were to be found
some of the most distinguished
academic figures of Greece.
At all levels of education the
curriculum was tailored to the
needs of the junta's fascist
propaganda. High school students
were obliged to become members
of a youth organization
propagating the ideals of Nazism.
Severe censorship made
inaccessible to the people some of
the finest creations of Greek
culture, both ancient and modern.
Foreign classics were banned as
well. Intellectual activity was
stifled. Almost all of the
progressive intellectuals active
before the coup were forced to
emigrate.
Key sectors of the economy
were captured by foreign, mainly
U.S., monopolies. (American
investment accounts for more
than 50% of foreign investment in
Greece.) Domestic enterprises
were either wiped out or absorbed
by foreign competitors with the
cooperation of Greek
cosmopolitan capital (Onassis,
Niarchos). A mounting trade
deficit has forced the junta to
resort to heavy short-term
borrowing, thus increasing the
dependence of the Greek
economy on western banking
giants.
Despite heavy foreign
investment unemployment
persists. Every year approximately
90,000 Greek workers seek jobs
abroad. Since 1967 population
growth has been negative. All this
has been accompanied by rising
inflation. On the whole, salaries
and wages have been frozen, while
the right of the workers to strike

has been abolished.
American Government
The American Government has
been, from the very start, the
major accomplice in the above
crimes perpetrated against the
Greek people. They have been
supplying the terrorist regime
with heavy military equipment
even when they were telling the
American people that there was
an embargo on arms' shipments to
Greece. The Greek Armed Forces
have become an instrument of
American imperialist policy in the
Mediterranean directed against the
anti-imperialist struggle of the
Arab peoples and the socialist
countries. The island of Crete has
been turned into a NATO nuclear
base. Presently, the U.S. is trying
to secure permanent home port
facilities in Piraeus and other
major Greek ports. After the loss
of Turkey, Greece is becoming the
whore-house of the 6th Fleet.
The people of Cyprus, who
have been waging a courageous
anti-imperialist struggle, have of
late also come under the attack of
the combined forces of the Greek
and Turkish reactionaries. Their
aim is to subjugate Cyprus to the
strategic necessities .of the U.S.
dominated NATO.
April 21 marked the fifth
anniversary of the military coup
which imposed on the Greek
people the military junta now in
power.
