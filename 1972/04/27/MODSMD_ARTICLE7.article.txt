## Stanford Laser Research

During the past decade
Stanford University — with
Defense Department funding -
led the country in the research
and development of lasers and
laser devices. Today, laser-guided
bombs fill the skies over Vietnam;
tomorrow, laser ray guns will zap
the eyes of Vietnamese
anti-aircraft gunners. Yet Stanford

researchers maintain a
"know-nothing" posture about
the military applications of their
work.
The Air Force has been testing
laser "Death Hays" since 1968 at
its Special Weapons Laboratory in
New Mexico. This month,
according to Laser Focus
magazine, Air Force engineers
began shooting down unmanned

drone airplanes with their
high-power laser.
Eye-Popper
While lasers for zapping
airplanes won't be operational
until the end of the decade, a laser
eye-popper may debut in Vietnam
before the end of the air war
there. The Air Force is spending
$5 million this year in a crash
program euphemistically called
"electro-optical warfare."
Up to eighty percent of the
aircraft losses in the Vietnam War,
estimates the Pentagon, have
resulted from manually aimed,
optical-sighted anti-aircraft
weapons. This has prompted a
heavy research and development
effort in "visual counter
measures," says Aviation Week,
including means of actually
destroying or damaging human
retinal tissue. (Dr. Heinrich Rose
of the Medical School claims that
his Air Force contract, entitled
"Threshholds for Permanent
Functional Visual Damage in
Humans Using Visible Radiation,"
is not applicable to laser ray
guns.) The Pentagon has gone
after funds for programs such as
visual countermeasures, according
to Aviation Week, because of a
"belief in top-level Pentagon
quarters" that "anti-war
sentiment has waned."
The authoritative Defense
Marketing Service reports that the
Pentagon will spend over $110
million this year for research in
lasers and their applications. Over
$70 million of this is for laser ray
guns; another $8 million is for
research in laser-triggered fusion
for neutron bombs.
The Pentagon will also spend
more than $100 million on laser
systems for communications,
navigation, reconnaissance,
range-finding, gunfire control, and
bomb and missile guidance.
Laser-guided or "smart" bombs
have resulted in a tenfold increase
in the accuracy of weapons
delivery in Vietnam, claims the
Air Force. Aviation Week calls
laser-guided weapons "the single
most important advance in
precision weapons delivery since
World War II."
Dr. John S. Foster, the
Pentagon's top man for research

and engineering, says that Air
Force "dependence" on these
systems will increase over the
coming years because of "the
many benefits derived," such as
fewer bombs, fewer airplanes, and
"increased pinpoint destruction
accuracy." (The full extent of the
Pentagon's interest in lasers is
detailed and documented in the
April 8 issue of The New
Republic.)
Schawlow
In February, Stanford
Professor Arthur L. Schawlow —
who with Dr. Charies H. Townes
developed the theoretical
principle of laser action in 1958 —
gave a highly entertaining talk on
lasers here. He started off with a
slide showing a ten-year-old
artist's conception of a laser ray
gun shooting down an airplane.
The audience — mostly students
and faculty from the School of
Engineering — roared with
laughter. Schawlow chuckled and
called it "science fiction." 1 was
appalled: the Air Force is doing it
this month at its Special Weapons
Laboratory.
Professor Schawlow continued
to entirely ignore all military
applications of lasers except for a
concluding reference to the
"science fiction" death ray that
people are always making a
hullabaloo about. After his talk
was over, I politely and
respectfully inquired why he had
not mentioned the military
applications of lasers. He replied
that he had never worked on a
classified contract. Ignoring the
fact that his answer had nothing
to do with my question, I asked
again. Finally a startling answer
came out of his heart through his
mouth and forever embedded
itself in my brain and cassette
recorder: "I don't know what the
military applications are; I don't
want to know."
This is a highly interesting
response which I (having
experienced Stanford's Electrical
Engineering Department to the
extent of receiving a Master's
degree) strongly feel is an
unspoken, inner attitude
characteristic of the majority of
the professors and students in the
School of Engineering.

When attacked for DoD
research for which substantial
relation to a current military
device can be found, Stanford
researchers invariable present a
series of elaborate
rationalizations, whicTT usually are
not directed toward repudiating
the evidence found by researchers
among anti war protestors.
As former Rand Corporation
engineer Paul Baran (not to be
confused with the late Marxist
economist) has observed, "there is
an unmistaken amorality which
infects some of my engineering
colleagues. Whatever we are paid
to work on we automatically
rationalize to be a blessing to
mankind."
Another view is expressed by
Dr. Judah Landis, a psychologist
at the Midpeninsula Psychiatric
Clinic who has acquired a
reputation as a specialist in the
engineering personality. When an
engineer is confronted with the
ethical problems of war-related
work, he said recently, "the most
common response is denial."
Why do engineering professors
always avoid confronting the
military applications of their
research? Modern sophisticated
technology is difficult to apply —
as companies such as Lockheed
have discovered — to problems
other than the desire of somebody
to put a man on the moon, and to
needs of the military such as
reconnaissance and weapons
delivery.
As the few Stanford professors
who have taken the trouble to try
have found out, political and
economic realities provide one
hundred dollars for military
applications of sophisticated
technology for every dollar
appropriated for humanitarian
applications. Laser Focus reports
that military uses of laser systems
account for more sales than all
other applications combined. The
often-cited medical applications
of lasers amount to only $1.5
million, a piddling beside the
$100 million to be spent this year
for military laser systems.
