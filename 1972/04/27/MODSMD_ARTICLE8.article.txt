## Discrimination In Reverse

In the last two decades,
government - through the courts,
executive actions, legislation and
administrative agencies — has
engaged in an all-out effort to
eradicate all forms of
discrimination in our society.
In a review of the Report of
the U.S. Civil Rights Commission,
in the Spring 1971 issue of The

Public Interest, Nathan Glazer
points out that ".. . the CRC
report abandons as the measure of
success . . . the elimination of
discrimination. Indeed, there is
scarcely a reference to any single
case of discrimination in this
enormous report . . . Concretely,
this means the test is not: Are
members of minority groups
discriminated against? It is: Are
they to be found in employment,
at every level, in numbers equal to
their proportion in the
population?"
Applying the latter criterion,
the U.S. Department of Health,
Education and Welfare has pressed
educational institutions to adopt
"affirmative action" programs to
make sure that their staffs reflect
the above balance or lose millions
of dollars in federal aid funds.
Paul Seabury, in an article, "How

Washington Enforces New Forms
of Discrimination in the Name of
Equal Opportunity: HEW & the
Universities" ( Commentary,
February 1972), reports that
Columbia University (and other
universities) are losing millions of
dollars, ". . . even though no
charges or findings of
discrimination had been made."
This "affirmative action"
approach, observes Seabury,
.. assumes that faculties
somehow must 'represent'
designated categories of people on
grounds other than those of
professional qualification." He
cites a letter to the New York
Times (January 6), from four
professors at Cornell, who stated
that deans and department
chairmen had been informed by
the university's president that
HEW policy meant the "hiring of

additional minority group persons
and females even if in many
instances, it may be necessary to
hire unqualified or marginally
qualified people."
Another recent article
("Quotas by Any Other Name"
by Earl Raab, Commentary,
January 1972) describes the
operation of this "affirmative
action" program in the San
Francisco public schools. The
school superintendent announced
that, since he had too much
administrative help, the number
of administrative jobs would be
reduced. Those in such positions
would be "deselected."
The proposed plan was to
follow strict seniority in the
"deselection" of administrators
classified as "Other White" and
that . . all other administrators
in the other eight designated
minority groups would be
exempted from such deselection
process." Raab concludes: "In
short, and in plain English, only
whites — except for
Spanish-Surname/Spanish-
Speaking whites — would be
demoted." No other groups —
Armenians, Jews, Italians, Greeks,
etc. — were recognized as
"minority.") When the
superintendent's plan was
rejected, his next proposal was to
hire only minority group
administrators, despite the fact
that he had claimed he already
had too many administrators.
