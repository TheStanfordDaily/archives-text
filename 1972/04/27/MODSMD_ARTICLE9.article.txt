Police Antics
Editor, THE DAILY:
Last Friday I was present near
the demonstration on El Camino
Real and Embarcadero Road. I am
a student at Stanford and was
there serving in the capacity of a
medic with the Medical Aid
Group (a group of Stanford
medical students and trained
under-graduates whose presence is
known to the police.) After others
had moved out onto the El
Camino, I decided to return to
campus.
Along with about ten others I
began walking through the trees
and fields towards campus. When
I was about two or three blocks
from the El Camino a Santa Clara
County sheriff's car suddenly
turned off the road and into the
field and began chasing me and
the others at very high speeds.
There had been no order from
Lieutenant Tamm or anyone else
that the fields through which I
was walking had been declared
illegal assembly. With no
provocation the sheriff's car
careened and chased us through
the field. My only safety was
behind trees! Had I been hit I am
certain I would have been killed
or seriously injured.
Some moments later 1 observed
this same car, with four deputies
inside, ram metal fence posts. The
deputies jumped out of their car
and made aggressive moves
towards about five people also
walking back through the field,
then got back into their car and
roared away.
I protest this kind of
nonsensical criminal and
extremely dangerous behavior!
These terrorizing acts were
initiated without any provocation
on my part or on the part of
anyone I observed. In my fear and
desperate flight for safety I was
unable to identify the car by any
number.

Editor, THE DAILY:
A lot of people are claiming
that the events of last Friday have
revealed to them the hypocrisy
and brutality of people claiming
to represent peace, justice, and
freedom. So it was with me — but
I am not just talking about the
police.
At the time of my arrest on El
Camino Real I had seen only one
rock thrown, although several
people around me were inclined
to throw rocks, I was trying to
disuade them. Even the
significance of the flurry of rock
throwing which was caused by my
arrest did not really sink home to
me (even though I did shout for it
to stop), perhaps because the
whole experience of being
arrested was so engrossing. It was
not until Saturday evening when I
read the Daily and saw several
pictures of my arrest that I began
to evaluate my whole relationship

to the so-called "peace movement
of Stanford". I read about the
attempts to physically prevent
students from going to class, I
read about the trashing in Hansen,
and all over campus. And I saw
rock throwers in the background
of the pictures which showed one
cop choking me as another
kneeled on my back.
All of a sudden all of my
reservations about the alliance
between the anti-war pacifists and
the anti-U.S. revolutionaries came
back to me. If someone accepts
non-violence as a way of life, as
David Josepheson and Columbae
claim to do, than they have no
way to justify working hand in
glove with Venceremos, or of
dehumanizing policemen by
calling them pigs, or of failing to
do everything in their power to
prevent trashing and street
fighting.
I have heard the arguments
that attacking property is not the
same as attacking people but the
people who trash bear a
remarkable resembalnce to those
who bully students and stone
police. I have heard Josepheson
speak countless times between
those who bandy about such
phrases as "people's war," "off
the pigs," and "tear it down." I
have seen the cute little
Venceremos machine guns and I
have heard them cheer (led by
Bruce Franklin), at the news that
two human beings had been shot
because those human beings
happened to be policemen.
I am well aware of the
brutality and sadism of the police,
but to claim that it somehow
justifies student violence is the
easiest of cheap excuses. It is not
that I don't condemn the police —
it's just that I don't have any hope
of influencing them. To seek to
end the violence in Vietnam
through violence at Stanford is
not only hypocritical but destined
to breed still more violence. Only
through non-violent action, be it
political, educational, or
sacrificial, can any real progress
occur.
Although non-violent mass
demonstrations in San Francisco,
New York, and Santa Cruz are
possible, here at Stanford it would
seem that the Venceremos and
assorted trashers make it difficult,
if not impossible.
I want to urge that anyone
opposed to coercion, hate, and
violence withdraw from any and
all activities connected with the
Venceremos. And I wish to put in
a special plea to McGovem,
McCloskey, and Columbae people
— as well as the mass of
unconnected but active pacifists —
to continue to work for the end
of the war and to resist the
temptation to sink into the same
type of stereotyped hating and
reliance on violence that lie at the
root of the Vietnam war.

Hansen Defended
Editor, THE DAILY:

Because the Hansen
Laboratories seem to have been
identified as the primary symbol
of Stanford's alleged complicity in
the war in Vietnam due to its
research program, it may be useful
to know more about that research
program. I have been fortunate to
have been working with the
Hansen Labs researchers in
applications of their work to
products of benefit to mankind.
Their research is in two areas:
acoustic waves and tunable laser
systems.
The acoustic wave research is
very -fundamental with practical
applications in the main five to
ten years away. It is considered an
emerging technology of great
potential importance, and
Stanford is perhaps the leading
academic institution in this
research area.
While the research results are
published freely and thus may be
considered apolitical, the peaceful
applications of this research are
enormous. For example: acoustic
imaging systems where crude
pictures of thin tissue specimens
have already been achieved,
acoustic discrimination of
biological cells — knowing the
acoustic parameters of diseased
and healthy cells — could be of
great importance in medical
research, acoustic delay line

memories, real time signal
processing systems — of great
importance if achievable at the
human respiration frequency.
The tunable laser system
research is much closer to
practical applications, with a
spectroscopic instrument now in
commercial development
Research results here are also
published freely with applications
not only in spectroscopy but, for
example, in air pollution
detection, plasma diagnostics as
applied to new sources of clean
energy, exitation of specific
cellular flouressence for cancer
studies, and so on.
Yet research results in these or
any other research areas,
regardless of which agency or
government sponsors the research,
may find some application useful
in a war — by either side. This sort
of application occurs, it seems to
me, not because of the existence
of scientific research results but
because of political-type
"research" (better termed
advocacy) where all facts prove
what the author wants them to
prove — generally that he is moral
and the other fellow is an evil
communist/imperialist (take your
pick).
