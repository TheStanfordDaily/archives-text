The Wollensak 4800 employs the Wollensak cassette
mechanism, known by everyone to be just about as good as
any cassette transport has ever been. It also has an amplifier
and a pair of speakers. The resulting three piece combination
I provides fine stereo listening from cassette albums and is
fully up to recording off tuners, record players, or other tape
machines, It can also be connected to a music system and
used as a deck. It was a good buy at its former price of ;
$199.95, now it's an even better value
