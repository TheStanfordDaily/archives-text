## More Minority Law Students

minority law students

Stanford Law School has been
struggling with the question of
offering legal education to
minority students for the last four
years. This period has been
marked by (1) the hiring of
Thelton Henderson as Assistant
Dean, with pri mary
responsibilities in minority
admissions; (2) the creation and
demise of a Four-Year Program
for minority students (law school
normally takes three years); (3)
increased efforts to recruit
minority students. However, these
four years have also seen a
negligible increase in minority
admissions.
Throughout its 79 years of

existence, the law school has had
only 11 minority graduates. Last
year's graduating class contained
only five minority graduates and
the class graduating on June 11,
1972, will contain only three
members of minority races.
The reason for this dismal
record is clear. Stanford does not
have a firm commitment toward
increasing minority enrollment.
Moreover, the law school faculty
has recently created a committee
whose primary purpose is to
police the admission of minority
students. The effect of this
policing action will be to limit
admission to only those minority
students meeting arbitrarily
established and biasedly
determined numerical standards,
without regard to the applicants
ability to succeed at Stanford based
on other pertinent factors.
Last Monday, April 24, 1972,
the Black, Chicano and American
Indian law students issued a
demand to the law school faculty.
A response from the faculty is
expected on Monday, May Ist,
after a faculty meeting. The
demand was the following:
To The Faculty and
Administration of
Stanford Law School
We, the Black, Chicano, and
American Indian law students of
Stanford Law School, demand
that Stanford Law School
establish a quota of fifty minority
students (20 Black, 20 Chicano,
and 10 American Indian) for the
class of 1975.
This demand comes after a
frustrating exhaustion of all
attempts to increase minority
enrollment. We've met with
Deans, committees, and
subcommittees. Each time we've
been confronted with an
unwillingness to make a long
overdue commitment towards
ending the systematic exclusion of

minority students. There is no
greater evidence of this lack of
commitment than the present
number of minority students at
Stanford Law School.
We've argued that the biased
statistical measures being
employed must not be used as the
sole criterion for admission. Our
arguments have been met with
agreement that the statistics
reflect a white middle-class bias.
Yet, these statistics are presently
being used as the sole basis for
minority admissions.
It is not our contention that
GPA, LSAT, and LQI must be
completely ignored. We recognize
the legitimacy of selecting those
students exhibiting the qualities
which ensure legal scholarship.
However, the establishment of a
quota of fifty minority students
and the maintenance of legal
scholarship are not mutually
exclusive ventures. In the person
of Assistant Dean Thelton
Henderson we have one skilled in
selecting minority students most
likely to succeed at Stanford.
Given a free hand to produce an
entering class of fifty minority
students, he could unquestionably
provide a quality class.
A word seldom heard in this
law school is "racism". It exists.
We believe that underneath the
demonstrated unwillingness to
admit a representative number of
minority students is the classic
white belief that non-whites are
inherently inferior.
Racism is a part of the current
manipulation of statistical
requirements. Grades which
permitted automatic admission
last year are being used to justify
automatic exclusion today.
Racism inheres in the
paternalistic attitude of denying
admission to a minority student
certain to succeed at Stanford,
albeit at the bottom of his class. If

Stanford is the quality institution
which it holds itself out to be,
there is, at best, only a minor
detriment in finishing at the
bottom of a Stanford class,
compared to placing high in a
class from a less "qualified" law
school. This inconsistency cannot
be maintained. Furthermore, if
the aim is to educate the academic
"elite", it seems only fair and just
that the same relative proportion
of non-whtie "elite" be educated
as for whites.
The present situation at
Stanford Law School is
reminiscent of the situation in the
South after Brown. One of the
claims of the archsegregationists
was that the Blacks were pot
qualified to attend "thfir"
schools. It was clear at that time
that the Blacks could never be
qualified according to the
standards being used, for that
required several generations of
aculturation at those very same
schools. Similiarly, in order to
produce the legal "elite" that
Stanford desires, there must be
several generations of
matriculation at Stanford Law
School. Since Stanford doesn't
admit minority students in any
meaningful measure, this becomes
a vicious cycle. This cycle must be
and will be broken!
Nothing short of increased
minority student enrollment will
suffice as a commitment to ending
this racism. And history
demonstrates that an established
quota is the only means to
guarantee an increase in minority
student enrollment.
The time for negotiation has
run. We demand the initiation of a
fifty student minority quota.
