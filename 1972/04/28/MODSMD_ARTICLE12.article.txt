# Indochina, Stanford
## War Begets War

On Friday, April 21, at least
169 universities across the nation
halted "business as usual" in a
national student strike against the
bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong
and against the continuation of a
meaningless war. Our involvement
at Stanford was allied to this
national protest.
A' majority of students and
faculty oppose U.S. destruction of
Vietnam and are particularly
appalled by the Department of
Defense (war) research at
Stanford and by the use of
Stanford job placement facilities
for recruitment by the armed
forces and by war-related
industries.
Our emphasis Friday was to
halt these activities and other
"business as usual" for a day, and
to encourage us all to examine
Stanford's contribution to the
on-going devastation in Southeast
Asia. By the end of the day 220
of us had been arrested for our
effort. Nevertheless, the
determination of most of us was
and is for non-violent protest and
constructive discussion.
As students, we have
repeatedly requested a statement
from the administration on
Stanford's complicity in the war
effort. We seek now also an
explanation for the police
squadrons overrunning our
campus. We, as students of the
Stanford community, have
openly, honestly, and
norvviolently expressed our views
and our need for a response from
the administration. We are not
met with similar honesty. We have
been denied the right even to
choose to combat or reject a
stand. We are left with the
frustrated resource of seeking
answers and seeking change
through demonstrations. We ask
only for honest dialogue.
The Friday strike began with a
prelude of violence on Thursday
evening, when peace marchers
from Palo Alto were prevented
from entering the campus. They

were met by a busload of
riot-equipped police officers, in a
show of military strength that was
absurd. Marchers were charged,
herded, and charged again, so that
by late evening it became virtually
illegal to be a student at Stanford.
Groups of as few as six to ten
people were charged and dispersed
â€” even those of us sitting and
talking on our library steps were
rushed and forced inside.
The presence of squadrons of
police officers on campus is an
insult to our entire community. It
denies our humanity: the human
possibility to meet and discuss
peacefully. These men
transformed behind uniforms are
not a deterrent to destruction.
Instead, the helmet, the baton,
and the gun encourage fear and
then outrage. Most of the 1500
people joined in walking through
campus on Friday were bound
together in a spirit of
non-violence. We were followed
by scores of policement during
our entire campus walk.
Throughout this march, no rocks
were thrown at any living thing.
The two rocks that were thrown
at windows were shouted down
with, "No rocks!"
As we began to move
off-campus toward El Camino
Real, no attempt was made on the
part of these peace officers to
block our path or to divert our
route before we crossed traffic.
We were given no warnings of the
legal or physical danger we faced.
Yet suddenly as we walked slowly
and peacefully together, singing,
we were met with police
resistance in the form of a violent
charge. Police gave chase to
demonstrators and many people
(police and demonstrators alike)
panicked. Any rocks that were
then thrown were thrown in
response to clubs. They were
thrown in panic and in anger.
We who marched toward El
Camino Real sought this
maneuver as an expressive means
of living our convictions and

exposing them for consideration
to people outside the gates of our
university. Those of us who were
arrested sincerely believe in the
message we were attempting to
bring before the citizens of Palo
Alto; yet perhaps the stronger
lesson that can be learned is how
easily war erupts among us here
within our own community. The
aggression that ends with
wounded demonstrators and
policemen is the plague of
Vietnam which is diseasing the
bond of humanity among us all.
