## Red Cross Won't Aid Indochina Blood Drive 
### 
==s concerned asian scholars

No doubt, this is a jaded age that loves to debunk old
heroes and old models; an era in which the Girl Scouts
get sued by the Federal Trade Commission for false
advertising,-an age in which Supreme Court nominees are
mental midgets. Let me add another to the growing list;
the American Red Cross. Perhaps, you are, as I was,
suffering under the illusion that the Red Cross is a
service agency which is "here to help." If so, let me
relate a short incident.
About a week ago, the Committee of Concerned
Asian Scholars decided it would be desirable to send
medical aid to victims of U.S. bombing in North
Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. At first, we hoped to send
blood directly to these areas, but a plethora of
transportation and organizational problems made this
impossible. Consequently, we focused on another
strategy: we would hold a blood drive on campus and
solicit pledges based on the amount of blood collected.
For instance, if Joe Smith pledged 5c per unit of blood
collected, and we collected three hundred units, Joe
Smith would contribute $15 to be used to buy medical
supplies for Indochina.
Once we had adopted this strategy, we had to find an
agency that would collect the blood and put it to good
use in this area; of course, the Red Cross seemed the
obvious candidate. Preliminary calls to the local chapter
of the Red Cross indicated that they would be glad to
have the badly needed blood (there is a constant
shortage of certain blood types in this country). In fact,
the planning was so far advanced that we had arranged

for a building in which the drive could be held and were
negotiating only about the time when the mobile unit
would come; or so we thought.
This rosy view of the situation, however, suddenly
changed when late Thursday, the 20th of April, I
received a telephone call informing me that the Red
Cross was pulling out of the project. The reason given
was that this was a political act, there were strings tied
to the blood, and that both of these facts would
jeopardize a project which the Red Cross valued highly.
I was told by the Palo Alto Administrator for the Red
Cross that the Red Cross hoped to have a multi-million
dollar blood research center constructed on the
peninsula and that the project was highly dependent on
public, i.e. corporate, contributions. This caller then
said, that some people felt that if the Red Cross were to
take blood that was in anyway linked with belligerents
against the United States, then the blood center might
be in trouble when corporate contributors were deciding
whether to support the project or not; he mentioned
Hewlett-Packard as especially awesome in this regard.
(The chief Administrator in San Jose later said there
was "reason" to believe this might be true, but then
denied there was any pressure). In any case, after a
prolonged discussion with the local agent of the Red
Cross it was apparent that the organization that was
"here to help" didn't want to "get involved."
Administrator
After having heard this, the following day I called the
Red Cross Administrator in San Jose and asked if he

could verify what the local Palo Alto man had told me.
the night before. He said that the Red Cross was*"
"non-political" and would not get involved in the.
project. Then I informed him that I heard about the',
blood research center and that corporate pressure*'
seemed to be related to his "non-political" decision. He
said that they "had reason to believe" that there might',
be some difficulty in securing funds if they participated
in our project but that no pressure had actually been
brought to bear. Upon hearing this, I asked how
capitulation to these kinds of pressures from
corporations "up to their neck in the war", could be
construed as a non-political act?
In closing I read him the first sentence of the
American Red Cross' statement of purpose. "Meeting
the changing needs of humanity is the constant challenge
of the Red Cross. Starting in 1863 it was the determined
effort to protect war casualties that led to a code of
procedure known as the Geneva Conventions." He
replied that this was true, but, the Red Cross was
"non-political" and it was a political act aiding the other
side.
As I hung up the words of Clausewitz haunted me. If
war is politics carried on by other means, what does it
mean to be non-political in a war? I guess what it means
to the Red Cross is that if you are not on "our" side,
don't get hurt. Like the onlooker to a mugging or raping
in New York, the Red Cross says,"I don't want to get
involved."
