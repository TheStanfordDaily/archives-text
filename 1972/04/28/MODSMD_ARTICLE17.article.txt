# Caballe: Brilliance Surpassing All Others
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
Soprano Montserrat Caballe is
no mere prima donna — a sadly
overworked and slightly pejorative
epithet. She is what the Italians
call a prima donna assoluta. No
"if's" or "but's" allowed. I can
think of no soprano currently
active who can equal or surpass
Caballe's vocale dimensions,
capabilities or engagement. I guess
this means Caballe
[kah-bahl-yay'J is the world's
greatest soprano. So be it.
Everyone has to take this sort of
plunge sooner or later.
I should admit feeling this way
before hearing Caballe's West
Coast debut at the Opera House
Tuesday. Indeed, I pondered
(briefly) the dangers of hearing in
person a singer whose career on
records I have long praised: we all
know that the recording studio
often bears small relation to the
real world. Why, I asked myself,
put an ideal unnecessarily to the
test. As well I questioned (again,
briefly) the wisdom of seeing
Montserrat in a critical capacity.
Anything less than ecstacy would
be depressing to relate; anything
more would be impossible to
describe.
Happily, I have the latter task
to contend with: the recital
caught a splendid soprano in top
voice singing a program that was
— and this I have never
experienced heretofore
relentlessly interesting. No peaks
or valleys — just a long, high
plateau. After the fifth encore, I
was left enervated and
pleasure-glutted.
Many characteristics make
Caballe's voice remarkable. The
most obvious is that it has no
weaknesses, no trouble-spots.
There is no bottom-heaviness or
shrillness at the top. The
distribution of her powers is
perfect. Secondly, her breath
control is literally breath-taking:
more than once the audience,
after a lengthy phrase, respired
along with her. This awesome
control of the diaphragm lays the
basis for most of her other
excellences — her unerring

accuracy of attack and pitch, her
astonishing agility, and her sheer
lung power.
Ingratiating Voice
Caballe's is a thoroughly
ingratiating voice which does not
strike — as do Nilsson or Crespin
or Silja — like lightning. It
possesses more richness and
rotundity than such song-birds as
Sutherland, Moffo or Peters, And
then there are those floating high
notes for which Caballe holds the
exclusive patent.
Finally, Caballe's singing has a
decided Mediterranean personality
and genuineness of pronunciation
which gives her a headstart over
her competition (Sutherland
especially) in the Romance
languages. This also makes Caballe
the obvious inheritor of de los
Angeles' responsibilities to the
Spanish vocal repertory — as the
Spanish songs of the evening
proved beyond doubt.
Caballe is, in short, the
complete soprano. And her
repertory which runs from
Donizetti, all French opera, Verdi,
Puccini and even to Strauss proves
it.
The recital opened with a
quartet of Italian songs by Lotti,
Pergolesi, Marcello and Paisiello of
the gentle, unprepossessing (but
desperately intricate) bel canto
strain. The Marcello piece was an
especially lovely example of
extended, flawlessly controlled
phrasing and ornamentation.
Donizetti Forte
Advertisements for the recital
shrewdly referred to "three
Donizetti arias et al," and these
came next. If anything can be
singled out, Donizetti is Caballe's
forte, with all his acrobatics and
appealing melodies.
It is a slight shock to find none
of the three recognizable, though
Donizetti did write over 50
operas. Still, all three were worth
plucking out of oblivion.
The witty, lilting spree from
the comic opera Betty was thrown
off with ease; and the lengthy
scene, aria, and cavatina from
Adelia — performed with unusual
expressive commitment — brought

the first half of the program to an
exhilarating close. Here were
pyrotechnics in the best bel canto
tradition.
[This would be the obvious
placa to respond to the sly
comment made in' Wednesday's
review of Sicher-Dieskau about
"the beautiful, empty-headed
warblings of the "bel canto art."
But I forbear. Suffice it to say
that those who criticize florid
vocalism ought (if logic means
anything) to find medieval

manuscript illumination, the
traceries of Gothic architecture,
Cellini's famous salt-cellar, and
much of Shakespeare's poetry (in
short, any expense of artistic
energy in excess of the "function"
it fulfills) equally disgusting and
empty-headed. J
Delightful French
Four intriguing French
selections followed intermission.
The first, "Si mes vers avaient des
ailes (If my verse had wings)" by
Reynaldo Hahn, was of such

delicacy that one hearing simply
was not enough. Next a haunting
"Chanson triste" by Henri
Duparc, and then a fine,
open-hearted Massenet song which
still sounded very much in the
compoer's operatic idiom.
Perhaps the most delectable
oddity of the evening was Maurice
Ravel's "Vocalise en forme de
Habanera" — which was an
uncanny cross, I would say,
between the Habanera from
Carmen and a Villa-Lobos
Bachianas Brasileiras.
The last section included
Spanish songs by Obradors,
Granados and Rodrigo. Finally at
home in her own language and
clearly feeling the tradition in her
veins, Caballe made some
humourous and some deeply
moving impressions. The extensive
tableau from the Granados opera
Goyescas — based on various
paintings by Goya — was a
drenching display of vocal
emotion. On the strength of this
excerpt. I would say Goyescas
cries to be recorded.
With the encores the fun
began. , Caballe exhaused her
English quickly ("Spanish . . .
Folk . .. Song"), but her voice

simply burgeoned, and the
audience refused to budge. A
high-vamp version of a Swiss
folksong, all lilting
lugubriousness, was side-splitting.
An aria from a Spanish zarzuela
(the native musical comedy)
brought the house to its feet for a
forth time, and only after a gentle
Italian song did the audience cease
and desist.
I could only hope further that
Caballe and the director of the
San Francisco Opera made plans
during her visit for an already
criminally overdue operatic debut.
