# Terry Inks With Rockets
## 
### STAN WILSON 
Claude Terry, the greatest scorer in the history of
Stanford basketball, signed a two year contract with
the Denver Rockets of the ABA earlier this week.
Terms of the contract were not disclosed, but Terry
explained that he was "definitely satisfied" with the
final contract.
Terry was selected by Denver in the second
round of the ABA's secret draft earlier this year.
Stan Albecht, Head Scout of the Rockets, called
Terry a "definite pro prospect," and explained that
Terry "moves better without the ball than any
player I've seen this season." Although Terry has
played guard for most of his college career, Bob
King of the Denver front office explained that the
Rockets may have other plans in mind for Terry.
"His 6'5" height makes him a good prospect for a
swing man," said King.
The Phoenix Suns of the NBA were also
interested in Terry's talents, and they selected him
in the third round of the NBA draft of several weeks
ago. But Terry's first consideration is to play
basketball, and Denver presents the best possibility.
One of the Rockets' starting guards has retired to
assume a coaching position, and his former job is
wide open. The Denver office hinted that Terry has
the inside track on the position, and Terry agrees. "I
think there's a spot there," he explained.
Several other factors entered into Claude's
decision to sign with Denver. Terry pointed out that
Denver is a "good basketball town." Further,
Phoenix has several established performers, led by
All-Pro guard Tom Van Arsdale, and these players
would present a formidable obstacle to Terry's
chances for a playing position at Phoenix.
Finally, coach Alex Hannum impressed Terry
during his visit to Denver. Hannum described Terry
as an "explosive player ... a good shooter from the
25 foot range."
The Denver office further explained that they
were interested in signing All-American guard Paul
Westphal of USC. They explained that Terry and
Westphal play a different type of game, and would
complement each other's abilities.
Terry will leave for Europe on June 13, where he
and several other rookies from various teams will
compete for two weeks. But, perhaps more
importantly, Terry became engaged this spring, and
hopes to be married this summer. He and his wife
will probably move to Denver this fall.
Stanford basketball fans will remember Claude

Terry for his sensational accomplishments amidst a
background of basketball mediocrity at Stanford. In
his three years of varsity competition, Claude never
experienced a winning season. This past season
Stanford finished with an overall record of 10-15,
and were a disappointing 5-9 in the conference.
Teammate Bob Buell expressed the sentiments of
many when he explained that the team really
wanted to have a winning season for Claude.
Nevertheless, Terry knew the sitatuion when he
came to Stanford, and he pointed out that he has
"never regretted" his decision to attend Stanford.
However, Stanford basketball seems to be taking
a turn for the better, and many, including Claude,
have expressed optimism about the next few years.
Not coincidentally, Stanford's basketball transition
has taken place during Terry's years at Stanford.
This year Stanford won as many games as in the
past two years combined.
This year in Corvallis, Oregon, Terry established
a new career scoring record by breaking Tome
Dose's old mark of 1,441 points. The game was
halted, and Oregon state fans acknowledged Terry's
accomplishments with a standing ovation. He
finished the season with 1,566 points, with an
average of 21.2 points per game, also a Stanford
record. Last season Terry scored 544 points in 26
games, and also scored 77 points in a weekend series
(against Oregon and Oregon State), both of which
are records. In his first varsity game as a sophomore
Terry scored 32 points in a losing effort to a good
Utah team. The Utah coach labeled Terry a
"sure-fire All-American."
Terry was selected Honorable Mention on several
All-American teams, but his chances were hurt by
Stanford's mediocre record. Still, against
competition like UCLA's Henry Bibby, OSU's
Freddie Boyd, and USC's Paul Westphal, Terry was
named to the Pacific-Eight All-Conference first
team. Last year Terry joined Phil Chenier, formerly
of Cal, on the Pac-Eight's second team.
This year Terry was the team captain, and, as in
the previous two years, was selected as the team's
Most Valuable Player.
Several weeks ago Terry was selected to play in
the Coach's East-West All-Star game, played in
Dayton, Ohio. He was one of twenty Western
athletes to receive this honor. The Denver Rockets
emphasized that Terry has "great potential" as a
professional basketball player.

will probably move to Denver this fall.
Stanford basketball fans will remember Claude

Terry for his sensational accomplishments amidst a
background of basketball mediocrity at Stanford. In
his three years of varsity competition, Claude never
experienced a winning season. This past season
Stanford finished with an overall record of 10-15,
and were a disappointing 5-9 in the conference.
Teammate Bob Buell expressed the sentiments of
many when he explained that the team really
wanted to have a winning season for Claude.
Nevertheless, Terry knew the sitatuion when he
came to Stanford, and he pointed out that he has
"never regretted" his decision to attend Stanford.
However, Stanford basketball seems to be taking
a turn for the better, and many, including Claude,
have expressed optimism about the next few years.
Not coincidentally, Stanford's basketball transition
has taken place during Terry's years at Stanford.
This year Stanford won as many games as in the
past two years combined.
This year in Corvallis, Oregon, Terry established
a new career scoring record by breaking Tome
Dose's old mark of 1,441 points. The game was
halted, and Oregon state fans acknowledged Terry's
accomplishments with a standing ovation. He
finished the season with 1,566 points, with an
average of 21.2 points per game, also a Stanford
record. Last season Terry scored 544 points in 26
games, and also scored 77 points in a weekend series
(against Oregon and Oregon State), both of which
are records. In his first varsity game as a sophomore
Terry scored 32 points in a losing effort to a good
Utah team. The Utah coach labeled Terry a
"sure-fire All-American."
Terry was selected Honorable Mention on several
All-American teams, but his chances were hurt by
Stanford's mediocre record. Still, against
competition like UCLA's Henry Bibby, OSU's
Freddie Boyd, and USC's Paul Westphal, Terry was
named to the Pacific-Eight All-Conference first
team. Last year Terry joined Phil Chenier, formerly
of Cal, on the Pac-Eight's second team.
This year Terry was the team captain, and, as in
the previous two years, was selected as the team's
Most Valuable Player.
Several weeks ago Terry was selected to play in
the Coach's East-West All-Star game, played in
Dayton, Ohio. He was one of twenty Western
athletes to receive this honor. The Denver Rockets
emphasized that Terry has "great potential" as a
professional basketball player.

THE NEW PRO — Claude Terry (25), Stanford's all-time basketball
scoring leader signed a pro contract with the Denver Rockets of the
ABA yesterday. It's ironic that Terry one of the greatest players in
Stanford basketball history should graduate just as some of the Card's
best freshman ever move to the varsity.
Claude Terry, the greatest scorer in the history of
Stanford basketball, signed a two year contract with
the Denver Rockets of the ABA earlier this week.
Terms of the contract were not disclosed, but Terry
explained that he was "definitely satisfied" with the
final contract.
Terry was selected by Denver in the second
round of the ABA's secret draft earlier this year.
Stan Albecht, Head Scout of the Rockets, called
Terry a "definite pro prospect," and explained that
Terry "moves better without the ball than any
player I've seen this season." Although Terry has
played guard for most of his college career, Bob
King of the Denver front office explained that the
Rockets may have other plans in mind for Terry.
"His 6'5" height makes him a good prospect for a
swing man," said King.
The Phoenix Suns of the NBA were also
interested in Terry's talents, and they selected him
in the third round of the NBA draft of several weeks
ago. But Terry's first consideration is to play
basketball, and Denver presents the best possibility.
One of the Rockets' starting guards has retired to
assume a coaching position, and his former job is
wide open. The Denver office hinted that Terry has
the inside track on the position, and Terry agrees. "I
think there's a spot there," he explained.
Several other factors entered into Claude's
decision to sign with Denver. Terry pointed out that
Denver is a "good basketball town." Further,
Phoenix has several established performers, led by
All-Pro guard Tom Van Arsdale, and these players
would present a formidable obstacle to Terry's
chances for a playing position at Phoenix.
Finally, coach Alex Hannum impressed Terry
during his visit to Denver. Hannum described Terry
as an "explosive player ... a good shooter from the
25 foot range."
The Denver office further explained that they
were interested in signing All-American guard Paul
Westphal of USC. They explained that Terry and
Westphal play a different type of game, and would
complement each other's abilities.
Terry will leave for Europe on June 13, where he
and several other rookies from various teams will
compete for two weeks. But, perhaps more
importantly, Terry became engaged this spring, and
hopes to be married this summer. He and his wife
will probably move to Denver this fall.

Most Valuable Player.
Several weeks ago Terry was selected to play in
the Coach's East-West All-Star game, played in
Dayton, Ohio. He was one of twenty Western
athletes to receive this honor. The Denver Rockets
emphasized that Terry has "great potential" as a
professional basketball player.

THE NEW PRO — Claude Terry (25), Stanford's all-time basketball
scoring leader signed a pro contract with the Denver Rockets of the
ABA yesterday. It's ironic that Terry one of the greatest players in
Stanford basketball history should graduate just as some of the Card's
best freshman ever move to the varsity.
