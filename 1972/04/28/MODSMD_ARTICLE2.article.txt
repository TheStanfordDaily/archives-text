# Senate Won't Finance Washington, D.C. Trip
## 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
After much debate over the legality
of votes taken with no quorum
present, the student Senate voted last
night, 11 to 14, not to give ASSU
President Doug McHenry money to
attend a conference in Washington,
D.C.
The Senate's decision not to
finance McHenry's trip overturned a
Tuesday night vote which granted him
the money. That vote caused much
controversy over the fact the motion
passed with only eight senators present
at the meeting.
At that time, the senators present
voted to transfer funds from a Senate
committee fund into an administrative
fund, so that McHenry could buy a
round trip, youth-fare ticket to the
Washington conference.
Senate Chairman, James Jefferson,
left last night for the conference, as
there was enough money in the
administrative fund to finance his trip.
ASSU Financial Manager Tom
Huseby told the Senate last night that
because the motion to transfer funds
was passed by so few senators, Acting
Dean of Students, Robert Freelan, said
he would not approve the Senate's
decision.
"The way it all works," said
Huseby, "is that the Financial Manager
is in charge of controlling the spending
of funds. I can say yes or no to how
money is spent by the Senate, except
in the case of a line item portion of
the budget. If I think it's 0.k., then I
go to the Dean of Students for
approval."

Huseby also said it was unclear
whether Jefferson, who originally
made the motion to transfer funds,
ever had to bring it to the Senate at
all. "I could have gone directly to the
Dean of Students to argue for the
transfer at Jefferson's request," said
Huseby.
Freelen did give Jefferson $50,
which he lacked, to help finance the
trip out of the Dean of Students fund.
"I could have fought for Doug's
money, but Doug called me this
afternoon and said he wouldn't go
unless the Senate approved," Huseby
added.
At that point, McHenry was asked
to explain the purpose of the
conference for the benefit of the
senators who had not been present at
the Tuesday night meeting. McHenry
said that the conference was called by
black congressmen for black student
leaders from predominately white
colleges.
The Senate then dissolved into a
long debate about the
constitutionality of votes taken when
there is no quorum present at a
meeting. The Senate Parliamentarian
said the motion to rescind Tuesday
night's motion needed only a majority
to pass.
He was contradicted by Robert's
Rules of Order which says a motion to
rescind needed to pass by two-thirds.
Acting Chairman of the Senate Scott
Burke then ruled that the motion had
to pass by a two-thirds majority. At
that point, a vote was taken, and the

motion to change Tuesday night's
decision failed.
Huseby then pointed out that
Freelen said he would only approve
the transfer of funds if it passed by a
simple majority. A new motion was
then introduced to grant McHenry the
money, and it failed by the 11 to 14
vote.
The Senate was still not clear by
the end of the meeting on whether
future votes would only be valid if a
quorum was present at the meeting.
The Senate rarely has a quorum
present at a meeting.
