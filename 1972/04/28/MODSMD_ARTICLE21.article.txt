## Gym Store Fun 
### Doug Wilson 
Actually, all I went into the gym store for was a pair of white
tennis socks, so my roommate would stop yelling at me because I
keep borrowing his. But there was this sale on Indian stadium
blankets, one of which 1 didn't want, and the guy behind the counter
was Pete Jensen, who is a sponsor in Cedro dorm, a fixture at the gym
store, and truly the last of the red-hot athletic supporters. And a very
good salesman.
The gym store is located in the heart of downtown Encina Gym,
with showcases of assorted shorts and shoes, a rack of windbreakers
and umbrellas; there's also a beautiful picture window that opens onto
the intra-mural bulletin board on which are posted sign up lists for
gymnastics and the bike race and a large scoreboard for up-to-date
results of singles tennis (which is two weeks behind schedule.)
Pete Jensen is located behind the showcases, in a chair about five
feet from the assorted shorts, underneath the umbrellas, and close to
the wall covered with posters advertising a famous-name striped racing
shoe (I understand we're not supposed to give free publicity by
mentioning the name "Adidas"). When he is not selling sports items,
Pete just talks with potential customers, tired weight lifters, naked
passers-by in search of a towel, and especially with his partner, Mike
Garner, who is very good at selling combs and noseplugs. It's a lot like
the old general store, except there's handballs instead of a pickle
barrel.
Anyway, all I wanted was this pair of socks. "A pair of white
tennis socks," I said. "Tube or heel?" Pete asked, not getting up from
the chair. "What's the difference I answered, and why don't you get
up from the chair?"
"Tube is cheaper, and I'll get up if you're sure this isn't a bogus
sale."
"Tube. How much?"
"Plain or striped?" (There's a red Stanford stripe along the top of
the sock for about two and a half cents extra per sock).
"Striped."
"That it?"
"Yeah. My roommate hates for me to borrow his socks."
"Does he like you borrowing his blanket?" I wasn't real sure how
Pete knew I borrow blankets, but he went on. "We've got these Indian
stadium blankets for only $12 while they last. Whaddya say?"
I had to hand it to Pete — he really knew how to deliver a sales
pitch. I was so taken with the prospects of owning not only my own
blanket, but an INDIAN blanket (before the word becomes dirty for
good), that I didn't notice that Pete had quoted, word for word, the
"SALE!" sign propped up next to the blankets on the counter. I
bought one.
"How about some new famous-maker striped racing shoes to
replace the ones you've got on that are all worn out." I was barefoot,
and so greatly impressed with Pete's quick wit and ready smile (which
followed the wit) that I bought some new "Vienna-style"
green-striped shoes, even though I'm IV-F because of flat feet. I also
bought, on recommendation, a TD (for "touchdown," Pete explained)
football, a fourth off at $28; two assorted shorts (one with the Indian,
one without, depending on how everything finally turns out); a small
rubber handball; and something advertised as a "mini-jock" for $.50 —
only because, when I asked Pete why they sold stuff like that, here
replied "Why not?"
I also bought a comb from Mike; he hadn't said much during all
this, and I appreciated the low-key sell. The bill came to $54.75, for
which my friend Pete profusely thanked me, saying the money would
be used to buy a new chair and to purchase jerseys for the Cedro IM
baseball team. I said sure, and promised Pete I'd make a pitch for the
blankets, which are still on sale at the store for $12 — while they last.

tennis socks," I said. "Tube or heel?" Pete asked, not getting up from
the chair. "What's the difference I answered, and why don't you get
up from the chair?"
"Tube is cheaper, and I'll get up if you're sure this isn't a bogus
sale."
"Tube. How much?"
"Plain or striped?" (There's a red Stanford stripe along the top of
the sock for about two and a half cents extra per sock).
"Striped."
"That it?"
"Yeah. My roommate hates for me to borrow his socks."
"Does he like you borrowing his blanket?" I wasn't real sure how
Pete knew I borrow blankets, but he went on. "We've got these Indian
stadium blankets for only $12 while they last. Whaddya say?"
I had to hand it to Pete — he really knew how to deliver a sales
pitch. I was so taken with the prospects of owning not only my own
blanket, but an INDIAN blanket (before the word becomes dirty for
good), that I didn't notice that Pete had quoted, word for word, the
"SALE!" sign propped up next to the blankets on the counter. I
bought one.
"How about some new famous-maker striped racing shoes to
replace the ones you've got on that are all worn out." I was barefoot,
and so greatly impressed with Pete's quick wit and ready smile (which
followed the wit) that I bought some new "Vienna-style"
green-striped shoes, even though I'm IV-F because of flat feet. I also
bought, on recommendation, a TD (for "touchdown," Pete explained)
football, a fourth off at $28; two assorted shorts (one with the Indian,
one without, depending on how everything finally turns out); a small
rubber handball; and something advertised as a "mini-jock" for $.50 —
only because, when I asked Pete why they sold stuff like that, here
replied "Why not?"
I also bought a comb from Mike; he hadn't said much during all
this, and I appreciated the low-key sell. The bill came to $54.75, for
which my friend Pete profusely thanked me, saying the money would
be used to buy a new chair and to purchase jerseys for the Cedro IM
baseball team. I said sure, and promised Pete I'd make a pitch for the
blankets, which are still on sale at the store for $12 — while they last.
Actually, all I went into the gym store for was a pair of white
tennis socks, so my roommate would stop yelling at me because I
keep borrowing his. But there was this sale on Indian stadium
blankets, one of which 1 didn't want, and the guy behind the counter
was Pete Jensen, who is a sponsor in Cedro dorm, a fixture at the gym
store, and truly the last of the red-hot athletic supporters. And a very
good salesman.
The gym store is located in the heart of downtown Encina Gym,
with showcases of assorted shorts and shoes, a rack of windbreakers
and umbrellas; there's also a beautiful picture window that opens onto
the intra-mural bulletin board on which are posted sign up lists for
gymnastics and the bike race and a large scoreboard for up-to-date
results of singles tennis (which is two weeks behind schedule.)
Pete Jensen is located behind the showcases, in a chair about five
feet from the assorted shorts, underneath the umbrellas, and close to
the wall covered with posters advertising a famous-name striped racing
shoe (I understand we're not supposed to give free publicity by
mentioning the name "Adidas"). When he is not selling sports items,
Pete just talks with potential customers, tired weight lifters, naked
passers-by in search of a towel, and especially with his partner, Mike
Garner, who is very good at selling combs and noseplugs. It's a lot like
the old general store, except there's handballs instead of a pickle
barrel.
Anyway, all I wanted was this pair of socks. "A pair of white
tennis socks," I said. "Tube or heel?" Pete asked, not getting up from
the chair. "What's the difference I answered, and why don't you get
