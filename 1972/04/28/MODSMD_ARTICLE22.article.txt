# Spring Football Nears Conclusion

### GEORGE DOBBINS 
Four weeks of spring football practice will culminate on May 6,
when the annual "Red-White Game" is played.
Head Coach Jack Christiansen believes that spring practice has
allowed individuals to improve while increasing team unity.
"All in all practice is going about like we expected," states
Christiansen. "We do have areas we can improve on but we can do
that in the fall. In the spring we don't have to work hard on improving
our weaknesses because we're only playing ourselves."
Christiansen emphasized that presently Stanford's major weakness
is its offensive line. "At the present time we're working hardest in
order to fill the positions of center and tackle," he states.
Christiansen optimistically adds, "We think our efforts are coming
along pretty well. At least, we have people with some size at tackle.
By size, I mean people in the category of 6 feet, 4 inches, weighing
about two hundred and fifty pounds. I'm referring to people like
Keith Roan, Reuben Monmouth and Mike Askie, who isn't out this
spring becaue of a knee injury. With these type of people, we should
be in good shape."
Stanford has nothing to worry about as far as receivers are
concerned. According to Christiansen, "Some people have said that
ours are the best in the country. In Miles Moore, Bill Scott, Eric Cross,
Don Alvarado and Reggie Ishman 1 think we've got some people who
can catch the ball."
Christiansen is also pleased with his quarterbacks. "Mike Boryla
looks like he'll be our starting quarterback in the fall," predicts the
coach," but he's getting stiff competition from Dave Ottmar, a
transfer from Gavilon Junior College."
All of next year's defensive starters have not been out at spring
practice. "We haven't had our personnel together yet," states
Christiansen," so it's hard to make any statements about the defense.
Roger Cowan and Pierre Perreault haven't been out and Pete Hanson,
who worked with us last year, had knee surgery and he hasn't
practiced." Christiansen says that the defensive players who have
practiced are "doing an outstanding job."
Because there are openings for 6 offensive and 7 defensive starters,
Christiansen feels that this year's spring practice is "keener" and
involves more competition for positions than in the past: "People who
have not felt they could make the team in the past now see that they
are competing for a starting position on the fifty man roster in the fall
which is the number we travel with at any time."
Christiansen comments about his spring conditioning program,
"I'm not running the team as much as we have done in the past. Last
year, some coaches went in for the idea of stretching. I think that
each individual is different and should get loose on his own. All of
them don't have to do all the exercises to get loose."
Christiansen believes that players should be conditioned well
enough in spring practice so that they can avoid injury during those
four weeks. "I don't think spring is the time to get people into perfect
condition," he states, "We will definitely give them a conditioning
program to use in the summer so they can come back and run. Last
year, we asked them to be in good enough shape to run twelve to
fifteen minutes continuously."
The "Red-White Game" will be more than just an inner squad
game. As Christiansen puts it, "Some schools put their best 2 or 3
teams against substitutes with the idea that they're going to run up
the socre and impress people. We're not looking for a big scoring game
but rather the development of players as individuals."
