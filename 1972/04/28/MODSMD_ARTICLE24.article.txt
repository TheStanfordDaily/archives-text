# Stanford Second After First Day Of Tourney
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Surprising UC-Santa Barbara grabbed the opening day lead
yesterday as 28 teams completed first round play in the U.S.
Collegiate Invitational golf tournament on the Stanford course.
Santa Barbara, paced by Larry Austin's two under par 69, recorded
a four man team total of 287, three ahead of host Stanford. Fresno
State was third with 281 and San Jose State and San Fernando Valley
State were tied for fourth with 294 totals. Four other teams were
within 15 shots of the leaders going into today's second round of the
54 hole event.
UC-Santa Barbara's performance was a surprise to nearly everyone,
including their coach Newell Breyfogel. "We've had a lot of good
individual rounds this year, but we've never put it together like we did
today," he said.
The Gauchos currently have a 15-1 dual match record but until
yesterday their tournament performances have been disappointing.
The lone exception was a third place finish behind USC and San Diego
State in the Vanderburg tourney.
Seniors Gary Vanier and Tom Keelin led Stanford yesterday as the
Cards stayed three shots off the pace with a 290. Keelin fired a one
under par 70, second to Austin in the individual competition while
Vanier, the 1970 tournament winner, turned in an even par 71. Bruce
Robertson carded a 74 for the Cards while Aly Trompas shot 75 and
Dave Baskins and Denny Colvin added 76's.
Only the top four scores count toward the team total but Stanford
is in an excellent position since all six men are still in the running. The
Cards' junior varsity and freshman teams are also entered and both are
near the middle of the pack with scores of 310.
The scores were generally higher than expected yesterday, possibly
due to the extremely slick greens. Only Austin and Keelin and Greg
Hunger of Sacramento State broke par, while Vanier, San Jose State's
Phil Barry, Uc-Santa Barbara's Mark Frolli and San Fernando Valley's
Rex Caldwell all matched regulation figures.
There were two outstanding nine hole scores, however, as Austin
fired a sizzling four under par 32 on the front nine and Fresno State's
Bob Eberle turned in a three under par 32 on the back nine.
On the other end of the scoring, Stan Lacore of Stanislaus State
recorded the day's highest round, a 33 over par 104.
Second round play continues all day today with the low 16 teams
and ties and all individuals within 10 shots of the leader advancing to
tomorrow's final round.
