# Batsmen Play Bruins
## 
### MIKE HERMAN 
Entering the final half of its
conference season this weekend
against UCLA, the Stanford
varsity baseball team faces a
relative do-or-die situation in its
attempt to take the Southern
Division championship. With the
knowledge that even one loss
could well eliminate the team
from competition, the Cardinals
will engage the Bruins in a
three-game series played this
Friday and Saturday at Sawtelle
Field in Los Angeles.
Stanford, a winner of five of its
first nine contests, finds itself tied
for second place behind Southern
California, whose record stands at
seven victories, two defeats. With
the prospect of playing five of the
remaining nine games on the road,
and three of the four home games
against the Trojans, the challenge
is indeed a difficult one.
Two weeks ago, the Cards took
two of three games from UCLA at
the Sunken Diamond. The Bruins
(1-8) have proved to be a
surprisingly weak team in league
competition, after showing
potential in pre-season play,
including a third place finish
behind Stanford and Arizona
State in the Riverside Baseball
Touniament. Yet, the determining
factor of the series will not be so
much how well UCLA plays but
whether the Cardinals successfully
bounce back from last weekend's
series loss to California.
One indication that the team's
potential is starting to be realized
came with the resurgence of team
hitting over the past weekend. In
the three games, Stanford amassed
thirty-six hits, compiling an
amazing .343 average. The team
batting average, which had dipped
below the .290 mark, surged back
over for the first time since the
beginning of the conference
season.
The most amazing hitter last
week, was Tom Williams, the Card
centerfielder. Missing the first
game of the series because of a leg
injury suffered in the UCLA

games, Williams collected five hits
in six at bats in the two remaining
games lifting his conference
hitting mark to an even .500 (12
for 24). This is currently second
in the conference. In addition, he
raised his batting average for the
season to .455, which puts him
among the leaders in the nation
this year.
The Stanford pitching staff is
indeed strong now that Dan Shaw
has seemingly regained some of
his early season form after being
inflicted with a sore arm before
the USC series. Shaw, who has
lost his only two conference
decisions, nonetheless has pitched
well in both, and, along with Nick
Peterson and Bob DiPietro, helps
to form an impressive starting
rotation. The Cardinals lack a
little depth in the pitching
department, with only six hurlers,
but it has rarely been pressed to
expend a large number of relievers
in any series.
In analyzing the Stanford team
at this juncture of the season, a
trend has become apparent which
is not an encouraging one. The
Cards have yet to win the second
game of a conference
doubleheader, an indication that
the team is perhaps lacking of a
killer instinct.
In the Trojan series, the final
game could have been pulled out
with more clutch hitting.
In the first Bruin set, poor
defensive efforts cost the team a
sweep of the series. Versus Cal,
fifteen men were left on base over
a nine inning span. This disturbing
trend was, of course, also
exemplified by the eight run Bear
outburst in the first game of last
week's doubleheader, which cost
Stanford an important game.
Perhaps, with a little more
inspiration, the team could well
have a 9-0 record now.
The Cardinals are quite capable
of going undefeated for the rest of
the season, and, at this juncture, it
appears as if that might be what it
takes to win the title. UCLA
represents an imposing challenge

despite their poor record,
especially playing on their home
field. They are led by
All-Conference pitcher Gary
Rob son, and hardhitting
outfielders, Bob Adams and Earl
Altshuler. However, all were
stifled in the first meeting of the
two teams, as Robson lost to
Peterson, 4-2, in the second game,
Adams was held to a meaningless
homerun in the first game, won
by Stanford, 4-3, and Altshuler
hit poorly all series, with the
exception of the eleventh inning
of the third game, when his fly
ball was misjudged by
centerfielder Glen Johnson,
driving in the winning tally.
In the history of the series
between Stanford and UCLA, the
Cardinals (30-11-1) hold a 78-63
edge. . .
