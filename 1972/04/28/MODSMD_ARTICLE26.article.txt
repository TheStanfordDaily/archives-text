Muskie Withdraws
WASHINGTON — Sen. Edmund S. Muskie, his
once-bright prospects battered by a series of primary
defeats, withdrew yesterday from active campaigning in
Democratic primaries but said he'll stay in the presidential
race.
Almost to a man, Muskie's big-name supporters said
they will stand by his candidacy, hoping he might still
emerge as a possible compromise choice at the Democratic
National Convention this July in Miami Beach. Privately,
however, some conceded this was unlikely.
"I'll stay with him to Miami if he's still there," said
Sen. Philip A. Hart, D-Mich.
There were similar statements from Sens. John V.
Tunney of California, Harold Hughes of lowa, Adlai
Stevenson 111 of Illinois and Thomas F. Eagleton of
Missouri.
Muskie told a jammed news conference his decision
was forced by "diminishing results and diminishing
resources," specifically Tuesday's twin defeat in the
Pennsylvania and Massachusetts primaries. "I do not have
the money to continue," he said.
Muskie said he would remain a candidate in deference
to supporters who want to keep working for him. He
conceded "this decision reduces my prospects in the
campaign" but said a compromise candidacy at Miami
Beach is "a possible option."
Quang Tri Battle Erupts
SAIGON — A tank battle erupted yesterday on the
approaches to Quang Tri in a renewed North Vietnamese
drive to seize that northernmost provincial capital. Allied
officers claimed victory in the armored battle and said
South Vietnamese were holding their own elsewhere.
The fighting around Quang Tri, 19 miles south of the
demilitarized zone, broke a lull of more than a week in
the north, where the North Vietnamese have been held
along ? river line 10 miles south of the zone.
A U.S. officer at Quang Tri said 10 North Vietnamese
tanks were destroyed in the armored engagement five to
six miles north of Quang Tri. Fighting continued around
Quang Tri as darkness fell.
At An Loc, the provincial capital 60 miles north of
Saigon, 2,260 shells rained down in a 24-hour period
ending early yesterday, Siagon headquarters said. It was
the heaviest bombardment in any 24-hour period at An
Loc since the North Vietnamese struck along the invasion
corridor leading toward Saigon early in the offensive.
While no major new fighting was reported in the
central highlands, there was no lessening of North
Vietnamese pressure and new attacks were feared there by
the weekend.
Meanwhile, in Paris, the North Vietnamese said
yesterday secret talks on the Vietnam war were probable.
The statement was issued after both sides returned to the
bargaining table.
The first meeting of the two sides in five weeks erupted
into charges and denials of a North Vietnamese invasion
of the South. But they agreed to meet next Thursday.
U.S. Ambassador William J. Porter refused to comment
on the North Vietnamese statement.

Committee Okays Kleindienst
WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee
approved for the second time yesterday the nomination of
Richard G. Kleindienst to be attorney general, ending the
longest Senate confirmation hearing in history.
By an 11-4 vote, a wider margin than expected, the
committee sent the nomination to the Senate floor "with
recommendation that the nomination be confirmed."
Attempts by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., to
continue the eight-week hearings failed. He promised a
fight on the Senate floor to defeat the nomination. No
vote is expected there for several weeks.
Demonstrations Continue
Several hundred students at four universities
demonstrated last night to protest President Nixon's
televised announcement that the bombing of North
Vietnam would continue.
After the President's speech, about 400 to 500
protesters took over the main administration building at
the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. They said
they would remain until the university scraps its ROTC
program and sells stock in four corporations that do
defense work.
In Bloomington, Ind., about 500 Indiana University
students marched to the Monroe County Courthouse in a
demonstration demanding an end to the war.
About 400 students at Columbia University in New
York City hooted and jeered as they watched the
President on television in an auditorium. They marched
several blocks down Broadway afterward and someone
threw a brick through a bank window. Small groups of
students continued to occupy five buildings on the
campus.
A group of 150 New York University students gathered
at their Washington Square campus after the speech and
marched to Times Square for a brief demonstration.
Newton Arrested, Jailed
OAKLAND — Black Panther party cofounder Huey P.
Newton and a man identified as his bodyguard were
arrested and jailed yesterday on a battery complaint,
police said.
Desk officer Art Ambrose of the Oakland Police
Department said Newton, 29, and Robert Bay, were
arrested in front of Newton's Lake Merritt penthouse
apartment and booked at the city jail. Bail was set at $750
for Newton and $1,250 for Bay.
Ambrose said a misdemeanor warrant was sworn out
against the two after Alonzo Miller, disc jockey for local
radio station KDIA, complained they had struck him with
theifr fists and a gun in an Oakland tavern on April 16.

"I'll stay with him to Miami if he's still there," said
Sen. Philip A. Hart, D-Mich.
There were similar statements from Sens. John V.
Tunney of California, Harold Hughes of lowa, Adlai
Stevenson 111 of Illinois and Thomas F. Eagleton of
Missouri.
Muskie told a jammed news conference his decision
was forced by "diminishing results and diminishing
resources," specifically Tuesday's twin defeat in the
Pennsylvania and Massachusetts primaries. "I do not have
the money to continue," he said.
Muskie said he would remain a candidate in deference
to supporters who want to keep working for him. He
conceded "this decision reduces my prospects in the
campaign" but said a compromise candidacy at Miami
Beach is "a possible option."
Quang Tri Battle Erupts
SAIGON — A tank battle erupted yesterday on the
approaches to Quang Tri in a renewed North Vietnamese
drive to seize that northernmost provincial capital. Allied
officers claimed victory in the armored battle and said
South Vietnamese were holding their own elsewhere.
The fighting around Quang Tri, 19 miles south of the
demilitarized zone, broke a lull of more than a week in
the north, where the North Vietnamese have been held
along ? river line 10 miles south of the zone.
A U.S. officer at Quang Tri said 10 North Vietnamese
tanks were destroyed in the armored engagement five to
six miles north of Quang Tri. Fighting continued around
Quang Tri as darkness fell.
At An Loc, the provincial capital 60 miles north of
Saigon, 2,260 shells rained down in a 24-hour period
ending early yesterday, Siagon headquarters said. It was
the heaviest bombardment in any 24-hour period at An
Loc since the North Vietnamese struck along the invasion
corridor leading toward Saigon early in the offensive.
While no major new fighting was reported in the
central highlands, there was no lessening of North
Vietnamese pressure and new attacks were feared there by
the weekend.
Meanwhile, in Paris, the North Vietnamese said
yesterday secret talks on the Vietnam war were probable.
The statement was issued after both sides returned to the
bargaining table.
The first meeting of the two sides in five weeks erupted
into charges and denials of a North Vietnamese invasion
of the South. But they agreed to meet next Thursday.
U.S. Ambassador William J. Porter refused to comment
on the North Vietnamese statement.

Committee Okays Kleindienst
WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee
approved for the second time yesterday the nomination of
Richard G. Kleindienst to be attorney general, ending the
longest Senate confirmation hearing in history.
By an 11-4 vote, a wider margin than expected, the
committee sent the nomination to the Senate floor "with
recommendation that the nomination be confirmed."
Attempts by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., to
continue the eight-week hearings failed. He promised a
fight on the Senate floor to defeat the nomination. No
vote is expected there for several weeks.
Demonstrations Continue
Several hundred students at four universities
demonstrated last night to protest President Nixon's
televised announcement that the bombing of North
Vietnam would continue.
After the President's speech, about 400 to 500
protesters took over the main administration building at
the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. They said
they would remain until the university scraps its ROTC
program and sells stock in four corporations that do
defense work.
In Bloomington, Ind., about 500 Indiana University
students marched to the Monroe County Courthouse in a
demonstration demanding an end to the war.
About 400 students at Columbia University in New
York City hooted and jeered as they watched the
President on television in an auditorium. They marched
several blocks down Broadway afterward and someone
threw a brick through a bank window. Small groups of
students continued to occupy five buildings on the
campus.
A group of 150 New York University students gathered
at their Washington Square campus after the speech and
marched to Times Square for a brief demonstration.

the money to continue," he said.
Muskie said he would remain a candidate in deference
to supporters who want to keep working for him. He
conceded "this decision reduces my prospects in the
campaign" but said a compromise candidacy at Miami
Beach is "a possible option."
Quang Tri Battle Erupts
SAIGON — A tank battle erupted yesterday on the
approaches to Quang Tri in a renewed North Vietnamese
drive to seize that northernmost provincial capital. Allied
officers claimed victory in the armored battle and said
South Vietnamese were holding their own elsewhere.
The fighting around Quang Tri, 19 miles south of the
demilitarized zone, broke a lull of more than a week in
the north, where the North Vietnamese have been held
along ? river line 10 miles south of the zone.
A U.S. officer at Quang Tri said 10 North Vietnamese
tanks were destroyed in the armored engagement five to
six miles north of Quang Tri. Fighting continued around
Quang Tri as darkness fell.
At An Loc, the provincial capital 60 miles north of
Saigon, 2,260 shells rained down in a 24-hour period
ending early yesterday, Siagon headquarters said. It was
the heaviest bombardment in any 24-hour period at An
Loc since the North Vietnamese struck along the invasion
corridor leading toward Saigon early in the offensive.
While no major new fighting was reported in the
central highlands, there was no lessening of North
Vietnamese pressure and new attacks were feared there by
the weekend.
Meanwhile, in Paris, the North Vietnamese said
yesterday secret talks on the Vietnam war were probable.
The statement was issued after both sides returned to the
bargaining table.
The first meeting of the two sides in five weeks erupted
into charges and denials of a North Vietnamese invasion
of the South. But they agreed to meet next Thursday.
U.S. Ambassador William J. Porter refused to comment
on the North Vietnamese statement.

Apollo Splashes Down

Committee Okays Kleindienst
WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee
approved for the second time yesterday the nomination of
Richard G. Kleindienst to be attorney general, ending the
longest Senate confirmation hearing in history.
By an 11-4 vote, a wider margin than expected, the
committee sent the nomination to the Senate floor "with
recommendation that the nomination be confirmed."
Attempts by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., to
continue the eight-week hearings failed. He promised a
fight on the Senate floor to defeat the nomination. No
vote is expected there for several weeks.
Demonstrations Continue
Several hundred students at four universities
demonstrated last night to protest President Nixon's
televised announcement that the bombing of North
Vietnam would continue.
After the President's speech, about 400 to 500
protesters took over the main administration building at
the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. They said
they would remain until the university scraps its ROTC
program and sells stock in four corporations that do
defense work.
In Bloomington, Ind., about 500 Indiana University
students marched to the Monroe County Courthouse in a
demonstration demanding an end to the war.
About 400 students at Columbia University in New
York City hooted and jeered as they watched the
President on television in an auditorium. They marched
several blocks down Broadway afterward and someone
threw a brick through a bank window. Small groups of
students continued to occupy five buildings on the
campus.
A group of 150 New York University students gathered
at their Washington Square campus after the speech and
marched to Times Square for a brief demonstration.
Newton Arrested, Jailed
OAKLAND — Black Panther party cofounder Huey P.
Newton and a man identified as his bodyguard were
arrested and jailed yesterday on a battery complaint,
police said.
Desk officer Art Ambrose of the Oakland Police
Department said Newton, 29, and Robert Bay, were
arrested in front of Newton's Lake Merritt penthouse
apartment and booked at the city jail. Bail was set at $750
for Newton and $1,250 for Bay.
Ambrose said a misdemeanor warrant was sworn out
against the two after Alonzo Miller, disc jockey for local
radio station KDIA, complained they had struck him with
theifr fists and a gun in an Oakland tavern on April 16.
