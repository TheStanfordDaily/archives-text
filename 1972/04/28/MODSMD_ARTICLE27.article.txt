# DoD Funded Research Debated Despite Criticism From Profs
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
A debate over the propriety of
Department of Defense research fund
ing held here Wednesday night had
drawn strong objections from several
members of the Engineering Depart
ment during the week and a half while
the event was being planned.
Two professors explained yesterday
they had feared that the set-up of the
debate and the mood of the campus
following renewed American bombing
of North Vietnam would preclude a
fair hearing of the issues.
The three-hour discussion on the
military applications of DoD-funded
research here was sponsored by the
activist Faculty Political Action Group
(FPAG) and the ASSU Council of
Presidents. A crowd of 50 in
Skilling Auditorium as well as* KZSU
radio listeners heard the debate.
John Linvill, chairman of the
Electrical Engineering Department,
said he was worried that given the
"emotional point we're at," the debate
would proceed in an "atmosphere of
indictments."
'Unrelated Things'
He spoke to many members of his
department, explaining his objection
against "bringing two unrelated things
together," namely the recent increased
bombing in Indochina and DoD
research at Stanford.
Invitations to the debate were sent
less than two weeks ago to principal
investigators of all research contracts
at Stanford. Electrical Engineering
Professor Edward Davidson, an FPAG
member who helped organize the
debate, feels it was quite proper to
"seize the opportunity" following the
bombing of Haiphong to debate on
DoD-funded work at Stanford when
campus interest was high.
Mechanical Engineering Professor
Stephen Kline did not concur, how
ever, and circulated a petition among
professors which doubted the meeting
would "materially increase under
standing or alter views."
He explained that the issue of
research policy had been the subject of
"recent and extensive discussions"
leading to a resolution adopted by the
Academic Senate last month.
Telephone Calls
He also telephoned principal re
search investigators with the aim of
"not encouraging people to go and

asking them to consider carefully what
they were getting into."
"I don't feel we should avoid the
issue," Kline made clear, however.
Linville agreed but said yesterday he
discouraged researchers in his depart
ment from going because, "I don't
want to see them exposed to a lot of
haranging."
Davidson contends, "We were de
termined not to have personal vindic
tive comments." But he added that
many professors are quite defensive
and "they don't want questions raised
the way we want to raise them."
Two panel members and the moder
ator, Genetics Professor Leonard Her
zenberg, were FPAG members, while
others who spoke were engineering
professors holding contracts from the
DoD or Atomic Energy Commission.
Vocal Debate
While the debate was vocal at times
Wednesday night, it touched only
briefly on specific research, that done
by Prof. Richard Pantell, one of the
panelists.
The debate showed wide disagree
ment over the morality or feasibility
of forbidding research at Stanford on
the basis of its military applications.
Halsted Holman, professor of Medi
cine, charged that the Academic
Senate's statement on research policy
was a "profoundly anti-human docu
ment."
The means for doing research at
Stanford should not be based "on
speculations concerning the political
or moral impropriety of the uses
which might be made of its results,"
according to the Senate's resolution.
Defense Legitimate
Thomas Connolly, chairman of the
committee which drafted the state
ment, replied that to "contribute to
the country's defense is legitimate,"
even though he strongly opposed that
kind of work given the presently
"murderous" American foreign policy.
It would be an "absolutely crazy
and mindless way to control research
ers" if a blanket ban were put on all
DoD or other possibly military-related
research at Stanford.
But he added that "faculty res
ponse has been overly defensive and
inadequate," to a report criticizing
Stanford's relation to the DoD, one of
whose authors, Stan Glantz, was on
the panel.

Pantell maintained that "I don't
believe we give that much legitimacy
to the military by taking research,"
and argued it was "impossible to
define clear categories" when attempt
ing to judge research as unacceptable
at Stanford.
However, Glantz replied that Stan
ford was "an organization which sells
research to anybody who'll pay for it.
The University forces people into
working on projects that the military
dictate," he explained pointing to the
fact that professors must do research,
but often can not find money
elsewhere besides the DoD.
Near the end of the debate, John
McCarthy, whose work on artificial
intelligence is DoD funded, comment
ed the discussion had centered too
much on what work should be
forbidden.
The problem of misguided research
at Stanford should be approached by
asking "Are there worthwhile things
that society should spend its money
on?" he added.

was a "profoundly anti-human docu
ment."
The means for doing research at
Stanford should not be based "on
speculations concerning the political
or moral impropriety of the uses
which might be made of its results,"
according to the Senate's resolution.
Defense Legitimate
Thomas Connolly, chairman of the
committee which drafted the state
ment, replied that to "contribute to
the country's defense is legitimate,"
even though he strongly opposed that
kind of work given the presently
"murderous" American foreign policy.
It would be an "absolutely crazy
and mindless way to control research
ers" if a blanket ban were put on all
DoD or other possibly military-related
research at Stanford.
But he added that "faculty res
ponse has been overly defensive and
inadequate," to a report criticizing
Stanford's relation to the DoD, one of
whose authors, Stan Glantz, was on
the panel.

Pantell maintained that "I don't
believe we give that much legitimacy
to the military by taking research,"
and argued it was "impossible to
define clear categories" when attempt
ing to judge research as unacceptable
at Stanford.
However, Glantz replied that Stan
ford was "an organization which sells
research to anybody who'll pay for it.
The University forces people into
working on projects that the military
dictate," he explained pointing to the
fact that professors must do research,
but often can not find money
elsewhere besides the DoD.
Near the end of the debate, John
McCarthy, whose work on artificial
intelligence is DoD funded, comment
ed the discussion had centered too
much on what work should be
forbidden.
The problem of misguided research
at Stanford should be approached by
asking "Are there worthwhile things
that society should spend its money
on?" he added.
A debate over the propriety of
Department of Defense research fund
ing held here Wednesday night had
drawn strong objections from several
members of the Engineering Depart
ment during the week and a half while
the event was being planned.
Two professors explained yesterday
they had feared that the set-up of the
debate and the mood of the campus
following renewed American bombing
of North Vietnam would preclude a
fair hearing of the issues.
The three-hour discussion on the
military applications of DoD-funded
research here was sponsored by the
activist Faculty Political Action Group
(FPAG) and the ASSU Council of
Presidents. A crowd of 50 in
Skilling Auditorium as well as* KZSU
radio listeners heard the debate.
John Linvill, chairman of the
Electrical Engineering Department,
said he was worried that given the
"emotional point we're at," the debate
would proceed in an "atmosphere of
indictments."
'Unrelated Things'
He spoke to many members of his
department, explaining his objection
against "bringing two unrelated things
together," namely the recent increased
bombing in Indochina and DoD
research at Stanford.
Invitations to the debate were sent
less than two weeks ago to principal
investigators of all research contracts
at Stanford. Electrical Engineering
Professor Edward Davidson, an FPAG
member who helped organize the
debate, feels it was quite proper to
"seize the opportunity" following the
bombing of Haiphong to debate on
DoD-funded work at Stanford when
campus interest was high.
Mechanical Engineering Professor
Stephen Kline did not concur, how
ever, and circulated a petition among
professors which doubted the meeting
would "materially increase under
standing or alter views."
He explained that the issue of
research policy had been the subject of
"recent and extensive discussions"
leading to a resolution adopted by the
Academic Senate last month.
Telephone Calls
He also telephoned principal re
search investigators with the aim of
"not encouraging people to go and

asking them to consider carefully what
they were getting into."
"I don't feel we should avoid the
issue," Kline made clear, however.
Linville agreed but said yesterday he
discouraged researchers in his depart
ment from going because, "I don't
want to see them exposed to a lot of
haranging."
Davidson contends, "We were de
termined not to have personal vindic
tive comments." But he added that
many professors are quite defensive
and "they don't want questions raised
the way we want to raise them."
Two panel members and the moder
ator, Genetics Professor Leonard Her
zenberg, were FPAG members, while
others who spoke were engineering
professors holding contracts from the
DoD or Atomic Energy Commission.
Vocal Debate
While the debate was vocal at times
Wednesday night, it touched only
briefly on specific research, that done
by Prof. Richard Pantell, one of the
panelists.
The debate showed wide disagree
ment over the morality or feasibility
of forbidding research at Stanford on
the basis of its military applications.
Halsted Holman, professor of Medi
cine, charged that the Academic
Senate's statement on research policy
was a "profoundly anti-human docu
ment."

Stanford should not be based "on
