# Academy Denies Shockley Request
## 
### 
The National Academy of Sciences
has again voted down a request from
Prof. William Shockley to sponsor a
study of his theories of genetic
influence on intelligence.
For almost six years Shockey has
sought support for a study of his
theory that heredity, not environment,
is the major factor of human intel
ligence.
The vote on the study at a closed
business meeting of the Academy
Wednesday was by a two-to-one
margin against the study, according to
Phillip Handler, Academy president.
Shockley was reportedly encourag
ed by the number of votes in favor of
his proposal and has said he will
continue his campaign to conduct the
study.
Shockley had proposed that the
Academy form a committee to con
sider and resolve the "environment
heredity uncertainty."
