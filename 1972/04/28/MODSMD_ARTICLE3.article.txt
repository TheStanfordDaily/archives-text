# Ping-Pong Match
## Chinese Champs At Maples 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
The touring Chinese championship table tennis team
will put on an exhibition before7,soo people in Roscoe
Maples Pavilion this afternoon at 3.
The Chinese are nearing the end of their United States
tour and had originally planned to only rest and sightsee
during their San Francisco visit. Final arrangements for
the Stanford exhibition were made Monday morning
while the Chinese ping-pong champions were in Los
Angeles.
After a visit to Golden Gate Park this moming, the
Mainland Chinese visitors will travel by bus to Stanford
and arrive at Maples around 1 p.m. to practice. In
accordance with the players' wishes, the gates will not be
open to the public until 2:15 p.m.
A simple ceremony will preceed the table tennis
exhibition which is expected to last approximately an
hour and a half. The national anthems of both the
People's Republic of China and the United States will be
played and President Lyman will officially welcome the
Chinese champions to Stanford. An exchange of gifts will
be made backstage before the opening ceremony.
The tour is being sponsored jointly by the National
Committee on U.S.-China Relations and the United States
Table Tennis Association.
The president of the citizens committee on
Chinese-American relations, Carl Stover, called

Presidential Assistant Fred Glover two weeks ago
inquiring whether Stanford would be interesting in
hosting the Chinese for an exhibition. Glover indicated
that the school would be most anxious to have the
Chinese visit the campus and after a week of negotiations,
Stover informed Glover Monday at 10 a.m. that the
touring table tennis team would definitely play at
Stanford.
It is unclear exactly why the Chinese picked Stanford
over many other possible Bay Area locations, but five
Stanford men are directly involved with the current table
tennis tour. Stover is a Stanford alumnus and four
professors here are on his citizens committee on
Chinese-American relations.
Profs. Marc Mancall and Claude Buss are on the
committee and John Lewis sits on the committee's board
of directors. Law Professor Victor Li is travelling with the
Chinese as their interpreter.
Acting Athletic Director Robert Young has been in
charge of physical preparations for the Chinese visit. The
table tennis team carries all of its equipment, including
tables and cloth backdrops. Young stated that 95 percent
of Maples will be open for general admission seating and
that small sections would be reserved for VIPs and the
press.
Ticket sales have gone well, but Young said that there
will be a few tickets left on sale at the Athletic
Department ticket office this morning.
