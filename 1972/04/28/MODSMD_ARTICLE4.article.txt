# Defeat Hocker By 500
## Burke-Wong Win ASSU Runoff 
### JIM WASCHER 
The ASSU Council of Presidents
slate led by Scott Burke defeated the
Hocker-Friedman ticket 1786 to 1270
in the run-off election held Wednesday
and Thursday.
Nearly 900 fewer people voted this
year as did in the 1971 run-off, when
Hocker ana Friedman lost to the
incumbent Council by only 180 votes.
The Burke slate picked up 668 votes
over its primary total, while Hocker-
Friedman gained 285.
The fee assessment which appeared
on the 1971 ballot boosted the
tum-out in that election.
About 4500 people voted in this
year's primary election one week ago
when six fee proposals were on the
ballot, only two of which passed.
Running with Burke, who is a
junior in philosophy, are: Elaine
Wong, a junior in anthropology; Brent
Appel, a senior in history; and Peter
"Spike" Van Petten, a sophomore
with an undeclared major. Burke,
Appel, Van Petten, and Hocker are
ASSU Senators.
Elections Commissioner Johnny
Lawson said that these totals did not
include the returns from the foreign
campuses. He said that he would
release those returns when he presents
the complete results to the ASSU
Senate for ratification next week.
Burke authored a Senate report last
year after investigating financial mis
management at the Tresidder Union.
The report accused Tresidder Manager
Forrest Tregea of "inept manage
ment."
Burke said "I dislike statements
which candidates make after elections,

so all 1 have to say is I want to thank
all the people who worked so hard for
us."
All that Hocker would say was "I'm
just glad it's over." His running mate,
Robin Friedman, told the Daily that it
was "kind of sad that people didn't
come out" to vote when there were no
fee assessments on the ballot.
Friedman said that the relatively
low turn-out was "another indication
that students don't care about campus
politics." She added that "if I could
have chosen the people to win, I
would have chosen the Burke slate."
She called the winners "nice people."
Present Council member Diane
Fields, said that, considering the
Council's endorsement of the Burke
slate, "she was fairly pleased to know
that they had won." She expressed the

hope that Burke and his Council will
"try to improve the ASSU and what
it's for."
Fields also said that the criticism of
the ASSU offered by Hocker during
his two campaigns was valuable be
cause "it always keeps the people
running it in line."
Hocker and Friedman campaigned
on the platform that the ASSU should
be a voluntary organization. The two
feel that the majority of people at
Stanford probably don't care about
the ASSU.
The Burke slate has argued that the
ASSU is a "student lobby speaking up
for student interests," according to
Burke, and not a student government.
The four slate members have said that
if elected they would set up task
forces which would investigate various

areas that affect Stanford students,
publicize findings and press for
changes.
Brent Appel said last night for the
new Council: "We are pleased at the
margin of victory. However, we do
recognize that the light turnout puts
the burden on us to make the ASSU
meaningful to students in general."
He said that the first issues the new
council must face "are the nuts and
bolts of the ASSU." These include
making committee appointments,
setting up task forces and making sure
the work of the present Council of
Presidents is continued, he said.
The Burke Council will take office
when the Student Senate formally
certifies the election results, probably
next week.
