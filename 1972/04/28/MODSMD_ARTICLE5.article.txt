# Minority Students Demand Increased Law Enrollment
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Minority students at the Stanford
Law School have demanded increased
black, Chicano, and Native American
admissions next year, the Daily learn
ed yesterday.
The Stanford Black Law Students
Association, the Stanford Chicano
Law Students Association, and Ameri
can Indian Law Students at Stanford
presented a joint list of demands to
the law school faculty last Monday,
but the list was only made public
yesterday.
The three organizations demanded
establishment of a quota of 50
minority students in each entering
class of 160, including 20 blacks, 20
Chicanos, and 10 Native Americans.
A response to the demands is
expected after the faculty's meeting
scheduled for this Monday.
LaDoris Hazzard of the Black Law
Students Association refused to say
last night what action, if any, would
be taken should the demands meet an
unfavorable reaction from the faculty.
She would say, however, that the
groups would be "prepared and ready"
with a reaction to the faculty's
response.
Praise of Henderson
The minority students' statement
praised Assistant Dean Thelton Hen
derson, who is in charge of minority

admissions to the law school, and
asked that he be "given a free hand to
produce an entering class of fifty
minority students." The statement
said that under those conditions he
could "unquestionably provide a quali
ty class."
Henderson himself was cautious
when contacted by the Daily yester
day, saying he'd "just as soon not
comment" on the substance of the
demands until after Monday's faculty
meeting.
Similar demands made by students
at University of California's Boalt Hall
led to a sit-in at that building last
week. Hazzard said that there was "no
co-ordinated effort" between the
Berkeley and Stanford demands, how
ever.
The Boalt Hall faculty has offered a
plan that would cut the number of
minority admissions from its current
level of 31 percent to 25 percent.
Black law students at Berkeley have
accepted the plan, but Chicanos have
turned it down, demanding that the 31
percent level be maintained.
'Negligible Increase'
In a prepared statement released to
the Daily yesterday, the minority
organizations charged that in the last
four years there has been only a
"negligible increase" in minority ad
missions despite "increased efforts to
recruit" them.

One of the statement's criticisms
concerned the demise of the so-called
Four-Year Plan for Minority Students,
which extended the normal three-year
course of study.
Henderson yesterday asserted that
minority enrollments are substantially
on the rise, despite the fact that only
three minority students will be among
this June's graduates.
Eight Next Year
He said that next year's graduating
class will begin to reflect the increases.
"If they all graduate, there should be
eight next year. That would include
the last of the four-year and some
three-year students," he said.
As for the class of 1974, which
entered last September, Henderson
said he would "predict that all 19
[who entered] will go all the way
through and graduate."
He also said that the Four-Year
Han's chances of survival (it is
currently suspended and "under
study") are "slim," but claimed that it
was dropped at student request.
Students in the program, he said, were
"psychologically aware of differences
in their status" as compared to
three-year students.
Associate Dean William T. Keogh,
in charge of overall admissions in the
law school, yesterday refuted claims
that minority admissions policies
"limit admission to only those minori
ty students meeting arbitrarily estab
lished and biasedly determined numer
ical standards, without regard to the
applicant's ability to succeed at
Stanford based on other pertinent
factors."
Individual Look
Keogh denied that "numerical stan
dards" were the overriding factors.
"We don't pick people that wayâ€”we
take a pretty careful, individual look
at everybody," he said.
"We're using every tool available in
making our decisions," he claimed.
"After you see thousands and thou
sands of applications, we have some
notion of the kind of intellectual
production it takes.
"It is not a number which deter
mines who is admitted and who is
not."
The minority students charged that
"the law school faculty has recently
created a committee whose primary
purpose is to police the admission of
minority students" that would "arbi
trarily limit" enrollment.
However, Keogh denied this, saying
that no committee or individual would
"establish a rigid line of scolastic
production" that would exclude mi
nority members.
