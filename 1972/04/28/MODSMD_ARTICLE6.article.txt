# Faculty Senate Hotly Debates Proposed Discipline System
## 
### PATTY FELS 
After four weeks of intense debate,
the Faculty Senate yesterday com
pleted its initial discussion on the
Statement on Faculty Self-Discipline.
The statement now goes back to the
floor r nagement committee for revi
sion.
The statement was completed last
May, and discussion of it was delayed
until after the Franklin hearings. It
will either amend or replace the
current tenure policy.
Last week an overwhelming major
ity of the Senate voted unofficially to

eliminate "personal misconduct" as a
grounds for dismissal from a faculty
position. The Senate also discussed the
hearing officer procedure, and the
question of final jurisdiction on
Advisory Board decisions.
Personal misconduct, a grounds for
dismissal in the original tenure policy,
had been omitted from the new
statement. However, several members
of the Senate felt that it should be
replaced and argued that teachers
should set an example. On the other
side, some faculty said that the
definition of "misconduct" is hazy
and hence allows the president to
impose his own ideas of morality on
professors.
Under the new statement a "rofps
sor may commit an illegal act without
losing his job. As one Senate member
put it, he can now sell marijuana to
students, peddle heroin or beat his
wife—all without University sanction.
Hearing Officer
The Senate seemed evenly divided
on the question of a hearing officer.
The statement recommends that all
testimony be heard by a "qualified
Hearing Officer" who then presents
evidence to the Advisory Board.
The primary advantage of the
officer is his impartiality. According to
the statement, it says a hearing officer
"insulates the Board from the inevit
able charge that its members, as active
participants in the academic commun
ity, bring so many preconceptions to
the hearing that they cannot impar
tially decide factual disputes solely on
the basis of evidence introduced at the
hearing." The new procedure would
also save time for Advisory Board
members.
Those opposing the hearing officer
procedure argued that it puts too
much responsibility on one individual
and eliminates the personal contact
between the Advisory Board and the
faculty member on trial.

The other major argument last
week revolved around the statement's
suggestion that decisions of the Ad
visory Board should be final in almost
all cases. Presently, the Board's deci
sion is only a recommendation to the
President.
Violation of Spirit
The statement stresses that giving
the President final jurisdiction violates
the spirit of self-discipline. Senate
members in favor of leaving final
jurisdiction with the President said
that the new system would force the
trustees to play a more active role in
the proceedings.
Yesterday the Senate discussed the
possibility of a fund to finance legal
assistance for faculty members appear
ing before the Board.

the proceedings.
Yesterday the Senate discussed the
possibility of a fund to finance legal
assistance for faculty members appear
ing before the Board.
After four weeks of intense debate,
the Faculty Senate yesterday com
pleted its initial discussion on the
Statement on Faculty Self-Discipline.
The statement now goes back to the
floor r nagement committee for revi
sion.
The statement was completed last
May, and discussion of it was delayed
until after the Franklin hearings. It
will either amend or replace the
current tenure policy.
Last week an overwhelming major
ity of the Senate voted unofficially to

eliminate "personal misconduct" as a
grounds for dismissal from a faculty
position. The Senate also discussed the
hearing officer procedure, and the
question of final jurisdiction on
Advisory Board decisions.
Personal misconduct, a grounds for
dismissal in the original tenure policy,
had been omitted from the new
statement. However, several members
of the Senate felt that it should be
replaced and argued that teachers
should set an example. On the other
side, some faculty said that the
definition of "misconduct" is hazy
and hence allows the president to
impose his own ideas of morality on
professors.
Under the new statement a "rofps
sor may commit an illegal act without
losing his job. As one Senate member
put it, he can now sell marijuana to
students, peddle heroin or beat his
wife—all without University sanction.
Hearing Officer
The Senate seemed evenly divided
on the question of a hearing officer.
The statement recommends that all
testimony be heard by a "qualified
Hearing Officer" who then presents
evidence to the Advisory Board.
The primary advantage of the
officer is his impartiality. According to
the statement, it says a hearing officer
"insulates the Board from the inevit
able charge that its members, as active
participants in the academic commun
ity, bring so many preconceptions to
the hearing that they cannot impar
tially decide factual disputes solely on
the basis of evidence introduced at the
hearing." The new procedure would
also save time for Advisory Board
members.
Those opposing the hearing officer
procedure argued that it puts too
much responsibility on one individual
and eliminates the personal contact
between the Advisory Board and the
faculty member on trial.

The other major argument last
week revolved around the statement's
suggestion that decisions of the Ad
visory Board should be final in almost
all cases. Presently, the Board's deci
sion is only a recommendation to the
President.
Violation of Spirit
The statement stresses that giving
the President final jurisdiction violates
the spirit of self-discipline. Senate
members in favor of leaving final
jurisdiction with the President said
that the new system would force the
trustees to play a more active role in
the proceedings.
Yesterday the Senate discussed the
possibility of a fund to finance legal
assistance for faculty members appear
ing before the Board.
