Causes of War
Editor, THE DAILY:
I presume that it is not
unreasonable for me to resent
having attitudes attributed to me
which I do not hold; or to object
to being quoted as having made
statements which I did not make.
In their letter, published on
Tuesday in The Stanford Daily,
Mr. Babcock and his colleagues
report me as saying that the
. . placement center . .. can't
survive if men and women who
make little pellets that explode
under the skin and stick inside
like burrs are not allowed
unimpeded access to Stanford
grounds and buildings." I
challenge them to produce
evidence that I made that
statement. I am well aware that
their defense would be that
obviously they were only
verbalizing what they perceive my
role here to be, and that just as
obviously, that they were indeed
not actually quoting me.
To set the record straight; as
early as 1960, I was against the

engagement of United States
military forces in Southeast Asia.
This was fairly near the beginning
of our physical entry into that
conflict, and five years before
coming to my present position at
Stanford. I have not changed my
views in this respect.
What I have said, and it is a
matter of public record; is that
the war in Viet Nam is not being
caused by recruitment at Stanford
University. The root causes of war
are many, and they are as
complex as they are numerous.
These causes, however, are not in
my view related fundamentally to
the fact that war material can be
produced. That is an effect, not a
cause. Whatever the root causes,
the immediate causes in the last
resort have to do with the fact, as
former Israeli Prime Minister Ben
Gurion once put it, that: "wars
begin in the minds of men, and so
it is that in the minds of men the
defenses of peace must be
constructed."
The study of the history of
many past civilizations make that
fact abundantly evident. The
artifacts of the earliest
civilizations reveal that many
vicious and brutal wars were
fought when implements of war
were virtually non-existent; that is
except for stones and human
muscle. As Mr. Toynbee has
pointed out in his treatise,
Civilization on Trial, it is just
unfortunate that the difference
now is that we have developed the

means by which we can literally
destroy ourselves.
Limiting recruiting at Stanford
will not stop the war. Nor will it
be stopped if all the windows at
Stanford are broken out. In my
judgment, Mr. Ben Gurion has
given us a clue. When we can place
men in important decision making
positions, who will make decisions
which will produce peace, we shall
have peace, not before then.
Hopefully, in some way, those
who are unable to distinguish
between cause and effect, will
reach a point where their
understanding will result in efforts
directed toward root causes. At
that point, they will become a
part of the solutions to our
problems rather than a part of
those problems. May that day
come soon.

role here to be, and that just as
obviously, that they were indeed
not actually quoting me.
To set the record straight; as
early as 1960, I was against the

engagement of United States
military forces in Southeast Asia.
This was fairly near the beginning
of our physical entry into that
conflict, and five years before
coming to my present position at
Stanford. I have not changed my
views in this respect.
What I have said, and it is a
matter of public record; is that
the war in Viet Nam is not being
caused by recruitment at Stanford
University. The root causes of war
are many, and they are as
complex as they are numerous.
These causes, however, are not in
my view related fundamentally to
the fact that war material can be
produced. That is an effect, not a
cause. Whatever the root causes,
the immediate causes in the last
resort have to do with the fact, as
former Israeli Prime Minister Ben
Gurion once put it, that: "wars
begin in the minds of men, and so
it is that in the minds of men the
defenses of peace must be
constructed."
The study of the history of
many past civilizations make that
fact abundantly evident. The
artifacts of the earliest
civilizations reveal that many
vicious and brutal wars were
fought when implements of war
were virtually non-existent; that is
except for stones and human
muscle. As Mr. Toynbee has
pointed out in his treatise,
Civilization on Trial, it is just
unfortunate that the difference
now is that we have developed the

means by which we can literally
destroy ourselves.
Limiting recruiting at Stanford
will not stop the war. Nor will it
be stopped if all the windows at
Stanford are broken out. In my
judgment, Mr. Ben Gurion has
given us a clue. When we can place
men in important decision making
positions, who will make decisions
which will produce peace, we shall
have peace, not before then.
Hopefully, in some way, those
who are unable to distinguish
between cause and effect, will
reach a point where their
understanding will result in efforts
directed toward root causes. At
that point, they will become a
part of the solutions to our
problems rather than a part of
those problems. May that day
come soon.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I presume that it is not
unreasonable for me to resent
having attitudes attributed to me
which I do not hold; or to object
to being quoted as having made
statements which I did not make.
In their letter, published on
Tuesday in The Stanford Daily,
Mr. Babcock and his colleagues
report me as saying that the
. . placement center . .. can't
survive if men and women who
make little pellets that explode
under the skin and stick inside
like burrs are not allowed
unimpeded access to Stanford
grounds and buildings." I
challenge them to produce
evidence that I made that
statement. I am well aware that
their defense would be that
obviously they were only
verbalizing what they perceive my
role here to be, and that just as
obviously, that they were indeed
not actually quoting me.
