## The 						Schawlow Syndrome

CSecond of two parts)
The defensiveness of many
Stanford engineering professors
regarding DoD research has a very
simple explanation: they gotta
feed their wives and children. If
they were to acknowledge that
the demonstrated military
applications of their research were
not justified by the supposed
humanitarian applications which
rarely get funded, they would be
in a very uncomfortable position
to continue to justify their work
on DoD contracts.
If you've known many
engineers, as I have, you would
know that for many of them,
their life is their work. When they
are attacked for their work, they
put up a strong defense because
their very existence is threatened.
As a result, most Stanford
engineering professors react
according to the Schawlow
syndrone — they don't know what

the military applications are and
they don't want to know.
Stanford anti-war protestors
have been implying that
professors working on DoD
contracts have tried to cover up
the military applications of their
research; this charge made it easy
for them to maintain their
untainted image, for who would
believe that a professor would lie
about the applications of his
research? While in some cases
professors have kept mum about
what they knew the military was
doing with their research, I
strongly believe that for the most
part, they simply don't know.
This should not be surprising,
for engineering professors read
and publish in highly theoretical
technical journals. Applications of
their research are discussed in
more industry-oriented trade
magazines such as Aviation Week,
Laser Focus, Air Force, and
Microwaves. Presumably these
informative publications are read
primarily by anti-war protestors,
who have during the past year
found a number of military
applications for DoD contracts at
Stanford.

An excellent example of the
Schawlow syndrome in operation
is Professor Richard Pantell's
research in high-power ultra-violet
lasers. (The contract is no longer
funded by a DoD agency. I
mention it only to illustrate my
argument that a professor may do
research while he is simply
unaware of its military
applications.)
The contract's title reads
"High-power Broadly Tunable
Laser in the Ultra-violet
Spectrum." The DDC title (the
contracting agency's appraisal of
the contract's relevance to
military needs) says simply
"Weaponry — Lasers for Increased
Damage Effectiveness."
The March 6 issue of Aviation
Week reports that "Pentagon
interest in lasers as thermal
weapons has focused on shorter
wavelengths [ultra-violet
wavelengths are shorter than those
of visible light] because they
produce more damage for a given
energy level." The relevance of
the contract is indicated by its
consideration of both ultra-violet
wavelengths and high power
levels.

We asked Professor Pantell
about the item in Aviation Week
which is nearly a paraphrase of a
portion of his DDC statement. He
replied, "in my best judgment the
potential for war applications is
negligible." This, he said, is
because the method he is using for
generating ultra-violet "requires a
large electron accelerator, which
precludes mobility and therefore
is not amenable to military uses."
Professor Pantell appears to be
uninformed. His "best judgment"
is limited by what he knows. In
the October 18, 1971 issue of
Aerospace Daily, it was reported
that the Air Force Special
Weapons Laboratory — which is
developing laser ray guns for the
forthcoming F-15 fighter and B-l
bomber — has asked industry to
produce a "large, light-weight
electron gun [another name for an
electron accelerator]."
Even if the "light-weight"
electron accelerator would be too
heavy to move around, as
Professor Pantell states, it could
nevertheless be used as a
stationary anti-aircraft weapon,
which is the very application
being tested this month at the Air

Force Special Weapons
Laboratory. It is not surprising
that Professor Pantell might be
uninformed; not everyone reads
Aviation Week, Laser Focus, and
Aerospace Daily.
He told us his "thinking is not
military-oriented." By this he
presumably meant that he does
not do research with the intent of
furthering the development of
weaponry. This is assuredly the
feeling of nearly all Stanford
professors.
However, I should like to
suggest that their thinking become
military-oriented: professors
should actively consider the
military applications of their
research. If they are reluctant or
unable to gather or even accept
information about military
applications — information
without which we cannot even
begin to conduct "rational
dialogue" — then the Schawlow
syndrome is a compelling
argument against any
DoD-sponsored research
(Robert Barkan, a graduate of
Stanford's Electrical Engineering
Department, is a member of the
Pacific Studies Center.)
