# Chinese Ping-Pongers
## Skill Impresses Crowd 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
The championship table tennis
team from the People's Republic of
China dazzled a capacity crowd in
Maples Pavilion last Friday afternoon
with a brilliant display of showman
ship and shotmaking.
Arriving on campus shortly after
noon, the Chinese attended a secret
luncheon with a group of 50 Concern
ed Asian Scholars and residents of
Lagunita. Accompanied by officials
from the National Committee on
U.S.-China Relations and the United
States Table Tennis Association, the
Chinese moved across campus to
Maples at 1:30 p.m. to begin warm
ups.
The exhibition got under way at 3
p.m. with the entrance of the head of
the Chinese delegation Chuang Tse
tung and Graham Steenhoven, Presi
dent of the U.S. Table Tennis
Association.. The Chinese players were
greeted by an enthusiastic standing
ovation as they paraded onto the
Pavilion floor single file.
The national anthems of the two
countries were played and the U.S.
anthem was greeted by scattered
booing and shouting. Most of the
disturbance emanated from the east
bleachers occupied by members and
supporters of Venceremos.. The dis
rupters held banners written in English
and Chinese reading, "Victory to the
NLF," "Defeat U.S. Imperialism" and
"Down With President Lyman."
After the anthems, President Rich
ard Lyman attempted to read a
welcoming statement to the visiting
delegation. He was greeted with the
chant "Work, study, get ahead, kill."
After about 30 seconds, the crowd
silenced the dissidents and Lyman

proceeded with his speech which
expressed the wish that China and the
U.S. could someday exchange stu
dents.
Senior Faces Champs
Soon after an interpreter finished
translating the final portions of Ly
man's speech, the first match got
underway, pitting rising young Chinese
star, Liang Ke-liang, against Stanford
senior Bob Shur. Liang toyed with the
hopelessly outmatched Shur, winning
21-7. The crowd cheered each point
won by Shur, who displayed enough
prowess to challenge the Chinese
champion on several volleys.
Settling down to a serious display
of their awesome ping-pong talent, the
Chinese put on six intersquad matches.
After a women's singles exhibition, the
world champion doubles team of Lin
Hui-ch'ing and Cheng Min-chih defeat
ed two of their team members 22-20.
Announcement of a mixed doubles
match prompted scattered clapping
throughout the Pavilion. While going
through the backdrop the male players
chivalrously stepped aside for their
female partners.
The highlight of the afternoon was
a men's singles match between Liang
Ke-liang and Li Fu-jung. Each player
would alternately back 20 feet away
from the table to retrieve smashes and
then rush the table in an effort to
power the ball past his opponent.
With the score tied at 21 all, Liang
jumped over the three-foot dividers
surrounding the table to retrieve Li's
smash. Li responded by hitting the ball
back to Liang, still standing outside
the dividers. Liang lost the point but
eventually won the match 26-24.
Feature Match
The feature match of the afternoon

pitted one ot the top players on trie
Chinese team, Chang Hsich-lin, against
the greatest table tennis player in
modern times, Chuang Tse-tung. In an
amazing display of his virtuosity,
Chuang turned back Chang, 21-19.
At times during the exhibition, the
action seemed to be planned as the
Chinese attempted to show the crowd
the full range of their shotmaking
ability. The players responded warmly
to the crowd's applause, often clapp
ing their hands to show their apprecia
tion.
Only Incident
The only incident of the afternoon
came when Venceremos Central Com
mittee Chairman Aaron Manganiello
was arrested during the match on a
misdemeanor assault and battery war
rant stemming from an incident during
the Friday April 21st strike on
campus.
Shouts of "That's a typical example
of U.S. imperialism" and "Let him go,
you pig" came from the Venceremos
section as Manganiello was taken into
custody after a brief scuffle with a
plainclothes deputy.

the Chinese delegation Chuang Tse
tung and Graham Steenhoven, Presi
dent of the U.S. Table Tennis
Association.. The Chinese players were
greeted by an enthusiastic standing
ovation as they paraded onto the
Pavilion floor single file.
The national anthems of the two
countries were played and the U.S.
anthem was greeted by scattered
booing and shouting. Most of the
disturbance emanated from the east
bleachers occupied by members and
supporters of Venceremos.. The dis
rupters held banners written in English
and Chinese reading, "Victory to the
NLF," "Defeat U.S. Imperialism" and
"Down With President Lyman."
After the anthems, President Rich
ard Lyman attempted to read a
welcoming statement to the visiting
delegation. He was greeted with the
chant "Work, study, get ahead, kill."
After about 30 seconds, the crowd
silenced the dissidents and Lyman

proceeded with his speech which
expressed the wish that China and the
U.S. could someday exchange stu
dents.
Senior Faces Champs
Soon after an interpreter finished
translating the final portions of Ly
man's speech, the first match got
underway, pitting rising young Chinese
star, Liang Ke-liang, against Stanford
senior Bob Shur. Liang toyed with the
hopelessly outmatched Shur, winning
21-7. The crowd cheered each point
won by Shur, who displayed enough
prowess to challenge the Chinese
champion on several volleys.
Settling down to a serious display
of their awesome ping-pong talent, the
Chinese put on six intersquad matches.
After a women's singles exhibition, the
world champion doubles team of Lin
Hui-ch'ing and Cheng Min-chih defeat
ed two of their team members 22-20.
Announcement of a mixed doubles
match prompted scattered clapping
throughout the Pavilion. While going
through the backdrop the male players
chivalrously stepped aside for their
female partners.
The highlight of the afternoon was
a men's singles match between Liang
Ke-liang and Li Fu-jung. Each player
would alternately back 20 feet away
from the table to retrieve smashes and
then rush the table in an effort to
power the ball past his opponent.
With the score tied at 21 all, Liang
jumped over the three-foot dividers
surrounding the table to retrieve Li's
smash. Li responded by hitting the ball
back to Liang, still standing outside
the dividers. Liang lost the point but
eventually won the match 26-24.
Feature Match
The feature match of the afternoon

pitted one ot the top players on trie
Chinese team, Chang Hsich-lin, against
the greatest table tennis player in
modern times, Chuang Tse-tung. In an
amazing display of his virtuosity,
Chuang turned back Chang, 21-19.
At times during the exhibition, the
action seemed to be planned as the
Chinese attempted to show the crowd
the full range of their shotmaking
ability. The players responded warmly
to the crowd's applause, often clapp
ing their hands to show their apprecia
tion.
Only Incident
The only incident of the afternoon
came when Venceremos Central Com
mittee Chairman Aaron Manganiello
was arrested during the match on a
misdemeanor assault and battery war
rant stemming from an incident during
the Friday April 21st strike on
campus.
Shouts of "That's a typical example
of U.S. imperialism" and "Let him go,
you pig" came from the Venceremos
section as Manganiello was taken into
custody after a brief scuffle with a
plainclothes deputy.
