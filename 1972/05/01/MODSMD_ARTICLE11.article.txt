# Jugglers, Unicyclists
## Spring Festival Begins Today 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Stanford will have its first
spring festival beginning today.
"We could lose our shirts,"
says Dale Snape hopefully, "but
it's going to be artistic."
Snape is student coordinator
for the festival which is trying to
raise money for the Bridge and
YWCA.
But what is a Spring festival?
Today through Friday says
Dale, there's going to be "stuff
going on during noon."
For instance, the Stanford
Band will be performing, as well
as the Sally Dodge dance group,
which Snape describes as "a weird
bunch of people who dance."
"If you ever go to the women's
clubhouse around noon," he says,
"about three times a week they're
in there dancing around in black
leotards. Well, we're going to get
them to do that outside."
Also there's going to be
jugglers, unicyclists, dulcimer
players, and something I can't

read from my notes. Say, if you
want to perform, just call Snape
at the Bridge. They can always use
more performers.
Towards the end of the week,
things really start happening.
Around White Plaza there are
going to be booths with
demonstrations of blowing glass
and throwing pots. Just to show
you can learn something from a
spring festival, throwing pots isn't
a marijuana fight, but the
technical term for molding pots
from clay.
But where the festival plans to
make its bread is a whole mess of
booths all over White Plaza and
behind Tresidder with people
selling handcrafts. There'll be
craftsmen from all over the Bay
who do hookwall tapestries,
stitchery, brass and gold work,
seriographs, embroidery, jewelry,
redwood doors, stained glass
mirrors, ceramics, goblets,
painting, sculpture, macrame, and
balloons. Whew!

Also there's going to be
barbecues, Renaissance meat pies,
popcorn, slurpies and possibly,
Cinco de Mayo (that's May 5
gringos and a big Mexican
holiday) Mexican cuisines.
There's also going to be folk
dancers, a Shakespearian dance
troupe, and a giant weather
balloon flying from Tresidder.
And if that ain't enough, Alan
Strain's vocations for social
change people will have a reading

room in a truck.
Snape says the whole idea got
started because "the Bridge
needed money and the women's
center needed money and TMU
needed to do something good for
a change."
Snape says the purpose of the
whole thing is "to have a good
time." But if the women's center
and the Bridge get the $5,000
they hope to, that probably won't
be too bad either.

craftsmen from all over the Bay
who do hookwall tapestries,
stitchery, brass and gold work,
seriographs, embroidery, jewelry,
redwood doors, stained glass
mirrors, ceramics, goblets,
painting, sculpture, macrame, and
balloons. Whew!

Also there's going to be
barbecues, Renaissance meat pies,
popcorn, slurpies and possibly,
Cinco de Mayo (that's May 5
gringos and a big Mexican
holiday) Mexican cuisines.
There's also going to be folk
dancers, a Shakespearian dance
troupe, and a giant weather
balloon flying from Tresidder.
And if that ain't enough, Alan
Strain's vocations for social
change people will have a reading

room in a truck.
Snape says the whole idea got
started because "the Bridge
needed money and the women's
center needed money and TMU
needed to do something good for
a change."
Snape says the purpose of the
whole thing is "to have a good
time." But if the women's center
and the Bridge get the $5,000
they hope to, that probably won't
be too bad either.
Stanford will have its first
spring festival beginning today.
"We could lose our shirts,"
says Dale Snape hopefully, "but
it's going to be artistic."
Snape is student coordinator
for the festival which is trying to
raise money for the Bridge and
YWCA.
But what is a Spring festival?
Today through Friday says
Dale, there's going to be "stuff
going on during noon."
For instance, the Stanford
Band will be performing, as well
as the Sally Dodge dance group,
which Snape describes as "a weird
bunch of people who dance."
"If you ever go to the women's
clubhouse around noon," he says,
"about three times a week they're
in there dancing around in black
leotards. Well, we're going to get
them to do that outside."
Also there's going to be
jugglers, unicyclists, dulcimer
players, and something I can't

read from my notes. Say, if you
want to perform, just call Snape
at the Bridge. They can always use
more performers.
Towards the end of the week,
things really start happening.
Around White Plaza there are
going to be booths with
demonstrations of blowing glass
and throwing pots. Just to show
you can learn something from a
spring festival, throwing pots isn't
a marijuana fight, but the
technical term for molding pots
from clay.
But where the festival plans to
make its bread is a whole mess of
booths all over White Plaza and
behind Tresidder with people
selling handcrafts. There'll be
craftsmen from all over the Bay
who do hookwall tapestries,
stitchery, brass and gold work,
seriographs, embroidery, jewelry,
redwood doors, stained glass
mirrors, ceramics, goblets,
painting, sculpture, macrame, and
balloons. Whew!
