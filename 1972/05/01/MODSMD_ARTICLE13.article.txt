# Batsmen Win Two Of Three

### MIKE HERMAN 
Sparked by explosive hitting, the Stanford varsity baseball team
took two of three games from the Bruins of UCLA this weekend in
Los Angeles, but may well have written themselves out of competition
for any post-season championship action.
Ripping the Uclans for forty-three runs on forty-six hits for the
series, the Cardinals took the first game, 16-13, then split the
Saturday doubleheader, losing the first game, 8-7, before romping in
the nightcap, 20-3.
By losing the second game of the series, Stanford dropped yet
another game behind the front-running Trojans of Southern
California, and now trails by three full games. USC, who swept a
home series from the California Bears, now has a 10-2 record,
followed by the Cards (7-5), the Bears (5-7), and the Bruins (2-10). SC
meets Stanford at the Sunken Diamond this weekend for a showdown
series that will probably determine the Southern Division
championship.
Slugfest
Friday's single game was a slugfest all the way, which got close
only in the final inning. The Cards broke the game open in the third
inning when rightfielder Mike Nelson slugged a grand slam homerun
and the team scored twice more to take a 6-1 lead. Leftfielder Rod
Boone added two more runs to the lead in the next inning by belting
his ninth homerun of the year.
In the bottom of the fourth inning, starting pticher Dan Shaw
allowed two runs and was taken out of the game in favor of reliever
Dave Frost. Shaw has been troubled by a tightness in the muscles of
his pitching arm and never really was able to unwind in his short stint.
Entering the eighth inning, Stanford led comfortably 13-6. UCLA
was able to push across three runs in the bottom of the inning, the big
blow coming on a homerun by rightfielder Eric Swanson with no one
on base.
Stanford countered in the top of the ninth with three runs of their
own, which proved to be the winning margin. UCLA coach Art
Reichle substituted a catcher, Albie Nociollo, as his sixth pitcher, a
strategic move that was questionable under the circumstances of a
four run deficit. Rod Boone laid into one of Nociollo's pitches for his
second homerun of the day. Firstbaseman Mark Lucich then singled

and came home on another tremendous drive by Mike Nelson, his
fourth homerun of the year.
UCLA Rebounds
Behind once again by seven, UCLA refused to give up, loading the
bases against Frost. Firstbaseman Bob Adams, the leading Bruin
slugger, then unloaded a grandslam homerun to bring the score to its
final total of 16-13.
Frost was able to retire the side in the balance of the ninth to
record his third victory of the season against no defeats. In his s'/2
innings of work, he allowed nine earned runs.
In Saturday's doubleheader, the Cardinals failed for the fourth
time this year to sweep a conference doublebill. The first game, which
may have put Stanford out of reach of the streaking Trojans,
resembled in many ways the stunning 9-8 loss to Cal last week.
Leading 5-3 entering the Bruin sixth inning, starting pitcher Nick
Peterson was rocked for four of the five UCLA runs scored that
inning.
With the score tied at 5-5 and runners on first and second, Peterson
was relieved by Tom Changnon. Facing relief pitcher Bill Susa,
Changnon allowed his counterpart to dump a perfect bunt down the
thirdbase line to load the bases. Luis Gomez, the Bruin shortstop then
tapped a pitch out in front of the plate which Changnon could not
handle, allowing the sixth run to score. Outfielder Mark Swedlow
followed with a single for two more runs, the tallies that proved to be
the winning margin.
Rally Snuffed
Stanford attempted to retaliate in the top of the final inning when,
with two outs, Boone walked, scored on a double by Lucich, who was
himself scored on a single by Mike Nebson. The rally ended when Kim
Hannaford, running for Nelson, was caught stealing second base.
In losing, the Cards also wasted some of the great hitting that has
surged from their bats recently. Nelson homered in the second inning
for his third roundtripper of the series, Mickey Aguirre hit a solo blast
in the fifth inning and Glen Johnson added another in the sixth.
In the third game of the series, Stanford finally received some good
pitching, but it proved unnecessary as the Cards mounted their most
prodigious offensive totals of the season, outscoring the Bruins 20-3,
on twenty hits. Bob DiPietro, spending long periods of time on the
bench while his team pounded out base hits, was still able to stay
sharp enough to hold UCLA to one run through seven innings.
Offensive Stars
Offensively, Stanford also had several standouts. Dave Edson had
four consecutive singles to go four for six; Rod Boone and Mark
Lucich each went three for six, while Boone drove in five runs; Tom
Williams had three hits in five at bats to keep his seasonal batting
average at .452; thirdbaseman Mickey Aguirre got four runs batted in,
including a homerun; and Mike Nelson continued his hot hitting,
lifting his seasonal average to .359, amazing after the poor start he had
on the season.
Yet, despite the two overwhelming victories, the Cards, now
34-12-1, are faced with an unenviable task of being forced to sweep
from USC, or get help from UCLA when the two southern rivals play
each other in the final weekend of the season two weeks hence. The
players spoke only of that task on the way home from Los Angeles
saying that their fates were still in their own hands and that they did
not yet need help from others. Next week's games should tell the
story.
