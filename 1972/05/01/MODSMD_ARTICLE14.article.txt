# Netters Win Ojai Tourney
## 
### DAVID ANTONNUCCIO 
The Stanford tennis squad
labored in Ojai, California for the
past four days, finally capturing
the Ojai Intercollegiate
Tournament and the elusive
Thatcher Cup by one point over
2nd-place USC, 17-16. But the net
season is far from over, as the 72
annual California State Tennis
Championships get underway
today on the courts of the scenic
Alpine Hills Tennis and Swimming
Club in Portola Valley.
During Friday's competition in
Ojai the tourney began narrowing
to a two team battle as Stanford
and USC each advanced two
singles players to the semi-finals.
Stanford strokemaster Roscoe
Tanner, the number one seed,
defeated Dick Bohrnstedt in the
third set, 7-6, as Sandy Mayer
mauled Sashi Menon of USC, 6-3,
6-3. Trojan netman Marcelo Lara
beat Mike Kreiss of UCLA in
three sets, as Lara's teammate
Raul Ramirez stifled another
teammate Mike Machette, 7-6,
6-4.
That same day the top doubles
teams of both Stanford and USC
were eliminated. The Stanford
duo of Tanner and Mayer suffered
a disappointing upset at the hands
of SC's Bohrnstedt and Machette.
But the Trojan's topseeded
doubles combination of Lara and
Ramirez fell to Steve Stefanki and
Peter Campbell of Cal, 7-5, 7-6.
Saturday's play was marked
with a couple of major surprises,
including Roscoe Tanner's first
defeat of the season, as he was
upended by smooth stroking Raul
Ramirez. Another upset was
turned in by Sandy Mayer as he
dumped second seeded Marcelo
Lara. Mayer went on to defeat
Ramirez in the finals 7-6, 4-6, 6-3,
to gain the victory for Stanford.
Stanford claimed both
semi-final slots in doubles and the
Cardinal pair of Rick Fisher and
Gery Groslimond conquered their
teammates, Chico Hagey and Jim
Delaney in the finals.
Today's opening of the
California State Championships
will lack the presence of
defending champ Jim McManus of
Berkeley, who is presently on tour
in Europe, as a record 136 players

vie for his title. The tournament
favorite to replace McManus is
Stan ford's Roscoe Tanner, seeded
no. 1 ahead of Barry Mackay, the
1970 champion, and Allen Fox,
the 1966 titlist.
Card netman Sandy Mayer is
seeded fourth followed by F.D.
Robbins of Salt Lake City, Bill
Brown (former Notre Dame star)
of Omaha, Dick Knight of Seattle,
and Los Altos teaching pro Henry
Kamakana.
The initial two days of play
will qualify 16 players who will
then tangle with the seeds and
other exempt players, starting
Wednesday. Also starting
Wednesday, one feature match
will be played daily at the Golden
Gateway Club in San Francisco.
Eliza Pande of Stanford will
not defend her singles title

although she will perform in both
women's and mixed doubles.
Another Palo Alto miss, Kate
Latham, tops the women's singles
ahead of Cathie Anderson and
Brenda Garcia, both from
Lafayette, and Marna (Cici) Louie
of San Francisco.
Mayer and Tanner rank as the
first doubles pair as Miss Pande
and Miss Garcia head the women's
doubles division. The mixed
doubles favorite is the duo of Miss
Pande and Stanford's Paul Sidone.
Other Stanford racketmen who
were seeded into tomorrow's
round are Jim Delaney, Gery
Groslimond, Chico Hagey, Rick
Fisher, and Paul Sidone.
Today's first round will see 59
singles matches and one doubles
contest as competition opens at
11 a.m.
