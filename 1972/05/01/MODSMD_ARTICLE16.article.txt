# U.S. Collegiate
## Golfers Win Tournament 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford's golf team survived late charges by San
Jose State and San Diego State Saturday to win the
U.S. Collegiate Invitational golf tournament for the
fourth time in five years on the Stanford course.
The Cards had a team score of 890 for the 54
hole tournament, seven ahead of the Spartans and
eight in front of San Diego State. First round leader
UC-Santa Barbara finished fourth at 904 and Fresno
State rounded out the top five with a 906 total.
A Stanford victory was somewhat in doubt late
Saturday afternoon after Dave Baskins, Gary
Vanier, and Aly Trompas had combined for a five
over par 17 on the tough 12th hole and Vanier had
missed a short birdie putt on the 13th.
"It looked pretty bad with five holes to play,"
admitted Stanford coach Bud Finger. "But all of
our golfers played the last five holes near par. That
stretch run brought out the true champion."
Stanford's victory was certainly a team effort as
all six Card golfers scored between 222 and 226.
Vanier and Baskins tied for sixth with 222, Trompas
and Bruce Robertson tied for ninth at 223, and
Tom Keelin and Denny Colvin also finished in the
top 20 with scores of 226.
Putting problems prevented Stanford players
from challenging individual winner Rex Caldwell of
San Femendo Valley State, who shot 71-72-73 for a
three over par 216 total.
Keelin slumped to 78-78 in the final two rounds
after a first round 70 and blamed "the worst putting
in a tournament in my life."
Baskins was in solid contention before he lost his
momentum with three putt greens from 15 feet on
7 and from 18 feet on 8. "Dave would have been in
good shape except for his poor putting," said team
manager Rich Cortez, who caddied for Baskins
Saturday.
Trompas started the day four shots behind the
leader but suffered a double bogey five on the third
hole and then three putted the Bth hole to drop out
of contention.
Vanier, the 1970 tournament winner, seemed to
have the best chance of catching Caldwell but he
also ran into putting problems. Playing with
Caldwell, Vanier was only one shot back before
missing crucial shot putts on 8 and 9.

Caldwell, on the other hand, credited a hot
putter with his victory, the first tournament win of
his life. "I've never putted so well," he said. "I spent
three hours practicing on the putting green the night
before the tournament."
The San Fernando Valley ace, who was a small
college All-American last year, won in championship
form with birdies on three of the last six holes.
Jim Bradford of San Diego State, the 1969
California Junior champion, turned in rounds of
74-72-72 to finish second at 218. First round leader
Larry Austin of UC-Santa Barbara placed third with
219.
The tournament's 28 team field was not
especially strong but defeating national powers like
San Jose State and San Diego State made the
Stanford victory impressive. The Spartans tied for
second in the Western Intercollegiates while the
Aztecs boast victories in the UC-Riverside
Invitational and the Vanderbug tournament along
with a second place finish in the strong Sun Devil
Classic.
Stanford, however, will not be able to sit back
and enjoy its victory very long. The Cards travel to
San Jose Country Club this afternoon at 1:00 p.m.
for a dual match against San Jose State. Two weeks
ago the Cards and the Spartans played to a 27-27 tie
at Stanford.
Bob Chapman of the Stanford freshmen was the
only player to break par in Saturday's final round.
Chapman fired a one under par 70 for a 54 hole
total of 225, leading the frosh to a 12th place finish.
Stanford's junior varsity finished one stroke behind
the frosh at 934.
Other top frosh scores included Gary Hamblet at
231, Mike McGowan at 235, and Mike Mcßride with
242. Dennis Conrad and Sandy McCall each shot
229 to lead the JV while Jim Dwulet had 237 and
Steve Collins shot 239.
Stanford sports information director Bob
Murphy was a busy man on Saturday. Besides
compiling all the scores for various Bay Area
newspapers and the wire services, Murphy caddied
for Aly Trompas during the final round.
Stan Lacore of Stanislaus State, who shot 104 in
Thursday's first round, quit after six holes Friday.

A Stanford victory was somewhat in doubt late
Saturday afternoon after Dave Baskins, Gary
Vanier, and Aly Trompas had combined for a five
over par 17 on the tough 12th hole and Vanier had
missed a short birdie putt on the 13th.
"It looked pretty bad with five holes to play,"
admitted Stanford coach Bud Finger. "But all of
our golfers played the last five holes near par. That
stretch run brought out the true champion."
Stanford's victory was certainly a team effort as
all six Card golfers scored between 222 and 226.
Vanier and Baskins tied for sixth with 222, Trompas
and Bruce Robertson tied for ninth at 223, and
Tom Keelin and Denny Colvin also finished in the
top 20 with scores of 226.
Putting problems prevented Stanford players
from challenging individual winner Rex Caldwell of
San Femendo Valley State, who shot 71-72-73 for a
three over par 216 total.
Keelin slumped to 78-78 in the final two rounds
after a first round 70 and blamed "the worst putting
in a tournament in my life."
Baskins was in solid contention before he lost his
momentum with three putt greens from 15 feet on
7 and from 18 feet on 8. "Dave would have been in
good shape except for his poor putting," said team
manager Rich Cortez, who caddied for Baskins
Saturday.
Trompas started the day four shots behind the
leader but suffered a double bogey five on the third
hole and then three putted the Bth hole to drop out
of contention.
Vanier, the 1970 tournament winner, seemed to
have the best chance of catching Caldwell but he
also ran into putting problems. Playing with
Caldwell, Vanier was only one shot back before
missing crucial shot putts on 8 and 9.

Caldwell, on the other hand, credited a hot
putter with his victory, the first tournament win of
his life. "I've never putted so well," he said. "I spent
three hours practicing on the putting green the night
before the tournament."
The San Fernando Valley ace, who was a small
college All-American last year, won in championship
form with birdies on three of the last six holes.
Jim Bradford of San Diego State, the 1969
California Junior champion, turned in rounds of
74-72-72 to finish second at 218. First round leader
Larry Austin of UC-Santa Barbara placed third with
219.
The tournament's 28 team field was not
especially strong but defeating national powers like
San Jose State and San Diego State made the
Stanford victory impressive. The Spartans tied for
second in the Western Intercollegiates while the
Aztecs boast victories in the UC-Riverside
Invitational and the Vanderbug tournament along
with a second place finish in the strong Sun Devil
Classic.
Stanford, however, will not be able to sit back
and enjoy its victory very long. The Cards travel to
San Jose Country Club this afternoon at 1:00 p.m.
for a dual match against San Jose State. Two weeks
ago the Cards and the Spartans played to a 27-27 tie
at Stanford.
Bob Chapman of the Stanford freshmen was the
only player to break par in Saturday's final round.
Chapman fired a one under par 70 for a 54 hole
total of 225, leading the frosh to a 12th place finish.
Stanford's junior varsity finished one stroke behind
the frosh at 934.
Other top frosh scores included Gary Hamblet at
231, Mike McGowan at 235, and Mike Mcßride with
242. Dennis Conrad and Sandy McCall each shot
229 to lead the JV while Jim Dwulet had 237 and
Steve Collins shot 239.
Stanford sports information director Bob
Murphy was a busy man on Saturday. Besides
compiling all the scores for various Bay Area
newspapers and the wire services, Murphy caddied
for Aly Trompas during the final round.
Stan Lacore of Stanislaus State, who shot 104 in
Thursday's first round, quit after six holes Friday.

stretch run brought out the true champion."
Stanford's victory was certainly a team effort as
all six Card golfers scored between 222 and 226.
Vanier and Baskins tied for sixth with 222, Trompas
and Bruce Robertson tied for ninth at 223, and
Tom Keelin and Denny Colvin also finished in the
top 20 with scores of 226.
Putting problems prevented Stanford players
from challenging individual winner Rex Caldwell of
San Femendo Valley State, who shot 71-72-73 for a
three over par 216 total.
Keelin slumped to 78-78 in the final two rounds
after a first round 70 and blamed "the worst putting
in a tournament in my life."
Baskins was in solid contention before he lost his
momentum with three putt greens from 15 feet on
7 and from 18 feet on 8. "Dave would have been in
good shape except for his poor putting," said team
manager Rich Cortez, who caddied for Baskins
Saturday.
Trompas started the day four shots behind the
leader but suffered a double bogey five on the third
hole and then three putted the Bth hole to drop out
of contention.
Vanier, the 1970 tournament winner, seemed to
have the best chance of catching Caldwell but he
also ran into putting problems. Playing with
Caldwell, Vanier was only one shot back before
missing crucial shot putts on 8 and 9.

Caldwell, on the other hand, credited a hot
putter with his victory, the first tournament win of
his life. "I've never putted so well," he said. "I spent
three hours practicing on the putting green the night
before the tournament."
The San Fernando Valley ace, who was a small
college All-American last year, won in championship
form with birdies on three of the last six holes.
Jim Bradford of San Diego State, the 1969
California Junior champion, turned in rounds of
74-72-72 to finish second at 218. First round leader
Larry Austin of UC-Santa Barbara placed third with
219.
The tournament's 28 team field was not
especially strong but defeating national powers like
San Jose State and San Diego State made the
Stanford victory impressive. The Spartans tied for
second in the Western Intercollegiates while the
Aztecs boast victories in the UC-Riverside
Invitational and the Vanderbug tournament along
with a second place finish in the strong Sun Devil
Classic.
Stanford, however, will not be able to sit back
and enjoy its victory very long. The Cards travel to
San Jose Country Club this afternoon at 1:00 p.m.
for a dual match against San Jose State. Two weeks
ago the Cards and the Spartans played to a 27-27 tie
at Stanford.
Bob Chapman of the Stanford freshmen was the
only player to break par in Saturday's final round.
Chapman fired a one under par 70 for a 54 hole
total of 225, leading the frosh to a 12th place finish.
Stanford's junior varsity finished one stroke behind
the frosh at 934.
Other top frosh scores included Gary Hamblet at
231, Mike McGowan at 235, and Mike Mcßride with
242. Dennis Conrad and Sandy McCall each shot
229 to lead the JV while Jim Dwulet had 237 and
Steve Collins shot 239.
Stanford sports information director Bob
Murphy was a busy man on Saturday. Besides
compiling all the scores for various Bay Area
newspapers and the wire services, Murphy caddied
for Aly Trompas during the final round.
Stan Lacore of Stanislaus State, who shot 104 in
Thursday's first round, quit after six holes Friday.

TENNIS ANYONE?—Some members of the Chinese table tennis team are shown in action before a
packed house at Maples Pavilion last Friday. The Chinese played seven exhibition matches plus a special
match involving Stanford student Robert Shur. Shur was defeated 21-7 as the crowd cheered his every
score.
