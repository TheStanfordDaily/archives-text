# Huskies Crush Crew
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
The Stanford crew lost badly
yesterday to the University of
Washington, but the prospects are
hopeful for Stanford's yearly
confrontation with Cal next week,
following the Huskies' win over
Cal on Saturday.
The Washington and Stanford
crews rowed four-man shells for
variety, breaking up their usual
eights, but both Stanford Varsity
fours lost by 12 and 13 seconds to
the Huskies on a very calm course
at Belmont.
Rowing eights, Washington had
pulled ahead of their Cal hosts the
day before in the Oakland estuary
to win by two and a half lengths.
Stanford and Cal will race in
eights next Saturday, rather than
in fours.
Washington's clean sweep of
Stanford included the Frosh eight,
which finished 17 seconds in the
wake of the opposing boat. A
Junior Varsity four was beaten,
and a three-way race between two
Stanford fours made up of frosh
and JV's likewise were downed by
the Washington frosh second four.
The Washington crew which
regularly dominates West Coast
competition, was not the only
crew to defeat Stanford recently.
Last week in Los Angeles saw
Stanford losses to UCLA and
Long Beach State. Long Beach's
record has been strong this year
and it may bring Washington to its
knees in the Western Springs in
mid-May.
The closest contest last week
came when the JV lost by only
half a length to USC in the
Harbach Cup races Friday. The
Varsity lost to both UCLA and

USC in the same races, but two
days later managed to take second
place against Long Beach State,
ahead of Loyola. The frosh
likewise were unable to win any
of their races.
This year's crew is slightly
undermanned, as the JV eight
needs two freshman for a full
boat. The sport's requirement for
year-round practice usually causes
some dropouts, and the effect this
year has been worse than usual.
The two varsity fours which
raced Washington will probably be
put together as an eight against
California next week. Yesterday's
boats were Kelly Cawley, stroke;
Kurt Schoknecht, 3; Paul
Preissler, 2; George Gantz, bow;
and Ron Duvall, cox, with the
other boat holding Doug Blayney
at stroke; Jerry Powell, 3; James
Topic, 2; Bob Kasper, bow; and
Dave Simmons as cox.
