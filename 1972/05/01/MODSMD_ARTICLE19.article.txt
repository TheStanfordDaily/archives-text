Two long scoring passes by
junior quarterback Mike Boryla
were the bright spots for
Stanford's offense Saturday as
Coach Jack Christiansen's team
made its scrimmage debut before
a small crowd at Stanford
Stadium.
The offense gave up the ball
four consecutive times by
interceptions or fumbles before
Boryla woke up the crowd with a
43-yard touchdown pass to
sophomore runningback Scott
Laidlow on a well executed play
action call.
After the first touchdown pass
the offense began the next drive
on its 30. On the second play,
Boryla found senior wide receiver
Eric Cross with a 66-yard
touchdown pass. The catch was
cheered by the fans, who watched
Cross sit out almost all of last
season with a bad hamstring after
a great sophomore campaign.
Boryla had the most impressive
statistics for the day, with 13
completions in 18 passes for 207
yards and those two touchdowns.
He had one interception when
Max Goldstein who played
aggressively at safety grabbed off
a pass in the end zone.
The only other scoring play of
the game came when junior
college transfer Dave Ottmar
connected with Scott Boughton
for 11 yards.
It should be noted that three
of the Card's probable defensive
starters didn't play. Pierre
Perreault (four wisdom teeth
removed), Roger Cowan (bone
spurs in shoulder), and Pete
Hanson (recovering from knee
surgery).
