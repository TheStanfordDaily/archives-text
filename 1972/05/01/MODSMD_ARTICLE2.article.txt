# 'Peace Drive' Begins Congressional Lobby
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Stanford students announced Fri
day a drive aimed at persuading four
Bay Area congressmen to endorse
immediate cessation of bombing in
Indochina and "withdrawal of United
States military personnel" within 30
days.
"Peace Drive 14055" seeks the
passage of congressional bill H.R.
14055, which would halt all further
funding for American participation in
the war in Indochina 30 days after its
passage. The resolution provides for a
30 day extension of funding if
American prison ers-of-war are not
repatriated by the North Vietnamese
and Viet Cong.
Stanford Law Association President

Ed Hayes and junior Jim Friend
announced "Peace Drive 14055" last
Friday at a news conference at San
Francisco International Airport. Hayes
said the drive is directed at Congress
men William S. Mailliard (R.-San
Francisco), George P. Miller (D.-
Alameda), Don H. Clausen (R.-
Crescent City) and Charles S. Gubser
(R.-Gilroy).
Hayes said the other five Bay Area
congressmen have already announced
their cosponsorship of H.R. 14055.
They are: Paul N. (Pete) McCloskey,
Jr. (R.-Portola Valley), Don Edwards
(D.-San Jose), Philip Burton (D.-San
Francisco), Ronald V. Dellums (D.-
Berkeley) and Jerome R. Waldie
(D.-Antioch).
Speaking of the four congressmen
who have not endorsed H.R. 14055,
Hayes said "let us give them fair
warning. Peace Drive 14055 will be in
their districts working to exert over
whelming constituent pressure seeking
their endorsement."
Hayes said that each of the four
"represent districts where the student
vote can decide the election and where
anti-war sentiment is strong. Should
they refuse to endorse and vote for
H.R. 14055, we will organize to defeat
them in the upcoming November
election."
Friend told the Daily yesterday
that May 13 was scheduled to be the
kick-off date for the circulation of
petitions supporting H.R. 14055 in the
four congressmen's districts. Friend
said that Peace Drive planned to
contact the four congressmen by the

end of May to tell them of the drive's
progress and to present them with
the petitions
The bill is sponsored in the House
of Representatives by Congressman
Robert Drinan (D.-Mass.) and in the
Senate by Mike Gravel (D.-Alaska).
According to Hayes, the drive has the
support of California Senators -John
Tunney and Alan Cranston, Mayor
Warren Widener of Berkeley, Mayor
Kirke Comstock of Palo Alto, the Palo
Alto City Council, former New York
Congressman Allard K. Lowenstein,
and President Richard Lyman.
Lowenstein spoke at Bishop Audi
torium Thursday in support of Peace
Drive 14055. He said "if this bill is
passed, the President will have to find
a new way to conduct himself." He
denounced Nixon for creating the
"notion that the only alternative to
Nixon's peace plan is surrender."
Although Lowenstein is again seek
ing election to Congress, he feels that
the most important Congressional race
in the nation is McCloskey's. "If this
man is silenced, every politician in
Congress will understand that not even
Pete McCloskey could survive because
of his position on the war."
Lowenstein, National Chairman of
the Americans for Democratic Action,
said Nixon can be defeated this
November. He said, "Nixon has
doubled unemployment, peaked infla
tion, and has a deficit of such
enormous proportions that Franklin
Roosevelt would roll over with jea
lousy. How can this man possibly be
reelected?"

immediate cessation of bombing in
Indochina and "withdrawal of United
States military personnel" within 30
days.
"Peace Drive 14055" seeks the
passage of congressional bill H.R.
14055, which would halt all further
funding for American participation in
the war in Indochina 30 days after its
passage. The resolution provides for a
30 day extension of funding if
American prison ers-of-war are not
repatriated by the North Vietnamese
and Viet Cong.
Stanford Law Association President

Ed Hayes and junior Jim Friend
announced "Peace Drive 14055" last
Friday at a news conference at San
Francisco International Airport. Hayes
said the drive is directed at Congress
men William S. Mailliard (R.-San
Francisco), George P. Miller (D.-
Alameda), Don H. Clausen (R.-
Crescent City) and Charles S. Gubser
(R.-Gilroy).
Hayes said the other five Bay Area
congressmen have already announced
their cosponsorship of H.R. 14055.
They are: Paul N. (Pete) McCloskey,
Jr. (R.-Portola Valley), Don Edwards
(D.-San Jose), Philip Burton (D.-San
Francisco), Ronald V. Dellums (D.-
Berkeley) and Jerome R. Waldie
(D.-Antioch).
Speaking of the four congressmen
who have not endorsed H.R. 14055,
Hayes said "let us give them fair
warning. Peace Drive 14055 will be in
their districts working to exert over
whelming constituent pressure seeking
their endorsement."
Hayes said that each of the four
"represent districts where the student
vote can decide the election and where
anti-war sentiment is strong. Should
they refuse to endorse and vote for
H.R. 14055, we will organize to defeat
them in the upcoming November
election."
Friend told the Daily yesterday
that May 13 was scheduled to be the
kick-off date for the circulation of
petitions supporting H.R. 14055 in the
four congressmen's districts. Friend
said that Peace Drive planned to
contact the four congressmen by the

end of May to tell them of the drive's
progress and to present them with
the petitions
The bill is sponsored in the House
of Representatives by Congressman
Robert Drinan (D.-Mass.) and in the
Senate by Mike Gravel (D.-Alaska).
According to Hayes, the drive has the
support of California Senators -John
Tunney and Alan Cranston, Mayor
Warren Widener of Berkeley, Mayor
Kirke Comstock of Palo Alto, the Palo
Alto City Council, former New York
Congressman Allard K. Lowenstein,
and President Richard Lyman.
Lowenstein spoke at Bishop Audi
torium Thursday in support of Peace
Drive 14055. He said "if this bill is
passed, the President will have to find
a new way to conduct himself." He
denounced Nixon for creating the
"notion that the only alternative to
Nixon's peace plan is surrender."
Although Lowenstein is again seek
ing election to Congress, he feels that
the most important Congressional race
in the nation is McCloskey's. "If this
man is silenced, every politician in
Congress will understand that not even
Pete McCloskey could survive because
of his position on the war."
Lowenstein, National Chairman of
the Americans for Democratic Action,
said Nixon can be defeated this
November. He said, "Nixon has
doubled unemployment, peaked infla
tion, and has a deficit of such
enormous proportions that Franklin
Roosevelt would roll over with jea
lousy. How can this man possibly be
reelected?"
