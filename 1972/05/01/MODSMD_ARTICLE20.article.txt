Communist Thrust Gains
SAIGON — South Vietnamese marines and rangers fought
savagely with the might of U.S. air and naval power
behind them yesterday in an effort to reopen national
Highway 1, lifeline of the northern front. A North
Vietnamese regiment stopped them cold.
As the North Vietnamese offensive moved through its
32nd day, the United States marshalled every available
warplane and warship in the Indochina theater for massive
attacks. U.S. vessels bombarded North Vietnam's coast
and communist positions in the South. B-52 bombers
made their heaviest strikes of the war around major battle
points in South Vietnam.
Nearly 100 of the eight-jet B-52 Stratofortresses
unleashed up to 2,500 tons of bombs on North
Vietnamese troop concentrations and staging areas
menacing major cities. The pattern of the strikes showed
how close large North Vietnamese forces were to major
cities. Some of the raids were within four miles of Quang
Tri and within five miles of Kontum. The bombers also
struck within 24 miles northwest of Saigon, closest since
the big Tet offensive in February 1968.
Since the present offensive began March 30, South
Vietnamese forces have been pushed from bases and
district towns along the DMZ back to Quang Tri, capital
of Quang Tri Province.
The North Vietnamese control the entire northern and
western sectors of the Province, and have outflanked the
South Vietnamese to push south of Quang Tri city toward
Hue, 35 miles to the south.
India, Pakistan To Talk
NEW DELHI — India and Pakistan completed yesterday
their first step toward a peace settlement by agreeing to a
summit meeting between Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
and President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
D.P. Dhar, Gandhi's special emissary at preliminary
talks held for the past four days in Pakistan, told
newsmen, "I have reason to believe that we can entertain
cautious optimism with regard to the outcome of the

summit talks. I think the talks will start on an auspicious
as well as a promising note."
A joint statement issued simultaneously in Rawalpindi
and New Delhi said the special emissary talks "were
marked with cordiality and a readiness on both sides to
appreciate each other's point of view."
Such friendly language had not been used by either
government in more than a year.
Diplomatic sources in Rawalpindi said the first two
points on the summit agenda would be withdrawal of
troops from occupied territories and an exchange of
prisoners. Then, the sources added, the two countries
would restore their diplomatic relations. Finally, they
would take up the issues of Pakistani recognition of
Bangladesh, the disputed state of Kashmir and mutual
disavowals of war.
Campaigning Continues
Top presidential contenders in tomorrow's Ohio
Democratic primary played to their political strengths
yesterday, with Sen. George S. McGovern warning the
Vietnam war has "infected every aspect of American life"
and Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey visiting four black
churches and marching in a Jewish parade.
The Ohio contest holds tomorrow's spotlight with
secondary attention on the Indiana balloting in which
Humphrey and Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace are the
top contenders for 76 convention delegates.
Primaries are also being held tomorrow in Alabama and
the District of Columbia. Anti-Wallace forces hope to take
control of the Alabama delegation from the governor.
Local groups are contesting the D.C. race.
Additional presidential primaries are scheduled later in
the week in Tennessee and North Carolina.
