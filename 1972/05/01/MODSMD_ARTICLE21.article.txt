# Education Meeting Discusses Minorities, Three-Year Degree
## 
### MARK WEAVER 
Discussions of the introduction of
cost-benefit analysis to education, the
continued impact of education on
minorities, and the three-year bache
lor's degree highlighted a weekend
conference on the "Future of Educa
tion in America."
Over 100 persons attended the
Bowman Alumni House Conference,
sponsored by the School of Education
and the Alumni Association.
Dr. Lewis B. Mayhew, one of four
professors of the School of Education
who spoke at the conference, predict
ed American colleges will see a whole
new breed of students and a much less
diverse curriculum in the future.
Mayhew forsees the enrollment of
many more students from the poor
and ethnic minority groups and that
the curriculums will reflect their
needs. "Already," he said, "the sub
stantial increases in numbers of some

ethnic minority groups have forced
institutions into adopting new instru
ments for admission, living arrange
ments, methods of financing and
curricular styles."
One result, Mayhew indicated "is a
strengthening shift away from educa
tion for a job in society toward
education for the pure joy of learn
ing." Mayhew added that this possi
bility makes the idea of a three-year
bachelor's degree intriguing.
The educational historian expects
universities to curtail activities and
concentrate on the purposes for which
they are most adequately suited.
He feels that the new breed of
students and the tightening of curricu
lums, coupled with precise planning
for the future through systems analy
sis, will bring the use of cost-benefit
analysis to American education for the
first time. "Realism would suggest that
when students become clients for an

educational service, they will expect
something significant for their
money," he said.
Professor Henry M. Levin told the
conference that the American educa
tional system has to change to make
true quality education available for all
students. Spending enormous sums for
things like compensatory education,
said Levin, is useless because our
educational system is a "class" institu
tion not geared to the needs or desires
of poor students who lack the right
skin color.
Education cannot devote itself to
simply remedial reading or other
partial solutions unless it takes into
account all the problems of less
privileged school districts—medical,
dental, nutritional, and social—and the
richer districts will have to bear the
costs of making this expensive educa
tion available to the less favored
districts, Levin said.

BRONZE RELIEFS—Workmen install bronze reliefs of Italian artist Arnaldo Pomodoro on the Cummings Art Building
Thursday while the artist looks on. The reliefs were formally unveiled Friday afternoon.
The sculptures, each measuring seven by four feet, were executed by Pomodoro while he was artist in residence here
in the spring of 1967. Originally in the form of plaster molds, they were shipped to Italy in the fall of 1970 for casting in
bronze under the artist's personal supervision.
