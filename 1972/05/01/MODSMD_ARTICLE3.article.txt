## Women Air Grievances In Complaint 
### EMMA PRICE (First of three parts) 
The Stanford Women's Union has
filed a Contract Compliance Com
plaint against the University charging
sex discrimination in employment.
The Complaint is based on about 350
questionnaires distributed to Univer
sity non-academic employees.
The complaint was filed last month
with the Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare. If HEW finds
overwhelming evidence of sex discrimi
nation at Stanford it could order the
elimination of all federal monetary
support to the University.
HEW has had plans for investigating
Stanford since April, 1971 when
Stanford alumna Nancy Cross filed a
complaint saying she was "particularly
aggrieved" by discriminatory practices
at Stanford with respect to sex and
race.
Leslie Rabine, a member of the
Women's Union which made the more
recent complaint, stated, "I would
sum up the complaint by saying that
many women who work at Stanford
are intimidated, isolated, and without
power. However, some women are
beginning to break out of that."
The women who prepared the
complaint doubt, however, whether it
will have much permanent effect on
the University. "HEW is talking to the
University, not us," Rabine noted.
'The real reason we wrote the
complaint was to find out the
conditions of women workers, and to
make contact with women who feel
the necessity for change so that when
HEW arrives women can act together
in unity."
Affirmative Action
The introduction to the complaint
states that the University does not
take seriously the Affirmative Action
program, which was designed to
increase the employment of women
and minorities at Stanford in response
to federal requirements.
The complaint reports that on
March 3, 1972, at the Academic
Council meeting, "a ripple of amuse
ment ran through the assembly" when
English Professor Ron Rebhoiz sug
gested that the Affirmative Action
program, which applies equallv to

faculty and staff, was a proper
function of govemment intervention.
"The faculty and administration are
aware of the Affirmative Action
program, and they disdain it,"the
complaint states.
As Dru Cornell, another member of
the Women's Union, put it, "No one
really knows about the Affirmative
Action program. When we gave copies
of the Affirmative Action program to
women workers, they were surprised
and delighted to find out they had so
many rights. But we cautioned them,
as Anne Miner had cautioned us, that
the administration has not yet decided
whether this program is official poli
cy."
The remainder of the complaint
discusses grievances that were register
ed on the questionnaires. The com
plaint contains extensive quotations
from individual questionnaires. Names
are not given on the complaint, but
will be available to the HEW investiga
tor on a confidential basis.
As Cornell explained, "The only
women who didn't want to remain
anonymous were radicals, because the
administration knows that they'll
make a fuss if they're fired."
Another major topic in the com
plaint is intimidation—supervisors who
refused to permit questionnaires to be
distributed or insisted on reading
completed questionnaires, for ex
ample.
The complaint also states that
many women expressed a desire to file
complaints with HEW but were
unwilling to do so they feared
losing their jobs.
Cynicism
Cornell commented, "I ran into a
lot of cynicism among the workers.
Two women wrote that they would
like to make a complaint, but they
knew they would just lose their jobs if
they did."
Another major section of the report
concerns hiring policies. In 1971 at
Stanford, the report states, women
comprised only 14.8 percent of the
job category "officials and managers,"
while comprising 93.2 percent of all
"office and clerical" workers.
"Once women are pushed into
low-status, low-navini' ioh classifi

cations they receive little considera
tion, few benefits, and an almost zero
opportunity for advancement," ac
cording to the complaint.
As an example, a questionnaire
filled out by a Tresidder employee is
cited. "We were told that women were
not being considered for a job as
baker's assistant. In general, the job
classification seem to be broken down
on male/female lines. Fry cooks, for
instance are men (and paid more)
although women often fill in for them
on breaks, days off, etc. In Tresidder,

the cooks, bakers, maintenance and
supervisors are men; salads and service
are women."
Another woman reported, "When I
originally applied for a job in another
department at S.U. (a job for which I
was quite qualified and in which I had
experience) they hired a male who had
no experience."
Secretaries
A third woman employee wrote
"Administrators generally get paid for
more work than their supporting staff
