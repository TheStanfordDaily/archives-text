# Proposed Bill Could Save Stanford $1/2 Million In Loan Interest
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
A bill that could save Stanford up to half a
million dollars a year in interest on long-term loans
has been introduced into the current session of the
state legislature.
Modeled after legislation in other states and
introduced at Stanford's request, the bill would
create a mechanism that would allow private higher
education institutions to benefit from tax-exempt
construction bonds. Currently, private college
construction bonds are not tax-exempt. Tax-exempt
bonds can be sold at a much lower rate of
interest—saving the University hundreds of
thousands of dollars annually.
The bill would establish a state authority which
would issue tax-exempt bonds with the newly
constructed facilities as collateral. The authority
would then lend the money back to the college at
cost.
According to Rod Adams, University investment
manager, tax-exempt bonds sell about two
percentage points less than a similarly guaranteed
corporate loan. On Stanford's large amount of
borrowed money this could amount to between
$250,000 and $500,000 annually, Adams claims.
Educational Facilities Act
The California Educational Facilities Authority
Act (AB 2014), as the bill is known, was introduced
by Assemblyman Dixon Arnett, (R.-Redwood City),
former Stanford director of community relations,
shortly before the March 15 deadline for
introduction of new bills.
According to Ken MacKenzie, a part-time
emplovee of University Relations and author of the

bill, the Association of Independent California
Colleges and Universities (AICCU), an association of
most of the private colleges in the state, now
supports and sponsors the bill although it was
originally introduced only by Stanford.
Adams explains that Stanford has been
"thinking" about this type of legislation for three
years. It's "not new or innovative" and has been
adopted in several eastern states including New
Jersey, he said.
Chance to Pass
Stanford finally introduced the legislation this
year because it now has a chance to pass, according
to Adams. "All I can say is that two years ago and
one year ago it | the bill] didn't have a chance to be
passed . . . Now, we believe there is a better than
even chance of having it passed," Adams said.
McKenzie, a law student, feels that the chances
for the bill's passage are uncertain, although he is
optimistic. "We've had favorable reaction" to the
bill, he said. "Or, at least, I know we have had no
adverse reaction" to the bill.
He admitted that it could take several years for
the bill to pass and that there are constitutional
questions about the bill. Although he feels it will
withstand a court test, MacKenzie expects the bill
to be challenged in court as unconstitutional as soon
as it is passed.
Institutional Assets
Stanford intends to ask for only loans from the
authority for "income producing institutional
assets" such as dormitories or a commissary,
according to Adams. He said the University would
not use money from the state authority to finance

buildings like a new library or law school. He said
the building must be something that 'has a charge
out and a revenue to it."
As written, the Assembly bill will allow private
colleges to finance new buildings and to refinance
buildings that have been completed within 10 years
before the time of the enactment of the bill.
Stanford now is borrowing money for current
construction with provisions for refinancing should
the bill pass, according to Adams.
Mackenzie said that because of the University's
charter it will not be able to advance the buildings
themselves as collateral for the loans. Instead,
Stanford would "put up full faith in credit." In
other words, Stanford would be able to secure the
loans on the basis of its credit rating—and
endowment.
Two Ways
MacKenzie explained that the authority could
work in two ways. It could direct, finance and
contract the building of college construction
directly, borrowing money through the issuance of
tax-exempt bonds. Or else, and this more likely in
Stanford's case, the college would borrow money
from the authority (at lower interest rates since the
authority would issue tax-exempt bonds) and would
control the construction—limiting the authority's
work to borrowing and lending money.
Regardless of the particular arrangements, the
bill prohibits the State from granting the authority
any money. All costs of the authority must be born
by the colleges using it.
The bill has been referred to the Committee on
Education where it now awaits a hearing.

for the bill's passage are uncertain, although he is
optimistic. "We've had favorable reaction" to the
bill, he said. "Or, at least, I know we have had no
adverse reaction" to the bill.
He admitted that it could take several years for
the bill to pass and that there are constitutional
questions about the bill. Although he feels it will
withstand a court test, MacKenzie expects the bill
to be challenged in court as unconstitutional as soon
as it is passed.
Institutional Assets
Stanford intends to ask for only loans from the
authority for "income producing institutional
assets" such as dormitories or a commissary,
according to Adams. He said the University would
not use money from the state authority to finance

buildings like a new library or law school. He said
the building must be something that 'has a charge
out and a revenue to it."
As written, the Assembly bill will allow private
colleges to finance new buildings and to refinance
buildings that have been completed within 10 years
before the time of the enactment of the bill.
Stanford now is borrowing money for current
construction with provisions for refinancing should
the bill pass, according to Adams.
Mackenzie said that because of the University's
charter it will not be able to advance the buildings
themselves as collateral for the loans. Instead,
Stanford would "put up full faith in credit." In
other words, Stanford would be able to secure the
loans on the basis of its credit rating—and
endowment.
Two Ways
MacKenzie explained that the authority could
work in two ways. It could direct, finance and
contract the building of college construction
directly, borrowing money through the issuance of
tax-exempt bonds. Or else, and this more likely in
Stanford's case, the college would borrow money
from the authority (at lower interest rates since the
authority would issue tax-exempt bonds) and would
control the construction—limiting the authority's
work to borrowing and lending money.
Regardless of the particular arrangements, the
bill prohibits the State from granting the authority
any money. All costs of the authority must be born
by the colleges using it.
The bill has been referred to the Committee on
Education where it now awaits a hearing.
A bill that could save Stanford up to half a
million dollars a year in interest on long-term loans
has been introduced into the current session of the
state legislature.
Modeled after legislation in other states and
introduced at Stanford's request, the bill would
create a mechanism that would allow private higher
education institutions to benefit from tax-exempt
construction bonds. Currently, private college
construction bonds are not tax-exempt. Tax-exempt
bonds can be sold at a much lower rate of
interest—saving the University hundreds of
thousands of dollars annually.
The bill would establish a state authority which
would issue tax-exempt bonds with the newly
constructed facilities as collateral. The authority
would then lend the money back to the college at
cost.
According to Rod Adams, University investment
manager, tax-exempt bonds sell about two
percentage points less than a similarly guaranteed
corporate loan. On Stanford's large amount of
borrowed money this could amount to between
$250,000 and $500,000 annually, Adams claims.
Educational Facilities Act
The California Educational Facilities Authority
Act (AB 2014), as the bill is known, was introduced
by Assemblyman Dixon Arnett, (R.-Redwood City),
former Stanford director of community relations,
shortly before the March 15 deadline for
introduction of new bills.
According to Ken MacKenzie, a part-time
emplovee of University Relations and author of the

bill, the Association of Independent California
Colleges and Universities (AICCU), an association of
most of the private colleges in the state, now
supports and sponsors the bill although it was
originally introduced only by Stanford.
Adams explains that Stanford has been
"thinking" about this type of legislation for three
years. It's "not new or innovative" and has been
adopted in several eastern states including New
Jersey, he said.
Chance to Pass
Stanford finally introduced the legislation this
year because it now has a chance to pass, according
to Adams. "All I can say is that two years ago and
one year ago it | the bill] didn't have a chance to be
passed . . . Now, we believe there is a better than
even chance of having it passed," Adams said.
McKenzie, a law student, feels that the chances
for the bill's passage are uncertain, although he is
optimistic. "We've had favorable reaction" to the
bill, he said. "Or, at least, I know we have had no
