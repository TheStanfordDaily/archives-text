## US Presence In Asia Needed 
### 
w. w. rostow

Three of the major events of
1972 have concerned Asia:
the internecine struggle on the
Indian subcontinent; President
Nixon's trip to China; and the
massive North Vietnamese
invasion of South Vietnam. Each
deeply involved the United States;
but they came when there is great
confusion about our interest in
Asia.
The passionate debate over
Vietnam has, of course,
contributed to this
confusion—bringing to American
political life a strand of feeling
that we should depart Asia and
leave its people to their own

devices. On the other hand, most
Americans understand in their
bones that Asia will be more,
rather than less, important in our
future than it has been in the past;
that we simply cannot turn our
backs on the part of the world
where two-thirds of humanity
lives; where the third industrial
power in the world is situated;
where the 800 million people of
China, the 600 million of the
Indian subcontinent, and the 300
million of Southeast Asia are
rapidly modernizing.
Nuclear Weapons
There is an awareness within us
that it was from an Asia, moving
toward domination by a single
power, that the attack on Pearl
Harbor came; that China is a
nuclear power; and that -Japan,
India and others in Asia might
acquire nuclear weapons if we
prove an inattentive or unreliable
friend or ally.
But, still, we as a nation lack a
consensus on our interest in Asia.

Historically, this lack stems in
part from the initial asymmetry
between our experiences across
the Atlantic and across the
Pacific. From the beginnings of
our nationhood we were
embroiled with the balance of
power in Europe. For example,
our independence was achieved,
the Louisiana Territory and
Alaska acquired only because
Americans could exploit the
conflicts among European powers.
When in 1917, Britain and
British dominance of the Atlantic
were threatened by unrestricted
German submarine warfare, it was
a shock for America to have to
throw its weight directly into the
European power balance to
prevent the hegemony of a single
power. Nevertheless, there was
continuity; for Americans had
known for more than a century
that a Europe united under a
single power could threaten the
United States.
Asia Different
It was different in Asia.
Initially, traditional Asia did not
represent a threat to America. It
was an arena within which more
advanced nations could compete
for commerce and power; the
missionaries, for converts. But
starting with the industrialization
of Japan and Russia from the
mid-1880s, real military potential
began to emerge in Asia.
The beginning of modern
American policy toward Asia is
the line drawn by President
Franklin Roosevelt's resistance to
the Japanese takeover of southern
Indochina in 1940-41, a resistance
marked by the cutting off of
American trade in scrap metal and
oil and the sequestering of
Japanese assets in the United
States. Here, contrary to every
short-run interest in avoiding a
war in Asia, President Roosevelt
could not bnng himself to
acquiesce in Japanese hegemony
in East Asia. He chose, in effect,
to risk direct military
confrontation with the major
power in Asia.
The experience in World War II
underlined to Americans that we
could be threatened from Asia, as

from Europe, if a single power
achieved hegemony in that region.
Starting in 1949, the
underlying symmetry in our
approaches to Europe and Asia
became institutionalized in NATO
and in a series of military
arrangements stretching from
Tokyo and Seoul to Canberra and
Wellington. The Presidents and
Congress recognized in these pacts
that we had an abiding interest in
the balance of power in both
Europe and Asia.
The debate over Vietnam has
shaken that consensus at an
unfortunate time. Events in Asia
since 1964 have made the
achievement of a stable balance of
power there more likely than ever
before in the past: The
intensification of the Sino-Soviet
split; the failure of the
Peking-Hanoi-Jakarta effort to
collapse Southeast Asia in 1965;
the more moderate policy in
Peking since the failure of the
Cultural Revolution; the rising
strength of nationalism and the
momentum of modernization in
South Korea and Southeast Asia;
the emergence of a Japan capable
of using its resources and political
influence to help stabilize the
whole region.
Working steadily, reliably and
purposefully with these forces,
the United States could help give
substance to these hopeful joint
passages from the
Chinese-American communique of
Feb. 27, 1972, issued at Shanghai:
.. the two sides state
that . . . neither should seek
hegemony in the Asia-Pacific
region and each is opposed to
efforts by any other country or
group of countries to establish
such hegemony"; they also
support "respect for the
sovereignty and territorial
integrity of all states,
nonaggression . . . noninterference
in the affairs of other states . . ."
The consolidation of stability
in Asia is endangered by two
possibilities.
First, a convulsive change in
U.S. policy toward Southeast
Asia. Why is Southeast Asia so
important in the Asian balance of
power? Because its population
and resources give it a weight
approximating that of Latin
America or Africa; because it
commands the sea routes of the
Southwest Pacific, which are of
critical importance to Australia,
New Zealand and Japan, as well as
the United States; because it
commands the eastern Indian
Ocean, an area of critical
importance to India and Burma,
as well as Malaysia and Singapore;
because Southeast Asia is a critical

buffer zone, if it remains
independence, separating India
and China.
Given these powerful, abiding
intersts in the independence of
Southeast Asia, an American
withdrawal of commitment to the
area is likely to yield not peace
but a larger war than that now
proceeding in Indochina.
The second danger lies in the
nuclear future of Asia. Here again,
American policy may be the
critical variable. India and Japan
command the technical capacity
to produce nuclear weapons. They
have refrained from doing so for
political and military reasons. One
of the most powerful is that a
reliable relation to a reliable
United States is more
advantageous than going it alone.
As the history of Sino-Soviet
relations since 1958 suggests, a
decision to go it alone in nuclear
matters can convert allies and
friends into near enemies.
I do not believe a Japanese
decision, for example, to produce
nuclear weapons would
necessarily yield all the hostility
of the Sino-Soviet split; but the
extraordinarily intimate political
and economic ties across the
Pacific that have evolved in the
past quarter-century are closely
related to the fact that the United
States is the nuclear guarantor of
Japan, just as the American
nuclear relation to Western
Europe lies at the heart of
political and economic
cooperation across the North
Atlantic.
Further nuclear proliferation
could fragment those essential
stabilizing links and upset the
balance of power in both Europe
and Asia. An American
withdrawal of commitment to
Southeast Asia could well bring
about that result in Asia, with
profound consequences for our
relations in every other part of the
world.
I believe, therefore, that we
ought to try to pull ourselves out
of the deep and painful grooves of
the debate over Vietnam and
reexamine our abiding interests in
the vital Asia that is emerging. If
we do so, I am confident that our
commitments in Southeast Asia
will be seen as an essential
component of our interests and
the interests of all who share the
objective of a stable and peaceful
Asia.

that we should depart Asia and
leave its people to their own

devices. On the other hand, most
Americans understand in their
bones that Asia will be more,
rather than less, important in our
future than it has been in the past;
that we simply cannot turn our
backs on the part of the world
where two-thirds of humanity
lives; where the third industrial
power in the world is situated;
where the 800 million people of
China, the 600 million of the
Indian subcontinent, and the 300
million of Southeast Asia are
rapidly modernizing.
Nuclear Weapons
There is an awareness within us
that it was from an Asia, moving
toward domination by a single
power, that the attack on Pearl
Harbor came; that China is a
nuclear power; and that -Japan,
India and others in Asia might
acquire nuclear weapons if we
prove an inattentive or unreliable
friend or ally.
But, still, we as a nation lack a
consensus on our interest in Asia.

Historically, this lack stems in
part from the initial asymmetry
between our experiences across
the Atlantic and across the
Pacific. From the beginnings of
our nationhood we were
embroiled with the balance of
power in Europe. For example,
our independence was achieved,
the Louisiana Territory and
Alaska acquired only because
Americans could exploit the
conflicts among European powers.
When in 1917, Britain and
British dominance of the Atlantic
were threatened by unrestricted
German submarine warfare, it was
a shock for America to have to
throw its weight directly into the
European power balance to
prevent the hegemony of a single
power. Nevertheless, there was
continuity; for Americans had
known for more than a century
that a Europe united under a
single power could threaten the
United States.
Asia Different
It was different in Asia.
Initially, traditional Asia did not
represent a threat to America. It
was an arena within which more
advanced nations could compete
for commerce and power; the
missionaries, for converts. But
starting with the industrialization
of Japan and Russia from the
mid-1880s, real military potential
began to emerge in Asia.
The beginning of modern
American policy toward Asia is
the line drawn by President
Franklin Roosevelt's resistance to
the Japanese takeover of southern
Indochina in 1940-41, a resistance
marked by the cutting off of
American trade in scrap metal and
oil and the sequestering of
Japanese assets in the United
States. Here, contrary to every
short-run interest in avoiding a
war in Asia, President Roosevelt
could not bnng himself to
acquiesce in Japanese hegemony
in East Asia. He chose, in effect,
to risk direct military
confrontation with the major
power in Asia.
The experience in World War II
underlined to Americans that we
could be threatened from Asia, as

from Europe, if a single power
achieved hegemony in that region.
Starting in 1949, the
underlying symmetry in our
approaches to Europe and Asia
became institutionalized in NATO
and in a series of military
arrangements stretching from
Tokyo and Seoul to Canberra and
Wellington. The Presidents and
Congress recognized in these pacts
that we had an abiding interest in
the balance of power in both
Europe and Asia.
The debate over Vietnam has
shaken that consensus at an
unfortunate time. Events in Asia
since 1964 have made the
achievement of a stable balance of
power there more likely than ever
before in the past: The
intensification of the Sino-Soviet
split; the failure of the
Peking-Hanoi-Jakarta effort to
collapse Southeast Asia in 1965;
the more moderate policy in
Peking since the failure of the
Cultural Revolution; the rising
strength of nationalism and the
momentum of modernization in
South Korea and Southeast Asia;
the emergence of a Japan capable
of using its resources and political
influence to help stabilize the
whole region.
Working steadily, reliably and
purposefully with these forces,
the United States could help give
substance to these hopeful joint
passages from the
Chinese-American communique of
Feb. 27, 1972, issued at Shanghai:
.. the two sides state
that . . . neither should seek
hegemony in the Asia-Pacific
region and each is opposed to
efforts by any other country or
group of countries to establish
such hegemony"; they also
support "respect for the
sovereignty and territorial
integrity of all states,
nonaggression . . . noninterference
in the affairs of other states . . ."
The consolidation of stability
in Asia is endangered by two
possibilities.
First, a convulsive change in
U.S. policy toward Southeast
Asia. Why is Southeast Asia so
important in the Asian balance of
power? Because its population
and resources give it a weight
approximating that of Latin
America or Africa; because it
commands the sea routes of the
Southwest Pacific, which are of
critical importance to Australia,
New Zealand and Japan, as well as
the United States; because it
commands the eastern Indian
Ocean, an area of critical
importance to India and Burma,
as well as Malaysia and Singapore;
because Southeast Asia is a critical

buffer zone, if it remains
independence, separating India
and China.
Given these powerful, abiding
intersts in the independence of
Southeast Asia, an American
withdrawal of commitment to the
area is likely to yield not peace
but a larger war than that now
proceeding in Indochina.
The second danger lies in the
nuclear future of Asia. Here again,
American policy may be the
critical variable. India and Japan
command the technical capacity
to produce nuclear weapons. They
have refrained from doing so for
political and military reasons. One
of the most powerful is that a
reliable relation to a reliable
United States is more
advantageous than going it alone.
As the history of Sino-Soviet
relations since 1958 suggests, a
decision to go it alone in nuclear
matters can convert allies and
friends into near enemies.
I do not believe a Japanese
decision, for example, to produce
nuclear weapons would
necessarily yield all the hostility
of the Sino-Soviet split; but the
extraordinarily intimate political
and economic ties across the
Pacific that have evolved in the
past quarter-century are closely
related to the fact that the United
States is the nuclear guarantor of
Japan, just as the American
nuclear relation to Western
Europe lies at the heart of
political and economic
cooperation across the North
Atlantic.
Further nuclear proliferation
could fragment those essential
stabilizing links and upset the
balance of power in both Europe
and Asia. An American
withdrawal of commitment to
Southeast Asia could well bring
about that result in Asia, with
profound consequences for our
relations in every other part of the
world.
I believe, therefore, that we
ought to try to pull ourselves out
of the deep and painful grooves of
the debate over Vietnam and
reexamine our abiding interests in
the vital Asia that is emerging. If
we do so, I am confident that our
commitments in Southeast Asia
will be seen as an essential
component of our interests and
the interests of all who share the
objective of a stable and peaceful
Asia.

Indian subcontinent, and the 300
million of Southeast Asia are
rapidly modernizing.
Nuclear Weapons
There is an awareness within us
that it was from an Asia, moving
toward domination by a single
power, that the attack on Pearl
Harbor came; that China is a
nuclear power; and that -Japan,
India and others in Asia might
acquire nuclear weapons if we
prove an inattentive or unreliable
friend or ally.
But, still, we as a nation lack a
consensus on our interest in Asia.

Historically, this lack stems in
part from the initial asymmetry
between our experiences across
the Atlantic and across the
Pacific. From the beginnings of
our nationhood we were
embroiled with the balance of
power in Europe. For example,
our independence was achieved,
the Louisiana Territory and
Alaska acquired only because
Americans could exploit the
conflicts among European powers.
When in 1917, Britain and
British dominance of the Atlantic
were threatened by unrestricted
German submarine warfare, it was
a shock for America to have to
throw its weight directly into the
European power balance to
prevent the hegemony of a single
power. Nevertheless, there was
continuity; for Americans had
known for more than a century
that a Europe united under a
single power could threaten the
United States.
Asia Different
It was different in Asia.
Initially, traditional Asia did not
represent a threat to America. It
was an arena within which more
advanced nations could compete
for commerce and power; the
missionaries, for converts. But
starting with the industrialization
of Japan and Russia from the
mid-1880s, real military potential
began to emerge in Asia.
The beginning of modern
American policy toward Asia is
the line drawn by President
Franklin Roosevelt's resistance to
the Japanese takeover of southern
Indochina in 1940-41, a resistance
marked by the cutting off of
American trade in scrap metal and
oil and the sequestering of
Japanese assets in the United
States. Here, contrary to every
short-run interest in avoiding a
war in Asia, President Roosevelt
could not bnng himself to
acquiesce in Japanese hegemony
in East Asia. He chose, in effect,
to risk direct military
confrontation with the major
power in Asia.
The experience in World War II
underlined to Americans that we
could be threatened from Asia, as

from Europe, if a single power
achieved hegemony in that region.
Starting in 1949, the
underlying symmetry in our
approaches to Europe and Asia
became institutionalized in NATO
and in a series of military
arrangements stretching from
Tokyo and Seoul to Canberra and
Wellington. The Presidents and
Congress recognized in these pacts
that we had an abiding interest in
the balance of power in both
Europe and Asia.
The debate over Vietnam has
shaken that consensus at an
unfortunate time. Events in Asia
since 1964 have made the
achievement of a stable balance of
power there more likely than ever
before in the past: The
intensification of the Sino-Soviet
split; the failure of the
Peking-Hanoi-Jakarta effort to
collapse Southeast Asia in 1965;
the more moderate policy in
Peking since the failure of the
Cultural Revolution; the rising
strength of nationalism and the
momentum of modernization in
South Korea and Southeast Asia;
the emergence of a Japan capable
of using its resources and political
influence to help stabilize the
whole region.
Working steadily, reliably and
purposefully with these forces,
the United States could help give
substance to these hopeful joint
passages from the
Chinese-American communique of
Feb. 27, 1972, issued at Shanghai:
.. the two sides state
that . . . neither should seek
hegemony in the Asia-Pacific
region and each is opposed to
efforts by any other country or
group of countries to establish
such hegemony"; they also
support "respect for the
sovereignty and territorial
integrity of all states,
nonaggression . . . noninterference
in the affairs of other states . . ."
The consolidation of stability
in Asia is endangered by two
possibilities.
First, a convulsive change in
U.S. policy toward Southeast
Asia. Why is Southeast Asia so
important in the Asian balance of
power? Because its population
and resources give it a weight
approximating that of Latin
America or Africa; because it
commands the sea routes of the
Southwest Pacific, which are of
critical importance to Australia,
New Zealand and Japan, as well as
the United States; because it
commands the eastern Indian
Ocean, an area of critical
importance to India and Burma,
as well as Malaysia and Singapore;
because Southeast Asia is a critical

buffer zone, if it remains
independence, separating India
and China.
Given these powerful, abiding
intersts in the independence of
Southeast Asia, an American
withdrawal of commitment to the
area is likely to yield not peace
but a larger war than that now
proceeding in Indochina.
The second danger lies in the
nuclear future of Asia. Here again,
American policy may be the
critical variable. India and Japan
command the technical capacity
to produce nuclear weapons. They
have refrained from doing so for
political and military reasons. One
of the most powerful is that a
reliable relation to a reliable
United States is more
advantageous than going it alone.
As the history of Sino-Soviet
relations since 1958 suggests, a
decision to go it alone in nuclear
matters can convert allies and
friends into near enemies.
I do not believe a Japanese
decision, for example, to produce
nuclear weapons would
necessarily yield all the hostility
of the Sino-Soviet split; but the
extraordinarily intimate political
and economic ties across the
Pacific that have evolved in the
past quarter-century are closely
related to the fact that the United
States is the nuclear guarantor of
Japan, just as the American
nuclear relation to Western
Europe lies at the heart of
political and economic
cooperation across the North
Atlantic.
Further nuclear proliferation
could fragment those essential
stabilizing links and upset the
balance of power in both Europe
and Asia. An American
withdrawal of commitment to
Southeast Asia could well bring
about that result in Asia, with
profound consequences for our
relations in every other part of the
world.
I believe, therefore, that we
ought to try to pull ourselves out
of the deep and painful grooves of
the debate over Vietnam and
reexamine our abiding interests in
the vital Asia that is emerging. If
we do so, I am confident that our
commitments in Southeast Asia
will be seen as an essential
component of our interests and
the interests of all who share the
objective of a stable and peaceful
Asia.

Three of the major events of
1972 have concerned Asia:
the internecine struggle on the
Indian subcontinent; President
Nixon's trip to China; and the
massive North Vietnamese
invasion of South Vietnam. Each
deeply involved the United States;
but they came when there is great
confusion about our interest in

The passionate debate over

But, still, we as a nation lack a
consensus on our interest in Asia.

Historically, this lack stems in
part from the initial asymmetry
between our experiences across
the Atlantic and across the
Pacific. From the beginnings of
our nationhood we were
embroiled with the balance of
power in Europe. For example,
our independence was achieved,
the Louisiana Territory and
Alaska acquired only because
Americans could exploit the
conflicts among European powers.
When in 1917, Britain and
British dominance of the Atlantic
were threatened by unrestricted
German submarine warfare, it was
a shock for America to have to
throw its weight directly into the
European power balance to
prevent the hegemony of a single
power. Nevertheless, there was
continuity; for Americans had
known for more than a century
that a Europe united under a
single power could threaten the
United States.
Asia Different
It was different in Asia.
Initially, traditional Asia did not
represent a threat to America. It
was an arena within which more
advanced nations could compete
for commerce and power; the
missionaries, for converts. But
starting with the industrialization
of Japan and Russia from the
mid-1880s, real military potential
began to emerge in Asia.
The beginning of modern
American policy toward Asia is
the line drawn by President
Franklin Roosevelt's resistance to
the Japanese takeover of southern
Indochina in 1940-41, a resistance
marked by the cutting off of
American trade in scrap metal and
oil and the sequestering of
Japanese assets in the United
States. Here, contrary to every
short-run interest in avoiding a
war in Asia, President Roosevelt
could not bnng himself to
acquiesce in Japanese hegemony
in East Asia. He chose, in effect,
to risk direct military
confrontation with the major
power in Asia.
The experience in World War II
underlined to Americans that we
could be threatened from Asia, as

from Europe, if a single power
achieved hegemony in that region.
Starting in 1949, the
underlying symmetry in our
approaches to Europe and Asia
became institutionalized in NATO
and in a series of military
arrangements stretching from
Tokyo and Seoul to Canberra and
Wellington. The Presidents and
Congress recognized in these pacts
that we had an abiding interest in
the balance of power in both
Europe and Asia.
The debate over Vietnam has
shaken that consensus at an
unfortunate time. Events in Asia
since 1964 have made the
achievement of a stable balance of
power there more likely than ever
before in the past: The
intensification of the Sino-Soviet
split; the failure of the
Peking-Hanoi-Jakarta effort to
collapse Southeast Asia in 1965;
the more moderate policy in
Peking since the failure of the
Cultural Revolution; the rising
strength of nationalism and the
momentum of modernization in
South Korea and Southeast Asia;
the emergence of a Japan capable
of using its resources and political
influence to help stabilize the
whole region.
Working steadily, reliably and
purposefully with these forces,
the United States could help give
substance to these hopeful joint
passages from the
Chinese-American communique of
Feb. 27, 1972, issued at Shanghai:
.. the two sides state
that . . . neither should seek
hegemony in the Asia-Pacific
region and each is opposed to
efforts by any other country or
group of countries to establish
such hegemony"; they also
support "respect for the
sovereignty and territorial
integrity of all states,
nonaggression . . . noninterference
in the affairs of other states . . ."
The consolidation of stability
in Asia is endangered by two
possibilities.
First, a convulsive change in
U.S. policy toward Southeast
Asia. Why is Southeast Asia so
important in the Asian balance of
power? Because its population
and resources give it a weight
approximating that of Latin
America or Africa; because it
commands the sea routes of the
Southwest Pacific, which are of
critical importance to Australia,
New Zealand and Japan, as well as
the United States; because it
commands the eastern Indian
Ocean, an area of critical
importance to India and Burma,
as well as Malaysia and Singapore;
because Southeast Asia is a critical

buffer zone, if it remains
independence, separating India
and China.
Given these powerful, abiding
intersts in the independence of
Southeast Asia, an American
withdrawal of commitment to the
area is likely to yield not peace
but a larger war than that now
proceeding in Indochina.
The second danger lies in the
nuclear future of Asia. Here again,
American policy may be the
critical variable. India and Japan
command the technical capacity
to produce nuclear weapons. They
have refrained from doing so for
political and military reasons. One
of the most powerful is that a
reliable relation to a reliable
United States is more
advantageous than going it alone.
As the history of Sino-Soviet
relations since 1958 suggests, a
decision to go it alone in nuclear
matters can convert allies and
friends into near enemies.
I do not believe a Japanese
decision, for example, to produce
nuclear weapons would
necessarily yield all the hostility
of the Sino-Soviet split; but the
extraordinarily intimate political
and economic ties across the
Pacific that have evolved in the
past quarter-century are closely
related to the fact that the United
States is the nuclear guarantor of
Japan, just as the American
nuclear relation to Western
Europe lies at the heart of
political and economic
cooperation across the North
Atlantic.
Further nuclear proliferation
could fragment those essential
stabilizing links and upset the
balance of power in both Europe
and Asia. An American
withdrawal of commitment to
Southeast Asia could well bring
about that result in Asia, with
profound consequences for our
relations in every other part of the
world.
I believe, therefore, that we
ought to try to pull ourselves out
of the deep and painful grooves of
the debate over Vietnam and
reexamine our abiding interests in
the vital Asia that is emerging. If
we do so, I am confident that our
commitments in Southeast Asia
will be seen as an essential
component of our interests and
the interests of all who share the
objective of a stable and peaceful
Asia.
