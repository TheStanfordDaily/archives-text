Convocation
(This is a letter sent to President
Richard Lyman.)
Dear President Lyman:
On Thursday, May 4, a student
strike has been called to
commemorate the tragedies at
Kent State, Jackson State, and the
continuing tragedy in Southeast
Asia. We feel that it is very
important that students all across
the nation take this day to
rededicate themselves towards an
end to the War.
The events of April 21 should
not be allowed to reoccur. The
Daily was correct in labeling the
scene as a spectacle of violence.
We are confident that you are as
reluctant as ourselves to see police

on campus, students beaten and
arrested, and the University
degenerate to chaos.
At the same time, we
sympathize with the desires of the
striking students to create a
dramatic protest against the war.
Surely every avenue of
opposition, including protest,
must be used.
A graduate student in History,
David Amor, has proposed the
following:
That on Thursday, May 4, in
memory' of the tragedy at Kent
State and Jackson State, and in
protest of continued American
involvement in the Indochina war,
there be held in Frost
Am pi theatre an official
convocation, sponsored by the
ASSU, the Faculty Senate and the
Administration of the University,
and presided over by the President
of the University, in which all
members of the unversity
community: faculty, students,
administrators and employees be
free to take part (i.e. classes
cancelled, workers given the day
off).
This Convocation would
address itself to the problem of
the role of the University and the
war. It should provide a forum
wherein information and
argument from all sectors of the
university community and
relevant organizations can be
presented, debated, and
questioned. Such a forum would
be in keeping both with the
gravity of the problem which
confronts Stanford University,
and with the nature of the
University as such, as an
institution formally committed to
the furthering of knowledge and
education.
We feel that the proposal offers
an opportunity for the kind of
dialogue between the different
elements of this community
which is sorely needed. We would
be willing to coordinate the
program of such a Convocation.

Violence
Editor, THE DAILY:
In reply to the letter by Chris
Gray (Daily, April 27) several
points must be made. First,
there is no doubt that Stanford is
an important battlefield in the
Indochina War. Research and
recruiting are going on here which
materially aid the present
aggression by U.S. forces in
Southeast Asia and which are
building a base for future
aggression against Third World
people in other parts of the world.
It is not Venceremos, Young
Crows or any other militant group
which has decided to make
Stanford a battlefield; it is the
ruling class.
Second, it is the lackeys of that
ruling class (Lyman, Tamm, etc.)
who have shown themselves to be
prepared to use any means they
can to maintain the dominance of
the military-industrial-academic
complex here. Phony CIP hearings
may be more subtle tactics than
running people down with police
cars, but the strategy is the same.
The strategy is to convince people
that there is no hope of removing
the complicity of Stanford in the
war.
Third, no politician, however
"left," can lead a capitalist
country out of capitalism or its
inevitable imperialist
consequences. Electing McGovern
President will not stop the war.
Only the Indochinese people can
do that, and only by military
victory. They did not freely
choose violence, but had it
forced upon them. They are

responding effectively and with a
magnificent will.
Chris Gray wants us to remain
passive and loving in the face of
unprovoked assaults and in the
face of those who close every
"legitimate" door in our face. He
might as well counsel our brothers
and sisters in Vietnam to respond
non-violently to napalm,
anti-personnel bombs, and all the
paraphenalia of death Stanford is
helping to send at their villages.
Anti-imperialist forces at
Stanford have not yet been as
effective as those at Quang Tri or
An Loc. Throwing rocks at pigs or
windows is not quite in the same
league. But when the time comes
for the "cute little Venceremos
machine guns" to be more than
decoration, where will Chris Gray
stand? As Regis Debrav has said:
"Each one has to decide which
side he is on- on the side of the
violence that represses or the
violence that liberates."

Elections
Editor, THE DAILY :
This is in response to the
article by Nathan Therien, in
Monday's Daily, in which he asks,
"When was the last election that
really made any difference, at
least as far as this war is
concerned?" This is like implying
that all the battles fought by the
Viet Cong and North Vietnamese
have been useless because they
still haven't won the war.
In fact we have come a long
way through elections. The
trouble is that we had so very far
to go. It's hard for today's
students to understand the
political climate at the time when
the public first became aware of
Vietnam. Russia's subjugation of
Eastern Europe, her suppression
of the Hungarian revolt, and her
total police state tactics, coupled
with Joe McCarthy's witch hunt,
had led the vast majority of
Americans to equate
anti-communism with freedom.
They forgot about the dangers of
fascism. They knew nothing of
the Geneva Agreements. So they
completely accepted the myth
about North Vietnam invading the
"sovereign state of South
Vietnam."
In those days pitifully few
congressmen opposed the war,
and even fewer voted against
funds for it. Today, as a result of
much electoral hard work, we
have a near-majority in the
Senate; with a few more votes we
can seriously hope to cut off
funds for the war. Elections have
also been a major factor in the
increase in public sentiment
against the war. Citizens are much
more willing to listen to someone
explaining what the war is all
about, when they are faced with
deciding how to vote.
No one can promise that we
will succeed in defeating Nixon.
Too many voters still don't
understand what the war is all
about, and too many still don't
care that Asians are dying, as long
as Americans are safe. This
election is just one more battle in
the long struggle to end the war.
But we are winning. We can't give
up now.
