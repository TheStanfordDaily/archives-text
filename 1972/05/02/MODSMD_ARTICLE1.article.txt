# Shockley Denied Approval For Grad Genetics Course
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
Professor William Shockley was refused University
approval yesterday to teach a graduate special course on
his research into "dysgenics," the study of worsening
genetic qualities.
Dean of the Graduate School Lincoln Moses made the
decision not to authorize the course despite the majority
of a faculty advisory committee which recommended
approval for the course, if it were given on a one-time,
one-quarter basis not for credit.
The text of the majority and minority reports appear
on pages 4, 5 and 6 of today's Daily.
Moses' letter to Shockley, a Nobel-prizewinner for
co-invention of the transistor, stated, "Your expertise for
teaching this course is subject to doubt."
He added that the course proposal was not sufficiently
objective. ". . . the reading list is directed almost wholly
to your own views. Your description of the course
displays it as polemical—a quality not generally
objectionable in a professor's communications, but
inappropriate to his classroom instruction."
The 62 year-old physicist responded yesterday that
"This is so in keeping with . . . the unwillingness of the
intellectual community to appraise things objectively and
dispassionately."
Threat
Shockley added that the threat to academic freedom
was "trivial" compared to the Administration's illusion
that all races of mankind are genetically equal. He
describes this as "the illusion of flat human quality."
He interprets it as an illusion "so central to the
thinking of the graduate school administration at
Stanford, as to exclude a sincere search for truth."
Shockley's proposed course, on new methods of
research dealing with "the determination of the Caucasian
fraction of the ancestry of American Negro populations,"
the "geneticity of IQ," and the relation between IQ and
personality traits, took the five-member faculty
committee three months to review.
Besides receiving no credit as a result of Moses'
decision, Shockley's course will not be listed in the
University catalogue. Nevertheless, Moses said, Shockley is
free to publicize on his own and teach in University
facilities any course he wishes. Shockley had "no
comment" on this possibility.
The committee's three-member majority, which
favored approving the course, also upheld Shockley's
competence in the genetics and statistics required to teach
the course.
After expressing some doubts about his lack of
publication in respected scientific journals, they wrote, "a
Stanford professor who has worked vigorously in a field
for a half dozen or more years—even without formal
training in it—must be adjudged competent if he declares
himself to be so."
Committee Majority
The majority of the advisory committee included
Profs. Bradley Efron, statistics; Nathan Maccoby,
communications; and Robert Sears, psychology, former
dean of humanities and science.

But the two other members, Colin Pittendrigh, biology,
a former graduate dean at Princeton, and Maurice Krahl,
chairman of physiology, found him lacking competence.
Pittendrigh added that in his judgement, Shockley had not
"responded adequately," to the "stringent" criticism
which other scientists have leveled at his theories.
However, Shockley stated yesterday that whether his
course would present a one-sided view of the relation
between genes and intelligence was "irrelevant,"
considering that the "preponderance" of opinions on the
subject here were quite opposed to his.
Asking experts who disagree to speak in his class would
be "entirely appropriate but unnecessary, because the
opposite view is so prevalent." The effect would be to
bring the "center of gravity" on this issue back to where it
belonged, Shockley said. He added that the committee
had failed to deal with any of the issues in genetics he has
raised.
The majority of the committee took a dim view of
Shockley's theory that the genetic potential for
intelligence among blacks is generally inferior to whites.
He treats his theories "as if they were solid enough ... for
purposes of making public policy," they said, and he has
proposed what seem to be "genocidal policies."
Majority Opinion
But instead of the graduate students being
"significantly poisoned by error," the majority said, the
students would have an opportunity to subject his views
to "open and objective examination."
Pittendrigh maintained, however, that the scope of the
proposed course, in attempting to deal with questions of
the "future of humanity" and "moral obligations" to
study dysgenics, was so broad that a one-quarter course
could not treat it properly. "It belongs on a public
political platform, not in the classroom of a Graduate
School," he said.
The committee also questioned the Departments of
Genetics, Biology, and Psychology as to whether they
would offer Shockley's course, or if not, grant credit for it
as part of a student's requirements for an advanced
degree. The answer to the committee was negative in both
cases from each department.
Shockley's course is the first to have been evaluated
under new guidelines for graduate specials approved by
the Academic Senate in February. Very few graduate
specials are generally offered.
The committee which drew up the guidelines was
created in June 1971, shortly before Shockley made his
proposal for the course.
While Dean Moses maintains that this guideline
committee was not intended to deal specifically with the
problems raised by Shockley's course, Julius Moravcsik of
philosophy, a member of the committee, said, "the
Shockley proposal may have shown we needed
standards."
Following a proposal by Pittendrigh, however, Moses
has said a review of all graduate special courses will begin
immediately under the new guidelines. Pittendrigh
commented yesterday that all these courses "should be
reviewed with an equally stringent hand."

Following a proposal by Pittendrigh, however, Moses
has said a review of all graduate special courses will begin
immediately under the new guidelines. Pittendrigh
commented yesterday that all these courses "should be
reviewed with an equally stringent hand."
Professor William Shockley was refused University
approval yesterday to teach a graduate special course on
his research into "dysgenics," the study of worsening
genetic qualities.
Dean of the Graduate School Lincoln Moses made the
decision not to authorize the course despite the majority
of a faculty advisory committee which recommended
approval for the course, if it were given on a one-time,
one-quarter basis not for credit.
The text of the majority and minority reports appear
on pages 4, 5 and 6 of today's Daily.
Moses' letter to Shockley, a Nobel-prizewinner for
co-invention of the transistor, stated, "Your expertise for
teaching this course is subject to doubt."
He added that the course proposal was not sufficiently
objective. ". . . the reading list is directed almost wholly
to your own views. Your description of the course
displays it as polemical—a quality not generally
objectionable in a professor's communications, but
inappropriate to his classroom instruction."
The 62 year-old physicist responded yesterday that
"This is so in keeping with . . . the unwillingness of the
intellectual community to appraise things objectively and
dispassionately."
Threat
Shockley added that the threat to academic freedom
was "trivial" compared to the Administration's illusion
that all races of mankind are genetically equal. He
describes this as "the illusion of flat human quality."
He interprets it as an illusion "so central to the
thinking of the graduate school administration at
Stanford, as to exclude a sincere search for truth."
Shockley's proposed course, on new methods of
research dealing with "the determination of the Caucasian
fraction of the ancestry of American Negro populations,"
the "geneticity of IQ," and the relation between IQ and
personality traits, took the five-member faculty
committee three months to review.
Besides receiving no credit as a result of Moses'
decision, Shockley's course will not be listed in the
University catalogue. Nevertheless, Moses said, Shockley is
free to publicize on his own and teach in University
facilities any course he wishes. Shockley had "no
comment" on this possibility.
The committee's three-member majority, which
favored approving the course, also upheld Shockley's
competence in the genetics and statistics required to teach
the course.
After expressing some doubts about his lack of
publication in respected scientific journals, they wrote, "a
Stanford professor who has worked vigorously in a field
for a half dozen or more years—even without formal
training in it—must be adjudged competent if he declares
himself to be so."
Committee Majority
The majority of the advisory committee included
Profs. Bradley Efron, statistics; Nathan Maccoby,
communications; and Robert Sears, psychology, former
dean of humanities and science.

But the two other members, Colin Pittendrigh, biology,
a former graduate dean at Princeton, and Maurice Krahl,
chairman of physiology, found him lacking competence.
Pittendrigh added that in his judgement, Shockley had not
"responded adequately," to the "stringent" criticism
which other scientists have leveled at his theories.
However, Shockley stated yesterday that whether his
course would present a one-sided view of the relation
between genes and intelligence was "irrelevant,"
considering that the "preponderance" of opinions on the
subject here were quite opposed to his.
Asking experts who disagree to speak in his class would
be "entirely appropriate but unnecessary, because the
opposite view is so prevalent." The effect would be to
bring the "center of gravity" on this issue back to where it
belonged, Shockley said. He added that the committee
had failed to deal with any of the issues in genetics he has
raised.
The majority of the committee took a dim view of
Shockley's theory that the genetic potential for
intelligence among blacks is generally inferior to whites.
He treats his theories "as if they were solid enough ... for
purposes of making public policy," they said, and he has
proposed what seem to be "genocidal policies."
Majority Opinion
But instead of the graduate students being
"significantly poisoned by error," the majority said, the
students would have an opportunity to subject his views
to "open and objective examination."
Pittendrigh maintained, however, that the scope of the
proposed course, in attempting to deal with questions of
the "future of humanity" and "moral obligations" to
study dysgenics, was so broad that a one-quarter course
could not treat it properly. "It belongs on a public
political platform, not in the classroom of a Graduate
School," he said.
The committee also questioned the Departments of
Genetics, Biology, and Psychology as to whether they
would offer Shockley's course, or if not, grant credit for it
as part of a student's requirements for an advanced
degree. The answer to the committee was negative in both
cases from each department.
Shockley's course is the first to have been evaluated
under new guidelines for graduate specials approved by
the Academic Senate in February. Very few graduate
specials are generally offered.
The committee which drew up the guidelines was
created in June 1971, shortly before Shockley made his
proposal for the course.
While Dean Moses maintains that this guideline
committee was not intended to deal specifically with the
problems raised by Shockley's course, Julius Moravcsik of
philosophy, a member of the committee, said, "the
Shockley proposal may have shown we needed
standards."

problems raised by Shockley's course, Julius Moravcsik of
philosophy, a member of the committee, said, "the
Shockley proposal may have shown we needed
standards."
Following a proposal by Pittendrigh, however, Moses
has said a review of all graduate special courses will begin
immediately under the new guidelines. Pittendrigh
commented yesterday that all these courses "should be
reviewed with an equally stringent hand."
Professor William Shockley was refused University
approval yesterday to teach a graduate special course on
his research into "dysgenics," the study of worsening
genetic qualities.
Dean of the Graduate School Lincoln Moses made the
decision not to authorize the course despite the majority
of a faculty advisory committee which recommended
approval for the course, if it were given on a one-time,
one-quarter basis not for credit.
The text of the majority and minority reports appear
on pages 4, 5 and 6 of today's Daily.
Moses' letter to Shockley, a Nobel-prizewinner for
co-invention of the transistor, stated, "Your expertise for
teaching this course is subject to doubt."
He added that the course proposal was not sufficiently
objective. ". . . the reading list is directed almost wholly
to your own views. Your description of the course
displays it as polemical—a quality not generally
objectionable in a professor's communications, but
inappropriate to his classroom instruction."
The 62 year-old physicist responded yesterday that
"This is so in keeping with . . . the unwillingness of the
intellectual community to appraise things objectively and
dispassionately."
Threat
Shockley added that the threat to academic freedom
was "trivial" compared to the Administration's illusion
that all races of mankind are genetically equal. He
describes this as "the illusion of flat human quality."
He interprets it as an illusion "so central to the
thinking of the graduate school administration at
Stanford, as to exclude a sincere search for truth."
Shockley's proposed course, on new methods of
research dealing with "the determination of the Caucasian
fraction of the ancestry of American Negro populations,"
the "geneticity of IQ," and the relation between IQ and
personality traits, took the five-member faculty
committee three months to review.
Besides receiving no credit as a result of Moses'
decision, Shockley's course will not be listed in the
University catalogue. Nevertheless, Moses said, Shockley is
free to publicize on his own and teach in University
facilities any course he wishes. Shockley had "no
comment" on this possibility.
The committee's three-member majority, which
favored approving the course, also upheld Shockley's
competence in the genetics and statistics required to teach
the course.
After expressing some doubts about his lack of
publication in respected scientific journals, they wrote, "a
Stanford professor who has worked vigorously in a field
for a half dozen or more years—even without formal
training in it—must be adjudged competent if he declares
himself to be so."
Committee Majority
The majority of the advisory committee included
Profs. Bradley Efron, statistics; Nathan Maccoby,
communications; and Robert Sears, psychology, former
dean of humanities and science.

But the two other members, Colin Pittendrigh, biology,
a former graduate dean at Princeton, and Maurice Krahl,
chairman of physiology, found him lacking competence.
Pittendrigh added that in his judgement, Shockley had not
"responded adequately," to the "stringent" criticism
which other scientists have leveled at his theories.
However, Shockley stated yesterday that whether his
course would present a one-sided view of the relation
between genes and intelligence was "irrelevant,"
considering that the "preponderance" of opinions on the
subject here were quite opposed to his.
Asking experts who disagree to speak in his class would
be "entirely appropriate but unnecessary, because the
opposite view is so prevalent." The effect would be to
bring the "center of gravity" on this issue back to where it
belonged, Shockley said. He added that the committee
had failed to deal with any of the issues in genetics he has
raised.
The majority of the committee took a dim view of
Shockley's theory that the genetic potential for
intelligence among blacks is generally inferior to whites.
He treats his theories "as if they were solid enough ... for
purposes of making public policy," they said, and he has
proposed what seem to be "genocidal policies."
Majority Opinion
But instead of the graduate students being
"significantly poisoned by error," the majority said, the
students would have an opportunity to subject his views
to "open and objective examination."
Pittendrigh maintained, however, that the scope of the
proposed course, in attempting to deal with questions of
the "future of humanity" and "moral obligations" to
study dysgenics, was so broad that a one-quarter course
could not treat it properly. "It belongs on a public
political platform, not in the classroom of a Graduate
School," he said.
The committee also questioned the Departments of
Genetics, Biology, and Psychology as to whether they
would offer Shockley's course, or if not, grant credit for it
as part of a student's requirements for an advanced
degree. The answer to the committee was negative in both
cases from each department.
Shockley's course is the first to have been evaluated
under new guidelines for graduate specials approved by
the Academic Senate in February. Very few graduate
specials are generally offered.
The committee which drew up the guidelines was
created in June 1971, shortly before Shockley made his
proposal for the course.
While Dean Moses maintains that this guideline
committee was not intended to deal specifically with the
problems raised by Shockley's course, Julius Moravcsik of
philosophy, a member of the committee, said, "the
Shockley proposal may have shown we needed
standards."
Following a proposal by Pittendrigh, however, Moses
has said a review of all graduate special courses will begin
immediately under the new guidelines. Pittendrigh
commented yesterday that all these courses "should be
reviewed with an equally stringent hand."
