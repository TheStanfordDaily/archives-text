# Dean Lincoln Moses' Decision on Graduate Special Course
## 
### 
Following is an April 25 letter from Graduate Dean
Lincoln Moses to Prof. William B. Shock ley, made public
after its receipt by Shock ley May J.
This replies to your request of 9 June 1971 for
authorization to offer a graduate special course entitled
"The Dysgenic Question: New Research Methodology
on Human Behavior Genetics and Racial Difference." 1
cannot begin without voicing my regret that you have
waited so long for a decision. Between the time that 1
had last approved a graduate special course and the time
that you submitted yours, the Faculty Senate approved
a new chargc to the Committee on Graduate Studies.
A part of this revised charge called for the Committee
on Graduate Studies to set standards by which the Dean
was to judge graduate special courses. The Committee on
Graduate Studies therefore turned to this task and only
in early January was the task complete. On 3 February, I
charged an ad hoc committee to advise me on the
conformance of your proposed course to those guide
lines. In charging the Committee, 1 voiced my hope that
they would be able to complete their work in time for a
decision before the beginning of Spring Quarter. They
worked hard, but were unable to meet this requested
target in time. Thus, you have had to wait a very long
time-to my regret as well, perhaps, as yours.
The report of the Committee reached me on the
afternoon of April 20th. I enclose a complete copy of
their transmittal. You will note that there is a majority
report and two minority reports. The Committee's
advice has been helpful to me in my reaching a decision.
You will observe that though the Committee sub
mitted three different reports, there is agreement on two
important points: first, the value of heterodoxy to a

university and its "obligation to encourage, not merely
condone, the expression of heterodox, 'dangerous,'
thoughts"; second, there is agreement that the Univer
sity has responsibility to maintain the worth of its im
primatur. All members of the Committee appear to have
found this latter point to be in some degree inconsistent
with your course. The majority report suggests that it be
permitted once only and then for zero units; each of the
minority reports recommends that the course not be
authorized at all.
My conclusion is favorable to the judgment of the
two minority reports; I will not authorize the course. My
primary reasons are two in number. First, your expertise
for teaching this course is subject to doubts; each report
shows such doubts; the majority resolve their doubts in a
way I cannot join (see "Fifth" below). Second, the level
of objectivity of the proposed course is at least as
troubling; the reading list is directed almost wholly to
your own views; your description of the course displays
it as polemical—a quality not generally objectionable in a
professor's communications, but inappropriate to his
classroom instruction.
It is fitting that, while setting forth my decision on
this matter, I explicitly respond to some of the main
issues in the report(s) from the Committee.
First, I agree that heterodoxy is a central academic
value and that positive steps to encourage it are impor
tant to the vitality and integrity of a university.
Second, I agree that the University is obliged to
protect its imprimatur; I observe that indeed the Univer
sity habitually conducts its affairs so that the consent of
deliberative authority (usually departmental authority)
is called for in processes of appointment, promotion,
curriculum setting, admission of students, awarding of

degrees, and other key functions.
Third, and perhaps most important, I observe that we
do not have at issue here the question of whether you
may offer a series of lectures, or organize a seminar in
research methods, open to graduate students-these
things you may do without special permission from
anyone. The practice is, and apparently "always" has
been, to schedule a room (as available) either for a single
occasion or for scheduled periodic meetings when such a
request comes to the room scheduling office from a
professor or his representative.
Fourth, the majority report makes considerable use
of the notion that a professor is entitled to critical
"feedback" and "objective examination" from graduate
students in the development of his intellectual under
taking. This principle is new to me and not immediately
compelling, but, without weighing its merit, 1 do believe
that it is inapplicable to your proposed course. Your
course is addressed to students presenting no prerequisi
tes; indeed, one of the parts of your course calls for
explaining the analysis of variance from the beginning.
An audience with this background cannot in one quarter
give any kind of valid or meaningful critical feedback to
a professor who has given protracted attention to a
highly technical subject.
Fifth, I am unable to join the majority in believing
"that a Stanford professor who has worked vigorously in
a field for a half-dozen or more years—even without
formal training in it-must be adjudged competent if he
declares himself to be so."
Finally, Professor Pittendrigh is right in calling for a
prompt review of the other Graduate Special courses.
Such a review will begin immediately.
