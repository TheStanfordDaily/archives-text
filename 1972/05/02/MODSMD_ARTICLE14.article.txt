The Dysgenic Question: New Research Methodology on
Human Behavior Genetics and Racial Differences
The focus of this course will be upon new quantita
tive methods for research in this field based largely on
published papers and unpublished manuscripts of lec
tures. These contributions, almost all by Professor
Shockley, are available for review. They are listed at the
end of the course material description so as to assist
further inquiries by interested readers of this document.
Key words and phrases relevant to the new methodology
that were introduced by Dr. Shockley and used below
are defined where they appear or in the references. They
include "environment-heredity uncertainty" (a phrase
used for comparison with basic uncertainty principles in
physics), "offset-analysis," "hybrid variance" (an old
concept but apparently not previously subjected to ana
lytic evaluation), "social capacity index," and "coopera
tive correlation." Some new pedagogical techniques have
also beeji devised, specifically the "coin-tossing" method
of bringing analysis of variance to a level comprehensible
to the practical man-in-the-street.
The thesis of this course is that dysgenic trends will
impact on the future of humanity in a manner and to a
degree that cannot justifiably be casually dismissed, and
that scientific methods of attack on these matters
methods that are worthy of study on their own intellec
tual merits—exist and can be improved so as to diagnose
more definitively the severity of these impacts.
The content of the proposed course can be divided
into five general areas and will probably be covered
sequentially in the order presented below. The relevant
references arc listed following the five headings below.
1. The Geneticity of IQ
Intelligence, measured by IQ, varies more than twice
as much from genetic differences as from environmental
ones for individuals like those from families that raise
one of a pair of white identical twins. The basis for this
statement will be developed using the methodology of
analysis of variance to arrive, for example, at the conclu
sion that less than 20% of the IQ variance results from
nongenetic causes.
The word "geneticity" has been coined to apply to
the fraction of variance that is controlled by genes—
"heritability in the large."
Subsidiary issues will involve discussion of the results
of a poll of students and faculty in relevant disciplines to
show the lack of adequately based opinion on these
matters. Other relevant documentation is available and
will be introduced depending on the interests of the
students and the time available.
2. IQ, Its Behavior and Its Correlation with Other
Traits.
Correlations between the IQs of related and unrelated
individuals and with social class and with personality
traits will be analyzed. Specific reference to the Terman
study in the volume "The Gifted Group at Mid-Life"
will be made to support estimates of about 0.3 0.1 for
correlation coefficients of IQ with socially important
personality traits.

The fact that geneticity of IQ can be estimated with
out the use of identical twin data will be established.
3. The Determination of the Caucasian Fraction of the
Ancestry of American Negro Populations.
The application of the Hardy-Weinberg Law to esti
mate Caucasian ancestry from blood-type frequencies
will be discussed. The Shockley extension to estimate
the variance of M, the Caucasian fraction, will also be
presented.
4. Research and Research Suggestions on Methodology
to Reduce the Environment-Heredity Uncertainty Regar
ding Racial Differences.
Several Shockley concepts will be introduced and
utilized in the analysis of existing data. These will in
clude offset-analysis, social capacity index, racial hybrid
variance, and cooperative correlation. The basis for the
estimate that for low IQ American Negro populations,
each 1% of Caucasian ancestry raises average IQ by
about one IQ point will be presented. If time allows the
results published by others on the validity of standard
tests in predicting performance independent of race will
be covered.
The relevance of the estimates of racial hybrid vari
ance to research possibilities in predominantly black
colleges will be explained. Evidence for racial differences
in brain anatomy and in patterns of factors in intelli
gence test-instruments will be related to possible exten
sions of research methodology.
5. The Potential Dysgenic Impact and Its Focus on the
Black Minority.
The probability that a dysgenic threat does exist will
be presented in brief through the positions stated by
others. This will be related to the emphasis placed on the
American Negro problem. Specifically, the availability of
government statistics on Negro versus white populations
permits quantitative research without new field work.
Furthermore, the Caucasian-gene effects may permit the
direct determination of dysgenic tends in the Negro
population that would not now be possible for the white
population. Evidence that for the entire U.S. population
the dysgenic trends become apparent when white and
Negro populations are combined has been published
recently by R.T. Osborne who titled his article with the
phrase "Population Pollution" introduced in a lecture by
Shockley.
The moral obligations of intellectuals to apply their
intelligence to these problems will be discussed only
briefly so as to permit concentration upon the quantita
tive analytical methodology that constitutes the primary
objective of the course. If interest develops in pursuing
these subjects more fully, out of class meetings, debates,
opinion polls or other explorations will be considered.
References for More Detailed Descriptions of the Con
tents of the Subject Areas.
[Most of the references given below were included with
Professor Shockley's memorandum of 9 June 1971 in
response to Dean Moses' request.'ln reviewing the topiqs
that came to attention while considering in more detail

the areas of subject matter discussed above, certain addi
tional references seemed appropriate. One example was
apparently my only published reference to the result
that the performance of the children adopted by the
Terman Gifted Group was lower at a significance level of
about 0.025 than the natural offspring: 1-81 a letter to
the Stanford Daily. In this list of references, no attempt
has been made to make a complete list of items to which
the students' attention might be directed. The emphasis
has been upon contributions that are relevant to reason
ing and original contributions of W. Shockley, especially
as these may be in conflict with prevailing views, so that
the contribution of the proposed course to the creation
and dissemination of knowledge may be most effectively
reviewed. In general only a few words have been given to
define the content. All of the items are thought to be
available on short notice if requested.]
