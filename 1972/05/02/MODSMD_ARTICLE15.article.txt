# Faculty Guidelines for Evaluation of Graduate Special Courses
## 
### 
Attachment 2

Following are guidelines for the evalu
ation of graduate special courses, pre
pared by the Committee on Graduate
Studies and approved by the Senate
PART I
This memo deals with courses which
are offered as graduate specials but which
have not been endorsed for credit by a
school or department.
An instructor applying for approval of
a special course is expected to submit io
the Dean of Graduate Studies informa
tion in writing which follows in general
the format suggested in Part 111 of this
document. The Dean, when he feels this
to be necessary, should appoint an ad hoc
committee to assist him in the evaluation
Each such committee is to consist of
three to five members, one of whom is to
be selected from a field not touched upon
by the proposal. In selecting the commit
tee members, the chairmen of the depart
ments in fields related to the proposal
should be consulted. The ad hoc commit
tee reports to the Dean, who may request
the C.G.S. to review the case prior to
reaching a final decision.
The Dean and the ad hoc evaluating
committee should feel free to seek addi
tional testimony when this is needed to
clarify an issue. In making a decision, the
Dean must consider the net benefit to be
derived from the proposed course in
advancing the educational objectives of
the University. In the following section,
some guide lines are suggested to help in
the evaluation. Because of the difficulty
in setting explicit standards which are
operational, this first such exercise

should, after a test period, be reviewer
and amended by C.G.S.
PART II
The following should serve as criteria
for evaluating a proposal for a graduate
special.
1) Is the material to be dealt with of
sufficient intellectual merit? In order to
judge this question, the opinion of the
relevant department or departments, and
if necessary outside experts, should be
sought.
2) Is the course on the level of gradu
ate rather than undergraduate instruc
tion? Comparison with similar courses
already in the catalogue and a review of
the required prerequisites should help in
settling this question.
3) Is the instructor competent to
teach the proposed course? Again, depart
mental judgments, and judgments by out
side experts as well as a review of the
instructor's publications should support
any verdict on this matter.
4) Has it been shown that the pro
posed course cannot be accommodated
within an already existing departmental
or interdisciplinary program? A suffi
ciently detailed course-outline and con
sultations with chairmen of the relevant
departments or programs should settle
this 'ssue.
5) Has it been shown that the course
will meet an intellectual need of the Uni
versity community? It will be helpful if
the question of probable audience, stimu
lation for further work, etc., would be
considered in this context.
6) The proposed course should not

violate standards of professional ethics.,
e.g., activities that might injure human
health, invade privacy, impose mental or
physical pain on humans or needlessly on
other living beings, etc., would be ruled
out under this criterion.
7) The approval of the course should
take into account (though not necessarily
conform to) any objections or reserva
tions voiced by the department in which
the instructor has his principal appoint
ment.
8) Does the course have educational
value, and does it contribute to the
furthering of the intellectual development
of the university community? In order to
apply this criterion one should see how
the proposed course relates to other cur
rent objectives of the university, how it
will help, or not help, the development of
specialization or new interdisciplinary
programs, and how it might influence re
search in related fields. On these ques
tions the most weighty consideration
should be the views of the affected de
partments.
PART 111
3.1) Course outline in enough detail
and in plain, non-technical language so
that the main thrust of the course may be
understood by the non-expert.
3.2) Reading list for the course.
Copies of the most pertinent unpublished
documents may be requested for exami
nation.
3.3) Course structure to include
manner and methods of instruction, re
quirements, definition of papers and/or
other student projects, method of evalua

tion of student work and intended
grading system.
3.4) Statement by instructor to
demonstrate that the course cannot be
taught within an existing department or
program.
3.5) Statement by the instructor to
set forth his reasons why the course
should be a contribution to the advance
of knowledge and/or a contribution to
the education of graduate students at
Stanford.
3.6) Type and number of students
likely to take course in a given quarter.
Estimation of their interests, academic
backgrounds and prerequisites for their
admission to the course is necessary.
3.7) Documentation of the com
petence of the instructor to teach in the
proposed field, e.g., list of relevant publi
cations, related research and teaching ex
perience. etc. In case the instructor is not
already a member of the Stanford facul
ty, the same procedures used for instruc
tor certification in undergraduate specials
should be followed. A regular faculty
member must sponsor and oversee the
course in this case.
3.8) Instructor's list of names and
addresses of groups and/or individual ex
perts (inside and/or outside Stanford Uni
versity) who can be solicited for their
opinions, if required. It is understood
that the Dean and/or the ad hoc commit
tee may wish to obtain expert opinion
from people not on this list.
3.9) Statement from the instructor's
department chairman concerning the cur
rent and future departmental commit
ments of this proposer.
