# Majority Opinion List Shockley Course
## 
### 
Attachment 3

The task of evaluation has proved difficult for three
reasons.
First, the content of Professor Shockley's proposed
course covers methods and ideas in the fields of human
genetics and psychology that are highly controversial
within those disciplines themselves.
Second, this is the first attempt a committee has
made to use the new guidelines in evaluating a proposed
graduate special course. They have been helpful, but not
conclusive, in enabling us to reach a decision as to
whether Professor Shockley should be authorized to
offer the course. As the committee which prepared the
guidelines fully recognized, the actual application to a
concrete case might lead to a need for some revision in
order to make them more administerable.
Third, there are conflicting values involved in recom
mending that the course be or not be authorized; as is
likely to be the case with the conflicting values, they
have been weighted somewhat differently by the various
members of the committee The significance of these
difficulties will become clearer in our discussion of the
reasoning which has led to the majority opinion.
A. Recommendations
We recommend:
1. That you authorize Professor Shockley to give this
course as a Graduate Special Course, but that no units of
credit be assigned to it unless some degree-granting body
(department or interdepartmental program) within the
University notifies you that the course is acceptable in
meeting part of its degree requirements. (The decision
with respect to granting credit toward a graduate degree
is a judgment which no extra-departmental body, such as
our Ad Hoc Committee, is empowered to make.) Since
department faculties control the recommendations of
their own degree requirements, the issue of credit or not
credit is irrelevant from our point of view.
2. That your authorization be for a single one-aca
demic quarter presentation of the course.
3. That authorization be contingent on Professor
Shockley's willingness to allow a reasonable opportunity
for faculty members who dispute his theories to address
the class. (Professor Shockley has offered this provision
in his proposal for the course.)
B. Commentary a.
a. What is a Graduate Special Course?
The history of Graduate Specials which we have re
viewed leaves us unclear as to their purpose and precise
definition. We have adopted as a working principle the
proposition that either 1) a Special should be so interdis
ciplinary that no individual department could judge its
utility or provide for its staff, 2) that no individual
department would be willing to offer the substance of
the course, or 3) to sponsor the teaching in that area by
a particular professor.
The scientific content of Professor Shockley's course
does not appear to be so interdisciplinary that it could
not be presented within a single department by the
regular department. It falls well within the tradition of
human population genetics, and although it presupposes
competence not only in genetics but in statistics and the
use of various intelligence tests and an evaluation of
their results, these skills are possessed by human geneti
cists. Indeed, in the opinion of the Department of Gene
tics, adequate training is already given in this important
area of study, namely, the extent to which human traits,
including intelligence, are partially determined by bio
logical (DNA) heredity
It is well known, of course, that graduate courses
within a single department are often taught at a techni
cal level which precludes the participation of graduate
students from neighboring departments whose technical
skills are not equivalent to those of the home depart
ment. There would appear to be room for courses taught
at a somewhat simpler level in order to accommodate
graduate students in other schools or departments who
have not achieved the necessary technical competence
for a specialized graduate course within a department.
Viewed from this standpoint, therefore, we wondered
whether one of the regular departments concerned with
this area of research could not sponsor Professor Shock
ley's course. There appeared to be three possible depart
ments in which such a course might be presented; either
individually or by cross-listing: Genetics, Psychology and
Biology. Accordingly, we submitted Professor Shock
ley's course proposal to all three Departments with two
questions:
First, will you accept this course and list it as part of
the Department's offerings in the Graduate Division? All
three Departments answered in the negative.
Second, were Professor Shockley's course designated
as a Graduate Studies Special with, let us say, 3 units,
would you accept those units as credit for part of the
requirements that you demand in your graduate pro
gram? Again the departments answered negatively; the
Psychology Department pointed out that this was a
hypothetical question since all such decisions are made
by the faculty on the proposal of a student and his
adviser.
Since none of the other departments would agree to
sponsor the course proposed by Professor Shockley, our
understanding of the purpose of such courses suggested
that there was appropriate reason for considering the
course a legitimate candidate for the status of Graduate
Special Course.
b. Assumptions
We have tried to be explicit in our own minds about
certain assumptions we were making as we evaluated the
proposed course. Those which we could identify were as
follows:
1. The University has an obligation to protect the
expression of heterodox views on scholarly matters. For
the faculty this includes expression on the lecture room
platform as well as from the floor at scientific meetings
or on White Plaza.
While the University is a custodian of intellectual
rigor in the established disciplines, it is also responsible
(more than any other institution of society) for encour
aging the exploration of new avenues of thought and
thoroughly questioning the old. It must continually
question orthodoxy and avoid the inhibition of innova
tion which a too-strict adherence to departmental auth
ority sometimes engenders.
In short, the University has an obligation to encour
age, not merely condone, the expression of heterodox,
"dangerous," thoughts; it must offer sanctuary to all its
members who challenge, by any means short of physical
violence and its incitement, or by interference with the
same expressive rights of others, the most sacrosanct
elements of contemporary thought and belief.
