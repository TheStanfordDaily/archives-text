its catalog, it says in effect that the substantive matter of
the course is of serious import, that it will be presented
with scholarly objectivity, that the expression of com
peting views by members of the class will be accepted
and respected, and that the instructor presenting the
course has the necessary competence to insure its schol
arly value. Graduate special courses are not different
from any other university course offerings in this re
spect.
c. The Guidelines
With the above assumptions in mind, and with the
apparent purposes of graduate special courses before us,
we have attempted to use the guidelines to evaluate the
course. As will become apparent, some of them can be
used before a course is ever given, but some are difficult

to use without having an assessment of a professor's
actual performance In what follows, we will list the
guidelines one by one and comment on Professor Shock
ley's proposal as it relates to them.
1. Is the material to he dealt with of sufficient intel
lectual merit?
The subject matter of Professor Shockley's proposed
course is at the heart of a major area of interest and
study in the Held of human population genetics. Wheth
er the details of Professor Shockley's method and theory
are of the same quality as the problems he is attacking is
a question which cannot be answered at present.
It is precisely at this point that the question of
heterodoxy-orthodoxy enters, for it is clear that his
position differs sharply from the positions of leading
geneticists. To reject his proposal on the grounds that it
has not received acceptance by other scholars would not
be in accord with our assumption that it is necessary for
a university to protect heterodoxy and permit its faculty
to present formally unorthodox and even unwelcome
views.
2. Is the course on the level of graduate rather than
undergraduate instruction ?
The requirement of a reasonable sophistication in
statistical methods is approximately equivalent to the
requirements for graduate students in the behavioral
sciences. We have already callcd attention to the fact
that there seems to be a place for graduate special
courses that can be taken with profit by graduate stu
dents whose specialty lies outside the specific area of the
t,,.» .» « • ' 1. :

their own fields and quite able to take advantage ot high
level teaching. We have no reason to judge that Professor
Shockley's proposed course is at an inappropriate level.
3. Is the instructor competent to teach the proposed
course?
This is a difficult question to answer with a categori
cal assertion. In scholarly circles it is customary to
consider formal training in a field as a necessary though
not sufficient evidence of competence. So far as the
mathematical aspects of Professor Shockley's method
and theory are concerned, there can be no question as to
his competence.
With respect to the field of population genetics, how
ever, there is no indication that Professor Shockley has
had formal training in the subject. While he has pub
lished on the subject matter of the course, his publica
tions have not been in the customary refereed journals
edited by specialists in the field.
There is no evidence, either, that he has had formal
training or practical experience in the giving and inter
preting of intelligence tests. Since these instruments pro
vide the measure which constitutes the sole dependent
variable in his theory, his apparent lack of experience
with the relevant methods does inevitably raise the ques
tion of his competence to teach about such matters.
On the other hand, while formal training in a field is
one way of securing the necessary scholarly knowledge
of that field, it is not the only one. Furthermore, at the
fringes of innovation in a field-where creative imagina
tion is most needed-formal training in a discipline tends
to pass on the prevailing orthodoxy of "best guesses"
and "points of view."
Somewhat the same principle applies to evaluation of
papers prepared for refereed journals, although we are
indeed doubtful that a soundly conceived theory with
acceptable methodology would be refused publication in
any scientific journal. In any case we are disposed to
believe that a Stanford professor who has worked vigor
ously in a field for a half dozen or more years—even
without formal training in it-must be adjudged compe
tent if he declares himself to be so.
Any professor who wishes to explore an area new to
him and heterodox to the community of scholars should
have the privilege of presenting his views to graduate
students and to receive the feedback from their examina
tion and criticism of his views.
It is difficult to believe that, in this day and age ot
empirical science, Stanford graduate students could be
significantly poisoned by error on the part of a professor
in presenting a course. Since no credit would be granted
for this course unless requested by an appropriate de
partment, worth of the Univeristy's imprimatur is not
threatened by the presentation of the course.
4. Has it been shown that the proposed course can
not be accommodated within an already existing
departmental or interdisciplinary program?
Yes.
5. Has it been shown that the course will meet an
intellectual need of the University community?
This question is difficult to answer for any course in
advance of its presentation. Intellectual needs are often'
stimulated by the offerings of substance. We judge that
it is rarely the case that innovative methods and theories,
particularly the latter, represent a felt intellectual need
on the part of the University community.
On the contrary, innovative ideas are more often met
with rejection and skepticism. Professor Shockley's pre
sentations of his views on human genetics have met with
vigorous dissent within the profession. They have charac
teristically been presented in single speeches or polemi
cal articles, however, and the University community has
not yet been challenged at the productive graduate stu
dent level by a consecutive course which presents Profes
sor Shockley's controversial views.
One of the major reasons for our recommending that
the course be presented on a single occasion is that we
believe such a presentation would give more satisfactory
opportunity to evaluate it in terms of this guideline.
6. The proposed course should not violate standards
of professional ethics, e.g., activities that might
injure human health, invade privacy, impose men
tal or physical pain on humans or needlessly on
other living beings, etc., would be ruled out under
this criterion .
The major element in this guideline which seems
relevant is the giving of "mental pain." Professor Shock
ley's theory and method of analyzing genetic data have
led him to certain conclusions concerning the distribu
tion of intellectual ability in racial gene pools. These
conclusions are highly controversial and cannot be consi
dered as established beyond peradventure of doubt. In
some of his writing and public speaking nevertheless,
Professor Shockley has treated his conclusions as if they
were solid enough to warrant their acceptance for pur
poses of making public policy. The essentially genocidal
policies he has seemed to propose are not only painful
for black people to hear but are abhorrent to all decent
people whatever their skin color. We believe it is high
time that the alleged conclusions were subjected to open
and objective examination before a graduate level class.
We do not consider the possible occurrence of "mental
pain" a sufficient reason for prohibiting the teaching of
method and theory.
We are sensible to the pain which may come from a
nonscholarly or even polemical and propagandists pre
sentation of such materials, however. To use a university
lecture platform or discussion sessions with students in a
class, as a setting in which to further a professor's own
social aims, is in our view unconscionable. This guideline
is difficult to use in advance of the presentation of a
course, for there is no way of knowing whether a profes
sor will follow these principles. In recommending that
the course be authorized for one presentation only we
are making the assumption that it will be a scholarly and
objective presentation of scientific substance and will
not provide the occasion for derogatory polemics.
7. The approval of the course should take into ac
count, though not necessarily conform to, any
objections or reservations voiced by the depart
ment in which the instructor has his principal
appointment.
It is our understanding that the Dean of the School of
Engineering has made no objection to Professor Shock
ley's offering such a graduate special course.
S. Does the course have educational value, and does
it contribute to the furthering of the intellectual
development of the University community?
Again it is difficult to evaluate the proposed course

way in which it would interfere with other activities of
the departments most closely related to the subject
matter (Genetics, Psychology, Biology). Whether the
course would help in the development of a new ap
proach to scientific problems of human population gene
tics cannot be forecast.
C. A final word
As individuals we are fully aware of the controversial
character of Professor Shocklcy's politicization of what
he calls "The Dysgenic Question " None of us is willing
to accept his political views or his social philosophy.
We have tried to judge the proposed course on its
merits as a scholarly enterprise. If it is presented, it must
be done so with the objectivity and intellectual balance
between opposing views that are customary in the scien
tific and University community. It is normally expected
that graduate courses will provide students a reasonable
opportunity to discuss the contents of the course and to
rebut arguments they consider false, to present suppor
ting or opposing data, to enter fully into an intellectual
partnership with the professor, and in case of disagree
ment, to be treated with the courtesy and respect due to
fellow scholars.
If the course can be presented in this manner, we
believe that Professor Shockley deserves a hearing by
graduate students if they are disposed to give it. We
believe it is the Dean's obligation to give Professor
Shockley a full understanding of our expectations in this
matter.
