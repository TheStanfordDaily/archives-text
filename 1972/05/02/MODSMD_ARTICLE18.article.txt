# Letter of Transmittal to Dean Moses

### 
Following is an April 18, 1972, letter to Graduate
Dean Lincoln E. Moses from Colin S. Pittendrigh, holder
of the Bing professorship of human biology.
This note and its five attachments respond to your
charge that we review Professor Shockley's request to
give a Graduate School Special Course (for credit) en
titled "The Dysgenic Question: New Research Methodol
ogy on Human Behavior Genetics and Racial Differ
ence." His written proposal and the Committee on Grad
uate Studies' Guidelines which you provided us are ap
pended as Attachments 1 and 2, respectively.
We all regret that it has taken so many weeks to
respond to your charge which we received on Feb. 3.
But the fact is that the decision you have to make and
on which you seek our advice is profoundly difficult.
Many diverse considerations are involved, going well
beyond the specifics of the CGS Guidelines. Some of
them only became clear to us as we grappled with our
charge. In a sense the whole nature of the University and
the diversity of its obligations bear on the decision, and
while we were surely not commissioned to review these
grand issues, we could not ignore them.
At the center of much of our discussion was the
question: how on the one hand can the institution
protect and encourage heterodoxy and the exploration
of the new; and on the other maintain high standards of
competence in its formal instruction?
With these additional obligations, self-imposed, we
have had to reach some decision with respect to Profes
sor Shockley's proposal as judged in the light of the
guidelines provided: that was our charge.
We have not reached a consensus. Attachment 3 is a
majority report from Professors Efron, Maccoby and
Sears who recommend you authorize the course for
inclusion in the Catalog, but without assigning credit to
it and with the further reservation that authorization be
for one quarter only, after which some reevaluation
should be undertaken. Attachment 4 is a minority report
from Professor Krahl who recommends the course not
be authorized. Attachment 5 is a minority report from
myself with a similar recommendation and some added
observations on what such a recommendation entails.
The committee has met formally seven times, and
subgroups have met on many other occasions in addition
to holding extended telephone discussion. Two of us
(Efron and Pittendrigh) have had several conversations
with Professor Shockley himself. We have, severally,
consulted with many scholars with competence in the
areas involved, both within and outside Stanford. We
have received letters and visits from students and others
interested in the matter.
We have consulted with the chairmen of the Depart
ments of Genetics, Psychology and Biology. We asked
those chairmen: Would their department be willing to
include the proposed course in its formal curriculum
leading to an advanced degree in their discipline? All
answered negatively. The Department of Genetics added
the observation that the material to be covered was
already provided for in its existing offerings.
It is a happy fact that we are in much more agree
ment on several points than the multiplicity of our
separate reports might suggest. We are in total agreement
on the major issue of the University's obligation not to
suppress heterodoxy, and we have not hesitated to use
an identical wording in stating that pivotal point in two
of the reports you receive.
We are in complete agreement, too, in believing that
the question I raised earlier (how to encourage hetero
doxy and yet maintain high standards of competence in
formal instruction) deserves far more study than we
could give it. I believe its prompt attention is an urgent,
major item of business for the University community at
large.

question: how on the one hand can the institution
protect and encourage heterodoxy and the exploration
of the new; and on the other maintain high standards of
competence in its formal instruction?
With these additional obligations, self-imposed, we
have had to reach some decision with respect to Profes
sor Shockley's proposal as judged in the light of the
guidelines provided: that was our charge.
We have not reached a consensus. Attachment 3 is a
majority report from Professors Efron, Maccoby and
Sears who recommend you authorize the course for
inclusion in the Catalog, but without assigning credit to
it and with the further reservation that authorization be
for one quarter only, after which some reevaluation
should be undertaken. Attachment 4 is a minority report
from Professor Krahl who recommends the course not
be authorized. Attachment 5 is a minority report from
myself with a similar recommendation and some added
observations on what such a recommendation entails.
The committee has met formally seven times, and
subgroups have met on many other occasions in addition
to holding extended telephone discussion. Two of us
(Efron and Pittendrigh) have had several conversations
with Professor Shockley himself. We have, severally,
consulted with many scholars with competence in the
areas involved, both within and outside Stanford. We
have received letters and visits from students and others
interested in the matter.
We have consulted with the chairmen of the Depart
ments of Genetics, Psychology and Biology. We asked
those chairmen: Would their department be willing to
include the proposed course in its formal curriculum
leading to an advanced degree in their discipline? All
answered negatively. The Department of Genetics added
the observation that the material to be covered was
already provided for in its existing offerings.
It is a happy fact that we are in much more agree
ment on several points than the multiplicity of our
separate reports might suggest. We are in total agreement
on the major issue of the University's obligation not to
suppress heterodoxy, and we have not hesitated to use
an identical wording in stating that pivotal point in two
of the reports you receive.
We are in complete agreement, too, in believing that
the question I raised earlier (how to encourage hetero
doxy and yet maintain high standards of competence in
formal instruction) deserves far more study than we
could give it. I believe its prompt attention is an urgent,
major item of business for the University community at
large.
Following is an April 18, 1972, letter to Graduate
Dean Lincoln E. Moses from Colin S. Pittendrigh, holder
of the Bing professorship of human biology.
This note and its five attachments respond to your
charge that we review Professor Shockley's request to
give a Graduate School Special Course (for credit) en
titled "The Dysgenic Question: New Research Methodol
ogy on Human Behavior Genetics and Racial Differ
ence." His written proposal and the Committee on Grad
uate Studies' Guidelines which you provided us are ap
pended as Attachments 1 and 2, respectively.
We all regret that it has taken so many weeks to
respond to your charge which we received on Feb. 3.
But the fact is that the decision you have to make and
on which you seek our advice is profoundly difficult.
Many diverse considerations are involved, going well
beyond the specifics of the CGS Guidelines. Some of
them only became clear to us as we grappled with our
charge. In a sense the whole nature of the University and
the diversity of its obligations bear on the decision, and
while we were surely not commissioned to review these
grand issues, we could not ignore them.
