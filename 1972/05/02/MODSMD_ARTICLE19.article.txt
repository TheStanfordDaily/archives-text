Following is an April IS letter 112 rom Prof. M. t\ Krahl
to Graduate Dean Lincoln Moses.
I concur in the recommendation by Professor C.S.
Pittendrigh that the proposed course not be authorized.
1 also concur with Dr. Pittendrigh's views on the
extent and limitations of academic freedom as stated in
Sec. B of his minority report to you.
On the basis of my limited experience in these mat
ters, 1 would prefer to decide this case on a simpler
administrative level. See my accompanying letter to you,
dated 4/18/72.
(Following is the text of that letter)
At your request dated Feb. 3, 1972,1 have served as a
member of a committee to give you advice regarding
sponsorship of this course by the Office of Graduate
Studies.
My recommendation is that approval for this course
not be granted by your office.
My reasons for this recommendation are outlined
below.
During the 28 years of my academic experience, 1
have taught only in medical schools to medical students,
graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows. At present,
in Stanford Medical School, I am responsible for assign
ing instructors for 230 contact hours per year of teach
ing for medical students, and approximately 50 hours of
other graduate teaching. Two qualities that 1 value high
est in selecting instructors are expertise in the area
taught, and objectivity of presentation.
1. Expertise.
Under the rules of the Provost's Office*, we can hire
as senior faculty members only those individuals who
are the best in the field in which they are to teach.
Their expertise is judged by:
a. A period of training and seasoning in outstanding
academic departments dealing with that specialty,
with recommendations from former colleagues or
experts in these areas of research.
b. A substantial record of publication in national or
international journals where the papers are refer
eed by experts.
c. Certification that the individual is of high compe
tence in his proposed teaching field by the Stan
ford Department(s) responsible for that area(s) of
instruction.
From the materials submitted to our committee, 1 am
not persuaded that William Shockley, Ph.D., meets the
above criteria under which I am constrained by the
Attachment 5

University to operate in my day-to-day teaching and
administrative decisions.
2. Objectivity.
To my mind, the essence of graduate study is to
develop objectivity in interpretation of of research
findings. We all have constantly before us the unfor
tunate example of "Lysenkoism," which sought to
impose an unproven point of view on plant genetics.
The question of objectivity arises with respect to the
proposed course for the following reasons.
a. The bibliography is very limited and heavily weigh
ted toward only one side of a complex argument.
b. In his prospectus for the course, (see version dated
August 9, 1971, p. 3), the instructor has expressed
a bias toward a single point of view, with respect
to the subject of the course.
c. The proposed subject matter for the course has the
potential for engendering strong emotional reac
tions in both students and the general public, so
that the course most likely will be conducted in a
highly political atmosphere.
For these reasons, 1 am not convinced that the pro
posed course will contribute significantly to the develop
ment of individual graduate students as outstanding
scholars. It is difficult for me to see how this course, as
now planned, can develop ability in the graduate student
to learn valuable research techniques and to evaluate
research findings in an objective and dispassionate man
ner.
