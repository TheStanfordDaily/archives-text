# Anderson, New York 'Times' Also Honored
## Stegner, Degler Win Pulitzers 
### PHIL REVZIN 
Retired Creative Writing Prof. Wal
lace E. Stegner and History Prof. Carl
N. Degler have been awarded Pulitzer
Prizes, it was announced yesterday in
York.
Other recipients include The New
York Times, for the newspaper's
publication of the "Pentagon Papers,"
and columnist Jack Anderson. Neil
Sheehan, the Times Reporter who
researched and wrote most of the
"Pentagon Papers" stories, was not
cited.
Anderson won the Nation Report
ing award for his disclosures about the
government's decision-making process
during the India-Pakistan war. Both of
these awards apparently aroused much
controversy among the Columbia Uni
versity trustees, who administer them.
Barbara W. Tuchman won her
second Pulitzer for Stilwell and the
American Experience in China in the
general non-fiction category. Tuchman

did much of the research for her book
at the Hoover Institution, which
houses the papers of Gen. Joseph
Stilwell and Flying Tiger leader Claire
Chennault. The book concerns the
roots of United States involvement in
the Far East.
The award for commentary went to
Chicago Daily News columnist Mike
Royko.
Each award carries a $1000 prize.
'Angle of Repose'
Stegner won the award for Litera
ture for Angle of Repose, an
historical novel tracing four genera
tions of a California family. It was his
first Pulitzer Prize.
Degler won the award in History
for Neither Black Nor White, a
comparison of racial conditions in the
United States and Brazil.
They are the twelfth and thirteenth
Stanford recipients of the award.
Stegner told the Daily yesterday
that he was "pleased, and hoped the
book deserved it." He added that "my

publisher told me this one would win
the Pulitzer Prize when I submitted
the manuscript, but I didn't really
believe him."
Too Long'
Stegner, 63, was Jackson Eli Rey
nolds Professor of Humanities until
January, when he retired to devote full
time to writing a novel and a
biography of the late columnist
Bernard DeVoto. Stegner taught at
Stanford since 1945, and was director
of the Creative Writing Center since
1947. "I taught for a total of 42 years,
and that's at least two years too long.
After 49. years you're not doing much
of a job anymore," he said.
Degler, who is 51, told the Daily
that he was surprised by the award
because his book had not been widely
reviewed. However, he had already
won two prizes for the book this
year—the $5000 Albert J. Beveridge
award from the American Historical
Society and the $4000 Columbia
University Bancroft Prize.

Degler's book concerns the dif
ference between Brazilian society,
where mulattoes are not considered
blacks, and our society, where anyone
with any black blood is considered to
be a black. Degler said one manifesta
tion of this difference is that black
leaders here, such as Roy Wilkins,
would not be considered black in
Brazil, and therefore might not be as
actively concerned for black equality.
Class Distinctions
He added that he felt on the basis
of his research that racial problems in
the future will probably be based more
on class distinctions than along purely
racial lines.
Degler has written three other
books: Out Of Our Past, The Age of
the Economic Revolution, and Aflu
ence and Society. He is currently
completing a book on the American
South, and plans to write a book on
women in society next fall.
He told a telephone caller soon
after he had heard about the award,
"It's insane, but that's the fact."
Degler taught at Vassar for 12 years
before coming to Stanford in 1968.
This quarter he is teaching two courses
on the history of the South.
Other Works
Stegner's other novels include: A
Shooting Star, All the Little Live
Things, Remembering Laughter, The
Big Rock Candy Mountain, Beyond
the Hundredth Meridian and others.
"I thought Beyond the Hundredth
Meridian had a chance for the Pulitzer
back in 1954," Stegner said, but that
book did not win the award.
Stegner is one of four Stanford
professors with a National Endowment
for the Arts Fellowship, which will
enable him to complete work on the
biography of DeVoto, who at one time
wrote a column for "Harper's" maga
zine, and is an ardent conservationist,
as is Stegner.
After receiving his Ph.D. from the
University of lowa, Stegner has lived
most of his life in the West.
President Richard Lyman told the
Daily yesterday that "the awards are a
tremendous tribute to both men. The
only thing I can say is that they came
as no surprise to me."
