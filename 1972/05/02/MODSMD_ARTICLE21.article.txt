# Minority Opinion of Pittendrigh— Proposal Fails to Meet Graduate Criteria
## 
### 
I am unable to accept the conclusions of the majority
in several respects which 1 state in Section D. 1 recom
mend that the proposed course not only not be author
ized but not included in the Stanford Catalog; but my
position involves more than that simply-stated judgment
which I have reached adopting the CGS Guidelines
which you provided as the only basis for evaluation.
In what follows the merits of the proposed are ini
tially discussed strictly in terms of the Guidelines; in
subsequent sections I turn to other considerations that
qualify my judgment and raise issues which, in my
opinion, far transcend-in their importance-the disposi
tion of this particular case. (Italics are the author's)
A. The Proposal Evaluated in
Terms of the CGS Guidelines
The considerations outlined in Part I of the Guide
lines have already been addressed in my letter covering
both the majority and the minority reports. Parts II and
111 are intimately related, and while I will consider
everything they contain, the following paragraphs are
structured to minimize unnecessary repetition. Numerals
given in parentheses (e.g. 2.1, 3.3, etc.) designate the
Guidelines sections pertinent to what is being said.
a. Is the material of sufficient intellectual merit? Both
human genetics and the future well-being of man are
indisputably of sufficient intellectual merit to justify
treatment in the Graduate School with appropriate rigor.
b. Is the course on the level of graduate rather than
undergraduate instruction? (2.2). Here one is to consider
the course outline (3.1), the reading list (3.2), the course
structure (3.3). the academic background of the students
envisaged, and the prerequisites for admission to the
course (3.6).
The course outline is sufficiently explicit but leaves
one uncertain as to its real purpose. Thus on the one

hand it states, "The focus of this course will be upon
new quantitative methods. . . etc. We are told Profes
sor Shockley will employ "some new pedagogical tech
niques. . . specifically "the 'coin-tossing' method of
bringing analysis of variance to a level comprehensible to
the practical man-in-the-street." The subsequent para
graph promptly states "the thesis of this course is that
dysgenic trends will impact on the future of humanity in
a manner and to a degree that cannot justifiably be
casually dismissed. . . etc.
On the one hand we are left with the impression that
in its methodological instruction it will be at a level
appropriate to a university extension course directed at
an untrained audience. This conclusion is consonant
with the fact that no prerequisites in the way of prior
training in either statistics, genetics or psychology are
demanded.
On the other hand one is led to understand that the
scope of the course extends to cover the grand questions
of the "future of humanity" and our "moral obliga
tions" to study the role played by the evolution of the
human gene pool in that future. The issues here are so
immense, so diverse and so debatable that they cannot
be treated at the graduate level in one quarter by any
single scholar, no matter how well prepared he may be.
The list of readings (2.3) appended to the proposal
consists almost entirely of pieces written by Professor
Shockley himself, only two of which appear to have
been published and none in refereed journals of the first
rank.
The only items not by himself are the now famous
paper of A. E. Jensen and one by R. T. Osborne entitled
"Population Pollution." Both men share Professor
Shockley's strongly contested views on the extent to
which racial differences in 1Q performance tests are
genetically determined. Professor Shockley's own state
ment of the course leaves no doubt that whatever its
stated focus or thesis will be, the central theme will be
his assertion that the "black minority" suffers from an
innate disability with respect to intelligence.
The readings he lists contain nothing from the now
substantial body of published criticism to which his
views have been subjected. Further, he frankly states
that (presumably only), "If time allows the results pub
lished by others on the validity of standard tests in
predicting performance independent of race will be cov
ered." The readings and the conditional nature of the
treatment of others' work are clearly incompatible with
any reasonable criterion of adequacy in graduate educa
tion.
Thus I can find no basis-in how he will handle its
stated focus, in its stated thesis, in its clear theme, or in
its failure to expose students to other viewpoints to
conclude the course is appropriate for inclusion in the
formal instructional program of the Stanford Graduate
School.
c. Is the instructor competent to teach the proposed
course? In addressing this question I have adopted the
premise that when an individual faculty member re
quests authorization to give formal instruction, the bur
den is on him to demonstrate his competence; the bur
den cannot be on a reviewing committee to make a
positive demonstration of incompetence.
I find that Professor Shockley has not sufficiently
demonstrated his competence to give formal instruction
in the many areas he intends to cover other than statis
tics.
In arriving at this conclusion I have consulted with
the appropriate department chairmen, with faculty col
leagues in the areas involved, including social sciences,
and with other scientists of international repute in both
human genetics and the analysis of human intelligence.
In reaching my opinion 1 have been influenced by the
following: I) to my knowledge no geneticist of stature
indeed none that I know of-regards Professor Shockley
as adequately familiar with the complexities of the gene
tic problems to which he addresses himself; 2) the most
relevant departmental chairmen are all (genetics, psych
ology, biology) unwilling to include the proposed offer
ing among those courses which they offer as their curric
ulum leading to an advanced degree; 3) Professor Shock
ley's views have been subject to stringent criticism by
scientists of unquestioned competence and integrity, but
he has not, in my judgment, responded adequately to
that criticism; 4) while he has published several categori
cal and polemical assertions in the news media, he has
yet to publish any scholarly work in a leading, refereed
professional journal.
One should also note in considering the competence
issue that the stated thesis of the course necessarily
involves the entire spectrum of the social sciences for
which he provides even less evidence of adequate prepa
ration than he does in the more circumscribed areas of
population genetics and the interpretation of IQ data.
While it is relevant, I have not taken as crucial the
fact that Professor Shockley lacks any formal training in
either genetics, the evaluation of the psychological tests
he uses as raw data, or the social sciences. Neither do I
assume-as does the majority—that simply by virtue of
being a Stanford professor who has devoted himself to
the problems for several years, he has thereby assuredly
overcome that handicap.
Given Professor Shockley's many public assertions
about the "moral obligation'' of intellectuals to study
the problems which currently preoccupy him, and his
public assertions that the National Academy of Sciences
is derelict in not adopting his proposals, it is appropriate
here to make a few observations about the long tradition
in human genetics.
Any impression that Professor Shockley may, even
inadvertently, convey to the effect that he is a pioneer in
the field or that his critics seek to suppress his inquiries
and make a "taboo" of the area is wholly false.
The study of human genetics—including the heritabil
ity of intelligence-has a long tradition that goes back, in
its modem form, to Galton and Pearson in the middle
19th century. It attracted the greatest of statisticians
and geneticists (like Fisher and Haldane) in the early
part of this century, and today preoccupies perhaps
dozens of well-trained scientists, including some at Stan
ford other than Professor Shockley.
The tradition has always faced the obvious question
of the practical utility of its findings: "eugenics" is an
old subject indeed. The tradition has never denied that
the structure of society may well have an impact on the
human gene pool. But at its best, it has always been
humbled, in its competence, by the enormity, the near
intractibility of the issues involved in the practical appli
cation of the limited insights.
The problems are profound not only in their techni
cally genetic aspects but even more profound in their
ethical or normative aspect. Elementary texts are replete
with discussions of the hazards, technical and ethical,
attending any eugenic program.
But Professor Shockley leaves us with the impression
that the tradition has never existed and that the prob
lems he now addresses are not only new but amenable to
instruction by a single person of untested competence to
an unprepared audience at the graduate level. 1 am
confident they are not.
d. Has it been shown that the proposed course cannot
be accommodated within an already existing departmen
tal or interdisciplinary program? (2.4). This question is
in one sense equivocal. Thus in one sense it has not been
shown that, were it adequate, it could not be accommo
dated in the graduate programs of either Genetics, Biol
ogy or Psychology. But on the other hand, it has been
shown it cannot be so accommodated because they will
not accept it. We know of no interdisciplinary program
in the Graduate School to which the course could be
referred for accommodation.
e. Has it been shown that the course will meet an
intellectual need in the University community? (2.5).
Does the course have educational value and does it
contribute to the furthering of the intellectual develop
ment of the University community? (2.8). Here we are
instructed to consider the following: the instructor's
stated position relative to those questions (3.5) as well as
the anticipated student clientele (including their back
ground and required preparation) (3.6); but that "the
most weighty consideration should be the views of the
affected departments" (2.8).
The question of need appears simple: since the chair
man of the Department of Genetics states his depart
ment (one of the most distinguished in the world) al
ready covers the genetic issues adequately, no imminent
need is demonstrable.
However, that does not do full justice to the p-.oposal
insofar as Professor Shockley evidently intends to devote
his time exclusively to his own personal conclusions
about: 1) the relative contributions of genetic and envi
ronmental components in the determination of "intelli
gence"; 2) the reality and nature of racial differences in
the genetic component; and 3) the "moral obligation" to
do something about his generally unaccepted con
clusions.
In this latter item he clcarly intends to address major
normative issues and hence the whole domain to which
the social sciences are relevant. While he is, and should
be, free to state his personal views openly on campus, I
do not find there is any demonstrable need for the
University to provide formal instruction on them.
There remains, in this section, the question of heuris
tic function: will the course contribute to the furthering
of the intellectual development of the community? One
can never say, perhaps, that any course will fail to have
some heuristic function. But what stimulation is likely
to emerge from Professor Shockley's conclusions is sure
ly already achieved by the widespread publicity both on
and off campus which he continues to attract.

And given the remarkable nature of the course-the
combination it offers of methodologies understandable
to the "practical man-in-the-street" and the global issues
of the future of humanity-it is unlikely either to attract
or prepare able students to carry forward the serious
study of the profound issues involved.
In summary, with respect to the several criteria set
out as A.e., I am unable to support the proposal.
112. The proposed course should not violate standards of
professional ethics. . . (2.6). This is clearly the most
difficult of the Guidelines to administer. The profession
al ethics of an intellectual are not easily defined, but any
attempt to formulate them would surely begin with
some statement concerning objectivity and provision for
control of the prejudice to which all of us are prone.
This is clear; but how is one to judge another man's
objectivity and control of prejudice? Obviously we all do
make such judgments, but they themselves can be held
to be contingent on the judger's own prejudice.
I find this aspect of the Guidelines so nearly unad
ministerable in any responsible way that 1 have set aside
all my own strong opinions about the objectivity and
lack of prejudice in the present proposal as inadmissible
evidence in reaching a conclusion about its authoriza
tion.
Of one thing I am sure, Professor Shockley lacks
neither sincerity nor conviction in his perception of the
questions he asks and the answers he finds.
g. The proposed course should not impose mental pain
on humans (2.6). This injunction will be no less difficult
to administer in very many cases to which the Guidelines
will have to be applied, especially in the future. Who has
not experienced some degree of mental pain in being
educated and coming to know himself better? I assume
the intent of the Guideline is to prohibit blatantly and
unnecessarily inflicted pain, and in this respect I find the
proposal before us open to criticism.
It so happens that, like all the other biologists I
know, I do not believe the available data justify any
unequivocal conclusion concerning possible differences
between Caucasian and African populations in the heri
tability of intellgence: nor do I, or they, deny it may
exist.
Let us, therefore, assume for the moment that Profes
sor Shockley is correct; he is certainly entitled to an
opinion on the matter and, further, to express it. But is
he thereby "entitled" by any reasonable canon of decen
cy to stoop to the expression "Population Pollution'''' in
discussing the admixture of Caucasian and African gene
pools? This phraseology is not only blatantly offensive,
but more importantly, unnecessary in the statement of
Professor Shockley's conclusions.
The clearly pejorative (to say the least) connotation
of "pollution" is such as to make his language an affront
to the dignity of millions of fellow men, and can only
add, needlessly, to the great burden of mental pain they
must already bear.
However, taste and respect for the dignity of one's
fellow men in the use of language are not among the
Guidelines; nor should they be because they are not
administerable criteria.
I remain uneasy about the relevant Guideline that
does exist because some degree of mental pain is—l
repeat—too often inescapable in any sincere intellectual
enterprise. And while one could argue that we are here
faced with the limiting case-and the qualification of
unnecessary pain, and gratuitous insult—l deliberately
exclude my clear personal distaste from the reasons
listed below as the basis for recommending against auth
orization.
h. Summary. My recommendation that the course not
be authorized as formal instruction in the Graduate
School, and not included in the University Catalog, is
based on my findings of inadequacy in sections A.a.,
A.b., A.c. and A.e. above. The other considerations are
either too trivial (A.d.) or too unadministerable (A.f,
A.g.) to be relevant.
B. Academic Freedom and the
Preservation of Heterodoxy
While the constraints of the CGS Guidelines leave me
no escape from the conclusion that the course should
not be authorized as formal instruction in the Stanford
Graduate School, I cannot leave the matter there with
out reference to the wide array of larger problems that
any decision in this matter brings into the sharpest
focus.
My initial concern, like that of all my other col
leagues on the Committee, was with what we loosely
called "academic freedom" and the right to freedom of
expression. It is surely unnecessary to elaborate the
theme that while the University is a custodian of intel
lectual rigor in the established disciplines, it is also
obligated (more than any other institution of society) to
encourage the exploration of new avenues of thought
and thoroughly question the old.
It must continually challenge "orthodoxy" and seek
to avoid that inhibition of innovation which a too-strict
adherence to departmental authority may, potentially,
engender.
In short, the University has an obligation to encour
age, more than merely condone, the expression of heter
odox, "dangerous," thoughts: it must offer sanctuary to
all its members who challenge, by any means short of
physical violence and its incitement, the most sacrosanct
elements of contemporary thought.
I have accordingly been very preoccupied with the
question of whether 1 was not-in my minority opinion
recommending what amounts to a serious constraint on
the right to freedom in the expression of ideas. I have
concluded I am not and wish to state why.
Academic freedom includes the right to freedom in
research and a right to express, publicly, views on any
subject. But it does not necessarily entail as inalienable,
the "right" to give formal instruction, with the institu
tion's sanction, in any subject.
Were that not the case, how could we protect the
University from dissipating its resources, losing its stat
ure and deceiving its students by allowing a humanist
with a lingering fondness for phlogiston to teach a
course in chemistry? Would the twin facts that he was a
Stanford professor and had spent seven years of sincere
effort attempting to understand oxidation-reduction
processes, of themselves, suffice to justify institutional
authorization of his course?

In fact, historical precedent has never established
such a right; to a greater or less extent each department
rigorously limits the scope of its subject to which an
individual faculty member is charged with teaching. In
deed, it has an obligation-in its teaching functions-to do
so.
Professor Shockley is a physicist of great distinction,
but the fact remains that "scientific competence" is still
not universally exchangeable currency in the total mar
ketplace of human ideas-not even within science itself.
Professor Shockley's freedom to do research in the
area he outlines is in no way limited by Stanford, as
Provost Miller has recently made very clear (Campus
Report, Vol. 21, March 1, 1972). His freedom to state
his views in the national and University news media and
on White Plaza is in no way constrained by Stanford.
And, further, I hope that, should he request facilities
to lecture on the issues that so concern him, he will be
given them. I elaborate on this point below. What / am
unwilling to recommend is that the University, as institu
tion, assume responsibility for the adequacy of his treat
ment of the subject, and it would do so were the
offering listed in its official catalog.
C Inadequacies in Our Present
Administrative Procedures Relative to
Interdisciplinary Instruction
We are still left with a major challenge: what institu
tional devices and what even-handed, administerable cri
teria can we develop that will permit the University to
meet its following obligations: 1) to encourage the new,
the heterodox-even the "dangerous"-the boldly inter
disciplinary undertakings that its faculty wishes to pur
sue; and 2) at the same time assure its students that what
it offers as formal, institutionally authorized instruction
is competently staffed and responsibly balanced in treat
ment, especially in areas in which human values are
involved and people of competence and good will disa
gree.
These are not incompatible goals in principle, but in
my opinion existing administrative procedures make
them nearly so. On the one hand, strict adherence to the
existing CGS Guidelines under which I and my col
leagues were charged to operate can only hinder pursuit
of the first goal unless other formal provisions are delib
erately made to accommodate heterodoxy and untested
novelty. If, on the other hand, in deference to the first
goal, the CGS Guidelines (or some version of them) are
not rigorously adhered to, our authorized formal instruc
tion can only decay in quality.
I can, however, envisage two provisions that would
make the goals compatible, each with their own readily
administered groundrules. In briefly outlining them here,
the intent is only to indicate the tractability of the
problem, not to press the merits of the particular propo
sals.
First, within the institution's program of formal in
struction all clearly interdisciplinary undertakings should
routinely bo multiply staffed by faculty from all the
contributing disciplines. Application of this groundrule
would not only have the positive value of ensuring some
attested competence in all that is involved, it would also
free a faculty panel—supposedly a peer group—from the
odious task of having to make judgments on the compe
tence and objectivity of a colleague seeking to explore
the new and the heterodox: in fact, almost by defini
tion, the sponsor of the novel and the heterodox has no
peer.
It would, I believe, be unwise to deny, inflexibly, any
individual faculty member the opportunity of formal
instruction in interdisciplinary matters, but he or she
would then have to face the rigors of the existing Guide
lines.
On the other hand, the provision of multiply manned
enterprises would bypass them. Were there an interdisci
plinary course or program at Stanford with some scope
such as "Human Genetics and the Future of Man,"
Professor Shockley should unquestionably be permitted
to contribute to it: the vexed questions of his compe
tence and objectivity would then be irrelevant because
debate and criticism would then ensure that the students
were exposed to all sides of the questions addressed.
We need engineers, lawyers, humanists, physicists and
many others to become involved in such massive topics
as the "future of man," but we cannot in such a program
expose students to them without the discipline of a
discourse that will reveal the many-sided nature of the
problem and the real state of our knowledge and ignor
ance.
That provision would, I think, be a major step but
still leave us without all the flexibility a university needs
today to respond adequately to the challenges and re
sponsibilities it faces: the provision would still impose
some brake on the individual with something he wishes
to say but cannot hold forth for lack of an appropriate
program.
I have, it so happens, believed for many years that
every University should contain within it something we
might call the "Free University" where anyone could
speak on anything that he or she chose to those who
wished to hear. Herbert Read is not alone in the senti
ment of his lines:
I would have my own vision
The world's vision;
The beauty settled in my mind
A lamp in a busy street.
We have, in my opinion, failed to evolve the institu
tional flexibility that the times have long since called
for-the flexibility necessary to discharge the dual obli
gations I have stated above without at the same time
failing in both. Thus we need to formalize the distinc
tion I see as critical between what the University author
izes as adequate, competent formal instruction, and
what it permits (even encourages) as untested, uncen
sored exploration of the debatable and controversial.
Here, in the "Free University" within the overall
structure of Stanford, the radical left, the radical right,
the great middle ground-and even our humanist with his
lingering love of phlogiston—could find, genuinely, a
freedom to discuss their own approaches to the stagger
ing scientific and normative issues that face us today.
I can see no harm, but great benefit, in making
regular provision for such a free forum. Offerings in the
Free University I envisage would require no institutional

sanction, but their volume would surely have to be
limited by the resources of space and maintenance it
would have to provide.
Some appropriate body would have to administer the
utilization of resources made available, including mini
mally adequate funds to advertise its offerings. But those
offerings, neither requiring nor enjoying institutional
imprimatur, would not carry credit toward a University
degree
On the other hand, they would enrich the total intel
lectual stimulation to which the students have access.
These comments are intended only to recognize that the
device of a Free University would have its own costs and
require adjustment in our other provisions; they are not
offered as carefully considered detail.
Without some form of the two proposals I have
sketched, 1 see the University faced with one or the
other of two equally bad prospects: I) of becoming in
its proper pursuit of rigor an "academy" (a home of
latter-day "schoolmen"), wholly unresponsive to the
pace of change; or 2) a sloppy intellectual cocktail party
where the rigor that is essential to any real intellectual
progress is sacrificed in compromise.
D. Comment on the Majority Position
In their report, the majority says, "we are making the
assumption that it will be a scholarly and objective
presentation of scientific substance." But it was not our
charge to assume that; we were charged with scrutinizing
the proposal, and the instructor's credentials, and then
to judge (not assume) whether it would be scholarly and
objective.
If the majority is willing to make the assumption (as
against the judgment), the rest of their discussion is
unnecessary. My own analysis of the proposal not only
left me unwilling to make that assumption; it left me
with the most serious doubts about those very qualities.
They recommend "authorization be for a single one
academic quarter presentation of the course"; and "that
authorization be contingent on Professor Shockley's wil
lingness to allow a reasonable opportunity for faculty
members who dispute his theories to address the class."
Again they say, "it is difficult to evaluate the pro
posed course until it has been given." These quotations
amount to a statement that the majority cannot reach a
judgment, given the available facts, and that some other
body must do it on evidence other than we have.
That may well be the case: indeed it is a position 1
have seriously considered myself. But what other body?
And on what evidence will it make its judgment? The
faculty deemed "competent" by all usual standards have
already stated their lack of support in the sense they are
unwilling to accept the course as adequate in their re
spective disciplines.
Does the majority imply that some other group of
"competent" men is, by the Committee's action, obliga
ted to attend all 28 of Professor Shockley's lectures as
academic referees? This strikes me as unrealistic: those
men have other things to do which I suspect they regard
as more constructive in the institution's total enterprise.
It is an obligation no Committee has authority to
impose on them. There is a profound difference between
the institution obligating other faculty members to join
with Professor Shockley to make his course adequately
balanced and Professor Shockley either himself persuad
ing them, or being asked by them to join in a common
enterprise. It is one of the latter possibilities I recognized
as one potential solution to our problems.
In my own position I have been at pains 1) to adhere
strictly to the Guidelines given; 2) to define problems
entailed by their adequate administration; and 3) to
outline possible solutions to those problems.
The proposal of the majority, in my opinion, ob
scures those problems or evades them. It exemplifies
precisely those concerns I expressed (in Section C, sec
ond paragraph) of my dissent. I do not think their
response involves an adequate adherence to the Guide
lines but that it is their concern with the goal of preser
ving heterodoxy (which I profoundly share) that has led
to the compromise position they adopt.
One other point of dissent is minor but should be
noted. I disagree with the conclusion there is "no reason
to judge Professor Shockley's proposed course is at an
inappropriate level." In its confusions of level of audi
ence, scope, lack of prerequisites and global ambitions, it
belongs on a public political platform, not in the class
room of a Graduate School. And the phrase on page 5
("innovative ideas") is too generous if not wholly mis
leading and unwarranted.
E. The Specific Case and the
General Issues
It would be disingenuous were one not to note,
indeed to stress, the two related facts 1) that Professor
Shockley's position has become a highly controversial
public issue, and 2) that his proposal has received far
more scrutiny and thought than any other "special"
with which the Committee is familiar.
My colleagues and I have grappled as objectively as
we could with an issue we all found to be unusually
difficult. Certainly I have encountered problems I did
not even recognize at the outset, and in the process of
reaching my own conclusion on the shortcomings of the
specific case we were charged to evaluate, I have become
more concerned with the general issues attending in
struction that is either interdisciplinary or heterodox
than with the specific case itself. I have been unhappy
with the limited range of options open to us in advising
you on the best way to provide for Professor Shockley's
concern to enter into the discourse of the University.
My firm conclusion that the course should not be
authorized as part of our formal instruction is based not
only on the reasons stated in section A of my report, but
on a premise that must be made very clear. That is the
assumption that the Guidelines which I have followed in
this case will be promptly applied to all Specials in the
Graduate School: all must be reviewed immediately in
the light of the same stringent Guidelines with a mani
festly even hand or the University will surely be con
demned vigorously, and not without justice, for bias in
the application of its standards. The question of Specials
in the Undergraduate School may be a different matter;
but we will also have to justify the existence of different
standards there if wc do, in fact, continue to administer
them.
