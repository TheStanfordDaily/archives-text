# Minority Opinion of Pittendrigh— Proposal Fails to Meet Graduate Criteria
## 
### 
I am unable to accept the conclusions of the majority
in several respects which 1 state in Section D. 1 recom
mend that the proposed course not only not be author
ized but not included in the Stanford Catalog; but my
position involves more than that simply-stated judgment
which I have reached adopting the CGS Guidelines
which you provided as the only basis for evaluation.
In what follows the merits of the proposed are ini
tially discussed strictly in terms of the Guidelines; in
subsequent sections I turn to other considerations that
qualify my judgment and raise issues which, in my
opinion, far transcend-in their importance-the disposi
tion of this particular case. (Italics are the author's)
A. The Proposal Evaluated in
Terms of the CGS Guidelines
The considerations outlined in Part I of the Guide
lines have already been addressed in my letter covering
both the majority and the minority reports. Parts II and
111 are intimately related, and while I will consider
everything they contain, the following paragraphs are
structured to minimize unnecessary repetition. Numerals
given in parentheses (e.g. 2.1, 3.3, etc.) designate the
Guidelines sections pertinent to what is being said.
a. Is the material of sufficient intellectual merit? Both
human genetics and the future well-being of man are
indisputably of sufficient intellectual merit to justify
treatment in the Graduate School with appropriate rigor.
b. Is the course on the level of graduate rather than
undergraduate instruction? (2.2). Here one is to consider
the course outline (3.1), the reading list (3.2), the course
structure (3.3). the academic background of the students
envisaged, and the prerequisites for admission to the
course (3.6).
The course outline is sufficiently explicit but leaves
one uncertain as to its real purpose. Thus on the one

hand it states, "The focus of this course will be upon
new quantitative methods. . . etc. We are told Profes
sor Shockley will employ "some new pedagogical tech
niques. . . specifically "the 'coin-tossing' method of
bringing analysis of variance to a level comprehensible to
the practical man-in-the-street." The subsequent para
graph promptly states "the thesis of this course is that
dysgenic trends will impact on the future of humanity in
a manner and to a degree that cannot justifiably be
casually dismissed. . . etc.
On the one hand we are left with the impression that
in its methodological instruction it will be at a level
appropriate to a university extension course directed at
an untrained audience. This conclusion is consonant
with the fact that no prerequisites in the way of prior
training in either statistics, genetics or psychology are
demanded.
On the other hand one is led to understand that the
scope of the course extends to cover the grand questions
of the "future of humanity" and our "moral obliga
tions" to study the role played by the evolution of the
human gene pool in that future. The issues here are so
immense, so diverse and so debatable that they cannot
be treated at the graduate level in one quarter by any
single scholar, no matter how well prepared he may be.
The list of readings (2.3) appended to the proposal
consists almost entirely of pieces written by Professor
Shockley himself, only two of which appear to have
been published and none in refereed journals of the first
rank.
The only items not by himself are the now famous
paper of A. E. Jensen and one by R. T. Osborne entitled
"Population Pollution." Both men share Professor
Shockley's strongly contested views on the extent to
which racial differences in 1Q performance tests are
genetically determined. Professor Shockley's own state
ment of the course leaves no doubt that whatever its
stated focus or thesis will be, the central theme will be
his assertion that the "black minority" suffers from an
innate disability with respect to intelligence.
The readings he lists contain nothing from the now
substantial body of published criticism to which his
views have been subjected. Further, he frankly states
that (presumably only), "If time allows the results pub
lished by others on the validity of standard tests in
predicting performance independent of race will be cov
ered." The readings and the conditional nature of the
treatment of others' work are clearly incompatible with
any reasonable criterion of adequacy in graduate educa
tion.
Thus I can find no basis-in how he will handle its
stated focus, in its stated thesis, in its clear theme, or in
its failure to expose students to other viewpoints to
conclude the course is appropriate for inclusion in the
formal instructional program of the Stanford Graduate
School.
c. Is the instructor competent to teach the proposed
course? In addressing this question I have adopted the
premise that when an individual faculty member re
quests authorization to give formal instruction, the bur
den is on him to demonstrate his competence; the bur
den cannot be on a reviewing committee to make a
positive demonstration of incompetence.
I find that Professor Shockley has not sufficiently
demonstrated his competence to give formal instruction
in the many areas he intends to cover other than statis
tics.
In arriving at this conclusion I have consulted with
