Secret Missile Curb Talks
WASHINGTON — The White House said yesterday
that President Nixon has had recent secret
exchanges with Soviet Communist party chief
Leonid I. Brezhnev which Nixon believes have
substantially increased the possibility of a
U.S.-Soviet missile-curb agreement.
Nixon has ordered Ambassador Gerard C. Smith,
top U.S. negotiator at the U.S.-Soviet Strategic
Arms Limitation talks, to return to the Helsinki
negotiations with new instructions.
The President was reported confident that the
Soviet envoy to the SALT parley, Vladimir
Semenov, also will receive from his government new
instructions which "can lead to an agreement which
is mutually acceptable to both sides."
Dock Strike Possible
SAN FRANCISCO — Harry Bridges, West Coast
longshore union leader, said Monday a shutdown of
all U.S. ports is possible if the Pay Board trims the
contract terms won by International
Longshoremen's Association.
The Pay Board meets in Washington to consider
the ILA agreements covering Atlantic and Gulf
Coast ports. It already has trimmed the Pacific
Coast contract won by the International
Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union.
GM, Ford Indicted
WASHINGTON — The nation's two largest auto
manufacturers, General Motors and Ford were
indicted by a federal grand jury yesterday on
charges of conspiring to restrict competition in the
fleet market, the Justice Department announced.
The two-count indictment was filed together
with a companion civil suit in U.S. District Court in
Detroit.
General Motors and Ford quickly responded.
Ford said, "accusations in the indictment are not
true," and GM said it will seek an immediate trial,
confident it will be vindicated and the government's
charges shown to have "no basis in fact."
Named as unindicted co-conspirators were the
National Automobile Dealers Association, a trade
association of new-car dealers franchised by the
automobile manufacturers and Peterson, Howell &
Heather Inc. the nation's largest automobile-leasing
company.

Some Controls Lifted
WASHINGTON — The government yesterday lifted
pay and price controls from millions of small
businesses and small governmental units.
It also tightened its grip on medium-size builders
and hospitals, and concentrated more of its controls
manpower on big businesses and big unions.
Director Donald Rumsfeld of the Cost of Living
Council said the changes are designed to make
controls work better by cutting red tape.
He said controls will stay in effect for the rest of
the economy until they work, and declined to
predict when they would be ended.
The Council removed both pay and price
controls generally from businesses and local
governmental units with 60 or fewer employees.
However, unions and firms of whatever size in
the health and construction industries remain
subject to controls because their prices have risen
far faster than others.
Also, rent controls remain in effect for landlords
not exempted earlier.
Boyle's Election Overturned
WASHINGTON - A U.S. District Court judge
yesterday overturned the 1969 election of United
Mine Workers President W.A. "Tony" Boyle.
Judge William Bryant agreed with the
government's contention that the union used union
money and facilities to conduct an
irregularity-studded election weighted in Boyle's
favor.
Bryant instructed the Justice Department to
submit on May 8 an order detailing how a new
election should be conducted under the supervision
of the secretary of labor.
In a lengthy opinion following a six-month trial,
Bryant wrote that in order to find for the union,
"the court would be forced to swim upstream
against the tide of evidence too strong to resist."
"The walls of justice are closing in on Tony
Boyle," said Attorney Joseph Rauh one of the
parties in the complex legal action.
There was no immediate comment from union
officials.
In the bitter 1969 campaign, Boyle defeated an
insurgent union faction led by presidential
candidate Joseph A. "Jock" Yablonski.

Yablonski, his wife and daughter were shot to
death in their Pennsylvania home just three weeks
after the election.
I)uvis Trial Awaits Ruling
SAN JOSE — Angela Davis' prosecutor called
peripheral witnesses yesterday while awaiting a
critical ruling of her trial—whether he will be
allowed to show jurors Davis' volatile diary of love
and hate.
Superior Court Judge Richard E. Arnason has
indicated he will rule this week on the issue.
Prosecutor Albert Harris has said that if the diary is
barred, "we might as well pack up and go home.
That is what this case is all about."
Excerpts of the document, contested last week in
a secret chambers session and made public
yesterday, reveal Davis raging against the prison
system and envisioning herself tearing down prison
bars to free convict George Jackson.
"I, your wife, your comrade who is supposed to
love you, fight with you, fight for you," she
declared in the diary.
The defense accused the prosecutor of invading
Davis' privacy. "Your point of view is disgusting,"
attorney Howard Moore told Harris. "You are a
distorted bigotist."
The diary—found in Jackson's cell after he was
slain in an alleged San Quentin escape attempt last
year-was pared down to seven pages by Harris after
the judge ruled there was too much irrelevant
material in it.
Harris contends the diary will show jurors that
Davis "would undertake violent means to bring
about the freedom of George Jackson."
The diary, written in several sections, starts just
after Davis had her only physical meeting with
Jackson in a prison holding cell while both were
incarcerated. She speaks of that meeting:
"A scene frozen in my mind: I am standing in
the little glass cubicle downstairs, standing waiting,
loving, desiring, and then hot cold rage when the
chains begin to rattle as you slowly descend the
stairs surrounded by that small army of mindless
but armed automatons.
". . . I'm supposed to rip off the chains. I'm
supposed to fight your enemies with my body, but I
am helpless, powerless, I contain the rage inside, I
do nothing."
