# Two hey Primaries Test Demos Strength
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
The Presidential aspirations of Hu
bert Humphrey, George McGovern and
George Wallace face yet another
crucial test today with primaries in
Ohio, Indiana and Alabama.
Congressional Delegate Walter
Fauntroy, a black, is seeking nomina
tion as a favorite son in the District of
Columbia primary. Delegates pledged
to President Nixon are opposed by
some pledged to Congressman Pete
McCloskey in Ohio and Alabama, but
are unopposed in Indiana.
Vying for the 153 delegates at stake
in the Ohio Democratic primary are
Humphrey, McGovern, Senator Henry
M. Jackson (Wash.), Senator Edmund
S. Muskie (Me.), and former Senator
Eugene J. McCarthy (Minn.). Although
Humphrey is favored, McGovern ap
pears to be coming on strong. Muskie's
withdrawal from active contention for
the nomination has further confused
the situation.
Jackson has directed most of his
fire against McGovern's "liberalism,"
while making occasional swipes at
Humphrey.
McGovern has devoted most of his
attention to campaigning for the
support of blue collar workers and
blacks. Both groups are thought to be
bastions of Humphrey strength. Unit
ed Steel Workers President I.W. Abel
has endorsed and campaigned for
Humphrey.
Among the leading blacks who have
appeared in Ohio on McGovern's
behalf are Southern Christian Leader
ship Conference president Ralph David
Abernathy; Operation PUSH Director
Jesse L. Jackson; Congressman John
Conyers, Jr. (D.-Mich.); and Georgia
State Representative Julian Bond.
Blacks comprise 15 percent of the
Ohio electorate.

Candidates in the Indiana Demo
cratic primary are Humphrey, Wallace
and Muskie. Once again, Humphrey is
favored in this primary in which 76
delegate seats will be contested.
Reportedly many supporters of
McGovern, who fs not on the ballot,
will cast their votes for Muskie as part
of a stop-Humphrey strategy.
Humphrey's apparent lead comes in
spite of the fact that he has made
relatively few visits to Indiana com
pared to Wallace. However, state
Democratic Central Committee Chair
man Gordon St. Angelo, a former
Lindsay backer, predicts that Wallace
will win with "a potential of 42 or 43
percent of the vote." St. Angelo
believes that large numbers of Republi
cans will cross over for Wallace.
Indiana Senator Birch E. Bayh still
backs Muskie while his colleague,
Senator Vance Hartke, endorsed Hum
phrey after an abortive presidential bid
of his own.
In the Alabama primary, most of
the delegates committed to Wallace are
opposed by uncommitted delegates
being run by an anti-Wallace faction in
the state.
Also being contested in the Ala
bama primary are the Republican and
Democratic senatorial nominations.
Six-term incumbent John Spark man is
opposed by six others in the Demo
cratic contest. Former U.S. Postmaster
General Winton M. Blount is vying
with three other Republicans for his
party's nomination.

The Presidential aspirations of Hu
bert Humphrey, George McGovern and
George Wallace face yet another
crucial test today with primaries in
Ohio, Indiana and Alabama.
Congressional Delegate Walter
Fauntroy, a black, is seeking nomina
tion as a favorite son in the District of
Columbia primary. Delegates pledged
to President Nixon are opposed by
some pledged to Congressman Pete
McCloskey in Ohio and Alabama, but
are unopposed in Indiana.
Vying for the 153 delegates at stake
in the Ohio Democratic primary are
Humphrey, McGovern, Senator Henry
M. Jackson (Wash.), Senator Edmund
S. Muskie (Me.), and former Senator
Eugene J. McCarthy (Minn.). Although
Humphrey is favored, McGovern ap
pears to be coming on strong. Muskie's
withdrawal from active contention for
the nomination has further confused
the situation.
Jackson has directed most of his
fire against McGovern's "liberalism,"
while making occasional swipes at
Humphrey.
McGovern has devoted most of his
attention to campaigning for the
support of blue collar workers and
blacks. Both groups are thought to be
bastions of Humphrey strength. Unit
ed Steel Workers President I.W. Abel
has endorsed and campaigned for
Humphrey.
Among the leading blacks who have
appeared in Ohio on McGovern's
behalf are Southern Christian Leader
ship Conference president Ralph David
Abernathy; Operation PUSH Director
Jesse L. Jackson; Congressman John
Conyers, Jr. (D.-Mich.); and Georgia
State Representative Julian Bond.
Blacks comprise 15 percent of the
Ohio electorate.

Candidates in the Indiana Demo
cratic primary are Humphrey, Wallace
and Muskie. Once again, Humphrey is
favored in this primary in which 76
delegate seats will be contested.
Reportedly many supporters of
McGovern, who fs not on the ballot,
will cast their votes for Muskie as part
of a stop-Humphrey strategy.
Humphrey's apparent lead comes in
spite of the fact that he has made
relatively few visits to Indiana com
pared to Wallace. However, state
Democratic Central Committee Chair
man Gordon St. Angelo, a former
Lindsay backer, predicts that Wallace
will win with "a potential of 42 or 43
percent of the vote." St. Angelo
believes that large numbers of Republi
cans will cross over for Wallace.
Indiana Senator Birch E. Bayh still
backs Muskie while his colleague,
Senator Vance Hartke, endorsed Hum
phrey after an abortive presidential bid
of his own.
In the Alabama primary, most of
the delegates committed to Wallace are
opposed by uncommitted delegates
being run by an anti-Wallace faction in
the state.
Also being contested in the Ala
bama primary are the Republican and
Democratic senatorial nominations.
Six-term incumbent John Spark man is
opposed by six others in the Demo
cratic contest. Former U.S. Postmaster
General Winton M. Blount is vying
with three other Republicans for his
party's nomination.
