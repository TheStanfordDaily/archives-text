# North Captures Quang Tri; Control Key Coastal Province
## 
### 
North Vietnamese forces yesterday
won the first major victory of their
33-day-old offensive by capturing
Quang Tri, the northernmost province
of South Vietnam.
After five days of vicious assaults
by four North Vietnamese divisions,
South Vietnamese military comman
ders and a number of U.S. advisers fled
Quang Tri City by helicopter, leaving
some 10,000 troops to fend for
themselves.
Communist troops also seized con
trol of the northern portion of Binh
Dinh province along the central coast.
The captured area in Binh Dinh has a
population of 200,000 and produces
an important rice crop.
Key portions of Highway 1 north
of the U.S. airbase at Da Nang were
cut by the North Vietnamese. Viet
Cong and North Vietnamese forces

also increased their pressure on Kon
tum, a provincial capital in the central
highlands, and on An Loc, another
provincial capital 60 miles north of
Saigon. An Loc has been under siege
for more than three weeks.
According to Associated Press re
ports the fall of Quang Tri exposes the
former imperial capital of Hue to
imminent attack by the North Vie
tnamese. Hue is 24 miles south of the
northernmost defensive line of the
South Vietnamese.
Commanders Evacuated
Officers in Da Nang said that 80
U.S. advisers had been evacuated from
Quang Tri while 16 others, mostly
Marines, volunteered to stay with the
South Vietnamese troops remaining
there.
Brig. Gen. Vu Van Giai, 3rd
Division commander, fled the city
along with his entire staff of 48
officers. South Vietnamese com
manders in Hue were reported to have
sent their families southward to a safer
area in anticipation of a North
Vietnamese attack on the city.
Communist forces attacked nine
miles west of Hue and a Viet Cong
guerrilla was captured attempting to
blow up command headquarters with
in the city.
'Disarrayed'
American pilots flying over the
Quang Tri area reported that the
South Vietnamese troops there, now
without commanders, "were complete
ly disarrayed. They are not a fighting
unit any more."
The Associated Press also reported
that Viet Cong forces cut Highway 1
about 10 miles north of Da Nang at
the 3,500-foot Hai Van Pass. The
attack on the highway is significant in

that it has served as the major supply
route from Da Nang to the northern
front. Nearly 25,000 refugees have
fled south on the highway from Quang
Tri alone.
Six miles north of Kontum, South
Vietnamese forces abandoned Fire
Base Lima after vigorous and repeated
attacks by the North Vietnamese and
Viet Cong. Before their withdrawal
from the city 800 rangers, assisted by
U.S. bombers, had beaten back one
Communist assault in which four
American-made tanks had been cap
tured.
700 Missions
The U.S. Command in Saigon also
announced yesterday that in the
10-day period beginning on April 20,
U.S. bombers flew 700 missions over
North Vietnam. The military sources
alleged that more than 250 North
Vietnamese trucks had been damaged
or destroyed by the bombing.
It was reported that more than
350,000 refugees "are on the roads of
South Vietnam, seeking escape from
the thunderous fighting in the north
ern provinces and central highlands."
According to A.P. Hue became the
nexus of refugee traffic in the north as
civilians fled south from Quang Tri
and as large portions of the Hue
population headed towards the relative
safety of Da Nang.
Speaking yesterday at a barbecue
hosted by Treasury Secretary John
Connally, President Nixon said that
South Vietnam would fall if American
air and naval support were terminated.
He warned that "the North Viet
namese are taking a very grave risk if
they continue this invasion of the
South. 11l just leave it there and let
them make their choice."
