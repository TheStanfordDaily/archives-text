# Law School Faculty Statement Due Today
## 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
Law School faculty members plan
to issue a statement today in response
to demands made by Chicano, black
and Native American law students that
minority admissions be increased be
ginning next year.
Members of the Stanford Black
Law Students Association, the Stan
ford Chicano Law Students Associa
tion, and the American Indian Law
Students at Stanford presented a joint
list of demands to the law school
faculty last week asking that a special
minorities admissions policy be set up.
The three organizations demanded
that a quota of 50 minority students
be established for each entering class
of 160, including 20 blacks, 20
Chicanos, and 10 Native Americans.
Faculty Meets
Law school faculty members met
for four hours yesterday to discuss the
demands. Law School Dean Thomas
Ehrlich said last night that he would
not make the results of that meeting
public until he had contacted the
heads of the three minority organiza
tions.
James Ware, president of the
Stanford Black Law Students Associa
tion said last night that the three
organizations will be meeting today to
discuss the decision made by the
faculty and to decide about what
action, if any, the groups plan to take

in response to the decision.
Ware also said that the three
organizations will probably issue a
joint statement today or tomorrow.
The minority students' statement
presented to the faculty last week,
praised Assistant Dean Thelton Hen
derson, in charge of minority admis
sions to the law school, and asked that
he be "given a free hand to produce an
entering class of 50 minority stu
dents."
Quality Class
The statement said that under those
conditions he could "unquestionably
provide a quality class."
Similar demands made by students
at University of California's Boalt Hall
led to a sit-in at that building last
week. However, LaDoris Hazzard of
the Stanford Black Law Students
Association said that there was "no
coordinated effort" between the Ber
keley and Stanford demands.
In a statement printed in yester
day's Daily, the minority organizations
charged that in the last four years
there has been only a "negligible
increase" in minority admissions de
spite "increased efforts to recruit"
them.
Henderson said that minority en
rollments are substantially on the rise,
despite the fact that only three
minority students will be among this
June's graduates.
