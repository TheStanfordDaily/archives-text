## Adulthood Has Its Price 
### 
San francisco chronicle

"Adulthood," said President Richard W. Lyman
of Stanford University last week in remarks
broadcast over the campus radio, "has its price."
Since this statement was addressed to an
audience practically all of whom were over 18 and
therefore certifiable adults by the Constitution of
the United States for voting and by the laws of
California for many other purposes (save drinking),
it was entirely appropriate. President Lyman was
presumably heard by some of the 116 Stanford
students who had been arrested on Friday, April 21,
for trying to block traffic on El Camino Real in
protest of the bombing of North Vietnam, and his
observations may even prove instructive to them as
their cases wind through the courts.
In Loco Parentis
For a good many years, Dr. Lyman noted, a good
many people have been working to eliminate the "in
loco parentis" role of universities everywhere. It
results in abolishing dormitory rules, in loosening
curricular requirements, and in encouraging political
involvement by the 18-age group.
But there are responsibilities involved in all of
this: "Adults are responsible for their actions," he
reminded, "and do not get the privilege, once
enjoyed by students here and elsewhere, of being
turned over to the college authorities when they got
arrested."
A lot of parents as well as a lot of students have

forgotten this telling point of difference between
the present and the good old days. The Stanford
Daily has been complaining about it â€” "Lyman
chose to give the (Santa Clara) Sheriff's office a
blank check," it said, but the Stanford president
drily rejoined that a good many seemed unaware
that he did not control the police.
No Constructive Influence
After making that clear, he went on to raise what
we think is the proper, basic question: "Did
stopping the traffic have any constructive influence
on the course of American politics? I should think
none whatever. . . ."
Of course he is right; stopping traffic influences
nothing, nor do breaking windows and wrecking
laboratory equipment and any of the other things
that today's highly privileged university youth are
accustomed to doing. What the El Camino
demonstration achieved was to cause people around
the country to ask themselves why Stanford
students throw rocks at police. What gets obscured,
Dr. Lyman said, as they ask themselves that, is the
"vital fact of massive opposition to President
Nixon's moves in Southeast Asia.
"Can it be," he went on, "that there are some for
whom police confrontations, not effective work for
peace, are the real objectives?"
