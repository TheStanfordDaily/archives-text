# oppose 'stanford corporation'
## Boycott Stores, Fund Drive 
### 
In my opinion it is incorrect
and arrogant to have people who
are part of the Stanford
University community spend
sustained energy and efforts
convincing other corporations or
the military services to stop what
they are doing and to ask people
involved in these corporations to
subvert their corporations from
within or leave their present jobs
if we are not prepared first to
sustain an effort here at the
Stanford Corporation first.
I have explicitly stated the
value of sustained work, for a few
one shot deals have some small
effect on public opinion and with
certain corporations and the
military services it is necessary to
show our disapproval; but our
everyday sustained efforts of

education, strategy, action, and
committment must take pi'ace in
our own corporation first.
Stanford University long ago
ceased to be the tree-lined college
that simply carried the values of
one generation to another and it
developed into a massive
corporation. Stanford University
is now a corporation that has
education as only a part of its
work. The Trustees, our legal
owners, are also individually or
cooperatively involved in the
upper echelons of the major
corporations, industry, and
government that perpetrate war
and exploitation throughout the
world.
Trustees Make Decisions
The Trustees set the corporate
policy and, with advice from a
small group of administrators,
make decisions without the direct
advice and consent of the
community. The Stanford
Industrial Park houses many of
the corporations our Trustees are
involved with and many of the
major corporations directly
supplying the military with hard
and soft ware and better
technology to maim and destroy
efficiently. Not only is OUR
industrial park leased out to these
corporations, but NO housing and
necessary living environment is
provided for the approximate
50,000 people the leasing of
Stanford lands brings to this area.
Stanford officials in charge of
land use have consistently turned
down proposals put forth by
student, faculty, and
administration advisory
committees. We see committees of
people, who are not even
representative of the people they
are dealing with, making
recommendations that are
moderate, yet most often these
are turned down.
Over and over in the Stanford
Corporation we see people's
opinions worth nothing unless
they agree with an administrative
opinion. Over and over again in
the academic realm we see the
resources of the university used to
punish people, and subvert or
discourage educational reform or

experimentation Our
administration does not stand
still, it hires police and
prosecutors, it has a fund raising
campaign of $300,000,000, it
builds new high-rise hotels, it
pushes for new freeways and it
secretly goes before judges seeking
injunctions against specific people
and 1000 John Does. The
administration does not use the
resources of this corporation to
solve basic problems that cause
the more superficial disorderliness
of the University, but moves on
one hand to crush opposition and
on the other to increase the depth
and magnitude of the problems.
Administrators Rule
And what of our supposed
academic area of the Stanford
Corporation? We know there is
approximately $16,000,000
annually in Department of
Defense contracting going on in
the University. We know that
closed circuit TV in the
engineering schools helps educate
corporations in the industrial
park. The net result of B.A.P. is
that administrators, not the
academic community, determine
academic pursuits.
Much life-affirming work takes
place here at Stanford in spite of
the administration. New programs
and new ideas flourish and will
last a while before there is a
bureaucracy to hinder them at
every turn. Students, faculty, and
staff become more knowledgeable
about what they wish to learn as
Stanford administrators set up
such hard-lined opposition to
positive uses of our resources that
as an anti-thesis we see where we
wish to go. Living units join
together and break individual
competition as we see how hard
and desperate our corporation will
become to hold every line, and to
become so tight it will break.
In the recrutiing issue, every
legitimate process was tried —
votes, presidential committees,
picketing, demonstrations,
Campus Judicial Panel
proceedings, arrests, and fasting —
only to have no change in policy.
Those administrators who wish to
remain flexible, who are open to

seeing themselves as
representatives of people rather
than as workers for a hard-line
corporation put themselves, their
upward mobility and security in
jeopardy. The combination of
these factors shows us the
necessity of a sustained anti-war
movement here in the Stanford
University Corporation.
We of the anti-war movement
have tried many techniques of
changing our community and I
offer another suggestion.
President Lyman often
misrepresents truth with omission.
Just as he refused to agree that
police and demonstrators are
caused by problems at Stanford,
by what Stanford as a corporation
does, he also refuses to stop war
complicity without pressure.
I suggest a boycott of the
Stanford Shopping Center. The
Stanford University Corporation
is the landlord of the Shopping
Center. This boycott will be
two-fold: to ask all students,
faculty and staff not to shop at
the Shopping Center, and to ask
all other patrons of this area to
join us. We do this as a protest
against our Stanford Corporation
and our direct involvement with
the war. We will picket the
Shopping Center and give our
literature on consumer products
produced by war corporations.
This will not be glamorous or
romantic work and will take time
and organization. We will
primarily be dealing with large
corporations located in the
Shopping Center and will do
research on their connections with
war. This Stanford Shopping
Center Boycott is to put pressure

David josephson

upon our Corporation to leave
war and move to peace.
In conjunction with the
Shopping Center Boycott I
suggest there be an organized
boycott of the $300,000,000
fund raising campaign. All of us,
students, faculty and staff can
write our relatives and friends
asking them not to contribute to
the fund, and why we feel this
way. We can come together and
think about other uses of fund
raising. It is true that these actions
are far more humble and honest
than asking someone else
someplace else to make some
sacrifices and confront their
corporations. We must face
directly the fact that the
administration, no matter what
they fell or say personally, have
been increasing their hardline
resistance to change in the
university and in desperation have
increased the coarseness of their
repression.
Those interested in the boycott
may contact Columbae House.
The process of working
together will, in itself, have
positive benefits and we may
educate others as to Stanford
Corporation's work for war, as
well as bring direct pressure on
our Corporation to move from
war to peace. Unfortunately, to
live in peace will take struggle. We
must figure out how to struggle in
a manner that gives us humaness. I
add this suggestion as one more
method thrown in to the
laughing/crying struggle for peace.

the University. We know that
closed circuit TV in the
engineering schools helps educate
corporations in the industrial
park. The net result of B.A.P. is
that administrators, not the
academic community, determine
academic pursuits.
Much life-affirming work takes
place here at Stanford in spite of
the administration. New programs
and new ideas flourish and will
last a while before there is a
bureaucracy to hinder them at
every turn. Students, faculty, and
staff become more knowledgeable
about what they wish to learn as
Stanford administrators set up
such hard-lined opposition to
positive uses of our resources that
as an anti-thesis we see where we
wish to go. Living units join
together and break individual
competition as we see how hard
and desperate our corporation will
become to hold every line, and to
become so tight it will break.
In the recrutiing issue, every
legitimate process was tried —
votes, presidential committees,
picketing, demonstrations,
Campus Judicial Panel
proceedings, arrests, and fasting —
only to have no change in policy.
Those administrators who wish to
remain flexible, who are open to

seeing themselves as
representatives of people rather
than as workers for a hard-line
corporation put themselves, their
upward mobility and security in
jeopardy. The combination of
these factors shows us the
necessity of a sustained anti-war
movement here in the Stanford
University Corporation.
We of the anti-war movement
have tried many techniques of
changing our community and I
offer another suggestion.
President Lyman often
misrepresents truth with omission.
Just as he refused to agree that
police and demonstrators are
caused by problems at Stanford,
by what Stanford as a corporation
does, he also refuses to stop war
complicity without pressure.
I suggest a boycott of the
Stanford Shopping Center. The
Stanford University Corporation
is the landlord of the Shopping
Center. This boycott will be
two-fold: to ask all students,
faculty and staff not to shop at
the Shopping Center, and to ask
all other patrons of this area to
join us. We do this as a protest
against our Stanford Corporation
and our direct involvement with
the war. We will picket the
Shopping Center and give our
literature on consumer products
produced by war corporations.
This will not be glamorous or
romantic work and will take time
and organization. We will
primarily be dealing with large
corporations located in the
Shopping Center and will do
research on their connections with
war. This Stanford Shopping
Center Boycott is to put pressure

David josephson

upon our Corporation to leave
war and move to peace.
In conjunction with the
Shopping Center Boycott I
suggest there be an organized
boycott of the $300,000,000
fund raising campaign. All of us,
students, faculty and staff can
write our relatives and friends
asking them not to contribute to
the fund, and why we feel this
way. We can come together and
think about other uses of fund
raising. It is true that these actions
are far more humble and honest
than asking someone else
someplace else to make some
sacrifices and confront their
corporations. We must face
directly the fact that the
administration, no matter what
they fell or say personally, have
been increasing their hardline
resistance to change in the
university and in desperation have
increased the coarseness of their
repression.
Those interested in the boycott
may contact Columbae House.
The process of working
together will, in itself, have
positive benefits and we may
educate others as to Stanford
Corporation's work for war, as
well as bring direct pressure on
our Corporation to move from
war to peace. Unfortunately, to
live in peace will take struggle. We
must figure out how to struggle in
a manner that gives us humaness. I
add this suggestion as one more
method thrown in to the
laughing/crying struggle for peace.
(David Josephson is ASSU Guest
Professor of Social Thought and

In my opinion it is incorrect
and arrogant to have people who
are part of the Stanford
University community spend
sustained energy and efforts
convincing other corporations or
the military services to stop what
they are doing and to ask people
involved in these corporations to
subvert their corporations from
within or leave their present jobs
if we are not prepared first to
sustain an effort here at the
Stanford Corporation first.
I have explicitly stated the
value of sustained work, for a few
one shot deals have some small
effect on public opinion and with
certain corporations and the
military services it is necessary to
show our disapproval; but our
everyday sustained efforts of

education, strategy, action, and
committment must take pi'ace in
our own corporation first.
Stanford University long ago
ceased to be the tree-lined college
that simply carried the values of
one generation to another and it
developed into a massive
corporation. Stanford University
is now a corporation that has
education as only a part of its
work. The Trustees, our legal
owners, are also individually or
cooperatively involved in the
upper echelons of the major
corporations, industry, and
government that perpetrate war
and exploitation throughout the
world.
Trustees Make Decisions
The Trustees set the corporate
policy and, with advice from a
small group of administrators,
make decisions without the direct
advice and consent of the
community. The Stanford
Industrial Park houses many of
the corporations our Trustees are
involved with and many of the
major corporations directly
supplying the military with hard
and soft ware and better
technology to maim and destroy
efficiently. Not only is OUR
industrial park leased out to these
corporations, but NO housing and
necessary living environment is
provided for the approximate
50,000 people the leasing of
Stanford lands brings to this area.
Stanford officials in charge of
land use have consistently turned
down proposals put forth by
student, faculty, and
administration advisory
committees. We see committees of
people, who are not even
representative of the people they
are dealing with, making
recommendations that are
moderate, yet most often these
are turned down.
Over and over in the Stanford
Corporation we see people's
opinions worth nothing unless
they agree with an administrative
opinion. Over and over again in
the academic realm we see the
resources of the university used to
punish people, and subvert or
discourage educational reform or

experimentation Our
administration does not stand
still, it hires police and
prosecutors, it has a fund raising
campaign of $300,000,000, it
builds new high-rise hotels, it
pushes for new freeways and it
secretly goes before judges seeking
injunctions against specific people
and 1000 John Does. The
administration does not use the
resources of this corporation to
solve basic problems that cause
the more superficial disorderliness
of the University, but moves on
one hand to crush opposition and
on the other to increase the depth
and magnitude of the problems.
Administrators Rule
And what of our supposed
academic area of the Stanford
Corporation? We know there is
approximately $16,000,000
annually in Department of
Defense contracting going on in
the University. We know that
closed circuit TV in the
engineering schools helps educate
corporations in the industrial
park. The net result of B.A.P. is
that administrators, not the

resistance to change in the
university and in desperation have
increased the coarseness of their
repression.
Those interested in the boycott
may contact Columbae House.
The process of working
together will, in itself, have
positive benefits and we may
educate others as to Stanford
Corporation's work for war, as
well as bring direct pressure on
our Corporation to move from
war to peace. Unfortunately, to
live in peace will take struggle. We
must figure out how to struggle in
a manner that gives us humaness. I
add this suggestion as one more
method thrown in to the
laughing/crying struggle for peace.
(David Josephson is ASSU Guest

In my opinion it is incorrect
and arrogant to have people who
are part of the Stanford
University community spend
sustained energy and efforts
convincing other corporations or
the military services to stop what
they are doing and to ask people
involved in these corporations to
subvert their corporations from
within or leave their present jobs
if we are not prepared first to
sustain an effort here at the
Stanford Corporation first.
I have explicitly stated the
value of sustained work, for a few
one shot deals have some small
effect on public opinion and with
certain corporations and the
military services it is necessary to
show our disapproval; but our
everyday sustained efforts of

education, strategy, action, and
committment must take pi'ace in
our own corporation first.
Stanford University long ago
ceased to be the tree-lined college
that simply carried the values of
one generation to another and it
developed into a massive
corporation. Stanford University
is now a corporation that has
education as only a part of its
work. The Trustees, our legal
owners, are also individually or
cooperatively involved in the
upper echelons of the major
corporations, industry, and
government that perpetrate war
and exploitation throughout the
world.
Trustees Make Decisions
The Trustees set the corporate
policy and, with advice from a
small group of administrators,
make decisions without the direct
advice and consent of the
community. The Stanford
Industrial Park houses many of
the corporations our Trustees are
involved with and many of the
major corporations directly
supplying the military with hard
and soft ware and better
technology to maim and destroy
efficiently. Not only is OUR
industrial park leased out to these
corporations, but NO housing and
necessary living environment is
provided for the approximate
50,000 people the leasing of
Stanford lands brings to this area.
Stanford officials in charge of
land use have consistently turned
down proposals put forth by
student, faculty, and
administration advisory
committees. We see committees of
people, who are not even
representative of the people they
are dealing with, making
recommendations that are
moderate, yet most often these
are turned down.
Over and over in the Stanford
Corporation we see people's
opinions worth nothing unless
they agree with an administrative
opinion. Over and over again in
the academic realm we see the
resources of the university used to
punish people, and subvert or
discourage educational reform or

experimentation Our
administration does not stand
still, it hires police and
prosecutors, it has a fund raising
campaign of $300,000,000, it
builds new high-rise hotels, it
pushes for new freeways and it
secretly goes before judges seeking
injunctions against specific people
and 1000 John Does. The
administration does not use the
resources of this corporation to
solve basic problems that cause
the more superficial disorderliness
of the University, but moves on
one hand to crush opposition and
on the other to increase the depth
and magnitude of the problems.
Administrators Rule
And what of our supposed
academic area of the Stanford
Corporation? We know there is
approximately $16,000,000
annually in Department of
Defense contracting going on in
the University. We know that
closed circuit TV in the
engineering schools helps educate
corporations in the industrial
park. The net result of B.A.P. is
that administrators, not the
academic community, determine
academic pursuits.
Much life-affirming work takes
place here at Stanford in spite of
the administration. New programs
and new ideas flourish and will
last a while before there is a
bureaucracy to hinder them at
every turn. Students, faculty, and
staff become more knowledgeable
about what they wish to learn as
Stanford administrators set up
such hard-lined opposition to
positive uses of our resources that
as an anti-thesis we see where we
wish to go. Living units join
together and break individual
competition as we see how hard
and desperate our corporation will
become to hold every line, and to
become so tight it will break.
In the recrutiing issue, every
legitimate process was tried —
votes, presidential committees,
picketing, demonstrations,
Campus Judicial Panel
proceedings, arrests, and fasting —
only to have no change in policy.
Those administrators who wish to
remain flexible, who are open to

seeing themselves as
representatives of people rather
than as workers for a hard-line
corporation put themselves, their
upward mobility and security in
jeopardy. The combination of
these factors shows us the
necessity of a sustained anti-war
movement here in the Stanford
University Corporation.
We of the anti-war movement
have tried many techniques of
changing our community and I
offer another suggestion.
President Lyman often
misrepresents truth with omission.
Just as he refused to agree that
police and demonstrators are
caused by problems at Stanford,
by what Stanford as a corporation
does, he also refuses to stop war
complicity without pressure.
I suggest a boycott of the
Stanford Shopping Center. The
Stanford University Corporation
is the landlord of the Shopping
Center. This boycott will be
two-fold: to ask all students,
faculty and staff not to shop at
the Shopping Center, and to ask
all other patrons of this area to
join us. We do this as a protest
against our Stanford Corporation
and our direct involvement with
the war. We will picket the
Shopping Center and give our
literature on consumer products
produced by war corporations.
This will not be glamorous or
romantic work and will take time
and organization. We will
primarily be dealing with large
corporations located in the
Shopping Center and will do
research on their connections with
war. This Stanford Shopping
Center Boycott is to put pressure

David josephson

upon our Corporation to leave
war and move to peace.
In conjunction with the
Shopping Center Boycott I
suggest there be an organized
boycott of the $300,000,000
fund raising campaign. All of us,
students, faculty and staff can
write our relatives and friends
asking them not to contribute to
the fund, and why we feel this
way. We can come together and
think about other uses of fund
raising. It is true that these actions
are far more humble and honest
than asking someone else
someplace else to make some
sacrifices and confront their
corporations. We must face
directly the fact that the
administration, no matter what
they fell or say personally, have
been increasing their hardline
resistance to change in the
university and in desperation have
increased the coarseness of their
repression.
