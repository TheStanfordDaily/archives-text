Lyman
Editor, THE DAILY:
Who is this character Dick
Lyman? Does he mean to be
taken seriously when he
conveniently ignores police
clubbings to casually criticize
student protestors for not having
any "constructive influence on
the course of American
politics"??
Our Dick, of course, is a real
pro at influencing American
politics. Why, just two years ago
he wrote a letter to the President
about the war. And this year,
bursting with moral outrage and
aiming to get closer still to the
decision-making ceViter, he took
the courageous step of writing yet
another letter to Nixon.
One wonders if his friend Dave
Packard has ever given Lyman the
inside word about just what
happens to these letters once they
enter the White House mailroom.
Influencing "the course of

American politics"? Think again,
Dick.
Then, Dick, if you really
believe in protesting Nixon's
bloody doings, you could show
him business won't go on as usual
at Stanford. You could do like the
president of the University of
Massachusetts, and kick military
recruitment off campus in protest;
you could at least have done like
the president of Columbia, and
shut the school down for a day.
True, the trustees might not
like it. But it would mean a lot
more to the people dying in
Vietnam than a letter to President
Nixon. And that's why you care
about, isn't it, Dick?
