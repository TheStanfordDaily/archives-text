Today
Today is Wednesday, May 3,
1972. Big deal. Actually, 162 years
ago today, Lord Byron made his
famous swim across the Hellespont.
It's rumored that when he stepped
out of the ocean he scraped his foot
on a sea Shelley. Also, diplomacy
buffs, 100 years ago today Lord
Northbrook was sworn in as
Viceroy of India. He was the first
British magistrate to have Kosher
food at the embassy. He claimed
that it was really convenient just
sending out to the Delhi. However,
he did such a lousy job as viceroy
that he was recalled to England. On
his way to the Foreign Office, his
carriage collided with that of the
foreign minister. He Nehruly
escaped injury and made the
famous statement, "I'm sari / ran
India."
