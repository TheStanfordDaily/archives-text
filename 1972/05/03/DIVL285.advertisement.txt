BIOFEEDBACK: TURNING ON
THE POWER OF YOUR MIND
WILL DISCUSS RIOFEEDRACK
AND SIGN COPIES OF HIS DOOK
It hud long been accepted fact that the involuntary nervous system which
regulates such functions as heartbeat, digestion, and the generation of different
sorts of brain waves, was beyond an individual's power to control. Biofeedback
research has demonstrated that if such functions are made apparent to the
individual, b v translating them into light or sound signals, a line on a roll of graph
paper, or the fluctuation of a needle on a dial, he can be trained to control them.
By listening to your brain waves, you can learn to control them to achieve inner
peace and joy, and even a drugless alpha-wave high. By observing your "body
waves," you can learn to adjust your heartbeat, lower your blood pressure, and
reduce muscular tension. Biofeedback training has been used to alleviate
insomnia, anxiety, pain, and muscular tics; it is useful in treating headache su 112 -
ferers, asthmatic children, and victims of stroke.
"The most important impact of biofeedback training will likely be on man's
conception of himself ... it places the power for change and control in the hands
of the individual, not with an external authority. Of all the technologies for
altering behavior, this is the first to rely on the individual's ability to guide his
own destiny. "
