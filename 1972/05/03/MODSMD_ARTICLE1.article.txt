# C-15 Students Walk Out
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
The six student members of the
Committee of 15 (C-15) walked out of
last night's committee meeting after a
faculty-majority judicial panel for
student discipline cases was approved
by an 8-7 vote.
According to the student members,
the new judicial system will closely
resemble the Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) as it is currently constituted.
Hearing officers will determine the
facts in cases, while a faculty-majority
(5 faculty members and 4 students)
panel will decide a defendants' guilt
and on the penalties for conviction.
The six student members have
written to the ASSU Council of
Presidents and Senate stating that "we
regard our continued participation in
Committee deliberations to be a
matter for the student body to
decide." They called for an immediate
student referendum on the issue to
give them "input from our constituen
cy."
The referendum would deal with
the question of whether a "faculty
dominated judicial panel" is accepta
ble to the student body. In an April,
1971 student referendum, a proposal
calling for a system "composed only
of students" was approved 1929-1186.
Return to Deliberations?
Regarding the referendum, the
letter from the students said "if the
answer is 'y es »' we will return to
normal deliberations. If the answer is
'no,' we will return to ask the
Committee to reconsider the composi

tion issue.
"Should the Committee refuse to
accept a student majority on the
above-mentioned panels, we will refuse
to participate in any further C-15
deliberations."
Explaining their walk-out, one
student said that it was "ridiculous to
legitimize a package deal vote which
includes a faculty-majority system that
is clearly unacceptable to us." The
students said that they regarded the
panel's composition as the most
important question before C-15.
Tabling Denied
The students said that they had
moved to table Law Prof. Jack
Friedenthal's motion regarding the 5-4
composition of the panel, but that the
full Committee had gone ahead with
the composition vote despite the
students' objections.
The six said that they had accepted
the hearing officer portion of the new
system "reluctantly," but as a "com
promise agreeable to us."
According to the students, the
panel will have four student members,
four faculty members and a voting
chairman who will either be a law
professor or another member of the
faculty who possesses the necessary
legal training. Under CJP procedures,
the panel chairman only casts a vote
when it is necessary to break a tie.
Friedenthal told the Daily last night
that the student walk-out was "silly, a
foolish gesture." He said he was
dismayed about the students' insis
tence upon an all-student panel, since
that represented only one of several

proposed reforms listed on the April,
1971 referendum.
Friedenthal mentioned that when
the panel considers Honor Code
violations, the judicial panel will
consist of the chairman and the four
student members. When asked to
explain why the student majority was
as restricted as it was, Friedenthal said
"students are better able to get a grasp
of Honor Code violations" than they
are for more political, non-academic
cases.
Friedenthal said, in addition, that
he felt the "faculty are more respon
sive to institutional demands" than are
students. However, he said "students
and faculty interests tend to mesh" in
Honor Code violation cases.


BRIMSTONE AND FIRE—Ron Lopez, a reportedly leather-lunged ordained minister of the Pentecostal Church, assails
an unfriendly heckler at Tresidder during lunch yesterday: "You ought to worry about your own salvation, sir. You're
going to hell." University Organist Herbert Nanney lashed out earlier at "you crazy fundamentalists" but was told, "you
smell like a college professor ... I smell vodka on your breath." Turning to the Bible, Nanney countered, to the crowd's
amusement, "Didn't Christ turn water into wine?" Lopez fought back: "Do you love your wife?" Nanney said yes.
"Would she like to see you out here making a scene?" Bystanders tried to bait him, but Lopez smiled often and urged
them to take "gospills. He shouted at skeptics and damned all Communists, but added there is "so much ignorance on
campus and so many arguments to draw them to Christ."

student said that it was "ridiculous to
legitimize a package deal vote which
includes a faculty-majority system that
is clearly unacceptable to us." The
students said that they regarded the
panel's composition as the most
important question before C-15.
Tabling Denied
The students said that they had
moved to table Law Prof. Jack
Friedenthal's motion regarding the 5-4
composition of the panel, but that the
full Committee had gone ahead with
the composition vote despite the
students' objections.
The six said that they had accepted
the hearing officer portion of the new
system "reluctantly," but as a "com
promise agreeable to us."
According to the students, the
panel will have four student members,
four faculty members and a voting
chairman who will either be a law
professor or another member of the
faculty who possesses the necessary
legal training. Under CJP procedures,
the panel chairman only casts a vote
when it is necessary to break a tie.
Friedenthal told the Daily last night
that the student walk-out was "silly, a
foolish gesture." He said he was
dismayed about the students' insis
tence upon an all-student panel, since
that represented only one of several

proposed reforms listed on the April,
1971 referendum.
Friedenthal mentioned that when
the panel considers Honor Code
violations, the judicial panel will
consist of the chairman and the four
student members. When asked to
explain why the student majority was
as restricted as it was, Friedenthal said
"students are better able to get a grasp
of Honor Code violations" than they
are for more political, non-academic
cases.
Friedenthal said, in addition, that
he felt the "faculty are more respon
sive to institutional demands" than are
students. However, he said "students
and faculty interests tend to mesh" in
Honor Code violation cases.


BRIMSTONE AND FIRE—Ron Lopez, a reportedly leather-lunged ordained minister of the Pentecostal Church, assails
an unfriendly heckler at Tresidder during lunch yesterday: "You ought to worry about your own salvation, sir. You're
going to hell." University Organist Herbert Nanney lashed out earlier at "you crazy fundamentalists" but was told, "you
smell like a college professor ... I smell vodka on your breath." Turning to the Bible, Nanney countered, to the crowd's
amusement, "Didn't Christ turn water into wine?" Lopez fought back: "Do you love your wife?" Nanney said yes.
"Would she like to see you out here making a scene?" Bystanders tried to bait him, but Lopez smiled often and urged
them to take "gospills. He shouted at skeptics and damned all Communists, but added there is "so much ignorance on
campus and so many arguments to draw them to Christ."
The six student members of the
Committee of 15 (C-15) walked out of
last night's committee meeting after a
faculty-majority judicial panel for
student discipline cases was approved
by an 8-7 vote.
According to the student members,
the new judicial system will closely
resemble the Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) as it is currently constituted.
Hearing officers will determine the
facts in cases, while a faculty-majority
(5 faculty members and 4 students)
panel will decide a defendants' guilt
and on the penalties for conviction.
The six student members have
written to the ASSU Council of
Presidents and Senate stating that "we
regard our continued participation in
Committee deliberations to be a
matter for the student body to
decide." They called for an immediate
student referendum on the issue to
give them "input from our constituen
cy."
The referendum would deal with
the question of whether a "faculty
dominated judicial panel" is accepta
ble to the student body. In an April,
1971 student referendum, a proposal
calling for a system "composed only
of students" was approved 1929-1186.
Return to Deliberations?
Regarding the referendum, the
letter from the students said "if the
answer is 'y es »' we will return to
normal deliberations. If the answer is
'no,' we will return to ask the
Committee to reconsider the composi

tion issue.
"Should the Committee refuse to
accept a student majority on the
above-mentioned panels, we will refuse
to participate in any further C-15
deliberations."

student said that it was "ridiculous to
legitimize a package deal vote which
