## Open Recruiting and Marines 
### 
Howard zinn

(Editor's Note: On March 27,
1972, a demonstration against
Marine Corps recruitment on the
Boston University campus was
broken up by police. This is a
portion of a comment on that
event published in the April 12
Boston Phoenix by Howard Zinn,
Professor of Government at
Boston University. John Silber,
referred to, is the president of
that institution.)
John Silber would like to avoid
discussing the Marines.
Philosophers are sometimes
annoyed by the intrusion of facts
into comfortably vacuous
generalizations. He says, "We're
going to operate a free campus
here, so that students who are
interested in acquiring
information on a variety of jobs
may find that information
available on this campus ... I feel
obligated to defend the open
campus policy."
One would think from that
statement by Silber after the
Placement Office events that
students were protesting the
recruitment of Fuller Brush
salesmen, instead of men to burn
huts, kill peasants, invade other
countries. Silber wants us to
forget that, and so he talks
abstractly about the "open
campus." But it is part of rational
inquiry to examine the empirical
contents of concepts. Let's look
at the "open campus":
No Open Campus
The campus is not and never
has been open, so the term is
fraudulent. Not all organizations
are given space to recruit; the very
language of the University Council
statement sets standards for

recruiting — "legally constituted
organizations" from certain fields;
that provides a basis for exclusion.
SDS has lost its privilege to
schedule facilities on the Boston
University campus.
It is nonsense for the
administration to pretend that we
must let all organizations recruit
or none; what is human
intelligence for if not to make
distinctions? Would the Placement
Office schedule interviews for a
company that announced its jobs
were open to "whites only"?
Would the Housing Office list
apartments by landlords who
discriminated by race or religion?
Indeed, the University does make
distinctions — in dozens of ways
— some justifiable, others not. But
to speak blithely of an "open
campus" is to distort the truth
and to substitute slogans for
rational thought.
There is enough historical
experience with such slogans to
make us suspicious. The term
"free enterprise" used by the
National Association of
Manufacturers meant freedom for
corporations at the expense of
consumers. The term "freedom of
contract" used by the Supreme
Court in the early part of this
century meant freedom for
employers at the expense of
women and children working 60
hours a week. The term "Open
Door" used by President
McKinley meant freedom for the
United States to despoil China
just as the other great powers had
done. And the term "open
campus" used by John Silber
means freedom for the Marines

and Dow Chemical and Lockheed
Aircraft (all "legally constituted
organizations") to find the
personnel to keep the war and the
military-industrial machine going.
Here is Silber:
"We have made it perfectly
clear that there is no immunity on
this campus from the common
and statutory law of the United
States or the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts. These laws are in
effect, and Boston University will
cooperate in enforcing these
laws."
Respect for Life
Is not respect for human life
more important than respect for
law? Why did not Silber say
instead, telling the Marines to go
elsewhere: "We have made it
perfectly clear that there is no
immunity on this campus from
the laws of humanity, which say,
'Thou Shalt Not Kill'." It is sad
that a university president,
presumably committed to rational
inquiry, should make "respect for
the law" his supreme value. It is a
standard which shows ethical
impoverishment and intellectual
laziness.

The truth is that John Silber
does not believe in an open
campus. It is just that he wants to
be the doorkeeper; he wants to set
the standards for who may use the
University. The pretense of an
open campus is to avoid having to
reveal his standards, because they
are not easily defensible. They are
not moral ones — not standards
based on a concern for human
beings — not when he opens the
campus to the Marines. His
standards are legal ones ("legally
constituted organizations"). If
you are lethal but legal, you will
be welcome at Boston University;
if you are nonviolent but illegal,
the police will be called out to
disperse you violently. Silber's
standard of legality is appropriate,
not for the independent thinker in
a democracy, but for the
obsequious servant of the
overbearing state.

standards are legal ones ("legally
constituted organizations"). If
you are lethal but legal, you will
be welcome at Boston University;

the police will be called out to

standard of legality is appropriate,
not for the independent thinker in
a democracy, but for the
obsequious servant of the
overbearing state.

1972, a demonstration against
Marine Corps recruitment on the
Boston University campus was

portion of a comment on that
event published in the April 12
Boston Phoenix by Howard Zinn,
Professor of Government at
Boston University. John Silber,
referred to, is the president of
that institution.)
John Silber would like to avoid
discussing the Marines.
Philosophers are sometimes
annoyed by the intrusion of facts
into comfortably vacuous
generalizations. He says, "We're
going to operate a free campus
here, so that students who are
interested in acquiring
information on a variety of jobs
may find that information
available on this campus ... I feel
obligated to defend the open
campus policy."
One would think from that
statement by Silber after the
Placement Office events that
students were protesting the
recruitment of Fuller Brush
salesmen, instead of men to burn
huts, kill peasants, invade other
countries. Silber wants us to
forget that, and so he talks
abstractly about the "open
campus." But it is part of rational
inquiry to examine the empirical
contents of concepts. Let's look
at the "open campus":
No Open Campus
The campus is not and never
has been open, so the term is
fraudulent. Not all organizations
are given space to recruit; the very
language of the University Council
statement sets standards for

recruiting — "legally constituted
organizations" from certain fields;
that provides a basis for exclusion.
SDS has lost its privilege to
schedule facilities on the Boston
University campus.
It is nonsense for the
administration to pretend that we
must let all organizations recruit
or none; what is human
intelligence for if not to make
distinctions? Would the Placement
Office schedule interviews for a
company that announced its jobs
were open to "whites only"?
Would the Housing Office list
apartments by landlords who
discriminated by race or religion?
Indeed, the University does make
distinctions — in dozens of ways
— some justifiable, others not. But
to speak blithely of an "open
campus" is to distort the truth
and to substitute slogans for
rational thought.
There is enough historical
experience with such slogans to
make us suspicious. The term
"free enterprise" used by the
National Association of
Manufacturers meant freedom for
corporations at the expense of
consumers. The term "freedom of
contract" used by the Supreme
Court in the early part of this
century meant freedom for
employers at the expense of
women and children working 60
hours a week. The term "Open
Door" used by President
McKinley meant freedom for the
United States to despoil China
just as the other great powers had
done. And the term "open
campus" used by John Silber
means freedom for the Marines

and Dow Chemical and Lockheed
Aircraft (all "legally constituted
organizations") to find the
personnel to keep the war and the
military-industrial machine going.
Here is Silber:
"We have made it perfectly
clear that there is no immunity on
this campus from the common
and statutory law of the United
States or the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts. These laws are in
effect, and Boston University will
cooperate in enforcing these
laws."
Respect for Life
Is not respect for human life
more important than respect for
law? Why did not Silber say
instead, telling the Marines to go
elsewhere: "We have made it
perfectly clear that there is no
immunity on this campus from
the laws of humanity, which say,
'Thou Shalt Not Kill'." It is sad
that a university president,
presumably committed to rational
inquiry, should make "respect for
the law" his supreme value. It is a
standard which shows ethical
impoverishment and intellectual
laziness.

The truth is that John Silber
does not believe in an open
campus. It is just that he wants to
be the doorkeeper; he wants to set
the standards for who may use the
University. The pretense of an
open campus is to avoid having to
reveal his standards, because they
are not easily defensible. They are
not moral ones — not standards
based on a concern for human
beings — not when he opens the
campus to the Marines. His
standards are legal ones ("legally
constituted organizations"). If
you are lethal but legal, you will
be welcome at Boston University;
if you are nonviolent but illegal,
the police will be called out to
disperse you violently. Silber's
standard of legality is appropriate,
