# Memorable Bella Lewitzky Dance Performance
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
The Bella Lewitzky Dance
Company has just completed two
performances at Zellerbach
Auditorium on the U.C. campus.
As artistic director, choreographer
and principal dancer of her own
company, Lewitzky still radiates
youth and an invincible liveliness
despite the advent of middle age.
In fact the quality of her
performance of the choreography
at certain times exceeds that of
her other younger dancers. Her
company is small (it numbers
ten), and one immediately senses
a feeling of intense group
concentration and cooperation
which gives the performance its
particular strength and sustains it
over its weaker sections.
The first piece, "Orrenda",
choreographed by Lewitzky in
1968, is a gay colorful dance
which consists of a series of
intermingling and weaving
gestures which the dancers
perform in bright red, yellow and
blue costumes. It is a visually
pleasing counterpoint of color and
movement. The music provides a
welcomed change from the
electronic music which
accompanies many modern dance
pieces.
The second piece, "On the
Brink of Time", choreographed
by Lewitzky in 1969, with music
by Morton Subotnick, deals with
the sense of suspension in space
and time. The dance opens with
the slow lighting up of four thick
strips of cellophane-like material
hung from the ceiling and placed

at the back and on both sides ol
the stage. Slowly Lewitzky enters
and begins a series of isolated
shoulder and arm movements
which are a tribute to her great
talent for choreography. She
wears a rather ineffective purple
costume which simply does not
work, but the precision and
sensitivity with which she moves
and works with Subotnick's music
overcomes any oversights in
costume.
Towards the middle of the
piece, a strobe light turns on
Lewitzky and we find her dancing
in what seems to be slow motion
in a world which 110 longer
resembles reality. She becomes for
a few moments suspended in
space and time. It was with a
sense of relief and "returning to
earth" that I saw the lights stop
llickering and the dance continue
as before.
The end of the piece is subtle
and powerful. Lewitsky slowly
exits until we can see only her
outstretched hand which she
keeps visible for an eerie length of
time. When she finally exits
completely, we get the sensation
of her having faded into
nothingness. (The musical
arrangement provided some of the
most interesting percussive and
electronic combinations I have
heard yet in a dance
performance.)
Interesting Dance
The third piece, "Pietas",
choreographed by Lewitzky in
1971, was the most interesting

dance of Friday night's
performance. In it, Lewitzky deals
with the potential for movement
in sculptured stone. She
successfully translates the
Rennaissance elements of most
Pieta sculpture into modern terms
through the juxtaposition of
church organ and noog
synthesizer music as well as the
juxtaposition of the staid
positioning of Rennaissance
sculpture with modern dance
movement.
The dancers wear grey, some in
sweat shirts and trousers, some in
painter's overalls, some in skirts
and blouses and others in leotards
and long pants. In the
background, stakes are placed
slanting towards and away from
each other.
Lewitzky's most successful
movement is in those moments
when she gives us the sense that
the dancers are trying to break
out of the limitations imposed
upon their movement by the
stone in which they are
supposedly incarcerated. The
dancers transmit this feeling by
desperately moving their hands
around themselves as if they really
are enclosed in stone.
Also, Lewitzky avoids the
conventional "man supporting

woman syndrome in movement
such as the one in which Rebecca
Bobele, a fine dancer, rocks Fred
Stickler back and forth in her
arms. Lewitzky avoids monotony
through the constant sense of
expectancy which each movement
leaves us. Lewitzky always cuts
her movement off just before it
culminates so that the audience is
never quite fulfilled. The dance
culminates at the end when three
male dancers carry Robele
offstage on their shoulders.
Memorable Evening
In the last piece,
"Kinaesonata", choreographed by
Lewitsky in 1969, the dancers
move to piano music whose
straightforward simplicity well
befits the direct quality of the
choreography.
The dancers wear costumes of
purple, pink and orange on which
are splotches of contrasting
colors. The colors seem to

effectively drip and flow into each
other like liquid.
The dance is divided into four
parts, the third part of which
again shows Lewitzky's
eo 11 si derable choreographical
Uilents. She performs her own
movement in solo and though at
times the movements seem too
prolonged, the dancing on the
whole is exciting and highly
original.
In the fourth part, the whole
com pain dances together. The
most memorable moment is when
the dancers run on and off stage
performing a series of astounding
leaps and turns. This piece echoed
faintly the airiness of "Orrenda",
and thus ended a well-rounded
evening of dance.
Bella Lewitzky's Company is
well worth seeing and should not
be missed when they perform on
the Stanford campus on Thursday
and Friday nights.

"Kinaesonata", choreographed by
Lewitsky in 1969, the dancers
move to piano music whose
straightforward simplicity well
befits the direct quality of the
choreography.
The dancers wear costumes of
purple, pink and orange on which
are splotches of contrasting
colors. The colors seem to

effectively drip and flow into each
other like liquid.
The dance is divided into four
parts, the third part of which
again shows Lewitzky's
eo 11 si derable choreographical
Uilents. She performs her own
movement in solo and though at
times the movements seem too
prolonged, the dancing on the
whole is exciting and highly
original.
In the fourth part, the whole
com pain dances together. The
most memorable moment is when
the dancers run on and off stage
performing a series of astounding
leaps and turns. This piece echoed
faintly the airiness of "Orrenda",
and thus ended a well-rounded
evening of dance.
Bella Lewitzky's Company is
well worth seeing and should not
be missed when they perform on
the Stanford campus on Thursday
and Friday nights.

BELLA LEWITZKY — and her dance company perform Thursday
and Friday nights at 8 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium.
The Bella Lewitzky Dance
Company has just completed two
performances at Zellerbach
Auditorium on the U.C. campus.
As artistic director, choreographer
and principal dancer of her own
company, Lewitzky still radiates
youth and an invincible liveliness
despite the advent of middle age.
In fact the quality of her
performance of the choreography
at certain times exceeds that of
her other younger dancers. Her
company is small (it numbers
ten), and one immediately senses
a feeling of intense group
concentration and cooperation
which gives the performance its
particular strength and sustains it
over its weaker sections.
The first piece, "Orrenda",
choreographed by Lewitzky in
1968, is a gay colorful dance
which consists of a series of
intermingling and weaving
gestures which the dancers
perform in bright red, yellow and
blue costumes. It is a visually
pleasing counterpoint of color and
movement. The music provides a
welcomed change from the
electronic music which
accompanies many modern dance
pieces.
The second piece, "On the
Brink of Time", choreographed
by Lewitzky in 1969, with music
by Morton Subotnick, deals with
the sense of suspension in space
and time. The dance opens with
the slow lighting up of four thick
strips of cellophane-like material
hung from the ceiling and placed

at the back and on both sides ol
the stage. Slowly Lewitzky enters
and begins a series of isolated
shoulder and arm movements
which are a tribute to her great
talent for choreography. She
wears a rather ineffective purple
costume which simply does not
work, but the precision and
sensitivity with which she moves
and works with Subotnick's music
overcomes any oversights in
costume.
Towards the middle of the
piece, a strobe light turns on
Lewitzky and we find her dancing
in what seems to be slow motion
in a world which 110 longer
resembles reality. She becomes for
a few moments suspended in
space and time. It was with a
sense of relief and "returning to
earth" that I saw the lights stop
llickering and the dance continue
as before.
The end of the piece is subtle
and powerful. Lewitsky slowly
exits until we can see only her
outstretched hand which she
keeps visible for an eerie length of
time. When she finally exits
completely, we get the sensation
of her having faded into
nothingness. (The musical
arrangement provided some of the
most interesting percussive and
electronic combinations I have
heard yet in a dance
performance.)
Interesting Dance
The third piece, "Pietas",
choreographed by Lewitzky in
1971, was the most interesting

dance of Friday night's
performance. In it, Lewitzky deals
with the potential for movement
in sculptured stone. She
successfully translates the
Rennaissance elements of most
Pieta sculpture into modern terms
through the juxtaposition of
church organ and noog
synthesizer music as well as the
juxtaposition of the staid
positioning of Rennaissance
sculpture with modern dance
movement.
The dancers wear grey, some in
sweat shirts and trousers, some in
painter's overalls, some in skirts
and blouses and others in leotards
and long pants. In the
background, stakes are placed
slanting towards and away from
each other.
Lewitzky's most successful
movement is in those moments
when she gives us the sense that
the dancers are trying to break
out of the limitations imposed
upon their movement by the
stone in which they are
supposedly incarcerated. The
dancers transmit this feeling by
desperately moving their hands
around themselves as if they really
are enclosed in stone.
Also, Lewitzky avoids the
conventional "man supporting

woman syndrome in movement
such as the one in which Rebecca
Bobele, a fine dancer, rocks Fred
Stickler back and forth in her
arms. Lewitzky avoids monotony
through the constant sense of
expectancy which each movement
leaves us. Lewitzky always cuts
her movement off just before it
culminates so that the audience is
never quite fulfilled. The dance
culminates at the end when three
male dancers carry Robele
offstage on their shoulders.

positioning of Rennaissance
sculpture with modern dance
movement.
The dancers wear grey, some in
sweat shirts and trousers, some in
painter's overalls, some in skirts
and blouses and others in leotards
and long pants. In the
background, stakes are placed
slanting towards and away from
each other.
Lewitzky's most successful
movement is in those moments
when she gives us the sense that
the dancers are trying to break
out of the limitations imposed
upon their movement by the
stone in which they are
supposedly incarcerated. The
dancers transmit this feeling by
desperately moving their hands
around themselves as if they really
are enclosed in stone.
Also, Lewitzky avoids the
conventional "man supporting

woman syndrome in movement
such as the one in which Rebecca
Bobele, a fine dancer, rocks Fred
Stickler back and forth in her
arms. Lewitzky avoids monotony
through the constant sense of
expectancy which each movement
leaves us. Lewitzky always cuts
her movement off just before it
culminates so that the audience is
never quite fulfilled. The dance
culminates at the end when three
male dancers carry Robele
offstage on their shoulders.
Memorable Evening
In the last piece,
"Kinaesonata", choreographed by
Lewitsky in 1969, the dancers
move to piano music whose
straightforward simplicity well
befits the direct quality of the
choreography.
The dancers wear costumes of
purple, pink and orange on which
are splotches of contrasting
colors. The colors seem to

effectively drip and flow into each
other like liquid.
The dance is divided into four
parts, the third part of which
again shows Lewitzky's
eo 11 si derable choreographical
Uilents. She performs her own
movement in solo and though at
times the movements seem too
prolonged, the dancing on the
whole is exciting and highly
original.
In the fourth part, the whole
com pain dances together. The
most memorable moment is when
the dancers run on and off stage
performing a series of astounding
leaps and turns. This piece echoed
faintly the airiness of "Orrenda",
and thus ended a well-rounded
evening of dance.
Bella Lewitzky's Company is
well worth seeing and should not
be missed when they perform on
the Stanford campus on Thursday
and Friday nights.

BELLA LEWITZKY — and her dance company perform Thursday
and Friday nights at 8 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium.
The Bella Lewitzky Dance
Company has just completed two
performances at Zellerbach
Auditorium on the U.C. campus.
As artistic director, choreographer
and principal dancer of her own
company, Lewitzky still radiates
youth and an invincible liveliness
despite the advent of middle age.
In fact the quality of her
performance of the choreography
at certain times exceeds that of
her other younger dancers. Her
company is small (it numbers
ten), and one immediately senses
a feeling of intense group
concentration and cooperation
which gives the performance its
particular strength and sustains it
over its weaker sections.
The first piece, "Orrenda",
choreographed by Lewitzky in
1968, is a gay colorful dance
which consists of a series of
intermingling and weaving
gestures which the dancers
perform in bright red, yellow and
blue costumes. It is a visually
pleasing counterpoint of color and
movement. The music provides a
welcomed change from the
electronic music which
accompanies many modern dance
pieces.
The second piece, "On the
Brink of Time", choreographed
by Lewitzky in 1969, with music
by Morton Subotnick, deals with
the sense of suspension in space
and time. The dance opens with
the slow lighting up of four thick
strips of cellophane-like material
hung from the ceiling and placed

at the back and on both sides ol
the stage. Slowly Lewitzky enters
and begins a series of isolated
shoulder and arm movements
which are a tribute to her great
talent for choreography. She
wears a rather ineffective purple
costume which simply does not
work, but the precision and
sensitivity with which she moves
and works with Subotnick's music
overcomes any oversights in
costume.
Towards the middle of the
piece, a strobe light turns on
Lewitzky and we find her dancing
in what seems to be slow motion
in a world which 110 longer
resembles reality. She becomes for
a few moments suspended in
space and time. It was with a
sense of relief and "returning to
earth" that I saw the lights stop
llickering and the dance continue
as before.
The end of the piece is subtle
and powerful. Lewitsky slowly
exits until we can see only her
outstretched hand which she
keeps visible for an eerie length of
time. When she finally exits
completely, we get the sensation
of her having faded into
nothingness. (The musical
arrangement provided some of the
most interesting percussive and
electronic combinations I have
heard yet in a dance
performance.)
Interesting Dance
The third piece, "Pietas",
choreographed by Lewitzky in
1971, was the most interesting

dance of Friday night's
performance. In it, Lewitzky deals
with the potential for movement
in sculptured stone. She
successfully translates the
Rennaissance elements of most
Pieta sculpture into modern terms
through the juxtaposition of
church organ and noog
synthesizer music as well as the
juxtaposition of the staid
positioning of Rennaissance
sculpture with modern dance
movement.
The dancers wear grey, some in
sweat shirts and trousers, some in
painter's overalls, some in skirts
and blouses and others in leotards
and long pants. In the
background, stakes are placed
slanting towards and away from
each other.
