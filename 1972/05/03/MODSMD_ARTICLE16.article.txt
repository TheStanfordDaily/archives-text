# Excellent 'Hired Hand'
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Whether intended or not, the
double bill of "The Last Movie"
and"The Hired Hand" at the
Aquarius represents the total
output of the prime movers of
"Easy Rider," that film which, in
1969, was heralded as the savior
of the industry but which in fact
spawned innumerable cheap and
amateurish imitations from which
we are only now recovering. As
justice would have it, Dennis
Hopper's much publicized
exercise in self-indulgence has
quietly laid one of the biggest
eggs in show business, while in
Peter Fonda's restrained and
deeply felt directorial debut is to
be found the best film yet made
by anyone to have emerged from
the Roger Corman-AIP training
ground.
"The Hired Hand," though
spotted with flaws, is actually a
near-masterpiece. The best words
I can think of to describe it are
noble and honorable, with no
Antony irony intended. The only
really memorable westerns of
recent years, those of Leone and
Peckinpah, have celebrated
violence and if any real code has
been expressed,it has been that of
fringe element renegades who, in
their expiring moments, chose to
band together to make a last stand

against the inevitable forces of
society and history.
Fonda's vision resembles more
than anything that of John Ford,
especially the latter's greatest
western, "My Darling
Clementine," which starred Henry
Fonda. Friendship, principle and a
man's word are valued above
everything and the virtues of hard
work and a solid family life are
beyond reproach. As often
happens in Ford, a physical and
time consuming defense of one's
moral standards must be made
before the basic needs of family
can be tended to and this defense
can easily end in tragedy,
preventing forever the cultivation
of what one cares for most deeply
of all. In the face of all the
large-scale slaughter in many
westerns, "The Hired Hand"
reminds us, if nothing else, that
even in the Old West, one life
could make a difference.
Alan Sharp's brilliant
screenplay manages to convey a
double-edged point of view on
one story with perfect balance
and subtlety. Peter Fonda and
Warren Oates have been traversing
the West together for close to
seven years, before which Fonda
had established a small farm with
his wife and infant daughter. The
friendship between the two men is
calm, subtle and flexible but the
bond between them absolute and
unbreakable.
Fonda finally decides to return
home and it is with great initial
unwillingness that his wife allows
him to remain even as a hired
hand. The ice melts very slowly
and it is in this middle section of
the film that Fonda's talent
flowers most surprisingly, for he
manages to catch every nuance of
moral tension and emotional
reawakening in a couple

discovering each other for the
second time.
"The Hired Hand" may be the
first film to profoundly and
sympathetically examine the
woman's role in the pioneer West.
Though the nature of the couple's
life seven years earlier is never
explicitly discussed, a whole
history can be discerned of a
woman who knew she was taking
a great risk by settling in the West
but once the decision had been
made, the commitment to her
husband and new life was total
and irrevocable.
Direct Acting
When her husband left her,
everything to which she had
committed herself vanished in an
instant and in one scene in which
she anguishes alone in bed at
daybreak over the difficulty of
renewing her commitments,
every tear speaks volumes about
the pain she has suffered during
seven years of loneliness. In this
role, Vema Bloom is simple,
direct, wholly believable and all
the better for being unspectacular
and unactressy.
Warren Oates has already
proven he can portray prairie
scum better than anyone this side
of Strother Martin and here he
gives a performance of seemingly
endless inner warmth. Given that
his principal role is that of a best
friend to Fonda, the tacit
understanding he conveys of his
companion's predicament speaks
of countless past conversations
and shared experiences. In the
bedtime chats he shares with
Fonda after their return to the
small ranch, he listens flawlessly.
Fonda has since confessed that
he would have prefered not acting
in his directorial debut (he did so
for supposed box-office reasons)
and I can't but agree with his

feelings. Compared with Bloom
and Oates, Fonda comes across as
a humble, well-meaning weakling.
The supporting players,
particularly the baddies, are also a
shade too New Hollywood, their
speech patterns too culculatedly
sloppy and their hair too artfully
disarranged.
The cinematography is
noticeably the work of Vilmos
Zsigmond, invaluable contributor
to "McCabe and Mrs. Miller." I
could have done without quite so
many psychedelic montages (both
Fonda and Hopper seem obsessed
with eye-opening transitional
devices) but once again,
Zsigmond's work creates a
resonant distance between the
viewer and the poignant events of
the story which helps create
immediate historical
reverberations.

Dennis Hopper's "The Last
Movie" isn't as bad as everyone
has said it is, but almost. He seems
to be trying to say something
about fact versus fiction and the
nature of art but if you've seen
him on any of the talk shows, you
have some idea how clearly he
articulates his thoughts. Dennis
isn't one of our heavier thinkers.
What "The Last Movie" does
have in some measure is charm.
Veteran Samuel Fuller, wearing
his confederate commander's hat,
is hilarious to watch directing the
ultimate in shoot-'em-up westerns,
Edie Adams is marvellous as a
middle-aged p.t. and even Hopper
himself stumbles across some nice
moments of comic timing.
For lack of much else to do,
it's also amusing to watch the
Dennis Hopper Hit Parade of Hip
Friends — quick, there's Peter
Fonda getting shot, oh, there's
Michelle Phillips, isn't that John
Phillip Law, I could swear that's
Kris Kristofferson, my God, Russ
Tamblyn? Would that Hopper had
relied even more on behavioral
charm and less on his pretentious
notions about what he thinks is
art.

"Easy Rider," that film which, in
1969, was heralded as the savior
of the industry but which in fact
spawned innumerable cheap and
amateurish imitations from which
we are only now recovering. As
justice would have it, Dennis
Hopper's much publicized
exercise in self-indulgence has
quietly laid one of the biggest
eggs in show business, while in
Peter Fonda's restrained and
deeply felt directorial debut is to
be found the best film yet made
by anyone to have emerged from
the Roger Corman-AIP training
ground.
"The Hired Hand," though
spotted with flaws, is actually a
near-masterpiece. The best words
I can think of to describe it are
noble and honorable, with no
Antony irony intended. The only
really memorable westerns of
recent years, those of Leone and
Peckinpah, have celebrated
violence and if any real code has
been expressed,it has been that of
fringe element renegades who, in
their expiring moments, chose to
band together to make a last stand

against the inevitable forces of
society and history.
Fonda's vision resembles more
than anything that of John Ford,
especially the latter's greatest
western, "My Darling
Clementine," which starred Henry
Fonda. Friendship, principle and a
man's word are valued above
everything and the virtues of hard
work and a solid family life are
beyond reproach. As often
happens in Ford, a physical and
time consuming defense of one's
moral standards must be made
before the basic needs of family
can be tended to and this defense
can easily end in tragedy,
preventing forever the cultivation
of what one cares for most deeply
of all. In the face of all the
large-scale slaughter in many
westerns, "The Hired Hand"
reminds us, if nothing else, that
even in the Old West, one life
could make a difference.
Alan Sharp's brilliant
screenplay manages to convey a
double-edged point of view on
one story with perfect balance
and subtlety. Peter Fonda and
Warren Oates have been traversing
the West together for close to
seven years, before which Fonda
had established a small farm with
his wife and infant daughter. The
friendship between the two men is
calm, subtle and flexible but the
bond between them absolute and
unbreakable.
Fonda finally decides to return
home and it is with great initial
unwillingness that his wife allows
him to remain even as a hired
hand. The ice melts very slowly
and it is in this middle section of
the film that Fonda's talent
flowers most surprisingly, for he
manages to catch every nuance of
moral tension and emotional
reawakening in a couple

discovering each other for the
second time.
"The Hired Hand" may be the
first film to profoundly and
sympathetically examine the
woman's role in the pioneer West.
Though the nature of the couple's
life seven years earlier is never
explicitly discussed, a whole
history can be discerned of a
woman who knew she was taking
a great risk by settling in the West
but once the decision had been
made, the commitment to her
husband and new life was total
and irrevocable.
Direct Acting
When her husband left her,
everything to which she had
committed herself vanished in an
instant and in one scene in which
she anguishes alone in bed at
daybreak over the difficulty of
renewing her commitments,
every tear speaks volumes about
the pain she has suffered during
seven years of loneliness. In this
role, Vema Bloom is simple,
direct, wholly believable and all
the better for being unspectacular
and unactressy.
Warren Oates has already
proven he can portray prairie
scum better than anyone this side
of Strother Martin and here he
gives a performance of seemingly
endless inner warmth. Given that
his principal role is that of a best
friend to Fonda, the tacit
understanding he conveys of his
companion's predicament speaks
of countless past conversations
and shared experiences. In the
bedtime chats he shares with
Fonda after their return to the
small ranch, he listens flawlessly.
Fonda has since confessed that
he would have prefered not acting
in his directorial debut (he did so
for supposed box-office reasons)
and I can't but agree with his

feelings. Compared with Bloom
and Oates, Fonda comes across as
a humble, well-meaning weakling.
The supporting players,
particularly the baddies, are also a
shade too New Hollywood, their
speech patterns too culculatedly
sloppy and their hair too artfully
disarranged.
The cinematography is
noticeably the work of Vilmos
Zsigmond, invaluable contributor
to "McCabe and Mrs. Miller." I
could have done without quite so
many psychedelic montages (both
Fonda and Hopper seem obsessed
with eye-opening transitional
devices) but once again,
Zsigmond's work creates a
resonant distance between the
viewer and the poignant events of
the story which helps create
immediate historical
reverberations.

Dennis Hopper's "The Last
Movie" isn't as bad as everyone
has said it is, but almost. He seems
to be trying to say something
about fact versus fiction and the
nature of art but if you've seen
him on any of the talk shows, you
have some idea how clearly he
articulates his thoughts. Dennis
isn't one of our heavier thinkers.
What "The Last Movie" does
have in some measure is charm.
Veteran Samuel Fuller, wearing
his confederate commander's hat,
is hilarious to watch directing the
ultimate in shoot-'em-up westerns,
Edie Adams is marvellous as a
middle-aged p.t. and even Hopper
himself stumbles across some nice
moments of comic timing.
For lack of much else to do,
it's also amusing to watch the
Dennis Hopper Hit Parade of Hip
Friends — quick, there's Peter
Fonda getting shot, oh, there's
Michelle Phillips, isn't that John
Phillip Law, I could swear that's
Kris Kristofferson, my God, Russ
Tamblyn? Would that Hopper had
relied even more on behavioral

art.

we are only now recovering. As
justice would have it, Dennis
Hopper's much publicized
exercise in self-indulgence has
quietly laid one of the biggest
eggs in show business, while in
Peter Fonda's restrained and
deeply felt directorial debut is to
be found the best film yet made
by anyone to have emerged from
the Roger Corman-AIP training
ground.
"The Hired Hand," though
spotted with flaws, is actually a
near-masterpiece. The best words
I can think of to describe it are
noble and honorable, with no
Antony irony intended. The only
really memorable westerns of
recent years, those of Leone and
Peckinpah, have celebrated
violence and if any real code has
been expressed,it has been that of
fringe element renegades who, in
their expiring moments, chose to
band together to make a last stand

against the inevitable forces of
society and history.
Fonda's vision resembles more
than anything that of John Ford,
especially the latter's greatest
western, "My Darling
Clementine," which starred Henry
Fonda. Friendship, principle and a
man's word are valued above
everything and the virtues of hard
work and a solid family life are
beyond reproach. As often
happens in Ford, a physical and
time consuming defense of one's
moral standards must be made
before the basic needs of family
can be tended to and this defense
can easily end in tragedy,
preventing forever the cultivation
of what one cares for most deeply
of all. In the face of all the
large-scale slaughter in many
westerns, "The Hired Hand"
reminds us, if nothing else, that
even in the Old West, one life
could make a difference.
Alan Sharp's brilliant
screenplay manages to convey a
double-edged point of view on
one story with perfect balance
and subtlety. Peter Fonda and
Warren Oates have been traversing
the West together for close to
seven years, before which Fonda
had established a small farm with
his wife and infant daughter. The
friendship between the two men is
calm, subtle and flexible but the
bond between them absolute and
unbreakable.
Fonda finally decides to return
home and it is with great initial
unwillingness that his wife allows
him to remain even as a hired
hand. The ice melts very slowly
and it is in this middle section of
the film that Fonda's talent
flowers most surprisingly, for he
manages to catch every nuance of
moral tension and emotional
reawakening in a couple

discovering each other for the
second time.
"The Hired Hand" may be the
first film to profoundly and
sympathetically examine the
woman's role in the pioneer West.
Though the nature of the couple's
life seven years earlier is never
explicitly discussed, a whole
history can be discerned of a
woman who knew she was taking
a great risk by settling in the West
but once the decision had been
made, the commitment to her
husband and new life was total
and irrevocable.
Direct Acting
When her husband left her,
everything to which she had
committed herself vanished in an
instant and in one scene in which
she anguishes alone in bed at
daybreak over the difficulty of
renewing her commitments,
every tear speaks volumes about
the pain she has suffered during
seven years of loneliness. In this
role, Vema Bloom is simple,
direct, wholly believable and all
the better for being unspectacular
and unactressy.
Warren Oates has already
proven he can portray prairie
scum better than anyone this side
of Strother Martin and here he
gives a performance of seemingly
endless inner warmth. Given that
his principal role is that of a best
friend to Fonda, the tacit
understanding he conveys of his
companion's predicament speaks
of countless past conversations
and shared experiences. In the
bedtime chats he shares with
Fonda after their return to the
small ranch, he listens flawlessly.
Fonda has since confessed that
he would have prefered not acting
in his directorial debut (he did so
for supposed box-office reasons)
and I can't but agree with his

feelings. Compared with Bloom
and Oates, Fonda comes across as
a humble, well-meaning weakling.
The supporting players,
particularly the baddies, are also a
shade too New Hollywood, their
speech patterns too culculatedly
sloppy and their hair too artfully
disarranged.
The cinematography is
noticeably the work of Vilmos
Zsigmond, invaluable contributor
to "McCabe and Mrs. Miller." I
could have done without quite so
many psychedelic montages (both
Fonda and Hopper seem obsessed
with eye-opening transitional
devices) but once again,
Zsigmond's work creates a
resonant distance between the
viewer and the poignant events of
the story which helps create
immediate historical
reverberations.

Dennis Hopper's "The Last
Movie" isn't as bad as everyone
has said it is, but almost. He seems
to be trying to say something
about fact versus fiction and the
nature of art but if you've seen
him on any of the talk shows, you
have some idea how clearly he
articulates his thoughts. Dennis
isn't one of our heavier thinkers.
What "The Last Movie" does
have in some measure is charm.
Veteran Samuel Fuller, wearing
his confederate commander's hat,
is hilarious to watch directing the
ultimate in shoot-'em-up westerns,
Edie Adams is marvellous as a
middle-aged p.t. and even Hopper
himself stumbles across some nice
moments of comic timing.
For lack of much else to do,
it's also amusing to watch the
Dennis Hopper Hit Parade of Hip
Friends — quick, there's Peter
Fonda getting shot, oh, there's
Michelle Phillips, isn't that John
Phillip Law, I could swear that's
Kris Kristofferson, my God, Russ
Tamblyn? Would that Hopper had
relied even more on behavioral
charm and less on his pretentious
notions about what he thinks is
art.
Whether intended or not, the
double bill of "The Last Movie"
and"The Hired Hand" at the
Aquarius represents the total
output of the prime movers of
"Easy Rider," that film which, in
1969, was heralded as the savior
of the industry but which in fact
spawned innumerable cheap and
amateurish imitations from which
we are only now recovering. As
