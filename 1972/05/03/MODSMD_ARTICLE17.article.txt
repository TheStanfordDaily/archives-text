# Laxmen Lose To Oakland
## 
### 
The Stanford lacrosse team
suffered its second straight loss of
the season by falling to the
Oakland Lacrosse Club 15-9 last
Sunday. Oakland took an early
6-0 lead and then the Stanford
effort was not enough to catch
them.
Stanford appeared flat in the
first period missing on several
scoring opportunities and failing
to keep the Oakland offense in
check. The Stanford defense
played very loosely allowing Bob
Burns, all Northern California
player from Oakland to tally three
times in the first half. Burns
ended the game with four goals
and one assist.

For Stanford the day was one
of disappointment despite Senior
Attack man Chip Loveman's finest
game of the season. Loveman
scored three goals and had three
assists as he continually dazzled
the Oakland goalie.
This game high for Loveman
will place him high in the league
All-Star voting which begins next
week. Although small in size,
Loveman has been the consistent
play-maker for the Stanford
offense all season long.
Stanford did close the gap at
10-8 and appeared ready to
overtake the Oakland team when
they lapsed into loose ball play
that cost them several penalty
situations and allowed Oakland to
score twice more and then pull
away for the eventual 15-9 win.
This was the second high score
against Stanford this season and
came unexpectedly from the
Oakland team. Oaklan.d is battling
for a play-off berth in the
Northern standings against
California. This was the first time
in Oakland history that they beat
a Stanford team.
Stanford moves into a
double-homestand this weekend.

On Saturday Stanford will play
Claremont—a team they just
barely beat last year iji Los
Angeles.
On Sunday Stanford has its
rematch with the Palo Alto
Lacrosse Club in a game starting
at 1:00 p.m. on the Stanford
lacrosse field. Stanford will want
to win the Sunday game to avenge
an earlier 11-8 loss to Palo Alto.
