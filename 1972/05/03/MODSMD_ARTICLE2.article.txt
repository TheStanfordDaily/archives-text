# Humphrey Holds Slight Ohio Edge
## 
### JIM WASCHER BOB BACON 
Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D.-Minn.)
won a narrow victory over Alabama
Gov. George Wallace in the Indiana
presidential primary election yester
day.
Humphrey held a narrow lead early
this morning over Sen. George McGov
ern (D.-S.D.) in early returns in a very
slow count in the Ohio primary.
Washington Sen. Henry Jackson,
who had staked his conservative bid
for the Democratic nomination on his
showing in Ohio, dropped out of
remaining primaries after running far
back in the field.
In the all-important delegate con
tests, incomplete Indiana returns gave
Humphrey 54 first ballot convention
votes, and Wallace 22. Very early Ohio
returns gave Humphrey 68 delegates
and McGovem 44.
Indiana voters gave Humphrey 46
percent of their ballots, Wallace 42

percent, and Maine Sen. Edmund
Muskie, who has quit actively cam
paigning but who remained on the
ballot, 12 percent.
A partial count in Ohio gave
Humphrey 41 percent, McGovem 38
percent, Muskie 10 percent, and
Jackson 8 percent. Quixotic poet
politician Eugene McCarthy brought
up the rear of the five-man field.
Other Primaries
Two other states held primaries
yesterday. In Alabama, pro-Wallace
delegate slates defeated anti-Wallace
candidates in 20 of 27 districts. In the
District of Columbia, a slate pledged
to favorite son Congressional delegate
Walter Fauntroy easily defeated an
anti-Fauntroy slate.
The close verdicts in yesterday's
two major contests did little to clarify
the Democratic presidential picture. It
remains largely a two-man contest
between Humphrey and the fast-rising
McGovem, with Wallace an unknown

factor.
Tennessee holds its primary tomor
row, and North Carolina on Saturday.
Wallace is favored in both of these
states.
Next Tuesday, the primary trail
moves to West Virginia, where Hum
phrey and Wallace meet face-to-face,
as they did in Indiana.
President Nixon ran unopposed in
both Ohio and Indiana.
No Victory Claim
Humphrey, in Cleveland, made no
outright claim of victory. He expressed
concern about the large protest vote
given to Wallace.
Observers said large numbers of
Republicans in Indiana had crossed
over to cast ballots for the southerner.
Wallace's performance in Indiana
rivals his total in the 1964 Maryland
Democratic primary, when he received
42 percent of the vote against Gov.
Daniel Brewster, a stand-in for Presi
dent Lyndon Johnson. His Indiana
vote is certainly the largest he has ever
received in any northern state's pri
mary, and is eight percent greater than
his 1964 showing in Indiana.
Considering that 19 of the 49
delegates won by Humphrey in India
na were gained because he was the
statewide vote leader, Wallace's total
of 22 delegates was a quite impressive
demonstration of support at the local
level.
The Alabama Governor now has
121 delegate votes, having received 75
of those in his March 14 Florida
primary victory. Political analysts
expect that Wallace will carry up to
350 delegates with him into the
Democratic National Convention in
early -July. This week's primaries in
Tennessee and North Carolina will be

key determinants of his strength in the
South.
Until Midnight
Although polls across most of Ohio
closed at 6:30 p.m. (EDT), voters in
Cuyahoga County, which includes
Cleveland, were allowed by a Federal
court ruling to cast ballots until 11:59
p.m.
Supporters of Humphrey had asked
a federal judge in Cleveland to order
the extension after voting machine
troubles and delays in opening polling
places. The Ohio count was further
delayed by a long and complex ballot.

anti-Fauntroy slate.
The close verdicts in yesterday's
two major contests did little to clarify
the Democratic presidential picture. It
remains largely a two-man contest
between Humphrey and the fast-rising
McGovem, with Wallace an unknown

factor.
Tennessee holds its primary tomor
row, and North Carolina on Saturday.
Wallace is favored in both of these
states.
Next Tuesday, the primary trail
moves to West Virginia, where Hum
phrey and Wallace meet face-to-face,
as they did in Indiana.
President Nixon ran unopposed in
both Ohio and Indiana.
No Victory Claim
Humphrey, in Cleveland, made no
outright claim of victory. He expressed
concern about the large protest vote
given to Wallace.
Observers said large numbers of
Republicans in Indiana had crossed
over to cast ballots for the southerner.
Wallace's performance in Indiana
rivals his total in the 1964 Maryland
Democratic primary, when he received
42 percent of the vote against Gov.
Daniel Brewster, a stand-in for Presi
dent Lyndon Johnson. His Indiana
vote is certainly the largest he has ever
received in any northern state's pri
mary, and is eight percent greater than
his 1964 showing in Indiana.
Considering that 19 of the 49
delegates won by Humphrey in India
na were gained because he was the
statewide vote leader, Wallace's total
of 22 delegates was a quite impressive
demonstration of support at the local
level.
The Alabama Governor now has
121 delegate votes, having received 75
of those in his March 14 Florida
primary victory. Political analysts
expect that Wallace will carry up to
350 delegates with him into the
Democratic National Convention in
early -July. This week's primaries in
Tennessee and North Carolina will be

key determinants of his strength in the
South.
Until Midnight
Although polls across most of Ohio
closed at 6:30 p.m. (EDT), voters in
Cuyahoga County, which includes
Cleveland, were allowed by a Federal
court ruling to cast ballots until 11:59
p.m.
Supporters of Humphrey had asked
a federal judge in Cleveland to order
the extension after voting machine
troubles and delays in opening polling
places. The Ohio count was further
delayed by a long and complex ballot.
Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D.-Minn.)
won a narrow victory over Alabama
Gov. George Wallace in the Indiana
presidential primary election yester
day.
Humphrey held a narrow lead early
this morning over Sen. George McGov
ern (D.-S.D.) in early returns in a very
slow count in the Ohio primary.
Washington Sen. Henry Jackson,
who had staked his conservative bid
for the Democratic nomination on his
showing in Ohio, dropped out of
remaining primaries after running far
back in the field.
In the all-important delegate con
tests, incomplete Indiana returns gave
Humphrey 54 first ballot convention
votes, and Wallace 22. Very early Ohio
returns gave Humphrey 68 delegates
and McGovem 44.
Indiana voters gave Humphrey 46
percent of their ballots, Wallace 42

percent, and Maine Sen. Edmund
Muskie, who has quit actively cam
paigning but who remained on the
ballot, 12 percent.
A partial count in Ohio gave
Humphrey 41 percent, McGovem 38
percent, Muskie 10 percent, and
Jackson 8 percent. Quixotic poet
politician Eugene McCarthy brought
up the rear of the five-man field.
Other Primaries
Two other states held primaries
yesterday. In Alabama, pro-Wallace
delegate slates defeated anti-Wallace
candidates in 20 of 27 districts. In the
District of Columbia, a slate pledged
to favorite son Congressional delegate
Walter Fauntroy easily defeated an
anti-Fauntroy slate.
