# Sailing Fourth In Shields Regatta
## 
### 
In yachting action last
weekend off Angel Island, the
Stanford Sailing team posted four
firsts in four races on Saturday,
while managing a disappointing
fourth place overall on Sunday.
U.C. Berkeley, headed by
Skipper Steve Harris, after losing
to Stanford skipper Walt
Mintkeski in every race on
Saturday, managed to reverse the
Stanford domination and win the
Stanford Invitational Shields
Regatta. The final point totals for
Sunday were: UCB 27, U.C. Irvine
24, Claremont 23, Stanford 22,
California Maritime Academy 19,
UCLA 16, and UC Santa Cruz 8.
While on Saturday the
Southern California schools
fought at Monterey for the right
to vie for the Shields title in the
finals on Sunday, Stanford ruled
the Northern California
eliminations on San Francisco
Bay.
Skipper Mintkeski, never in the
lead at the starting gun, managed
to push his craft past all others in
the spinnaker legs of the course
and finish first. An elated
Mintkeski commented after the
race "I really felt that I could

make my boat move today. Of
course I owe a lot to my crew.
They did a great job, particularly
on those spinnaker legs."
Sunday started off on an
ominous note for Stanford and
never got any better as the day
wore on. In the midst of Opening
Day Ceremonies on S.F. Bay, with
the Bay churned up by hundredsof
Sunday boaters, Stanford lost a
crewman overboard and had to
anchor in the dying winds to last
out the strong tides â€” all before
the racing started.
When the races finally got
underway, Stanford fouled their
spinnaker twice on the leeward
leg, previously the part of the
course they had gained the most
ground.
Though disappointed, the
Shields racers, did ace out
Berkeley earlier in the season to
capture the N.C.I.Y.R.A. Shields
crown and look forward to
capturing the all California title
next year. The Flying Dutchman
Junior yachting squad, 1972
N.C.I.Y.R.A. F.J. champs, is
currently in training for the F.J.
finals later this quarter at Santa
Cruz.
