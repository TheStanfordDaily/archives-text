GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP — Stanford's top-ranked women's tennis
player, Tracy MacNair, is seen in one of the four doubles matches she
and her partner, Andrea Barnes, won on the way to the Intercollegiate
Doubles Championship in last weekend's Ojai Valley Tennis
Tournament. On their way to the title, the two freshmen members of
Stanford's undefeated women's team beat doubles teams from
Whittier, Fresno State, UCLA and Arizona State. At the tournament,
MacNair was presented with the Southern California Tennis
Association's 1972 Junior Sportsmaship Award.
