J. Hoover Dies
WASHINGTON - J. Edgar Hoover,
the legendary head of the FBI for 48
years, is dead at 77. President Nixon
ii'd the nation in tribute and mourn
ing.
Death came to the bachelor Hoover
sometime Monday night or early
yesterday morning at his home where
he lived with a housekeeper on the
edge of Rock Creek Park in the
northwest section of this, his native
city. His body was found by a maid at
about 5:30 a.m. PST on the floor near
his bed.
His passing was announced "with
profound personal grief" by Richard
G. Kleindienst, the acting attorney
general.
Dr. James L. Duke, coroner for the
District of Columbia, attributed the
death to "hypertensive cardiovascular
disease," an ailment associated with
high blood pressure. A heart attack
might have been the direct cause, he
said. He added that an autopsy was
not indicated, because death was due
to natural causes.
Funeral arrangements were incom
plete but the House quickly passed a
resolution calling for the body to lie
in state in the Capitol rotunda.
As the director of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation since 1924,
Hoover built a unique an tic rime force
noted for its pinpoint discipline and
freedom from corruption.
President Nixon called Hoover a
"truely remarkable man," who served
eight presidents with "unparalleled
devotion to duty and dedication."
And he ordered flags at all public
buildings and installations lowered to
half staff.
Clyde A. Tolson, No. 2 man at the
FBI and Hoover's closest friend,
became the acting director. The
elevation most likely is temporary.
Like Hoover, who was kept on by a
number of presidents, Tolson is past
the usual retirement age of 70 for
government employees. He will be 72
May 22 and his health is poor.
Speculation about a premanent suc
cessor has centered, variously, on
Justice Byron R. White of the
Supreme Court; Robert C. Mardian,
recent head of the Internal Security
Division of the Justice Department;
the District of Columbia police chief,
Jerry V. Wilson; and Los Angeles
County Sheriff Peter Pitchess.
Yippie leader Jerry Rubin issued a
statement in Norman, Okla., saying:
"Wow! He was punished by God for
his crimes against the people of the
United States. I have information that
he was poisoned by hippie agents
within the FBI."
Davis lie-ins Testimony
SAN JOSE — Angela Davis took the

stand for the first time at her trial
yesterday and swore she shared a
confidential relationship with convict
George Jackson's attorney ~ a move
to keep the attorney from testifying
against her.
She succeeded in convincing the
judge such a relationship did exist, but
the judge ruled attorney John Thome
could testify anyway with the court
ruling on each question.
The state had argued that the
attorney-client privilege does not cover
every conversation — and particularly
a telephone call they want Thome to
testify about. The prosecution says
that says that conversation would tie
Davis more tightly to the crimes of
murder, kidnap and conspiracy with
which she is charged.
Prosecutor Albert Harris Jr. said
Thome, who has protested vigorously
against taking the stand, would be
asked to testify he received a phone
call from Davis less than 40 hours
before the violence. In the call, said
Harris, Davis reported she was in San
Jose on her way to Santa Cruz along
with Jackson's brother, Jonathan, 17,
subsequently slain in the shootout.
Such testimoney would place Davis
with young Jackson just after the two
allegedly bought a shotgun which was
later sawed off and used to kill a
judge. It has been reported that the
state will seek to show the gun was
sawed off at Santa Cruz the night the
phone call was made.
Death Penalty Rejected
SACRAMENTO - The Senate
rejected a constitutional amendment
to restore the death penalty in
California on a 25-13 vote yesterday,
two votes short of the two-thirds
majority needed.
Calley Appeals
WASHINGTON - An appeal for
Lt. William L. Calley Jr. claims that
"only the rankest form of victor's
hypocrisy and command control" has
prevented Gen. William Westmoreland
from being tried in connection with
the My Lai massacre.
The charge was contained in a
461-page brief filed by Calley's law
yers in the Court of Military Appeals.
The appeal claims there were 31
errors in the 4 ! /2-month trial that
convicted Calley last year of the
murder of at least 22 civilians in the
South Vietnamese hamlet, and asks
that the verdict and the sentence be
set aside and charges dismissed. It also
said Westmoreland had responsibility
for My Lai as a result of the Yamashita
case after World War II when that
Japanese commander was convicted
for misdeeds by subordinates.
The Army has 30 days to answer
the Calley appeal, but, in such cases,
extensions are given freely.
