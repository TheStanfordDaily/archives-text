# Officials Optimistic On Hiring
## 
### EMMA PRICE (Second of three parts) 
University officials are optimistic
about present and future implementa
tion of the Affirmative Action pro
gram for women, despite unimpressive
current statistics on female employ
ment here.
The Health, Education, and Welfare
Department (HEW) will investigate
Stanford's hiring programs sometime
soon, and if the investigation reveals
that the Affirmative Action program is
not working, Stanford's federal fund
ing may be eliminated.
There is a feeling among those who
work directly with Affirmative Action,
however, that although the University
is trying, it is still unwilling to provide
adequate funds or staff to make a
really effective program.
Another problem some administra
tors perceive is that the decentralized
nature of decision-making at Stanford
encourages department chairmen to
ignore the administration's Affirmative
Action directives.

"From what we've seen happen at
other universities, we can comply with
the HEW people," James Siena, legal
adviser to the president, commented.
"There have been things that HEW
considered imposing on other univer

sities which were unreasonable, but
they have all been overturned in
Washington."
Siena has little direct contact with
the program, and does not see many
problems in it. "There's no doubt a
hell of a lot more attention is being
paid to this than in the past," he said,
"in part because of what we've seen
happen at other institutions. We've
certainly been aware also of the
growing women's movement."
"We still don't have many blacks,
Chicanos, American Indians or women,
in top administrative posts," Siena
continued. He feels, however, that it is
unlikely that the University's federal
funds will be cut off.
Siena stated that University of
ficials have had "informal" contacts
with HEW.
Personnel Office
Pat Devaney is one of the adminis
trators directly concerned with imple
menting the Affirmative Action pro
gram. She works in the Personnel
Office as an employment representa
tive f~>r women.
The Personnel Office has also hired
employment representatives for
blacks, Chicanos, and Asian-Ameri
cans. All four representatives, how
ever, work at these jobs in addition to
full-time regular personnel work.

"I see my position as to respond to
complaints of sex discrimination, to
try to find promotion opportunities
for women, to encourage them to seek
promotion, and to encourage depart
ments to look for women for tradi
tional male jobs," Devaney explained.
"I try to help women who are
secretaries with B.A.'s in English, for
example. It's just appalling how many
secretaries have master's degrees,
even," she added. "Often this type of
woman hasn't really ever thought of
herself as a career woman before. I
also encourage women to go into
traditionally male jobs, like store
keepers, where there's a lot of
money."
Yearly Meetings
Devaney meets every year with
department chairmen to see how many
women and minorities they will be
hiring. "There's a feeling still on
campus that Affirmative Action is a
personal thing. Department chairmen
•don't realize it's a federal law," she
remarked.
Devaney thinks that her office lacks
the money and the facilities for a truly
effective program.
"We also don't have a computerized
information system in order to tell
who has qualifications so it's very hard
for us to promote anyone from a
secretarial to an administrative posi
tion. The only way we have of
identifying women who should be
promoted is if they come to us."
Lightweights
Luis Nogales, who is in charge of
coordinating and implementing the
Affirmative Action program, feels that
the Personnel Office does not have
enough power to really institute
changes. "The Personnel Office is a
lightweight group trying to confront
the 300-pound heavyweight depart
ment chairmen," he explained. "That's
one reason why my office was
instituted. I can work directly with the
top University officials."
Nogales, like Devaney, finds many
frustrations in his job, but expresses a
cautious optimism. Affirmative Action
is not a full-time concern for Nogales,
either. "I am doing this in addition to
my responsibilities as Assistant to the
President for Mexican-American Af
fairs," he stated.
"I am leaving in June, and I will try
to get a full report completed before
then on the situation. I am going to
recommend that the University hire at
least one full-time Affirmative Action
officer with staff assistance. This
should be done before May because I
would like a month's transition so that
things don't just fall apart in June," he
added.
Nogales emphasizes that Affirma
tive Action is a legal requirement.
"Let's face it, the results so far are
shocking," he continued. 'The num
ber of minorities at Stanford has

greatly improved, but the distribution
hasn't. Forty percent of the work
force at Stanford is female, but they're
still in the lower-level jobs."
Basic Problem
Nogales sees the basic problem as
the decentralized authority of the
University. "A chairman can always
think of excuses not to hire women,"
he commented. "If she's too pretty,
for example, hell think that shell
distract the male workers, and if she's
too ugly, he'll think he doesn't like
hiring ugly women.
"We have to give departments
goals," he continued. "We can't force
decisions, but we can make some
pretty strong recommendations for
how many women and minorities
would be hired. If ninety out of a
hundred departments don't want to
hire women, though, you've got a
problem."
Anne Miner, Special Assistant to
the President on Women, also has
somewhat mixed feelings about the
results of the Affirmative Action
program for women. "The faculty
report I prepared has now been
published," she stated. "One thing
that is clear is that I misgauged how
fast it could be implemented; my
time-table was wildly optimistic. How
ever, it will all get done, I'm sure."
Staff Report
Miner is currently preparing a staff
discrimination report similar to the
one she prepared on faculty. "There
are problems in the minority Affirma
tive Action program already," she
explained. "So it would be inadequate
to go through and just add women to
it. The responsibility for processing
the Affirmative Action program right
now is with Personnel, so eventually
people think of it as a Personnel
program. We need to turn it around
and give the "responsibilities to the
supervisors.
"Right now we haven't reached the
supervisors," she continued. "It takes
a couple of rounds. First you get the
Vice-Presidents to have a clear under
standing of the situation and then you
go one level down. Personnel has tried
supervisor training, but in my view
they haven't succeeded, even in
relation to minorities, where we've
been trying two or three years."
Miner agrees with Nogales on two
points. For one thing, she feels goals
should be presented to departments.
"But goals should be in terms of a
range," she quickly added.
She also said, "The fundamental
problem is decentralized decision
making. A researcher who is hiring just
won't feel accountable to Personnel,
but he will to his dean. So we have the
give the dean the responsibility. The
deans in tum should be accountable to
the Vice-Presidents."

officer who will investigate Stanford.)

blacks, Chicanos, and Asian-Ameri
cans. All four representatives, how
ever, work at these jobs in addition to
full-time regular personnel work.

"I see my position as to respond to
complaints of sex discrimination, to
try to find promotion opportunities
for women, to encourage them to seek
promotion, and to encourage depart
ments to look for women for tradi
tional male jobs," Devaney explained.
"I try to help women who are
secretaries with B.A.'s in English, for
example. It's just appalling how many
secretaries have master's degrees,
even," she added. "Often this type of
woman hasn't really ever thought of
herself as a career woman before. I
also encourage women to go into
traditionally male jobs, like store
keepers, where there's a lot of
money."
Yearly Meetings
Devaney meets every year with
department chairmen to see how many
women and minorities they will be
hiring. "There's a feeling still on
campus that Affirmative Action is a
personal thing. Department chairmen
•don't realize it's a federal law," she
remarked.
Devaney thinks that her office lacks
the money and the facilities for a truly
effective program.
"We also don't have a computerized
information system in order to tell
who has qualifications so it's very hard
for us to promote anyone from a
secretarial to an administrative posi
tion. The only way we have of
identifying women who should be
promoted is if they come to us."
Lightweights
Luis Nogales, who is in charge of
coordinating and implementing the
Affirmative Action program, feels that
the Personnel Office does not have
enough power to really institute
changes. "The Personnel Office is a
lightweight group trying to confront
the 300-pound heavyweight depart
ment chairmen," he explained. "That's
one reason why my office was
instituted. I can work directly with the
top University officials."
Nogales, like Devaney, finds many
frustrations in his job, but expresses a
cautious optimism. Affirmative Action
is not a full-time concern for Nogales,
either. "I am doing this in addition to
my responsibilities as Assistant to the
President for Mexican-American Af
fairs," he stated.
"I am leaving in June, and I will try
to get a full report completed before
then on the situation. I am going to
recommend that the University hire at
least one full-time Affirmative Action
officer with staff assistance. This
should be done before May because I
would like a month's transition so that
things don't just fall apart in June," he
added.
Nogales emphasizes that Affirma
tive Action is a legal requirement.
"Let's face it, the results so far are
shocking," he continued. 'The num
ber of minorities at Stanford has

greatly improved, but the distribution
hasn't. Forty percent of the work
force at Stanford is female, but they're
still in the lower-level jobs."
Basic Problem
Nogales sees the basic problem as
the decentralized authority of the
University. "A chairman can always
think of excuses not to hire women,"
he commented. "If she's too pretty,
for example, hell think that shell
distract the male workers, and if she's
too ugly, he'll think he doesn't like
hiring ugly women.
"We have to give departments
goals," he continued. "We can't force
decisions, but we can make some
pretty strong recommendations for
how many women and minorities
would be hired. If ninety out of a
hundred departments don't want to
hire women, though, you've got a
problem."
Anne Miner, Special Assistant to
the President on Women, also has
somewhat mixed feelings about the
results of the Affirmative Action
program for women. "The faculty
report I prepared has now been
published," she stated. "One thing
that is clear is that I misgauged how
fast it could be implemented; my
time-table was wildly optimistic. How
ever, it will all get done, I'm sure."
Staff Report
Miner is currently preparing a staff
discrimination report similar to the
one she prepared on faculty. "There
are problems in the minority Affirma
tive Action program already," she
explained. "So it would be inadequate
to go through and just add women to
it. The responsibility for processing
the Affirmative Action program right
now is with Personnel, so eventually
people think of it as a Personnel
program. We need to turn it around
and give the "responsibilities to the
supervisors.
"Right now we haven't reached the
supervisors," she continued. "It takes
a couple of rounds. First you get the
Vice-Presidents to have a clear under
standing of the situation and then you
go one level down. Personnel has tried
supervisor training, but in my view
they haven't succeeded, even in
relation to minorities, where we've
been trying two or three years."
Miner agrees with Nogales on two
points. For one thing, she feels goals
should be presented to departments.
"But goals should be in terms of a
range," she quickly added.
She also said, "The fundamental
problem is decentralized decision
making. A researcher who is hiring just
won't feel accountable to Personnel,
but he will to his dean. So we have the
give the dean the responsibility. The
deans in tum should be accountable to
the Vice-Presidents."

officer who will investigate Stanford.)


Anne Miner
University officials are optimistic
about present and future implementa
tion of the Affirmative Action pro
gram for women, despite unimpressive
current statistics on female employ
ment here.
The Health, Education, and Welfare
Department (HEW) will investigate
Stanford's hiring programs sometime
soon, and if the investigation reveals
that the Affirmative Action program is
not working, Stanford's federal fund
ing may be eliminated.
There is a feeling among those who
work directly with Affirmative Action,
however, that although the University
is trying, it is still unwilling to provide
adequate funds or staff to make a
really effective program.
Another problem some administra
tors perceive is that the decentralized
nature of decision-making at Stanford
encourages department chairmen to
ignore the administration's Affirmative
Action directives.
Lawyer Comments
"From what we've seen happen at
other universities, we can comply with
the HEW people," James Siena, legal
adviser to the president, commented.
"There have been things that HEW
considered imposing on other univer

sities which were unreasonable, but
they have all been overturned in
Washington."
Siena has little direct contact with
the program, and does not see many
problems in it. "There's no doubt a
hell of a lot more attention is being
paid to this than in the past," he said,
"in part because of what we've seen
happen at other institutions. We've
certainly been aware also of the
growing women's movement."
"We still don't have many blacks,
Chicanos, American Indians or women,
in top administrative posts," Siena
continued. He feels, however, that it is
unlikely that the University's federal
funds will be cut off.
Siena stated that University of

with HEW.

either. "I am doing this in addition to
my responsibilities as Assistant to the
President for Mexican-American Af
fairs," he stated.
"I am leaving in June, and I will try
to get a full report completed before
then on the situation. I am going to
recommend that the University hire at
least one full-time Affirmative Action
officer with staff assistance. This
should be done before May because I
would like a month's transition so that
things don't just fall apart in June," he
added.
Nogales emphasizes that Affirma
tive Action is a legal requirement.
"Let's face it, the results so far are
shocking," he continued. 'The num
ber of minorities at Stanford has

greatly improved, but the distribution
hasn't. Forty percent of the work
force at Stanford is female, but they're
still in the lower-level jobs."
Basic Problem
Nogales sees the basic problem as
the decentralized authority of the
University. "A chairman can always
think of excuses not to hire women,"
he commented. "If she's too pretty,
for example, hell think that shell
distract the male workers, and if she's
too ugly, he'll think he doesn't like
hiring ugly women.
"We have to give departments
goals," he continued. "We can't force
decisions, but we can make some
pretty strong recommendations for
how many women and minorities
would be hired. If ninety out of a
hundred departments don't want to
hire women, though, you've got a
problem."
Anne Miner, Special Assistant to
the President on Women, also has
somewhat mixed feelings about the
results of the Affirmative Action
program for women. "The faculty
report I prepared has now been
published," she stated. "One thing
that is clear is that I misgauged how
fast it could be implemented; my
time-table was wildly optimistic. How
ever, it will all get done, I'm sure."
Staff Report
Miner is currently preparing a staff
discrimination report similar to the
one she prepared on faculty. "There
are problems in the minority Affirma
tive Action program already," she
explained. "So it would be inadequate
to go through and just add women to
it. The responsibility for processing
the Affirmative Action program right
now is with Personnel, so eventually
people think of it as a Personnel
program. We need to turn it around
and give the "responsibilities to the
supervisors.
"Right now we haven't reached the
supervisors," she continued. "It takes
a couple of rounds. First you get the
Vice-Presidents to have a clear under
standing of the situation and then you
go one level down. Personnel has tried
supervisor training, but in my view
they haven't succeeded, even in
relation to minorities, where we've
been trying two or three years."
Miner agrees with Nogales on two
points. For one thing, she feels goals
should be presented to departments.
"But goals should be in terms of a
range," she quickly added.
She also said, "The fundamental
problem is decentralized decision
making. A researcher who is hiring just
won't feel accountable to Personnel,
but he will to his dean. So we have the
give the dean the responsibility. The
deans in tum should be accountable to
the Vice-Presidents."

officer who will investigate Stanford.)


Anne Miner
University officials are optimistic
about present and future implementa
tion of the Affirmative Action pro
gram for women, despite unimpressive
current statistics on female employ
ment here.
The Health, Education, and Welfare
Department (HEW) will investigate
Stanford's hiring programs sometime
soon, and if the investigation reveals
that the Affirmative Action program is
not working, Stanford's federal fund
ing may be eliminated.
There is a feeling among those who
work directly with Affirmative Action,
however, that although the University
is trying, it is still unwilling to provide
adequate funds or staff to make a
really effective program.
Another problem some administra
tors perceive is that the decentralized
nature of decision-making at Stanford
encourages department chairmen to
ignore the administration's Affirmative
Action directives.
Lawyer Comments
"From what we've seen happen at
other universities, we can comply with
the HEW people," James Siena, legal
adviser to the president, commented.
"There have been things that HEW
considered imposing on other univer

sities which were unreasonable, but
they have all been overturned in
Washington."
Siena has little direct contact with
the program, and does not see many
problems in it. "There's no doubt a
hell of a lot more attention is being
paid to this than in the past," he said,
"in part because of what we've seen
happen at other institutions. We've
certainly been aware also of the
growing women's movement."
"We still don't have many blacks,
Chicanos, American Indians or women,
in top administrative posts," Siena
continued. He feels, however, that it is
unlikely that the University's federal
funds will be cut off.
Siena stated that University of
ficials have had "informal" contacts
with HEW.
Personnel Office
Pat Devaney is one of the adminis
trators directly concerned with imple
menting the Affirmative Action pro
gram. She works in the Personnel
Office as an employment representa
tive f~>r women.
The Personnel Office has also hired
employment representatives for
blacks, Chicanos, and Asian-Ameri
cans. All four representatives, how
ever, work at these jobs in addition to
full-time regular personnel work.

"I see my position as to respond to
complaints of sex discrimination, to
try to find promotion opportunities
for women, to encourage them to seek
promotion, and to encourage depart
ments to look for women for tradi
tional male jobs," Devaney explained.
"I try to help women who are
secretaries with B.A.'s in English, for
example. It's just appalling how many
secretaries have master's degrees,
even," she added. "Often this type of
woman hasn't really ever thought of
herself as a career woman before. I
also encourage women to go into
traditionally male jobs, like store
keepers, where there's a lot of
money."
Yearly Meetings
Devaney meets every year with
department chairmen to see how many
women and minorities they will be
hiring. "There's a feeling still on
campus that Affirmative Action is a
personal thing. Department chairmen
•don't realize it's a federal law," she
remarked.
Devaney thinks that her office lacks
the money and the facilities for a truly
effective program.
"We also don't have a computerized
information system in order to tell
who has qualifications so it's very hard
for us to promote anyone from a
secretarial to an administrative posi
tion. The only way we have of
identifying women who should be
promoted is if they come to us."
Lightweights
Luis Nogales, who is in charge of
coordinating and implementing the
Affirmative Action program, feels that
the Personnel Office does not have
enough power to really institute
changes. "The Personnel Office is a
lightweight group trying to confront
the 300-pound heavyweight depart
ment chairmen," he explained. "That's
one reason why my office was
instituted. I can work directly with the
top University officials."
Nogales, like Devaney, finds many
frustrations in his job, but expresses a
cautious optimism. Affirmative Action
is not a full-time concern for Nogales,
either. "I am doing this in addition to
my responsibilities as Assistant to the

are problems in the minority Affirma
tive Action program already," she
explained. "So it would be inadequate
to go through and just add women to
it. The responsibility for processing
the Affirmative Action program right
now is with Personnel, so eventually
people think of it as a Personnel
program. We need to turn it around
and give the "responsibilities to the
supervisors.
"Right now we haven't reached the
supervisors," she continued. "It takes
a couple of rounds. First you get the
Vice-Presidents to have a clear under
standing of the situation and then you
go one level down. Personnel has tried
supervisor training, but in my view
they haven't succeeded, even in
relation to minorities, where we've
been trying two or three years."
Miner agrees with Nogales on two
points. For one thing, she feels goals
should be presented to departments.
"But goals should be in terms of a
range," she quickly added.
She also said, "The fundamental
problem is decentralized decision
making. A researcher who is hiring just
won't feel accountable to Personnel,
but he will to his dean. So we have the
give the dean the responsibility. The
deans in tum should be accountable to
the Vice-Presidents."
