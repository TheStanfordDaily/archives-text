# S. Yiets Forced Back; Moratorium Plans Set
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
Battered and weakened South Viet
namese soldiers, aided by U.S. sup
port, are attempting to establish
strongholds and fight for their lives,
while, in this country, plans are being
made for a national moratorium to
protest U.S. involvement in Vietnam
and to demand that President Nixon
pull out all troops.
After the loss of the northernmost
province of Quang Tri yesterday,
South Vietnamese soldiers retreated to
the former Vietnam capital of Hue,
farther south. The troops have estab
lished a defense line about 16 miles
north of Hue and 35 miles south of
the demilitarized zone.
A North Vietnamese broadcast said
that Thua Phien province, of which
Hue is the capital, is doomed. U.S.
spokesmen claim that the only way to
hold the area is to aid the South
Vietnamese with air power; five U.S.
aircraft carriers, including the Midway,
are currently operating off the coast,
and strikes are being launched west of
Hue to push back the Vietcong
The North Vietnamese attack is
expected imminently and a senior U.S.
officer said that South Vietnamese
commanders were "confident and
resolute" that their troops could
defend the city.
Moratorium
A National Moratorium day is
scheduled for tomorrow, with students
and faculty at various college cam
puses planning to hold teach-ins and
think sessions aimed at convincing
Nixon to end U.S. involvement in
Vietnam.
Today, at Stanford, a noon rally at
SLAC and an all night "encampment
in support of the Vietnamese People
and in commemoration of the Kent
State, Jackson State and Augusta
Massacres of May, 1970" will act as a
prelude to Thursday's activities.
The rally at SLAC, to be held in
front of the cafeteria, will be directed
at overcoming "the obstacles that are
in our way to kind of work and living

conditions that the wealth of America
could provide," according to a leaflet
circulated yesterday. Speakers include
Pierre Noyes, about war, and Alice
Furumoto, who will present her views
on William Shockley.
While attempting to defend certain
territories, South Vietnamese soldiers
and their families are abandoning
others. After Binh Dinh province fell
to the Communists, South Vietnamese
left Sandy .Zone English, a regimental
command post in the central coastal
lowlands that had been under heavy
attack and surrounded by North
Vietnamese forces for two days.
N. Viet Base
The fall of this outpost gives the
North Vietnamese a base from which
they can either drive north toward
Quang Nai province or south toward
Qui Whon, South Vietnam's fourth
largest city. South Vietnamese soldiers
escaped the area by reaching the coast
and signaling landing ships.
Also emptying steadily is the
provincial capital of Kontum, located
on Highway 14, in the central
highlands. Some South Vietnamese
troops remain, but thousands of
civilians have fled from the city.
"Civilians are panic stricken," stat
ed one U.S. advisor. "They have
tipped over two helicopters by clinging
to the sleds." The North Vietnamese
are expected to attack the city at any
time and according to A.P., no one
doubts that an attack will come.
Brig. Gen. Thomas Bowen, deputy
senior U.S. adviser in the north,
attributed the apparent rash of North
Vietnamese victories to their use of
tanks, long range artillery, and sophis
ticated anti-aircraft guns. He also
reported an instance of a heat seeking
missile shooting down a U.S. heli
copter southeast of Quang Tri. Bowen
also indicated that spies may have
infiltrated South Vietnamese troops
and mingled with refugees.
Quandry
U.S. advisers state that they are still
in a quandry concerning the reorgani

zation of Vietnamese troops into
effective fighting units.
On Thursday, the anniversary of
the Kent State incident, picketing, a
memorial service at Memorial Church,
speeches, and a noon rally arc
scheduled here. War protesters plan to
picket the physical plant, steam plant,
library, and, according to spokesman
Kwonping Ho, "all places where
workers have indicated support for our
cause" beginning at 7 a.m.
At 9:30, a memorial service for
those killed at Kent, Jackson, and
Augusta will be held. Economics Prof.
John Gurley is scheduled to speak at
Mem Chu at 10:30 a.m. The rest of
the day's events will be decided at a
noon rally to be held in White Plaza,
with Bruce Franklin slated as keynote
speaker.
