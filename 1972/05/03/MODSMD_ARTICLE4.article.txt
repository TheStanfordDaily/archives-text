# Rejects Law School Quotas
## Faculty Affirms Previous Stand 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
In a statement released today,
members of the Law School faculty
reaffirmed admissions standards for
minority students outlined a year ago
and agreed that they should be applied
with "flexibility" in individual cases,
but refused to grant quotas for
minority admissions.
The faculty's statement came yes
terday in response to a demand made
by the Stanford black, Chicano, and
American Indian law associations that
a quota of 50 minority students be

admitted to the law school starting
this fall.
In a letter addressed to the
presidents of the Chicano and black
law associations, Law School Dean
Thomas Ehrlich said, "I am pleased to
report that .. . the faculty not only
affirmed the admission standards for
minority students stated in Dean
Manning's [former Law School Dean]
letter of last May, but also—in line
with one of your proposals—agreed
that those standards should be inter
preted flexibly by the Admissions

Committee ... to permit admission
this year of minority applicants who
academic records, when viewed as a
whole, are substantially equivalent to
those of minority applicants already
admitted."
Quota for Minorities
Members of the three minority law
associations met yesterday to draw up
a response to Ehrlich's letter. Chicano
Law Students Association President
Ralph Arreola said, "We feel that Dean
Ehrlich did not address himself to the
central issue, that of establishing a
quota for minority admissions.
"We appreciate that he's using some
of our ideas, and that the faculty
would like to incorporate some of
these ideas, but it was discouraging
that he did not even mention the
central issue. We don't see any way to
estimate what results the admissions
plan as it stands is going to produce."
Asked what future actions the
groups plan to take around the
demands, Arreola said, "We are going
to, at this time, send Dean Ehrlich our
response to his letter, along with other
requests, and we are urging a prompt
response.
'Flexibility'
"We want to know, concretely,
what that 'flexibility' means. We will
not be satisfied until sufficient or
reasonable numbers of minority stu

dents are produced."
Arreola said that the organizations'
leaders have drafted their formal reply
to Ehrlich, which they plan to release
as soon as all the members of the three
minority organizations have received a
copy of it.
Black Law Students Association
member, LaDoris Hazzard, who helped
draft the response, said last night, "I
was personally disappointed with Dean
Ehrlich's response. There was no
commitment made to increasing mi
nority enrollment.
Reiterate Demands
"Our next move is to reiterate the
demands; after that we plan to elicit
national coverage of this."
Arreola said the groups will release
their formal reply to Dean Ehrlich
sometime this week.
Members of the three minority law
organizations first presented their joint
list of demands to the law school
fatuity last week. The groups are
demanding that a quota of 50
minority students be established for
each entering class of 160, including
20 blacks, 20 Chicanos, and 10 Native
Americans.
The current first-year class includes
19 blacks, Chicanos, and Native
Americans. There were eight minority
law school students enrolled the
previous year.

Reiterate Demands
"Our next move is to reiterate the
demands; after that we plan to elicit
national coverage of this."
Arreola said the groups will release
their formal reply to Dean Ehrlich
sometime this week.
Members of the three minority law
organizations first presented their joint
list of demands to the law school
fatuity last week. The groups are
demanding that a quota of 50
minority students be established for
each entering class of 160, including
20 blacks, 20 Chicanos, and 10 Native
Americans.
The current first-year class includes
19 blacks, Chicanos, and Native
Americans. There were eight minority
law school students enrolled the
previous year.
In a statement released today,
members of the Law School faculty
reaffirmed admissions standards for
minority students outlined a year ago
and agreed that they should be applied
with "flexibility" in individual cases,
but refused to grant quotas for
minority admissions.
The faculty's statement came yes
terday in response to a demand made
by the Stanford black, Chicano, and
American Indian law associations that
a quota of 50 minority students be

admitted to the law school starting
this fall.
In a letter addressed to the
presidents of the Chicano and black
law associations, Law School Dean
Thomas Ehrlich said, "I am pleased to
report that .. . the faculty not only
affirmed the admission standards for
minority students stated in Dean
Manning's [former Law School Dean]
letter of last May, but also—in line
with one of your proposals—agreed
that those standards should be inter
preted flexibly by the Admissions

Committee ... to permit admission
this year of minority applicants who
academic records, when viewed as a
whole, are substantially equivalent to
those of minority applicants already
admitted."
Quota for Minorities
Members of the three minority law
associations met yesterday to draw up
a response to Ehrlich's letter. Chicano
Law Students Association President
Ralph Arreola said, "We feel that Dean
Ehrlich did not address himself to the
central issue, that of establishing a
quota for minority admissions.
"We appreciate that he's using some
of our ideas, and that the faculty
would like to incorporate some of
these ideas, but it was discouraging
that he did not even mention the
central issue. We don't see any way to
estimate what results the admissions
plan as it stands is going to produce."
Asked what future actions the
groups plan to take around the
demands, Arreola said, "We are going
to, at this time, send Dean Ehrlich our
response to his letter, along with other
requests, and we are urging a prompt
response.
'Flexibility'
"We want to know, concretely,
what that 'flexibility' means. We will
not be satisfied until sufficient or
reasonable numbers of minority stu

dents are produced."
Arreola said that the organizations'
leaders have drafted their formal reply
to Ehrlich, which they plan to release
as soon as all the members of the three
minority organizations have received a
copy of it.
Black Law Students Association
member, LaDoris Hazzard, who helped
draft the response, said last night, "I
was personally disappointed with Dean
Ehrlich's response. There was no
commitment made to increasing mi
nority enrollment.
