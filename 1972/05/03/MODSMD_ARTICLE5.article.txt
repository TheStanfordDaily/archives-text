# Teamsters Challenge Election, Cite Misleading Advertising
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Teamsters local 856 has filed five
objections to the April 19 Stanford
employees election with the San
Francisco regional office of the Na
tional Labor Relations Board (NLRB).
The Teamster; claim that the
University made untruthful and mis
leading statements in an advertisement
published in the April 17 Daily.
Complaining that the advertisement
appeared right before the election, the
Teamsters felt that it "was impossible
for the Union to effectively rebut" the
statements made by the University.
Specifically, the Teamsters claimed
that a wage comparison table appear
ing in the University's ad was based on
"misleading and inaccurate figures."
They also objected to the University's
contentions that Teamster local 856

does not have any bylaws, and that the
Union could not establish a separate
local for Stanford employees without
holding another representation elec
tion.
Objections
The Teamsters asserted in their
objections to the election that they do
have bylaws and would be able to set
up a separate local for Stanford
without filing for and winning another
representation election.
The Teamsters also cited the Daily's
participation in the election, complain
ing that it "consistently throughout
the pre-election period published un
truthful and misleading articles urging
employees to vote against the Union."
This was objectionable according to
the Teamsters because they claim that

the Daily is "largely subsidized by the
Employer" [the University].
Not Give Up
In the April 19 election, Teamster
local 856 was defeated by an 894 to
372 margin. Executive Secretary Rudy
Tham indicated after the election that
the Teamsters would not give up and
would file objections to the NLRB and
continue organizing efforts on campus.
NLRB officer Brad Wells stated
that the Teamsters' objections will be
investigated by an NLRB examiner
from the San Francisco office who will
make a recommendation to the direc
tor of the office as to whether the
challenge should be granted.
University officials yesterday de
clined comment about the Teamsters'
action, but indicated that a response
would be filed with the NLRB.
