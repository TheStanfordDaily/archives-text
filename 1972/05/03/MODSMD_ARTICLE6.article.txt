## End Sexism 
### 
Stanford University is a male-dominated institu
tion from top to bottom. Women here are consist
ently under-represented in all job categories except
those that are low-status, low-paid, and dead-end.
This must be changed.
As required to law, the University has established
an Affirmative Action program which seeks to coun
ter-act previous sexual and racial discrimination. Af
firmative Action does not mean simply equalizing
job opportunities; it means, rather, actively recruit
ing women and minorities to fill higher positions.
The University has, so far, done little of real sub
stance to improve the situation of the women who
work here. We would like to suggest the following as
tentative steps toward an effective Affirmative Ac
tion program.
Effectiveness: Right now Affirmative Action is
an administration program imposed on the workers.
Little if any attempt is made at obtaining either
employee feedback or employee inputs. Methods by
which these can be incorporated into the program
should be devised. The first step is extensive publici
ty for Affirmative Action.
Faculty: Almost all women faculty here are lec
turers who receive heavy teaching loads, low pay,
and have little or no hope of promotion. We would
like to suggest that an immediate effort be made to
promote women lecturers to full faculty positions,
as well as to hire new women to be regular profes
sors.
Wages: Extraordinary differences still exist be
tween wages of job categories which are primarily
male and those which are primarily female.
Stanford should pay women employees wages
which are at the top of the local salary market for
secretaries and clericals, rather than in the lower
regions.
Promotion: Stanford should concentrate more
on internally promoting women employees rather
than hiring top women from outside the University.

In order to ensure that women have the qualifica
tions necessary for promotion, workers should be
encouraged to attend those University classes which
will help women learn skills which are required for
higher positions.
Special efforts should be made to help women
move from secretarial to administrative jobs. Fur
thermore, many secretaries should have their titles
and pay raised to the administrative level, since they
are doing administrative work in their present jobs.
A computer system might be established so that the
University knows which women are qualified for
higher positions.
Attitude: Many administrators and professors
still think of women employees as "the girls" who
are called by their first names (which the women
have to call them "Mr." or "Professor"), get coffee,
and type personal letters. To counter-act this, the
University should institute supervisor training ses
sions as a part of the Affirmative Action program.
Women's Needs: Any Affirmative Action pro
gram is a farce unless it deals with women's special
needs. Because women in this society are expected
to care for a couple's children, adequate child care
(which the University is still unwilling to support) is
a prerequisite for an effective Affirmative Action
program. Benefits for part-time workers (many of
whom are women with small children) should also
be introduced.
A health insurance plan should include adequate
pregnancy, abortion, and maternity benefits. Not to
do so implies that the male body is normal, while
the female is an abberation.
The Affirmative Action program cannot act ef
fectively if it remains the unwanted stepchild which
it currently appears to be. The program must be
integrated into the University decision-making pro
cesses. At the very least a full-time Affirmativ
tion officer should be instituted, with full staff
monetary and computer support.
