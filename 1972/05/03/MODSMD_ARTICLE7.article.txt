## In Defense of Laser Technology 
### 
In Robert Barkan's recent
article on DoD sponsored laser
work at Stanford (Daily, April 27
and 28) and also in the Faculty
Political Action Group debate,
Professor Richard Pantell's work
on ultraviolet lasers was sharply
criticized.
My research group is also
involved in work aimed at the
generation of ultraviolet, vacuum

ultraviolet, and soft x-ray
radiation and is thus subject to
the same criticisms as is the
Pantell work.
It is my opinion that
ultra-violet lasers may very well,
and in fact most likely do, have
military applications. These
applications are not of the ray-gun
variety cited by Barken, (air is
opaque for wavelengths shorter

than about 2000 A) but instead
(in my opinion), are in the general
areas of analysis of gases for other
types of high power lasers; and
also possibly in the production of
high brightness visible lasers.
Many Applications
Ultraviolet lasers and soft x-ray
lasers will also have enormous
application to many types of
chemical, physical, and biological
studies. The principle long-range
goal of our own work is the
photography of cells and
molecules with a resolution
hundreds of times greater than
that now available. Ultimately it
will be possible to actually
photograph the exact structure of
complicated organic molecules.
Such a scientific advance could
enormously benefit mankind, e.g.,
in the areas of disease prevention
and control, food production,
pollution control, etc.

The question is thus raised:
Should work on ultraviolet and
x-ray lasers be stopped because
there is a possibility that they will
find application in military
affairs? The argument is raised
that the probability of such
military application far exceeds
that of the civilian applications
which I have mentioned. I
strongly dispute this — and feel
quite certain that the biological
and chemical applications will
outweigh direct military
application — I do agree that
indirect military applications may
result from the further
understanding of materials and
chemicals thus gained.
DoD Funding
A second question is: Is the
essence of the problem the DoD
funding or the work which is
being done? In the case of
ultraviolet lasers I am certain that

Stephen e. Harris

were my work funded by, for
instance, HEW, I would be
proceeding in the identical
manner that I am now. The
important advantage of funding
from HEW would be that there
would be a more direct link with
the next step in the civilian
application of these ideas.
Finally, on the question of
possible military application for
this scientific work, or for that
matter for the great quantity of
basic science and technology
underway at Stanford, it seems
very clear that the solution must
be the political control of the
results of .the. technology — and
not in an a priori and hopelessly
futile attempt to weigh the
potential applications of a
particular effort.
(Prof. Stephen E. Harris works on
lasers in the Microwave
Laboratory).
