# lobby, not government
## Make ASSU Voluntary 
### 
larry diamond

My feelings about this year's
ASSU Presidential elections were,
in the end, mixed. They were
mixed in my hope that the
student body would adopt the
theme of Hocker and Freidman
and the ticket of Brent Appel,
Elaine Wong, Pete Van Petten,
and Scott Burke.
The Hocker-Freidman theme
was: "There is no government like
no government." The newly
elected Council would do well to
understand the meaning behind
this. As they recognized
themselves in their campaign, the
ASSU is not a government.
It can be an effective lobbying
agent, a powerful union, or even a
moving symbolic force — but it is
not a government. It has nothing
to govern, no significant power or
authority of any kind legally
delegated to it.
Therefore, let's not play games
any longer. We should, in this
next year, do away with those
disfunctional trappings of the
ASSU that delude people into
believing it is a government.
Senate
The best place to begin is with
the Student Senate.
I can not think of a single issue
of any importance tht the Student
Senate has considered this year
that could not have been dealt
with more respectably — and
sometimes more justly — by the

student body as a whole. Too
many ambitious people have been
playing too many self-serving
games with the student legislature
to justify its continued existence.
Too few serious and thoughtful
students have been active and
successful in the student
legislature to justify its continued
existence.
The Student Senate has no
reason to exist in a government
that does not have the power, or
the responsibility, or the maturity
of conduct and judgement to
govern. And the Student Senate
does not have a right to exist
when its Chairman and the
Student Body President have the
nerve to force through a $400
travel allocation to themselves by
one vote without even having a
quorum present.
Voluntary Membership
Having done away with the
legislative branch, we must then
reduce the ASSU from a
"government" to a union — the
Associated Students of Stanford
University — with a voluntary
membership fee (say a dollar a
quarter) to be paid by any student
who wants to be a member of the
Associated Students.
Membership in the union
should be constructed so that it is
renewable each quarter, with a
student joining or refraining from
the union of Associated Students

based- on his opinion of the
elected leadership of the union
(the ASSU President and
Vice-President or Council of
Presidents).
The institution of a voluntary
fee revolutionizes the concept of
student government in ways that
Hocker and Freidman surely
understood, but did not state
clearly enough in their campaign.
It makes the student a genuine
consumer of student leadership
(student government, if you will).
Depending on what he thinks of
last quarter's performance, or
depending on his initial opinion of
the newly-elected leaders, a
student can choose to buy into or
not buy into the ASSU. If a
Council of Presidents is elected
that he can't support, the student
can withdraw from the Associated
Students until a new Council or
President is elected, or until the
old Council produces some results
that win his support.
Dissolve Every Year
The union of Associated
Students should have a life of
only one year, dissolving and
reforming after each Spring
election. Each Spring the two or
three or four newly elected
student leaders could begin anew,
either keeping or dismantling last
year's ASSU bureaucracy (i.e.
whatever student task forces,
committees and programs that
were or were not established) and
either keeping or replacing the
ASSU's appointments to
University committees and
judicial bodies.
With an annual dissolution and
reconstruction of the union, and
with the annual election by the
entire student body of a new
President(s), we can insure that
the organization need not be
self-perpetuating. The nature of
the leaders of the Union, and the
nature therefore of its programs,
platform, and membership, is
open to change each Spring
depending on the changes in the
student body (or at least that
sub-set of the student body that
cares enough to vote once a year).
And by making the ASSU
membership fee payable in smaller
amounts every quarter, rather
than in one lump sum for the
whole year, we provide an
incentive for the Presidents of the
Associated Students to be
responsive to the pool of student
consumers, all of whom could or
could not pay the ASSU fee.
Presidents Shouldn't Speak
Further, we can end this
ridiculous illusion in the outside
world that everytime the ASSU
Presidents open their mouths they
are speaking for the entire student
body. Since the ASSU Presidents
have no legal responsibility or
power over the University, there is
no need for them ever to speak
for the entire student body.
There are many difficulties in
this plan — most of them
problems in transition. To legally

establish all this we would need a
new constitution. And we would
need a mechanism for changing
that constitution, perhaps by
amendments that can be placed
on the Spring ballot after a
sufficient number of signatures
are collected on petitions, as is
done now.
We would have to establish a
mechanism by which worthy
student organizations could get
money from the student body. We
have seen that this mechanism is
not to vote a huge lump sum to
the ASSU and then watch the
Student Senate grovel in the
sandbox for the next six months,
drooling and drawing blood over
how to divide up the pie.
Consumer
The mechanism should be one
in which the student's role as
consumer is again emphasized. If a
student isn't satisfied with the
budget or activities of an
organization, he should not have
to pay any fee to it. And because
he doesn't have to give it any
money, the student organization
is encouraged to account carefully
for how it spends its funds.
Even though the student
organization assessments would be
voluntary, we can't ask the
Uniersity to be a collection
agency for every student
organization that wants to seek a
voluntary fee. We must distinguish
between those organizations with
some base of student support and
those with little or no such base.
It seems reasonable to ask the
University to collect at
registration each quarter
voluntary assessments for the
ASSU and for some student
organizations. Six hundred
signatures (or some specific
number) on petitions could be
required of an organization that
wanted the University to collect a
voluntary fee for them for the
subsequent quarter. Twice that
many signatures could be required
of an organization that wanted to
be among the University's list of
voluntar>' fee assessments for the
subsequent three quarters.
While I was seeking office last
year, and while I was in office, I
dismissed out of hand the notion
of a voluntary ASSU. But a few
days ago I was struck by the
ultimate irony of this last year of
student government — the fact
that we, as a Council of
Presidents, were calling
continually on the University to
recognize the students in their
role as consumer, while we
ourselves never began to recognize
that role as it can and should
apply to the ASSU.
Consistent With Reality
I am now convinced that if the
formal structure of the ASSU is to
be consistent with reality, then it
must be reduced in constitutional
scope and membership in it must
be made voluntary.
And if any sense of trust and
hope and respect for the ASSU is
to be restored, if the ASSU is to
be revitalized as a constructive
and aggressive force on behalf of
students, these drastic steps
toward voluntarism must be
taken, and taken soon.
Those in student government
have been arguing for years that
to make the ASSU a voluntary
organization would be to destroy
it. I must now offer my own
conviction that such a step would
be the only way to save it.

My feelings about this year's
ASSU Presidential elections were,
in the end, mixed. They were
mixed in my hope that the
student body would adopt the
theme of Hocker and Freidman
and the ticket of Brent Appel,
Elaine Wong, Pete Van Petten,
and Scott Burke.
The Hocker-Freidman theme
was: "There is no government like
no government." The newly
elected Council would do well to
understand the meaning behind
this. As they recognized
themselves in their campaign, the
ASSU is not a government.
It can be an effective lobbying
agent, a powerful union, or even a
moving symbolic force — but it is
not a government. It has nothing
to govern, no significant power or
authority of any kind legally
delegated to it.
Therefore, let's not play games
any longer. We should, in this
next year, do away with those
disfunctional trappings of the
ASSU that delude people into
believing it is a government.
Senate
The best place to begin is with
the Student Senate.
I can not think of a single issue
of any importance tht the Student
Senate has considered this year
that could not have been dealt
with more respectably — and
sometimes more justly — by the

student body as a whole. Too
many ambitious people have been
playing too many self-serving
games with the student legislature
to justify its continued existence.
Too few serious and thoughtful
students have been active and
successful in the student
legislature to justify its continued
existence.
The Student Senate has no
reason to exist in a government
that does not have the power, or
the responsibility, or the maturity
of conduct and judgement to
govern. And the Student Senate
does not have a right to exist
when its Chairman and the
Student Body President have the
nerve to force through a $400
travel allocation to themselves by
one vote without even having a
quorum present.
Voluntary Membership
Having done away with the
legislative branch, we must then
reduce the ASSU from a
"government" to a union — the
Associated Students of Stanford
University — with a voluntary
membership fee (say a dollar a
quarter) to be paid by any student
who wants to be a member of the
Associated Students.
Membership in the union
should be constructed so that it is
renewable each quarter, with a
student joining or refraining from
the union of Associated Students

based- on his opinion of the
elected leadership of the union
(the ASSU President and
Vice-President or Council of
Presidents).
The institution of a voluntary
fee revolutionizes the concept of
student government in ways that
Hocker and Freidman surely
understood, but did not state
clearly enough in their campaign.
It makes the student a genuine
consumer of student leadership
(student government, if you will).
Depending on what he thinks of
last quarter's performance, or
depending on his initial opinion of
the newly-elected leaders, a
student can choose to buy into or
not buy into the ASSU. If a
Council of Presidents is elected
that he can't support, the student
can withdraw from the Associated
Students until a new Council or
President is elected, or until the
old Council produces some results
that win his support.
Dissolve Every Year
The union of Associated
Students should have a life of
only one year, dissolving and
reforming after each Spring
election. Each Spring the two or
three or four newly elected
student leaders could begin anew,
either keeping or dismantling last
year's ASSU bureaucracy (i.e.
whatever student task forces,
committees and programs that
were or were not established) and
either keeping or replacing the
ASSU's appointments to
University committees and
judicial bodies.
With an annual dissolution and
reconstruction of the union, and
with the annual election by the
entire student body of a new
President(s), we can insure that
the organization need not be
self-perpetuating. The nature of
the leaders of the Union, and the
nature therefore of its programs,
platform, and membership, is
open to change each Spring
depending on the changes in the
student body (or at least that
sub-set of the student body that
cares enough to vote once a year).
And by making the ASSU
membership fee payable in smaller
amounts every quarter, rather
than in one lump sum for the
whole year, we provide an
incentive for the Presidents of the
Associated Students to be
responsive to the pool of student
consumers, all of whom could or
could not pay the ASSU fee.
Presidents Shouldn't Speak
Further, we can end this
ridiculous illusion in the outside
world that everytime the ASSU
Presidents open their mouths they
are speaking for the entire student
body. Since the ASSU Presidents
have no legal responsibility or
power over the University, there is
no need for them ever to speak
for the entire student body.
There are many difficulties in
this plan — most of them
problems in transition. To legally

establish all this we would need a
new constitution. And we would
need a mechanism for changing
that constitution, perhaps by
amendments that can be placed
on the Spring ballot after a
sufficient number of signatures
are collected on petitions, as is
done now.
We would have to establish a
mechanism by which worthy
student organizations could get
money from the student body. We
have seen that this mechanism is
not to vote a huge lump sum to
the ASSU and then watch the
Student Senate grovel in the
sandbox for the next six months,
drooling and drawing blood over
how to divide up the pie.
Consumer
The mechanism should be one
in which the student's role as
consumer is again emphasized. If a
student isn't satisfied with the
budget or activities of an
organization, he should not have
to pay any fee to it. And because
he doesn't have to give it any
money, the student organization
is encouraged to account carefully
for how it spends its funds.
Even though the student
organization assessments would be
voluntary, we can't ask the
Uniersity to be a collection
agency for every student
organization that wants to seek a
voluntary fee. We must distinguish
between those organizations with
some base of student support and
those with little or no such base.
It seems reasonable to ask the
University to collect at
registration each quarter
voluntary assessments for the
ASSU and for some student
organizations. Six hundred
signatures (or some specific
number) on petitions could be
required of an organization that
wanted the University to collect a
voluntary fee for them for the
subsequent quarter. Twice that
many signatures could be required
of an organization that wanted to
be among the University's list of
voluntar>' fee assessments for the
subsequent three quarters.
While I was seeking office last
year, and while I was in office, I
dismissed out of hand the notion
of a voluntary ASSU. But a few
days ago I was struck by the
ultimate irony of this last year of
student government — the fact
that we, as a Council of
Presidents, were calling
continually on the University to
recognize the students in their
role as consumer, while we
ourselves never began to recognize
that role as it can and should
apply to the ASSU.
Consistent With Reality
I am now convinced that if the
formal structure of the ASSU is to
be consistent with reality, then it
must be reduced in constitutional
scope and membership in it must
be made voluntary.
And if any sense of trust and
hope and respect for the ASSU is
to be restored, if the ASSU is to
be revitalized as a constructive
and aggressive force on behalf of
students, these drastic steps
toward voluntarism must be
taken, and taken soon.
Those in student government
have been arguing for years that
to make the ASSU a voluntary
organization would be to destroy
it. I must now offer my own
conviction that such a step would

My feelings about this year's
ASSU Presidential elections were,
in the end, mixed. They were
mixed in my hope that the
student body would adopt the
theme of Hocker and Freidman
and the ticket of Brent Appel,
Elaine Wong, Pete Van Petten,
and Scott Burke.
The Hocker-Freidman theme
was: "There is no government like
no government." The newly
elected Council would do well to
understand the meaning behind
this. As they recognized
themselves in their campaign, the
ASSU is not a government.
It can be an effective lobbying
agent, a powerful union, or even a
moving symbolic force — but it is
not a government. It has nothing
to govern, no significant power or
authority of any kind legally
delegated to it.
Therefore, let's not play games
any longer. We should, in this
next year, do away with those
disfunctional trappings of the
ASSU that delude people into
believing it is a government.
Senate
The best place to begin is with
the Student Senate.
I can not think of a single issue
of any importance tht the Student
Senate has considered this year
that could not have been dealt
with more respectably — and
sometimes more justly — by the

student body as a whole. Too
many ambitious people have been
playing too many self-serving
games with the student legislature
to justify its continued existence.
Too few serious and thoughtful
students have been active and
successful in the student
legislature to justify its continued
existence.
The Student Senate has no
reason to exist in a government
that does not have the power, or
the responsibility, or the maturity
of conduct and judgement to
govern. And the Student Senate
does not have a right to exist
when its Chairman and the
Student Body President have the
nerve to force through a $400
travel allocation to themselves by
one vote without even having a
quorum present.
Voluntary Membership
Having done away with the
legislative branch, we must then
reduce the ASSU from a
"government" to a union — the
Associated Students of Stanford
University — with a voluntary
membership fee (say a dollar a
quarter) to be paid by any student
who wants to be a member of the
Associated Students.
Membership in the union
should be constructed so that it is
renewable each quarter, with a
student joining or refraining from
the union of Associated Students

based- on his opinion of the
elected leadership of the union
(the ASSU President and
Vice-President or Council of
Presidents).
The institution of a voluntary
fee revolutionizes the concept of
student government in ways that
Hocker and Freidman surely
understood, but did not state
clearly enough in their campaign.
It makes the student a genuine
consumer of student leadership
(student government, if you will).
Depending on what he thinks of
last quarter's performance, or
depending on his initial opinion of
the newly-elected leaders, a
student can choose to buy into or
not buy into the ASSU. If a
Council of Presidents is elected
that he can't support, the student
can withdraw from the Associated
Students until a new Council or
President is elected, or until the
old Council produces some results
that win his support.
Dissolve Every Year
The union of Associated
Students should have a life of
only one year, dissolving and
reforming after each Spring
election. Each Spring the two or
three or four newly elected
student leaders could begin anew,
either keeping or dismantling last
year's ASSU bureaucracy (i.e.
whatever student task forces,
committees and programs that
were or were not established) and
either keeping or replacing the
ASSU's appointments to
University committees and
judicial bodies.
With an annual dissolution and
reconstruction of the union, and
with the annual election by the
entire student body of a new
President(s), we can insure that
the organization need not be
self-perpetuating. The nature of
the leaders of the Union, and the
nature therefore of its programs,
platform, and membership, is
open to change each Spring
depending on the changes in the
student body (or at least that
sub-set of the student body that
cares enough to vote once a year).
And by making the ASSU
membership fee payable in smaller
amounts every quarter, rather
than in one lump sum for the
whole year, we provide an
incentive for the Presidents of the
Associated Students to be
responsive to the pool of student
consumers, all of whom could or
could not pay the ASSU fee.
Presidents Shouldn't Speak
Further, we can end this
ridiculous illusion in the outside
world that everytime the ASSU
Presidents open their mouths they
are speaking for the entire student
body. Since the ASSU Presidents
have no legal responsibility or
power over the University, there is
no need for them ever to speak
for the entire student body.
There are many difficulties in
this plan — most of them
problems in transition. To legally

establish all this we would need a
new constitution. And we would
need a mechanism for changing
that constitution, perhaps by
amendments that can be placed
on the Spring ballot after a
sufficient number of signatures
are collected on petitions, as is
done now.
We would have to establish a
mechanism by which worthy
student organizations could get
money from the student body. We
have seen that this mechanism is
not to vote a huge lump sum to
the ASSU and then watch the
Student Senate grovel in the
sandbox for the next six months,
drooling and drawing blood over
how to divide up the pie.
Consumer
The mechanism should be one
in which the student's role as
consumer is again emphasized. If a
student isn't satisfied with the
budget or activities of an
organization, he should not have
to pay any fee to it. And because
he doesn't have to give it any
money, the student organization
is encouraged to account carefully
for how it spends its funds.
Even though the student
organization assessments would be
voluntary, we can't ask the
Uniersity to be a collection
agency for every student
organization that wants to seek a
voluntary fee. We must distinguish
between those organizations with
some base of student support and
those with little or no such base.
It seems reasonable to ask the
University to collect at
registration each quarter
voluntary assessments for the
ASSU and for some student
organizations. Six hundred
signatures (or some specific
number) on petitions could be
required of an organization that
wanted the University to collect a
voluntary fee for them for the
subsequent quarter. Twice that
many signatures could be required
of an organization that wanted to
be among the University's list of
voluntar>' fee assessments for the
subsequent three quarters.
While I was seeking office last
year, and while I was in office, I
dismissed out of hand the notion
of a voluntary ASSU. But a few
days ago I was struck by the
ultimate irony of this last year of
student government — the fact
that we, as a Council of
Presidents, were calling
continually on the University to
recognize the students in their
role as consumer, while we
ourselves never began to recognize
that role as it can and should
apply to the ASSU.
Consistent With Reality
I am now convinced that if the
formal structure of the ASSU is to
be consistent with reality, then it
must be reduced in constitutional
scope and membership in it must
be made voluntary.
And if any sense of trust and
hope and respect for the ASSU is
to be restored, if the ASSU is to
be revitalized as a constructive

I am now convinced that if the

My feelings about this year's
ASSU Presidential elections were,
in the end, mixed. They were
mixed in my hope that the
student body would adopt the
theme of Hocker and Freidman
and the ticket of Brent Appel,
Elaine Wong, Pete Van Petten,
and Scott Burke.
The Hocker-Freidman theme
was: "There is no government like
no government." The newly
elected Council would do well to
understand the meaning behind
this. As they recognized
themselves in their campaign, the
ASSU is not a government.
It can be an effective lobbying
agent, a powerful union, or even a
moving symbolic force — but it is
not a government. It has nothing
to govern, no significant power or
authority of any kind legally
delegated to it.
Therefore, let's not play games
any longer. We should, in this
next year, do away with those
disfunctional trappings of the
ASSU that delude people into
believing it is a government.
Senate
The best place to begin is with
the Student Senate.
I can not think of a single issue
of any importance tht the Student
Senate has considered this year
that could not have been dealt
with more respectably — and
sometimes more justly — by the

student body as a whole. Too
many ambitious people have been
playing too many self-serving
games with the student legislature
to justify its continued existence.
Too few serious and thoughtful
students have been active and
successful in the student
legislature to justify its continued
existence.
The Student Senate has no
reason to exist in a government
that does not have the power, or
the responsibility, or the maturity
of conduct and judgement to
govern. And the Student Senate
does not have a right to exist
when its Chairman and the
Student Body President have the
nerve to force through a $400
travel allocation to themselves by
one vote without even having a
quorum present.
Voluntary Membership
Having done away with the
legislative branch, we must then
reduce the ASSU from a
"government" to a union — the
Associated Students of Stanford
University — with a voluntary
membership fee (say a dollar a
quarter) to be paid by any student
who wants to be a member of the
Associated Students.
Membership in the union
should be constructed so that it is
renewable each quarter, with a
student joining or refraining from
the union of Associated Students

based- on his opinion of the
elected leadership of the union
(the ASSU President and
Vice-President or Council of
Presidents).
The institution of a voluntary
fee revolutionizes the concept of
student government in ways that
Hocker and Freidman surely
understood, but did not state
clearly enough in their campaign.
It makes the student a genuine
consumer of student leadership
(student government, if you will).
Depending on what he thinks of
last quarter's performance, or
depending on his initial opinion of
the newly-elected leaders, a
student can choose to buy into or
not buy into the ASSU. If a
Council of Presidents is elected
that he can't support, the student
can withdraw from the Associated
Students until a new Council or
President is elected, or until the
old Council produces some results
that win his support.
Dissolve Every Year
The union of Associated
Students should have a life of
only one year, dissolving and
reforming after each Spring
election. Each Spring the two or
three or four newly elected
student leaders could begin anew,
either keeping or dismantling last
year's ASSU bureaucracy (i.e.
whatever student task forces,
committees and programs that
were or were not established) and
either keeping or replacing the
ASSU's appointments to
University committees and
judicial bodies.
With an annual dissolution and
reconstruction of the union, and
with the annual election by the
entire student body of a new
President(s), we can insure that
the organization need not be
self-perpetuating. The nature of
the leaders of the Union, and the
nature therefore of its programs,
platform, and membership, is
open to change each Spring
depending on the changes in the
student body (or at least that
sub-set of the student body that
cares enough to vote once a year).
And by making the ASSU
membership fee payable in smaller
amounts every quarter, rather
than in one lump sum for the
whole year, we provide an
incentive for the Presidents of the
Associated Students to be
responsive to the pool of student
consumers, all of whom could or
could not pay the ASSU fee.
Presidents Shouldn't Speak
Further, we can end this
ridiculous illusion in the outside
world that everytime the ASSU
Presidents open their mouths they
are speaking for the entire student
body. Since the ASSU Presidents
have no legal responsibility or
power over the University, there is
no need for them ever to speak
for the entire student body.
There are many difficulties in
this plan — most of them
problems in transition. To legally

establish all this we would need a
new constitution. And we would
need a mechanism for changing
that constitution, perhaps by
amendments that can be placed
on the Spring ballot after a
sufficient number of signatures
are collected on petitions, as is
done now.
We would have to establish a
mechanism by which worthy
student organizations could get
money from the student body. We
have seen that this mechanism is
not to vote a huge lump sum to
the ASSU and then watch the
Student Senate grovel in the
sandbox for the next six months,
drooling and drawing blood over
how to divide up the pie.
Consumer
The mechanism should be one
in which the student's role as
consumer is again emphasized. If a
student isn't satisfied with the
budget or activities of an
organization, he should not have
to pay any fee to it. And because
he doesn't have to give it any
money, the student organization
is encouraged to account carefully
for how it spends its funds.
Even though the student
organization assessments would be
voluntary, we can't ask the
Uniersity to be a collection
agency for every student
organization that wants to seek a
voluntary fee. We must distinguish
between those organizations with
some base of student support and
those with little or no such base.
It seems reasonable to ask the
University to collect at
registration each quarter
voluntary assessments for the
ASSU and for some student
organizations. Six hundred
signatures (or some specific
number) on petitions could be
required of an organization that
wanted the University to collect a
voluntary fee for them for the
subsequent quarter. Twice that
many signatures could be required
of an organization that wanted to
be among the University's list of
voluntar>' fee assessments for the
subsequent three quarters.
While I was seeking office last
year, and while I was in office, I
dismissed out of hand the notion
of a voluntary ASSU. But a few
days ago I was struck by the
ultimate irony of this last year of
student government — the fact
that we, as a Council of
Presidents, were calling
continually on the University to
recognize the students in their
role as consumer, while we
ourselves never began to recognize
that role as it can and should
apply to the ASSU.
Consistent With Reality
I am now convinced that if the
formal structure of the ASSU is to
be consistent with reality, then it
must be reduced in constitutional
scope and membership in it must
be made voluntary.
And if any sense of trust and
hope and respect for the ASSU is
to be restored, if the ASSU is to
be revitalized as a constructive
and aggressive force on behalf of
students, these drastic steps
toward voluntarism must be
taken, and taken soon.
Those in student government
have been arguing for years that
to make the ASSU a voluntary
organization would be to destroy
it. I must now offer my own
conviction that such a step would
be the only way to save it.
