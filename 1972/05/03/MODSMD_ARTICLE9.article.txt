Chinese Visit
Editor, THE DAILY:
Concerning Charlie Hoffman's
story in Monday's Daily on the
visit of the Chinese table tennis
team, I should like to clarify and
correct the statement that "the
Chinese attended a secret
luncheon with a group of 50
Concerned Asian Scholars and
residents of Lagunita." First,
though it may seem a quibble, the
term "unpublicized" is more
accurate than "secret." Security
authorities traveling with the
group insisted that no public
announcement of the luncheon be
made; efforts to change this
decision were unavailing.
Second, those at Stanford
involved in planning the visit were
successful — at very nearly the last
minute — in overruling a decision
by the same security group that
would have closed the luncheon
to all but a few Lag students. As a
result, about twenty members of
the East Asian community
(faculty, students, staff) also
attended. Some of these students
are members of Concerned Asian
Scholars at Stanford; others are
not. For this function, as for
others in which students
participated, selection was made
through the East Asian Graduate
Student Association, not through
CASS.

End The War
(Editor's note: This letter was
sent to the American Embassy in
Paris.)
As American students and
faculty of Stanford University
studying in France, our separation
from distracting influences of
American life has allowed us time
to think about the moral
implications of our foreign policy.
Our readings of the foreign press
have heightened our awareness of
the unacceptability of American
involvement in Indochina, an
awareness made all the more acute
by the resumption of air attacks
in the north. We believe that we
must once more register our
disapproval of the conduct of the
Administration in Indochina.
You have doubtless received
scores of protests against our
involvement in Indochina; while
we realize that our Embassy in
Paris does not have the last word
in foreign policy decisions, we are
also aware that you have a strong
influence on the shape of
American foreign policy, as
representatives of our government
abroad. We therefore turn to you,
as our representative in a foreign
land itself often and savagely
destroyed by the ravages of
modern war, to exercise all the
influence in your power to urge
the Department of State and the
White House:
*to call an immediate halt to
the air strikes in the north; and
*to assure a full withdrawal of
American troops from
Indochina subject only to the
safe return of Americans held
in the North and the
guaranteed evacuation of
confederates who would be
endangered by our withdrawal.

Ireland
Editor, THE DAILY:
It was amusing to read Mr.
Evers' article, Daily, April 18,
cheering on the IRA Provisionals'
terrorist campaign to coerce the
Ulster Protestants into the Irish
Republic. Apparently there's no
atrocity so terrible, from Stalin's
camps to Hue, that you can't find
an ignorant American intellectual
to support it.

What is especially remarkable is
that Mr. Evers has fallen for the
Celtic racist myth that Ireland was
perfectly harmonious from time
immemorial until the descent of
the rapacious English. Actually,
Irish history like English is a
continuous tale of invasion and
civil war. At one point, the
ancestors of the Ulster Protestants
migrated from Ireland to
Scotland, whence they were to
return in the seventeenth century.
It's therefore utterly fatuous to
talk of the Catholics' 'legal title'
to land; conquest was, is, and
always will be the only title to
land. That's why Americans hold
America — the Protestants settled
Ulster before the Pilgrim Fathers
settled New England.
I assume Mr. Evers will shortly
be calling for the eviction of
Americans and Israelis, and the
return of their lands to the
original inhabitants. But in case
his moralistic gropings are
tempered by some concern for
reality, I must point out a detail
he's missed. No less than
Americans or Israelis, rather than
submit to annihilation, the Ulster
Protestants will fight.
Back to the drawing board,
Bill.

Editor, THE DAILY:
What sort of "security" is it,
for Stanford and its neighbors,
when a brave, gentle, truthful son
of the Thai people is arrested on
charges of stealing from the
campus bookstore?
Many of us, long-time residents
near Stanford, know Kwonping
Ho. We regard him as our own
grandson.

Police Actions
Editor, THE DAILY:
We were outraged at the
first-hand reports of the
harrassment, the brutality, and
the violence of the area police
toward the demonstrators April
20 and 21. The inhumane
behavior of members of the local
police and the Santa Clara
sheriff's department was
inexcusable. We are appalled at
the silence of the Stanford
administration in response to this
behavior.
The issue is not whether or not
Stanford stands in loco parentis to
the students. It is rather the issue
of Stanford's relation to the
police of the area.
Stanford is one of the two
largest institutions and employers

on the Peninsula. As a major
institution it is hardly in a
position to wash its hands of the
police. Rather, Stanford has not
only the power but also the
responsibility to speak out when
its community members are
misused or maltreated by the
police.
The administration has made
no public response to last week's
sorry events. Its silence can only
be heard by both students and
police alike as endorsement and
approval of the reported police
brutality. If the reports prove to
be true, and the University
remains silent, it will be
condoning one of the most
dangerous manifestations of
law-breaking our society can
experience. When police can break
the law with impunity, then
neither citizens nor Universities

can be sure how long their
freedom will last.
We call upon the
administration to conduct a
thorough investigation of last
week's police action.

McHenry
Editor, THE DAILY:
Is Douglas McHenry on some
sort of power or super ego trip?
What right does he have under the
ASSU constitution to make some
half-assed deal with 55 students to
suppress the rights of at least 600
students who, by signing a
petition, have expressed their
interest in having the "Indian
question" put on the ballot?
As President of the ASSU Mr.
McHenry is demonstrating his

complete political irresponsibility
by refusing to represent the
wishes of this group of students
and possibly many more.
It is the constitutional duty of
the ASSU President to put any
valid petition onto the ballot. Mr.
McHenry has decided not to fulfill
his duties as the President,
thereby demonstrating his lack of
integrity. Anyone who uses his
power to violate the constitution
which put him in office is not
worthy of that office and ought
to be removed.
The petition which requests
that the "Indian question" be put
on the ballot is valid under the
present constitution and it should
be put to the Stanford students as
soon as possible.
