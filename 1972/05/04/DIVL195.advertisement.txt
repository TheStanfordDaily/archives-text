WE'VE GOT
GUTS!
In fact, Short Swing has six-count 'em — SIX different
types of gut for custom stringing your tennis racquet,
including the all-new "V.S." and "Bow Brand" — longer
lasting, better playing, and weatherproof gut strings from
France. Gut prices range from $14.00 to $19.50 (including
labor). Those who're on a budget can choose from three
different grades of Nylon Tennis Strings. New nylon tennis
strings start as low as $5.50 (including labor).
And equally important, are our expert stringers, Rick
Meider and Mike Vayssie. Rick and Mike combine ten years
experience in the re-stringing and regrapping craft to
guarantee you the finest tennis racquet service anywhere.
