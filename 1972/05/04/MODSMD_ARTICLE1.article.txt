(This is an interview with the HEW officer who will be
investigating the sex discrimination complaint filed by the
Stanford Women's Union.)
SAN FRANCISCO - The Health, Education and Welfare
(HEW) Department investigation of possible sex
discrimination in employment at Stanford will not begin
this academic year.
According to Waite Madison, HEW officer for the
investigation, "I have prior commitments which prevent
my coming. I can't tell when I'll be there."
However, Madison has already met with members of
the Stanford administration, although he prefers not to
call them that. When asked whether he has met with
administrators, Madison's first response was, "Well, let's
say no."
When it was pointed out to him that certain University
administrators claimed to have met Madison already, the
federal officer responded, "This is difficult to answer.
Well yes, I did sit in on a meeting of the Affirmative
Action Committee. I was invited to sit in. However, my
visit had nothing to do with the Complaint itself."
Madison's only comment on the nature of the meeting
was, "It was a general discussion as to what was being
done with the Affirmative Action Plan—how the Plan was
being developed."

Dr. Frank Albert, an HEW officer and a graduate of
Stanford who was also present during the interview, stated
that he had been down to Stanford several times. "None
of my visits had anything to do with the Complaint," he
said.
However, Madison revealed that neither he nor Albert
had met with the Stanford Women's Union who filed the
Complaint.
"I do not think it is valuable to meet with them at this
time. In fact, someone from that organization called to
make an appointment, but we couldn't arrange one since
they could only meet in the evening," Madison
commented.
Madison expressed mixed feelings about the anecdotal
nature of the Complaint. "Of course, we would prefer to

have as many hard facts as possible," he explained, "but
this has no bearing on the acceptability of the Complaint
itself."
Concerning the possibility of Stanford withholding
information, Madison stated, "No, I don't expect any
problems like that. I did have some problems at Berkeley;
however, those were solved. I think all people concerned
understand the situation and will cooperate."
Funds Cut Off?
Madison said that he could not speculate whether
Stanford's federal funding would be cut off until after he
had completed his investigation.
When questioned further about the possible emphasis
of his investigation—whether he would be looking for

subtle forms of discrimination as well as overt signs,
Madison replied, "We will be interested in looking at all
employment practices."
Madison emphasized that he did not see that the
money spent in implementing the Affirmative Action
program was the crucial issue. "We will look at the
Program and see whether it is a viable plan. If it isn't, we'll
proceed from there. If it is viable, we'll take a look at how
successfully it's been implemented."
"I just do not see that the amount of money spent is
indicative of the effectiveness of the Plan. A great deal of
money could be spent without achieving results. We're
interested in results," he added.
"When we do begin the investigation we will be
interested in all levels of employment—academic, which
includes professors and administrators, and non-academic,
clerical workers, secretaries, maids, etc.," Madison
stressed.
Student Discrimination
Madison added that there is a decision pending with
the Secretary of HEW in relation to the necessity of being
a teaching assistant in order to get a degree. If the
Secretary decides that serving as a T.A. is an integral part
of obtaining the Ph.D. degree, then the HEW office will be
interested in doctoral programs.
Madison concluded with the remark, "When we get to
Stanford, we'll go from department to department and
analyze the employment situation in each one."
