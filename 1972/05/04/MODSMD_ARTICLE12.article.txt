## Left, Right Show Similarities

Remarkable similarities can be seen between two opposing groups
in the current Vietnamese conflict. The groups, known to each other
as the warmongering, military-establishment and the unpatriotic,
radical peace demonstrators, each proclaim to be on the side of Peace
and Justice and wish the Vietnamese people to be allowed to live
according to their own choosing.
Also, each of these groups is opposed to a warmongering group
that appears to be forcing destruction and repression upon the
Vietnamese people (the first opposes the North Vietnamese and the
second the military establishment). Furthermore, each group uses
destructive tactics to achieve its end (guns and bombs on the one
hand, rocks and firebombs on the other).
In addition, their recent tactics have been proven ineffective in the
1960's (i.e., bombing North Vietnam to stop infiltration and staging
violent demonstrations to win support for peace).
With so great a similarity in their stated ideals and tactics used, it is

puzzling that both groups arc so opposed to each other. Yet, perhaps
the two would find themselves supporting each other had they chosen
means which corresponded more closely to their ends. Bombing for
Peace, like killing for God, seems to characterize people who are so
passionately caught up by an ideal that they fail to give that ideal the
sense of immediacy which it needs to find itself realized in our present
lives.
Employing violent tactics which are known to be ineffective can
only be understood as irrational displays of outrage and power. The
present seems to continue indefinitely and means pass on into other
means. Idealized ends must become part of the present or forever
linger in an unborn future. If we live violently, whatever we call it
(and 110 matter whose side we're on) it is still violence; if we want
Peace, we will only find it by showing the effectiveness of peaceful
means.
