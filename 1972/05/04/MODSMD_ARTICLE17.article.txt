# Good But Unbalanced
## 
### DAVID WILLIAMS 
One never realizes how delicate
the balances in a musical program
are until the program is, at the last
minute, changed and the old
balances are replaced, hopefully,
with new ones. I had indeed
looked forward to the
Levine-Gutierrez collaboration
with the San Francisco Symphony
last Wednesday, which promised
the Berlioz Cosair Overture,
Penderecki's AnaUlasis, the
Schumann Concerto for piano and
orchestra in A minor, and the
Tschaikowsky Symphony No. 4.
Imagine my disappointment when
I discovered that the most subtle
of Romantic piano concert! had
been replaced by the most
obvious, the Lizst Concerto No. 1.
Though the soloist had
apparently wounded his hand and
was entitled to change the
program to suit a new situation,
this work of Liszt demands

brilliance only because it has
become a cliche, and it is
supremely difficult to wring
meaning out of those tired
phrases, which even in Liszt's own
day were compared unfavorably
to those of the Chopin concerti.
As it happened, Gutierrez took
a strange tact with the concerto,
attempting to hide its brashness
behind liquid phrases and lots of
legato. 1 don't think it worked;
several passages which had not yet
bored me because they had always
seemed at least outrageously
flashy were simply very dull,
though Gutierrez's arpeggios are
really astoundingly smooth. The
orchestra seemed totally
uninspired, and one looked
forward to the Tschaikowsky with
certain misgivings.
As it was, The Berlioz Corsaire,
one of the master's lighter more
eighteenth-century constructions,
built out of half themes entwined
around a rather substantial one,
was played to perfection. Levine
at one point lifted his arm to elicit
from the violins a crescendo as
beautiful as could be imagined.
The Penderecki Anhlasis,
whose title has been described as
meaning both lamentation and
"refraction," was composed in
1960, and while not one of the
young Polish composer's most
astounding compositions, is a
delightful essay in tone and mood.
One is hardly impressed by
lamentation in this rather
small-scale work, instead one finds
oneself following the melodic
lines to their clearly delineated
"ultimate conclusions." The
orchestra was very well rehearsed

for this one, and another West
Coast premier could be accounted
a notable success. Levine was in
fine form, and while he is quite
young his talents as a
disciplinarian were happily in
evidence.
I don't see how anyone could
complain about the performance
of the Tschaikowsky symphony,
except that the work that
preceded it on this occasion is
hardly an invitation to hear more
nineteenth-century music.
Levine's handling of the
opening movement, Andante
sostemuto; moderato con anima
in movimento di valse, was
nothing less than magnificent.
Barring some harsh notes from the
horns in the opening bars, the
orchestra was in fine form
throughout this the most elegant
of Tschaikowsky's symphonies.
The long first movement is a
spring-like St. Petersburg piece
filled with strange Moscow-like
overtones, and all of its light but
complex "Russian-ness" was
wonderfully apparent. The
Andantino, apparently a memento
of the composer's ultra-Platonic
affair with Madame Von Meek,
was smoothly played.
The Scherzo, "Pizzicato
ostinato," allegro was deliciously
picked, and finale brilliantly
played and conducted. Because of
Levine and the finely-tuned
orchestra, all of those marvelous
changes of rhythm and dramatic
changes of key seemed to make
perfect sense. It was an awfully
good performance, enough to
make me forget my initial
disappointment.

with new ones. I had indeed
looked forward to the
Levine-Gutierrez collaboration
with the San Francisco Symphony
last Wednesday, which promised
the Berlioz Cosair Overture,
Penderecki's AnaUlasis, the
Schumann Concerto for piano and
orchestra in A minor, and the
Tschaikowsky Symphony No. 4.
Imagine my disappointment when
I discovered that the most subtle
of Romantic piano concert! had
been replaced by the most
obvious, the Lizst Concerto No. 1.
Though the soloist had
apparently wounded his hand and
was entitled to change the
program to suit a new situation,
this work of Liszt demands

brilliance only because it has
become a cliche, and it is
supremely difficult to wring
meaning out of those tired
phrases, which even in Liszt's own
day were compared unfavorably
to those of the Chopin concerti.
As it happened, Gutierrez took
a strange tact with the concerto,
attempting to hide its brashness
behind liquid phrases and lots of
legato. 1 don't think it worked;
several passages which had not yet
bored me because they had always
seemed at least outrageously
flashy were simply very dull,
though Gutierrez's arpeggios are
really astoundingly smooth. The
orchestra seemed totally
uninspired, and one looked
forward to the Tschaikowsky with
certain misgivings.
As it was, The Berlioz Corsaire,
one of the master's lighter more
eighteenth-century constructions,
built out of half themes entwined
around a rather substantial one,
was played to perfection. Levine
at one point lifted his arm to elicit
from the violins a crescendo as
beautiful as could be imagined.
The Penderecki Anhlasis,
whose title has been described as
meaning both lamentation and
"refraction," was composed in
1960, and while not one of the
young Polish composer's most
astounding compositions, is a
delightful essay in tone and mood.
One is hardly impressed by
lamentation in this rather
small-scale work, instead one finds
oneself following the melodic
lines to their clearly delineated
"ultimate conclusions." The
orchestra was very well rehearsed

for this one, and another West
Coast premier could be accounted
a notable success. Levine was in
fine form, and while he is quite
young his talents as a
disciplinarian were happily in
evidence.
I don't see how anyone could
complain about the performance
of the Tschaikowsky symphony,
except that the work that
preceded it on this occasion is
hardly an invitation to hear more
nineteenth-century music.
Levine's handling of the
opening movement, Andante
sostemuto; moderato con anima
in movimento di valse, was
nothing less than magnificent.
Barring some harsh notes from the
horns in the opening bars, the
orchestra was in fine form
throughout this the most elegant
of Tschaikowsky's symphonies.
The long first movement is a
spring-like St. Petersburg piece
filled with strange Moscow-like
overtones, and all of its light but
complex "Russian-ness" was
wonderfully apparent. The
Andantino, apparently a memento
of the composer's ultra-Platonic
affair with Madame Von Meek,
was smoothly played.
The Scherzo, "Pizzicato
ostinato," allegro was deliciously
picked, and finale brilliantly
played and conducted. Because of
Levine and the finely-tuned
orchestra, all of those marvelous
changes of rhythm and dramatic
changes of key seemed to make
perfect sense. It was an awfully
good performance, enough to
make me forget my initial
disappointment.

the balances in a musical program
are until the program is, at the last
minute, changed and the old
balances are replaced, hopefully,
with new ones. I had indeed
