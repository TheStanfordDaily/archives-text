# Greco Exudes Grace
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
Jose Greco and his dancers performed with Nana
Lorca and her Flamenco Dance Theater on Saturday
night at the Masonic Auditorium in San Francisco.
The dancing was some of the best flamenco dancing
I've seen; the dancers managed to draw a
comfortable balance between the showy forceful
quality of traditional flamenco dance and the
subtler movements of the ballet-influenced
flamenco dance.
I went into this performance and took no notes
and still feel I did the right thing, because this was
one of the more colorful and exciting evenings of
dance that I have enjoyed.
The first dance to catch my eye was a rhythmic
and melodic dance popular in the 19th century,
called "El Polo", danced by Jose Greco in solo. He
wore an olive green tight-fitting matador-like
costume, and danced with the majesty of a prince.
In this dance and throughout the rest of the
performance, he showed himself to be indubitably
the true master. Though his dancers all had their
own individual grace, my eye was always drawn
towards him in those moments when he was on
stage.
The fourth dance, "Varaciones Madrilenas" was
one of the evening's most magnificent pieces. All
the dancers wore royal costumes in rich colors of
red, green, purple and light purple. In the second
part of the dance, Juan Manuel performed an
astounding solo of castinets and quick
foot-movments and consequently brought the
audience to a high pitch of applause.
Sustained Excitement
At the end of the dance, Jose Greco and Nana
Lorco joined with the rest of the company in the
"Intermezzo from the Zarzuela". This dance had

sustained excitement throughout. Several times we
were almost sure the dance was going to end, but
just as the dance reached a crucial culmination, the
dancers would break out into the regular rhythms of
the previous choreography. However, when they did
finally reach the end, they ended so abruptly that
the audience's surprise showed itself in sudden loud
and enthusiastic clapping.
During the second half of the performance, Jose
Greco and Nana Lorco danced in a duet piece called
"Los Amantes de Sierra Morena". This dance
particularly fascinated me because it captured all
the subtleties of flamenco dancing. It centered
around the flirtations between a man and a woman.
Greco and Lorco performed the slow suggestive
movements of the hips, wrists, and arms with
sensitivity and a great deal of control. They both
have great stage presence individually, and together,
they rank near the top.
In the last dance, to quote the playbill, "The
entire company evokes all the uninhibited emotions
of these exciting dances and songs that have become
so popular throughout the world." We really got a
sense of Mexico and its people because during this
dance, the dancers were joined by musicians who
played guitar and sing in the background. This
dance was so successful that at the end, the
company was called back for several bows and an
encore, which they performed with more gusto than
any other dance in the performance.
The audience seemed more alive than it was for
Jose Molina's performance of flamenco dancing in
the Masonic Auditorium two weeks ago. Somehow,
unlike Molina, Greco was able to bridge the gap
created between performer and audience in that
huge rather impersonal auditorium. His company
should not be missed on their next tour.

I went into this performance and took no notes
and still feel I did the right thing, because this was
one of the more colorful and exciting evenings of
dance that I have enjoyed.
The first dance to catch my eye was a rhythmic
and melodic dance popular in the 19th century,
called "El Polo", danced by Jose Greco in solo. He
wore an olive green tight-fitting matador-like
costume, and danced with the majesty of a prince.
In this dance and throughout the rest of the
performance, he showed himself to be indubitably
the true master. Though his dancers all had their
own individual grace, my eye was always drawn
towards him in those moments when he was on
stage.
The fourth dance, "Varaciones Madrilenas" was
one of the evening's most magnificent pieces. All
the dancers wore royal costumes in rich colors of
red, green, purple and light purple. In the second
part of the dance, Juan Manuel performed an
astounding solo of castinets and quick
foot-movments and consequently brought the
audience to a high pitch of applause.
Sustained Excitement
At the end of the dance, Jose Greco and Nana
Lorco joined with the rest of the company in the
"Intermezzo from the Zarzuela". This dance had

sustained excitement throughout. Several times we
were almost sure the dance was going to end, but
just as the dance reached a crucial culmination, the
dancers would break out into the regular rhythms of
the previous choreography. However, when they did
finally reach the end, they ended so abruptly that
the audience's surprise showed itself in sudden loud
and enthusiastic clapping.
During the second half of the performance, Jose
Greco and Nana Lorco danced in a duet piece called
"Los Amantes de Sierra Morena". This dance
particularly fascinated me because it captured all
the subtleties of flamenco dancing. It centered
around the flirtations between a man and a woman.
Greco and Lorco performed the slow suggestive
movements of the hips, wrists, and arms with
sensitivity and a great deal of control. They both
have great stage presence individually, and together,
they rank near the top.
In the last dance, to quote the playbill, "The
entire company evokes all the uninhibited emotions
of these exciting dances and songs that have become
so popular throughout the world." We really got a
sense of Mexico and its people because during this
dance, the dancers were joined by musicians who
played guitar and sing in the background. This
dance was so successful that at the end, the
company was called back for several bows and an
encore, which they performed with more gusto than
any other dance in the performance.
The audience seemed more alive than it was for
Jose Molina's performance of flamenco dancing in
the Masonic Auditorium two weeks ago. Somehow,
unlike Molina, Greco was able to bridge the gap
created between performer and audience in that
huge rather impersonal auditorium. His company
should not be missed on their next tour.
Jose Greco and his dancers performed with Nana
Lorca and her Flamenco Dance Theater on Saturday
night at the Masonic Auditorium in San Francisco.
The dancing was some of the best flamenco dancing
I've seen; the dancers managed to draw a
comfortable balance between the showy forceful
quality of traditional flamenco dance and the
subtler movements of the ballet-influenced
flamenco dance.
