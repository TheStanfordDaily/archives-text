Humphrey Holds Ohio Lead
COLUMBUS, Ohio - Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey narrowly
defeated Sen. George S. McGovern early today in the
trouble-plauged Ohio primary election for the state's 38
at-large Democratic National Convention delegate votes.
McGovern, however, made a strong showing in
congressional district contests for delegates.
With 86 percent of Ohio's 12,648 polling places
tabulated, the secretary of state's office said Humphrey's
at-large slate had 412,707, while McGovern's slate had
391,976.
In Cuyahoga County Cleveland, where voting problems
and two resulting court suits Tuesday raised a cloud over
the election, 95 percent of the polling places had been
tabulated at 12:30 a.m. EDT and Humphrey led 89,073
to McGovern's 87,427.
McGovern had needed a strong surge in the Cleveland
area to overtake the statewide Humphrey advantage,
which had been slowly but steadily growing through the
night.
So, McGovern appeared en route to capturing a sizable
number of the congressional district delegates, who make
up the remainder of the state's 153-member delegation.
Based on slate voting tabulations, McGovern led in 13
districts with 64 delegates, Humphrey led the at-large
field, plus eight districts with 38 delegates, for a total of
76.
Local favorite son candidates were leading for the
other 13 delegates.
The voting was close enough in most of the district
races to raise the possibility that split ticket votes could
alter or divide the outcome.
(»iiii Salesman Testifies
SAN JOSE — A gun salesman testified yesterday he sold
Angela Davis a Spanish-made shotgun two days before it
was used to blast a judge's head in a Marin County
courthouse escape attempt in which the judge and three
other men died.
"I asked what she wanted," said salesman Frank
Blumenthal. "She asked to purchase a shotgun. I showed
her a couple. She wanted something inexpensive."
Blumenthal said Davis came into his San Francisco
pawnshop at 5 p.m. on Aug. 5, 1970. This was just 42
hours before the shootout. He said she was accompanied
by "a young Negro gentleman" whose description
matched that of Jonathan Jackson, subsequently slain in
the shootout.
Defense attorney Leo Branton formally agreed that
Davis did buy the shotgun that day. The witness —
holding in his hands the sawed-off shotgun used to shoot
Judge Harold Haley — said, "It looks the same." He
identified the serial number as the one on the gun he sold.
He said Davis paid cash — $35. He said he thinks she
purchased a box of shotgun shells, too.
Earlier, a blonde witness from Kansas said she had a
"warm and close" relationship with Jonathan Jackson and
loaned him a car three days before the shootout.
Mabel Magers, 33, frowning and answering mostly in
monosyllables, said she didn't see her car again until after
Jackson, 17, was dead.
JMixon Names Acting FBI Head
WASHINGTON — President Nixon sidestepped a possible
election-year battle over replacing J. Edgar Hoover by
naming an old friend and aide to be acting FBI director
yesterday.
The White House said Asst. Attv Gen. L. Patrick Gray
111 will serve at least until after the Nov. 7 balloting.
Nixon was described as anxious to keep the directorship
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation out of partisan
politics.
As an acting appointee, Gray will not be subject to

Senate confirmation which would be required for a
regular appointment.
In choosing Gray, the President bypassed a number of
Hoover aides to select a Navy-educated lawyer with no
law-enforcement experience. A retired Navy captain, Gray
served eight years as special assistant to the then Vice
President Nixon during the Eisenhower administration.
Receiving an honor bestowed on few, J.Edgar Hoover
lay in the Capitol Rotunda yesterday, a flag on his coffin
and a wreath from his President at his feet. Some of the
highest officials of the land assembled to pay tribute to
the memory of the man who directed the FBI for 48
years.
President Nixon will deliver the eulogy in the funeral
services today.
Mine Disaster Search Begins
KELLOGG, Idaho — As pumps sent tons of air
underground, rescue workers began probing the hot,
smoky shafts of the Sunshine silver mine yesterday in
search of more than 50 miners missing in a fire that killed
at least 24 other men.
Mine officials said 58 men were unaccounted for; 108
others escaped to safety soon after the fire broke out in
the nation's richest silver mine shortly after noon
Tuesday.
Miami Bids For GOP Convention
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — The Miami Beach City Council
agreed by a single vote yesterday to submit a $350,000
bid for the 1972 Republican National Convention. A GOP
official said he expected the party would switch the site
from San Diego, Calif.
Richard Herman, in charge of convention arrangements
for the GOP, said the Republucan National Committee's
arrangements committee would meet Thursday in
Washington, with the full committee meeting Friday.
Concerned that a massive influx of demonstrators
would threaten peace in the resort city, the council also
urged the federal government to provide an elite
1000-member "convention peace corps."
State Committee Axes IQT ests
SACRAMENTO — IQ tests would no longer be required
for sixth and 12th graders in California public schools
under a new testing proposal endorsed by a key Assembly
committee Tuesday.
The bill by Democratic Assemblyman Leroy Greene,
chairman of the Assembly Education Committee, was sent
to the Assembly floor on a 16-0 vote by the Assembly
Ways and Means Committee.
In place of IQ tests, the schools would be required to
give new first graders tests intended to find out what they
already know, so that what they learn can be measured
better later.
SHI Reports Income
PALO ALTO — Stanford Research Institute yesterday
reported a gross income of more than $66 million for
1971, the highest in the non-profit research corporation's
history.
Gross profits for 1971 totaled $66,046,000, with a net
income of $51,000. The net would have been higher, said
SRI officials, but for a $529,000 payment made to
Stanford University as a result of the legal separation in
1970 of the two institutions.
SRI, which has been the target of student
demonstrations, does about 40 percent of its research
work for the Department of Defense, but served more
than 2000 clients in ogvernment and industry during
1971.

SACRAMENTO — IQ tests would no longer be required

The bill by Democratic Assemblyman Leroy Greene,

In place of IQ tests, the schools would be required to

SHI Reports Income
PALO ALTO — Stanford Research Institute yesterday
reported a gross income of more than $66 million for
1971, the highest in the non-profit research corporation's
history.
Gross profits for 1971 totaled $66,046,000, with a net
income of $51,000. The net would have been higher, said
SRI officials, but for a $529,000 payment made to
Stanford University as a result of the legal separation in
1970 of the two institutions.
SRI, which has been the target of student
demonstrations, does about 40 percent of its research
work for the Department of Defense, but served more
than 2000 clients in ogvernment and industry during
1971.

Humphrey Holds Ohio Lead
COLUMBUS, Ohio - Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey narrowly
defeated Sen. George S. McGovern early today in the
trouble-plauged Ohio primary election for the state's 38
at-large Democratic National Convention delegate votes.
McGovern, however, made a strong showing in
congressional district contests for delegates.
With 86 percent of Ohio's 12,648 polling places
tabulated, the secretary of state's office said Humphrey's
at-large slate had 412,707, while McGovern's slate had
391,976.
In Cuyahoga County Cleveland, where voting problems
and two resulting court suits Tuesday raised a cloud over
the election, 95 percent of the polling places had been
tabulated at 12:30 a.m. EDT and Humphrey led 89,073
to McGovern's 87,427.
McGovern had needed a strong surge in the Cleveland
area to overtake the statewide Humphrey advantage,
which had been slowly but steadily growing through the
night.
So, McGovern appeared en route to capturing a sizable
number of the congressional district delegates, who make
up the remainder of the state's 153-member delegation.
Based on slate voting tabulations, McGovern led in 13
districts with 64 delegates, Humphrey led the at-large
field, plus eight districts with 38 delegates, for a total of
76.
Local favorite son candidates were leading for the
other 13 delegates.
The voting was close enough in most of the district
races to raise the possibility that split ticket votes could
alter or divide the outcome.
(»iiii Salesman Testifies
SAN JOSE — A gun salesman testified yesterday he sold
Angela Davis a Spanish-made shotgun two days before it
was used to blast a judge's head in a Marin County
courthouse escape attempt in which the judge and three
other men died.
"I asked what she wanted," said salesman Frank
Blumenthal. "She asked to purchase a shotgun. I showed
her a couple. She wanted something inexpensive."
Blumenthal said Davis came into his San Francisco
pawnshop at 5 p.m. on Aug. 5, 1970. This was just 42
hours before the shootout. He said she was accompanied
by "a young Negro gentleman" whose description
matched that of Jonathan Jackson, subsequently slain in
the shootout.
Defense attorney Leo Branton formally agreed that
Davis did buy the shotgun that day. The witness —
holding in his hands the sawed-off shotgun used to shoot
Judge Harold Haley — said, "It looks the same." He
identified the serial number as the one on the gun he sold.
He said Davis paid cash — $35. He said he thinks she
purchased a box of shotgun shells, too.
Earlier, a blonde witness from Kansas said she had a
"warm and close" relationship with Jonathan Jackson and
loaned him a car three days before the shootout.
Mabel Magers, 33, frowning and answering mostly in
monosyllables, said she didn't see her car again until after
Jackson, 17, was dead.
JMixon Names Acting FBI Head
WASHINGTON — President Nixon sidestepped a possible
election-year battle over replacing J. Edgar Hoover by
naming an old friend and aide to be acting FBI director
yesterday.
The White House said Asst. Attv Gen. L. Patrick Gray
111 will serve at least until after the Nov. 7 balloting.
Nixon was described as anxious to keep the directorship
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation out of partisan
politics.
As an acting appointee, Gray will not be subject to

Senate confirmation which would be required for a
regular appointment.
In choosing Gray, the President bypassed a number of
Hoover aides to select a Navy-educated lawyer with no
law-enforcement experience. A retired Navy captain, Gray
served eight years as special assistant to the then Vice
President Nixon during the Eisenhower administration.
Receiving an honor bestowed on few, J.Edgar Hoover
lay in the Capitol Rotunda yesterday, a flag on his coffin
and a wreath from his President at his feet. Some of the
highest officials of the land assembled to pay tribute to
the memory of the man who directed the FBI for 48
years.
President Nixon will deliver the eulogy in the funeral
services today.

Mine Disaster Search Begins
KELLOGG, Idaho — As pumps sent tons of air
underground, rescue workers began probing the hot,
smoky shafts of the Sunshine silver mine yesterday in
search of more than 50 miners missing in a fire that killed
at least 24 other men.
Mine officials said 58 men were unaccounted for; 108
others escaped to safety soon after the fire broke out in
the nation's richest silver mine shortly after noon
Tuesday.
Miami Bids For GOP Convention
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — The Miami Beach City Council
agreed by a single vote yesterday to submit a $350,000
bid for the 1972 Republican National Convention. A GOP
official said he expected the party would switch the site
from San Diego, Calif.
Richard Herman, in charge of convention arrangements
for the GOP, said the Republucan National Committee's
arrangements committee would meet Thursday in
Washington, with the full committee meeting Friday.
Concerned that a massive influx of demonstrators
would threaten peace in the resort city, the council also
urged the federal government to provide an elite
1000-member "convention peace corps."
State Committee Axes IQT ests
SACRAMENTO — IQ tests would no longer be required
for sixth and 12th graders in California public schools
under a new testing proposal endorsed by a key Assembly
committee Tuesday.
The bill by Democratic Assemblyman Leroy Greene,
chairman of the Assembly Education Committee, was sent
to the Assembly floor on a 16-0 vote by the Assembly
Ways and Means Committee.
In place of IQ tests, the schools would be required to
give new first graders tests intended to find out what they
already know, so that what they learn can be measured
better later.
SHI Reports Income
PALO ALTO — Stanford Research Institute yesterday
reported a gross income of more than $66 million for
1971, the highest in the non-profit research corporation's
history.
Gross profits for 1971 totaled $66,046,000, with a net
income of $51,000. The net would have been higher, said
SRI officials, but for a $529,000 payment made to
Stanford University as a result of the legal separation in
1970 of the two institutions.
SRI, which has been the target of student
demonstrations, does about 40 percent of its research
work for the Department of Defense, but served more
than 2000 clients in ogvernment and industry during
1971.

Humphrey Holds Ohio Lead
COLUMBUS, Ohio - Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey narrowly
defeated Sen. George S. McGovern early today in the
trouble-plauged Ohio primary election for the state's 38
at-large Democratic National Convention delegate votes.
McGovern, however, made a strong showing in
congressional district contests for delegates.
With 86 percent of Ohio's 12,648 polling places
tabulated, the secretary of state's office said Humphrey's
at-large slate had 412,707, while McGovern's slate had
391,976.
In Cuyahoga County Cleveland, where voting problems
and two resulting court suits Tuesday raised a cloud over
the election, 95 percent of the polling places had been
tabulated at 12:30 a.m. EDT and Humphrey led 89,073
to McGovern's 87,427.
McGovern had needed a strong surge in the Cleveland
area to overtake the statewide Humphrey advantage,
which had been slowly but steadily growing through the
night.
So, McGovern appeared en route to capturing a sizable
number of the congressional district delegates, who make
up the remainder of the state's 153-member delegation.
Based on slate voting tabulations, McGovern led in 13
districts with 64 delegates, Humphrey led the at-large
field, plus eight districts with 38 delegates, for a total of
76.
Local favorite son candidates were leading for the
other 13 delegates.
The voting was close enough in most of the district
races to raise the possibility that split ticket votes could
alter or divide the outcome.
(»iiii Salesman Testifies
SAN JOSE — A gun salesman testified yesterday he sold
Angela Davis a Spanish-made shotgun two days before it
was used to blast a judge's head in a Marin County
courthouse escape attempt in which the judge and three
other men died.
"I asked what she wanted," said salesman Frank
Blumenthal. "She asked to purchase a shotgun. I showed
her a couple. She wanted something inexpensive."
Blumenthal said Davis came into his San Francisco
pawnshop at 5 p.m. on Aug. 5, 1970. This was just 42
hours before the shootout. He said she was accompanied
by "a young Negro gentleman" whose description
matched that of Jonathan Jackson, subsequently slain in
the shootout.
Defense attorney Leo Branton formally agreed that
Davis did buy the shotgun that day. The witness —
holding in his hands the sawed-off shotgun used to shoot
Judge Harold Haley — said, "It looks the same." He
identified the serial number as the one on the gun he sold.
He said Davis paid cash — $35. He said he thinks she
purchased a box of shotgun shells, too.
Earlier, a blonde witness from Kansas said she had a
"warm and close" relationship with Jonathan Jackson and
loaned him a car three days before the shootout.
Mabel Magers, 33, frowning and answering mostly in
monosyllables, said she didn't see her car again until after
Jackson, 17, was dead.
JMixon Names Acting FBI Head
WASHINGTON — President Nixon sidestepped a possible
election-year battle over replacing J. Edgar Hoover by
naming an old friend and aide to be acting FBI director
yesterday.
The White House said Asst. Attv Gen. L. Patrick Gray
111 will serve at least until after the Nov. 7 balloting.
Nixon was described as anxious to keep the directorship
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation out of partisan
politics.
As an acting appointee, Gray will not be subject to

Senate confirmation which would be required for a
regular appointment.
In choosing Gray, the President bypassed a number of
Hoover aides to select a Navy-educated lawyer with no
law-enforcement experience. A retired Navy captain, Gray
served eight years as special assistant to the then Vice
President Nixon during the Eisenhower administration.
