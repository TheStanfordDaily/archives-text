# Human Relations Commission
## Brutality Probe To Begin 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
Palo Alto Police Chief James C.
Zurcher and City Manager George A.
Sipel opened an investigation last week
to determine the validity of charges of
police brutality during peace marches
and demonstrations on Friday April
21.
Zurcher claims that every com
plaint will be examined separately and
that "appropriate action" will be
taken against policemen, if warranted.
The decision to open the investiga
tion was prompted by a disturbance
during the City Council meeting held
on April 24th, when several young
people, including Palo Alto high
school students and some Stanford
students, interrupted the meeting to
cite a number of cases of alleged police
misconduct.
Council members and the Mayor
remained for over an hour, after
Mayor Kirke W. Comstock adjourned
the meeting, to talk to the young
persons.
Committee
The city has appointed a six
member investigation committee, con
sisting of three members of the Human
Relations Commission (HRC), John
Zenger, Alphonso Cross, and Grace
McAllester; and three members of the
City Youth Advisory Council, A 1 Bay,
Carina Chiang, and Lin Miller.
Councilwoman Eileen Hancock was
to be a member of the committee, but
she abruptly announced her resigna
tion from her position as chairman of
the Human Relations Commission on

Tuesday. • Hancock would only state
that her reasons for resigning were
"not something 1 want to hash out on
paper."
The Committee met tor the tirsi
time on Monday night, but two
members were absent, so the commit
tee adjourned without conducting any
real business.
The committee viewed a police
video tape taken at the Town and
Country Shopping Center after the 'El
Camino 205' had been arrested.
Officer Bill Butler, Pat Maloney and
Lieutenant Bullerjahn of the Palo Alto
Police Department are also assisting
the committee. Maloney and Officer
Butler have interviewed about 24
students so far, as well as 77 members
of the Town and Country Shopping
Center business community.
Interviews
Maloney intends to interview any
and all witnesses of the El Camino
incident that are willing to talk to her.
She also stated her desire that students
who took pictures of the events bring
them to her. "All we have to go on
now are police pictures and I think
that's a rather biased source," she said.
Lieutenant Bullerjahn stated that
business so far has been concerned
with what procedural methods are to
be used in gathering information. He
also stated that the amount of police
information that can be released to the
public, without interfering with the
trials of those arrested, was an issue
being discussed by the committee.
Stanford freshman Ken Zwick of

Donner House is also collecting wit
ness statements and pictures about
acts of alleged police brutality.
Zwick has received roughly 35
complaints from students so far
stemming from the El Camino arrests.
Odds Not Good
He concedes that "the odds are not
very good that we are going to be able
to press charges against individual
policemen on most incidents. How
ever, I plan to talk with lawyers about
the reports of police cars that were
apparently attempting to run people
down in the fields of El Camino and
Galvez Street."
Chasing
One witness statement given to
Zwick by law student Michael Gold
stein describes the police car chasing
incident in detail: "I heard tires squeal
behind me and saw a marked sheriff's
car leave the road and accelerate into
the grove ... The driver accelerated to
30 or 40 miles an hour and started
driving crazily through the grove,
aiming directly at pairs and trios of
demonstrators and driving straight at
them. On each pass the car drove
directly at people at relatively high
speeds. I am convinced that anyone
who had tripped or fallen while
running could have been hit."
Similar statements describing the
action of a police car were given to
Zwick by students Lise Braden,
Reynold Wiggins, Ric Foreman, Char
les White and Susan Allison. Donner
House Associate Karl Essig claims to
have been pursued by a police car also.
In a letter to the Daily printed last
week, Junior Jeanne Blarney described
her experience of having to hide
behind trees to avoid being hit by a
sheriff's car.
Freshman Melody Broadbent of
Cardenal House maintains that she
overheard a policeman shout "ap
parently to the motorists on El
Camino and Galvez, 'if they don't get
out of your way run them over'."
Consideration
Another freshman stated that he
had seen one riot-equipped policeman
draw his gun while chasing one
demonstrator, but after a moment of
consideration he reholstered it.
Other cited grievances concerning
police misconduct include complaints
that those arrested were unnecessarily
kept on buses for several hours
without food, water, or opportunities
to use a telephone or toilet. Also
mentioned frequently was the fact
that most of those arrested were never
informed of their legal rights.

very good that we are going to be able
to press charges against individual
policemen on most incidents. How
ever, I plan to talk with lawyers about
the reports of police cars that were
apparently attempting to run people
down in the fields of El Camino and
Galvez Street."
Chasing
One witness statement given to
Zwick by law student Michael Gold
stein describes the police car chasing
incident in detail: "I heard tires squeal
behind me and saw a marked sheriff's
car leave the road and accelerate into
the grove ... The driver accelerated to
30 or 40 miles an hour and started
driving crazily through the grove,
aiming directly at pairs and trios of
demonstrators and driving straight at
them. On each pass the car drove
directly at people at relatively high
speeds. I am convinced that anyone
who had tripped or fallen while
running could have been hit."
Similar statements describing the
action of a police car were given to
Zwick by students Lise Braden,
Reynold Wiggins, Ric Foreman, Char
les White and Susan Allison. Donner
House Associate Karl Essig claims to
have been pursued by a police car also.
In a letter to the Daily printed last
week, Junior Jeanne Blarney described
her experience of having to hide
behind trees to avoid being hit by a
sheriff's car.
Freshman Melody Broadbent of
Cardenal House maintains that she
overheard a policeman shout "ap
parently to the motorists on El
Camino and Galvez, 'if they don't get
out of your way run them over'."
Consideration
Another freshman stated that he
had seen one riot-equipped policeman
draw his gun while chasing one
demonstrator, but after a moment of
consideration he reholstered it.
Other cited grievances concerning
police misconduct include complaints
that those arrested were unnecessarily
kept on buses for several hours
without food, water, or opportunities
to use a telephone or toilet. Also
mentioned frequently was the fact
that most of those arrested were never
informed of their legal rights.
Palo Alto Police Chief James C.
Zurcher and City Manager George A.
Sipel opened an investigation last week
to determine the validity of charges of
police brutality during peace marches
and demonstrations on Friday April
21.
Zurcher claims that every com
plaint will be examined separately and
that "appropriate action" will be
taken against policemen, if warranted.
The decision to open the investiga
tion was prompted by a disturbance
during the City Council meeting held
on April 24th, when several young
people, including Palo Alto high
school students and some Stanford
students, interrupted the meeting to
cite a number of cases of alleged police
misconduct.
Council members and the Mayor
remained for over an hour, after
Mayor Kirke W. Comstock adjourned
the meeting, to talk to the young
persons.
Committee
The city has appointed a six
member investigation committee, con
sisting of three members of the Human
Relations Commission (HRC), John
Zenger, Alphonso Cross, and Grace
McAllester; and three members of the
City Youth Advisory Council, A 1 Bay,
Carina Chiang, and Lin Miller.
Councilwoman Eileen Hancock was
to be a member of the committee, but
she abruptly announced her resigna
tion from her position as chairman of
the Human Relations Commission on

Tuesday. • Hancock would only state
that her reasons for resigning were
"not something 1 want to hash out on
paper."
The Committee met tor the tirsi
time on Monday night, but two
members were absent, so the commit
tee adjourned without conducting any
real business.
The committee viewed a police
video tape taken at the Town and
Country Shopping Center after the 'El
Camino 205' had been arrested.
Officer Bill Butler, Pat Maloney and
Lieutenant Bullerjahn of the Palo Alto
Police Department are also assisting
the committee. Maloney and Officer
Butler have interviewed about 24
students so far, as well as 77 members
of the Town and Country Shopping
Center business community.
Interviews
Maloney intends to interview any
and all witnesses of the El Camino
incident that are willing to talk to her.
She also stated her desire that students
who took pictures of the events bring
them to her. "All we have to go on
now are police pictures and I think
that's a rather biased source," she said.
Lieutenant Bullerjahn stated that
business so far has been concerned
with what procedural methods are to
be used in gathering information. He
also stated that the amount of police
information that can be released to the
public, without interfering with the
trials of those arrested, was an issue
being discussed by the committee.
Stanford freshman Ken Zwick of

Donner House is also collecting wit
ness statements and pictures about
acts of alleged police brutality.
Zwick has received roughly 35
complaints from students so far
stemming from the El Camino arrests.
