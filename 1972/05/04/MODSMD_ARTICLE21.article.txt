# Shockley Criticizes Refusal

Electrical Engineering professor
William Shockley charged yesterday
that reports from fellow faculty
members barring credit for a proposed
course on dysgenics misrepresented his
views, ignored substantive issues, and
"clearly reflect a perconception of
results" stemming from his proposal.
Following faculty committee guide
lines and a report from five advisers
unanimously recommending against
credit, Graduate Dean Lincoln Moses
announced Monday he would refuse to
authorize the course, which was
initially proposed by Shockley last
June.
'The most heart-warming line that
I found in the committee reports was
the majority opinion that 'it is
difficult to believe that . . . Stanford
graduate students could be significant
ly poisoned by error on the part of a
professor. . I concur with this
view," Shockley said.
"It is also clear that the committee
hopes that exposure to the students
might even correct my own errors. On
balance, I would be pleased if my

worries could be proven unfounded.
My scientific chagrin at being found
wrong would be more than balanced
by a feeling of relief.
"However, the key issue is truth. In
my opinion, the reports clearly reflect
a preconception of the results that
would come from the type of research
that my graduate special course was
intended to propose, to develop, and
to encourage."
Shockley said the committee review
"did not appraise two substantive
issues that are key items" in his
proposed course. These are 1) whether
individual variations in degree of
Caucasian ancestry can be estimated
soundly (at a significant level of one
chance in 2000) for American Negro
populations by using Shockley's gener
alization of the Hardy-Weinberg law of
population genetics, and 2) whether
Caucasian IQ stems 80 percent or
more from genetic factors and less
than 15 percent from environmental
factors, as gauged by studies of
identical twins reared separately.
