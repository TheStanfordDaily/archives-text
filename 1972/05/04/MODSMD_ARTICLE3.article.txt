# North Vietnamese Continue Advance; National Moratorium Planned Today
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
The Saigon government changed
commanders in the far northern
provinces yesterday in hopes of
stemming the onslaught of the North
Vietnamese. Lt. Gen. Hoang Xuam
Lam was relieved of duty by President
Nguyen Van Thieu and replaced with
Lt. Gen. Ngo Quang Truong, due to
the rout at Quang Tri Monday.
Meanwhile a nationwide morator
ium is scheduled today to protest the
increased United States involvement in
Indochina.
Today was chosen specifically to
commemorate the Kent State, Jackson
State, and Augusta killings of May
1970.
A second commander Brig. Gen. Vu
Van Giai was also relieved as comman
der of the 3rd Infantry Division; the
one trounced at Quang Tri.

The fall of Quang Tri led to the
North Vietnamese advance on Hue,
the old imperial capital 32 miles to the
south, where there has been fighting
only six miles from the city. Yesterday
the North Vietnamese overran Fire
Base Nancy, the last defense line in
Quang Tri Province, 20 miles north
west of Hue.
UPI reporter Stewart Kellerman
described "gangs of drunken, leader
less troops" from the 3rd Division
roaming the city of Hue "looting and
burning."
Major Defeat
Saigon suffered another major de
feat in Binh Dinh Province in the
coastal highlands near Qui Nhon, 220
miles south of Hue and 325 miles
northeast of Saigon, where the North
Vietnamese swept over Landing Zone
English, the last of four bases in the
northern third of the province.
In an effort to stop the North
Vietnamese drive, U.S. planes for the
second consecutive day carried out
more than 600 strikes in the four
military regions of South Vietnam.
Moratorium activities at Stanford
began last night with an 8 p.m. rally in
White Plaza, renamed Quang Tri for
the occasion. Featured speakers were
fired English professor H. Bruce
Franklin and Ramparts magazine writ
er Banning Garrett.
After the rally, some members of
the crowd of about 100 people
planned to camp in White Plaza
overnight.
Today's Activities
Today's activities begin at 7 a.m.
with picketing of various places
including the Physical Plant, the Steam
Plant, the Library where workers have
indicated some support for the mora
torium.
At 9:30 a.m. a memorial service is
scheduled to take place in Memorial
Church for the Vietnamese dead as
well as for those slain at Kent State,
Jackson State, and Augusta.
At 10:00 a.m. B. Davie Napier,
former Dean of the Chapel, will
address the assembly followed by a
convocation on the war to be led by
Economics professor John Gurley,
History professor Barton J. Bernstein,
and Alan Cox of the Vietnam Veterans
for Peace.

Also at 10 a.m., Nobel Peace Prize
winner and Chemistry professor Linus
Pauling will be answering questions at
the Law School Patio behind the Law
School on the re-escalation of the war.
At noon, there will be another rally
in White Plaza, at which Franklin will
speak again, to determine what actions
will be taken in the afternoon. There
will also be some guerilla theater.
More Military Aid
It was learned that Defense Secre
tary Melvin Laird has ordered a
top-level team of logistics specialists to
Vietnam to determine whether Saigon
needs more American military aid.
Pentagon spokesman Jerry Fried
heim said the group will consider both
Saigon's military needs and what
additional measures may be needed to
protect the remaining U.S. troops.
They will determine what weapons
will be replaced as well as what new
weapons may be needed to counter
"new and sophisticated Soviet wea
pons."
Meanwhile new doubts are being
raised about the effectiveness of the
air war.
"I can't understand it," commented
one Air Force general. "Tanks are not
supposed to survive against th' - ivind of
attack we use, with rackets and
forward air controllers to spot targets
and direct the strikes."
An important session of the Paris
Peace Talks was scheduled for today
amid charges by a Paris newspaper that
secret contacts between the U.S. and
North Vietnam were already under
way.
The paper claimed the U.S. had
proposed in a secret meeting that a
seven-day truce be put into effect,
apparently to be followed by a general
cease-fire.
U.S. officials in Paris denied that
there had been any proposal but

would not comment, however, on
reports that secret talks had begun.
Plaza Rally
At the White Plaza rally last night,
Franklin discussed activities on the
east coast during his trip there during
the recent strike.
Declaring that "most universities
have qualitatively much less" political
involvement than Stanford, Franklin
said, "The student movement cannot
bring Socialism to the United States, it
cannot destroy the empire, it cannot
end the war."
Franklin labeled the student
movement as a "catalyst for action for
those people who do not have the
privilege of being students at a
University" like Stanford.
He added that students were
"looked to as the leadership of the
movement... If we show we're
paralized by fear, what do you think
other people will think of us?"
Concerning a rumor that the ROTC
program would be reinstated at
Stanford, Franklin stated, "We ought
to commit ourselves to getting it out
of here before it gets back in." ROTC
officials denied the charge and
maintained that ROTC was being
phased out as planned by June 1973.
In supporting strike action, Garrett
exclaimed, "Let's not dilly-dally
around and see millions more people
killed." He contended, "It is clear
Nixon is in a situation where he either
escalates qr he loses."
An apparent arson fire in Room
218 of the Law School was
extinguished after some damage last
night. Student Josh Cooperman put
out the fire with an extinguisher
before firemen arrived. A roll of
newspapers with candles inside was
found at the scene! Two shelves and a
chair in the Lang reading room were
scorched.

ARSON — Three incendiary devices — apparently candles wrapped ir.
newspapers — were ignited in the Lang Room of the Law School Annex late last
night. The fire was doused by a law student using a chemical fire extinguisher.
Several bookshelves, law volumes and a chair were damaged.
