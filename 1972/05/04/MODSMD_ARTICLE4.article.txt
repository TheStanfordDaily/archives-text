# Wells Fargo Branch
## Bank To Open At Tresidder 
### LARRY HUMMER 
Wells Fargo Bank will open a
branch here in a now uncertain
location in Tresidder Union by next
fall.
Wells Fargo was chosen over five
other banks who submitted proposals
to the University partly because of the
bank's close ties to Stanford.
The bank will provide check-cash
ing services for all members of the
community, whether or not they have
Wells Fargo accounts. It will also offer
extended teller hours (9 a.m. to 5
p.m.), unlimited student check writing
at $3 per quarter, loans, and safe
deposit boxes.
Nine banks were contacted by
University investments manager Rod
ney Adams. The Bank of America and
three others declined to offer pro
posals.
Final Selection
The final selection was between
Wells Fargo and Security National
Bank. Security National may have
been preferred by some committee
members, accordng to ASSU Financial
Manager Tom Huseby, because it is
headed by Fortney H. "Pete" Stark,
an outspoken critic of the Indochina
War. Some committee members also
may have felt that Security's invest
ment policies were more appealing,
Huseby said.
Chuck Peterson, head of the Com
mittee on Tresidder Union (CTU), said
that the committee did not reach this
conclusion, and didn't recommend one
bank or the other. "I did see definite
merits on both sides. Security's total
investment policy is not different from
other banks," Peterson said.
Clost Decision
Adams said that the decision was
close, but tha' the Administration
decided on Wells Fargo because "a
number of the Wells Fargo people are
very active St.- nford fund-raisers. Se
curity Nation? 's interest arose only
when they had an opportunity to open
a bank here."
Ernest C. Arbuckle, Wells Fargo's
chairman, is a Stanford trustee and
former head of the Business School.
Trustee W. Farmer Fuller 111, is also on
the bank's B< ard of Directors.
According to Peterson, there were
"internal reasons why Wells Fargo was
selected." Peterson said Wells' F'argo
would suggest to people that they
name Stanford as beneficiaries in their
trusts and wills. Whether that was
something the bank formally promised
the Univer ity or not, Peterson says,
"Stanford understands that that will

happen."
Location
The exact location of the bank in
Tresidder remains to be decided. Wells
Fargo needs at least 3,000 square feet
and would like 4,000 to allow for
expansion. The University prefers to
put the bank in what is now the
billiards room, but it is only 3,000
square feet. The bank is committed to
taking the billiards room if a better
location cannot be found. The billiards
room, a chronic money-loser, would
be discontinued.
"Basically we wanted the ASSU
office for the exposure," Peter Ham
mond of Wells Fargo told the Daily,
"but we didn't like the idea of having
to move the ASSU."
The CTU yesterday proposed
rooms 274 and 275, above the food
service. It appears the bank will locate
there if structural studies show it can
support a vault and rest rooms.
Rent
The University wants to get as high
a rent from Wells F'argo as possible to
aid Tresidder's sagging financial condi
tion. The prevalent rate for banks in
the surrounding area is $.50 per square

foot, but agreement on the rent is not
expected for two weeks.
It is not at all certain that the bank
will make a profit. United California
Bank made a financial study of the
location and determined that the bank
would operate at a loss. Their request
for guaranteed University deposits
eliminated them from consideration.
Whether Wells Fargo makes money
here or not they will be committed to
continued operation for at least five
years.
The Study of Education at Stan
ford (SES) suggested such a bank in
1968.
Criteria
Criteria for the selection of the
bank were developed by the Commit
tee on Tresidder Union with help from
the Committee on Corporate Respon
sibility at the Business School, and
Rodney Adams.
The criteria asked for "a commit
ment to an affirmative action program
in hiring, salary, administration, and
promotion, including a commitment
to hire students to the greatest extent
possible." Wells Fargo currently has
21.7 percent minority employment.

NEXT WINDOW PLEASE—A Wells Fargo Branch Bank will open somewhere in
Tresidder Union next fall. The bank offices may be located in the ASSU offices,
or in what is now the TMU Billiards Room.
Wells Fargo Bank will open a
branch here in a now uncertain
location in Tresidder Union by next
fall.
Wells Fargo was chosen over five
other banks who submitted proposals
to the University partly because of the
bank's close ties to Stanford.
The bank will provide check-cash
ing services for all members of the
community, whether or not they have
Wells Fargo accounts. It will also offer
extended teller hours (9 a.m. to 5
p.m.), unlimited student check writing
at $3 per quarter, loans, and safe
deposit boxes.
Nine banks were contacted by
University investments manager Rod
ney Adams. The Bank of America and
three others declined to offer pro
posals.
Final Selection
The final selection was between
Wells Fargo and Security National
Bank. Security National may have
been preferred by some committee
members, accordng to ASSU Financial
Manager Tom Huseby, because it is
headed by Fortney H. "Pete" Stark,
an outspoken critic of the Indochina
War. Some committee members also
may have felt that Security's invest
ment policies were more appealing,
Huseby said.
Chuck Peterson, head of the Com
mittee on Tresidder Union (CTU), said
that the committee did not reach this
conclusion, and didn't recommend one
bank or the other. "I did see definite
merits on both sides. Security's total
investment policy is not different from
other banks," Peterson said.
Clost Decision
Adams said that the decision was
close, but tha' the Administration
decided on Wells Fargo because "a
number of the Wells Fargo people are
very active St.- nford fund-raisers. Se
curity Nation? 's interest arose only
when they had an opportunity to open
a bank here."
Ernest C. Arbuckle, Wells Fargo's
chairman, is a Stanford trustee and
former head of the Business School.
Trustee W. Farmer Fuller 111, is also on
the bank's B< ard of Directors.
According to Peterson, there were
"internal reasons why Wells Fargo was
selected." Peterson said Wells' F'argo
would suggest to people that they
name Stanford as beneficiaries in their
trusts and wills. Whether that was
something the bank formally promised
the Univer ity or not, Peterson says,
"Stanford understands that that will

happen."
Location
The exact location of the bank in
Tresidder remains to be decided. Wells
Fargo needs at least 3,000 square feet
and would like 4,000 to allow for
expansion. The University prefers to
put the bank in what is now the
billiards room, but it is only 3,000
square feet. The bank is committed to
taking the billiards room if a better
location cannot be found. The billiards
room, a chronic money-loser, would
be discontinued.
"Basically we wanted the ASSU
office for the exposure," Peter Ham
mond of Wells Fargo told the Daily,
"but we didn't like the idea of having
to move the ASSU."
The CTU yesterday proposed
rooms 274 and 275, above the food
service. It appears the bank will locate
there if structural studies show it can
support a vault and rest rooms.
Rent
The University wants to get as high
a rent from Wells F'argo as possible to
aid Tresidder's sagging financial condi
tion. The prevalent rate for banks in
the surrounding area is $.50 per square

foot, but agreement on the rent is not
expected for two weeks.
It is not at all certain that the bank
will make a profit. United California
Bank made a financial study of the
location and determined that the bank
would operate at a loss. Their request
for guaranteed University deposits
eliminated them from consideration.
Whether Wells Fargo makes money
here or not they will be committed to
continued operation for at least five
years.
The Study of Education at Stan
ford (SES) suggested such a bank in
1968.
Criteria
Criteria for the selection of the
bank were developed by the Commit
tee on Tresidder Union with help from
the Committee on Corporate Respon
sibility at the Business School, and
Rodney Adams.
The criteria asked for "a commit
ment to an affirmative action program
in hiring, salary, administration, and
promotion, including a commitment
to hire students to the greatest extent
possible." Wells Fargo currently has
21.7 percent minority employment.
