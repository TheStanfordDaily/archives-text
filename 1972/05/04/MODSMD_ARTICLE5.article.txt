# Search Committee Recommends 'Thunderchickens' As Mascot
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
The mascot search committee has recommended that
athletic teams in the future be known as the Stanford
Thunderchickens, the Daily has learned.
The committee's decision is subject to approval by the
President's office and the Student Senate. The nine person
body, chaired by senior Linda Wright, met three times and
endorsed the idea of the Thunderchickens to replace
Indians after considering more than 50 suggestions.
Three other mascot possibilities, Stallions, Buckskins,
and Cowboys, were discarded in the final selection
process. Cardinals was eliminated after being considered
among the 12 most feasible suggestions to replace the
Indian.
Varied Suggestions
Some other suggestions discarded by the committee
included: War Mongers, Snobs, Supermen, Dopers,
Pinkoes, Studs, Cockroaches, and Boa Constrictors.
Wright forwarded the committee's formal
recommendation of the Thunderchickens to the
President's office which promptly returned the suggestion
to the committee requesting a clarification. In the
committee's statement, it recognized that "Cardinal is the
official color of the University's athletic teams and further
recognizes the past usage of the Cardinals as a
nickname . . . The Committee believes that its use will
probably continue into the future, and in fact does not
discourage its use."

Presidential William Stone that, "We
were unsure as to the relation between the Cardinal and
the Thunderchicken and sent the recommendation back
to the committee for a clarification." Once an
understanding is reached, Thunderchickens will be sent to
the Student Senate for ratification.
Negative Reaction
Reaction yesterday to the new mascot
recommendation among athletic department officials was
negative. Acting Athletic Director Robert Young
proclaimed that "I would not use the Thunderchickens on
any letterheads or anything else coming out of my office.
My plan is to have nothing but Stanford on the
uniforms."
Head football coach Jack Christiansen did not consider
the tentative mascot choice significant. "Nicknames don't
make that much difference. 1 thought that they would
come up with something other than Thunderchickens. I
don't see anything wrong with it, but I don't see anything
extra in it either."
The search committee, composed of six students and
representatives of the Buck Club, Alumni Association and
Athletic Department, was formed by the Student Senate
after their March 2 decision to eliminate the Indian. ASSU
President Doug McHenry was subsequently presented with
a legal petition with over 600 signatures calling for a
student body referendum on whether to keep the Indian
or find a new mascot. McHenry refused to put the
question on a ballot for what he termed 'moral' reasons.
