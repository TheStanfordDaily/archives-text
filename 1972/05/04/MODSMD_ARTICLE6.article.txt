Committee of 15
(This letter was addressed to the
ASSU Council of Presidents and
Senate and to the student body.)
The Committee of 15 (C-15)
voted 8-7 Tuesday night to
continue faculty domination of
judicial panels charged with
determining guilt, innocence and
penalty in student disciplinary
cases. Immediately after that vote,
all six student members left that
meeting. We consider a student
majority on such panels the
minimal condition of
acceptability, as we read the
referendum of April 7-8, 1971.
Therefore, we regard our
continued participation in
Committee deliberations to be a
matter for the student body to
decide.
We hereby request that a
referendum of the entire student
body be held as soon as possible
on the following question: Is a

faculty-dominated judicial panel
acceptable to the students of
Stanford University?
If the answer is "Yes", we will
return to normal deliberations. If
the answer is "No," we will return
to ask the Committee to
reconsider the composition issue.
Should the Committee refuse to
accept a student majority on the
above-mentioned panels, we will
refuse to participate in any
further C-15 deliberations.

Vandalism
Editor, THE DAILY:
Have you noticed all the
"clever" slogans painted on
campus buildings recently? Don't

you appreciate people whose
vandalism necessitates the use of
your money to undo their
mischief? Is it possible that they
find it necessary to resort to such
unintelligent and immature
methods of expression because
their position is largely untenable?
