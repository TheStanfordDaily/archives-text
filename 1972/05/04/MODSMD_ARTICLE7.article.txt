(Ann Kimball of the ASSU Council of Presidents requested Resident
Lyman's support for a University-wide Convocation today, in a letter
published Tuesday. Here is Lyman's reply.)
Dear Ms. Kimball:
I wonder if you can remember the number of occasions during
your years at Stanford on which some group has requested or
demanded that the University be closed for a period in order to
recognize or promote that group's strongly held views. I can
] remember, for example, several earlier Vietnam Moratoriums, a
demand for an all-day convocation on racism, and I'm sure that a
check of the files or a search of people's memories would turn up
many others.
Stanford has consistently declined to accede to those proposals for
reasons that I still find compelling. Let me mention the three that
head the list.
First, it is wrong in principle to put the functioning of the
University at the disposal of anyone's cause—yours, mine, or all of
ours. To depart from that principle on one occasion would be to make
all similar occasions in the future simply tests of political strength,
measured by votes, vocal strength, broken windows or whatever. Any
group that could show enough strength could close the University.
If the demand to close for some purpose were a unique event, then
there would perhaps be less of a problem. The second reason for not
agreeing to close, however, is that it is far from unique. There have
been many such demands in the past, there will be others in the
future, and the number is sure to increase if it is once done.
Finally, there are many people on this campus—faculty, staff, and
students—who do not want the University to close. They want to
teach, study, and work. I have never believed that I have or ought to
have the power (short of a drastic emergency on the campus) to order
them not to. I suspect that is a limit on the power of the President
that we might even agree on.
There is another side to all of this, however. While the University
will not choose those causes it wishes to promote by closing its doors,
it will protect in every way possible the right of its members to
promote causes of their own choice. In recent years we have had a
substantial number of teach-ins, convocations, memorial services, and
the like, on a variety of topics. On some of those occasions the
President or the Provost has encouraged participation by members of
the community limited by the need to continue the University's
{ essential functions, and by the understanding that classes and work
i assignments would be rescheduled where appropriate.
! In that spirit I do want to encourage members of the community
to take part in constructive activities scheduled for today. What
happens today, nationwide, can demonstrate either that the effective
yet responsible expression of concern is still possible in universities, or
that it is not because any expression of concern or protest will be
| exploited by those whose main interest is in the fruits of disruption. I
hope that the activities at Stanford will help to prove the former.
Richard W. Lyman
President
