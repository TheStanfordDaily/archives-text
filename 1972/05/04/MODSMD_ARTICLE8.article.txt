## Asia Policy Must Change 
### 
concerned asian scholars

University of Texas historian
Walt Rostow (Daily, May 1) cites
Roosevelt's embargo on trade in
strategic materials with Japan in
1940 as "the beginning of modern
American policy toward Asia."
His position is that the lack of a
consensus among Americans as to

the need for a continued US
presence in Asia stems from an
'asymmetry between our
experiences across the Atlantic
and across the Pacific'—that is,
while in our relations with Europe
our major concern has
consistently (since the Louisiana
Purchase) been the maintenance
and exploitation of a balance of
power, such an approach to
American interests and
responsibilities in Asia only comes
about with the rise of the
Japanese empire.
Prior to this, Rostow says,
"traditional Asia did not represent
a threat to America. It was an
arena within which more
advanced nations could compete
for commerce and power."
It is in fact the definition of
Asia as "an arena within which
more advanced nations could
compete for commerce and
power," a conception which still
dominates the theory and practice
of the makers of American policy
and its apologists (Rostow not
excepted, twice), which provides
us with a key to understanding
the underlying continuity of
American policy toward Asia
throughout the twentieth century
as well as the mirror-like qualities
of Mr. Rostow's 'asymmetry.'
Open Door
The Open Door Policy of the
United States was pursued in Asia
by means of a balance-of-power
strategy not fundamentally
different from that it had
traditionally used in its dealings
with Europe. The difference lay in
the fact that the balance of power
which the US sought to maintain
and exploit was not a balance of
power among Asian states (which,
except for Japan, had no real
power), but rather among the
same European powers in their
colonial incarnations, plus Japan.
The goal was to limit the
exclusivity of advantages enjoyed
by the imperialist powers within
their respective spheres of interest
in such a way that the United
States was able to share those
advantages. Those advantages
would be threatened by either the
actual partition of China into
colonies or the hegemony of any
single imperialist power in Asia.

The ultimate goal of a
non-colonial imperialism was to
satisfy the perceived needs of a
crystallizing industrial leadership
for economic expansion.
Key Expansion Field
By 1937, when Japan invaded
China, several factors had
changed. First, the identification
of Asia as a key field for
American expansion was not only
forty years old, but also
reinforced by the objective
economic relationships which
have developed. In 1937 Asia
furnished 51.5% of all raw and
crude materials imported into the
United States. Moreover, China's
long-awaited market potential was
finally beginning to materialize
out of the chaos that was China in
the 1920'5; by 1932 China bought
as many manufactured goods
from America as Japan did.
(William Appleman Williams, The
Tragedy of American Diplomacy,
pp. 191-192.) This identification
is now part of the ideological
substructure of American foreign
policy, not to be challenged until
the Vietnam crisis.
Second, the industrialization of
the United States was by than
more fact that process and the
coalescence of a corporate elite
which increasingly dominates
leadership roles in the United
States had proceeded apace.
Third, the relative weakness of
the American Navy, which made
any direct confrontation with a
major European power in Asia
unconceivable at the turn of the
century, no longer obtained.
Finally, and crucially, the
balance of power among imperial
powers in Asia, the maintenance
of which was essential to the
American strategy of low-cost
foreign expansion, no longer
existed. As Japan moved into the
vacuum created by the absence of
the by-then-preoccupied
European powers, Roosevelt saw
those American interests now
facing a threat which cannot be
met by delicate maneuvering.
Rostow's 'beginning of modern
American policy toward Asia' was
in fact a strategic shift in response
to the break-up of the balance of
power in Asia and in appreciation
of America's new capacity to take
a more active role in that balance
of power, but not in any way
inconsistent with previous US
policy.
World War II
The crucial shift in the nature

of the Asian situation came during
and after World War II when the
US failed to recognize objective
differences between the forces of
national liberation in China and
South-oast Asia, and the
imperialist powers whose
privileges the US had sought to
limit and share prior to World War
11.
The Chinese Revolution was
perceived as the victory of the
new imperialist power—the Soviet
Union. Similarly the Vietminh
were perceived as agents of an
imperial expansion not dissimilar
from the German and Japanese
phenomena. The French effort to
retake its colonies in Indochina
was supported as a means of
achieving a new balance of power
in Asia—inferior in terms of the
prior 'loss' of China, but
conceptually identical to the
order which had prevailed until
World War 11.
When the French become
disinclined to further pursue the
ancien regime, the US stepped in
to create and maintain a new
order, a new balance of power.
The balance the US sought to
achieve, however, involved the
conflicting needs, not of rival*
imperialist powers, but rather of
American interests (conceived and
developed in an era when
America's relatively 'modest'
needs rested unobtrusively among
the more strident demands of
England, France, Germany, and
Japan) and the necessary
requisites of true statehood,
independence, and national
self-determination in the
numerous countries (not only in
Asia) where American 'interests'
were presumed to lie.
Struggle Against Inhabitants
America continued to see
herself as a contender, if a
relatively honorable one, in "the
arena within which more
advanced nations could compete
for commerce and power" past
the point where that arena had in
many ways ceased to exist. The
European powers are gone, and
the United States (in uneasy
cooperation with Japan) is joined
in a struggle not against rival
contenders but the inhabitants of
the 'arena' itself. The
non-correspondence of the
American conception and
objective reality becomes
obscenely manifest when the
source of the aggression we bomb
to contain is not Moscow or
Peking but the other half of a
century; our 'ally' a creature of
US power whose 'countryness'
becomes necessary to maintain
the fiction that we are defending
something more than naked
self-interest.
There is some truth in Walt
Rostow's statement that "most
Americans understand in their
bones that Asia will be more,
rather than less, important in our
future than it has been in the
past..." for the presumption of
our vital interests in Asia has been
a part of American ideological
baggage for three-quarters of a
century. What Mr. Rostow and
others fail to perceive is the direct
contradiction between those
interests and the new vital Asia
which he sees emerging, and the
ultimate futility of any and all
attempts to maintain those
interests by force.

forty years old, but also
reinforced by the objective
economic relationships which
have developed. In 1937 Asia
furnished 51.5% of all raw and
crude materials imported into the
United States. Moreover, China's
long-awaited market potential was
finally beginning to materialize
out of the chaos that was China in
the 1920'5; by 1932 China bought
as many manufactured goods
from America as Japan did.
(William Appleman Williams, The
Tragedy of American Diplomacy,

is now part of the ideological
substructure of American foreign
policy, not to be challenged until
the Vietnam crisis.
Second, the industrialization of

Third, the relative weakness of
the American Navy, which made
any direct confrontation with a
major European power in Asia
unconceivable at the turn of the
century, no longer obtained.
Finally, and crucially, the
balance of power among imperial
powers in Asia, the maintenance
of which was essential to the
American strategy of low-cost
foreign expansion, no longer
existed. As Japan moved into the
vacuum created by the absence of
the by-then-preoccupied
European powers, Roosevelt saw
those American interests now
facing a threat which cannot be
met by delicate maneuvering.
Rostow's 'beginning of modern
American policy toward Asia' was
in fact a strategic shift in response
to the break-up of the balance of
power in Asia and in appreciation
of America's new capacity to take
a more active role in that balance
of power, but not in any way
inconsistent with previous US
policy.
World War II
The crucial shift in the nature

of the Asian situation came during
and after World War II when the
US failed to recognize objective
differences between the forces of
national liberation in China and
South-oast Asia, and the
imperialist powers whose
privileges the US had sought to
limit and share prior to World War
11.
The Chinese Revolution was
perceived as the victory of the
new imperialist power—the Soviet
Union. Similarly the Vietminh
were perceived as agents of an
imperial expansion not dissimilar
from the German and Japanese
phenomena. The French effort to
retake its colonies in Indochina
was supported as a means of
achieving a new balance of power
in Asia—inferior in terms of the
prior 'loss' of China, but
conceptually identical to the
order which had prevailed until
World War 11.
When the French become
disinclined to further pursue the
ancien regime, the US stepped in
to create and maintain a new
order, a new balance of power.
The balance the US sought to
achieve, however, involved the
conflicting needs, not of rival*
imperialist powers, but rather of
American interests (conceived and
developed in an era when
America's relatively 'modest'
needs rested unobtrusively among
the more strident demands of
England, France, Germany, and
Japan) and the necessary
requisites of true statehood,
independence, and national
self-determination in the
numerous countries (not only in
Asia) where American 'interests'
were presumed to lie.
Struggle Against Inhabitants
America continued to see
herself as a contender, if a
relatively honorable one, in "the
arena within which more
advanced nations could compete
for commerce and power" past
the point where that arena had in
many ways ceased to exist. The
European powers are gone, and
the United States (in uneasy
cooperation with Japan) is joined
in a struggle not against rival
contenders but the inhabitants of
the 'arena' itself. The
non-correspondence of the
American conception and
objective reality becomes
obscenely manifest when the
source of the aggression we bomb
to contain is not Moscow or
Peking but the other half of a
century; our 'ally' a creature of
US power whose 'countryness'
becomes necessary to maintain
the fiction that we are defending
something more than naked
self-interest.
There is some truth in Walt
Rostow's statement that "most
Americans understand in their
bones that Asia will be more,
rather than less, important in our
future than it has been in the
past..." for the presumption of
our vital interests in Asia has been
a part of American ideological
baggage for three-quarters of a
century. What Mr. Rostow and
others fail to perceive is the direct
contradiction between those
interests and the new vital Asia
which he sees emerging, and the
ultimate futility of any and all
attempts to maintain those
interests by force.

Scholars.)

University of Texas historian
Walt Rostow (Daily, May 1) cites
Roosevelt's embargo on trade in
strategic materials with Japan in
1940 as "the beginning of modern
American policy toward Asia."
His position is that the lack of a
consensus among Americans as to

the need for a continued US
presence in Asia stems from an
'asymmetry between our
experiences across the Atlantic
and across the Pacific'—that is,
while in our relations with Europe
our major concern has
consistently (since the Louisiana
Purchase) been the maintenance
and exploitation of a balance of
power, such an approach to
American interests and
responsibilities in Asia only comes
about with the rise of the
Japanese empire.
Prior to this, Rostow says,
"traditional Asia did not represent
a threat to America. It was an
arena within which more
advanced nations could compete
for commerce and power."
It is in fact the definition of
Asia as "an arena within which
more advanced nations could
compete for commerce and
power," a conception which still
dominates the theory and practice
of the makers of American policy
and its apologists (Rostow not
excepted, twice), which provides
us with a key to understanding
the underlying continuity of
American policy toward Asia
throughout the twentieth century
as well as the mirror-like qualities
of Mr. Rostow's 'asymmetry.'
Open Door
The Open Door Policy of the
United States was pursued in Asia
by means of a balance-of-power
strategy not fundamentally
different from that it had
traditionally used in its dealings
with Europe. The difference lay in
the fact that the balance of power
which the US sought to maintain
and exploit was not a balance of
power among Asian states (which,
except for Japan, had no real
power), but rather among the
same European powers in their
colonial incarnations, plus Japan.
The goal was to limit the
exclusivity of advantages enjoyed
by the imperialist powers within
their respective spheres of interest
in such a way that the United
States was able to share those
advantages. Those advantages
would be threatened by either the
actual partition of China into
colonies or the hegemony of any
single imperialist power in Asia.

The ultimate goal of a
non-colonial imperialism was to
satisfy the perceived needs of a
crystallizing industrial leadership
for economic expansion.
Key Expansion Field
By 1937, when Japan invaded
China, several factors had
changed. First, the identification
of Asia as a key field for

prior 'loss' of China, but
conceptually identical to the
order which had prevailed until
World War 11.
When the French become
disinclined to further pursue the
ancien regime, the US stepped in
to create and maintain a new
order, a new balance of power.
The balance the US sought to
achieve, however, involved the
conflicting needs, not of rival*
imperialist powers, but rather of
American interests (conceived and
developed in an era when
America's relatively 'modest'
needs rested unobtrusively among
the more strident demands of
England, France, Germany, and
Japan) and the necessary
requisites of true statehood,
independence, and national
self-determination in the
numerous countries (not only in
Asia) where American 'interests'
were presumed to lie.
Struggle Against Inhabitants
America continued to see
herself as a contender, if a
relatively honorable one, in "the
arena within which more
advanced nations could compete
for commerce and power" past
the point where that arena had in
many ways ceased to exist. The
European powers are gone, and
the United States (in uneasy
cooperation with Japan) is joined
in a struggle not against rival
contenders but the inhabitants of
the 'arena' itself. The
non-correspondence of the
American conception and
objective reality becomes
obscenely manifest when the
source of the aggression we bomb
to contain is not Moscow or
Peking but the other half of a
century; our 'ally' a creature of
US power whose 'countryness'
becomes necessary to maintain
the fiction that we are defending
something more than naked
self-interest.
There is some truth in Walt
Rostow's statement that "most
Americans understand in their
bones that Asia will be more,
rather than less, important in our
future than it has been in the
past..." for the presumption of
our vital interests in Asia has been
a part of American ideological
baggage for three-quarters of a
century. What Mr. Rostow and
others fail to perceive is the direct
contradiction between those
interests and the new vital Asia
which he sees emerging, and the
ultimate futility of any and all
attempts to maintain those
interests by force.

University of Texas historian
Walt Rostow (Daily, May 1) cites
Roosevelt's embargo on trade in
strategic materials with Japan in
1940 as "the beginning of modern
American policy toward Asia."
His position is that the lack of a
consensus among Americans as to

the need for a continued US
presence in Asia stems from an
'asymmetry between our
experiences across the Atlantic
and across the Pacific'—that is,
while in our relations with Europe
our major concern has
consistently (since the Louisiana
Purchase) been the maintenance
and exploitation of a balance of
power, such an approach to
American interests and
responsibilities in Asia only comes
about with the rise of the
Japanese empire.
Prior to this, Rostow says,
"traditional Asia did not represent
a threat to America. It was an
arena within which more
advanced nations could compete
for commerce and power."
It is in fact the definition of
Asia as "an arena within which
more advanced nations could
compete for commerce and
power," a conception which still
dominates the theory and practice
of the makers of American policy
and its apologists (Rostow not
excepted, twice), which provides
us with a key to understanding
the underlying continuity of
American policy toward Asia
throughout the twentieth century
as well as the mirror-like qualities
of Mr. Rostow's 'asymmetry.'
Open Door
The Open Door Policy of the
United States was pursued in Asia
by means of a balance-of-power
strategy not fundamentally
different from that it had
traditionally used in its dealings
with Europe. The difference lay in
the fact that the balance of power
which the US sought to maintain
and exploit was not a balance of
power among Asian states (which,
except for Japan, had no real
power), but rather among the
same European powers in their
colonial incarnations, plus Japan.
The goal was to limit the
exclusivity of advantages enjoyed
by the imperialist powers within
their respective spheres of interest
in such a way that the United
States was able to share those
advantages. Those advantages
would be threatened by either the
actual partition of China into
colonies or the hegemony of any
single imperialist power in Asia.

The ultimate goal of a
non-colonial imperialism was to
satisfy the perceived needs of a
crystallizing industrial leadership
for economic expansion.
Key Expansion Field
By 1937, when Japan invaded
China, several factors had
changed. First, the identification
of Asia as a key field for
American expansion was not only
forty years old, but also
reinforced by the objective
economic relationships which
have developed. In 1937 Asia
furnished 51.5% of all raw and
crude materials imported into the
United States. Moreover, China's
long-awaited market potential was
finally beginning to materialize
out of the chaos that was China in
the 1920'5; by 1932 China bought
as many manufactured goods
from America as Japan did.
(William Appleman Williams, The
Tragedy of American Diplomacy,
pp. 191-192.) This identification
is now part of the ideological
substructure of American foreign
policy, not to be challenged until
the Vietnam crisis.
Second, the industrialization of
the United States was by than
more fact that process and the
coalescence of a corporate elite
which increasingly dominates
leadership roles in the United
States had proceeded apace.
Third, the relative weakness of
the American Navy, which made
any direct confrontation with a
major European power in Asia
unconceivable at the turn of the
century, no longer obtained.
Finally, and crucially, the
balance of power among imperial
powers in Asia, the maintenance
of which was essential to the
American strategy of low-cost
foreign expansion, no longer
existed. As Japan moved into the
vacuum created by the absence of
the by-then-preoccupied
European powers, Roosevelt saw
those American interests now
facing a threat which cannot be
met by delicate maneuvering.
Rostow's 'beginning of modern
American policy toward Asia' was
in fact a strategic shift in response
to the break-up of the balance of
power in Asia and in appreciation
of America's new capacity to take
a more active role in that balance
of power, but not in any way
inconsistent with previous US
policy.
World War II
The crucial shift in the nature

of the Asian situation came during
and after World War II when the
US failed to recognize objective
differences between the forces of
national liberation in China and
South-oast Asia, and the
imperialist powers whose
privileges the US had sought to
limit and share prior to World War
11.
The Chinese Revolution was
perceived as the victory of the
new imperialist power—the Soviet
Union. Similarly the Vietminh
were perceived as agents of an
imperial expansion not dissimilar
from the German and Japanese
phenomena. The French effort to
retake its colonies in Indochina
was supported as a means of
achieving a new balance of power
in Asia—inferior in terms of the
prior 'loss' of China, but
conceptually identical to the
order which had prevailed until
World War 11.
When the French become
