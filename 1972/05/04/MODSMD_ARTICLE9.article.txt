## Taxes, Taxpayers Revolt Grow

'There went out a decree from
Caesar Augustus that all the world
should be taxed. "—Luke 2:1
One of the great and striking
facts of recent months is the
growing resistance to further taxes
on the part of the long-suffering
American public. Every
individual, business, or
organization in American society
acquires its revenue by the
peaceful and voluntary sale of
productive goods and services to
the consumer, or by voluntary
donations from people who wish
to further whatever the group or
organization is doing. Only
government acquires its income
by the coercive imposition of
taxes. The welcome new element
is the growing resistance to
further tax exactions by the
American people.
In its endless quest for more
and better booty, the government
has contrived to tax everything it
can find, and in countless ways.
Its motto can almost be said to
be: "If it moves, tax it!"
Every income, every activity,
every piece of property, every
person in the land is subject to a
battery of tax extortions, direct
and indirect, visible and invisible.
There is of course nothing new
about this; what is new is that the
accelerating drive of the
government to tax has begun to
run into determined resistance on
the part of the American
citizenry.
It is no secret that the income
tax, the favorite of government
for its ability to reach in and
openly extract funds from
everyone's income, has reached its
political limit in this country. The
poor and the middle class are now
taxed so heavily that the federal
government, in particular, dares
not try to extort even more
ruinous levies.
The outraged taxpayer, after
all, can easily become the
outraged voter. How outraged the
voters can be was brought home
to the politicians last November,
when locality after locality
throughout the country rose in
wrath to vote down proposed
bond issues, even for the
long-sacrosanct purpose of
expanding public schools.
Defeat in New York
The most heartening example
- and one that can only give us all
hope for a free America — was in
New York City, where very
leading politican of both parties,
aided and abetted by a heavily
financed and demagogic TV
campaign, urged the voters to
support a transportation bond
issue. Yet the bond issue was
overwhelmingly defeated — and
this lesson for all of our
politicians was a sharp and
salutary one.
Finally, the property tax, the
main-stay of local government as
the income tax is at the federal
level, is now generally
acknowledged to have a
devastating effect on the nation's
housing. The property tax
discourages improvements and
investments in housing, has driven
countless Americans out of their
homes, and has led to spiralling
tax abandonments in, for
example. New York City, with a
resulting deterioration of blighted
slum housing.
Limit Reached
Government, in short, has
reached its tax limit: the people

were finally saying an emphatic
"No!" to any further rise in their
tax burden. What was
ever-encroaching government
going to do? The nation's
economists, most of whom are
ever eager to serve as technicians
for the expansion of state power,
were at hand with an answer, a
new rabbit out of the hat to save
the day for Big Government.
They pointed out that the
income tax and property tax were
too evident, too visible, and that
so are the generally hated sales tax
and excise taxes on specific
commodities. But how about a
tax that remains totally hidden ,
that the consumer or average
American cannot identify and
pinpoint as the object of his
wrath? It was this deliciously
hidden quality that brought forth
the rapt attention of the Nixon
Administration, the "Value
Added Tax" (VAT).
The great individualist Frank
Chodorov explained clearly the
hankering of government for
hidden taxation: "It is not the
size of the yield, nor the certainty
of collection, which gives indirect
taxation [read: VAT]
preeminence in the state's scheme
of appropriation. Its most
commendable quality is that of
being surreptitious. It is taking, so
to speak, while the victim is not
looking.
"Those who strain themselves
to give taxation a moral character
arc under obligation to explain
the state's preoccupation with
hiding taxes in the price of
goods." (Frank Chodorov, Out of
Step, Devin-Adair, 1962, p. 220.)

The VAT is essentially a
national sales tax, levied in
proportion to the goods and
services produced and sold. But its
delightful concealment comes
from the fact that the VAT is
levied at each step of the way in
the production process: on
farmer, manufacturer, jobber and
wholesaler, and only slightly on
the retailer.
The difference is that when a
consumer pays a 7 per cent sales
tax on every purchase, his
indignation rises and he points the
finger of resentment at the
politicians in charge of
government; but if the 7 per cent
tax io hidden and paid by every
firm rather than just at retail, the
inevitably higher prices will be
charged, not to the government
where it belongs, but to grasping
businessmen and avaricious trade
unions.
While consumers, businessmen
and unions all blame each other
for inflation like Kilkenny cats,
Papa government is able to
preserve its lofty moral purity,
and to join in denouncing all of
these groups for "causing
inflation."
It is now easy to see the
enthusiasm of the federal
government and its economic
advisers for the new scheme for a
VAT. It allows the government to
extract many more funds from
the public — to bring about higher
prices, lower production and
lower incomes — and yet totally
escape the blame, which can easily
be loaded on business, unions, or
the consumer as the particular

administration sees fit.
The VAT is, in short, a
looming gigantic swindle upon the
American public, and it is
therefore vitally important that it
shall not pass. For if it does, the
encroaching menace of Big
Government will get another, and
prolonged, lease on life.
One of the selling points for
VAT is that it is supposed only to
replace the property tax for its
prime task of financing local
public schools. Any relief of the
onerous burden of the property
tax sounds good to many
Americans.
But anyone familiar with the
history of government or taxation
should know the trap in this sort
of promise. For we should all
know by now that taxes never go
down. Government, in its
insatiable quest for new funds.

never relaxes its grip on any
source of revenue.
You know and I know that the
property tax, even if replaced for
school financing, will not really go
down: it will simply be shifted to
other expensive boondoggles of
local government. And we also
know full well that the VAT will
not long be limited to financing
the schools; its vast potential (a
10 per cent VAT would bring in
about $60 billion in revenue) is
just too tempting for the
government not to use it to the
hilt, and, in the famous words of
New Dealer Harry Hopkins: "to
tax and tax, spend and spend,
elect and elect."

- and one that can only give us all
hope for a free America — was in
New York City, where very
leading politican of both parties,
aided and abetted by a heavily
financed and demagogic TV
campaign, urged the voters to
support a transportation bond
issue. Yet the bond issue was
overwhelmingly defeated — and
this lesson for all of our
politicians was a sharp and
salutary one.
Finally, the property tax, the
main-stay of local government as
the income tax is at the federal
level, is now generally
acknowledged to have a
devastating effect on the nation's
housing. The property tax
discourages improvements and
investments in housing, has driven
countless Americans out of their
homes, and has led to spiralling
tax abandonments in, for
example. New York City, with a
resulting deterioration of blighted
slum housing.
Limit Reached
Government, in short, has
reached its tax limit: the people

were finally saying an emphatic
"No!" to any further rise in their
tax burden. What was
ever-encroaching government
going to do? The nation's
economists, most of whom are
ever eager to serve as technicians
for the expansion of state power,
were at hand with an answer, a
new rabbit out of the hat to save
the day for Big Government.
They pointed out that the
income tax and property tax were
too evident, too visible, and that
so are the generally hated sales tax
and excise taxes on specific
commodities. But how about a
tax that remains totally hidden ,
that the consumer or average
American cannot identify and
pinpoint as the object of his
wrath? It was this deliciously
hidden quality that brought forth
the rapt attention of the Nixon
Administration, the "Value
Added Tax" (VAT).
The great individualist Frank
Chodorov explained clearly the
hankering of government for
hidden taxation: "It is not the
size of the yield, nor the certainty
of collection, which gives indirect
taxation [read: VAT]
preeminence in the state's scheme
of appropriation. Its most
commendable quality is that of
being surreptitious. It is taking, so
to speak, while the victim is not
looking.
"Those who strain themselves
to give taxation a moral character
arc under obligation to explain
the state's preoccupation with
hiding taxes in the price of
goods." (Frank Chodorov, Out of
Step, Devin-Adair, 1962, p. 220.)

The VAT is essentially a
national sales tax, levied in
proportion to the goods and
services produced and sold. But its
delightful concealment comes
from the fact that the VAT is
levied at each step of the way in
the production process: on
farmer, manufacturer, jobber and
wholesaler, and only slightly on
the retailer.
The difference is that when a
consumer pays a 7 per cent sales
tax on every purchase, his
indignation rises and he points the
finger of resentment at the
politicians in charge of
government; but if the 7 per cent
tax io hidden and paid by every
firm rather than just at retail, the
inevitably higher prices will be
charged, not to the government
where it belongs, but to grasping
businessmen and avaricious trade
unions.
While consumers, businessmen
and unions all blame each other
for inflation like Kilkenny cats,
Papa government is able to
preserve its lofty moral purity,
and to join in denouncing all of
these groups for "causing
inflation."
It is now easy to see the
enthusiasm of the federal
government and its economic
advisers for the new scheme for a
VAT. It allows the government to
extract many more funds from
the public — to bring about higher
prices, lower production and
lower incomes — and yet totally
escape the blame, which can easily
be loaded on business, unions, or
the consumer as the particular

administration sees fit.
The VAT is, in short, a
looming gigantic swindle upon the
American public, and it is
therefore vitally important that it
shall not pass. For if it does, the
encroaching menace of Big
Government will get another, and
prolonged, lease on life.
One of the selling points for
VAT is that it is supposed only to
replace the property tax for its
prime task of financing local
public schools. Any relief of the
onerous burden of the property
tax sounds good to many
Americans.
But anyone familiar with the
history of government or taxation
should know the trap in this sort
of promise. For we should all
know by now that taxes never go
down. Government, in its
insatiable quest for new funds.

never relaxes its grip on any
source of revenue.
You know and I know that the
property tax, even if replaced for
school financing, will not really go
down: it will simply be shifted to
other expensive boondoggles of
local government. And we also
know full well that the VAT will
not long be limited to financing
the schools; its vast potential (a
10 per cent VAT would bring in
about $60 billion in revenue) is
just too tempting for the
government not to use it to the
hilt, and, in the famous words of
New Dealer Harry Hopkins: "to
tax and tax, spend and spend,
elect and elect."

'There went out a decree from
Caesar Augustus that all the world
should be taxed. "—Luke 2:1
One of the great and striking
facts of recent months is the
growing resistance to further taxes
on the part of the long-suffering
American public. Every
individual, business, or
organization in American society
acquires its revenue by the
peaceful and voluntary sale of
productive goods and services to
the consumer, or by voluntary
donations from people who wish
to further whatever the group or
organization is doing. Only
government acquires its income
by the coercive imposition of
taxes. The welcome new element
is the growing resistance to
further tax exactions by the
American people.
In its endless quest for more
and better booty, the government
has contrived to tax everything it
can find, and in countless ways.
Its motto can almost be said to
be: "If it moves, tax it!"
Every income, every activity,
every piece of property, every
person in the land is subject to a
battery of tax extortions, direct
and indirect, visible and invisible.
There is of course nothing new
about this; what is new is that the
accelerating drive of the
government to tax has begun to
run into determined resistance on
the part of the American
citizenry.
It is no secret that the income
tax, the favorite of government
for its ability to reach in and
openly extract funds from
everyone's income, has reached its
political limit in this country. The
poor and the middle class are now
taxed so heavily that the federal
government, in particular, dares
not try to extort even more
ruinous levies.
The outraged taxpayer, after
all, can easily become the
outraged voter. How outraged the
voters can be was brought home
to the politicians last November,
when locality after locality
throughout the country rose in
wrath to vote down proposed
bond issues, even for the
long-sacrosanct purpose of
expanding public schools.

to speak, while the victim is not

"Those who strain themselves
to give taxation a moral character
arc under obligation to explain
the state's preoccupation with

goods." (Frank Chodorov, Out of

The VAT is essentially a
national sales tax, levied in
proportion to the goods and
services produced and sold. But its
delightful concealment comes
from the fact that the VAT is
levied at each step of the way in
the production process: on
farmer, manufacturer, jobber and
wholesaler, and only slightly on
the retailer.
The difference is that when a
consumer pays a 7 per cent sales
tax on every purchase, his
indignation rises and he points the
finger of resentment at the
politicians in charge of
government; but if the 7 per cent
tax io hidden and paid by every
firm rather than just at retail, the
inevitably higher prices will be
charged, not to the government
where it belongs, but to grasping
businessmen and avaricious trade
unions.
While consumers, businessmen
and unions all blame each other
for inflation like Kilkenny cats,
Papa government is able to
preserve its lofty moral purity,
and to join in denouncing all of
these groups for "causing
inflation."
It is now easy to see the
enthusiasm of the federal
government and its economic
advisers for the new scheme for a
VAT. It allows the government to
extract many more funds from
the public — to bring about higher
prices, lower production and
lower incomes — and yet totally
escape the blame, which can easily
be loaded on business, unions, or
the consumer as the particular

administration sees fit.
The VAT is, in short, a
looming gigantic swindle upon the
American public, and it is
therefore vitally important that it
shall not pass. For if it does, the
encroaching menace of Big
Government will get another, and
prolonged, lease on life.
One of the selling points for
VAT is that it is supposed only to
replace the property tax for its
prime task of financing local
public schools. Any relief of the
onerous burden of the property
tax sounds good to many
Americans.
But anyone familiar with the
history of government or taxation
should know the trap in this sort
of promise. For we should all
know by now that taxes never go
down. Government, in its
insatiable quest for new funds.

never relaxes its grip on any
source of revenue.
You know and I know that the
property tax, even if replaced for
school financing, will not really go
down: it will simply be shifted to
other expensive boondoggles of
local government. And we also
know full well that the VAT will
not long be limited to financing
the schools; its vast potential (a
10 per cent VAT would bring in
about $60 billion in revenue) is
just too tempting for the
government not to use it to the
hilt, and, in the famous words of
New Dealer Harry Hopkins: "to
tax and tax, spend and spend,
elect and elect."

'There went out a decree from
Caesar Augustus that all the world
should be taxed. "—Luke 2:1
One of the great and striking
facts of recent months is the
growing resistance to further taxes
on the part of the long-suffering
American public. Every
individual, business, or
organization in American society
acquires its revenue by the
peaceful and voluntary sale of
productive goods and services to
the consumer, or by voluntary
donations from people who wish
to further whatever the group or
organization is doing. Only
government acquires its income
by the coercive imposition of
taxes. The welcome new element
is the growing resistance to
further tax exactions by the
American people.
In its endless quest for more
and better booty, the government
has contrived to tax everything it
can find, and in countless ways.
Its motto can almost be said to
be: "If it moves, tax it!"
Every income, every activity,
every piece of property, every
person in the land is subject to a
battery of tax extortions, direct
and indirect, visible and invisible.
There is of course nothing new
about this; what is new is that the
accelerating drive of the
government to tax has begun to
run into determined resistance on
the part of the American
citizenry.
It is no secret that the income
tax, the favorite of government
for its ability to reach in and
openly extract funds from
everyone's income, has reached its
political limit in this country. The
poor and the middle class are now
taxed so heavily that the federal
government, in particular, dares
not try to extort even more
ruinous levies.
The outraged taxpayer, after
all, can easily become the
outraged voter. How outraged the
voters can be was brought home
to the politicians last November,
when locality after locality
throughout the country rose in
wrath to vote down proposed
bond issues, even for the
long-sacrosanct purpose of
expanding public schools.
Defeat in New York
The most heartening example
- and one that can only give us all
hope for a free America — was in
New York City, where very
leading politican of both parties,
aided and abetted by a heavily
financed and demagogic TV
campaign, urged the voters to
support a transportation bond
issue. Yet the bond issue was
overwhelmingly defeated — and
this lesson for all of our
politicians was a sharp and
salutary one.
Finally, the property tax, the
main-stay of local government as
the income tax is at the federal
level, is now generally
acknowledged to have a
devastating effect on the nation's
housing. The property tax
discourages improvements and
investments in housing, has driven
countless Americans out of their
homes, and has led to spiralling
tax abandonments in, for
example. New York City, with a
resulting deterioration of blighted
slum housing.
Limit Reached
Government, in short, has
reached its tax limit: the people

were finally saying an emphatic
"No!" to any further rise in their
tax burden. What was
ever-encroaching government
going to do? The nation's
economists, most of whom are
ever eager to serve as technicians
for the expansion of state power,
were at hand with an answer, a
new rabbit out of the hat to save
the day for Big Government.
They pointed out that the
income tax and property tax were
too evident, too visible, and that
so are the generally hated sales tax
and excise taxes on specific
commodities. But how about a
tax that remains totally hidden ,
that the consumer or average
American cannot identify and
pinpoint as the object of his
wrath? It was this deliciously
hidden quality that brought forth
the rapt attention of the Nixon
Administration, the "Value
Added Tax" (VAT).
The great individualist Frank
Chodorov explained clearly the
hankering of government for
hidden taxation: "It is not the
size of the yield, nor the certainty
of collection, which gives indirect
taxation [read: VAT]
preeminence in the state's scheme
of appropriation. Its most

replace the property tax for its
prime task of financing local
public schools. Any relief of the
onerous burden of the property
tax sounds good to many
Americans.
But anyone familiar with the
history of government or taxation
should know the trap in this sort
of promise. For we should all
know by now that taxes never go
down. Government, in its
insatiable quest for new funds.

never relaxes its grip on any
source of revenue.
You know and I know that the
property tax, even if replaced for
school financing, will not really go
down: it will simply be shifted to
other expensive boondoggles of
local government. And we also
know full well that the VAT will
not long be limited to financing
the schools; its vast potential (a
10 per cent VAT would bring in
about $60 billion in revenue) is
just too tempting for the
government not to use it to the
hilt, and, in the famous words of
New Dealer Harry Hopkins: "to
tax and tax, spend and spend,
elect and elect."
