# Kent State Anniversary
## War Protests Varied, Peaceful 
### 
Anti-war demonstrators yesterday
commemorated the second anniversary
of the slaying of four Kent State
University students by National
Guardsmen with picketing, a panel
discussion, a convocation, a rally and
marches, all without incident.
After sleeping overnight in White
Plaza, renamed "Quang Tri Plaza" for
the occasion, about 35 protesters
moved to the Physical Plant, steam
plant, and linear accelerator, where
they picketed and distributed leaflets.

A moving picket line delayed
vehicles entering and leaving the
physical plant, and Santa Clara County
Sheriff's deputies interceded several
times to ask pickets to allow traffic to
pass. The demonstrators complied.
At noon, an audience of 300
listened to fired English professor H.
Bruce Franklin exhort students to
"work night and day" to block
entrances to the Physical Plant, with
the cooperation of Stanford workers.
He warned workers that students

"are being trained to oppress and
exploit you," and urged students to
understand workers' alienation.
Most ppople unfairly stereotype
workers, Franklin argued. "We treat
workers as if they are invisible. It
seems as though the buildings spring
up by magic and the books are
manufactured by magic and the thing
I'm speaking through was made by
magic," he asserted.
After the rally, about 70 people
moved to the Men's Athletic Building
to question Army and Navy Reserve
Officers Training Corp instructors
about a rumor that ROTC will be
reinstated at Stanford.
Confronted Duck
They confronted Captain John
Duck, head of Stanford's NROTC
program, who assured demonstrators
that ROTC programs will be phased
out by June, 1973, as scheduled.
Protesters then moved down a
second floor hallway to speak with
Major Dennis Gillem, head instructor
for Army ROTC, in his office.
"I'm asking you to leave. You are
disrupting the work in this office,"
Gillem informed the demonstrators,
but he agreed to talk with them after
they moved outside the office.
After some discussion, demonstra
tors "served notice" that they would
not allow ROTC to remain on campus
after July 1973 and then marched to
President Lyman's locked office. The
group then marched to and occupied
the Faculty Club briefly before dis
persing.
Convocation
Earlier in the day, 100 people
attended a convocation in Memorial
Church to honor the Kent State dead.
ASSU Council of Presidents member
Ann Kimball presided over the 11 a.m.
convocation, where history professor
Barton Bernstein Jr., economics pro
fessor John Gurley, and law student
Allen Cox spoke.
Bernstein maintained the Vietnam
War was not a mistake, but a
projection of U.S. ideology and
capitalistic expansion dating back to
World War II and the administration of
Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Cox, former nuclear warfare officer
on the attack carrier USS Hancock,
voiced his fear that President Nixon
will call for nuclear strikes against the
North Vietnamese to support a col

lapsing South Vietnamese government.
Earlier in the day, double Nobel
Laureate Linus Pauling, a chemistry
professor, estimated that American
bombing has killed 2.4 million Viet
namese, based on the tonnage of high
explosives dropped in Vietnam.
He warned that the United States
might initiate "massive bombing of
cities" in the near future, as South
Vietnamese forces withdraw in the
face of a continued North Vietnamese
offensive.
Pauling said he was "afraid the
country may get completely under the
control of the power elite, even
though they're good enough to allow
us a little dissent now."
Unlike Franklin, who believes that
"non-violence has never achieved any
thing constructive," Pauling advised
students to "avoid action that will
permit violent retaliation ... It's use
less to get in a struggle with the police
that involves the use of force, because
the police are always more powerful."
At noon, Franklin stressed the need
for unity within the student move
ment, and solidarity with workers. He
suggested that revolutionaries and
non-violent "reformists" should work
together to preserve a united front.
