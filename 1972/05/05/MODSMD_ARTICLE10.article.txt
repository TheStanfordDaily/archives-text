## DoD Research 
### 
Richard pantell

Until recently I believed that the Young Crows served a useful
function on campus. They were causing some principal investigators
to consider the military potential of their research and, whatever one's
position with regard to DoD support, this is a useful exercise. I now
believe that their primary effect is counterproductive. Their lack of
morality and credibility reflects adversely upon those of us who are
interested in terminating the military' involvement of the United
States in Southeast Asia.
Difficult to .Judge
Except for extreme cases where an investigator is working directly
on weaponry, it is difficult to judge the military applications of any
research program. Military potential is not an absolute condition, but
rather involves estimates, by the most knowledgeable people, of the
likelihood that a particular device may or may not be used in a given
manner. Many factors must be considered depending upon the
application, including cost, ruggedness, reliability, temperature
invariants, simplicity of operation, maintainability, mobility and
reproducibility. If one is interested in laser weaponry, then additional
characteristics to be considered are wavelength, coherence and
intensity.
I have always been sensitive to possible military applications of my
work. I have never promised any agency that they will find military
uses for my programs. In my judgment, my projects have negligible
military applications, and this judgment is based upon more than ten
years of intensive study in my field.
Barkan and Siegel
Despite this, I find that I am attacked for my laser research by Mr.
Robert Barkan and Mr. Lenny Siegel, (R. Barkan, 'The Schawlow
Syndrome," Stanford Daily, April 26, 1972, p. 2). They wish to
superimpose their judgment, based upon several paragraphs in several
trade journals, over mine. Their abysmal ignorance of the subject
matter is displayed by their suggestion that new lightweight
accelerators may make my laser mobile. They obviously have no
knowledge of the great variety of accelerators that exist or the type of
accelerator that I am using.
They mention that my research is no longer supported by the DoD.
If, as they suggest, it is so critical to our military posture why has the
DoD support terminated? Perhaps this is an effort, on the part of the
Defense Department, to confuse Mr. Siegel and Dr. Barkan.
I doubt that there are many projects in this university, regardless
of the school or department, that are less likely candidates for
military applications. The immorality of the Young Crows, as
manifested by their arrogant and ignorant attack, is damaging to those
of us who wish to promote the peace movement.
