## Support April 21 Arrestees 
### 
encina—Hansen group

The people who were arrested
and/or beaten on Thursday, April
20, and on Friday, April 21, are
victims of a general political
repression that is designed to
smash the anti-war movement
across the country. We must not
be intimidated by the police state
tactics of Lyman, Tamm and
other lackeys of the ruling class
but must show, like the
Vietnamese, that repression does
breed resistance.
Sunday the U.S. used all
available air and naval power to
stop the Communist offensive in
Vietnam, dropping 2500 tons of
bombs. Some raids were within
four miles of Quang Tri, an
important provincial capital, in a
desperate attempt to stop a

Communist take-over. Monday
Quang Tri fell to the NLF. The
Vietnamese are fighting back
against U.S. imperialism — and
winning.
Ground Troops
The U.S. will be able to create
a stalemate through the use of air
and naval power but a U.S.
victory is impossible without the
utilization of ground troops.
Because of this, both the United
States government and the
Vietnamese realize how important
American protests against the war
can be. It was the protests
following the invasion of
Cambodia that forced the
withdrawal of ground troops. The
ruling class cannot afford that
kind of defeat again and so must

escalate domestic fascism in order
to succeed in the Vitnamese
defensive.
People around the country are
recognizing the need to strike
back against this fascism.
Thousands of people have
participated in protests against the
bombing: students at Columbia
seized buildings, the National
Guard was needed to quell
uprisings in Maryland, and the list
goes on. These student uprisings
do not happen in isolation; they
are a conscious part of the over-all
struggle against U.S. imperialism.
Common Goals
One way of realizing our
common unity is to adopt a
common set of demands or goals.
The Committee for Just Rewards,
the San Diego Coalition, the April
22 Coalition and the Stanford
Strike Committee, among others,
have accepted and endorsed the
Kezar Demands. In solidarity with

them and with our anti-imperialist
brothers and sisters at home and
abroad, the Encina-Hansen Group
of the "April 21 Defense
Collective" demands: 1) an end to
U.S. aggression in Indochina and
support for the PRG 7-Point Plan
for peace in Indochina; 2) an end
to U.S. interference in the internal
affairs of any country; and 3) an
end to Nixon's policies of
economic, political, racial and
sexist repression. We further
demand an end to Stanford's
complicity in the war.
We who marched to Encina
and Hansen April 21 did so not as
individuals but in unity,
protesting against American
exploitation in Southeast Asia.
Those of us who were victims of
the Santa Clara Police State seek
to continue to struggle, helping to
end repression both at home and
abroad. In order to not lose sight
of our goals, the unity of April 21

must be maintained.
All who risked police attack
with us that moming should feel
as one — united in a stand against
the military-police complex of
forced obedience. The time and
money we will spend in court are
just part of what we must sacrifice
to bring a halt to American
imperialism. But with expenses
amounting to about $100 per
arrestee, we desperately need
funds to carry the effort through
the legal system. Perhaps those
who were with us Friday will also
be willing to help in our defense,
both through essential monetary
donations and through support at
our up-coming trials. The tactics
of riot squads and group arrests
should never be allowed to defeat
our cause.
