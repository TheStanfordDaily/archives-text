(Editors Note: The following report of Premier Chou En-lai's
reactions to thecurrent Indochina situation are reprinted from the
April 21 issue of the Peking Review J
Premier Chou stated: The Chinese Government and people firmly
support the solemn and just stand of the April 11 statement of the
Government of the Democratic Republic of [North] Vietnam
(DRNV) and will give all-out support and assistance to the Vietnamese
people in carrying through to the end the war against U.S. aggression
and for national salvation.
He said: The U.S. imperialists' attacks on the D.R.V.N, constitute a
serious incident of expanding the war. The Chinese government and
people are closely following the development of this incident.
He pointed out: U.S. imperialism has already suffered ignominous
defeats in its war of aggression against Viet Nam. But, it still refuses to
take its defeat lying down. It is continuing its last-ditch fight, trying
to avert defeat by enlarging the scope of bombing. It will never
succeed in this, but will evoke stronger resistance from the
Vietnamese people and arouse the opposition of the people of the
world, including the American people.
Premier Chou expressed the conviction that, united as one, fighting
shoulder to shoulder and persisting in protracted resistance, the
people of Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia will surely frustrate the new
acts of aggression by U.S. imperialism and win complete victory in the
war against U.S. aggression and for national calvation.

Premier Chou En-lai said that the Chinese Government and people
firmly support the solemn and just stand of the Central Committee of
the South Viet Nam National Front for Liberation and the Provisional
Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam as
expressed in the appeal. He warmly congratulated the south
Vietnamese people and army on the brilliant victories they have won
on various battlefields.
Premier Chou En-lai pointed out: U.S. imperialism has employed
an unprecedented amount of naval and air forces to launch large-scale
attacks on south Viet Nam and the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam.
It even bombed Hanoi and Haiphong today in defiance of the
opposition of the people of the world, including the American people.
This shows it has embarked again on the old track of war escalation.
However, it will never succeed by this means in its attempt to
extricate itself from the defeat in its war of aggression against Viet
Nam and to prevent its policy of "Vietnamization of the war" from
going bankrupt. War escalation failed in the past and will continue to
fail.
The Premier stated: The new military adventure by U.S.
imperialism against the south and north of Viet Nam can frighten no
one, but will only further reveal its weakness and savage nature, make
the entire Vietnamese people unite ever more closely in their fight
against the enemy. As the appeal well puts it, the U.S. imperialists and
their henchmen cannot change this truth: Viet Nam is one country,
the Vietnamese are one nation. The people in the north and the south,
millions as one, are determined to fight and defeat the common
enemy.
Premier Chou En-lai stressed: The people of Viet Nam, Laos and
Cambodia will never stop their war against U.S. aggression and for
national salvation, nor will the Chinese Government and people cease
to support them, as long as U.S. imperialism clings to its aggression
against Viet Nam and Indochina. Victory certainly belongs to the
heroic Vietnamese people and other Indochinese people.

their henchmen cannot change this truth: Viet Nam is one country,
the Vietnamese are one nation. The people in the north and the south,
millions as one, are determined to fight and defeat the common
enemy.
Premier Chou En-lai stressed: The people of Viet Nam, Laos and
Cambodia will never stop their war against U.S. aggression and for
national salvation, nor will the Chinese Government and people cease
to support them, as long as U.S. imperialism clings to its aggression
against Viet Nam and Indochina. Victory certainly belongs to the
heroic Vietnamese people and other Indochinese people.

reactions to thecurrent Indochina situation are reprinted from the
April 21 issue of the Peking Review J
Premier Chou stated: The Chinese Government and people firmly
support the solemn and just stand of the April 11 statement of the
Government of the Democratic Republic of [North] Vietnam
(DRNV) and will give all-out support and assistance to the Vietnamese
people in carrying through to the end the war against U.S. aggression
and for national salvation.
He said: The U.S. imperialists' attacks on the D.R.V.N, constitute a
serious incident of expanding the war. The Chinese government and
people are closely following the development of this incident.
He pointed out: U.S. imperialism has already suffered ignominous
defeats in its war of aggression against Viet Nam. But, it still refuses to
take its defeat lying down. It is continuing its last-ditch fight, trying
to avert defeat by enlarging the scope of bombing. It will never
succeed in this, but will evoke stronger resistance from the
Vietnamese people and arouse the opposition of the people of the
world, including the American people.
Premier Chou expressed the conviction that, united as one, fighting
shoulder to shoulder and persisting in protracted resistance, the
people of Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia will surely frustrate the new
acts of aggression by U.S. imperialism and win complete victory in the
war against U.S. aggression and for national calvation.

Premier Chou En-lai said that the Chinese Government and people
firmly support the solemn and just stand of the Central Committee of
the South Viet Nam National Front for Liberation and the Provisional
Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam as
expressed in the appeal. He warmly congratulated the south
Vietnamese people and army on the brilliant victories they have won
on various battlefields.
Premier Chou En-lai pointed out: U.S. imperialism has employed
an unprecedented amount of naval and air forces to launch large-scale
attacks on south Viet Nam and the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam.
It even bombed Hanoi and Haiphong today in defiance of the
opposition of the people of the world, including the American people.
This shows it has embarked again on the old track of war escalation.
However, it will never succeed by this means in its attempt to
extricate itself from the defeat in its war of aggression against Viet
Nam and to prevent its policy of "Vietnamization of the war" from
going bankrupt. War escalation failed in the past and will continue to
fail.
The Premier stated: The new military adventure by U.S.
imperialism against the south and north of Viet Nam can frighten no
one, but will only further reveal its weakness and savage nature, make
the entire Vietnamese people unite ever more closely in their fight
against the enemy. As the appeal well puts it, the U.S. imperialists and
their henchmen cannot change this truth: Viet Nam is one country,
the Vietnamese are one nation. The people in the north and the south,
millions as one, are determined to fight and defeat the common
enemy.
