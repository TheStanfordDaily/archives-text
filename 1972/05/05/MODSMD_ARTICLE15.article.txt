C-15
Editor, THE DAILY:
As was reported in
Wednesday's Daily, the student
members of the Committee of
Fifteen walked out in protest of
the 8-7 decision to retain a
CJP-like judicial panel. I'd like to
clarify some of the reasons for our
"walkout."
First, WE HAVE NOT
RESIGNED, but are merely
awaiting direction from the
student body. I feel the student
members made many, perhaps too
many, compromises on the issue
of a student dominated judicial
panel; each and every compromise
was rejected by a faculty
administration faction of 8
members. I realized that with us
participating, or without us, the
present structure of the C-15
insures the defeat of major
student interests.
Our final suggestion last
Tuesday was to table the proposal
for a faculty-dominated panel and
discuss the more important issue
of the continued existence of the
C-15 itself. We wanted time to
make known our clear division of
opinion to the students, faculty,
and President Lyman, and to
receive input from these
constituencies. Our reasonable
proposal was again defeated,
leaving only the alternative of a
walkout to publicize the problems
within the C-15.
Further, I would like to answer
Mr. Friedenthal's allegation that
our "silly, foolish gesture"
abrogates our responsibility to

other reforms voted by the
students in April, 1971. We feel
that the composition of the
judicial panel is THE prime issue
of C-15 deliberations; while all
remaining issues are important,
they do not warrant our
legitimization of an unsatisfactory
total system. Besides, there is no
reason to believe at this time that
other meaningful concessions to
students can be made by the
committee.
Finally, Mr. Friedenthal
incorrectly asserted (or the Daily
incorrectly quoted him) that for
Honor Code violations, a 4-1
student majority panel will
deliberate. In fact, the full
committee last Tuesday
specifically voted TO REJECT
this proposal as a condescending
gesture indicative of the lack of
trust in students.
If the faculty-majority vote
passes unanswered by mass
student opinion, we can assume
that a "legitimized" CJP is here to
stay for a long time to come, and
with it precious little student
control over their own affairs. For
that reason, we will return to the
C-15 only after we have received,
via a referendum, direction from
our constituents.

This is the first paragraph of
my article on the Daily opinions
page May 2, which was omitted.

This paragraph is a significant
portion of the thoughts I wished
to share with the community:
I have attempted a number of
times through words and actions
to demonstrate my thoughts as a
pacifist involved in non-violent
social change here at Stanford. In
the last few weeks I have
attempted to set down in writing
a sense of what I would like to see
at Stanford and why I see
Stanford University as a
corporation deeply involved in
the war. I have thrown away each
article I wrote because they all
seemed too harsh and
condescending to the
administration. I think the most I
can do now, is with this notice of
harshness, present these thoughts
to the people of the Stanford
Community.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Peter Brimelow's letter on
Ireland published in Wednesday's
Daily should be responded to.

Mr. Brimelow contends that
"conquest was, is, and always will
be the only title to land." This is
false, even malicious, for this is an
endorsement of robbery and
brigandage. It is homesteading and
homesteading alone which
establishes legitimate original title
to land. A natural resource
becomes an extension of a man's
personality by his mixing his labor
with it. Any person who
subsequently steals this resource is
a thief.
Some people, like Mr.
Brimelow and the anonymous
author of The Arena's article on
the current Irish question, believe
that toughness is the solution to
every problem. Well, toughness
may be appropriate, but only
after it has first been established
where justice lies.
In Ireland, justice demands an
end to British imperial rule.
Although Mr. Brimelow may find
it unusual for someone to adopt
the logical conclusions of his
position, I do indeed call for the
eviction of the Americans and the
Israeli Zionists from any lands
taken from native American or
Palestinian cultivators and owners.
Mr. Brimelow also contended

that I hold a mistaken view of
Ireland's past. An interesting
description of the relatively free
society in Ireland before the
English invasions is contained in
Sophie Bryant's Liberty, Order,
Law Under Native Irish Rule.
Even if ancient Ireland were an
oppressive society that would
only be an argument for an Irish
revolution, not an argument for
English conquest and land theft.

Mr. Brimelow also contended

that I hold a mistaken view of
Ireland's past. An interesting
description of the relatively free
society in Ireland before the
English invasions is contained in
Sophie Bryant's Liberty, Order,

Even if ancient Ireland were an
oppressive society that would
only be an argument for an Irish
revolution, not an argument for
English conquest and land theft.

Editor, THE DAILY:
As was reported in
Wednesday's Daily, the student
members of the Committee of
Fifteen walked out in protest of
the 8-7 decision to retain a
CJP-like judicial panel. I'd like to
clarify some of the reasons for our
"walkout."
First, WE HAVE NOT
RESIGNED, but are merely
awaiting direction from the
student body. I feel the student
members made many, perhaps too
many, compromises on the issue
of a student dominated judicial
panel; each and every compromise
was rejected by a faculty
administration faction of 8
members. I realized that with us
participating, or without us, the
present structure of the C-15
insures the defeat of major
student interests.
Our final suggestion last
Tuesday was to table the proposal
for a faculty-dominated panel and
discuss the more important issue
of the continued existence of the
C-15 itself. We wanted time to
make known our clear division of
opinion to the students, faculty,
and President Lyman, and to
receive input from these
constituencies. Our reasonable
proposal was again defeated,
leaving only the alternative of a
walkout to publicize the problems
within the C-15.
Further, I would like to answer
Mr. Friedenthal's allegation that
our "silly, foolish gesture"
abrogates our responsibility to

other reforms voted by the
students in April, 1971. We feel
that the composition of the
judicial panel is THE prime issue
of C-15 deliberations; while all
remaining issues are important,
they do not warrant our
legitimization of an unsatisfactory
total system. Besides, there is no
reason to believe at this time that
other meaningful concessions to
students can be made by the
committee.
Finally, Mr. Friedenthal
incorrectly asserted (or the Daily
incorrectly quoted him) that for
Honor Code violations, a 4-1
student majority panel will
deliberate. In fact, the full
committee last Tuesday
specifically voted TO REJECT
this proposal as a condescending
gesture indicative of the lack of
trust in students.
If the faculty-majority vote
passes unanswered by mass
student opinion, we can assume
that a "legitimized" CJP is here to
stay for a long time to come, and
with it precious little student
control over their own affairs. For
that reason, we will return to the
C-15 only after we have received,
via a referendum, direction from
our constituents.

This is the first paragraph of
my article on the Daily opinions

This paragraph is a significant
portion of the thoughts I wished
to share with the community:
I have attempted a number of
times through words and actions
to demonstrate my thoughts as a
pacifist involved in non-violent
social change here at Stanford. In
the last few weeks I have
attempted to set down in writing
a sense of what I would like to see
at Stanford and why I see
Stanford University as a
corporation deeply involved in
the war. I have thrown away each
article I wrote because they all
seemed too harsh and
condescending to the
administration. I think the most I
can do now, is with this notice of
harshness, present these thoughts
to the people of the Stanford

Peter Brimelow's letter on
Ireland published in Wednesday's
Daily should be responded to.

Mr. Brimelow contends that
"conquest was, is, and always will
be the only title to land." This is
false, even malicious, for this is an
endorsement of robbery and
brigandage. It is homesteading and
homesteading alone which
establishes legitimate original title
to land. A natural resource
becomes an extension of a man's
personality by his mixing his labor
with it. Any person who
subsequently steals this resource is
a thief.
Some people, like Mr.
Brimelow and the anonymous
author of The Arena's article on
the current Irish question, believe
that toughness is the solution to
every problem. Well, toughness
may be appropriate, but only
after it has first been established
where justice lies.
In Ireland, justice demands an
end to British imperial rule.
Although Mr. Brimelow may find
it unusual for someone to adopt
the logical conclusions of his
position, I do indeed call for the
eviction of the Americans and the
Israeli Zionists from any lands
taken from native American or
Palestinian cultivators and owners.
Mr. Brimelow also contended

becomes an extension of a man's
personality by his mixing his labor
with it. Any person who
subsequently steals this resource is
a thief.
Some people, like Mr.
Brimelow and the anonymous
author of The Arena's article on
the current Irish question, believe
that toughness is the solution to
every problem. Well, toughness
may be appropriate, but only
after it has first been established
where justice lies.
In Ireland, justice demands an
end to British imperial rule.
Although Mr. Brimelow may find
it unusual for someone to adopt
the logical conclusions of his
position, I do indeed call for the
eviction of the Americans and the
Israeli Zionists from any lands
taken from native American or
Palestinian cultivators and owners.
Mr. Brimelow also contended

that I hold a mistaken view of
Ireland's past. An interesting
description of the relatively free
society in Ireland before the
English invasions is contained in
Sophie Bryant's Liberty, Order,
Law Under Native Irish Rule.
Even if ancient Ireland were an
oppressive society that would
only be an argument for an Irish
revolution, not an argument for
English conquest and land theft.

C-15
Editor, THE DAILY:
As was reported in
Wednesday's Daily, the student
members of the Committee of
Fifteen walked out in protest of
the 8-7 decision to retain a
CJP-like judicial panel. I'd like to
clarify some of the reasons for our
"walkout."
First, WE HAVE NOT
RESIGNED, but are merely
awaiting direction from the
student body. I feel the student
members made many, perhaps too
many, compromises on the issue
of a student dominated judicial
panel; each and every compromise
was rejected by a faculty
administration faction of 8
members. I realized that with us
participating, or without us, the
present structure of the C-15
insures the defeat of major
student interests.
Our final suggestion last
Tuesday was to table the proposal
for a faculty-dominated panel and
discuss the more important issue
of the continued existence of the
C-15 itself. We wanted time to
make known our clear division of
opinion to the students, faculty,
and President Lyman, and to
receive input from these
constituencies. Our reasonable
proposal was again defeated,
leaving only the alternative of a
walkout to publicize the problems
within the C-15.
Further, I would like to answer
Mr. Friedenthal's allegation that
our "silly, foolish gesture"
abrogates our responsibility to

other reforms voted by the
students in April, 1971. We feel
that the composition of the
judicial panel is THE prime issue
of C-15 deliberations; while all
remaining issues are important,
they do not warrant our
legitimization of an unsatisfactory
total system. Besides, there is no
reason to believe at this time that
other meaningful concessions to
students can be made by the
committee.
Finally, Mr. Friedenthal
incorrectly asserted (or the Daily
incorrectly quoted him) that for
Honor Code violations, a 4-1
student majority panel will
deliberate. In fact, the full
committee last Tuesday
specifically voted TO REJECT
this proposal as a condescending
gesture indicative of the lack of
trust in students.
If the faculty-majority vote
passes unanswered by mass
student opinion, we can assume
that a "legitimized" CJP is here to
stay for a long time to come, and
with it precious little student
control over their own affairs. For
that reason, we will return to the
C-15 only after we have received,
via a referendum, direction from
our constituents.

Non-Violent
Editor, THE DAILY:
This is the first paragraph of
my article on the Daily opinions
page May 2, which was omitted.

This paragraph is a significant
portion of the thoughts I wished
to share with the community:
I have attempted a number of
times through words and actions
to demonstrate my thoughts as a
pacifist involved in non-violent
social change here at Stanford. In
the last few weeks I have
attempted to set down in writing
a sense of what I would like to see
at Stanford and why I see
Stanford University as a
corporation deeply involved in
the war. I have thrown away each
article I wrote because they all
seemed too harsh and
condescending to the
administration. I think the most I
can do now, is with this notice of
harshness, present these thoughts
to the people of the Stanford
Community.

BRIMELOW
Editor, THE DAILY:
Peter Brimelow's letter on
Ireland published in Wednesday's
Daily should be responded to.

Mr. Brimelow contends that
"conquest was, is, and always will
be the only title to land." This is
false, even malicious, for this is an
endorsement of robbery and
brigandage. It is homesteading and
homesteading alone which
establishes legitimate original title
to land. A natural resource
becomes an extension of a man's
personality by his mixing his labor
with it. Any person who
subsequently steals this resource is
a thief.
