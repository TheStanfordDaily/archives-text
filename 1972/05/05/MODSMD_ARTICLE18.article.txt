# China Scholars Report Impressions Of Visit
## 
### 
The following impressions of China
are exerpts of an interview with
William Joseph and Molly Cove, two
student members of the Committee of
Concerned Asian Scholars (CCAS)
who recently returned from a month
long visit.
The two were part of a thirty
member CCAS delegation, most of
whom speak and read Chinese, which
toured China from March 10 to April
14. During the trip members visited
Canton, Shanghai, Peking, and several
small cities.
They toured factories, rural
communes, hospitals, a prison,
government offices, Peking University,
and the offices of the People's Daily,
the official government newspaper. In
addition, the group met informally for
four hours with Chinese Premier Owu
En-lai.
Joseph and Coye are both enrolled
in the M.A. program in East Asian
Studies. Other Stanford members of
the CCAS delegation were Robert
Entenmann, East Asian Studies;
Gordon White, Political science; and
John Beminghausen, Asian iMnguages.
The interview was conducted by Daily
reporter Bob Litterman.
What was your most memorable
impression of China?
JOSEPH: I think the one word 1
would settle on would be optimism.
That was particularly important for
me after I'd been in America for these
last years and involved in the student
movement, and seeing increasing
despair, increasing frustration, and
increasing tensions. China provided
quite a contrast to that in the
optimism that the people afford to the
future. This doesn't mean to say that
they don't have problems - there are
tremendous problems and struggles
still in Chinese society on all levels -
but the critical difference is in the
attitudes that people take in
approaching those problems. It is
essentially one of determination,
self-confidence, and as I said,
optimism.
COYE: Everytliing that 1 saw in China
nade so much sense. It seems to me
that Chinese society and the way the
people of China run their own society
makes more sense than any society
I've ever seen ... It's very decent
society and very matter of fact. I think
this is partly why some Americans
describe it as drab or grim because it
is so purposeful .... In China people
really derive enjoyment from their

jobs and from things which in America
most people just have to put up with.
What did you think of Peking
University?
JOSEPH: We were only there a day
and one half, but we did have the
opportunity to attend classes, to spend
a night in one of the dorms with
students, to eat with them and to
communicate directly. I would say
that Peking University is a
tremendously exiciting place that is in
the process of great transformation, as
is the whole educational system since
the cultural revolution. There are
problems and experiments going on,
but it is so different from anything we
would conceptualize as a university in
a lot of aspects, that it is almost hard
to relate to. . . .
Students are taken from the whole
broad range of society. The emphasis
of admission criterion is on personal
recommendation from your unit
according to political criterion, how
good a person you arc politically and
how well you relate to the other
people in your unit. . . , They take
people from all walks of life. They go
out to the communes, out to the

factories, into the armies, to find the
students now, and don't just rely on
the high schools feeding them in. At
present the figures they give are 40
percent workers, 40 percent peasants,
I0 percent soldiers and 10 percent
others, by which they mean
intellectuals, people who might have
come directly from high school, or
official families, and so on.
COYE: If you took the fifteen or
twenty most basic departments in
American Universities, that's what
departments they have. .. . The
students in each department live in a
dorm together and have a dining room
together. To give you some idea of
how the system operates, we were
eating dinner with the students at one
point, and another person came and
sat down at our table, and I asked him
whether he was first or second year,
and it turned out he was a
professor . . . another thing, the dining
room is totally on a trust system so
that each student keeps his own
private accounting of what he has
eaten during a month, and at the end
of the month he tells how much he
spent and then gives them the money.
How would you compare the Chinese
newspapers and the western press, and
did you get the impression that the
Chinese believe their newspapers?
COYE: I think the Chinese definitely
believe them, but Chinese newspapers
are a very different thing from what
they are in the U.S. Sometimes the
People's Daily doesn'tget out until late
in the afternoon, and sometimes not
until the next day, and this really
surprised us - blew our minds to think
of a newspaper just not happening to
come out for a day. The reason is that
most of the news isn't something that
happened just the day before, but
essays, analysis and editorials. There is
also factual news, but it isn't very
important that it appear right the day
after it happens.
A great deal of thought at the
newspaper itself, in the offices, goes
into discussing what is the importance
of the news, discussing with the reader
what the meaning of the news is and
trying to analyze the place of this
event in the larger pattern with what's
gone before and with what might
happen in the future.
JOSEPH: Somebody who has been
brought up in the west would tend to
look at the People's Daily and say man
what a drag, that stuff is not very
interesting. But the point that is being

missed is that the People's Daily really
writes articles and prints articles that
relate to the lives of the people and to
their most intimate struggles. It
doesn't feed them things and stories
that give them fantasies that make
them worry about the perversions of
society. It builds the whole mood of
optimism in society.
What are living conditions like in
China today?
JOSEPH: I think an American going
there and taking it completely out of
context would say it was very, very
poor. The conditions are very simple,
they admit. In the cities, for example,
the housing is crowded. But you have
to make all these judgments against
the baseline of what China was like 20
years ago. You can say today that
everybody has secure housing,
everybody has got enough to eat. It's
not luxurious by our standards, but
it's adequate. For every person in
China to be provided with adequate
housing, adequate clothing, adequate
food, adequate education, is such a
tremendous achievement in 20 years,
that you really cannot use any other
standard by which to make a

judgment.
CO YE: What you find is that life in
China is very spartan, I think that is
even a better word than poor, because
when we think of poverty, we think of
filth. This is what you find in Taiwan,
.. . poor areas where some people live
are dirty, there is not good sanitation,
not good medical care, it's like poverty
in America. Whereas, in China, instead
of having some poor and some rich,
and being able to tell the poorer area
because of the filth and the lack of
health and everything, instead
everybody is at an equal level of
spartan kind of living.Everything is
terribly simple and clean, but very
adequate . . . and there aren't a lot of
signs that they are going to go very
fast above that level.
JOSEPH: The equality of living is an
important point. I remember we
visited one huge factory, a steel and
iron complex in Peking that employed
30,000 people, and . . . some members
of our delegation were shocked to find
that there was a two to one wage
differential between the highest paid
cadre official, and the highest paid
worker who wasn't cadre . . . and there
are differences, and there are gaps, but
the motion of the society is to close
them, and the gaps which do exist are
so narrow in comparison to most other
countries that it's not bad.
What would an ambitious person in
China strive for?
COYE: If you could grow up, and at
the age of 30 or 40, be the kind of
person where your neighbor said,
"now if you want to take someone
with a really good working spirit, take
Lao Yo," and if you could be that
person, that everybody thought had
really good working spirit, then you
probably have achieved about the
greatest mark that you would want to
achieve in your life. This working
spirit doesn't just mean that you go

you deal with in any ordinary day is a
fairly given set, . . . and this creates a
much more stable, solid kind of basis
for your social relations, so that, for
instance, there was much less open
sexual display than there is in the
United States - yet it became clear
that there was a tremendous amount
of affection between individuals.
Because there was such a long time
span to express it, and it was such a
sort of calm society in a sense,
compared to our personal relations, it
didn't seem strange to me that there
weren't people walking around with
their arms around each other, and this
kind of thing.
It also became clear as we saw lots
of boys and girls walking around
together, in parks and so on, that the
process, which probably takes up half
of the average American's thinking
life, of trying to find a partner and
either staying with him or breaking up
with him, in China is a much more
slower paced calm process than it is in

out and work hard eight hours a day.
It means that you help other people,
and a whole bunch of puritan type of
values are built into it. It often means
that you have overcome some kind of
difficulty.
I would think that if you were born
in a very intellectual background, and
were given many different kinds of
opportunities, you might be frustrated
if you were an ambitious person,
because you would have nothing to
voercome except your own
background. In other words, anything
that you did would tend to be
regarded as somehow related to your
background.
What kinds of questions did the
Chinese people ask you?
CO YE: The First question that they
invariably ask you when you have
finished asking them questions is,
"What is the current state of the
American revolution?" And you can
imagine how difficult that is to
answer, and after they notice our
confusion and hesitancy in trying to
answer that, then they will go on to
ask questions about America which
demonstrate that most Chinese know
as little about Americans, as
Americans know about China.
JOSEPH: For example, someone will
ask what is the condition of the
peasants in the United States ... but
that question is no worse really than
someone in America asking about the
Communists destroying the family.
Both questions just show some lack of
understanding.
What has Communism done to the
family?
COYE: It's the basic social unit ... If
anything, Communism has
strengthened it, liberated it. The
woman works, and the children can be
in a nursery. So the woman is much
more equal to a man, and the children
are much more free of their parents
domination. But it is still the basic,
basic unit in CHINESE SOCIETY'
MORE THAN THE INDIVIDUAL'
Are Interpersonal relationships
changed under Chinese Communism?
COYE: I guess the thing there that I
sort of sensed, is that people tend to
have a more matter of fact kind of
relationship. I've been trying to think
of the reason for it, and I think part of
the reason is that here in the United
States, you are so mobile, and
constantly going into new situations,
and facing new people — people have
an incredible level of tensions and
frustrations and ambivalences about
their relations with each other. People
you work with, people you go out
with, and this kind of thing.
In China, the range of people who

the United States. You tend to meet
y'bur partner at work and you tend not
even to be thinking in those terms
until much later in your life. You talk
to girls who are 24 or 25 years old,
and they are just beginning to start
thinking about beginning to look for
sombody, and they will meet that
person through work or through
school or through some kind of
political activity, and the whole
process is much more normal.
JOSEPH: We asked one girl, who was a
barefoot doctor in a commune that we
stayed at, what girls her age look for in
a husband, She summed it up by
saying first of all you wanted a hard
workers, you wanted somebody who
was politically good, politically active,
and she said, "being bad, politically, in
the new society is like being ugly in
the old society." ... as a criterion for
success, for making judgments of other
people, it is in final essence, much
more humane.
COYE: And another thing was a sense
of humor, and it took a long time to
understand because it's not as saterical
and as cynical as the American sense
of humor is, but it does exist, and I
think the Chinese appreciate it very,
very much.
How important is the army in China
today?
COYE: What you have is an army that
is sort of civilianized. The army
becomes a part of civilian life. You see
army uniforms everywhere on the
street. They are working in factories,
in hospitals, often in positions of
leadership . . . but it really came to the
point where you don't notice PLA
(Peoples Liberation Army). They are
just a part of society.
JOSEPH: One thing about the army
if you ask somebody in high school
what kind of career lie wants to
pursue ... if you press them . . . and
say if you had your choice, what
specifically would you like to do, I
think the highest choice would be the
army, "I'd love to go in the army,"
that even comes before going to the
university, and in fact, entering the
army is terribly competitive. It's as
hard to get into the army as it is to get
into the University. . . .
How important is the Sino-Soviet
split?
COYE: The Chinese people right now
are more aware of, and are thinking
more about the Russians as enemies
than they are of the United
States ... I think they feel that in a
sense the defeat of imperialism or
capitalism and imperialism, by what
they would call true Communism is
historically assured, that it is going to
be a long struggle, and there will be

setbacks, but right now that the
United States, and other imperialist
powers have suffered really weakening
blows from the people of Vietnam and
other countries, whereas Russia
represents a new kind of danger, that
of revisionism — a kind of socialism
which in fact will divert
anti-imperialist and communist forces
from this historical process, which is
the real danger, and I think they feel,
the more pressing danger right
n0w....
JOSEPH: The key to defeating
capitalism,and capitalist imperialism is
the unity of the socialist world, and
the Soviet Union blocks the final
victory by threatening to split the
socialist world, and so that is the
primary, primary struggle - it is a
forging of unity according to the
correct path.
What about the regimentation we hear
about in China?
JOSEPH: For a while there I was
getting some sense of that, and trying

at the end of your sentence, no matter
what. And they said that almost
nobody ever returns to prison.
Does everyone really wear Mao
buttons and carry his little red book?
COYE: That was the cultural
revolution, and even Chairman Mao
said that was an excess of the cultural
revolution, and people should go in
the other direction. People wear
buttons when they feel like it, and
some people wear buttons, and some
people don't, there doesn't seem to be
any pattern to it. People don't carry
little red books, except when they
were going to a study session or a class
or something. . . .
JOSEPH: But they don't even really
use books of quotations any more,
now they use books of complete
essays....
COYE: To some extent the little red
book was intended as a starter, to get
people really involved in political
study, and now they read Marx and
Engels, and Lenin and Mao's selected
works.
JOSEPH: Chairman Mao is an idea,
and an ideal, and imbodies values. He
is not presented as a Stalin — it's more
detached than that. He is the focus of
values, the integrating legend, the
integrating myth... he gives it a
cohesive bond and it's almost
depersonalized. Now he has pulled
back on the myth, because he knows
that a society that becomes totally
reliant on one individual is too fragile.
What criticisms would you make?
JOSEPH: ... 1 think more things are
emerging, but I think a criticisum you
could offer is that there is not great
variety in cultural performances. . . .
I'm a little disturbed by the
pervasiveness of the bureaucracy
which seems a little too thick. .. .
COYE: Another thing, is that they say
that women haven't progressed far
enough in liberation and that although
in order to have women liberated, you
have to have a socialist system, a
socialist system doesn't necessarily
guarantee the liberation of women.
They have to work at it still. In dealing
ourselves with the Chinese it became
obvious that the Chinese bureaucracy,
which like any other bureaucracy
might tend to be slow functioning and
have red tape is perhaps even slower
because it often takes groups to make
decisions, rather than a single
individual.
JOSEPH: ... but there are any
number of other criticisms that you
can make, from the fact that the
housing is crowded, the public
transportation is crowded, to the
pervasiveness of political slogans. But I
think all of those are western biases. I
am hesitant to make any critical
judgment, because it totally disregards
the fact of progress in 20 years which
has been just astounding, and the fact
that people have got a secure life in
China today.
COYE: If you look at any other place
in Asia, a lot of us have lived in many
other countries in Asia, and the
difference, from India, Thailand,
Singapore, Indonesia, Taiwan, is
astounding.
JOSEPH: ... or the Philippines, which
I visited right after I left China, the
difference was a shock, a shock.
COYE: China really is the most decent
society that 1 have ever studied about
or seen and while a lot of it is not
directly transferable to the United
States, you can learn a lot about what
you would criticize in the United
States by going to China.
You can take heart in the idea that
if they can do that much in 20 years,
that a lot of the things that seem
impossible to us to change, can be
changed, and that not only can you
destroy things, but you can
reconstruct things in a way that makes
sense, and is decent, and gives a
humane life to people. There is reason
to tear down old things, because there
really is a possibility of a decent
future. And that is something . . . that
in itself is a very encouraging thing.

to understand a little bit more the
ature of this perception. At one point
at Peking University where everyone
came out of the dormitory, lined up,
and marched singing a song, in sort of
a military fashion to the dining hall,
one person in our group who was a CO
and a life long pacifist standing next to
me said, "For Christ sake, I've been
opposed to this all my life, and here I
am in China, and I've got to march in
file to dinner singing a military
song. . and at that point, I began to
think about it harder, . . . and the
conceptualization that I come up with
is a distinction between what we have
labled regimentation and control, a
distinction between that and
revolutionary discipline . . . and there
is no doubt that the people in China
are disciplined.
And this increases both efficiency
and order, but I don't think that is the
lesson. I think the lesson is in the
unity that it builds, and the spirit it
builds of comradcry. When those
people were marching together to the
dining hall, and singing those songs,
they were really together for five
minutes, and that has got a
tremendous effect on the way you
perceive your whole life, your
relationship with society, and the way
you will approach problems.
What was the prison you visited like?
CO YE: In China we found that half of
the people in prison arc political
prisoners, and half are in for other
kinds of crime, but it's only if again
and again and again you show yourself
to be absolutely intransigent will you
ever wind up in something like a
prison. For the population of
4,000,000 in Tientsin, there was a
prison of 1100 people, which gives
you some idea of how small the prison
population is.
Although there is no doubt that it
is a prison, . . . there was almost no
sign of the kind of brutality that is the
atmosphere of American prisons. The
guards don't have billy clubs or arms
of any kind, the security was really
what seemed to be sufficient, but
nothing more .... The answers that
the prison officials gave our
questions gave us the feeling again that
this was sort of a common sense
methodical approach "these people arc
just intransigent, they've been brought
here to protect society against them,
and to give them another attempt at
re-education," and they spend half
their time at political re-education. . . .
There is a serious effort made to
reform people, and there arc definite
sentences, and even if you have not
been reformed as much as the prison
authorities would like, you are let out

'...China Really Is The Most Decent Society
That I Have Ever Studied About Or Seen...'

Chinese Premier Chou En-lai laid greatest emphasis in his remarks on the
continuing war in Indochina, according to a CCAS statement. It said the premier
"strongly supported the struggle of the people of Vietnam against Americar
imperialism," and that "China and not the Soviet Union would be directly
threatened by further escalation on the part of the United States."
