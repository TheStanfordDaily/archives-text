# Imaginative 'Sequoia'
## 
### DONALD DAVIE 
We call Sequoia a magazine,
but really it can't have much
consistency from one school year
to the next, so we ought to think
of each new issue as a
self-contained anthology. The new
issue is an unusually good buy
because, as has happened too
seldom in the past, the editors
have set a standard, kept to it, and
followed their own tastes, which
seem to be for pathos and
compassion and subdued tone.
We are spared poems or stories
that are merely ego-trips for
attitudinizing and self-absorbed

personalities, and if the over-all
impression is a bit too muted for
some tastes, at least there's Al
Young showing how the real
professional can get pathos out of
strident images, not just twilit
ones.
The other established author
represented is Wendell Berry, with
two typical though slight pieces,
considerably enhanced by a facing
photograph by Gordon Fowler.
The editors have done a fine job
in placing the graphics (Fowler's
imaginative work in particular)
whichhelpthe text and are helped
by. it-
Robert Kirschner's story
labours the pathos a shade too
much, and Bart Thurber's on the
otherhand ends too soon and too
abruptly; but both pieces of
writing are scrupulous, concerned
with the subject to be rendered,
not with the personality of the
author. The same can be said of
the poems, and those who read
the current run of literary
magazines will know what high
praise this is.
Michael Stillman's fastidious
accomplishment in diction and
versification over-reaches itself
only once, I think — in
"Departure", a poem that I find
obscure. The other poets have
styles no less effective for being
less obviously elegant , than
Stillman's. Altogether this is a
miscellany that we can
confidently show around as an
example of some of the distinctive
virtues of writing at Stanford.

Robert Kirschner's story
labours the pathos a shade too
much, and Bart Thurber's on the
otherhand ends too soon and too
abruptly; but both pieces of
writing are scrupulous, concerned
with the subject to be rendered,
not with the personality of the
author. The same can be said of
the poems, and those who read
the current run of literary
magazines will know what high
praise this is.
Michael Stillman's fastidious
accomplishment in diction and
versification over-reaches itself
only once, I think — in
"Departure", a poem that I find
obscure. The other poets have
styles no less effective for being
less obviously elegant , than
Stillman's. Altogether this is a
miscellany that we can
confidently show around as an
example of some of the distinctive
virtues of writing at Stanford.

We call Sequoia a magazine,
but really it can't have much
consistency from one school year
to the next, so we ought to think
of each new issue as a
self-contained anthology. The new
issue is an unusually good buy
because, as has happened too
seldom in the past, the editors
have set a standard, kept to it, and
followed their own tastes, which
seem to be for pathos and
compassion and subdued tone.
We are spared poems or stories
that are merely ego-trips for
attitudinizing and self-absorbed

personalities, and if the over-all
impression is a bit too muted for
some tastes, at least there's Al
Young showing how the real
professional can get pathos out of
strident images, not just twilit
ones.
The other established author
represented is Wendell Berry, with
two typical though slight pieces,
considerably enhanced by a facing
photograph by Gordon Fowler.
