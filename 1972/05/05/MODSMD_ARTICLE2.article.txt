# More U.S. Jets Sent; Peace Talks Halted

From the Associated Press
A Pentagon spokesman reveal
ed yesterday that the U.S. will soon
fly 72 more F-4 Phantom fighter
bombers to Southeast Asia, indicat
ing a step-up of the current bombing
campaign aimed at stopping the
current North Vietnamese offensive.
The significant boost in U.S. air
power came soon after peace negotia
tions again broke down in Paris, and
amid a battlefield crisis in South
Vietnam.
Four squadrons of F-4's will leave
Holloman Air Force Base in New
Mexico for Thailand, other defense
sources added after Pentagon spokes
man J.W. Freidheim refused further
comment.
The United States and South
Vietnam called off the Vietnam peace
talks indefinitely yesterday because of
what was termed by chief U.S.
delegate, William J. Porter, "a lack of
progress in every available channel."
In announcing the suspension of
the conference, Porter apparently
:eferred to secret talks with the
Communists as well as the semipublic
meetings. U.S. and North Vietnamese
officials refused to confirm the secret
talks.
Kissinger Talks
However, it has been rumored that
a high American official, possibly
President Nixon's national security
advisor, Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, met
earlier this week with North Vietnam
ese politburo member Le Due Tho.
Kissinger and Tho met secretly and
fruitlessly in Paris several times last
year.

Porter indicated last week he would
suspend the talks if the North
Vietnamese did not agree to put an
end to their invasion. A U.S. spokes
man told newsmen that the minimum
sign that the United States would be
prepared to resume serious negotia
tions would be that it would return to
the plenary sessions of the conference.
In battle action yesterday, South
Vietnamese paratroopers launched the
government's first counterattack since
the North Vietnamese opened their
spring offensive. The successful coun
terattack, in the central highlands, was
designed to end the isolation by road
of Kontum, the provincial capital that
is expected to be the first objective
when the Communist push comes there.
Meanwhile, the Viet Cong's clan
destine radio said a "revolutionary
administration" had been set up in
Quang Tri, the northernmost provin
cial capital that fell to the North
Vietnamese Monday. It is expected
that Communist forces, probably re
grouping and resupplying, will assault
the ancient capitol of Hue, to the
south of Quang Tri, in the next several
days.
On the national scene, 87 persons
were arrested in San Diego for staging
an anti-war sit-in at the 11th U.S.
naval district headquarters. Police and
witnesses said the 87 were part of a
throng of about 1,000 persons who
participated in a half-mile march called
as part of a nationwide effort by peace
groups to protest stepped up bombing
attacks by the United States in
Vietnam.
