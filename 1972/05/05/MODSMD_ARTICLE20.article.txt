# Mason's New Band Sounds So Good
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
One of the greatest live
performances of a single song that
I have ever heard occurred last
January at Winterland when Dave
Mason and Carlos Santana
jammed with the new Traffic in a
truly remarkable 15 minute
version of the old Spencer Davis
song, "Gimme Some Lovin'." At
that time, I kind of wished that
Mason might rejoin the three
other members of the original
Traffic, who had amply
demonstrated that night why
Traffic was for so long considered
to be one of the English
supergroups.
But last weekend Mason
returned to Winterland and he
showed that two fine groups have
grown out of the original Traffic,
the new Traffic, which is
composed of Steve Winwood, Jim
Capaldi and Chris Wood from the
original group plus three
newcomers, and Mason's own new
band, formed last October.
Mason, who is now living in
San Francisco, is backed very
admirably by keyboard artist
Mark Jordan, (who used to play
with Van Morrison), drummer
Rick Jaeger, who has played with
Everly Brothers and A.B. Skhy;
bassist Lonnie Turner, who used
to play with Steve Miller; and
conga player Kwasi Dzidzornu,
who has played with Taj Mahal
and the Rolling Stones.
Guitar Virtuosity
Mason opened his set with two
cuts off of an early Traffic album,
"You Can All Join In," and
"Pearly Queen" and they sounded
remarkably like the album
versions I liked so much. Then
Dave showed some outstanding
guitar virtuosity on Bob Dylan's
"All Along The Watchtower." On
"Watchtower," both Jordan and
Jaeger had some very nice
passages.
The Pointer Sisters, who used
to perform often with Elvin
Bishop, joined Mason for about
half of his set and did their
usually great job of both singing
and dancing. Their vocal work was
clear and well-articulated and
never overshadowed Mason's lead
vocals.
Mason did almost every
number well, but he was
particularly impressive near the
ond of his set on two classics, the
Delaney and Bonnie hit, "Only
You Know And 1 Know"and
perhaps my favorite of all the
original Traffic songs, "Feelin'
Alright." After a large ovation,
Mason began his first encore by
performing a truly rocking

versionof Buddy Holly's "That'll
Be The Day"and then got into,
you guessed it, "Gimme Some
Lovin'."
Outstanding Musicians
The audience went wild at the
end of the first encore and Mason
finally calmed them down with a
slow second encore which ended a
truly amazing set that had lasted
well over an hour. Having seen
both the new Traffic and now
Mason's new group, I can
undeniably say that they prove
very completely that the original
Traffic was made up of four
outstanding musicians.
Mason's set had been
immediately preceded by an
unfortunately weak set by one of
my favorite solo blues performers,
Taj Mahal. Taj seemed a bit tired
and he never got into his usual
fine form. Luckily Taj seemed to
realize he wasn't up to it and
performed a fairly short set. I can
forgive a bad night by Taj though,
since I've seen him have so many
good ones.
The night opened for me with
a very refreshing set by the Kenny
Loggins Band with Jim Messina,
since I arrived too late for the
show's short opening set by solo
pianist/vocalist Pamela Polland,
Kenny Loggins, best known for
having written the Nitty Gritty
Dirt Band hit "House At Pooh
Comer" and Messina, formerly
with Poco and the Buffalo
Springfield, have formed one of
the best new groups on the rock
scene.
Light Rock
Loggins and Messina do the
primary guitar and vocal work.
They are good on hom acoustic
and electric numbers and their
vocal harmony is very, very nice.
They are backed up quite
creditably by two sax players, a
bass player and a drummer. The
Loggins band is basically a light
rock group with a country twist
to many of their songs. But they
have a varied repertoire and are
equally talented on rockers like
"Back To Georgia" and "Listen
To A Country Song" and
mellower things like "Peace Of
Mind" and the beautiful "Danny's
Song."
Most of the material they
played so well is included on their
first album, "Sittin' In," which is
undoubtedly one of the album
finds of recent months. Bill
Graham put it well after their set
when he said, "We're going to be
hearing from these people for quite
awhile."
It was really enjoyable to hear
such fine sets by both a rising new

group and a seasoned veteran
performer, with a new band. And
realizing that Taj's disappointing
set was probably only a
temporary thing, I'd have to say it
was a fine musical evening indeed.

Mason opened his set with two
cuts off of an early Traffic album,
"You Can All Join In," and
"Pearly Queen" and they sounded
remarkably like the album
versions I liked so much. Then
Dave showed some outstanding
guitar virtuosity on Bob Dylan's
"All Along The Watchtower." On
"Watchtower," both Jordan and
Jaeger had some very nice
passages.
The Pointer Sisters, who used
to perform often with Elvin
Bishop, joined Mason for about
half of his set and did their
usually great job of both singing
and dancing. Their vocal work was
clear and well-articulated and
never overshadowed Mason's lead
vocals.
Mason did almost every
number well, but he was
particularly impressive near the
ond of his set on two classics, the
Delaney and Bonnie hit, "Only
You Know And 1 Know"and
perhaps my favorite of all the
original Traffic songs, "Feelin'
Alright." After a large ovation,
Mason began his first encore by
performing a truly rocking

versionof Buddy Holly's "That'll
Be The Day"and then got into,
you guessed it, "Gimme Some
Lovin'."
Outstanding Musicians
The audience went wild at the
end of the first encore and Mason
finally calmed them down with a
slow second encore which ended a
truly amazing set that had lasted
well over an hour. Having seen
both the new Traffic and now
Mason's new group, I can
undeniably say that they prove
very completely that the original
Traffic was made up of four
outstanding musicians.
Mason's set had been
immediately preceded by an
unfortunately weak set by one of
my favorite solo blues performers,
Taj Mahal. Taj seemed a bit tired
and he never got into his usual
fine form. Luckily Taj seemed to
realize he wasn't up to it and
performed a fairly short set. I can
forgive a bad night by Taj though,
since I've seen him have so many
good ones.
The night opened for me with
a very refreshing set by the Kenny
Loggins Band with Jim Messina,
since I arrived too late for the
show's short opening set by solo
pianist/vocalist Pamela Polland,
Kenny Loggins, best known for
having written the Nitty Gritty
Dirt Band hit "House At Pooh
Comer" and Messina, formerly
with Poco and the Buffalo
Springfield, have formed one of
the best new groups on the rock
scene.
Light Rock
Loggins and Messina do the
primary guitar and vocal work.
They are good on hom acoustic
and electric numbers and their
vocal harmony is very, very nice.
They are backed up quite
creditably by two sax players, a
bass player and a drummer. The
Loggins band is basically a light
rock group with a country twist
to many of their songs. But they
have a varied repertoire and are
equally talented on rockers like
"Back To Georgia" and "Listen
To A Country Song" and
mellower things like "Peace Of
Mind" and the beautiful "Danny's
Song."
Most of the material they
played so well is included on their
first album, "Sittin' In," which is
undoubtedly one of the album
finds of recent months. Bill
Graham put it well after their set
when he said, "We're going to be
hearing from these people for quite
awhile."
It was really enjoyable to hear
such fine sets by both a rising new

group and a seasoned veteran
performer, with a new band. And
realizing that Taj's disappointing
set was probably only a
temporary thing, I'd have to say it
was a fine musical evening indeed.

DELTA BLUES — Veteran blues
singer Taj Mahal appeared last
weekend at Winterland in a show
which also featured Dave Mason
and the Kenny Loggins Band with
Jim Messina.


—Daily Photos by Charles Lyle
POOH ON YOU — Kenny Loggins, who wrote the Nitty Gritty Dirt
Sand's "House At Pooh Corner," has formed a new band with former
Suffalo Springfield and Poco member Jim Messina and four other
musicians.
One of the greatest live
performances of a single song that
I have ever heard occurred last
January at Winterland when Dave
Mason and Carlos Santana
jammed with the new Traffic in a
truly remarkable 15 minute
version of the old Spencer Davis
song, "Gimme Some Lovin'." At
that time, I kind of wished that
Mason might rejoin the three
other members of the original
Traffic, who had amply
demonstrated that night why
Traffic was for so long considered
to be one of the English
supergroups.
But last weekend Mason
returned to Winterland and he
showed that two fine groups have
grown out of the original Traffic,
the new Traffic, which is
composed of Steve Winwood, Jim
Capaldi and Chris Wood from the
original group plus three
newcomers, and Mason's own new
band, formed last October.
Mason, who is now living in
San Francisco, is backed very
admirably by keyboard artist
Mark Jordan, (who used to play
with Van Morrison), drummer
Rick Jaeger, who has played with
Everly Brothers and A.B. Skhy;
bassist Lonnie Turner, who used
to play with Steve Miller; and
conga player Kwasi Dzidzornu,
who has played with Taj Mahal
and the Rolling Stones.

truly amazing set that had lasted
well over an hour. Having seen
both the new Traffic and now
Mason's new group, I can
undeniably say that they prove
very completely that the original
Traffic was made up of four
outstanding musicians.
Mason's set had been
immediately preceded by an
unfortunately weak set by one of
my favorite solo blues performers,
Taj Mahal. Taj seemed a bit tired
and he never got into his usual
fine form. Luckily Taj seemed to
realize he wasn't up to it and
performed a fairly short set. I can
forgive a bad night by Taj though,
since I've seen him have so many
good ones.
The night opened for me with
a very refreshing set by the Kenny
Loggins Band with Jim Messina,
since I arrived too late for the
show's short opening set by solo
pianist/vocalist Pamela Polland,
Kenny Loggins, best known for
having written the Nitty Gritty
Dirt Band hit "House At Pooh
Comer" and Messina, formerly
with Poco and the Buffalo
Springfield, have formed one of
the best new groups on the rock
scene.
Light Rock
Loggins and Messina do the
primary guitar and vocal work.
They are good on hom acoustic
and electric numbers and their
vocal harmony is very, very nice.
They are backed up quite
creditably by two sax players, a
bass player and a drummer. The
Loggins band is basically a light
rock group with a country twist
to many of their songs. But they
have a varied repertoire and are
equally talented on rockers like
"Back To Georgia" and "Listen
To A Country Song" and
mellower things like "Peace Of
Mind" and the beautiful "Danny's
Song."
Most of the material they
played so well is included on their
first album, "Sittin' In," which is
undoubtedly one of the album
finds of recent months. Bill
Graham put it well after their set
when he said, "We're going to be
hearing from these people for quite
awhile."
It was really enjoyable to hear
such fine sets by both a rising new

group and a seasoned veteran
performer, with a new band. And
realizing that Taj's disappointing
set was probably only a
temporary thing, I'd have to say it
was a fine musical evening indeed.

DELTA BLUES — Veteran blues
singer Taj Mahal appeared last
weekend at Winterland in a show
which also featured Dave Mason
and the Kenny Loggins Band with
Jim Messina.

POOH ON YOU — Kenny Loggins, who wrote the Nitty Gritty Dirt
Sand's "House At Pooh Corner," has formed a new band with former
Suffalo Springfield and Poco member Jim Messina and four other
musicians.
One of the greatest live
performances of a single song that
I have ever heard occurred last
January at Winterland when Dave
Mason and Carlos Santana
jammed with the new Traffic in a
truly remarkable 15 minute
version of the old Spencer Davis
song, "Gimme Some Lovin'." At
that time, I kind of wished that
Mason might rejoin the three
other members of the original
Traffic, who had amply
demonstrated that night why
Traffic was for so long considered
to be one of the English
supergroups.
But last weekend Mason
returned to Winterland and he
showed that two fine groups have
grown out of the original Traffic,
the new Traffic, which is
composed of Steve Winwood, Jim
Capaldi and Chris Wood from the
original group plus three
newcomers, and Mason's own new
band, formed last October.
Mason, who is now living in
San Francisco, is backed very
admirably by keyboard artist
Mark Jordan, (who used to play
with Van Morrison), drummer
Rick Jaeger, who has played with
Everly Brothers and A.B. Skhy;
bassist Lonnie Turner, who used
to play with Steve Miller; and
conga player Kwasi Dzidzornu,
who has played with Taj Mahal
and the Rolling Stones.
Guitar Virtuosity
Mason opened his set with two
cuts off of an early Traffic album,
"You Can All Join In," and
"Pearly Queen" and they sounded
remarkably like the album
versions I liked so much. Then
Dave showed some outstanding
guitar virtuosity on Bob Dylan's
"All Along The Watchtower." On
"Watchtower," both Jordan and
Jaeger had some very nice
passages.
The Pointer Sisters, who used
to perform often with Elvin
Bishop, joined Mason for about
half of his set and did their
usually great job of both singing
and dancing. Their vocal work was
clear and well-articulated and
never overshadowed Mason's lead
vocals.
Mason did almost every
number well, but he was
particularly impressive near the
ond of his set on two classics, the
Delaney and Bonnie hit, "Only
You Know And 1 Know"and
perhaps my favorite of all the
original Traffic songs, "Feelin'
Alright." After a large ovation,
Mason began his first encore by
performing a truly rocking

versionof Buddy Holly's "That'll
Be The Day"and then got into,
you guessed it, "Gimme Some
Lovin'."
Outstanding Musicians
The audience went wild at the
end of the first encore and Mason
finally calmed them down with a
slow second encore which ended a
truly amazing set that had lasted
well over an hour. Having seen
