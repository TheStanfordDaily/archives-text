# A 						Benefit That Reeked
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Except for a nearly flawless set
by Stoneground, last Sunday's
California Marijuana Initiative
benefit concert at Winterland
really reeked. And what was most
disappointing was that all of the
show's three other groups had
impressed me in earlier concerts.
In what was a good indicator
of what would happen almost all
night, the show got off to a rotten
start with a very poor set by
Copperhead. Copperhead is the
group centered arounc
Quicksilver's former keyboard
performer, John Cipollina, and in
a 8.8. King show a few months
ago, they had done some good
keyboard-dominated rock
numbers.
But except for one fine
instrumental, their set was pretty
bad. Almost all of their vocals
were similarly poor and each song
seemed to float into the next in a
sea of mediocrity. The fourth
group on a bill often isn't too hot,
but unfortunately things didn't
get much better when the night's
next group, Dan Hicks and His
Hot Licks came on stage.
The first few times I saw Dan
Hicks, his parody of many

different musical styles from
bygone years was quite enjoyable,
but after awhile, his technique
begins to seem a bit gimmicky and
the enjoyment of it wears thin.
On Sunday night, Hicks sounded
good on his classic piece of
nostalgia, "Soda Fountain Baby,"
but other than that, his set rivaled
Copperhead's as a very boring and
unexciting musical event.
Wavy Gravy
Following Hicks' set, some
freak named Wavy Gravy came on
stage and provided the most
enjoyable moments of the first
half of the concert. He gave an
incredibly strange rap about dope
and "natural highs" and then he
instructed everyone in the
audience to join hands, squat
down, exhale through their
mouths and inhale through their
noses 15 times, stand up and let
go with whatever sounds they felt
like emitting.
So after a lot of s-s-s-s-s-s-s-sing
and deep breaths, a couple of
thousand people with hands
linked together began to scream
and shout and ended up clapping
and stamping their feet in unison
forquite awhile. It was a lot more
exciting than most of the music
which had been played in the
more than iv/o hours preceding
Wavy Gravy's appearance.
Wavy Gravy's appearance was
followed by San Francisco Sheriff
Richard Hongsito who told how a
lot of alcoholics in his jail are a lot
worse off than most people, who,
as he put it, go "p-f-f-f-f-f-f-t."
After Hongisto left,
Stoneground,who had performed
so well at the Sheriff's pioneering
"Jailhouse Rock" benefit a few
weeks ago, came out and played a
nearly perfect set. This local group
of 10 people who live together
communally, is one of the best
new bands to come out of the Bay
ARea in recent years.
Toe-Tapping Tunes
Very simply, they play some
of the best toe-tapping,
foot-rocking, head-shaking,
gotta-get-up-and-move, kind of
music that I've heard in recent
months. They really got the
crowd rocking on most of their
numbers, but they also did some
fine slow blues and ballads.
As I said in my review of that
"Jailhouse Rock" concert, I am
terribly impressed with
Stoneground's ability to feature
different lead singers on different
songs in a way which enhances
their music instead of detracting
from it. Pardon my cliche, but
they are truly a "together" group.
After Stoneground's set, I was

quite uplifted and thinking about
how maybe the second half of the
show was going to be completely
different from the first half. But
then Hot Tuna, who sounded so
good back at Winterland in
December and who sold out
Carnegie Hall for a couple of
nights in a recent trip to New
York, played one of the most
disappointing sets I have heard in
recent months.
Hot Tuna has put out some
fine recorded material and based
on this and some of their earlier
live performances, I know they
are a very talented group. In Papa
John Creach, they have an
outstanding fiddle player and
guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and
bassist Jack Casady are capable of
playing some fine music.
But they jusi didn't have it on
Sunday night. Only on one or two
songs did they live up to their
potential. For most of their long
set, they failed to reach the level
I'd heard them perform at
previously. It was quite a downer.
Sorry Charlie, but overall the CMI
benefit was very, very
disappointing.

foot-rocking, head-shaking,
gotta-get-up-and-move, kind of
music that I've heard in recent
months. They really got the
crowd rocking on most of their
numbers, but they also did some
fine slow blues and ballads.
As I said in my review of that
"Jailhouse Rock" concert, I am
terribly impressed with
Stoneground's ability to feature
different lead singers on different
songs in a way which enhances
their music instead of detracting
from it. Pardon my cliche, but
they are truly a "together" group.
After Stoneground's set, I was

quite uplifted and thinking about
how maybe the second half of the
show was going to be completely
different from the first half. But
then Hot Tuna, who sounded so
good back at Winterland in
December and who sold out
Carnegie Hall for a couple of
nights in a recent trip to New
York, played one of the most
disappointing sets I have heard in
recent months.
Hot Tuna has put out some
fine recorded material and based
on this and some of their earlier
live performances, I know they
are a very talented group. In Papa
John Creach, they have an
outstanding fiddle player and
guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and
bassist Jack Casady are capable of
playing some fine music.
But they jusi didn't have it on
Sunday night. Only on one or two
songs did they live up to their
potential. For most of their long
set, they failed to reach the level
I'd heard them perform at
previously. It was quite a downer.
Sorry Charlie, but overall the CMI
benefit was very, very
disappointing.
Except for a nearly flawless set
by Stoneground, last Sunday's
California Marijuana Initiative
benefit concert at Winterland
really reeked. And what was most
disappointing was that all of the
show's three other groups had
impressed me in earlier concerts.
In what was a good indicator
of what would happen almost all
night, the show got off to a rotten
start with a very poor set by
Copperhead. Copperhead is the
group centered arounc
Quicksilver's former keyboard
performer, John Cipollina, and in
a 8.8. King show a few months
ago, they had done some good
keyboard-dominated rock
numbers.
But except for one fine
instrumental, their set was pretty
bad. Almost all of their vocals
were similarly poor and each song
seemed to float into the next in a
sea of mediocrity. The fourth
group on a bill often isn't too hot,
but unfortunately things didn't
get much better when the night's
next group, Dan Hicks and His
Hot Licks came on stage.
The first few times I saw Dan
Hicks, his parody of many

different musical styles from
bygone years was quite enjoyable,
but after awhile, his technique
begins to seem a bit gimmicky and
the enjoyment of it wears thin.
On Sunday night, Hicks sounded
good on his classic piece of
nostalgia, "Soda Fountain Baby,"
but other than that, his set rivaled
Copperhead's as a very boring and
unexciting musical event.
Wavy Gravy
Following Hicks' set, some
freak named Wavy Gravy came on
stage and provided the most
enjoyable moments of the first
half of the concert. He gave an
incredibly strange rap about dope
and "natural highs" and then he
instructed everyone in the
audience to join hands, squat
down, exhale through their
mouths and inhale through their
noses 15 times, stand up and let
go with whatever sounds they felt
like emitting.
So after a lot of s-s-s-s-s-s-s-sing
and deep breaths, a couple of
thousand people with hands
linked together began to scream
and shout and ended up clapping
and stamping their feet in unison
forquite awhile. It was a lot more
exciting than most of the music
which had been played in the
more than iv/o hours preceding
Wavy Gravy's appearance.
Wavy Gravy's appearance was
followed by San Francisco Sheriff
Richard Hongsito who told how a
lot of alcoholics in his jail are a lot
worse off than most people, who,
as he put it, go "p-f-f-f-f-f-f-t."
After Hongisto left,
Stoneground,who had performed
so well at the Sheriff's pioneering
"Jailhouse Rock" benefit a few
weeks ago, came out and played a
nearly perfect set. This local group
of 10 people who live together
communally, is one of the best
new bands to come out of the Bay
ARea in recent years.
Toe-Tapping Tunes
Very simply, they play some
of the best toe-tapping,
foot-rocking, head-shaking,
gotta-get-up-and-move, kind of
music that I've heard in recent
months. They really got the
crowd rocking on most of their
numbers, but they also did some
fine slow blues and ballads.
