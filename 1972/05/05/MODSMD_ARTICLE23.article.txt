## Thunderchickens 
### Charlie Hoffman 
January 1, 1973. 103,000 people in Pasadena's Rose Bowl and a
nationwide television audience brace themselves for the long awaited
rematch between the Michigan Wolverines and the Stanford
Thunderchickens.
Thunderchickens? The nation's worst fears about the quality of life
at Stanford after viewing the Incomparables perform during the
half-time at this year's Rose Bowl will undoubtedly be confirmed.
What is that crazy group of pseudo students going to do next? These
are the future leaders of America?
There are not many schools around who would have the audacity
to call themselves the Thunderchickens. If the new mascot suggestion
is approved, it will typify the irreverent approach to life that many see
as a trademark at Stanford.
If the mascot recommendation is approved by the Student Senate,
we are going to have to figure out what to do with it. We are going to
have to be prepared for the fact that most sportscasters, in the interest
of brevity, will refer to Stanford's proud athletic teams as the
"Chickens." Will our basketball players be able to emotionally deal
with announcers calling the play by play in the following manner:
"Mike Mann comes down with the rebound and the Chickens bring
the ball upcourt, but time is called as Head Chicken Howie Dallmar
indicates that he wants a conference with his players."
There could be other problems with the name Thunderchickens.
Roscoe Maples will be spinning in his grave when the fine pavilion
named after him is referred to as the Coop. The Dollies will
undoubtedly be displeased with the allusion to their build when they
are labelled the Thunderchickens. In future years, the
Thunderchickens might be discarded as discriminatory if the Women's
Liberation movement objects to Stanford women being called chicks.
The new mascot will open up a Pandora's box of catchy phrases for
journalists. Pity the poor Stanford team that loses horrendously and
has to face the headlines the next morning. "Chickens Lay An Egg,"
"Eggers Shelled," and other demeaning permutations of Stanford's
noble mascot, the Thunderchicken.
For their admirable audacity in adopting the Thunderchicken as
their symbol, students will have to develop great patience. If you
think that the students of the Southland at UCLA and USC had fun
with the Indian, wait until they get hold of the Thunderchicken. The
Bruins and Trojans will jump on the new mascot for proof of what
they have been claiming for years, that Stanford students are truly
eggheads.
Stanford athletes will have to bear the most pressure from
opposing fans, however. It will not be easy to stomach being called a
coward, a chicken shit as it were.
As has already been proved in this column, the press and Stanford's
opponents will quickly tire of what has to be a limited number of
chicken jokes and allusions. Thunderchicks on campus can take
comfort in this fact.
If Thunderchickens is approved, there will be many things for
which to be grateful. Certainly the Thunderchickens is far superior to
many other names that were under consideration. It might be
embarrassing to be known as the Stallions, Studs, or the Pinkoes. Can
you imagine the public image created by the Stanford Cockroaches?
There has got to be a serious side to this issue, however. DO
Stanford students want to be known as the Thunderchickens? Please
take some time to submit a letter to the sports department of the
Daily giving your reaction to the possibility of the Thunderchicken as
your new symbol. Suggestions as to potential applications of the
Thunderchicken symbol are also welcome. Chicken jokes are not
discouraged either.
However, contributions like the one from a cynic who suggested
that Prince Lightfoot be more feathers and a beak will not be
highly regarded.
