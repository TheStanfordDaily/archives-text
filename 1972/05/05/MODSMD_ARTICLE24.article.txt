# Red-White Scrimmage Tomorrow
## 
### STAN WILSON 
Tomorrow morning at 9:30
coaches and fans will get a final
look at Stanford football, when
the annual Red vs. White
scrimmage will be held at
Stanford Stadium.
Coach Jack Christiansen
labeled last week's effort "very
promising", with the offense
producing three touchdowns, all
on passing plays. Mike Boryla
connected with Scott Laidlaw and
Eric Cross for touchdowns of 43
and 66 yards, and transfer Dave
Ottmar hit Scott Boughton on an
11 yard toss to account for the
final score of the day.
Boryla was 13 for 18 on the
day, for 207 yards. Ottmar
completed 9 of 14 attempts, for
96 yards.Transfer Doug Jena had
6 receptions and speedster Eric

Cross, injured most of last year,
had three receptions for 82 yards.
For tomorrow's game, Mike
Boryla will lead the Red offense,
while Dave Ottmar will call the
signals for the Whites. Ottmar will
throw to split end Don Alvarado
and tight end Bill Scott, while
John Winesberry will handle the
ball as much as possible from his
halfback position.
Boryla will throw to split end
Miles Moore and running back
Doug Jena, and may use talented
placekicker Rod Garcia for some
of the scoring.
Coach Christiansen praised the
performances of linebacker
Gordon Riegel, and defensive
guards Joe Martin and Del
Lorimer. Lorimer and Martin will
play for the White team, along
with veteran defensive tackle

Pierre Perrault. Riegel will play on
the defensive unit of the Red
ream, as will backs Charles
McCloud and Dennis Bragonier.
One of Christiansen's primary
concerns is individual
development, particularly at key
defensive positions. He is also
concerned about the fumbles and
interceptions that plagued last
week's scrimmage, but gives the
improving defense much of the
credit for that aspect of the game.
To mo rro w's scri m mage wil 1
feature what many feel will be
one of the finest groups of
receivers in the nation next fall.
Boryla and Ottmar will be looking
for Eric Cross, Miles Moore, Don
Alvarado, John Winesberry, and
Bill Stone, all proven competitors.
An important question will be
how quickly Stanford's untested
offensive linemen have developed.

final score of the day.
Boryla was 13 for 18 on the
day, for 207 yards. Ottmar
completed 9 of 14 attempts, for
96 yards.Transfer Doug Jena had
6 receptions and speedster Eric

Cross, injured most of last year,
had three receptions for 82 yards.
For tomorrow's game, Mike
Boryla will lead the Red offense,
while Dave Ottmar will call the
signals for the Whites. Ottmar will
throw to split end Don Alvarado
and tight end Bill Scott, while
John Winesberry will handle the
ball as much as possible from his
halfback position.
Boryla will throw to split end
Miles Moore and running back
Doug Jena, and may use talented
placekicker Rod Garcia for some
of the scoring.
Coach Christiansen praised the
performances of linebacker
Gordon Riegel, and defensive
guards Joe Martin and Del
Lorimer. Lorimer and Martin will
play for the White team, along
with veteran defensive tackle

Pierre Perrault. Riegel will play on
the defensive unit of the Red
ream, as will backs Charles
McCloud and Dennis Bragonier.
One of Christiansen's primary
concerns is individual
development, particularly at key
defensive positions. He is also
concerned about the fumbles and
interceptions that plagued last
week's scrimmage, but gives the
improving defense much of the
credit for that aspect of the game.
To mo rro w's scri m mage wil 1
feature what many feel will be
one of the finest groups of
receivers in the nation next fall.
Boryla and Ottmar will be looking
for Eric Cross, Miles Moore, Don
Alvarado, John Winesberry, and
Bill Stone, all proven competitors.
An important question will be
how quickly Stanford's untested
offensive linemen have developed.
