# Spikers Face Cal In Final Dual Meet
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
The Stanford track team brings its dual meet season to a close this
Saturday against Cal starting at 1:15 in the Berkeley stadium. Both
teams are coming off of losses to USC and UCLA last month.
In the meet last year, Stanford upset a strong Cal team 76-69 in the
Stanford stadium. This year, Cal is once again the favorite. With a few
breaks in the right places, however, Stanford could pull another
reversal.
The seconds and thirds should decide this meet. Both teams have a
core of strong athletes and fairly good depth, but Berkeley is just a
little bit stronger. While Stanford should have a slight lead in the
running events, Cal's power lies in the field.
Ken Curl is the favorite in the 100 and 220. Bob Barmeyer and
Cal's Sammy Burns and Chuck Bommarito will be fighting for the
remaining two places in each event. John Anderson, who has been
running consistently at 47.8 all year, should take the 440. John Kessei
and Cal's Jim Andrew and Ed Bonner are all running in the mid-48's
this season, so it should be a tight battle for second and third.
Brown In 880
In his two years at Cal, Rick Brown has lost only one 880 in a dual
meet, and the odds are he will continue the practice this weekend.
Teammates Cliff West and Dennis Foster have both run faster than
Stanford's leader Dave Whiteing.
The mile should be a tight race between Berkeley's Cliff West and
Stanford's Brian Mittelstaedt and Les McFadden, all three of whom
run between 4:02 and 4:07. Arvid Kretz is the favorite in the two
mile with an 8:58.4 this year. Cal has four runners who run between
9:02 and 9:09.
Leading the 120 high hurdles is Dave Bagshaw at 14.3. Teammate
Tom Long and Cal's Ross Brosius have both broken 15 this year. In
the intermediates, it will be Mark Haight (53.7) and Tom Long (53.0)
facing Jim Petralia (52.3), Ross Brosius (53.0), and Bill Askey (54.1)
of Cal.
Relays
Cal has a slight edge in the 440 relay at 41.2 to Stanford's 41.4. In
the mile relay, however, Stanford has run 3:13.7 to Berkeley's 3:14.6.
The shot and discus should both be dominated by Cal's Jim
Penrose who has marks of 57'7" and 199'5" to his credit this year.
Rolin Luka (54'6'/2") should take second for Cal in the shot, with
teammate Chris Adams and Stanford's Ralph Bakkensen dueling for
third. In the discus, Adams has thrown 177'5" this year. Stanford's
trio of Jim Royer, Jim Howard, and Pete Dreissigacker will be facing
him and Penrose.
Bruce Kennedy should easily take the javelin for Cal. Teammate
Chris Adams will battle Rick Larson, Steve Hopkins, and Pete
Dreissigacker for the remaining two places.
Pole Vault
The pole vault should be a clean sweep for Cal's 16-footers, Mike
Weidig, Ed Otter, and Mike Bartel. In the high jump, Mai MacFarland
of Cal and Skip Grodahl of Stanford have both gone 6'10" this year.
Behind them are Tom Anderson for Stanford and Dave Fishbaugh and
Bruce McMonagle for Berkeley.
The triple jump will pit 50-footers Rod Utley and Craig Conway
against each other. Supporting Utley will be Mel Ho and Mike Hall.
Julian Lucas will also be competing for Cal. So far this year, Conway
has long jumped 24'5'/2". Tom Anderson is only an inch behind, so
this should be a close event. Lucas and Ho will be fighting for a place
here too, along with Stanford's Bill Raines.
Two weeks from today, on May 19, Stanford will host the Pac-8
championships. The meet will continue through the next day. Tickets
are available now at the Stanford Athletic Department box office.
