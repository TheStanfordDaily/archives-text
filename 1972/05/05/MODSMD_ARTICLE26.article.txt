# Bears Stun Cards In 27-27 Golf Tie
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford's golfers were stunned by Cal yesterday as the Bears and
the Cards tied 27-27 at Mira Vista Country Club.
Only Gary Vanier and Denny Colvin, who shot 72 and 74
respectively, played anywhere near their normal games in the 40
m.p.h. winds. In the freshman match, Stanford's frosh remained
undefeated with a 34-20 victory.
The varsity tie further complicates a pressing problem for 23 year
coach Bud Finger. Finger must choose six players out of seven
contenders to compete in the Pacific Eight tournament next weekend
at Los Angeles and then narrow the list to five for the NCAA
championships in Florida this June.
The seven contending players, all scoring within a shot or two of
each other, are seniors Gary Vanier and Tom Keelin, junior Denny
Colvin, and freshmen Dave Baskins, Conrad Nilmeier, Bruce
Robertson, and Aly Trompas. Here is a look at some of their
outstanding accomplishments so far this season. (Players listed in
alphabetical order.)
DAVE BASKINS: This fall Baskins wasn't even considered as a
varsity contender but he has developed into one of the Cards' most
consistent performers. After reaching the quarterfinals of the San
Francisco City championships, he tied for sixth in a strong 162 man
field in the Western Intercollegiates at Pasatiempo with rounds of
73-74-71. Baskins also tied for sixth in Stanford's U.S. Collegiate
Invitational with a 222 total. Relying on accurate driving and long
iron play, Baskins has scored between 70 and 76 in nearly all of his
competitive rounds.
Surprising Starter
DENNY COLVIN: Colvin is another surprising starter whose game
has really developed in the last few weeks. He made vital
contributions in preserving Stanford's 27-27 tie against San Jose State
and in Monday's 30-24 victory over the Spartans, shooting 72 in both
matches. Colvin also fired the lowest round by a Card golfer on the
Stanford course this year, a three under par 68 against Cal. In an
earlier match against USF he was two under par going into the last
hole before taking a triple bogey 7 for a 72.
CONRAD NILMEIER: Nilmeier started the season strong, finishing
second in the Fresno State Classic with a one under par score of 215.
He also reached the third round of the San Francisco City tournament
and has recorded several subpar rounds in dual match competition.
Nilmeier is now fully recovered from a hand injury which sidelined
him for more than a week and should continue his consistent play.
TOM KEELIN: The lanky Stanford captain has come up with
several outstanding tournament efforts. He tied teammate Bruce
Robertson for medalist honors in the San Francisco City toumey and
then played well in Stanford's first two intercollegiate events, the
Fresno State Classic and the Western Intercollegiates. He finished
sixth at Fresno with 220 and shot 216 to tie for fourth in the
Pasatiempo event. Keelin shot 70 in the first round of the U.S.
Collegiate Invitational before faltering in the final two rounds.
Tied for Medal
BRUCE ROBERTSON: Robertson played extremely well early in
the season, tying Keelin for the medal in the City tournament and
eventually losing to John Cranston in the finals. He shot a respectable
225 at Pasatiempo and tied for ninth in the U.S. Collegiate
Invitational last week. Monday he led the Cards to victory over San
Jose State with a one under par 69.
ALY TROMPAS: Trompas, the 1969 U.S. Junior champion, seems
to be breaking out of a long slump. He tied for ninth in the U.S.
Collegiate Invitational last week and showed signs of regaining his top
form. In January Trompas shot 74-72 to become low amateur in the
Glen Campbell-Los Angeles Open, a tournament that featured 150 of
the world's best golfers, including Arnold Palmer and Lee TRevino.
GARY VANIER: Vanier is Stanford's most intense competitor. He
came from six strokes down Monday to tie San Jose's Roger Maltbie
in a crucial match. Maltbie, who finished second in the Western
Intercollegiates, suffered a 73-77 defeat to Vanier in the first meeting
between the two teams. Vanier also tied fo> sixth in the U.S.
Collegiate Invitational and shot 224 and 225 at Fresno and
Pasatiempo despite a sudden case of the flue on the trip. He is
probably the only player assured of a spot at the NCAA tourney.

GARY VANIER: Vanier is Stanford's most intense competitor. He
came from six strokes down Monday to tie San Jose's Roger Maltbie
in a crucial match. Maltbie, who finished second in the Western
Intercollegiates, suffered a 73-77 defeat to Vanier in the first meeting
between the two teams. Vanier also tied fo> sixth in the U.S.
Collegiate Invitational and shot 224 and 225 at Fresno and
Pasatiempo despite a sudden case of the flue on the trip. He is
probably the only player assured of a spot at the NCAA tourney.

FANTASTIC FRESHMEN — Bruce Robertson is one of four freshmen
that have a chance to make the squad that represents Stanford at the
Pacific-Eight Championships and the NCAA Championships. The
others are Dave Baskins, Conrad Nilmeier, and Aly Trompas.
Stanford's golfers were stunned by Cal yesterday as the Bears and
the Cards tied 27-27 at Mira Vista Country Club.
Only Gary Vanier and Denny Colvin, who shot 72 and 74
respectively, played anywhere near their normal games in the 40
m.p.h. winds. In the freshman match, Stanford's frosh remained
undefeated with a 34-20 victory.
The varsity tie further complicates a pressing problem for 23 year
coach Bud Finger. Finger must choose six players out of seven
contenders to compete in the Pacific Eight tournament next weekend
at Los Angeles and then narrow the list to five for the NCAA
championships in Florida this June.
The seven contending players, all scoring within a shot or two of
each other, are seniors Gary Vanier and Tom Keelin, junior Denny
Colvin, and freshmen Dave Baskins, Conrad Nilmeier, Bruce
Robertson, and Aly Trompas. Here is a look at some of their
outstanding accomplishments so far this season. (Players listed in
alphabetical order.)
DAVE BASKINS: This fall Baskins wasn't even considered as a
varsity contender but he has developed into one of the Cards' most
consistent performers. After reaching the quarterfinals of the San
Francisco City championships, he tied for sixth in a strong 162 man
field in the Western Intercollegiates at Pasatiempo with rounds of
73-74-71. Baskins also tied for sixth in Stanford's U.S. Collegiate
Invitational with a 222 total. Relying on accurate driving and long
iron play, Baskins has scored between 70 and 76 in nearly all of his
competitive rounds.
Surprising Starter
DENNY COLVIN: Colvin is another surprising starter whose game
has really developed in the last few weeks. He made vital
contributions in preserving Stanford's 27-27 tie against San Jose State
and in Monday's 30-24 victory over the Spartans, shooting 72 in both
matches. Colvin also fired the lowest round by a Card golfer on the
Stanford course this year, a three under par 68 against Cal. In an
earlier match against USF he was two under par going into the last
hole before taking a triple bogey 7 for a 72.
CONRAD NILMEIER: Nilmeier started the season strong, finishing
second in the Fresno State Classic with a one under par score of 215.
He also reached the third round of the San Francisco City tournament
and has recorded several subpar rounds in dual match competition.
Nilmeier is now fully recovered from a hand injury which sidelined
him for more than a week and should continue his consistent play.
TOM KEELIN: The lanky Stanford captain has come up with
several outstanding tournament efforts. He tied teammate Bruce
Robertson for medalist honors in the San Francisco City toumey and
then played well in Stanford's first two intercollegiate events, the
Fresno State Classic and the Western Intercollegiates. He finished
sixth at Fresno with 220 and shot 216 to tie for fourth in the
Pasatiempo event. Keelin shot 70 in the first round of the U.S.
Collegiate Invitational before faltering in the final two rounds.
Tied for Medal
BRUCE ROBERTSON: Robertson played extremely well early in
the season, tying Keelin for the medal in the City tournament and
eventually losing to John Cranston in the finals. He shot a respectable
225 at Pasatiempo and tied for ninth in the U.S. Collegiate
Invitational last week. Monday he led the Cards to victory over San
Jose State with a one under par 69.
ALY TROMPAS: Trompas, the 1969 U.S. Junior champion, seems
to be breaking out of a long slump. He tied for ninth in the U.S.
Collegiate Invitational last week and showed signs of regaining his top
form. In January Trompas shot 74-72 to become low amateur in the
Glen Campbell-Los Angeles Open, a tournament that featured 150 of
the world's best golfers, including Arnold Palmer and Lee TRevino.
GARY VANIER: Vanier is Stanford's most intense competitor. He
came from six strokes down Monday to tie San Jose's Roger Maltbie
in a crucial match. Maltbie, who finished second in the Western
Intercollegiates, suffered a 73-77 defeat to Vanier in the first meeting
