# Batsmen Host SC
## Division Title At Stake 
### MIKE HERMAN 
Four weeks ago, the Stanford baseball team
travelled down to Los Angeles to confront the
perennial champions of the Pacific Eight
Conference, the University of Southern California.
Announced as the number one team in the nation
prior to the game, Stanford played up to their
ranking, defeating the Trojans two games to one.
The series put USC at a great disadvantage before
the season was only than a weekend old.
Today, USC visits the North to begin a three
game set with Stanford at the Sunken Diamond that
will determine the champion of the Southern
Division of the Pacific Eight. The positions of the
two teams, however, has been reversed. Since their
early showdown, the Trojans have won nine
consecutive games, while the Cardinals have
staggered through the last three weeks, winning five
contests in that period.
Thus, Stanford comes into the second-to-last
weekend with its back against the wall. If the
Cardinals sweep the series, they will pull into a tie
with the Trojans with a record of 10-5 and three
games to go. If the Cards only take the series, two
games to one, they will have to sweep the Cal series
next week, while hoping that UCLA can take two
from the Trojans on the same days. If Stanford loses
the series, they will have eliminated themselves from
post season action until next year. If, at the end of
the season, the two teams are tied, the winner of the
season series will represent the South against the
champions of the North, either Washington State
(10-2) or Oregon (9-3).
There is more of an urgency this year to see
Stanford finally rise to a league championship. This
is by far one of the best teams in Stanford history;
only three teams in the last 75 years of Stanford
baseball have won a better percentage of their
games. If the team fails to bring victory home this
year, it may be a long time before it does.
Many of the standouts on the team will be either
graduating or advancing into professional baseball.
Seniors Tom Williams (.455), Dave Edson (.271),
Tim Wilson (.200) and Tom Changnon (4-1) will be
concluding their Stanford careers at the end of this
season. Outstanding juniors such as Mike Nelson
(.351), Mickey Aguirre (.320), Rod Boone (8
homeruns, 30 runs batted in, .302), Glen Johnson
(.286), Bob Reece (.271) and Dan Shaw (7-2) have

all been rumored to be about to sign when the
season ends.
So, perhaps, it's now or never for the Cardinals.
The team appears t<~» be strong in every category,
but it has been so inconsistent that it may play
magnificently, as in the Trojan series, and then play
abominably, as they did two weeks ago against
California. After that series, Coach Ray Young,
commented bemusedly that "We play well against
USC, but we have a tendency to do poorly against
everyone else."
The team's batting has been incredibly strong
this year, with a composite batting mark of .305,
almost a full ten points above the club record. Four
of the starters have batting averages over .300, while
each of the starting eight has at least one homerun.
Boone and Williams together lead the team in every
important offensive category, Boone in at bats
(149) homeruns and runs batted in, Williams in runs
(29), hits (60) and batting average.
The pitching staff did not put on one of its best
performances during the past weekend. However,
every pitcher retains an earned run average of less
than three runs a game. Each holds a winning record
and the ratio of strikeouts to walks (an indication of
total pitching control) is better than two to one.
Shaw and Bob DiPietro each have seven victories,
while DiPietro has seventy strikeouts. Relief pitcher
Changnon has an ERA of less than one run a game.
Southern California also has a brilliant team.
With a batting average similar to that of the
Cardinals, SC has boasted, at different stages during
the season, as many as six starters above the .300
mark. Led by All-Conference leaders, rightfielder
Tim Steele, and third baseman Jeff Port, the Trojan
bats have not been quieted since the second game of
the Stanford series. The remainder of the starting
line up should be as follows: Sam Ceci, catcher,
Darrell Arenstein, first baseman, Milt Guggia,
second baseman, Roy Smalley, shortstop, Jeff
Pederson, left fielder, and Fred Lynn, centerfielder.
The Trojan pitching staff has also been
outstanding. The Cardinals will no doubt face All
Conference righthander Mark Sogge, as well as
Randy Scarberry (9-2) and Greg Widman (8-2). Tim
Coffin, who has USC's only victory over Stanford
this year, and Russ McQueen, an outstanding relief
pitcher will also see action.

while DiPietro has seventy strikeouts. Relief pitcher
Changnon has an ERA of less than one run a game.
Southern California also has a brilliant team.
With a batting average similar to that of the
Cardinals, SC has boasted, at different stages during
the season, as many as six starters above the .300
mark. Led by All-Conference leaders, rightfielder
Tim Steele, and third baseman Jeff Port, the Trojan
bats have not been quieted since the second game of
the Stanford series. The remainder of the starting
line up should be as follows: Sam Ceci, catcher,
Darrell Arenstein, first baseman, Milt Guggia,
second baseman, Roy Smalley, shortstop, Jeff
Pederson, left fielder, and Fred Lynn, centerfielder.
The Trojan pitching staff has also been
outstanding. The Cardinals will no doubt face All
Conference righthander Mark Sogge, as well as
Randy Scarberry (9-2) and Greg Widman (8-2). Tim
Coffin, who has USC's only victory over Stanford
this year, and Russ McQueen, an outstanding relief
pitcher will also see action.
Four weeks ago, the Stanford baseball team
travelled down to Los Angeles to confront the
perennial champions of the Pacific Eight
Conference, the University of Southern California.
Announced as the number one team in the nation
prior to the game, Stanford played up to their
ranking, defeating the Trojans two games to one.
The series put USC at a great disadvantage before
the season was only than a weekend old.
Today, USC visits the North to begin a three
game set with Stanford at the Sunken Diamond that
will determine the champion of the Southern
Division of the Pacific Eight. The positions of the
two teams, however, has been reversed. Since their
early showdown, the Trojans have won nine
consecutive games, while the Cardinals have
staggered through the last three weeks, winning five
contests in that period.
Thus, Stanford comes into the second-to-last
weekend with its back against the wall. If the
Cardinals sweep the series, they will pull into a tie
with the Trojans with a record of 10-5 and three
games to go. If the Cards only take the series, two
games to one, they will have to sweep the Cal series
next week, while hoping that UCLA can take two
from the Trojans on the same days. If Stanford loses
the series, they will have eliminated themselves from
post season action until next year. If, at the end of
the season, the two teams are tied, the winner of the
season series will represent the South against the
champions of the North, either Washington State
(10-2) or Oregon (9-3).
There is more of an urgency this year to see
Stanford finally rise to a league championship. This
is by far one of the best teams in Stanford history;
only three teams in the last 75 years of Stanford
baseball have won a better percentage of their
games. If the team fails to bring victory home this
year, it may be a long time before it does.
Many of the standouts on the team will be either
graduating or advancing into professional baseball.
Seniors Tom Williams (.455), Dave Edson (.271),
Tim Wilson (.200) and Tom Changnon (4-1) will be
concluding their Stanford careers at the end of this
season. Outstanding juniors such as Mike Nelson
(.351), Mickey Aguirre (.320), Rod Boone (8
homeruns, 30 runs batted in, .302), Glen Johnson
(.286), Bob Reece (.271) and Dan Shaw (7-2) have

all been rumored to be about to sign when the
season ends.
So, perhaps, it's now or never for the Cardinals.
The team appears t<~» be strong in every category,
but it has been so inconsistent that it may play
magnificently, as in the Trojan series, and then play
abominably, as they did two weeks ago against
California. After that series, Coach Ray Young,
commented bemusedly that "We play well against
USC, but we have a tendency to do poorly against
everyone else."
The team's batting has been incredibly strong
this year, with a composite batting mark of .305,
almost a full ten points above the club record. Four
of the starters have batting averages over .300, while
each of the starting eight has at least one homerun.
Boone and Williams together lead the team in every
important offensive category, Boone in at bats
(149) homeruns and runs batted in, Williams in runs
(29), hits (60) and batting average.
The pitching staff did not put on one of its best
performances during the past weekend. However,
every pitcher retains an earned run average of less
than three runs a game. Each holds a winning record
and the ratio of strikeouts to walks (an indication of
total pitching control) is better than two to one.
Shaw and Bob DiPietro each have seven victories,
while DiPietro has seventy strikeouts. Relief pitcher
Changnon has an ERA of less than one run a game.
