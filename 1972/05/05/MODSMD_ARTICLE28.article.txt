# A
						Big Weekend At Laguna Seca
## 
### ROGER ROADWAY 
A seven race program which
will climax in a L&M Grand Prix
Formula A-5000 race on Sunday,
opens today at Laguna Seca
Raceway in Monterey. The purse
for Sunday's Formula A-5000
title event will total $40,000, with
$15,000 going to the winner.
The two heat Formula A race
is the first in the Continental
Formula A-5000 Championship
Series which consists of nine
races. The main event will consist
of two 76 mile heats with the
overall winner determined by
combined points from the two
races.

Among the 50 entrants are
defending series champion David
Hobbs from England. Hobbs won
the Laguna Seca event last year
and this year he will be driving a
new Lola T-300.
Other international entrants
include New Zealand's Graham
Mcßae, who has won the Tasman
Series the last two years; Canada's
John Cannon, who will be driving
a brand new one-of-a-kind racing
car called the March 725; and
Australia's Frank Matich.
An added attraction on Sunday
will be an appearance by aerial
acrobat, Skip Volk. Volk will be

flying in his de Haviland
Chipmunk Airplane and his
routine is scheduled to include all
of the classical aerobatic
maneuvers, plus the lomcevak, the
end over end tumbling sequence
that was banned from
international aerobatic
competition because of the stress
it imposes on airplanes and pilots.
The two Formula A-5000
races to determine the 1972
Laguna Seca Continental
champion will be run at 1 and 3
p.m. on Sunday afternoon.
Tickets are priced at $1 for
Friday, $3 for Saturday and $6 on
Sunday.
