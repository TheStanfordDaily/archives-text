# Lettuce Boycott Underway Again
## 
### FRED MANN 
A boycott against California and
Arizona lettuce, initiated and then
delayed by the United Farm Workers
Union more than one year ago, has
begun again it was announced this
week.
Cesar Chavez, leader of the seven
year old embattled union, told a press
conference that negotiations with
growers over the establishment of
contracts with the United Farm
Workers had broken down, and that a
massive consumer boycott organizing
effort that could last up to three years
would begin immediately.
The boycott is against non-Farm
Workers lettuce. The Teamster Union
also has contracts with some lettuce
growers but the UFWOC claims
workers do not want to be represented
by the Teamsters.
At Stanford, United Farm Worker
lettuce is evidently now used exclu
sively in the dormitory food services
but Teamster lettuce is used at
Tresidder Memorial Union and the
Faculty Club.
University Stance
When the boycott originally began
in the fall of 1970, Chicano students
at Stanford negotiated with the
University, attempting to assure that
the food services, Tresidder Union, the
Faculty Club, and other food suppliers
would buy only UFWOC lettuce. The
University Administration vetoed the
plan, agreeing to buy "only lettuce
that comes from unionized fields,"
and refused to insist that the com
panies which supply the University's
food stuffs buy only Farm Workers
produce.
The Director of Tresidder and the
Faculty Club, Forrest Tregea, said that
both TMU and the Faculty Club did
their buying directly from the Univer
sity Commissary, and whatever they
sent, he used. 'The last time I
checked, we were using all approved
jUFWOC] lettuce," he said. "I will
look into the situation right away."
But Sterling Silver, manager of the
Commissary, countered Tregea, noting
that all the Faculty Club produce and
some of Tresidder's was purchased
independently, outside of the Commis
sary. "Most of the lettuce we buy
comes already processed—cleaned, cup

up and packaged in plastic bags," said
Silver. The processor is Royal Foods in
San Jose.
'Give What They Want'
When contacted yesterday, a
spokesman for Royal stated that the
company purchases both UFWOC and
Teamster lettuce at approximately the
same ratio, but added that all lettuce
sent to Stanford is that of UFWOC.
"Both types of lettuce cost us the
same," he said, "and we've been
through this hassle before. We handle
so many schools and restaurants, that
we must treat them honestly. We give
them whatever they want."
The Commissary buys approxi
mately 200 pounds of chopped lettuce
per day from Royal, as well as a small
number of cartons of head lettuce
weekly.
A check of packaging crates and
boxes from food services which buy
outside the Commissary indicates that
the majority of the lettuce served
there is Teamster lettuce. A worker in
the Faculty Club reports that it always
receives "Let-Us-Pak" brand, and the
Coffeehouse stocks "Boss" and "Mer
rill" brands, all Teamster contracted.
Dormitory food service lettuce is
marked only with the Royal Foods
name.

Local supermarkets appear to vary
as far as the type of lettuce they carry.
Co-op stores claim to carry 100
percent UFWOC lettuce, while Safe
way and Lucky stores state they buy
some UFWOC and some Teamster.
United Farm Worker spokesmen dis
pute the Safeway claim, stating that
any UFWOC lettuce crates that appear
in Safeway stores are "tokens," there
"only for show."
Delay in beginning the boycott was
related to the Union's battles with
the National Labor Relations Board,
which has outlawed all such boycotts
by unions under its jurisdiction. By
law, farm workers are excluded from
NLRB control, but because of the
union's boycott of nine California
wineries in a separate issue, the board
initiated a federal suit to bring the
union under their control.
An accord reached this week settled
the NLRB issue out of court. Accord
ing to one grower spokesman, the
Farm Workers agreed to give up
representation of winery workers in
order to go ahead with the lettuce
boycott. A member of the United
Farm Workers Organizing Committee
(UFWOC) disagreed however, saying
that the union had not actively
represented any winery workers for

more than a year.
The Farm Workers efforts to
organize lettuce workers did not
substantially move forward until after
the completion of the union's large
scale California grape boycott in July
of 1970. At that time, UFWOC
petitioned lettuce growers for secret
ballot union representation elections.
'Sweetheart' Contracts
The growers instead turned to the
Teamsters Union, and, according to
the Farm Workers, signed "sweet
heart" contracts without consulting
the workers. The Teamster contracts
improved the lettuce workers lot by
offering four unpaid holidays, a
limited health plan, and "reasonable
steps" to be taken by growers to
insure proper health and safety stan
dards.
UFWOC complained however, that
lettuce workers did not want to be
represented by the Teamsters because
the union had no interest in the
welfare of the workers. Teamster
contracts, they point out, make no
mention of rest periods, vacations, or
protection from pesticides, whereas
the United Farm Workers' contracts
(which have been agreed to by some of
the large lettuce growers in California)
provide for comprehensive work,

health, safety, and life insurance plans.
One month after approximately
6,000 workers went on strike in
August, 1970, to protest the grower-
Teamster contracts, the walk-out was
ruled illegal, and, in December, leader
Chavez was jailed. Following his
release 19 days later, jurisdictional
problems with the NLRB developed.
Currently more than 15 percent of
the lettuce grown in California and
Arizona is under United Farm Worker
contract.
More than 200 lettuce growers
currently hold contracts with the
Teamsters.

up and packaged in plastic bags," said
Silver. The processor is Royal Foods in
San Jose.
'Give What They Want'
When contacted yesterday, a
spokesman for Royal stated that the
company purchases both UFWOC and
Teamster lettuce at approximately the
same ratio, but added that all lettuce
sent to Stanford is that of UFWOC.
"Both types of lettuce cost us the
same," he said, "and we've been
through this hassle before. We handle
so many schools and restaurants, that
we must treat them honestly. We give
them whatever they want."
The Commissary buys approxi
mately 200 pounds of chopped lettuce
per day from Royal, as well as a small
number of cartons of head lettuce
weekly.
A check of packaging crates and
boxes from food services which buy
outside the Commissary indicates that
the majority of the lettuce served
there is Teamster lettuce. A worker in
the Faculty Club reports that it always
receives "Let-Us-Pak" brand, and the
Coffeehouse stocks "Boss" and "Mer
rill" brands, all Teamster contracted.
Dormitory food service lettuce is
marked only with the Royal Foods
name.

Local supermarkets appear to vary
as far as the type of lettuce they carry.
Co-op stores claim to carry 100
percent UFWOC lettuce, while Safe
way and Lucky stores state they buy
some UFWOC and some Teamster.
United Farm Worker spokesmen dis
pute the Safeway claim, stating that
any UFWOC lettuce crates that appear
in Safeway stores are "tokens," there
"only for show."
Delay in beginning the boycott was
related to the Union's battles with
the National Labor Relations Board,
which has outlawed all such boycotts
by unions under its jurisdiction. By
law, farm workers are excluded from
NLRB control, but because of the
union's boycott of nine California
wineries in a separate issue, the board
initiated a federal suit to bring the
union under their control.
An accord reached this week settled
the NLRB issue out of court. Accord
ing to one grower spokesman, the
Farm Workers agreed to give up
representation of winery workers in
order to go ahead with the lettuce
boycott. A member of the United
Farm Workers Organizing Committee
(UFWOC) disagreed however, saying
that the union had not actively
represented any winery workers for

more than a year.
The Farm Workers efforts to
organize lettuce workers did not
substantially move forward until after
the completion of the union's large
scale California grape boycott in July
of 1970. At that time, UFWOC
petitioned lettuce growers for secret
ballot union representation elections.
'Sweetheart' Contracts
The growers instead turned to the
Teamsters Union, and, according to
the Farm Workers, signed "sweet
heart" contracts without consulting
the workers. The Teamster contracts
improved the lettuce workers lot by
offering four unpaid holidays, a
limited health plan, and "reasonable
steps" to be taken by growers to
insure proper health and safety stan
dards.
UFWOC complained however, that
lettuce workers did not want to be
represented by the Teamsters because
the union had no interest in the
welfare of the workers. Teamster
contracts, they point out, make no
mention of rest periods, vacations, or
protection from pesticides, whereas
the United Farm Workers' contracts
(which have been agreed to by some of
the large lettuce growers in California)
provide for comprehensive work,

health, safety, and life insurance plans.
One month after approximately
6,000 workers went on strike in
August, 1970, to protest the grower-
Teamster contracts, the walk-out was
ruled illegal, and, in December, leader
Chavez was jailed. Following his
release 19 days later, jurisdictional
problems with the NLRB developed.
Currently more than 15 percent of
the lettuce grown in California and
Arizona is under United Farm Worker
contract.
More than 200 lettuce growers
currently hold contracts with the
Teamsters.
A boycott against California and
Arizona lettuce, initiated and then
delayed by the United Farm Workers
Union more than one year ago, has
begun again it was announced this
week.
Cesar Chavez, leader of the seven
year old embattled union, told a press
conference that negotiations with
growers over the establishment of
contracts with the United Farm
Workers had broken down, and that a
massive consumer boycott organizing
effort that could last up to three years
would begin immediately.
The boycott is against non-Farm
Workers lettuce. The Teamster Union
also has contracts with some lettuce
growers but the UFWOC claims
workers do not want to be represented
by the Teamsters.
At Stanford, United Farm Worker
lettuce is evidently now used exclu
sively in the dormitory food services
but Teamster lettuce is used at
Tresidder Memorial Union and the
Faculty Club.
University Stance
When the boycott originally began
in the fall of 1970, Chicano students
at Stanford negotiated with the
University, attempting to assure that
the food services, Tresidder Union, the
Faculty Club, and other food suppliers
would buy only UFWOC lettuce. The
University Administration vetoed the
plan, agreeing to buy "only lettuce
that comes from unionized fields,"
and refused to insist that the com
panies which supply the University's
food stuffs buy only Farm Workers
produce.
The Director of Tresidder and the
Faculty Club, Forrest Tregea, said that
both TMU and the Faculty Club did
their buying directly from the Univer
sity Commissary, and whatever they
sent, he used. 'The last time I
checked, we were using all approved
jUFWOC] lettuce," he said. "I will
look into the situation right away."
But Sterling Silver, manager of the
Commissary, countered Tregea, noting
that all the Faculty Club produce and
some of Tresidder's was purchased
independently, outside of the Commis
sary. "Most of the lettuce we buy
comes already processed—cleaned, cup

up and packaged in plastic bags," said
Silver. The processor is Royal Foods in

the NLRB issue out of court. Accord
ing to one grower spokesman, the
Farm Workers agreed to give up
representation of winery workers in
order to go ahead with the lettuce
boycott. A member of the United
Farm Workers Organizing Committee
(UFWOC) disagreed however, saying
that the union had not actively
represented any winery workers for

more than a year.
The Farm Workers efforts to
organize lettuce workers did not
substantially move forward until after
the completion of the union's large
scale California grape boycott in July
of 1970. At that time, UFWOC
petitioned lettuce growers for secret
ballot union representation elections.
'Sweetheart' Contracts
The growers instead turned to the
Teamsters Union, and, according to
the Farm Workers, signed "sweet
heart" contracts without consulting
the workers. The Teamster contracts
improved the lettuce workers lot by
offering four unpaid holidays, a
limited health plan, and "reasonable
steps" to be taken by growers to
insure proper health and safety stan
dards.
UFWOC complained however, that
lettuce workers did not want to be
represented by the Teamsters because
the union had no interest in the
welfare of the workers. Teamster
contracts, they point out, make no
mention of rest periods, vacations, or
protection from pesticides, whereas
the United Farm Workers' contracts
(which have been agreed to by some of
the large lettuce growers in California)
provide for comprehensive work,

health, safety, and life insurance plans.
One month after approximately
6,000 workers went on strike in
August, 1970, to protest the grower-
Teamster contracts, the walk-out was
ruled illegal, and, in December, leader
Chavez was jailed. Following his
release 19 days later, jurisdictional
problems with the NLRB developed.
Currently more than 15 percent of
the lettuce grown in California and
Arizona is under United Farm Worker
contract.
More than 200 lettuce growers
currently hold contracts with the
Teamsters.
A boycott against California and
Arizona lettuce, initiated and then
delayed by the United Farm Workers
Union more than one year ago, has
begun again it was announced this
week.
Cesar Chavez, leader of the seven
year old embattled union, told a press
conference that negotiations with
growers over the establishment of
contracts with the United Farm
Workers had broken down, and that a
massive consumer boycott organizing
effort that could last up to three years
would begin immediately.
The boycott is against non-Farm
Workers lettuce. The Teamster Union
also has contracts with some lettuce
growers but the UFWOC claims
workers do not want to be represented
by the Teamsters.
At Stanford, United Farm Worker
lettuce is evidently now used exclu
sively in the dormitory food services
but Teamster lettuce is used at
Tresidder Memorial Union and the
Faculty Club.
University Stance
When the boycott originally began
in the fall of 1970, Chicano students
at Stanford negotiated with the
University, attempting to assure that
the food services, Tresidder Union, the
Faculty Club, and other food suppliers
would buy only UFWOC lettuce. The
University Administration vetoed the
plan, agreeing to buy "only lettuce
that comes from unionized fields,"
and refused to insist that the com
panies which supply the University's
food stuffs buy only Farm Workers
produce.
The Director of Tresidder and the
Faculty Club, Forrest Tregea, said that
both TMU and the Faculty Club did
their buying directly from the Univer
sity Commissary, and whatever they
sent, he used. 'The last time I
checked, we were using all approved
jUFWOC] lettuce," he said. "I will
look into the situation right away."
But Sterling Silver, manager of the
Commissary, countered Tregea, noting
that all the Faculty Club produce and
some of Tresidder's was purchased
independently, outside of the Commis
sary. "Most of the lettuce we buy
comes already processed—cleaned, cup

up and packaged in plastic bags," said
Silver. The processor is Royal Foods in
San Jose.
'Give What They Want'
When contacted yesterday, a
spokesman for Royal stated that the
company purchases both UFWOC and
Teamster lettuce at approximately the
same ratio, but added that all lettuce
sent to Stanford is that of UFWOC.
"Both types of lettuce cost us the
same," he said, "and we've been
through this hassle before. We handle
so many schools and restaurants, that
we must treat them honestly. We give
them whatever they want."
The Commissary buys approxi
mately 200 pounds of chopped lettuce
per day from Royal, as well as a small
number of cartons of head lettuce
weekly.
A check of packaging crates and
boxes from food services which buy
outside the Commissary indicates that
the majority of the lettuce served
there is Teamster lettuce. A worker in
the Faculty Club reports that it always
receives "Let-Us-Pak" brand, and the
Coffeehouse stocks "Boss" and "Mer
rill" brands, all Teamster contracted.
Dormitory food service lettuce is
marked only with the Royal Foods
name.

Local supermarkets appear to vary
as far as the type of lettuce they carry.
Co-op stores claim to carry 100
percent UFWOC lettuce, while Safe
way and Lucky stores state they buy
some UFWOC and some Teamster.
United Farm Worker spokesmen dis
pute the Safeway claim, stating that
any UFWOC lettuce crates that appear
in Safeway stores are "tokens," there
"only for show."
Delay in beginning the boycott was
related to the Union's battles with
the National Labor Relations Board,
which has outlawed all such boycotts
by unions under its jurisdiction. By
law, farm workers are excluded from
NLRB control, but because of the
union's boycott of nine California
wineries in a separate issue, the board
initiated a federal suit to bring the
union under their control.
An accord reached this week settled
the NLRB issue out of court. Accord
ing to one grower spokesman, the
Farm Workers agreed to give up
representation of winery workers in
order to go ahead with the lettuce
boycott. A member of the United
Farm Workers Organizing Committee
