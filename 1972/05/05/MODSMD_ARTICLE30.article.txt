Wallace Wing
NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Alabama Gov.
George C. Wallace won his first
primary' victory outside the Deep
South yesterday with a runaway 3-1
margin over 10 Democratic rivals in
Tennessee's first presidential primary.
An antibusing amendment which
helped Wallace's voter turnout carried
by an even heavier edge, taking some
80 percent of the vote despite some
confusion at the polls over the
wording of the referendum.
President Nixon handily won the
Republican primary in which there
was heavy crossover voting by the
Tennessee GOP in the Democratic
election, which swelled Wallace's ad
vantage.
The Tennessee victory gave Wallace
at least 44 of the state's 49 Demo
cratic National Convention votes. He
appeared to be winning the rest.
The delegate commitments put
Wallace in third place among the
Democratic contenders with a total of
157. Sen. George McGovern of South
Dakota remains the leader in delegates
nationally with 265 1 /2, won in 19
states. Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of
Minnesota has 188. Sen. Edmund S.
Muskie, who has withdrawn from
primary campaigning, has 128'/2.
Schizo Cause Found?
DALLAS — A research team said
yesterday it has discovered the proba
ble biological cause of schizophrenia,
the personality-splitting disorder that
remains one of the most severe,
difficult to treat mental illnesses
known.
Drs. Jacques S. Gottlieb, a psychia

trist, and Charles E. Forhman, a
biochemist, said their group at the
Lafayette Clinic and Wayne State
University in Detroit has discovered
that an enzyme deficiency in the
brains of schizophrenic patients ap
pears to upset the brains's metabolism.
It leads to abnormal production of
chemicals that are known to have a
mentally disturbing effect.
The Wayne State group found that
an enzyme, which they named Anti-S
Protein, appears to work in the limbic
and lower stem portion of the brain.
The enzyme causes a chemical called
tryptophan to flood certain areas of
the brain, producing excessive
amounts of other chemicals called
methylated idoleamines.
These substances, some of which
have Deen isolated from plants, are
known to have a mind-altering effect.
Because of the enzyme shortage,

"an excessive production of methy
lated idoleamines becomes possible
and, therefore, probably responsible
for the symptoms of the disorder
schizophrenia," Gottlieb and Frohman
said in their paper.
