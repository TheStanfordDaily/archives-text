# Marijuana Petitions Filed
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
Backers of the California Marijuana
Ballot Initiative, which would abolish
all criminal penalties for personal use
of marijuana, reported filing 325,000
signatures with the Secretary of State
as of May 1.
The campaign organization now has
the goal of filing an additional
300,000 signatures by June 10.
To qualify for placement on the
November ballot the initiative will
require 326,504 valid signatures. Rob
ert Ashford, state coordinator, says a
total of 600,000 filed signatures will
safeguard against up to 45 percent
being ruled invalid. Petition campaign
experience requires calculating a loss
of about 33 percent in invalid
signatures, he explained.
State pe f itioning restrictions re
quire that the petition circulator and
signer both be registered voters in the
county for which they are either
circulating or signing that petition. No
one may sign more than once. Public
Affairs Coordinator of the CMI Eileen
Janowitz said, "some people were so
anxious they signed a half a dozen
times."
County registrars check the petition
signatures against those on the affida
vits of registration. Those signatures
which cannot be corroborated are
discarded as invalid.

George Mann, Santa Clara County
registrar of voters, reported that
16,963 signatures were filed in Santa
Clara County by May 1. He said,
"About 70 per cent are usually valid."
There can be a problem with Stanford
signers because they are sometimes not
registered voters of Santa Clara Coun
ty, he said. "Up around Stanford there

are a lot of people coming across the
line," he explained.
The CMI has gained a lot of
strength in the past seven weeks,
Ashford said. Since March 13, the
number of signatures has zoomed from
50,000 to over 300,000. Coordinators
have been established in all 58
California counties.
Janowitz claimed that supporters of

the initiative represent "a good cross
section." She said, "An awful lot of
old people and really straight people
have signed."
The San Francisco Bar Association
reported overwhelming support for the
initiative in a member plebiscite. The
vote was 1,113 in favor and 502
against.
