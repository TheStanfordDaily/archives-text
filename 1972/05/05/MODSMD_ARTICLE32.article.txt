# Minorities Resubmit Law School Demands
## 
### 
The black, Chicano and Native
American Law Students Associations
have resubmitted their demand for a
quota of 50 minority students in the
next entering class of 160, and have
asked for a "study of the correlation
between pre-law school academic re
cords and law performance" to be
conducted by an outside consultant.
The law students say they are
waiting for an answer to their renewed
demands for the admission of 20
black, 20 Chicano, and 10 American
Indian students into next year's law
class. Law School Dean Thomas
Ehrlich is expected to respond.
On Monday afternoon, the law
school faculty rejected the demand for
a 50-person minority quota, instead
affirming current admissions stan
dards, which they agreed "should be
interpreted flexibly by the Admissions
Committee... to permit admission
this year of minority applicants whose
academic records, when viewed as a
whole, are substantially equivalent to
those of minority applicants already
admitted."

This year's entering class includes
19 minority students, while eight
minority students entered the law
school the previous year.
The minority students' associations
criticized an "elitist attitude" in law
school admissions, which they main
tain has undercut the value of past
admissions efforts.
"Although admission standards
have been relaxed, the Law School will
admit only those minority students
meeting standards which are among the
highest for minority students in the
nation," the associations declared in a
joint statement.
"No request is being made that the
law school lower its admissions criteria
to the point of admitting persons
unable to withstand the competitive
ness of law school," they said.
The associations' statement ob
served that 1.3 percent of the nation's
lawyers are black, and that the legal
profession now contains one Chicano
lawyer per 9,800 Chicanos, and one
Native American lawyer per 25,000
Native Americans.
