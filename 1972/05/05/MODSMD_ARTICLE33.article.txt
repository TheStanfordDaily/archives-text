# A 						Discussion of the Denial of Approval for Dr. Shockley's Proposed Graduate Special Course on "The Dysgenic Question: New Research Methodology on Human Behavior, Genetics and Racial Differences"
## 
### 
The following summary is based on materials
prepared by Professor Shockley. Supplementary mate
rials are available on request from his office.
The documents made public by Graduate Dean
Linconln Moses in connection with the rejection of Dr.
Shockley's proposed Graduate Special course entitled
"The Dysgenic Question: New Research Methodology
on Human Behavior Genetics and Racial Differences"
were reprinted in the May 2 issue of The Stanford Daily.
Dr. Shockley states: "The most heart warming line
that 1 found in the committee reports was the majority
opinion that 'It is difficult to believe that. . .Stanford
graduate students could be significantly poisoned by
error on the part of professor. . .' I concur with this
view.
"It is also clear that the committee hopes that ex
posure to the students might even correct my own
errors. On balance, I would be pleased if my worries
could be proven unfounded. My scientific chagrin at
being found wrong would be more than balanced by a
feeling of relief.
"However, the key issue is truth. In my opinion, the
reports clearly reflect a preconception of the results that
would come from the type of research that my Graduate
Special course was intended to propose, to develop and
the encourage."
Particularly relevant to the considerations of the com
mittee should have been two particular topics planned
for the proposed course Dr. Shockley had selected these
two topics for a debate with three Stanford professors
who had criticized his position in statements published
in The Stanford Daily during February. [No response
from the challenged professors has reached Dr.
Shockley.]
One item concerned Dr. Shockley's analysis of hybrid'
variance for American Negro populations (i.e., the varia
tion between individuals of amount of "white blood")
that he had outlined briefly in an abstract and presented
in more detail verbally at a meeting of the National
Academy of Sciences at the annual meeting in April,
1971.
Dr. Shockley's research relating hybrid variance to
the Hardy-Weinbcrg Law of genetics is involved in an
exchange of correspondence between Dr. Shockley and
Dean Moses, starting Feb. 27, 1972. This exchange was
provoked by an interview with Dr. Leroy Aarons of The
Washington Post.
Dr. Shockley emphasized in this letter that a specific
attack originating from the Stanford genetics faculty

upon his theory of hybrid variance relied upon a paper
by Dr. T.E. Reed, a leading researcher on the "Caucasian
gene" in American Negro populations.
Dr. Reed's paper attacked Dr. Shockley's proposed
refinement of the Hardy-Weinberg law of genetics and
his application of this refinement to Dr. Reed's data. Dr.
Shockley's letter asserted that "to put it bluntly, Dr.
Reed has missed the point. . .."
This comment resulted in a telephone inquiry from
Dr. Bradley Efron of Dean Moses' committee. After
hearing Dr. Shockley explain the relevant features, Dr.
Efron concurred that the Reed paper "missed the
point."
Dr. Shockley states: "In my opinion, I convinced Dr.
Efron that I was well out in front of the Stanford
genetics and biology faculty on this key feature of
human population genetics, listed under Heading (3) in
my proposed study. Yet I find no recognition of this in
any of the appraisals of Dean Moses' committee."
No other responses have come to Dr. Shockley from
the committee members to his offers to meet and discuss
the course content and pedagogical methods. "These
facts do not relieve me of the 'star chamber' impression
that I transmitted to Dean Moses in my letter of Feb.
27," Dr. Shockley stated.
Another important item in the debate challenge had
to do with the "level of significance" at which it could
be asserted that genes dominate intelligence for indivi
duals like those from families that raise white identical
twins. This subject, although not involved in racial
issues, also appears to be so emotionally loaded that an
objective consideration of it cannot be carried out.
Since 1966, Dr. Shockley has maintained that the
National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has a responsibil
ity inherent in the charter granted to it by Abraham
Lincoln to evaluate and express quantitative facts on the
behavioral traits of the human species. This proposed
resolution conce:ns a cornerstone statement relevant to
these biological facts.
A version of *'his statement was proposed by Dr.
Shockley in a paper read before the NAS in October
1966. It was subsequently transmitted in inquiries made
to the Academy by two representatives in Congress in
1969. The responses did not give a definitive evaluation.
It was an item discussed obliquely in the Davis Com
mittee Report approved at the annual meeting of the
Academy in 1971. At that meeting, in an evaluation of
the Davis Report, Dr. Shockley requested permission to
•show a lantern slide on which he based his estimate of

significance level at 1 part in 2000 as discussed in the
resolution below. This permission was not granted.
At the fall meeting of the Academy in 1971, Dr.
Shockley presented the reasoning in a contributed paper.
At the business meeting he proposed a similar resolution
that was tabled. Dr. Shockley's position in regard to the
Academy's position on these matters has been published
in the Congressional Record of Dec. 20, 1969, as fol
lows: "I regard the Academy's position as being the
most serious and obvious dereliction of intellectual
responsibility in the history of science."
At the annual meeting of the NAS on April 26, 1972,
Dr. Shockley introduced the following resolution that he
stressed does not bear on the emotionally loaded racial
issues involved in such questions as "busing."
WHEREAS, estimates of the level of significance by
Academy member Shockley [See Proc., N.A.S., 68,
2899 a (1971), Phi Delta Kappan, Jan. 71, pp. 297-3 1 2;
and Phi Delta Kappan, Mar 72, pp. 415-419.] lead to the
conclusion that, if environmental influences on 1Q
variance were as large as 30%, then there is only one
chance in 2000 that the tabulation by A. R. Jensen of
the IQs for 244 separately reared white identical twins,
compiled from four independent studies from England,
Denmark, and the United States, would have been
deceptive by pure chance effects so as to mislead errone
ously to an observed value of geneticity of more than
80% leaving less than 15% for environmental effects and
WHEREiAS, the report of the Ad Hoc Committee on
Genetic Factors in Human Performance |Proc., N.A.S.,
69, (1972)1 states that all that can he said is that with
respect to some human quality problems genetic factors
are highly important while with respect to others, they
are unimportant and thus does not suggest that the
important behavioral trait of IQ is ever dominated by
genes; therefore,
IT IS RESOLVED that the Council (of the National
Academy of Sciencesl be requested to arrange for a
review of the significance level calculations and to issue
an appropriate statement to resolve the related environ
ment-heredity uncertainty.
This resolution, unlike similar prior resolutions of Dr.
Shockley, was not tabled but was seconded, discussed,
and defeated by a vote of 44 to 24, with approximately
half of the members present not voting. Dr. Shockley
evaluated this as progress in the willingness of the Acade
my to deal with this question.
An important related item is a poll of the psychology
community carried out by one of the students in Dr.
Shockley's office. It found that none of six upper class
men in psychology at Stanford concurred in Dr.
Shockley's statistical conclusion.
This topic of the level of significance far dominance

Space paid for by News and Publications Service
of IQ by genes compared to environment and a simple
interpretation of its can be communicated without the
elaborate machinery of the mathematical analysis of
variance. This subject matter was covered by Heading (1)
in Dr. Shockley's proposed outline of the Graduate
Special Course in The Stanford Daily May 2. (Dr. Colin
Pittendrigh's comments concerning Dr. Shockley's refer
ences in the outline were restricted to the list of readings
and failed to note specific reference to Volume V, The
Gifted Group at Mid-Life in the famous Lewis Terman
Series on genetic studies of genius, Dr. Shockley noted.)
To summarize: The Graduate Study review does not
appraise two substantive issues that are key items in Dr.
Shockley's proposed course. Here are the two chief
questions left unanswered in the review:
(1) Can the hybrid variance (i.e., variation from indi
vidual to individual in degree of Caucasian ancestry) for
American Negro populations be estimated soundly by
Dr. Shockley's generalization of the Hardy-Weinberg
Law of population genetics?
(2) Is the 1 chance in 2000 level of significance for
dominance of IQ by genes warranted or not for indivi
duals like white identical twins?
Dr. Shockley said. "It would be futile to attempt to
correct every erroneous misrepresentation of my posi
tion that appears in the report. Two that should be
corrected, however, are these: I have assiduously, and I
believe consistently, attempted to avoid treating my
'conclusions as if they were solid enough to warrant
their acceptance for purposes of making public policy.'
"I have stated that action positions should await
agreement on exactly such facts as my proposed course
would seek out. Otherwise, I have proposed hypothetical
actions as thinking exercises. I have not excluded 'popu
lation pollution' as a threat for Caucasians nor have I
focusscd 'population pollution' on miscegenation.
"I do not sense in the complicated systems of criteria
used by the committee the influence of intensive soul
searching like that 1 have undergone since becoming
concerned with the environment-heredity uncertainty
seven years ago. I have searched for and found a philo
sophical basis for the type of research that I urge.
"This basis was published first as a letter in Presbyte
rian Life and later in The Stanford Daily, in both cases
under the title 'Three Moral Postulates: Truth-Concern-
Death.' I hope that those sensitive to the moral issues
involved will consider how these moral postulates read
on the positions taken in denying approval of my
proposed course hv Hp— v •- his committee."
