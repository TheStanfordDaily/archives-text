# Witnesses Identify Angela
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
SAN JOSE — Jonathon Jackson and a
tall, slender black woman were seen at
the Marin County courthouse the day
before the shootout there, according
to four crucial prosecution witnesses
in the Angela Davis trial.
Three of yesterday's witnesses iden
tified the woman as Angela Davis. The
fourth was never asked to name
Jackson's companion, and the defense
tried to chip away at the certainty of
the other identifications.
All four witnesses were at a gas
station when Jackson and a woman
came in August 6, 1970 to ask for help
in starting a vehicle stalled next door
at the Marin Civic Center. One of the
witnesses helped the two "jump-start"
a bright yellow Hertz van, a descrip
tion exactly matching the truck which
Jackson allegedly used in the escape
effort the next day.
Jackson and three others were
killed in the Marin incident, which the

prosecution says was planned by Davis
in an effort to trade hostages for
Jackson's convict brother, George.
Auden Fleming, the hefty owner of
the service station, stood up from the
witness chair and walked over to Miss
Davis in the courtroom. He pointed to
her and said "this lady here" was with
Jackson.
Fleming said that the woman—
whom, he later identified as Davis
through news pictures—waited outside
while Jackson came into the station
and asked for assistance. He added
that Jackson, who was 17, seemed
unsure of himself and "gave me the
impression he wanted help" from
Davis.
Challenging Fleming's identification
of Davis, defense attorney Leo Bran
ton asked the white witness, "Don't
you think all colored people look
alike?" The witness answered, "No in
Miss Davis' case." He then said that for
a black, Davis has unusually pale skin,
high cheekbones and a nose that turns
up. Davis smiled slightly during the
descriptions.
Fleming eventually conceded that
he only looked at Davis for fifteen
seconds, rather than several minutes,
during the only time he stood near her
at the service station. He also admitted
that he had confused Davis with her
sister in one of a series of photographs
shown to him by a state agent a week
after the Marin incident.
Assistant Attorney General Albert
Harris, the prosecutor, later admitted
that he had shown Fleming a photo
graph of Kendra Alexander shortly
before his testimony. Alexander looks
and dresses somewhat like Davis and
sits next to her in the courtroom.
Fleming's son, Peter, at first identi
fied Davis as the woman he saw with
Jackson at the gas station. But under
defense questioning, he admitted that
he had told state agents and a grand
jury that he "wasn't positive" who the
woman was.

The younger Fleming said he drove
Jackson and the woman back to their
van in his tow truck and pushed the
vehicle to start it. When they drove the
van back to the station, Fleming said,
Jackson told him the two customers
could not wait to have the battery
charged because "they wanted to get
back to the city."
Dennis Bosch, who also worked in
the gas station, identified Jackson and
said he saw the woman with him. But
neither prosecution nor defense ever
asked him if the woman was Davis.
Michael Vonada, a Marin County
fireman who was at the station,
identified Davis as the woman and
described her as having "spaces be
tween her teeth" and "smoking a
black cigar."
The defense w ill challenge Vonada's
testimony when the trial resumes
Monday after the weekend break.
If the jury is convinced that Davis
went with Jackson to the courthouse,
that incident will provide some of the
prosecution's most serious evidence
against her.
In other testimony yesterday, two
witnesses said they saw Jackson in
Judge Harold Haley's Marin court
room, August 6. Both said they were
also in court the next day, when
Jackson pulled a gun and began the
escape attempt.
Gordon Farrell, a San Quentin
guard, said that Jackson watched the
trial of convict James McLain briefly
on the morning of August 6. Marin
County Sheriff's Deputy James Layne
said that Jackson came into court that
afternoon and asked him why the
McLain trial was not then in session.
Layne explained that the trial had
been postponed until the next morn
ing.
Both witnesses said that Jackson
appeared to be outfitted in the same
raincoat and briefcase which he
brought into court during the escape
effort.

SAN JOSE — Jonathon Jackson and a
tall, slender black woman were seen at
the Marin County courthouse the day
before the shootout there, according
to four crucial prosecution witnesses
in the Angela Davis trial.
Three of yesterday's witnesses iden
tified the woman as Angela Davis. The
fourth was never asked to name
Jackson's companion, and the defense
tried to chip away at the certainty of
the other identifications.
All four witnesses were at a gas
station when Jackson and a woman
came in August 6, 1970 to ask for help
in starting a vehicle stalled next door
at the Marin Civic Center. One of the
witnesses helped the two "jump-start"
a bright yellow Hertz van, a descrip
tion exactly matching the truck which
Jackson allegedly used in the escape
effort the next day.
Jackson and three others were
killed in the Marin incident, which the

prosecution says was planned by Davis
in an effort to trade hostages for
Jackson's convict brother, George.
Auden Fleming, the hefty owner of
the service station, stood up from the
witness chair and walked over to Miss
Davis in the courtroom. He pointed to
her and said "this lady here" was with
Jackson.
Fleming said that the woman—
whom, he later identified as Davis
through news pictures—waited outside
while Jackson came into the station
and asked for assistance. He added
that Jackson, who was 17, seemed
unsure of himself and "gave me the
impression he wanted help" from
Davis.
Challenging Fleming's identification
of Davis, defense attorney Leo Bran
ton asked the white witness, "Don't
you think all colored people look
alike?" The witness answered, "No in
Miss Davis' case." He then said that for
a black, Davis has unusually pale skin,
high cheekbones and a nose that turns
up. Davis smiled slightly during the
descriptions.
Fleming eventually conceded that
he only looked at Davis for fifteen
seconds, rather than several minutes,
during the only time he stood near her
at the service station. He also admitted
that he had confused Davis with her
sister in one of a series of photographs
shown to him by a state agent a week
after the Marin incident.
Assistant Attorney General Albert
Harris, the prosecutor, later admitted
that he had shown Fleming a photo
graph of Kendra Alexander shortly
before his testimony. Alexander looks
and dresses somewhat like Davis and
sits next to her in the courtroom.
Fleming's son, Peter, at first identi
fied Davis as the woman he saw with
Jackson at the gas station. But under
defense questioning, he admitted that
he had told state agents and a grand
jury that he "wasn't positive" who the
woman was.

The younger Fleming said he drove
Jackson and the woman back to their
van in his tow truck and pushed the
vehicle to start it. When they drove the
van back to the station, Fleming said,
Jackson told him the two customers
could not wait to have the battery
charged because "they wanted to get
back to the city."
Dennis Bosch, who also worked in
the gas station, identified Jackson and
said he saw the woman with him. But
neither prosecution nor defense ever
asked him if the woman was Davis.
Michael Vonada, a Marin County
fireman who was at the station,
identified Davis as the woman and
described her as having "spaces be
tween her teeth" and "smoking a
black cigar."
The defense w ill challenge Vonada's
testimony when the trial resumes
Monday after the weekend break.
If the jury is convinced that Davis
went with Jackson to the courthouse,
that incident will provide some of the
prosecution's most serious evidence
against her.
In other testimony yesterday, two
witnesses said they saw Jackson in
Judge Harold Haley's Marin court
room, August 6. Both said they were
also in court the next day, when
Jackson pulled a gun and began the
escape attempt.
Gordon Farrell, a San Quentin
guard, said that Jackson watched the
trial of convict James McLain briefly
on the morning of August 6. Marin
County Sheriff's Deputy James Layne
said that Jackson came into court that
afternoon and asked him why the
McLain trial was not then in session.
Layne explained that the trial had
been postponed until the next morn
ing.
Both witnesses said that Jackson
appeared to be outfitted in the same
raincoat and briefcase which he
brought into court during the escape
effort.
