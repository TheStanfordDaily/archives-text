# Student Senate Decision
## Referendum On Câ€”15 Ordered 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
The student Senate voted last night
to put a referendum which calls for a
student majority on university disci
plinary panels on the ballot of a
special election next week.
The referendum, scheduled for
Wednesday and Thursday, May 12 and
13, reads: RESOLVED, THAT the
students of Stanford University will
not accept any judicial system that
does not provide for student majorities
on guilt-determining panels concerned
solely with student discipline.
"The agreement of the faculty
members of the Committee of Fifteen
to this basic principle of judgement by
one's peers is minimal condition for
continued discussion by student mem
bers of the C-15 on other provisions of
a judicial system."
The referendum was submitted to
the Senate by law student Steve
Heiser, who is one of the six student
members of the C-15. The student
members of the C-15 walked out of a
Tuesday night committee meeting
after the C-15 approved by a vote of 8
to 7, a faculty-majority judicial panel
for student discipline cases.
Heiser told the Senate that he and
the other student C-15 members

walked out because they felt the
approval of a faculty-majority disci
plinary system contradicted the wishes
of the student body.
In an April, 1971 student referen
dum, a proposal which called for a
system "composed only of students"
was approved by a vote of 1929-1186.
Heiser told the Senate that the
reason the faculty and administration
members of the C-15 would not
approve a student-majority was be
cause they felt "students were irre
sponsible."
Regarding next week's referendum,
Heiser said that if the stiident body
decides that a faculty-dominated panel
is acceptable, the student members
will return to the C-15 for further

deliberation on other proposals.
"If, however, the student body
reaffirms its desire to have a student
majority in disciplinary panels, and the
C-15 does not accept that, we will not
return for further deliberations," Hei
ser explained.
The student members of the C-15
are appointed by the student Senate.
He also said that "only a referen
dum with a heavy turnout has any
chance of affecting the decision of the
C-15."
In accordance with the Constitu
tion, the Senate formally removed
eight senators, including Ray White
and Willie Newberry, from the Senate
for missing three consecutive meeting
during one quarter.
