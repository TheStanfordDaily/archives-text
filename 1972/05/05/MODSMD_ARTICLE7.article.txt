## Câ€”15 Vote An Insult 
### 
The decision of the Committee of 15 (C-15)
Tuesday to approve a faculty-majority panel for stu
dent discipline cases is an insult to the entire Univer
sity community.
The walk-out by the six student members of
C-15 was an entirely appropriate response to the
Committee's total disregard for the student body's
wishes as expressed in an April, 1971 ASSU referen
dum.
A portion of that referendum, which passed by
more than 700 votes, asked that "judicial panels
composed only of students" consider student dis
cipline cases. By even refusing to accept a student
majority panel, C-15 showed that it had little, if
any, regard for student inputs.
Two weeks ago, President Richard Lyman re
marked that "more and more, college students are
being recognized as adults." That statement could
not be more hypocritical in light of the C-15's vote
to deny students the right to trial by a jury of their
peers.
Although Law Professor and C-15 member Jack
Friedenthal said that it was "perfectly reasonable"
for students to want a trial by their peers, he voted
against such a system. He explained that "students
are not as able to get a grasp" of the concepts in
volved in the more political cases coming before any
judicial system as they are to understand the issues
presented in Honor Code violations. However, when
questioned, Friedenthal was hard-pressed to explain
the fundamental difference between the two types
of cases.

In his conversations with the Daily, Friedenthal
implied that the C-15's decision grew largelyout of a
desire to guarantee that faculty interests would be
served by any new judicial system that is recom
mended by C-15.
The Daily has previously made known its abhor
rence of the current Campus Judicial Panel, but it
appears that the C-15's new judicial system will
prove to be even worse than the CJP.
Unlike the CJP, which has an equal number of
voting student and faculty members, the new sys
tem as decided upon by C-15 will have five voting
faculty members and only four students. The new
system clearly represents a step backwards in the
field of student rights and responsibilities.
How can the administration and the faculty ex
pect students to accept the responsibilities of adult
hood if they are not prepared to give those same
students the rights of adults?
Friedenthal and other C-15 members have asserted
that they are "dedicated to making sure that what
ever system we have is a fair one." However, the
composition which they have decided upon for the
new system is completely unfair to those whom it
affects and does not have the consent of those
whom it governs.
In the interests of fairness and equal rights, we
endorse the student C-15 members' request for a
student referendum of the issue of the judicial sys
tem's composition. We urge students to make
known their dissatisfaction with a faculty-domi
nated system and to give a vote of confidence to an
all-student panel.
