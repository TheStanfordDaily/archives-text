# Buy UFWOC Lettuce
## 
### 
If you were a farm worker, you would probably
be poorly educated with a big family to help feed,
and little chance to make it over the poverty line for
your hours of backbreaking work. If you are one of
the five million farm workers without a union
contract, you will collect no unemployment
insurance, put up with a lower than standard
minimum wage, and toil without the protections of
job security, holidays, sick pay, overtime oav, and
sanitary facilities.
The odds that you will die from pneumonia or
the flu would be 200 percent higher than the
national average; from accidents, 300 percent
higher. It would be 125 percent more likely than
average that your child would not live past being a
baby.
Chances are you will not live to be 50 years old.
If you worked in the lettuce fields of the Salinas
Valley, you would most likely be under a Teamster
Union contract that would provide you with no
relief from the often heavy hand of a company
foreman, no health protection for the first two full
months you work, and no escape from the huge
volume of deadly pesticides sprayed over your
fields.
Three of the largest growers of lettuce in
California have taken a step to change the living
conditions of their workers by signing contracts
with the United Farm Workers Union. The move did
not come voluntarily for it cost the growers
financially, and. some believe, hurt the quality of
their product because the contract limits the
amount of pesticides used.
Hut the benefits that the contract has brought to
both groups have far outweighed the one-sided
drawbacks. UFWOC members today have secure
jobs, progressive hospitalization, surgery, maternity,
disability, and life insurance programs, and the right
to take a 10 minute rest once every four hours in
the field.

For the growers, a UFWOC contract means that
their product will not face a potentially large and
damaging consumer boycott from supporters of the
farm workers. As the Delano grape growers can
attest, a boycott can be powerful.
The United Farm Workers is not a big union.
There is no ruling elite separate from the workers in
the field. And, despite the scattered reports of
violence that has flared from both sides during the
hotly contested strikes of 1970, there is an official
attitude towards non-violence and truth.
Since replacement labor is so cheap and plentiful
in the agricultural regions of the state, and the
union is limited in size and resources, the farm
workers have found strikes as a form of pressure on
growers unworkable. The best alternative is a
boycott, but, as the successful grape boycott
showed, a requisite is cooperation and support from
consumers.
In 1969, a student vote here persuaded
University food services and Tresidder Union to
desist in ordering, buying, and serving grapes. We
believe the same must be done again, this time for
lettuce. If the University's supplier is to be believed,
the food services on campus now receive only
UFWOC lettuce, but, as strongly as Forrest Tregea
may deny it.the evidence shows that Tresidder. the
Coffeehouse, and the Faculty Club do not. Whether
it be through a referendum, conversations with food
service personnel, or constructive protest, we feel
students should lend their strength to changing this
policy.
We further urge the University, as a large scale
buyer of produce to take steps to insure that
UFWOC lettuce is purchased exclusively by all
buyers on campus. We hope such a policy will be
initiated in a spirit of not only appeasing concerned
students, but also of helping the farm workers in
their effort to attain a decent standard of living and
respect.

The odds that you will die from pneumonia or
the flu would be 200 percent higher than the
national average; from accidents, 300 percent
higher. It would be 125 percent more likely than
average that your child would not live past being a
baby.
Chances are you will not live to be 50 years old.
If you worked in the lettuce fields of the Salinas
Valley, you would most likely be under a Teamster
Union contract that would provide you with no
relief from the often heavy hand of a company
foreman, no health protection for the first two full
months you work, and no escape from the huge
volume of deadly pesticides sprayed over your
fields.
Three of the largest growers of lettuce in
California have taken a step to change the living
conditions of their workers by signing contracts
with the United Farm Workers Union. The move did
not come voluntarily for it cost the growers
financially, and. some believe, hurt the quality of
their product because the contract limits the
amount of pesticides used.
Hut the benefits that the contract has brought to
both groups have far outweighed the one-sided
drawbacks. UFWOC members today have secure
jobs, progressive hospitalization, surgery, maternity,
disability, and life insurance programs, and the right
to take a 10 minute rest once every four hours in
the field.

For the growers, a UFWOC contract means that
their product will not face a potentially large and
damaging consumer boycott from supporters of the
farm workers. As the Delano grape growers can
attest, a boycott can be powerful.
The United Farm Workers is not a big union.
There is no ruling elite separate from the workers in
the field. And, despite the scattered reports of
violence that has flared from both sides during the
hotly contested strikes of 1970, there is an official
attitude towards non-violence and truth.
Since replacement labor is so cheap and plentiful
in the agricultural regions of the state, and the
union is limited in size and resources, the farm
workers have found strikes as a form of pressure on
growers unworkable. The best alternative is a
boycott, but, as the successful grape boycott
showed, a requisite is cooperation and support from
consumers.
In 1969, a student vote here persuaded
University food services and Tresidder Union to
desist in ordering, buying, and serving grapes. We
believe the same must be done again, this time for
lettuce. If the University's supplier is to be believed,
the food services on campus now receive only
UFWOC lettuce, but, as strongly as Forrest Tregea
may deny it.the evidence shows that Tresidder. the
Coffeehouse, and the Faculty Club do not. Whether
it be through a referendum, conversations with food
service personnel, or constructive protest, we feel
students should lend their strength to changing this
policy.
We further urge the University, as a large scale
buyer of produce to take steps to insure that
UFWOC lettuce is purchased exclusively by all
buyers on campus. We hope such a policy will be
initiated in a spirit of not only appeasing concerned
students, but also of helping the farm workers in
their effort to attain a decent standard of living and
respect.
If you were a farm worker, you would probably
be poorly educated with a big family to help feed,
and little chance to make it over the poverty line for
your hours of backbreaking work. If you are one of
the five million farm workers without a union
contract, you will collect no unemployment
insurance, put up with a lower than standard
minimum wage, and toil without the protections of
job security, holidays, sick pay, overtime oav, and
sanitary facilities.
