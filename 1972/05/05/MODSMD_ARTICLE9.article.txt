War & Diplomacy
The February 28 issue of The
Nation had a review by Ronald
Radosh of Stephen E. Ambrose's
new book, Rise to Globalism.
Radosh notes the book's
contributions to study of the
Truman era. (In fact, there are
severe shortcomings to Ambrose's
treatment of war and diplomacy
in the Franklin Delano Roosevelt
era. For this period, I recommend
Gabriel Kolko's The Politics of
War, Lloyd C. Gardner's
Economic Aspects of New Deal
Diplomacy, William L. Neumann's
America Encounters Japan, and
A.J.P. Taylor's The Origins of the
Second World War.)
Ambrose's book is a survey of
more than three decades of
American diplomacy, covering the
years 1938-1970. It is the best
such compact survey available, for
it combines readability with an
interpretation that revises in a
critical fashion the orthodox

liberal explanations of the Cold
War.
Foreign Aid
The February 1972 Report of
the radical North American
Congress on Latin America
reprinted excerpts from the "Fact
Sheets on Selected Aspects of
U.S. Foreign Economic
Assistance." These fact sheets
were written in 1971 by the U.S.
Agency for International
Development with the intention
of convincing U.S. congressmen
that foreign aid provided
significant subsidies to their
constituents at home and that
foreign aid played an important
role in combating anti-imperialist
revolutions abroad. The
information contained in these
documents is revealing:
" 'Foreign aid' — loans and
grants extended by the Agency
for International Development —
financed 7.1 percent of all U.S.
exports to the developing

countries in fiscal year 1971.
"AID financed exports in fiscal
1971 totaled $971.8 million — 2.3
percent of the value of all U.S.
exports, which was $43, 116
million.
"Elimination of AID financing
would have a significant adverse
effect not only on U.S. industries
in these export areas, but also on
the U.S. shipping industry. Over
the period FY 1964-1969, the
cargo financed under Foreign
Assistance Act (FAA) programs
has ranged from 22 to 30 percent
of the total cargo moving on U.S.
flag shipping.
'The Agency for International
Development purchased
$975,000,000 worth of
commodities in fiscal year 1971,
with more than 99 percent of it or
$971,800,000 being spent in the
United States."
The fact sheets point out the
role of foreign aid in bolstering
"the coalition led by Col. Hugo
Banzer" which overthrew the
government of General Juan Jose
Torres in Bolivia. Banzer is
favorably inclined toward the
interests of Bolivia's feudal
landlords and toward granting
monopoly concessions to U.S.
companies, while Torres was not.
The fact sheets also pointed out
that cutting off foreign aid would
have disruptive effects "at a time
when sensitive U.S.-Panama Canal
Treaty negotiations are in
progress."
Prague Spring
The April 22 Manchester
Guardian Weekly from Britain
contains a fascinating interview
with economist Ota Sik, whose
1968 reforms were designed to
make Czechoslovak socialism
more libertarian. (He is now a
professor at Basle University in
Switzerland.)
Sik tells of Soviet party chief
Leonid Brezhnev's dislike of Sik's
radical ideas. He talks about
behind-the-scenes happenings and
maneuvers in Czechoslovakia in
1968 and discusses some of the
tactical mistakes made by the
reformers.
Sik's newest book, Alienated
Ideology, will be published in
September in Germany. In it, Sik
"develops a critique of the
economic theory of Marxism and
studies its failures in practice." In
the interview, Sik calls for
decentralization of economic
institutions.
Compulsory Education
In the April 1972 issue of Civil
Liberties (publication of the
national ACLU), Helen Baker calls
for an ACLU challenge of
compulsory education laws.
She asks whether compulsory
education is tolerable to "the civil
libertarian philosophy — a
philosophy that cannot tolerate a
compulsory draft, compulsory
universal service, compulsory
commitment of the mentally ill or
of drug addicts, compulsory flag
salutes, compulsory loyalty oaths,
or compulsory lie detector tests."
Baker contends that students
should be free to leave the schools
and "form alternative learning
communities." She says,"The
state has no right to confine its
citizens to institutions against
their will when they have
committed no crime and when the
institutions deprive them of their
rights.

"The State should also not be
in the business of criminalizing
the young — children should not
be locked into juvenile detention
facilities or psychiatric
institutions because of offenses,
such as truancy, that are not
punishable as crimes in the adult
world."
Nixonite Socialism
According to the New York
Times of April 30, "Amtrak, the
taxpayer-financed corporation
created by Congress to revitalize
America's passenger trains, ends
its first year today deeply in debt
and without having reversed the
national decline in rail travel that
began more than 25 years ago."
The next day the Times
reported that Sen. William
Proxmire (D.—Wisconsin) had
called for scrapping the Nixon
administration wage-price
controls. Sen. Proxmire
contended that the controls do
not work, that inflation had not
been stopped, and that the
complex rules function "to the
advantage of the wealthy and
sophisticated."
"The small businessman, small
union, or unorganized worker
doesn't know how to milk the
system and is at a disadvantage,"
according to Sen. Proxmire.
On April 7, Sen. Proxmire
issued a statement complaining
that the U.S. Navy appeared to be
arranging a "backdoor bailout"
for Grumman Aircraft
Corporation that would add
several million dollars to the
procurement costs of the F-14
fighter aircraft.
The April 24 Wall Street
Journal had an article based on
interviews with Commerce
Secretary Peter G. Peterson,
Treasury Secretary John B.
Connally, and other Nixon
advisers concerning the Nixon
administration's plans for the
American economy.
The common theme of these
advisers was that if Nixon is
re-elected, he will make changes
along the following lines: "Less
competition among American
businesses so that there can be
more competition against foreign
business; Washington must
become less of an antagonist for
U.S. industry and much more of a
cooperative 'partner'."
Other proposals include forcing
unions to end strikes and "greatly
increasing tax incentives or
starting direct federal subsidies to
companies engaged in foreign
trade." One official argues that
special aid to the aerospace
industry "could be justified on
the ground that if aerospace loses
its 'consumer base' the costs of
developing and producing military
aircraft will be 'greatly'
increased."
Connally suggests that if a U.S.
company went overseas with some
sort of federal insurance coverage
and then entered into an
agreement with a host
government, the U.S. government
might well "say this agreement
cannot be changed, altered,
amended or terminated in any
form or fashion without the prior
written approval of the U.S.
government." And that, according
to Connally, might make foreign
government think twice before
acting against U.S. companies.
