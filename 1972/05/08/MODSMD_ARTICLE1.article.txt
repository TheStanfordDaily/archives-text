# Warren Wonka Back From Jail
## 
### JERRY COLEMAN Daily VIP Editor 
Just at this point in Stanford's
history when a controversy is raging
over the lack of a mascot, a reassuring
remnant from the tradition-rich past
has returned to campus; from the halls
of his hallowed home, Wilbur, to that
massive expanse which is Hoover, let
his name reverberate: Warren G.
Wonka!
The Wonka story is a long and
proud one. For those whose memories
have been numbed by prolonged
study, or for those new to the Farm,
let the facts be known.
Warren G. Wonka first surfaced in
1938 as a Chaparral bra salesman.
Apparently flooded with orders, he
limited his headline-making appear
ances to campus for the following
thirteen years.
During those years, Warren appear
ed on countless class lists, enrollment
cards, and commencement programs
(one of his more recent graduations
occurred in June of 1960).
Western Civ Whiz
He even received a B on a Western
Civ final, but could get no credit in
that class (or any other for that
matter) when the registrar could not
locate his name on a list of registered
students.
Thus, Warren remained a perma
nent undergraduate, despite his many
graduations (if this is confusing for
you, think how bad it must have been
for the registrar!).
Then, on May 26, 1951, a letter
from Wonka, postmarked Hadacol,
Mississippi, was secretly slipped into
the personal files of the then-Stanford
President, Wallace Sterling.
The letter read, "Dear Wally: Just
wanted to prove it could still be done.
We were careful not to harm or disturb
anything [better watch those dip
lomas). Enclosed find one used paint
brush. We missed you in church.
Reverently yours, Warren G. Wonka."
Infamous Stanford Alumni
By the time the letter was discover
ed, in April, 1957, the paint brush had
deteriorated beyond recognition. Para
doxically, Warren's own recognition
was on a meteoric rise from that date
on.
During the next two years, Warren
turned up as an Army Pfc. in
Kirch-Goens, Germany, received one
write-in vote in a Palo Alto City
Council election, applied for student
insurance from the Continental Na
tional Group Life Insurance Co., then
disappeared before the company could
collect the $24 for his first premium.
But mysterious signs of his presence
kept cropping up during the early
sixties. Warren's name appeared in the
Stanford Band handbook as head of
the Scotch bass section and holder of

the Shuchat Legion of Merit Award.
Letters sent to the Daily indicated
Warren's presence in Timbuktu, Afri
ca, as a missionary doctor, and in
Antarctica as a member of a U.S. Navy
scientific operation.
Included in the Antarctica letter
was Warren's first donation toward a
matching grant from the Ford Founda
tion. The five dollar bill was in
amazingly good condition.
Clean Bible
The next mention of his famous
name comes from an October, 1966
Art Hoppe column in the San
Francisco Chronicle. Mentioned as
"Mr. Warren G. Wonka of Watsonville,
statewide Chairman of the Christian
Committee for a Clean Bible," some of
his statements generated an angry
letter from Modesto to the Editor.
Evidently, Warren talked himself
into quite a bit of trouble. Witness the
following communication—a telegram
sent to the Daily on Nov. 2, 1966:
YOUR BOY WISHES YOUR
HOME COMING ALL THE BEST
STOP HE IS GETTING HIS DAILIES
REGULARLY AT FEDERAL PENI
TENTIARY, LEAVENWORTH KAN
SAS STOP FROM WARREN G.
WONKA BENEVOLENT AND PRO
TECTIVE ASSOCIATION.
Yet just as the Warren Wonka file
seemed to be closing, a new one was
beginning in the name of his sister,
Wendy.
College Beauty Queen
Headlines from newspapers in San
Jose, Vallejo, Ventura, Ontaria, and El
Cajon revealed that Wendy Wonka had
reached the semi-finals for California
in a national college queen contest
sponsored by a mayonnaise manufac
turer. Unfortunately, Administration
officials were unable to contact her to
inform her of the good news.
Further news from the Wonka
family began to fade, slowed down to
a mere trickle, and then stopped
altogether. But now Warren has
reappeared, not in Paris or Southeast
Asia, but right here on campus.
Secret Interview
Late last night he granted the Daily
a single interview, the text of which
follows in its total, uncut, unexpurgat
ed edition.
DAILY: Warren, it's good to see
you again. What brings you back to
Stanford?
WGW: I'm here to see my younger
sister, Wilma. She's a freshman this
year, and now that I heard the band is
accepting women I thought I'd see
what I could do to get her in.
DAILY: Does she play kazoo and
triangle like you did in your band
days?
WGW: No, she plays parade brass
fiddle.
DAILY: I see. Well, Warren, we

know of your sisters Wendy and
Wilma. Do you have any brothers?
WGW: Yes I have an older brother,
Wilbur, named after a former Stanford
president. But we in the family call
him Willy for short.
DAILY: Willy Wonka? Where is he
now?
WGW: He manages a chocolate
factory in Hershey, Pennsylvania.
DAILY: Changing the subject,
Warren, what do you think about the
recent campus political activism?
WGW: All I can say is it would have
been the "El Camino 206," but police
these days are more thorough and
crossed my name off the list.
DAILY: The last we heard fro you,
Warren, you were in a federal prison.
When were you released?
WGW: I was given a 20-year
sentence but President Nixon ordered
a presidential pardon for me after my
first six years.
DAILY: Are you a personal friend
of the President's?
WGW: No, but I promised to swing
the campus vote for him this year.
Also, while in prison, I organized an
Inmates Lobby for Nixon In '68.
DAILY: How did you keep busy in

prison during non-years?
VVGW: I did quite a bit of writing.
DAILY: What did you write?
WGW: Oh—memos to ITT about
convention bargains, some papers on
the Vietnam War for the Pentagon
matters of that sort.
DAILY: I see your life continues to
be enshrouded in secrecy. Is that the
reason why you're wearing a paper bag
over your head?
WGW: One can never be too
careful. If nobody knows what I look
like, nobody can ever identify me
doing anything.
DAILY: One last question, Warren:
Have you ever thought about going
back into bra salesmanship?
WGW: Naw—the market's not very
firm anymore. Sales are sagging.
DAILY: Thank you for this inter
view, Warren G. Wonka. Our staff
would like to wish you success in your
future adventures, wherever they may
lead you. I'm sure our student body
and many alumni as well would like to
join in to—watch out for that post!
And so, ever-mysterious and never
clearly seen, Warren Wonka, a legend
in his time, vanished once more from
his alma mater.

SANS BAG, SANS REPROCHE—In a rare candid moment (not to imply that
Mr. Wonka is rarely candid), Warren doffs his bag for a peek at that majestic
visage.
