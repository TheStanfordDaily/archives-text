## Batsmen Lose Twice 
### MIKE HERMAN 
The Stanford baseball team
blew themselves out of contention
for the Pacific Eight Conference
Southern Division title this
weekend, as they lost two of three
to division-leading Southern
California.
Losing the opener of the series,
4-3, then splitting the Saturday
doubleheader, winning 9-1 in the
first game before blowing a
seven-run lead in the nightcap to
lose 10-7.
In a sense, the three games
typified much of the Cardinals'
conference season, a season that
could be termed as one of wasted
potential. In the first game, one of
six one-run games Stanford has
played in, the Cards left eight men
on base in the nine inning game.
The first game of the
doubleheader was a display of
Stanford's potential, as they made
the most of every offensive
opportunity, while receiving
brilliant pitching. The final
contest was one in which the
Cardinals built up a 7-0 lead after
five innings, only to see it
evaporate to a pressure-proof USC
ballclub.
The Trojans have now won the
Southern Division for the fifth
consecutive year, entering the
final weekend of the season with a
12-3 record. Stanford holds a
tenuous lead over California for
second place with a 8-7 mark to
the Bears' 7-8. UCLA brings up
â€¢the rear with a 3-12 record. USC
will await the outcome of the
Northern Division race between
Washington State and Oregon and
will play the winner for the
conference championship at
Bovard Field two weeks hence.
Trojans Take Lead
1 For Stanford, there is no one
to blame but themselves. In the
first game, the hustling Trojans
built up a 3-0 lead, scoring the
three runs on four hits and an
error. In the second inning,
catcher Sam Ceci singled to
rightfield, went to second on a
wild pitch, to third on an infield
out and rode home on a sacrifice
fly out by shortstop Rod Adolph.
In the third inning, first
baseman Darrell Arenstein got
aboard on an error by Stanford
second baseman Dave Edson.
Arenstein was sacrificed to
second, went to third on a ground
out to shortstop and was singled

home by centerfielder Fred Lynn.
Troy added another tally in the
fourth when rightfielder Tim
Steele got aboard on a fielder's
choice and was driven home on a
single by Arenstein.
Greg Widman, the eventual
winning pitcher, hurled brilliantly
during the first five innings,
allowing only two hits. In
addition, he struck out seven
Cardinals in the first five frames.
In the sixth inning, the
momentum started to shift
towards Stanford. Bob DiPietro,
who had relatively poor control
for the first six innings, was taken
out of the game, and pinchhitter
Mark Lucich singled to
centerfield. Dave Edson then
walked and both runners moved
up on an infield out by third
baseman Mickey Aguirre.
Centerfielder Tom Williams
grounded to second, scoring
Lucich, and rightfielder Mike
Nelson singled home Edson.
SC Leads
Thus, entering the top of the
seventh inning, USC led by a slim
3-2 lead, with Stanford very much
in the ball game. Fred Lynn led
off the frame with a ground rule
double to rightfield. The
subsequent actions on the field
were mentioned by the Trojan
players after the game as the
psychological turning point of the
ball game.
Relief pitcher Tom Changnon,
pitching carefully to the heart of
the USC batting order, suddenly
whirled and threw to second base,
picking off the diving Lynn. Then,
turning to the Trojan bench,
which had razzed the Stanford
pitchers unmercifully the entire
game, Changnon allegedly made
an obscene gesture with his
throwing hand.
This gesture, the Trojan players
later reported, sparked the visiting
team at its lowest point of the
game, and the next inning USC
pushed over an insurance run that
proved the winning margin of the
game.
Each team scored in the eighth
inning. Rob Adolph doubled to
lead off the Trojan half, was
sacrificed to third base and then
scored on a single by Darrell
Arenstein. For Stanford, Mickey
Aguirre reached second on an
error by rightfielder Tim Steele
and scored on a subsequent single
by Mike Nelson.
In the ninth, the Trojans

threatened again, loading the
bases against Stanford reliever
Dave Frost. Frost was able to get
Rob Adolph to ground into a
force out at the plate and then
induced Tim Steele to bounce
back to the box.
Frustration
In their final display of
frustrating baseball, Stanford
entered the bottom of the ninth
one run down. Rod Boone led off
by striking out. Catcher Bob
Reece then singled to left, but
pinchhitter Bob Hampton popped
out to the second baseman. Mark
Lucich singled and the Cards had
runners on first and second with
two down. Dave Edson then hit a
slow ground ball to shortstop
which infielder Smalley caught in
full stride and then outraced
Lucich to second base to end the
game.
The opener of the Saturday
doubleheader was totally
Stanford's show. Demonstrating
the hustle that had definitely been
lacking in the first game, the
Cardinals exploded for five
unearned runs in the fourth inning
and four earned runs i* the sixth,
then rode home on the strong
pitching of Nick Peterson to
swamp Troy, 9-1.
Peterson pitched brilliantly
allowing only three hits in the
first five innings, before
surrendering a run on five hits in
the final two frames of the
seven-inning match. He struck out
six Trojans while walking only
one.
Offensively, the Cards made
the most of the seven hits allowed
by three USC pitchers. In the
fourth, Mark Lucich walked and
leftfielder Rod Boone reached
base on a fielder's choice, while
Lucich went to third on a
throwing error by the pitcher
Randy Scarberry. Bob Reece
singled for a run, but was forced
at second by Dave Edson. Kim
Hannaford drove home Boone
when he reached second base on a
throwing error by shortstop
Smalley. With runners at second
and third, pitcher Peterson helped
his own cause by singling home
the third run of the inning. One
out later, Tom Williams crashed a
triple off the rightfield fence,
driving in Hannaford and
Peterson.
Big Play
In the sixth inning, Rod Boone
and Bob Reece combined for one

of the outstanding defensive
performances of the season. With
runners at first and second and
one out, leftfielder Ken Huizenga
singled into the leftfield corner,
Boone in hot pursuit. Mike
Swiderski, who had pinchhit for
reliever Jeff Reinke, turned third
just as Boone grabbed the ball.
The throw and Swiderski raced to
the plate, with Boone's throw a
perfect strike along the foul line.
Reece crouched, blocking the
plate as he caught the ball, then
tagged out the surprised
Swiderski, killing the rally.
In the bottom of the inning,
Trojan pitcher Wayne Schrader
walked four of the first five
batters he faced. Third baseman
Jeff Port moved to the mound to
relieve, but before he could retire
the side, all the runners on base
had scored, as Stanford went on
to win 9-1.
The important factor of
momentum had definitely swung
in Stanford's direction, and they
started out the second game with
vengeance. In the first inning,
they bombed starter Russ
McQueen for four runs, three of
which were earned. Seven of the
first eight batters hit safely, as
Aguirre, Williams, Lucich, Boone,
and Edson all singled, sandwiching
a double play by Mike Nelson and
a triple by Tom Williams.
The next inning, the Cards
scored two unearned runs in the
second inning and added another
in the fourth, as it very much
appeared that USC would be
forced to return to Los Angeles in
order to clinch the divisional title.
Then, once again, a psychological
lift brought the flattened Trojans

back into the ball game, a game in
which their title-game experience
showed itself in the team's poise.
Stanford Ahead
With Stanford ahead 7-0, a
Stanford batter hit a harmless foul
ball down the firstbase line. The
ball was retrieved by a member of
the Stanford bullpen but was
tossed in the direction of the
infield where the USC players
stood. Despite a shouted warning,
first baseman Darrell Arenstein
was struck in the back of the leg
by the ball. This action, coming
two innings after a
throw by second baseman Milt
Guggia had cleared the Stanford
bench, was taken by the Trojans:
as retaliation. Once again, they
appeared to come alive. In the
remaining four innings, the game
completely reversed its course,
and with the reversal went all of
the Cardinals' hopes for the title.
In the sixth inning, the Trojans
converted a walk, a double and
two singles into three runs. Starter
Dan Shaw survived the inning,
then retired the side in order in
the seventh, but was driven from
the box in the top of the eighth
when USC scored four more runs
to tie the score. With one out,
third baseman Jeff Port doubled to
left and came home on a double
by centerfielder Fred Lynn.
Tim Steele reached secondbase
on a throwing error by Kim
Hannaford, allowing Lynn to
score. One out later, Darrell
Arenstein doubled home Steele
and was himself scored on a single
by Roy Smalley, tying the score.
Game Tied
In the bottom of the eighth,
Stanford wasted a one out single

by Mickey Aguirre. Reliever Mike
Higgins entered the top of the
ninth tied at 7-7, but with the
game moving very much in USC's
favor.
Relief pitcher Mark Sogge
grounded out to start the ninth,
but leftfielder Jeff Pederson
walked. Jeff Port popped out, but
then Higgins walked Fred Lynn
and loaded the bases on a single
by Tim Steele. Pitching carefully,
Higgins fell behind the Trojan
catcher Sam Ceci and finally
walked in what proved to be the
winning tally. Tom Changnon
came in to relieve, but gave up a
two-run producing single by
Darrell Arenstein to ice the game.
The stunned Stanford batters
went quietly in the bottom of the
ninth, as Sogge retired the side to
gain the victory in relief.
For the Trojans, three hitters
combined to. pace the series
victory. Centerfielder Fred Lynn
belted Stanford pitching during
the set at a .636 clip, cracking
three doubles, while scoring three
runs and driving in three more.
First baseman Darrell Arenstein
got five hits in eleven official at
bats. Arenstein was the big clutch
hitter for Southern Cal, driving in
five runs, while scoring two
himself. Finally, rightfielder Tim
Steele, who had a miserable series
against Stanford pitching in April,
responded at a .364 mark, leading
the third game comeback with
three runs scored.
Stanford also had several
hitters who batted well against the
Trojan staff. Much overshadowed
by the team significance of the
series, Bob Reece had perhaps his
finest series of the year as he

connected for eight hits in
thirteen trips to the plate for a
.615 mark. Reece, reaffirming his
position as the best clutch hitter
on the team, drove in four runs
and scored another, while playing
a masterful series behind the
plate. Centerfielder Tom Williams
and second baseman Dave Edson
each collected three hits, with
Williams driving in four runs for
the series.
Sad Weekend
Yet, in a larger sense, it is hard
to find anything bright in
Stanford's performance over the
weekend. Four weeks ago,
Stanford was in first place in the
nation. Now, they will have to
battle for second place in their
division.
Next weekend, the team will
not be playing for the
championship as it had planned,
but for its pride. Friday, Stanford
plays a single game against
California, before invading
Berkeley for a doubleheader on
Saturday.

the side, all the runners on base
had scored, as Stanford went on
to win 9-1.
The important factor of
momentum had definitely swung
in Stanford's direction, and they
started out the second game with
vengeance. In the first inning,
they bombed starter Russ
McQueen for four runs, three of
which were earned. Seven of the
first eight batters hit safely, as
Aguirre, Williams, Lucich, Boone,
and Edson all singled, sandwiching
a double play by Mike Nelson and
a triple by Tom Williams.
The next inning, the Cards
scored two unearned runs in the
second inning and added another
in the fourth, as it very much
appeared that USC would be
forced to return to Los Angeles in
order to clinch the divisional title.
Then, once again, a psychological
lift brought the flattened Trojans

back into the ball game, a game in
which their title-game experience
showed itself in the team's poise.
Stanford Ahead
With Stanford ahead 7-0, a
Stanford batter hit a harmless foul
ball down the firstbase line. The
ball was retrieved by a member of
the Stanford bullpen but was
tossed in the direction of the
infield where the USC players
stood. Despite a shouted warning,
first baseman Darrell Arenstein
was struck in the back of the leg
by the ball. This action, coming
two innings after a
throw by second baseman Milt
Guggia had cleared the Stanford
bench, was taken by the Trojans:
as retaliation. Once again, they
appeared to come alive. In the
remaining four innings, the game
completely reversed its course,
and with the reversal went all of
the Cardinals' hopes for the title.
In the sixth inning, the Trojans
converted a walk, a double and
two singles into three runs. Starter
Dan Shaw survived the inning,
then retired the side in order in
the seventh, but was driven from
the box in the top of the eighth
when USC scored four more runs
to tie the score. With one out,
third baseman Jeff Port doubled to
left and came home on a double
by centerfielder Fred Lynn.
Tim Steele reached secondbase
on a throwing error by Kim
Hannaford, allowing Lynn to
score. One out later, Darrell
Arenstein doubled home Steele
and was himself scored on a single
by Roy Smalley, tying the score.
Game Tied
In the bottom of the eighth,
Stanford wasted a one out single

by Mickey Aguirre. Reliever Mike
Higgins entered the top of the
ninth tied at 7-7, but with the
game moving very much in USC's
favor.
Relief pitcher Mark Sogge
grounded out to start the ninth,
but leftfielder Jeff Pederson
walked. Jeff Port popped out, but
then Higgins walked Fred Lynn
and loaded the bases on a single
by Tim Steele. Pitching carefully,
Higgins fell behind the Trojan
catcher Sam Ceci and finally
walked in what proved to be the
winning tally. Tom Changnon
came in to relieve, but gave up a
two-run producing single by
Darrell Arenstein to ice the game.
The stunned Stanford batters
went quietly in the bottom of the
ninth, as Sogge retired the side to
gain the victory in relief.
For the Trojans, three hitters
combined to. pace the series
victory. Centerfielder Fred Lynn
belted Stanford pitching during
the set at a .636 clip, cracking
three doubles, while scoring three
runs and driving in three more.
First baseman Darrell Arenstein
got five hits in eleven official at
bats. Arenstein was the big clutch
hitter for Southern Cal, driving in
five runs, while scoring two
himself. Finally, rightfielder Tim
Steele, who had a miserable series
against Stanford pitching in April,
responded at a .364 mark, leading
the third game comeback with
three runs scored.
Stanford also had several
hitters who batted well against the
Trojan staff. Much overshadowed
by the team significance of the
series, Bob Reece had perhaps his
finest series of the year as he

connected for eight hits in
thirteen trips to the plate for a
.615 mark. Reece, reaffirming his
position as the best clutch hitter
on the team, drove in four runs
and scored another, while playing
a masterful series behind the
plate. Centerfielder Tom Williams
and second baseman Dave Edson
each collected three hits, with
Williams driving in four runs for
the series.
Sad Weekend
Yet, in a larger sense, it is hard
to find anything bright in
Stanford's performance over the
weekend. Four weeks ago,
Stanford was in first place in the
nation. Now, they will have to
battle for second place in their
division.
Next weekend, the team will
not be playing for the
championship as it had planned,
but for its pride. Friday, Stanford
plays a single game against
California, before invading
Berkeley for a doubleheader on
Saturday.

SAFE OR OUT?â€”First baseman Mark Lucich (20) dives to tag a USC batter last Friday on Sunken Diamond. Lucich missed the batter as the
Trojans went on to win 4-3. The team finishes its season against Cal next weekend.
The Stanford baseball team
blew themselves out of contention
for the Pacific Eight Conference
Southern Division title this
weekend, as they lost two of three
to division-leading Southern
California.
Losing the opener of the series,
4-3, then splitting the Saturday
doubleheader, winning 9-1 in the
first game before blowing a
seven-run lead in the nightcap to
lose 10-7.
In a sense, the three games
typified much of the Cardinals'
conference season, a season that
could be termed as one of wasted
potential. In the first game, one of
six one-run games Stanford has
played in, the Cards left eight men
on base in the nine inning game.
The first game of the
doubleheader was a display of
Stanford's potential, as they made
the most of every offensive
opportunity, while receiving
brilliant pitching. The final
contest was one in which the
Cardinals built up a 7-0 lead after
five innings, only to see it
evaporate to a pressure-proof USC
ballclub.
The Trojans have now won the
Southern Division for the fifth
consecutive year, entering the
final weekend of the season with a
12-3 record. Stanford holds a
tenuous lead over California for
second place with a 8-7 mark to
the Bears' 7-8. UCLA brings up
â€¢the rear with a 3-12 record. USC
will await the outcome of the
Northern Division race between
Washington State and Oregon and
will play the winner for the
conference championship at
Bovard Field two weeks hence.
Trojans Take Lead
1 For Stanford, there is no one
to blame but themselves. In the
first game, the hustling Trojans
built up a 3-0 lead, scoring the
three runs on four hits and an
error. In the second inning,
catcher Sam Ceci singled to
rightfield, went to second on a
wild pitch, to third on an infield
out and rode home on a sacrifice
fly out by shortstop Rod Adolph.
In the third inning, first
baseman Darrell Arenstein got
aboard on an error by Stanford
second baseman Dave Edson.
Arenstein was sacrificed to
second, went to third on a ground
out to shortstop and was singled

home by centerfielder Fred Lynn.
Troy added another tally in the
fourth when rightfielder Tim
Steele got aboard on a fielder's
choice and was driven home on a
single by Arenstein.
Greg Widman, the eventual
winning pitcher, hurled brilliantly
during the first five innings,
allowing only two hits. In
addition, he struck out seven
Cardinals in the first five frames.
In the sixth inning, the
momentum started to shift
towards Stanford. Bob DiPietro,
who had relatively poor control
for the first six innings, was taken
out of the game, and pinchhitter
Mark Lucich singled to
centerfield. Dave Edson then
walked and both runners moved
up on an infield out by third
baseman Mickey Aguirre.
Centerfielder Tom Williams
grounded to second, scoring
Lucich, and rightfielder Mike
Nelson singled home Edson.
SC Leads
Thus, entering the top of the
seventh inning, USC led by a slim
3-2 lead, with Stanford very much
in the ball game. Fred Lynn led
off the frame with a ground rule
double to rightfield. The
subsequent actions on the field
were mentioned by the Trojan
players after the game as the
psychological turning point of the
ball game.
Relief pitcher Tom Changnon,
pitching carefully to the heart of
the USC batting order, suddenly
whirled and threw to second base,
picking off the diving Lynn. Then,
turning to the Trojan bench,
which had razzed the Stanford
pitchers unmercifully the entire
game, Changnon allegedly made
an obscene gesture with his
throwing hand.
This gesture, the Trojan players
later reported, sparked the visiting
team at its lowest point of the
game, and the next inning USC
pushed over an insurance run that
proved the winning margin of the
game.
Each team scored in the eighth
inning. Rob Adolph doubled to
lead off the Trojan half, was
sacrificed to third base and then
scored on a single by Darrell
Arenstein. For Stanford, Mickey
Aguirre reached second on an
error by rightfielder Tim Steele
and scored on a subsequent single
by Mike Nelson.
In the ninth, the Trojans

threatened again, loading the
bases against Stanford reliever
Dave Frost. Frost was able to get
Rob Adolph to ground into a
force out at the plate and then
induced Tim Steele to bounce
back to the box.
Frustration
In their final display of
frustrating baseball, Stanford
entered the bottom of the ninth
one run down. Rod Boone led off
by striking out. Catcher Bob
Reece then singled to left, but
pinchhitter Bob Hampton popped
out to the second baseman. Mark
Lucich singled and the Cards had
runners on first and second with
two down. Dave Edson then hit a
slow ground ball to shortstop
which infielder Smalley caught in
full stride and then outraced
Lucich to second base to end the
game.
The opener of the Saturday
doubleheader was totally
Stanford's show. Demonstrating
the hustle that had definitely been
lacking in the first game, the
Cardinals exploded for five
unearned runs in the fourth inning
and four earned runs i* the sixth,
then rode home on the strong
pitching of Nick Peterson to
swamp Troy, 9-1.
Peterson pitched brilliantly
allowing only three hits in the
first five innings, before
surrendering a run on five hits in
the final two frames of the
seven-inning match. He struck out
six Trojans while walking only
one.
Offensively, the Cards made
the most of the seven hits allowed
by three USC pitchers. In the
fourth, Mark Lucich walked and
leftfielder Rod Boone reached
base on a fielder's choice, while
Lucich went to third on a
throwing error by the pitcher
Randy Scarberry. Bob Reece
singled for a run, but was forced
at second by Dave Edson. Kim
Hannaford drove home Boone
when he reached second base on a
throwing error by shortstop
Smalley. With runners at second
and third, pitcher Peterson helped
his own cause by singling home
the third run of the inning. One
out later, Tom Williams crashed a
triple off the rightfield fence,
driving in Hannaford and
Peterson.
Big Play
In the sixth inning, Rod Boone
and Bob Reece combined for one

of the outstanding defensive
performances of the season. With
runners at first and second and
one out, leftfielder Ken Huizenga
singled into the leftfield corner,
Boone in hot pursuit. Mike
Swiderski, who had pinchhit for
reliever Jeff Reinke, turned third
just as Boone grabbed the ball.
The throw and Swiderski raced to
the plate, with Boone's throw a
perfect strike along the foul line.
Reece crouched, blocking the
plate as he caught the ball, then
tagged out the surprised
Swiderski, killing the rally.
In the bottom of the inning,
Trojan pitcher Wayne Schrader
walked four of the first five
batters he faced. Third baseman
Jeff Port moved to the mound to
relieve, but before he could retire
the side, all the runners on base
had scored, as Stanford went on
to win 9-1.
The important factor of
momentum had definitely swung
in Stanford's direction, and they
started out the second game with
vengeance. In the first inning,
they bombed starter Russ
McQueen for four runs, three of
which were earned. Seven of the
first eight batters hit safely, as
Aguirre, Williams, Lucich, Boone,
and Edson all singled, sandwiching
a double play by Mike Nelson and
a triple by Tom Williams.
The next inning, the Cards
scored two unearned runs in the
second inning and added another
in the fourth, as it very much
appeared that USC would be
forced to return to Los Angeles in
order to clinch the divisional title.
Then, once again, a psychological

completely reversed its course,
and with the reversal went all of

In the sixth inning, the Trojans

Dan Shaw survived the inning,

when USC scored four more runs

Tim Steele reached secondbase
on a throwing error by Kim
Hannaford, allowing Lynn to
score. One out later, Darrell
Arenstein doubled home Steele
and was himself scored on a single
by Roy Smalley, tying the score.
Game Tied
In the bottom of the eighth,
Stanford wasted a one out single

by Mickey Aguirre. Reliever Mike
Higgins entered the top of the
ninth tied at 7-7, but with the
game moving very much in USC's
favor.
Relief pitcher Mark Sogge
grounded out to start the ninth,
but leftfielder Jeff Pederson

Arenstein was sacrificed to
second, went to third on a ground
out to shortstop and was singled

home by centerfielder Fred Lynn.
Troy added another tally in the
fourth when rightfielder Tim
Steele got aboard on a fielder's
choice and was driven home on a
single by Arenstein.
Greg Widman, the eventual
winning pitcher, hurled brilliantly
during the first five innings,
allowing only two hits. In
addition, he struck out seven
Cardinals in the first five frames.
In the sixth inning, the
momentum started to shift
towards Stanford. Bob DiPietro,
who had relatively poor control
for the first six innings, was taken
out of the game, and pinchhitter
Mark Lucich singled to
centerfield. Dave Edson then
walked and both runners moved
up on an infield out by third
baseman Mickey Aguirre.
Centerfielder Tom Williams
grounded to second, scoring
Lucich, and rightfielder Mike
Nelson singled home Edson.
SC Leads
Thus, entering the top of the
seventh inning, USC led by a slim
3-2 lead, with Stanford very much
in the ball game. Fred Lynn led
off the frame with a ground rule
double to rightfield. The
subsequent actions on the field
were mentioned by the Trojan
players after the game as the
psychological turning point of the
ball game.
Relief pitcher Tom Changnon,
pitching carefully to the heart of
the USC batting order, suddenly
whirled and threw to second base,
picking off the diving Lynn. Then,
turning to the Trojan bench,
which had razzed the Stanford
pitchers unmercifully the entire
game, Changnon allegedly made
an obscene gesture with his
throwing hand.
This gesture, the Trojan players
later reported, sparked the visiting
team at its lowest point of the
game, and the next inning USC
pushed over an insurance run that
proved the winning margin of the
game.
Each team scored in the eighth
inning. Rob Adolph doubled to
lead off the Trojan half, was
sacrificed to third base and then
scored on a single by Darrell
Arenstein. For Stanford, Mickey
Aguirre reached second on an
error by rightfielder Tim Steele
and scored on a subsequent single
by Mike Nelson.
In the ninth, the Trojans

threatened again, loading the
bases against Stanford reliever
Dave Frost. Frost was able to get
Rob Adolph to ground into a
force out at the plate and then
induced Tim Steele to bounce
back to the box.
Frustration
In their final display of
frustrating baseball, Stanford
entered the bottom of the ninth
one run down. Rod Boone led off
by striking out. Catcher Bob
Reece then singled to left, but
pinchhitter Bob Hampton popped
out to the second baseman. Mark
Lucich singled and the Cards had
runners on first and second with
two down. Dave Edson then hit a
slow ground ball to shortstop
which infielder Smalley caught in
full stride and then outraced
Lucich to second base to end the
game.
The opener of the Saturday
doubleheader was totally
Stanford's show. Demonstrating
the hustle that had definitely been
lacking in the first game, the
Cardinals exploded for five
unearned runs in the fourth inning
and four earned runs i* the sixth,
then rode home on the strong
pitching of Nick Peterson to
swamp Troy, 9-1.
Peterson pitched brilliantly
allowing only three hits in the
first five innings, before
surrendering a run on five hits in
the final two frames of the
seven-inning match. He struck out
six Trojans while walking only
one.
Offensively, the Cards made
the most of the seven hits allowed
by three USC pitchers. In the
fourth, Mark Lucich walked and
leftfielder Rod Boone reached
base on a fielder's choice, while
Lucich went to third on a
throwing error by the pitcher
Randy Scarberry. Bob Reece
singled for a run, but was forced
at second by Dave Edson. Kim
Hannaford drove home Boone
when he reached second base on a
throwing error by shortstop
Smalley. With runners at second
and third, pitcher Peterson helped
his own cause by singling home
the third run of the inning. One
out later, Tom Williams crashed a
triple off the rightfield fence,
driving in Hannaford and
Peterson.
Big Play
In the sixth inning, Rod Boone
and Bob Reece combined for one

of the outstanding defensive
performances of the season. With
runners at first and second and
one out, leftfielder Ken Huizenga
singled into the leftfield corner,
Boone in hot pursuit. Mike
Swiderski, who had pinchhit for
reliever Jeff Reinke, turned third
just as Boone grabbed the ball.
The throw and Swiderski raced to
the plate, with Boone's throw a
perfect strike along the foul line.
Reece crouched, blocking the
plate as he caught the ball, then
tagged out the surprised
Swiderski, killing the rally.
In the bottom of the inning,
Trojan pitcher Wayne Schrader
walked four of the first five
batters he faced. Third baseman
Jeff Port moved to the mound to
relieve, but before he could retire
the side, all the runners on base
had scored, as Stanford went on
to win 9-1.
The important factor of
momentum had definitely swung
in Stanford's direction, and they
started out the second game with
vengeance. In the first inning,
they bombed starter Russ
McQueen for four runs, three of
which were earned. Seven of the
first eight batters hit safely, as
Aguirre, Williams, Lucich, Boone,
and Edson all singled, sandwiching
a double play by Mike Nelson and
a triple by Tom Williams.
The next inning, the Cards
scored two unearned runs in the
second inning and added another
in the fourth, as it very much
appeared that USC would be
forced to return to Los Angeles in
order to clinch the divisional title.
Then, once again, a psychological
lift brought the flattened Trojans

back into the ball game, a game in
which their title-game experience
showed itself in the team's poise.
Stanford Ahead
With Stanford ahead 7-0, a
Stanford batter hit a harmless foul
ball down the firstbase line. The
ball was retrieved by a member of
the Stanford bullpen but was
tossed in the direction of the
infield where the USC players
stood. Despite a shouted warning,
first baseman Darrell Arenstein
was struck in the back of the leg
by the ball. This action, coming
two innings after a
throw by second baseman Milt
Guggia had cleared the Stanford
bench, was taken by the Trojans:
as retaliation. Once again, they
appeared to come alive. In the
remaining four innings, the game
completely reversed its course,
and with the reversal went all of
the Cardinals' hopes for the title.
In the sixth inning, the Trojans
converted a walk, a double and
two singles into three runs. Starter
Dan Shaw survived the inning,
then retired the side in order in
the seventh, but was driven from
the box in the top of the eighth
when USC scored four more runs
to tie the score. With one out,
third baseman Jeff Port doubled to
left and came home on a double
by centerfielder Fred Lynn.
Tim Steele reached secondbase
on a throwing error by Kim
Hannaford, allowing Lynn to
score. One out later, Darrell
Arenstein doubled home Steele
and was himself scored on a single
by Roy Smalley, tying the score.
Game Tied
In the bottom of the eighth,
Stanford wasted a one out single

by Mickey Aguirre. Reliever Mike
Higgins entered the top of the
ninth tied at 7-7, but with the
game moving very much in USC's
favor.
Relief pitcher Mark Sogge
grounded out to start the ninth,
but leftfielder Jeff Pederson
walked. Jeff Port popped out, but
then Higgins walked Fred Lynn
and loaded the bases on a single
by Tim Steele. Pitching carefully,
Higgins fell behind the Trojan
catcher Sam Ceci and finally
walked in what proved to be the
winning tally. Tom Changnon
came in to relieve, but gave up a
two-run producing single by
Darrell Arenstein to ice the game.
The stunned Stanford batters
went quietly in the bottom of the
ninth, as Sogge retired the side to
gain the victory in relief.
For the Trojans, three hitters
combined to. pace the series
victory. Centerfielder Fred Lynn
belted Stanford pitching during
the set at a .636 clip, cracking
three doubles, while scoring three
runs and driving in three more.
First baseman Darrell Arenstein
got five hits in eleven official at
bats. Arenstein was the big clutch
hitter for Southern Cal, driving in
five runs, while scoring two
himself. Finally, rightfielder Tim
Steele, who had a miserable series
against Stanford pitching in April,
responded at a .364 mark, leading
the third game comeback with
three runs scored.
Stanford also had several
hitters who batted well against the
Trojan staff. Much overshadowed
by the team significance of the
series, Bob Reece had perhaps his
finest series of the year as he

connected for eight hits in
thirteen trips to the plate for a
.615 mark. Reece, reaffirming his
position as the best clutch hitter
on the team, drove in four runs
and scored another, while playing
a masterful series behind the
plate. Centerfielder Tom Williams
and second baseman Dave Edson
each collected three hits, with
Williams driving in four runs for
the series.
Sad Weekend
Yet, in a larger sense, it is hard
to find anything bright in
Stanford's performance over the
weekend. Four weeks ago,
Stanford was in first place in the
nation. Now, they will have to
battle for second place in their
division.
Next weekend, the team will
not be playing for the
championship as it had planned,
but for its pride. Friday, Stanford
plays a single game against
California, before invading
Berkeley for a doubleheader on
Saturday.

SAFE OR OUT?â€”First baseman Mark Lucich (20) dives to tag a USC batter last Friday on Sunken Diamond. Lucich missed the batter as the
Trojans went on to win 4-3. The team finishes its season against Cal next weekend.
The Stanford baseball team
blew themselves out of contention
for the Pacific Eight Conference
Southern Division title this
weekend, as they lost two of three
to division-leading Southern
California.
Losing the opener of the series,
4-3, then splitting the Saturday
doubleheader, winning 9-1 in the
first game before blowing a
seven-run lead in the nightcap to
lose 10-7.
In a sense, the three games
typified much of the Cardinals'
conference season, a season that
could be termed as one of wasted
potential. In the first game, one of
six one-run games Stanford has
played in, the Cards left eight men
on base in the nine inning game.
The first game of the
doubleheader was a display of
Stanford's potential, as they made
the most of every offensive
opportunity, while receiving
brilliant pitching. The final
contest was one in which the
Cardinals built up a 7-0 lead after
five innings, only to see it
evaporate to a pressure-proof USC
ballclub.
The Trojans have now won the
Southern Division for the fifth
consecutive year, entering the
final weekend of the season with a
12-3 record. Stanford holds a
tenuous lead over California for
second place with a 8-7 mark to
the Bears' 7-8. UCLA brings up
â€¢the rear with a 3-12 record. USC
will await the outcome of the
Northern Division race between
Washington State and Oregon and
will play the winner for the
conference championship at
Bovard Field two weeks hence.
Trojans Take Lead
1 For Stanford, there is no one
to blame but themselves. In the
first game, the hustling Trojans
built up a 3-0 lead, scoring the
three runs on four hits and an
error. In the second inning,
catcher Sam Ceci singled to
rightfield, went to second on a
wild pitch, to third on an infield
out and rode home on a sacrifice
fly out by shortstop Rod Adolph.
In the third inning, first
baseman Darrell Arenstein got
aboard on an error by Stanford
second baseman Dave Edson.
Arenstein was sacrificed to
second, went to third on a ground
out to shortstop and was singled

home by centerfielder Fred Lynn.
Troy added another tally in the
fourth when rightfielder Tim
Steele got aboard on a fielder's
choice and was driven home on a
single by Arenstein.
Greg Widman, the eventual
winning pitcher, hurled brilliantly
during the first five innings,
allowing only two hits. In
addition, he struck out seven
Cardinals in the first five frames.
In the sixth inning, the
momentum started to shift
towards Stanford. Bob DiPietro,
who had relatively poor control
for the first six innings, was taken
out of the game, and pinchhitter
Mark Lucich singled to
centerfield. Dave Edson then
walked and both runners moved
up on an infield out by third
baseman Mickey Aguirre.
Centerfielder Tom Williams
grounded to second, scoring
Lucich, and rightfielder Mike
Nelson singled home Edson.

score. One out later, Darrell
Arenstein doubled home Steele
and was himself scored on a single
by Roy Smalley, tying the score.
Game Tied
In the bottom of the eighth,
Stanford wasted a one out single

by Mickey Aguirre. Reliever Mike
Higgins entered the top of the
ninth tied at 7-7, but with the
game moving very much in USC's
favor.
Relief pitcher Mark Sogge
grounded out to start the ninth,
but leftfielder Jeff Pederson
walked. Jeff Port popped out, but
then Higgins walked Fred Lynn
and loaded the bases on a single
by Tim Steele. Pitching carefully,
Higgins fell behind the Trojan
catcher Sam Ceci and finally
walked in what proved to be the
winning tally. Tom Changnon
came in to relieve, but gave up a
two-run producing single by
Darrell Arenstein to ice the game.
The stunned Stanford batters
went quietly in the bottom of the
ninth, as Sogge retired the side to
gain the victory in relief.
For the Trojans, three hitters
combined to. pace the series
victory. Centerfielder Fred Lynn
belted Stanford pitching during
the set at a .636 clip, cracking
three doubles, while scoring three
runs and driving in three more.
First baseman Darrell Arenstein
got five hits in eleven official at
bats. Arenstein was the big clutch
hitter for Southern Cal, driving in
five runs, while scoring two
himself. Finally, rightfielder Tim
Steele, who had a miserable series
against Stanford pitching in April,
responded at a .364 mark, leading
the third game comeback with
three runs scored.
Stanford also had several
hitters who batted well against the
Trojan staff. Much overshadowed
by the team significance of the
series, Bob Reece had perhaps his
finest series of the year as he

connected for eight hits in
thirteen trips to the plate for a
.615 mark. Reece, reaffirming his
position as the best clutch hitter
on the team, drove in four runs
and scored another, while playing
a masterful series behind the
plate. Centerfielder Tom Williams
and second baseman Dave Edson
each collected three hits, with
Williams driving in four runs for
the series.
Sad Weekend
Yet, in a larger sense, it is hard
to find anything bright in
Stanford's performance over the
weekend. Four weeks ago,
Stanford was in first place in the
nation. Now, they will have to
battle for second place in their
division.
Next weekend, the team will
not be playing for the
championship as it had planned,
but for its pride. Friday, Stanford
plays a single game against
California, before invading
Berkeley for a doubleheader on
Saturday.

SAFE OR OUT?â€”First baseman Mark Lucich (20) dives to tag a USC batter last Friday on Sunken Diamond. Lucich missed the batter as the
Trojans went on to win 4-3. The team finishes its season against Cal next weekend.
The Stanford baseball team
blew themselves out of contention
for the Pacific Eight Conference
Southern Division title this
weekend, as they lost two of three
to division-leading Southern
California.
Losing the opener of the series,
4-3, then splitting the Saturday
doubleheader, winning 9-1 in the
first game before blowing a
seven-run lead in the nightcap to
lose 10-7.
In a sense, the three games
typified much of the Cardinals'
conference season, a season that
could be termed as one of wasted
potential. In the first game, one of
six one-run games Stanford has
played in, the Cards left eight men
on base in the nine inning game.
The first game of the
doubleheader was a display of
Stanford's potential, as they made
the most of every offensive
opportunity, while receiving
brilliant pitching. The final
contest was one in which the
Cardinals built up a 7-0 lead after
five innings, only to see it
evaporate to a pressure-proof USC
ballclub.
The Trojans have now won the
Southern Division for the fifth
consecutive year, entering the
final weekend of the season with a
12-3 record. Stanford holds a
tenuous lead over California for
second place with a 8-7 mark to
the Bears' 7-8. UCLA brings up
â€¢the rear with a 3-12 record. USC
will await the outcome of the
Northern Division race between
Washington State and Oregon and
will play the winner for the
conference championship at
Bovard Field two weeks hence.
Trojans Take Lead
1 For Stanford, there is no one
to blame but themselves. In the
first game, the hustling Trojans
built up a 3-0 lead, scoring the
three runs on four hits and an
error. In the second inning,
catcher Sam Ceci singled to
rightfield, went to second on a
wild pitch, to third on an infield
out and rode home on a sacrifice
fly out by shortstop Rod Adolph.
In the third inning, first
baseman Darrell Arenstein got
aboard on an error by Stanford
second baseman Dave Edson.
Arenstein was sacrificed to
second, went to third on a ground
out to shortstop and was singled

home by centerfielder Fred Lynn.
Troy added another tally in the
fourth when rightfielder Tim
Steele got aboard on a fielder's
choice and was driven home on a
single by Arenstein.
Greg Widman, the eventual
winning pitcher, hurled brilliantly
during the first five innings,
allowing only two hits. In
addition, he struck out seven
Cardinals in the first five frames.
In the sixth inning, the
momentum started to shift
towards Stanford. Bob DiPietro,
who had relatively poor control
for the first six innings, was taken
out of the game, and pinchhitter
Mark Lucich singled to
centerfield. Dave Edson then
walked and both runners moved
up on an infield out by third
baseman Mickey Aguirre.
Centerfielder Tom Williams
grounded to second, scoring
Lucich, and rightfielder Mike
Nelson singled home Edson.
SC Leads
Thus, entering the top of the
seventh inning, USC led by a slim
3-2 lead, with Stanford very much
in the ball game. Fred Lynn led
off the frame with a ground rule
double to rightfield. The
subsequent actions on the field
were mentioned by the Trojan
players after the game as the
psychological turning point of the
ball game.
Relief pitcher Tom Changnon,
pitching carefully to the heart of
the USC batting order, suddenly
whirled and threw to second base,
picking off the diving Lynn. Then,
turning to the Trojan bench,
which had razzed the Stanford
pitchers unmercifully the entire
game, Changnon allegedly made
an obscene gesture with his
throwing hand.
This gesture, the Trojan players
later reported, sparked the visiting
team at its lowest point of the
game, and the next inning USC
pushed over an insurance run that
proved the winning margin of the
game.
Each team scored in the eighth
inning. Rob Adolph doubled to
lead off the Trojan half, was
sacrificed to third base and then
scored on a single by Darrell
Arenstein. For Stanford, Mickey
Aguirre reached second on an
error by rightfielder Tim Steele
and scored on a subsequent single
by Mike Nelson.
In the ninth, the Trojans

threatened again, loading the
bases against Stanford reliever
Dave Frost. Frost was able to get
Rob Adolph to ground into a
force out at the plate and then
induced Tim Steele to bounce
back to the box.
Frustration
In their final display of
frustrating baseball, Stanford
entered the bottom of the ninth
one run down. Rod Boone led off
by striking out. Catcher Bob
Reece then singled to left, but
pinchhitter Bob Hampton popped
out to the second baseman. Mark
Lucich singled and the Cards had
runners on first and second with
two down. Dave Edson then hit a
slow ground ball to shortstop
which infielder Smalley caught in
full stride and then outraced
Lucich to second base to end the
game.
The opener of the Saturday
doubleheader was totally
Stanford's show. Demonstrating
the hustle that had definitely been
lacking in the first game, the
Cardinals exploded for five
unearned runs in the fourth inning
and four earned runs i* the sixth,
then rode home on the strong
pitching of Nick Peterson to
swamp Troy, 9-1.
Peterson pitched brilliantly
allowing only three hits in the
first five innings, before
surrendering a run on five hits in
the final two frames of the
seven-inning match. He struck out
six Trojans while walking only
one.
Offensively, the Cards made
the most of the seven hits allowed
by three USC pitchers. In the
fourth, Mark Lucich walked and
leftfielder Rod Boone reached
base on a fielder's choice, while
Lucich went to third on a
throwing error by the pitcher
Randy Scarberry. Bob Reece
singled for a run, but was forced
at second by Dave Edson. Kim
Hannaford drove home Boone
when he reached second base on a
throwing error by shortstop
Smalley. With runners at second
and third, pitcher Peterson helped
his own cause by singling home
the third run of the inning. One
out later, Tom Williams crashed a
triple off the rightfield fence,
driving in Hannaford and
Peterson.
Big Play
In the sixth inning, Rod Boone
and Bob Reece combined for one

of the outstanding defensive
performances of the season. With
runners at first and second and
one out, leftfielder Ken Huizenga
singled into the leftfield corner,
Boone in hot pursuit. Mike
Swiderski, who had pinchhit for
reliever Jeff Reinke, turned third
just as Boone grabbed the ball.
The throw and Swiderski raced to
the plate, with Boone's throw a
perfect strike along the foul line.
Reece crouched, blocking the
plate as he caught the ball, then
tagged out the surprised
Swiderski, killing the rally.
In the bottom of the inning,
Trojan pitcher Wayne Schrader
walked four of the first five
batters he faced. Third baseman
Jeff Port moved to the mound to
relieve, but before he could retire
the side, all the runners on base
had scored, as Stanford went on
to win 9-1.
The important factor of
momentum had definitely swung
in Stanford's direction, and they
started out the second game with
vengeance. In the first inning,
they bombed starter Russ
McQueen for four runs, three of
which were earned. Seven of the
first eight batters hit safely, as
Aguirre, Williams, Lucich, Boone,
and Edson all singled, sandwiching
a double play by Mike Nelson and
a triple by Tom Williams.
The next inning, the Cards
scored two unearned runs in the
second inning and added another
in the fourth, as it very much
appeared that USC would be
forced to return to Los Angeles in
order to clinch the divisional title.
Then, once again, a psychological
lift brought the flattened Trojans

back into the ball game, a game in
which their title-game experience
showed itself in the team's poise.
Stanford Ahead
With Stanford ahead 7-0, a
Stanford batter hit a harmless foul
ball down the firstbase line. The
ball was retrieved by a member of
the Stanford bullpen but was
tossed in the direction of the
infield where the USC players
stood. Despite a shouted warning,
first baseman Darrell Arenstein
was struck in the back of the leg
by the ball. This action, coming
two innings after a
throw by second baseman Milt
Guggia had cleared the Stanford
bench, was taken by the Trojans:
as retaliation. Once again, they
appeared to come alive. In the
remaining four innings, the game
completely reversed its course,
and with the reversal went all of
the Cardinals' hopes for the title.
In the sixth inning, the Trojans
converted a walk, a double and
two singles into three runs. Starter
Dan Shaw survived the inning,
then retired the side in order in
the seventh, but was driven from
the box in the top of the eighth
when USC scored four more runs
to tie the score. With one out,
third baseman Jeff Port doubled to
left and came home on a double
by centerfielder Fred Lynn.
Tim Steele reached secondbase
on a throwing error by Kim
Hannaford, allowing Lynn to
score. One out later, Darrell
Arenstein doubled home Steele
and was himself scored on a single
by Roy Smalley, tying the score.
Game Tied
In the bottom of the eighth,
Stanford wasted a one out single

by Mickey Aguirre. Reliever Mike
Higgins entered the top of the
ninth tied at 7-7, but with the
game moving very much in USC's
favor.
Relief pitcher Mark Sogge
grounded out to start the ninth,
but leftfielder Jeff Pederson
walked. Jeff Port popped out, but
then Higgins walked Fred Lynn
and loaded the bases on a single
by Tim Steele. Pitching carefully,
Higgins fell behind the Trojan
catcher Sam Ceci and finally
walked in what proved to be the
winning tally. Tom Changnon

two-run producing single by

In the ninth, the Trojans

threatened again, loading the
bases against Stanford reliever
Dave Frost. Frost was able to get
Rob Adolph to ground into a
force out at the plate and then
induced Tim Steele to bounce
back to the box.
Frustration
In their final display of
frustrating baseball, Stanford
entered the bottom of the ninth
one run down. Rod Boone led off
by striking out. Catcher Bob
Reece then singled to left, but
pinchhitter Bob Hampton popped
out to the second baseman. Mark
Lucich singled and the Cards had
runners on first and second with
two down. Dave Edson then hit a
slow ground ball to shortstop
which infielder Smalley caught in
full stride and then outraced
Lucich to second base to end the
game.
The opener of the Saturday
doubleheader was totally
Stanford's show. Demonstrating
the hustle that had definitely been
lacking in the first game, the
Cardinals exploded for five
unearned runs in the fourth inning
and four earned runs i* the sixth,
then rode home on the strong
pitching of Nick Peterson to
swamp Troy, 9-1.
Peterson pitched brilliantly
allowing only three hits in the
first five innings, before
surrendering a run on five hits in
the final two frames of the
seven-inning match. He struck out
six Trojans while walking only
one.
Offensively, the Cards made
the most of the seven hits allowed
by three USC pitchers. In the
fourth, Mark Lucich walked and
leftfielder Rod Boone reached
base on a fielder's choice, while
Lucich went to third on a
throwing error by the pitcher
Randy Scarberry. Bob Reece
singled for a run, but was forced
at second by Dave Edson. Kim
Hannaford drove home Boone
when he reached second base on a
throwing error by shortstop
Smalley. With runners at second
and third, pitcher Peterson helped
his own cause by singling home
the third run of the inning. One
out later, Tom Williams crashed a
triple off the rightfield fence,
driving in Hannaford and
Peterson.
Big Play
In the sixth inning, Rod Boone
and Bob Reece combined for one

of the outstanding defensive
performances of the season. With
runners at first and second and
one out, leftfielder Ken Huizenga
singled into the leftfield corner,
Boone in hot pursuit. Mike
Swiderski, who had pinchhit for
reliever Jeff Reinke, turned third
just as Boone grabbed the ball.
The throw and Swiderski raced to
the plate, with Boone's throw a
perfect strike along the foul line.
Reece crouched, blocking the
plate as he caught the ball, then
tagged out the surprised
Swiderski, killing the rally.
In the bottom of the inning,
Trojan pitcher Wayne Schrader
walked four of the first five
batters he faced. Third baseman
Jeff Port moved to the mound to
relieve, but before he could retire
the side, all the runners on base
had scored, as Stanford went on
to win 9-1.
The important factor of
momentum had definitely swung
in Stanford's direction, and they
started out the second game with
vengeance. In the first inning,
they bombed starter Russ
McQueen for four runs, three of
which were earned. Seven of the
first eight batters hit safely, as
Aguirre, Williams, Lucich, Boone,
and Edson all singled, sandwiching
a double play by Mike Nelson and
a triple by Tom Williams.
The next inning, the Cards
scored two unearned runs in the
second inning and added another
in the fourth, as it very much
appeared that USC would be
forced to return to Los Angeles in
order to clinch the divisional title.
Then, once again, a psychological
lift brought the flattened Trojans

back into the ball game, a game in
which their title-game experience
showed itself in the team's poise.
Stanford Ahead
With Stanford ahead 7-0, a
Stanford batter hit a harmless foul
ball down the firstbase line. The
ball was retrieved by a member of
the Stanford bullpen but was
tossed in the direction of the
infield where the USC players
stood. Despite a shouted warning,
first baseman Darrell Arenstein
was struck in the back of the leg
by the ball. This action, coming
two innings after a
throw by second baseman Milt
Guggia had cleared the Stanford
bench, was taken by the Trojans:
as retaliation. Once again, they
appeared to come alive. In the
remaining four innings, the game
completely reversed its course,
and with the reversal went all of
the Cardinals' hopes for the title.
In the sixth inning, the Trojans
converted a walk, a double and
two singles into three runs. Starter
Dan Shaw survived the inning,
then retired the side in order in
the seventh, but was driven from
the box in the top of the eighth
when USC scored four more runs
to tie the score. With one out,
third baseman Jeff Port doubled to
left and came home on a double
by centerfielder Fred Lynn.
Tim Steele reached secondbase
on a throwing error by Kim
Hannaford, allowing Lynn to
score. One out later, Darrell
Arenstein doubled home Steele
and was himself scored on a single
by Roy Smalley, tying the score.
Game Tied
In the bottom of the eighth,
Stanford wasted a one out single

by Mickey Aguirre. Reliever Mike
Higgins entered the top of the
ninth tied at 7-7, but with the
game moving very much in USC's
favor.
Relief pitcher Mark Sogge
grounded out to start the ninth,
but leftfielder Jeff Pederson
walked. Jeff Port popped out, but
then Higgins walked Fred Lynn
and loaded the bases on a single
by Tim Steele. Pitching carefully,
Higgins fell behind the Trojan
catcher Sam Ceci and finally
walked in what proved to be the
winning tally. Tom Changnon
came in to relieve, but gave up a
two-run producing single by
Darrell Arenstein to ice the game.
The stunned Stanford batters
went quietly in the bottom of the
ninth, as Sogge retired the side to
gain the victory in relief.
For the Trojans, three hitters
combined to. pace the series
victory. Centerfielder Fred Lynn
belted Stanford pitching during
the set at a .636 clip, cracking
three doubles, while scoring three
runs and driving in three more.
First baseman Darrell Arenstein
got five hits in eleven official at
bats. Arenstein was the big clutch
hitter for Southern Cal, driving in
five runs, while scoring two
himself. Finally, rightfielder Tim
Steele, who had a miserable series
against Stanford pitching in April,
responded at a .364 mark, leading
the third game comeback with
three runs scored.
Stanford also had several
hitters who batted well against the
Trojan staff. Much overshadowed
by the team significance of the
series, Bob Reece had perhaps his
finest series of the year as he

connected for eight hits in
thirteen trips to the plate for a
.615 mark. Reece, reaffirming his
position as the best clutch hitter
on the team, drove in four runs
and scored another, while playing
a masterful series behind the
plate. Centerfielder Tom Williams
and second baseman Dave Edson
each collected three hits, with
Williams driving in four runs for
the series.
Sad Weekend
Yet, in a larger sense, it is hard
to find anything bright in
Stanford's performance over the
weekend. Four weeks ago,
Stanford was in first place in the
nation. Now, they will have to
battle for second place in their
division.
Next weekend, the team will
not be playing for the
championship as it had planned,
but for its pride. Friday, Stanford
plays a single game against
California, before invading
Berkeley for a doubleheader on
Saturday.

SAFE OR OUT?â€”First baseman Mark Lucich (20) dives to tag a USC batter last Friday on Sunken Diamond. Lucich missed the batter as the
Trojans went on to win 4-3. The team finishes its season against Cal next weekend.
The Stanford baseball team
blew themselves out of contention
for the Pacific Eight Conference
Southern Division title this
weekend, as they lost two of three
to division-leading Southern
California.
Losing the opener of the series,
4-3, then splitting the Saturday
doubleheader, winning 9-1 in the
first game before blowing a
seven-run lead in the nightcap to
lose 10-7.
In a sense, the three games
typified much of the Cardinals'
conference season, a season that
could be termed as one of wasted
potential. In the first game, one of
six one-run games Stanford has
played in, the Cards left eight men
on base in the nine inning game.
The first game of the
doubleheader was a display of
Stanford's potential, as they made
the most of every offensive
opportunity, while receiving
brilliant pitching. The final
contest was one in which the
Cardinals built up a 7-0 lead after
five innings, only to see it
evaporate to a pressure-proof USC
ballclub.
The Trojans have now won the
Southern Division for the fifth
consecutive year, entering the
final weekend of the season with a
12-3 record. Stanford holds a
tenuous lead over California for
second place with a 8-7 mark to
the Bears' 7-8. UCLA brings up
â€¢the rear with a 3-12 record. USC
will await the outcome of the
Northern Division race between
Washington State and Oregon and
will play the winner for the
conference championship at
Bovard Field two weeks hence.
Trojans Take Lead
1 For Stanford, there is no one
to blame but themselves. In the
first game, the hustling Trojans
built up a 3-0 lead, scoring the
three runs on four hits and an
error. In the second inning,
catcher Sam Ceci singled to
rightfield, went to second on a
wild pitch, to third on an infield
out and rode home on a sacrifice
fly out by shortstop Rod Adolph.
In the third inning, first
baseman Darrell Arenstein got
aboard on an error by Stanford
second baseman Dave Edson.
Arenstein was sacrificed to
second, went to third on a ground
out to shortstop and was singled

home by centerfielder Fred Lynn.
Troy added another tally in the
fourth when rightfielder Tim
Steele got aboard on a fielder's
choice and was driven home on a
single by Arenstein.
Greg Widman, the eventual
winning pitcher, hurled brilliantly
during the first five innings,
allowing only two hits. In
addition, he struck out seven
Cardinals in the first five frames.
In the sixth inning, the
momentum started to shift
towards Stanford. Bob DiPietro,
who had relatively poor control
for the first six innings, was taken
out of the game, and pinchhitter
Mark Lucich singled to
centerfield. Dave Edson then
walked and both runners moved
up on an infield out by third
baseman Mickey Aguirre.
Centerfielder Tom Williams
grounded to second, scoring
Lucich, and rightfielder Mike
Nelson singled home Edson.
SC Leads
Thus, entering the top of the
seventh inning, USC led by a slim
3-2 lead, with Stanford very much
in the ball game. Fred Lynn led
off the frame with a ground rule
double to rightfield. The
subsequent actions on the field
were mentioned by the Trojan
players after the game as the
psychological turning point of the
ball game.
Relief pitcher Tom Changnon,
pitching carefully to the heart of
the USC batting order, suddenly
whirled and threw to second base,
picking off the diving Lynn. Then,
turning to the Trojan bench,
which had razzed the Stanford
pitchers unmercifully the entire
game, Changnon allegedly made
an obscene gesture with his
throwing hand.
This gesture, the Trojan players
later reported, sparked the visiting
team at its lowest point of the
game, and the next inning USC
pushed over an insurance run that
proved the winning margin of the
game.
Each team scored in the eighth
inning. Rob Adolph doubled to
lead off the Trojan half, was
sacrificed to third base and then
scored on a single by Darrell
Arenstein. For Stanford, Mickey
Aguirre reached second on an
error by rightfielder Tim Steele
and scored on a subsequent single
by Mike Nelson.
In the ninth, the Trojans

threatened again, loading the
bases against Stanford reliever
Dave Frost. Frost was able to get
Rob Adolph to ground into a
force out at the plate and then
induced Tim Steele to bounce
back to the box.
Frustration
In their final display of
frustrating baseball, Stanford
entered the bottom of the ninth

pinchhitter Bob Hampton popped

Yet, in a larger sense, it is hard
to find anything bright in
Stanford's performance over the
weekend. Four weeks ago,
Stanford was in first place in the
nation. Now, they will have to
battle for second place in their
division.
Next weekend, the team will
not be playing for the
championship as it had planned,
but for its pride. Friday, Stanford
plays a single game against
California, before invading
Berkeley for a doubleheader on
Saturday.

SAFE OR OUT?â€”First baseman Mark Lucich (20) dives to tag a USC batter last Friday on Sunken Diamond. Lucich missed the batter as the
Trojans went on to win 4-3. The team finishes its season against Cal next weekend.
