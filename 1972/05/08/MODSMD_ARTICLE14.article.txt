# Cal State Tourney
## Mayer Wins Net Title 
### DAVID ANTONUCCIO 
The Stanford tennis team may
have been spread a little thin this
last week but it didn't seem to
matter as the Card racketmen
emerged with a decisive 7-2
victory over Cal while also
dominating the California State
Championships.
At Alpine Hills Tennis and
Swimming Club, the scene of the
Cal State Tourney, a big surprise
came on Sunday afternoon when
Stanford netman Sandy Mayer
upended his teammate and high
man on the Stanford ladder,
Roscoe Tanner, who was
top-seeded in the tournament. His
6-4, 7-5, 6-2 win (best of five)
allowed Mayer to reign as the
singles champ, his second such
victory in a row.
Brenda Garcia defeated Kate
Latham, top seed, to claim the
women's singles finale. Miss
Lathari teamed with Cathie
Anderson to down Arline Cohen
and Donna Balchois. Mayer and
Tanner had lots of trouble with
the duo of Whitney Reed and
Dick Knight, who reached the
finals by dumping another
Stanford pair, Jim Delaney and
Chico Hagey. Mayer and Tanner
finally won in the fifth set, 6-4.
The all Stanford final singles

match climaxed a week of
qualifying and eliminations that
saw Mayer add his triumph over
Tanner to impressive wins over
Utah's F.D. Robbins and Dick
Knight of Seattle. Robbins had
previously defeated Mayer in the
National Amateur Indoor
Tourney in Salt Lake, and Sandy
gained a little confidence along
with his revenge.
Coach Dick Gould commented,
"Sandy's win over Roscoe will
give him a lot of confidence
because there is no player any
better than Roscoe Tanner.
Confidence is important in tennis.
Sandy has rarely had a bad loss,
but sometimes you need a big win
like this as a shot in the arm. His
win in the Ojai Tourney and his
victories over Tanner and Robbins
are certainly a tribute to Sandy
Mayer. Sandy realizes he can beat
anyone now."
The last Stanford victor at Cal
State was Fred Schroeder, former
1942 NCAA champ.
"Mayer will get a good seeding
at the national championships and
that will help us as a team as well
as Sandy," added Gould.
The battle between Roscoe
Tanner and Sandy Mayer took
place only on the court and their
remarks at the distribution of
awards was indicative of the
sportsmanship and team spirit
displayed year round by these two
fine representatives of Stanford
tennis.
Upon receiving his award,
presented by his father, Mayer
praised his teammate saying, "I
don't want you to be surprised
when you see Roscoe playing
number one, because he is
Stanford's number one player. He
just had a bad loss today."
Roscoe returned the
compliment as he accepted the
second place trophy. "I didn't
have a bad loss. I wish he'd realize
that he's a better player than he
thinks he is." Tanner proceeded
to thank everyone and expressed
his feeling about the NCAA
Championships. "I'm looking
forward to the NCAA and I think
Stanford is gonna win it."
Reflecting on the tournament,
Coach Gould said, "After coming
off an emotional win in Ojai we
got back about 3 a.m. Monday
morning. Fortunately none of our
men had to play before
Wednesday. It's been tough to
stay up mentally for the past
three weeks because of the great
pressure matches we've been in,
like SC, UCLA, and Ojai. But
we've done nothing but look
better and better. Everytime a
pressure situation has arisen, as a
team we've come through.

Certainly this will make Trinity
think a little. You can't be a
championship team unless you
can play under pressure and keep
team unity. We've worked well
together in spite of the individual
competition on the team.
"We still need lots of work but
with 10 days of practice we
should hit the Pac-8 about right."
Gould was generally pleased
with his team's performance,
especially the brilliant play of
Sandy Mayer and Freshman Jim
Delaney.
Delaney, who wasn't seeded,
progressed to the semi-finals
before bowing to Roscoe Tanner
in three sets. Delaney had
recorded upsets over Whitney
Reed and third seed Allen Fox. As
Stanford's number four man,
Delaney has improved steadily
and has been bringing pressure to
bear on another freshman
standout, Chico Hagey, number
three for the Cards.
Gould said he was not pleased
with the performance of his
doubles teams in the tournament.
"We need a lot of work in doubles
although Rick Fisher and Gery
Groslimond have been playing
well. The doubles will be critical
in the NCAA. Roscoe and Sandy
have been a great team together in
the past but not here. I have
complete confidence that they'll
be sharp for the NCAA. Fisher
and Groslimond will get a good
seeding which will also help us."
The coach was not worried
about Tanner at all. "Roscoe
perhaps is not at the peak of his
game. He was at a similar stage
last year, then he settled down
and worked double hard. By the
NCAA's he was at razor pitch.
Hell be ready this year also."
Stanford's victory over
Berkeley on Saturday went
unnoticed in the shadow of the
Cal State Tournament, but never
the less, it was significant.
Chico Hagey fell in the number
one spot to Cal's Steve Stefanki.
Singles victories were recorded by
Rick Fisher, Gery Groslimond,
Chip Fisher, Paul Sidone, and Tim
Noonan. Winning doubles
combinations were R.
Fisher-Groslimond and John
Wright-Noonan. Seniors Mac
Claflin and Rick Evans
surrendered to Steve Bartlett and
Steve Prouix.
"I was pleased that we won it
in the singles. I was pleased also
that three seniors [Wright, Claflin,
Evans] were able to play the last
match of the season. Cal had me
worried because they are a fine
team" commented Gould.
