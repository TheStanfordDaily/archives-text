### PHIL HUBBARD 
The predicted close meet between Stanford
and Cal never came off as the Golden Bears
turned it into a rout, 92-53.
The sun refused to shine, and a cold wind
blew across the field. All in all it was a rotten
day for a track meet, especially the final dual
of the season. The loss finished Stanford's
schedule of duals with a 3-3 record.
Things got off to a bad start in the first
three events. Cal swept the shot led by Jim
Penrose's SS'lO'/i" put. Tom Anderson was
the early leader in the long jump, but was
nosed out in the finals by Craig Conway who
won the event for Cal with a 24'1W leap. His
teammate Julian Lucas took third. In the 440
relay Sammy Burns fought off Ken Curl along
the final straightaway to win it for Cal with
both teams timed in 41.9.
Berkeley Ahead
The relay put Berkeley ahead 20-3, and
Stanford never came close enough the rest of
the day to pose a serious threat to their
dominance.
Due to the weather, there were few
outstanding marks in the meet. Rick Brown
had his best half mile of the season with a
1:49.8. He finished the year undefeated in

that event. Cal's Ed Otter set the only meet
record as he led a sweep of the pole vault at
16'5 l / 2". Craig Conway would have had
another record had the wind not been blowing
too hard. His 51 '6V2" triple jump was
disallowed as a record because of the aiding
wind.
The rest of the events were dominated by
Cal, but the winning marks were not as good
as the past few weeks. The first four places in
the high jump were decided on fewer misses at
6'6". MacFarlane and Fishbaugh were 1-3 for
Cal and Anderson and Grodahl were 2-4 for
Stanford. Jim Howard got off a 169'7" throw
in the discus, but still managed only third
behind Jim Penrose and Chris Adams.
The marks in the javelin were mediocre.
Bruce Kennedy won the event for Cal at
225'2". Steve Hopkins and Rick Larson were
2-3 for Stanford. In the triple jump, Rod
Utley was leading at 49'5" until Conway's
windy bVGVz" leap on his final jump.
The high point of the meet for Stanford
was a 1-2 finish in the 100. Ken Curl won in
9.8, and Bob Barmeyer just nosed out J.D.
Smith to take second in 10.0. In the 220, Curl
beat Chuck Bommarito with both timed in
21.8.

In the high hurdles Dave Bagshaw broke
the tape at "* 4.5. Brosius was second for Cal at
14.7. Brosius came back to win the
intermediates, with Tom Long and Mark
Haight 2-3 for Stanford. Arvid Kretz did his
thing in the two mile, winning in 9:05.8. Cliff
West took the mile for Cal in 4:07.6. Brian
Mittelstaedt and Les McFadden were second
and third for Stanford.
John Anderson came up with another win
in the 440 with a 48.1. Rod Madison was
second for Cal at 48.7, and John Kessel nosed
out Bonner of Cal for third at 48.9. By the
time the mile relay came, the outcome of the
meet had long since been decided.
Nevertheless, John Kessel put in a speedy 47.4
leg to put Stanford in front for the second
half of the race. In the final leg, however, a
tired John Anderson couldn't catch Rick
Brown, and Cal won with a season's best of
3:13.2.
Stanford and Cal meet again next week at
the West Coast Relays, hopefully with better
weather. The week after that they face the
rest of the conference in the Pac-8
Championships here, so the team has two
more chances this season to get even for
Saturday's loss.

in the 440 with a 48.1. Rod Madison was
second for Cal at 48.7, and John Kessel nosed
out Bonner of Cal for third at 48.9. By the
time the mile relay came, the outcome of the
meet had long since been decided.
Nevertheless, John Kessel put in a speedy 47.4
leg to put Stanford in front for the second
half of the race. In the final leg, however, a
tired John Anderson couldn't catch Rick
Brown, and Cal won with a season's best of
3:13.2.
Stanford and Cal meet again next week at
the West Coast Relays, hopefully with better
weather. The week after that they face the
rest of the conference in the Pac-8
Championships here, so the team has two
more chances this season to get even for
Saturday's loss.
The predicted close meet between Stanford
and Cal never came off as the Golden Bears
turned it into a rout, 92-53.
The sun refused to shine, and a cold wind
blew across the field. All in all it was a rotten
day for a track meet, especially the final dual
of the season. The loss finished Stanford's
schedule of duals with a 3-3 record.
Things got off to a bad start in the first
three events. Cal swept the shot led by Jim
Penrose's SS'lO'/i" put. Tom Anderson was
the early leader in the long jump, but was
nosed out in the finals by Craig Conway who
won the event for Cal with a 24'1W leap. His
teammate Julian Lucas took third. In the 440
relay Sammy Burns fought off Ken Curl along
the final straightaway to win it for Cal with
both teams timed in 41.9.
Berkeley Ahead
The relay put Berkeley ahead 20-3, and
Stanford never came close enough the rest of
the day to pose a serious threat to their
dominance.
Due to the weather, there were few
outstanding marks in the meet. Rick Brown
had his best half mile of the season with a
1:49.8. He finished the year undefeated in

that event. Cal's Ed Otter set the only meet
record as he led a sweep of the pole vault at
16'5 l / 2". Craig Conway would have had
another record had the wind not been blowing
too hard. His 51 '6V2" triple jump was
disallowed as a record because of the aiding
wind.
The rest of the events were dominated by
Cal, but the winning marks were not as good
as the past few weeks. The first four places in
the high jump were decided on fewer misses at
6'6". MacFarlane and Fishbaugh were 1-3 for
Cal and Anderson and Grodahl were 2-4 for
Stanford. Jim Howard got off a 169'7" throw
in the discus, but still managed only third
behind Jim Penrose and Chris Adams.
The marks in the javelin were mediocre.
Bruce Kennedy won the event for Cal at
225'2". Steve Hopkins and Rick Larson were
2-3 for Stanford. In the triple jump, Rod
Utley was leading at 49'5" until Conway's
windy bVGVz" leap on his final jump.
The high point of the meet for Stanford
was a 1-2 finish in the 100. Ken Curl won in
9.8, and Bob Barmeyer just nosed out J.D.
Smith to take second in 10.0. In the 220, Curl
beat Chuck Bommarito with both timed in
21.8.

In the high hurdles Dave Bagshaw broke
the tape at "* 4.5. Brosius was second for Cal at
14.7. Brosius came back to win the
intermediates, with Tom Long and Mark
Haight 2-3 for Stanford. Arvid Kretz did his
thing in the two mile, winning in 9:05.8. Cliff
West took the mile for Cal in 4:07.6. Brian
Mittelstaedt and Les McFadden were second
and third for Stanford.
John Anderson came up with another win
in the 440 with a 48.1. Rod Madison was
second for Cal at 48.7, and John Kessel nosed
out Bonner of Cal for third at 48.9. By the
time the mile relay came, the outcome of the
meet had long since been decided.
