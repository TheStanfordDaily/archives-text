# Whites Defeat Reds In Scrimmage
## 
### STAN WILSON 
In a game dominated by what
most Stanford football fans have
come to expect, Saturday's
Red-White scrimmage was an
aerial display, and the strong
passing arms of quarterbacks Mike
Boryla and Dave Ottmar should
elicit a great deal of optimism for
the 1972 season. Ottmar, along
with elusive running back John
Winesberry, led the White team to
an impressive 24-20 win over the
Reds.
Ottmar completed 18 of 24
attempts, for 149 yards and one
touchdown. Ottmar, a 6-3, 210
pound transfer from Gavilan
Junior College, also punted for
both sides, and got off several fine
efforts. Boryla, meanwhile,
connected on 20 of 32 attempts,
for 269 yards and three
touchdowns. Passing dominated
the contest, but several individuals
from both sides gave impressive
performances.
Jim Kaffen, a junior defensive
back from Sacramento, had an
outstanding day for the Whites.
Kaffen intercepted a pass to set
up one White touchdown, and
later recovered a mis-directed
pitch-out to set up another. Scott
Laidlaw, a sophomore running
back responded to the fumble
recovery by scoring on a one-yard
run. Laidlaw has been improving
all spring, and his running should
give the Cardinals added depth in
the backfield next fall.
Wide receiver Miles Moore gave
his usual impressive performance,
with several leaping catches for
the Reds. The Reds scored first in
the game on a Boryla to Moore
passing play that covered 17
yards. Ottmar and the Whites
responded by driving 43 yards,

and Scott Laidlaw scored for the
Whites on an eight yard by
Ottmar. Ottmar completed >ix of
seven passes in that drive.
Also encouraging was the
running of junior Winesberry, who
had spurts of greatness on
Saturday. Winesberry, who has
hopefully recovered from knee
surgery, scored the Whites second
touchdown on a one-yard plunge.
The former Tulsa, Oklahoma,
All-American, set up that score
with a twelve-yard run.
Boryla sparked the Red
comeback with a 60 yard scoring
pass to junior Mike Sobilik,
against an apparently confused
White secondary. Sobilik trotted
the final 25 yards unmolested.
Junior placekicker Rod Garcia
took time out of his morning
activities to contribute a 37 yard
field goal for the Reds, but
jokingly refused to compete for
the Whites, whose only field goal
attempt of the day was blocked.
The Red defensive front four
looked good on this and several
other occasions, and the White
defensive line showed much
promise also.
The final score of the day was
a nine yard touchdown pass from |
Boryla to running back Doug
Jena, with only 25 seconds
remaining in the game. Boryla's
two-point conversion attempt was
unsuccessful.
The Pacific-Eight, as always,
should be one of the strongest in
the nation next year. Again, USC
appears to be the team to beat.
With running backs Sam
Cunningham and Rod McNeil,
Southern Cal should have a potent
offensive attack. An important
question mark will be how well
the two stellar backs respond to

off-season operations this past
year.
While Stanford quarterbacks
were having a heyday in the air,
the three signal-callers from rival
California were not so fortunate.
Only reserve Reed Chastang
proved effective, as he completed
9 of 12 attempts for 71 yards.
Soph Steve Bartkowski could
connect on only 6 of 16 passes,
with two interceptions. Jay Cruze,
a starter last season, was equally

ineffective, managing 5
completions in 16 attempts. The
two quarterbacks threw three
interceptions.
Head coach Mike White was
pleased with the performance of
the defense. The only score of the
contest was a 42-yard field goal
by Randy Wersching.
Cal should have the talent to
be a representative team next
season, but a lot will depend on
what happens with the NCAA ban.
