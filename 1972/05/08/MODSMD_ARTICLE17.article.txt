# Cal Sweeps Card Crew
## 
### 
Last Saturday, Cal's varsity
crew garnered an 18-second win
over Stanford, a margin of almost
three lengths of open water at the
finish, to put the final stamp on a
sweep of all its races against
Stanford.
Cal's first boat took a brisk
start at the Redwood Shores
Lagoon near Belmont, and
quickly took hold of a one length
lead. Both boats slowed somewhat
in the last half of the course,
where the course opens from a
stretch wide, enough for only
three boats to a large and windy

basin, but Cal nevertheless
lengthened its margin.
Stanford's freshman eight came
within six seconds of winning in
the closest race all day, after
holding neck and neck with Cal at
the quarter mark, 500 meters
through the course.
The frosh have taken some of
the narrowest margins in the
crew's many losses this season,
and their coach hopes for a good
showing at the Western Sprints
two weeks from now at Long
Beach.
Under cold and cloudy skies,

the J.V. eight fought a losing
battle against the Cal boat and
was left 22 seconds in its wake.
The closest finish of the morning
saw a Stanford freshman four
come within an arm's length of
overtaking the slower of two Cal
fours it took on at the same time.
At the race's end, the Cal
varsity coxswain still shivering
from his victory plunge into the
lagoon's salt water, the meet's Jim
Reynolds cup changed hands for
the first time in many years.
