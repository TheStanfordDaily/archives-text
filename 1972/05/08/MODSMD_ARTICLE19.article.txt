MIGs Shot Down
SAIGON — Carrier-based Navy jets
shot down three North Vietnamese
MIG interceptors 80 miles south of
Hanoi, the U.S. Command announced
yesterday.
Other American aircraft knocked
out scores of Communist tanks and
supply trucks attempting to breach
South Vietnamese defenses around
Hue.
While the South Vietnamese
defense lines north of Hue held firm,
North Vietnamese forces threatened to
tumble three frontier base camps in
the central highlands to the west and
northwest of the provincial capital of
Kontum city.
In a communique summing up
action across South Vietnam, the
Saigon command said that the "most
significant enemy activities were
centered in the provinces of Pleiku and
Kontum where enemy forces attacked
several bases." It said only light
fighting was reported in the Hue
region and along the corridor north of
Saigon.
Meanwhile, thirteen prisoners of
war were killed and 56 wounded in a
brief weekend rebellion at South
Vietnam's largest POW camp on Phu
Quoc Island, government military
spokesmen said yesterday.
In a delayed report, field sources
said a U.S. F4 Phantom
fighter-bomber hit a South Vietnamese
village by mistake Friday and killed
nine Saigon marines and wounded 21
at the northern defense line at My
Chanh, 20 miles north of Hue.
A South Vietnamese military
spokesman said such an incident
occurred but referred all questions to
the U.S. Command. The command
said it had no reports of marines being
killed but added that a ground
commander reported some of his
troops had been "dazed" Friday when
bombs from a U.S. plane were
dropped too close to South
Vietnamese lines.
Rogers Returns
THURMONT, Md. — President Nixon
summoned Secretary of State William
P. Rogers home from Europe yester

day and called a National Security
Council meeting for today — a pair of
indications that a major decision on
Vietnam is rapidly approaching.
The White House made the dis
closures while Nixon worked and
relaxed in the seclusion of his Camp
David retreat near here.
Belfast Intervention?
BELFAST — British authorities are
seriously considering the possibility of
United Nations intervention if North
ern Ireland slides further toward sivil
war.
This intervention, a well-placed
source said yesterday, could come
about if militants among the pro
vince's million Protestants go on the
offensive, as they have threatened to
do. And it would come at the request
not of the British but of Ireland's
prime minister, Jack Lynch.
In the past, Britain has rejected any
U.N. involvement in Northern Ireland
on the ground that the troubles here
are a domestic matter. A clear
inference now exists that this veto
policy may change.
UROC For Ashbrook
SAN JOSE — The annual convention
of the conservative United Republi
cans of California yesterday over
whelmingly endorsed Rep. John Ash
brook (R.-Ohio) for the Republican
presidential nomination.
The delegates, widning up a three
day meeting cast 521 votes for
Ashbrook and 60 for President Nixon,
whom they sharply criticized in several
resolutions.
"We as loyal Republicans cannot
and will not support Richard M.
Nixon," said a Republican "loyalty
resolution" adopted by the conven
tion. It assailed the President for
"abrogating the Republican platform
on which he ran for office" and for
"appointing Democrats and disloyal
Republicans to high places" in his
administration.

Weekend Hijackings
HONDURAS — A detachment of
Honduran army troops searched and
isolated mountain region yesterday for
a well-equipped hijacker who para
chuted from an Eastern Airlines jet
with $303,000 rasom.
His was the second marathon
hijacking of the weekend, and both
appeared politically motivated.
The other incident involved a
Western Airlines jet which was coman
deered over Utah and ordered to fly to
Cuba by a young Vietnam war
protester who vowed to sneak back
into the country and hijack more
planes. A neighbor of the youth said
he was due to be inducted into the
Army.
Both planes were taken over Fri
day. The Western jet arrived in Havana
Saturday moming several hours after
the Eastern hijacker bailed out over
the Central American country.
Ostpolitik Problems
BONN, Germany — On the 27th
anniversary of Germany's surrender in
World War 11, the division of Germany
which was brought about remained a
key issue in last-minute efforts to save
Chancellor Willy Brandt's imperiled
Eastern treaties.
Brandt, chancellor of West Ger
many, faces the political battle of his
life to win parliamentary ratification
of his treaties with the East. They
recognize the postwar borders and the
loss of one-third of the territory of the
old German reich.
Brandt has only one day before the
treaties debate opens to work out a
compromise with a powerful parlia
mentary opposition objecting to the
treaties on the ground that they could
mean Germany will never be united
again.
Trying in last-minute talks to meet
these objections, negotiations for
Brandt and the opposition met
Trying in last-minute talks to meet
these objections, negotiators for
Brandt and the opposition met yester
day to try to hammer out a compro
mise declaration that would convince
treaty opponents the question of
German unity is still open.
