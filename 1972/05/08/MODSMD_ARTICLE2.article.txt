# 184 Plead Not Guilty
## Demonstrators Arraigned 
### GLENN KRAMON 
Some 184 of the 192 people
arraigned at the North County Court
house in Palo Alto between April 28
and May 5 have pleaded not guilty to
charges stemming from the April 21
antiwar demonstrations at Hansen
Labs, Encina Hall, and El Camino
Real.
Three persons pleaded guilty, and
five others claimed no contest. Virtual
ly all of these demonstrators have been
charged with two misdemeanors: ob
struction of traffic and unlawful
assembly. This Friday Judge Edward
C. Scoyen of the Santa Clara County
Municipal Court will set trial dates.
A defense collective will represent
most of the protesters pleading not
guilty in court. However, three stu
dents have decided to represent
themselves during the trial, which
must be set within 45 days of the
arraignment.
Suspended Sentence
Judge Scoyen suspended the sen
tence of two non-students, James
Duggan and Gregory Witt, who plead
ed guilty, giving them one year's
informal probation. No charges will be
pressed unless either is arrested again
within a year. Witt, arrested while
traveling through the state on his way
to Washington, said he pleaded guilty
because otherwise he would have had
to wait for a trial.
The judge also referred freshman
Wallace Prugh to a probation officer.
The officer, after meeting with Prugh,
will advise the judge for a May 16
sentencing.
Three students and two non-stu
dents pleaded no contest to their
misdemeanor charges. Although a no
contest plea results in sentencing
similar to a guilty plea, the accused
does not actually admit he is guilty.
Tim Schweitzer, Pierre Lanthiez and
Joseph Fox, Stanford students, and
Michael Gagarin and Karen Plant, area
residents, received suspended sen
tences—one year's " informal proba
tion.
The judge, in all eight guilty and no
contest cases, dropped the charge of

unlawful assembly against each pro
tester, allowing only the obstruction
of traffic charge to remain on record.
The three students accused of
felonies also had their trial dates set.
Chris Gray, freshman, and Paul Stutz,
a senior, had their dispositions set for
May 12 while Freshman Chris Murray
had his set for May 16. All three have
pleaded not guilty.
Misdemeanor Dismissed
In another court proceding last
week, Scoyen dismissed two misde
meanor charges against Martin Sha
piro, a medical student from Canada
who had to return to his home
immediately. The District Attorney
had urged the court to drop charges
because of lack of evidence. Shapiro
claimed to have passed through the
police line to aid Alan English, a
student injured by police when they
encircled the crowd on El Camino.
Three graduate students, John
Dinges, Anthony Meyer and Tom
Peterson, have decided to defend
themselves in court. Dinges, a Latin
American Studies major, explained
why he was representing himself: "A
lawyer only knows what I tell him. He
works from second-hand experience
whereas I work from a direct en
counter with the situation."
However, the majority of demon
strators who pleaded not guilty have
joined a defense collective through
which they hire several lawyers, each
to defend a certain number of cases.
As well as lowering the lawyer fees,
they believe the collective will attract
more donations.
Mick Goldstein, a law student on
the steering committee of the collec
tive, added that the organization exists
for more than just economic reasons.
"It makes sense because the defen
dants are all in it together and they
ft'e! a sense of solidarity," he said.
According to Tom Burke, collective
treasurer, only $3500 of the $20,000
necessary to be prepared to go ahead
with the trial has been raised. Most of
this money has come from the
defendant's own pockets and from

rallies such as Philip Berngan's appear
ance in Memorial Church.
The Juvenile Prosecution Officer
did not file a petition against the
approximately 30 underaged protes
ters. Dinges explains this action by the
court as an "attempt to avoid the
wrath of middle-class Palo Alto par
ents" whose children were arrested.
What is really important, Goldstein
said, is the precedent for the whole
situation. "Police Chief Zurcher has
explained that the reason for the
arrests was to end the anti-war
demonstrations on campus." Goldstein
fears that if the students can not
successfully defend themselves this
time, the police will have discovered a
way to "drive anti-war movements
back into the petition-signing stage"
by arresting protesters who will not be
able to defend themselves.

able to defend themselves.
Some 184 of the 192 people
arraigned at the North County Court
house in Palo Alto between April 28
and May 5 have pleaded not guilty to
charges stemming from the April 21
antiwar demonstrations at Hansen
Labs, Encina Hall, and El Camino
Real.
Three persons pleaded guilty, and
five others claimed no contest. Virtual
ly all of these demonstrators have been
charged with two misdemeanors: ob
struction of traffic and unlawful
assembly. This Friday Judge Edward
C. Scoyen of the Santa Clara County
Municipal Court will set trial dates.
A defense collective will represent
most of the protesters pleading not
guilty in court. However, three stu
dents have decided to represent
themselves during the trial, which
must be set within 45 days of the
arraignment.
Suspended Sentence
Judge Scoyen suspended the sen
tence of two non-students, James
Duggan and Gregory Witt, who plead
ed guilty, giving them one year's
informal probation. No charges will be
pressed unless either is arrested again
within a year. Witt, arrested while
traveling through the state on his way
to Washington, said he pleaded guilty
because otherwise he would have had
to wait for a trial.
The judge also referred freshman
Wallace Prugh to a probation officer.
The officer, after meeting with Prugh,
will advise the judge for a May 16
sentencing.
Three students and two non-stu
dents pleaded no contest to their
misdemeanor charges. Although a no
contest plea results in sentencing
similar to a guilty plea, the accused
does not actually admit he is guilty.
Tim Schweitzer, Pierre Lanthiez and
Joseph Fox, Stanford students, and
Michael Gagarin and Karen Plant, area
residents, received suspended sen
tences—one year's " informal proba
tion.
The judge, in all eight guilty and no
contest cases, dropped the charge of

unlawful assembly against each pro
tester, allowing only the obstruction
of traffic charge to remain on record.
The three students accused of
felonies also had their trial dates set.
Chris Gray, freshman, and Paul Stutz,
a senior, had their dispositions set for
May 12 while Freshman Chris Murray
had his set for May 16. All three have
pleaded not guilty.
Misdemeanor Dismissed
In another court proceding last
week, Scoyen dismissed two misde
meanor charges against Martin Sha
piro, a medical student from Canada
who had to return to his home
immediately. The District Attorney
had urged the court to drop charges
because of lack of evidence. Shapiro
claimed to have passed through the
police line to aid Alan English, a
student injured by police when they
encircled the crowd on El Camino.
Three graduate students, John
Dinges, Anthony Meyer and Tom
Peterson, have decided to defend
themselves in court. Dinges, a Latin
American Studies major, explained
why he was representing himself: "A
lawyer only knows what I tell him. He
works from second-hand experience
whereas I work from a direct en
counter with the situation."
However, the majority of demon
strators who pleaded not guilty have
joined a defense collective through
which they hire several lawyers, each
to defend a certain number of cases.
As well as lowering the lawyer fees,
they believe the collective will attract
more donations.
Mick Goldstein, a law student on
the steering committee of the collec
tive, added that the organization exists
for more than just economic reasons.
"It makes sense because the defen
dants are all in it together and they
ft'e! a sense of solidarity," he said.
According to Tom Burke, collective
treasurer, only $3500 of the $20,000
necessary to be prepared to go ahead
with the trial has been raised. Most of
this money has come from the
defendant's own pockets and from

rallies such as Philip Berngan's appear
ance in Memorial Church.
The Juvenile Prosecution Officer
did not file a petition against the
approximately 30 underaged protes
ters. Dinges explains this action by the
court as an "attempt to avoid the
wrath of middle-class Palo Alto par
ents" whose children were arrested.
What is really important, Goldstein
said, is the precedent for the whole
situation. "Police Chief Zurcher has
explained that the reason for the
arrests was to end the anti-war
demonstrations on campus." Goldstein
fears that if the students can not
successfully defend themselves this
time, the police will have discovered a
way to "drive anti-war movements
back into the petition-signing stage"
by arresting protesters who will not be
able to defend themselves.
