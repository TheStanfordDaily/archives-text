## Berrigan Raps Candidates 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Father Daniel Berrigan told an audience of 1500
people in Memorial Church Friday that "electoral politics
are the continuing big distraction for real change."
"Every four years we rise up again with the idea that
the Messiah is on the horizon," Berrigan said. "I think
that almost anybody would be better than the present
incumbent," he added, but warned that the real problem
in this country was one of "spiritual bankruptcy" which
would not be corrected by a change of candidates.
Berrigan discussed his recent stay in Connecticut's
Danbury State Prison, from which he was recently
released on parole after serving time for destroying draft
records in Catonsville, Md., in 1967.
He declared, "In a much lesser degree than Attica or
San Quentin, we are turning things around much like the
campuses were turning things around in the 60's . .. The
offering of something like a true alternative is the difficult
task of the 70's."
Claiming that "resistance is a lifetime job," the
poet-priest asked the audience to conceive what it would
be like to eradicate the "dead level of selfishness, of
economics as survival, of militarism and violence as the
only response to threat."
Berrigan added that he no longer felt he was part of a
strong, active movement, but rather that people like
himself are "cast up on the beach as specimens of
heroism, like museum pieces."
Berrigan said he did not come to convert people to his
point of view, but rather as "a sharing of one man's life as
it has ricocheted off many other lives."
In concluding his prepared 40-minute remarks,
Berrigan said it was not a "command" but a suggestion
that people try to "shut off the technological pre-history"

and put an end to the evil perpetrated by "the iron-bound
immodesty of the Western Giant."
He encouraged members of the audience to write
letters of support to his brother, Philip Berrigan, who was
recently convicted of smuggling letters out of prison. The
conviction came after the jury was deadlocked on other
charges of conspiring to kidnap presidential adviser Henry
Kissinger and blow up the heating tunnels in the Capitol.
Discussing his differences with the Catholic Church,
Berrigan remarked, "I am just about as close to the
Catholic Archdiocese in New York as I am to General
Motors. At least General Motors is calling things in to
retool."
Berrigan opened the program by reading two of his
writings, "A Fool's Calling" and"The Risen Tin Can."
The priest received three standing ovations during the
90 minutes in which he read his works, made his prepared
statements, and answered questions from the floor.
Berrigan was introduced by Religion Prof. Robert
McAfee Brown, who stated, "One of the things Daniel
Berrigan has meant to me over the years ... is epitomized
to me by the picture of his capture."
Brown claimed that in the picture he could see, "It was
the cop who was the captive and it was the prisoner who
was free .. . Maybe we have our understandings of
freedom and bondage badly askew," he added.
Closing the program, Brown concluded that Berrigan
"succeeded in showing us that a person can be both very
gentle and also very strong."
Berrigan was invited to speak by the Religious Studies
faculty, and the lecture committee from the Office of
Public Events. The one dollar admission fee goes to the
defense collective for students arrested at El Camino last
month.
