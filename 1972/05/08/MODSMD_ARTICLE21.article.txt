## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Alabama Gov. George Wallace mov
ed into second place in delegate
commitments in the Democratic presi
dential race Saturday night, picking up
51 percent of the vote in the North
Carolina primary to defeat favorite son
candidate Terry Sanford.
The win, coupled with Wallace's
Thursday victory in Tennessee,
prompted the governor to say he was
"a little more inclined" to run a
write-in campaign in the California
primary June 6.
The twin victories delivered 86
delegate votes to Wallace, and moved
him past Minnesota Sen. Hubert
Humphrey in total delegate votes.
Wallace has 210 votes, compared to
Humphrey's 197, and 128'/2 for Maine

Sen. Edmund Muskie, who has drop
ped out of all primary campaigns.
South Dakota Sen. George McGovern
leads the race with 267'/2 committed
votes.
Riding the Bus
Although there were 11 candidates
on the ballot in North Carolina, only
Wallace, Sanford, and Rep. Shirley
Chisholm of New York campaigned in
the state. Wallace rode the busing issue
hard, and the only surprise was the
margin of his victoryâ€”slightly higher
than expected.
Sanford, a former governor of the
state and currently president of Duke
University, had hoped to beat Wallace
in the cities, but won only 37 percent
of the vote. Sanford is a Southern

liberal, who has expressed hope he
might be the compromise candidate
when the party meets in Miami this
summer.
Chisholm, who centered her cam
paign around black college students,
won eight percent of the vote, but no
delegates. Wallace earned 37 votes,
while Sanford picked up 27.
Sanford indicated he would also
enter the New Jersey primary this
June. His 27 votes make him fifth on
the list of Democratic contenders.
The campaign now moves to West
Virginia and Nebraska, where the
primaries are "popularity only" con
tests that do not decide any delegate
votes. Both primaries take place
Tuesday.
