# Workers Withdraw Grievances, Drop Demand For Lionetti Firing
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Grievances filed by three black Faculty Club
workers against Chef Arturo Lionetti have quietly
been dropped.
The three workers, John Patterson, Ray
Bradford, and Leonard McKinny, apparently
dropped their complaints after an April 13 meeting
at the Black House with Lionetti and several others,
including, reportedly, ASSU President Doug
McHenry, Black Students Union Chairman Charles
Ogletree, and Special Assistant to the President
James Simmons. 112 ...
The original complaints had alleged that Lionetti
made racist remarks to the three workers and asked
that he be fired.
The petitions, which were filed on April 7, set
off a week of picketing in front of the Faculty Club,
where Lionetti is head chef.
'Quite Upset'
Library worker Roy Boggs, who represented the
three when their grievances were first filed with
Personnel Director Emil Sarpa, was not notified of
the April 13 meeting, and described himself as
"quite upset" when he learned of the meeting.
Contacted yesterday, McKinny said that Lionetti
would not at first admit that he made the remarks
attributed to him.

"He first said he didn't know if he had said it,
but later said he might have, but he said he was only
joking," said McKinny. "We came to an agreement
that if he wouldn't say those things any more, that
we would drop it."
The original grievances charged that Lionetti had
made several racial slurs concerning blacks and
Chicanos in the presence of the workers. He zi one
point told Patterson that he would kill his daughter
before he would let her marry a Mexican, according
to a statement released at the time of the filing.
Boggs yesterday charged Simmons with "highly
improper and unprincipled conduct" for his role in
arranging the April 13 meeting, saying that
Simmons "had no business being there" at the Black
House meeting, and accusing him of "pressuring"
the workers.
Strange Things
"We originally filed the grievances the first week
in April, and the picketing began. That continued
until Thursday the 13th, and that's when strange
things started to happen," said Boggs.
"I was supposed to be these guys' employee's
representative, and they [Lionetti and Simmons]
just ignored me." He said that at the meeting
Lionetti "tried to come off as a benign Archie
Bunker type."

He also claimed that Lionetti had offered at least
one of the workers a more desirable shift in return
for dropping the complaint, an allegation that could
not be substantiated.
Contacted yesterday, Lionetti was
uncommunicative. "I haven't heard anything, I
don't know anything," he said several times.
Errand Boy
â€ž Boggs also charged that Simmons was serving as
"a troubleshooter ... an errand boy" for President
Lyman in the affair, working behind the scenes to
smooth things out. He said that Simmons had
enlisted the aid of BSU Chairman Ogletree, who is
"young and inexperienced in dealing with these
administration people."
Boggs said that he "wouldn't trust James
Simmons as far as I could throw him. You can print
every word of that, as far as I'm concerned."
Neither Ogletree nor Simmons could be reached
for comment.
According to Sarpa, the grievances were never
formally dropped. Rather, he said, he had contacted
the three workers "two weeks ago" to tell them that
they should file individual statements rather than a
joint complaint. He received no response from them
since then, and said that "I would assume it [the
complaint] is no longer a consideration."
