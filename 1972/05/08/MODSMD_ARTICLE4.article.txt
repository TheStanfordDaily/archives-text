# Palo Alto Clinic
## Med Center Offers Alternate Plan 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
The Stanford University Medical
Center has offered beds, land, and
supporting facilities to the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic in an effort to dissuade
the clinic from proceeding with plans
to build a new hospital.
Dr. Clayton Rich, dean of the
Medical School, made the proposal to
Dr. Robert Jamplis, the executive
director of the clinic, in a letter dated
April 24.
The clinic had previously requested
that Stanford lease them land near the
medical center on which they would
build "a hospital of the future," aimed
at decreasing hospital costs.
Rich's proposal includes an offer to
recommend that "Stanford University
lease land in the immediate vicinity of
Stanford University Hospital so that
you [the medical clinic 1 could relo
cate the clinic here."

Rich also stated that he was
"prepared to recommend that Stan
ford add beds to the Stanford
University Hospital of appropriate
number and type so that we can
provide the Palo Alto Medical Clinic
with the number and type of in
patient services you need."
While Rich claims that his plan is
"vastly more satisfactory" than the
clinic's proposal of building a new
hospital which would compete with
Stanford, Jamplis stated that there are
still "lots of questions," in his mind
about the proposed deal.
He said that it does not appear to
meet the clinic's goal "to build a
hospital in which we could control the
costs, not just the leasing of beds."
However, Rich believes that "Stan
ford University and the community
both would be served better by one
hospital which is outstanding than by

two hospitals, possibly both under
utilized."
While both Rich and Jamplis have
stated that negotiations between the
medical clinic and the medical center
will continue, the clinic is proceeding
with its search for a hospital site.
Original Proposal Defeated
Originally the clinic intended to
build its new hospital in downtown
Palo Alto, but this proposal was
turned down by voters two years ago.
At present the clinic has a contract
with American Medicorps, Inc., which
is evaluating possible sites for the
clinic.
Possible sites under consideration at
present include land in Menlo Park
owned by St. Patrick's Seminary; land
on Embarcadero Road, west of the
Bayshore Freeway; a site along Sand
Hill Road across from the entrance to
the Sharon Heights Country Club; and
land at the corner of Page Mill Road

and the Foothill Expressway, property
owned by Stanford.
Most Desirable
Jamplis has stated that at present
the Page Mill Road site appears to be
the "most desirable." Rich said that
the possibility of leasing land to the
clinic anywhere on Stanford's campus
was discussed "at length" by the
Stanford Center's executive committee
but that no agreement was reached.
Rich's opposition to the clinic's
plan for a new hospital was based on
"a strong concern that the construc
tion of a second hospital in Palo Alto
would cause unnecessary and undesira
ble duplication of very complex and
expensive medical resources.
"If a new hospital is the only
possible course for you, I would have
to discuss further with our faculty the
issue of Stanford land being used for
this purpose," Rich said.

Stanford, Jamplis stated that there are
still "lots of questions," in his mind
about the proposed deal.
He said that it does not appear to
meet the clinic's goal "to build a
hospital in which we could control the
costs, not just the leasing of beds."
However, Rich believes that "Stan
ford University and the community
both would be served better by one
hospital which is outstanding than by

two hospitals, possibly both under
utilized."
While both Rich and Jamplis have
stated that negotiations between the
medical clinic and the medical center
will continue, the clinic is proceeding
with its search for a hospital site.
Original Proposal Defeated
Originally the clinic intended to
build its new hospital in downtown
Palo Alto, but this proposal was
turned down by voters two years ago.
At present the clinic has a contract
with American Medicorps, Inc., which
is evaluating possible sites for the
clinic.
Possible sites under consideration at
present include land in Menlo Park
owned by St. Patrick's Seminary; land
on Embarcadero Road, west of the
Bayshore Freeway; a site along Sand
Hill Road across from the entrance to
the Sharon Heights Country Club; and
land at the corner of Page Mill Road

and the Foothill Expressway, property
owned by Stanford.
Most Desirable
Jamplis has stated that at present
the Page Mill Road site appears to be
the "most desirable." Rich said that
the possibility of leasing land to the
clinic anywhere on Stanford's campus
was discussed "at length" by the
Stanford Center's executive committee
but that no agreement was reached.
Rich's opposition to the clinic's
plan for a new hospital was based on
"a strong concern that the construc
tion of a second hospital in Palo Alto
would cause unnecessary and undesira
ble duplication of very complex and
expensive medical resources.
"If a new hospital is the only
possible course for you, I would have
to discuss further with our faculty the
issue of Stanford land being used for
this purpose," Rich said.

ON STRlKE—Demonstrators have picketed the Physical Plant for several days as part of their Offensive Against the War.
According to one demonstrator, the physical plant was chosen because it is "vulnerable," and because workers there have
expressed sympathy for the protesters.
The Stanford University Medical
Center has offered beds, land, and
supporting facilities to the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic in an effort to dissuade
the clinic from proceeding with plans
to build a new hospital.
Dr. Clayton Rich, dean of the
Medical School, made the proposal to
Dr. Robert Jamplis, the executive
director of the clinic, in a letter dated
April 24.
The clinic had previously requested
that Stanford lease them land near the
medical center on which they would
build "a hospital of the future," aimed
at decreasing hospital costs.
Rich's proposal includes an offer to
recommend that "Stanford University
lease land in the immediate vicinity of
Stanford University Hospital so that
you [the medical clinic 1 could relo
cate the clinic here."

Rich also stated that he was
"prepared to recommend that Stan
ford add beds to the Stanford
University Hospital of appropriate
number and type so that we can
provide the Palo Alto Medical Clinic
with the number and type of in
patient services you need."
While Rich claims that his plan is
"vastly more satisfactory" than the
clinic's proposal of building a new
hospital which would compete with
Stanford, Jamplis stated that there are
still "lots of questions," in his mind
about the proposed deal.
He said that it does not appear to
meet the clinic's goal "to build a
hospital in which we could control the
costs, not just the leasing of beds."
