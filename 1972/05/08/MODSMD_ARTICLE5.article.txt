# The 						Stanford Daily OPINIONS
## attracts graduates, faculty University Needs Research

Research is the ingredient
which makes Stanford different
from many other institutions at
which it is possible to get a good
college education. Research at the
frontiers of knowledge makes the
institution where it is performed a
lively and interesting place.
Research brings to campus the
best in faculty and graduate
students. They, as well as the
ideas generated by the research
itself, are the driving force for
innovation and excellence in our
undergraduate programs. Kill
research and you destroy the very
forces which brought most
members of the Stanford
community here in the first place.
But it is argued that no one
seeks to stop research at
Stanford—only "bad" research. If
we judge individual research
projects based upon their possible
applications, we would in essence
be applying prior restraint upon
what classes of ideas and
knowledge are "acceptable" to
the university community. (We
must not confuse this with
academic judgments about the
competence of research or
teaching.) What a cry would arise
if anyone tried to ban from
campus the writings of Karl Marx
or Mao Tse-Tung! We have
progressed far since the days when
this kind of thing could be
contemplated. Let us not allow
our indignation about an immoral
war to undo the lessons so
painfully learned.
Outside support is essential for
many areas of university research.
The equipment and specialized
personnel and support services
required are in most cases well
beyond the financial capabilities
of universities—especially private
ones. Therefore the acceptance of
outside support is one way of
protecting the freedom of inquiry.
It is true that one can become
"locked in" to particular areas of
activity and. sometimes, to
sources of support. A university's
policies should attempt to
minimize this risk so far as
possible, by developing a broad
base of support.

We need make every effort to
develop our own financial base,
and we are doing so in the
Campaign for Stanford. We are
encouraging new directions in
research, and have set aside a
Research Development Fund to
assist faculty who wish to change
their research thrust and support
sources.
Is it true that acceptance of
support from the DoD is
tantamount to accepting its values
and objectives? I think not, and
anyone who has ever bought
anything in a store should be able
to understand why. We wish to
conduct research, for the sake of
science and to make Stanford a
place where people will wish to
teach and to learn. DoD has its
own purposes, but these need not
be ours any more than we have to
adopt the corporate objectives of
a company when we buy its
product.
Does Stanford have a moral
obligation to boycott the DoD, in
the sense that you or I might
boycott a company or product?
Again, I think not. One has to
balance whatever progress toward
ending the war or improving our
own morality might come out of
such a stance (I think very little)
against the long-run harm that
would invariably be dealt
Stanford's commitment to
intellectual freedom. Add to this
the significant reduction in the
actual amount of research and the
attendant loss in our academic
viability, and you can see what a
serious blow such a decision
would be to Stanford. Indeed, the
most likely result would be to
cripple an institution which most
believe to be a great societal asset.
You might be interested in
knowing that more than
two-thirds of the support for the
Hansen Laboratories comes from
non-DoD sources (mostly the
National Science Foundation).
This includes a large project on
the us€f of pion technology in
cancer therapy a n . well as basic
research in a number of important
areas. In the microwave section of
Hansen the proportion of

non-DoD support is about 47
percent. One example is a project
sponsored by the Hartford
Foundation for development of
an acoustic microscope for
medical and biological
applications. This work is being
held up pending repair of
equipment damaged in the brief
occupation of a Hansen
Laboratory building on April 21.
In closing, let me say that I do
understand the motives and
frustrations of all of you who
want to see this outrageous war
stopped, now. I share them. But
constructive ways of influencing
the "system" exist, including the
California primary later this
spring. Progress is often slow and
the work is not spectacular, but in
the end it is the only way which
does not lead to acts which are
themselves strongly corrosive to
moral values.

frontiers of knowledge makes the
institution where it is performed a
lively and interesting place.
Research brings to campus the
best in faculty and graduate
students. They, as well as the
ideas generated by the research
itself, are the driving force for
innovation and excellence in our
undergraduate programs. Kill
research and you destroy the very
forces which brought most
members of the Stanford
community here in the first place.
But it is argued that no one
seeks to stop research at
Stanford—only "bad" research. If
we judge individual research
projects based upon their possible
applications, we would in essence
be applying prior restraint upon
what classes of ideas and
knowledge are "acceptable" to
the university community. (We
must not confuse this with
academic judgments about the
competence of research or
teaching.) What a cry would arise
if anyone tried to ban from
campus the writings of Karl Marx
or Mao Tse-Tung! We have
progressed far since the days when
this kind of thing could be
contemplated. Let us not allow
our indignation about an immoral
war to undo the lessons so
painfully learned.
Outside support is essential for
many areas of university research.
The equipment and specialized
personnel and support services
required are in most cases well
beyond the financial capabilities
of universities—especially private
ones. Therefore the acceptance of
outside support is one way of
protecting the freedom of inquiry.
It is true that one can become
"locked in" to particular areas of
activity and. sometimes, to
sources of support. A university's
policies should attempt to
minimize this risk so far as
possible, by developing a broad
base of support.

We need make every effort to
develop our own financial base,
and we are doing so in the
Campaign for Stanford. We are
encouraging new directions in
research, and have set aside a
Research Development Fund to
assist faculty who wish to change
their research thrust and support
sources.
Is it true that acceptance of
support from the DoD is
tantamount to accepting its values
and objectives? I think not, and
anyone who has ever bought
anything in a store should be able
to understand why. We wish to
conduct research, for the sake of
science and to make Stanford a
place where people will wish to
teach and to learn. DoD has its
own purposes, but these need not
be ours any more than we have to
adopt the corporate objectives of
a company when we buy its
product.
Does Stanford have a moral
obligation to boycott the DoD, in
the sense that you or I might
boycott a company or product?
Again, I think not. One has to
balance whatever progress toward
ending the war or improving our
own morality might come out of
such a stance (I think very little)
against the long-run harm that
would invariably be dealt
Stanford's commitment to
intellectual freedom. Add to this
the significant reduction in the
actual amount of research and the
attendant loss in our academic
viability, and you can see what a
serious blow such a decision
would be to Stanford. Indeed, the
most likely result would be to
cripple an institution which most
believe to be a great societal asset.
You might be interested in
knowing that more than
two-thirds of the support for the
Hansen Laboratories comes from
non-DoD sources (mostly the
National Science Foundation).
This includes a large project on
the us€f of pion technology in
cancer therapy a n . well as basic
research in a number of important
areas. In the microwave section of
Hansen the proportion of

non-DoD support is about 47
percent. One example is a project
sponsored by the Hartford
Foundation for development of
an acoustic microscope for
medical and biological
applications. This work is being
held up pending repair of
equipment damaged in the brief
occupation of a Hansen
Laboratory building on April 21.
In closing, let me say that I do
understand the motives and
frustrations of all of you who
want to see this outrageous war
stopped, now. I share them. But
constructive ways of influencing
the "system" exist, including the
California primary later this
spring. Progress is often slow and
the work is not spectacular, but in
the end it is the only way which
does not lead to acts which are
themselves strongly corrosive to
moral values.
