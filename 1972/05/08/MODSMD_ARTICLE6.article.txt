(An open letter So Professor F.W.
Crawford, Chairman of the
Committee of Fifteen.)
Dear Professor Crawford,
We were upset to see a total
rejection of the concept of a
student controlled judicial system
for students by the C-15 vote of
May 2. It appears that the faculty
and administration members of
the Committee, with the
exception of Prof. Solomon
Feferman, have a great lack of
confidence in the ability of
students to handle student
discipline. We hope that it is not
too late for the Committee to
consider some proposal
incorporating the directives of the
student referendum passed in
April, 1971.
Student members of the C-15
have told us that the faculty
members of the committee often
declare that an all-student panel
would be completely
unacceptable to the faculty
senate. Do the faculty members of
the Committee seriously consider
what would be acceptable to
students? Can faculty and
students honestly and effectively
cooperate if student interests
must be continually sacrificed to
faculty domination?
Support Walkout
We support the six student
members of the Committee who
walked out of the Committee
meeting on May 2. The 8-7 vote in
favor of Professor Friedenthal's
plan, with all six students in
opposition, indicates a refusal of
faculty and administration
members of the Committee to
deal in good faith with the
students.
The 8-7 vote reveals a misuse
of the faculty-administration

majority on the Committee, for
Professor Friedenthal's plan was
passed through force of numbers
rather than through
faculty-student cooperation.
If the student members were to
remain on the Committee of
Fifteen at this point, their
presence would provide legitimacy
to a judicial system which was
forced upon them and which does
not incorporate the ideas which
students voted upon in the April
referendum.
We sincerely hope that a means
can be found to get faculty,
administration, and student
members of the Committee
working together again to reach a
decision on a proposal that fairly
represents the position of
students, as well as the positions
of the faculty and the
administration.
(Ed Hayes, John McNeece, and
John Bradley submitted a
proposal for a University Judicial
System to the Committee of
Fifteen which included an all

Hearing Officers.)
ASSU Guest Professor
Editor, THE DAILY:
Since it has become common
practice for Dave Josephson's
name to be followed by the title
"ASSU Guest Professor of Social
Thought" wherever his name is
published, perhaps it would be
appropriate to publish an account
of the meaning of that title.
About a year ago the Student
Senate met and empowered itself
to meet during the summer
quarter with reduced quorum
requirements. Any actions taken
were to come under review by the
full Senate in the fall. Several
meetings did take place and at one
of them, with something like a
dozen Senators or their
representatives present, Dave
Josephson was given the
aforementioned title. The title,
then, reflects the will of perhaps a
dozen people who, in my opinion,

picked Josephson for his
agreement with their own politics.
The full Senate has never ratified
the choice.
While the ASSU government
has not seen fit to grant Mr.
Josephson any funding for his
"Professorship," the Dean's Office
has employed him as a resident
tutor at Columbae House. That
probably means he gets free room
and board as well as a low level of
pay. I wonder what subjects he
tutors in? And how many hours
per week it takes out of his busy
schedule?

Wells Fargo Choice
Editor, THE DAILY:
The May 3 issue of Campus
Report notes that Wells Fargo has
been chosen over a 'competing'
bank to open a branch on campus
after an evenly divided vote of the
Tresidder Union Advisory
Committee.
The community might be
interested to know something
about the unnamed
competitor—Security National
Bank. Its president, Fortney
"Pete" Stark, has been very active
against the war in Vietnam and
was a member of a citizens'
committee which met with the
opposing delegations in Paris in
1970. He has discontinued the
sale of Savings Bonds by his bank
on the grounds that the money
was used by the government to
support war expenditures and that
they were, anyway, one of the
poorest investments one could
make.
The sale of Ecology Bonds has
been substituted (at better
interest) to raise money for
projects in ecology and for
development of low income
neighborhoods in the East Bay.
Stark has been a harsh critic of
the Bank of America for
investment policies which are
against the interests of Third
YVorld countries.
It is also bank practice not to
charge a service fee when accounts
are attached by the government
for non-payment of taxes for
moral reasons. The telephone tax,
for example, was declared by Pres.
Johnson to be a direct levy for
Vietnam costs.
The arguments against Security
National seem specious—such as,

that they ought not to have a
branch here because they do not
already have one in Palo Alto.
Incidentally, Wells Fargo will
offer student checking accounts
for $3 per quarter. Whatever
Security National's offer, they
already offer regular customers
the cheapest rates in the area, free
checking with a $100 balance.
I leave each person to decide
whether the University's choice
was strictly for business
considerations. 1 also want to
make clear that, except as a
customer, I have no connection
with Security National Bank.

C-15 Referendum
Editor, THE DAILY:
The student body is now being
asked to legitimatize the recent
walk-out by the student members
of the C-15 in a forthcoming
referendum. As a "non-political"
member of the student body, I am
inclined to believe that these
students would best serve their
constituents by remaining a part
of C-15 deliberations. Inasmuch as
any judicial system must be
ratified by all constituencies
(including students) before it is
adopted, the logic of a mass
walk-out at this point is
questionable.
I would feel that a NO vote on
the referendum is the best way to
ensure a return of the student
members to the committee and at
the same time expedite the
development of a just judicial
system on the campus.

Dear Prof. Pantell:
Since your remarks in the
Daily May 5 mentioned me, I feel
obliged to respond.
First, in criticizing your work,
Young Crows have never charged
that you were building a laser ray
gun. We have charged, however,
that you were developing
techniques which the military felt
would be useful in developing
such equipment.
Second, I don't know why you
are no longer receiving Navy
money for your research, but I
understand that you have been
trying, over the past few years, to
get out of military-funded
research. I would like to see Navy
comments backing up your
contention that your work has no
(or little) military value, but I am
willing to give you the benefit of
the doubt based on your
intentions.
I think your desire to shift
from military-oriented work is
commendable. But still, on the
basis of Defense Department
statements about the nature of
your work, as well as continuing
reports of DoD interest in
high-powered lasers, I hope you
will join us in exploring exactly
what the military is up to.
I do want to emphasize that I
do not speak for Mr. Barkan, who
has looked more into the
technical aspects of your work.
My reluctance to attack your
work at this point is based upon a
personal evaluation of your
sincerity.

Campus Sexism
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your editorial on sexism was
badly needed. The Daily could
play a much more definitive role
if it did its part to explain what
Affirmative Action is, what
Stanford's program is, and whom
it covers. How, for instance, is
Stanford's program enforced?
Personally, I'd like to see you
do a series of interviews with a
variety of people around campus,
so that people here might begin to
become more familiar with what
sexism is and how it operates.

Dear Professor Crawford,
We were upset to see a total
rejection of the concept of a
student controlled judicial system
for students by the C-15 vote of
May 2. It appears that the faculty
and administration members of
the Committee, with the
exception of Prof. Solomon
Feferman, have a great lack of
confidence in the ability of
students to handle student
discipline. We hope that it is not
too late for the Committee to
consider some proposal
incorporating the directives of the
student referendum passed in
April, 1971.
Student members of the C-15
have told us that the faculty
members of the committee often
declare that an all-student panel
would be completely
unacceptable to the faculty
senate. Do the faculty members of
the Committee seriously consider
what would be acceptable to
students? Can faculty and
students honestly and effectively
cooperate if student interests
must be continually sacrificed to
faculty domination?
Support Walkout
We support the six student

majority on the Committee, for
Professor Friedenthal's plan was
passed through force of numbers
rather than through
faculty-student cooperation.
If the student members were to
remain on the Committee of

to a judicial system which was
forced upon them and which does
not incorporate the ideas which

We sincerely hope that a means

Wells Fargo Choice
Editor, THE DAILY:
The May 3 issue of Campus
Report notes that Wells Fargo has
been chosen over a 'competing'
bank to open a branch on campus
after an evenly divided vote of the
Tresidder Union Advisory
Committee.
The community might be
interested to know something
about the unnamed
competitor—Security National
Bank. Its president, Fortney
"Pete" Stark, has been very active
against the war in Vietnam and
was a member of a citizens'
committee which met with the
opposing delegations in Paris in
1970. He has discontinued the
sale of Savings Bonds by his bank
on the grounds that the money
was used by the government to
support war expenditures and that
they were, anyway, one of the
poorest investments one could
make.
The sale of Ecology Bonds has
been substituted (at better
interest) to raise money for
projects in ecology and for
development of low income
neighborhoods in the East Bay.
Stark has been a harsh critic of
the Bank of America for
investment policies which are
against the interests of Third
YVorld countries.
It is also bank practice not to
charge a service fee when accounts
are attached by the government
for non-payment of taxes for
moral reasons. The telephone tax,
for example, was declared by Pres.
Johnson to be a direct levy for
Vietnam costs.
The arguments against Security
National seem specious—such as,

that they ought not to have a
branch here because they do not
already have one in Palo Alto.
Incidentally, Wells Fargo will
offer student checking accounts
for $3 per quarter. Whatever
Security National's offer, they
already offer regular customers
the cheapest rates in the area, free
checking with a $100 balance.
I leave each person to decide
whether the University's choice
was strictly for business
considerations. 1 also want to
make clear that, except as a
customer, I have no connection

Wells Fargo Choice
Editor, THE DAILY:
The May 3 issue of Campus
Report notes that Wells Fargo has
been chosen over a 'competing'
bank to open a branch on campus
after an evenly divided vote of the
Tresidder Union Advisory
Committee.
The community might be
interested to know something
about the unnamed
competitor—Security National
Bank. Its president, Fortney
"Pete" Stark, has been very active
against the war in Vietnam and
was a member of a citizens'
committee which met with the
opposing delegations in Paris in
1970. He has discontinued the
sale of Savings Bonds by his bank
on the grounds that the money
was used by the government to
support war expenditures and that
they were, anyway, one of the
poorest investments one could
make.
The sale of Ecology Bonds has
been substituted (at better
interest) to raise money for
projects in ecology and for
development of low income
neighborhoods in the East Bay.
Stark has been a harsh critic of
the Bank of America for
investment policies which are
against the interests of Third
YVorld countries.
It is also bank practice not to
charge a service fee when accounts
are attached by the government
for non-payment of taxes for
moral reasons. The telephone tax,
for example, was declared by Pres.
Johnson to be a direct levy for
Vietnam costs.
The arguments against Security
National seem specious—such as,

that they ought not to have a
branch here because they do not
already have one in Palo Alto.
Incidentally, Wells Fargo will
offer student checking accounts
for $3 per quarter. Whatever
Security National's offer, they
already offer regular customers
the cheapest rates in the area, free
checking with a $100 balance.
I leave each person to decide
whether the University's choice

considerations. 1 also want to
make clear that, except as a

C-15 Referendum
Editor, THE DAILY:
The student body is now being
asked to legitimatize the recent
walk-out by the student members
of the C-15 in a forthcoming

member of the student body, I am
inclined to believe that these
students would best serve their

any judicial system must be

Dear Professor Crawford,
We were upset to see a total
rejection of the concept of a
student controlled judicial system
for students by the C-15 vote of
May 2. It appears that the faculty
and administration members of
the Committee, with the
exception of Prof. Solomon
Feferman, have a great lack of
confidence in the ability of
students to handle student
discipline. We hope that it is not
too late for the Committee to
consider some proposal
incorporating the directives of the
student referendum passed in
April, 1971.
Student members of the C-15
have told us that the faculty
members of the committee often
declare that an all-student panel
would be completely
unacceptable to the faculty
senate. Do the faculty members of
the Committee seriously consider
what would be acceptable to
students? Can faculty and
students honestly and effectively
cooperate if student interests
must be continually sacrificed to
faculty domination?
Support Walkout
We support the six student
members of the Committee who
walked out of the Committee
meeting on May 2. The 8-7 vote in
favor of Professor Friedenthal's
plan, with all six students in
opposition, indicates a refusal of
faculty and administration
members of the Committee to
deal in good faith with the
students.
The 8-7 vote reveals a misuse
of the faculty-administration

majority on the Committee, for
Professor Friedenthal's plan was
passed through force of numbers
rather than through
faculty-student cooperation.
If the student members were to
remain on the Committee of
Fifteen at this point, their
presence would provide legitimacy
to a judicial system which was
forced upon them and which does
not incorporate the ideas which
students voted upon in the April
referendum.
We sincerely hope that a means
can be found to get faculty,
administration, and student
members of the Committee
working together again to reach a
decision on a proposal that fairly
represents the position of
students, as well as the positions
of the faculty and the

ASSU Guest Professor
Editor, THE DAILY:
Since it has become common
practice for Dave Josephson's
name to be followed by the title
"ASSU Guest Professor of Social
Thought" wherever his name is
published, perhaps it would be
appropriate to publish an account
of the meaning of that title.
About a year ago the Student
Senate met and empowered itself
to meet during the summer
quarter with reduced quorum
requirements. Any actions taken
were to come under review by the
full Senate in the fall. Several
meetings did take place and at one
of them, with something like a
dozen Senators or their
representatives present, Dave
Josephson was given the
aforementioned title. The title,
then, reflects the will of perhaps a
dozen people who, in my opinion,

picked Josephson for his
agreement with their own politics.
The full Senate has never ratified
the choice.
While the ASSU government
has not seen fit to grant Mr.
Josephson any funding for his
"Professorship," the Dean's Office
has employed him as a resident
tutor at Columbae House. That
probably means he gets free room
and board as well as a low level of
pay. I wonder what subjects he
tutors in? And how many hours

Support Walkout
We support the six student
members of the Committee who
walked out of the Committee
meeting on May 2. The 8-7 vote in
favor of Professor Friedenthal's
plan, with all six students in
opposition, indicates a refusal of
faculty and administration
members of the Committee to
deal in good faith with the
students.
The 8-7 vote reveals a misuse
of the faculty-administration

majority on the Committee, for
Professor Friedenthal's plan was
passed through force of numbers
rather than through
faculty-student cooperation.
If the student members were to
remain on the Committee of
Fifteen at this point, their
presence would provide legitimacy
to a judicial system which was
forced upon them and which does
not incorporate the ideas which
students voted upon in the April
referendum.
We sincerely hope that a means
can be found to get faculty,
administration, and student
members of the Committee
working together again to reach a
decision on a proposal that fairly
represents the position of
students, as well as the positions
of the faculty and the
administration.

John Bradley submitted a
proposal for a University Judicial
System to the Committee of
Fifteen which included an all
student jury and a panel of
Hearing Officers.)
ASSU Guest Professor
Editor, THE DAILY:
Since it has become common
practice for Dave Josephson's
name to be followed by the title
"ASSU Guest Professor of Social
Thought" wherever his name is
published, perhaps it would be
appropriate to publish an account
of the meaning of that title.
About a year ago the Student
Senate met and empowered itself
to meet during the summer
quarter with reduced quorum
requirements. Any actions taken
were to come under review by the
full Senate in the fall. Several
meetings did take place and at one
of them, with something like a
dozen Senators or their
representatives present, Dave
Josephson was given the
aforementioned title. The title,
then, reflects the will of perhaps a
dozen people who, in my opinion,

picked Josephson for his
agreement with their own politics.
The full Senate has never ratified
the choice.
While the ASSU government
has not seen fit to grant Mr.
Josephson any funding for his
"Professorship," the Dean's Office
has employed him as a resident
tutor at Columbae House. That
probably means he gets free room
and board as well as a low level of
pay. I wonder what subjects he
tutors in? And how many hours
per week it takes out of his busy
schedule?

Wells Fargo Choice
Editor, THE DAILY:
The May 3 issue of Campus
Report notes that Wells Fargo has
been chosen over a 'competing'
bank to open a branch on campus
after an evenly divided vote of the
Tresidder Union Advisory
Committee.
The community might be
interested to know something
about the unnamed
competitor—Security National
Bank. Its president, Fortney
"Pete" Stark, has been very active
against the war in Vietnam and
was a member of a citizens'
committee which met with the
opposing delegations in Paris in
1970. He has discontinued the
sale of Savings Bonds by his bank
on the grounds that the money
was used by the government to
support war expenditures and that
they were, anyway, one of the
poorest investments one could
make.
The sale of Ecology Bonds has
been substituted (at better
interest) to raise money for
projects in ecology and for
development of low income
neighborhoods in the East Bay.
Stark has been a harsh critic of
the Bank of America for
investment policies which are
against the interests of Third
YVorld countries.
It is also bank practice not to
charge a service fee when accounts
are attached by the government
for non-payment of taxes for
moral reasons. The telephone tax,
for example, was declared by Pres.
Johnson to be a direct levy for
Vietnam costs.
The arguments against Security
National seem specious—such as,

that they ought not to have a
branch here because they do not
already have one in Palo Alto.
Incidentally, Wells Fargo will
offer student checking accounts
for $3 per quarter. Whatever
Security National's offer, they
already offer regular customers
the cheapest rates in the area, free
checking with a $100 balance.
I leave each person to decide
whether the University's choice
was strictly for business
considerations. 1 also want to
make clear that, except as a
customer, I have no connection
with Security National Bank.

C-15 Referendum
Editor, THE DAILY:
The student body is now being
asked to legitimatize the recent
walk-out by the student members
of the C-15 in a forthcoming
referendum. As a "non-political"
member of the student body, I am
inclined to believe that these
students would best serve their
constituents by remaining a part
of C-15 deliberations. Inasmuch as
any judicial system must be
ratified by all constituencies
(including students) before it is
adopted, the logic of a mass
walk-out at this point is
questionable.
I would feel that a NO vote on
the referendum is the best way to
ensure a return of the student
members to the committee and at
the same time expedite the
development of a just judicial
system on the campus.

Dear Prof. Pantell:
Since your remarks in the
Daily May 5 mentioned me, I feel
obliged to respond.
First, in criticizing your work,
Young Crows have never charged
that you were building a laser ray
gun. We have charged, however,
that you were developing
techniques which the military felt
would be useful in developing
such equipment.
Second, I don't know why you
are no longer receiving Navy
money for your research, but I
understand that you have been
trying, over the past few years, to
get out of military-funded
research. I would like to see Navy
comments backing up your
contention that your work has no
(or little) military value, but I am
willing to give you the benefit of
the doubt based on your
intentions.
I think your desire to shift
from military-oriented work is
commendable. But still, on the
basis of Defense Department
statements about the nature of
your work, as well as continuing
reports of DoD interest in
high-powered lasers, I hope you
will join us in exploring exactly
what the military is up to.
I do want to emphasize that I
do not speak for Mr. Barkan, who
has looked more into the
technical aspects of your work.
My reluctance to attack your
work at this point is based upon a
personal evaluation of your
sincerity.

Campus Sexism
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your editorial on sexism was
badly needed. The Daily could
play a much more definitive role
if it did its part to explain what
Affirmative Action is, what
Stanford's program is, and whom
it covers. How, for instance, is
Stanford's program enforced?
Personally, I'd like to see you
do a series of interviews with a
variety of people around campus,
so that people here might begin to
become more familiar with what
sexism is and how it operates.

(An open letter So Professor F.W.
Crawford, Chairman of the
Committee of Fifteen.)
Dear Professor Crawford,
We were upset to see a total
rejection of the concept of a
student controlled judicial system
for students by the C-15 vote of
May 2. It appears that the faculty
and administration members of
the Committee, with the
exception of Prof. Solomon
Feferman, have a great lack of
confidence in the ability of
students to handle student
discipline. We hope that it is not
too late for the Committee to
consider some proposal
incorporating the directives of the
student referendum passed in
April, 1971.
Student members of the C-15
have told us that the faculty
members of the committee often
declare that an all-student panel
would be completely
unacceptable to the faculty
senate. Do the faculty members of
the Committee seriously consider
what would be acceptable to
students? Can faculty and
students honestly and effectively
cooperate if student interests
must be continually sacrificed to
faculty domination?
