# Doctors Smoke Pot
## 
### 
Doctors are smoking marijuana
in "significant" numbers,
according to a survey by two
psychiatrists at the Stanford
School of Medicine.
Results showed that of 1314
doctors surveyed, 25 percent had
smoked pot in the past and seven
percent were current users.
The percentage of doctors who
had smoked in the past ranged as
high as 57 percent among Bay
Area physicians under 35, to as
low as one percent among
Nebraska physicians over 45.
In the same survey, 92 percent
said they use alcohol and 21
percent smoke cigarettes.
The researchers, Martin R.
Lipp and Samuel G. Benson, both
residents in psychiatry at
Sinn ford, reported their findings

today at the annual meeting of
the American Psychiatric
Association in Dallas.
The psychiatrists obtained
their data from questionnaires
mailed and retrieved a year ago by
the Department of Survey
Research of the American Medical
Association. Physicians in the
study were chosen randomly from
AMA rosters in New York City,
upstate New York, Nebraska, and
the San Francisco Bay Area. Of
the 2652 questionnaires mailed,
1314 were returned.
Another survey made by the
same two doctors in 1970
revealed that half of the 1063
responding medical students had
smoked marijuana, and 30 percent
were current users.
