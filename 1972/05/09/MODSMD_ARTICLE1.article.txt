# Nixon Blockades North Vietnam
## 
### ED KOHN 
Declaring that "we will do whatever
is required to safeguard American lives
and American honor," President
Richard M. Nixon yesterday ordered
entrances to North Vietnamese ports
mined and rail, highway and
communications facilities in that
country "cut off to the maximum
extent possible."
"There is only one way to stop the
killing," the President said. "That is to
keep the weapons of war out of the
hands of the international outlaws of
North Vietnam."
Speaking in a 17-minute
nationally-televised address, Nixon
said U.S. military forces have already
begun to interdict delivery of supplies
to North Vietnam by sea. He said that
"air and naval strikes against military
targets .. . will continue."
[The U.S. command announced
late last night that Navy planes have
successfully dropped mines into the
entrances of North Vietnam's ports.
The command said that all planes
returned safely to their carriers and

that one North Vietnamese plane had
been shot down.
["U.S. Navy aircraft are carrying
out the orders of the Commander in
Chief," the command said in a
statement. "The initial phases of the
mining operation have been
successfully accomplished."]
"United States forces have been
directed to take appropriate measures
within the internal and claimed
territorial waters of North Vietnam to
interdict the delivery of supplies," the
President said.
Renewed Bombing
[The Associated Press reported
from Saigon that U.S. planes bombed
targets near Hanoi yesterday for the
first time since April 16.
[The U.S. command said that three
Russian-built MIG jet fighters were
shot down, while Radio Hanoi
reported that two U.S. jets were shot
down during the raids. U.S. spokesmen
in Saigon denied the Radio Hanoi
report.
[Radio Hanoi also claimed that
U.S. planes bombed irrigation dikes at

Nam Dinh, 50 miles southeast of
Hanoi in the Red River delta. It did
not specify damage to the dikes. The
U.S. command said that such dikes
were not on the planes' target lists.]
Final plans for the escalation
apparently were developed at an
urgent, three-hour meeting of the
National Security Council in
Washington, D.C. yesterday morning.
Secretary of State William P.
Rogers was recalled from Europe to
attend the meeting, and presidential
national security adviser Henry A.
Kissinger was forced to again postpone
a scheduled trip to Japan.
Blockades
The President never used the term
"blockade," but he insisted that North
Vietnam must be denied access to
weapons and war materiels. The last
blockade attempted by the U.S. came
during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis,
when the U.S. was able to force Russia
to remove a number of "offensive"
missiles she had installed in Cuba.
Nixon said that all Americans
would be withdrawn from Vietnam

within four months and the mining of
approaches to North Vietnamese
harbors ended at once if the North
Vietnamese meet two conditions:
—All U.S. prisoners of war are
released; and
—An internationally-supervised
cease-fire is instituted in Vietnam.
"Once prisoners of war are released,
and once the internationally-supervised
cease-fire has begun, we will stop all
acts of force throughout Indochina,"
the President declared.
Ultimatum
In a remark clearly aimed at Russia,
the President informed other nations
whose ships presently are in North
Vietnamese harbors that they have
"three daylight periods" in which to
get their ships out. Thereafter, he said,
all shipping will be "at their own risk."
The President began his speech by
stating that he had only three possible
courses of action: to withdraw all U.S.
troops immediately; to continue
negotiations; or to take "decisive
military action." But he said that given
the certain results of the first two
alternatives, there is "really no choice
at all."
The President said his
administration's recent peace efforts
have been met with "insult" and
"insolence" by the North Vietnamese.
Nixon is slated to travel to Moscow
in two weeks, but observers said that
the summit meeting is now in serious
jeopardy. Nixon said Russia and the
United States are "on the threshold of
a new relationship"-apparently a
reference to impending SALT and
trade agreements—but blasted the
Soviet Union for supplying military
aid to North Vietnam.
Dark Shadows
"Let us not slide back toward the
dark shadows of a previous age," the
President said. "We do not ask you to
sacrifice your principles or your
friends. But neither should you permit
Hanoi's intransigence to blot out the
prospects we together have so
patiently prepared."
Nixon told the nation that his
decisions were being implemented as
he was making his address. The U.S.
has notified the United Nations
Security Council of the naval action to
seal off the North Vietnamese ports.
"The entrances to the ports of
North Vietnam are being mined,
commencing 0900 Saigon time May 9,
and the mines are set to activate
automatically beginning 1800 hours
Saigon time May 11," the notification
read.
Meanwhile, U.S. military and naval
strength in Thailand and off the
Indochina coast reached its highest
peak of the Indochinese War today.
There are now about 155,000
Americans in the war zone, including
almost 50,000 airmen stationed in
Thailand, 41,000 men, including 5000
Marines, attached to the Seventh
Fleet, and about 65,000 men in
Vietnam.

—An internationally-supervised
cease-fire is instituted in Vietnam.
"Once prisoners of war are released,
and once the internationally-supervised
cease-fire has begun, we will stop all
acts of force throughout Indochina,"
the President declared.
Ultimatum
In a remark clearly aimed at Russia,
the President informed other nations
whose ships presently are in North
Vietnamese harbors that they have
"three daylight periods" in which to
get their ships out. Thereafter, he said,
all shipping will be "at their own risk."
The President began his speech by
stating that he had only three possible
courses of action: to withdraw all U.S.
troops immediately; to continue
negotiations; or to take "decisive
military action." But he said that given
the certain results of the first two
alternatives, there is "really no choice
at all."
The President said his
administration's recent peace efforts
have been met with "insult" and
"insolence" by the North Vietnamese.
Nixon is slated to travel to Moscow
in two weeks, but observers said that
the summit meeting is now in serious
jeopardy. Nixon said Russia and the
United States are "on the threshold of
a new relationship"-apparently a
reference to impending SALT and
trade agreements—but blasted the
Soviet Union for supplying military
aid to North Vietnam.
Dark Shadows
"Let us not slide back toward the
dark shadows of a previous age," the
President said. "We do not ask you to
sacrifice your principles or your
friends. But neither should you permit
Hanoi's intransigence to blot out the
prospects we together have so
patiently prepared."
Nixon told the nation that his
decisions were being implemented as
he was making his address. The U.S.
has notified the United Nations
Security Council of the naval action to
seal off the North Vietnamese ports.
"The entrances to the ports of
North Vietnam are being mined,
commencing 0900 Saigon time May 9,
and the mines are set to activate
automatically beginning 1800 hours
Saigon time May 11," the notification
read.
Meanwhile, U.S. military and naval
strength in Thailand and off the
Indochina coast reached its highest
peak of the Indochinese War today.
There are now about 155,000
Americans in the war zone, including
almost 50,000 airmen stationed in
Thailand, 41,000 men, including 5000
Marines, attached to the Seventh
Fleet, and about 65,000 men in
Vietnam.

UP THE HILL—A crowd of up to 450 anti-war protestors marched from
between Stern and Wilbur Halls to President Lyman's house last night. Lyman
did not come out to speak to the crowd.
Declaring that "we will do whatever
is required to safeguard American lives
and American honor," President
Richard M. Nixon yesterday ordered
entrances to North Vietnamese ports
mined and rail, highway and
communications facilities in that
country "cut off to the maximum
extent possible."
"There is only one way to stop the
killing," the President said. "That is to
keep the weapons of war out of the
hands of the international outlaws of
North Vietnam."
Speaking in a 17-minute
nationally-televised address, Nixon
said U.S. military forces have already
begun to interdict delivery of supplies
to North Vietnam by sea. He said that
"air and naval strikes against military
targets .. . will continue."
[The U.S. command announced
late last night that Navy planes have
successfully dropped mines into the
entrances of North Vietnam's ports.
The command said that all planes
returned safely to their carriers and

that one North Vietnamese plane had
been shot down.
["U.S. Navy aircraft are carrying
out the orders of the Commander in
Chief," the command said in a
statement. "The initial phases of the
mining operation have been
successfully accomplished."]
"United States forces have been
directed to take appropriate measures
within the internal and claimed
territorial waters of North Vietnam to
interdict the delivery of supplies," the
President said.
Renewed Bombing
[The Associated Press reported
from Saigon that U.S. planes bombed
targets near Hanoi yesterday for the
first time since April 16.
[The U.S. command said that three
Russian-built MIG jet fighters were
shot down, while Radio Hanoi
reported that two U.S. jets were shot
down during the raids. U.S. spokesmen
in Saigon denied the Radio Hanoi
report.
[Radio Hanoi also claimed that
U.S. planes bombed irrigation dikes at

Nam Dinh, 50 miles southeast of
Hanoi in the Red River delta. It did
not specify damage to the dikes. The
U.S. command said that such dikes
were not on the planes' target lists.]
Final plans for the escalation
apparently were developed at an
urgent, three-hour meeting of the
National Security Council in
Washington, D.C. yesterday morning.
Secretary of State William P.
Rogers was recalled from Europe to
attend the meeting, and presidential
national security adviser Henry A.
Kissinger was forced to again postpone
a scheduled trip to Japan.
Blockades
The President never used the term
"blockade," but he insisted that North
Vietnam must be denied access to
weapons and war materiels. The last
blockade attempted by the U.S. came
during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis,
when the U.S. was able to force Russia
to remove a number of "offensive"
missiles she had installed in Cuba.
Nixon said that all Americans
would be withdrawn from Vietnam

within four months and the mining of
approaches to North Vietnamese
harbors ended at once if the North
Vietnamese meet two conditions:
—All U.S. prisoners of war are
released; and
—An internationally-supervised
cease-fire is instituted in Vietnam.
"Once prisoners of war are released,
and once the internationally-supervised
cease-fire has begun, we will stop all

"There is only one way to stop the
killing," the President said. "That is to
keep the weapons of war out of the
hands of the international outlaws of
North Vietnam."
Speaking in a 17-minute
nationally-televised address, Nixon
said U.S. military forces have already
begun to interdict delivery of supplies
to North Vietnam by sea. He said that
"air and naval strikes against military
targets .. . will continue."
[The U.S. command announced
late last night that Navy planes have
successfully dropped mines into the
entrances of North Vietnam's ports.
The command said that all planes
returned safely to their carriers and

that one North Vietnamese plane had
been shot down.
["U.S. Navy aircraft are carrying
out the orders of the Commander in
Chief," the command said in a
statement. "The initial phases of the
mining operation have been
successfully accomplished."]
"United States forces have been
directed to take appropriate measures
within the internal and claimed
territorial waters of North Vietnam to
interdict the delivery of supplies," the
President said.
Renewed Bombing
[The Associated Press reported
from Saigon that U.S. planes bombed
targets near Hanoi yesterday for the
first time since April 16.
[The U.S. command said that three
Russian-built MIG jet fighters were
shot down, while Radio Hanoi
reported that two U.S. jets were shot
down during the raids. U.S. spokesmen
in Saigon denied the Radio Hanoi
report.
[Radio Hanoi also claimed that
U.S. planes bombed irrigation dikes at

Nam Dinh, 50 miles southeast of
Hanoi in the Red River delta. It did
not specify damage to the dikes. The
U.S. command said that such dikes
were not on the planes' target lists.]
Final plans for the escalation
apparently were developed at an
urgent, three-hour meeting of the
National Security Council in
Washington, D.C. yesterday morning.
Secretary of State William P.
Rogers was recalled from Europe to
attend the meeting, and presidential
national security adviser Henry A.
Kissinger was forced to again postpone
a scheduled trip to Japan.
Blockades
The President never used the term
"blockade," but he insisted that North
Vietnam must be denied access to
weapons and war materiels. The last
blockade attempted by the U.S. came
during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis,
when the U.S. was able to force Russia
to remove a number of "offensive"
missiles she had installed in Cuba.
Nixon said that all Americans
would be withdrawn from Vietnam

within four months and the mining of
approaches to North Vietnamese
harbors ended at once if the North
Vietnamese meet two conditions:
—All U.S. prisoners of war are
released; and
—An internationally-supervised
cease-fire is instituted in Vietnam.
"Once prisoners of war are released,
and once the internationally-supervised
cease-fire has begun, we will stop all
acts of force throughout Indochina,"
the President declared.
Ultimatum
In a remark clearly aimed at Russia,
the President informed other nations
whose ships presently are in North
Vietnamese harbors that they have
"three daylight periods" in which to
get their ships out. Thereafter, he said,
all shipping will be "at their own risk."
The President began his speech by
stating that he had only three possible
courses of action: to withdraw all U.S.
troops immediately; to continue
negotiations; or to take "decisive
military action." But he said that given
the certain results of the first two
alternatives, there is "really no choice
at all."
The President said his
administration's recent peace efforts
have been met with "insult" and
"insolence" by the North Vietnamese.
Nixon is slated to travel to Moscow
in two weeks, but observers said that
the summit meeting is now in serious
jeopardy. Nixon said Russia and the
United States are "on the threshold of
a new relationship"-apparently a
reference to impending SALT and
trade agreements—but blasted the
Soviet Union for supplying military
aid to North Vietnam.
Dark Shadows
"Let us not slide back toward the
dark shadows of a previous age," the
President said. "We do not ask you to
sacrifice your principles or your
friends. But neither should you permit
Hanoi's intransigence to blot out the
prospects we together have so
patiently prepared."
Nixon told the nation that his
decisions were being implemented as
he was making his address. The U.S.
has notified the United Nations
Security Council of the naval action to
seal off the North Vietnamese ports.
"The entrances to the ports of
North Vietnam are being mined,
commencing 0900 Saigon time May 9,
and the mines are set to activate
automatically beginning 1800 hours
Saigon time May 11," the notification
read.
Meanwhile, U.S. military and naval
strength in Thailand and off the
Indochina coast reached its highest
peak of the Indochinese War today.
There are now about 155,000
Americans in the war zone, including
almost 50,000 airmen stationed in
Thailand, 41,000 men, including 5000
Marines, attached to the Seventh
Fleet, and about 65,000 men in
Vietnam.

UP THE HILL—A crowd of up to 450 anti-war protestors marched from
between Stern and Wilbur Halls to President Lyman's house last night. Lyman
did not come out to speak to the crowd.
Declaring that "we will do whatever
is required to safeguard American lives
and American honor," President
Richard M. Nixon yesterday ordered
entrances to North Vietnamese ports
mined and rail, highway and
communications facilities in that
country "cut off to the maximum
extent possible."

killing," the President said. "That is to
keep the weapons of war out of the
