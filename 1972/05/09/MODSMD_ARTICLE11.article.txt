## Brazil—Only The Rich Benefit

During recent years, Brazil's economic development has undergone
the greatest acceleration in the country's entire history. For the last
three years, the Gross National Product has been growing at an annual
average of 10%. In 1971, the growth rate reached 11.3%, one of the
highest in the world.
Exports have almost doubled over the last eight years and soared to
a record height of $2.9 billion in 1971. Nearly 20% of the 1971 total
was made up of manufactured goods, as compared with less than 5%
of the much lower total in 1963. Imports have risen at about the same
rate in order to keep Brazil's flourishing industry supplied with
necessary raw materials and capital equipment.
Steel production increased from 2.8 million tons in 1963 to 6
million in 1971. The output of motor vehicles climbed from 163,000
in 1963 to 415,000 in 1970 and 515,000 in 1971. By 1971, Brazilians
owned 8 million television sets. Reflecting the expansion of building,
cement production went up from 5.2 million tons in 1963 to 9.7
million in 1971. Brazilian electrical power amounted to 6.8 million
kilowatts in 1964 and almost doubled by 1971 when it totalled over
13 million kilowatts.
Growth
All of these indices of growth were also matched in transportation
and communications. Ten years ago, the roads of Brazil covered
475,000 kilometers, only 11,500 of which were paved. By the end of
that decade, the total distance came to 950,000, including 43,000
paved kilometers, with the end not yet in sight. The Trans-Amazon
Highway, 3,000 kilometers long is about to be completed, It will help
open up the Amazon Basin, which composes half of Brazil's surface.
Air transportation has also been upgraded. All four of Brazil's airlines
now employ modem jet aircraft. At great expense, a microwave
network has been extended throughout Brazil. A direct-dialing
telephone system now connects most large cities and is constantly
being broadened.
In agriculture, expansion and modernization are also underway.
Between 1962 and 1969, 92,291 tractors were produced. In 1970
alone, 14,097 more came off the line, to which 22,395 were added in
1971.
In an effort to keep step with these changes, annual real
expenditures on education almost tripled from 1961-63 to 1969-71.
Moreover, a vast program to reduce illiteracy among Brazilians
between the ages of 15 and 35 was initiated in 1969.

An official campaign to win Latin American markets for Brazil's
industrial exports, which was commenced in 1971, soon drew the
government into the provision of aid to some of the other countries.
At the present, twelve of the smaller nations of Latin America receive
aid from the Brazilian government. Nevertheless, Brazil's official
foreign debt of 5.3 billion U.S. dollars as of March 1972 makes Brazil
itself one of the largest recipients of foreign aid in the world. In debt
to governmental agencies and private investors in the United States,
Western Europe, Japan, and Canada, Brazil has also borrowed more
from the World Bank than any other country.
Although the national rate of inflation has fallen from 90 percent
per annum in 1964 to about 20 percent during the past three years,
Brazilians have had to learn to live with inflation. Virtually every
element in the economic system has to be adjusted at least once a
year. Wages, pensions, rents, savings, loans, government bonds, fixed
assets, and working capital, among other things, have to be adjusted to
keep step with the rate of inflation. In 1968, the government
introduced a system of frequent small devaluations in the foreign
exchange rate, so as to prevent the development of substantial
differences between internal and external prices.
Little Democracy
Since March 31, 1964, Brazil has been under the rule of officers of
the armed forces, who, with the help of skilled civilian technicians,
have been attempting to modernize many aspects of Brazilian society.
At the same time, however, political democracy has been kept at a
very low level.
Why has the economic boom not been accompanied by advances in
political democracy? Perhaps the answer lies in the way in which the
benefits of this economic growth have been distributed.
From 1960 to 1970, the number of Brazilians rose from 70.1
million to 93.2 million — an increase of over 30%. On the other hand,
although the size of the economically active segment of the
population went from 19.7 million to 26.1 million, this amounted to
proportional decrease: viz., from 28.1% in 1960 to 27.9% in 1970.
A comparative examination of the data contained in Brazil's census
reports for 1960 and 1970 reveals that the prevailing economic system
yielded excellent results during the decade for the wealthiest 20% of
the populaiton, extraordinary benefits for the top 1%, and no
substantial improvement for the bottom 80%.
