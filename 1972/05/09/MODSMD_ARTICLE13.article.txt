# Meyer Pleads No Contest
## 
### 
Stanford junior Tom Meyer
last Wednesday pleaded no
contest to charges of entering the
Placement Center last February
16 with intent to disrupt lawful
business. His plea came near the
end of a jury trial on the charges
in Municipal Court in Palo Alto.
Meyer became emotionally
upset while testifying as to his
motives in allegedly disrupting an
interview being held by a recruiter
for the Data Systems Division of
Litton Industries. After a

conference in chambers, Judge
Sidney Fein berg agreed to permit
Meyer to make the no contest
plea. A second count of refusing
to leave when ordered by a peace
officer was dropped. Meyer
received a suspended sentence.
Meyer had been fasting for ten
days prior to the trial.
Prosecution witnesses included
Placement Director Ralph Keller,
Recruitment Supervisor Frances
Holt slander, university
photographer Luther Long, and
A 1 Kirkland, Assistant Dean of
Engineering.
In response to questions from
his attorney, Peter Tamases, and
cross-examination by prosecutor
Sam Stevens, Meyer described the
origin of his pacifist beliefs during
a stay three years ago in an Army
hospital with Vietnam veterans.
"The main reason I had a trial.

rather than just pleading, was to
raise issues. I don't feel I broke
any laws," he told the Daily.
Tamases suggested the no
contest plea, saying he felt that
Meyer had made his point.
Feinberg apparently agreed,
telling the jurors that although
their services wero not formally
needed to decide the case, they
ought in their own consciences to
come to a verdict on the issues
which had been raised.
The jury consisted of eleven
men and one woman.
The only defense witness
besides Meyer was Frances Fmlev
of the Community News Service,
who described the events at the
Placement Center.
Tamases said that had the trial
continued, Sheriff's Lt. Don
Tamm would have been called as a
prosecution rebuttal witness.
