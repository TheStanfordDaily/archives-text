Davis Getaway?
SAN JOSE — The prosecution began
developing yesterday its contention
that Angela Davis, on Aug. 7, 1970,
waited in San Francisco International
Airport for a hoped-for getaway with
kidnapers who had taken hostages at
Marin County courthouse.
A telephone company security
officer testified that a phone number
found in slain kidnaper Jonathan
Jackson's wallet was that of a public
phone next to the American Airlines
ticket counter at the airport.
Prosecutor Albert Harris Jr. suggested
in his opening statement that Jackson,
brother of convict author George
Jackson, was to call Davis at that
phone in connection with the kidnap
plan.
"You don't call a public telephone
booth unless you expect someone to
be there," he said then.
Jurors were shown color
photographs of the pay phone—a wall
telephone in an open cubicle. The
witness, James Finnegan, testified on
cross-examination by the defense that
the phone is so close to the American
Airlines ticket counter that customers
and employees would have a plain
view of anyone using it.
Primaries Today
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey faces Sen.
George McGovern in Nebraska's
presidential primary, and confronts
Gov. George C. Wallace in West
Virginia today in another leg of the
marathon race for the Democratic
nomination for the White House.
Humphrey and McGovern both
campaigned in Omaha yesterday for a
contest that looked like a tossup on
election eve. Humphrey is favored to
win in West Virginia.
In both states, the presidential
preference polls are not binding:
Democratic National Convention
delegates will be chosen separately and
simultaneously. West Virginia is
electing delegates to cast 35
nominating votes; in Nebraska, 22 of
24 are to be elected.
There is no Republican presidential
contest in West Virginia. In Nebraska,
President Nixon is sure to sweep the
primary over Reps. Paul N. McCloskey
Jr. of California and John M.
Ashbrook of Ohio.
McGovern entered the Tuesday
primaries leading in the competition
for national convention delegates, with
313 v 2 committed for the first ballot.
Humphrey had 238, Wallace 210, and
Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine
128Va.
Board Cuts Raises
WASHINGTON - The Pay Board last
night cut back pay raises for 50,000
East and Gulf Coast longshoremen,
increasing the likelihood of renewed
labor unrest in both East and Gulf
Coast ports and West Coast ports.
By a vote of 6 to 1 the board
rejected the International
Longshoremen's Association,
AFL-CIO, contracts covering North
Atlantic ports, New Orleans and West
Gulf ports.
These contracts contained
straight-time pay increases of 70 cents
an hour in addition to fringe benefits.

The board said it won't approve any
more than 55 cents an hour. But it will
accept all the fringe benefits won by
the union.
This means the board will allow
only a 12-percent increase in
straight-time hourly pay, rather than
the 15 percent negotiated by the
union.
The International Longshoremen's
and Warehousemen's Union and the
Pacific Maritime Association kept
quiet about what action they would
take while awaiting the Pay Board
decision. There was no immediate
response from either.
Harry Bridges, ILWU president, has
said that if the Pay Board trims the
International Longshoremen's
Association contract terms, joint
action by the West Coast ILWU and
the ILA might be taken to close down
all U.S. ports.
Refugees Flee
WASHINGTON - A government
official testified yesterday the North
Vietnamese invasion has forced about
700,000 civilians in South Vietnam to
flee their homes and said the number
of refugees could rise to a million.
Robert H. Nooter of the Agency
for International Development said
that stocks of rice and other foods for
feeding the refugees are adequate "for
almost any eventuality."
Nooter, deputy director of AlD's
bureau for supporting assistance,
testified at a hearing of the Senate
Judiciary subcommittee on refugees.
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the
subcommittee chairman, said he hoped
the hearing would "help upgrade
America's sense of concern and
priority" about civilian war victims in
Indochina.
FAA Alters Jets
WASHINGTON - The Federal
Aviation Administration announced

plans yesterday to make it virtually
impossible to parachute out of a jet
airliner.
The FAA said it is preparing to
require the airlines to modify
transports equipped with rear steps, so
that the exits cannot be opened
during flight.
Order Farm Picket
KEENE, Calif. — Farm labor leader
Cesar Chavez announced yesterday he
has ordered informational picket lines
at more than 100 American Farm
Bureau Federation offices today to
protest what he termed attempts to
"destroy or weaken the union."
The picketing, in 34 states, will be
aimed at legislation which Chavez said
the Farm Bureau is backing to outlaw
the secondary boycott and provide
secret ballot elections on forming an
agricultural union.
Bill Clears Hurdle
SACRAMENTO — The constitutional
amendment proposal to extend
alcoholic beverage rights to
18-year-olds zipped through a key
committee test yesterday and headed
for the Assembly floor.
The measure passed on a 7-1 vote
of the Assembly Constitutional
Amendments Committee.
If the measure gets two-thirds
approval of both houses, it will go on
the ballot next November. Similar
measures last year failed to clear the
legislature.
Anderson Speaks
STOCKTON — Columnist Jack
Anderson says he plans to write next
about secret FBI investigations into
the private affairs of such stars as Jane
Fonda, Marlon Brando, Rock Hudson
and Joe Namath.
"The files the FBI keeps on such
well known personalities is the worst

abuse of government power 1 see
today," Anderson told a news
conference before an address Sunday
night at the University of the Pacific.
He said FBI agents have gathered
information about the stars' sex lives,
political activities and business affairs.
Arabs Hijack Jet
TEL AVIV — Three Arabs hijacked a
Belgian jetliner before it landed
yesterday in Tel Aviv and threatened
to blow it up unless Israel releases
Arab guerrilla prisoners.
An Israeli army spokesman said the
Sabena Airlines 707 had about 90
passengers and 15 crew members on
board.
The hijackers used a loudspeaker to
shout out their demands to Israeli
officials at Lod International Airport
outside Tel Aviv. They read off the
names of guerrillas they wanted
released by the Israelis and said they
should be brought to the aircraft. Only
then would the passengers be released,
the voice on the loudspeaker said.
Nicosia, Cyprus, air controllers said
the hijackers identified themselves as
the Palestinian Black September
Organization, which claimed
responsibility for the assassination late
last year of Prime Minster Wasfi Tell of
Jordan while he was entering an Arab
conference in Cairo, Egypt.

FAA Alters Jets
WASHINGTON - The Federal
Aviation Administration announced

plans yesterday to make it virtually
impossible to parachute out of a jet
airliner.
The FAA said it is preparing to
require the airlines to modify
transports equipped with rear steps, so
that the exits cannot be opened
during flight.
Order Farm Picket
KEENE, Calif. — Farm labor leader
Cesar Chavez announced yesterday he
has ordered informational picket lines
at more than 100 American Farm
Bureau Federation offices today to
protest what he termed attempts to
"destroy or weaken the union."
The picketing, in 34 states, will be
aimed at legislation which Chavez said
the Farm Bureau is backing to outlaw
the secondary boycott and provide
secret ballot elections on forming an
agricultural union.
Bill Clears Hurdle
SACRAMENTO — The constitutional
amendment proposal to extend
alcoholic beverage rights to
18-year-olds zipped through a key
committee test yesterday and headed
for the Assembly floor.
The measure passed on a 7-1 vote
of the Assembly Constitutional
Amendments Committee.
If the measure gets two-thirds
approval of both houses, it will go on
the ballot next November. Similar
measures last year failed to clear the
legislature.
Anderson Speaks
STOCKTON — Columnist Jack
Anderson says he plans to write next
about secret FBI investigations into
the private affairs of such stars as Jane
Fonda, Marlon Brando, Rock Hudson
and Joe Namath.
"The files the FBI keeps on such
well known personalities is the worst

abuse of government power 1 see
today," Anderson told a news
conference before an address Sunday
night at the University of the Pacific.
He said FBI agents have gathered
information about the stars' sex lives,
political activities and business affairs.
Arabs Hijack Jet
TEL AVIV — Three Arabs hijacked a
Belgian jetliner before it landed
yesterday in Tel Aviv and threatened
to blow it up unless Israel releases
Arab guerrilla prisoners.
An Israeli army spokesman said the
Sabena Airlines 707 had about 90
passengers and 15 crew members on
board.
The hijackers used a loudspeaker to
shout out their demands to Israeli
officials at Lod International Airport
outside Tel Aviv. They read off the
names of guerrillas they wanted
released by the Israelis and said they
should be brought to the aircraft. Only
then would the passengers be released,
the voice on the loudspeaker said.
Nicosia, Cyprus, air controllers said
the hijackers identified themselves as
the Palestinian Black September
Organization, which claimed
responsibility for the assassination late
last year of Prime Minster Wasfi Tell of
Jordan while he was entering an Arab
conference in Cairo, Egypt.
Davis Getaway?
SAN JOSE — The prosecution began
developing yesterday its contention
that Angela Davis, on Aug. 7, 1970,
waited in San Francisco International
Airport for a hoped-for getaway with
kidnapers who had taken hostages at
Marin County courthouse.
A telephone company security
officer testified that a phone number
found in slain kidnaper Jonathan
Jackson's wallet was that of a public
phone next to the American Airlines
ticket counter at the airport.
Prosecutor Albert Harris Jr. suggested
in his opening statement that Jackson,
brother of convict author George
Jackson, was to call Davis at that
phone in connection with the kidnap
plan.
"You don't call a public telephone
booth unless you expect someone to
be there," he said then.
Jurors were shown color
photographs of the pay phone—a wall
telephone in an open cubicle. The
witness, James Finnegan, testified on
cross-examination by the defense that
the phone is so close to the American
Airlines ticket counter that customers
and employees would have a plain
view of anyone using it.
Primaries Today
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey faces Sen.
George McGovern in Nebraska's
presidential primary, and confronts
Gov. George C. Wallace in West
Virginia today in another leg of the
marathon race for the Democratic
nomination for the White House.
Humphrey and McGovern both
campaigned in Omaha yesterday for a
contest that looked like a tossup on
election eve. Humphrey is favored to
win in West Virginia.
In both states, the presidential
preference polls are not binding:
Democratic National Convention
delegates will be chosen separately and
simultaneously. West Virginia is
electing delegates to cast 35
nominating votes; in Nebraska, 22 of
24 are to be elected.
There is no Republican presidential
contest in West Virginia. In Nebraska,
President Nixon is sure to sweep the
primary over Reps. Paul N. McCloskey
Jr. of California and John M.
Ashbrook of Ohio.
McGovern entered the Tuesday
primaries leading in the competition
for national convention delegates, with
313 v 2 committed for the first ballot.
Humphrey had 238, Wallace 210, and
Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine
128Va.
Board Cuts Raises
WASHINGTON - The Pay Board last
night cut back pay raises for 50,000
East and Gulf Coast longshoremen,
increasing the likelihood of renewed
labor unrest in both East and Gulf
Coast ports and West Coast ports.
By a vote of 6 to 1 the board
rejected the International
Longshoremen's Association,
AFL-CIO, contracts covering North
Atlantic ports, New Orleans and West
Gulf ports.
These contracts contained
straight-time pay increases of 70 cents
an hour in addition to fringe benefits.

The board said it won't approve any
more than 55 cents an hour. But it will
accept all the fringe benefits won by
the union.
This means the board will allow
only a 12-percent increase in
straight-time hourly pay, rather than
the 15 percent negotiated by the
union.
The International Longshoremen's
and Warehousemen's Union and the
Pacific Maritime Association kept
quiet about what action they would
take while awaiting the Pay Board
decision. There was no immediate
response from either.
Harry Bridges, ILWU president, has
said that if the Pay Board trims the
International Longshoremen's
Association contract terms, joint
action by the West Coast ILWU and
the ILA might be taken to close down
all U.S. ports.
Refugees Flee
WASHINGTON - A government

for International Development said
that stocks of rice and other foods for
feeding the refugees are adequate "for
almost any eventuality."
Nooter, deputy director of AlD's
bureau for supporting assistance,
testified at a hearing of the Senate
Judiciary subcommittee on refugees.
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the
subcommittee chairman, said he hoped

electing delegates to cast 35
nominating votes; in Nebraska, 22 of
24 are to be elected.
There is no Republican presidential
contest in West Virginia. In Nebraska,
President Nixon is sure to sweep the
primary over Reps. Paul N. McCloskey
Jr. of California and John M.
Ashbrook of Ohio.
McGovern entered the Tuesday
primaries leading in the competition
for national convention delegates, with

Board Cuts Raises
WASHINGTON - The Pay Board last
night cut back pay raises for 50,000
East and Gulf Coast longshoremen,
increasing the likelihood of renewed
labor unrest in both East and Gulf
Coast ports and West Coast ports.
By a vote of 6 to 1 the board
rejected the International
Longshoremen's Association,
AFL-CIO, contracts covering North
Atlantic ports, New Orleans and West
Gulf ports.
These contracts contained
straight-time pay increases of 70 cents
an hour in addition to fringe benefits.

The board said it won't approve any
more than 55 cents an hour. But it will
accept all the fringe benefits won by
the union.
This means the board will allow
only a 12-percent increase in
straight-time hourly pay, rather than
the 15 percent negotiated by the
union.
The International Longshoremen's
and Warehousemen's Union and the
Pacific Maritime Association kept
quiet about what action they would
take while awaiting the Pay Board
decision. There was no immediate
response from either.
Harry Bridges, ILWU president, has
said that if the Pay Board trims the
International Longshoremen's
Association contract terms, joint
action by the West Coast ILWU and
the ILA might be taken to close down
all U.S. ports.
Refugees Flee
WASHINGTON - A government
official testified yesterday the North
Vietnamese invasion has forced about
700,000 civilians in South Vietnam to
flee their homes and said the number
of refugees could rise to a million.
Robert H. Nooter of the Agency
for International Development said
that stocks of rice and other foods for
feeding the refugees are adequate "for
almost any eventuality."
Nooter, deputy director of AlD's
bureau for supporting assistance,
testified at a hearing of the Senate
Judiciary subcommittee on refugees.
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the
subcommittee chairman, said he hoped
the hearing would "help upgrade
America's sense of concern and
priority" about civilian war victims in
Indochina.
FAA Alters Jets
WASHINGTON - The Federal
Aviation Administration announced

plans yesterday to make it virtually
impossible to parachute out of a jet
airliner.
The FAA said it is preparing to
require the airlines to modify
transports equipped with rear steps, so
that the exits cannot be opened
during flight.
Order Farm Picket
KEENE, Calif. — Farm labor leader
Cesar Chavez announced yesterday he
has ordered informational picket lines
at more than 100 American Farm
Bureau Federation offices today to
protest what he termed attempts to
"destroy or weaken the union."
The picketing, in 34 states, will be
aimed at legislation which Chavez said
the Farm Bureau is backing to outlaw
the secondary boycott and provide
secret ballot elections on forming an
agricultural union.
Bill Clears Hurdle
SACRAMENTO — The constitutional
amendment proposal to extend
alcoholic beverage rights to
18-year-olds zipped through a key
committee test yesterday and headed
for the Assembly floor.
The measure passed on a 7-1 vote
of the Assembly Constitutional
Amendments Committee.
If the measure gets two-thirds
approval of both houses, it will go on
the ballot next November. Similar
measures last year failed to clear the
legislature.
Anderson Speaks
STOCKTON — Columnist Jack
Anderson says he plans to write next
about secret FBI investigations into
the private affairs of such stars as Jane
Fonda, Marlon Brando, Rock Hudson
and Joe Namath.
"The files the FBI keeps on such
well known personalities is the worst

abuse of government power 1 see
today," Anderson told a news
conference before an address Sunday
night at the University of the Pacific.
He said FBI agents have gathered
information about the stars' sex lives,
political activities and business affairs.
Arabs Hijack Jet
TEL AVIV — Three Arabs hijacked a
Belgian jetliner before it landed
yesterday in Tel Aviv and threatened
to blow it up unless Israel releases
Arab guerrilla prisoners.
An Israeli army spokesman said the
Sabena Airlines 707 had about 90
passengers and 15 crew members on
board.
The hijackers used a loudspeaker to
shout out their demands to Israeli
officials at Lod International Airport
outside Tel Aviv. They read off the
names of guerrillas they wanted
released by the Israelis and said they
should be brought to the aircraft. Only
then would the passengers be released,
the voice on the loudspeaker said.
Nicosia, Cyprus, air controllers said
the hijackers identified themselves as
the Palestinian Black September
Organization, which claimed
responsibility for the assassination late
last year of Prime Minster Wasfi Tell of
Jordan while he was entering an Arab
conference in Cairo, Egypt.
Davis Getaway?
SAN JOSE — The prosecution began
developing yesterday its contention
that Angela Davis, on Aug. 7, 1970,
waited in San Francisco International
Airport for a hoped-for getaway with
kidnapers who had taken hostages at
Marin County courthouse.
A telephone company security
officer testified that a phone number
found in slain kidnaper Jonathan
Jackson's wallet was that of a public
phone next to the American Airlines
ticket counter at the airport.
Prosecutor Albert Harris Jr. suggested
in his opening statement that Jackson,
brother of convict author George
Jackson, was to call Davis at that
phone in connection with the kidnap
plan.
"You don't call a public telephone
booth unless you expect someone to
be there," he said then.
Jurors were shown color
photographs of the pay phone—a wall
telephone in an open cubicle. The
witness, James Finnegan, testified on
cross-examination by the defense that
the phone is so close to the American
Airlines ticket counter that customers
and employees would have a plain
view of anyone using it.
Primaries Today
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey faces Sen.
George McGovern in Nebraska's

Humphrey and McGovern both
campaigned in Omaha yesterday for a
contest that looked like a tossup on
election eve. Humphrey is favored to
win in West Virginia.
In both states, the presidential
preference polls are not binding:
