# Med School Group Seeks Women's Affairs Office

### GEORGE DOBBINS 
A group of professional women at
the Medical School have proposed the
creation of an Office of Women's
Affairs, aimed at enabling them to
perform more research and at
improving their career and job
opportunities.
The proposal was submitted to
Medical School Dean Clayton Rich last
week by the Professional Women of
the Stanford Medical School
(PWSMS), an organization composed
mainly of women M.D.sand Ph.D.s
which was formed three years ago to
"promote development of
opportunities for women in the
medical sciences."
The PWSMS asked that women be
given better counseling on
employment and financial aid available
to women students. The proposal also
suggested that medical school
admissions policies and job
promotions for qualified women come
under the auspices of the Office of
Women's Affairs.
Rich said that he favors an
"effective program for women" but
added, "I can't respond immediately
to this proposal until I've looked at it
in more detail."
Backers of the proposal anticipate
the life span of the Office of Women's
Affair will be no more than 10 years.
"We expect that many of the

problems we face can be solved in the
foreseeable future and the functions of
the Office of Women's Affairs
incorporated into the ordinary
structure of Stanford administration,"
the proposal states.
Presently, the Medical School
operates an office devoted to the
development of career opportunities
for women in medicine under the
auspices of the Macy Foundation of
New York. According to Dora
Goldstein, a PWSMS council member,
funding for this program will run out
soon.
She has suggested along with her
colleague, Ann Taylor, that a small
part of the $5 million McCormick
bequest to the Medical School, might
be used as a source of funding for the
new office. The gift came with the
stipulation that it be used to assist
women studying medicine.
According to the PWSMS proposal,
the office would be headed by a
female M.D. or Ph.D., appointed by a
committee of faculty, administrators,
students and PWSMS. She would be
assisted by an administrative assistant
and a secretary.
Rich said the proposal is still under
review and called it a "complex
problem," but Goldstein optimistically
predicted that "our proposal will
eventually achieve favorable
acceptance."
