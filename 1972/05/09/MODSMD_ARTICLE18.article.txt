# Senate Offers Health Degree
## 
### 
A new master of science degree program in Health
Services Administration (HSA), perhaps the first of its
type in the U.S. involving such a variety of disciplines, has
been approved without dissent by the Faculty Senate.
The interdisciplinary program will include the Schools
of Medicine, Business, Engineering, and Humanities and
Sciences. It will lead to a second graduate degree, a master
of science, granted by the Department of Community and
Preventive Medicine, for students already enrolled in other
graduate curricula at Stanford.
The first class of 25 students is expected to begin study
in Autumn Quarter 1973. Participants will be required to
complete the HSA degree requirements in three academic
quarters or less, depending upon previous course work,
plus three-months of practical experience at a health
organization.
Program co-directors Count D. Gibson Jr., Department
of Community and Preventive Medicine, and Nicholas
Baloff, associate professor of business administration,
believe it will help relieve the acute shortage of highly
qualified professionals capable of assuming administrative
roles in newly emerging, sophisticated health delivery
organizations proposed to combat the current national
crisis in health care.
Financial assistance to developing and implementing
the program is being sought from the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare's National Center for
Health Services Research and Development.
Gibson pointed out that the multitude of emerging
health delivery organizations will have a mandate to
provide a broader range of services than hospitals have
traditionally delivered.
"The hospitals, with their orientation toward acute
care, have been at one end of the health delivery
spectrum," he said. "However, the health care system is
also concerned with keeping people healthy and out of
the hospital through preventive and ambulatory care.
"It is also concerned with making policy and planning
on local, regional and national levels to meet the health
needs of defined populations of people throughout the
country." Therefore, an attempt is being made to educate
men and women who can creatively manage all the
resources available to them.

Baloff noted that a graduate of the program would be
qualified to work in health maintenance organizations,
health care centers, preventive medicine, drug abuse
centers, medical society foundations, hospitals, medical
clinics, mental health facilities, and in governmental
agencies such as HEW.
Dr. Clayton Rich, dean of the School of Medicine,
agrees that "the need for well trained, research-oriented
administrators with a variety of interdisciplinary
backgrounds . . . will be very great in the next decade."
"The proposed program," Rich said, "could fill a niche
not filled by schools of hospital administration and serve
as a nucleus for very exciting research endeavors involving
the different schools, the hospital, and medical agencies in
the surrounding communities."
Arjay Miller, dean of the Graduate School of Business,
said "one of the principal strengths of the program is its
interdisciplinary nature for health services administration,
with its broad social and technological implications, it is
important that the schools of medicine and business be
joined by humanities and sciences and engineering."
Miller also sees his school's participation as "an
important extension of the Business School's activities in
public sector management."
Closely associated with HSA from its earliest
conceptual stages are Business Prof. John Moore and
Medical Prof. John C. Hershey.
During the past two and one-half years, Baloff and
Gibson have jointly headed a team of researchers from the
Business and Medical Schools who are developing a
management information system to provide health
administrators, regional health planners, and federal
policy makers with practical information with which
decisions about operating health facilities, planning future
health care needs and evaluating quality of health care
delivery can be made.
Currently they are testing their management
information system at a small community-owned and
controlled health center in Livingston, San Joaquin
County. After a successful demonstration there, the
system is expected to become a model for health care
centers around the country.

Medical Prof. John C. Hershey.
During the past two and one-half years, Baloff and
Gibson have jointly headed a team of researchers from the
Business and Medical Schools who are developing a
management information system to provide health
administrators, regional health planners, and federal
policy makers with practical information with which
decisions about operating health facilities, planning future
health care needs and evaluating quality of health care
delivery can be made.
Currently they are testing their management
information system at a small community-owned and
controlled health center in Livingston, San Joaquin
County. After a successful demonstration there, the
system is expected to become a model for health care
centers around the country.
A new master of science degree program in Health
Services Administration (HSA), perhaps the first of its
type in the U.S. involving such a variety of disciplines, has
been approved without dissent by the Faculty Senate.
The interdisciplinary program will include the Schools
of Medicine, Business, Engineering, and Humanities and
Sciences. It will lead to a second graduate degree, a master
of science, granted by the Department of Community and
Preventive Medicine, for students already enrolled in other
graduate curricula at Stanford.
The first class of 25 students is expected to begin study
in Autumn Quarter 1973. Participants will be required to
complete the HSA degree requirements in three academic
quarters or less, depending upon previous course work,
plus three-months of practical experience at a health
organization.
Program co-directors Count D. Gibson Jr., Department
of Community and Preventive Medicine, and Nicholas
Baloff, associate professor of business administration,
believe it will help relieve the acute shortage of highly
qualified professionals capable of assuming administrative
roles in newly emerging, sophisticated health delivery
organizations proposed to combat the current national
crisis in health care.
Financial assistance to developing and implementing
the program is being sought from the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare's National Center for
Health Services Research and Development.
Gibson pointed out that the multitude of emerging
health delivery organizations will have a mandate to
provide a broader range of services than hospitals have
traditionally delivered.
"The hospitals, with their orientation toward acute
care, have been at one end of the health delivery
spectrum," he said. "However, the health care system is
also concerned with keeping people healthy and out of
the hospital through preventive and ambulatory care.
"It is also concerned with making policy and planning
on local, regional and national levels to meet the health
needs of defined populations of people throughout the
country." Therefore, an attempt is being made to educate
men and women who can creatively manage all the
resources available to them.

Baloff noted that a graduate of the program would be
qualified to work in health maintenance organizations,
health care centers, preventive medicine, drug abuse
centers, medical society foundations, hospitals, medical
clinics, mental health facilities, and in governmental
agencies such as HEW.
Dr. Clayton Rich, dean of the School of Medicine,
agrees that "the need for well trained, research-oriented
administrators with a variety of interdisciplinary
backgrounds . . . will be very great in the next decade."
"The proposed program," Rich said, "could fill a niche
not filled by schools of hospital administration and serve
as a nucleus for very exciting research endeavors involving
the different schools, the hospital, and medical agencies in
the surrounding communities."
Arjay Miller, dean of the Graduate School of Business,
said "one of the principal strengths of the program is its
interdisciplinary nature for health services administration,
with its broad social and technological implications, it is
important that the schools of medicine and business be
joined by humanities and sciences and engineering."
Miller also sees his school's participation as "an
important extension of the Business School's activities in
public sector management."
Closely associated with HSA from its earliest
conceptual stages are Business Prof. John Moore and
Medical Prof. John C. Hershey.
