# 450 Walk To Lyman Home
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Protesters, numbering up to 450,
marched to the campus home of
President Richard W. Lyman last
night. Most dispersed after
unsuccessfully demanding that Lyman
come out to speak to them about the
drastic escalation of the Vietnam War.
During the evening, there were also
several minor arson attempts and a few
reports of broken windows.
The newly-elected Council of
Presidents has called a "general
meeting of the student body" today at
noon in White Plaza to discuss the
escalation.
At least nine riot-equipped Sheriffs
Deputies were standing outside the
Lou Henry Hoover house as the
marchers climbed the steep hill to the
presidential residence. There were no
confrontations between the police line
and the demonstrators.
The protesters chanted "We want
Lyman" and demanded that he come
out to talk with them. A delegation
requested that Lyman allowed them in
for a conference. But Marvin
Herrington, campus security director,
brought back word that the president
was "not available for comment."
Meeting
The crowd arrived at 10.20 p.m.
after marching up Campus Drive and
Mayfield from a meeting near Stern
Hall. Most demonstrators had left 45
minutes later.
Lyman was at home during the
demonstration, and went to sleep soon
after. Jing Lyman, his wife, said the
president did not come outside to
discuss the war because "it didn't seem
it would prove anything. Everybody
knows where he stands anyway."

The scattered reports of damage on
campus included three small fires,
several false alarms, and some broken
windows at the bookstore. A chair was
burned and a classroom wall was
singed in an arson attempt at the
Business School. An apparent gasoline
fire was extinguished outside a
telephone equipment building, and a
trash container burned behind the
bookstore.
Affinity Groups
Some small affinity groups marched
around campus after leaving the
protest at Lyman's house. Santa Clara
County Sheriff's deputies, campus
security, and Palo Alto Police
patrolled the campus.
The evening's protests began with
an hour meeting of about 200
protesters at the Donner dormitory
lounge. The group broke up for forty
mirfutes in an attempt to recruit
supporters in dormitories, then met
again and voted for the march to
Lyman's house.
Throughout the evening there were
spirited and sometimes bitter debates
about a choice of protest tactics. More
militant demonstrators, including
members of Venceremos,
unsuccessfully urged the crowd to
occupy Encina Hall or to carry the
protest to the ROTC military training
building.
David Josephson, ASSU Guest
Professor, first suggested the march to
Lyman's house during the Serra
meeting.
'Tantrum'
Lenny Siegel urged using a variety
of tactics to "throw a tantrum" to
show President Nixon "there will be
no peace in the US until there is peace

in Vietnam."
Proposals from various participants
in the Serra meeting included a march
around campus, trashing, a blockade
today of Moffett Field or Alameda
Naval station, and civil disobedience in
the Stanford Industrial Park.
Urging students to picket the
Physical Plant, Enid Hunkeler said that
the workers there "are not for the
war" and want picketers to block
trucks from making deliveries.
The Serra meeting began just an
hour after Nixon finished his televised
announcement of the escalation.

In Berkeley, about 500
demonstrators last night set fire to a
police car during a torchlight march,
and demolished the chain-link fence
around "People's Park." Police
reported scattered trashing and several
arrests.
Sheriff's deputies rerouted traffic

Affinity Groups
Some small affinity groups marched
around campus after leaving the
protest at Lyman's house. Santa Clara
County Sheriff's deputies, campus
security, and Palo Alto Police
patrolled the campus.
The evening's protests began with
an hour meeting of about 200
protesters at the Donner dormitory
lounge. The group broke up for forty
mirfutes in an attempt to recruit
supporters in dormitories, then met
again and voted for the march to
Lyman's house.
Throughout the evening there were
spirited and sometimes bitter debates
about a choice of protest tactics. More
militant demonstrators, including
members of Venceremos,
unsuccessfully urged the crowd to
occupy Encina Hall or to carry the
protest to the ROTC military training
building.
David Josephson, ASSU Guest
Professor, first suggested the march to
Lyman's house during the Serra
meeting.
'Tantrum'
Lenny Siegel urged using a variety
of tactics to "throw a tantrum" to
show President Nixon "there will be
no peace in the US until there is peace

in Vietnam."
Proposals from various participants
in the Serra meeting included a march
around campus, trashing, a blockade
today of Moffett Field or Alameda
Naval station, and civil disobedience in
the Stanford Industrial Park.
Urging students to picket the
Physical Plant, Enid Hunkeler said that
the workers there "are not for the
war" and want picketers to block
trucks from making deliveries.
The Serra meeting began just an
hour after Nixon finished his televised
announcement of the escalation.

In Berkeley, about 500
demonstrators last night set fire to a
police car during a torchlight march,
and demolished the chain-link fence
around "People's Park." Police
reported scattered trashing and several
arrests.
Sheriff's deputies rerouted traffic
after demonstrators blocked U.S. 101
in Santa Barbara. Up to 3000 people
began the ten-mile march to Santa
Barbara from the University of
California campus in Isla Vista,
according to campus radio station
KCSB.
In the East, club-swinging
policemen twice charged into a band
of 600 Columbia University protesters
as they marched down Broadway in
New York City. In Oxford, Ohio, an
estimated 2000 Miami University
students blocked the city's main
street, and about 350 Princeton
University students burned Nixon in
effigy.
In New Haven, Connecticut, about
600 persons marched from the Yale
University campus.
Protesters, numbering up to 450,
marched to the campus home of
President Richard W. Lyman last
night. Most dispersed after
unsuccessfully demanding that Lyman
come out to speak to them about the
drastic escalation of the Vietnam War.
During the evening, there were also
several minor arson attempts and a few
reports of broken windows.
The newly-elected Council of
Presidents has called a "general
meeting of the student body" today at
noon in White Plaza to discuss the
escalation.
At least nine riot-equipped Sheriffs
Deputies were standing outside the
Lou Henry Hoover house as the
marchers climbed the steep hill to the
presidential residence. There were no
confrontations between the police line
and the demonstrators.
The protesters chanted "We want
Lyman" and demanded that he come
out to talk with them. A delegation
requested that Lyman allowed them in
for a conference. But Marvin
Herrington, campus security director,
brought back word that the president
was "not available for comment."
Meeting
The crowd arrived at 10.20 p.m.
after marching up Campus Drive and
Mayfield from a meeting near Stern
Hall. Most demonstrators had left 45
minutes later.
Lyman was at home during the
demonstration, and went to sleep soon
after. Jing Lyman, his wife, said the
president did not come outside to
discuss the war because "it didn't seem
it would prove anything. Everybody
knows where he stands anyway."

The scattered reports of damage on
campus included three small fires,
several false alarms, and some broken
windows at the bookstore. A chair was
burned and a classroom wall was
singed in an arson attempt at the
Business School. An apparent gasoline
fire was extinguished outside a
telephone equipment building, and a
trash container burned behind the
bookstore.
