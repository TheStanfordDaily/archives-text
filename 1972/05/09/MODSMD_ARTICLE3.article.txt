# Outrage, Fear Mark Reaction To Speech

President Nixon's decision to mine
the harbors of North Vietnam was
greeted last night with almost
unanimous fear, outrage and
unhappiness by campus political
scientists, historians and one
politician.
Congressman Paul N. (Pete)
McCloskey (R.-Portola Valley) told
about 200 people at a meeting in the
Junipero House Lounge last night that
"this incredible arrogance and
insolence on President Nixon's part"
must be met by organized work by
students.
"If the American people acquiesce
in this escalation, we will be no better
than the Germans who passively sat by
before the Second World War," he
said.
"The real question is do we kill
people for pride. Vietnamization is
clearly a failure, and Nixon is
manufacturing the fiction of an
invasion by North Vietnam, rather
than seeing that they are trying for the
reunification which they were
promised in 1956," McCloskey told
the Daily.
He urged the crowd to work to
force congressmen to pass an "end the
war" bill. McCloskey was originally
scheduled to address his campaign

workers at Junipero House last night,
but he spoke to a much larger group,
drastically expanded after Nixon's
speech.
Robert C. North, professor of
political science, said, "The war is
being escalated into a potentially
dangerous context. . . What worries
me is that it's very difficult to reverse
the escalation . . . That's what makes
me feel uneasy."
Lyman Van Slyke, associate
professor of history, said he is "more
frightened than I've been since 1962.
This is the biting of the bullet that was
logically involved in our policy since
1964-65, that we all sensed was going
to happen, but hoped to avoid or
finesse."
He said that China and its role was
"deliberately fuzzed" in Nixon's
speech. He predicted that China will
continue to supply North Vietnam
overland. Nixon "left very little room
for maneuver on the other side,"
Van Slyke declared.
Stefan Possony, senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution, was one of the few
University scholars to support Nixon's
move. He termed the mining "a
correct action." He said he had
personally advocated blocking
