# Barry, Cole Challenge McCloskey In Primary
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Incumbent Congressman Paul N.
(Pete) McCloskey, Jr. (R.-Portola
Valley) faces the most serious
challenge of his political career in the
form of primary opposition from
conservatives Dr. Royce M. Cole of
Palo Alto and Robert R. (Bob) Barry
of Woodside.
The three are seeking the
Republican nomination in the 17th
Congressional District in the June 6
primary. The district includes
Stanford, Palo Alto, Menlo Park,
Sunnyvale, Portola Valley, Atherton,
Woodside, La Honda, Sky Londa,
Pescadero, San Carlos, San Gregorio,
Hillsborough, and portions of
Mountain View, Belmont, Redwood
City, San Mateo, San Jose, Santa
Clara, Cupertino and Campbell.
Ever since McCloskey announced
his candidacy for re-election on March
10, his two opponents have charged
him with being a traitor to his party.
Barry has accused McCloskey of
"undermining the President and the
Republican Party."
Republican?
Soon after McCloskey endorsed
Senator George McGovern for the
Democratic presidential nomination,
Cole said, "Paul McCloskey no longer
has the right to call himself a
Republican. His endorsement of
George McGovern is a slap in the face
of every Republican in the nation."
Both of McCloskey's opponents say
they believe that the Congressman
plans to reregister as a Democrat and
that he "intends to do as much
damage as possible on his way out."
There may, in fact, be some truth
to Cole and Barrv's accusations.

McCloskey has said that if he loses the
primary election, "111 know I don't
belong in the Republican Party."
Drop Out
Although they share a common
resolve to defeat McCloskey, Barry
and Cole have bickered throughout the
campaign. One of their more serious
divisions came to light two weeks ago.
The San Jose Mercury revealed a
letter from Barry to two other
Republican leaders which purported to
outline an agreement between Barry
and Cole that one would drop out of

the race in favor of the other if one's
campaign appeared to be faltering.
Barry confirmed that such a deal
had been made, but Cole denied it. In
his statement regarding the deal, Barry
cited polls showing that he is leading
both McCloskey and Cole. He then
called upon Cole to drop out of the
race.
Cole said that there is "no deal at
all between the two of us" and added
he would not withdraw because "I've
obviously got the best campaign."
Saying that his own polls show him
to be ahead, Cole conceded that "it

might be fairly close if there are three
of us" in the race. Cole called upon
Barry to drop out, saying he would
win "handily" if Barry did so.
McCloskey Support
The question of endorsements and
bloc backing are playing a significant
part in the race.
McCloskey has been endorsed by
the AFL-ClO's Committee On Political
Education (COPE) and by District 508
of the Machinists Non-Partisan
Political League. He recently received
the "Distinguished Achievement
Award" from the Sierra Club, a
leading national conservation group.
McCloskey also has the backing of a
21-member committee calling itself
"Democrats for McCloskey." Heading
the committee are Palo Alto Mayor
Kirke Comstock and Dr. Russell V.A.
Lee, the founder of the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic.
Cole's Challenge
Although McCloskey also appears
to have a significant following at
Stanford, Cole claims that "the
students at Stanford arp becoming
disillusioned with McCloskey" because
he "seeks headlines and not real
solutions."
Cole's own candidacy began after
his endorsement by ERRIC (Election
of Responsible Republicans in
Congress). ERRIC was formed by local
conservatives to decide upon an
opponent for McCloskey.
The endorsement of Cole by the
California Republican Association
(CRA) has stirred considerable
controversy between Barry and Cole.
Cole claims to have the endorsement
of every CRA chapter in the 17th
District.

Barry calls this "a phony, one pack
of lies." He showed the Daily letters
from the Sunnyvale and Mission
City-Santa Clara CRA chapter
presidents saying that no
endorsements had been made, nor
were planned.
Barry says "Cole's credibility is the
issue in this campaign now." He called
this "most unfortunate."
Barry has also accused Cole of
hiring Jack Bacon Associates, "a Los
Angeles political operator with a
reputation for using 'political smear
technique' in running campaigns."
Barry said that Cole and Bacon
Associates have used "sleazy methods"
in the campaign.
Cole campaign manager Michael
Carrington denied Barry's accusations
and charged Barry with using "gross
distortion which is absolutely devoid
of fact" against Cole.
Politicans
Cole, 41, has served since 1969 as a
member of the Palo Alto Unified
School District Board of Trustees and
has been a physician at the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic since 1965. In 1968. he
was chairman of the Santa Clara

County Young Republicans. He now
serves on the Republican State Central
Committee.
Barry, 56, served three terms as a
Congressman from Yonkers, New
York before being defeated in 1964.
In 1966, having moved to Southern
California, Barry challenged the
then-Congressman John V. Tunney for
his seat, but was again defeated.
After the death of Congressman J.
Arthur Younger in 1967, Barry, who
had moved once again, joined
McCloskey and nine others in seeking
to fill the vacancy. Midway through
the campaign, Barry withdrew in favor
of Shirley Tpmple Black, who finished
second to McCloskey in the Nov. 14
special election. Barry placed last.
Barry contested McCloskey's
renomination in 1968, but was again
defeated. In 1970, Barry sought the
Republican nomination for U.S.
Senator, but was outdistanced by both
George Murphy and Norton Simon.
Support Nixon
Barry and Cole take similar stands
on the major issues of the day, usually
in disagreement with McCloskey's
views.
Regarding President Nixon's recent
re-escalation of the bombing in
Vietnam, Barry called it "a calculated
guess to stop the invasion" by the
North Vietnamese. He added that the
bombing "could end up saving lives"
and warned "if the North Vietnamese
ever conquer South Vietnam there will
be two million people slaughtered."
Cole said that he "supports the
President in his actions to discourage
further invasion." He said the North
Vietnamese offensive offered "a real

test for Vietnamization." Cole
remarked that the "South Vietnamese
troops have managed to forestall a
complete overrunning of the country."
Campaign Issues
McCloskey calls "for an immediate
termination of the American military
presence in Southeast Asia." In a visit
to Stanford, McCloskey said the
renewed bombing is "immoral and
unconscionable." His opposition to
the war was the major basis for his
abortive challenge to Nixon in the
presidential primaries.

Both Barry and Cole feel that the
major domestic issue is the economy,
whereas "Pete McCloskey's major
domestic concern has always been
protecting the environment," his
campaign literature declares.
Barry says he will "continue
restraint of the unearned wages
increase which have fueled the fires of
inflation." He feels that "wage
increases should be tied to
productivity increases." Barry and
Cole both call for "a balanced
budget."
