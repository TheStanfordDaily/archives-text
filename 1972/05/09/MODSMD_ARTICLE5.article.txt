## Nixon Does It Again 
### 
Outrage and disbelief don't come close to
expressing our anger and fear at President
Nixon's latest move in Vietnam. It's not even
escalation. It's a quantum jump of military
aggression which has forced a confrontation
of the world's major powers. And it has only
served to further involve us in a war Mr.
Nixon pledged he was getting us out of.
To blatantly provoke the People's Republic
of China, by ordering bombing raids in
Vietnam right up to the Chinese border, and
to provoke the Soviet Union, by threatening
to interfere with free shipping, are acts
completely inconsistent with any notion of
ending the fighting.
What can one say now about the insanity
of a policy which Lyndon Johnson and
company in their senseless escalation discard
ed as too extreme?
What sort of sick mind is it that would
justify this most recent and dangerous

increase of violence with the tired cliche of
national honor?
For a country that has bombed the people
of Vietnam so heavily that the craters could
stretch around the world, and in order to
protect a corrupt dictatorship, the time for
talking about national honor is past.
If Mr. Nixon is really concerned about
national honor, he should get us out of
Vietnam immediately and completely, before
one more bomb is dropped, or one more
person killed.
Mr. Nixon also claims his actions serve to
protect American troops and POW's still in
Vietnam. Nonsense.
North Vietnam has promised to return all
POW's. All we have to do is disengage from
the south. And needless to say, our remaining
troops would be a lot safer in Philadelphia and
San Francisco and Dallas than they are in
Pleiku with Haiphong mined.

Mr. Nixon has stressed the importance of
supporting one's allies. Then how can he
really think Russia and China will accept
being forced to abandon their ally?
We hoped Mr. Nixon had learned; we
hoped that he recognized that the American
people want us to get out of Indochina now;
we hoped he had enough moral fiber left to
recognize the total stupidity and immorality
of that war and to get out. He obviously has
not.
In his speech the President has once again
called for the support of the American people.
We must show him our support, and show him
that that support is behind bringing the troops
home now and ending the insanity his
administration has multiplied. We must show
that support so strongly that we finally turn
the slogan "Peace Now" into a reality. If we
don't, in the words of Paul Ehrlich "I'm sorry
for us all."
