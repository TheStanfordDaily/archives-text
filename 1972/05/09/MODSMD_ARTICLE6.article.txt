# Nixon's proposal
## VAT â€” Dangerous Swindle 
###

(This is the second of two articles
on the Value-Added Tax (VAT).
The first appeared in the Daily on
Thursday, May 4.)
Let us delve more deeply into
the specific nature of the VAT. A
given percentage (the Nixon
Administration proposal is 3 per
cent) is levied, not on retail sales,
but on the sales of each stage of
production, with the business firm
deducting from its liability the tax
embodied in the purchases that it
makes from previous stages. It is
thus a sales tax hidden at each
stage of production, from the
farmer or miner down to the
retailer.
A 'Regressive' Tax
The most common criticism is
that the VAT, like the sales tax, is
a "regressive" tax, falling largely
on the poor and the middle class,
who pay a greater percentage of
their income than the rich. This is
a proper and important criticism,
especially coming at a time when
the middle class is already
suffering from an excruciating tax
burden.
The Nixon Administration
proposes to alleviate the burden
on the poor by rebating the taxes
through the income tax. While
this may alleviate the tax burden
on the poor, the middle class,
which pays most of our taxes
anyway, will hardly be benefited.
Furthermore, there is a more
sinister element in the rebate
plan: for some of the poor will get
cash payments from the IRS,
thereby bringing in the disastrous
principle of the guaranteed annual
income through the back door.
But the VAT is in many ways
far worse than a sales tax, apart
from its hidden and clandestine
nature. In the first place, the VAT
advocates claim that since each
firm and stage of production will
pay in proportion to its "value
added" to production, there will
be no misallocation effects along
the way.
Hut this ignores the fact that
every business firm will be
burdened bv the cost of

innumerable record-keeping and
collection for the government.
The result will be an inexorable
push of the business system
toward "vertical mergers" and the
reduction of competition.
Suppose, for example, that a
crude oil producer adds the value
of $1,000, and that an oil refiner
adds another $I,OPO, and suppose
for simplicity that the VAT is 10
per cent. Theoretically, it should
make no difference if the firms
are separate or "integrated"; in
the former case, each firm would
pay $100 to the government; in
the 4atter, the integrated firm
would pay $200. But since this
comforting theory ignores the
substantial costs of record-keeping
and collection, in practice if the
crude oil firm and the oil refiner
were integrated into one firm,
making only one payment, their
costs would be lower.
Vertical Mergers
Hence, vertical mergers will be
induced by the VAT, after which
the Anti-Trust Division of the
Department of Justice would
begin to clamor that the free
market is producing "monopoly"
and that the merger must be
broken by government fiat.
The costs of record-keeping
and payment pose another grave
problem for the market economy.
Obviously, small firms are less
able to bear these costs than big
ones, and so the VAT will be a
powerful burden on small
business, and hamper it gravely in
the competitive struggle. It is no
wonder that some big businesses
look with favor on the VAT!
There is another grave problem
with VAT, a problem that the
Western European countries
which have adopted VAT are
already struggling with.
Cheating
In the VAT, every firm sends
its invoices to the federal
government, and gets credit for
the VAT embodied in its invoices
for goods bought from other
firms. The result is an irresistible
opening for cheating, and in
Western Europe there are special

firms whose business is to write
out fake invoices which can
reduce the tax liabilities of their
"customers." Those businesses
more willing to cheat will then be
favored in the competitive
struggle of the market.
A further crucial flaw exists in
the VAT, a flaw which will bring
much grief to our economic
system. Most people assume that
such a tax will simply be passed
on in higher prices to the
consumer. But the process is not
that simple. While, in the long
run, prices to consumers will
undoubtedly rise, there will be
two other important effects: a
large short-run reduction in
business profits, and a long-run
fall in wage incomes.
The critical blow to profits,
while perhaps only "short-run,"
will take place at a time of
business recession, when many
firms and industries are suffering
from low profits and even from
business losses. The low-profit
firms and industries will be
severely hit by the imposition of
VAT, and the result will be to
cripple any possible recovery and
plunge us deeper into recession.
Furthermore, new and creative
firms, which usually begin small
and with lo\y profits, will be
similarly crippled before they
have scarcely begun.
The VAT will also have a
severe, and so far unacknowl
edged, effect in aggravating
unemployment, which is already
at a high recession rate. The
grievous impact on
unemployment will be two-fold.
In the first place, any firm that
buys, say, machinery, can deduct
the embodied VAT from its own
tax liability; but if it hires workers,
it can make no such deduction.
The result will be to spur
over-mechanization and the firing
of laborers.
Unemployment
Secondly, part of the long-run
effect of VAT will be to lower the
demand for labor and wage
incomes; but since unions and the
minimum wage laws are able to

keep wage rates up indefinitely,
the impact will be a rise in
unemployment. Thus, from two
separate and compounding
directions, VAT will aggravate an
already serious unemployment
problem.
One of Parkinson's justly
famous "laws" is that, for
government, "expenditure rises to
meet income." If we allow the
government to find and exploit
new sources of tax funds, it will
simply use those funds to spend
more and more, and aggravate the
already fearsome burden of Big
Government on the American
economy and the American
citizen.
The only way to reduce Big
Government is to cut its tax
revenue, and to force it to stay
within its more limited means. We
must see to it that government has
less tax funds to play with, not
more. The first step on this road
to lesser government and greater
freedom is to see the VAT for the
swindle that it is, and to send it
down to defeat.
