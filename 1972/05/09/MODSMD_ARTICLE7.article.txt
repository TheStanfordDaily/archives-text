Bangladesh
Editor, THE DAILY:
As this month draws to a close
a disaster looms larger and ever
uglier in Bangladesh. In June,
millions of Bengalis will suffer.
The skies will dump unending
deluges on millions without
shelter. Diseases like cholera will
spread from pool to pool infecting
people with nowhere to go. Those
very same people will watch the
rains flood and wash away the
little roads that connect them to
relief supplies of food. Then
they'll starve to death.
This will happen within the
next 8 weeks as surely as the fact
that you are reading this, unless
people in the U.S. learn of what's
ahead in the very near future.
Unless the news media tell
Americans that around a million
people are expected to starve to
death before July, organizations
such as UNICEF, CARE,
OXFAM, etc. might as well
whistle in a hurricane for relief
contributions.
People can contribute directly
to any of the organizations
mentioned or to the Emergency
Relief Fund, Inc., co-chaired by
the former Ambassador to India,
Hon. Chester Bowles and the
former Ford Foundation Director
for India, Pakistan, and Nepal, Dr.
Douglas Ensminger. If anyone
wants recent and accurate
information on the debacle that is
Bangladesh, Emergency Relief
Fund's "Airlift of Understanding"
participants will talk to their
group. ERF may be contacted at
36 Marguarite, Mill Valley, CA

Ventures
Editor, THE DAILY:
I cannot begin to express my
contempt for outfits such as
Ventures which advertised trips
into the Sierra or Lassen in your
May 5 issue.
Such commercial exploitation
of our wilderness is contradictory
to the spirit of conservation and
oneness with nature. The national
parks belong to all of us and
should not — must not — be used
for private profit.
It appears that Ventures is

more interested in hustling a few
bucks than in providing an
enjoyable and meaningful
wilderness experience. Nobody,
but nobody, who has had little
mountain experience should begin
with a three weeks backpacking
trip. Under such circumstances,
what are usually minor irritations
such as strains or blisters can turn
such a trip into a nightmare.
Save your money and join the
Sierra Club. They give courses
designed for every level of
experience on wilderness
know-how, survival,
mountaineering, and you can get
plenty of advice on what
equipment to buy. They also
organize trips for the beginner or
expert at a fraction of the cost of
the Venture trips!
Most importantly, however,
the Sierra Club is dedicated to the
enjoyment and preservation of the
wilderness — not its exploitation.

C-15
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Daily Editorial May 5
regarding the C-15 walkout relied
on my short phone conversation
and what I "implied," rather than
on the varying views of others
who voted against a student
dominated system. Thus the Daily
failed to ascertain arguments for
the 4-1 student majority which
C-15 approved for Honor Code
violations. I opposed the Honor
Code proposal initially, although
in the spirit of compromise before
the walkout, I stated that I would
later vote in favor, which I did.
The Daily should have contacted
those who favored the proposal
on the merits.
Furthermore, the Daily might
have avoided stating erroneously
that under the proposed judicial
system the Chairman would be
allowed to vote in all cases, not
just when a tie occurred. I know
of no one on the C-15 who
supports that position.
The Editorial incorrectly labels
the vote as an "insult;" the
reasoning would make a vote for a
student panel equally "insulting"
to the faculty. I believe that a
closely balanced panel is essential
in all cases, since both faculty and
student interests are affected. The
current CJP system, which has

such a balance, is efficient and
fair, far superior to anything
before it. The vote which led to
the walkout merely retained that
successful formula. Not once have
I heard C-15 members attack the
current balance on the merits; it is
blindly opposed "because there's
no student majority."
Students should not be swayed
by the Daily's emotional pitch in
deciding whether the walkout
makes sense. The C-15 cannot
impose any system; it only makes
suggestions. C-15 handles difficult
issues, making full agreement on
every matter impossible.
Recommendations on important
matters will soon be forthcoming.
If the referendum passes, student
representatives will be absent,
even when vital student rights are
at issue.

DoD Research
(Editor's Note: This letter was
sent to Sen. Mike Mansfield.)
I found your comments in the
March 30 Congressional Record
concerning our report, DoD
Sponsored Research at Stanford,
excellent. I fully support your
request to Secretary Laird asking
him to require "at a minimum
that the principal investigator
conducting the research ... be
required at the least to acquiesce
in the relevance of his research as
determined by the Department of
Defense as required by the
so-called Mansfield ammendment
which is now part of the
permanent law."
I would go a step beyond your
request and try to include it in the
permanent law. Also, the law
should include a provision that
requires the principal investigator
to show all students supported by
his contract the approved
statement of military relevance.
These steps would improve the
efficiency with which DoD
research is undertaken as well as
help those students who wish to
avoid it do so. It would also go a
long way towards returning
intellectual honesty to our
universities.
