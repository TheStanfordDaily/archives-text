## If Necessary, Vote Absentee

The California Primary
Election will be held on June 6.
Final exams will be held from
June 2 to June 7. If you have
registered to vote, then you must
vote in the precinct where your
residence, as stated by you on
your registration affadavit, is
located. If you are not going to be
at your place of residence on June
6, because of exams or for some
other reasons, then you will not
be able to vote unless you obtain

an absentee ballot.
Absent ballots allow you to
vote in an election when you do
not expect to be present in your
precinct on the day of the
election. The absentee ballot can
be obtained on request from the
Registrar of Voters of the county
of your residence.
Each registered voter should
receive a sample ballot package
from the Registrar of Voters two
or three weeks prior to the
election. This sample ballot tells
you where your precinct voting
place is located and provides you
with a list of all of the candidates
and propositions to be voted on in
the June Primary.
In addition, the sample ballot
package should contain a form for

requesting an absentee ballot. Fill
this form out if you are unsure
where you will be on June 6 and
return it to the Registrar of
Voters to get your absentee
ballot.
If you do not receive a sample
ballot package by May 20, then
either call the Registrar of Voters
at 299-2161 or write to him at 45
W. St. James St., San Jose, and
ask for a sample ballot and an
absentee ballot. The last day for
requesting an absentee ballot is
May 30.
If you are not registered to
vote at this time, you will not be
allowed to register until after the
June Primary. But once June 6
has passed, go to a firehouse, or to
city hall, or to the League of

Women Voters, or to the
Registrar's Office and register.
There are 25 million people
between the ages of 18 and 25
who have the right to vote for the
first time. This is one of the
largest additions of new eligible
voters in the history of the
country. The small act of voting
strikes more fear in the hearts of
politicians than any other act. If
you will register to vote and then
take the time to cast your ballot,
you can help to change this
country. It is not very exciting or
glamorous, but it is real and it is
effective.
Primaries Important
There is a catch. The right to
vote doesn't mean a great deal if
you must choose between two
unsatisfactory candidates. The
primaries decide who will be the
candidates in the general election
in November. Because most
districts are gerrymandered to
protect incumbents, the general
election is many times settled in
the primary. And because so few
people become involved in the
primary campaigns, one or two
individuals can make a
tremendous difference. If there is
a primary fight in your district,
find out about it and get involved.
The opportunity is here and
now. If you care about what is
happening to our country and our
world, then take a Saturday
afternoon and walk a precinct or
seal envelopes or make phone
calls. Good people are out there
working for you and they need
your help.
