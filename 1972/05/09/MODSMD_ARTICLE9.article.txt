## C—15 Student Position Endorsed 
### 
Solomon feferman

Last Tuesday, May 2nd, the
Committee of 15 voted 8-7 for a
faculty majority in the jury stage
of a new student disciplinary
system. The negative votes were
cast by the six student members
and myself. In my work last year
and this on C-15, I have
consistently supported what I saw
as legitimate and reasonable
requests by the students for
greater equity and a stronger voice
in their own discipline. I am more
troubled than disappointed by the
vote on this important issue. I
think the background to the vote
and its outcome raise serious
questions about the position of
students in the University
community and the state of the
community more generally.
Our work this year was
concerned with the student and
administration requests for
amendments to the Judicial
Charter, which required us to
reconsider the whole judicial
system. We proceeded carefully to
examine each aspect of such a
system and the many alternative
arguments and solutions. But
from the outset, the students'
request according to their
referendum, to give serious
consideration to a reciprocal
student-faculty system was
brushed aside, so that jurisdiction
continued to be restricted to
students (I'll return to this later).
In line with the student
referendum, this left them only an
all-student system to support. One
way in which this might be spelled
out was presented to us by Hayes,
MacNeece and Bradley. Their
scheme showed that flexibility
and realism could be accomodated
within the general spirit of the
referendum.
Important Concession
When the Committee started
voting at the end of April, the
students made an important
concession to the administration
in its concern for efficiency, by
agreeing to the use of hearing
officers in the fact-finding stage.
On Thursday, April 27, we
proceeded to deal with the
question of composition of a jury
for finding guilt and setting
penalties. The students began by
proposing an all-student jury, but
finally moderated this to include a

faculty chairman and other
representative. Two members of
C-15 were not present; a 7-6 vote
in favor of a heavily student
majority jury could have been
obtained at that moment. But it
was tacitly recognized that this
was a matter on which all
members of the Committee
should be heard, and that a
sharply divided vote would not be
satisfactory for anybody. At that
point, I still had some hopes for a
compromise which would bring
the Committee closer together.
On Tuesday, May 2nd, a
counter proposal was made for a
jury with a 5-4 faculty majority
and faculty chairman. Step by
step the students and I moved
down to accept a composition on
which the students would have a
one-vote majority. At no point
did the other members budge.
They were not troubled about the
possibility of future difficulties in
getting student body agreement
on this sytem. The view stated
was that most students are
apathetic about the questions of
the judicial structure, therefore
the Committee need not be
concerned. When a proposal to
table was turned down and the
8-7 vote followed, the student
members left the meeting.
Against Students
Here were some of the
arguments which were made
against a student-majority system.
Students are transient; they don't
have to live with the future
consequences of their actions.
They are more subject to
peer-pressure and intimidation
than faculty. Their judgment is
not as mature. They can't be
relied on to bring in convictions in
the politically difficult cases. Most
do not want to take on this kind
of responsibility and those that do
can't be depended on to carry
through. (Incidentally, it is
recognized that student
participation in C-15 has been
exemplary in terms of investment
of time and work and in its
seriousness. In addition, the
proposal of Hayes-MacNeece-
Bradley was valued for the
thought and care which were
given to its preparation.)
Besides all this, it was argued
that the present interim CJP

system has proved to be fair and
needs only moderate
improvements. Why give up
something good for something
unknown? The ASSU Senate
action last fall in refusing .to
continue its obligations under the
Judicial Charter was frequently
cited as an example of student
irresponsibility. It is ironical that
this action permitted the
administration to institute the
CJP, thereby eliminating what it
saw as serious defects in the SJC
without having to make any
concessions to the students. Now
they are being asked to legitimize
the CJP.
Additional Issues
How important is this issue of
jury composition? There are still
the further student requests to
consider, namely, those
concerning individual rights and
the President's role. Sympathy has
been indicated in our Committee
toward some of these. In addition,
a new proposal has been made to
the students which might give
them a chance to exercise some
significant say — namely that they
constitute the majority on honor
code cases. The students cannot
lightly cast off this opportunity to
further influence the work of the
Committee. But last Tuesday
night's vote was psychologically
crucial, for it expresses at best
extremely limited confidence in
the students. I think it is quite
proper at this moment for the
student members of the
Committee to return to their
constituency to find out whether
there is a significant consensus to
be represented. If the C-15
majority is right, it will put in
question the value of further
student contributions. If not, now
is the time to demonstrate that
convincingly.
One of the arguments made for
faculty representation at all on a
student disciplinary set-up is that
the behavior of students directly
affects the faculty and they have
interests at stake. In response, it
was argued on the same grounds
that the students have a stake in
faculty discipline, and this was
not disputed. But it was stated in
C-15 that there has been no
suggestion of interest in a
reciprocal system on the part of
faculty in its own recent
deliberations on self-discipline. It
is clear that there would be many
difficulties in connection with
such a system.
But a reasonable case can be
made that there is a wide class of
offenses (for example, against the
Disruption Policy) which are not
specifically related to different
roles of the members of this
community, and which affect all
and should be judged by all.
Indeed the Faculty Senate had
originally proposed placing itself
under the SJC for violations of
the Disruption Policy. I was very
disappointed that no effort was
made to re-explore such
possibilities. At the very least the
faculty owed C-15 a statement of
its thinking on this matter; even
better would have been an
exchange of views.
Common Concerns
This raises a wider issue. There

are undoubted obstacles to
achieving a "sense of community"
at Stanford, considering the
variety of backgrounds and
involvements of its members.
Nevertheless there are a number
of common concerns, and there
should be some means of dealing
with these together. Instead, the
constituencies have become
progressively more separated and
polarized. Among all of these, the
students have been most
powerless. Neither the
administration nor the faculty has
been particularly sympathetic to
their demands. What seems to me
to be sorely needed is a forum for
each of us to listen to and really
hear and deal with what the
others are saying.
The experience of Princeton
(among other universities) might
be well worth studying in this
direction. Three years ago it

established a "Council of the
Princeton University
Community," a joint body in
addtion to its various faculty,
staff and student councils, whose
purpose is to "consider and
investigate any question of
University policy, any aspect of
the governing of the University,
and any general issue related to
the welfare of the University" and
"to make recommendations
regarding any such matters to the
appropriate decision-making
bodies of the University or to the
appropriate officers of the
University." The kind of skill that
went into designing the Faculty
Senate could also lead to a
successful such body at Stanford.

Last Tuesday, May 2nd, the
Committee of 15 voted 8-7 for a
faculty majority in the jury stage
of a new student disciplinary
system. The negative votes were
cast by the six student members
and myself. In my work last year
and this on C-15, I have
consistently supported what I saw
as legitimate and reasonable
requests by the students for
greater equity and a stronger voice
in their own discipline. I am more
troubled than disappointed by the
vote on this important issue. I
think the background to the vote
and its outcome raise serious
questions about the position of
students in the University
community and the state of the
community more generally.
Our work this year was
concerned with the student and
administration requests for
amendments to the Judicial
Charter, which required us to
reconsider the whole judicial
system. We proceeded carefully to
examine each aspect of such a
system and the many alternative
arguments and solutions. But
from the outset, the students'
request according to their
referendum, to give serious
consideration to a reciprocal
student-faculty system was
brushed aside, so that jurisdiction
continued to be restricted to
students (I'll return to this later).
In line with the student
referendum, this left them only an
all-student system to support. One
way in which this might be spelled
out was presented to us by Hayes,
MacNeece and Bradley. Their
scheme showed that flexibility
and realism could be accomodated
within the general spirit of the
referendum.
Important Concession
When the Committee started
voting at the end of April, the
students made an important
concession to the administration
in its concern for efficiency, by
agreeing to the use of hearing
officers in the fact-finding stage.
On Thursday, April 27, we
proceeded to deal with the
question of composition of a jury
for finding guilt and setting
penalties. The students began by
proposing an all-student jury, but
finally moderated this to include a

faculty chairman and other
representative. Two members of
C-15 were not present; a 7-6 vote
in favor of a heavily student
majority jury could have been
obtained at that moment. But it
was tacitly recognized that this
was a matter on which all
members of the Committee
should be heard, and that a
sharply divided vote would not be
satisfactory for anybody. At that
point, I still had some hopes for a
compromise which would bring
the Committee closer together.
On Tuesday, May 2nd, a
counter proposal was made for a
jury with a 5-4 faculty majority
and faculty chairman. Step by
step the students and I moved
down to accept a composition on
which the students would have a
one-vote majority. At no point
did the other members budge.
They were not troubled about the
possibility of future difficulties in
getting student body agreement
on this sytem. The view stated
was that most students are
apathetic about the questions of
the judicial structure, therefore
the Committee need not be
concerned. When a proposal to
table was turned down and the
8-7 vote followed, the student
members left the meeting.
Against Students
Here were some of the
arguments which were made
against a student-majority system.
Students are transient; they don't
have to live with the future
consequences of their actions.
They are more subject to
peer-pressure and intimidation
than faculty. Their judgment is
not as mature. They can't be
relied on to bring in convictions in
the politically difficult cases. Most
do not want to take on this kind
of responsibility and those that do
can't be depended on to carry
through. (Incidentally, it is
recognized that student
participation in C-15 has been
exemplary in terms of investment
of time and work and in its
seriousness. In addition, the
proposal of Hayes-MacNeece-
Bradley was valued for the
thought and care which were
given to its preparation.)
Besides all this, it was argued
that the present interim CJP

system has proved to be fair and
needs only moderate
improvements. Why give up
something good for something
unknown? The ASSU Senate
action last fall in refusing .to
continue its obligations under the
Judicial Charter was frequently
cited as an example of student
irresponsibility. It is ironical that
this action permitted the
administration to institute the
CJP, thereby eliminating what it
saw as serious defects in the SJC
without having to make any
concessions to the students. Now
they are being asked to legitimize
the CJP.
Additional Issues
How important is this issue of
jury composition? There are still
the further student requests to
consider, namely, those
concerning individual rights and
the President's role. Sympathy has
been indicated in our Committee
toward some of these. In addition,
a new proposal has been made to
the students which might give
them a chance to exercise some
significant say — namely that they
constitute the majority on honor
code cases. The students cannot
lightly cast off this opportunity to
further influence the work of the
Committee. But last Tuesday
night's vote was psychologically
crucial, for it expresses at best
extremely limited confidence in
the students. I think it is quite
proper at this moment for the
student members of the
Committee to return to their
constituency to find out whether
there is a significant consensus to
be represented. If the C-15
majority is right, it will put in
question the value of further
student contributions. If not, now
is the time to demonstrate that
convincingly.
One of the arguments made for
faculty representation at all on a
student disciplinary set-up is that
the behavior of students directly
affects the faculty and they have
interests at stake. In response, it
was argued on the same grounds
that the students have a stake in
faculty discipline, and this was
not disputed. But it was stated in
C-15 that there has been no
suggestion of interest in a
reciprocal system on the part of
faculty in its own recent
deliberations on self-discipline. It
is clear that there would be many
difficulties in connection with
such a system.
But a reasonable case can be
made that there is a wide class of
offenses (for example, against the
Disruption Policy) which are not
specifically related to different
roles of the members of this
community, and which affect all
and should be judged by all.
Indeed the Faculty Senate had
originally proposed placing itself
under the SJC for violations of
the Disruption Policy. I was very
disappointed that no effort was
made to re-explore such
possibilities. At the very least the
faculty owed C-15 a statement of
its thinking on this matter; even
better would have been an
exchange of views.
Common Concerns
This raises a wider issue. There

are undoubted obstacles to
achieving a "sense of community"
at Stanford, considering the
variety of backgrounds and
involvements of its members.
Nevertheless there are a number
of common concerns, and there
should be some means of dealing
with these together. Instead, the
constituencies have become
progressively more separated and
polarized. Among all of these, the
students have been most
powerless. Neither the
administration nor the faculty has
been particularly sympathetic to
their demands. What seems to me
to be sorely needed is a forum for

C-15 that there has been no
suggestion of interest in a
reciprocal system on the part of
faculty in its own recent
deliberations on self-discipline. It
is clear that there would be many
difficulties in connection with
such a system.
But a reasonable case can be
made that there is a wide class of
offenses (for example, against the
Disruption Policy) which are not
specifically related to different
roles of the members of this
community, and which affect all
and should be judged by all.
Indeed the Faculty Senate had
originally proposed placing itself
under the SJC for violations of
the Disruption Policy. I was very
disappointed that no effort was
made to re-explore such
possibilities. At the very least the
faculty owed C-15 a statement of
its thinking on this matter; even
better would have been an
exchange of views.
Common Concerns
This raises a wider issue. There

are undoubted obstacles to
achieving a "sense of community"
at Stanford, considering the
variety of backgrounds and
involvements of its members.
Nevertheless there are a number
of common concerns, and there
should be some means of dealing
with these together. Instead, the
constituencies have become
progressively more separated and
polarized. Among all of these, the
students have been most
powerless. Neither the
administration nor the faculty has
been particularly sympathetic to
their demands. What seems to me
to be sorely needed is a forum for
each of us to listen to and really
hear and deal with what the
others are saying.
The experience of Princeton
(among other universities) might
be well worth studying in this
direction. Three years ago it

established a "Council of the
Princeton University
Community," a joint body in
addtion to its various faculty,
staff and student councils, whose
purpose is to "consider and
investigate any question of
University policy, any aspect of
the governing of the University,
and any general issue related to
the welfare of the University" and
"to make recommendations
regarding any such matters to the
appropriate decision-making
bodies of the University or to the
appropriate officers of the
University." The kind of skill that
went into designing the Faculty
Senate could also lead to a
successful such body at Stanford.

Last Tuesday, May 2nd, the
Committee of 15 voted 8-7 for a
faculty majority in the jury stage
of a new student disciplinary
system. The negative votes were
cast by the six student members
and myself. In my work last year
and this on C-15, I have
consistently supported what I saw
as legitimate and reasonable
requests by the students for
greater equity and a stronger voice
in their own discipline. I am more
troubled than disappointed by the
vote on this important issue. I
think the background to the vote
and its outcome raise serious
questions about the position of
students in the University
community and the state of the
community more generally.
Our work this year was
concerned with the student and
administration requests for
amendments to the Judicial
Charter, which required us to
reconsider the whole judicial
system. We proceeded carefully to
examine each aspect of such a
system and the many alternative
arguments and solutions. But
from the outset, the students'
request according to their
referendum, to give serious
consideration to a reciprocal
student-faculty system was
brushed aside, so that jurisdiction
continued to be restricted to
students (I'll return to this later).
In line with the student
referendum, this left them only an
all-student system to support. One
way in which this might be spelled
out was presented to us by Hayes,
MacNeece and Bradley. Their
scheme showed that flexibility
and realism could be accomodated
within the general spirit of the
referendum.
Important Concession
When the Committee started
voting at the end of April, the
students made an important
concession to the administration
in its concern for efficiency, by
agreeing to the use of hearing
officers in the fact-finding stage.
On Thursday, April 27, we
proceeded to deal with the
question of composition of a jury
for finding guilt and setting
penalties. The students began by
proposing an all-student jury, but
finally moderated this to include a

faculty chairman and other
representative. Two members of
C-15 were not present; a 7-6 vote
in favor of a heavily student
majority jury could have been
obtained at that moment. But it
was tacitly recognized that this
was a matter on which all
members of the Committee
should be heard, and that a
sharply divided vote would not be
satisfactory for anybody. At that
point, I still had some hopes for a
compromise which would bring
the Committee closer together.
On Tuesday, May 2nd, a
counter proposal was made for a
jury with a 5-4 faculty majority
and faculty chairman. Step by
step the students and I moved
down to accept a composition on
which the students would have a
one-vote majority. At no point
did the other members budge.
They were not troubled about the
possibility of future difficulties in
getting student body agreement
on this sytem. The view stated
was that most students are
apathetic about the questions of
the judicial structure, therefore
the Committee need not be
concerned. When a proposal to
table was turned down and the
8-7 vote followed, the student
members left the meeting.
Against Students
Here were some of the
arguments which were made
against a student-majority system.
Students are transient; they don't
have to live with the future
consequences of their actions.
They are more subject to
peer-pressure and intimidation
than faculty. Their judgment is
not as mature. They can't be
relied on to bring in convictions in
the politically difficult cases. Most
do not want to take on this kind
of responsibility and those that do
can't be depended on to carry
through. (Incidentally, it is
recognized that student
participation in C-15 has been
exemplary in terms of investment
of time and work and in its
seriousness. In addition, the
proposal of Hayes-MacNeece-
Bradley was valued for the
thought and care which were
given to its preparation.)
Besides all this, it was argued
that the present interim CJP

system has proved to be fair and
needs only moderate
improvements. Why give up
something good for something
unknown? The ASSU Senate
action last fall in refusing .to
continue its obligations under the
Judicial Charter was frequently
cited as an example of student
irresponsibility. It is ironical that
this action permitted the
administration to institute the
CJP, thereby eliminating what it
saw as serious defects in the SJC
without having to make any
concessions to the students. Now
they are being asked to legitimize
the CJP.
Additional Issues
How important is this issue of
jury composition? There are still
the further student requests to
consider, namely, those
concerning individual rights and
the President's role. Sympathy has
been indicated in our Committee
toward some of these. In addition,
a new proposal has been made to
the students which might give
them a chance to exercise some
significant say — namely that they
constitute the majority on honor
code cases. The students cannot
lightly cast off this opportunity to
further influence the work of the
Committee. But last Tuesday
night's vote was psychologically
crucial, for it expresses at best
extremely limited confidence in
the students. I think it is quite
proper at this moment for the
student members of the
Committee to return to their
constituency to find out whether
there is a significant consensus to
be represented. If the C-15
majority is right, it will put in
question the value of further
student contributions. If not, now
is the time to demonstrate that
convincingly.
One of the arguments made for
faculty representation at all on a
student disciplinary set-up is that
the behavior of students directly
affects the faculty and they have
interests at stake. In response, it
was argued on the same grounds
that the students have a stake in
faculty discipline, and this was
not disputed. But it was stated in
C-15 that there has been no
suggestion of interest in a
reciprocal system on the part of
faculty in its own recent
deliberations on self-discipline. It
is clear that there would be many

the President's role. Sympathy has
been indicated in our Committee
toward some of these. In addition,
a new proposal has been made to
the students which might give
them a chance to exercise some
significant say — namely that they
constitute the majority on honor
code cases. The students cannot
lightly cast off this opportunity to
further influence the work of the
Committee. But last Tuesday
night's vote was psychologically
crucial, for it expresses at best
extremely limited confidence in
the students. I think it is quite
proper at this moment for the
student members of the
Committee to return to their
constituency to find out whether
there is a significant consensus to
be represented. If the C-15
majority is right, it will put in
question the value of further
student contributions. If not, now
is the time to demonstrate that
convincingly.
One of the arguments made for
faculty representation at all on a
student disciplinary set-up is that
the behavior of students directly
affects the faculty and they have
interests at stake. In response, it
was argued on the same grounds
that the students have a stake in
faculty discipline, and this was
not disputed. But it was stated in
C-15 that there has been no
suggestion of interest in a
reciprocal system on the part of
faculty in its own recent
deliberations on self-discipline. It
is clear that there would be many
difficulties in connection with
such a system.
But a reasonable case can be
made that there is a wide class of
offenses (for example, against the
Disruption Policy) which are not
specifically related to different
roles of the members of this
community, and which affect all
and should be judged by all.
Indeed the Faculty Senate had
originally proposed placing itself
under the SJC for violations of
the Disruption Policy. I was very
disappointed that no effort was
made to re-explore such
possibilities. At the very least the
faculty owed C-15 a statement of
its thinking on this matter; even
better would have been an
exchange of views.
Common Concerns
This raises a wider issue. There

are undoubted obstacles to
achieving a "sense of community"
at Stanford, considering the
variety of backgrounds and
involvements of its members.
Nevertheless there are a number
of common concerns, and there
should be some means of dealing
with these together. Instead, the
constituencies have become
progressively more separated and
polarized. Among all of these, the
students have been most
powerless. Neither the
administration nor the faculty has
been particularly sympathetic to
their demands. What seems to me
to be sorely needed is a forum for
each of us to listen to and really
hear and deal with what the
others are saying.
The experience of Princeton
(among other universities) might
be well worth studying in this
direction. Three years ago it

established a "Council of the
Princeton University
Community," a joint body in
addtion to its various faculty,
staff and student councils, whose
purpose is to "consider and
investigate any question of
University policy, any aspect of
the governing of the University,
and any general issue related to
the welfare of the University" and
"to make recommendations
regarding any such matters to the
appropriate decision-making
bodies of the University or to the
appropriate officers of the
University." The kind of skill that
went into designing the Faculty
Senate could also lead to a
successful such body at Stanford.

Last Tuesday, May 2nd, the
Committee of 15 voted 8-7 for a
faculty majority in the jury stage
of a new student disciplinary
system. The negative votes were
cast by the six student members
and myself. In my work last year
and this on C-15, I have
consistently supported what I saw
as legitimate and reasonable
requests by the students for
greater equity and a stronger voice
in their own discipline. I am more
troubled than disappointed by the
vote on this important issue. I
think the background to the vote
and its outcome raise serious
questions about the position of
students in the University
community and the state of the
community more generally.
Our work this year was
concerned with the student and
administration requests for
amendments to the Judicial
Charter, which required us to
reconsider the whole judicial
system. We proceeded carefully to
examine each aspect of such a
system and the many alternative
arguments and solutions. But
from the outset, the students'
request according to their
referendum, to give serious
consideration to a reciprocal
student-faculty system was
brushed aside, so that jurisdiction
continued to be restricted to
students (I'll return to this later).
In line with the student
referendum, this left them only an
all-student system to support. One
way in which this might be spelled
out was presented to us by Hayes,
MacNeece and Bradley. Their
scheme showed that flexibility
and realism could be accomodated
within the general spirit of the
referendum.
Important Concession
When the Committee started
voting at the end of April, the
students made an important
concession to the administration
in its concern for efficiency, by
agreeing to the use of hearing
officers in the fact-finding stage.
On Thursday, April 27, we
proceeded to deal with the
question of composition of a jury
for finding guilt and setting
penalties. The students began by
proposing an all-student jury, but
finally moderated this to include a

faculty chairman and other
representative. Two members of
C-15 were not present; a 7-6 vote
in favor of a heavily student
majority jury could have been
obtained at that moment. But it
was tacitly recognized that this
was a matter on which all
members of the Committee
should be heard, and that a
sharply divided vote would not be
satisfactory for anybody. At that
point, I still had some hopes for a
compromise which would bring
the Committee closer together.
On Tuesday, May 2nd, a
counter proposal was made for a
jury with a 5-4 faculty majority
and faculty chairman. Step by
step the students and I moved
down to accept a composition on
which the students would have a
one-vote majority. At no point
did the other members budge.
They were not troubled about the
possibility of future difficulties in
getting student body agreement
on this sytem. The view stated
was that most students are
apathetic about the questions of
the judicial structure, therefore
the Committee need not be
concerned. When a proposal to
table was turned down and the
8-7 vote followed, the student
members left the meeting.
Against Students
Here were some of the
arguments which were made
against a student-majority system.
Students are transient; they don't
have to live with the future
consequences of their actions.
They are more subject to
peer-pressure and intimidation
than faculty. Their judgment is
not as mature. They can't be
relied on to bring in convictions in
the politically difficult cases. Most
do not want to take on this kind
of responsibility and those that do
can't be depended on to carry
through. (Incidentally, it is
recognized that student
participation in C-15 has been
exemplary in terms of investment
of time and work and in its
seriousness. In addition, the
proposal of Hayes-MacNeece-
Bradley was valued for the
thought and care which were
given to its preparation.)
Besides all this, it was argued
that the present interim CJP

system has proved to be fair and
needs only moderate
improvements. Why give up
something good for something
unknown? The ASSU Senate
action last fall in refusing .to
continue its obligations under the
Judicial Charter was frequently
cited as an example of student
irresponsibility. It is ironical that
this action permitted the
administration to institute the
CJP, thereby eliminating what it
saw as serious defects in the SJC
without having to make any
concessions to the students. Now
they are being asked to legitimize
the CJP.
Additional Issues
How important is this issue of
jury composition? There are still
the further student requests to
consider, namely, those
concerning individual rights and
the President's role. Sympathy has
been indicated in our Committee
toward some of these. In addition,
a new proposal has been made to
the students which might give
them a chance to exercise some
significant say — namely that they
constitute the majority on honor
code cases. The students cannot
lightly cast off this opportunity to
further influence the work of the
Committee. But last Tuesday
night's vote was psychologically
crucial, for it expresses at best
extremely limited confidence in
the students. I think it is quite
proper at this moment for the
student members of the
Committee to return to their
constituency to find out whether
there is a significant consensus to
be represented. If the C-15
majority is right, it will put in
question the value of further
student contributions. If not, now
is the time to demonstrate that
convincingly.
