# Anti-War Demonstrators Battle Police

### BOB LITTERMAN 
Anti-war protesters roamed campus for two hours last
night battling police in street fighting marked by several
profuse rock barrages on charging police lines.
Several buildings had windows broken, one Stanford
patrol car was completely gutted, and several smaller fires
were set on University grounds.
Earlier in the day demonstrators picketed the physical
plant, and occupied the old union and the placement
center for five hours, taking furniture outside to form
barracades on all sides of White Plaza. Placement center
director Ralph Keller estimated damages to his building at
$4000 to $5000.
Today's planned activities include picketing at the
physical plant starting at 7 a.m., a strike meeting in the
women's center at 10 a.m., and a noon rally in White
Plaza. Protesters yesterday demanded that the University
be shut down tomorrow and Friday.
The street fighting last night was the most intense on
campus since the demonstrations two years ago following
the invasion of Cambodia.
Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies, as well as
officers from San Jose, Palo Alto and the city of Santa
Clara formed a 110-man force on campus. The number of
demonstrators ranged from a high of 400 who marched
out of an 8 p.m. White Plaza rally, to about 100 to 200 in
the group fighting police.
Nine persons, including six Stanford students, were
arrested in connection with last night's disturbances. They
were: Lee Louis Salt, a non-student and Jeffrey Charles
Johnston, a freshman, both charged with misdemeanor
rioting and malicious mischief, also a misdemeanor;
Also James Joseph Golden, a non-student; Raymond
Listchild Williams, a junior in economics; Glenn David
Kaiser, a sophomore; Timothy Warden Schweitzer, a
graduate in chemical engineering; and Warren Courtney
Wood, a freshman. Each of these five was charged with
felony conspiracy and felony assault and battery on a
peace officer;
Also Stephen Barry Haber, a sophomore in chemistry;
charged with obstructing a peace officer. And one juvenile
was charged with misdemeanor rioting and misdemeanor
unlawful assembly.
At least three injured demonstrators were treated last
night. One student was admitted to Cowell Student
Health Center with face lacerations. Two other persons
were admitted to the Stanford Hospital Emergency
Room, one with a broken ankle. Fifteen police officers
reportedly sustained minor injuries.
Stanford Public Safety Department Director Marvin
Herrington and University News and Publications Director
Bob Beyers also sustained minor injuries.
Authorities said that 23 fire alarms had been sounded,
and there were 16 attempted arsons. Two brush fires, a
dumpster fire and the gutting of a Stanford Public Safety
Department car were confirmed. A Molotov cocktail was
thrown at the Bookstore and a portion of the barricade

between the Old Union and was set ablaze.
Windows were reported broken at Encina Hall, the
Faculty Club, the Undergraduate Library, Bowman
Alumni House, the Bookstore, the Post Office and
Tresidder.
Stanford President Richard Lyman was unavailable for
comment last night, but Provost William Miller said, "I'm
really distressed by the trashing and by the
non-constructive aspects of the demonstration. It appears
to be unfocused and to be pointless. I think that efforts to
apply oneself to the elections process would be more
constructive."
The White Plaza rally which began the night's activities
included several speakers announcing activities across the
country' followed by a call for concrete proposals for
action. After several oblique references were made to
trashing or taking buildings, Don Lee suggested that
"People want to move that way," pointing in the
direction of Encina Hall.
At 9 p.m. the crowd marched from the plaza to the
front of Encina where about ten windows and two glass
doors were broken by rocks. Police made their first
appearance at this point, charging into the group near
Galvez and Serra Streets. The demonstrators then broke
into two groups moving both ways on Serra.

More photographs of these events appear on page 6.

The groups met in White Plaza about ten minutes later.
Police again charged, this time through the plaza chasing
demonstrators past Dinkelspiel Auditorium into the
Tresidder parking lot.
After regrouping there one speaker using a portable
microphone told the crowd they should stand up to
charging police by throwing rocks before running away.
Former English Professor H. Bruce Franklin told them not
to be "outpsyched" by the police, and to "keep your face
to them."
Moving back around on Campus Drive, the main group
headed toward the fields behind Wilbur and Stern dorms.
At the corner of Alvarado Row and Campus a group of
four riot equipped police following the crowd was
attacked with large rocks by several demonstrators. The
police retreated behind trees and bushes.
Regrouping at the corner of Galvez and Escondido, in
front of the Undergraduate Library, the crowd confronted
the armored jeep used by Sheriff's Lieutenant Don Tamm.
After a frontal barrage of rocks the jeep gunned through
the crowd and then retreated toward the bookstore.
Although repeatedly hit at close range the jeep was not
damaged.
A small tactical unit then charged the crowd causing
many to run into the library, but leaving a large group
outside which then attacked five officers who were left
standing in front alone.
The stranded unit was quickly reinforced, after which a

STRATEGIC WITHDRAWAL—The Sheriff's department armored jeep which carries Lieutenant Don Tamm is shown
making a hasty retreat last night following a foray through rock throwing demonstrators. The jeep, which has iron grill
over all windows and whose entire outside surface can be electrified, was not damaged by the heavy barrage of large
rocks, many at close range.
