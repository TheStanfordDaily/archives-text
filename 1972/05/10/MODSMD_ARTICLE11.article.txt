LONDON — A new type of
antipersonnel bomb dropped on
Hanoi by American aircraft is
causing severe medical problems
for the North Vietnamese,
according to a British consultant
physician who has just returned
from the northern capital.
The physician. Dr. Philip
Harvey, who works at St.
Stephens Hospital in London,
arrived in Hanoi on April 8 to
carry out an extensive medical
education program at the
invitation of the medical faculty
at Hanoi University. On Sunday,
April 16, a week after he arrived
60 U.S. aircraft bombed the city,
causing extensive damage to eight
residential districts.
Harvey said he visited one of
the areas about a kilometer from
his city center hotel and examine
some of the dead and wounded.
"I saw the body of
one woman — she was pregnant —
and she had been riddled with
plastic pellets from an
anti-personnel bomb," the doctor
said. This is a new development.

The pellets used to be metal but
now that they are using plastic it
is impossible to locate the pellets
by normal x-rays. They can be
found with the use of ultrasonic
vibrations but the North
Vietnamese do not have such
equipment." A full
ultrasonic-vibration unit costs
$50,000.
Harvey said that the pellets
penetrate the victims' bodies at
1,300 feet a second, creating heat
so intense that the flesh vaporizes.
'They can fracture a bone
without even making contact with
it,"he said. The wounded people
seen by Harvey all had multiple

penetrating wounds caused by
cubic pellets.
Harvey said six or seven
brick-built thatched houses had
been destroyed in the area he
visted. Two persons were killed
and eleven injured, five seriously.
Later two of the injured died, and
another two bodies were found in
the ruins. The bombs dropped
seemed to be an equal mixture of
high explosive and antipersonnel.
The latter, Harvey said, had no
effect on property or structures.
"I dug some pellets out of the
brickwork and they had only gone
in about a quarter of an inch."
