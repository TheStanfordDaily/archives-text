# Stanford China Campus?
## 
### 
A weekend in Canton, a field
trip to the Great Wall, and then it
is back to the STANFORD-IN
CHINA campus outside Peking.
Wishful thinking? Perhaps. But
the dream could very well become
reality in the near future,
although many bamboo curtains
still hang in the way.
"The idea sounds really great,"
exclaims Corb Smith, Assistant
Director of the Overseas
Campuses Program.
The first problem seems to be
student interest. To date there has
been no deluge of requests for a
STANFORD-IN-CHINA program.
"If students are interested in
setting up a campus somewhere
they could start bending the ears
of people who might have an
influence and are interested in
that particular campus," says
Smith.
In the past, the Committee on
Foreign Studies Programs, and the
Academic Planning and Overseas
Campus offices have been
involved with the establishment of
Stanford abroad programs. "I
personally would be very

interested in exploring ways to set
up some sort of program in China
for Stanford students," Smith
offers.
China to Agree?
There is much more to setting
up a campus than getting the
students to go. "I can imagine one
of the largest hassles would be
getting the government of the
People's Republic of China to
agree," says - Smith. "We'd
probably have to work through
the State Department but we
might be able to establish direct
contacts. In that case I'd
volunteer."
Robert A. Walker, Director of
the Overseas Campuses Program,
says that the "political problems
which interfered in Spain would
interfere with the establishment
of a Red China campus. Students
would not be free to move about
Red China and certain books
couldn't be imported."
Furthermore, he doubts "you
would get their approval. You'd
have great difficulty conducting
any educational program if it
went contrary to Maoist

thought." Walker admitted, "If
the exchange of persons at the
academic level opened up some,
we would consider establishing a
specialized program. From there
we could see how it would work
and perhaps expand the
program".
Lyman Introduction
In his introduction to
ping-pong matches among Chinese
players in Maples Pavilion,
President Lyman suggested that
"Stanford students will soon be
studying in China and learning
from the Chinese."
Ten years ago efforts toward
the formation of a program in
Japan were made by the
Committee of General Studies. It
was opposed, however, by the
Asian study specialists here and
the Dean of Undergraduate
studies turned it down.
Europe was a natural choice
for Stanford campuses abroad
because it is easily accessible and
it is the source of much of the
intellectual and cultural heritage
of the United States. But Stanford
may now look to the East.
