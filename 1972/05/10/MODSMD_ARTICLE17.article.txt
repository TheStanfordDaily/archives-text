# What'ya Hear, What'ya Say
## Vote Today 
### Charlie Hoffman 
At long last, the students will get a chance to express their opinion
on the Indian symbol controversy in a special referendum to be held
today and tomorrow.
The Native Americans on campus have responded to the impending
referendum by circulating literature and urging people at yesterday's
rally to boycott the voting process? In a statement in today's Daily,
Native American Sarah Sneed claims that "... a public opinion vote
on racial discrimination is so inappropriate, irrational, and improper,
as to be absurd."
This is an unfortunate attitude. The most objectionable aspect of
the three month old symbol controversy has been the lack of due
process in settling this question. President Richard Lyman defended
the Native American's petition from the beginning and set up a
committee to examine the viability of the Indian as Stanford's
symbol. However, Lyman stated that he was positive that the
committee would find the Indian an inappropriate mascot.
The Student Senate voted on March 2 to eliminate the Indian
symbol and it appeared that the Stanford community was not going
to have a chance to express itself. A large majority of the letters
received by the Daily urged retention of the Indian symbol, but these
and other available forms of input had no effect on the determination
of student and Administration leaders to eliminate the Indian.
Petition Presented
A legal petition with over 600 signatures was presented to former
ASSU President Doug McHenry who refused to hold a referendum on
whether to retain the Indian for "moral" reasons.
New ASSU President Scott Burke ruled recently that McHenry
acted unconstitutionally and ordered a referendum on the Indian and
C-15 questions. Now that the student's legal right to a vote on the
Indian issue has finally been honored, the Native Americans are urging
people not to exercise that right.
One of the largest problems on the Stanford campus in past years
has been the failure of the Administration to listen to the majority of
the students. When the students voted to ban all placement center war
recruiting last spring and set up a committee to determine which
corporations should also be barred, their initiative was ignored.
No Assurance
There is no assurance that the student's decisions on the Indian and
C-15 issues will be honored or even taken into serious consideration
by the Administration. This should not, however, discourage anyone
from voting. It is the obligation of the student body to make its
position clear to the University.
It is my hope that students will support the Indian as their symbol.
The value of the Indian as the school's symbol has been reinforced by
the failure of the Senate's special committee to recommend a serious
and viable substitute. The issue is not as clear as Lyman, McHenry,
and the Student Senate perceive it to be. At the very least, the mascot
controversy deserves much more examination than the campus powers
have been willing to give it.
The only way to keep the issue alive now is for the students to
solidly support the Indian symbol in the referendum today and
tomorrow.

has been the failure of the Administration to listen to the majority of
the students. When the students voted to ban all placement center war
recruiting last spring and set up a committee to determine which
corporations should also be barred, their initiative was ignored.
No Assurance
There is no assurance that the student's decisions on the Indian and
C-15 issues will be honored or even taken into serious consideration
by the Administration. This should not, however, discourage anyone
from voting. It is the obligation of the student body to make its
position clear to the University.
It is my hope that students will support the Indian as their symbol.
The value of the Indian as the school's symbol has been reinforced by
the failure of the Senate's special committee to recommend a serious
and viable substitute. The issue is not as clear as Lyman, McHenry,
and the Student Senate perceive it to be. At the very least, the mascot
controversy deserves much more examination than the campus powers
have been willing to give it.
The only way to keep the issue alive now is for the students to
solidly support the Indian symbol in the referendum today and
tomorrow.

5-2, but lost the next day to league leader Palo Alto Lacrosse Club 8-5.
At long last, the students will get a chance to express their opinion
on the Indian symbol controversy in a special referendum to be held
today and tomorrow.
The Native Americans on campus have responded to the impending
referendum by circulating literature and urging people at yesterday's
rally to boycott the voting process? In a statement in today's Daily,
Native American Sarah Sneed claims that "... a public opinion vote
on racial discrimination is so inappropriate, irrational, and improper,
as to be absurd."
This is an unfortunate attitude. The most objectionable aspect of
the three month old symbol controversy has been the lack of due
process in settling this question. President Richard Lyman defended
the Native American's petition from the beginning and set up a
committee to examine the viability of the Indian as Stanford's
symbol. However, Lyman stated that he was positive that the
committee would find the Indian an inappropriate mascot.
The Student Senate voted on March 2 to eliminate the Indian
symbol and it appeared that the Stanford community was not going
to have a chance to express itself. A large majority of the letters
received by the Daily urged retention of the Indian symbol, but these
and other available forms of input had no effect on the determination
of student and Administration leaders to eliminate the Indian.
Petition Presented
A legal petition with over 600 signatures was presented to former
ASSU President Doug McHenry who refused to hold a referendum on
whether to retain the Indian for "moral" reasons.
New ASSU President Scott Burke ruled recently that McHenry
acted unconstitutionally and ordered a referendum on the Indian and
C-15 questions. Now that the student's legal right to a vote on the
Indian issue has finally been honored, the Native Americans are urging
people not to exercise that right.
One of the largest problems on the Stanford campus in past years
has been the failure of the Administration to listen to the majority of
the students. When the students voted to ban all placement center war
recruiting last spring and set up a committee to determine which
corporations should also be barred, their initiative was ignored.
