# Banquet Honors Stanford Athletes
## 
### STAN WILSON 
Last Friday night the Stanford
Buck Club held its annual Block
"S" banquet at Rickey's Hyatt
House in Palo Alto, and several
outstanding Stanford athletes and
student athletes were given awards
for their accomplishments over
the past year.
Highlighting the presentation
was the Biff Hoffman Award,
given annually to the outstanding
athlete at the University. This
year's recipient is Steve Hug,
Olympian gymnist at age 16, and
NCAA All-Around Gymnastics
champion this year, although only
a sophomore. Hug led an excellent
Stanford team to a close
third-place finish behind
Washington, the Pac-8
representative to the NCAA meet
as a result of the ban against
champion California.
The Pacific -Eight
Student-Athlete Award, based
upon a combination of athletic
achievement and academic record,
was awarded to senior running
backJackie√ürown, who performed
best when needed the most. Most
will remember Brown for his vital
role in Stanford Rose Bowl
victories over Ohio State and
Michigan. He scored two
touchdowns in the brilliantly
played "upset" of Ohio State in
1971, and came back in 1972 to

set up the winning touchdown
with a 33 yard run on a fake punt
and a "4th and 10" situation. A
few plays later Brown scored the
winning touchdown on a 24 yard
run. But Brown, drafted by
Oakland of the NFL, has chosen
Law School over a career in pro
football.
Another academic award, the
Block 'S' Honors Award, is given
to the Junior Block 'S' athlete
with the highest scholastic record.
The award was given to
shot-putter Ralph Bakkensen,
who has maintained a 3.8 CPA

while pursuing a degree in
Economics. Bakkensen has a best
of 52-B'/2 in the shot put.
The Gimbel Award, given to
the athlete with the best mental
attitude toward athletics, was
given to All-American linebacker
Jeff Siemon. Siemon was a first
round draft choice of the
Minnesota Vikings of the NFL.
Two other athletes, swimmer
Brian Job, and tennis player
Roscoe Tanner, were presented
the Merit Award for success in
athletics. Job has seven NCAA
championships, and holds several

records. Tanner is recognized as
one of the top tennis players in
the nation, and is currently
ranked No. 8 in singles
competition.
Pete Lazetich, of
Thunderchicken fame, and
potential infamy, received the Jim
Reynolds Award for the most
inspirational senior football
player. "Cowboy Pete" was
drafted by the San Diego
Chargers.
In each sport in which
Stanford competes on the varsity
level, an award is given-
