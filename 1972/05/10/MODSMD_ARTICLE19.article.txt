# Circus Olympus Here Friday Night
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
The first annual Circus Olympus will be presented this Friday in
Maples Pavilion. It will feature the best of men's and women's
gymnastics plus some thrilling circus acts, clowns, colored lighting,
and music by the Stanford Band.
Featured will be the Stanford gymnastic team led by Steve Hug,
1968 Olympian and 1972 NCAA all around gymnastics champion,
Dan Mi 1 1 man, past world's trampoline champion, and Norbert Dill, tin'
World's Gymwheel champion from Germany.
Performers will also include members of the Diablo Valley Gym
Club, the best women's team in Northern California with many
national caliber performers. Among them is Diane Dunbar, 1972
United States Gymnastics Federation champion for the state of
California. Other prominent performers are Mark Adams AAU
runner-up in the sidehorse, Bob Dixon former NCAA all around
champion, and Jim Turpin currently the best vaulter in the world.
The evenings events will also include a mini-trampoline exhibition,
floor exercises, a unicycle race, syncronized tumbling, a phantom
juggler, adagio, the gymwheel, and a balancing act.
The show is put on by the Stanford gymnastics team to raise
money for athletic scholarships. Currently the team has no money to
award scholarships to prospective high school gymnasts. Pacific-Eight
powers such as Washington and Oregon have no limit on the amount
of money they may award for gymnastics scholarships or spend on
travel.
Many of the nations top higii school gymnasts are interested in
attending Stanford, but the high tuition makes it prohibitive. Thus
far, Coach Dan Millman has recruited at least three top gymnasts that
he believes will give Stanford the best team in the Pacific-Eight, and
possibly an NCAA championship.
All major members of this years squad return and with the new
freshmen Millman believes the Cards will be able to challenge
California. This year the Bears narrowly defeated Stanford as the
Cards completed their best season in history.
Tickets may be purchased in advance at the Department of
Athletics Ticket Office. The cost is $1.50 for students and $3.00 for
the general public. The show starts at 8:00 p.m.
