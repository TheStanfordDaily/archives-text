# Violence Marks Demonstrations As Campuses Protest Escalation
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
Turbulence swirled anew on streets
and campuses across the nation as
antiwar demonstrators rallied,
marched, sat in mock blockades and
often resorted to violence in protest of
President Nixon's escalation of the
Indochina War.
Jerry Gordon, coordinator for the
National Peace Action Coalition,
called for the demonstrations, most of
which took place on the East and West
Coasts, to continue through the rest of
the week. He urged that the rallies
build to a massive climax on Saturday.
Violent confrontations between
police and demonstrators occurred in
several campus areas. At the University
of New Mexico in Albuquerque, UNM
Daily Lobo reporter Carolyn Coburn
was shot in the chest while covering a
demonstration near Interstate
Highway 25, and late last night an
Albuquerque hospital listed her in
serious condition.
A number of observers including
reporters claimed the shots were fired
by police, although area law
enforcement agencies refused to
accept responsibility. Another student
was slightly wounded during the
shooting. About 75 police eventually
used tear gas to disperse the 500
demonstrators.
At the University of Florida in
Gainseville, police used fire hoses and
tear gas to clear U.S. Highway 441,
and claimed a number of arrests.
Reports from the University of
Colorado say that fifty students have
been arrested in demonstrations there.
Trashing at the University of
Wisconsin resulted in the use of tear
gas and mace after a noon rally of
about 3000 announced plans to
demand a special session of the state
legislature to urge that the university
withdraw all resources from the
Vietnam War.
In Columbus, Ohio, an object was
thrown through the rear window of a
limousine carrying Vice President

Spiro Agnew to the Central Ohio
Republican fund-raising dinner, the
Associated Press reported. An aide said
Agnew, in the back seat of the
limousine, was not injured. About 350
antiwar protesters were grouped in the
area at the time, the majority were
believed to have come from Ohio State
University.
Berkeley Protests
Some 3000 Berkeley demonstrators
triggered the largest California rally.
Continuing a march they began
Monday night, the protesters moved
singing and chanting through
downtown Berkeley and the
University of California campus
yesterday after hearing Mayor Warren
Widener call for a one-day shutdown
of the city at a noon rally.
Later, a crowd of 3600 picketed
the Berkeley City Council meeting to
hear the council adopt a resolution
supporting Widener's proposal by a
vote of 7-2. Violent clashes
throughout the day between
rock-throwing demonstrators and
riot-garbed policemen climaxed in a
large bonfire that was started in a
wooden shed across from city hall
after the council meeting.
The Associated Press reported that
an estimated 2000 people paraded
through buildings at UCLA,
demanding that classes be closed for
the day. Another 1500 persons
marched from a noon rally on the
University of California Santa Barbara
campus, disrupting classes in session
and pulling fire alarms. They then
walked two miles from the campus to
a local airport where they blocked two
major runways, remaining iate into the
night.
Traffic Blocked
University of California Davis
students, numbering around 200,
blocked westbound traffic on
Interstate 80 for nearly half an hour.
Autos backed up several miles until a
dozen California Highway Patrolmen
and Davis police ordered the group to

disperse. The demonstrators then
walked to nearby railroad tracks where
they halted five Southern Pacific
freight trains. Police made 57 arrests
there.
In San Jose, police investigated two
fires, apparently caused by incendiary
devices, which caused $200,000
damage at an Army reserve station and
$1,000 damage to a Navy-Marine
training center early yesterday.
In the East, large demonstrations
and scattered incidents of violence
were reported at Princeton University,

accept responsibility. Another student
was slightly wounded during the
shooting. About 75 police eventually
used tear gas to disperse the 500
demonstrators.
At the University of Florida in
Gainseville, police used fire hoses and
tear gas to clear U.S. Highway 441,
and claimed a number of arrests.
Reports from the University of
Colorado say that fifty students have
been arrested in demonstrations there.
Trashing at the University of
Wisconsin resulted in the use of tear
gas and mace after a noon rally of
about 3000 announced plans to
demand a special session of the state
legislature to urge that the university
withdraw all resources from the
Vietnam War.
In Columbus, Ohio, an object was
thrown through the rear window of a
limousine carrying Vice President

Spiro Agnew to the Central Ohio
Republican fund-raising dinner, the
Associated Press reported. An aide said
Agnew, in the back seat of the
limousine, was not injured. About 350
antiwar protesters were grouped in the
area at the time, the majority were
believed to have come from Ohio State
University.
Berkeley Protests
Some 3000 Berkeley demonstrators
triggered the largest California rally.
Continuing a march they began
Monday night, the protesters moved
singing and chanting through
downtown Berkeley and the
University of California campus
yesterday after hearing Mayor Warren
Widener call for a one-day shutdown
of the city at a noon rally.
Later, a crowd of 3600 picketed
the Berkeley City Council meeting to
hear the council adopt a resolution
supporting Widener's proposal by a
vote of 7-2. Violent clashes
throughout the day between
rock-throwing demonstrators and
riot-garbed policemen climaxed in a
large bonfire that was started in a
wooden shed across from city hall
after the council meeting.
The Associated Press reported that
an estimated 2000 people paraded
through buildings at UCLA,
demanding that classes be closed for
the day. Another 1500 persons
marched from a noon rally on the
University of California Santa Barbara
campus, disrupting classes in session
and pulling fire alarms. They then
walked two miles from the campus to
a local airport where they blocked two
major runways, remaining iate into the
night.
Traffic Blocked
University of California Davis
students, numbering around 200,
blocked westbound traffic on
Interstate 80 for nearly half an hour.
Autos backed up several miles until a
dozen California Highway Patrolmen
and Davis police ordered the group to

disperse. The demonstrators then
walked to nearby railroad tracks where
they halted five Southern Pacific
freight trains. Police made 57 arrests
there.
In San Jose, police investigated two
fires, apparently caused by incendiary
devices, which caused $200,000
damage at an Army reserve station and
$1,000 damage to a Navy-Marine
training center early yesterday.
In the East, large demonstrations
and scattered incidents of violence
were reported at Princeton University,
Turbulence swirled anew on streets
and campuses across the nation as
antiwar demonstrators rallied,
marched, sat in mock blockades and
often resorted to violence in protest of
President Nixon's escalation of the
Indochina War.
Jerry Gordon, coordinator for the
National Peace Action Coalition,
called for the demonstrations, most of
which took place on the East and West
Coasts, to continue through the rest of
the week. He urged that the rallies
build to a massive climax on Saturday.
Violent confrontations between
police and demonstrators occurred in
several campus areas. At the University
of New Mexico in Albuquerque, UNM
Daily Lobo reporter Carolyn Coburn
was shot in the chest while covering a
demonstration near Interstate
Highway 25, and late last night an
Albuquerque hospital listed her in
serious condition.
A number of observers including
reporters claimed the shots were fired
by police, although area law
enforcement agencies refused to
accept responsibility. Another student
