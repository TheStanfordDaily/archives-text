# Laxmen Defeat Claremont, Lose To Palo Alto
## 
### 
The Stanford Lacrosse team
defeated Claremont Men's College
on Saturday, 5-2, but lost its bid
for first place in the Bay Area
Lacrosse League as they were
defeated for the second time this
season by league leaders, the Palo
Alto Lacrosse Club, 8-5 on
Sunday.
Against Claremont the Cards
didn't get going until the final
frame. In the first quarter
Stanford took a 2-1 lead on goals
by Chip Lovemann and Ted Suen.
However, Claremont knotted the
score in the second period and so

it stood until the final period.
Claremont dominated most of
the third period as the Cards were
unable to connect on their passes,
especially when they had a man
advantage.
The Card defense, led by goalie
Fred Choate managed to keep
Claremont off the board. The
Stanford defense was put to the
test in the fourth quarter also, but
several excellent plays by
defenseman Kem Ketchum
thwarted Claremont's offense.
Larry Glenn and Ted Suen
combined on a good passing play

to put Stanford into the lead.
Suen passed to Glenn in front of
the Claremont goal. Glenn leaped
into the air, took the pass and
shot it in. Suen picked up his
third assist of the afternoon as he
fed to Chip Lovemann who fired a
low bouncing shot which eluded
the visitor's netminder. Lovemann
completed his hat trick on a quick
shot. The final score was Stanford
5, Claremont 2.
Coach Eakland's laxmen took
on Palo Alto the following day in
their final bid to take over first
place. Stanford's play was much
the same as the day before. The
Cards again didn't pass well and
were unable to take advantage of
several good opportunities.
Palo Alto scored twice in the
first period while the Cards could
only tally once as Chip Lovemann
intercepted a clearing pass.
Although still passing poorly
the Cards scored twice more in
the second period while holding
the visitors scoreless. Paul Yuell
and Butch Hazelett were the
marksmen for Stanford. Though
Palo Alto pressured, the Stanford
defense met the challenge as Fred
Choate came up with several
good saves. At the end of the first
half the Cards were ahead, 3-2.
The action picked up in the
second half and it worked to the

visitors' advantage. They scored
twice within twenty seconds as
they caught the Stanford defense
off guard after scoring the first
goal. The Stanford defense started
to crack as they had much
difficulty in breaking out of their
own zone. Palo Alto made it 5-2
on a quick pass in front.
Larry Glenn brought
Stanford back as he scored on a

rebound. But Palo Alto came back
to score two quick goals again and
this broke the backs of the
Stanford team. The teams traded
goals again late in the game to
make the final score 8-5.
The team travels to Los
Angeles this weekend to take on
Occidental and UCLA. They may
get another chance at Palo Alto in
the NCLA playoffs in June.

5, Claremont 2.
Coach Eakland's laxmen took
on Palo Alto the following day in
their final bid to take over first
place. Stanford's play was much
the same as the day before. The
Cards again didn't pass well and
were unable to take advantage of
several good opportunities.
Palo Alto scored twice in the
first period while the Cards could
only tally once as Chip Lovemann
intercepted a clearing pass.
Although still passing poorly
the Cards scored twice more in
the second period while holding
the visitors scoreless. Paul Yuell
and Butch Hazelett were the
marksmen for Stanford. Though
Palo Alto pressured, the Stanford
defense met the challenge as Fred
Choate came up with several
good saves. At the end of the first
half the Cards were ahead, 3-2.
The action picked up in the
second half and it worked to the

visitors' advantage. They scored
twice within twenty seconds as
they caught the Stanford defense
off guard after scoring the first
goal. The Stanford defense started
to crack as they had much
difficulty in breaking out of their
own zone. Palo Alto made it 5-2
on a quick pass in front.
Larry Glenn brought
Stanford back as he scored on a

rebound. But Palo Alto came back
to score two quick goals again and
this broke the backs of the
Stanford team. The teams traded
goals again late in the game to
make the final score 8-5.
The team travels to Los
Angeles this weekend to take on
Occidental and UCLA. They may
get another chance at Palo Alto in
the NCLA playoffs in June.
The Stanford Lacrosse team
defeated Claremont Men's College
on Saturday, 5-2, but lost its bid
for first place in the Bay Area
Lacrosse League as they were
defeated for the second time this
season by league leaders, the Palo
Alto Lacrosse Club, 8-5 on
Sunday.
Against Claremont the Cards
didn't get going until the final
frame. In the first quarter
Stanford took a 2-1 lead on goals
by Chip Lovemann and Ted Suen.
However, Claremont knotted the
score in the second period and so

it stood until the final period.
Claremont dominated most of
the third period as the Cards were
unable to connect on their passes,
especially when they had a man
advantage.
The Card defense, led by goalie
Fred Choate managed to keep
Claremont off the board. The
Stanford defense was put to the
test in the fourth quarter also, but
several excellent plays by
defenseman Kem Ketchum
thwarted Claremont's offense.
Larry Glenn and Ted Suen
combined on a good passing play

to put Stanford into the lead.
Suen passed to Glenn in front of
the Claremont goal. Glenn leaped
into the air, took the pass and
shot it in. Suen picked up his
third assist of the afternoon as he
fed to Chip Lovemann who fired a
low bouncing shot which eluded
the visitor's netminder. Lovemann
completed his hat trick on a quick
shot. The final score was Stanford
5, Claremont 2.
