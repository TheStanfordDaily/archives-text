McGovern Takes Nebraska
Sen. George S. McGovern won Nebraska's Democratic
presidential primary early Wednesday, outdistancing Sen.
Hubert H. Humphrey in a match of top contenders for the
White House nomination.
Humphrey trounced Gov. George C. Wallace in their
West Virginia primary confrontation.
But South Dakota's McGovern appeared to have gained
more in Tuesday's split decision primaries, winning the
one in which the national stakes were higher—although
purely psychological.
With 59 percent of the Nebraska precints counted, this
was the situation:
McGovern 42,345 votes or 38 percent.
Humphrey 39,751 votes or 36 percent.
Wallace 14,993 votes or 14 percent.
The rest of an 11-entry field trailed far behind.
McGovem, in Washington, said "scare tactics" designed
to depict him as a radical had probably cut into his
Nebraska vote.
In West Virginia, with 43 percent of the precincts

counted, this was the picture:
Humphrey 100,333 votes or 69 percent.
Wallace 45,696 votes or 31 percent.
Hijaekers Killed
SAN JOSE — An airline ticket agent testified yesterday
that Angela Davis rushed to catch a plane out of San
Francisco three hours after shootings in nearby Marin
County had claimed four lives.
Marcia Brewer said she sold Davis a ticket to Los
Angeles on Aug. 7, 1970, about two minutes before a 2
p.m. flight was scheduled to depart.
The prosecution claims her rushed demeanor points
toward guilt. She subsequently disappeared and was a
fugitive until her arrest in New York the following
October.
Miners Reseued
KELLOGG, Idaho — At least two of more than 50 miners
missing for a week after fire swept the Sunshine silver
mine were found alive Tuesday by rescuers nearly a mile
beneath the surface. The survivors said seven more of their
coworkers were dead.
