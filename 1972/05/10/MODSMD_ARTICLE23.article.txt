# Demonstrators Fight Police

group of six sheriff's officers entered
the library looking for assailants who
had thrown rocks and tiles from the
fourth floor balcony. Charging up the
stairs, the police reportedly told
onlookers, "Get out of our way or
we'll bash your teeth in." Five arrests
were made on the fourth floor
balcony.
A witness, Gary Chumrau, said that
two white juveniles and one black had
been throwing pieces of tile, but left
earlier—they were not arrested. The
five arrested claimed they had been
watching from the terrace.
Hit And Run
From then on the protesters
developed a hit and run technique of
attacking police with rocks, retreating,
regrouping, attacking, etc. The police
generally tried to keep the group from
the main campus, and tactical units
several times charged the group
swinging clubs.
Once a single unit of six police
screaming and swinging clubs chased
over 100 demonstrators through the
main library parking lot.
Police were seen at least twice to
pick up rocks and throw them at
retreating protesters. One of the rock
throwers was identified by a Daily
reporter, as Stanford public safety
officer badge number 25.
At one point a group of about four
persons was observed coming out of

Stern and throwing rocks at retreating
demonstrators.
One police charge up Galvez past
Stern was cut short when an officer in
front was felled by a rock. Rear line
retreating demonstrators, seeing the
police falter, counter-attacked sending
police running back. Another police
line quickly pushed forward, however,
again forcing the demonstrators to
retreat.
By 11 p.m. the 75 to 100 people
left in the largest group decided to
split into smaller affinity groups and
disperse after Don Lee told them, "It
would be murder and insane to go
back to White Plaza."
Yesterday's anti-war activities
began at 7 a.m. when about 75 persons
turned up to block the entrances of
the physical plant. Sheriff's deputies
on the scene cleared paths for most
incoming and outgoing vehicles, but
some five trucks honored the student
picket line and turned away. However,
one of those five trucks later entered
the plant under a police escort after
the driver consulted with Teamsters
Union local 856, which advised him
not to honor the lines.
Morning Arrest
By the time the truck entered, at
10 a.m., the crowd had dwindled to
about 20. It then began to march up
Serra Street, where the only arrest of
the morning took place. Francisco
Barba, a law student, was arrested for

obstructing traffic because he was not
riding his bicycle in the bicycle lane.
He was also charged with resisting
arrest.
After a noon rally in White Plaza
attracted more than 800 persons, two
smaller groups broke off from the
main body and entered the Old Union
and the Placement Center. Furniture
was removed from both buildings to
help barricade the entrances to White
Plaza (renamed QuangTri Plaza by the
protesters after the first South
Vietnamese provincial capital captured
by North Vietnam).
A barricade near the Placement
Center caught fire late in the
afternoon, but was quickly
extinguished.
About 150 persons entered the Old
Union after the rally, but only 30
remained by the time police entered
and cleared the building at about 6:20
p.m.
In the placement center, about 75
people entered after the rally, but only
35 were around at 6:30, almost an
hour and a half after the building was
to have closed, when tac squad officers
moved in.

pick up rocks and throw them at
retreating protesters. One of the rock
throwers was identified by a Daily
reporter, as Stanford public safety
officer badge number 25.
At one point a group of about four
persons was observed coming out of

Stern and throwing rocks at retreating
demonstrators.
One police charge up Galvez past
Stern was cut short when an officer in
front was felled by a rock. Rear line
retreating demonstrators, seeing the
police falter, counter-attacked sending
police running back. Another police
line quickly pushed forward, however,
again forcing the demonstrators to
retreat.
By 11 p.m. the 75 to 100 people
left in the largest group decided to
split into smaller affinity groups and
disperse after Don Lee told them, "It
would be murder and insane to go
back to White Plaza."
Yesterday's anti-war activities
began at 7 a.m. when about 75 persons
turned up to block the entrances of
the physical plant. Sheriff's deputies
on the scene cleared paths for most
incoming and outgoing vehicles, but
some five trucks honored the student
picket line and turned away. However,
one of those five trucks later entered
the plant under a police escort after
the driver consulted with Teamsters
Union local 856, which advised him
not to honor the lines.
Morning Arrest
By the time the truck entered, at
10 a.m., the crowd had dwindled to
about 20. It then began to march up
Serra Street, where the only arrest of
the morning took place. Francisco
Barba, a law student, was arrested for

obstructing traffic because he was not
riding his bicycle in the bicycle lane.
He was also charged with resisting
arrest.
After a noon rally in White Plaza
attracted more than 800 persons, two
smaller groups broke off from the
main body and entered the Old Union
and the Placement Center. Furniture
was removed from both buildings to
help barricade the entrances to White
Plaza (renamed QuangTri Plaza by the
protesters after the first South
Vietnamese provincial capital captured
by North Vietnam).
A barricade near the Placement
Center caught fire late in the
afternoon, but was quickly
extinguished.
About 150 persons entered the Old
Union after the rally, but only 30
remained by the time police entered
and cleared the building at about 6:20
p.m.
In the placement center, about 75
people entered after the rally, but only
35 were around at 6:30, almost an
hour and a half after the building was
to have closed, when tac squad officers
moved in.

group of six sheriff's officers entered
the library looking for assailants who
had thrown rocks and tiles from the
fourth floor balcony. Charging up the
stairs, the police reportedly told
onlookers, "Get out of our way or
we'll bash your teeth in." Five arrests
were made on the fourth floor
balcony.
A witness, Gary Chumrau, said that
two white juveniles and one black had
been throwing pieces of tile, but left
earlier—they were not arrested. The
five arrested claimed they had been
watching from the terrace.
Hit And Run
From then on the protesters
developed a hit and run technique of
attacking police with rocks, retreating,
regrouping, attacking, etc. The police
generally tried to keep the group from
the main campus, and tactical units
several times charged the group
swinging clubs.
Once a single unit of six police
screaming and swinging clubs chased
over 100 demonstrators through the
main library parking lot.
Police were seen at least twice to
pick up rocks and throw them at
retreating protesters. One of the rock
throwers was identified by a Daily
reporter, as Stanford public safety
officer badge number 25.
