# Referenda Begin Today On Câ€”15, Mascot Questions
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
A special ASSU referendum will be
held today and tomorrow on the issues
of a new student judicial system and
the Indian symbol.
Polling places at Engineering Corner
and the Bookstore will be open from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Polls at the Physics
Tank and the Law, Business and
Medical School lounges will remain
open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
The judicial system referendum was
requested by the six student members
of the Committee of 15 (C-15) who
walked out of last Tuesday's
committee meeting to protest the
adoption of a faculty-majority judicial
panel. The ASSU Senate placed the
referendum on the ballot.
The C-15 referendum states that
"the students of Stanford University
will not accept any judicial system
that does not provide for student
majorities on guilt-determining
panels." The referendum calls a
student majority a "minimal condition
for continued discussion by student
members of the C-15 on other
provisions of a judicial system."
Students can vote yes or no on the

referendum.
Symbol Referendum
The symbol referendum asks "are
you in favor of eliminating the Indian
as the mascot of Stanford University?"
A petition drive led by ASSU Senator
Dan Cummings obtained 677
signatures requesting that the
referendum be held. 600 signatures are
required by the ASSU Constitution to
place a referendum on the ballot
without Senate approval.
The six student members of the
C-15 requested that the referendum be
held after the committee voted 8-7 to
have a 5-4 faculty-majority judicial
system. The six walked out because
they felt the vote had violated the will
of the student body as expressed in an
April 1971 referendum.
A portion of that referendum,
which passed 1929-1186, called for a
judicial system "composed only of
students." The student C-15 members
issued a statement saying that if the
referendum passes, "we will return to
ask the Committee to reconsider the
composition issue.
"Should the Committee refuse to
accept a student majority on the
above-mentioned panels, we will refuse
to participate in any further C-15
deliberations."
If the referendum fails, the student
members say they "will return to
normal deliberations."
Controversy
A considerable amount of
controversy has surrounded the
mascot symbol referendum. The

petition drive began when the ASSU
Senate voted 18-4 last March to
terminate its recognition of the
symbol. The Senate also voted at that
time not to call a referendum on the
issue, emphasizing that an election on
a moral question was inappropriate.
[President Lyman and the ASSU
Senate have already officially
abolished the Indian as the school's
symbol. A committee is now meeting
to consider a new symbol.)
Although bound by the ASSU
Constitution to put on the ballot any
referendum requested by 600 or more
students, then-ASSU President Doug
McHenry refused to take such action
on the symbol question as long as he
remained in office. McHenry cited
"moral" reasons.
Current ASSU President Scott
Burke told the Daily that when
McHenry was cleaning out his desk in
anticipation of leaving office, he
"claimed to have lost the petitions."
However, Burke said that Cummings
came to him with duplicates of the
petitions and "that was enough for
me." Burke criticized McHenry's
handling of the symbol referendum
becuase he "refused unconstitutionally
to put it on the ballot."
In criticizing the holding of an
election on the symbol issue, the
Stanford Native American Community
issued a statement saying "this is a
decision which must be made outside
of the political arena, without
emotion, and with detached
consideration and judgment."

A portion of that referendum,
which passed 1929-1186, called for a
judicial system "composed only of
students." The student C-15 members
issued a statement saying that if the
referendum passes, "we will return to
ask the Committee to reconsider the
composition issue.
"Should the Committee refuse to
accept a student majority on the
above-mentioned panels, we will refuse
to participate in any further C-15
deliberations."
If the referendum fails, the student
members say they "will return to
normal deliberations."
Controversy
A considerable amount of
controversy has surrounded the
mascot symbol referendum. The

petition drive began when the ASSU
Senate voted 18-4 last March to
terminate its recognition of the
symbol. The Senate also voted at that
time not to call a referendum on the
issue, emphasizing that an election on
a moral question was inappropriate.
[President Lyman and the ASSU
Senate have already officially
abolished the Indian as the school's
symbol. A committee is now meeting
to consider a new symbol.)
Although bound by the ASSU
Constitution to put on the ballot any
referendum requested by 600 or more
students, then-ASSU President Doug
McHenry refused to take such action
on the symbol question as long as he
remained in office. McHenry cited
"moral" reasons.
Current ASSU President Scott
Burke told the Daily that when
McHenry was cleaning out his desk in
anticipation of leaving office, he
"claimed to have lost the petitions."
However, Burke said that Cummings
came to him with duplicates of the
petitions and "that was enough for
me." Burke criticized McHenry's
handling of the symbol referendum
becuase he "refused unconstitutionally
to put it on the ballot."
In criticizing the holding of an
election on the symbol issue, the
Stanford Native American Community
issued a statement saying "this is a
decision which must be made outside
of the political arena, without
emotion, and with detached
consideration and judgment."
A special ASSU referendum will be
held today and tomorrow on the issues
of a new student judicial system and
the Indian symbol.
Polling places at Engineering Corner
and the Bookstore will be open from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Polls at the Physics
Tank and the Law, Business and
Medical School lounges will remain
open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
The judicial system referendum was
requested by the six student members
of the Committee of 15 (C-15) who
walked out of last Tuesday's
committee meeting to protest the
adoption of a faculty-majority judicial
panel. The ASSU Senate placed the
referendum on the ballot.
The C-15 referendum states that
"the students of Stanford University
will not accept any judicial system
that does not provide for student
majorities on guilt-determining
panels." The referendum calls a
student majority a "minimal condition
for continued discussion by student
members of the C-15 on other
provisions of a judicial system."
Students can vote yes or no on the

referendum.
Symbol Referendum
The symbol referendum asks "are
you in favor of eliminating the Indian
as the mascot of Stanford University?"
A petition drive led by ASSU Senator
Dan Cummings obtained 677
signatures requesting that the
referendum be held. 600 signatures are
required by the ASSU Constitution to
place a referendum on the ballot
without Senate approval.
The six student members of the
C-15 requested that the referendum be
held after the committee voted 8-7 to
have a 5-4 faculty-majority judicial
system. The six walked out because
they felt the vote had violated the will
of the student body as expressed in an
April 1971 referendum.
A portion of that referendum,
which passed 1929-1186, called for a
judicial system "composed only of
students." The student C-15 members
