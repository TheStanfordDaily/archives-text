# Navy Warns Shipping
## Controversy Rages Over Escalation 
### MARION BREWER 
Military preparations for an
American blockade of North Vietnam
went on yesterday as a surprised world
c ontinued to react to the move.
While angry responses flared across
the country and around the world, the
Navy formally warned all shipping that
mine fields laid around the entrances
to seven North Vietnamese ports will
be activated at 3 a.m. Pacific Daylight
Time tomorrow.
Cmdr. Lloyd M. Bucher, former
skipper of the spy ship U.S.S. Pueblo
which was captured by North Korea in
1968, helped lay mines for the Navy
Monday night and said, "I am very
happy with President Nixon's
decision" on the mining.
In Los Angeles, however, former
Minnesota Sen. Eugene McCarthy,
suggested impeachment proceedings be
initiated against Nixon. New York
Congresswoman Bella Abzug
announced that she was willing to
introduce impeachment legislation.
She told the House of Representatives
that Nixon's decision amounted to
"high crime," grounds for

impeachment.
Caucus Opinion
The Senate Democratic Caucus
went on record with a 29-14 vote "as
disapproving of the escalation of the
war in Vietnam as announced by the
President May 8." The caucus
unanimously voted to continue with
the pending end-the-war proposal and
to seek a Senate vote as soon as
possible. Caucus member, Sen. Vance
Hartke (D.-Ind.), called the Nixon
action "the most reckless act of
international lawlessness that any
American president has ever
committed."
From San Diego, however, came
the suggestion that the act may have
been carefully premeditated. On April
13 a total of 34 warships and more
than 100 aircraft took part in a
minefield planting exercise off the
coast of San Diego. Vice Adm. Ray E.
Peet revealed the operation took place
and said "It was a very successful
exercise."
It was the first Pacific test of the
new high-speed mine-sweeping
helicopters, and many of the ships

involved in the April exercise have
since left for Vietnam. A few
reportedly cut short the test to sail.
Yesterday Sen. Mike Gravel
(D-Alaska), read portions of the secret
"Kissinger papers" into the Senate
record. The Papers, prepared in 1969,
indicated that the C.I.A. and the
Pentagon office of the Defense
Department then felt that the
bombing of supply routes between
China and Hanoi and the mining of the
ports would be ineffective in
completely shutting off supply routes
to North Vietnam.
Although there has not yet been a
formal response from the Kremlin,
TASS, the official news agency,
accused Nixon of "naked aggressive
acts" in violation of international law.
In New York Moscow's ambassador to
the United Nations, Jacob A. Malik,
said, "I agree with many American
congressmen who condemn the new
act of aggression."
Peking also has yet to issue a formal
statement. However, Radio Peking
claimed that American planes and
warships "brazenly and repeatedly

attacked" two Chinese merchant ships
anchored in North Vietnamese waters
last weekend. The report warned that
the U.S. government must stop attacks
upon Chinese merchant ships or "bear
full responsibility for all the grave
consequences arising therefrom."
A spokesman for the North
Vietnamese delegation to the Paris
peace talks said the President "has
taken the gravest step in the escalation
of the war to date." The statement
declared "the North Vietnamese
people will never accept Mr. Nixon's
ultimatum."
Paris Demonstrations
Paris leftist organizations called two
demonstrations for this evening to
protect Nixon's move. Elsewhere in
Europe, 1200 demonstrators marched
through the streets of Frankfort,
Germany smashing windows of
American business offices. In general,
France and Scandanavian countries
were critical of the Nixon decision,
although England and other American
allies voiced a hope that the decision
would hasten thewar'send.

introduce impeachment legislation.
She told the House of Representatives
that Nixon's decision amounted to
"high crime," grounds for

impeachment.
Caucus Opinion
The Senate Democratic Caucus
went on record with a 29-14 vote "as
disapproving of the escalation of the
war in Vietnam as announced by the
President May 8." The caucus
unanimously voted to continue with
the pending end-the-war proposal and
to seek a Senate vote as soon as
possible. Caucus member, Sen. Vance
Hartke (D.-Ind.), called the Nixon
action "the most reckless act of
international lawlessness that any
American president has ever
committed."
From San Diego, however, came
the suggestion that the act may have
been carefully premeditated. On April
13 a total of 34 warships and more
than 100 aircraft took part in a
minefield planting exercise off the
coast of San Diego. Vice Adm. Ray E.
Peet revealed the operation took place
and said "It was a very successful
exercise."
It was the first Pacific test of the
new high-speed mine-sweeping
helicopters, and many of the ships

involved in the April exercise have
since left for Vietnam. A few
reportedly cut short the test to sail.
Yesterday Sen. Mike Gravel
(D-Alaska), read portions of the secret
"Kissinger papers" into the Senate
record. The Papers, prepared in 1969,
indicated that the C.I.A. and the
Pentagon office of the Defense
Department then felt that the
bombing of supply routes between
China and Hanoi and the mining of the
ports would be ineffective in
completely shutting off supply routes
to North Vietnam.
Although there has not yet been a
formal response from the Kremlin,
TASS, the official news agency,
accused Nixon of "naked aggressive
acts" in violation of international law.
In New York Moscow's ambassador to
the United Nations, Jacob A. Malik,
said, "I agree with many American
congressmen who condemn the new
act of aggression."
Peking also has yet to issue a formal
statement. However, Radio Peking
claimed that American planes and
warships "brazenly and repeatedly

attacked" two Chinese merchant ships
anchored in North Vietnamese waters
last weekend. The report warned that
the U.S. government must stop attacks
upon Chinese merchant ships or "bear
full responsibility for all the grave
consequences arising therefrom."
A spokesman for the North
Vietnamese delegation to the Paris
peace talks said the President "has
taken the gravest step in the escalation
of the war to date." The statement
declared "the North Vietnamese
people will never accept Mr. Nixon's
ultimatum."
Paris Demonstrations
Paris leftist organizations called two
demonstrations for this evening to
protect Nixon's move. Elsewhere in
Europe, 1200 demonstrators marched
through the streets of Frankfort,
Germany smashing windows of
American business offices. In general,
France and Scandanavian countries
were critical of the Nixon decision,
although England and other American
allies voiced a hope that the decision
would hasten thewar'send.
Military preparations for an
American blockade of North Vietnam
went on yesterday as a surprised world
c ontinued to react to the move.
While angry responses flared across
the country and around the world, the
Navy formally warned all shipping that
mine fields laid around the entrances
to seven North Vietnamese ports will
be activated at 3 a.m. Pacific Daylight
Time tomorrow.
Cmdr. Lloyd M. Bucher, former
skipper of the spy ship U.S.S. Pueblo
which was captured by North Korea in
1968, helped lay mines for the Navy
Monday night and said, "I am very
happy with President Nixon's
decision" on the mining.
In Los Angeles, however, former
Minnesota Sen. Eugene McCarthy,
suggested impeachment proceedings be
initiated against Nixon. New York
Congresswoman Bella Abzug
announced that she was willing to
introduce impeachment legislation.
She told the House of Representatives
that Nixon's decision amounted to
"high crime," grounds for

impeachment.
