# New Engineering Dean, Vice-Provost Appointed
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
Professor William M. Kays, chairman of the
Mechanical Engineering Department, was
named dean of the Engineering School
yesterday, at a time when the school will hear
more demands for changes in direction and
sources of funding.
An internationally known expert on heat
transfer, Kays, 35. said yesterday that as dean
he faces "a major leadership problem," but
that now it is "terribly presumptuous to talk
about change," before he learns more about
the school as a whole.
Another engineer, Prof. Arthur I.
Bienenstock of Materials Science, was
appointed a vice-provost of the University
yesterday, his prime responsibility being the
faculty appointment system.
Named affirmative Action officer last fall,
Bienenstock will serve as a "surrogate in the
appointment process," according to his
immediate boss Provost William Miller, and
will direct the University Progress Fund, a
major vehicle for educational innovation.
Succeeds Pettit
The selection of Kays as dean followed
several months' work by a search committee
to find a replacement for .Joseph Pettit, who
left for the presidency of Georgia Tech in
February. Prof. Robert Street will continue as

temporary- dean until July 1 when Kays takes
over.
Search committee member Edward
Gintzon, former Stanford professor and
chairman of Varian Associates in Palo Alto,
commented that he found Kays "an
intelligent and dedicated person with broad
knowledge of the field of engineering and the
social implications of engineering."
Kays came to Stanford in 1938 as a
freshman, and has been at Stanford
continuously except for four years during
World War 11. Me joined the faculty in 1947,
and became head of his department in 1961.
Faculty Tripled
The engineering faculty has tripled since he
joined it, but Kays stated that he does not see
a further need for expansion.
The school's faculty and graduate programs
rank among the top three in the nation in
quality and size, along with MIT and
Berkeley.
He does not foresee a reduction in the
school's research work, which in part brought
it to prominence, but plans to add more
programs to deal with specific problems in
society
The dean's search committee discussed at
great length the balance the school should
strike between research and problem-solving

in society, according to several of its
members, and Kays feels already there has
been "considerable movement towards
problem-solving" here and at other schools
such as MIT.
Kays would also favor doubling the
number of undergraduate students in
engineering, beyond the 400 now enrolled. By
comparison there are 1350 graduate students
in engineering.
At a time when some claim Defense
Department funding has an undue influence
on the engineering school's work, Kays
disagrees, but said that the "commotion has
helped" in causing a search for other sources
of funding.
He described research as having gained in
importance to the University since World War
11, following the guidance of Dean Frederick
Terman, and added that it is "hard to consider
engineering without industry'."
Bienenstock Appointment
Bienenstock takes a position as
vice-provost vacated by Howard Brooks last
year, named provost of the Claremont
Colleges. Chosen a University Fellow last year,
Bienenstock received a Ph.D. at Harvard and
taught there before coming to Stanford in
1967.
His best known work deals with atomic

arrangments in amorphous solids.
Kays is a member of the National Academy
of Sciences and an author of many papers on
heat transfer as well as a widely-used graduate
text, "Convective Heat and Mass Transfer."
As a teacher, Kays is "one of the top two
in the department," whose lectures are very
"well-organized," according to two of his
students.
Prof. Robert Moffat, who has done
research with Kays for 10 years, comments
that when working with Kays "problems
don't hang around long ... He is not a wait
and see type at all." On questions of policy
"he is a consensus man," asking opinions from
all of his faculty, Moffat adds.
His students find him accessible, and his
secretary maintains that "he never turns a
student away." Michael Hafferty, a law
student on the search committee, commented
that Kays is "highly regarded as one who has
instituted reforms in the curriculum," and
Kays feels that during his chairmanship, the
Mechanical Engineering Department has gone
"from mediocrity to excellence."
Kays is also on the committee which
formulates the Budget Adjustment Program,
and has held positions with the Academic
Senate and Council since 1962.
