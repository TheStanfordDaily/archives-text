## OPINIONS editorials An Immediate Response 
### 
The increased escalation of the
Indochinese War requires an immediate and
massive response by the American people.
Silence in the face of Nixon's nuclear
brinkmanship will be construed by many as
support. Many avenues of action are open to
people in the Stanford community.
We urge President Lyman to suspend the
normal activities of the University on
Thursday and Friday. At the minimum, we
support the request of the Council of
Presidents and several faculty members that
the faculty "reschedule" classes on those
days and that the Faculty Senate in its
Thursday meeting endorse this action. The

time can be used constructively to register
protests to Nixon's war policies.
Money is needed to replace a North
Vietnamese hospital bombed last
weekend—money especially to provide a
sonic generator to detect plastic pellets from
anti-personnel weapons imbedded in bodies.
People are needed to canvass precincts for
peace candidates and Peace Drive 14055.
But people should not forget this
institution's direct involvement with the
War. Protest, in legitimate and non-violent
ways, can focus attention on Stanford
Research Institute; the Industrial Park,
particularly Hewlett-Packard and Lockheed;
and the Stanford Labs.
