The Daily has previously made clear its
positions of the issues of the Indian symbol
and the Committee of 15 (C-15).
The action of the ASSU Senate and
President Lyman in abolishing the symbol
was as necessary as it was appropriate.
Although we feel that any sort of vote on a
question of this nature is unnecessary, we
nevertheless urge students to register their
opposition to the symbol with a YES vote

on the symbol referendum today and
tomorrow.
Soon after the walk-out by the six
student members of the C-15, we endorsed
their request for a referendum. The Daily
now asks that students uphold their 1971
referendum vote which favored an
all-student judicial panel for student
discipline cases. Vote YES on the judicial
system referendum.
